 **AGREEMENT AND PLAN OF MERGER**

 



 

AGREEMENT AND PLAN OF MERGER (this " _Agreement_ "), dated as of December 20,
2010, among KONINKLIJKE DSM N.V., a corporation organized in the Netherlands
(" _Parent_ "), GREENBACK ACQUISITION CORPORATION, a Delaware corporation and
indirect wholly-owned subsidiary of Parent (" _Merger Sub_ "), and MARTEK
BIOSCIENCES CORPORATION, a Delaware corporation (the " _Company_ ").

 



 

 _RECITALS_

 



 

WHEREAS, the Supervisory Board and Managing Board of Parent and the respective
Boards of Directors of Merger Sub and the Company have approved the
acquisition of the Company by Parent on the terms and subject to the
conditions set forth in this Agreement;

 



 

WHEREAS, in furtherance of such acquisition, Parent has agreed to cause Merger
Sub to commence a tender offer (as it may be amended from time to time as
permitted under this Agreement, the " _Offer_ ") to purchase all the shares of
common stock, par value $0.10 per share, of the Company (the " _Company Common
Stock_ ") issued and outstanding (each, a " _Share_ " and, collectively, the "
_Shares_ ") at a price per Share of $31.50 (such amount, or any other amount
per Share paid pursuant to the Offer and this Agreement, the " _Offer Price_
"), net to the seller in cash, on the terms and subject to the conditions set
forth in this Agreement;

 



 

WHEREAS, following consummation of the Offer, the parties intend that Merger
Sub will be merged with and into the Company (the " _Merger_ "), with the
Company surviving the Merger as an indirect wholly owned subsidiary of Parent
in accordance with the General Corporation Law of the State of Delaware (the "
_DGCL_ "), and each share of Company Common Stock that is not tendered and
accepted pursuant to the Offer will thereupon be canceled and converted into
the right to receive cash in an amount equal to the Offer Price, on the terms
and subject to the conditions set forth herein; and

 



 

WHEREAS, the Boards of Directors of the Company and Merger Sub have (i)
determined that this Agreement and the Transactions (as defined below),
including the Offer and the Merger, are advisable, fair to and in the best
interests of their respective stockholders and (ii) approved this Agreement
and the Transactions, including the Offer and the Merger, on the terms and
subject to the conditions set forth herein.

accordance with _Section 8.1_, Merger Sub shall, and Parent shall cause
Merger Sub to, commence (within the meaning of Rule 14d-2 promulgated by the

Initial Expiration Date has been extended pursuant to and in accordance with
this Agreement, the date to which the Offer has been so extended (the Initial
Expiration Date, or such later date to which the Initial Expiration Date has
been extended pursuant to and in accordance with this Agreement, is referred

Company Common Stock subject to the Offer, (B) reduce the Offer Price, (C)
waive the Minimum Tender Condition (as defined in _Exhibit A_), (D) impose

Company Common Stock, (E) extend the Offer (except as required or permitted by
the other provisions of this _Section 1.1_), (F) change the form of
consideration payable in the Offer or (G) otherwise amend the Offer in any
manner adverse in a material respect to the holders of Company Common Stock.

interpretation or position of the SEC or the staff thereof applicable to the
Offer; and

agree), until such time as such Offer Conditions are satisfied;

 



 

 _provided_ , _however_ , that (1) Merger Sub shall not be required to extend
the Offer beyond the Outside Date or the termination of this Agreement and (2)
if, at any expiration of the Offer, all of the Offer Conditions to the Offer,
except for the Minimum Tender Condition, are satisfied or have been waived,
Merger Sub shall only be required to extend the Offer for one or more
additional periods not to exceed an aggregate of fifteen Business Days.

 



 

(iii) If fewer than 90% of the issued and outstanding shares of Company Common
Stock are accepted for payment pursuant to the Offer, then Merger Sub may, and
at the request of the Company, shall, and upon any such request of the
Company, Parent shall cause Merger Sub to, make available a "subsequent
offering period," in accordance with Rule 14d-11 promulgated by the SEC under
the Exchange Act of at least ten Business Days immediately following the
Expiration Date.

 



 

(iv) On the terms and subject to the conditions of the Offer and this
Agreement, Merger Sub shall, and Parent shall cause Merger Sub to, promptly
(within the meaning of Rule 14e-1(c) under the Exchange Act) after the
Expiration Date, accept for payment and promptly thereafter pay the Offer
Price for all shares of Company Common Stock validly tendered and not properly
withdrawn pursuant to the Offer that Merger Sub becomes obligated to purchase
pursuant to the Offer.

 



 

(v) Merger Sub shall not terminate the Offer prior to any scheduled Expiration
Date without the prior written consent of the Company except in the event that
this Agreement is terminated pursuant to Article 8\. Nothing contained in this
_Section 1.1(a)_ shall affect any termination rights in _Article 8_, as to
the Agreement, or in _Exhibit A_, as to the Offer.

 



 

(vi) The Offer Price shall be adjusted appropriately to reflect the effect of
any stock split, reverse stock split, stock dividend (including any dividend
or distribution of securities convertible into Company Common Stock), cash

any event within 24 hours of such termination), irrevocably and
unconditionally terminate the Offer and shall not acquire any shares pursuant
to the Offer. If the Offer is terminated or withdrawn by Merger Sub, or this
Agreement is terminated prior to the purchase of Shares in the Offer, Merger
Sub shall promptly return, and shall cause any depository, acting on behalf of
Merger Sub to return, all tendered Shares to the registered holders thereof.

under the Exchange Act), Parent and Merger Sub shall file with the SEC,

applicable federal securities Laws. The Company and its counsel shall be given
reasonable opportunity to review and comment upon the Offer Documents and any
amendments thereto prior to filing such documents with the SEC or
dissemination of such documents to the stockholders of the Company, and Parent
and Merger Sub shall give due consideration to all the reasonable additions,

counsel, and shall provide to the Company and its counsel a copy of any
written responses thereto and telephonic notice of any oral responses or

(c) Parent shall provide or cause to be provided to Merger Sub on a timely
basis the funds necessary to purchase any shares of Company Common Stock that
Merger Sub becomes obligated to purchase pursuant to the Offer, and shall
cause Merger Sub to perform, on a timely basis, all of Merger Subs

relevant provisions of the DGCL and shall make all other filings or recordings
required under the DGCL. The Merger shall become effective at such time as the

to the Effective Time shall be the initial officers of the Surviving
Corporation and shall serve until the earlier of their resignation or removal

Section 1.8 _Top-Up Option_.

 



 

(a) Subject to _Sections 1.8(b)_ and _(c)_ , the Company grants to Merger Sub
an irrevocable option (the " _Top-Up Option_ "), for so long as this Agreement
has not been terminated pursuant to the terms hereof, to purchase from the
Company the number of authorized and not outstanding shares of Company Common
Stock (the " _Top-Up Option Shares_ ") equal to the number of shares of
Company Common Stock that, when added to the number of shares of Company
Common Stock owned by Parent and Merger Sub as of immediately prior to the
exercise of the Top-Up Option, constitutes one share more than 90% of the
number of shares of Company Common Stock then outstanding on a fully diluted
basis, determined in accordance

 



      
 

 



 

with _Section 1.8_ of the Company Disclosure Letter __ and assuming the
issuance of the Top-Up Option Shares. The obligation of the Company to issue
and deliver the Top-Up Option Shares upon the exercise of the Top-Up Option is
subject only to the conditions that (i) no Law, Judgment or other legal
restraint (other than any listing requirement of any securities exchange) that
has the effect of preventing the exercise of the Top-Up Option or the issuance
and delivery of the Top-Up Option Shares in respect of such exercise shall be
in effect and (ii) the number of Top-Up Option Shares shall not exceed the
aggregate of (x) the number of shares of Company Common Stock held as treasury
shares by the Company and any Company Subsidiary plus (y) the number of shares
of Company Common Stock that the Company is authorized to issue under its
certificate of incorporation but that are not issued and outstanding (and are
not reserved for issuance pursuant to the exercise of Options or in connection
with settlement of Restricted Stock Units), in each case, as of immediately
prior to the exercise of the Top-Up Option.

 



 

(b) The Top-Up Option may be exercised by Merger Sub, in whole but not in
part, at any time at or within three Business Days after the acceptance for
payment of, and payment by Merger Sub for, any shares of Company Common Stock
pursuant to the Offer (the " _Acceptance Time_ "). The aggregate purchase
price payable for the Top-Up Option Shares shall be determined by multiplying
the number of such Top-Up Option Shares by the Offer Price, without interest.
Such purchase price may be paid by Merger Sub, at its election, either (i)
entirely in cash or (ii) by paying in cash an amount equal to not less than
the aggregate par value of such Top-Up Option Shares and by executing and
delivering to the Company a promissory note having a principal amount equal to
the balance of such purchase price, or by any combination of cash and such
promissory note. Any such promissory note shall be full recourse against
Parent and Merger Sub, be due one year from the date the Top-Up Option Shares
are issued, bear interest at the rate of 5% per annum and may be prepaid
without premium or penalty.

 



 

(c) In the event that Merger Sub wishes to exercise the Top-Up Option, it
shall deliver to the Company a notice (the " _Top-Up Notice_ ") setting forth
(i) the number of Top-Up Option Shares that it intends to purchase pursuant to
the Top-Up Option, (ii) the manner in which it intends to pay the applicable
purchase price and (iii) the place and time at which the closing of the
purchase of the Top-Up Option Shares by Merger Sub is to take place. The Top-
Up Notice shall also include an undertaking signed by Parent and Merger Sub
that promptly following such exercise of the Top-Up Option, Merger Sub intends
to consummate the Merger in accordance with Section 253 of the DGCL as
contemplated by _Section 6.1(b)_. At the closing of the purchase of the Top-
Up Option Shares, Merger Sub shall cause to be delivered to the Company the
consideration required to be delivered in exchange for such Top-Up Option
Shares and the Company shall cause to be issued to Merger Sub a certificate
representing such shares. The parties hereto agree to use their reasonable
best efforts to cause the closing of the purchase of the Top-Up Option Shares
to occur on the same day that the Top-Up Notice is deemed received by the
Company pursuant to _Section 9.1_, and if not so consummated on such day, as
promptly thereafter as possible. The parties further agree to use their
reasonable best efforts to cause the Merger to be consummated in accordance
with Section 253 of the DGCL as contemplated by _Section 6.1(b)_ as close in
time as possible to (including, to the extent possible, on the same day as)
the issuance of the Top-Up Option Shares. Parent, Merger Sub and the

 



       
 

 



 

Company shall cooperate to ensure that any issuance of the Top-Up Option
Shares is accomplished in a manner consistent with all applicable Laws.

 



 

(d) Parent and Merger Sub acknowledge that the Top-Up Option Shares that
Merger Sub may acquire upon exercise of the Top-Up Option will not be
registered under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended (the " _Securities
Act_ "), and will be issued in reliance upon an exemption thereunder for
transactions not involving a public offering. Parent and Merger Sub represent
and warrant to the Company that Merger Sub is, or will be upon the purchase of
the Top-Up Option Shares, an "Accredited Investor," as defined in Rule 501 of
Regulation D under the Securities Act. Merger Sub agrees that the Top-Up
Option and the Top-Up Option Shares to be acquired upon exercise of the Top-Up
Option are being and will be acquired by Merger Sub for the purpose of
investment and not with a view to, or for resale in connection with, any
distribution thereof in violation of the Securities Act.

 



 

(e) The parties hereby agree and acknowledge that in any appraisal proceeding
with respect to the Appraisal Shares and to the fullest extent permitted by
applicable Law, the fair value of the Appraisal Shares shall be determined in
accordance with Section 262 of the DGCL (" _Section 262_") without regard to
the Top-Up Option, the Top-Up Option Shares or any promissory note delivered
by Merger Sub to the Company in payment for the Top-Up Option Shares.

 



 

 **ARTICLE 2**

 



 

 **EFFECT OF THE MERGER ON THE CAPITAL STOCK OF THE CONSTITUENT 
CORPORATIONS; EXCHANGE OF CERTIFICATES**

 



 

Section 2.1 _Conversion of Merger Sub Capital Stock_. At the Effective Time,
by virtue of the Merger and without any action on the part of Parent, Merger
Sub, the Company or any holder of shares of Merger Sub capital stock, each
issued and outstanding share of Merger Sub capital stock shall be converted
into and become one fully paid and nonassessable share of common stock, par
value $0.01 per share, of the Surviving Corporation.

 



 

Section 2.2 _Conversion of Company Common Stock_. At the Effective Time, by
virtue of the Merger and without any action on the part of Parent, Merger Sub,
the Company or any holder of shares of Company Common Stock:

 



 

(a) _Merger Consideration_. Each share of Company Common Stock issued and
outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time (other than any shares to
be canceled pursuant to _Section 2.2(c)_ and Appraisal Shares) shall be
canceled and shall be converted automatically into the right to receive cash
in the amount of the Offer Price without interest thereon (the " _Merger
Consideration_ "). As of the Effective Time, all such shares of Company Common
Stock shall no longer be outstanding and shall automatically be canceled and
shall cease to exist, and each holder of a certificate representing any such
shares of Company Common Stock shall cease to have any rights with respect
thereto, except the right to receive the

 



      
 

 



 

Merger Consideration upon surrender of such certificate in accordance with
_Section 2.3_, without interest. The Shares that are so converted into the
right to receive the Merger Consideration pursuant to this _Section 2.2(a)_
are referred to herein as the " _Merger Shares_ ".

 



 

(b) _Adjustment to Merger Consideration_. Without duplication to the effects
of _Section 1.1(a)(iv)_, the Merger Consideration shall be adjusted
appropriately to reflect the effect of any stock split, reverse stock split,
stock dividend (including any dividend or distribution of securities
convertible into Company Common Stock), cash dividend, reorganization,
recapitalization, reclassification, combination, exchange of shares or other
like change with respect to Company Common Stock occurring on or after the
date hereof and prior to the Effective Time.

 



 

(c) _Treasury Shares and Shares Owned by Parent_. Each share of Company Common
Stock held in the treasury of the Company and each share of Company Common
Stock owned by Merger Sub, Parent or any Subsidiary of Parent or of the
Company immediately prior to the Effective Time shall be automatically
canceled without any conversion thereof and no payment or distribution shall
be made with respect thereto.

 



 

(d) _Appraisal Rights_. Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the
contrary, shares (" _Appraisal Shares_ ") of Company Common Stock that are
outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time and that are held by any
Person who is entitled to demand and properly demands appraisal of such
Appraisal Shares pursuant to, and who complies in all respects with, Section
262 shall not be converted into the right to receive Merger Consideration as
provided in _Section 2.2(a)_, but rather the holders of Appraisal Shares
shall be entitled to be paid the fair value of such Appraisal Shares in
accordance with Section 262; _provided_ , _however_ , that if any such holder
shall fail to perfect or otherwise shall waive, withdraw or lose the right to
appraisal under Section 262, then the right of such holder to be paid the fair
value of such holders Appraisal Shares shall cease and such Appraisal Shares
shall be deemed to have been converted as of the Effective Time into, and to
have become exchangeable solely for the right to receive, Merger Consideration
as provided in _Section 2.2(a)_. The Company shall provide prompt notice to
Parent of any demands received by the Company for appraisal of any shares of
Company Common Stock, and Parent shall have the right to participate in all
negotiations and proceedings with respect to such demands. Prior to the
Effective Time, the Company shall not, without the prior written consent of
Parent (which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld or delayed), make any
payment with respect to, or settle or offer to settle, any such demands, or
agree to do any of the foregoing.

 



 

Section 2.3 _Exchange of Certificates_.

 



 

(a) _Exchange Agent_. Prior to the Effective Time, Parent shall enter into an
agreement with such bank or trust company as may be designated by Parent and
that is reasonably acceptable to the Company (the " _Exchange Agent_ "), which
shall provide for the payment of Merger Consideration in accordance with the
terms of this _Section 2.3_. Parent shall, or shall cause the Surviving
Corporation to, deposit the aggregate Merger Consideration to which holders of
Merger Shares are entitled pursuant to _Section 2.2_ with the Exchange Agent
for the benefit of the holders of Merger Shares, for payment by the Exchange
Agent in accordance with

 



      
 

 



 

this _Article 2_ (the " _Exchange Fund_ "). The Exchange Fund shall not be
used for any other purpose.

 



 

(b) _Exchange Procedures_. As soon as reasonably practicable after the
Effective Time but in any event not later than five **** Business Days
thereafter, the Exchange Agent shall mail to each holder of record of a
certificate or certificates which immediately prior to the Effective Time
represented outstanding shares of Company Common Stock (the " _Certificates_
") and to each holder of uncertificated shares of Company Common Stock (the "
_Uncertificated Shares_ "), in each case whose shares were converted into the
right to receive the Merger Consideration pursuant to _Section 2.2_, (i) a
letter of transmittal (which shall specify that delivery shall be effected,
and risk of loss and title to the Certificates or the Uncertificated Shares
shall pass, only upon delivery of the Certificates or the transfer of the
Uncertificated Shares to the Exchange Agent and shall be in such form and have
such other provisions as Parent may reasonably specify) and (ii) instructions
for use in surrendering the Certificates or transfer of the Uncertificated
Shares in exchange for the Merger Consideration. Each holder of shares of
Company Common Stock that have been converted into the right to receive the
Merger Consideration shall be entitled to receive the Merger Consideration in
respect of the Company Common Stock represented by a Certificate or
Uncertificated Share, upon (A) surrender of a Certificate for cancellation to
the Exchange Agent, together with such letter of transmittal, duly executed,
and such other documents as may reasonably be required by the Exchange Agent,
or (B) receipt of an "agents message" by the Exchange Agent (or such other
evidence, if any, of transfer as the Exchange Agent may reasonably request),
in the case of a book-entry transfer of Uncertificated Shares. Upon payment of
the Merger Consideration pursuant to the provisions of this _Article 2_, each
Certificate or Uncertificated Share so surrendered or transferred shall
forthwith be canceled. In the event of a transfer of ownership of Company
Common Stock that is not registered in the transfer records of the Company,
payment may be made to a Person other than the Person in whose name the
Certificate so surrendered or the Uncertificated Shares so transferred is
registered if such Certificate shall be properly endorsed or otherwise be in
proper form for transfer or such Uncertificated Shares shall be properly
transferred and the Person requesting such issuance shall pay any transfer or
other Taxes required by reason of the payment to a Person other than the
registered holder of such Certificate or Uncertificated Shares or establish to
the satisfaction of Parent that such Tax has been paid or is not applicable.
Each Certificate and each Uncertificated Share shall be deemed at any time
after the Effective Time to represent only the right to receive upon surrender
in accordance with this _Section 2.3_ the Merger Consideration into which the
shares of Company Common Stock represented by such Certificate or
Uncertificated Shares shall have been converted pursuant to _Section 2.2_. No
interest shall be paid or shall accrue on any cash payable to holders of
Certificates or Uncertificated Shares pursuant to the provisions of this
_Article 2_.

 



 

(c) _No Further Ownership Rights in Company Common Stock_. The Merger
Consideration paid upon the surrender for exchange of Certificates or transfer
of Uncertificated Shares in accordance with the terms of this _Article 2_
shall be deemed to have been paid in full satisfaction of all rights
pertaining to the shares of Company Common Stock theretofore represented by
such Certificates or Uncertificated Shares, _subject_ , _however_ , to the
Surviving Corporations obligation to pay any dividends or make any other
distributions with a record date prior to the Effective Time that may have
been declared or made by the Company on such shares

 



      
 

 



 

of Company Common Stock in accordance with the terms of this Agreement or
prior to the date of this Agreement and that remain unpaid at the Effective
Time, and there shall be no further registration of transfers on the stock
transfer books of the Company of the shares of Company Common Stock that were
outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time. If, after the Effective
Time, Certificates or Uncertificated Shares are presented to the Surviving
Corporation or the Exchange Agent for any reason, they shall be canceled and
exchanged as provided in this _Article 2_, except as otherwise provided by
Law.

 



 

(d) _Termination of Exchange Fund_. Any portion of the Exchange Fund that
remains undistributed to the holders of Certificates or Uncertificated Shares
for nine months after the Effective Time shall be delivered to Parent, upon
demand, and any holders of Certificates or Uncertificated Shares who have not
theretofore complied with this _Article 2_ shall thereafter look only to
Parent for payment of their claim for Merger Consideration.

 



 

(e) _No Liability_. None of Parent, Merger Sub, the Company or the Exchange
Agent shall be liable to any Person in respect of any cash from the Exchange
Fund delivered to a public official pursuant to any applicable abandoned
property, escheat or similar Law. If any Certificate or Uncertificated Share
shall not have been surrendered immediately prior to such date on which any
amounts payable pursuant to this _Article 2_ would otherwise escheat to or
become the property of any Governmental Authority (as defined in _Section

supply Parent with copies of all correspondence between the Company or any of
its Representatives, on the one hand, and the SEC or its staff, on the other
hand, with respect to the Proxy Statement. If at any time prior to receipt of
the Required

 



      
 

 



 

Company Stockholder Vote there shall occur any event that is required to be
set forth in an amendment or supplement to the Proxy Statement, the Company
shall promptly prepare and mail to its stockholders such an amendment or
supplement. The Company shall use its reasonable best efforts ** __** to cause
the Proxy Statement to be mailed to the holders of Company Common Stock as
promptly as practicable after filing with the SEC.

 



 

(b) If the adoption of this Agreement by the holders of Company Common Stock
is required by Law, the Company shall, at Parents request, as soon as
practicable following the expiration of the Offer, duly call, give notice of,
convene and hold a meeting of its stockholders (the " _Company Stockholders
Meeting_ ") for the purpose of seeking the Required Company Stockholder Vote.
Unless the Company Board has withdrawn its recommendation of this Agreement,
the Merger or the other Transactions in compliance with _Section 6.8(b)_, the
Company shall use its commercially reasonable efforts to solicit from
stockholders of the Company proxies in favor of the adoption of this Agreement
and shall take all other action necessary or advisable to secure the vote or
consent of the holders of Company Common Stock required by applicable Law to
effect the Merger. Once the Company Stockholders Meeting has been called and
noticed, the Company shall not postpone or adjourn the Company Stockholders
Meeting without the consent of Parent, which shall not be unreasonably
withheld or delayed, except (i) for the absence of a quorum or (ii) to allow
reasonable additional time for the filing and mailing of any supplemental or
amended disclosure which it believes in good faith is necessary under
applicable Law and for such supplemental or amended disclosure to be
disseminated and reviewed by the holders of Company Common Stock prior to the
Company Stockholders Meeting; provided that in the event that the Company
Stockholders Meeting is delayed to a date after the Outside Date as a result
of either (i) or (ii) above, then the Outside Date shall be extended to the
fifth Business Day after the date of the Company Stockholders Meeting).
Notwithstanding the foregoing, if Parent, Merger Sub and any other Parent
Subsidiary shall collectively acquire or hold at least 90% of the outstanding
shares of the Company Common Stock, the parties shall take all necessary and
appropriate action to cause the Merger to become effective as soon as
practicable after the expiration of the Offer without a stockholders meeting
in accordance with Section 253 of the DGCL.

 



 

(c) Parent shall cause all shares of Company Common Stock purchased pursuant
to the Offer and all other shares of Company Common Stock owned by Parent,
Merger Sub or any Parent Subsidiary to be voted in favor of the adoption of
this Agreement.

 



 

Section 6.2 _Employee Benefit Matters_.

 



 

(a) From and after the Effective Time, the Surviving Corporation shall (and
Parent shall cause the Surviving Corporation to) honor the Employee Plans set
forth on _Section 6.2(a)_ of the Company Disclosure Letter (the " _Continuing
Plans_ ") in accordance with their terms as in effect immediately prior to the
Effective Time, _provided_ that, subject to _Section 6.2(b)_, nothing in this
sentence shall prohibit the Surviving Corporation from terminating or amending
any such Continuing Plans, arrangements or agreements in accordance with their
terms or if otherwise required by applicable law.

 



      
 

 



 

(b) Through the end of 2011, Parent agrees to provide or cause the Company to
provide employees of the Company and each Company Subsidiary with (i) the
benefit of the Continuing Plans at benefit levels that are no less than those
in effect on the date of this Agreement and (ii) salary, annual bonus
opportunity and employee benefits (excluding any equity based compensation) in
the aggregate no less favorable than those currently provided by the Company
and the Company Subsidiaries to such employees (in case of benefits, such
employees considered as a group); _provided_ that Parent shall be under no
obligation to retain any employee or group of employees of the Company or the
Company Subsidiaries other than as required by applicable Law.

 



 

(c) For purposes of all employee benefit plans, programs and arrangements
maintained by or contributed to by Parent and the Parent Subsidiaries in which
Company Employees participate (including, after the Closing, the Surviving
Corporation), Parent shall, or shall cause its Subsidiaries to, cause each
such plan, program or arrangement to treat the prior service with the Company
and its affiliates of each individual who is an employee or former employee of
the Company or the Company Subsidiaries immediately prior to the Closing (a "
_Company Employee_ ") (to the same extent such service is recognized under
analogous plans, programs or arrangements of the Company or its affiliates
prior to the Closing) as service rendered to Parent or the Parent
Subsidiaries, as the case may be, for purposes of eligibility to participate
in and vesting thereunder (but not benefit accrual); _provided_ , _however_ ,
that such crediting of service shall not operate to duplicate any benefit or
the funding of such benefit. Company employees shall also be given credit for
any deductible or co-payment amounts paid in respect of the plan year in which
the Closing occurs, to the extent that, following the Closing, they
participate in any other plan for which deductibles or co-payments are
required. Parent shall also cause each Employee Benefit Plan maintained by or
contributed to by Parent and the Parent Subsidiaries (including, after the
Closing, the Surviving Corporation) in which Company employees participate, to
waive any preexisting condition that was waived under the terms of any Company
Employee Benefit Plan immediately prior to the Closing or waiting period
limitation which would otherwise be applicable to a Company Employee on or
after the Closing. Parent shall recognize any accrued but unused vacation and
sick leave of the Company employees as of the Closing Date, in accordance with
the terms of such Company policies and Parent shall cause the Surviving
Corporation to provide such vacation and sick leave in accordance with the
terms of such Company policies but in no event will Parent be obligated to
extend or enlarge the benefits available under such Company policies.

 



 

(d) Effective as of the Closing Date Parent shall cause the Surviving
Corporation to adopt an employee bonus plan for the benefit of the Company
Employees who are identified in _Section 6.2(d)_ of the Company Disclosure
Letter under which the Company Employees who remain employed by the Surviving
Corporation or Parent or any Affiliate of Parent on such date or dates as are
fixed in the bonus plan would receive bonus payments as described on _Section
6.2(d)_ of the Company Disclosure Letter as a replacement for any Restricted
Stock Units that such employees may have received after the date of this
Agreement.

 



 

(e) This _Section 6.2_ shall inure exclusively to the benefit of, and be
binding solely upon, the parties to this Agreement and their respective
successors, permitted assigns, executors and legal representatives. Nothing in
this _Section 6.2_, expressed or implied, shall be

 



      
 

 



 

construed to create any third-party beneficiary rights in any present or
former employee, service provider, or any such Persons alternative payees,
dependents or beneficiaries, whether in respect of continued employment or
resumed employment, compensation, benefits, terms of employment, or otherwise.

 



 

Section 6.3 _Antitrust Filings_.

 



 

(a) Each of Parent and Merger Sub (and their respective affiliates, if
applicable), on the one hand, and the Company (if applicable), on the other
hand, shall (i) file with the FTC and the Antitrust Division of the United
States Department of Justice (the " _DOJ_ ") a Notification and Report Form
relating to this Agreement and the Transactions as required by the HSR Act
within ten (10) Business Days following the execution and delivery of this
Agreement or such later date as may be mutually agreed by antitrust counsel
for Parent and the Company, and (ii) file comparable pre-merger or post-merger
notification filings, forms and submissions with any foreign Governmental
Authority that are required by any other applicable Antitrust Laws in
connection with the Transactions within ten (10) Business Days following the
execution and delivery of this Agreement (or, if later, of the identification
by a party that such filing with a foreign Governmental Authority is so
required) or such later date as may be mutually agreed by antitrust counsel
for Parent and the Company. Parent shall pay directly to the applicable
Governmental Authority the applicable filing fee required in connection with
the filings and other materials required under the HSR Act or other applicable
antitrust or competition Laws in connection with the Transactions. Each of
Parent and the Company shall (A) cooperate and coordinate with the other in
the making of such filings; (B) supply the other with any information that may
be required in order to make such filings; (C) supply any additional
information that reasonably may be required or requested by the FTC, the DOJ
or the Governmental Authorities of any other applicable jurisdiction in which
any such filing is made under any other Antitrust Laws; and (D) subject to
_Section 6.3(c)_, take all action reasonably necessary to cause the
expiration or termination of the applicable waiting periods under the HSR Act
and any other Antitrust Laws applicable to the Transactions as soon as
practicable, and to obtain any required consents under any other Antitrust
Laws applicable to the Transactions as soon as reasonably practicable.

 



 

(b) Each of Parent and Merger Sub (and their respective affiliates, if
applicable), on the one hand, and the Company, on the other hand, shall
promptly inform the other of any communication from any Governmental Authority
regarding any of the Transactions in connection with such filings and, if
permitted or not objected to by the relevant Governmental Authority, shall
permit the other party to participate in any meeting, telephone conversation
or other similar communication on substance that such party has with a
Governmental Authority regarding Antitrust Laws. If any party hereto or
Affiliate thereof shall receive a request for additional information or
documentary material from any Governmental Authority with respect to the
Transactions pursuant to the HSR Act or any other Antitrust Laws applicable to
the Transactions with respect to which any such filings have been made, then
such party shall make (or cause to be made), as soon as reasonably practicable
and after consultation with the other party, an appropriate response in
compliance with such request. Any information a party provides to the other
party under this _Section 6.3_ may be designated by the providing party in
its reasonable discretion as provided for review only by the outside counsel
to the receiving party.

 



      
 

 



 

(c) Subject to the next sentence, Parent shall take any and all action
required by a Governmental Authority in respect of an Antitrust Law that is
necessary to ensure that no such Governmental Authority enters any order,
decision, judgment, decree, ruling, injunction (preliminary or permanent), or
establishes any law, rule, regulation or other action preliminarily or
permanently restraining, enjoining or prohibiting the consummation of the
Transactions, or to ensure that no such Governmental Authority with the
authority to clear, authorize or otherwise approve the consummation of the
Transactions, fails to do so by the Outside Date, including (i) selling or
otherwise disposing of, or holding separate and agreeing to sell or otherwise
dispose of, assets, categories of assets or businesses of the Company or
Parent or their respective Subsidiaries; (ii) terminating existing
relationships, contractual rights or obligations of the Company or Parent or
their respective Subsidiaries; (iii) terminating any venture or other
arrangement; (iv) creating any relationship, contractual rights or obligations
of the Company or Parent or their respective Subsidiaries or (v) effectuating
any other change or restructuring of the Company or Parent their respective
Subsidiaries (and, in each case, to enter into agreements or stipulate to the
entry of an order or decree or file appropriate applications with any
Governmental Authority in connection with any of the foregoing and in the case
of actions by or with respect to the Company or its Subsidiaries or its or
their businesses or assets; by consenting to such action by the Company and
_provided_ , that any such action may, at the discretion of the Company, be
conditioned upon consummation of the Transactions) (each a " _Divestiture
Action_ "). Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the contrary,
neither Parent nor Merger Sub shall be required to take, or cause to be taken,
any Divestiture Action that Parent determines in its reasonable judgment would
be reasonably likely to have a fundamental and adverse impact on the business
of, or Parents strategy with respect to, the combined nutrition businesses of
Parent and the Company. In the event that any action is threatened or
instituted challenging any of the Transactions as violative of any pre-merger
notification requirement or other Antitrust Law, Parent shall take all action
necessary, including any Divestiture Action, to avoid or resolve such action.
In the event that any permanent or preliminary injunction or other order is
entered or becomes reasonably foreseeable to be entered in any proceeding that
would make consummation of the Transactions in accordance with the terms of
this Agreement unlawful or that would restrain, enjoin or otherwise prevent or
materially delay the consummation of the Transactions, Parent shall take
promptly any and all steps necessary to vacate, modify or suspend such
injunction or order so as to permit such consummation prior to the Outside
Date.

 



 

(d) If any Divestiture Action agreed to by Parent requires action by or with
respect to the Company or its Subsidiaries or its or their businesses or
assets, and such action would constitute a breach of this Agreement, the
Parent hereby agrees to consent to the taking of such action by the Company
and any such action may, at the discretion of the Company, be conditioned upon
consummation of the Transactions.

 



 

(e) " _Antitrust Law_ " means the Sherman Act, as amended, the Clayton Act, as
amended, the HSR Act, the Federal Trade Commission Act, as amended, and all
other laws, that are designed or intended to prohibit, restrict or regulate
actions having the purpose or effect of monopolization or restraint of trade
or significant impediments or lessening of competition or the creation or
strengthening of a dominant position through merger or acquisition, in any
case that are applicable to the Transactions.

 



      
 

 



 

Section 6.4 _Public Statements_. Neither the Company nor Parent, nor any of
their respective Subsidiaries, shall issue or cause the publication of any
press release or other announcement with respect to the Offer, the Merger or
the Transactions without the prior consent of the other party, unless such
party determines, after consultation with outside counsel, that it is required
by applicable Law or by any listing agreement with or the listing rules of a
national securities exchange or trading market to issue or cause the
publication of any press release or other announcement with respect to the
Offer, the Merger or this Agreement, in which event such party shall endeavor,
on a basis reasonable under the circumstances, to provide a meaningful
opportunity to the other parties to review and comment upon such press release
or other announcement and shall give due consideration to all reasonable
additions, deletions or changes suggested thereto; _provided, however_ , that
the party seeking to issue or cause the publication of any press release or
other announcement with respect to the Offer, the Merger or the Transactions
shall not be required to provide any such review or comment to the other party
in connection with any disclosure contemplated by _Section 6.8_.

 



 

Section 6.5 _Standard of Efforts_. Subject to the terms and conditions
provided herein, each of the Company, Parent and Merger Sub agrees to use
reasonable best efforts to take, or cause to be taken, such action, and to do,
or cause to be done, and to assist and cooperate with the other parties in
doing, such things necessary, proper or advisable to consummate and make
effective in the most expeditious manner practicable, the Offer, the Merger
and the other Transactions, including (i) obtaining all permits, consents,
approvals, authorizations and actions or nonactions required for or in
connection with the consummation by the parties hereto of the Offer, the
Merger and the other Transactions, (ii) the taking of such commercially
reasonable steps as may be necessary to obtain an approval or waiver from, or
to avoid an action or proceeding by, a Governmental Authority, (iii) the
obtaining of all necessary consents from third parties, (iv) contesting and
resisting, and seeking to have vacated, lifted, reversed or overturned, any
Judgment (whether temporary, preliminary or permanent) that restricts,
prevents or prohibits the consummation of the Offer, the Merger or the other
Transactions and (v) the execution and delivery of any additional instruments
necessary to consummate the Transactions and to fully carry out the purposes
of this Agreement. The Company shall have the right to review, comment on and
approve in advance all characterizations of the information relating to the
Company; Parent shall have the right to review, comment on and approve in
advance all characterizations of the information relating to Parent or Merger
Sub; and each of the Company and Parent shall have the right to review and
approve in advance all characterizations of the information relating to the
Transactions, in each case which appear in any material filing (including the
Offer Documents, the Schedule 14D-9 and the Proxy Statement) made in
connection with the Transactions. The Company, Parent and Merger Sub agree
that they shall consult and cooperate with each other with respect to the
obtaining of all such necessary permits, consents, approvals and
authorizations of all third parties and Governmental Authorities and in
promptly making all necessary filings. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the
Company and the Company Board shall not be restricted from taking any action
permitted by _Section 6.8_.

 



 

Section 6.6 _Notification of Certain Matters_. Each of the Company and Parent
agrees to give prompt notice to the other of (i) any written notice received
from any Person alleging that the consent of such Person is required in
connection with the Transactions, (ii) any notice from any Governmental
Authority in connection with the Transactions or (iii) any fact, event or

 



      
 

 



 

circumstance known to it that is reasonably likely, individually or taken
together with all other existing facts, events and circumstances known to it,
to result in the failure of any of the conditions set forth on Exhibit A or in
Article 7 to be satisfied _provided_ , that the failure to deliver any notice
pursuant to this _Section 6.6_ shall not be considered in determining whether
the conditions set forth on Exhibit A or in _Article 7_ have been satisfied.
In no event shall the delivery of any notice by a party pursuant to this
_Section 6.6_ limit or otherwise affect the respective rights, obligations,
remedies, representations, warranties, covenants or agreements of the parties
or the conditions to the obligations of the parties under this Agreement.

 



 

Section 6.7 _Access to Information; Confidentiality_.

 



 

(a) Subject to applicable Law, the Company shall, and shall cause each Company
Subsidiary and the officers, directors, employees and agents of the Company
and each Company Subsidiary, to, afford the officers, employees and agents of
Parent and Merger Sub, at their sole cost and risk, reasonable access during
normal business hours from the date hereof through the Effective Date to its
officers, employees, agents, properties, facilities, books, records, contracts
and other assets and shall furnish Parent and Merger Sub all financial,
operating and other data and information as Parent and Merger Sub through
their officers, employees or agents, may reasonably request; _provided,
however,_ that the Company may, after consultation with its outside counsel,
restrict or otherwise prohibit access to any documents or information to the
extent that: (i) based on the advice of such counsel, the Company reasonably
concludes access to such documents or information would give rise to a waiver
of the attorney-client privilege, work product doctrine or other applicable
privilege between attorney and client applicable to such documents or
information; (ii) access to a Contract to which the Company or any Company
Subsidiary is a party or otherwise bound would violate in a material respect
or cause a material default under, or give a third party the right to
terminate or accelerate the rights under, such Contract (it being agreed that,
if requested by Parent, (A) the Company will seek the consent of the relevant
third party to permit Parent to have access to such Contract or (B) the
Company and Parent shall cooperate in good faith to design and implement
alternative procedures to enable Parent to evaluate any such Contract without
causing a violation or causing a default thereunder or giving any third party
a right to terminate or accelerate the rights thereunder); or (iii) such
disclosure relates to individual performance or personnel evaluation records,
medical histories or other personnel information, and based on the advice of
such counsel, the Company reasonably concludes that such access would
constitute a violation of Law by the Company or any Company Subsidiary; and
_provided further,_ that nothing in this _Section 6.7_ or elsewhere in this
Agreement shall be construed to require the Company or its Representatives to
prepare any reports, analyses, appraisals, opinions or other information. Any
investigation conducted pursuant to the access contemplated by this _Section
6.7_ shall be conducted in a manner that does not unreasonably interfere with
the conduct of the business of the Company and the Company Subsidiaries or
create a risk of damage or destruction to any property or assets of the
Company or any Company Subsidiary. Any access to the Companys properties
shall be subject to the Companys reasonable security measures and insurance
requirements and shall not include the right to perform invasive testing.

 



 

(b) The provisions of the Mutual Confidentiality Agreement entered with effect
as of December 8, 2009, as amended, between Parent and the Company (the

 



      
 

 



 

" _Confidentiality Agreement_ ") shall remain in full force and effect in
accordance with its terms and apply to any information provided by the Company
to Parent or Merger Sub, or by Parent or Merger Sub to the Company, under this
Agreement.

 



 

Section 6.8 _No Solicitation; Company Recommendation_.

 



 

(a) From the date of this Agreement until the Effective Time or, if earlier,
the termination of this Agreement in accordance with its terms, the Company
shall not, shall cause each Company Subsidiary and each officer, director or
employee of the Company or of Company Subsidiary not to, and shall not
authorize or permit any financial advisor, attorney or other advisor or
representative (a _"Representative"_ ) of the Company or any Company
Subsidiary, directly or indirectly, to (i) solicit, initiate, or knowingly
encourage the submission of, any Takeover Proposal (as hereinafter defined),
(ii) participate or engage in any discussions or negotiations regarding, or
furnish to any Person any non-public information with respect to, or knowingly
take any action to facilitate any inquiries or the making of any proposal that
constitutes, or would reasonably be expected to lead to, any Takeover Proposal
or (iii) release any third party from any confidentiality agreement entered
into in connection with any Takeover Proposal or potential Takeover Proposal
or any standstill agreement or standstill provision to which the Company is a
party, fail to reasonably enforce or grant any material waiver, request or
consent to any Takeover Proposal under, any such agreement. The Company shall,
and shall cause each Company Subsidiary and the Companys and each such
Company Subsidiarys respective Representatives to, immediately cease and
terminate any existing solicitation, encouragement, activity, discussion or
negotiation heretofore conducted by the Company, any Company Subsidiary or
their respective Representatives with respect to any Takeover Proposal. The
Company shall promptly after the date of this Agreement instruct each Person
which has heretofore executed a confidentiality agreement relating to any
Takeover Proposal with or for the benefit of the Company to promptly return or
destroy all information, documents and materials relating to an Takeover
Proposal or to the Company or its businesses, operations or affairs heretofore
furnished by the Company or any of its Representatives to such Person or any
of its Representatives in accordance with the terms of any confidentiality
agreement with such Person. It is understood that any violation of the
restrictions of this _Section 6.8(a)_ in any material respect by any
Representative of the Company or any Company Subsidiary shall be deemed a
breach of this _Section 6.8(a)_ by the Company if the Company does not cure
any such violation within three Business Days following the date on which the
Company obtains knowledge of such violation.

 



 

(b) Notwithstanding the restrictions set forth in _Section 6.8(a)_, if, prior
to the acceptance for payment of shares of Company Common Stock pursuant to
the Offer, in response to an unsolicited written Takeover Proposal received
after the date of this Agreement from a third party that has not resulted from
a breach or violation of _Section 6.8(a)_ and that the Company Board
determines in good faith (after consultation with its financial advisor) is,
or would reasonably be expected to result in or lead to, a Superior Proposal
(as hereinafter defined) and (after consultation with its outside legal
counsel) that the failure to take such action would be reasonably likely to
violate the fiduciary duties of the Company Board to the Companys
stockholders under applicable Law, the Company and its Representatives may (i)
furnish information with respect to the Company and each Company Subsidiary to
the Person making such Takeover Proposal and its representatives pursuant to a
confidentiality agreement

 



       
 

 



 

containing terms no less favorable in the aggregate to the Company than the
terms of the Confidentiality Agreement (except that such confidentiality
agreement shall contain additional provisions that expressly permit the
Company to comply with the provisions of this _Section 6.8_), _provided_ ,
that a copy of all such information is delivered substantially concurrently to
Parent to the extent it has not previously been so furnished to Parent and
(ii) engage in such negotiations or discussions with the third party that made
such Takeover Proposal as the Company Board shall determine (including
solicitation of a revised Takeover Proposal from such third party). The
Company shall give Parent written notice (which notice shall contain the
identity of the Person making such Takeover Proposal, a copy of the Takeover
Proposal if it is in writing or otherwise a description of the material terms
and conditions thereof and a statement to the effect that the Company Board
has made the determination required by this _Section 6.8(b)_ in respect
thereof and the Company intends to furnish non-public information to, or enter
into discussions or negotiations with, such Person making such Takeover
Proposal) prior to taking the actions in clause (i) or (ii) of the immediately
preceding sentence, and in any event shall not take any of such actions with
respect to a Takeover Proposal within the twenty-four hours immediately
following delivery of the notice provided by the Company to Parent pursuant to
the last sentence of _Section 6.8(g)_ in respect of such Takeover Proposal.

 



 

(c) Except as otherwise permitted by _Section 6.8(d)_, neither the Company
Board nor any committee thereof shall (i) withdraw, qualify, modify, change or
amend (or propose publicly to withdraw, qualify, modify, change or amend) in
any manner adverse to Parent or Merger Sub (including pursuant to the Schedule
14D-9 or the Proxy Statement or any amendment thereto), the Company
Recommendation, (ii) approve or recommend or propose publicly to approve or
recommend, any Takeover Proposal (any of the foregoing in clause (i) or (ii),
a _"Company Change in Recommendation"_ ), or (iii) authorize the Company to,
and the Company shall not, enter into any agreement, agreement-in-principle or
letter of intent with respect to, or accept, any Takeover Proposal.

 



 

(d) Notwithstanding the provisions of this _Section 6.8_, at any time prior
to the acceptance for payment of the shares of Company Common Stock pursuant
to the Offer, if the Company Board (or the applicable committee thereof) has
received a Takeover Proposal (that has not been withdrawn) that constitutes a
Superior Proposal and such Takeover Proposal shall not have resulted from a
breach or violation of the terms of _Section 6.8(a)_, the Company Board (or
the applicable committee thereof) may (i) make a Company Change in
Recommendation, and/or (ii) to the extent permitted by _Section 8.1(e)(i)_,
cause the Company to terminate this Agreement to authorize and allow the
Company substantially concurrently to enter into a binding written agreement
concerning a transaction that constitutes a Superior Proposal if:

 



 

(A) the Company Board (or the applicable committee thereof) determines in good
faith (after consultation with its outside legal counsel) that the failure to
take such action would be reasonably likely to violate the fiduciary duties of
the Company Board to the Companys stockholders under applicable Law;

 



 

(B) prior to the Company Board taking any such action, the Company shall have
(x) provided to Parent a written notice, which notice shall (1) state that the
Company has received a Takeover Proposal which the Company has determined is a
Superior Proposal and that

 



      
 

 



 

the Company intends to take such action and (2) include the identity of the
Person making such Superior Proposal, the most current written draft agreement
relating to the transaction that constitutes such Superior Proposal and all
related transaction agreements to which the Company would be a party, and (y)
given such notice to Parent at least three Business Days prior to taking any
such action (it being understood that any material amendment to the terms of
such Superior Proposal shall require a new notice and a new three Business Day
period) and given Parent during such three Business Day period the opportunity
to meet or negotiate with the Company Board and its outside legal counsel
(and, if Parent has so requested, shall have met and negotiated with Parent in
good faith) with respect to any modification of the terms and conditions of
this Agreement proposed by Parent that, if made, would obviate the need for
the Company to take the actions specified in clauses (d)(i) or (d)(ii) above;
and

 



 

(C) Parent shall not have made, within three Business Days after receipt of
such notice, a proposal to amend the terms contemplated by this Agreement that
the Company Board determines in good faith (after consultation with its
financial advisor and outside legal counsel) is at least as favorable from a
financial point of view to the Companys stockholders as such Superior
Proposal.

 



 

The Company Board may also make a Company Change in Recommendation at any time
prior to the Acceptance Time in the absence of a Takeover Proposal if a
material event or change in circumstances has occurred after the date hereof
that was not known or reasonably foreseeable by the Company prior to the date
hereof (or, if known, the material consequence of which could not reasonably
have been known to or understood by the Company Board as of the date of this
Agreement) and the Company Board (or the applicable committee thereof)
determines in good faith (after consultation with its outside legal counsel)
that the failure to take such action would be reasonably likely to violate the
fiduciary duties of the Company Board to the Companys stockholders under
applicable Law.

 



 

(e) Nothing contained in this _Section 6.8_ shall prohibit the Company or the
Company Board from (i) taking and disclosing to the holders of Company Common
Stock a position with respect to a tender or exchange offer by a third party
pursuant to Rules 14d-9 and 14e-2(a) promulgated under the Exchange Act or
Item 1012(a) of Regulation M-A or (ii) making any disclosure to the holders of
Company Common Stock, if in the good faith judgment of the Company Board
(after consultation with its outside legal counsel), failure to do so would
violate its obligations under applicable Law (including the Company Boards
duties of good faith and candor to the holders of Company Common Stock)
subject to compliance with any applicable requirements of this _Section 6.8_.
For the avoidance of doubt, this _Section 6.8(e)_ shall not limit any of
Parents rights under Article 8 in respect of any such position taken or
disclosure made.

 



 

(f) For purposes of this Agreement:

 



 

(i) " _Takeover Proposal_" shall mean any inquiry, proposal or offer from any
Person or "group" (as defined under Section 13(d) of the Exchange Act) (other
than Parent, Merger Sub or any of their affiliates) relating to any
acquisition, merger, consolidation, reorganization, share exchange,
recapitalization, liquidation, dissolution, direct or indirect

 



      
 

 



 

business combination, asset acquisition, exclusive license, tender or exchange
offer or other similar transaction involving the Company or any Company
Subsidiary of (A) the assets or businesses that constitute or represent 25% or
more of the total revenue, operating income, research and development budget,
or assets of the Company and the Company Subsidiaries, taken as a whole, (B)
25% or more of the outstanding shares of Company Common Stock or any other
Company capital stock or capital stock of, or other equity or voting interests
in, any Company Subsidiary directly or indirectly holding, individually or
taken together, the assets or business referred to in clause (A) above, in
each case other than the Transactions, (C) pursuant to which the stockholders
of the Company immediately preceding such transaction hold less than 75% of
the voting equity interest in the surviving or resulting entity of such
transaction or (D) any combination of the foregoing.

 



 

(ii) " _Superior Proposal_ " means any bona fide written offer in respect of a
Takeover Proposal (provided, that for the purposes of this definition all
references to 25% in the definition of Takeover Proposal shall be replaced by
references to a "majority" and all references to 75% shall be to 25%) received
by the Company after the date hereof (A) that is not the result of a breach or
violation of _Section 6.8(a)_ of this Agreement and (B) on terms that the
Company Board determines in its good faith judgment (after consultation with
its financial advisor and outside legal counsel), taking into account all
relevant factors, including the price, form of consideration, closing
conditions, the ability to finance the proposal, the identity of the Person or
Persons making the proposal and other aspects of the proposal that the Company
Board deems relevant, (1) would, if consummated, result in a transaction that
is more favorable from a financial point of view to the holders of Company
Common Stock than the Transactions (including the terms of any proposal by
Parent to modify the terms of the Transactions) and (2) is reasonably likely
to be completed on the terms proposed in a timely fashion.

 



 

(g) In addition to the other obligations of the Company set forth in this
_Section 6.8_, the Company shall promptly, and in any case within twenty-four
hours of its receipt advise Parent orally and in writing of any request for
information with respect to any Takeover Proposal, or any inquiry with respect
to or which could reasonably be expected to result in a Takeover Proposal, and
the material terms and conditions of such request, Takeover Proposal or
inquiry, including the identity of the Person or group making any such
Takeover Proposal and a copy of all written materials provided in connection
with such Takeover Proposal. The Company shall keep Parent informed on a
reasonably current basis of the status and material terms and conditions
(including all amendments or proposed amendments) of any such Takeover
Proposal or inquiry and shall immediately provide to Parent a copy of all
written materials subsequently provided to or by the Company in connection
with such Takeover Proposal. In addition to the foregoing, the Company shall
provide Parent with at least forty-eight hours prior notice of a meeting of
the Company Board (or such lesser notice as is provided to the members of the
Company Board) at which the Company Board is reasonably expected to consider a
Takeover Proposal.

 



 

(h) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary set forth in this _Section 6.8_
or elsewhere in this Agreement, if the Company receives a written Takeover
Proposal from any Person, the Company and/or its Representatives may contact
such Person to clarify the terms thereof.

 



      
 

 



 

Section 6.9 _Indemnification and Insurance_.

 



 

(a) Parent and Merger Sub agree that all rights to indemnification by the
Company now existing in favor of each individual who is now, or has been at
any time prior to the date hereof or who becomes prior to the Effective Time
an officer or director of the Company or any Company Subsidiary or an employee
of the Company or any Company Subsidiary or who acts as a fiduciary under any
of the Company Employee Benefit Plans (each an " _Indemnified Party_ ") as
provided in the Companys certificate of incorporation or bylaws, in each case
as in effect on the date of this Agreement, or pursuant to any other
agreements in effect on the date hereof, including provisions relating to the
advancement of expenses incurred in the defense of any action or suit, shall
survive the Merger and shall remain in full force and effect, and the
Surviving Corporation shall honor and fulfill in all respects such rights to
indemnification. In addition, during the period commencing at the Effective
Time and ending on the sixth (6th) anniversary of the Effective Time, the
certificate of incorporation and bylaws of the Surviving Corporation shall
contain provisions with respect to indemnification, exculpation and the
advancement of expenses that are at least as favorable as the indemnification,
exculpation and advancement of expenses provisions set forth in the
certificate of incorporation and bylaws of the Company as of the date hereof,
and during such six-year period such provisions shall not be repealed,
materially amended or otherwise modified in any material respect except as
required by applicable law.

 



 

(b) The Surviving Corporation shall maintain the Companys officers and
directors liability insurance policies, in effect on the date of this
Agreement (the " _D andO Insurance_"), for a period of not less than six years
after the Effective Time, but only to the extent related to actions or
omissions prior to the Effective Time; provided that (i) the Surviving
Corporation may substitute therefor policies of at least the same coverage and
amounts, in the aggregate, and containing terms no less advantageous to such
former directors or officers and (ii) such substitution shall not result in
gaps or lapses of coverage with respect to matters occurring prior to the
Effective Time; _provided_ , _further_ , that in no event shall the Surviving
Corporation be required to expend more than an amount per year equal to 300%
of current annual premiums paid by the Company for such insurance (the "
_Maximum Amount_ ") to maintain or procure insurance coverage pursuant to this
_Section 6.9_; and _provided_ , _further_ , that if the amount of the annual
premiums necessary to maintain or procure such insurance coverage exceeds the
Maximum Amount, the Surviving Corporation shall procure and maintain for such
six-year period as much coverage as reasonably practicable for the Maximum
Amount. Prior to the Effective Time, notwithstanding anything to the contrary
set forth in this Agreement, the Company may, without Parents prior consent,
purchase a six-year "tail" prepaid policy on the DandO Insurance at a cost per
year covered for such tail policy not to exceed the Maximum Amount, and such
"tail" policy shall satisfy the provisions of this _Section 6.9(b)_.

 



 

(c) Without limiting the generality of the provisions of _Section 6.9(a)_,
during the period commencing at the Effective Time and ending on the sixth
(6th) anniversary of the Effective Time, the Surviving Corporation shall
indemnify and hold harmless each Indemnified Party from and against, and
advance expenses to each Indemnified Party in respect of, any costs, fees and
expenses (including reasonable attorneys fees and investigation expenses),
judgments, fines, losses, claims, damages, liabilities and amounts paid in
settlement in connection with any

 



      
 

 



 

claim, proceeding, investigation or inquiry, whether civil, criminal,
administrative or investigative, to the extent such claim, proceeding,
investigation or inquiry arises out of (i) any action or omission or alleged
action or omission in such Indemnified Partys capacity as a director,
officer, employee or agent of the Company or any of the Company Subsidiaries
(regardless of whether such action or omission, or alleged action or omission,
occurred prior to, at or after the Effective Time), or (ii) any of the
Transactions; _provided_ , _however_ , that if, at any time prior to the sixth
(6th) anniversary of the Effective Time, any Indemnified Party delivers to
Parent or the Surviving Corporation a written notice asserting a claim for
indemnification under this _Section 6.9(c)_, then the claim asserted in such
notice shall survive the sixth (6th) anniversary of the Effective Time until
such time as such claim is fully and finally resolved; and _provided further_
, _however_ , that no Indemnified Party shall enter into any such settlement
without the prior written consent of the Surviving Corporation (which consent
shall not be unreasonably withheld, delayed or conditioned). In the event of
any such claim, proceeding, investigation or inquiry, (A) the Surviving
Corporation shall have the right to control the defense thereof after the
Effective Time (it being understood that, by electing to control the defense
thereof, subject to the terms and conditions of this _Section 6.9(c)_, the
Surviving Corporation will be deemed to have waived any right to object to the
Indemnified Partys entitlement to indemnification hereunder with respect
thereto); (B) in the event the Indemnified Party reasonably concludes, after
consultation with his or her own counsel, that there is an actual or potential
material conflict of interest arising in connection with Parents controlling
such defense, such Indemnified Party shall be entitled to retain his or her
own counsel, whether or not the Surviving Corporation shall elect to control
the defense of any such claim, proceeding, investigation or inquiry; (C) the
Surviving Corporation shall pay the reasonable fees and expenses of such
counsel promptly after statements therefor are received, whether or not the
Surviving Corporation elects to control the defense of any such claim,
proceeding, investigation or inquiry; and (D) no Indemnified Party shall be
liable for any settlement effected without his or her prior express written
consent (which shall not be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed) if
such settlement provides for any remedy other than the payment of money
damages.

 



 

(d) The obligations of Parent and the Surviving Corporation under this
_Section 6.9_ shall survive the consummation of the Merger and shall not be
terminated or modified in such a manner as to adversely affect any Indemnified
Party to whom this _Section 6.9_ applies without the consent of such affected
Indemnified Party (it being expressly agreed that the Indemnified Parties to
whom this _Section 6.9_ applies shall be third party beneficiaries of this
_Section 6.9_, each of whom may enforce the provisions of this _Section
6.9_). The rights of the Indemnified Persons under this _Section 6.9_ shall
be in addition to, and not in substitution for, any other rights that such
individuals may have under the certificates of incorporation, bylaws or other
equivalent organizational documents, any and all indemnification agreements of
or entered into by the Company or any Company Subsidiary, or applicable law
(whether at law or in equity).

 



 

(e) If Parent or the Surviving Corporation or any of their respective
successors or assigns (i) consolidates with or merges into any other Person
and shall not be the continuing or Surviving Corporation or entity of such
consolidation or merger or (ii) transfers all or substantially all of its
properties and assets to any Person, then, and in each such case, proper

 



      
 

 



 

provision shall be made so that the successors and assigns of Parent or the
Surviving Corporation, as the case may be, shall assume all of the obligations
set forth in this _Section 6.9_.

 



 

(f) Nothing in this Agreement is intended to, shall be construed to or shall
release, waive or impair any rights to DandO Insurance claims under any policy
that is or has been in existence with respect to the Company or any of the
Company Subsidiaries for any of their respective directors, officers or other
employees, it being understood and agreed that the indemnification provided
for in this _Section 6.9_ is not prior to or in substitution for any such
claims under such policies.

 



 

Section 6.10 _Section 16 Matters_. Prior to the Effective Time, Parent,
Merger Sub and the Company shall take all such steps as may be required to
cause the transactions contemplated by _Section 2.4_ and any other
dispositions of equity securities of the Company (including derivative
securities) in connection with this Agreement by each individual who is
subject to the reporting requirements of Section 16(a) of the Exchange Act
with respect to the Company to be exempt under Rule 16b-3 under the Exchange
Act.

 



 

Section 6.11 _Directors_.

 



 

(a) Subject to applicable Law and Nasdaq rules applicable to the Company,

beneficially owns not less than a majority of the issued and outstanding
shares of Company Common Stock, Merger Sub shall be entitled to designate such
number of directors on the Company Board as will give Merger Sub
representation on the Company Board equal to at least that number of
directors, rounded up to the next whole number, that is the product of (i) the
total number of directors on the Company Board (giving effect to the directors
elected pursuant to this sentence) multiplied by (ii) the percentage that (A)
the number of shares of Company Common Stock owned by Merger Sub or any other
subsidiary of Parent bears to (B) the total number of shares of Company Common
Stock that are issued and outstanding, and the Company shall, at such time,
promptly take all necessary action **** to cause Merger Subs designees to be
so elected; _provided_ , _however_ , that in the event that Merger Subs
designees are appointed or elected to the Company Board, until the Effective
Time the Company Board shall have at least two directors who are directors on
the date of this Agreement and who are not officers of the Company or any
Company Subsidiary (the " _Independent Directors_ "); and _provided,_
_further,_ that, in such event, if the number of Independent Directors shall
be reduced below two for any reason whatsoever, the remaining Independent
Director shall be entitled to designate individuals to fill such vacancies who
shall be deemed to be Independent Directors for purposes of this Agreement or,
if no Independent Directors then remain, the other directors shall designate
two individuals to fill such vacancies who are not officers, stockholders or
affiliates of the Company, any Company Subsidiary, Parent or Merger Sub, and
such individuals shall be deemed to be Independent Directors for purposes of
this Agreement. In connection with the foregoing, the Company shall promptly,
at the option of Merger Sub, take all necessary action to either increase the
size of the Company Board or obtain the resignation of such number of its
current directors as is necessary to enable Merger Subs designees to be
elected or appointed to the Company Board as provided above. At such time, the
individuals designated by Merger Sub shall, as nearly as practicable,
constitute at least the same percentage as individuals designated by Merger
Sub of the Company

 



      
 

 



 

Board of (1) each committee of the Company Board, (2) each board of directors
of each Company Subsidiary, and (3) each committee of each such board, in each

writing any information with respect to itself, Merger Sub and their
respective nominees, officers, directors and affiliates required by Section
14(f) and Rule 14f-1, including for inclusion in the Information Statement.

 



 

(c) Following the election or appointment of Merger Subs designees pursuant
to _Section 6.11_, the approval by affirmative vote or written consent of all
of the Independent Directors then in office (or, if there shall be only one
Independent Director then in office, the Independent Director) shall be
required to authorize (and such authorization shall constitute the
authorization of the Company Board and no other action on the part of the
Company, including any action by any committee thereof or any other director
of the Company, shall, unless otherwise required by Law, be required or
permitted to authorize) (i) any amendment or termination of this Agreement by
the Company, (ii) any extension of time for performance of any obligation or
action hereunder by Parent or Merger Sub, (iii) any waiver or exercise of any
of the Companys rights under this Agreement, (iv) any amendment of the
certificate of incorporation or bylaws of the Company if such amendment would
adversely affect the holders of Shares (other than Parent and Merger Sub), or
(v) any action of the Company Board under or in connection with the Agreement
if such action would adversely affect, or would reasonably be likely to
adversely affect, the holders of Shares (other than Parent or Merger Sub).

employ any of the officers or other employees of the Company or the Company
Subsidiaries to whom Parent or Merger Sub were introduced or otherwise had
contact with or learned about in connection with the Transactions
(irrespective of whether Parent or its affiliates had knowledge or were aware
of such officers and employees prior to their consideration of the
Transactions); _provided_ , _however_ , that this _Section 6.12_ shall not
apply to any solicitation or employment resulting from (i) general
advertisements for employment not specifically targeted at officers or
employees of the Company or the Company Subsidiaries (and individuals
responding to such advertisements), (ii) unsolicited inquiries about
employment or contract opportunities or possibilities at Parent, its
Subsidiaries or controlled affiliates from recruiters or other similar agents
who have not been directed to solicit the Companys or the Company
Subsidiaries employees (and individuals responding to such inquiries) or
(iii) individuals who cease to be

 



      
 

 



 

employed by the Company or the Company Subsidiaries other than as a result of
a violation of this _Section 6.12_ by Parent.

and each of their respective former, current and future directors, officers,
employees, agents, general and limited partners, managers, members,
shareholders, Affiliates and assignees and each former, current or future
director, officer, employee, agent, shareholder, general or limited partner,

parties to comply with any obligation, covenant, agreement or condition herein

Section 9.2 _Representations and Warranties_. The representations and
warranties contained in this Agreement shall not survive the Merger.

 



 

Section 9.3 _Knowledge Qualifiers_. " _To the knowledge of the Company_ " and
similar phrases mean the actual knowledge of the individuals described in
_Section 9.3_ of the Company Disclosure Letter.

 



 

Section 9.4 _Interpretations_. Accounting terms used, but not specifically
defined, in this Agreement shall be construed in accordance with GAAP. When a
reference is made in this Agreement to Sections or Exhibits, such reference
shall be to a Section or Exhibit to this Agreement unless otherwise indicated.
The words "include," "includes" and "including" when used herein shall be
deemed in each case to be followed by the words "without limitation." Any
references in this Agreement to "the date hereof" refers to the date of
execution of this

 



      
 

 



 

Agreement. The headings contained in this Agreement are for reference purposes
only and shall not affect in any way the meaning or interpretation of this
Agreement. The parties hereto agree that they have been represented by counsel
during the negotiation, drafting, preparation and execution of this Agreement
and, therefore, waive the application of any Law or rule of construction
providing that ambiguities in an agreement or other document will be construed
against the party drafting such agreement or document. All references to this
Agreement shall be deemed to include references to the "plan of merger"
contained herein (as such term is used in the DGCL).

 



 

Section 9.5 _Governing Law; Jurisdiction; Waiver of Jury Trial_.

 



 

(a) This Agreement shall be governed by, and construed in accordance with, the
Laws of the State of Delaware regardless of the Laws that might otherwise
govern under applicable principles of conflicts of laws thereof to the extent
they would result in the application of the Laws of another jurisdiction.

 



 

(b) Each of the parties hereto hereby irrevocably and unconditionally submits,
for itself and its property, to the exclusive jurisdiction of the Delaware
Court of Chancery, or, if no such state court has proper jurisdiction, the
Federal court of the United States of America, sitting in Delaware, and any
appellate court from any thereof, in any action or proceeding arising out of
or relating to this Agreement or the agreements delivered in connection
herewith or the transactions contemplated hereby or thereby or for recognition
or enforcement of any Judgment relating thereto, and each of the parties
hereby irrevocably and unconditionally (i) agrees not to commence any such
action or proceeding except in such courts, (ii) agrees that any claim in
respect of any such action or proceeding may be heard and determined in such
Delaware Court of Chancery or, if no such state court has proper jurisdiction,
in such Federal court, (iii) waives, to the fullest extent it may legally and
effectively do so, any objection which it may now or hereafter have to the
laying of venue of any such action or proceeding in any such Delaware Court of
Chancery or Federal court, and (iv) waives, to the fullest extent permitted by
Law, the defense of an inconvenient forum to the maintenance of such action or
proceeding in any such Delaware Court of Chancery or Federal court. Each of
the parties hereto agrees that a final Judgment in any such action or
proceeding shall be conclusive and may be enforced in other jurisdictions by
suit on the Judgment or in any other manner provided by Law. Each party to
this Agreement irrevocably consents to service of process in the manner
provided for notices in _Section 9.5_. Nothing in this Agreement will affect
the right of any party to this Agreement to serve process in any other manner
permitted by Law.

 



 

(c) Each of the parties to this Agreement irrevocably waives any and all right
to trial by jury in any Legal Proceeding arising out of or relating to this
Agreement or the Transactions.

 



 

Section 9.6 _Counterparts; Facsimile Transmission of Signatures_. This
Agreement may be executed in any number of counterparts and by different
parties hereto in separate counterparts, and delivered by means of facsimile
transmission or other electronic transmission, each of which when so executed
and delivered shall be deemed to be an original and all of which when taken
together shall constitute one and the same agreement.

 



      
 

 



 

Section 9.7 _Assignment; No Third Party Beneficiaries_.

 



 

(a) This Agreement and all of the provisions hereto shall be binding upon and
inure to the benefit of, and be enforceable by, the parties hereto and their
respective successors and permitted assigns, but neither this Agreement nor
any of the rights, interests or obligations set forth herein shall be assigned
by any party hereto without the prior written consent of the other parties
hereto and any purported assignment without such consent shall be void.

 



 

(b) Nothing in this Agreement shall be construed as giving any Person, other
than the parties hereto and their heirs, successors, legal representatives and
permitted assigns, any right, remedy or claim under or in respect of this
Agreement or any provision hereof or as creating or amending any employee
benefit plan, except that from and after the Closing (i) the holders of
Options and Restricted Stock Units are intended third party beneficiaries of
the provisions of _Section 2.4_, (ii) each Indemnified Party is an intended
third party beneficiary of _Section 6.9_, and such individuals may
specifically enforce such provisions and (iii) from and after the Effective
Time, the rights of holders of shares of the Company Common Stock to receive
the Merger Consideration, as set forth in Article 2.

 



 

Section 9.8 _Severability_. If any provision of this Agreement shall be held
to be illegal, invalid or unenforceable under any applicable Law, all other
provisions of this Agreement shall nevertheless remain in full force and
effect so long as the economic or legal substance of the Offer or the Merger
is not affected in any manner adverse in any material respect to any party.
Upon such determination that any term or other provision is invalid, illegal
or incapable of being enforced, the parties hereto shall negotiate in good
faith to modify this Agreement so as to effect the original intent of the
parties as closely as possible in an acceptable manner to the end that the
Offer and the Merger are fulfilled to the extent possible then such
contravention or invalidity shall not invalidate the entire Agreement.

 



 

Section 9.9 _Entire Agreement_. This Agreement and the Confidentiality
Agreement contain all of the terms of the understandings of the parties hereto
with respect to the subject matter hereof.

 



 

Section 9.10 _Enforcement_. The parties agree that irreparable damage would
occur in the event that any of the provisions of this Agreement were not
performed in accordance with their specific terms or were otherwise breached.
It is accordingly agreed that the parties shall be entitled equitable relief
without the requirement of posting a bond or other security, including to an
injunction or injunctions to prevent breaches of this Agreement and to enforce
specifically the terms and provisions of this Agreement, this being in
addition to any other remedy to which they are entitled at law or in equity.

Agreement to be executed as of the date first written above.

 _Exhibit A_

 



 

Conditions of the Offer

 



 

Notwithstanding any other term of the Offer but subject to the terms set forth
in the Merger Agreement, Merger Sub shall not be required to accept for
payment or, subject to any applicable rules and regulations of the SEC,
including Rule 14e-l(c) under the Exchange Act (relating to Merger Subs
obligation to pay for or return tendered shares of Company Common Stock
promptly after the termination or withdrawal of the Offer) (the " _Payment
Rules_ "), to pay for any shares of Company Common Stock tendered pursuant to
the Offer and, only after complying with any obligation to extend the Offer
pursuant to the Merger Agreement, may terminate the Offer, if

 



 

(i) there shall not have been validly tendered and not properly withdrawn
prior to the expiration of the Offer that number of Shares which would
represent at least a majority of the issued and outstanding shares of Company
Common Stock on a fully diluted basis (the " _Minimum Tender Condition_ ");

 



 

(ii) any waiting period (and extension thereof) under the HSR Act or under any
other antitrust or competition Laws applicable to the purchase of shares of
Company Common Stock pursuant to the Offer shall not have expired or been
terminated or any other clearance, consent, approval, order or authorization
required by applicable antitrust or competition Laws shall not have been
obtained (the " _Antitrust Condition_ ");

 



 

(iii) any of the following conditions shall exist at the time of expiration of
the Offer or immediately prior to such payment:

 



 

(A) any Judgment issued by a court of competent jurisdiction or by a
Governmental Authority, or any Law shall be in effect that would (1) make the
Offer or the Merger illegal, (2) otherwise prevent the consummation thereof or
(3) impose any limitations on the ownership or operation by Parent (or any of
its Subsidiaries) of all or any portion of businesses or assets of Parent, the
Company or any of their respective Subsidiaries, or to compel Parent, the
Company or any of their respective Subsidiaries to dispose of or hold separate
any portion of the businesses or assets of Parent, the Company or any of their
respective Subsidiaries, other than, in the case of this clause (3), such
Divestiture Actions (as defined in the Merger Agreement) as Parent or Merger
Sub is required to accept or effect pursuant to _Section 6.3(c)_ of the
Merger Agreement;

 



 

(B) any suit, action or proceeding shall have been commenced and be pending by
any United States federal or state or foreign Governmental Authority of
competent jurisdiction wherein a Judgment would have any of the effects
referred to in paragraph (a) above;

 



 

(C) since the date of the Merger Agreement, there shall have occurred any
event, change, effect or development that, individually or in the aggregate,
has had or would reasonably be expected to have, a Company Material Adverse
Effect;

 



      
 

 



 

(D) (1) any representation and warranty of the Company set forth in _Section
3.2_, _Section 3.3(a)_ or _Section 3.3(b)_ of the Merger Agreement shall not
be true and correct in all material respects as of the date of the Merger
Agreement and as of such time, except to the extent such representation and
warranty expressly relates to an earlier time (in which case on and as of such
earlier time) or (2) any other representation and warranty of the Company set
forth in the Merger Agreement shall not be true and correct as of the date of
the Merger Agreement and as of such time, except to the extent such
representation and warranty expressly relates to an earlier time (in which
case on and as of such earlier time), other than in the case of clause (2) for
such failures to be true and correct that, individually or in the aggregate,
have not had and would not reasonably be expected to have a Company Material
Adverse Effect (it being understood that for this purpose all references to
the term "Company Material Adverse Effect" and other qualifications based on
the word "material," except for the reference to the term "Company Material
Adverse Effect" in _Section 3.6_ shall be disregarded);

 



 

(E) the Company shall have failed to perform in any material respect any
obligation or to comply in any material respect with any agreement or covenant
of the Company to be performed or complied with by it under the Merger
Agreement prior to such time;

 



 

(F) the Company fails to deliver to Parent a certificate signed by a senior
executive officer of the Company dated the date on the which the Offer expires
certifying that the conditions specified in clauses (D) and (E) of this
paragraph (iii) do not exist; or

 



 

(G) the Merger Agreement shall have been terminated in accordance with its
terms;

 



 

which, in the sole and reasonable judgment of Merger Sub or Parent, in any
such case, makes it inadvisable to proceed with such acceptance for payment or
payment.

 



 

The foregoing conditions are for the sole benefit of Parent and Merger Sub and
may be waived by Parent or Merger Sub (except for the Minimum Tender
Condition) in whole or in part at any time and from time to time and in the
sole discretion of Parent or Merger Sub, subject in each case to the terms of
the Merger Agreement and applicable Law. Any reference in this Annex I or in
the Merger Agreement to a condition or requirement being satisfied shall be
deemed met if such condition or requirement is so waived. The foregoing
conditions shall be in addition to, and not a limitation of, the rights of
Parent and Merger Sub to extend, terminate and/or modify the Offer pursuant to
the terms and conditions of the Merger Agreement. The failure by Parent,
Merger Sub or any other affiliate of Parent at any time to exercise any of the
foregoing rights shall not be deemed a waiver of any such right, the waiver of
any such right with respect to particular facts and circumstances shall not be
deemed a waiver with respect to any other facts and circumstances and each
such right shall be deemed an ongoing right that may be asserted at any time
and from time to time.

 



      
 

 



 

Capitalized terms used in this Exhibit A but not defined herein shall have the
meanings set forth in the Agreement to which it is attached, except that the
term " _Merger Agreement_ " shall be deemed to refer to the Agreement to which
this Exhibit A is attached.

 



      
 

 

 _Exhibit B_

 



 

AMENDED AND RESTATED

 



 

CERTIFICATE OF INCORPORATION

 



 

OF

 



 

MARTEK BIOSCIENCES CORPORATION

 



 

FIRST: The name of the corporation shall be Martek Biosciences Corporation
(hereinafter referred to as the "Corporation").

 



 

SECOND: The Corporations registered office in the State of Delaware is
located at 1209 Orange Street, in the City of Wilmington, County of New
Castle, and its registered agent at such address is The Corporation Trust
Company.

 



 

THIRD: The purpose or purposes of the corporation shall be to engage in any
lawful act or activity for which corporations may be organized under the
General Corporation Law of Delaware.

 



 

FOURTH: The total number of shares of stock which this corporation is
authorized to issue is 100 shares, par value $0.01 per share.

 



 

FIFTH: The Corporation is to have perpetual existence.

 



 

SIXTH: The following provisions are inserted for the management of the
business and for the conduct of the affairs of the Corporation, and for
further definition, limitation and regulation of the powers of the Corporation
and of its directors and stockholders:

 



 

(1) The number of directors of the Corporation shall be such as from time to
time shall be fixed by, or in the manner provided in, the by-laws. Election of
directors need not be by ballot unless the by-laws so provide.

 



 

(2) The Board of Directors shall have powers without the assent or vote of the
stockholders to make, alter, amend, change, add to or repeal the by-laws of
the Corporation; to fix and vary the amount to be reserved for any proper
purpose; to determine the use and disposition of any surplus or net profits;
and to fix the times for the declaration and payment of dividends.

 



 

(3) In addition to the powers and authorities hereinbefore or by statute
expressly conferred upon them, the directors are hereby empowered to exercise
all such powers and do all such acts and things as may be exercised or done by
the Corporation; subject, nevertheless, to the provisions of the statutes of
Delaware, of this certificate, and to any by-laws from time to time made by
the stockholders; provided, however, that no by-laws so made shall invalidate
any prior act of the directors which would have been valid if such by-law had
not been made.

 



 

SEVENTH: The Corporation shall indemnify to the full extent authorized or
permitted by law any person made, or threatened to be made, a party to any
action or proceeding (whether civil or criminal or otherwise) by reason of the
fact that he, his testator or intestate, is or was a director

 



      
 

 



 

or officer of the Corporation or by reason of the fact that such director or
officer, at the request of the Corporation, is or was serving any other
corporation, partnership, joint venture, trust, employee benefit plan or other
enterprise, in any capacity. Nothing contained herein shall affect any rights
to indemnification to which employees other than directors and officers may be
entitled by law. No director of the Corporation shall be personally liable to
the Corporation or its stockholders for monetary damages for any breach of
fiduciary duty by such a director as a director. Notwithstanding the foregoing
sentence, a director shall be liable to the extent provided by applicable law
(i) for any breach of the directors duty of loyalty to the Corporation or its
stockholders, (ii) for acts or omissions not in good faith or which involve
intentional misconduct or a knowing violation of law, (iii) pursuant to
Section 174 of the General Corporation Law of Delaware, or (iv) for any
transaction from which such director derived an improper personal benefit. No
amendment to or repeal of this Article SEVENTH shall apply to or have any
effect on the liability or alleged liability of any director of the
Corporation for or with respect to any acts or omissions of such director
occurring prior to such amendment.

 



 

EIGHTH: Whenever a compromise or arrangement is proposed between the
Corporation and its creditors or any class of them and/or between the
Corporation and its stockholders or any class of them, any court of equitable
jurisdiction within the State of Delaware, may, on the application in a
summary way of the Corporation or of any creditor or stockholder thereof or on
the application of any receiver or receivers appointed for the Corporation
under the provisions of Section 291 of the General Corporation Law of Delaware
or on the application of trustees in dissolution or of any receiver or
receivers appointed for the Corporation under the provisions of Section 279 of
the General Corporation Law of Delaware order a meeting of the creditors or
class of creditors, and/or of the stockholders or class of stockholders of the
Corporation, as the case may be, to be summoned in such manner as the said
court directs. If a majority in number representing three-fourths in value of
the creditors or class of creditors, and/or of the stockholders or class of
stockholders of the Corporation, as the case may be, agree to any compromise
or arrangement and to any reorganization of the Corporation as consequence of
such compromise or arrangement, the said compromise or arrangement and the
said reorganization shall, if sanctioned by the court to which the said
application has been made, be binding on all the creditors or class of
creditors, and/or on all the stockholders or class of stockholders, of the
Corporation, as the case may be, and also on the Corporation.

 



 

NINTH: The Corporation reserves the right to amend, alter, change or repeal
any provision contained in this certificate of incorporation in the manner now
or hereafter prescribed by law, and all rights and powers conferred herein on
stockholders, directors and officers are subject to this reserved power.
