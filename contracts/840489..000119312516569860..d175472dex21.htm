ARTICLE 3

EFFECTS OF THE MERGER

Section 3.1 _Effects of the Merger._

 

(a) _The Merger_. At the Effective Time and by virtue of the Merger and
without any further action on the part of Frontier, Cowboy or Merger Sub or
the holders of any shares of Cowboy common stock, par value $0.10 per share
(the " _Cowboy Common Stock_ "):

 

(i) Each share of Cowboy Common Stock, if any, then held by Cowboy or any
Wholly Owned Cowboy Subsidiary or held in Cowboys treasury (which, for the
avoidance of doubt, shall not include shares of Cowboy Common Stock held in
any Cowboy Equity Incentive Plan or in any related trust accounts (including
any shares of Cowboy Common Stock held in a rabbi trust) or otherwise held in
a fiduciary or agency capacity) shall automatically be retired and shall
cease to exist, and no consideration shall be paid, nor shall any other
payment or right inure or be made with respect thereto in connection with or
as a consequence of the Merger;

(ii) Each share of Cowboy Common Stock, if any, then held by Frontier or any
Wholly Owned Frontier Subsidiary shall no longer be outstanding and shall
automatically be retired and shall cease to exist, and no consideration shall
be paid, nor shall any other payment or right inure or be made with respect
thereto in connection with or as a consequence of the Merger;

 

(iii) Except as provided in _Section 3.1(a)(i)_ and _Section 3.1(a)(ii)_ and
subject to _Sections 3.1(b)_ and  _3.1(d)_ , each share of Cowboy Common
Stock issued and outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time will be
automatically cancelled and retired and converted into the right to receive
(upon the proper surrender of the certificate representing such share ("
_Certificate_ ") or, in the case of a Book-Entry Share, the proper surrender
of such Book-Entry Share) that number of validly issued, fully paid and
nonassessable shares of common stock, $0.01 par value per share, of Frontier
(" _Frontier Common Stock_ ") equal to the Exchange Ratio. For purposes of
this Agreement, " _Exchange Ratio_ " means 0.840. As of the Effective Time,
each holder of a Certificate or Book-Entry Share that immediately prior to
the Effective Time represented shares of Cowboy Common Stock shall cease to
have any rights with respect thereto other than the right to receive (A)
shares of Frontier Common Stock to be issued in consideration therefore upon
the surrender of such Certificate or Book-Entry Share and (B) any cash,
without interest, to be paid in lieu of any fractional share interests of
Frontier Common Stock in accordance with _Section 3.1(d)_ (the "
_Merger Consideration_ ");

(iv) The membership interests of Merger Sub issued and outstanding immediately
prior to the Effective Time shall remain the issued and outstanding
membership interests of the Surviving Entity and shall be unaffected by the
Merger; and

 



14 (v) At the Effective Time, each share of Frontier Common Stock issued and
outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time shall remain issued and
outstanding. Immediately following the Effective Time, shares of Frontier
Common Stock owned by Surviving Entity or any wholly-owned Subsidiary of
Surviving Entity shall be surrendered to Frontier without payment therefor.

(b) _Adjustment of the Exchange Ratio_. Between the date of this Agreement and
the Effective Time, if any of Cowboy or Frontier should split, combine or
otherwise reclassify either the Cowboy Common Stock or the Frontier Common
Stock or makes a dividend or other distribution in shares of the Cowboy Common
Stock or the Frontier Common Stock (including any dividend or other
distribution of securities convertible into Cowboy Common Stock or Frontier
Common Stock), or engages in a reorganization, recapitalization or exchange or
other like change, then (without limiting any other rights of the Parties
hereunder), the Exchange Ratio shall be ratably adjusted to reflect fully the
effect of any such split, combination, reclassification, dividend,
distribution, reorganization, exchange or change, and thereafter all
references to the Exchange Ratio shall be deemed to be the Exchange Ratio as
so adjusted.

(c) _Transfer Books_. From and after the Effective Time, the share transfer
books of Cowboy shall be closed, and thereafter there shall be no further
registration of transfers of Cowboy Common Stock. From and after the Effective
Time, Persons who held Cowboy Common Stock immediately prior to the
Effective Time shall cease to have rights with respect to such shares, except
as otherwise provided for in this Agreement or by applicable Law. On or after
the Effective Time, any Certificates or Book-Entry Shares of Cowboy Common
Stock presented to the Exchange Agent, Frontier or the Surviving Entity shall
be exchanged for the Merger Consideration with respect to Cowboy Common Stock
formerly represented thereby.

 

(d) _No Fractional Shares_. No certificates representing fractional shares of
Frontier Common Stock shall be issued upon the surrender for exchange of
Certificates or Book-Entry Shares of Cowboy Common Stock, and such fractional
share interests shall not entitle the owner thereof to vote or to any other
rights of a stockholder of Frontier. Notwithstanding any other provision
of this Agreement, each holder of shares of Cowboy Common Stock converted
pursuant to the Merger who would otherwise have been entitled to receive a
fraction of a share of Frontier Common Stock (after taking into account all
Certificates and Book-Entry Shares of Cowboy Common Stock delivered by such
holder) shall receive, in lieu thereof, cash (without interest) in an amount
rounded to the nearest whole cent, determined by multiplying (i) the per share
Nasdaq Official Closing Price of the Frontier Common Stock (as reported on
www.nasdaq.com) on the date immediately preceding the date on which the
Effective Time shall occur (or, if the Frontier Common Stock did not trade on
the NASDAQ on such prior date, the last day of trading in Frontier Common
Stock on the NASDAQ prior to the Effective Time) by (ii) the fraction of a
share of Frontier Common Stock to which such holder would otherwise be
entitled.

 

Section 3.2 _Exchange Procedures; Exchange Agent; Distributions with Respect
to Unexchanged Shares._

 

(a) As soon as practicable prior to the Effective Time (but in no event later
than three (3) Business Days prior to the mailing date of the Joint Proxy
Statement), Frontier will designate a nationally recognized bank, trust
company or stockholder services company reasonably acceptable to Cowboy to act
as exchange agent (the " _Exchange Agent_ ") for the payment and delivery of
the Merger Consideration, as provided in _Section 3.1(a)(iii)_ and _Section
3.1(d)_. Prior to the Effective Time, Frontier will enter into an exchange
agent agreement with the Exchange Agent, in a form reasonably acceptable to
Cowboy (the " _Exchange Agent Agreement_ "), setting forth the procedures to
be used in accomplishing the deliveries and other actions contemplated by this
_Section 3.2_.

 

(b) Prior to the Effective Time, Frontier shall deposit in trust, for the sole
benefit of the holders of shares of Cowboy Common Stock, with the Exchange
Agent certificates or Book-Entry Shares representing shares of Frontier Common
Stock to be issued pursuant to _Section 3.1(a)(iii)_ in exchange for the
shares of Cowboy Common Stock. After the Effective Time on the
appropriate payment date, if applicable, Frontier shall provide or shall
cause to be provided to the Exchange Agent any dividends or other
distributions payable on such

 



15  shares of Frontier Common Stock pursuant to _Section 3.2(e)_. Frontier
shall deposit with the Exchange Agent, for addition to the Exchange Fund, from
time to time as needed, cash sufficient to pay cash in lieu of fractional
shares in accordance with _Section 3.1(d)_. Such shares of Frontier Common
Stock, together with any cash in lieu of fractional shares pursuant to
_Section 3.1(d)_ and dividends or distributions with respect thereto
pursuant to _Section 3.2(e)_, are referred to herein as the " _Exchange Fund_
". Frontier shall cause the Exchange Agent to make, and the Exchange Agent
shall make delivery of, the Merger Consideration out of the Exchange Fund in
accordance with this Agreement. The Exchange Fund shall not be used for any
other purpose.

(c) As soon as reasonably practicable after the Effective Time (but in no
event later than two (2) Business Days thereafter), Frontier shall cause the
Exchange Agent to mail to each holder of record of a Certificate or Book-Entry
Share representing shares of Cowboy Common Stock (i) a letter of transmittal
(a " _Letter of Transmittal_ ") in customary form as prepared by Frontier and
reasonably acceptable to Cowboy (which shall specify, among other things, that
delivery shall be effected, and risk of loss and title to the Certificates or
Book-Entry Shares, as applicable, shall pass, only upon proper delivery of the
Certificates or transfer of any Book-Entry Shares to the Exchange Agent) and
(ii) instructions for use in effecting the surrender of the Certificates or
the transfer of Book-Entry Shares in exchange for the Merger Consideration
into which the number of shares of Cowboy Common Stock previously represented
by such Certificate or Book-Entry Share shall have been converted pursuant to
this Agreement.

(d) Upon surrender of a Certificate or transfer of any Book-Entry Share
representing shares of Cowboy Common Stock to the Exchange Agent, together
with a properly completed and validly executed Letter of Transmittal or
receipt of an "agents message" by the Exchange Agent (or such other evidence,
if any, of transfer as the Exchange Agent may reasonably request) in the case
of transfer of a Book-Entry Share, and such other documents as may reasonably
be required by the Exchange Agent, the holder of such Certificate or Book-
Entry Share representing shares of Cowboy Common Stock shall be entitled to
receive in exchange therefor (i) the number of whole shares of Frontier Common
Stock into which the Cowboy Common Stock represented by the surrendered
Certificate or Book-Entry Share shall have been converted at the Effective
Time, (ii) cash in lieu of any fractional share interest of Frontier Common
Stock in accordance with _Section 3.1(d)_ and (iii) certain dividends and
distributions in accordance with  _Section 3.2(e)_, if any, after the
Exchange Agents receipt of such Certificate or "agents message" or other
evidence, and the Certificate so surrendered or the Book-Entry Share so
transferred, as applicable, shall be forthwith cancelled. The Exchange Agent
shall accept such Certificates and Book-Entry Shares upon compliance with such
reasonable terms and conditions as the Exchange Agent may impose to effect an
orderly exchange thereof in accordance with customary exchange practices.
Until surrendered or transferred as contemplated by this _Section 3.2_, each
Certificate or Book-Entry Share representing shares of Cowboy Common Stock
shall be deemed, at any time after the Effective Time to represent only the
right to receive, upon such surrender, the Merger Consideration as
contemplated by this _Article 3_. No interest shall be paid or accrued for the
benefit of holders of the Certificates or Book-Entry Shares on the
Merger Consideration payable upon the surrender of the Certificates or Book-
Entry Shares.

(e) No dividends or other distributions declared or made prior to or after
the Effective Time with respect to Frontier Common Stock with a record date
after the Effective Time shall be paid to any holder entitled by reason of the
Merger to receive shares of Frontier Common Stock until, and no cash payment
in lieu of a fractional share interest of Frontier Common Stock shall be paid
to any such holder pursuant to _Section 3.1(d)_ until, such holder shall have
surrendered its Certificates or Book-Entry Share of Cowboy Common
Stock pursuant to this _Section 3.2_. Subject to applicable Law, following
surrender of any such Certificate or Book-Entry Shares of Cowboy Common Stock,
such holder shall be paid, in each case, without interest, (i) the amount of
any dividends or other distributions theretofore paid with respect to the
shares of Frontier Common Stock represented by the Certificate or Book-Entry
Shares of Cowboy Common Stock surrendered by such holder and having a record
date on or after the Effective Time and a payment date prior to such
surrender and (ii) at the appropriate payment date or as promptly as
practicable thereafter, the amount of any dividends or other distributions
payable with respect to such shares of Frontier Common Stock and having a
record date on or after the Effective Time but prior to such surrender and a
payment date on or after such surrender.

 



16 (f) In the event of a transfer of ownership of shares of Cowboy Common Stock
that is not registered in the transfer records of Cowboy, it shall be a
condition of payment that any Certificate or Book-Entry Share surrendered or
transferred in accordance with the procedures set forth in this _Section 3.2_
shall be properly endorsed or shall be otherwise in proper form for transfer,
and that the Person requesting such payment shall have paid any Taxes required
by reason of the payment of the Merger Consideration to a Person other than
the registered holder of the Certificate surrendered, or Book-Entry Share
transferred, or shall have established to the reasonable satisfaction of
Frontier that such Tax either has been paid or is not applicable.

 

(g) Any portion of the Exchange Fund that remains undistributed to the holders
of Cowboy Common Stock for twelve (12) months after the Effective Time shall
be delivered to Frontier upon demand, and any former holders of Cowboy Common
Stock prior to the Merger who have not theretofore complied with this _Article
3_ shall thereafter look only to Frontier for payment of their claims with
respect thereto.

(h) None of Cowboy, Frontier, the Surviving Entity, the Exchange Agent, or any
employee, officer, director, agent or Affiliate of such entities, shall be
liable to any Person in respect of the Merger Consideration if the Exchange
Fund (or the appropriate portion thereof) has been delivered to a public
official pursuant to any applicable abandoned property, escheat or similar
Law. Any amounts remaining unclaimed by holders of any shares of Cowboy Common
Stock immediately prior to the time at which such amounts would otherwise
escheat to, or become property of, any Governmental Authority shall, to the
extent permitted by applicable Law, become the property of Frontier free and
clear of any claims or interest of such holders or their successors, assigns
or personal representatives previously entitled thereto.

 

Section 3.3 _Cowboy Stock-Based Awards._

 

(a) As of the Effective Time, each restricted stock unit award and deferred
stock unit award granted under a Cowboy Equity Incentive Plan (a " _Cowboy
RSU_ ") that is outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time, whether
vested or unvested, shall be cancelled as of the Effective Time and converted
into the right to receive, in the sole discretion of Frontier as designated
in a written notice delivered by Frontier to Cowboy reasonably prior to the
Effective Time, either (i) a cash payment equal to the product of (A) the
number of shares of Cowboy Common Stock underlying such Cowboy RSU
multiplied by the Exchange Ratio, multiplied by (B) the closing per share
price of the Frontier Common Stock on the NASDAQ on the last day on which
shares of Frontier Common Stock traded on the NASDAQ immediately preceding the

withhold from the Merger Consideration and any other amounts otherwise payable
pursuant to this Agreement to any holder of Cowboy Common Stock, such amounts
as it is required to deduct and withhold with respect to such payments under
the Code or any other provision of applicable Law. Any such amounts so
deducted and withheld shall be paid over to the applicable Governmental
Authority in accordance with applicable Law and shall be treated for all
purposes of this Agreement as having been paid to the Person in respect of
which such deduction and withholding was made.

 

Section 3.5 _Lost Certificates._ If any Certificate shall have been lost,
stolen or destroyed, then upon the making of an affidavit of that fact by the

and reports filed with the SEC since January 1, 2013, including any amendments
thereto, the " _Historic Frontier SEC Documents_ "). As of their respective
filing dates (or the date of their most recent amendment, supplement or

contain any untrue statement of a material fact or omit to state a material
fact required to be stated therein or necessary to make the statements made

of Frontier, the subject of ongoing SEC review and Frontier does not have any
outstanding and unresolved comments from the SEC with respect to any Historic
Frontier SEC Documents. None of the Historic Frontier SEC Documents is the
subject of any confidential treatment request by Frontier.

(b) Frontier has made available to Cowboy complete and correct copies of all
written correspondence between the SEC, on the one hand, and Frontier, on the
other hand, since January 1, 2013 that is not publicly available on the SEC

respects with the applicable provisions of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 and
the rules and regulations thereunder, as amended from time to time (the "
_Sarbanes-Oxley Act_ ").

 

(c) The consolidated audited and unaudited financial statements of Frontier

(d) Frontier has designed and maintained disclosure controls and procedures
(as defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) under the Exchange Act) to
ensure that material information required to be disclosed by Frontier in the
reports that it files or submits under the Exchange Act is recorded,
processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in the
SECs rules and forms and is accumulated and communicated to Frontiers
management as appropriate to allow timely decisions regarding required
disclosure, and to the Knowledge of Frontier, such disclosure controls and
procedures are effective in timely alerting Frontiers management to material
information required to be included in Frontiers periodic reports required
under the Exchange Act (if Frontier were required to file such reports).
Frontier and the Frontier Subsidiaries have designed and maintained a system
of internal control over financial reporting (as defined in Rule 13a-15(f) and
15d-15(f) under the Exchange Act) sufficient to provide reasonable assurances
(i) regarding the reliability of 

 



22  financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements in
accordance with GAAP, (ii) that transactions are executed in accordance with
managements general or specific authorizations, (iii) that transactions are
recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements and to
maintain asset accountability, (iv) that access to assets is permitted only in
accordance with managements general or specific authorization, (v) that the
recorded accountability for assets is compared with the existing assets at
reasonable intervals and appropriate action is taken with respect to any
differences and (vi) accounts, notes and other receivables and inventory are
recorded accurately, and proper and adequate procedures are implemented to
effect the collection thereof on a current and timely basis. Frontier has
disclosed to Frontiers auditors and audit committee (and made summaries of
such disclosures available to Cowboy) (A) any significant deficiencies and
material weaknesses in the design or operation of internal control over
financial reporting which are reasonably likely to adversely affect in any
material respect Frontiers ability to record, process, summarize and report
financial information and (B) any fraud, to the Knowledge of Frontier, whether
or not material, that involves management or other employees who have a
significant role in internal control over financial reporting. There are no
internal investigations by Frontier personnel or, to the Knowledge of

Frontier or any Frontier Subsidiary is a party pending or, to the Knowledge
of Frontier, threatened, in each case regarding any accounting practices of
Frontier.

to become a party to, any joint venture, off-balance sheet partnership or any
similar Contract, including any Contract relating to any transaction or
relationship between or among Frontier and any Frontier Subsidiary, on the one
hand, and any unconsolidated Affiliate of Frontier or any Frontier Subsidiary,
including any structured finance, special purpose or limited purpose entity
or Person, on the other hand, or any "off-balance sheet arrangements" (as
defined in Item 303(a) of Regulation S-K of the SEC), where the result,
purpose or effect of such Contract is to avoid disclosure of any material
transaction involving, or material liabilities of, Frontier, any Frontier
Subsidiary or Frontiers or Frontier Subsidiarys audited financial statements
or other Historic Frontier SEC Documents.

(f) None of Frontier or any Frontier Subsidiary is required to be registered

has engaged in a nonexempt "prohibited transaction" (described in Section
4975 of the Code or Section 406 of ERISA) that would subject Frontier or any
Frontier Subsidiary to a material tax on prohibited transactions imposed by
Section 502(i) of ERISA or Section 4975 of the Code. 

(h) Frontier has never, and no ERISA Affiliate of Frontier has ever,
maintained or been obligated to contribute to (i) an employee benefit plan
that is subject to Title IV or Section 302 of ERISA or Section 412 or 4971 of
the Code, (ii) a "multiemployer plan" within the meaning of Section 3(37) or
Section 9001(a)(3) of ERISA, (iii) a "multiple employer plan" within the
meaning of Code Section 413(c), or (iv) a multiple employer welfare
arrangement as defined in ERISA Section 3(40). Frontier and its ERISA
Affiliates have not incurred, and there are no circumstances under which
either could reasonably be expected to incur, any liability under Title IV of
ERISA or Section 412 of the Code.

 

(i) Neither the execution of this Agreement nor the consummation of the
transactions contemplated hereby will result, separately or in the aggregate,
in the payment, acceleration, vesting or enhancement of any compensation or
benefits, including the payment of any "excess parachute payments" within the
meaning of Section 280G of the Code.

 

(j) With respect to each Frontier Benefit Plan that is not subject to U.S. Law
(each, a " _Frontier Foreign Benefit Plan_ ") established primarily for the
benefit of employees of Frontier or any Frontier Subsidiary residing outside
the United States and except as, individually or in the aggregate, would not
reasonably be expected to have a Frontier Material Adverse Effect, (i) each
such Frontier Foreign Benefit Plan has been established, maintained and
administered in compliance with its terms and applicable Laws, and if intended
to qualify for

 



28  special tax treatment, meets all requirements for such treatment, (ii) all
employer and employee contributions to each Frontier Foreign Benefit Plan
required by its terms or by applicable Law have been made or, if applicable,
accrued in accordance with generally accepted accounting practices in the
applicable jurisdiction applied to such matters, and (iii) the fair market
value of the assets of each funded Frontier Foreign Benefit Plan, the
liability of each insurer for any Frontier Foreign Benefit Plan funded through
insurance or the book reserve established for any Frontier Foreign Benefit
Plan, together with any accrued contributions, is sufficient to procure
or provide for the accrued benefit obligations, as of the date of this
Agreement, with respect to all current and former participants in such plan
according to the actuarial assumptions and valuations most recently used to
determine employer contributions to such Frontier Foreign Benefit Plan, and
no transactions contemplated by this Agreement shall cause such assets or
insurance obligations to be less than such benefit obligations. To the
Knowledge of Frontier, each Frontier Foreign Benefit Plan required to be
registered has been registered and has been maintained in all material
respects in good standing with applicable regulatory authorities.

taken as a whole, or (ii) materially delay or prevent the consummation of the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement.

Knowledge of Frontier, no person has gained unauthorized access to any Covered
Personal Information held by Frontier or any Frontier Subsidiary or otherwise
held or processed on their behalf, which has resulted in the misappropriation
of such Covered Personal Information. The consummation of the transactions
contemplated hereby, including any transfer of Covered Personal Information
resulting from such transactions, will not materially violate any Privacy
Obligation as it currently exists or as it existed at any time during which
any of such Covered Personal Information was collected or obtained. Frontier
and the Frontier Subsidiaries have not been notified in writing of and, to the
Knowledge of Frontier, are not the subject of any Action related to data

summarized and reported within the time periods specified in the SECs rules
and forms and is accumulated and

 



40  communicated to Cowboys management as appropriate to allow timely decisions
regarding required disclosure, and to the Knowledge of Cowboy, such disclosure
controls and procedures are effective in timely alerting Cowboys management
to material information required to be included in Cowboys periodic reports
required under the Exchange Act (if Cowboy were required to file such
reports). Cowboy and the Cowboy Subsidiaries have designed and maintained a
system of internal control over financial reporting (as defined in Rule

reasonable assurances (i) regarding the reliability of financial reporting
and the preparation of financial statements in accordance with GAAP, (ii) that

authorizations, (iii) that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit
preparation of financial statements and to maintain asset accountability, (iv)
that access to assets is permitted only in accordance with managements
general or specific authorization, (v) that the recorded accountability for
assets is compared with the existing assets at reasonable intervals and
appropriate action is taken with respect to any differences and (vi) accounts,
notes and other receivables and inventory are recorded accurately, and proper
and adequate procedures are implemented to effect the collection thereof on a
current and timely basis. Cowboy has disclosed to Cowboys auditors and audit
committee (and made summaries of such disclosures available to Frontier) (A)
any significant deficiencies and material weaknesses in the design or
operation of internal control over financial reporting which are reasonably
likely to adversely affect in any material respect Cowboys ability to record,
process, summarize and report financial information and (B) any fraud, to the
Knowledge of Cowboy, whether or not material, that involves management or
other employees who have a significant role in internal control over financial
reporting. There are no internal investigations by Cowboy personnel or, to

investigations to which Cowboy or any Cowboy Subsidiary is a party pending or,
to the Knowledge of Cowboy, threatened, in each case regarding any accounting
practices of Cowboy.

(e) Cowboy is not, and none of the Cowboy Subsidiaries are, a party to, and

become a party to, any joint venture, off-balance sheet partnership or any
similar Contract, including any Contract relating to any transaction or
relationship between or among Cowboy and any Cowboy Subsidiary, on the one
hand, and any unconsolidated Affiliate of Cowboy or any Cowboy Subsidiary,
including any structured finance, special purpose or limited purpose entity or
Person, on the other hand, or any "off-balance sheet arrangements" (as defined
in Item 303(a) of Regulation S-K of the SEC), where the result, purpose or
effect of such Contract is to avoid disclosure of any material
transaction involving, or material liabilities of, Cowboy, any Cowboy
Subsidiary or Cowboys or Cowboy Subsidiarys audited financial statements or
other Historic Cowboy SEC Documents.

 

(f) None of Cowboy or any Cowboy Subsidiary is required to be registered as an

and all such Cowboy Permits are valid and in full force and effect, except
where the failure to be in possession of, or the failure to be valid or in

Effect. To the Knowledge of Cowboy, no event has occurred with respect to any

material impairment of the rights of the holder of any such Cowboy Permits,

reasonably be expected to have a Cowboy Material Adverse Effect. To the
Knowledge of Cowboy, there is not pending or threatened any Action, petition,
objection, inquiry, investigation or other pleading with any Governmental
Authority having jurisdiction or authority over the operations of Cowboy or

Section 5.12 _Benefit Plans._

obligation or liability for the benefit of any current or former director,
officer, independent contractor, or employee of Cowboy or any Cowboy
Subsidiary or any spouse, dependent, or beneficiary thereof (collectively, the
" _Cowboy Benefit Plans_ "). None of the Cowboy Benefit Plans are established
primarily for the benefit of employees of Cowboy or any Cowboy Subsidiary
residing outside the United States. Cowboy has made available to Frontier a
true and complete copy of (i) each Cowboy Benefit Plan (or, in the case of
any unwritten Cowboy Benefit Plans, a description thereof), (ii) the three
most recent annual reports on Form 5500 (including all schedules and
attachments thereto) filed with respect to each Cowboy Benefit Plan (if any

all applicable requirements of ERISA, the Code, and other applicable Laws, and
have been administered, in all material

 



45  respects, in accordance with their terms and such laws, except as,
individually or in the aggregate, would not reasonably be expected to have a
Cowboy Material Adverse Effect. Each Cowboy Benefit Plan that is intended to
be qualified within the meaning of Section 401 of the Code has received a
favorable IRS determination letter or is maintained under a prototype or
volume submitter document and entitled to rely on a favorable opinion
or advisory letter that it is qualified under Section 401(a) of the Code ("

Knowledge of Cowboy, no circumstances exist and no events have occurred that
could reasonably be expected to adversely affect the qualified status of any
Cowboy Qualified Benefit Plan.

documentary compliance with Section 409A of the Code and all IRS guidance
promulgated thereunder, to the extent such section and such guidance have been
applicable to such Cowboy Benefit Plan. No Cowboy Benefit Plan, agreement,
Contract or other arrangement to which Cowboy or, to the Knowledge of Cowboy,
any Cowboy Subsidiary is a party or by which any of them is otherwise bound
obligates Cowboy to compensate or reimburse any Person in respect of taxes
pursuant to Section 409A or 4999 of the Code. Neither Cowboy nor any
Cowboy Subsidiary (i) has been required to report to any Governmental
Authority any correction made or taxes due as a result of a failure to comply
with Section 409A of the Code or (ii) has any indemnity or gross-up obligation
for any taxes, interest, or other amounts imposed or accelerated under
Section 409A of the Code.

(f) Neither Cowboy nor any Cowboy Subsidiary provides any medical, disability
or life insurance benefits under any Cowboy Benefit Plan after termination of
employment other than as required under Section 4980B of the Code or similar
law.

 

(g) Neither Cowboy nor any Cowboy Subsidiary of a Cowboy Benefit Plan has
engaged in a nonexempt "prohibited transaction" (described in Section 4975 of

Subsidiary to a material tax on prohibited transactions imposed by Section
502(i) of ERISA or Section 4975 of the Code.

 

(h) Cowboy has never, and no ERISA Affiliate of Cowboy has ever, maintained or

to Title IV or Section 302 of ERISA or Section 412 or 4971 of the Code, (ii) a
"multiemployer plan" within the meaning of Section 3(37) or Section 9001(a)(3)
of ERISA, (iii) a "multiple employer plan" within the meaning of Code Section
413(c), or (iv) a multiple employer welfare arrangement as defined in ERISA
Section 3(40). Cowboy and its ERISA Affiliates have not incurred, and there
are no circumstances under which either could reasonably be expected to
incur, any liability under Title IV of ERISA or Section 412 of the Code.

 

(i) Neither the execution of this Agreement nor the consummation of the
transactions contemplated hereby will result, separately or in the aggregate,
in the payment, acceleration, vesting or enhancement of any compensation or
benefits, including the payment of any "excess parachute payments" within the
meaning of Section 280G of the Code.

delay or prevent the consummation of the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement.

of the date hereof is referred to herein as a " _Cowboy Material Contract_."

 

(c) Except as, individually or in the aggregate, would not reasonably be
expected to have a Cowboy Material Adverse Effect, each Cowboy Material
Contract is legal, valid, binding and enforceable on Cowboy and each Cowboy
Subsidiary that is a party thereto and, to the Knowledge of Cowboy, each other
party thereto, and is in full force and effect, except as may be limited
by bankruptcy, insolvency, reorganization, moratorium or other similar Laws
affecting creditors rights generally and by general principles of equity
(regardless of whether enforceability is considered in a proceeding in equity
or at Law). Except as, individually or in the aggregate, would not reasonably
be expected to have a Cowboy Material Adverse Effect, Cowboy and each Cowboy
Subsidiary has performed all obligations required to be performed by it prior
to the date hereof under each Cowboy Material Contract and, to the Knowledge
of Cowboy, each other party thereto has performed all obligations required to
be performed by it under such Cowboy Material Contract prior to the date
hereof. None of Cowboy or any Cowboy Subsidiary, nor, to the Knowledge of
Cowboy, any other party thereto, is in breach or violation of, or default
under, any Cowboy Material Contract, and no event has occurred that, with
notice or lapse of time or both, would constitute a violation, breach
or default under any Cowboy Material Contract, except where in each case such
breach, violation or default, individually or in the aggregate, would not
reasonably be expected to have a Cowboy Material Adverse Effect. None of
Cowboy or any Cowboy Subsidiary has received notice of any violation or
default under any Cowboy Material Contract, except for violations or defaults
that, individually or in the aggregate, would not reasonably be expected to
have a Cowboy Material Adverse Effect. Since December 31, 2015 and as of the
date hereof, neither Cowboy nor any Cowboy Subsidiary has received any written
notice of the intention of any party to cancel, terminate, materially change
the scope of rights under or fail to renew any Cowboy Material Contract.

Section 5.18 _Insurance._ Except as, individually or in the aggregate, would
not reasonably be expected to have a Cowboy Material Adverse Effect, all
premiums due and payable under all material insurance policies (including
policies providing casualty, liability, and workers compensation coverage) and
all material fidelity bonds or other material insurance Contracts providing
coverage for Cowboy and the Cowboy Subsidiaries (the " _Cowboy Insurance
Policies_ ") have been paid, and Cowboy and the Cowboy Subsidiaries have
otherwise complied in all material respects with the terms and conditions of
all Cowboy Insurance Policies. No written notice of cancellation or
termination has been received by Cowboy or any Cowboy Subsidiary with respect
to any such policy which has not been replaced on substantially similar terms
prior to the date of such cancellation. Except as, individually or in the
aggregate, would not reasonably be expected to have a Cowboy Material Adverse
Effect, each of Cowboy and the other Cowboy Subsidiaries is, and since January
1, 2013 has been, insured with respect to its assets and properties and the
conduct of its business in such amounts and against such risks as are in its
reasonable judgment sufficient for compliance with Law and as are adequate to
protect its assets and properties and the conduct of its business.

Section 5.19 _Related Party Transactions._ Except as (i) set forth in 
_Section 5.19_ of the Cowboy Disclosure Letter or (ii) described in the
publicly available Historic Cowboy SEC Documents, no agreements, arrangements
or understandings between Cowboy or any Cowboy Subsidiary (or binding on any
of their respective properties or assets), on the one hand, and any other
Person, on the other hand (other than those exclusively among Cowboy and
Cowboy Subsidiaries), are in existence that are not, but are required to be,
disclosed under Item 404 of Regulation S-K promulgated by the SEC.

Section 5.20 _Brokers._ No broker, investment banker or other Person (other
than the Persons listed in _Section 5.20_ of the Cowboy Disclosure Letter) is
entitled to any financial advisory fee, brokers, finders or other similar
fee or commission in connection with the Merger and the other transactions
contemplated by this Agreement based upon arrangements made by or on behalf of
Cowboy or any Cowboy Subsidiary.

 



52 Section 5.21 _Opinion of Financial Advisor._ The Cowboy Board has received the
opinion of Jefferies LLC to the effect that, as of such date and based on and
subject to the assumptions and limitations set forth in its written opinion,
the Merger Consideration to be paid by Frontier to the holders of Cowboy
Common Stock in the Merger is fair, from a financial point of view, to the
holders of Cowboy Common Stock. Cowboy will deliver to Frontier a complete and
correct copy of such written opinion promptly after receipt thereof by the
Cowboy Board solely for informational purposes. 

Section 5.22 _Takeover Statutes._ Assuming that neither Frontier nor Merger
Sub nor any of their "affiliates" or "associates" is, or at any time during
the last three (3) years has been, an "affiliated shareholder" of Cowboy, in
each case as defined in Section 21.601 of the TBOC, the Cowboy Board has taken
all action necessary to render the restrictions on "business combinations"
(as defined in Section 21.604 of the TBOC) as set forth in Section 21.606 of
the TBOC inapplicable to this Agreement, the Merger and the other transactions
contemplated hereby. Furthermore, neither Cowboy nor any of its "affiliates"
or "associates" is, or at any time during the last three (3) years has been,
an "interested stockholder" of Frontier, in each case as defined in Section
203 of the DGCL. No other Takeover Statutes or any provision of the Cowboy
Charter or Cowboy Bylaws relating to takeovers are applicable to this
Agreement, the Merger or the other transactions contemplated by
this Agreement. No dissenters, appraisal or similar rights are available to
the holders of Cowboy Common Stock with respect to the Merger and the other
transactions contemplated by this Agreement.

Cowboy or any Cowboy Subsidiary contained or incorporated by reference in the
Joint Proxy Statement or the Form S-4 that is provided by Cowboy or any Cowboy
Subsidiary for inclusion or incorporation by reference in the Form S-4 or the

transactions contemplated by this Agreement, to the extent relating to
Cowboy, their officers, directors and partners and the Cowboy Subsidiaries

Subsidiaries for inclusion therein) will comply in all material respects with
the applicable requirements of the Securities Act and the Exchange Act;
_provided_ , that no representation is made as to statements made or
incorporated by reference by Frontier or Merger Sub.

 

Section 5.24 _No Other Representations and Warranties._ Except for the
representations or warranties expressly set forth in this  _Article 5_ ,
neither Cowboy nor any other Person acting on its behalf has made any
representation or warranty, expressed or implied, with respect to Cowboy or

In particular, without limiting the foregoing disclaimer, neither Cowboy nor

Agreement, (i) Frontier and Cowboy shall prepare and cause to be filed with
the SEC the Joint Proxy Statement in preliminary form with respect to the
Frontier Stockholders Meeting and the Cowboy Shareholders Meeting and (ii)
Frontier and Cowboy shall prepare, and Frontier shall cause to be filed with
the SEC, a registration statement on Form S-4 under the Securities Act (the "
_Form S-4_ "), which will include the Joint Proxy Statement, to register under
the Securities Act the shares of Frontier Common Stock to be issued in the
Merger. Each of Frontier and Cowboy shall use its reasonable best efforts to
(A) have the Form S-4 declared effective under the Securities Act as promptly
as practicable after such filing, (B) ensure that the Form S-4 complies in all
material respects with the applicable provisions of the Exchange Act and the
Securities Act and (C) keep the Form S-4 effective for so long as necessary to
permit the Frontier Common Stock to be issued in the Merger, unless this
Agreement is terminated pursuant to _Article 9_. Each of Frontier and Cowboy
shall furnish all information concerning itself, its Affiliates and the
holders of its capital stock as may be reasonably requested by the other Party
and provide such other Party assistance as may be reasonably requested by the
other Party in connection with the preparation, filing and distribution of the
Form S-4 and the Joint Proxy Statement and shall provide to their and each
others counsel such representations as reasonably necessary to render the
opinions required to be filed therewith. The Form S-4 and the Joint Proxy
Statement shall include all information reasonably requested by such other
Party to be included therein. For the avoidance of doubt, no filing of,
or amendment or supplement to, the Form S-4 will be made by Frontier, and no
filing of, or amendment or supplement to, the Joint Proxy Statement will be
made by Frontier or Cowboy, in each case without providing the other Party
with a reasonable opportunity to review and comment thereon. Each Party shall
promptly notify the other Party of any comments it receives from the SEC or
any request it receives from the SEC for amendments or supplements to the Form
S-4 or the Joint Proxy Statement, and shall, as promptly as practicable after
receipt thereof, provide the other Party with copies of all correspondence
between it and its Representatives, on the one hand, and the SEC, on the other
hand, and all written comments with respect to the Form S-4 or the Joint
Proxy Statement received from the SEC and advise the other Party of any oral
comments with respect to the Form S-4 or the Joint Proxy Statement received
from the SEC. Each of Frontier and Cowboy shall use its reasonable
best efforts to respond as promptly as practicable to any comments from the
SEC with respect to the Form S-4 or the Joint Proxy Statement. Notwithstanding
the foregoing, prior to filing the Form S-4 (or any amendment or supplement
thereto) with the SEC or mailing the Joint Proxy Statement (or any amendment
or supplement thereto) or responding to any comments of the SEC with respect
thereto, each Party shall cooperate and provide the other Party a reasonable
opportunity to review and comment on such document or response (including the
proposed final version of such document or response) and shall give due
consideration to all reasonable changes provided by the other Party. Each of
Frontier and Cowboy shall notify the other Party, promptly after it receives
notice thereof, of the time of effectiveness of the Form S-4, the issuance of
any stop order relating thereto or the suspension of the qualification for
offering or sale in any jurisdiction of the shares of Frontier Common Stock
to be issued in the Merger, and Frontier and Cowboy shall use their
reasonable best efforts to have any such stop order or suspension lifted,
reversed or otherwise terminated. Each of Frontier and Cowboy shall also use
reasonable best efforts to take any other action required to be taken under
the Securities Act, the Exchange Act, any applicable foreign or state
securities or "blue sky" Laws and the rules and regulations thereunder in
connection with the issuance of Frontier Common Stock to be issued in the
Merger, and each of Frontier and Cowboy shall furnish all information as may
be reasonably requested in connection with any such actions.

 

(b) If, at any time prior to the Effective Time, any information relating to
Frontier or Cowboy, or any of their respective Affiliates, should be
discovered by Frontier or Cowboy which, in the reasonable judgment of Frontier
or Cowboy, should be set forth in an amendment of, or a supplement to, any of
the Form S-4 or the Joint Proxy Statement, so that any of such documents would
not include any misstatement of a material fact or omit to

 



60  state any material fact necessary to make the statements therein, in light
of the circumstances under which they were made, not misleading, the Party
that discovers such information shall promptly notify the other Party, and
Frontier and Cowboy shall cooperate in the prompt filing with the SEC of any
necessary amendment of, or supplement to, the Form S-4 or the Joint Proxy
Statement and, to the extent required by Law, in disseminating the
information contained in such amendment or supplement to stockholders of
Frontier and shareholders of Cowboy. Nothing in this _Section 7.1(b)_ shall
limit the obligations of any Party under _Section 7.1(a)_. For purposes of
_Section 4.24_, _Section 5.23_ and this _Section 7.1_, any information
concerning or related to Frontier, its Affiliates or the Frontier Stockholders
Meeting will be deemed to have been provided by Frontier, and any information
concerning or related to Cowboy, its Affiliates or the Cowboy Shareholders
Meeting will be deemed to have been provided by Cowboy.

 

(c) As promptly as practicable following the date on which the Form S-4 has
been declared effective, Frontier shall, in accordance with applicable Law
and the Frontier Governing Documents, establish a record date for, duly call,
give notice of, convene and hold the Frontier Stockholders Meeting for the
purpose of obtaining the Frontier Stockholder Approval; _provided_ ,
that such record date shall not be more than sixty (60) days, and not less
than ten (10) days, prior to the date of the Frontier Stockholders Meeting.
Frontier shall use its reasonable best efforts to cause the definitive Joint
Proxy Statement to be mailed to Frontiers stockholders entitled to vote at
the Frontier Stockholders Meeting and to hold the Frontier Stockholders
Meeting as soon as practicable after the Form S-4 is declared effective under
the Securities Act. Frontier shall, through the Frontier Board, recommend to
its stockholders that they give the Frontier Stockholder Approval, include the
Frontier Board Recommendation in the Joint Proxy Statement and solicit and use
its reasonable best efforts to obtain the Frontier Stockholder Approval,
except to the extent that the Frontier Board shall have made an Adverse
Recommendation Change as permitted by _Section 7.3(c)_; _provided_ ,
_however_ , that Frontiers obligation to duly call, give notice of, convene
and hold the Frontier Stockholders Meeting shall be unconditional unless this
Agreement is terminated in accordance with its terms and shall not be affected
by any Adverse Recommendation Change. Notwithstanding the
foregoing provisions of this _Section 7.1(c)_, if, on a date for which the
Frontier Stockholders Meeting is scheduled, (i) Frontier has not received
proxies representing a sufficient number of shares of Frontier Common Stock to
obtain the Frontier Stockholder Approval, whether or not a quorum is present,
or (ii) the Frontier Board has determined in good faith after consultation
with outside counsel that it is advisable to allow reasonable additional time
for the filing and mailing of supplemental or amended disclosure to be
disseminated and reviewed by Frontiers stockholders prior to the Frontier
Stockholders Meeting, which supplemental or amended disclosure has been
determined by the Frontier Board in good faith after consultation with
outside counsel to be necessary under applicable Law, Frontier shall have the
right to make one or more successive postponements or adjournments of the
Frontier Stockholders Meeting ( _provided_ , _however_ , that the Frontier
Stockholders Meeting shall not be postponed or adjourned to a date that is
more than thirty (30) days in the aggregate, in the case of clause (i), or ten
(10) Business Days in the aggregate, in the case of clause (ii), after the
date for which the Frontier Stockholders Meeting was originally scheduled
(excluding any adjournments or postponements required by applicable Law));
_provided_ , _further_ , other than pursuant to clause (ii) of this
Section, the Frontier Stockholders Meeting may not be postponed or adjourned
on the date the Frontier Stockholders Meeting is scheduled if Frontier shall
have received proxies in respect of an aggregate number of shares of Frontier
Common Stock, which have not been withdrawn, such that the Frontier
Stockholder Approval will be obtained at such meeting. Frontier shall, upon
the reasonable request of Cowboy, advise Cowboy at least on a daily basis on
each of the last seven (7) Business Days prior to the date of the Frontier
Stockholders Meeting as to the aggregate tally of proxies received by Frontier
with respect to the Frontier Stockholder Approval.

 

(d) As promptly as practicable following the date on which the Form S-4 has
been declared effective, Cowboy shall, in accordance with applicable Law and
the Cowboy Governing Documents, establish a record date for, duly call, give
notice of, convene and hold the Cowboy Shareholders Meeting for the purpose of
obtaining the Cowboy Shareholder Approval; _provided_ , that such record date
shall not be more than sixty (60) days, and not less than ten (10) days, prior
to the date of the Cowboy Shareholders Meeting. Cowboy shall use its
reasonable best efforts to cause the definitive Joint Proxy Statement to
be mailed to Cowboys shareholders entitled to vote at the Cowboy
Shareholders Meeting and to hold the Cowboy Shareholders Meeting as soon as

 



61  practicable after the Form S-4 is declared effective under the Securities
Act. Cowboy shall, through the Cowboy Board, recommend to its stockholders
that they give the Cowboy Shareholders Approval, include the Cowboy Board
Recommendation in the Joint Proxy Statement and solicit and use its reasonable
best efforts to obtain the Cowboy Shareholder Approval, except to the extent
that the Cowboy Board shall have made an Adverse Recommendation Change as
permitted by _Section 7.3(c)_; _provided_ , _however_ , that Cowboys
obligation to duly call, give notice of, convene and hold the Cowboy
Shareholders Meeting shall be unconditional unless this Agreement is
terminated in accordance with its terms and shall not be affected by any
Adverse Recommendation Change. Notwithstanding the foregoing provisions of
this _Section 7.1(d)_, if, on a date for which the Cowboy Shareholders
Meeting is scheduled, (i) Cowboy has not received proxies representing a
sufficient number of shares of Cowboy Common Stock to obtain the Cowboy
Shareholder Approval, whether or not a quorum is present, or (ii) the Cowboy
Board has determined in good faith after consultation with outside counsel
that it is advisable to allow reasonable additional time for the filing and
mailing of supplemental or amended disclosure to be disseminated and reviewed
by Cowboys shareholders prior to the Cowboy Shareholders Meeting, which
supplemental or amended disclosure has been determined by the Cowboy Board in
good faith after consultation with outside counsel to be necessary under
applicable Law, Cowboy shall have the right to make one or more successive
postponements or adjournments of the Cowboy Shareholders Meeting ( _provided_
, _however_ , that the Cowboy Shareholders Meeting shall not be postponed or
adjourned to a date that is more than thirty (30) days in the aggregate, in
the case of clause (i), or ten (10) Business Days in the aggregate, in the
case of clause (ii), after the date for which the Cowboy Shareholders Meeting
was originally scheduled (excluding any adjournments or
postponements required by applicable Law)); _provided_ , _further_ , other
than pursuant to clause (ii) of this Section, the Cowboy Shareholders Meeting
may not be postponed or adjourned on the date the Cowboy Shareholders Meeting
is scheduled if Cowboy shall have received proxies in respect of an aggregate
number of shares of Cowboy Common Stock, which have not been withdrawn, such
that Cowboy Shareholder Approval will be obtained at such meeting. Cowboy
shall, upon the reasonable request of Frontier, advise Frontier at least on a
daily basis on each of the last seven (7) Business Days prior to the date of
the Cowboy Shareholders Meeting as to the aggregate tally of proxies received
by Cowboy with respect to the Cowboy Shareholder Approval.

(e) Frontier and Cowboy will use their respective reasonable best efforts to
hold the Frontier Stockholders Meeting and the Cowboy Shareholders Meeting on
the same date (it being understood that if the Frontier Stockholders Meeting
or the Cowboy Shareholders Meeting is adjourned pursuant to clause (i) or (ii)
of _Section 7.1(c)_ or  _Section 7.1(d)_, as applicable, the other Party
may postpone or adjourn its shareholders or stockholders meeting, as
applicable, to the same time and date).

 

Section 7.2 _Access to Information; Confidentiality._

 

(a) During the period from the date of this Agreement to and including the
Effective Time, each of the Parties shall, and shall cause each of their
respective subsidiaries to, afford to the other Parties and to their
respective Representatives reasonable access during normal business hours and
upon reasonable advance notice to all of their respective properties, offices,
books, Contracts, personnel and records and, during such period, each of the
Parties shall, and shall cause each of their respective subsidiaries to,
furnish reasonably promptly to the other Parties a copy of each report,
schedule, registration statement and other document filed by it during such
period pursuant to the requirements of federal or state securities Laws. No
investigation under this _Section 7.2(a)_ or otherwise shall affect any of
the representations and warranties of the Parties contained in this Agreement
or any condition to the obligations of the Parties under this Agreement.
Notwithstanding the foregoing, none of the Parties shall be required by this
_Section 7.2(a)_ to provide the other Parties or their respective
Representatives with access to or to disclose information (i) that is subject
to the terms of a confidentiality agreement with a third party entered into
prior to the date of this Agreement or entered into after the date of
this Agreement in the ordinary course of business consistent with past
practice ( _provided_ , _however_ , that the withholding Party shall use its
reasonable best efforts to obtain the required consent of such third party to
such access or disclosure), (ii) the disclosure of which would violate any
Law applicable to such Party or any of its Representatives ( _provided_ ,
_however_ , that withholding Party shall use its reasonable best efforts to
make appropriate substitute arrangements to permit reasonable disclosure not
in violation of any Law or duty) or (iii) that is subject to any attorney-
client,

 



62  attorney work product or other legal privilege ( _provided_ , _however_ ,
that withholding Party shall use its reasonable best efforts to allow for such
access or disclosure to the maximum extent that does not result in a loss of
any such attorney-client, attorney work product or other legal privilege,
including by means of entry into a customary joint defense agreement that
would alleviate the loss of such privilege). The Parties will use their
reasonable best efforts to minimize any disruption to the businesses of the
other Parties and any of their respective subsidiaries that may result from
the requests for access, data and information hereunder. Prior to the
Effective Time, the Parties shall not, and shall cause their respective
Representatives and Affiliates not to, contact or otherwise communicate with
parties with which any of the other Parties or any other of their respective
subsidiaries has a business relationship regarding the business of the other
Parties and their respective subsidiaries or this Agreement and the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement without the prior written consent
of such other Party ( _provided_ , that, for the avoidance of doubt, nothing
in this _Section 7.2(a)_ shall be deemed to restrict the Parties from
contacting such parties in pursuing the business of the Parties operating in
the ordinary course).

 

(b) Each Party will hold, and will cause its respective Representatives and
Affiliates to hold, any nonpublic information, including any information
exchanged pursuant to this _Section 7.2_, in confidence to the extent
required by and in accordance with, and will otherwise comply with, the terms
of the Confidentiality Agreement, which shall remain in full force and
effect pursuant to the terms thereof notwithstanding the execution and
delivery of this Agreement or the termination thereof.

Section 7.3  _No Solicitation; Acquisition Proposals._

(a) Except as expressly permitted by this _Section 7.3_, neither Cowboy
nor Frontier shall, and Cowboy shall cause each of the Cowboy Subsidiaries
and Frontier shall cause each of the Frontier Subsidiaries not to, and shall
instruct and use its reasonable best efforts to cause its and their respective
Representatives not to, directly or indirectly, (i) solicit, initiate or
knowingly encourage or facilitate any inquiry, proposal or offer with respect
to, or the announcement, making or completion of, any Acquisition Proposal, or
any inquiry, proposal or offer that is reasonably likely to lead to any
Acquisition Proposal, (ii) enter into, continue or otherwise participate in
any discussions or negotiations regarding, or furnish to any Person (other
than Cowboy, Frontier or their respective Representatives) any non-public
information or data in furtherance of, any Acquisition Proposal or any
inquiry, proposal or offer that is reasonably likely to lead to any
Acquisition Proposal, (iii) enter into any definitive acquisition agreement,
merger agreement, share exchange agreement, consolidation agreement, option
agreement, joint venture agreement or partnership agreement (including any
letter of intent or agreement in principle) (each, an " _Alternative
Acquisition Agreement_ ") relating to any Acquisition Proposal (other than an
Acceptable Confidentiality Agreement pursuant to this _Section 7.3(a)_), (iv)
grant any waiver, amendment or release under any standstill or
confidentiality agreement or any Takeover Statute or (v) agree, approve,
recommend or propose to do any of the foregoing. Each of Frontier and Cowboy
shall, and shall cause each of the Frontier Subsidiaries and the Cowboy
Subsidiaries, respectively, and shall use its reasonable best efforts to
cause its and their Representatives to, (A) immediately cease and cause to be
terminated all existing negotiations with any Person and its Representatives
(other than the Parties or any of their Representatives) conducted heretofore
with respect to any Acquisition Proposal, (B) enforce any confidentiality or
standstill or provisions of similar effect to which Frontier or Cowboy, as
applicable, or any of their subsidiaries is a party or of which Frontier or
Cowboy, as applicable, or any of their subsidiaries is a beneficiary with
regards to any Acquisition Proposal, and (C) request the prompt return or
destruction, to the extent permitted by any confidentiality agreement, of all
non-public information or data previously furnished to any such Person and its
Representatives with respect to any Acquisition Proposal and immediately
terminate all physical and electronic data room access previously granted to
any such Person, its subsidiaries or any of their respective Representatives
with respect to any Acquisition Proposal. Notwithstanding the foregoing, if,
at any time following the date of this Agreement and prior to obtaining the
Frontier Stockholder Approval or the Cowboy Shareholder Approval, as
applicable, (1) Frontier or Cowboy, as applicable, receives a written
Acquisition Proposal that was not the result of a violation of this _Section
7.3(a)_ and (2) the Frontier Board or the Cowboy Board, as applicable,
determines in good faith (after consultation with outside counsel and a
financial advisor) that such Acquisition Proposal constitutes or is reasonably
likely to lead to a Superior Proposal and determines in good faith
(after consultation

 



63  with outside counsel) that its failure to take such action would be
inconsistent with its fiduciary duties under applicable Law, then such Party
may (and may authorize its Subsidiaries and its Representatives to), after
notifying the other Party of such determination, (x) furnish non-public
information or data with respect to itself and its subsidiaries to the Person
making such Acquisition Proposal (and its Representatives) pursuant to an
Acceptable Confidentiality Agreement; _provided_ , that (i) any non-public
information or data provided to any such Person given such access shall have
previously been provided to the other Party or shall be provided (to the
extent permitted by applicable Law) to the other Party prior to or
substantially concurrently with the time it is provided to such Person and
(ii) no non-public information or data with respect to the other Party shall
be provided to any such Person, and (y) participate in discussions and
negotiations with the Person making such Acquisition Proposal (and such
Persons Representatives) regarding such Acquisition Proposal.

 

(b) Except as provided in _Section 7.3(c)_, neither the Frontier Board nor
the Cowboy Board shall (i) fail to make or shall withdraw (or modify or
qualify in any manner adverse to the other Party or publicly propose to
withdraw, modify or qualify in any manner adverse to the other Party) the
Frontier Board Recommendation or the Cowboy Board Recommendation,
respectively, or the determination of the advisability to its stockholders of
the Merger, the issuance of Frontier Common Stock in the Merger and other
transactions contemplated hereby, (ii) adopt, approve, or publicly recommend,
endorse or otherwise declare advisable any Acquisition Proposal, (iii) fail
to include the Frontier Board Recommendation or the Cowboy Board
Recommendation, respectively, in whole or in part in the Joint Proxy Statement
or any filing or amendment or supplement relating thereto, (iv) fail to
recommend against any then-pending tender or exchange offer that constitutes
an Acquisition Proposal within ten (10) Business Days after it is announced or
(v) fail, within three (3) Business Days of a request by the other Party
following the public announcement of an Acquisition Proposal, to reaffirm the
Frontier Board Recommendation or the Cowboy Board Recommendation, as
applicable (each such action set forth in this _Section 7.3(b)_ being
referred to herein as an " _Adverse Recommendation Change_ ").

(c) Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the contrary, at any time
prior to obtaining the Frontier Stockholder Approval or the Cowboy Shareholder
Approval, as applicable, and following the compliance with this _Section
7.3(c)_, the Frontier Board or the Cowboy Board may, if such Board determines
in good faith (after consultation with outside counsel) that the failure to do
so would be inconsistent with its fiduciary duties under applicable Law, make
an Adverse Recommendation Change; _provided_ , that prior to effecting an
Adverse Recommendation Change, (i) Frontier or Cowboy, as applicable, shall
notify the other Party in writing, at least five (5) Business Days prior to
effecting such Adverse Recommendation Change (the " _Notice Period_ "), of
its intention to effect such Adverse Recommendation Change (which notice shall
specify in reasonable detail the basis for the Adverse Recommendation Change
and, if such Adverse Recommendation Change is based upon receipt of a Superior
Proposal, shall include the material terms and conditions of such Superior
Proposal and the identity of the Person making such Superior Proposal and
include copies of the current drafts of all material agreements between such
Party and the party making such Superior Proposal and any other material
documents or agreements that relate to such Superior Proposal (it being
understood and agreed that such notice or the public disclosure by such Party
of such notice shall not in and of itself constitute an Adverse
Recommendation Change)), (ii) during the Notice Period, the Party providing
such notice shall negotiate with the other Party in good faith (to the extent
such other Party wishes to negotiate) to make such adjustments to the terms
and conditions of this Agreement such that failure to make an Adverse
Recommendation Change would no longer be inconsistent with such Partys
Boards fiduciary duties under applicable Law, and (iii) the applicable
Partys Board shall determine, after the close of business on the last day of
the Notice Period, in good faith (after consultation with outside counsel and
after giving effect to any adjustments proposed by the other Party in writing
during the Notice Period) that failure to make an Adverse Recommendation
Change would be inconsistent with such Boards fiduciary duties under
applicable Law; _provided_ , _however_ , that in the event of any material
change to the material terms of such Superior Proposal, Frontier or Cowboy,
as applicable, shall, in each case, have delivered to the other Party an
additional notice consistent with that described in clause (i) above and the
Notice Period shall have recommenced (in which case such Notice Period shall
be for three (3) Business Days instead of five (5) Business Days).

 



64 (d) Frontier or Cowboy, as applicable, shall promptly (and in any event,
within one (1) Business Day) notify the other Party after it or any of its
subsidiaries or any of their respective Representatives has received any
Acquisition Proposal or inquiry, proposal or offer to enter into or seeking to
have discussions or negotiations relating to a possible Acquisition Proposal.
Such notice to the other Party shall indicate the identity of the Person
making, and include the material terms and conditions, of such Acquisition
Proposal, inquiry, proposal or offer (including a complete copy thereof if in
writing and any related documents or correspondence). Following the date
hereof, each Party shall keep the other Party reasonably informed orally and
in writing on a current basis (and in any event, no later than one (1)
Business Day) of any material developments, discussions or negotiations
regarding any Acquisition Proposal including providing a copy of all material
documentation (including drafts) or material correspondence with respect
thereto and upon the request of such other Party shall apprise the other
Party of the status and details of such Acquisition Proposal. Each Party
agrees that it and its subsidiaries will not enter into any agreement with any
Person subsequent to the date hereof which prohibits such Party from
providing any information to the other Party in accordance with, or from
otherwise complying with the terms of, this _Section 7.3_.

 

(e) Nothing contained in this _Section 7.3_ shall prohibit Frontier or the
Frontier Board, or Cowboy or the Cowboy Board, respectively, from (i) issuing
a "stop, look and listen" communication pursuant to Rule 14d-9(f) under the
Exchange Act or taking and disclosing a position contemplated by Rule
14e-2(a), 14d-9 or Item 1012(a) of Regulation M-A under the Exchange Act, or
(ii) making any disclosure to the stockholders of Frontier or Cowboy, as
applicable, if, in the good faith judgment of such Board (after consultation
with outside counsel), failure to so disclose would be inconsistent with its
fiduciary duties under applicable Law, and disclosure referred to in clauses
(i) and (ii) shall not be deemed to be an Adverse Recommendation Change so
long as (A) any such disclosure includes the Frontier Board Recommendation or
the Cowboy Board Recommendation, as applicable, without any modification or
qualification thereof or continues the prior recommendation of the Frontier
Board or the Cowboy Board, respectively, and (B) does not contain an express
Adverse Recommendation Change; _provided_ , that in no event shall this
_Section 7.3(e)_ affect either Partys obligations specified in _Section
7.3(b)_.

 

(f) For purposes of this Agreement:

 

(i) " _Acquisition Proposal_ " means any proposal, offer, or inquiry from any
Person or group of Persons relating to any direct or indirect acquisition or
purchase, in one transaction or a series of transactions, including any
merger, reorganization, share exchange, consolidation, tender offer, exchange
offer, stock acquisition, asset acquisition, business
combination, liquidation, dissolution, joint venture or similar transaction,
(A) of or for assets or businesses of Frontier and the Frontier Subsidiaries
or Cowboy and the Cowboy Subsidiaries, as applicable, that generate 20% or
more of the net revenues or net income or that represent 20% or more of the
consolidated total assets (based on fair market value) of Frontier and the
Frontier Subsidiaries or Cowboy and the Cowboy Subsidiaries, respectively,
taken as a whole, immediately prior to such transaction or (B) of or for 20%
or more of any class of capital stock, other equity security or voting power
of Frontier or Cowboy (or any resulting parent company of Frontier or Cowboy),
in each case other than the transactions contemplated by this Agreement.

(ii) " _Superior Proposal_ " means any _bona fide_ unsolicited Acquisition
Proposal made after the date hereof (with all percentages included in the
definition of "Acquisition Proposal" increased to 50%), taking into account
all legal, financial, regulatory and other aspects of the proposal and the
Person making the proposal, that (A) if consummated, would be more favorable
to the stockholders of Frontier or shareholders of Cowboy, respectively, from
a financial point of view than the Merger and the other transactions
contemplated by this Agreement (including any adjustment to the terms and
conditions thereof proposed in writing by the other Party in response to any
such Acquisition Proposal) and (B) if accepted, is reasonably likely to be
completed on the terms proposed on a timely basis.

effect, the Parties shall consult with each other before issuing any press
release or otherwise making any public statements or filings with respect to
this Agreement or any of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, and
none of the Parties shall issue any such press release or make any such public
statement or filing prior to obtaining the other Parties consent (which
consent shall not be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed);
_provided_ , that a Party may, without obtaining the other Parties consent,
issue such press release or make such public statement or filing as may be
required by Law, Order or the applicable rules of any stock exchange if it is
not possible to consult with the other Party before making any public
statement with respect to this Agreement or any of the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement. The Parties have agreed upon the
form of a joint press release announcing the Merger and the execution of this
Agreement, and shall make such joint press release no later than one (1)

with and assist each other in good faith to devise and implement a joint
strategy for making such filings, including the timing thereof, and for
obtaining any related antitrust, competition, fair trade or similar
clearances, (B) consult in advance with the other Party and in good faith take
the other Partys views into account regarding the overall strategic direction
of obtaining such antitrust, competition, fair trade or similar clearances
and (C) consult with the other Party prior to taking any material substantive
position in any written submissions or, to the extent practicable, in any
discussions with Governmental Authorities with respect to such
antitrust, competition, fair trade or similar clearances, including any
position as to a Remedial Action. To the extent permitted by applicable Law,
each Party shall permit the other Party to review and discuss in advance, and
shall consider in good faith the views of the other Party in connection with,
any analyses, presentations, memoranda, briefs, written arguments, opinions,
written proposals or other materials to be submitted to the Governmental
Authorities. No Party will independently participate in any formal meeting
with any Governmental Authority with respect to the Merger and the other
transactions contemplated by this Agreement without giving the other Parties
prior notice of the meeting and, to the extent permitted by such
Governmental Authority, the opportunity to attend and participate in such
meeting. To the extent permitted by applicable Law, each Party shall keep the
other apprised of the material content and status of any material
communications with, and material communications from, any Governmental
Authority with respect to the Merger and the other transactions contemplated
by this Agreement, including promptly notifying the other Party of any
material communication it receives from any Governmental Authority relating
to any review or investigation of the Merger and the other transactions
contemplated by this Agreement under any Antitrust Laws. To the extent
permitted by applicable Law, the Parties shall, and shall use their reasonable
best efforts to cause their respective Affiliates to use their reasonable
best efforts to, provide the other Parties with copies of all material
correspondence, filings or communications between them or any of their
respective Representatives, on the one hand, and any Governmental Authority
or members of its staff, on the other hand, with respect to this Agreement,
the Merger and the other transactions contemplated hereunder; _provided_ ,
_however_ , that materials may be redacted (1) to remove references
concerning the valuation of Frontier and the Frontier Subsidiaries or Cowboy
and the Cowboy Subsidiaries, as applicable; (2) as necessary to comply with
any Contract or Laws; and (3) as necessary to address reasonable attorney-
client or other privilege or confidentiality concerns.

(c) Subject to the following sentence of this  _Section 7.5(c)_, Cowboy and
Frontier shall, and shall cause each of their respective Subsidiaries to, take
any and all steps necessary to obtain approval of the Merger and the other
transactions contemplated by this Agreement by any Governmental Authority
under the Antitrust Laws, including taking all steps necessary to avoid or
eliminate each and every legal impediment under any Antitrust Laws that may be
asserted by any Governmental Authority so as to enable the parties hereto to
consummate the Merger and the other transactions contemplated by this
Agreement as promptly as reasonably practicable, and in any event prior to the
Outside Date, including proposing, negotiating, accepting, committing to and
effecting, by consent decree, hold separate orders, or otherwise, the sale,
transfer, license, or other disposition of their Subsidiaries, assets,
properties or businesses, the entrance into, or the amendment, modification or
termination of, any Contracts or other arrangements, or business practices,
and other remedies (each, a " _Remedial Action_ ") in order to obtain such
approvals and to avoid the entry of, or to effect the dissolution of, any
injunction, temporary restraining order or other Law in any suit or other
action, arbitration, or litigation, which could otherwise have the effect of
delaying beyond the Outside Date or preventing the consummation of the Merger
and the other 

 



67  transactions contemplated by this Agreement. Notwithstanding the foregoing
or any other provision of this Agreement, neither Cowboy nor Frontier nor any
of their respective Subsidiaries or Affiliates shall be required to propose,
negotiate, accept, commit to, or effect any Remedial Action, the effect of
which would reasonably be expected to have a material adverse effect after the
Closing on the combined businesses of Frontier and Cowboy and their
subsidiaries, taken as a whole, including the overall benefits expected, as of
the date of this Agreement, to be derived by the Parties from the combination
of Frontier and Cowboy via the Merger and the transactions contemplated
by this Agreement. In addition, Cowboy and Frontier shall, and shall cause
each of the Cowboy Subsidiaries and the Frontier Subsidiaries, as applicable,
to, defend through litigation on the merits so as to enable the parties to
close the Merger and the other transactions contemplated hereby as promptly
as reasonably practicable (and in any event prior to the Outside Date) any
claim asserted in court or an administrative or other tribunal by any
antitrust or competition Governmental Authority under Antitrust Laws in order
to avoid entry of, or to have vacated or terminated, any Order (whether
temporary, preliminary or permanent) that could prevent or delay beyond the
Outside Date the Closing from occurring; _provided_ , _however_ , that, for
the avoidance of doubt, such litigation shall in no way limit the obligations
of the parties to comply with their other obligations under the terms of this
_Section 7.5_. Cowboy and Frontier shall jointly direct and control any such
litigation with counsel of their own choosing. In the event of any conflict
between subsections (a), (b) or (c) of this _Section 7.5_, the provisions of
this _Section 7.5(c)_ shall, with respect to the matters addressed in this
_Section 7.5(c)_, supersede the provisions of subsections (a) and (b) of this
_Section 7.5_.

 

(d) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement, in connection
with obtaining any approval or consent from any Person (other than any
Governmental Authority) with respect to the Merger and the other transactions
contemplated by this Agreement, neither Frontier nor Cowboy nor any of their
respective Representatives, shall be obligated to pay or commit to pay to such
Person whose approval or consent is being solicited any cash or other
consideration, make any accommodation or commitment or incur any liability or
other obligation to such Person. Subject to the immediately foregoing
sentence, the Parties shall cooperate with respect to reasonable
accommodations that may be requested or appropriate to obtain such consents.

Section 7.6 _Notification of Certain Matters; Transaction Litigation._

(a) Frontier and its Representatives shall give prompt notice to Cowboy, and
Cowboy and its Representatives shall give prompt notice to Frontier, of any
notice or other communication received by such Party from any Governmental
Authority (other than any antitrust or competition Government Authority, which
shall be governed by  _Section 7.5_) or NASDAQ, NYSE or any other securities
market in connection with this Agreement, the Merger or the other transactions
contemplated by this Agreement, or from any Person alleging that the consent
or approval of such Person is or may be required in connection with the
Merger or the other transactions contemplated by this Agreement.

(b) Frontier and its Representatives shall give prompt notice to Cowboy, and
Cowboy and its Representatives shall give prompt notice to Frontier, if (i)
any representation or warranty made by it contained in this Agreement becomes
untrue or inaccurate such that the applicable closing conditions would not be
satisfied if the Closing Date were to be held on the date such representation
or warranty became untrue or inaccurate, (ii) it fails to comply with or
satisfy in any material respect any covenant, condition or agreement to be
complied with or satisfied by it under this Agreement or (iii) a Cowboy
Material Adverse Effect or a Frontier Material Adverse Effect, as applicable,
has occurred; _provided_ , that no such notification shall affect the
representations, warranties, covenants or agreements of the Parties or the
conditions to the obligations of the Parties under this Agreement.
Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement, the failure by
Frontier, Cowboy or their respective Representatives to provide such prompt
notice under this _Section 7.6(b)_ shall not constitute a breach of covenant
for purposes of _Section 8.2(b)_, _Section 8.3(b)_, _Section 9.1(c)(i)_, 
_Section 9.1(d)(i)_ or _Section 9.3(b)(i)_.

(c) Frontier and its Representatives shall give prompt notice to Cowboy, and
Cowboy and its Representatives shall give prompt notice to Frontier, of any
Action commenced or, to such Partys Knowledge, threatened against, relating
to or involving such Party or any Frontier Subsidiary or Cowboy Subsidiary, 

 



68  respectively, or any of their respective directors or officers that relates
to this Agreement, the Merger or the other transactions contemplated by this
Agreement. Frontier and its Representatives shall give Cowboy the opportunity
to participate in the defense and settlement of any stockholder litigation
against Frontier and/or its Representatives relating to this Agreement, the
Merger and the other transactions contemplated by this Agreement, and no such
settlement shall be agreed to without Cowboys prior written consent (which
consent shall not be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed). Cowboy
and its Representatives shall give Frontier the opportunity to participate in
the defense and settlement of any litigation against Cowboy and/or its
Representatives relating to this Agreement, the Merger and the other
transactions contemplated by this Agreement, and no such settlement shall be
agreed to without Frontiers prior written consent (which consent shall not
be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed).

 

Section 7.7 _Indemnification; Directors  and Officers Insurance._

 

(a) Without limiting or being limited by the provisions of _Section 7.7(b)_,
from and after the Effective Time, Frontier shall, and shall cause the
Surviving Entity to, (i) indemnify, defend and hold harmless each Indemnified
Party against and from any costs or expenses (including reasonable attorneys
fees, costs and expenses), judgments, fines, losses, claims, damages,
liabilities and amounts paid in settlement in connection with any Action or
threatened Action and any investigation, whether arising before or after the
Effective Time, to the extent such Action or investigation arises out of or
pertains to (A) any action or omission or alleged action or omission in such
Indemnified Partys capacity as a manager, director, officer, partner, member,
trustee, employee or agent of Cowboy or any of the Cowboy Subsidiaries or (B)
this Agreement or any of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement,
including the Merger; and (ii) pay in advance of the final disposition of any
such Action the expenses as incurred (including reasonable attorneys fees,
costs and expenses and any expenses incurred by any Indemnified Party in
connection with enforcing rights with respect to indemnification or
advancement of expenses, to the extent, in the case of any Action to enforce
rights to indemnification or advancement of expenses, that any Indemnified
Party is successful, in whole or in part, in enforcing such Indemnified
Partys rights with respect to indemnification or advancement of expenses) of
any Indemnified Party, without the requirement of any bond or other security,
in each case to the fullest extent permitted by Law, but subject to Frontiers
or the Surviving Entitys receipt of an undertaking by or on behalf of such
Indemnified Party to repay such amount if it shall ultimately be determined
by a court of competent jurisdiction that such Indemnified Party is not
entitled to be indemnified. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary set forth
in this Agreement, Frontier and the Surviving Entity, as applicable, (i) shall
not settle or compromise or consent to the entry of any judgment or otherwise
seek termination with respect to any Action against or investigation of any
Indemnified Party for which indemnification may be sought under this _Section
7.7(a)_ without the Indemnified Partys prior written consent (which consent
may not be unreasonably withheld, delayed or conditioned) unless such
settlement, compromise, consent or termination includes an unconditional
release of such Indemnified Party from all liability arising out of such
Action or investigation, and (ii) shall not have any obligation under this
_Section 7.7(a)_ to any Indemnified Party to the extent that a court of
competent jurisdiction shall determine in a final and non-appealable Order
that such indemnification is prohibited by applicable Law, in which case the
Indemnified Party shall promptly refund to Frontier or the Surviving Entity
the amount of all such expenses previously advanced pursuant hereto for which
indemnification is prohibited by such final and non-appealable Order.

(b) Without limiting the foregoing, each of Frontier and the Surviving Entity
agrees that all rights to exculpation of liabilities, indemnification and
advancement of expenses existing as of the date hereof in favor of the current
and former managers, directors, officers, partners, members, trustees,
employees or agents of Cowboy or any of the Cowboy Subsidiaries and the
fiduciaries of Cowboy or any of the Cowboy Subsidiaries under any Cowboy
Benefit Plan (collectively, the " _Indemnified Parties_ ") for acts or
omissions occurring or alleged to have occurred at or prior to the Effective
Time, whether asserted or claimed prior to, at or after the Effective Time, as
provided in (i) the Cowboy Governing Documents or, if applicable, similar
organizational documents or agreements of any Cowboy Subsidiary and any of
the Frontier Governing Documents with respect to any of the Indemnified
Parties or arising out of any rights to exculpation of liabilities,
indemnification obligations set forth 

 



69  in any Cowboy Benefit Plan or (ii) any indemnification agreements of Cowboy
or any Cowboy Subsidiary, all of which shall survive the Merger and shall
continue in full force and effect in accordance with their terms. For a
period of six (6) years after the Effective Time, Frontier and the Surviving
Entity shall cause to be maintained in effect the provisions in (i) the Cowboy
Governing Documents, in the Frontier Governing Documents, in the
organizational documents of any Cowboy Subsidiary, in any Cowboy Benefit Plan
and in any other agreements with any Indemnified Party, in each case,
regarding exculpation of liability, indemnification of officers, directors
and employees and advancement of expenses that are in existence on the date
of this Agreement, and no such provisions shall be amended, modified or
repealed in any manner that would adversely affect the rights or protections
thereunder of any such Indemnified Party in respect of acts or omissions
occurring or alleged to have occurred at or prior to the Effective Time
(including acts or omissions occurring or alleged to have occurred in
connection with the approval of this Agreement and the consummation of the
Merger and the other transactions contemplated hereby); provided, however,
that all rights to exculpation of liability, indemnification and advancement
of expenses in respect of any Action pending, asserted or made within
such six (6) year period shall continue until the final disposition of such
Action.

(c) For a period of six (6) years after the Effective Time, Frontier shall,
and shall cause the Surviving Entity to, maintain in effect Cowboys current
directors and officers liability insurance covering each Person currently
covered by Cowboys directors and officers liability insurance policy for
acts or omissions occurring prior to and through the Effective Time;
_provided_ , that in lieu of such obligation, (i) the Surviving Entity may
substitute therefor policies of an insurance company with the same or better
rating as Cowboys current insurance carrier the material terms of which,
including coverage and amount, are no less favorable in any material respect
to such Indemnified Parties than Cowboys existing policies as of the date
hereof or (ii) in consultation with Frontier, Cowboy may obtain extended
reporting period coverage under Cowboys existing insurance programs (to be
effective as of the Effective Time) for a period of six (6) years after the
Effective Time for a cost not in excess of three times the current annual
premiums for such insurance; and _provided_ , _further_ , that in no event
shall the Surviving Entity be required to pay annual premiums for insurance
under this _Section 7.7(c)_ in excess of 300% of the most recent annual
premiums paid by Cowboy for such purpose, it being understood that if the
annual premiums of such insurance coverage exceed such amount, the Surviving
Entity shall nevertheless be obligated to provide such coverage as may be
obtained for such 300% amount.

(d) If Frontier or the Surviving Entity or any of their respective successors
or assigns (i) consolidates with or merges with or into any other Person and
shall not be the continuing or surviving corporation, partnership or other
entity of such consolidation or merger or (ii) liquidates, dissolves or
winds-up, or transfers or conveys all or substantially all of its properties
and assets to any Person, then, and in each such case, proper provision shall
be made so that the successors and assigns of Frontier or the Surviving
Entity, as applicable, assume the obligations set forth in this _Section
7.7_.

(e) Frontier shall cause the Surviving Entity to pay all reasonable expenses,
including reasonable attorneys fees, costs and expenses that may be incurred
by any Indemnified Party in enforcing the obligations provided in this
_Section 7.7_.

 

(f) The provisions of this _Section 7.7_ are intended to be for the express
benefit of, and shall be enforceable by, each Indemnified Party (who are
intended third party beneficiaries of this _Section 7.7_), his or her heirs
and his or her personal representatives, shall be binding on all successors
and assigns of Cowboy, Frontier and the Surviving Entity and shall not be
amended in a manner that is adverse to the Indemnified Party (including his or
her successors, assigns and heirs) without the prior written consent of the
Indemnified Party (including such successors, assigns and heirs)
affected thereby. The exculpation and indemnification provided for by this
_Section 7.7_ shall not be deemed to be exclusive of any other rights to
which an Indemnified Party is entitled, whether pursuant to applicable Law,
Contract or otherwise. 

Section 7.8 _Stock Exchange Listing._ Frontier shall use its reasonable best
efforts to cause the shares of Frontier Common Stock to be issued in
connection with the Merger, to be approved for listing on the NASDAQ, subject
to official notice of issuance, at the Effective Time.

 



70 Section 7.9 _Dividends; Post-Merger Dividend Policy._ Frontier and Cowboy
shall coordinate with each other to designate the same record dates and
payment dates for any quarterly dividends or distributions declared in
accordance with this Agreement in any calendar quarter in which the Closing
Date might reasonably be expected to occur. In addition, prior to the mailing
of the Joint Proxy Statement, the Frontier Board shall adopt a new dividend
policy that provides for the payment of an annual cash dividend of $0.76 per
share of Frontier Common Stock (subject to adjustment for any stock dividend,
subdivision, reclassification, recapitalization, split, combination, exchange
or the like), which shall be payable quarterly. Such new dividend policy shall
remain in effect at the Effective Time and shall remain in effect following
the Effective Time, subject to the authority and discretion of the Frontier
Board to adjust its dividend policy.

 

Section 7.10 _Voting of Shares._ Cowboy shall vote, or cause to be voted, all
shares of Frontier Common Stock beneficially owned by it or any of the Cowboy
Subsidiaries as of the record date for the Frontier Stockholders Meeting, if
any, in favor of approval of the issuance of shares of Frontier Common Stock
in connection with the Merger. Frontier shall vote, or cause to be voted, all
shares of Cowboy Common Stock beneficially owned by it or any Frontier
Subsidiary as of the record date for the Cowboy Shareholders Meeting, if any,
in favor of the approval of this Agreement and the Merger.

 

Section 7.11 _Takeover Statutes._ The Parties shall use their respective
reasonable best efforts (a) to take all action necessary, to the extent that
such action is within its control, so that no Takeover Statute is or becomes
applicable to the Merger or any of the other transactions contemplated by this
Agreement and (b) if any such Takeover Statute is or becomes applicable to
any of the foregoing, to take all action necessary so that the Merger and the
other transactions contemplated by this Agreement may be consummated as
promptly as practicable on the terms contemplated by this Agreement
and otherwise to eliminate or minimize the effect of such Takeover Statute or
any restrictions in the Frontier Charter or the Cowboy Charter (" _Charter
Restrictions_ ") on the Merger and the other transactions contemplated by
this Agreement.

Section 7.12 _Tax Matters._

 

(a) Each Party shall deliver to each of Hunton and Williams LLP and Alston and
Bird LLP a tax representation letter, dated as of the Closing Date and signed
by an officer of such Party, containing representations of such Party
reasonably necessary or appropriate to enable each of Hunton and Williams LLP
and Alston and Bird LLP to render the tax opinions described in _Section
8.2(e)_ and _Section 8.3(e)_.

(b) Cowboy and Frontier shall reasonably cooperate in the preparation,
execution and filing of all returns, questionnaires, applications or other
documents regarding any real property transfer or gains, sales, use, transfer,
value added, stock transfer or stamp taxes, any transfer, recording,
registration and other fees and any similar taxes that become payable in
connection with the transactions contemplated by this Agreement (together with
any related interest, penalties or additions to such taxes, " _Transfer Taxes_
"), and shall reasonably cooperate in attempting to minimize the amount of
Transfer Taxes.

(c) Each of Cowboy and Frontier shall use its reasonable best efforts to
cause the Merger to qualify as a reorganization within the meaning of Section
368(a) of the Code, including by executing and delivering the officers
certificates referred to herein and reporting consistently for all
U.S. federal, state, and local income tax or other purposes.

(d) Neither Frontier nor Cowboy shall take or omit to take any action,
and neither party shall allow any of their respective Subsidiaries, including
the Surviving Entity, to take or omit to take any action, if such action or
failure to act would be reasonably likely to prevent or impede (i) the Merger
from qualifying as a "reorganization" within the meaning of Section 368(a) of
the Code or (ii) the Spin Transaction from qualifying as a reorganization
within the meaning of Section 368(a)(1)(D) of the Code and under Section 355
and related provisions of the Code (including Section 361(c)(1) of the Code)
and as not being taxable under Section 355(e) of the Code and related
provisions of the Code. Unless otherwise required by a "determination" within
the 

 



71  meaning of Section 1313 of the Code, neither Frontier nor Cowboy shall take,
and neither party shall allow any of their respective Subsidiaries to take,
any position on any Tax Return or for any tax purpose that is inconsistent
with (i) the Merger qualifying as a "reorganization" within the meaning of
Sections 368(a) of the Code or (ii) the Spin Transaction qualifying as a
reorganization within the meaning of Section 368(a)(1)(D) of the Code and
under Section 355 and related provisions of the Code (including Section
361(c)(1) of the Code) and as not being taxable under Section 355(e) of the
Code and related provisions of the Code. 

Section 7.13 _Financing Matters._ Between the date hereof and the Effective
Time, each of Frontier and Cowboy shall cooperate to develop a financing plan
for Frontier and the Frontier Subsidiaries to be in effect from and after the
Closing Date. Furthermore, each of Frontier and Cowboy shall, and shall cause
each of the Frontier Subsidiaries and the Cowboy Subsidiaries to, use their
reasonable best efforts to obtain any term loan or revolving loan credit
facility necessary to effect such financing plan, including, as necessary or
advisable, to fund the refinancing of Cowboys existing credit facility at
the Effective Time and the Surviving Entitys working capital needs from and
after the Effective Time (it being understood that obtaining such financing is
not a condition to the parties obligations to consummate any of the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement), including providing, and
causing each of the Frontier Subsidiaries and the Cowboy Subsidiaries to
provide, and using reasonable best efforts to cause their Representatives to
provide, all cooperation reasonably requested by the other Party in
connection with obtaining any such financing; _provided_ that such requested
cooperation does not unreasonably interfere with the ongoing operations of
Frontier, Cowboy, the Frontier Subsidiaries or the Cowboy Subsidiaries; and
_provided further_ that none of Frontier, Cowboy, the Frontier Subsidiaries
nor the Cowboy Subsidiaries shall be required to enter into any agreements in
connection therewith that would be binding if the Merger does not occur. Each
of Frontier and Cowboy shall, to the extent it is aware of any applicable
developments, promptly update any information provided by it for use in an
offering document to be used in connection with any such financing to the
extent such information would otherwise contain any untrue statement of
material fact or omit to state any material fact necessary in order to make
the statements contained therein, in light of the circumstances in which they
were made, not misleading.

 

Section 7.14 _Section 16 Matters._ Prior to the Effective Time, Frontier and
Cowboy shall take all such steps as may be required to cause any dispositions
of Cowboy Common Stock (including derivative securities with respect to Cowboy
Common Stock) or acquisitions of Frontier Common Stock resulting from the
Merger and the other transactions contemplated by this Agreement by each
individual who is subject to the reporting requirements of Section 16(a) of
the Exchange Act with respect to Frontier or Cowboy, to be exempt under Rule
16b-3 promulgated under the Exchange Act.

 

Section 7.15 _Employee Matters._

 

(a) At the Effective Time and for a period commencing at the Effective Time
and ending on December 31, 2016 (the " _Transition Period_ "), Frontier will,
and will cause the Frontier Subsidiaries (including the Surviving Entity and
its Subsidiaries), to honor all obligations under the Cowboy Benefit Plans in
accordance with their terms as in effect immediately prior to the Effective
Time, including all health benefits, life, accidental death and dismemberment
and long term disability insurance coverage at the same coverage levels as
each employee of Cowboy or any Cowboy Subsidiary and their dependents
were enrolled in immediately prior to the Effective Time; _provided_ ,
_however_ , that Frontier may provide the benefits under the Cowboy Benefit
Plans pursuant to alternative plans established by Frontier that provide
benefits (including with respect to employee costs) that are determined by
the Frontier Board, in good faith, to be, in the aggregate, substantially
comparable to the benefits provided under the Cowboy Benefit Plans as in
effect immediately prior to the Effective Time. Nothing in this _Section
7.15(a)_ shall prevent Frontier from making modifications to the Cowboy
Benefit Plans that (i) are required by Law or (ii) are consistent with
ordinary past practices of Cowboy prior to the Effective Time. After the
expiration of the Transition Period, the Cowboy Benefits Plans may be amended
or replaced by New Plans to govern the employment benefits, including all
health benefits, life, accidental death and dismemberment and long
term disability insurance coverage, _provided that_ , during calendar year
2017, the prior written consent of the President and Chief Operating Officer
of Frontier approving any such changes and/or

 



72  replacements shall have first been obtained (or, if T. Brent Stuart is not
the President and Chief Operating Officer of Frontier at such time, then such
changes or replacements shall be subject to the approval of the Frontier
Board).

(b) Subject to their obligations under applicable Law, Frontier will, and will
cause the Frontier Subsidiaries (including the Surviving Entity and its
subsidiaries) to, give credit under each employee plans, programs and
arrangements to employees for all service prior to the Effective Time with
Cowboy or any Cowboy Subsidiary for all purposes for which such service was
taken into account or recognized by Cowboy or any Cowboy Subsidiary, but not
to the extent crediting such service would result in duplication of benefits.

 

(c) With respect to any employee plan, program and arrangements providing
employment benefits in which certain employees of Cowboy or any Cowboy
Subsidiary becomes eligible to participate on or after the Effective Time ("
_New Plans_ "), Frontier shall, and shall cause the Surviving Entity to, to
the extent permitted by Law, (i) (A) use its reasonable best efforts to waive
all pre-existing conditions, exclusions and waiting periods with respect to
participation and coverage requirements applicable to each such employee and
his or her eligible dependents under any New Plans, and (B) provide each such
employee and his or her eligible dependents with credit for any co-payments or
deductibles and out of pocket limits paid during the plan year in which
participation under a New Plan (to the same extent that such credit was given
under the analogous Cowboy Benefit Plan prior to the Effective Time)
commences in satisfying any applicable deductible or out-of-pocket
requirements under any New Plans and (ii) recognize all service of each such
employee with Cowboy and each Cowboy Subsidiary for all purposes, including
eligibility to participate, vesting and benefit accrual (including, in order
to calculate the amount of any paid time off and leave balance, vacation and
sick days, severance and similar benefits), under any New Plan to the same
extent that such service was taken into account under the analogous Cowboy
Benefit Plan prior to the Effective Time, but not to the extent crediting such
service would result in duplication of benefits.

 

(d) Notwithstanding any of the foregoing to the contrary, at the Effective
Time and throughout the Transition Period, Frontier shall, and shall cause
each of the Frontier Subsidiaries (including the Surviving Entity), to provide
severance benefits to each employee of Cowboy or any Cowboy Subsidiary who
experiences an involuntary termination of employment during the Transition
Period, beginning at the Effective Time, in an amount that is at least equal
to the severance benefits that would have been paid to such employee pursuant
to the terms of the applicable severance plans or arrangements maintained by
Cowboy or any Cowboy Subsidiary as in effect immediately prior to the
Effective Time, to be calculated, however, on the basis of the employees
compensation and service (calculated taking into account service with Cowboy
and any Cowboy Subsidiary and service with Frontier and any Frontier
Subsidiary, on a combined basis). After the expiration of the Transition
Period, the foregoing severance benefits, plans and arrangements may be
changed or replaced by other severance benefits, plans and arrangements, 
_provided that_ , during calendar year 2017, the prior written consent of the
President and Chief Operating Officer of Frontier approving any such changes
and/or replacements shall have first been obtained (or, if T. Brent Stuart is
not the President and Chief Operating Officer of Frontier at such time, then
such changes or replacements shall be subject to the approval of the Frontier
Board).

 

(e) Frontier acknowledges the obligations of Cowboy under Cowboys 2016 Short-
Term Incentive Plan, which shall be administered following the Effective Time
as set forth in _Section 7.15(e)_ of the Cowboy Disclosure Letter.

(f) Frontier hereby acknowledges that a "change in control" of Cowboy or
other event of similar import, within the meaning of the Cowboy Benefit Plans
that contain such terms, will occur upon the Effective Time, as set forth in
Section 7.15 of the Cowboy Disclosure Letter and Frontier shall honor and
comply with all obligations (including payment obligations) as set forth in
_Section 7.15(f) _of the Cowboy Disclosure Letter.

 

(g) This Agreement is not intended by the parties to constitute a plan
amendment to or create any obligation of the parties with respect to any
Cowboy Benefit Plan or Frontier Benefit Plan.

 



73 (h) None of the Cowboy employees shall be bound by, nor shall any of the
Cowboy employees be required to agree to become bound by, the non-competition
covenants and post-employment restraints set forth in the Frontier employee
handbook as a condition of continued employment following the Closing Date
with Cowboy or any Cowboy Subsidiary or Frontier or any Frontier Subsidiary.

percentages included in the definition of "Acquisition Proposal" increased to
50%) has been publicly announced, disclosed or otherwise communicated to the
Frontier Board or any Person shall have publicly announced an intention

Termination Fee, together with any amounts due under _Section 9.3(d)_, shall
be Cowboys sole and exclusive remedy as liquidated damages for any and all
losses or damages of any nature against Frontier, the Frontier Subsidiaries
and each of their respective former, current and future directors, officers,
employees, agents, general and limited partners, managers, members,
stockholders, Affiliates and assignees and each former, current or future

transactions contemplated hereby and thereby, including for any loss or
damage suffered as a result of the termination of this Agreement, the failure
of the Merger to be consummated or for a breach or failure to perform
hereunder (whether intentionally, unintentionally, or otherwise) or
otherwise? _provided_ , _however_ , that the foregoing shall not impair the
rights of Cowboy, if any, to obtain injunctive relief and/or specific
performance pursuant to _Section 10.9_ prior to any termination of this
Agreement. Upon payment of such Frontier Termination Fee, no Frontier Released
Party shall have any further liability or obligation relating to or arising
out of this Agreement or the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement, except that the obligations under the Confidentiality Agreement
and the provisions of _Section 7.4_ (Public Announcements) and _Article 10_
(General Provisions) of this Agreement shall survive.

 

(c) In the event that:

(i) (A) (x) this Agreement is terminated by Frontier pursuant to _Section
9.1(d)(i)_, and after the date hereof and prior to the breach or failure to

Proposal with respect to Cowboy has been publicly announced, disclosed or
otherwise communicated to Cowboys shareholders (and not withdrawn) or any
Person shall have publicly announced an intention (whether or not conditional)
to make such an Acquisition Proposal and (B) within twelve (12) months after
the date of such termination, a transaction in respect of an Acquisition
Proposal with respect to Cowboy is consummated or Cowboy enters into a
definitive agreement in respect of an Acquisition Proposal with respect to
Cowboy that is later consummated; or

 

(ii) this Agreement is terminated by Frontier pursuant to _Section
9.1(d)(ii)_; then, in any such event, Cowboy shall pay to Frontier a
termination fee equal to $30,000,000 (the " _Cowboy Termination Fee_ "), it
being understood that in no event shall Cowboy be required to pay the Cowboy
Termination Fee on more than one occasion. Payment of the Cowboy Termination
Fee shall be made by wire transfer of same day funds to the account or
accounts designated by Frontier (i) prior to or concurrently at the time of
consummation of any transaction contemplated by an Acquisition Proposal, in
the case of a Cowboy Termination Fee payable pursuant to _Section
9.3(c)(i)_, and (ii) as promptly as reasonably practicable after termination
(and, in any event, within two (2) Business Days thereof), in the case of a
Cowboy Termination Fee payable pursuant to _Section 9.3(c)(ii)_.
Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the contrary, in the event that
the Cowboy Termination Fee becomes payable, then payment to Frontier of the
Cowboy Termination Fee, together with any amounts due under _Section
9.3(d)_, shall be Frontiers sole and exclusive remedy as liquidated damages

of this Agreement, any agreement executed in connection herewith, and the
transactions contemplated hereby and thereby, including for any loss or
damage suffered as a result of the termination of this Agreement, the failure
of the Merger to be consummated or for a breach or failure to perform
hereunder (whether intentionally, unintentionally, or otherwise) or
otherwise; _provided_ , _however_ , that the foregoing shall not impair the
rights of Frontier, if any, to obtain injunctive relief and/or specific
performance pursuant to _Section 10.9_ prior to any termination of this
Agreement. Upon payment of such Cowboy Termination Fee, no Cowboy Released
Party shall have any further liability or obligation relating to or arising
out of this Agreement or the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement, except that the obligations under the Confidentiality Agreement
and the provisions of _Section 7.4_ (Public Announcements) and Article 10
(General Provisions) of this Agreement shall survive.

 

(d) Each of Frontier and Cowboy acknowledges that the agreements contained in
this _Section 9.3_ are an integral part of the transactions contemplated by
this Agreement, and that, without these agreements, the other party would not
enter into this Agreement. If Frontier fails promptly to pay any amounts due
pursuant to _Section 9.3(b)_, or Cowboy fails promptly to pay any amounts
due pursuant to _Section 9.3(c)_, and, in order to obtain such payment, the
other Party commences a suit that results in a judgment for the amounts set
forth in _Section 9.3(b)_ or _Section 9.3(c)_, as applicable, the Party
that has failed to pay any such amounts shall pay to the other Party its
reasonable costs and expenses (including reasonable attorneys fees and
expenses) in connection with such suit, together with interest on the amounts

Agreement may be amended by mutual agreement of the Parties by action taken
or authorized by the Frontier Board and the Cowboy Board, respectively, at any
time before or after receipt of the Frontier Stockholder Approval or the
Cowboy Shareholder Approval and prior to the Effective Time; _provided_ ,
that (a) after the Frontier Stockholder Approval has been

 



79  obtained, there shall not be (x) any amendment of this Agreement that would

the Frontier Governing Documents or the rules of the NASDAQ without such
further approval of such stockholders, or (y) any amendment or change not
permitted under applicable Law and (b) after the Cowboy Shareholder Approval
has been obtained, there shall not be (x) any amendment of this Agreement
that changes the amount or the form of the consideration to be delivered under
this Agreement to the holders of Cowboy Common Stock, or which by applicable
Law requires the further approval of the stockholders of Cowboy without such
further approval of such stockholders, or (y) any amendment or change not
permitted under applicable Law. This Agreement may not be amended except by an

Section 10.3 _Severability._ If any term or other provision of this Agreement
is invalid, illegal or incapable of being enforced under any present or
future Law, or public policy, (a) such term or other provision shall be fully
separable, (b) this Agreement shall be construed and enforced as if such
invalid, illegal or unenforceable provision had never comprised a part
hereof, and (c) all other conditions and provisions of this Agreement shall
remain in full force and effect and shall not be affected by the illegal,
invalid or unenforceable term or other provision or by its severance herefrom
so long as the economic or legal substance of the transactions contemplated
by this Agreement is not affected in any manner materially adverse to any
party. Upon such determination that any term or other provision is invalid,
illegal or incapable of being enforced, the Parties shall negotiate in good
faith to modify this Agreement so as to effect the original intent of the
Parties as closely as possible in a mutually acceptable manner in order that
transactions contemplated by this Agreement be consummated as originally
contemplated to the fullest extent possible.

Section 10.4 _Counterparts._ This Agreement may be executed in counterparts,
each of which shall be deemed an original and all of which together shall be
deemed one and the same agreement, and shall become effective when one or more
counterparts have been signed by each of the Parties and delivered (by
telecopy, electronic delivery or otherwise) to the other Parties. Signatures
to this Agreement transmitted by facsimile transmission, by electronic mail in
"portable document form" (" _pdf_ "), or by any other electronic means
intended to preserve the original graphic and pictorial appearance of a
document, will have the same effect as physical delivery of the paper document
bearing the original signature.

 

Section 10.5 _Entire Agreement; No Third-Party Beneficiaries._ This Agreement
(including the Exhibits, Schedules, the Frontier Disclosure Letter and the
Cowboy Disclosure Letter) and the Confidentiality Agreement (a) constitute the
entire agreement and supersede all prior agreements and understandings, both
written and oral, between the Parties with respect to the subject matter of
this Agreement and, (b) except for the provisions of _Section 7.7_ (which,
from and after the Effective Time shall be for the benefit of the Indemnified
Parties) are not intended to confer upon any Person other than the Parties
hereto any rights or remedies.

Section 10.6 _Extension; Waiver._ At any time prior to the Effective Time,
the Parties may, to the extent legally allowed and except as otherwise set
forth herein, (a) extend the time for the performance of any of the
obligations or other acts of the other Parties, (b) waive any inaccuracies in
the representations and warranties of the other Party contained in this
Agreement or in any document delivered pursuant to this Agreement or (c)
subject to the requirements of applicable Law, waive compliance with any of
the agreements or conditions contained in this Agreement. Any agreement on
the part of a Party to any such extension or waiver shall be valid only if set
forth in an instrument in writing signed on behalf of such Party. The failure
of any Party to this Agreement to assert any of its rights under this
Agreement or otherwise shall not constitute a waiver of those rights.

Section 10.7 _Governing Law; Venue._

 

(a) Except for the fiduciary duties of the Cowboy Board, the validity of any
corporate action on the part of Cowboy and the Merger, which, in each case,
shall be governed by, and construed in accordance with, the Laws of the State
of Texas, without regard to laws that may be applicable under conflicts of
laws principles that would cause the application of the Laws of any
jurisdiction other than the State of Texas to the foregoing, this Agreement
shall be governed by, and construed in accordance with, the Laws of the State
of Delaware, without

 



81  regard to laws that may be applicable under conflicts of laws principles
(whether of the State of Delaware or any other jurisdiction) that would cause
the application of the Laws of any jurisdiction other than the State of
Delaware.

(b) Each of the Parties hereby irrevocably and unconditionally submits, for
itself and its property, to the exclusive jurisdiction of the Court of
Chancery of the State of Delaware or, if such court shall not have
jurisdiction, any federal court of the United States of America, sitting in
Delaware, and any appellate court from any thereof, in any dispute arising
out of or relating to this Agreement or the transactions contemplated hereby
or for recognition or enforcement of any judgment relating thereto, and each
of the Parties hereby irrevocably and unconditionally (i) agrees not to
commence any dispute except in such courts, (ii) agrees that any claim in
respect of any such dispute may be heard and determined in the Court of
Chancery of the State of Delaware or, to the extent permitted by Law, in such
federal court, (iii) waives, to the fullest extent it may legally and
effectively do so, any objection which it may now or hereafter have to the
laying of venue of any such dispute in any such court, and (iv) waives, to the
fullest extent permitted by Law, the defense of an inconvenient forum to the
maintenance of such dispute in any such court. Each of the parties agrees that
a final judgment in any such dispute shall be conclusive and may be enforced
in other jurisdictions by suit on the judgment or in any other manner
provided by Law. Each Party irrevocably consents to service of process in the
manner provided for notices in _Section 10.2_. Nothing in this Agreement will
affect the right of any Party to serve process in any other manner permitted
by Law.

Section 10.8 _Assignment._ Neither this Agreement nor any of the
rights, interests or obligations under this Agreement shall be assigned or
delegated, in whole or in part, by operation of Law or otherwise by any of the
Parties without the prior written consent of the other Parties. This Agreement
will be binding upon, inure to the benefit of, and be enforceable by, the
Parties and their respective successors and assigns.

Section 10.9 _Specific Performance._ The Parties agree that irreparable
damage would occur if any of the provisions of this Agreement were not
performed in accordance with their specific terms or were otherwise breached,
and that monetary damages, even if available, would not be an adequate remedy

transaction of such other proper business as may come before such meetings at
such time, date and place as the Board shall determine by resolution. the Vice Chairman, the Chief Executive Officer or a committee of the Board
duly designated and whose powers and authority include the power to call
meetings may call special meetings of the Stockholders of the Corporation at
any time for any purpose or purposes. Special meetings of the Stockholders of
the Corporation may not be called by any other person or persons. 
---|--- 
 



   3.3 | _Place of Meetings_. The Stockholders shall hold all meetings at
such places, within or without the State of Delaware, as the Board or a
committee of the Board shall specify in the notice or waiver of notice
for such meetings. 
---|--- 



   3.4 | _Notice of Meetings_. Except as otherwise required by law, the
Board or a committee of the Board shall give notice of each meeting of
Stockholders, whether annual or special, not less that 10 nor more than 60
days before the date of the meeting. The Board or a committee of the Board
shall deliver a notice to each Stockholder entitled to vote at such meeting by
delivering a typewritten or printed notice thereof to him personally, or by
depositing such notice in the United States mail, in a postage prepaid
envelope, directed to him at his address as it appears on the records of the

hour of the meeting and, in the case of a special meeting, also shall state
the purpose or purposes of the meeting. Furthermore, if the Corporation will
maintain the list at a place other than where the meeting will take place,
every notice of a meeting of the Stockholders shall specify where the
Corporation will maintain the list of Stockholders entitled to vote at the
meeting.



   3.5 | _Stockholder Notice_. Stockholders who intend to nominate
persons to the Board of Directors or propose any other action at an annual
meeting of Stockholders must timely notify the Secretary of the Corporation
of such intent. To be timely, a Stockholders notice must be delivered to or
mailed and received at the principal executive offices of the Corporation not

meeting and the reasons for conducting such business at the meeting; (ii) the
name and record address of the Stockholder proposing such business; (iii) the

are beneficially owned by the Stockholder; and (iv) any material interest of
the Stockholder in such business. The Board of Directors reserves the right to
refuse to submit any such proposal to Stockholders at an annual meeting if,
in its judgment, the information provided in the notice is inaccurate or
incomplete. 
---|--- 



   3.6 | _Waiver of Notice_. Whenever these Bylaws require written
notice, a written waiver thereof, signed by the person entitled to notice,
whether before or after the time stated therein, shall constitute the
equivalent of notice. Attendance of a person at any meeting shall constitute
a waiver of notice of such meeting, except when the person attends the meeting
for the express purpose of objecting, at the beginning of the meeting, to the
transaction of any business because the meeting is not lawfully called or
convened. No written waiver of notice need specify either the business to be
transacted at, or the purpose or purposes of any regular or special meeting of
the Stockholders, directors or members of a committee of the Board. 
---|--- 
 



A-2 meeting to another time or place, notice need not be given of the adjourned
meeting if the time and place thereof are announced at the meeting at which
the adjournment is taken. At the adjourned meeting, the Stockholders may
transact any business which they may have transacted at the original meeting.
If the adjournment is for more than 30 days or, if after the adjournment, the
Board or a committee of the Board fixes a new record date for the adjourned
meeting, the Board or a committee of the Board shall give notice of the
adjourned meeting to each Stockholder of record entitled to vote at the
meeting. 
---|--- 
 



   3.8 | _Quorum_. Except as otherwise required by law, the holders of a
majority of all of the shares of the stock entitled to vote at the meeting,
present in person or by proxy, shall constitute a quorum for all purposes at
any meeting of the Stockholders. In the absence of a quorum at any meeting or
any adjournment thereof, the holders of a majority of the shares of stock
entitled to vote who are present, in person or by proxy, or, in the absence
therefrom of all the Stockholders, any officer entitled to preside at, or to
act as secretary of, such meeting may adjourn such meeting to another place,
date or time. 
---|--- 
 

If the chairman of the meeting gives notice of any adjourned special meeting
of Stockholders to all Stockholders entitled to vote thereat, stating that
the minimum percentage of Stockholders for a quorum as provided by Delaware
law shall constitute a quorum, then, except as otherwise required by law, that
percentage at such adjourned meeting shall constitute a quorum and a majority
of the votes cast at such meeting shall determine all matters.



   3.9 | _Organization_. Such person as the Board may have designated or,
in the absence of such a person, the highest ranking officer of the
Corporation who is present shall call to order any meeting of the
Stockholders, determine the presence of a quorum, and act as chairman of the
meeting. In the absence of the Secretary or an Assistant Secretary of the
Corporation, the chairman shall appoint someone to act as the secretary of the
meeting. 
---|--- 
 



   3.10 | _Conduct of Business_. The chairman of any meeting of
Stockholders shall determine the order of business and the procedure at the
meeting, including such regulations of the manner of voting and the conduct
of discussion as he deems in order. 
---|--- 



   3.11 | _List of Stockholders_. At least 10 days before every meeting
of Stockholders, the Secretary shall prepare a list of the Stockholders
entitled to vote at the meeting or any adjournment thereof, arranged
in alphabetical order, showing the address of each Stockholder and the number
of shares registered in the name of each Stockholder. The Corporation shall
make the list available for examination by any Stockholder for any purpose
germane to the meeting, during ordinary business hours, for a period of at
least 10 days prior to the meeting, either at a place within the city where
the meeting will take place or at the place designated in the notice of the
meeting. 
---|--- 
 

The Secretary shall produce and keep the list at the time and place of the
meeting during the entire duration of the meeting, and any Stockholder who is
present may inspect the list at the meeting. The list shall constitute
presumptive proof of the identity of the Stockholders entitled to vote at the
meeting and the number of shares each Stockholder holds.

 

A determination of Stockholders entitled to vote at any meeting of
Stockholders pursuant to this Section shall apply to any adjournment thereof.



   3.12 | _Fixing of Record Date_. For the purpose of determining
Stockholders entitled to notice of or to vote at any meeting of Stockholders
or any adjournment thereof, or Stockholders entitled to receive payment of
any dividend, or in order to make a determination of Stockholders for any
other proper purpose, the Board or a committee of the Board may fix in advance
a date as the record date for any such determination of Stockholders. However,
the Board shall not fix such date, in any case, more than 60 days nor less
than 10 days prior to the date of the particular action. 
---|--- 
 



A-3 If the Board or a committee of the Board does not fix a record date for
the determination of Stockholders entitled to notice of or to vote at a
meeting of Stockholders, the record date shall be at the close of business on
the day next preceding the day on which notice is given or if notice is
waived, at the close of business on the day next preceding the day on which
the meeting is held or the date on which the Board adopts the resolution
declaring a dividend.



   3.13 | _Voting of Shares_. Each Stockholder shall have one vote for
every share of stock having voting rights registered in his name on the record
date for the meeting. The Corporation shall not have the right to
vote treasury stock of the Corporation, nor shall another corporation have
the right to vote its stock of the Corporation if the Corporation holds,
directly or indirectly, a majority of the shares entitled to vote in the
election of directors of such other corporation. Persons holding stock of the
Corporation in a fiduciary capacity shall have the right to vote such stock.
Persons who have pledged their stock of the Corporation shall have the right
to vote such stock unless in the transfer on the books of the Corporation the
pledgor expressly empowered the pledgee to vote such stock. In that event,
only the pledgee, or his proxy, may represent such stock and vote thereon. 
---|--- 
 

A plurality of the votes of the shares present in person or represented by
proxy at the meeting and entitled to vote shall determine all elections and,
except when the law or Certificate of Incorporation requires otherwise, the
affirmative vote of a majority of the shares present in person or represented
by proxy at the meeting and entitled to vote shall determine all other
matters.

Where a separate vote by a class or classes is required, a majority of the
outstanding shares of such class or classes, present in person or represented
by proxy, shall constitute a quorum entitled to take action with respect to
that vote on that matter and the affirmative vote of the majority of shares of
such class or classes present in person or represented by proxy at the
meeting shall be the act of such class.

The Stockholders may vote by voice vote on all matters. Upon demand by a
Stockholder entitled to vote, or his proxy, the Stockholders shall vote by
ballot. In that event, each ballot shall state the name of the Stockholder or
proxy voting, the number of shares voted and such other information as the
Corporation may require under the procedure established for the meeting.



   3.14 | _Inspectors_. At any meeting in which the Stockholders vote by
ballot, the chairman may appoint one or more inspectors. Each inspector shall
take and sign an oath to execute the duties of inspector at such
meeting faithfully, with strict impartiality, and according to the best of
his ability. The inspectors shall ascertain the number of shares outstanding
and the voting power of each; determine the shares represented at a meeting
and the validity of proxies and ballots; count all votes and ballots;
determine and retain for a reasonable period a record of the disposition of
any challenges made to any determination by the inspectors; and certify their
determination of the number of shares represented at the meeting, and their
count of all votes and ballots. The certification required herein shall take
the form of a subscribed, written report prepared by the inspectors and
delivered to the Secretary of the Corporation. An inspector need not be
a Stockholder of the Corporation, and any officer of the Corporation may be
an inspector on any question other than a vote for or against a proposal in
which he has a material interest. 
---|--- 
 



   3.15 | _Proxies_. A Stockholder may exercise any voting rights in
person or by his proxy appointed by an instrument in writing, which he or his
authorized attorney-in-fact has subscribed and which the proxy has
delivered to the secretary of the meeting pursuant to the manner prescribed
by law. 
---|--- 

A proxy is not valid after the expiration of three years after the date of
its execution, unless the person executing it specifies thereon the length of
time for which it is to continue in force (which length may exceed three
years) or limits its use to a particular meeting. Each proxy is irrevocable
if it expressly states that it is irrevocable and if, and only as long as, it
is coupled with an interest sufficient in law to support an irrevocable power.

 



A-4 The attendance at any meeting of a Stockholder who previously has given a
proxy shall not have the effect of revoking the same unless he notifies the
Secretary in writing prior to the voting of the proxy.

Corporation shall indemnify any person who was or is a party or is threatened
to be made a party to any threatened, pending or completed action, suit or
proceeding, whether civil, criminal, administrative or investigative (other
than an action by or in the right of the Corporation) by reason of the fact
that he is or was a Stockholder, director, officer, employee or agent of the
Corporation, or is or was serving at the request of the Corporation as a
director, officer, employee or agent of another corporation, partnership,
joint venture, trust or other enterprise or as a member of any committee or
similar body, against expenses (including attorneys fees), judgments, fines
and amounts paid in settlement actually and reasonably incurred by him in
connection with such action, suit or proceeding if he acted in good faith and
in a manner he reasonably believed to be in or not opposed to the best
interests of the Corporation, and, with respect to any criminal action or
proceeding, had no reasonable cause to believe his conduct was unlawful. The
termination of any action, suit or proceeding by judgment, order,
settlement, conviction, or upon a plea of _nolo contendere_ or its
equivalent, shall not create, of itself, a presumption that the person did not
act in good faith and in a manner which he reasonably believed to be in or not
opposed to the best interests of the Corporation, and, with respect to any
criminal action or proceeding, that he had reasonable cause to believe that
his conduct was unlawful. 
---|--- 



   10.2 | _Actions By or In the Right of the Corporation_. The
Corporation shall indemnify any person who was or is a party or is threatened
to be made a party to any threatened, pending or completed action or suit by
or in the right of the Corporation to procure a judgment in its favor by
reason of the fact that he is or was a Stockholder, director, officer,
employee or agent of the Corporation, or is or was serving at the request of
the Corporation as a Stockholder, director, officer, employee or agent of
another corporation, partnership, joint venture, trust or other enterprise, or
as a member or any committee or similar body, against expenses (including
attorneys fees) actually and reasonably incurred by him in connection with
the defense or settlement of such action or suit if he acted in good faith and
in a manner he reasonably believed to be in or not opposed to the best
interest of the Corporation, except that the Corporation shall make
no indemnification in respect of any claim, issue or matter as to which such
person shall have been adjudged to be liable for negligence or misconduct in
the performance of his duty to the Corporation unless and only to the extent
that the court in which such action or suit was brought shall determine upon
application that, despite the adjudication of liability but in view of all the
circumstances of the case, such person is fairly and reasonably entitled to
indemnity for such expenses which the court shall deem proper. 
---|--- 



   10.3 | _Determination of Right to Indemnification_. The Corporation
shall not indemnify any person under Section 10.01 or Section 10.02, in the
absence of a court order, unless authorized in the specific case upon a
determination that the director, officer, employee or agent has met the
applicable standard of conduct set forth in Section 10.01 or Section 10.02.
One of the following shall make the determination: (a) the Board, by a
majority vote of a quorum of directors not a party to the action, suit or
proceeding; (b) absent a quorum or at the direction of a quorum of
disinterested directors, independent legal counsel, by a written opinion; or
(c) the Stockholders.

been successful on the merits or otherwise in defense of any action, suit or
proceeding referred to in Section 10.01 or Section 10.02 of these Bylaws, or
in defense of any claim, issue or matter therein, the Corporation shall
indemnify him against expenses (including attorneys fees) which he actually
and reasonably has incurred in connection therewith. 
---|--- 
 



A-11 determines that the Corporation should not indemnify any person pursuant to
the provisions of this Article 10, the Corporation nevertheless may pay his
expenses incurred in defending an action or proceeding in advance of the
final disposition of such action or proceeding upon specific authorization by
the Board and upon his delivery to the Board of an undertaking to repay such
amount. 
---|--- 
 



   10.6 | _Other Rights and Remedies_. The indemnification provided by
this Article 10 shall not be deemed exclusive and is declared expressly to be
nonexclusive of any other rights to which those seeking indemnification
may be entitled under any bylaw, agreement, vote of Stockholders or
disinterested directors or otherwise, both as to actions in his official
capacity and as to actions in another capacity while holding such office. In
addition, the indemnification, provided by this Article 10 shall continue as
to any person who has ceased to be a director, officer, employee or agent and
shall inure to the benefit of the heirs, executors and administrators of such
a person.

was serving at the request of the Corporation as a Stockholder, director,
officer, employee or agent of another corporation, partnership, joint venture,
trust or other enterprise or as a member of any committee or similar body,
against any liability asserted against him and incurred by him in any such
capacity, or arising out of his status as such, whether or not the Corporation
would have the power to indemnify him against such liability under the
provision of this Article 10.

10, references to "the Corporation" include in addition to the resulting
corporation, any constituent corporation (including any constituent of a
constituent) absorbed in a consolidation or merger which, if its separate
existence had continued, would have had power and authority to indemnify its
directors, officers and employees or agents, so that any person who is or was
a director, officer, employee or agent of such constituent corporation or is
or was serving at the request of such constituent corporation as a director,
officer, employee or agent of another corporation, partnership, joint venture,
trust or other enterprise or as a member of any committee or similar body,
shall stand in the same position under the provisions of this Article 10 with
respect to the resulting or surviving corporation as he would have with
respect to such constituent corporation if its existence had continued. 
---|--- 



   10.9 | _Other Insurance_. The Corporation shall reduce the amount of
the indemnification of any person pursuant to the provisions of this Article
10 by the amount which such person collects as indemnification (a) under any
policy of insurance which the Corporation purchased and maintained on his
behalf or (b) from another corporation, partnership, joint venture, trust or
other enterprise. 
---|--- 
 



   10.10 | _Public Policy_. Nothing contained in this Article 10, or
elsewhere in these Bylaws, shall operate to indemnify any director or officer
if such indemnification is contrary to law, either as a matter of

as amended, the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, or any other
