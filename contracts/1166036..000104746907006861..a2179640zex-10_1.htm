its Subsidiaries (its "Plans"), to the extent subject to ERISA, are in material compliance with ERISA, the Code, and other applicable laws and, to the knowledge of Hydrocarbon, no prohibited
transaction has occurred with respect to any such employee benefit plan that would result in any material excise Tax or other material liability under ERISA or the Code. Each Compensation and Benefit

made if such transfer would (i)&nbsp;violate the then applicable federal or state securities laws or rules and regulations of the Commission, any state securities commission or any other
governmental authority with jurisdiction over such transfer, (ii)&nbsp;terminate the existence or qualification of the Partnership or the Operating Company under the laws of the jurisdiction of its

amendments to this Agreement as the General Partner may determine to be necessary or appropriate to impose such restrictions; </FONT><FONT SIZE=2><I>provided, however</I></FONT><FONT SIZE=2>, that
any amendment that the General Partner believes, in the exercise of its reasonable discretion, could result in the delisting or suspension of trading of any class of Limited Partner Interests on the
principal National Securities Exchange on which such class of Limited Partner Interests is then traded must be approved, prior to such amendment being effected, by the holders of at least a majority

contemporaneously therewith, appropriate cash distributions must be made to the other Partners. The Liquidator may, in its absolute discretion, defer liquidation or distribution of the Partnership's
assets for a reasonable time if it determines that an immediate sale or distribution of all or some of the Partnership's assets would be impractical or would cause undue loss to the Partners. The

due and payable, the Liquidator shall either settle such claim for such amount as it thinks appropriate or establish a reserve of cash or other assets to provide for its payment. When paid, any unused
portion of the reserve shall be distributed as additional liquidation proceeds. </FONT></P>
