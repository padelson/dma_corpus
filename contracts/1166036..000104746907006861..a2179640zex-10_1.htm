ARTICLE III 

REDEMPTION AND MERGER CONSIDERATION; EXCHANGE PROCEDURES 

  

 Section 3.1 _ Redemption and Merger Consideration_. Subject to the provisions of this Agreement: 

  

 (a) By virtue of the Redemption, each Redemption Share shall be redeemed upon the effectiveness of the Charter Amendment immediately prior to the Effective Time for cash in an amount having a value equal to the Per Share Consideration in the Redemption (the "Per Share Cash Consideration"). 

   

 (b) By virtue of the Merger, at the Effective Time each share of Hydrocarbon Common Stock issued and outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time that has not been redeemed pursuant to the Redemption (other than Treasury Shares, shares held by Energy Partners or its Subsidiaries and, to the fullest extent permitted by law, shares of Dissenting Holders and Hydrocarbon Restricted Stock) shall be converted into the Per Share Unit Consideration. The Per Share Unit Consideration, together with the Per Share Cash Consideration, shall be referred to herein as the "Redemption/Merger Consideration." 

  

 (c) By virtue of the Redemption, the Total Cash Amount deposited by Hydrocarbon with the Redemption/Exchange Agent will be used to redeem shares of Hydrocarbon Common Stock and such shares of Hydrocarbon Common Stock shall be treated as redeemed and canceled immediately prior to the Merger. 

  

 (d) By virtue of the Merger, all of the limited liability company interests in MergerCo outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time shall be converted into and become 1,000 fully paid and nonassessable shares of common stock of the Surviving Corporation. 

  

 (e) By virtue of the Merger, each Treasury Share and each share of Hydrocarbon Common Stock owned by Energy Partners or its Subsidiaries shall cease to be outstanding and shall be canceled without payment of any consideration therefor, and no partnership interest of Energy Partners or other consideration shall be delivered in exchange therefor. 

  

 (f) All shares of Hydrocarbon Common Stock, when redeemed in the Redemption or converted in the Merger, shall cease to be outstanding and shall automatically be canceled and cease to exist. Each holder of a certificate (a "Certificate") previously representing any such shares shall cease to have any rights with respect thereto, except the right to receive (i) the Redemption/Merger Consideration, (ii) any distributions in accordance with Section 3.5(c) and (iii) any cash to be paid in lieu of any fractional Common Unit in accordance with Section 3.5(e), in each case to be issued or paid in consideration therefor upon the surrender of such Certificates in accordance with Section 3.5. 

  

 Section 3.2 _ Election Procedures_. 

  

 (a) An election form and other appropriate and customary transmittal materials (which shall specify that delivery shall be effected, and risk of loss and title to the Certificates theretofore representing shares of Hydrocarbon Common Stock shall pass, only upon proper delivery of such Certificates to the Redemption/Exchange Agent) in such form as Energy Partners and Hydrocarbon shall mutually agree (the "Election Form") and pursuant to which each holder of record of shares of Hydrocarbon Common Stock as of the close of business on the Election Deadline may make an election pursuant to this Section 3.2, shall be mailed at the same time as the Joint Proxy Statement or 

        
  

at such other time as Hydrocarbon and Energy Partners may agree (the date on
which such mailing is commenced or such other agreed date, the "Mailing Date")
to each holder of record of Hydrocarbon Common Stock as of the close of
business on the record date for notice of the Hydrocarbon Meeting (the
"Election Form Record Date").

   

 (b) Each Election Form shall permit the holder (or the beneficial owner through appropriate and customary documentation and instructions), other than any holder of Appraisal Shares, to specify (i) the number of such holder\'s shares of Hydrocarbon Common Stock with respect to which such holder elects to have redeemed for the Per Share Cash Consideration in the Redemption ("Cash Election Shares"), (ii) the number of such holder\'s shares of Hydrocarbon Common Stock with respect to which such holder elects to have exchanged for the Per Share Unit Consideration in the Merger ("Unit Election Shares"), (iii) the number of such holder\'s shares of Hydrocarbon Common Stock with respect to which such holder elects to receive the Stated Consideration (the "Stated Consideration Shares"), a portion of which shares shall be Stated Consideration Cash Shares to be redeemed for the Per Share Cash Consideration in the Redemption, and a portion of which shares shall be Stated Consideration Unit Shares to be exchanged for the Per Share Unit Consideration in the Merger, both as provided for herein, and (iv) the number of such holder\'s shares of Hydrocarbon Common Stock with respect to which such holder makes no election ("Non-Electing Shares"). For each holder electing to receive the Stated Consideration, (x) that number of such holder\'s Stated Consideration Shares equal to the quotient obtained by dividing (1) the product of the Per Share Stated Cash Consideration multiplied by the number of such holder\'s Stated Consideration Shares by (2) the Per Share Cash Consideration, rounded to the nearest whole share, shall be deemed "Stated Consideration Cash Shares" hereunder and (y) that number of such holder\'s Stated Consideration Shares equal to (1) the number of such holder\'s Stated Consideration Shares minus (2) the number of such holder\'s Stated Consideration Cash Shares shall be deemed "Stated Consideration Unit Shares" hereunder. Any Hydrocarbon Common Stock with respect to which the Redemption/Exchange Agent has not received an effective, properly completed Election Form on or before 5:00 p.m., New York City time, on the 33rd day following the Mailing Date (or such other time and date as Hydrocarbon and Energy Partners shall agree) (the "Election Deadline") (other than any shares of Hydrocarbon Common Stock that constitute Appraisal Shares as of such time) shall also be deemed to be Non-Electing Shares. In addition, any shares of Hydrocarbon Common Stock treated as outstanding upon the exercise of Hydrocarbon Stock Options pursuant to Section 3.7(a) shall be deemed to be Non-Electing Shares. 

  

 (c) Hydrocarbon and Energy Partners shall mail one or more Election Forms as may reasonably be requested from time to time by all Persons who become holders (or beneficial owners) of Hydrocarbon Common Stock between the Election Form Record Date and the close of business on the Business Day prior to the Election Deadline. Hydrocarbon shall provide to the Redemption/Exchange Agent all information reasonably necessary for it to perform as specified herein. 

  

 (d) Any such election shall have been properly made only if the Redemption/Exchange Agent shall have actually received a properly completed Election Form by the Election Deadline. An Election Form shall be deemed properly completed only if accompanied by (i) one or more Certificates (or customary affidavits and indemnification regarding the loss or destruction of such Certificates or the guaranteed delivery of such Certificates) representing all certificated shares of Hydrocarbon Common Stock covered by such Election Form or (ii) in the case of shares in book-entry form, any additional documents specified by the procedures set forth in the Election Form, together with duly executed transmittal materials included in the Election Form. Any Election Form may be revoked or changed by the Person submitting such Election Form prior to the Election Deadline. In the event an Election Form is revoked prior to the Election Deadline, the shares of Hydrocarbon Common Stock represented by such Election Form shall become Non-Electing Shares and Energy Partners shall cause the Certificates, if any, representing Hydrocarbon Common Stock to be promptly returned without charge to the Person submitting the Election Form upon written request to that effect from the holder who 

        
  

submitted the Election Form, except to the extent (if any) a subsequent
election is properly made with respect to any or all of the applicable shares
of Hydrocarbon Common Stock. Subject to the terms of this Agreement and of
the Election Form, the Redemption/Exchange Agent shall have reasonable
discretion to determine whether any election, revocation or change has been
properly or timely made and to disregard immaterial defects in the Election
Forms, and any good faith decisions of the Redemption/Exchange Agent regarding
such matters shall be binding and conclusive. None of Energy
Partners, MergerCo or the Redemption/Exchange Agent shall be under any
obligation to notify any Person of any defect in an Election Form.

  

 (e) Within ten Business Days after the Election Deadline, unless the Effective Time has not yet occurred, in which case as soon after the Effective Time as practicable (and in no event more than ten Business Days after the Effective Time), Hydrocarbon and Energy Partners shall cause the Redemption/Exchange Agent to effect the allocation among the holders of shares of Hydrocarbon Common Stock of rights to receive cash in the Redemption or Common Units in the Merger in accordance with the Election Forms (subject to compliance with the provisions of this Agreement) as follows: 

  

  

 (i) _ Cash Election Shares More Than Total Remaining Cash Amount_. If the aggregate cash amount that would be paid upon the redemption of the Cash Election Shares in the Redemption is greater than the Total Remaining Cash Amount, then: 

    

 (A)

 all Unit Election Shares, Stated Consideration Unit Shares and Non-Electing Shares shall be exchanged for the Per Share Unit Consideration in the Merger,  


(B)

 the Redemption/Exchange Agent shall then select from among the Cash Election Shares, by a pro rata selection process based on the number of shares held by a stockholder, a sufficient number of shares ("Unit Designated Shares") such that the aggregate cash amount that will be paid in the Redemption equals as closely as practicable the Total Cash Amount (such calculation to take into consideration the number of Stated Consideration Cash Shares and the Total Stated Cash Consideration Amount), and all Unit Designated Shares shall be exchanged for the Per Share Unit Consideration in the Merger, and  


(C)

 all Stated Consideration Cash Shares and those Cash Election Shares that are not Unit Designated Shares shall be redeemed at a redemption price per share equal to the Per Share Cash Consideration in the Redemption. 
   

   

 (ii) _ Cash Election Shares Less Than Total Remaining Cash Amount_. If the aggregate cash amount that would be paid upon the redemption of the Cash Election Shares in the Redemption is less than the Total Remaining Cash Amount, then: 

    

 (A)

 all Cash Election Shares and Stated Consideration Cash Shares shall be redeemed at a redemption price per share equal to the Per Share Cash Consideration in the Redemption,  


(B)

 the Redemption/Exchange Agent shall then select first from among the Non-Electing Shares and then (if necessary) from among the Unit Election Shares, by a pro rata selection process based on the number of shares held by a stockholder, a sufficient number of shares ("Cash Designated Shares") such that the aggregate cash amount that will be paid in the Redemption equals as closely as practicable the Total Cash Amount (such calculation to take into consideration the number of Stated Consideration Cash Shares and the Total Stated Cash Consideration Amount), and all Cash Designated Shares shall be redeemed at a redemption price per share equal to the Per Share Cash Consideration in the Redemption, and 
   

      

     

 (C)

 all Stated Consideration Unit Shares and those Unit Election Shares and the Non-Electing Shares that are not Cash Designated Shares shall be exchanged for the Per Share Unit Consideration in the Merger. 
   

  
 

  

 (iii) _ Cash Election Shares Equal to Total Remaining Cash Amount_. If the aggregate cash amount that would be paid upon the redemption of the Cash Election Shares in the Redemption is equal to the Total Remaining Cash Amount, then subparagraphs (i) and (ii) above shall not apply and all Cash Election Shares and Stated Consideration Cash Shares shall be redeemed at a redemption price per share equal to the Per Share Cash Consideration in the Redemption and all Unit Election Shares, Stated Consideration Unit Shares and Non-Electing Shares shall be exchanged for the Per Share Unit Consideration in the Merger. 

  

  

 Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the contrary, to the fullest extent permitted by law, for purposes of determining the allocations set forth in this Section 3.2, Energy Partners shall have the right to require, but not the obligation to require, that any shares of Hydrocarbon Common Stock that constitute Appraisal Shares as of the Election Deadline be treated as Cash Election Shares but not be subject to the pro rata selection process contemplated by this Section 3.2, and, if Energy Partners so requires, then, to the fullest extent permitted by law, any Appraisal Shares that receive the Redemption/Merger Consideration provided under this Article III shall be treated as Cash Election Shares but not be subject to the pro rata selection process contemplated by this Section 3.2. 

  

 (f) The pro rata selection process to be used by the Redemption/Exchange Agent shall consist of such equitable pro ration processes as shall be mutually determined by Energy Partners and Hydrocarbon. 

  

 Section 3.3 _ Appraisal Rights_. Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the contrary, shares of Hydrocarbon Common Stock issued and outstanding immediately prior to the filing of the Redemption Charter Amendment or the Effective Time that are held by any record holder who is entitled to demand and properly demands appraisal of such shares pursuant to, and who complies in all respects with, the provisions of Section 262 of the DGCL (the "Appraisal Shares") shall not be converted into the right to receive the Redemption/Merger Consideration, but instead shall become the right to payment of the fair value of such shares in accordance with the provisions of Section 262 of the DGCL and the Redemption Charter Amendment and at the filing of the Redemption Charter Amendment or the Effective Time, all Appraisal Shares shall no longer be outstanding and shall automatically be canceled and cease to exist. Notwithstanding the foregoing, if any such holder shall fail to perfect or otherwise shall waive, withdraw or lose the right to appraisal under Section 262 of the DGCL or a court of competent jurisdiction shall determine that such holder is not entitled to the relief provided by Section 262 of the DGCL, then the right of such holder to be paid the fair value of such holder\'s Appraisal Shares under Section 262 of the DGCL and the Redemption Charter Amendment shall be forfeited and cease and if such forfeiture shall occur following the Election Deadline, each of such holder\'s Appraisal Shares, to the extent permitted by law, shall be treated as Non-Electing Shares or pursuant to Section 3.2(e) as Cash Election Shares. Hydrocarbon shall deliver prompt notice to Energy Partners of any demands for appraisal of any shares of Hydrocarbon Common Stock and provide Energy Partners with the opportunity to participate in all negotiations and proceedings with respect to demands for appraisal. Prior to the Effective Time, Hydrocarbon shall not, without the prior written consent of Energy Partners, make any payment with respect to, or settle or offer to settle, any such demands, or agree to do any of the foregoing. 

   

 Section 3.4 _ Rights As Stockholders; Stock Transfers_. After the Redemption or the Effective Time, as the case may be, holders of Hydrocarbon Common Stock shall cease to be, and shall have no rights, as stockholders of Hydrocarbon, other than to receive (a) any dividend or other distribution with respect to such Hydrocarbon Common Stock with a record date occurring prior to the Effective Time that may have been declared or made by Hydrocarbon on such shares of Hydrocarbon Common Stock 

        
  

in accordance with the terms of this Agreement or prior to the date hereof
and which remain unpaid at the Effective Time and (b) the consideration
provided under this Article III. After the Effective Time, there shall be no
transfers on the stock transfer books of the shares of Hydrocarbon Common
Stock.

  

 Section 3.5 _ Exchange of Certificates_. 

  

 (a) _ Redemption/Exchange Agent_. Hydrocarbon shall irrevocably deposit with the Redemption/Exchange Agent an amount in cash that shall be sufficient to effect the Redemption, and Energy Partners shall deposit or shall cause to be deposited the Common Units for the Merger with the Redemption/Exchange Agent, in each case for the benefit of the holders of shares of Hydrocarbon Common Stock and both of which together shall be used to make all deliveries of cash and the Common Units as required by and pursuant to this Article III. Energy Partners agrees to make available to the Redemption/Exchange Agent, from time to time as needed, cash sufficient to pay any distributions pursuant to Section 3.5(c) and to make payments in lieu of any fractional Common Units pursuant to Section 3.5(e). Any cash and Common Units deposited with the Redemption/Exchange Agent (including as payment for any fractional Common Units in accordance with Section 3.5(e) and any distributions in accordance with Section 3.5(c)) shall hereinafter be referred to as the "Exchange Fund." The Redemption/Exchange Agent shall, pursuant to irrevocable instructions, deliver the Redemption/Merger Consideration contemplated to be paid for shares of Hydrocarbon Common Stock pursuant to this Agreement, both through the Redemption and through the Merger, out of the Exchange Fund. Except as contemplated by Sections 3.5(c) and 3.5(e) hereof, the Exchange Fund shall not be used for any other purpose. 

  

 (b) _ Exchange Procedures_. Promptly after the Effective Time, Energy Partners shall instruct the Redemption/Exchange Agent to mail to each record holder of Certificates (other than such holders who have properly completed an Election form and elected the shares with respect to such Certificates as Cash Election Shares, Unit Election Shares, Stated Consideration Shares or Non-Electing Shares in accordance with Section 3.2 and other than Appraisal Shares), (i) a letter of transmittal (which shall specify that delivery shall be effected, and risk of loss and title to the Certificates shall pass, only upon proper delivery of the Certificates to the Redemption/Exchange Agent, and shall be in customary form and agreed to by Energy Partners and Hydrocarbon prior to the Effective Time) and (ii) instructions for use in effecting the surrender of the Certificates in exchange for the Redemption/Merger Consideration payable in respect of the shares of Hydrocarbon Common Stock represented by such Certificates. Promptly after the Effective Time, upon surrender of Certificates for cancellation to the Redemption/Exchange Agent together with such letters of transmittal, properly completed and duly executed, and such other documents as may be required pursuant to such instructions, the holders of such Certificates and the holders of Certificates who previously surrendered Certificates to the Redemption/Exchange Agent with properly completed and duly executed Election Forms shall be entitled to receive in exchange therefor (A) Common Units representing, in the aggregate, the whole number of Common Units that such holder has the right to receive pursuant to this Article III (after taking into account all shares of Hydrocarbon Common Stock then held by such holder) and (B) a check in the amount equal to the aggregate amount of cash that such holder has the right to receive pursuant to this Article III, including cash payable in lieu of any fractional Common Units pursuant to Section 3.5(e) and distributions pursuant to Section 3.5(c). No interest shall be paid or accrued on any Redemption/Merger Consideration, cash in lieu of fractional shares or on any unpaid dividends and distributions payable to holders of Certificates. In the event of a transfer of ownership of shares of Hydrocarbon Common Stock which is not registered in the transfer records of Hydrocarbon, the Redemption/Merger Consideration payable in respect of such shares of Hydrocarbon Common Stock may be paid to a transferee if the Certificate representing such shares of Hydrocarbon Common Stock is presented to the Redemption/Exchange Agent, accompanied by all documents required to evidence and effect such transfer and the Person requesting such exchange shall pay to the Redemption/Exchange Agent in advance any transfer or other Taxes required by reason of the delivery of the 

        
  

Redemption/Merger Consideration in any name other than that of the registered
holder of the Certificate surrendered, or shall establish to the satisfaction
of the Redemption/Exchange Agent that such Taxes have been paid or are not
payable. Until surrendered as contemplated by this Section 3.5, each
Certificate other than Certificates representing Appraisal Shares shall be
deemed at any time after the Effective Time to represent only the right to
receive upon such surrender the Redemption/Merger Consideration payable in
respect of the shares of Hydrocarbon Common Stock represented by such
Certificate and any distributions to which such holder is entitled pursuant to
Section 3.4.

   

 (c) _ Distributions with Respect to Unexchanged Common Units_. No distributions declared or made with respect to Common Units with a record date after the Effective Time shall be paid to the holder of any unsurrendered Certificate representing Hydrocarbon Common Stock with respect to the Common Units that such holder would be entitled to receive upon surrender of such Certificate and no cash payment in lieu of fractional Common Units shall be paid to any such holder until such holder shall surrender such Certificate in accordance with this Section 3.5. Subject to applicable law, following surrender of any such Certificate, there shall be paid to such holder of the Common Units issuable in exchange therefor, without interest, (i) promptly after the time of such surrender, the amount of any cash due pursuant to Section 3.2 and cash payable in lieu of fractional Common Units to which such holder is entitled pursuant to Section 3.5(e) and the amount of distributions with a record date after the Effective Time theretofore paid with respect to the Common Units and payable with respect to such Common Units, and (ii) at the appropriate payment date, the amount of distributions with a record date after the Effective Time but prior to such surrender and a payment date subsequent to such surrender payable with respect to such Common Units. 

  

 (d) _ No Further Rights in Hydrocarbon Common Stock_. The Redemption/Merger Consideration delivered or issued, as the case may be, in accordance with the terms hereof (including any cash paid pursuant to Section 3.4, Section 3.5(c) or Section 3.5(e)) shall be deemed to have been issued in full satisfaction of all rights pertaining to such share of Hydrocarbon Common Stock. 

  

 (e) _ Fractional Common Units_. No certificates or scrip of the Common Units representing fractional Common Units or book entry credit of the same shall be issued upon the surrender for exchange of Certificates in the Merger, and such fractional interests will not entitle the owner thereof to vote or to have any rights as a holder of any Common Units. Notwithstanding any other provision of this Agreement, each holder of shares of Hydrocarbon Common Stock exchanged in the Merger who would otherwise have been entitled to receive a fraction of a Common Unit (after taking into account all Certificates delivered by such holder) shall receive, in lieu thereof, cash (without interest rounded up to the nearest whole cent) in an amount equal to the product of (i) the closing sale price of the Common Units on the NYSE as reported by _The Wall Street Journal_ on the trading day immediately preceding the date on which the Effective Time shall occur and (ii) the fraction of a Common Unit that such holder would otherwise be entitled to receive pursuant to this Article III. As promptly as practicable after the determination of the amount of cash, if any, to be paid to holders of fractional interests, the Redemption/Exchange Agent shall so notify Energy Partners, and it shall, or shall cause the Surviving Entity to, deposit such amount with the Redemption/Exchange Agent and shall cause the Redemption/Exchange Agent to forward payments to such holders of fractional interests subject to and in accordance with the terms hereof. 

  

 (f) _ Termination of Exchange Fund with Respect to Merger_. Any portion of the Exchange Fund constituting Common Units that remains undistributed to the holders of Hydrocarbon Common Stock in the Merger after 180 days following the Effective Time shall be delivered to Energy Partners upon demand and, from and after such delivery, any former holders of Hydrocarbon Common Stock (other than Appraisal Shares) who have not theretofore complied with this Article III shall thereafter look only to Energy Partners for the Redemption/Merger Consideration payable in the Merger in respect of such shares of Hydrocarbon Common Stock, any cash in lieu of fractional Common Units to which they are entitled pursuant to Section 3.5(e) and any distributions with respect to the Common Units to 

        
  

which they are entitled pursuant to Section 3.5(c), in each case, without any
interest thereon. Any amounts remaining unclaimed by holders of shares of
Hydrocarbon Common Stock immediately prior to such time as such amounts would
otherwise escheat to or become the property of any governmental entity shall,
to the extent permitted by applicable law, become the property of Energy
Partners or Hydrocarbon, as the case may be, free and clear of any Liens,
claims or interest of any Person previously entitled thereto.

  

 (g) _ No Liability_. Neither Energy Partners, Hydrocarbon, nor the Surviving Entity shall be liable to any holder of shares of Hydrocarbon Common Stock for any Common Units (or distributions with respect thereto) or cash from the Exchange Fund delivered to a public official pursuant to any abandoned property, escheat or similar law. 

  

 (h) _ Lost Certificates_. If any Certificate shall have been lost, stolen or destroyed, upon the making of an affidavit of that fact by the Person claiming such Certificate to be lost, stolen or destroyed and, if required by Hydrocarbon or Energy Partners, the posting by such Person of a bond, in such reasonable amount as Hydrocarbon or Energy Partners may direct, as indemnity against any claim that may be made against it with respect to such Certificate, the Redemption/Exchange Agent shall pay in exchange for such lost, stolen or destroyed Certificate the Redemption/Merger Consideration payable in respect of the shares of Hydrocarbon Common Stock represented by such Certificate and any distributions to which the holders thereof are entitled pursuant to Section 3.4. 

   

 (i) _ Withholding_. Each of Hydrocarbon, Energy Partners, the Surviving Entity and the Redemption/Exchange Agent shall be entitled to deduct and withhold from the consideration otherwise payable pursuant to this Agreement to any holder of Hydrocarbon Common Stock such amounts as Hydrocarbon, Energy Partners, the Surviving Entity or the Redemption/Exchange Agent is required to deduct and withhold under the Code or any provision of state, local, or foreign Tax law, with respect to the making of such payment. To the extent that amounts are so withheld, such withheld amounts shall be treated for all purposes of this Agreement as having been paid to the holder of Hydrocarbon Common Stock in respect of whom such deduction and withholding was made by Hydrocarbon, Energy Partners, the Surviving Entity or the Redemption/Exchange Agent, as the case may be. 

  

 (j) _ Book Entry of Common Units_. All Common Units to be issued in the Merger shall be issued in book entry form, without physical certificates. 

  

 Section 3.6 _ Anti-Dilution Provisions_.

 (v) All contributions, premiums and payments required to be made under the terms of any Compensation and Benefit Plan of it or any of its Subsidiaries have been made. 

   

 (vi) Neither it nor any of its Subsidiaries has any obligations under any Compensation and Benefit Plans to provide benefits, including death or medical benefits, with respect to employees of it or its Subsidiaries beyond their retirement or other termination of service other than (A) coverage mandated by Part 6 of Title I of ERISA or Section 4980B of the Code, (B) retirement or death benefits under any employee pension benefit plan (as defined under Section 3(2) of ERISA), (C) disability benefits under any employee welfare plan that have been fully provided for by insurance or otherwise, or (D) benefits in the nature of severance pay.

labor organization, nor is it or any of its Subsidiaries the subject of a
proceeding asserting that it or any such Subsidiaries has committed an unfair

applicable law. The obligation of Hydrocarbon to call, hold and convene the
Hydrocarbon Meeting shall not be affected by a Hydrocarbon Change in
Recommendation, and the obligation of Energy Partners to call, hold and
convene the Energy Partners Meeting shall not be affected by an Energy
Partners Change in Recommendation.

  

 Section 6.3 _ Registration Statement_. 

  

 (a) Each of Energy Partners and Hydrocarbon agrees to cooperate in the preparation of a registration statement on Form S-4 (the "Registration Statement") (including the joint proxy statement and prospectus and other proxy solicitation materials of Energy Partners and Hydrocarbon constituting a part thereof (the "Joint Proxy Statement") and all related documents) to be filed by Energy Partners with the SEC in connection with the issuance of Common Units in the Merger as contemplated by this Agreement. Each of Energy Partners and Hydrocarbon agrees that the other party shall have the right to consent to the disclosure to be contained in the Registration Statement and the Joint Proxy Statement. Provided Hydrocarbon has cooperated as required above, Energy Partners agrees to file the Registration Statement with the SEC as promptly as practicable. Each of Hydrocarbon and Energy Partners agrees to use all commercially reasonable best efforts to cause the Registration Statement to be declared effective under the Securities Act as promptly as practicable after filing thereof. Energy Partners also agrees to use commercially reasonable best efforts to obtain all necessary state securities law or "Blue Sky" permits and approvals required to carry out the transactions contemplated by this Agreement. Hydrocarbon agrees to furnish to Energy Partners all information concerning Hydrocarbon, its Subsidiaries (other than Energy Partners and its Subsidiaries), officers, directors and stockholders and to take such other action as may be reasonably requested in connection with the foregoing. 

  

 (b) Each of Hydrocarbon and Energy Partners agrees, as to itself and its Subsidiaries, other than, in the case of Hydrocarbon, Energy Partners and its Subsidiaries, that (i) none of the information supplied or to be supplied by it for inclusion or incorporation by reference in the Registration Statement will, at the time the Registration Statement and each amendment or supplement thereto, if any, becomes effective under the Securities Act, contain any untrue statement of a material fact or omit to state any material fact required to be stated therein or necessary to make the statements therein, in light of the circumstances under which they were made, not misleading, and (ii) the Joint Proxy Statement and any amendment or supplement thereto will, at the date of mailing to stockholders and at the times of the Energy Partners Meeting and Hydrocarbon Meeting, not contain any untrue statement of a material fact or omit to state any material fact required to be stated therein or necessary to make the statements therein, in light of the circumstances under which they were made, not misleading. Each of Hydrocarbon and Energy Partners further agrees that if it shall become aware prior to the Closing Date of any information that would cause any of the statements in the Registration Statement to be false or misleading with respect to any material fact, or omit to state any material fact necessary to make the statements therein, in light of the circumstances under which they were made, 

        
  

not false or misleading, it will promptly inform the other party thereof and
take the necessary steps to correct such information in an amendment or
supplement to the Registration Statement.

  

 (c) Energy Partners will advise Hydrocarbon, promptly after Energy Partners receives notice thereof, of the time when the Registration Statement has become effective or any supplement or amendment has been filed, of the issuance of any stop order or the suspension of the qualification of the Common Units for offering or sale in any jurisdiction, of the initiation or threat of any proceeding for any such purpose, or of any request by the SEC for the amendment or supplement of the Registration Statement or for additional information. 

  

 (d) Each of Energy Partners and Hydrocarbon will use its commercially reasonable best efforts to cause the Joint Proxy Statement to be mailed to its unitholders and stockholders, respectively, as soon as practicable after the effective date of the Registration Statement.

 Section 6.5 _ Access; Information_. 

   

 (a) Upon reasonable notice and subject to applicable laws relating to the exchange of information, each party shall, and shall cause its Subsidiaries to, afford the other parties and their officers, employees, counsel, accountants and other authorized representatives, access, during normal business hours throughout the period prior to the Effective Time, to all of its properties, books, contracts, commitments and records, and to its officers, employees, accountants, counsel or other representatives, and, during such period, it shall, and shall cause its Subsidiaries to, furnish promptly to such other parties and its representatives (i) a copy of each material report, schedule and other document filed by it pursuant to the requirements of federal or state securities law (other than reports or documents that Hydrocarbon or Energy Partners or their respective Subsidiaries, as the case may be, are not permitted to disclose under applicable law) and (ii) all other information concerning the business, properties and personnel of it as the other may reasonably request. Neither Hydrocarbon nor Energy Partners nor any of their respective Subsidiaries shall be required to provide access to or to disclose information where such access or disclosure would violate or prejudice the rights of its customers, jeopardize the attorney-client privilege of the institution in possession or control of such information or contravene any law, rule, regulation, order, judgment, decree, fiduciary duty or binding agreement entered into prior to the date of this Agreement. The parties hereto will make appropriate substitute disclosure arrangements under the circumstances in which the restrictions of the preceding sentence apply. 

  

 (b) Energy Partners will not use any information obtained pursuant to this Section 6.5 for any purpose unrelated to the consummation of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement and will hold all information and documents obtained pursuant to this paragraph in confidence. No investigation by either party of the business and affairs of the other shall affect or be deemed to modify or waive any representation, warranty, covenant or agreement in this Agreement, or the conditions to either party\'s obligation to consummate the transactions contemplated by this Agreement. 

  

 Section 6.6 _ Acquisition Proposals_. 

  

 (a) Notwithstanding any other provision of this Agreement to the contrary, during the period beginning on the date of this Agreement and continuing until the No-Solicitation Period Start Date, Hydrocarbon and its Representatives shall have the right to, directly or indirectly, (i) initiate, solicit, facilitate and encourage Acquisition Proposals, (ii) enter into discussions relating to Acquisition Proposals, (iii) continue or otherwise participate in any discussions or negotiations regarding any 

        
  

Acquisition Proposal, (iv) furnish to any Person any information or data with
respect to Hydrocarbon, including by way of providing access to non-public
information pursuant to (but only pursuant to an executed confidentiality
agreement no less restrictive than the Confidentiality Agreement); _provided_
that Hydrocarbon shall promptly provide or make available to Energy Partners
any non-public information concerning Hydrocarbon or any Subsidiary that is
provided or made available to any Person which was not previously provided or
made available to Energy Partners; and (v) otherwise cooperate with or take
any other action to facilitate any proposal that constitutes, or could
reasonably be expected to lead to, an Acquisition Proposal. Within 24 hours
following the No-Solicitation Period Start Date, Hydrocarbon shall notify
Energy Partners of (i) the number of Excluded Parties, (ii) the identity of
each Excluded Party and (iii) the material terms and conditions of each
Excluded Party\'s Acquisition Proposal and furnish copies of any documents and
related correspondence provided in connection therewith (including any
amendments or modifications to any of the foregoing) received from any
Excluded Party. Hydrocarbon shall immediately cease any discussions with any
Person (other than Energy Partners) that are ongoing as of the No-Solicitation
Period Start Date and that constitute an Acquisition Proposal, except as may
be expressly provided for in Sections 6.6(b) and 6.6(c), and except in
respect of any Excluded Party.

   

 Any Person that submits an Acquisition Proposal that the Deal Committee and the Hydrocarbon Board determines in good faith constitutes, or could reasonably be expected to lead to, a Superior Proposal, no later than 24 hours following the No Solicitation Period Start Date shall be referred to herein as an "Excluded Party." Notwithstanding anything contained in Section 6.6(a) to the contrary, any Excluded Party shall cease to be an Excluded Party for all purposes under this Agreement at such time as the Deal Committee determines in good faith that the Acquisition Proposal made by such party ceases to be reasonably likely to lead to a Superior Proposal. 

  

 (b) Except with respect to any written Acquisition Proposal from an Excluded Party received after the date hereof and prior to the No-Solicitation Period Start Date, none of Hydrocarbon and its Subsidiaries shall, and they shall cause their Representatives not to, directly or indirectly, (i) initiate, solicit, facilitate or knowingly encourage the submission of, any Acquisition Proposal, or (ii) participate in any negotiations or negotiations regarding, or furnish to any person any non-public information with respect to, any Acquisition Proposal. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Section 6.6, nothing contained in this Agreement shall prohibit Hydrocarbon from furnishing any information to, or entering into or participating in discussions or negotiations with, any person that makes an unsolicited written Acquisition Proposal which did not result from a breach of this Section 6.6, if (i) the Deal Committee determines that such Acquisition Proposal constitutes or is likely to result in a Superior Proposal, and (ii) prior to furnishing such non-public information to such person, Hydrocarbon receives from such person an executed confidentiality agreement no less restrictive than the Confidentiality Agreement and furnishes Energy Partners with any such information that has not previously been furnished. Any breach of this Section 6.6 by any of Hydrocarbon\'s or its Subsidiaries\' Representatives shall constitute a breach of this Section 6.6 by Hydrocarbon. 

  

 (c) Other than in accordance with Section 6.6(e), and except as otherwise provided in this Section 6.6(c), neither the Hydrocarbon Board nor any committee thereof shall (1) (a) withdraw, modify or qualify in any manner adverse to Energy Partners the Hydrocarbon Recommendation or (b) publicly approve or recommend, or publicly propose to approve or recommend, any Acquisition Proposal (any action described in this clause (1) being referred to as a "Hydrocarbon Change in Recommendation"); or (2) approve, adopt or recommend, or publicly propose to approve, adopt or recommend, or allow Hydrocarbon or any of its Subsidiaries to execute or enter into, any letter of intent, memorandum of understanding, agreement in principle, merger agreement, acquisition agreement, option agreement, joint venture agreement, partnership agreement, or other similar contract or any tender or exchange offer providing for, with respect to, or in connection with, any Acquisition Proposal. Notwithstanding the foregoing, at any time prior to obtaining the Hydrocarbon Stockholder 

        
  

Approval, the Deal Committee may make a Hydrocarbon Change in Recommendation
if it shall have concluded in good faith, after consultation with, and taking
into account the advice of, its outside legal advisors and financial
consultants, the Hydrocarbon Change in Recommendation is necessary to comply
with its fiduciary duties under applicable law; _provided, however_ , that
the Deal Committee shall not be entitled to exercise its right to make a
Hydrocarbon Change in Recommendation pursuant to this sentence unless
Hydrocarbon has: (x) complied in all material respects with this Section 6.6,
(y) provided to Energy Partners four calendar days prior written notice (such
notice, a "Notice of Proposed Recommendation Change") advising Energy
Partners that the Deal Committee intends to take such action and specifying
the reasons therefor in reasonable detail, including, if applicable, the terms
and conditions of any Superior Proposal that is the basis of the proposed
action and the identity of the Person making the proposal and
contemporaneously providing a copy of all relevant proposed transaction
documents for such Superior Proposal (it being understood and agreed that any
amendment to the terms of any such Superior Proposal shall require a new
Notice of Proposed Recommendation Change and an additional four calendar day
period), and (z) if applicable, provided to Energy Partners all materials and
information delivered or made available to the Person or group of persons
making any Superior Proposal in connection with such Superior Proposal (to the
extent not previously provided). Any Hydrocarbon Change in Recommendation
shall not change the approval of this Agreement or any other approval of the
Board of Directors of Hydrocarbon, including in any respect that would have
the effect of causing any state (including Delaware) corporate takeover
statute or other similar statute to be applicable to the transactions
contemplated hereby or thereby, including the Redemption and/or Merger.

  

 (d) In addition to the obligations of Hydrocarbon set forth in this Section 6.6, Hydrocarbon shall as promptly as practicable (and in any event within 24 hours after receipt) advise Energy Partners orally and in writing of any Acquisition Proposal or any matter giving rise to a Hydrocarbon Change in Recommendation and the material terms and conditions of any such Acquisition Proposal or any matter giving rise to a Hydrocarbon Change in Recommendation (including any changes thereto) and the identity of the Person making any such Acquisition Proposal. Hydrocarbon shall keep Energy Partners informed on a reasonably current basis of material developments with respect to any such Acquisition Proposal or any matter giving rise to a Hydrocarbon Change in Recommendation. 

  

 (e) Nothing contained in this Agreement shall prevent Hydrocarbon or the Hydrocarbon Board from taking and disclosing to its stockholders a position contemplated by Rule 14d-9 and Rule 14e-2(a) promulgated under the Exchange Act (or any similar communication to stockholders) or from making any legally required disclosure to stockholders. Any "stop-look-and-listen" communication by Hydrocarbon or the Hydrocarbon Board to the stockholders of Hydrocarbon pursuant to Rule 14d-9(f) promulgated under the Exchange Act (or any similar communication to the stockholders of Hydrocarbon) shall not be considered a failure to make, or a withdrawal, modification or change in any manner adverse to Energy Partners of, all or a portion of the Hydrocarbon Recommendation. 

  

 Section 6.7 _ Affiliate Arrangements_. 

  

 (a) Not later than the 15th day after the mailing of the Joint Proxy Statement, Hydrocarbon shall deliver to Energy Partners a schedule of each person that, to the best of its knowledge, is or is reasonably likely to be, as of the date of the relevant Meeting, deemed to be an "affiliate" of Hydrocarbon (a "Rule 145 Affiliate") as that term is used in Rule 145 under the Securities Act. 

  

 (b) Hydrocarbon shall use its commercially reasonable best efforts to cause its Rule 145 Affiliates not to sell any securities received under the Merger in violation of the registration requirements of the Securities Act, including Rule 145 thereunder. 

  

 Section 6.8 _ Takeover Laws_. Neither party shall take any action that would cause the transactions contemplated by this Agreement to be subject to requirements imposed by any Takeover Laws, and each of them shall take all necessary steps within its control to exempt (or ensure the continued exemption of) the transactions contemplated by this Agreement from, or if necessary challenge the validity or applicability of, any stockholder rights plan adopted by such party or any applicable Takeover Law, as now or hereafter in effect, including, without limitation, Takeover Laws of any state that purport to apply to this Agreement or the transactions contemplated hereby. 

       

    

  Section 6.9 _ No Rights Triggered_. Each of Hydrocarbon and
Energy Partners shall take all steps necessary to ensure that the entering
into of this Agreement and the consummation of the transactions contemplated
hereby and any other action or combination of actions, or any other
transactions contemplated hereby, do not and will not result in the grant of
any Rights to any person (a) in the case of Hydrocarbon under its certificate
of incorporation or bylaws and in the case of Energy Partners under its
Partnership Agreement or (b) under any material agreement to which it or any
of its Subsidiaries is a party.

  

 Section 6.10 _ Common Units Listed_. In the case of Energy Partners, Energy Partners shall use its commercially reasonable best efforts to list, prior to the Closing, on the NYSE, upon official notice of issuance, the Common Units to be issued to the holders of Hydrocarbon Common Stock in the Merger. 

  

 Section 6.11 _ Third Party Approvals_. 

  

 (a) Energy Partners and Hydrocarbon and their respective Subsidiaries, shall cooperate and use their respective commercially reasonable best efforts to prepare all documentation, to effect all filings, to obtain all permits, consents, approvals and authorizations of all third parties and HSR approval necessary to consummate the transactions contemplated by this Agreement and to comply with the terms and conditions of such permits, consents, approvals and authorizations and to cause the Redemption and/or Merger to be consummated as expeditiously as practicable. Each of Energy Partners and Hydrocarbon shall have the right to review in advance, and to the extent practicable each will consult with the other, in each case subject to applicable laws relating to the exchange of information, with respect to, all material written information submitted to any third party or any Regulatory Authorities in connection with the transactions contemplated by this Agreement. In exercising the foregoing right, each of the parties hereto agrees to act reasonably and promptly.

 (b) Each party agrees, upon request, to furnish the other party with all information concerning itself, its Subsidiaries, directors, officers and stockholders and such other matters as may be reasonably necessary or advisable in connection with the Registration Statement, the Joint Proxy Statement or any filing, notice or application made by or on behalf of such other party or any of such Subsidiaries to any Regulatory Authority in connection with the transactions contemplated hereby. 

   

 Section 6.12 _ Indemnification; Directors\' and Officers\' Insurance._ 

  

 (a) Without limiting any additional rights that any director, officer, trustee, employee, agent, or fiduciary may have under any employment or indemnification agreement or under the Hydrocarbon Charter, the Hydrocarbon Bylaws or this Agreement or, if applicable, similar organizational documents or agreements of any of Hydrocarbon\'s Subsidiaries, from and after the Effective Time, Energy Partners and the Surviving Entity, jointly and severally, shall: (i) indemnify and hold harmless each person who is at the date hereof or during the period from the date hereof through the date of the Effective Time serving as a director or officer of Hydrocarbon or any of its Subsidiaries or as a fiduciary under or with respect to any employee benefit plan (within the meaning of Section 3(3) of ERISA) (collectively, the "Indemnified Parties") to the fullest extent authorized or permitted by applicable law, as now or hereafter in effect, in connection with any Claim and any losses, claims, damages, liabilities, costs, Indemnification Expenses, judgments, fines, penalties and amounts paid in settlement (including all interest, assessments and other charges paid or payable in connection with or in respect of any thereof) resulting therefrom; and (ii) promptly pay on behalf of or, within ten (10) days after any request for advancement, advance to each of the Indemnified Parties, any Indemnification Expenses incurred in defending, serving as a witness with respect to or otherwise 

        
  

participating with respect to any Claim in advance of the final disposition
of such Claim, including payment on behalf of or advancement to the
Indemnified Party of any Indemnification Expenses incurred by such
Indemnified Party in connection with enforcing any rights with respect to such
indemnification and/or advancement, in each case without the requirement of
any bond or other security). The indemnification and advancement obligations
of Energy Partners and the Surviving Entity pursuant to this Section 6.12(a)
shall extend to acts or omissions occurring at or before the Effective Time
and any Claim relating thereto (including with respect to any acts or
omissions occurring in connection with the approval of this Agreement and the
consummation of the Redemption and Merger and the transactions contemplated
by this Agreement, including the consideration and approval thereof and the
process undertaken in connection therewith and any Claim relating thereto),
and all rights to indemnification and advancement conferred hereunder shall
continue as to a person who has ceased to be a director or officer of
Hydrocarbon or any of its Subsidiaries after the date hereof and shall inure
to the benefit of such person\'s heirs, executors and personal and legal
representatives. As used in this Section 6.12(a): (x) the term "Claim" means
any threatened, asserted, pending or completed action, whether instituted by
any party hereto, any Governmental Authority or any other person, that any
Indemnified Party in good faith believes might lead to the institution of any
Action, whether civil, criminal, administrative, investigative or other,
including any arbitration or other alternative dispute resolution mechanism,
arising out of or pertaining to matters that relate to such Indemnified
Party\'s duties or service as a director or officer of Hydrocarbon, any of its
Subsidiaries, or any employee benefit plan (within the meaning of Section
3(3) of ERISA) maintained by any of the foregoing at or prior to the Effective
Time; and (y) the term "Indemnification Expenses" means reasonable attorneys\'
fees and all other reasonable costs, expenses and obligations (including
experts\' fees, travel expenses, court costs, retainers, transcript fees,
duplicating, printing and binding costs, as well as
telecommunications, postage and courier charges) paid or incurred in
connection with investigating, defending, being a witness in or participating
in (including on appeal), or preparing to investigate, defend, be a witness
in or participate in, any Claim for which indemnification is authorized
pursuant to this Section 6.12(a), including any Action relating to a claim for
indemnification or advancement brought by an Indemnified Party. Neither
Energy Partners nor the Surviving Entity shall settle, compromise or consent
to the entry of any judgment in any actual or threatened Action in respect
of which indemnification has been or could be sought by such Indemnified
Party hereunder unless such settlement, compromise or judgment includes an
unconditional release of such Indemnified Party from all liability arising
out of such Action without admission or finding of wrongdoing, or such

 (i) Prior to the end of the calendar year in which the payment was made to the Escrow Agent, Energy Partners shall submit to the Escrow Agent a certificate demanding a portion of the Escrow Fund equal to no greater than 70% of the maximum remaining amount which, in the good faith view of the General Partner, may still be taken into the gross revenues of Energy Partners without exceeding the permissible qualifying income (as defined in Section 7704 of the Code) limits for a publicly traded partnership, after taking into consideration all other sources of non-qualifying income (such maximum remaining amount, the "Non-Qualifying Income Cushion"), and the Escrow Agent shall within one Business Day thereafter, pay Energy Partners the amount demanded, by wire transfer of immediately available funds to an account designated by Energy Partners; 

  

 (ii) During the calendar year following the date that the payment was made to the Escrow Agent but prior to the passage of 30 calendar days following the filing of the IRS Form 1065 for the prior year, Energy Partners shall submit to the Escrow Agent a certificate identifying the actual Non-Qualifying Income Cushion from the prior year.

the actual Non-Qualifying Income Cushion, and the Escrow Agent shall within
one Business Day thereafter, pay Energy Partners the amount demanded, (B)
greater than or equal to 80%, but less than or equal to 90% of the actual
Non-Qualifying Income Cushion, then Energy Partners shall notify the Escrow
Agent that it will not demand any additional payments from the Escrow
Account, and (C) greater than 90% of the actual Non-Qualifying Income Cushion,
then Energy Partners shall deliver a certificate to such effect to the Escrow
Agent and return to the Escrow Fund an amount equal to the excess of the
payment contemplated by clause (i) over 80% of the Non-Qualifying Income
Cushion. Any payment under this clause (ii) shall be made by the Escrow
Agent, or Energy Partners, as the case may be, by wire transfer of immediately
available funds to an account designated by Energy Partners or the Escrow
Agent, as the case may be; and

  

 (iii) Within one Business Day following the earlier of (A) completion of the procedures as contemplated by Section 9.1(g)(ii) above and (B) the passage of 30 days following the filing of the IRS Form 1065 for the prior year, the Escrow Agent shall pay Hydrocarbon the remainder, if any, of the Escrow Fund, by wire transfer of immediately available funds to an account designated by Hydrocarbon. 

  

  

Hydrocarbon acknowledges and agrees that (x) the amount of a payment, if any,
pursuant to Section 9.1(g)(ii) above is uncertain, and that depending on the
amount of the demands made by Energy Partners pursuant to Section 9.1(g)(ii)
above, the Escrow Fund may be insufficient to permit payments to Hydrocarbon
pursuant to Section 9.1(g)(ii) above, and (y) it shall have no rights to any
amounts in the Escrow Fund (other than as contemplated by this subsection (h))
or to audit or inquire into the amounts demanded by or paid to
Energy Partners.

 (i) This Section 9.1 shall survive any termination of this Agreement. 

  

 Section 9.2 _ Waiver; Amendment_.

 NOW, THEREFORE, in consideration of the covenants, conditions and agreements contained herein, the parties hereto hereby agree as follows: 

  

ARTICLE I 
 DEFINITIONS

  

 Section 1.1 _ Definitions._ The following definitions shall be for all purposes, unless otherwise clearly indicated to the contrary, applied to the terms used in this Agreement. 

  

 " _Acquisition_ " means any transaction in which any Group Member acquires (through an asset acquisition, merger, stock acquisition or other form of investment) control over all or a portion of the assets, properties or business of another Person for the purpose of increasing the operating capacity or revenues of the Partnership Group from the operating capacity or revenues of the Partnership Group existing immediately prior to such transaction. 

  

 " _Additional Limited Partner_ " means a Person admitted to the Partnership as a Limited Partner pursuant to Section 10.2 and who is shown as such on the books and records of the Partnership. 

  

 " _Adjusted Capital Account_ " means the Capital Account maintained for each Partner as of the end of each fiscal year of the Partnership, (a) increased by any amounts that such Partner is obligated to restore under the standards set by Treasury Regulation Section 1.704-1(b)(2)(ii)(c) (or is deemed 

        
  

obligated to restore under Treasury Regulation Sections 1.704-2(g) and
1.704-2(i)(5)) and (b) decreased by (i) the amount of all losses and
deductions that, as of the end of such fiscal year, are reasonably expected
to be allocated to such Partner in subsequent years under Sections 704(e)(2)
and 706(d) of the Code and Treasury Regulation Section 1.751-1(b)(2)(ii), and
(ii) the amount of all distributions that, as of the end of such fiscal year,
are reasonably expected to be made to such Partner in subsequent years in
accordance with the terms of this Agreement or otherwise to the extent they
exceed offsetting increases to such Partner\'s Capital Account that are
reasonably expected to occur during (or prior to) the year in which such
distributions are reasonably expected to be made (other than increases as a
result of a minimum gain chargeback pursuant to Section 6.1(c)(i) or Section
6.1(c)(ii)). The foregoing definition of Adjusted Capital Account is intended
to comply with the provisions of Treasury Regulation Section
1.704-1(b)(2)(ii)(d) and shall be interpreted consistently therewith. The "
_Adjusted Capital Account_ " of a Partner in respect of a General Partner
Interest, a Common Unit, a Class A Unit or any other specified interest in
the Partnership shall be the amount which such Adjusted Capital Account would
be if such General Partner Interest, Common Unit, Class A Unit or other
interest in the Partnership were the only interest in the Partnership held by
such Partner from and after the date on which such General Partner Interest,
Common Unit, Class A Unit or other interest was first issued.

  

 " _Adjusted Property_ " means any property the Carrying Value of which has been adjusted pursuant to Section 5.3(d)(i) or 5.3(d)(ii). 

  

 " _Affiliate_ " means, with respect to any Person, any other Person that directly or indirectly through one or more intermediaries controls, is controlled by or is under common control with, the Person in question. As used herein, the term " _control_ " means the possession, direct or indirect, of the power to direct or cause the direction of the management and policies of a Person, whether through ownership of voting securities, by contract or otherwise. " _Affiliate_ " with respect to the General Partner shall not include the Partnership for purposes of Section 7.8. 

   

 " _Agreed Allocation_ " means any allocation, other than a Required Allocation, of an item of income, gain, loss or deduction pursuant to the provisions of Section 6.1, including, without limitation, a Curative Allocation (if appropriate to the context in which the term " _Agreed Allocation_ " is used). 

  

 " _Agreed Value_ " of any Contributed Property means the fair market value of such property or other consideration at the time of contribution as determined by the General Partner using such reasonable method of valuation as it may adopt. The General Partner shall, in its discretion, use such method as it deems reasonable and appropriate to allocate the aggregate Agreed Value of Contributed Properties contributed to the Partnership in a single or integrated transaction among each separate property on a basis proportional to the fair market value of each Contributed Property. 

  

 " _Agreement_ " means this Third Amended and Restated Agreement of Limited Partnership of MarkWest Energy Partners, L.P., as it may be amended, supplemented or restated from time to time. 

  

 " _APB 25_ " means Accounting Principles Board Opinion Number 25, an accounting principle governing accounting for stock issued to employees. 

   

 " _Assignee_ " means a Non-citizen Assignee or a Person to whom one or more Limited Partner Interests have been transferred in a manner permitted under this Agreement and who has executed and delivered a Transfer Application as required by this Agreement, but who has not been admitted as a Substituted Limited Partner. 

  

 " _Associate_ " means, when used to indicate a relationship with any Person: (a) any corporation or organization of which such Person is a director, officer or partner or is, directly or indirectly, the owner of 20% or more of any class of voting stock or other voting interest; (b) any trust or other estate in which such Person has at least a 20% beneficial interest or as to which such Person serves as trustee or 

        
  

in a similar fiduciary capacity; or (c) any relative or spouse of such
Person, or any relative of such spouse, who has the same principal residence
as such Person.

   

 " _Available Cash_ " means, with respect to any Quarter ending prior to the Liquidation Date: 

  

  

 (a) the sum of (i) all cash and cash equivalents of the Partnership Group on hand at the end of such Quarter, and (ii) all additional cash and cash equivalents of the Partnership Group (excluding MarkWest Hydrocarbon, Inc.) on hand on the date of determination of Available Cash with respect to such Quarter resulting from Working Capital Borrowings made subsequent to the end of such Quarter, less 

  

 (b) the amount of any cash reserves that are necessary or appropriate in the reasonable discretion of the General Partner to (i) provide for the proper conduct of the business of the Partnership Group (including reserves for future capital expenditures and for anticipated future credit needs of the Partnership Group) subsequent to such Quarter, (ii) comply with applicable law or any loan agreement, security agreement, mortgage, debt instrument or other agreement or obligation to which any Group Member is a party or by which it is bound or its assets are subject or (iii) provide funds for distributions under Section 6.3 in respect of any one or more of the next four Quarters; _provided, however,_ that disbursements made by a Group Member or cash reserves established, increased or reduced after the end of such Quarter but on or before the date of determination of Available Cash with respect to such Quarter shall be deemed to have been made, established, increased or reduced, for purposes of determining Available Cash, within such Quarter if the General Partner so determines.

A Partner\'s share of the Partnership\'s Book-Tax Disparities in all of its Contributed Property and Adjusted Property will be reflected by the difference between such Partner\'s Capital Account balance as maintained pursuant to Section 5.3 and the hypothetical balance of such Partner\'s Capital Account computed as if it had been maintained strictly in accordance with federal income tax accounting principles. 

  

 " _Business Day_ " means Monday through Friday of each week, except that a legal holiday recognized as such by the government of the United States of America or the State of Colorado shall not be regarded as a Business Day.

 (i) execute, swear to, acknowledge, deliver, file and record in the appropriate public offices (A) all certificates, documents and other instruments (including this Agreement and the Certificate of Limited Partnership and all amendments or restatements hereof or thereof) that the General Partner or the Liquidator deems necessary or appropriate to form, qualify or continue the existence or qualification of the Partnership as a limited partnership (or a partnership in which the limited partners have limited liability) in the State of Delaware and in all other jurisdictions in which the Partnership may conduct business or own property; (B) all certificates, documents and other instruments that the General Partner or the Liquidator deems necessary or appropriate to reflect, in accordance with its terms, any amendment, change, modification or restatement of this Agreement; (C) all certificates, documents and other instruments (including conveyances and a certificate of cancellation) that the General Partner or the Liquidator deems necessary or appropriate to reflect the dissolution and liquidation of the Partnership pursuant to the terms of this Agreement; (D) all certificates, documents and other instruments relating to the admission, withdrawal, removal or substitution of any Partner, as applicable, pursuant to, or other events described in, Article IV, X, XI or XII; (E) all certificates, documents and other instruments relating to the determination of the rights, preferences and privileges of any class or series of Partnership Securities issued pursuant to Section 5.4; and (F) all certificates, documents and other instruments (including agreements and a certificate of merger) relating to a merger or consolidation of the Partnership pursuant to Article XIV; and 

  

      

  

 (ii) execute, swear to, acknowledge, deliver, file and record all ballots, consents, approvals, waivers, certificates, documents and other instruments necessary or appropriate, in the discretion of the General Partner or the Liquidator, to make, evidence, give, confirm or ratify any vote, consent, approval, agreement or other action that is made or given by the Partners hereunder or is consistent with the terms of this Agreement or is necessary or appropriate, in the discretion of the General Partner or the Liquidator, to effectuate the terms or intent of this Agreement; _provided, however,_ that when required by Section 13.3 or any other provision of this Agreement that establishes a percentage of the Limited Partners or of the Limited Partners of any class or series required to take any action, the General Partner and the Liquidator may exercise the power of attorney made in this Section 2.6(a)(ii) only after the necessary vote, consent or approval of the Limited Partners or of the Limited Partners of such class or series, as applicable. 

  

  

Nothing contained in this Section 2.6(a) shall be construed as authorizing
the General Partner to amend this Agreement except in accordance with Article
XIII or as may be otherwise expressly provided for in this Agreement.

  

 (b) The foregoing power of attorney is hereby declared to be irrevocable and a power coupled with an interest, and it shall survive and, to the maximum extent permitted by law, not be affected by the subsequent death, incompetency, disability, incapacity, dissolution, bankruptcy or termination of any Limited Partner or Assignee and the transfer of all or any portion of such Limited Partner\'s or Assignee\'s Partnership Interest and shall extend to such Limited Partner\'s or Assignee\'s heirs, successors, assigns and personal representatives. Each such Limited Partner or Assignee hereby agrees to be bound by any representation made by the General Partner or the Liquidator acting in good faith pursuant to such power of attorney; and each such Limited Partner or Assignee, to the maximum extent permitted by law, hereby waives any and all defenses that may be available to contest, negate or disaffirm the action of the General Partner or the Liquidator taken in good faith under such power of attorney. Each Limited Partner or Assignee shall execute and deliver to the General Partner or the Liquidator, within 15 days after receipt of the request therefor, such further designation, powers of attorney and other instruments as the General Partner or the Liquidator deems necessary to effectuate this Agreement and the purposes of the Partnership. 

  

 Section 2.7 _ Term._ The term of the Partnership commenced upon the filing of the Certificate of Limited Partnership in accordance with the Delaware Act and shall continue in existence until the dissolution of the Partnership in accordance with the provisions of Article XII. The existence of the Partnership as a separate legal entity shall continue until the cancellation of the Certificate of Limited Partnership as provided in the Delaware Act. 

   

 Section 2.8 _ Title to Partnership Assets._ Title to Partnership assets, whether real, personal or mixed and whether tangible or intangible, shall be deemed to be owned by the Partnership as an entity, and no Partner or Assignee, individually or collectively, shall have any ownership interest in such Partnership assets or any portion thereof. Title to any or all of the Partnership assets may be held in the name of the Partnership, the General Partner, one or more of its Affiliates or one or more nominees, as the General Partner may determine. The General Partner hereby declares and warrants that any Partnership assets for which record title is held in the name of the General Partner or one or more of its Affiliates or one or more nominees shall be held by the General Partner or such Affiliate or nominee for the use and benefit of the Partnership in accordance with the provisions of this Agreement; _provided, however_ , that the General Partner shall use reasonable efforts to cause record title to such assets (other than those assets in respect of which the General Partner determines that the expense and difficulty of conveyancing makes transfer of record title to the Partnership impracticable) to be vested in the Partnership as soon as reasonably practicable; _provided, further_ , that, prior to the withdrawal of the General Partner or as soon thereafter as practicable, the General Partner shall use reasonable efforts to effect the transfer of record title to the Partnership and, prior to any such transfer, will provide for the use of such assets in a manner satisfactory to the General Partner. All 

        
  

Partnership assets shall be recorded as the property of the Partnership in
its books and records, irrespective of the name in which record title to such
Partnership assets is held.

 Section 3.3 _ Outside Activities of the Limited Partners._ Subject to the provisions of Section 7.6, which shall continue to be applicable to the Persons referred to therein, regardless of whether such Persons shall also be Limited Partners or Assignees, any Limited Partner or Assignee shall be entitled to and may have business interests and engage in business activities in addition to those relating to the Partnership, including business interests and activities in direct competition with the Partnership Group. Neither the Partnership nor any of the other Partners or Assignees shall have any rights by virtue of this Agreement in any business ventures of any Limited Partner or Assignee.

 (b) The General Partner may keep confidential from the Limited Partners and Assignees, for such period of time as the General Partner deems reasonable, (i) any information that the General Partner reasonably believes to be in the nature of trade secrets or (ii) other information the disclosure of which the General Partner in good faith believes (A) is not in the best interests of the Partnership Group, (B) could damage the Partnership Group or (C) that any Group Member is required by law or by agreement with any third party to keep confidential (other than agreements with Affiliates of the Partnership the primary purpose of which is to circumvent the obligations set forth in this Section 3.4). 

  

    
ARTICLE IV 
CERTIFICATES; RECORD HOLDERS; TRANSFER OF PARTNERSHIP 
INTERESTS; REDEMPTION OF PARTNERSHIP INTERESTS 

  

 Section 4.1 _ Certificates._ Upon the Partnership\'s issuance of Common Units or Class A Units to any Person, the Partnership shall issue one or more Certificates in the name of such Person evidencing the number of such Units being so issued. In addition, upon the request of any Person owning Class A Units or any other Partnership Securities other than Common Units, the Partnership shall issue to such Person one or more certificates evidencing such Class A Units or other Partnership Securities other than Common Units. Certificates shall be executed on behalf of the Partnership by the Chairman of the Board of Directors, President or any Executive Vice President or Vice President and the Secretary or any Assistant Secretary of the General Partner. No Common Unit Certificate shall be valid for any purpose until it has been countersigned by the Transfer Agent; _provided, however_ , that if the General Partner elects to issue Common Units in global form, the Common Unit Certificates shall be valid upon receipt of a certificate from the Transfer Agent certifying that the Common Units have been duly registered in accordance with the directions of the Partnership. 

   

 Section 4.2 _ Mutilated, Destroyed, Lost or Stolen Certificates._ 

  

 (a) If any mutilated Certificate is surrendered to the Transfer Agent, the appropriate officers of the General Partner on behalf of the Partnership shall execute, and the Transfer Agent shall countersign and deliver in exchange therefor, a new Certificate evidencing the same number and type of Partnership Securities as the Certificate so surrendered. 

  

 (b) The appropriate officers of the General Partner on behalf of the Partnership shall execute and deliver, and the Transfer Agent shall countersign, a new Certificate in place of any Certificate previously issued if the Record Holder of the Certificate: 

  

  

 (i) makes proof by affidavit, in form and substance satisfactory to the General Partner, that a previously issued Certificate has been lost, destroyed or stolen; 

  

 (ii) requests the issuance of a new Certificate before the General Partner has notice that the Certificate has been acquired by a purchaser for value in good faith and without notice of an adverse claim; 

  

 (iii) if requested by the General Partner, delivers to the General Partner a bond, in form and substance satisfactory to the General Partner, with surety or sureties and with fixed or open penalty as the General Partner may reasonably direct, in its sole discretion, to indemnify the Partnership, the Partners, the General Partner and the Transfer Agent against any claim that may be made on account of the alleged loss, destruction or theft of the Certificate; and 

  

 (iv) satisfies any other reasonable requirements imposed by the General Partner. 

  

  

 If a Limited Partner or Assignee fails to notify the General Partner within a reasonable time after he has notice of the loss, destruction or theft of a Certificate, and a transfer of the Limited Partner Interests represented by the Certificate is registered before the Partnership, the General Partner or the Transfer Agent receives such notification, the Limited Partner or Assignee shall be precluded from making any claim against the Partnership, the General Partner or the Transfer Agent for such transfer or for a new Certificate. 

       

  (c) As a condition to the issuance of any new Certificate under
this Section 4.2, the General Partner may require the payment of a sum
sufficient to cover any tax or other governmental charge that may be imposed
in relation thereto and any other expenses (including the fees and expenses of
the Transfer Agent) reasonably connected therewith.

   

 Section 4.3 _ Record Holders._ The Partnership shall be entitled to recognize the Record Holder as the Partner or Assignee with respect to any Partnership Interest and, accordingly, shall not be bound to recognize any equitable or other claim to or interest in such Partnership Interest on the part of any other Person, regardless of whether the Partnership shall have actual or other notice thereof, except as otherwise provided by law or any applicable rule, regulation, guideline or requirement of any National Securities Exchange on which such Partnership Interests are listed for trading. Without limiting the foregoing, when a Person (such as a broker, dealer, bank, trust company or clearing corporation or an agent of any of the foregoing) is acting as nominee, agent or in some other representative capacity for another Person in acquiring and/or holding Partnership Interests, as between the Partnership on the one hand, and such other Persons on the other, such representative Person (a) shall be the Partner or Assignee (as the case may be) of record and beneficially, (b) must execute and deliver a Transfer Application and (c) shall be bound by this Agreement and shall have the rights and obligations of a Partner or Assignee (as the case may be) hereunder and as, and to the extent, provided for herein. 

  

 Section 4.4 _ Transfer Generally._ 

   

 (a) The term " _transfer_ ," when used in this Agreement with respect to a Partnership Interest, shall be deemed to refer to a transaction by which the General Partner assigns its General Partner Interest to another Person who then becomes the general partner of the Partnership or by which the holder of a Limited Partner Interest assigns such Limited Partner Interest to another Person who is or becomes a Limited Partner or an Assignee, and includes a sale, assignment, gift, pledge, encumbrance, hypothecation, mortgage, exchange or any other disposition by law or otherwise. 

  

 (b) No Partnership Interest shall be transferred, in whole or in part, except in accordance with the terms and conditions set forth in this Article IV. Any transfer or purported transfer of a Partnership Interest not made in accordance with this Article IV shall be null and void. 

  

 (c) Nothing contained in this Agreement shall be construed to prevent a disposition by any member of the General Partner (other than MarkWest Hydrocarbon, Inc., its direct and indirect Subsidiaries and the Partnership) of any or all of the membership interests of the General Partner; _provided, however,_ the General Partner shall not dispose of any of its Partnership Interests; _provided, further,_ the General Partner may distribute its holdings of Class A Units to its members. 

  

 Section 4.5 _ Registration and Transfer of Limited Partner Interests._ 

  

 (a) The General Partner shall keep or cause to be kept on behalf of the Partnership a register in which, subject to such reasonable regulations as it may prescribe and subject to the provisions of Section 4.5(b), the Partnership will provide for the registration and transfer of Limited Partner Interests. The Transfer Agent is hereby appointed registrar and transfer agent for the purpose of registering Common Units and transfers of such Common Units as herein provided. The Partnership shall not recognize transfers of Certificates evidencing Limited Partner Interests unless such transfers are effected in the manner described in this Section 4.5. Upon surrender of a Certificate for registration of transfer of any Limited Partner Interests evidenced by a Certificate, and subject to the provisions of Section 4.5(b), the appropriate officers of the General Partner on behalf of the Partnership shall execute and deliver, and in the case of Common Units, the Transfer Agent shall countersign and deliver, in the name of the holder or the designated transferee or transferees, as required pursuant to the holder\'s instructions, one or more new Certificates evidencing the same aggregate number and type of Limited Partner Interests as was evidenced by the Certificate so surrendered. 

        
  

 (b) Except as otherwise provided in Section 4.7, the General Partner shall not recognize any transfer of Limited Partner Interests until the Certificates evidencing such Limited Partner Interests are surrendered for registration of transfer and such Certificates are accompanied by a Transfer Application duly executed by the transferee (or the transferee\'s attorney-in-fact duly authorized in writing). No charge shall be imposed by the General Partner for such transfer; _provided, however,_ that as a condition to the issuance of any new Certificate under this Section 4.5, the General Partner may require the payment of a sum sufficient to cover any tax or other governmental charge that may be imposed with respect thereto. 

  

 (c) Limited Partner Interests may be transferred only in the manner described in this Section 4.5. The transfer of any Limited Partner Interests and the admission of any new Limited Partner shall not constitute an amendment to this Agreement. 

  

 (d) Until admitted as a Substituted Limited Partner pursuant to Section 10.1, the Record Holder of a Limited Partner Interest shall be an Assignee in respect of such Limited Partner Interest. Limited Partners may include custodians, nominees or any other individual or entity in its own or any representative capacity. 

  

 (e) A transferee of a Limited Partner Interest who has completed and delivered a Transfer Application shall be deemed to have (i) requested admission as a Substituted Limited Partner, (ii) agreed to comply with and be bound by and to have executed this Agreement, (iii) represented and warranted that such transferee has the right, power and authority and, if an individual, the capacity to enter into this Agreement, (iv) granted the powers of attorney set forth in this Agreement and (v) given the consents and approvals and made the waivers contained in this Agreement. 

  

 Section 4.6 _ Restrictions on Transfers._ 

  

 (a) Except as provided in Section 4.6(c) below, but notwithstanding the other provisions of this Article IV, no transfer of any Partnership Interests shall be made if such transfer would (i) violate the then applicable federal or state securities laws or rules and regulations of the Commission, any state securities commission or any other governmental authority with jurisdiction over such transfer, (ii) terminate the existence or qualification of the Partnership or the Operating Company under the laws of the jurisdiction of its formation, or (iii) cause the Partnership or the Operating Company to be treated as an association taxable as a corporation or otherwise to be taxed as an entity for federal income tax purposes (to the extent not already so treated or taxed). 

  

 (b) The General Partner may impose restrictions on the transfer of Partnership Interests if a subsequent Opinion of Counsel determines that such restrictions are necessary to avoid a significant risk of any Group Member becoming taxable as a corporation or otherwise to be taxed as an entity for federal income tax purposes. The restrictions may be imposed by making such amendments to this Agreement as the General Partner may determine to be necessary or appropriate to impose such restrictions; _provided, however_ , that any amendment that the General Partner believes, in the exercise of its reasonable discretion, could result in the delisting or suspension of trading of any class of Limited Partner Interests on the principal National Securities Exchange on which such class of Limited Partner Interests is then traded must be approved, prior to such amendment being effected, by the holders of at least a majority of the Outstanding Limited Partner Interests of such class. 

  

 (c) Nothing contained in this Article IV, or elsewhere in this Agreement, shall preclude the settlement of any transactions involving Partnership Interests entered into through the facilities of any National Securities Exchange on which such Partnership Interests are listed for trading. 

  

 (d) The General Partner Interest shall not be transferred to any Person for any reason whatsoever. So long as the Partnership is a limited partnership, 100% of the General Partner Interests, if any, shall be owned, beneficially and of record, by the Partnership or one of more of its wholly owned subsidiaries. 

        
  

 Section 4.7 _ Citizenship Certificates; Non-citizen Assignees._ 

  

 (a) If any Group Member is or becomes subject to any federal, state or local law or regulation that, in the reasonable determination of the General Partner, creates a substantial risk of cancellation or forfeiture of any property in which the Group Member has an interest based on the nationality, citizenship or other related status of a Limited Partner or Assignee, the General Partner may request any Limited Partner or Assignee to furnish to the General Partner, within 30 days after receipt of such request, an executed Citizenship Certification or such other information concerning his nationality, citizenship or other related status (or, if the Limited Partner or Assignee is a nominee holding for the account of another Person, the nationality, citizenship or other related status of such Person) as the General Partner may request. If a Limited Partner or Assignee fails to furnish to the General Partner within the aforementioned 30-day period such Citizenship Certification or other requested information or if upon receipt of such Citizenship Certification or other requested information the General Partner determines, with the advice of counsel, that a Limited Partner or Assignee is not an Eligible Citizen, the Partnership Interests owned by such Limited Partner or Assignee shall be subject to redemption in accordance with the provisions of Section 4.8. In addition, the General Partner may require that the status of any such Partner or Assignee be changed to that of a Non-citizen Assignee and, thereupon, the General Partner shall be substituted for such Non-citizen Assignee as the Limited Partner in respect of his Limited Partner Interests. 

  

 (b) The General Partner shall, in exercising voting rights in respect of Limited Partner Interests held by it on behalf of Non-citizen Assignees, distribute the votes in the same ratios as the votes of Partners (including without limitation the General Partner) in respect of Limited Partner Interests other than those of Non-citizen Assignees are cast, either for, against or abstaining as to the matter. 

  

 (c) Upon dissolution of the Partnership, a Non-citizen Assignee shall have no right to receive a distribution in kind pursuant to Section 12.3 but shall be entitled to the cash equivalent thereof, and the Partnership shall provide cash in exchange for an assignment of the Non-citizen Assignee\'s share of the distribution in kind. Such payment and assignment shall be treated for Partnership purposes as a purchase by the Partnership from the Non-citizen Assignee of his Limited Partner Interest (representing his right to receive his share of such distribution in kind). 

  

 (d) At any time after he can and does certify that he has become an Eligible Citizen, a Non-citizen Assignee may, upon application to the General Partner, request admission as a Substituted Limited Partner with respect to any Limited Partner Interests of such Non-citizen Assignee not redeemed pursuant to Section 4.8, and upon his admission pursuant to Section 10.1, the General Partner shall cease to be deemed to be the Limited Partner in respect of the Non-citizen Assignee\'s Limited Partner Interests. 

  

 Section 4.8 _ Redemption of Partnership Interests of Non-citizen Assignees._ 

  

 (a) If at any time a Limited Partner or Assignee fails to furnish a Citizenship Certification or other information requested within the 30-day period specified in Section 4.7(a), or if upon receipt of such Citizenship Certification or other information the General Partner determines, with the advice of counsel, that a Limited Partner or Assignee is not an Eligible Citizen, the Partnership may, unless the Limited Partner or Assignee establishes to the satisfaction of the General Partner that such Limited Partner or Assignee is an Eligible Citizen or has transferred his Partnership Interests to a Person who is an Eligible Citizen and who furnishes a Citizenship Certification to the General Partner prior to the date fixed for redemption as provided below, redeem the Partnership Interest of such Limited Partner or Assignee as follows: 

  

  

 (i) The General Partner shall, not later than the 30th day before the date fixed for redemption, give notice of redemption to the Limited Partner or Assignee, at his last address designated on the records of the Partnership or the Transfer Agent, by registered or certified mail, 

  

      

  

postage prepaid. The notice shall be deemed to have been given when so
mailed. The notice shall specify the Redeemable Interests, the date fixed for
redemption, the place of payment, that payment of the redemption price will
be made upon surrender of the Certificate evidencing the Redeemable Interests
and that on and after the date fixed for redemption no further allocations or
distributions to which the Limited Partner or Assignee would otherwise be
entitled in respect of the Redeemable Interests will accrue or be made.

   

 (ii) The aggregate redemption price for Redeemable Interests shall be an amount equal to the Current Market Price (the date of determination of which shall be the date fixed for redemption) of Limited Partner Interests of the class to be so redeemed multiplied by the number of Limited Partner Interests of each such class included among the Redeemable Interests. The redemption price shall be paid, in the discretion of the General Partner, in cash or by delivery of a promissory note of the Partnership in the principal amount of the redemption price, bearing interest at the rate of 10% annually and payable in three equal annual installments of principal together with accrued interest, commencing one year after the redemption date. 

   

 (iii) Upon surrender by or on behalf of the Limited Partner or Assignee, at the place specified in the notice of redemption, of the Certificate evidencing the Redeemable Interests, duly endorsed in blank or accompanied by an assignment duly executed in blank, the Limited Partner or Assignee or his duly authorized representative shall be entitled to receive the payment therefor. 

  

 (iv) After the redemption date, Redeemable Interests shall no longer constitute issued and Outstanding Limited Partner Interests. 

  

  

 (b) The provisions of this Section 4.8 shall also be applicable to Limited Partner Interests held by a Limited Partner or Assignee as nominee of a Person determined to be other than an Eligible Citizen. 

  

 (c) Nothing in this Section 4.8 shall prevent the recipient of a notice of redemption from transferring his Limited Partner Interest before the redemption date if such transfer is otherwise permitted under this Agreement. Upon receipt of notice of such a transfer, the General Partner shall withdraw the notice of redemption, provided the transferee of such Limited Partner Interest certifies to the satisfaction of the General Partner in a Citizenship Certification delivered in connection with the Transfer Application that he is an Eligible Citizen. If the transferee fails to make such certification, such redemption shall be effected from the transferee on the original redemption date. 

  

ARTICLE V 
 CAPITAL CONTRIBUTIONS AND ISSUANCE OF PARTNERSHIP INTERESTS

  

 Section 5.1 _ Contributions._ On the date hereof, the Partnership: (i) issued 18,506,132 Class A Units to the General Partner in exchange for (A) the General Partner Interest constituting the 2% economic interest (but not the other rights, privileges and obligations related to the General Partner Interest), which represented the right to be allocated 2% of the income, gains, losses and deductions of the Partnership and to receive 2% of the distributions made by the Partnership and (B) the Incentive Distribution Rights; (ii) issued 5,900,000 Class A Units to MarkWest Hydrocarbon, Inc. in exchange for 4,938,992 Common Units, which represented all of its holdings of the Common Units; and (iii) cancelled such portion of the General Partner Interest, the Incentive Distribution Rights and the Common Units. 

  

 Section 5.2 _ Interest and Withdrawal._ No interest shall be paid by the Partnership on Capital Contributions. No Partner or Assignee shall be entitled to the withdrawal or return of its Capital Contribution, except to the extent, if any, that distributions made pursuant to this Agreement or upon termination of the Partnership may be considered as such by law and then only to the extent provided for in this Agreement. Except to the extent expressly provided in this Agreement, no Partner or Assignee shall have priority over any other Partner or Assignee either as to the return of Capital 

        
  

Contributions or as to profits, losses or distributions. Any such return
shall be a compromise to which all Partners and Assignees agree within the
meaning of Section 17-502(b) of the Delaware Act.

  

 Section 5.3 _ Capital Accounts._ 

  

 (a) The Partnership shall maintain for each Limited Partner (or a beneficial owner of Partnership Interests held by a nominee in any case in which the nominee has furnished the identity of such owner to the Partnership in accordance with Section 6031(c) of the Code or any other method acceptable to the General Partner in its sole discretion) owning a Partnership Interest a separate Capital Account with respect to such Partnership Interest in accordance with the rules of Treasury Regulation Section 1.704-1(b)(2)(iv). Such Capital Account shall be increased by (i) the amount of all Capital Contributions made to the Partnership with respect to such Partnership Interest pursuant to this Agreement and (ii) all items of Partnership income and gain (including, without limitation, income and gain exempt from tax) computed in accordance with Section 5.3(b) and allocated with respect to such Partnership Interest pursuant to Section 6.1, and decreased by (x) the amount of cash or Net Agreed Value of all actual and deemed distributions of cash or property made with respect to such Partnership Interest pursuant to this Agreement and (y) all items of Partnership deduction and loss computed in accordance with Section 5.3(b) and allocated with respect to such Partnership Interest pursuant to Section 6.1. 

  

 (b) For purposes of computing the amount of any item of income, gain, loss or deduction which is to be allocated pursuant to Article VI and is to be reflected in the Partners\' Capital Accounts, the determination, recognition and classification of any such item shall be the same as its determination, recognition and classification for federal income tax purposes (including, without limitation, any method of depreciation, cost recovery or amortization used for that purpose), provided, that: 

  

  

 (i) Solely for purposes of this Section 5.3, the Partnership shall be treated as owning directly its proportionate share (as determined by the General Partner based upon the provisions of the Operating Company Agreement) of all property owned by the Operating Company or any other Subsidiary that is classified as a partnership for federal income tax purposes. 

  

 (ii) All fees and other expenses incurred by the Partnership to promote the sale of (or to sell) a Partnership Interest that can neither be deducted nor amortized under Section 709 of the Code, if any, shall, for purposes of Capital Account maintenance, be treated as an item of deduction at the time such fees and other expenses are incurred and shall be allocated among the Partners pursuant to Section 6.1. 

  

 (iii) Except as otherwise provided in Treasury Regulation Section 1.704-1(b)(2)(iv)(m), the computation of all items of income, gain, loss and deduction shall be made without regard to any election under Section 754 of the Code which may be made by the Partnership and, as to those items described in Section 705(a)(1)(B) or 705(a)(2)(B) of the Code, without regard to the fact that such items are not includable in gross income or are neither currently deductible nor capitalized for federal income tax purposes. To the extent an adjustment to the adjusted tax basis of any Partnership asset pursuant to Section 734(b) or 743(b) of the Code is required, pursuant to Treasury Regulation Section 1.704-1(b)(2)(iv)(m), to be taken into account in determining Capital Accounts, the amount of such adjustment in the Capital Accounts shall be treated as an item of gain or loss. 

  

 (iv) Any income, gain or loss attributable to the taxable disposition of any Partnership property shall be determined as if the adjusted basis of such property as of such date of disposition were equal in amount to the Partnership\'s Carrying Value with respect to such property as of such date. 

  

 (v) In accordance with the requirements of Section 704(b) of the Code, any deductions for depreciation, cost recovery or amortization attributable to any Contributed Property shall be 

  

      

  
  

determined as if the adjusted basis of such property on the date it was
acquired by the Partnership were equal to the Agreed Value of such property.
Upon an adjustment pursuant to Section 5.3(d) to the Carrying Value of any
Partnership property subject to depreciation, cost recovery or amortization,
any further deductions for such depreciation, cost recovery or amortization
attributable to such property shall be determined (A) as if the adjusted basis
of such property were equal to the Carrying Value of such property immediately
following such adjustment and (B) using a rate of depreciation, cost recovery
or amortization derived from the same method and useful life (or, if
applicable, the remaining useful life) as is applied for federal income tax
purposes; _provided, however_ , that, if the asset has a zero adjusted basis
for federal income tax purposes, depreciation, cost recovery or amortization
deductions shall be determined using any reasonable method that the General
Partner may adopt.

  

 (vi) If the Partnership\'s adjusted basis in a depreciable or cost recovery property is reduced for federal income tax purposes pursuant to Section 48(q)(1) or 48(q)(3) of the Code, the amount of such reduction shall, solely for purposes hereof, be deemed to be an additional depreciation or cost recovery deduction in the year such property is placed in service and shall be allocated among the Partners pursuant to Section 6.1. Any restoration of such basis pursuant to Section 48(q)(2) of the Code shall, to the extent possible, be allocated in the same manner to the Partners to whom such deemed deduction was allocated. 

  

  

 (c) A transferee of a Partnership Interest shall succeed to a pro rata portion of the Capital Account of the transferor relating to the Partnership Interest so transferred. 

  

 (d) (i) In accordance with Treasury Regulation Section 1.704-1(b)(2)(iv)(f), on an issuance of additional Partnership Interests for cash or Contributed Property, the Capital Account of all Partners and the Carrying Value of each Partnership property immediately prior to such issuance shall be adjusted upward or downward to reflect any Unrealized Gain or Unrealized Loss attributable to such Partnership property, as if such Unrealized Gain or Unrealized Loss had been recognized on an actual sale of each such property immediately prior to such issuance and had been allocated to the Partners at such time pursuant to Section 6.1 in the same manner as any item of gain or loss actually recognized during such period would have been allocated. In determining such Unrealized Gain or Unrealized Loss, the aggregate cash amount and fair market value of all Partnership assets (including, without limitation, cash or cash equivalents) immediately prior to the issuance of additional Partnership Interests shall be determined by the General Partner using such reasonable method of valuation as it may adopt; _provided, however_ ,  that the General Partner, in arriving at such valuation, must take fully into account the fair market value of the Partnership Interests of all Partners at such time. The General Partner shall allocate such aggregate value among the assets of the Partnership (in such manner as it determines in its discretion to be reasonable) to arrive at a fair market value for individual properties. 

  

  

 (ii) In accordance with Treasury Regulation Section 1.704-1(b)(2)(iv)(f), immediately prior to any actual or deemed distribution to a Partner of any Partnership property (other than a distribution of cash that is not in redemption or retirement of a Partnership Interest), the Capital Accounts of all Partners and the Carrying Value of all Partnership property shall be adjusted upward or downward to reflect any Unrealized Gain or Unrealized Loss attributable to such Partnership property, as if such Unrealized Gain or Unrealized Loss had been recognized in a sale of such property immediately prior to such distribution for an amount equal to its fair market value, and had been allocated to the Partners, at such time, pursuant to Section 6.1 in the same manner as any item of gain or loss actually recognized during such period would have been allocated. In determining such Unrealized Gain or Unrealized Loss the aggregate cash amount and fair market value of all Partnership assets (including, without limitation, cash or cash equivalents) immediately prior to a distribution shall (A) in the case of an actual distribution which is not made pursuant to Section 12.3 or in the case of a deemed distribution, be determined and allocated in 

  

      

  

the same manner as that provided in Section 5.3(d)(i) or (B) in the case of a
liquidating distribution pursuant to Section 12.3, be determined and allocated
by the Liquidator using such reasonable method of valuation as it may adopt.

  

  

 Section 5.4 _ Issuances of Additional Partnership Securities._ 

  

 (a) The Partnership may issue additional Partnership Securities and options, rights, warrants and appreciation rights relating to the Partnership Securities for any Partnership purpose at any time and from time to time to such Persons for such consideration and on such terms and conditions as shall be established by the General Partner in its sole discretion, all without the approval of any Limited Partners. 

  

 (b) Each additional Partnership Security authorized to be issued by the Partnership pursuant to Section 5.4(a) may be issued in one or more classes, or one or more series of any such classes, with such designations, preferences, rights, powers and duties (which may be senior to existing classes and series of Partnership Securities), as shall be fixed by the General Partner in the exercise of its sole discretion, including (i) the right to share Partnership profits and losses or items thereof; (ii) the right to share in Partnership distributions; (iii) the rights upon dissolution and liquidation of the Partnership; (iv) whether, and the terms and conditions upon which, the Partnership may redeem the Partnership Security; (v) whether such Partnership Security is issued with the privilege of conversion or exchange and, if so, the terms and conditions of such conversion or exchange; (vi) the terms and conditions upon which each Partnership Security will be issued, evidenced by certificates and assigned or transferred; and (vii) the right, if any, of each such Partnership Security to vote on Partnership matters, including matters relating to the relative rights, preferences and privileges of such Partnership Security. 

  

 (c) The General Partner is hereby authorized and directed to take all actions that it deems necessary or appropriate in connection with (i) each issuance of Partnership Securities and options, rights, warrants and appreciation rights relating to Partnership Securities pursuant to this Section 5.4, (ii) the admission of Additional Limited Partners and (iii) all additional issuances of Partnership Securities. The General Partner is further authorized and directed to specify the relative rights, powers and duties of the holders of the Units or other Partnership Securities being so issued. The General Partner shall do all things necessary to comply with the Delaware Act and is authorized and directed to do all things it deems to be necessary or advisable in connection with any future issuance of Partnership Securities or in connection with the conversion of the General Partner Interest into Units pursuant to the terms of this Agreement, including compliance with any statute, rule, regulation or guideline of any federal, state or other governmental agency or any National Securities Exchange on which the Units or other Partnership Securities are listed for trading. 

  

 (d) No fractional Units shall be issued by the Partnership. 

  

 Section 5.5 _ Splits and Combinations._ 

  

 (a) Subject to Section 5.5(d), the Partnership may make a Pro Rata distribution of Partnership Securities to all Record Holders or may effect a subdivision or combination of Partnership Securities so long as, after any such event, each Partner shall have the same Percentage Interest in the Partnership as before such event, and any amounts calculated on a per Unit basis or stated as a number of Units are proportionately adjusted retroactive to the beginning of the Partnership. 

  

 (b) Whenever such a distribution, subdivision or combination of Partnership Securities is declared, the General Partner shall select a Record Date as of which the distribution, subdivision or combination shall be effective and shall send notice thereof at least 20 days prior to such Record Date to each Record Holder as of a date not less than 10 days prior to the date of such notice. The General Partner also may cause a firm of independent public accountants selected by it to calculate the number of Partnership Securities to be held by each Record Holder after giving effect to such distribution, 

        
  

subdivision or combination. The General Partner shall be entitled to rely on
any certificate provided by such firm as conclusive evidence of the accuracy
of such calculation.

  

 (c) Promptly following any such distribution, subdivision or combination, the Partnership may issue Certificates to the Record Holders of Partnership Securities as of the applicable Record Date representing the new number of Partnership Securities held by such Record Holders, or the General Partner may adopt such other procedures as it may deem appropriate to reflect such changes. If any such combination results in a smaller total number of Partnership Securities Outstanding, the Partnership shall require, as a condition to the delivery to a Record Holder of such new Certificate, the surrender of any Certificate held by such Record Holder immediately prior to such Record Date. 

  

 (d) The Partnership shall not issue fractional Units upon any distribution, subdivision or combination of Units. If a distribution, subdivision or combination of Units would result in the issuance of fractional Units but for the provisions of Section 5.4(d) and this Section 5.5(d), each fractional Unit shall be rounded to the nearest whole Unit (and a 0.5 Unit shall be rounded to the next higher Unit). 

  

 Section 5.6 _ Fully Paid and Non-Assessable Nature of Limited Partner Interests._ All Limited Partner Interests issued pursuant to, and in accordance with the requirements of, this Article V shall be fully paid and non-assessable Limited Partner Interests in the Partnership, except as such non-assessability may be affected by Section 17-607 of the Delaware Act. 

  

ARTICLE VI 
 ALLOCATIONS AND DISTRIBUTIONS

  

 Section 6.1 _ Allocations for Capital Account Purposes._ For purposes of maintaining the Capital Accounts and in determining the rights of the Partners among themselves, the Partnership\'s items of income, gain, loss and deduction (computed in accordance with Section 5.3(b)) shall be allocated among the Partners in each taxable year (or portion thereof) as provided herein below. 

   

 (a) _ Net Income and Net Loss._ After giving effect to the special allocations set forth in Section 6.1(c), Net Income and Net Loss for each taxable period and all items of income, gain, loss and deduction taken into account in computing Net Income and Net Loss for such taxable period shall be allocated to the Unitholders, Pro Rata. 

  

 (b) _ Certain Special Allocations._ 

  

  

 (i) All Hydrocarbon Items shall be allocated to the Common Unitholders, Pro Rata. 

   

 (ii) All items of deduction and loss attributable to the New Cobb plant shall be allocated to the General Partner in its capacity as a holder of Class A Units or any subsequent holder of such Class A Units. 

  

  

 (c) _ Other Special Allocations._ Notwithstanding any other provision of this Section 6.1, the following special allocations shall be made for such taxable period: 

  

  

 (i) _Partnership Minimum Gain Chargeback._ Notwithstanding any other provision of this Section 6.1, if there is a net decrease in Partnership Minimum Gain during any Partnership taxable period, each Partner shall be allocated items of Partnership income and gain for such period (and, if necessary, subsequent periods) in the manner and amounts provided in Treasury Regulation Sections 1.704-2(f)(6), 1.704-2(g)(2) and 1.704-2(j)(2)(i), or any successor provision. For purposes of this Section 6.1(c)(i), each Partner\'s Adjusted Capital Account balance shall be determined, and the allocation of income or gain required hereunder shall be effected, prior to the application of any other allocations pursuant to this Section 6.1(c)(i) with respect to such taxable period (other than an allocation pursuant to Section 6.1(c)(v) and Section 6.1(c)(vi)). This Section 6.1(c)(i) is intended to comply with the Partnership Minimum Gain chargeback requirement in Treasury Regulation Section 1.704-2(f) and shall be interpreted consistently therewith. 

  

      

   

  

 (ii) _Chargeback of Partner Nonrecourse Debt Minimum Gain._ Notwithstanding the other provisions of this Section 6.1 (other than Section 6.1(c)(i)), except as provided in Treasury Regulation Section 1.704-2(i)(4), if there is a net decrease in Partner Nonrecourse Debt Minimum Gain during any Partnership taxable period, any Partner with a share of Partner Nonrecourse Debt Minimum Gain at the beginning of such taxable period shall be allocated items of Partnership income and gain for such period (and, if necessary, subsequent periods) in the manner and amounts provided in Treasury Regulation Sections 1.704-2(i)(4) and 1.704-2(j)(2)(ii), or any successor provisions. For purposes of this Section 6.1(c)(ii), each Partner\'s Adjusted Capital Account balance shall be determined, and the allocation of income or gain required hereunder shall be effected, prior to the application of any other allocations pursuant to this Section 6.1(c)(ii), other than Section 6.1(c)(i) and other than an allocation pursuant to Section 6.1(c)(v) and Section 6.1(c)(vi), with respect to such taxable period. This Section 6.1(c)(ii) is intended to comply with the chargeback of items of income and gain requirement in Treasury Regulation Section 1.704-2(i)(4) and shall be interpreted consistently therewith. 

  

 (iii) _ Qualified Income Offset._ In the event any Partner unexpectedly receives any adjustments, allocations or distributions described in Treasury Regulation Section 1.704-1(b)(2)(ii)(d)(4), 1.704-1(b)(2)(ii)(d)(5), or 1.704-1(b)(2)(ii)(d)(6), items of Partnership income and gain shall be specially allocated to such Partner in an amount and manner sufficient to eliminate, to the extent required by the Treasury Regulations promulgated under Section 704(b) of the Code, the deficit balance, if any, in its Adjusted Capital Account created by such adjustments, allocations or distributions as quickly as possible unless such deficit balance is otherwise eliminated pursuant to Section 6.1(c)(i) or 6.1(c)(ii). 

  

 (iv) _ Gross Income Allocations._ In the event any Partner has a deficit balance in its Capital Account at the end of any Partnership taxable period in excess of the sum of (A) the amount such Partner is required to restore pursuant to the provisions of this Agreement and (B) the amount such Partner is deemed obligated to restore pursuant to Treasury Regulation Sections 1.704-2(g) and 1.704-2(i)(5), such Partner shall be specially allocated items of Partnership gross income and gain in the amount of such excess as quickly as possible; _provided, however,_ that an allocation pursuant to this Section 6.1(c)(iv) shall be made only if and to the extent that such Partner would have a deficit balance in its Capital Account as adjusted after all other allocations provided for in this Section 6.1 have been tentatively made as if this Section 6.1(c)(iv) were not in this Agreement. 

  

 (v) _ Nonrecourse Deductions._ Nonrecourse Deductions for any taxable period shall be allocated to the Partners in accordance with their respective Percentage Interests. If the General Partner determines in its good faith discretion that the Partnership\'s Nonrecourse Deductions must be allocated in a different ratio to satisfy the safe harbor requirements of the Treasury Regulations promulgated under Section 704(b) of the Code, the General Partner is authorized, upon notice to the other Partners, to revise the prescribed ratio to the numerically closest ratio that does satisfy such requirements. 

  

 (vi) _ Partner Nonrecourse Deductions._ Partner Nonrecourse Deductions for any taxable period shall be allocated 100% to the Partner that bears the Economic Risk of Loss with respect to the Partner Nonrecourse Debt to which such Partner Nonrecourse Deductions are attributable in accordance with Treasury Regulation Section 1.704-2(i). If more than one Partner bears the Economic Risk of Loss with respect to a Partner Nonrecourse Debt, such Partner Nonrecourse Deductions attributable thereto shall be allocated between or among such Partners in accordance with the ratios in which they share such Economic Risk of Loss. 

  

 (vii) _ Nonrecourse Liabilities._ For purposes of Treasury Regulation Section 1.752-3(a)(3), the Partners agree that Nonrecourse Liabilities of the Partnership in excess of the sum of (A) the 

  

      

  
  

amount of Partnership Minimum Gain and (B) the total amount of Nonrecourse
Built-in Gain shall be allocated among the Partners in accordance with their
respective Percentage Interests.

  

 (viii) _ Code Section 754 Adjustments._ To the extent an adjustment to the adjusted tax basis of any Partnership asset pursuant to Section 734(b) or 743(c) of the Code is required, pursuant to Treasury Regulation Section 1.704-1(b)(2)(iv)(m), to be taken into account in determining Capital Accounts, the amount of such adjustment to the Capital Accounts shall be treated as an item of gain (if the adjustment increases the basis of the asset) or loss (if the adjustment decreases such basis), and such item of gain or loss shall be specially allocated to the Partners in a manner consistent with the manner in which their Capital Accounts are required to be adjusted pursuant to such Section of the Treasury Regulations. 

  

 (ix) _ Curative Allocation._ 

    

 (A) Notwithstanding any other provision of this Section 6.1, other than the Required Allocations, the Required Allocations shall be taken into account in making the Agreed Allocations so that, to the extent possible, the net amount of items of income, gain, loss and deduction allocated to each Partner pursuant to the Required Allocations and the Agreed Allocations, together, shall be equal to the net amount of such items that would have been allocated to each such Partner under the Agreed Allocations had the Required Allocations and the related Curative Allocation not otherwise been provided in this Section 6.1. Notwithstanding the preceding sentence, Required Allocations relating to (1) Nonrecourse Deductions shall not be taken into account except to the extent that there has been a decrease in Partnership Minimum Gain and (2) Partner Nonrecourse Deductions shall not be taken into account except to the extent that there has been a decrease in Partner Nonrecourse Debt Minimum Gain. Allocations pursuant to this Section 6.1(c)(ix)(A) shall only be made with respect to Required Allocations to the extent the General Partner reasonably determines that such allocations will otherwise be inconsistent with the economic agreement among the Partners. Further, allocations pursuant to this Section 6.1(c)(ix)(A) shall be deferred with respect to allocations pursuant to clauses (1) and (2) hereof to the extent the General Partner reasonably determines that such allocations are likely to be offset by subsequent Required Allocations. 

  

 (B) The General Partner shall have reasonable discretion, with respect to each taxable period, to (1) apply the provisions of Section 6.1(c)(ix)(A) in whatever order is most likely to minimize the economic distortions that might otherwise result from the Required Allocations, and (2) divide all allocations pursuant to Section 6.1(c)(ix)(A) among the Partners in a manner that is likely to minimize such economic distortions. 

    

 (x) Items of income and gain allocated under the foregoing provision of Section 6.1(c)(i), 6.1(c)(ii), 6.1(c)(iii) or 6.1(c)(viii) that are Hydrocarbon Items shall, to the maximum extent possible, be allocated to the Common Unitholders, Pro Rata. 

  

  

 Section 6.2 _ Allocations for Tax Purposes._ 

   

 (a) Except as otherwise provided herein, for federal income tax purposes, each item of income, gain, loss and deduction shall be allocated among the Partners in the same manner as its correlative item of "book" income, gain, loss or deduction is allocated pursuant to Section 6.1. 

  

 (b) In an attempt to eliminate Book-Tax Disparities attributable to a Contributed Property or Adjusted Property, items of income, gain, loss, depreciation, amortization and cost recovery deductions shall be allocated for federal income tax purposes among the Partners as follows: 

  

  

 (i) In the case of a Contributed Property, such items attributable thereto (A) shall be allocated among the Partners in the manner provided under Section 704(c) of the Code that takes 

  

      

  

into account the variation between the Agreed Value of such property and its
adjusted basis at the time of contribution; and (B) any item of Residual Gain
or Residual Loss attributable to a Contributed Property shall be allocated
among the Partners in the same manner as its correlative item of "book" gain
or loss is allocated pursuant to Section 6.1.

   

 (ii) In the case of an Adjusted Property, such items shall (A) first, be allocated among the Partners in a manner consistent with the principles of Section 704(c) of the Code to take into account the Unrealized Gain or Unrealized Loss attributable to such property and the allocations thereof pursuant to Section 5.3(d)(i) or 5.3(d)(ii), (B) second, in the event such property was originally a Contributed Property, be allocated among the Partners in a manner consistent with Section 6.2(b)(i)(A) and (C) third, any item of Residual Gain or Residual Loss attributable to an Adjusted Property shall be allocated among the Partners in the same manner as its correlative item of "book" gain or loss is allocated pursuant to Section 6.1. 

  

 (iii) The General Partner shall apply the principles of Treasury Regulation Section 1.704-3(d) to eliminate Book-Tax Disparities. 

  

  

 (c) For the proper administration of the Partnership and for the preservation of uniformity of the Limited Partner Interests (or any class or classes thereof), the General Partner shall have sole discretion to (i) adopt such conventions as it deems appropriate in determining the amount of depreciation, amortization and cost recovery deductions; (ii) make special allocations for federal income tax purposes of income (including, without limitation, gross income) or deductions; and (iii) amend the provisions of this Agreement as appropriate (x) to reflect the proposal or promulgation of Treasury Regulations under Section 704(b) or Section 704(c) of the Code or (y) otherwise to preserve or achieve uniformity of the Limited Partner Interests (or any class or classes thereof). The General Partner may adopt such conventions, make such allocations and make such amendments to this Agreement as provided in this Section 6.2(c) only if such conventions, allocations or amendments would not have a material adverse effect on the Partners, the holders of any class or classes of Limited Partner Interests issued and Outstanding or the Partnership, and if such allocations are consistent with the principles of Section 704 of the Code. 

  

 (d) The General Partner in its discretion may determine to depreciate or amortize the portion of an adjustment under Section 743(b) of the Code attributable to unrealized appreciation in any Adjusted Property (to the extent of the unamortized Book-Tax Disparity) using a predetermined rate derived from the depreciation or amortization method and useful life applied to the Partnership\'s common basis of such property, despite any inconsistency of such approach with Treasury Regulation Section 1.167(c)-l(a)(6) or any successor regulations thereto. If the General Partner determines that such reporting position cannot reasonably be taken, the General Partner may adopt depreciation and amortization conventions under which all purchasers acquiring Limited Partner Interests in the same month would receive depreciation and amortization deductions, based upon the same applicable rate as if they had purchased a direct interest in the Partnership\'s property. If the General Partner chooses not to utilize such aggregate method, the General Partner may use any other reasonable depreciation and amortization conventions to preserve the uniformity of the intrinsic tax characteristics of any Limited Partner Interests that would not have a material adverse effect on the Limited Partners or the Record Holders of any class or classes of Limited Partner Interests. 

  

 (e) Any gain allocated to the Partners upon the sale or other taxable disposition of any Partnership asset shall, to the extent possible, after taking into account other required allocations of gain pursuant to this Section 6.2, be characterized as Recapture Income in the same proportions and to the same extent as such Partners (or their predecessors in interest) have been allocated any deductions directly or indirectly giving rise to the treatment of such gains as Recapture Income. 

   

 (f) All items of income, gain, loss, deduction and credit recognized by the Partnership for federal income tax purposes and allocated to the Partners in accordance with the provisions hereof shall be 

        
  

determined without regard to any election under Section 754 of the Code which
may be made by the Partnership; _provided, however_ , that such allocations,
once made, shall be adjusted as necessary or appropriate to take into account
those adjustments permitted or required by Sections 734 and 743 of the Code.

   

 (g) Each item of Partnership income, gain, loss and deduction shall for federal income tax purposes, be determined on an annual basis and prorated on a monthly basis and shall be allocated to the Partners as of the opening of the New York Stock Exchange on the first Business Day of each month; _provided, however,_ that gain or loss on a sale or other disposition of any assets of the Partnership or any other extraordinary item of income or loss realized and recognized other than in the ordinary course of business, as determined by the General Partner in its sole discretion, shall be allocated to the Partners as of the opening of the New York Stock Exchange on the first Business Day of the month in which such gain or loss is recognized for federal income tax purposes. The General Partner may revise, alter or otherwise modify such methods of allocation as it determines necessary or appropriate in its sole discretion, to the extent permitted or required by Section 706 of the Code and the regulations or rulings promulgated thereunder. 

  

 (h) Allocations that would otherwise be made to a Limited Partner under the provisions of this Article VI shall instead be made to the beneficial owner of Limited Partner Interests held by a nominee in any case in which the nominee has furnished the identity of such owner to the Partnership in accordance with Section 6031(c) of the Code or any other method acceptable to the General Partner in its sole discretion. 

  

 Section 6.3 _ Distributions._ 

  

 (a) Subject to Section 6.3(f), within 45 days following the end of each Quarter, an amount equal to 100% of Available Cash with respect to such Quarter shall, subject to Section 17-607 of the Delaware Act, be distributed in accordance with this Article VI by the Partnership to the Unitholders, Pro Rata, as of the Record Date selected by the General Partner in its reasonable discretion. 

  

 (b) Notwithstanding Section 6.3(a), in the event of the dissolution and liquidation of the Partnership, all receipts received during or after the Quarter in which the Liquidation Date occurs, other than from borrowings described in (a)(ii) of the definition of Available Cash, shall be applied and distributed solely in accordance with, and subject to the terms and conditions of, Section 12.3. 

  

 (c) In the event of the dissolution and liquidation of the Partnership, all receipts received during or after the Quarter in which the Liquidation Date occurs shall be applied and distributed solely in accordance with, and subject to the terms and conditions of, Section 12.3. 

   

 (d) The General Partner shall have the discretion to treat taxes paid by the Partnership on behalf of, or amounts withheld with respect to, all or less than all of the Partners as if they had been distributed to the Partner on whose behalf the taxes were paid or withheld. 

  

 (e) Each distribution in respect of a Partnership Interest shall be paid by the Partnership, directly or through the Transfer Agent or through any other Person or agent, only to the Record Holder of such Partnership Interest as of the Record Date set for such distribution. Such payment shall constitute full payment and satisfaction of the Partnership\'s liability in respect of such payment, regardless of any claim of any Person who may have an interest in such payment by reason of an assignment or otherwise. 

   

 (f) All Hydrocarbon Available Cash shall be distributed to the Common Unitholders, Pro Rata. 

  

 (g) All other distributions of cash and other property shall be made to all Unitholders (Common Unitholders and Class A Unitholders), Pro Rata. 

        
 

    
ARTICLE VII

 Section 7.1 _ Corporate Governance._ The corporate governance of the Partnership, the General Partner or the Board of Directors shall be governed by all applicable rules, regulations, guidelines or requirements of the National Securities Exchange on which such Partnership Interests are listed for trading without regard to any exemptions provided to limited partnerships under such National Securities Exchange. 

  

 Section 7.2 _ Management._ 

  

 (a) The General Partner shall conduct, direct and manage all activities of the Partnership.

In addition to the powers now or hereafter granted a general partner of a limited partnership under applicable law or which are granted to the General Partner under any other provision of this Agreement, the General Partner, subject to Section 7.4, shall have full power and authority to do all things and on such terms as it, in its sole discretion, may deem necessary or appropriate to conduct the business of the Partnership, to exercise all powers set forth in Section 2.5 and to effectuate the purposes set forth in Section 2.4, including the following:

 (iv) the use of the assets of the Partnership (including cash on hand) for any purpose consistent with the terms of this Agreement, including the financing of the conduct of the operations of the Partnership Group; subject to Section 7.7(a), the lending of funds to other Persons (including other Group Members); the repayment or guarantee of obligations of the Partnership Group; and the making of capital contributions to any member of the Partnership Group; 

  

 (v) the negotiation, execution and performance of any contracts, conveyances or other instruments (including instruments that limit the liability of the Partnership under contractual arrangements to all or particular assets of the Partnership, with the other party to the contract to have no recourse against the General Partner or its assets other than its interest in the Partnership, even if same results in the terms of the transaction being less favorable to the Partnership than would otherwise be the case); 

  

 (vi) the distribution of Partnership cash;

 (viii) the maintenance of such insurance for the benefit of the Partnership Group and the Partners as it deems necessary or appropriate; 

  

 (ix) the formation of, or acquisition of an interest in, and the contribution of property and the making of loans to, any further limited or general partnerships, joint ventures, corporations, limited liability companies or other relationships (including the acquisition of interests in, and the contributions of property to, any Group Member from time to time) subject to the restrictions set forth in Section 2.4; 

  

 (x) the control of any matters affecting the rights and obligations of the Partnership, including the bringing and defending of actions at law or in equity and otherwise engaging in the conduct of litigation and the incurring of legal expense and the settlement of claims and litigation; 

  

 (xi) the indemnification of any Person against liabilities and contingencies to the extent permitted by law; 

  

 (xii) the entering into of listing agreements with any National Securities Exchange and the delisting of some or all of the Limited Partner Interests from, or requesting that trading be suspended on, any such exchange (subject to any prior approval that may be required under Section 4.6);

 Section 7.3 _ Certificate of Limited Partnership._ The General Partner has caused the Certificate of Limited Partnership to be filed with the Secretary of State of the State of Delaware as required by the Delaware Act. The General Partner shall use all reasonable efforts to cause to be filed such other certificates or documents as may be determined by the General Partner in its sole discretion to be reasonable and necessary or appropriate for the formation, continuation, qualification and operation of a limited partnership (or a partnership in which the limited partners have limited liability) in the State of Delaware or any other state in which the Partnership may elect to do business or own property. To the extent that such action is determined by the General Partner in its sole discretion to be reasonable and necessary or appropriate, the General Partner shall file amendments to and restatements of the Certificate of Limited Partnership and do all things necessary to maintain the Partnership as a limited partnership (or a partnership or other entity in which the limited partners have limited liability) under the laws of the State of Delaware or of any other state in which the Partnership may elect to do business or own property. Subject to the terms of Section 3.4(a), the General Partner shall not be required, before or after filing, to deliver or mail a copy of the Certificate of Limited Partnership, any qualification document or any amendment thereto to any Limited Partner. 

  

 Section 7.4 _ Restrictions on the General Partner\'s Authority._ 

  

 (a) The General Partner may not, without written approval of the specific act by holders of all of the Outstanding Limited Partner Interests or by other written instrument executed and delivered by holders of all of the Outstanding Limited Partner Interests subsequent to the date of this Agreement, take any action in contravention of this Agreement, including, except as otherwise provided in this Agreement, (i) committing any act that would make it impossible to carry on the ordinary business of the Partnership; (ii) possessing Partnership property, or assigning any rights in specific Partnership property, for other than a Partnership purpose; (iii) admitting a Person as a Partner; or (iv) amending this Agreement in any manner. 

        
  

 (b) Except as provided in Articles XII and XIV, the General Partner may not sell, exchange or otherwise dispose of all or substantially all of the Partnership\'s assets in a single transaction or a series of related transactions (including by way of merger, consolidation or other combination) or approve on behalf of the Partnership the sale, exchange or other disposition of all or substantially all of the assets of the Operating Company and its subsidiaries taken as a whole without the approval of holders of a majority of the Outstanding Voting Units; _provided, however,_  that this provision shall not preclude or limit the General Partner\'s ability to mortgage, pledge, hypothecate or grant a security interest in all or substantially all of the assets of the Partnership or the Operating Company and shall not apply to any forced sale of any or all of the assets of the Partnership or the Operating Company pursuant to the foreclosure of, or other realization upon, any such encumbrance. Without the approval of holders of a majority of the Outstanding Voting Units, the General Partner shall not, on behalf of the Partnership, consent to any amendment to the Operating Company Agreement or take any action permitted to be taken by a member of the Operating Company, in either case, that would adversely affect the Limited Partners (including any particular class of Partnership Interests as compared to any other class of Partnership Interests) in any material respect. 

  

 Section 7.5 _ Reimbursement of the General Partner._ 

  

 (a) Except as provided in this Section 7.5 and elsewhere in this Agreement, the General Partner shall not be compensated for its services as a general partner or managing member of any Group Member. 

  

 (b) The General Partner shall be reimbursed on a monthly basis, or such other reasonable basis as the General Partner may determine in its sole discretion, for (i) all direct and indirect expenses it incurs or payments it makes on behalf of the Partnership (including salary, bonus, incentive compensation and other amounts paid to any Person including Affiliates of the General Partner to perform services for the Partnership or for the General Partner in the discharge of its duties to the Partnership), and (ii) all other necessary or appropriate expenses allocable to the Partnership or otherwise reasonably incurred by the General Partner in connection with operating the Partnership\'s business (including expenses allocated to the General Partner by its Affiliates). The General Partner shall determine the expenses that are allocable to the Partnership in any reasonable manner determined by the General Partner in its sole discretion. Reimbursements pursuant to this Section 7.5 shall be in addition to any reimbursement to the General Partner as a result of indemnification pursuant to Section 7.8. 

   

 (c) The General Partner, in its sole discretion and without the approval of the Limited Partners (who shall have no right to vote in respect thereof), may propose and adopt on behalf of the Partnership employee benefit plans, employee programs and employee practices (including plans, programs and practices involving the issuance of Partnership Securities or options to purchase or rights, warrants or appreciation rights relating to Partnership Securities), or cause the Partnership to issue Partnership Securities in connection with, or pursuant to, any employee benefit plan, employee program or employee practice maintained or sponsored by the General Partner or any of its Affiliates, in each case for the benefit of employees of the General Partner, any Group Member or any Affiliate, or any of them, in respect of services performed, directly or indirectly, for the benefit of the Partnership Group. The Partnership agrees to issue to the employees any Partnership Securities that the General Partner is obligated to provide to such employees pursuant to any such employee benefit plans, employee programs or employee practices. Expenses incurred by the General Partner in connection with any such plans, programs and practices (including the net cost to the General Partner or such Affiliates of Partnership Securities purchased by the General Partner or such Affiliates from the Partnership to fulfill options or awards under such plans, programs and practices) shall be reimbursed in accordance with Section 7.5(b). Any and all obligations of the General Partner under any employee benefit plans, employee programs or employee practices adopted by the General Partner as permitted by this Section 7.5(c) shall constitute obligations of the General Partner hereunder. 

       

  Section 7.6 _ Outside Activities._ 

  

 (a) The General Partner (i) agrees that its sole business will be to act as a general partner or managing member, as the case may be, of the Partnership and any other partnership or limited liability company of which the Partnership or the Operating Company is, directly or indirectly, a partner or member and to undertake activities that are ancillary or related thereto (including being a limited partner in the Partnership), and (ii) shall not engage in any business or activity or incur any debts or liabilities except in connection with or incidental to (A) its performance as general partner or managing member of one or more Group Members, or (B) the acquiring, owning or disposing of debt or equity securities in any Group Member. 

  

 (b) The General Partner may acquire only the Partnership Interests. 

  

 (c) Anything in this Agreement to the contrary notwithstanding, to the extent that provisions of Section 7.8, 7.9, 7.10 or other Sections of this Agreement purport or are interpreted to have the effect of restricting the fiduciary duties that might otherwise, as a result of Delaware or other applicable law, be owed by the General Partner to the Partnership and its Limited Partners, or to constitute a waiver or consent by the Limited Partners to any such restriction, such provisions shall be inapplicable and have no effect in determining whether the General Partner has complied with its fiduciary duties in connection with determinations made by it under this Section 7.6. 

  

 Section 7.7 _ Loans from the General Partner; Loans or Contributions from the Partnership; Contracts with Affiliates; Certain Restrictions on the General Partner._ 

  

 (a) The General Partner or any of its Affiliates may lend to any Group Member, and any Group Member may borrow from the General Partner or any of its Affiliates, funds needed or desired by the Group Member for such periods of time and in such amounts as the General Partner may determine; _provided, however_ , that in any such case the lending party may not charge the borrowing party interest at a rate greater than the rate that would be charged the borrowing party or impose terms less favorable to the borrowing party than would be charged or imposed on the borrowing party by unrelated lenders on comparable loans made on an arm\'s-length basis (without reference to the lending party\'s financial abilities or guarantees). The borrowing party shall reimburse the lending party for any costs (other than any additional interest costs) incurred by the lending party in connection with the borrowing of such funds. For purposes of this Section 7.7(a) and Section 7.7(b), the term "Group Member" shall include any Affiliate of a Group Member that is controlled by the Group Member. No Group Member may lend funds to the General Partner or any of its Affiliates (other than another Group Member). 

  

 (b) The Partnership may lend or contribute to any Group Member, and any Group Member may borrow from the Partnership, funds on terms and conditions established in the sole discretion of the General Partner; _provided, however_ , that the Partnership may not charge the Group Member interest at a rate less than the rate that would be charged to the Group Member (without reference to the General Partner\'s financial abilities or guarantees) by unrelated lenders on comparable loans. The foregoing authority shall be exercised by the General Partner in its sole discretion and shall not create any right or benefit in favor of any Group Member or any other Person. 

  

 (c) The General Partner may itself, or may enter into an agreement with any of its Affiliates to, render services to a Group Member or to the General Partner in the discharge of its duties as General Partner of the Partnership. Any services rendered to a Group Member by the General Partner or any of its Affiliates shall be on terms that are fair and reasonable to the Partnership; _provided, however_ , that the requirements of this Section 7.7(c) shall be deemed satisfied as to (i) any transaction approved by the Board of Directors, (ii) any transaction, the terms of which are no less favorable to the Partnership Group than those generally being provided to or available from unrelated third parties or (iii) any transaction that, taking into account the totality of the relationships between the parties involved 

        
  

(including other transactions that may be particularly favorable or
advantageous to the Partnership Group), is equitable to the Partnership Group.
The provisions of Section 7.5 shall apply to the rendering of services
described in this Section 7.7(c).

   

 (d) The Partnership Group may transfer assets to joint ventures, other partnerships, corporations, limited liability companies or other business entities in which it is or thereby becomes a participant upon such terms and subject to such conditions as are consistent with this Agreement and applicable law. 

  

 (e) Neither the General Partner nor any of its Affiliates shall sell, transfer or convey any property to, or purchase any property from, the Partnership, directly or indirectly, except pursuant to transactions that are fair and reasonable to the Partnership; _provided, however_ , that the requirements of this Section 7.7(e) shall be deemed to be satisfied as to (i) any transaction approved by the Board of Directors, (ii) any transaction, the terms of which are no less favorable to the Partnership than those generally being provided to or available from unrelated third parties, or (iii) any transaction that, taking into account the totality of the relationships between the parties involved (including other transactions that may be particularly favorable or advantageous to the Partnership), is equitable to the Partnership. With respect to any contribution of assets to the Partnership in exchange for Partnership Securities, the Board of Directors, in determining whether the appropriate number of Partnership Securities are being issued, may take into account, among other things, the fair market value of the assets, the liquidated and contingent liabilities assumed, the tax basis in the assets, the extent to which tax-only allocations to the transferor will protect the existing partners of the Partnership against a low tax basis, and such other factors as the Board of Directors deems relevant under the circumstances. 

  

 (f) The General Partner and its Affiliates will have no obligation to permit any Group Member to use any facilities or assets of the General Partner and its Affiliates, except as may be provided in contracts entered into from time to time specifically dealing with such use, nor shall there be any obligation on the part of the General Partner or its Affiliates to enter into such contracts. 

  

 Section 7.8 _ Indemnification._ 

   

 (a) To the fullest extent permitted by law but subject to the limitations expressly provided in this Agreement, all Indemnitees shall be indemnified and held harmless by the Partnership from and against any and all losses, claims, damages, liabilities, joint or several, expenses (including legal fees and expenses), judgments, fines, penalties, interest, settlements or other amounts arising from any and all claims, demands, actions, suits or proceedings, whether civil, criminal, administrative or investigative, in which any Indemnitee may be involved, or is threatened to be involved, as a party or otherwise, by reason of its status as an Indemnitee; _provided, however,_ that the Indemnitee shall not be indemnified and held harmless if there has been a final and non-appealable judgment entered by a court of competent jurisdiction determining that, in respect of the matter for which the Indemnitee is seeking indemnification pursuant to this Section 7.8, the Indemnitee acted in bad faith or engaged in fraud, willful misconduct or, in the case of a criminal matter, acted with knowledge that the Indemnitee\'s conduct was unlawful; _provided, further,_ no indemnification pursuant to this Section 7.8 shall be available to the General Partner or its Affiliates (other than a Group Member) with respect to its or their obligations incurred pursuant to the Contribution Agreement (other than obligations incurred by the General Partner on behalf of the Partnership). Any indemnification pursuant to this Section 7.8 shall be made only out of the assets of the Partnership, it being agreed that the General Partner shall not be personally liable for such indemnification and shall have no obligation to contribute or loan any monies or property to the Partnership to enable it to effectuate such indemnification. 

  

 (b) To the fullest extent permitted by law, expenses (including legal fees and expenses) incurred by an Indemnitee who is indemnified pursuant to Section 7.8(a) in defending any claim, demand, action, suit or proceeding shall, from time to time, be advanced by the Partnership prior to a determination that the Indemnitee is not entitled to be indemnified upon receipt by the Partnership of 

        
  

an agreement by or on behalf of the Indemnitee to repay such amount if it
shall be determined that the Indemnitee is not entitled to be indemnified as
authorized in this Section 7.8.

  

 (c) The indemnification provided by this Section 7.8 shall be in addition to any other rights to which an Indemnitee may be entitled under any agreement, pursuant to any vote of the holders of Outstanding Limited Partner Interests, as a matter of law or otherwise, both as to actions in the Indemnitee\'s capacity as an Indemnitee and as to actions in any other capacity, and shall continue as to an Indemnitee who has ceased to serve in such capacity and shall inure to the benefit of the heirs, successors, assigns and administrators of the Indemnitee. 

   

 (d) The Partnership may purchase and maintain (or reimburse the General Partner or its Affiliates for the cost of) insurance, on behalf of the General Partner, its Affiliates and such other Persons as the General Partner shall determine, against any liability that may be asserted against or expense that may be incurred by such Person in connection with the Partnership\'s activities or such Person\'s activities on behalf of the Partnership, regardless of whether the Partnership would have the power to indemnify such Person against such liability under the provisions of this Agreement. 

  

 (e) For purposes of this Section 7.8, the Partnership shall be deemed to have requested an Indemnitee to serve as fiduciary of an employee benefit plan whenever the performance by it of its duties to the Partnership also imposes duties on, or otherwise involves services by, it to the plan or participants or beneficiaries of the plan; excise taxes assessed on an Indemnitee with respect to an employee benefit plan pursuant to applicable law shall constitute "fines" within the meaning of Section 7.8(a); and action taken or omitted by it with respect to any employee benefit plan in the performance of its duties for a purpose reasonably believed by it to be in the best interest of the participants and beneficiaries of the plan shall be deemed to be for a purpose that is in the best interests of the Partnership. 

  

 (f) In no event may an Indemnitee subject the Limited Partners to personal liability by reason of the indemnification provisions set forth in this Agreement. 

   

 (g) An Indemnitee shall not be denied indemnification in whole or in part under this Section 7.8 because the Indemnitee had an interest in the transaction with respect to which the indemnification applies if the transaction was otherwise permitted by the terms of this Agreement or any predecessor agreement thereto, including a transaction involving the General Partner, any Affiliate thereof and/or any member, partner, officer, director, employee, agent or trustee of any Group Member, the General Partner or any Affiliate of any Group Member. 

  

 (h) The provisions of this Section 7.8 are for the benefit of the Indemnitees, their heirs, successors, assigns and administrators and shall not be deemed to create any rights for the benefit of any other Persons. 

  

 (i) No amendment, modification or repeal of this Section 7.8 or any provision hereof shall in any manner terminate, reduce or impair the right of any past, present or future Indemnitee to be indemnified by the Partnership, nor the obligations of the Partnership to indemnify any such Indemnitee under and in accordance with the provisions of this Section 7.8 as in effect immediately prior to such amendment, modification or repeal with respect to claims arising from or relating to matters occurring, in whole or in part, prior to such amendment, modification or repeal, regardless of when such claims may arise or be asserted. 

  

 Section 7.9 _ Liability of Indemnitees._ 

  

 (a) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary set forth in this Agreement, no Indemnitee shall be liable for monetary damages to the Partnership, the Limited Partners, the Assignees or any other Persons who have acquired interests in the Partnership Securities, for losses sustained or liabilities incurred as a result of any act or omission if such Indemnitee acted in good faith. 

        
  

 (b) Subject to its obligations and duties as General Partner set forth in Section 7.2(a), the General Partner may exercise any of the powers granted to it by this Agreement and perform any of the duties imposed upon it hereunder either directly or by or through its agents, and the General Partner shall not be responsible for any misconduct or negligence on the part of any such agent appointed by the General Partner in good faith. 

   

 (c) To the extent that, at law or in equity, an Indemnitee has duties (including fiduciary duties) and liabilities relating thereto to the Partnership or to the Partners, the General Partner and any other Indemnitee acting in connection with the Partnership\'s business or affairs shall not be liable to the Partnership or to any Partner for its good faith reliance on the provisions of this Agreement. The provisions of this Agreement, to the extent that they restrict or otherwise modify the duties and liabilities of an Indemnitee otherwise existing at law or in equity, are agreed by the Partners to replace such other duties and liabilities of such Indemnitee. 

   

 (d) Any amendment, modification or repeal of this Section 7.9 or any provision hereof shall be prospective only and shall not in any way affect the limitations on the liability to the Partnership, the Limited Partners, the General Partner, and the Partnership\'s and General Partner\'s directors, officers and employees under this Section 7.9 as in effect immediately prior to such amendment, modification or repeal with respect to claims arising from or relating to matters occurring, in whole or in part, prior to such amendment, modification or repeal, regardless of when such claims may arise or be asserted. 

  

 Section 7.10 _ Other Matters Concerning the General Partner._ 

   

 (a) The General Partner may rely and shall be protected in acting or refraining from acting upon any resolution, certificate, statement, instrument, opinion, report, notice, request, consent, order, bond, debenture or other paper or document believed by it to be genuine and to have been signed or presented by the proper party or parties. 

  

 (b) The General Partner may consult with legal counsel, accountants, appraisers, management consultants, investment bankers and other consultants and advisers selected by it, and any act taken or omitted to be taken in reliance upon the opinion (including an Opinion of Counsel) of such Persons as to matters that the General Partner reasonably believes to be within such Person\'s professional or expert competence shall be conclusively presumed to have been done or omitted in good faith and in accordance with such opinion. 

  

 (c) The General Partner shall have the right, in respect of any of its powers or obligations hereunder, to act through any of its duly authorized officers, a duly appointed attorney or attorneys-in-fact or the duly authorized officers of the Partnership. 

  

 (d) Any standard of care and duty imposed by this Agreement or under the Delaware Act or any applicable law, rule or regulation shall be modified, waived or limited, to the extent permitted by law, as required to permit the General Partner to act under this Agreement or any other agreement contemplated by this Agreement and to make any decision pursuant to the authority prescribed in this Agreement, so long as such action is reasonably believed by the General Partner to be in, or not inconsistent with, the best interests of the Partnership. 

  

 Section 7.11 _ Purchase or Sale of Partnership Securities._ The General Partner may cause the Partnership to purchase or otherwise acquire Partnership Securities. As long as Partnership Securities are held by any Group Member, such Partnership Securities shall not be considered Outstanding for any purpose, except as otherwise provided herein. The General Partner or any Affiliate of the General Partner may also purchase or otherwise acquire and sell or otherwise dispose of Partnership Securities for its own account, subject to the provisions of Articles IV and X. 

   

 Section 7.12 _ Reliance by Third Parties._ Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement, any Person dealing with the Partnership shall be entitled to assume that the General 

        
  

Partner and any officer of the General Partner authorized by the General
Partner to act on behalf of and in the name of the Partnership has full power
and authority to encumber, sell or otherwise use in any manner any and all
assets of the Partnership and to enter into any authorized contracts on behalf
of the Partnership, and such Person shall be entitled to deal with the General
Partner or any such officer as if it were the Partnership\'s sole party in
interest, both legally and beneficially. Each Limited Partner hereby waives
any and all defenses or other remedies that may be available against such
Person to contest, negate or disaffirm any action of the General Partner or
any such officer in connection with any such dealing. In no event shall any
Person dealing with the General Partner or any such officer or its
representatives be obligated to ascertain that the terms of the Agreement have
been complied with or to inquire into the necessity or expedience of any act
or action of the General Partner or any such officer or its representatives.
Each and every certificate, document or other instrument executed on behalf of
the Partnership by the General Partner or its representatives shall be
conclusive evidence in favor of any and every Person relying thereon or
claiming thereunder that (a) at the time of the execution and delivery of such
certificate, document or instrument, this Agreement was in full force and
effect, (b) the Person executing and delivering such certificate, document or
instrument was duly authorized and empowered to do so for and on behalf of
the Partnership and (c) such certificate, document or instrument was duly
executed and delivered in accordance with the terms and provisions of this
Agreement and is binding upon the Partnership.

 (a) The Partnership shall make the election under Section 754 of the Code in accordance with applicable regulations thereunder, subject to the reservation of the right to seek to revoke any such election upon the General Partner\'s determination that such revocation is in the best interests of the Limited Partners. Notwithstanding any other provision herein contained, for the purposes of computing the adjustments under Section 743(b) of the Code, the General Partner shall be authorized (but not required) to adopt a convention whereby the price paid by a transferee of a Limited Partner Interest will be deemed to be the lowest quoted closing price of the Limited Partner Interests on any National Securities Exchange on which such Limited Partner Interests are traded during the calendar month in which such transfer is deemed to occur pursuant to Section 6.2(g) without regard to the actual price paid by such transferee.

 ADMISSION OF PARTNERS

  

 Section 10.1 _ Admission of Substituted Limited Partner._ By transfer of a Limited Partner Interest in accordance with Article IV, the transferor shall be deemed to have given the transferee the right to seek admission as a Substituted Limited Partner subject to the conditions of, and in the manner permitted under, this Agreement.

Such Assignee shall become a Substituted Limited Partner (x) at such time as the General Partner consents thereto, which consent may be given or withheld in the General Partner\'s discretion, and (y) when any such admission is shown on the books and records of the Partnership. If such consent is withheld, such transferee shall be an Assignee. An Assignee shall have an interest in the Partnership equivalent to that of a Limited Partner with respect to allocations and distributions, including liquidating distributions, of the Partnership. With respect to voting rights attributable to Limited Partner Interests that are held by Assignees, the General Partner shall be deemed to be the Limited Partner with respect thereto and shall, in exercising the voting rights in respect of such Limited Partner Interests on any matter, vote such Limited Partner Interests at the written direction of the Assignee who is the Record Holder of such Limited Partner Interests. If no such written direction is received, such Limited Partner Interests will not be voted. An Assignee shall have no other rights of a Limited Partner. 

  

 Section 10.2 _ Admission of Additional Limited Partners._ 

   

 (a) A Person (other than the General Partner or a Limited Partner) who makes a Capital Contribution to the Partnership in accordance with this Agreement shall be admitted to the Partnership as an Additional Limited Partner only upon furnishing to the General Partner

 (ii) such other documents or instruments as may be required in the discretion of the General Partner to effect such Person\'s admission as an Additional Limited Partner.

 Section 10.3 _ Amendment of Agreement and Certificate of Limited Partnership._ To effect the admission to the Partnership of any Partner, the General Partner shall take all steps necessary and appropriate under the Delaware Act to amend the records of the Partnership to reflect such admission and, if necessary, to prepare as soon as practicable an amendment to this Agreement and, if required by law, the General Partner shall prepare and file an amendment to the Certificate of Limited Partnership, and the General Partner may for this purpose, among others, exercise the power of attorney granted pursuant to Section 2.6.

 (iv) The Person so elected as successor General Partner shall automatically become the successor general partner or managing member, to the extent applicable, of the other Group Members of which the General Partner is a general partner or a managing member. 

  

 (v) Upon the withdrawal of the General Partner, if a successor General Partner is elected pursuant to Section 11.1(b)(ii), the Partnership shall not be dissolved and such successor General Partner shall continue the business of the Partnership. 

  

  

 Section 11.2 _ Withdrawal of Limited Partners._ No Limited Partner shall have any right to withdraw from the Partnership; _provided, however_ , that when a transferee of a Limited Partner\'s Limited Partner Interest becomes a Record Holder of the Limited Partner Interest so transferred, such transferring Limited Partner shall cease to be a Limited Partner with respect to the Limited Partner Interest so transferred.

The Liquidator (if other than the General Partner) shall agree not to resign at any time without 15 days\' prior notice and may be removed at any time, with or without cause, by notice of removal approved by holders of at least a majority of the Outstanding Common Units. Upon dissolution, removal or resignation of the Liquidator, a successor and substitute Liquidator (who shall have and succeed to all rights, powers and duties of the original Liquidator) shall within 30 days thereafter be approved by holders of at least a majority of the Outstanding Common Units. The right to approve a successor or substitute Liquidator in the manner provided herein shall be deemed to refer also to any such successor or substitute Liquidator approved in the manner herein provided.

 Section 12.3 _ Liquidation._ The Liquidator shall proceed to dispose of the assets of the Partnership, discharge its liabilities, and otherwise wind up its affairs in such manner and over such period as the Liquidator determines to be in the best interest of the Partners, subject to Section 17-804 of the Delaware Act and the following: 

  

 (a) The assets may be disposed of by public or private sale or by distribution in kind to one or more Partners on such terms as the Liquidator and such Partner or Partners may agree. If any property is distributed in kind, the Partner receiving the property shall be deemed for purposes of Section 12.3(c) to have received cash equal to its fair market value; and contemporaneously therewith, appropriate cash distributions must be made to the other Partners. The Liquidator may, in its absolute discretion, defer liquidation or distribution of the Partnership\'s assets for a reasonable time if it determines that an immediate sale or distribution of all or some of the Partnership\'s assets would be impractical or would cause undue loss to the Partners. The Liquidator may, in its absolute discretion, distribute the Partnership\'s assets, in whole or in part, in kind if it determines that a sale would be impractical or would cause undue loss to the Partners. 

  

 (b) Liabilities of the Partnership include amounts owed to the Liquidator as compensation for serving in such capacity (subject to the terms of Section 12.2) and amounts to Partners otherwise than in respect of their distribution rights under Article VI. With respect to any liability that is contingent, conditional or unmatured or is otherwise not yet due and payable, the Liquidator shall either settle such claim for such amount as it thinks appropriate or establish a reserve of cash or other assets to provide for its payment. When paid, any unused portion of the reserve shall be distributed as additional liquidation proceeds. 

  

 (c) All property and all cash in excess of that required to discharge liabilities as provided in Section 12.3(b) shall be distributed to the Partners in accordance with, and to the extent of, the positive balances in their respective Capital Accounts, as determined after taking into account all Capital Account adjustments (other than those made by reason of distributions pursuant to this Section 12.3(c)) for the taxable year of the Partnership during which the liquidation of the Partnership occurs (with such date of occurrence being determined pursuant to Treasury Regulation Section 1.704-1(b)(2)(ii)(g)), and such distribution shall be made by the end of such taxable year (or, if later, within 90 days after said date of such occurrence). 

       

  Section 12.4 _ Cancellation of Certificate of Limited
Partnership._ Upon the completion of the distribution of Partnership cash
and property as provided in Section 12.3 in connection with the liquidation of
the Partnership, the Partnership shall be terminated and the Certificate of
Limited Partnership and all qualifications of the Partnership as a foreign
limited partnership in jurisdictions other than the State of Delaware shall be
canceled and such other actions as may be necessary to terminate the
Partnership shall be taken.

  

 Section 12.5 _ Return of Contributions._ The General Partner shall not be personally liable for, and shall have no obligation to contribute or loan any monies or property to the Partnership to enable it to effectuate, the return of the Capital Contributions of the Limited Partners or Unitholders, or any portion thereof, it being expressly understood that any such return shall be made solely from Partnership assets. 

   

 Section 12.6 _ Waiver of Partition._ To the maximum extent permitted by law, each Partner hereby waives any right to partition of the Partnership property. 

  

 Section 12.7 _ Capital Account Restoration._ No Limited Partner shall have any obligation to restore any negative balance in its Capital Account upon liquidation of the Partnership. The General Partner shall be obligated to restore any negative balance in its Capital Account upon liquidation of its interest in the Partnership by the end of the taxable year of the Partnership during which such liquidation occurs, or, if later, within 90 days after the date of such liquidation.

 (a) a change in the name of the Partnership, the location of the principal place of business of the Partnership, the registered agent of the Partnership or the registered office of the Partnership; 

  

 (b) admission, substitution, withdrawal or removal of Partners, as applicable, in accordance with this Agreement;

 (d) a change that, in the discretion of the General Partner, (i) does not adversely affect the Limited Partners (including any particular class of Partnership Interests as compared to other classes of Partnership Interests) in any material respect, (ii) is necessary or advisable to (A) satisfy any requirements, conditions or guidelines contained in any opinion, directive, order, ruling or regulation of any federal or state agency or judicial authority or contained in any federal or state statute (including the Delaware Act) or (B) facilitate the trading of the Units (including the division of any class or classes of Outstanding Voting Units into different classes to facilitate uniformity of tax consequences within such classes of Units) or comply with any rule, regulation, guideline or requirement of any National Securities Exchange on which the Units are or will be listed for trading, compliance with any of which the General Partner determines in its discretion to be in the best interests of the Partnership and the Limited Partners, (iii) is necessary or advisable in connection with action taken by the General 

        
  

Partner pursuant to Section 5.5 or (iv) is required to effect the intent of

 (g) an amendment that, in the discretion of the General Partner, is necessary or advisable in connection with the authorization of issuance of any class or series of Partnership Securities pursuant to Section 5.4; 

  

 (h) any amendment expressly permitted in this Agreement to be made by the General Partner acting alone; 

  

 (i) an amendment effected, necessitated or contemplated by a Merger Agreement approved in accordance with Section 14.3; 

   

 (j) an amendment that, in the discretion of the General Partner, is necessary or advisable to reflect, account for and deal with appropriately the formation by the Partnership of, or investment by the Partnership in, any corporation, partnership, joint venture, limited liability company or other entity, in connection with the conduct by the Partnership of activities permitted by the terms of Section 2.4; 

  

 (k) a merger or conveyance pursuant to Section 14.3(d); or

 Section 13.2 _ Amendment Procedures._ Except as provided in Sections 13.1 and 13.3, all amendments to this Agreement shall be made in accordance with the following requirements. Amendments to this Agreement may be proposed only by or with the consent of the General Partner which consent may be given or withheld in its sole discretion. A proposed amendment shall be effective upon its approval by the majority of the Outstanding Voting Units unless a greater or different percentage is required under this Agreement or by Delaware law. Each proposed amendment that requires the approval of the holders of a specified percentage of Outstanding Voting Units shall be set forth in a writing that contains the text of the proposed amendment. If such a Voting amendment is proposed, the General Partner shall seek the written approval of the requisite percentage of Outstanding Voting Units or call a meeting of the Unitholders to consider and vote on such proposed amendment. The General Partner shall notify all Record Holders upon final adoption of any such proposed amendments. 

  

 Section 13.3 _ Amendment Requirements._ 

  

 (a) Notwithstanding the provisions of Sections 13.1 and 13.2, no provision of this Agreement that establishes a percentage of Outstanding Voting Units (including Units deemed owned by the General Partner) required to take any action shall be amended, altered, changed, repealed or rescinded in any respect that would have the effect of reducing such voting percentage unless such amendment is approved by the written consent or the affirmative vote of holders of Outstanding Voting Units whose aggregate Outstanding Voting Units constitute not less than the voting requirement sought to be reduced. 

        
  

 (b) Notwithstanding the provisions of Sections 13.1 and 13.2, no amendment to this Agreement may (i) enlarge the obligations of any Limited Partner without its consent, unless such shall be deemed to have occurred as a result of an amendment approved pursuant to Section 13.3(c), (ii) enlarge the obligations of, restrict in any way any action by or rights of, or reduce in any way the amounts distributable, reimbursable or otherwise payable to, the General Partner or any of its Affiliates without its consent, which consent may be given or withheld in its sole discretion, (iii) change Section 12.1(b), or (iv) change the term of the Partnership or, except as set forth in Section 12.1(b), give any Person the right to dissolve the Partnership. 

  

 (c) Except as provided in Section 14.3, and without limitation of the General Partner\'s authority to adopt amendments to this Agreement without the approval of any Partners or Assignees as contemplated in Section 13.1, any amendment that would have a material adverse effect on the rights or preferences of any class of Partnership Interests in relation to other classes of Partnership Interests must be approved by the holders of not less than a majority of the Outstanding Partnership Interests of the class affected. 

  

 (d) Notwithstanding any other provision of this Agreement, except for amendments pursuant to Section 13.1 and except as otherwise provided by Section 14.3(b), no amendments shall become effective without the approval of the holders of at least 90% of the Outstanding Voting Units voting as a single class unless the Partnership obtains an Opinion of Counsel to the effect that such amendment will not affect the limited liability of any Limited Partner under applicable law. 

   

 (e) Except as provided in Section 13.1, this Section 13.3 shall only be amended with the approval of the holders of at least 90% of the Outstanding Voting Units. 

  

 Section 13.4 _ Common Unitholder Meetings._ 

  

 (a) All acts of Limited Partners to be taken pursuant to this Agreement shall be taken in the manner provided in this Article XIII. 

  

 (b) Special meetings of the Limited Partners may be called by the General Partner or by Limited Partners owning 20% or more of the Outstanding Voting Units of the class or classes for which a meeting is proposed. Limited Partners shall call a special meeting by delivering to the General Partner (if there is a General Partner at such time) one or more requests in writing stating that the signing Limited Partners wish to call a special meeting and indicating the general or specific purposes (including the election of directors to the Board of Directors, as necessary), for which the special meeting is to be called. Within 60 days after receipt of such a call from Limited Partners or within such greater time as may be reasonably necessary for the Partnership to comply with any statutes, rules, regulations, listing agreements or similar requirements governing the holding of a meeting or the solicitation of proxies for use at such a meeting, the General Partner (or, if there is no General Partner at such time, Limited Partners owning at least 20% of the Outstanding Voting Units of the class or classes for which the meeting is proposed) shall send a notice of the meeting to the Limited Partners either directly or indirectly through the Transfer Agent. A special meeting shall be held at a time and place determined by the General Partner (or, if there is no General Partner at such time, Limited Partners owning at least 20% of the Outstanding Voting Units of the class or classes for which the meeting is proposed) on a date not less than 10 days nor more than 60 days after the mailing of notice of the meeting. Limited Partners shall not vote on matters that would cause the Limited Partners to be deemed to be taking part in the management and control of the business and affairs of the Partnership so as to jeopardize the Limited Partners\' limited liability under the Delaware Act or the law of any other state in which the Partnership is qualified to do business. 

  

 (c) (i) An annual meeting of the Limited Partners holding Voting Units for the election of directors to the Board of Directors and such other matters as the Board of Directors shall submit to a vote of the Limited Partners holding Voting Units shall be held in June of each year or at such other 

        
  

date and time as may be fixed from time to time by the General Partner (or,
if there is no General Partner at such time, Limited Partners owning at least
20% of the Outstanding Voting Units of the class or classes for which the
meeting is proposed) at such place within or without the State of Delaware as
may be fixed from time to time by the General Partner (or, if there is no
General Partner at such time, Limited Partners owning at least 20% of the
Outstanding Voting Units of the class or classes for which the meeting is
proposed) and all as stated in the notice of the meeting. Notice of the
annual meeting shall be given in accordance with Section 13.5 not less than 10
days nor more than 60 days prior to the date of such meeting.

  

  

 (ii) The Limited Partners holding Voting Units shall vote together as a single class. The Limited Partners entitled to vote shall elect by a plurality of the votes cast at such meeting persons to serve on the Board of Directors of the General Partner who are nominated in accordance with the provisions of this Section 13.4(c). The exercise by a Limited Partner of the right to elect the Directors and any other rights afforded to such Limited Partner under this Section 13.4(c) shall be in such Limited Partner\'s capacity as a limited partner of the Partnership and shall not cause a Limited Partner to be deemed to be taking part in the management and control of the business and affairs of the Partnership so as to jeopardize such Limited Partner\'s limited liability under the Delaware Act or the law of any other state in which the Partnership is qualified to do business. 

  

 (iii) Each Limited Partner holding Voting Units shall be entitled to one vote for each Outstanding Unit that is registered in the name of such Limited Partner on the Record Date for such meeting; _provided, however_ , that the General Partner, the Partnership and their Affiliates shall not be entitled to vote Units that are otherwise entitled to vote at any meeting of the Unitholders and any such Units that are not entitled to be voted pursuant to this provision shall not be deemed to be Outstanding for purposes of determining a quorum under Section 13.9. 

  

 (iv) The number of Directors that shall constitute the whole Board of Directors of the General Partner shall not be less than seven and not more than eleven as shall be established from time to time by a resolution adopted by a majority of the Directors; _provided, however_ , that no decrease shall shorten the term of any incumbent Director. Unless otherwise previously elected at a special meeting, at each annual meeting of the Limited Partners, Directors shall be elected to hold office until the next annual meeting. 

  

 (v) Each Director shall hold office for the term for which such Director is elected and thereafter until such Director\'s successor shall have been duly elected and qualified, or until such Director\'s earlier death, resignation or removal. Any vacancies may be filled, until the next annual meeting, by a majority of the remaining Directors then in office. A Director may be removed only for cause and only upon a vote of the majority of the remaining Directors then in office. 

   

 (vi) If the Commission promulgates a rule that provides for nominations by shareholders of publicly traded companies of persons for election to the board of directors, the Partnership and the General Partner shall adopt such rule as applied to a corporation without regard to any exemptions provided to limited partnerships. 

  

 (vii) This Section 13.4(c) shall not be deemed in any way to limit or impair the ability of the Board of Directors to adopt a "poison pill" or unitholder or other similar rights plan with respect to the Partnership, whether such poison pill or plan contains "dead hand" provisions, "no hand" provisions or other provisions relating to the redemption of the poison pill or plan, in each case as such terms are used under Delaware common law. 

  

 (viii) The General Partner shall use its commercially reasonable best efforts to take such action as shall be necessary or appropriate to give effect to and implement the provisions of this Section 13.4(c), including, without limitation, amending the limited liability company agreement of the General Partner. 

  

      

  
  

 (ix) This Article XIII may not be amended except upon the prior approval of Limited Partners that hold 80% of the Outstanding Voting Units. 

  

 (x) If the General Partner delegates to an existing or newly formed wholly-owned subsidiary the power and authority to manage and control the business and affairs of the Partnership Group, the foregoing provisions of this Section 13.4(c) shall be applicable with respect to the Board of Directors or other governing body of such Subsidiary. 

  

  

 Section 13.5 _ Notice of a Meeting._ Notice of a meeting called pursuant to Section 13.4 shall be given to the Record Holders of the class or classes of Units for which a meeting is proposed in writing by mail or other means of written communication in accordance with Section 15.1. The notice shall be deemed to have been given at the time when deposited in the mail or sent by other means of written communication. 

  

 Section 13.6 _ Record Date._ For purposes of determining the Limited Partners entitled to notice of or to vote at a meeting of the Limited Partners or to give approvals without a meeting as provided in Section 13.11 the General Partner (or, if there is no General Partner at such time, Limited Partners owning at least 20% of the Outstanding Voting Units of the class or classes for which the meeting is proposed or which would have the right to vote on such action, as applicable) may set a Record Date, which shall not be less than 10 nor more than 60 days before (a) the date of the meeting (unless such requirement conflicts with any rule, regulation, guideline or requirement of any National Securities Exchange on which the Limited Partner Interests are listed for trading, in which case the rule, regulation, guideline or requirement of such exchange shall govern) or (b) in the event that approvals are sought without a meeting, the date by which Limited Partners are requested in writing by the General Partner (or, if there is no General Partner at such time, Limited Partners owning at least 20% of the Outstanding Voting Units of the class or classes which would have the right to vote on such action) to give such approvals. 

  

 Section 13.7 _ Adjournment._ When a meeting is adjourned to another time or place, notice need not be given of the adjourned meeting and a new Record Date need not be fixed, if the time and place thereof are announced at the meeting at which the adjournment is taken, unless such adjournment shall be for more than 45 days. At the adjourned meeting, the Partnership may transact any business which might have been transacted at the original meeting. If the adjournment is for more than 45 days or if a new Record Date is fixed for the adjourned meeting, a notice of the adjourned meeting shall be given in accordance with this Article XIII. 

  

 Section 13.8 _ Waiver of Notice; Approval of Meeting; Approval of Minutes._ The transactions of any meeting of Limited Partners, however called and noticed, and whenever held, shall be as valid as if it had occurred at a meeting duly held after regular call and notice, if a quorum is present either in person or by proxy, and if, either before or after the meeting, Limited Partners representing such quorum who were present in person or by proxy and entitled to vote, sign a written waiver of notice or an approval of the holding of the meeting or an approval of the minutes thereof. All waivers and approvals shall be filed with the Partnership records or made a part of the minutes of the meeting. Attendance of a Limited Partner at a meeting shall constitute a waiver of notice of the meeting, except when the Limited Partner does not approve, at the beginning of the meeting, of the transaction of any business because the meeting is not lawfully called or convened; and except that attendance at a meeting is not a waiver of any right to disapprove the consideration of matters required to be included in the notice of the meeting, but not so included, if the disapproval is expressly made at the meeting. 

  

 Section 13.9 _ Quorum._ The holders of a majority of the Outstanding Voting Units of the class or classes for which a meeting has been called represented in person or by proxy shall constitute a quorum at a meeting of Limited Partners of such class or classes unless any such action by the Limited Partners requires approval by holders of a greater percentage of such Voting Units, in which case the quorum shall be such greater percentage. At any meeting of the Limited Partners duly called and held 

        
  

in accordance with this Agreement at which a quorum is present, the act of
Limited Partners holding Outstanding Voting Units that in the aggregate
represent a majority of the Outstanding Voting Units entitled to vote and be
present in person or by proxy at such meeting shall be deemed to constitute
the act of all Limited Partners, unless a greater or different percentage is
required with respect to such action under the provisions of this Agreement,
in which case the act of the Limited Partners holding Outstanding Voting Units
that in the aggregate represent at least such greater or different percentage
shall be required. The Limited Partners present at a duly called or held
meeting at which a quorum is present may continue to transact business until
adjournment, notwithstanding the withdrawal of enough Limited Partners to
leave less than a quorum, if any action taken (other than adjournment) is
approved by the required percentage of Outstanding Voting Units specified in
this Agreement. In the absence of a quorum any meeting of Limited Partners
may be adjourned from time to time by the affirmative vote of holders of at
least a majority of the Outstanding Voting Units entitled to vote at such
meeting represented either in person or by proxy, but no other business may be
transacted, except as provided in Section 13.7.

  

 Section 13.10 _ Conduct of a Meeting._ The General Partner (or, if there is no General Partner at such time, Limited Partners owning at least 20% of the Outstanding Voting Units of the class or classes for which the meeting is proposed) shall have full power and authority concerning the manner of conducting any meeting of the Limited Partners or solicitation of approvals in writing, including the determination of Persons entitled to vote, the existence of a quorum, the satisfaction of the requirements of Section 13.4, the conduct of voting, the validity and effect of any proxies and the determination of any controversies, votes or challenges arising in connection with or during the meeting or voting. The General Partner (or, if there is no General Partner at such time, Limited Partners owning at least 20% of the Outstanding Voting Units of the class or classes for which the meeting is proposed) shall designate a Person to serve as chairman of any meeting and shall further designate a Person to take the minutes of any meeting. All minutes shall be kept with the records of the Partnership maintained by the General Partner. The General Partner (or, if there is no General Partner at such time, Limited Partners owning at least 20% of the Outstanding Voting Units of the class or classes for which the meeting is proposed) may make such other regulations consistent with applicable law and this Agreement as it may deem advisable concerning the conduct of any meeting of the Limited Partners or solicitation of approvals in writing, including regulations in regard to the appointment of proxies, the appointment and duties of inspectors of votes and approvals, the submission and examination of proxies and other evidence of the right to vote, and the revocation of approvals in writing. 

  

 Section 13.11 _ Action Without a Meeting._ If authorized by the General Partner (or, if there is no General Partner at such time, Limited Partners owning at least 20% of the Outstanding Voting Units of the class or classes which would have the right to vote on such action), any action that may be taken at a meeting of the Limited Partners may be taken without a meeting if an approval in writing setting forth the action so taken is signed by Limited Partners owning not less than the minimum percentage of the Outstanding Voting Units that would be necessary to authorize or take such action at a meeting at which all the Limited Partners were present and voted (unless such provision conflicts with any rule, regulation, guideline or requirement of any National Securities Exchange on which the Voting Units are listed for trading, in which case the rule, regulation, guideline or requirement of such exchange shall govern). Prompt notice of the taking of action without a meeting shall be given to the Limited Partners who have not approved in writing. The General Partner (or, if there is no General Partner at such time, Limited Partners owning at least 20% of the Outstanding Voting Units of the class or classes which would have the right to vote on such action) may specify that any written ballot submitted to Limited Partners for the purpose of taking any action without a meeting shall be returned to the Partnership within the time period, which shall be not less than 20 days, specified by the General Partner (or, if there is no General Partner at such time, Limited Partners owning at least 20% of the Outstanding Voting Units of the class or classes which would have the right to vote on such action). If 

        

a ballot returned to the Partnership does not vote all of the Voting Units
held by the Limited Partners, the Partnership shall be deemed to have failed
to receive a ballot for the Voting Units that were not voted. If approval of
the taking of any action by the Limited Partners is solicited by any Person
other than by or on behalf of the General Partner (or, if there is no General
Partner at such time, Limited Partners owning at least 20% of the Outstanding
Voting Units of the class or classes which would have the right to vote on
such action), the written approvals shall have no force and effect unless and
until (a) they are deposited with the Partnership in care of the General
Partner, (b) approvals sufficient to take the action proposed are dated as of
a date not more than 90 days prior to the date sufficient approvals are
deposited with the Partnership and (c) an Opinion of Counsel is delivered to
the General Partner to the effect that the exercise of such right and the
action proposed to be taken with respect to any particular matter (i) will not
cause the Limited Partners to be deemed to be taking part in the management
and control of the business and affairs of the Partnership so as to
jeopardize the Limited Partners\' limited liability, and (ii) is otherwise
permissible under the state statutes then governing the rights, duties and
liabilities of the Partnership and the Partners.

  

 Section 13.12 _ Voting and Other Rights._ 

  

 (a) Only those Record Holders of the Voting Units on the Record Date set pursuant to Section 13.6 (and also subject to the limitations contained in the definition of " _Outstanding_ ") shall be entitled to notice of, and to vote at, a meeting of Limited Partners or to act with respect to matters as to which the holders of the Outstanding Voting Units have the right to vote or to act. All references in this Agreement to votes of, or other acts that may be taken by, the Outstanding Voting Units shall be deemed to be references to the votes or acts of the Record Holders of such Outstanding Voting Units. 

  

 (b) With respect to Voting Units that are held for a Person\'s account by another Person (such as a broker, dealer, bank, trust company or clearing corporation, or an agent of any of the foregoing), in whose name such Voting Units are registered, such other Person shall, in exercising the voting rights in respect of such Voting Units on any matter, and unless the arrangement between such Persons provides otherwise, vote such Voting Units in favor of, and at the direction of, the Person who is the beneficial owner, and the Partnership shall be entitled to assume it is so acting without further inquiry. The provisions of this Section 13.12(b) (as well as all other provisions of this Agreement) are subject to the provisions of Section 4.3.

 (f) the effective time of the merger, which may be the date of the filing of the certificate of merger pursuant to Section 14.4 or a later date specified in or determinable in accordance with the Merger Agreement ( _provided, however_ , that if the effective time of the merger is to be later than the date of the filing of the certificate of merger, the effective time shall be fixed no later than the time of the filing of the certificate of merger and stated therein); and 

  

 (g) such other provisions with respect to the proposed merger or consolidation as are deemed necessary or appropriate by the General Partner. 

  

 Section 14.3 _ Approval by Limited Partners of Merger or Consolidation._

A copy or a summary of the Merger Agreement shall be included in or enclosed with the notice of a special meeting or the written consent. 

  

 (b) Except as provided in Section 14.3(d), the Merger Agreement shall be approved upon receiving the affirmative vote or consent of the holders of a majority of the Outstanding Voting Units unless the Merger Agreement contains any provision that, if contained in an amendment to this Agreement, the provisions of this Agreement or the Delaware Act would require for its approval the vote or consent of a greater percentage of the Outstanding Voting Units or of any class of Limited Partners, in which case such greater percentage vote or consent shall be required for approval of the Merger Agreement. 

  

 (c) Except as provided in Section 14.3(d), after such approval by vote or consent of the Limited Partners, and at any time prior to the filing of the certificate of merger pursuant to Section 14.4, the merger or consolidation may be abandoned pursuant to provisions therefor, if any, set forth in the Merger Agreement. 

  

 (d) Notwithstanding anything else contained in this Article XIV or in this Agreement, the General Partner is permitted, in its discretion, without Limited Partner approval, to merge the Partnership or any Group Member into, or convey all of the Partnership\'s assets to, another limited liability entity which shall be newly formed and shall have no assets, liabilities or operations at the time of such Merger other than those it receives from the Partnership or other Group Member if (i) the General Partner has received an Opinion of Counsel that the merger or conveyance, as the case may be, would 

        
  

not result in the loss of the limited liability of any Limited Partner or any
Group Member or cause the Partnership or any Group Member to be treated as an
association taxable as a corporation or otherwise to be taxed as an entity
for federal income tax purposes (to the extent not previously treated as
such), (ii) the sole purpose of such merger or conveyance is to effect a mere
change in the legal form of the Partnership into another limited liability
entity and (iii) the governing instruments of the new entity provide the
Limited Partners and the General Partner with the same rights and obligations
as are herein contained.

  

 Section 14.4 _ Certificate of Merger._ Upon the required approval by the General Partner and the Unitholders of a Merger Agreement, a certificate of merger shall be executed and filed with the Secretary of State of the State of Delaware in conformity with the requirements of the Delaware Act.

ARTICLE II 
 STOCKHOLDERS

  

 Section 2.1 _ Place of Meetings._ All meetings of the stockholders shall be held at the principal office of the Corporation, or at such other place within or without the State of Delaware as shall be specified or fixed in the notices or waivers of notice thereof. 

   

 Section 2.2 _ Quorum; Adjournment of Meetings._ Unless otherwise required by law or provided in the Certificate of Incorporation or these bylaws, the holders of a majority of the stock issued and outstanding and entitled to vote thereat, present in person or represented by proxy, shall constitute a quorum at any meeting of stockholders for the transaction of business and the act of a majority of such stock so represented at any meeting of stockholders at which a quorum is present shall constitute the act of the meeting of stockholders. The stockholders present at a duly organized meeting may continue to transact business until adjournment, notwithstanding the withdrawal of enough stockholders to leave less than a quorum. 

  

 Notwithstanding the other provisions of the Certificate of Incorporation or these bylaws, the chairman of the meeting or the holders of a majority of the issued and outstanding stock present in person or represented by proxy at any meeting of stockholders, whether or not a quorum is present, shall have the power to adjourn such meeting from time to time, without any notice other than announcement at the meeting of the time and place of the holding of the adjourned meeting; _provided_ , _however_ , if the adjournment is for more than thirty (30) days, or if after the adjournment a new record date is fixed for the adjourned meeting, a notice of the adjourned meeting shall be given to each stockholder of record entitled to vote at such meeting. At any such adjourned meeting at which a quorum shall be present or represented any business may be transacted that might have been transacted at the meeting as originally called. 

  

 Section 2.3 _ Annual Meetings._ An annual meeting of the stockholders, for the election of directors to succeed those whose terms expire and for the transaction of such other business as may properly come before the meeting, shall be held at such place, within or without the State of Delaware, on such date, and at such time as the Board of Directors shall fix and set forth in the notice of the 

        
  

meeting, which date shall be within thirteen (13) months subsequent to the
later of the date of incorporation of the Corporation or the last annual
meeting of stockholders.

  

 Section 2.4 _ Special Meetings._ Unless otherwise provided in the Certificate of Incorporation, special meetings of the stockholders for any purpose or purposes may be called at any time by the Chairman of the Board, by the President or by a majority of the Board of Directors, and shall be called by the Chairman of the Board, by the President or the Secretary upon the written request therefor, stating the purpose or purposes of the meeting, delivered to such officer, signed by the holder(s) of at least twenty five percent (25%) of the issued and outstanding stock entitled to vote at such meeting. 

  

 Section 2.5 _ Record Date._ For the purpose of determining stockholders entitled to notice of or to vote at any meeting of stockholders, or any adjournment thereof, or entitled to express consent to corporate action in writing without a meeting, or entitled to receive payment of any dividend or other distribution or allotment of any rights, or entitled to exercise any rights in respect of any change, conversion or exchange of stock or for the purpose of any other lawful action, the Board of Directors of the Corporation may fix, in advance, a date as the record date for any such determination of stockholders, which date shall not be more than sixty (60) days nor less than ten (l0) days before the date of such meeting, nor more than sixty (60) days prior to any other action. 

  

 If the Board of Directors does not fix a record date for any meeting of the stockholders, the record date for determining stockholders entitled to notice of or to vote at such meeting shall be at the close of business on the day next preceding the day on which notice is given or, if, in accordance with _Section 8.3_ of these bylaws notice is waived, at the close of business on the day next preceding the day on which the meeting is held. If, in accordance with _Section 2.12_, corporate action without a meeting of stockholders is to be taken, the record date for determining stockholders entitled to express consent to such corporate action in writing, when no prior action by the Board of Directors is necessary, shall be the day on which the first written consent is expressed. The record date for determining stockholders for any other purpose shall be at the close of business on the day on which the Board of Directors adopts the resolution relating thereto. 

  

 A determination of stockholders of record entitled to notice of or to vote at a meeting of stockholders shall apply to any adjournment of the meeting; _provided_ , _however_ , that the Board of Directors may fix a new record date for the adjourned meeting. 

   

 Section 2.6 _ Notice of Meetings._ Written notice of the place, date and hour of all meetings, and, in case of a special meeting, the purpose or purposes for which the meeting is called, shall be given by or at the direction of the Chairman of the Board or the President, the Secretary or the other person(s) calling the meeting to each stockholder entitled to vote thereat not less than ten (10) nor more than sixty (60) days before the date of the meeting. Such notice may be delivered personally, by mail or by electronic transmission pursuant to Section 232 of the DGCL. If mailed, notice is given when deposited in the United States mail, postage prepaid, directed to the stockholder at his address as it appears on the records of the Corporation. If electronically transmitted, notice is given as provided in Section 232 of the DGCL. 

  

 Section 2.7 _ Stock List._ A complete list of stockholders entitled to vote at any meeting of stockholders, arranged in alphabetical order for each class of stock and showing the address of each such stockholder and the number of shares registered in the name of such stockholder, shall be open to the examination of any stockholder, for any purpose germane to the meeting, during ordinary business hours, for a period of at least ten (10) days prior to the meeting at the Corporation\'s principal place of business during ordinary business hours. The stockholder list shall also be produced and kept at the time and place of the meeting during the whole time thereof, and may be inspected by any stockholder who is present. 

        
  

 Section 2.8 _ Proxies._ Each stockholder entitled to vote at a meeting of stockholders or to express consent or dissent to a corporate action in writing without a meeting may authorize another person or persons to act for him by proxy. Proxies for use at any meeting of stockholders shall be filed with the Secretary, or such other officer as the Board of Directors may from time to time determine by resolution, before or at the time of the meeting. All proxies shall be received and taken charge of and all ballots shall be received and canvassed by the secretary of the meeting who shall decide all questions touching upon the qualification of voters, the validity of the proxies, and the acceptance or rejection of votes, unless an inspector or inspectors shall have been appointed by the chairman of the meeting, in which event such inspector or inspectors shall decide all such questions. 

  

 No proxy shall be valid after three (3) years from its date, unless the proxy provides for a longer period. Each proxy shall be revocable unless expressly provided therein to be irrevocable and coupled with an interest sufficient in law to support an irrevocable power. 

   

 Should a proxy designate two or more persons to act as proxies, unless such instrument shall provide the contrary, a majority of such persons present at any meeting at which their powers thereunder are to be exercised shall have and may exercise all the powers of voting or giving consents thereby conferred, or if only one be present, then such powers may be exercised by that one; or, if an even number attend and a majority do not agree on any particular issue, each proxy so attending shall be entitled to exercise such powers in respect of the same portion of the shares as he is of the proxies representing such shares. 

  

 Section 2.9 _ Voting; Elections; Inspectors._ Unless otherwise required by law or provided in the Certificate of Incorporation, each stockholder shall have one vote for each share of stock entitled to vote that is registered in such stockholder\'s name on the record date for the meeting. Shares registered in the name of another corporation, domestic or foreign, may be voted by such officer, agent or proxy as the bylaw (or comparable instrument) of such corporation may prescribe, or in the absence of such provision, as the board of directors (or comparable body) of such corporation may determine. Shares registered in the name of a deceased person may be voted by his executor or administrator, either in person or by proxy. 

  

 All voting, except as required by the Certificate of Incorporation or where otherwise required by law, may be by a voice vote; _provided_ , _however_ , that upon demand therefor by stockholders holding a majority of the issued and outstanding stock present in person or by proxy at any meeting a stock vote shall be taken. Every stock vote shall be taken by written ballots, each of which shall state the name of the stockholder or proxy voting and such other information as may be required under the procedure established for the meeting. Unless otherwise provided in the Certificate of Incorporation, all elections of directors shall be by ballot. 

  

 At any meeting at which a vote is taken by ballots, the chairman of the meeting may appoint one or more inspectors, each of whom shall subscribe an oath or affirmation to execute faithfully the duties of inspector at such meeting with strict impartiality and according to the best of his ability. Such inspector shall receive the ballots, count the votes and make and sign a certificate of the result thereof. The chairman of the meeting may appoint any person to serve as inspector, except no candidate for the office of director shall be appointed as an inspector. 

  

 Unless otherwise provided in the Certificate of Incorporation, cumulative voting for the election of directors shall be prohibited. 

  

 Section 2.10 _ Conduct of Meetings._ The meetings of the stockholders shall be presided over by the Chairman of the Board, or if he is not present, by the President, or if neither the Chairman of the Board, nor President is present, by a chairman elected at the meeting. The Secretary of the Corporation, if present, shall act as secretary of such meetings, or if such person is not present, then a secretary shall be appointed by the chairman of the meeting. The chairman of any meeting of 

        
  

stockholders shall determine the order of business and the procedure at the
meeting, including such regulation of the manner of voting and the conduct of
discussion as seem to him in order.

  

 Section 2.11 _ Treasury Stock._ The Corporation shall not vote, directly or indirectly, shares of its own stock owned by it and such shares shall not be counted for quorum purposes. 

  

 Section 2.12 _ Action Without Meeting._ Unless otherwise provided in the Certificate of Incorporation, any action permitted or required by law, the Certificate of Incorporation or these bylaws to be taken at a meeting of stockholders, may be taken without a meeting, without prior notice and without a vote, if a consent in writing, setting forth the action so taken, shall be signed by the holders of outstanding stock having not less than the minimum number of votes that would be necessary to authorize or take such action at a meeting at which all shares entitled to vote thereon were present and voted. Prompt notice of the taking of the corporate action without a meeting by less than a unanimous written consent shall be given by the Secretary to those stockholders who have not consented in writing.

 Section 3.8 _ Removal._ Any director or the entire Board of Directors may be removed, with or without cause, by the holders of a majority of the shares then entitled to vote at an election of directors; _provided_ that, unless the Certificate of Incorporation otherwise provides, if the Board of Directors is classified, then the stockholders may effect such removal only for cause; and _provided further_ that, if the Certificate of Incorporation expressly grants to stockholders the right to cumulate votes for the election of directors and if less than the entire board is to be removed, no director may be removed without cause if the votes cast against his removal would be sufficient to elect him if then cumulatively voted at an election of the entire Board of Directors, or, if there be classes of directors, at an election of the class of directors of which such director is a part. 

  

 Section 3.9 _ Vacancies; Increases in the Number of Directors._ Unless otherwise provided in the Certificate of Incorporation, newly created directorships resulting from any increase in the authorized number of directors and any other vacancy on the Board of Directors may be filled by a majority of the directors then in office, although less than a quorum, or a sole remaining director; and any director so chosen shall hold office until the next annual election and until his successor shall be duly elected and shall qualify, unless sooner displaced.

 Section 3.12 _ Approval or Ratification of Acts or Contracts by Stockholders._ The Board of Directors in its discretion may submit any act or contract for approval or ratification at any annual meeting of the stockholders, or at any special meeting of the stockholders called for the purpose of considering any such act or contract, and any act or contract that shall be approved or be ratified by the vote of the stockholders holding a majority of the issued and outstanding shares of stock of the Corporation entitled to vote and present in person or by proxy at such meeting (provided that a quorum is present), shall be as valid and as binding upon the Corporation and upon all the stockholders as if it has been approved or ratified by every stockholder of the Corporation.

ARTICLE VI 
 INDEMNIFICATION OF DIRECTORS, 
 OFFICERS, EMPLOYEES AND AGENTS

  

 Section 6.1 _ Right to Indemnification._ Each person who was or is made a party or is threatened to be made a party to or is involved in any threatened, pending or completed action, suit or proceeding, whether civil, criminal, administrative or investigative (hereinafter a " _proceeding_ "), by reason of the fact that such person or a person of whom such person is the legal representative, is or was or has agreed to become a director or officer of the Corporation or is or was serving or has agreed to serve at the request of the Corporation as a director, officer, employee or agent of another corporation or of a partnership, joint venture, trust or other enterprise, including service with respect to employee benefit plans, whether the basis of such proceeding is alleged action in an official capacity as a director or officer or in any other capacity while serving or having agreed to serve as a director or officer, shall be indemnified and held harmless by the Corporation to the fullest extent authorized by the DGCL, as the same exists or may hereafter be amended, (but, in the case of any such amendment, only to the extent that such amendment permits the Corporation to provide broader indemnification rights than said law permitted the Corporation to provide prior to such amendment) against all expense, liability and loss (including without limitation, attorneys\' fees, judgments, fines, ERISA excise taxes or penalties and amounts paid or to be paid in settlement) reasonably incurred or suffered by such person in connection therewith and such indemnification shall continue as to a person who has ceased to serve in the capacity that initially entitled such person to indemnity hereunder and shall inure to the benefit of such person\'s heirs, executors and administrators; _provided, however_ , that the Corporation shall indemnify any such person seeking indemnification in connection with a proceeding (or part thereof), other than a proceeding (or part thereof) brought under _Section 6.3_, initiated by such person or such person\'s heirs, executors and administrators only if such proceeding (or part thereof) was authorized by the board of directors of the Corporation. 

  

 The right to indemnification conferred in this _Article VI_ shall be a contract right and shall include the right to be paid by the Corporation the expenses incurred in defending any such proceeding in advance of its final disposition; _provided_ , _however_ , that, if the DGCL requires, the payment of such expenses incurred by a current, former or proposed director or officer in such person\'s capacity as a director or officer or proposed director or officer (and not in any other capacity in which service was or is or has been agreed to be rendered by such person while a director or officer, including, without limitation, service to an employee benefit plan) in advance of the final disposition of a proceeding, shall be made only upon delivery to the Corporation of an undertaking, by or on behalf of such indemnified person, to repay all amounts so advanced if it shall ultimately be determined that such indemnified person is not entitled to be indemnified under this Section or otherwise. 

  

 Section 6.2 _ Indemnification of Employees and Agents._ The Corporation may, by action of its Board of Directors, provide indemnification to employees and agents of the Corporation, individually or as a group, with the same scope and effect as the indemnification of directors and officers provided for in this _Article VI_. 

  

 Section 6.3 _ Right of Claimant to Bring Suit._ If a written claim received by the Corporation from or on behalf of an indemnified party under this _Article VI_ is not paid in full by the Corporation within ninety (90) days after such receipt, the claimant may at any time thereafter bring suit against the 

        
  

Corporation to recover the unpaid amount of the claim and, if successful in
whole or in part, the claimant shall be entitled to be paid also the expense
of prosecuting such claim. It shall be a defense to any such action (other
than an action brought to enforce a claim for expenses incurred in defending
any proceeding in advance of its final disposition where the required
undertaking, if any is required, has been tendered to the Corporation) that
the claimant has not met the standards of conduct that make it permissible
under the DGCL for the Corporation to indemnify the claimant for the amount
claimed, but the burden of proving such defense shall be on the Corporation.
Neither the failure of the Corporation (including its Board of Directors,
independent legal counsel, or its stockholders) to have made a determination
prior to the commencement of such action that indemnification of the claimant
is proper in the circumstances because such person has met the
applicable standard of conduct set forth in the DGCL, nor an actual
determination by the Corporation (including its Board of Directors,
independent legal counsel, or its stockholders) that the claimant has not met
such applicable standard of conduct, shall be a defense to the action or
create a presumption that the claimant has not met the applicable standard of
conduct.

   

 Section 6.4 _ Nonexclusivity of Rights._ The right to indemnification and the advancement and payment of expenses conferred in this _Article VI_ shall not be exclusive of any other right that any person may have or hereafter acquire under any law (common or statutory), provision of the Certificate of Incorporation of the Corporation, bylaw, agreement, vote of stockholders or disinterested directors or otherwise. 

  

 Section 6.5 _ Insurance._ The Corporation may maintain insurance, at its expense, to protect itself and any person who is or was serving as a director, officer, employee or agent of the Corporation or is or was serving at the request of the Corporation as a director, officer, employee or agent of another corporation, partnership, joint venture, trust or other enterprise against any expense, liability or loss asserted against such person and incurred by any such person in any such capacity, or arising out of such person\'s status as such, whether or not the Corporation would have the power to indemnify such person against such expense, liability or loss under the DGCL. 

  

 Section 6.6 _ Savings Clause._ If this _Article VI_ or any portion hereof shall be invalidated on any ground by any court of competent jurisdiction, then the Corporation shall nevertheless indemnify and hold harmless each director and officer of the Corporation, as to costs, charges and expenses (including attorneys\' fees), judgments, fines, and amounts paid in settlement with respect to any action, suit or proceeding, whether civil, criminal, administrative or investigative to the full extent permitted by any applicable portion of this _Article VI_ that shall not have been invalidated and to the fullest extent permitted by applicable law. 

  

 Section 6.7 _ Amendment, Modification or Repeal.._ Any amendment, modification or repeal this _Article VI_ by the Board of Directors or the stockholders of the Corporation shall not adversely affect any right of or protection afforded to a director, officer, employee or agent of the Corporation existing at the time of such amendment, modification or repeal. 

  

ARTICLE VII

 Section 7.1 _ Certificates of Stock._ The certificates for shares of the capital stock of the Corporation shall be in such form, not inconsistent with that required by law and the Certificate of Incorporation, as shall be approved by the Board of Directors. The Chairman of the Board, President or a Vice President shall cause to be issued to each stockholder one or more certificates, under the seal of the Corporation or a facsimile thereof if the Board of Directors shall have provided for such seal, and signed by the Chairman of the Board, President or a Vice President and the Secretary or the Treasurer or certifying the number of shares (and, if the stock of the Corporation shall be divided into classes or series, the class and series of such shares) owned by such stockholder in the Corporation; 

        
  

 _provided, however_ , that any of or all the signatures on the certificate
may be facsimile. The stock record books and the blank stock certificate books
shall be kept by the Secretary, or at the office of such transfer agent or
transfer agents as the Board of Directors may from time to time by resolution
determine. In case any officer, transfer agent or registrar who shall have
signed or whose facsimile signature or signatures shall have been placed upon
any such certificate or certificates shall have ceased to be such officer,
transfer agent or registrar before such certificate is issued by the
Corporation, such certificate may nevertheless be issued by the Corporation
with the same effect as if such person were such officer, transfer agent or
registrar at the date of issue. The stock certificates shall be consecutively
numbered and shall be entered in the books of the Corporation as they are
issued and shall exhibit the holder\'s name and number of shares.

  

 Section 7.2 _ Transfer of Shares._ The shares of stock of the Corporation shall be transferable only on the books of the Corporation by the holders thereof in person or by their duly authorized attorneys or legal representatives upon surrender and cancellation of certificates for a like number of shares. Upon surrender to the Corporation or a transfer agent of the Corporation of a certificate for shares duly endorsed or accompanied by proper evidence of succession, assignment or authority to transfer, it shall be the duty of the Corporation to issue a new certificate to the person entitled thereto, cancel the old certificate and record the transaction upon its books. 

   

 Section 7.3 _ Ownership of Shares._ The Corporation shall be entitled to treat the holder of record of any share or shares of capital stock of the Corporation as the holder in fact thereof and, accordingly, shall not be bound to recognize any equitable or other claim to or interest in such share or shares on the part of any other person, whether or not it shall have express or other notice thereof, except as otherwise provided by the laws of the State of Delaware. 

  

 Section 7.4 _ Regulations Regarding Certificates._ The Board of Directors shall have the power and authority to make all such rules and regulations as they may deem expedient concerning the issue, transfer and registration or the replacement of certificates for shares of capital stock of the Corporation. 

  

 Section 7.5 _ Lost or Destroyed Certificates._ The Board of Directors may determine the conditions upon which a new certificate of stock may be issued in place of a certificate which is alleged to have been lost, stolen or destroyed; and may, in their discretion, require the owner of such certificate or his legal representative to give bond, with sufficient surety, to indemnify the Corporation and each transfer agent and registrar against any and all losses or claims which may arise by reason of the issue of a new certificate in the place of the one so lost, stolen or destroyed. 

  

ARTICLE VIII 
 MISCELLANEOUS PROVISIONS

  

 Section 8.1 _ Fiscal Year._ The fiscal year of the Corporation shall be a calendar year unless the Board of Directors may establish from time to time. 

  

 Section 8.2 _ Corporate Seal._ The Board of Directors may provide a suitable seal, containing the name of the Corporation. The Secretary shall have charge of the seal (if any). If and when so directed by the Board of Directors or a committee thereof, duplicates of the seal may be kept and used by the Treasurer or by the Secretary. 

  

 Section 8.3 _ Notice and Waiver of Notice._ Except as otherwise provided in the bylaws, whenever any notice is required to be given by law, the Certificate of Incorporation or under the provisions of these bylaws, said notice shall be deemed to be sufficient if given (i) by telegraphic, cable, wireless or electronic transmission or (ii) by deposit of the same in a post office box postage paid in a sealed prepaid wrapper addressed to the person entitled thereto at his post office address, as it appears on the 

        
  

records of the Corporation, and such notice shall be deemed to have been
given on the day of such transmission or mailing, as the case may be.

   

 Whenever notice is required to be given by law, the Certificate of Incorporation or under any of the provisions of these bylaws, a written waiver thereof, signed by the person entitled to notice, whether before or after the time stated therein, shall be deemed equivalent to notice. Attendance of a person at a meeting shall constitute a waiver of notice of such meeting, except when the person attends a meeting for the express purpose of objecting, at the beginning of the meeting, to the transaction of any business because the meeting is not lawfully called or convened. Neither the business to be transacted at, nor the purpose of, any regular or special meeting of the stockholders, directors, or members of a committee of directors need be specified in any written waiver of notice unless so required by the Certificate of Incorporation or the bylaws. 

   

 Section 8.4 _ Resignations._ Any director, member of a committee or officer may resign at any time. Such resignation shall be made in writing and shall take effect at the time specified therein, or if no time be specified, at the time of its receipt by the President or Secretary. The acceptance of a resignation shall not be necessary to make it effective, unless expressly so provided in the resignation. 

  

 Section 8.5 _ Facsimile Signatures._ In addition to the provisions for the use of facsimile signatures elsewhere specifically authorized in these bylaws, facsimile signatures of any officer or officers of the Corporation may be used whenever and as authorized by the Board of Directors. 

  

 Section 8.6 _ Reliance upon Books, Reports and Records._ Each director and each member of any committee designated by the Board of Directors shall, in the performance of such director\'s or member\'s duties, be fully protected in relying in good faith upon the books of account or reports made to the Corporation by any of its officers, or by an independent certified public accountant, or by an appraiser selected with reasonable care by the Board of Directors or by any such committee, or in relying in good faith upon other records of the Corporation. 

  

ARTICLE IX 
 AMENDMENTS

  

 Section 9.1 _ Amendments._ If provided in the Certificate of Incorporation of the Corporation, the Board of Directors shall have the power to adopt, amend and repeal from time to time bylaws of the Corporation, subject to the right of the stockholders entitled to vote with respect thereto to amend or repeal such bylaws as adopted or amended by the Board of Directors.

_CONFIDENTIALITY AGREEMENT 

_ , 2007 

  


  
  

  

Ladies and Gentlemen:

  

 We understand that ("you") may be interested in considering a possible negotiated transaction involving a business combination with MarkWest Hydrocarbon, Inc. (together with its affiliated companies, the " _Company_ "). In connection with your interest in a possible negotiated transaction involving a business combination with the Company (any such possible transaction being referred to herein as a " _Transaction_ "), we propose to furnish you with certain confidential information related to the Company. As a condition to your receipt of such Confidential Information (as hereinafter defined), you agree to treat the Confidential Information and any other information concerning a Transaction or the Company which is furnished to you or your Representatives (as defined below) by or on behalf of the Company in accordance with the provisions of this Confidentiality Agreement (this " _Agreement_ ") and to take or refrain from taking certain other actions herein set forth. 

  

 1.

 You recognize and acknowledge the competitive value and confidential nature of the Confidential Information and the damage that would result to the Company if any of the Confidential Information is disclosed to any third party in violation of this Agreement. You hereby agree that the Confidential Information will be used solely for the purposes of evaluating a Transaction and that all of the Confidential Information will be kept confidential by you and your Representatives; _provided_ that any such information may be disclosed only to your Representatives who need to know the Confidential Information because they are working on or consulted in connection with evaluating a Transaction and shall not be used for any purpose other than for the purposes of evaluating a Transaction. " _Representatives_ " means, collectively, and with respect to a person or entity, the partners, officers, directors, employees and affiliates (and employees of such affiliates), agents, financial, legal or accounting or other advisors or other representatives of such person or entity. You represent that each of your Representatives is formally apprised of his or her obligations concerning the confidentiality of all client affairs and information and will be apprised of his or her obligations hereunder prior to disclosure of any Confidential Information. You agree that you shall be responsible for any breach of this Agreement by any of your Representatives.  


2.

 The term "Confidential Information" includes (i) all information furnished by or on behalf of the Company or any of its Representatives, whether furnished before or after the date hereof, whether oral or written, and regardless of the manner in which it is furnished, (ii) all analyses, compilations, forecasts, studies, interpretations or other documents prepared by you or your Representatives in connection with your evaluation of a Transaction (including, without limitation, such that reflects or is based upon, in whole or part, the information furnished to you or your Representatives pursuant hereto) (collectively, " _Notes_ "), and (iii) the fact that (a) information has been furnished to you or your Representatives, (b) you are considering a possible Transaction involving the Company and (c) discussions or negotiations are taking place concerning a possible Transaction, and any of the terms, conditions or other facts with respect to any such possible Transaction, including the status thereof. The term "Confidential Information" does not include any information that (i) at the time of disclosure or thereafter is generally available to or known by the public (other than as a result of its disclosure by you or your Representatives in breach of this Agreement), or (ii) becomes available to you from a person who is not known by you to be 
      

  

prohibited from transmitting the information to you by an obligation of
secrecy to the Company. As used in this Agreement, the term "person" shall be
broadly interpreted to include, without limitation, any individual,
partnership, corporation, trust, limited liability company, or other entity.

  

 

 3.

 Given the nature of the Confidential Information, the Company and its Representatives may be irreparably damaged by any unauthorized disclosure of any Confidential Information or by any breach of this Agreement by you or your Representatives. Without prejudice to the rights and remedies otherwise available to the Company, you, therefore, agree that the Company shall be entitled to seek equitable relief, including an injunction or specific performance, in the event of any breach of the provisions of this Agreement by you or your Representatives. Such remedies shall not be deemed to be exclusive remedies but shall be in addition to all other remedies available at law or equity to the Company. In the event of litigation relating to this Agreement, if a court of competent jurisdiction determines in a final, non-appealable order that you or any of your Representatives have breached this Agreement, then you shall be liable and pay to the Company the costs and expenses (including attorney\'s fees) as awarded by that competent court that result as a consequence of you not meeting the terms of this Agreement.  


4.

 All of the Confidential Information shall remain the property of the Company. Within 15 days of any request by the Company or its Representative, you agree to (i) destroy, except to the extent that you have been advised in writing by outside counsel that such destruction is prohibited by law, or redeliver to the person making the request all Confidential Information in printed format or compact disc/dvd and delete from the emails and directories of your and your Representative\'s computers Confidential Information transmitted by the Company or its Representatives in electronic format and (ii) destroy all Notes and other materials prepared by you or your Representatives based upon, containing or otherwise reflecting the Confidential Information. Notwithstanding the above, you and your Representatives (i) may retain Confidential Information in accordance with your internal compliance procedures or to the extent any of such information is relevant to demonstrate compliance by you or your Representatives with any legal, regulatory, professional or fiduciary obligation, and (ii) shall only be required to use commercially reasonable efforts to destroy Confidential Information that is stored electronically; _provided_ that such Confidential Information that is not returned or destroyed (including oral information) shall remain subject to this Agreement.  


5.

 Without the prior written consent of the Company, for a period of one year from the date of this Agreement, you will not, and will cause your affiliates not to, and will not encourage or assist others, directly or indirectly, to: (i) acquire, offer or propose (whether publicly or otherwise) to acquire, or agree or seek to acquire, by purchase or otherwise, any securities or direct or indirect rights or options to acquire any securities of the Company or its subsidiaries with the intent or effect of acquiring a controlling interest in the Company or its subsidiaries or of any successor to or person in control of the Company or any of its subsidiaries, or any assets of the Company or its subsidiaries or divisions thereof or of any such successor or controlling person, (ii) enter into or agree, offer, propose or seek to enter into, or otherwise be involved in or part of, any acquisition transaction or other business combination relating to all or part of the Company or its subsidiaries or any acquisition transaction for all or part of the assets of the Company or its subsidiaries or any of their respective businesses; (iii) make, or in any way participate in, any "solicitation" of "proxies" (as such terms are used in the rules of the Securities and Exchange Commission) to vote, or seek to advise or influence any person or entity with respect to the voting of, or to provide or withhold consents with respect to any voting securities of the Company or any of its subsidiaries; (iv) form, join or in any way participate in a "group" (within the meaning of Section 13(d)(3) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934) either with respect to any voting securities of the Company or any of its subsidiaries or in connection with any of the types of matters set forth in (i) through (iii) above; (v) seek or propose, alone or in concert with others, to 
      

  

influence or control the Company\'s management, Board of Directors or
policies of the Company or any of its subsidiaries; (vi) enter into any
discussions, negotiations, arrangements or understandings with any other
Person with respect to any of the foregoing activities or propose any of such
activities to any other Person; (vii) advise, assist, encourage, act as a
financing source for or otherwise invest in any other person in connection
any of the foregoing activities; or (viii) disclose any intention, plan or
arrangement inconsistent with any of the foregoing. You will promptly advise
the Company of any inquiry or proposal made to you with respect to any of the
foregoing. You also agree that, during, the one-year period from the date of
this Agreement, neither you or any of your affiliates will: (i) request the
Company or its advisors, directly or indirectly, to (A) amend or waive any
provision of this paragraph (including this sentence) or (B) otherwise
consent to any action inconsistent with any provision of this paragraph
(including this sentence); or (ii) take any initiative with respect to the
Company or any of its subsidiaries which could require the Company to make a
public announcement regarding (A) such initiative, (B) any of the activities
referred to in the second preceding sentence, (C) the possibility of a
Transaction or (D) the possibility of you or any other person acquiring,
control of the Company, whether by means of a business combination
or otherwise. Notwithstanding the foregoing, if an unaffiliated third party
seeks to acquire or assists, advises or encourages any other persons in
seeking to acquire, directly or indirectly, control of the Company or any of
the Company\'s securities, businesses or assets without the consent of the
Company\'s board of directors during the one-year period from the date of this
Agreement, then you will be permitted hereunder to take any of the foregoing
actions.

  

 

 6.

 For a period of one year from the date of this Agreement, you shall not, and you shall cause your affiliates not to, directly or indirectly, solicit for employment or hire any employee of the Company or any of its subsidiaries with whom you have had contact or who became known to you in connection with your evaluation of a Transaction; _provided_ that it will not be a breach of the foregoing provision if you (i) make solicitations for employment by general advertisements in periodicals of broad distribution or other advertisement media of similar nature or through the use of search firms that are not directed specifically at executives or employees of the Company or (ii) hire any person that responds to a solicitation of the type described in _clause (i)_ if such party has not otherwise solicited such person  


7.

 You understand and acknowledge that neither the Company nor any of its Representatives makes any representation or warranty, express or implied, as to the accuracy or completeness of the Confidential Information. Other than as set forth in a definitive transaction agreement, you agree that neither the Company nor any of its Representatives shall have any liability to you or any of your Representatives relating to or resulting from your or their use of the Confidential Information or any errors therein or omissions therefrom.  


8.

 In the event that the you or your Representatives are requested or required by law, regulation (including the rules or regulations of any securities exchange on which such party\'s securities are listed for trading), regulatory authority or other applicable judicial or governmental order to disclose any Confidential Information, you shall immediately upon learning of such request or requirement, notify the Company in writing of such request or requirement so that the Company may seek an appropriate protective order or other appropriate remedy (and if the Company seeks such an order or remedy, you will provide such cooperation, at the Company\'s expense, as the Company shall reasonably request). If no such protective order or other remedy is obtained and you or your Representatives are, upon the advice of outside counsel, legally compelled to disclose the Confidential Information, you or your Representatives, as the case may be, shall only disclose that portion of the Confidential Information that your or their outside counsel advises that you or they are compelled to disclose and will exercise reasonable efforts to obtain assurance that confidential treatment will be accorded to that portion of the Confidential Information that is 
      

  

being disclosed. In any event, you will not oppose action by the Company to
obtain an appropriate protective order or other reliable assurance that
confidential treatment will be accorded the Confidential Information. Any
disclosure of Confidential Information pursuant to and in accordance with this
Section 8 shall not constitute a breach of this Agreement.

  

 

 9.

 You agree that, unless and until a binding agreement is entered into with respect to a Transaction, neither the Company nor you will be under any legal obligation of any kind whatsoever with respect to a Transaction by virtue of this or any other written or oral expression, except with respect to the matters specifically agreed to herein. Except for the matters set forth in this Agreement or in any such binding agreement, no party shall be entitled to rely on any statement, promise, agreement or understanding, whether oral or written, any custom, usage of trade, course of dealing or conduct.  


10.

 You hereby acknowledge that you are aware and that you will advise your Representatives that the United States federal and state securities laws prohibit any person or entity who has material, non-public information about a company from purchasing or selling securities of such a company or from communicating such information to any other person or entity under circumstances in which it is reasonably foreseeable that such person or entity is likely to purchase or sell such securities.  


11.

 This Agreement shall be governed and construed in accordance with the laws of the State of Colorado without regard to conflict of laws principles. Any action brought in connection with this Agreement may be brought in the federal or state courts located in the City of Denver, Colorado, and the parties hereto hereby irrevocably consent to the jurisdiction of such courts.  


12.

 The provisions of this Agreement shall be binding solely upon and inure to the benefit of the parties hereto and their respective successors and assigns.  


13.

 This Agreement represents the entire understanding and agreement of the parties hereto and may be modified only by a separate written agreement executed by the parties hereto expressly modifying this Agreement. This Agreement supersedes and cancels any and all prior agreements between the parties hereto, express or implied, relating to a Transaction.  


14.

 This Agreement may be executed in any number of counterparts, each of which when so executed shall be deemed an original, but such counterparts shall together constitute one and the same Agreement.  


15.

 In the event that any provision or portion of this Agreement is determined to be invalid or unenforceable for any reason, in whole or in part, the remaining provisions of this Agreement shall be unaffected thereby and shall remain in full force and effect to the fullest extent permitted by law.  


16.

 The failure or refusal of any party hereto to insist upon strict performance of any provision of this Agreement or to exercise any right in any one or more instances or circumstances shall not be construed as a waiver or relinquishment of such provision or right, nor shall such failures or refusals be deemed a custom or practice contrary to such provision or right.  


17.

 Unless otherwise stated herein, this Agreement shall terminate on the date that is two (2) years after the date hereof; _provided, however_ , that termination of this Agreement will not in any manner terminate the obligations of the parties under any applicable trade secret laws, and any Confidential Information that is also trade secrets will be entitled to the full benefits and protections of such laws. 
       

 Please confirm your agreement with the foregoing by signing and returning to the undersigned a duplicate copy of this Agreement.
