shall assume all of the Assumed  Liabilities on the Closing Date.

 




 

 

 

 

 

 

5  

 

 

 

 


 

4.02   Manner of Payment  of the Purchase Price at Closing. At Closing,
Purchaser shall  (a) assume the Assumed Liabilities by executing the
Assignment and  Assumption Agreement (as defined in Section 10.03(c) below)
and (b) pay to  Seller, by wire transfer of immediately available funds, an
amount equal to  One  Hundred Sixty-Three Million Dollars ($163,000,000.00)
plus the amount, if any,  by which the Estimated Closing Net Working Capital
(as determined in accordance  with Section 4.04) exceeds Thirty-Five Million
Twenty-Two Thousand Dollars  ($35,022,000) (the "Initial Net Working
Capital") or minus the amount, if any,  by which Initial Net Working Capital
exceeds the Estimated Closing Net Working  Capital (the "Estimated Purchase
Price") and minus Five Million Dollars  ($5,000,000.00) (the "Escrow
Amount"). At Closing, the Escrow Amount  shall be wired by Purchaser to a
bank selected by Purchaser in the Purchaser\'s  bank group subject to the
consent of PIL, which consent shall not be  unreasonably withheld (the
"Escrow Agent"). The Escrow Amount shall  be held and applied by the Escrow
Agent in accordance with the terms and  conditions set forth in the escrow
agreement in the form of Exhibit 4.02  attached hereto among LCB, on behalf
of Purchaser, PIL, on behalf of Seller  and  the Escrow Agent (the "Escrow
Agreement"). The Escrow Amount, plus a  corresponding amount of any interest
accrued thereon, will be released to Seller  as follows: one-third (1/3rd) 
on the  date that is six (6) months after the Closing Date less any
outstanding claims  on such date; one-third (1/3rd)  on the  date that is
twelve (12) months after the Closing Date less any outstanding  claims on
such date; and the balance on the date that is eighteen (18) months  after
the Closing Date less any outstanding claims on such date. All  fees and
charges of the Escrow Agent shall be the sole responsibility of  Purchaser.

 



 

4.03. Allocation  of Purchase  Price. Within ten days following the date of
this Agreement,  the Seller shall deliver a proposed allocation of the
Purchase Price among  the  different categories of Purchased Assets. The
parties shall mutually  agree upon the final allocation of the Purchase Price
among the different  categories of Purchased Assets prior to Closing. The
Seller\'s  proposed allocation and the final allocation agreed to by the
parties shall  be  in accordance with all applicable laws. The parties shall
report the  tax consequences of the transactions called for in this Agreement
in a manner  consistent with final allocation agreed upon by the parties in
accordance with  this Section 4.03. Neither Purchaser nor Seller shall take a
position  for tax purposes which is inconsistent with such allocation unless
required  to  do so under applicable law and prior written notice is given
to each of the  other parties hereto.

 



 

4.04   Post-Closing  Adjustments.

 



 

(a)   At least three business days prior to the Closing Date, the Seller
shall prepare  and deliver to Purchaser a good faith estimate of the Net
Working Capital (as  defined below) as of the Closing Date (the "Estimated
Closing Net Working  Capital"), along with a report showing in reasonable
detail its calculation  of  such amount.

 



 

(b)   As soon as practicable, but not later than 60 days after the Closing, 
Purchaser shall prepare and deliver to Seller a statement (the "Closing Net 
Working Capital Statement") setting forth Purchaser\'s proposed calculation 
of  the Net Working Capital as of 12:01 a.m. on the Closing Date ("Closing
Net  Working Capital"). Seller and its accountant shall have the ability  to
participate in the preparation of the Closing Net Working Capital  Statement.
The Closing Net Working Capital Statement shall be  prepared in a manner
consistent with the preparation of the Initial Net Working  Capital (which
was derived in part from the Seller\'s consolidated financial  statements
prepared in accordance with GAAP) and the Sample Pro Forma Net  Working
Capital Statement attached hereto as Schedule 4.04(b), including the 
methodology used in calculating reserves and allowances; provided, however, 
that  the Net Working Capital Statement as of the Closing Date shall reflect
no assets  or liabilities other than Purchased Assets and Assumed 
Liabilities. Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, any  inventory
related to the Excluded Contracts set forth on Schedule 1.04 shall  be 
excluded from Closing Net Working Capital.

 




 

 

 

 

 

 

6  

 

 

 

 


 

(c)   Purchaser shall permit Seller to review all accounting records and all
work  papers and computations used by Purchaser in the preparation of the
Closing  Net  Working Capital Statement. If Seller does not give notice of
dispute to  Purchaser within 45 days of receiving the Closing Net Working
Capital  Statement prepared by Purchaser, the Closing Net Working Capital
Statement  prepared by Purchaser shall become the final Closing Net Working
Capital  Statement and the Closing Net Working Capital set forth on the
Closing Net  Working Capital Statement prepared by Purchaser shall be
conclusive and binding  upon Seller and Purchaser for purposes of this
Agreement. If Seller  gives notice of dispute to Purchaser within such 45-day
period, Seller and  Purchaser shall negotiate in good faith to resolve the
disputed  items. Any notice of dispute delivered hereunder shall set forth
the  specific line items in dispute and provide the basis for such dispute
in  reasonable detail. If, after 15 days from the date notice of a  dispute
is given hereunder, Seller and Purchaser cannot agree on the resolution  of
all of the disputed items, the items still in dispute shall be referred  to
an  independent public accounting firm acceptable to both Purchaser and
Seller  (the  "Unrelated Accounting Firm") to resolve the dispute, whose
decision as to the  issues in dispute shall be conclusive and binding upon
Seller and Purchaser  for  purposes of this Agreement. The Unrelated
Accounting Firm shall  address only those issues in dispute and may not
assign a value to any item  greater than the greatest value for such item
claimed by either party or less  than the smallest value for such item
claimed by either party. The  fees and expenses of the Unrelated Accounting
Firm pertaining to the dispute  resolution hereunder shall be shared equally
by Seller and Purchaser.

 



 

(d)   If the Closing Net Working Capital as finally determined pursuant to
Section  4.04(c) is less than the Estimated Closing Net Working Capital, the
Estimated  Purchase Price shall be reduced by the difference between the
Estimated Closing  Net Working Capital and the Closing Net  Working Capital
as finally determined pursuant to Section 4.04(c) (but only  if  such excess
is greater than $10,000). If the Closing Net Working  Capital as finally
determined pursuant to Section 4.04(c) is more than the  Estimated Closing
Net Working Capital, the Estimated Purchase Price shall be  increased by the
difference between the Estimated Closing Net Working Capital  and the Closing
Net Working Capital as finally determined pursuant to Section  4.04(c) (but
only if such excess is greater than $10,000).

 



 

(e)   If the effect of the adjustments to the Estimated Purchase Price
pursuant to  Section 4.04(d) is an increase in the Estimated Purchase Price,
Purchaser  shall pay to Seller, by wire transfer, the amount of such increase
in the  Estimated Purchase Price within five business days of Seller\'s
acceptance (or  deemed acceptance) of the Closing Net Working Capital
Statement or, if  applicable, within five business days of receipt of a
determination in  resolution of any dispute over the Closing Net Working
Capital Statement as  provided for in Section 4.04(c). If the effect of the 
adjustments to the Estimated Purchase Price pursuant to Section 4.04(d) is  a
decrease in the Estimated Purchase Price, Seller shall pay to Purchaser, 
by  wire transfer, the amount of such decrease in the Estimated Purchase
Price  within five business days of Seller\'s acceptance (or deemed
acceptance) of  the  Closing Net Working Capital Statement or, if
applicable, within five business  days of receipt of a determination in
resolution of any dispute over the Closing  Net Working Capital Statement as
provided for in  Section 4.04(c). Any payments made after the 5th  day 
following final resolution of Closing Net Working Capital shall be subject 
to  interest at a rate of 12% per annum from the date of final resolution
pursuant  to Section 4.04(c) to the date of payment of the entire amount due
(including  all interest on any such late payment). The party owing any
amounts  to the other party pursuant to Section 4.04(d) and this Section
4.04(e) shall  pay all of the reasonable, third-party out-of-pocket costs of
collection of  any  such amounts due.

 




 

 

 

 

 

 

7  

 

 

 

 


 

(f)   For purposes of this Agreement, "Net Working Capital" means the amount
of the  current asset line items, accounts or classifications of the Business
set forth  on Schedule 4.04(f) (net of all reserves) minus the amount of
current liability  line items, accounts or classifications of the Business
set forth on Schedule  4.04(f).

 



 

4.05   Payments of Transfer  Tax. All taxes imposed in connection with the
sale and  transfer of the Purchased Assets to Purchaser shall be borne by
Seller, and  Seller shall indemnify and hold Purchaser harmless with respect
to any such  tax  which might be levied on or collected from Purchaser.
Seller and  Purchaser shall cooperate in timely making all filings, returns,
reports and  forms, as may be required to comply with the provisions of such
tax  laws. Purchaser and Seller shall also cooperate in providing each 
other with appropriate resale exemption certifications and other similar tax 
and  fee documentation.

 



 

4.06   HSR Act  Filing. Purchaser and Seller agree to cooperate in
preparing  and filing any notice or other filing required under the Hart-
Scott-Rodino  Antitrust Improvements Act of 1976, as amended, and the rules
and regulations  thereunder (the "HSR Act") for the transactions contemplated
by this Agreement  as soon as practicable following the date of the
Agreement; provided, however,  that Purchaser and Seller shall use their
respective best efforts to prepare  and  file such HSR Act application as
soon as reasonably practicably following the  date of this Agreement, but in
no event later than ten days after the date  of  this Agreement. Purchaser
and Seller shall use their respective  commercially reasonable efforts to
obtain the waiver by the Federal Trade  Commission and the U.S. Department of
Justice of any objection to the  consummation of the transactions
contemplated hereby and/or obtain the early  termination or expiration of any
applicable waiting period under the HSR  Act. To the extent required by law,
each of the parties shall proceed  to obtain any other regulatory or
government consent or waiver, and to effect  any registrations or filings as
may be necessary for it to consummate the  transactions contemplated hereby.
The HSR Act filing fees shall be  paid by Purchaser.

 



 

5.   Closing. The  closing (the "Closing") of the transactions pursuant to this Agreement shall  take place at the offices of Much Shelist, 191 North Wacker Drive, Suite 1800,  Chicago, Illinois, at such time as Seller and Purchaser shall mutually agree  within five days after the satisfaction or waiver of all conditions to the  obligations of the parties hereto to consummate the transactions contemplated  hereby shall have occurred (other than conditions with respect to actions the  respective parties will take at the Closing itself). The date on  which the Closing occurs is referred to herein as the "Closing  Date." The Closing will be deemed effective as of 12:01 a.m. on the  Closing Date. By mutual agreement of the parties, the Closing may be  alternatively accomplished by facsimile/PDF transmission to the respective  offices of legal counsel for the parties of the requisite documents, duly  executed where required, with originals to be delivered by overnight courier  service to arrive on the next business day following the Closing.

6.07   Inventory. The  inventory of the Business is of a quality and
quantity usable and saleable  in  the ordinary course of business consistent
with the past practice of the  Business subject to applicable reserves for
excess and obsolete  inventory. The value at which the Seller carries the
inventory of the  Business on the Financial Statements reflects its customary
inventory valuation  policy of stating inventory on the FIFO method at the
lesser of cost or  market. No inventory of the Business has been consigned
to  others. The quantity of the inventory of the Business is sufficient  and
adequate for, but is not materially in excess of the level appropriate  to, 
the conduct of the Business as it previously has been conducted. The  Seller
has not made any purchase commitments with respect to the Business in  excess
of normal, ordinary and usual requirements.

 



 

6.08   Title to Seller\'s  Assets. The Seller has good and marketable title
to, or a  valid and binding leasehold interest in, all the Purchased Assets,
free and  clear of all mortgages, security interests, title retention
agreements, options  to purchase, rights of first refusal, liens, easements,
encumbrances,  restrictions and other burdens of any nature whatsoever
("Encumbrances"), except  for those Encumbrances described on Schedule 6.08
(collectively, "Permitted  Encumbrances").

 



 

6.09   Condition and  Sufficiency of Assets. The tangible assets of the 
Business, other than inventory, are in all material respects in good
condition  and working order (reasonable wear and tear excepted) and are
adequate, in  quality and quantity, for the operation of the Business. No 
maintenance outside the ordinary course of business is needed with respect 
to  the Purchased Assets. Except as set forth on Schedule 6.09, the 
Purchased Assets constitute all of the assets, tangible and intangible, of 
any  nature whatsoever, necessary to conduct the Business in the manner
presently  conducted or presently proposed by Seller to be conducted. Except

(f)   any agreement relating to confidentiality, nonsolicitation or non-
competition  (whether the Business is subject to or the beneficiary of such 
obligations);

 



 

(g)   any agreement under which the Business is or may become obligated to
pay any  severance, change of control, profit sharing, success bonuses or
similar  payments or special compensation;

 



 

(h)   any employment, consulting, publishing, independent contractor, agency,
dealer,  distributor, sales representative, marketing, commission or other

The  Assumed Contracts and Assumed  Leases are legally valid and binding and
in full force and effect with respect  to the Seller and, to the Seller\'s
knowledge, with respect to the other parties  thereto and would not  if
performed in accordance with their terms, violate any applicable law, rule, 
regulation, order, judgment, or permit. Neither the Seller nor, to  the
Seller\'s knowledge, any of the other parties to any of the Assumed
Contracts  or Assumed Leases are in default or breach thereof, and the Seller
has no  written notice or, or to Seller\'s knowledge, any oral notice of any
claimed  breach, or of the occurrence of any event which after the passage of
time or  the  giving of notice or both would constitute a breach by any
party to any Assumed  Contract or Assumed Lease. Except as set forth on
Schedule 6.02, none  of the rights of the Business under any Assumed Contract
or Assumed Lease will  be impaired in any respect by the consummation of the
transactions contemplated  by this Agreement and the assignment to Purchaser.
The Seller has  delivered to the Purchaser correct and complete copies of all
Assumed Contracts  and Assumed Leases.

(b)   Except as set forth in Schedule 6.11, (i) there have been no Claims
relating  to  products designed, manufactured, produced or sold by the
Seller with respect  to  the Business, or services rendered by the Seller
with respect to the Business  which are presently pending or which, to the
Seller\'s knowledge, are threatened,  or which have been asserted in writing
or commenced against the Seller within  the three years prior to the date
hereof, in which a party thereto either  requested injunctive relief (whether
temporary or permanent) or alleged damages  in excess of $100,000 (whether or
not covered by insurance) and (ii) the  products of the Business have been
designed, manufactured and produced so as  to  meet and comply with all
laws, rules, regulations and standards and contractual  obligations currently
in effect. The Business has no liability (and, to the  knowledge of the
Seller, there is no reasonable basis for) arising out of any  injury to any
individuals or property as a result of the design, manufacture,  ownership,
sale, possession, or use of any product designed, manufactured,  sold, 
licensed, leased or delivered by the Business. Schedule 6.11 hereto sets

under all  licenses and permits shall continue to be in full force and effect
after the  consummation of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement.
No  Claim or proceeding is pending or, to the Seller\'s knowledge,
threatened  regarding the revocation or limitation of any such governmental
license or  permit and there is no basis or grounds for any such revocation
or  limitation.

 



 

6.13   Taxes.

 



 

(a)   The following definitions will apply for purposes of this Agreement:

 



 

(i)   "Tax" or "Taxes"  means taxes  and similar charges, fees, duties or

(c)   Set forth on Schedule 6.13 is a list of each jurisdiction in which the
Seller  files Returns with respect to the Business and the type of Return
filed. Within  the last five years, no claim has been made by an authority in
a jurisdiction  where the Seller does not file Returns with respect to the

jurisdiction, and, to the  Seller\'s knowledge, there is no basis for any
such claim to be made. There  are  no Encumbrances with respect to Taxes
upon any of the Purchased Assets. The  Seller has not waived any statute of
limitations in respect of Taxes of the  Business or agreed to any extension
of time with respect to a Tax assessment  or  deficiency or filing a Return
with respect to the Business. No closing  agreements, private letter rulings,
technical advice memoranda or similar  agreements or rulings relating to
Taxes have been entered into or issued by  any  governmental authority with

mandated by COBRA).  Each Employee Benefit Plan that is a Welfare Plan that
is a "group health plan"  within the meaning of Code Section 5000 has been
operated in material compliance  with the applicable plan document, COBRA and
ERISA. Neither the execution and  delivery of this Agreement nor the

compensation, excess parachute payment (within the meaning of  Section 280G
of the Code), forgiveness of indebtedness or otherwise)  becoming due to any
director or any employee of the Business under any Employee  Benefit Plan or

or to the  knowledge of the Seller, threatened against or affecting the
Business.

 




 

 

 

 

 

 

17  

 

 

 

 


 

(b)   The Business is not bound by any court, administrative agency,
tribunal,  commission or board decree, judgment, decision, arbitration
agreement or  settlement relating to collective bargaining agreements,
conditions of  employment, employment discrimination or attempts to organize
a collective  bargaining unit which in any case may adversely affect the
Business or the  Purchased Assets. The Seller has no written notice or, to
the Seller\'s  knowledge, other notice of any employment discrimination,
safety or unfair  labor  practice or other employment-related investigation,
claim or allegation against  the Seller with respect to the Business or to
the Seller\'s knowledge, any set  of  facts which would reasonably be
expected to constitute a basis for such an  action.

 



 

(c)   The Seller has provided the Purchaser all of the written employment

6.16   Intangible  Assets.

 



 

(a)   Schedule 6.16 contains a true and complete list of all of the
Seller\'s  patents, trademarks, trade names, service marks, copyrights and
licenses thereof  and all corresponding registrations, pending applications
and applications  to be  filed therefor. Seller is the owner or valid
licensee of all right,  title and interest in and to the Assigned
Intellectual Property Rights, free  and  clear of all Encumbrances. No
licenses, sublicenses, covenants or  agreements have been granted or entered
into relating to any of the Assigned  Intellectual Property Rights. The
Business and the use of its  products have not and do not infringe,
misappropriate or otherwise make any  unlawful or unauthorized use of any
patents, trademarks, trade names,  copyrights, licenses, intangible assets or
intellectual property rights of  others and, to Seller\'s knowledge, there
exists no basis to make any such  claims. The Assigned Intellectual Property
Rights are all of the  intellectual property necessary for the operation of
the Business as it is  currently conducted. There are no inquiries,
investigations or Claims  or litigation challenging or threatening to
challenge the Business\' right,  title  and interest with respect to its
ownership, continued use and right to preclude  others from using any such
Assigned Intellectual Property Rights. All  Assigned Intellectual Property
Rights are valid and enforceable and there are  no  equitable defenses to
enforcement based on any act or omission of the  Seller. To the Seller\'s
knowledge, no other person is infringing on  the Assigned Intellectual
Property Rights. All registered Assigned  Intellectual Property Rights have
been properly registered, all pending  registrations and applications have
been properly made and filed and all  annuity, maintenance, renewal and other
fees relating to registrations or  applications are current. Set forth on
Schedule 6.16 are complete and  correct lists of: (i) all royalties or other
consideration in excess of  $50,000 for the ten  month period ended March
31, 2008 that the Business pays for the right to use  any Intellectual
Property rights of others (other than commercially available  off-the-shelf
software) and (ii) all agreements or arrangements (whether oral  or 
written) pursuant to which the Business guarantees or has committed to pay 
royalties or other consideration of at least $100,000 a year for the right 
to  use any Intellectual Property rights of others (other than commercially 
available off-the-shelf software).

(b)   Upon consummation of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement,
Purchaser  shall receive the right, title and interest in and to all tangible
and  intangible property rights existing in the Assigned Intellectual
Property  Rights. All the Assigned Intellectual Property Rights are
transferable to  Purchaser, and upon consummation of the transactions
contemplated by this  Agreement, all Assigned Intellectual Property Rights
will be available for  Purchaser on the same terms after Closing. Seller has
developed the Assigned  Intellectual Property Rights entirely through its own
efforts and for its own  account (or has received a valid assignment of
rights), other than licensed  Assigned Intellectual Property Rights. All
Assigned Intellectual Property Rights  that have been created by any
independent contractor or other third party for  Seller have been fully
assigned to Seller, other than the Assigned Intellectual  Property Rights
owned by independent contractors or third parties and licensed  to Seller
pursuant to the license agreements listed Schedule 6.16. Seller is  not  in
default under any of the license agreements listed or required to be listed 
on Schedule 6.16. Schedule 6.16 sets forth a list of all transfer fees and 
other  restrictions on the transfer or assignment of any Assigned
Intellectual Property  Rights including, but not limited to, the license
agreements set forth on  Schedule 6.16. Seller has at all times used

or  received by or on behalf of the Business claiming any violation or
alleged  violation of any law, ordinance, code, rule or regulation or

6.18   Certain  Transactions. Except as set forth on Schedule 6.18,  during
the three years prior to the date hereof, the Seller has not, with  respect
to the Business, directly or indirectly, had any transaction or  agreement
with any of the Seller\'s shareholders, officers or directors, or  their 
affiliates, except for remuneration for services performed on behalf of the 
Seller. Except as set forth on Schedule 6.18, with respect to  the Business,
the Seller does not owe any amount to, or have any outstanding  contract with
or commitment to, any of the Seller\'s shareholders, directors,  officers,
employees or consultants (other than compensation for current services  not
yet due and payable and reimbursement of expenses arising in the ordinary 
course of business), and none of such person owes any amount to the Seller 
with  respect to the Business. No part of the property or assets of any of 
the Seller\'s shareholders, officers, directors or employees or any direct
or  indirect subsidiary or affiliate of any of the Seller\'s shareholders is
used  by  the Seller in the Business. Except as set forth on  Schedule
6.18, following the Closing, no shareholder of the Seller or other  affiliate

description of all policies of  insurance presently in effect with respect to
the Business and/or the Purchased  Assets (the "Insurance Policies"). To
Seller\'s knowledge, all such  policies are valid, outstanding and
enforceable policies. No written  notice of cancellation or termination has
been received by the Seller with  respect to any such policy. All premiums
currently payable or  previously due on the Insurance Policies have been
paid. The Seller  has not received written notice from any of its insurance
carriers that any  insurance premiums relating to the Insurance Policies will
be increased in  the  future outside of the ordinary course, that any
insurance coverage provided  by  the Insurance Policies will not be
available to the Seller in the future on  substantially the same terms as now
in effect or that any historical limits  have  been materially impaired or
exhausted. The Seller has previously made  available to the Purchaser
complete copies of each of the Insurance  Policies.

 



 

6.20   Accounts  Receivable. All accounts receivable of the Business
reflected  on the Financial Statements and those existing as of the Closing
Date represent  valid claims for bona fide, arms length sales of goods and
services actually  made by the Seller in the ordinary course of its business.
As of the  date of this Agreement, all such accounts receivable are
collectible in the  ordinary course of business using normal collection
practices of the Seller  at  the aggregate recorded amounts thereof, net of
the reserves included in final  Closing Net Working Capital, and none of such
accounts receivable is subject  to  any set off or counterclaim or is in
dispute, in amounts which in the aggregate  are in excess of the reserves
included in final Closing Net Working  Capital. Schedule 6.20 sets forth an
aging schedule of the  accounts and notes receivable of the Business as of

8.   Covenants and  Agreements of Purchaser. Purchaser hereby covenants and agrees  that:

 



 

8.01   Record  Retention. For a period of three years following the
Closing  Date, Purchaser agrees to maintain in a reasonably accessible place
the books  and records delivered by Seller hereunder, to provide Seller and
its  representatives reasonable access to such books and records during
normal  business hours and to provide copies of such books and records to
Seller or  its  representatives for use solely in connection with any tax or
financial reporting  or filing obligations. Purchaser agrees to notify Seller
prior to  disposing of any such books and records and, upon request made
within  60 days after receipt of such notice, to deliver such books and
records to  Seller at Seller\'s expense.

 



 

8.02   Confidentiality. Purchaser  acknowledges that all information
provided to any of it and its affiliates,  agents and representatives by
Seller, or any of Seller\'s affiliates,  predecessors, agents and
representatives is subject to the terms of the  Confidentiality Agreement
dated February 27, 2008 between Purchaser and Seller  (the "Confidentiality
Agreement").

 



 

8.03   Efforts to  Perform. Purchaser shall use its commercially
reasonable  efforts to satisfy the covenants set forth in this Section 8 and
the conditions  precedent set forth in Section 10 in a timely and
expeditious  manner.

 



 

8.04   Employees.

 



 

(a)   Purchaser shall have no obligation to hire any employee of Seller,
other than  the employees listed on Schedule 8.04 who continue as employees
of Seller  as of the Closing Date and who accept employment with the
Purchaser (the "Hired  Seller Employees"). Purchaser shall make an offer of
employment to  the employees listed on Schedule 8.04 at a salary or wage rate
comparable to  that of similarly situated employees of Purchaser.

 



 

(b)   Except for accruals reflected on the final Closing Net Working
Capital  Statement, Seller shall pay all wages of the Hired Seller Employees
accrued  through and including the Closing Date and shall be responsible for,
in  accordance with the terms and conditions of such benefits, all employee
benefits  of the Hired Seller Employees earned or accrued through the Closing
Date.  Nothing in this Agreement shall obligate Purchaser to continue the
employment  or  benefits of any Hired Seller Employee after the Closing
Date, and except for  accruals reflected on the final Closing Net Working
Capital Statement, Purchaser  shall not assume or be obligated to pay,
perform or discharge any obligations  under any employee benefit plan,
contract or arrangement existing on or prior  to  the Closing Date (which
shall be deemed Excluded Liabilities). In the event  Purchaser terminates any
Hired Seller Employee during the six month period  immediately following
Closing without cause, Purchaser shall pay such Hired  Seller Employee
severance in accordance with the severance policy set forth  on  Exhibit
8.04(b). Any obligations or liabilities relating to any employee of  Seller
who is not a Hired Seller Employee (whether arising prior to or after 
Closing) shall be deemed Excluded Liabilities. No person not a party to this 
Agreement shall be entitled to any rights of enforcement or otherwise under 
this  Agreement.

 


 

 

 

 

 

 

23  

 

 

 

 


 

(c)   As of the Closing Date, all Hired Seller Employees shall be deemed to
have  resigned their employment with Seller and shall cease active
participation  in  the Employee Benefit Plans. Purchaser shall not assume
any of the Employee  Benefit Plans. Purchaser shall cause its group health
plans to cover the Hired  Seller Employees who were covered by the Seller\'s
group health plan on the  Closing Date in accordance with the terms of those
plans and the requirements  of  applicable law. To the extent permitted by
law and the terms of Purchaser\'s  plans, Purchaser shall give credit to the
Hired Seller Employees for all service  with Seller and its affiliates for
all purposes under Purchaser\'s benefit plans  including, without limitation,
Purchaser\'s vacation, severance, short-term  disability and life insurance
plans.

 



 

(d)   If the Hired Seller Employees become participants in a retirement plan
that  is  qualified under Section 401(a) of the Code, contains a cash or
deferral feature  under Section 401(k) of the Code and which is sponsored
either by Purchaser  or  any affiliate of Purchaser (the "Purchaser 401(k)
Plan"), Purchaser shall cause  the Purchaser 401(k) Plan to accept, by way of
direct rollover, transfers of  account balances of such Hired Seller
Employees from any retirement plan that  any Seller sponsors or participates
in which is qualified under Section 401(a)  of the Code and contains a cash
or deferral feature under Section 401(k) of  the  Code. To the extent
permitted by law, Purchaser shall give credit to the Hired  Seller Employees
for all service with Seller and its affiliates for all purposes  under the
Purchaser 401(k) Plan.

 



 

8.05   Prepaid  Expenses. Purchaser also agrees to cooperate, at Seller\'s 
expense, with any reasonable request made by any Seller concerning the 
reimbursement or utilization of any prepaid expenses and deposits of Seller 
with  third parties which prepaid expense or deposit is an Excluded  Asset.
In the event that any payment is received by Purchaser in  respect of any
prepaid expense or deposit that is an Excluded Asset such payment  shall be
deemed to be held by Purchaser in trust for Seller, and Purchaser  shall 
promptly remit any such payment to Seller.

 



 

9.   Covenants and  Agreements of Seller. Seller hereby covenants and agrees  that:

 



 

9.01   Notice of  Developments. From time to time prior to the Closing,
Seller  shall promptly supplement or amend the Disclosure Schedule with
respect to  any  matter of which Seller has or acquires knowledge which, if
existing or occurring  on the date this Agreement is executed, would have
been required to be set  forth  or described in the Disclosure Schedule. Any
such supplement or  amendment to the Schedules shall be deemed to cure any
breach of any  representation or warranty made by Seller in this Agreement to
the extent of  the  information explicitly set forth in such supplement or
amendment and Buyer  shall  not be entitled to seek indemnification with
respect to losses, damages, costs  or expenses relating to the subject matter
of any such disclosed  information. However, any such supplement or amendment
shall not be  deemed to satisfy or cure any failure to satisfy the condition
set forth in  Section 11.01 below.

 



 

9.02   Access to Books  and  Records After Closing. For a period of three
years following  the Closing Date, Seller agrees to maintain in a reasonably
accessible place  any  books and records not delivered to Purchaser
hereunder relating to the Business,  including historical financial
information of the Business and any other  information of the Business in
connection with any financial statements or  financial information provided
in Section 9.14, to provide Purchaser and its  representatives reasonable
access to such books and records during normal  business hours and to provide
copies of such books and records to Purchaser  or  its representatives.
Seller agrees to notify Purchaser prior to  disposing of any such books and
records and, upon request made within  60 days after receipt of such notice,
to deliver such books and records to  Purchaser at Purchaser\'s expense.

 




 

 

 

 

 

 

24  

 

 

 

 


 

9.03   Further  Assurances. From and after the Closing, Seller and
Purchaser  agree that in the event any further action is necessary or
desirable to carry  out the purposes of this Agreement, each such party will
take such further  action (including the execution and delivery of such
further instruments and  documents) as the other party reasonably may
request, at the sole cost and  expense of the requesting party. From and
after the Closing, Seller  will use reasonable efforts to assist in the
transfer to Purchaser of the  ongoing operation of the Business.

 



 

9.04   Exclusivity. In  consideration of the substantial expenditures of
time and expense to be  undertaken by Purchaser in connection with the
consummation of the transactions  contemplated by this Agreement between the
date hereof and the earlier to occur  of (i) the Closing or the (ii) Outside
Termination Date, neither Seller, nor  its  officers, directors, employees,
agents, representatives, advisors or attorneys  shall solicit offers or
expressions of interest from any other party to directly  or indirectly
acquire the Purchased Assets or the Business, enter into or  continue
negotiations regarding the terms of any agreement for the sale of  the 
Purchased Assets or the Business, permit access to the Purchased Assets or 
the  Business or provide any information to any third party for purposes of
reviewing  the Purchased Assets or the Business or its operations in
connection with the  sale of the Purchased Assets or the Business, or enter
into any oral or written  agreements to directly or indirectly sell the
Purchased Assets or the Business  or engage anyone to enter into such an
agreement.

 



 

9.05   Remittance of  Cash. Seller also agrees to cooperate, at Purchaser's
expense,  with any reasonable request made by Purchaser concerning the
collection of  any  Account Receivable from any customer of the Business. If
any payment  is received by Sellers in respect of any Account Receivable or
other amount  due  to Purchaser, such payment shall be deemed to be held by
Sellers in trust for  Purchaser, and Sellers shall promptly remit (in no
event less frequently than  weekly) any such payment to Purchaser, along with
any account or other  identifying information received by Seller with respect
to such amount.

 



 

9.06   Operation of  Business. In connection with the Purchased Assets and
the  Business, Seller will cause the Business to be conducted only in the
ordinary  course consistent with past practice and will use its commercially
reasonable  efforts to maintain and preserve intact its business organization
and its  relationship with employees, customers, suppliers and other business
relations  and will not engage in any practice, take any action, or enter
into any  transaction outside the ordinary course of business. Without
limiting  the generality of the foregoing, the Seller, with respect to the
Business,  will  not engage in any practice, take any action, or enter into
any transaction  of  the sort described in Section 6.05. Further, Seller
will not  modify, amend or extend any license agreements with respect to the
Business  without Purchaser\'s prior written consent.

 



 

9.07   Full  Access. Seller will permit representatives of the Purchaser
to  have full access at all reasonable times, and in a manner so as not to
interfere  with the normal business operations of Seller or the Business, to
all premises,  properties, personnel, books, records (including tax records),
contracts, and  documents of or pertaining to the Business, unless such
access is restricted  by  the terms of such agreements.

 




 

 

 

 

 

 

25  

 

 

 

 


 

9.08   Efforts to  Perform. Seller shall use its commercially reasonable
efforts  to satisfy the covenants set forth in this Section 9 and the
conditions  precedent set forth in Section 11 of this Agreement in a timely
and  expeditious manner.

Business that  have been shipped by Seller to customers prior to Closing
shall at any time  after Closing be returned to Seller or Purchaser on
account of shortages,  defects, breach of warranty or return policies of
Seller, or Seller or Purchaser  shall receive a notice of a shortage or
defect or a breach of warranty or unused  products are returned, Purchaser,
at Purchaser\'s reasonable discretion and  after  notice to Seller, may
issue a credit or refund to such customer on account  of  such goods, or
repair or provide appropriate warranty service for such product;  provided,
however, any voluntary credit, refund, repair or warranty service  shall be
conducted consistent with the prior practice of the Business after 
consultation with the Seller and; provided, further, that Seller shall not 
be  obligated for the cost of any return of unsold products above any
contractual  limitations applicable to such returns. Seller shall promptly
refund  the cost of any credit, refund or cost of warranty service or repair
work under  this Section 9.09 to Purchaser to the extent it exceeds the
reserves for  warranty and returns included in the final Closing Net Working
Capital  Statement.

 

 

9.10   Third Party  Consents. To the extent that any Purchased Asset is
not  assignable without the consent of another person or entity, and to the
extent  such consent is not obtained prior to Closing, this Agreement shall,
subject  to  the rights of any such person or entity, constitute an
assignment of Seller\'s  interest in such Purchased Asset. Seller agrees, at
its expense, to  use its commercially reasonable efforts to obtain the
consent of such other  person or entity to the assignment of any such
Purchased Asset to the  Purchaser. If any such consent shall not be obtained,
Seller shall  provide, or make arrangement to provide, Purchaser, in a manner
reasonably  approved by Purchaser, the benefits and obligations of the
relevant Purchased  Asset, including enforcement at the cost of Seller and
for the account of the  Purchaser of any and all rights of Seller against the
other person or  entity.

$2,000,000 of any transfer fees, extension fees or similar charges necessary 
to  transfer or extend the license agreements of the Business to Purchaser 
hereunder, and Purchaser shall pay any such transfer fees, extension fees or 
charges in excess of $2,000,000. Seller shall not agree to pay any  transfer
fees, extension fees or similar charges that are not specifically  set 
forth in the respective license agreements without Purchaser\'s prior
written  consent. Any transfer fees, extension fees or similar charges that 
are due by Seller pursuant to this Section 9.11 and not paid to the
respective  licensor prior to Closing shall be deducted from the Purchase
Price and paid  by  Purchaser post-Closing. Without the prior written
consent of  Purchaser, Seller shall not modify or amend the terms of any
license  agreement.

cost  and  expense, to actively and in good faith defend and resolve any
claims or  litigation involving the "Poingo" trademark including, but not
limited to,  pursing the pending declaratory judgment action filed by Seller

Purchaser  for any and all Losses pursuant to Section 13.01(c) arising out of
any claims,  litigation or settlement by or with Leapfrog involving the

after the Poingo License Term. Purchaser shall  indemnify Seller pursuant to
Section 12.01(c) for any Losses which first arise  after the Poingo License
Term based upon Purchaser\'s use of the "Poingo"  trademark. Seller shall
not, in the defense of such claim or  litigation, consent to entry of any
judgment or enter into any settlement  involving the "Poingo" trademark,
except in either case with written consent  of  Purchaser, which consent
shall not be unreasonably withheld or unless such  judgment or settlement
does not restrict in any way Purchaser\'s use of the  "Poingo" trademark and
does not cause Purchaser to incur any Loss (including  any  royalties).
Seller shall furnish Purchaser, in reasonable detail, all  information Seller
may have with respect to any such claim or litigation and  shall make
available to Purchaser and its representatives all records and other  similar
materials which are reasonably required in the defense of such claim  or 
litigation. During the Poingo License Term, Seller shall grant  Purchaser an
exclusive right and license to use the "Poingo" trademark pursuant  to the
terms of the license agreement agreed upon by Purchaser and Seller prior  to

Closing a licensing fee of $100,000 under the Poingo License  Agreement. Upon
expiration of the Poingo License Agreement, Purchaser  shall have the option
to purchase the "Poingo" trademark for $10 or no longer  use the "Poingo"
trademark. If Purchaser elects to purchase the  "Poingo" trademark, at
Purchaser\'s request, Seller shall continue to pursue  the  declaratory
judgment action to conclusion at Seller\'s cost and expense.

Reader." Seller shall be responsible for any and all Losses,  including
punitive damages, arising out of any claims, litigation or settlement 
involving "My First Story Reader" that relate to the period prior to the
Closing  Date, including any royalty payments and Purchaser shall only be
responsible  for  any royalties due to the inventor of "My First Story
Reader" that first arise  after the Closing Date provided that Purchaser
conducts the Business with  respect to "My First Story Reader" in a manner
that is substantially consistent  with that conducted by Seller prior to
Closing. In the event  Purchaser does not conduct the Business with respect
to "My First Story Reader"  in a manner that is substantially consistent with
that conducted by Seller  prior  to Closing, Purchaser shall be responsible
for any Losses relating to "My First  Story Reader" that first arise after
the Closing Date to the extent such Losses  result from Purchaser\'s change
to the "My First Story Reader"  Business. Seller shall not, in the defense of
such claim or  litigation, consent to entry of any judgment or enter into any
settlement  involving the "My First Story Reader", except in either case with
written  consent of Purchaser, which consent shall not be unreasonably 
withheld. Seller shall furnish Purchaser, in reasonable detail, all 
information Seller may have with respect to such claim or litigation and

registered public accounting firm or the SEC has comments or  questions on
such information after the Closing, Seller will (and will cause  its 
independent registered public accounting firm to) assist and cooperate with 
Parent to resolve any such comments or questions and take such reasonable 
actions with respect to such information as are necessary for Parent to
satisfy  its obligations under Regulation S-X, Form 8-K and the other 
applicable rules and regulations of the SEC with respect to the pro forma 
financial information.

 



 

(c)   Seller will cooperate with any reasonable requests of Purchaser and
Parent  in  connection with Parent\'s compliance with applicable laws

regulations of the SEC,  addressing purchase accounting issues and

12.   Indemnification  by  Purchaser.

 



 

12.01  Indemnification. Notwithstanding  the Closing, and regardless of any
investigation made at any time by or on  behalf of Seller or any information
Seller may have, Purchaser on behalf of  itself and its successors hereby
covenants and agrees to indemnify, defend  and  hold Seller, each of
Seller\'s subsidiaries, stockholders, affiliates, officers,  directors,
employees, agents, successors and assigns (Seller and such persons, 
collectively, "Seller\'s Indemnified Persons") harmless from and against any 
demand, claim, damage, liability, loss (which shall exclude any diminution 
in  value other than for the benefit of a third party), cost or expense
(including,  but not limited to, interest, penalties, costs of preparation
and investigation  and the reasonable fees, disbursements and expenses of
attorneys, accountants  and other professional advisors) (collectively,
"Losses"), imposed or incurred  by Seller\'s Indemnified Persons, directly or
indirectly, arising  out of, resulting from or relating to:

 



 

(a)   any inaccuracy in or breach of any representation or warranty of
Purchaser  pursuant to this Agreement in any respect, whether or not
Seller\'s Indemnified  Persons relied thereon or had knowledge thereof,
including certificates,  schedules and documents delivered pursuant hereto;

 



 

(b)   any failure of Purchaser to duly perform or observe any term,
provision,  covenant or agreement to be performed or observed by Purchaser
pursuant to  this  Agreement, the Assignment and Assumption Agreement, the
Intellectual Property  Assignment Agreements, the Escrow Agreement, the
License Agreement, the  Transition Services Agreement or the Noncompetition
Agreements;

 



 

(c)   the Assumed Liabilities; or

 



 

(d)   to the extent such Losses arise out of the inclusion of the S-X
Financial  Statements in RC2 Corporation\'s 8-K filing unless the Loss is the
result of  fraud, willful misconduct or knowing or intentional misstatement
or inaccuracy  by the Seller. This Section 12.01(d) shall not in any way
limit any claim  Purchaser may have under Section 13.01(a) for a breach of
Section 6.03 by  Seller.

 



 

The  obligations of Purchaser to  indemnify and hold Seller\'s Indemnified
Persons harmless as described herein  shall survive Closing and the
consummation of the transactions contemplated  by  this Agreement, as
provided in Section 13.03.

 



 

12.02   Procedures. The  procedural rules set forth in Section 13.02 shall
apply with respect to  indemnification by Purchaser except that the parties\'
respective obligations  under Section 13.02 shall be reversed as appropriate,
and all references  therein to Section 13.01 shall be to Section 12.01.

 




 

 

 

 

 

 

33  

 

 

 

 


 

13.   Indemnification by Seller.

 



 

13.01  Indemnification. Notwithstanding  the Closing, and regardless of any
investigation made at any time by or on  behalf of Purchaser or any
information Purchaser may have, Seller, on behalf  of  itself and its
successors, hereby covenant and agree to indemnify, defend and  hold
Purchaser, each of Purchaser\'s subsidiaries, shareholders, affiliates, 
officers, directors, employees, agents, successors and assigns (Purchaser
and  such persons, collectively, "Purchaser\'s Indemnified Persons") harmless
from  and  against any Losses imposed on or incurred by Purchaser\'s
Indemnified Persons,  directly or indirectly, arising out of, resulting from
or relating to:

 



 

(a)   any inaccuracy in or breach of any representation or warranty of Seller
pursuant  to this Agreement in any respect, whether or not Purchaser\'s
Indemnified Persons  relied thereon or had knowledge thereof, including
certificates, schedules  and  documents delivered pursuant hereto;

 



 

(b)   any failure of Seller to duly perform or observe any term, provision,
covenant  or agreement to be performed or observed by Seller pursuant to this
Agreement,  the Assignment and Assumption Agreement, the Intellectual
Property Assignment  Agreements, the Escrow Agreement, the License Agreement,
the Transition Services  Agreement or the Noncompetition Agreements; and

 



 

(c)   the Excluded Liabilities.

 



 

The  obligations of Seller to indemnify  and hold Purchaser\'s Indemnified
Persons harmless as described herein shall  survive Closing and the
consummation of the transactions contemplated by this  Agreement, as provided
in Section 13.03.

 



 

13.02  Procedures. Purchaser\'s  Indemnified Persons shall give Seller
prompt notice of any written claim,  demand, assessment, action, suit or
proceeding to which the indemnity set forth  in this Section 13 applies. If
the document evidencing such  claim or demand is a court pleading, Purchaser
shall give such notice, including  a copy of such pleading, within five days
of receipt of such pleading,  otherwise, Purchaser shall give such notice
within 30 days of the date it  receives written notice of such claim. Failure
to give timely notice  of a matter which may give rise to an indemnification
claim shall not affect  the  rights of Purchaser\'s Indemnified Persons to
collect such Loss from Seller  so  long as such failure to so notify does
not materially adversely affect Seller\'s  ability to defend such Loss
against a third party.

 




 

 

 

 

 

 

34  

 

 

 

 


 

If  Purchaser\'s Indemnified Persons  request for indemnification arises
from the claim of a third party, Seller  may,  at their option, assume
control of the defense of any such claim, or any  litigation resulting from
such claim. Failure by Seller to notify  Purchaser\'s Indemnified Persons of
its election to defend a complaint by a  third  party within 10 days shall
be a waiver by Seller of their right to respond  to such complaint and within
30 days after notice thereof shall be a waiver  by Seller of their right to
assume control of the defense of such claim or  action. If Seller assumes
control of the defense of such claim or  litigation resulting therefrom,
Seller shall take all reasonable steps necessary  in the defense or
settlement of such claim or litigation resulting therefrom  and  Seller
shall hold Purchaser\'s Indemnified Persons, to the extent provided in  this
Section 13, harmless from and against all Losses arising out of or  resulting
from any settlement approved by Seller or any judgment in connection  with
such claim or litigation. Notwithstanding Seller\'s assumption of  the
defense of such third-party claim or demand, Purchaser\'s Indemnified
Persons  shall have the right to participate in the defense of such third-
party claim  or  demand at their own expense. Seller shall not, in the
defense of such  claim or litigation, consent to entry of any judgment
against any of Purchaser\'s  Indemnified Persons or enter into any
settlement, involving any of Purchaser\'s  Indemnified Persons, except in
either case with written consent of Purchaser\'s  Indemnified Persons, which
consent shall not be unreasonably  withheld. Purchaser\'s Indemnified Persons
shall furnish Seller in  reasonable detail all information Purchaser\'s
Indemnified Persons may have  with  respect to any such third-party claim
and shall make available to Seller and  their representatives all records and
other similar materials which are  reasonably required in the defense of such
third-party claim and shall otherwise  cooperate with and assist Seller in
the defense of such third-party  claim.

 



 

If  Seller does not assume control of  the defense of any such third-party
claim or litigation resulting therefrom,  Purchaser\'s Indemnified Persons
may defend against such claim or litigation  in  such manner as it may
reasonably deem appropriate, and Seller shall indemnify  Purchaser\'s
Indemnified Persons from any Loss indemnifiable under  Section 13.01 incurred
in connection therewith. Seller shall not  be obligated to Purchaser\'s
Indemnified Persons for any settlement or consent  to  a stay of judgment
made by any Purchaser\'s Indemnified Person if such settlement  or consent is
entered into without the prior written consent of Seller which  consent shall
not be unreasonably withheld or delayed.

 



 

If  Purchaser\'s Indemnified Persons  should have a claim against Seller
that does not involve a third party claim,  the Purchaser\'s Indemnified
Persons shall deliver a notice of such claim to  Seller. If Seller notifies
the Purchaser\'s Indemnified Persons that  it does not dispute the claim
described in such notice or fails to notify the  Purchaser\'s Indemnified
Persons within 30 days after delivery of such notice  by  the Purchaser\'s
Indemnified Persons whether Seller disputes the claim described  in such
notice, the Loss in the amount specified in the Purchaser\'s Indemnified 
Persons\' notice will be conclusively deemed a liability of Seller and
Seller  shall pay the amount of such Loss to the Purchaser\'s Indemnified
Persons on  demand. If Seller have timely disputed their liability with
respect  to such claim, a senior executive of each of Seller and the
Purchaser\'s  Indemnified Persons with full negotiating authority will
proceed in good faith  to negotiate a resolution of such dispute, and if not
resolved through the  negotiations of such executives within 60 days after
the delivery of the  Purchaser\'s Indemnified Persons\' notice of such claim,
such dispute shall be  resolved fully and finally by a court of competent
jurisdiction.

13.03  Survival  of Indemnification;  Maximum Liability. No demand or claim
for indemnification  pursuant to Section 12.01(a) or Section 13.01(a) shall
be made after  eighteen (18) months following the Closing Date, except as 
follows: (a) claims for indemnification for any inaccuracy in or  breach of
the representations and warranties contained in Sections 6.01 
(Organization), 6.02 (Authorization), 6.08 (Title), 7.01 (Corporate 
Organization), 7.02 (Authorization of Agreement) or 7.03 (No Conflict) may 
be  made at any time after the Closing Date until barred by the applicable
period  of  limitation under federal and state laws relating thereto; (b)
claims for  indemnification for any inaccuracy in or breach of the
representations and  warranties contained in Section 6.09 (Sufficiency of
Assets) or 6.16  (Intangible Assets) may be made up to the third anniversary
of the Closing  Date;  and (c) claims for indemnification for any inaccuracy
in or breach  representations and warranties contained in Section 6.13
(Taxes) may be  brought at any time until the underlying tax obligation is
barred by the  applicable period of limitation under federal and state laws
relating thereto  (as such may be extended by waiver). In no event shall the
aggregate  indemnity payments made by Seller under Section 13.01(a) exceed
$15,000,000 (the "Cap");  provided, however the Cap shall not apply to
breaches of Sections 6.01  (Organization), 6.02 (Authorization), 6.08
(Title), 6.13 (Taxes) or claims  for  fraud.

 



 

13.04  Basket. No  indemnification shall be payable by Seller pursuant to
Section 13.01(a)  unless the aggregate Losses incurred by all of Purchaser\'s
Indemnified Persons  pursuant to Section 13.01(a) exceed $1,300,000 and then
only for the excess  over  such amount (the "Basket"). Notwithstanding the
foregoing, the Basket  shall not apply to breaches of Sections 6.01
(Organization), 6.02  (Authorization), 6.08 (Title), 6.13 (Taxes) or claims
for  fraud.

 



 

13.05   Materiality. Any  qualifications in the representations, warranties
and covenants with respect  to  a material adverse effect, materiality,
material or similar terms will not  have  any effect with respect to the
determination of the existence of any breach  of  any representation or
warranty, the calculation of the amount of any Losses  or  the application
of the Basket pursuant to this Section 13 and such  qualifiers in any such
representation or warranty shall be disregarded and  all  claims for
indemnification under this Section 13 shall be determined as if  such  term
were not present in such representation or warranty.

 



 

13.06  Remedies  Exclusive. From and after the Closing Date, the 
indemnification obligations of Purchaser and Seller under Section 12 or 13 
shall  constitute the sole and exclusive remedies (other than a remedy for
actual  fraud  or injunctive relief) of Purchaser and Seller, respectively,
for the breach  of  any covenant, agreement, representation or warranty in
this Agreement by the  Purchaser or Seller, as the case may be, and the
Purchaser and Seller shall  not  be entitled to rescission of this Agreement
or to any further indemnification  rights or claims of any nature whatsoever
in respect thereof, whether such  claims or rights are based on tort,
contract or otherwise, all of which  Purchaser and Seller waive and agree not
to pursue.

 



 

13.07  Treatment  of Indemnification  Payments. All indemnification
payments made pursuant to this Section 13  shall be treated by Purchaser and
Seller as an adjustment to the Purchase Price  to the extent permitted by
law.

 




 

 

 

 

 

 

36  

 

 

 

 


 

13.08  Interest  on Late  Payments. Any and all amounts required to be paid
under this  Agreement pursuant to this Section 13 by any party to any other
party shall  accrue interest at the rate of 9% per annum from the date on
which such payment  is required to be made in accordance with this Agreement
through the date on  which such amount is paid in full.

 



 

13.09  Taxes. The  amount of any indemnity provided in Section 12 or 13
shall be reduced (but  not  below zero) by the amount of any net reduction
in cash payments for Taxes  actually realized by the indemnified party as a
result of the Losses giving  rise  to such indemnity claim. If the indemnity
amount is paid prior to the  indemnified party realizing any actual reduction
in cash payments for Taxes  in  connection with the Losses giving rise to
such payment, and the indemnified  party subsequently realizes such actual
reduction in cash payments for Taxes,  then the indemnified party shall pay
to the indemnifying party the amount of  such actual reduction in cash
payments for Taxes (but not in excess of the  indemnification payment or
payments actually received with respect to such  Losses, and only to the
extent that such actual reduction in cash payments  for  Taxes is realized
within three years of the making of such payment to the  indemnified party).
For purposes of the preceding two sentences, the  indemnified party shall be
deemed to have realized an actual reduction in cash  payments for Taxes with
respect to a taxable year if, and to the extent that,  the indemnified
party\'s cumulative liability for Taxes from the Closing Date  through the
end of such taxable year, calculated by excluding any Tax items  attributable
to the Losses from all taxable years, exceeds the indemnified  party\'s
actual cumulative liability for Taxes through the end of such taxable  year,
calculated by taking into account any Tax items attributable to the amount 
of Losses for all taxable years (to the extent permitted by relevant Tax law 
and  treating such Tax items as the last items claimed for any taxable 
year). Any amounts paid or credited to the indemnifying party under  this
Section 13.09 that are later reversed on audit shall be promptly repaid  by 
the indemnifying party to the indemnified party.

 



 

13.10  Insurance. The  amount of any indemnity provided in Section 12 or 13
shall be computed net  of any insurance proceeds actually received by an
indemnified party in  connection with or as a result of any claim giving rise
to an indemnification  claim hereunder (reduced by any retroactive premium
increase and further reduced  by the net present value of any other premium
increase resulting  therefrom). If the indemnity amount is paid prior to the
indemnified  party\'s actual receipt of insurance proceeds related thereto,
and an indemnified  party subsequently receives such insurance proceeds, then
the indemnified party  shall promptly pay to the indemnifying party the
amount of insurance proceeds  subsequently received (net of all related
costs, expenses and other Losses),  but  not more, in the aggregate, than
the indemnity amount paid by the indemnifying  party.

 



 

13.11  Net  of Working Capital  Reserves. No indemnification shall be
payable by Seller  pursuant to Section 13.01 to the extent such Losses are
reserved for, or  otherwise taken into account, in the Closing Net Working
Capital Statement  as  finally determined in accordance with Section 4.04.

14.   Business  Brokers. Seller represents and warrants to Purchaser that,  except for J.P. Morgan Securities Inc., the fees and expenses of which will  be  paid by PIL, neither Seller nor anyone acting on its behalf has made any  commitment or done any other act which would create any liability for any  brokerage, finder\'s or similar fee or commission in connection with the  transactions contemplated by this Agreement. Purchaser represents and  warrants to Seller that, except for Robert W. Baird and Co., the fees and  expenses of which will be paid by Purchaser, neither Purchaser nor anyone acting  on its behalf has made any commitment or done any other act which would create  any liability for any brokerage, finder's or similar fees or commissions in  connection with the transactions contemplated by this  Agreement. Purchaser and Seller hereby indemnify, save and hold each  other harmless from and against claims by any broker or finder for a fee or  expense which is based in any way on an agreement, arrangement or understanding  made or alleged to have been made by them relating to the transactions  contemplated hereby.

 



 

15.   Termination. By  notice given prior to or at the Closing, this Agreement may be terminated as  follows:

 

 

(a)   by mutual consent of Purchaser and Seller;

 

 

(b)   by Purchaser if the Closing has not occurred on or before the 60th day
after  the  date of this Agreement (the "Outside Termination Date"), or such
later date  as  the parties may agree upon, unless Purchaser is in material
breach of this  Agreement;

 

 

(c)   by the Seller if the Closing has not occurred on or before the
Outside  Termination Date, or such later date as the parties may agree upon,
unless  any  Seller is in material breach of this Agreement; or

 

 

(d)   by the Purchaser if any of the SDX License, Poingo License Agreement, 
Noncompetition Agreements, Transition Services Agreement or License
Agreement  are not finalized with 30 days following the date of this
Agreement, unless  Purchaser is in breach of Section 9.15.

 

 

If  this Agreement is terminated  pursuant to this Section 15, all
obligations of the parties under this Agreement  will terminate, except that
the obligations of the parties in this Section  15  and Section 16 will
survive, provided, however, that, if  this Agreement is terminated because of
a breach of this Agreement by the  nonterminating party or because one or
more of the conditions to the terminating  party\'s obligations under this
Agreement is not satisfied as a result of the  other party\'s failure to
comply with its obligations under this Agreement,  the  terminating party\'s
right to pursue all legal remedies will survive such  termination unimpaired.

 

 

16.   Miscellaneous.

 



 

16.01  Amendment  and  Severability. This Agreement may only be amended by
a written  agreement of the parties hereto. If any provision, clause or part

held  invalid, the remainder of this Agreement, or the applications of each
provision,  clause or part under other circumstances, shall not be affected
thereby.

16.02   Waiver. The  failure of Seller or Purchaser to insist, in any one or
more instances, upon  performance of any of the terms or conditions of this
Agreement, shall not  be  construed as a waiver or relinquishment of any
rights granted hereunder or  the  future performance of any such term,
covenant or  condition. Purchaser\'s decision to close this transaction 
notwithstanding its constructive or actual knowledge of the breach by Seller 
of  one or more of its representations, warranties or obligations hereunder
shall  not relieve such parties of their indemnification obligations
hereunder with  respect to such breach; in such case, Purchaser specifically
is relying upon  Seller\'s indemnification obligation, as well as the
underlying representation,  warranty or contractual obligation.

such court, on the state courts  of Illinois located in  Chicago, Illinois
