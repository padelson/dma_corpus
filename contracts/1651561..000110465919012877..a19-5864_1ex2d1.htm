to the Holder Representative an unaudited consolidated balance sheet of the
Company Group (the " _Closing Balance Sheet_ ") as of 11:59 P.M., Pacific

_Closing Statement_ ") setting forth (i) the Closing Date Net Working Capital,
(ii) the Closing Date Indebtedness, (iii) the Holder Expenses, (iv) the
Adjusted Closing Date Cash, and (v) the Closing Consideration calculated based
on the items in the foregoing clauses (i) through (iv). The Closing Balance
Sheet, the Closing Statement, including the Closing Date Net Working Capital,
the Closing Date Indebtedness, the Holder Expenses and the Adjusted Closing
Date Cash shall be prepared in accordance with the Calculation Principles. The
parties agree that the purpose of preparing the Closing Balance Sheet and the
Closing Statement, including the Closing Date Net Working Capital, the Closing
Date Indebtedness, the Holder Expenses and the Adjusted Closing Date Cash and
the related purchase price adjustment contemplated by this _Section 2.8(a)_
is to measure the amount of the Closing Date Net Working Capital, the Closing
Date Indebtedness, the Holder Expenses and the Adjusted Closing Date Cash.
Acquiror shall (i) permit the Holder Representative and its Representatives to
have reasonable access to the books and records and working papers pertaining
to or used in connection with the preparation of the Closing Statement and
Acquirors calculation of the Closing Date Net Working Capital, the Closing
Date Indebtedness, the Holder Expenses and the Adjusted Closing Date Cash and
(ii) provide the Holder Representative reasonable access to Acquirors and the
Surviving Entitys employees and accountants as reasonably requested by the
Holder Representative in connection with its review of the Closing Statement
(subject to customary access agreements as may be required by such auditors);
_provided_ , that, such access will be in a manner that does not interfere
with the normal business operations of Acquiror or the Surviving Entity.

 



 

(b) If the Holder Representative shall disagree with the calculation pursuant
to _Section 2.8(a)_ of the Closing Date Net Working Capital, the Closing Date
Indebtedness, the Holder Expenses or the Adjusted Closing Date Cash, it shall
notify Acquiror of such disagreement in writing, setting forth in reasonable
detail the particulars of such disagreement (and providing all supporting
documentation reasonably necessary for Acquiror to evaluate such
disagreement), within thirty (30) days after its receipt of the Closing
Statement. In the event that the Holder Representative does not provide such a
notice of disagreement within such thirty (30) day period, the Holder
Representative shall be deemed to have accepted the Closing Statement and the
calculation of the Closing Date Net Working Capital, the Closing Date
Indebtedness, the Holder Expenses, the Adjusted Closing Date Cash and the
calculation of Closing Consideration based thereon delivered by Acquiror,
which shall be final, binding and conclusive on all parties (and any other
Person) for all purposes hereunder. In the event any such notice of
disagreement is timely provided, Acquiror and the Holder Representative shall
use commercially reasonable efforts for a period of thirty (30) days (or such
longer period as they may mutually agree) to resolve any disagreements with
respect to the calculations of the Closing Date Net Working Capital, the
Closing Date Indebtedness, the Holder Expenses and the Adjusted Closing Date
Cash; _provided_ , _however_ , that any such calculation not specifically
objected to by the Holder Representative in such notice of disagreement shall
be deemed acceptable and shall be final and binding on the parties (and any
other Person) upon delivery of such notice of disagreement. If, at the end of
such period, they are unable to resolve such disagreements, then BDO USA LLP
(or such other

 



     

 

 



 

independent accounting firm of recognized national standing as may be mutually
selected by Acquiror and the Holder Representative) (the " _Auditor_ ") shall
resolve any remaining disagreements, it being understood that the Auditor
shall be functioning as an expert and not as an arbitrator and shall not have
any authority to interpret any provision of this Agreement. The Auditor shall
be directed to, within thirty (30) calendar days after such submission,
determine and report to Acquiror and the Holder Representative upon the
remaining disputed amounts with respect to the Closing Statement, and such
report shall be final, binding and conclusive on the parties hereto (and any
other Person) and shall constitute an arbitral award upon which a judgment may
be entered in any court having jurisdiction thereof. The Auditor shall be
authorized to resolve only those items remaining in dispute between Acquiror
and the Holder Representative, and such resolution shall be based solely on
the materials submitted by Acquiror and Holder Representative and not on
independent review, and the Auditor (i) shall make no other determination and
(ii) may not assign a value greater than the greatest positive or negative
adjustment requested by a party. The fees and expenses of the Auditor shall be
paid by Acquiror and the Holder Representative (on behalf of the holders of
Units) in the same proportion that the aggregate amount of the items
unsuccessfully disputed or defended, as the case may be, by each (as finally
determined by the Auditor) bears to the total amount of the disputed items.

 



 

(c) The " _Adjustment Amount_ ," which may be positive or negative, shall mean
(i) the Closing Date Net Working Capital _minus_ the Estimated Closing Date
Net Working Capital, _plus_ (ii) the Estimated Closing Date Indebtedness
_minus_ the Closing Date Indebtedness, _plus_ (iii) the Estimated Holder
Expenses _minus_ the Holder Expenses, _plus_ (iv) the Adjusted Closing Date
Cash _minus_ the Adjusted Estimated Closing Date Cash.

 



 

(d) Within three (3) Business Days following the final determination of the
Adjustment Amount in accordance with _Section 2.8(b)_ hereof, Acquiror and
the Holder Representative shall execute joint written instructions to the
Escrow Agent instructing the Escrow Agent to disburse the Working Capital
Escrow Fund as follows:

 



 

(i) if the Adjustment Amount is a positive number (A) the Escrow Agent shall
pay to the Paying Agent, for the account of the former holders of Units (and,
for the avoidance of doubt, other than any Units held by the Company or by
Acquiror, directly or indirectly, as of the Effective Time) the Working
Capital Escrow Fund in accordance with the Distribution Waterfall, and (B)
Acquiror shall pay to the Paying Agent, for the accounts of the former holders
of Units (and, for the avoidance of doubt, other than any Units held by the
Company or by Acquiror, directly or indirectly, as of the Effective Time),
cash in an amount equal to the Adjustment Amount (as finally determined); and

 



 

(ii) if the Adjustment Amount is a negative number, (A) the Escrow Agent shall
pay to Acquiror out of the Working Capital Escrow Fund an amount equal to the
absolute value of the Adjustment Amount (not to exceed the Working Capital
Escrow Fund), and (B) if the absolute value of the Adjustment Amount is less
than an amount equal to the Working Capital Escrow Fund, the Escrow Agent
shall pay to the Paying Agent for the accounts of the former holders of Units
the balance of the Working Capital Escrow Fund in accordance with the
Distribution Waterfall.

 



     

 

 



 

2.9 **Paying Agent**.

 



 

(a) As soon as practicable after the Closing Date, the Paying Agent shall mail

properly completed and duly executed Letter of Transmittal and any other
documentation required thereby, including a properly completed and duly
executed Voting and Support Agreement, a holder of record of outstanding Units
shall be entitled to receive a check or wire transfer representing the cash

(b) Promptly following the date which is twelve (12) months after the Closing
Date, Acquiror shall instruct the Paying Agent to deliver to Acquiror by wire
transfer of immediately available funds to an account or accounts specified by
Acquiror the undistributed portion of the Closing Consideration (including any
interest or other income resulting from the investment of the Closing
Consideration), Letters of Transmittal, Voting and Support Agreements, Option
Cancellation Agreements and other documents in its possession relating to the
transactions contemplated hereby. Thereafter, each former holder of Units and
former holder of Options entitled to Non-Employee Option Consideration who has
not delivered a Letter of Transmittal, Voting and Support Agreement and Option
Cancellation Agreement, as applicable, may deliver such Letter of Transmittal,
Voting and Support Agreement and Option Cancellation Agreement to Acquiror and
(subject to applicable abandoned property, escheat and similar laws) receive
in consideration therefor, and Acquiror shall promptly pay, the portion of the
Closing Consideration deliverable in respect thereof as determined in
accordance with this _Article II_ without any interest thereon. None of

of, or as a result of, the Merger, or (b) otherwise to carry out the purposes
of this Agreement, then, subject to the terms and conditions of this

limiting the foregoing, neither the

has bound the RandW Insurance Policy.

 



 

 **ARTICLE VII** ** 
JOINT COVENANTS**

 



 

7.1 **Confidentiality**. At the Effective Time, the Confidentiality Agreement
shall terminate and be of no further force or effect. The Holder
Representative shall not, and shall cause its Representatives not to, directly
or indirectly, for a period of five (5) years after the Closing Date, without
the prior written consent of Acquiror, disclose to any third party (other than
each other and their respective representatives) any confidential or
proprietary information related to the Surviving Entity and its Subsidiaries;
_provided_ , that the foregoing restriction shall not (a) apply

 



     

 

 



 

to any information (i) generally available to, or known by, the public (other
than as a result of disclosure in violation of this _Section 7.1_) or (ii)
independently developed by the Holder Representative without reference to or
use of the applicable confidential or proprietary information, or (b) prohibit
any disclosure required by Law so long as, to the extent legally permissible
and feasible, the Holder Representative provides Acquiror with reasonable
prior notice of such disclosure and a reasonable opportunity to contest such
disclosure. The Holder Representative shall be responsible for any breach of
this _Section 7.1_ by its Representatives.

 



 

7.2 **Press Releases**. Neither of the Company nor any of its Affiliates
shall, without the approval of Acquiror, issue any press releases or otherwise
make any public statements or other announcements with respect to the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement. Acquiror shall allow the Company
reasonable time to review and comment on (which comments shall be considered
in good faith) any press release or announcement or public statements Acquiror
makes in respect to the transactions contemplated by this Agreement in advance
of such release or issuance. Notwithstanding the foregoing, nothing herein
shall be deemed to prohibit the parties from making any public disclosure that
Acquiror or the Company, as applicable, deems necessary or appropriate under
applicable Law or by obligations pursuant to any listing agreement with any
national securities exchange or stock market, in which case the party required
to make the release or announcement shall allow the other party reasonable
time to review and comment on (which comments shall be considered in good
faith) such release or announcement in advance of such issuance.

 



 

7.3 **Tax Matters**.

 



 

(a) Responsibility for Filing Tax Returns.

 



 

(i) Holder Representative shall prepare or cause to be prepared, and the
parties hereto shall cooperate to timely file or cause to be timely filed
(taking into account any extensions validly obtained), all Flow-Through Tax
Returns for Pre-Closing Tax Periods that are due after the Closing Date (the "
_Pre-Closing Flow-Through Tax Returns_ "). Each Pre-Closing Flow-Through Tax
Return shall be prepared on a basis consistent with the last previous similar
Tax Return except as required by applicable Law; _provided_ , _however_ , to
the maximum extent permitted by applicable Law, all Transaction Deductions
will be treated as properly allocable to the Pre-Closing Tax Period of the
Company. Holder Representative will provide to Acquiror each Pre-Closing Flow-
Through Tax Return together with such additional information regarding such
Pre-Closing Flow-Through Tax Return as may be reasonably requested by
Acquiror, for review, comment and approval (such approval not to be
unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed) at least forty-five (45) days
prior to the filing of such Pre-Closing Flow-Through Tax Return (or, if such
due date is within 60 days following the Closing Date, as promptly as
practicable following the Closing Date). Holder Representative shall cooperate
in good faith with Acquiror in resolving any issues Acquiror identifies with
such Pre-Closing Flow-Through Tax Return, although the Holder Representative
will have the final decisions as to any issues. The parties agree that the
Pre-Closing Flow-Through Tax Returns shall designate Al Babbington as the
"partnership representative" within the meaning of Section 6223(a) of the Code
(the " _Partnership Representative_ ").

 



 

(ii) Acquiror shall prepare, or cause to be prepared, and timely file, or
cause to be timely filed, all Tax Returns of the Company and its Subsidiaries
(other than Pre-Closing Flow-Through Tax Returns) that relate to any Pre-
Closing Tax Period (including any taxable period that includes but ends after
the Closing Date) and that are first due after the Closing

 



     

 

 



 

Date (the " _Acquiror Prepared Returns_ "). Each Acquiror Prepared Return
shall be prepared on a basis consistent with the last previous similar Tax
Return except as required by applicable Law. Acquiror will provide to the
Holder Representative each Acquiror Prepared Return that could reasonably be
expected to give rise to (A) claims against the Indemnity Escrow Fund by the
Indemnified Parties or (B) any Tax liability or Tax reporting obligation for
holders of Units as of prior to the Effective Time, together with such
additional information regarding such Acquiror Prepared Return as may be
reasonably requested by the Holder Representative, for review, comment and
approval (such approval not to be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or
delayed) at least forty-five (45) days prior to the filing of such Acquiror
Prepared Return (or, if such due date is within 60 days following the Closing
Date, as promptly as practicable following the Closing Date). Acquiror shall
cooperate in good faith with the Holder Representative in resolving any issues
the Holder Representative identifies with such Acquiror Prepared Return,
although the Company will have the final decisions as to any issues.

 



 

(b) _Post-Closing Events_. Following the Effective Time, Acquiror will not,
and will not cause or permit any of its Affiliates (including the Company and
its Subsidiaries) to, (i) except for Pre-Closing Flow-Through Tax Returns or
Acquiror Prepared Returns prepared and filed in accordance with _Section
7.3(a)_, file or amend any Tax Returns of the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries for a Pre-Closing Tax Period, (ii) with respect to Pre-Closing
Flow-Through Tax Returns or Acquiror Prepared Returns prepared and filed in
accordance with _Section 7.3(a)_, after the date such Tax Returns are filed
pursuant to _Section 7.3(a)_, amend any such Tax Return, (iii) make or change
any Tax election or change any method of accounting that has retroactive
effect to any Tax Return of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries for a Pre-
Closing Tax Period, or (iv) agree to extend or waive the statute of
limitations with respect to Taxes of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries
for a Pre-Closing Tax Period, in each such case except (A) if such filing or
amendment could not reasonably be expected to reduce amounts payable from the
Indemnity Escrow Fund to, or result in any Tax liability or Tax reporting
obligation for, holders of Units as of prior to the Effective Time, or (B)
with the Holder Representatives prior written consent (not to be unreasonably
withheld, conditioned or delayed). Acquiror will not, and will not permit the
Company and its Subsidiaries to, cause the Company or any of its Subsidiaries
to incur any Taxes on the Closing Date after the Closing outside the ordinary
course of business (other than as explicitly contemplated by this Agreement).
For the avoidance of doubt, this _Section 7.3(b)_ shall not limit the
requirements in _Section 7.3(d)(iii)_ nor limit Acquiror or any of its
Affiliates (including the Company and its Subsidiaries) from entering into a
voluntary disclosure agreement with a Governmental Authority with respect to
Sales Tax Liabilities.

 



 

(c) _Cooperation_. Each of the parties hereto shall cooperate fully, as and to
the extent reasonably requested by the other party, in connection with the
preparation and filing of Tax Returns in accordance with _Section 7.3(a)_, as
well as in any audit, litigation or other proceeding with respect to Taxes.
Such cooperation shall include the retention and (upon the other partys
request) the provision of records and information which are reasonably
relevant to any such audit and making employees available on a mutually
convenient basis to provide additional information and explanation of any
material provided hereunder. The parties hereto agree (i) to retain all books
and records with respect to Tax matters of the Company and its Subsidiaries
relating to any taxable period beginning before the Closing Date until the
expiration of the applicable statute of limitations of the respective taxable
periods, and to abide by all record retention agreements entered into with any
taxing authority, and (ii) to give the other party

 



     

 

 



 

reasonable written notice prior to transferring, destroying or discarding any
such books and records and if the other party so requests, Acquiror, the
Company or the Holder Representative, as the case may be, shall allow the
other party to take possession of such books and records.

 



 

(d) _Tax Contests_.

 



 

(i) Acquiror will provide prompt notice to the Holder Representative upon
receipt by Acquiror or any of its Affiliates of notice of any pending or
threatened Tax audits, examinations, assessments or other proceeding that
relate any Tax for which any holder of Units prior to the Effective Time may
be liable (including pursuant to claims against the Indemnity Escrow Fund)
(such audit, examination, assessment or other proceeding, a " _Tax Contest_
").

 



 

(ii) With respect to any Tax Contest relating to a taxable period ending on or
before the Closing Date that is subject to indemnification from the Indemnity
Escrow Fund (if the amount of Taxes that could reasonably be expected to be
payable as a result of such Tax Contest does not exceed the then remaining
funds in the Indemnity Escrow Fund) or that relates to a Flow-Through Tax
Return for a Pre-Closing Tax Period, the Holder Representative will have the
sole right to control the conduct of such Tax Contest (including by employing
counsel of its choice at the expense of the holders of Units prior to the
Effective Time); _provided_ , that: (A) the Holder Representative will keep
Acquiror reasonably informed concerning the progress of such Tax Contest, (B)
the Holder Representative will provide Acquiror copies of all correspondence
and other documents relevant to such Tax audit or administrative or court
proceeding, (C) the Holder Representative will not settle such Tax audit or
administrative or court proceeding without the prior written consent of
Acquiror, which consent will not be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or
delayed, and (D) Acquiror will have the right to participate in the defense of
any such Tax Contest, at its own expense, separate from the counsel employed
by the Holder Representative.

 



 

(iii) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement, in the event
a Tax audit, examination, assessment or other proceeding that relates to Tax
results in any "imputed underpayment" within the meaning of Section 6225 of
the Code for any Pre-Closing Tax Period, the Company shall, and the Holder
Representative and Acquiror shall cause the Company to, take such action as is
required to ensure that neither the Company nor Acquiror is required to pay
any portion of such imputed underpayment.

 



 

(iv) With respect to any Tax Contest not described in _Section 7.3(d)(ii) _
(including with respect to any Tax Contest not relating to a Flow-Through Tax
Return where the amount of Taxes that could reasonably be expected to be
payable as a result of such Tax Contest exceeds the amount remaining in the
Indemnity Escrow Fund or that Holder Representative does not elect to control)
Acquiror shall have the right to control the conduct of such Tax Contest;
provided, however, that (A) Acquiror will keep the Holder Representative
reasonably informed concerning the progress of such Tax Contest, (B) Acquiror
will provide the Holder Representative copies of all correspondence and other
documents relevant to such Tax audit or administrative or court proceeding,
(C) Acquiror will not settle such Tax audit or administrative or court
proceeding without the prior written consent of the Holder Representative,
which consent will not be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed, and
(D) the Holder Representative will have the right to participate in the
defense of any such Tax Contest, at the expense of the Company

 



     

 

 



 

Indemnifying Parties, separate from the counsel employed by Acquiror. To the
extent any provisions in _Section 10.4_ are inconsistent with this _Section
7.3(d)_ with respect to any Tax Contest, this _Section 7.3(d)_ shall control.

 



 

(e) _Tax Classification of the Transaction; Allocation of Purchase Price_.

 



 

(i) The parties to this Agreement agree that, for U.S. federal and applicable
state and local income Tax purposes, the purchase of the Units pursuant to
this Agreement shall be treated in accordance with Situation #2 in Rev. Rul.
99-6, 1999-1 C.B. 432 such that (i) with respect to the holders of Units, as a
disposition of their Units and (ii) with respect to Acquiror, a deemed
acquisition of all the assets and assumption of all of the liabilities of the
Company and its Subsidiaries (other than the assets and liabilities of
Prescribe Wellness International Corp) (the " _Intended Tax Treatment_ "), and
the parties shall prepare all Tax books and records and report the purchase
and sale on all U.S. federal and applicable state and local income Tax Returns
consistent with the Intended Tax Treatment.

 



 

(ii) For all Tax purposes, the parties to this Agreement agree that the
entirety of the amounts paid to the holders of Units in respect of their Units
in accordance with the Distribution Waterfall shall be allocated to their
Units, and none shall be treated as compensation, and no party shall take any
action or filing position inconsistent with the foregoing.

 



 

(iii) Within sixty (60) days following the final determination of the
Adjustment Amount, Acquiror shall prepare and deliver (or cause to be prepared
and delivered) to the Holder Representative a draft schedule allocating the
purchase price (as determined for U.S. federal and applicable state and local
income tax purposes, including assumed liabilities and any other relevant
items or adjustments) among the assets deemed acquired by Acquiror in
accordance with the Intended Tax Treatment for the purposes of determining the
Tax consequences of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement (the "
_Purchase Price Allocation_ "). Acquiror shall revise the draft Purchase Price
Allocation as necessary to reflect adjustments to the Closing Consideration
required by this Agreement, which Acquiror shall deliver to the Holder
Representative within thirty (30) days following the date of such adjustment.
If the Holder Representative disagrees with the Purchase Price Allocation
delivered by Acquiror (including any revisions thereto), the Holder
Representative may, within thirty (30) days after delivery of such Purchase
Price Allocation (or any revision thereto), deliver a written notice to
Acquiror to such effect, specifying those items as to which the Holder
Representative disagrees and setting forth the Holder Representatives
proposed allocation. If the Holder Representative fails to timely and duly
deliver such notice of disagreement, then the Purchase Price Allocation as
delivered by Acquiror pursuant to this _Section 7.3(e)(iii)_ shall be final
and binding on the parties to this Agreement. If the Holder Representative
timely and duly delivers such notice of disagreement, then Acquiror and the
Holder Representative shall negotiate in good faith to reach agreement on the
disputed items or amounts and the allocation to the extent so agreed shall be
the final Purchase Price Allocation.

 



 

(1) If Acquiror and Holder Representative agree on a final Purchase Price
Allocation, the parties will report the allocation of the purchase price among
the assets of Company and its Subsidiaries (other than the assets of Prescribe
Wellness International Corp) in a manner consistent with the final Purchase
Price Allocation and will act in accordance

 



      

 

 



 

with the final Purchase Price Allocation in the preparation and timely filing
of all Tax Returns (including, with respect to Acquiror, filing Form 8594 with
Acquirors federal income Tax Returns for the taxable year that includes the
Closing Date and any other forms or statements required by the Code,
Regulations, the Internal Revenue Service or any applicable state or local
Governmental Authority) and in any audit or examination, and prepare all Tax
books, records and filings in a manner consistent with the Purchase Price
Allocation (as finalized), and will not take any position contrary thereto.
The parties shall revise their Tax Returns and all Tax books, records and
filings as necessary to reflect such revised Purchase Price Allocation. If any
Governmental Authority disputes the Tax treatment pertaining to the Purchase
Price Allocation (or any revision to the Purchase Price Allocation), the party
receiving notice of the dispute shall promptly notify the other party of such
dispute and the parties shall cooperate in good faith in responding to such
dispute in order to preserve the effectiveness of the Purchase Price
Allocation.

 



 

(2) If Acquiror and Holder Representative cannot reach agreement on a final
Purchase Price Allocation, the respective parties shall be entitled to file
all Tax Returns and prepare all Tax books, records and filings reflecting
their own determination of how the Purchase Price Allocation should have been
prepared, as calculated by each party in its complete discretion.

 



 

(f) _Transfer Taxes_. All transfer, documentary, sales, use, stamp,
registration, value added, filing, recording and other such Taxes and fees
(including any penalties and interest) incurred in connection with the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement (collectively, " _Transfer Taxes_
") will be paid 50% by Acquiror and 50% by the Company Indemnifying Parties
when due, and Acquiror and the Company Indemnifying Parties will, at their own
expense, file all necessary Tax Returns and other documentation with respect
to such Transfer Taxes and, if required by applicable Law, the applicable
party will, and will cause its Affiliates to, join in the execution of any
such Tax Returns and other documentation.

 



 

(g) _Tax Sharing Agreements_. All Tax sharing, Tax indemnity and Tax
allocation agreements or similar agreements (other than Ordinary Commercial
Agreements) with respect to or involving the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries shall be terminated as of the Closing Date and, after the Closing
Date, none the Company or any of its Subsidiaries shall be bound thereby or
have any liability thereunder.

 



 

(h) _No Amendments or Restatements_. Acquiror and its Affiliates (including on
or after the Closing Date, the Company) shall not amend the Existing Operating
Agreement with respect to a pre-Closing taxable period (or portion thereof).

 



 

(i) _Straddle Period Taxes_. For all purposes of this Agreement, including for
the avoidance of doubt _Section 3.15(c)_, with respect to any taxable period
beginning on or before and ending after the Closing Date (" _Straddle Period_
") the amount of Taxes allocable to the portion of the Straddle Period ending
on the Closing Date shall be deemed to be: (i) in the cases of Taxes imposed
on a periodic basis, the amount of such Taxes for the entire period (or, in
the case of such Taxes determined on an arrears basis, the amount of such
Taxes for the immediately preceding period) multiplied by a fraction, the
numerator of which is the number of calendar days in the Straddle Period
ending on and including the Closing Date and the denominator of which is the
number of calendar days in the entire relevant Straddle Period and (ii) in the
case of Taxes not

 



     

 

 



 

described in (i) above (such as franchise Taxes, payroll Taxes, Taxes that are
based upon or related to income or receipts, based upon occupancy or imposed
in connection with any sale or other transfer or assignment of property (real
or personal, tangible or intangible)), the amount of any such Taxes shall be
determined as if such taxable period ended as of the end of the Closing Date.

 



 

(j) _Partnership Representative_. The Partnership Representative shall be
entitled to reimbursement from each holder of Units, severally and not
jointly, for all reasonable expenses, disbursements and advances (including
fees and disbursements of its counsel, experts and other agents and
consultants) incurred by the Partnership Representative in such capacity, and
to indemnification from each holder of Units, severally and not jointly,
against any loss, liability, claim, damage, fee, fine cost, judgment, amount
paid in settlement or expenses arising out of actions taken or omitted to be
taken in its capacity as the Partnership Representative (except for those
arising out of the Partnership Representatives gross negligence or willful
misconduct), including the costs and expenses of investigation and defense of
claims, fees, disbursements and costs of counsel and other skilled
professionals (collectively, " _Partnership Representative Expenses_ "). Such
Partnership Representative Expenses may be recovered first, from the Holder
Representative Expense Fund, second, from any distribution of the Indemnity
Escrow Fund otherwise distributable to the holders of Units at the time of
distribution, and third, directly from the holders of Units.

holders of Units in accordance with the Existing Operating Agreement and
effective as of the Effective Time, executing a Voting and Support Agreement,
a Letter of Transmittal or participating in the conversion or cancellation, as
applicable, of the Companys outstanding equity interests, and without further
action of any such holders, each holder of Units shall be deemed to have
irrevocably constituted or appointed the Holder Representative as the
representative, and by execution of this Agreement, the Holder Representative
hereby accepts such appointment, to act on behalf of holders of the Units as
their exclusive agent and attorney in-fact, with full power of substitution,
to act in their name, place and stead in connection with the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement and the Escrow Agreement. The power of attorney
granted in this _Section 9.1_ by each holder of Units and the powers,
immunities, and rights to indemnification granted to the Holder Representative
Group (i): are coupled with an interest and shall be irrevocable, (ii) may be
delegated by the Holder Representative and shall survive the death,
bankruptcy, liquidation or incapacity of any holder of Units and be binding on
any successor thereto, and (iii) shall survive the delivery of an assignment
by any holder of units of the whole or any fraction of his, her or its
interest in the Indemnity Escrow Fund. No bond shall be required of the Holder
Representative.

 



     

 

 



 

Acquiror, Merger Sub, and following the Effective Time, the Surviving Entity,
is entitled to conclusively and absolutely, without inquiry, rely on the
actions of the Holder Representative taken on behalf of the holders of the
Units.

 



 

9.2 **Authority and Rights of the Holder Representative; Limitations on
Liability**.

 



 

(a) The Holder Representative shall have such powers and authority as are
necessary to carry out the functions assigned to it under this Agreement and
the Escrow Agreement; _provided_ , _however_ , that the Holder Representative
shall have no obligation to act on behalf of the holders of Units, except as
expressly provided herein, in the Escrow Agreement and in the Holder
Representative Engagement Agreement, and for purposes of clarity, there are no
obligations of the Holder Representative in any ancillary agreement, schedule,
exhibit or the Company Disclosure Schedule. The Holder Representative shall be
entitled to: (i) rely upon the Distribution Waterfall, (ii) rely upon any
signature believed by it to be genuine, and (iii) reasonably assume that a
signatory has proper authorization to sign on behalf of the applicable holder
of Units or other party. All actions taken by the Holder Representative under
this Agreement, the Escrow Agreement or the Holder Representative Engagement
Agreement shall be binding upon each holder of Units and such holders of
Units successors as if expressly confirmed and ratified in writing by such
holder of Units, and all defenses which may be available to any holder of
Units to contest, negate or disaffirm any action of the Holder Representative
taken in good faith under this Agreement, the Escrow Agreement, or the Holder
Representative Engagement Agreement are waived.

 



 

(b) The Holder Representative may resign at any time; provided that the Holder
Representative provides the Acquiror prior written notice at least two (2)
Business Days prior to such resignation and such notice designates a
replacement Holder Representative (and holders of the Units acknowledge and
agree that the Acquiror may rely on any such replacement Holder Representative
as though such replacement was the original Holder Representative hereunder).
The immunities and rights to indemnification hereunder shall survive the
resignation of the Holder Representative or any member of the Advisory Group
and the Closing and/or any termination of this Agreement and/or the Escrow
Agreement.

 



 

(c) Certain holders of Units have entered into an engagement agreement (the "
_Holder Representative Engagement Agreement_ ") with the Holder Representative
to provide direction to the Holder Representative in connection with its
services under this Agreement, the Escrow Agreement, and the Holder
Representative Engagement Agreement (such holders of Units, including their
individual representatives, the " _Advisory Group_ "). Neither the Holder
Representative nor its members, managers, directors, officers, contractors,
agents and employees shall have any liability to the Acquiror or the Company
with respect to actions taken or omitted to be taken in its capacity as the
Holder Representative, except from willful violation of applicable Law or
resulting from the Holder Representatives gross negligence or willful
misconduct. Neither the Holder Representative nor its members, managers,
directors, officers, contractors, agents and employees nor any member of the
Advisory Group (collectively, the " _Holder Representative Group_ ") shall
have any liability to the holders of Units with respect to actions taken or
omitted to be taken in its capacity as the Holder Representative, except from
willful violation of applicable Law or resulting from the Holder
Representatives gross negligence or willful misconduct. The Holder
Representative shall be under no obligation to take any action in its capacity
as the Holder

 



     

 

 



 

Representative, unless the Holder Representative is holding funds delivered to
it under this _Section 9.2(c)_ and/or has been provided with other funds,
security or indemnities which, in the sole determination of the Holder
Representative, are sufficient to protect the Holder Representative against
the costs, expenses and liabilities which may be incurred by the Holder
Representative in taking such action. The Holder Representative shall be
entitled to engage such counsel, experts and other agents and consultants as
it shall deem necessary in connection with exercising its powers and
performing its function hereunder and (in the absence of bad faith on the part
of the Holder Representative) shall be entitled to conclusively rely on the
opinions and advice of such Persons. The Holder Representative Group shall be
entitled to reimbursement from each holder of Units, severally and not
jointly, for all reasonable expenses, disbursements and advances (including
fees and disbursements of its counsel, experts and other agents and
consultants) incurred by the Holder Representative Group in such capacity, and
to indemnification from each holder of Units, severally and not jointly,
against any loss, liability, claim, damage, fee, fine cost, judgment, amount
paid in settlement or expenses arising out of actions taken or omitted to be
taken in its capacity as the Holder Representative (except for those arising
out of the Holder Representative Groups gross negligence or willful
misconduct), including the costs and expenses of investigation and defense of
claims, fees, disbursements and costs of counsel and other skilled
professionals, and in connection with seeking recovery from insurers
(collectively, " _Holder Representative Expenses_ "). Such Holder
Representative Expenses may be recovered first, from the Holder Representative
Expense Fund, second, from any distribution of the Indemnity Escrow Fund
otherwise distributable to the holders of Units at the time of distribution,
and third, directly from the holders of Units.

 



 

(d) At the Effective Time, Acquiror shall deliver cash to the Holder
Representative in an amount equal to $250,000 (the " _Holder Representative
Expense Fund_ ") to be held by the Holder Representative to cover and
reimburse the Holder Representative Expenses incurred by the Holder
Representative for its obligations in connection with this Agreement, the
Escrow Agreement, the Holder Representative Engagement Agreement and the
transactions contemplated hereby or thereby. The Holder Representative is not
providing any investment supervision, recommendations or advice and shall have
no responsibility or liability for any loss of principal of the Holder
Representative Expense Fund other than as a result of its gross negligence or
willful misconduct. The Holder Representative is not acting as a withholding
agent or in any similar capacity in connection with the Holder Representative
Expense Fund and has no tax reporting or income distribution obligations. The
holders of Units will not receive any interest on the Holder Representative
Expense Fund and assign to the Holder Representative any such interest.
Subject to Advisory Group approval, the Holder Representative may contribute
funds to the Holder Representative Expense Fund from any consideration
otherwise distributable to the holders of Units. The Holder Representative
shall disburse to the Paying Agent and/or Acquiror, as applicable, for further
distribution to the holders of Units, the remaining balance of the Holder
Representative Expense Fund in accordance with the Distribution Waterfall, as
and when determined by the Holder Representative in its sole discretion.

 



     

 

 



 

 **ARTICLE X** ** 
INDEMNIFICATION**

 



 

10.1 **Survival**.

 



 

(a) The parties, intending to modify any applicable statute of limitations,
agree that the representations and warranties in this Agreement and the
representations, and the rights and obligations of the parties under this
_Article X_ with respect thereto, shall survive the Closing until, and shall
terminate at 11:59 P.M. Pacific Standard Time on the date that is the twelve
(12) month anniversary of the Closing Date (the " _Rep Survival Date_ "), and
the right of the Indemnified Parties to seek indemnification in respect of a
breach of a representation and warranty hereunder shall expire on the Rep
Survival Date. Notwithstanding the foregoing, any claims asserted in good
faith with reasonable specificity (to the extent known at such time) and in
writing by notice from an Indemnified Party to the Holder Representative prior
to the Rep Survival Date shall not thereafter be barred by the expiration of
the relevant representation or warranty and such claims shall survive until
finally resolved pursuant to this _Article X_. For the avoidance of doubt,
the parties acknowledge and agree that the foregoing limitation shall not
limit any recovery of Acquiror under the RandW Insurance Policy.

 



 

(b) The parties further agree that all covenants and agreements of the parties
contained in this Agreement shall survive in accordance with their respective
terms until the date on which such covenant is fully performed (such survival
date in each case, the " _Applicable Covenant Survival Date_ " and together
with the Rep Survival Date, the " _Applicable Survival Date_ "), and the right
of the Indemnified Parties to seek indemnification in respect of a covenant
and agreement hereunder (other than the representations and warranties in the
Agreement) shall expire on Applicable Covenant Survival Date. Notwithstanding
the foregoing, any claims asserted in good faith with reasonable specificity
(to the extent known at such time) and in writing by notice from an
Indemnified Party to the Holder Representative prior to the Applicable
Covenant Survival Date shall not thereafter be barred by the expiration of the
relevant covenant or agreement and such claims shall survive until finally
resolved pursuant to this _Article X_.

 



 

10.2 **Indemnification of Acquiror Parties**.

 



 

(a) Subject to the terms and limitations in this _Article X_, from and after
the Closing, each holder of Units (the " _Company Indemnifying Parties_ "),
severally and not jointly, based upon each holders Pro-Rata Portion, shall
indemnify Acquiror and its Affiliates, including the Company and their
respective Representatives (collectively, the " _Indemnified Parties_ ") in
respect of any loss, Liability, Tax, fine, penalty or damage including
reasonable out-of-pocket fees, costs and expenses of counsel and other
professionals and reasonable out-of-pocket expenses of investigation
(collectively, a " _Loss_ ") that such Indemnified Party suffers as a result
of:

 



 

(i) any breach or inaccuracy of any representation or warranty made by the
Company in _Article III_ of this Agreement, other than any breach or
inaccuracy arising solely and directly from any Sales Tax Liabilities (a "
_Warranty Breach_ ");

 



 

(ii) any breach by the Holder Representative of any covenant or agreement to
be performed hereunder;

 



 

(iii) any inaccuracy in the Distribution Waterfall;

 



 

(iv) any payments made by the Surviving Entity or its Affiliates to the
Indemnified Persons in respect of a claim covered by _Section 6.1(b)_ in
excess of the amounts

 



     

 

 



 

recovered under the DandO Tail Policy; provided that, any claims in respect of
an Indemnified Person shall be first satisfied by recovery under the DandO Tail
Policy; and

 



 

(v) an equity holder or former equity holder of the Company, or any other
Person seeking to assert: (A) ownership rights of any Companys Units or
equity interests; (B) any rights of a holder of Units in respect of (i) the
amount of consideration he, she or it is entitled to receive in exchange for
any securities of the Company under the Companys Existing Operating Agreement
or other organizational documents or (ii) any rights to notice or vote with
respect to the transactions contemplated by this Agreement; (C) any claim that
he, she or its equity interests were wrongfully repurchased by the Company;
(D) any claim that he, she or it is entitled to receive any consideration in
exchange for any securities of the Company other than as expressly set forth
in the Distribution Waterfall; or (E) any claim that any equity interests of
the Company were not properly issued or authorized.

 



 

10.3 **Limitations**. Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary:

 



 

(a) Even if an Indemnified Party would otherwise be entitled to
indemnification for a Loss with respect to any Warranty Breach pursuant to
this Agreement, such Indemnified Party shall not be indemnified for such Loss
except to the extent the aggregate amount of all Losses for Warranty Breaches
eligible for indemnification pursuant to _Section 10.2(a)(i)_ exceeds on a
cumulative basis an amount equal to $750,000 (the " _Deductible_ "), and then
the Indemnified Parties shall be entitled to indemnification only for Losses
suffered or incurred by the Indemnified Parties with respect to any Warranty
Breach in excess of the Deductible; _provided_ , _however_ , that the
Deductible and the provisions of this _Section 10.3(a)_ shall not apply to
breach or inaccuracy of a Fundamental Representation.

 



 

(b) From and after the Closing (but subject to the provisions of this _Article
X_), any indemnification of the Indemnified Parties pursuant to _Section
10.2_ (to the extent not recovered under the RandW Insurance Policy) shall be
effected, first, by a payment made from the Indemnity Escrow Fund, in
accordance with the terms of the Escrow Agreement. There shall be no
indemnification recovery pursuant to the Escrow Fund Indemnification under
_Section 10.2_ unless written notice of a possible claim for indemnification
specifying in reasonable detail those provisions alleged to have been breached
is given by the claiming Indemnified Party to the Holder Representative on or
before the Applicable Survival Date, it being understood that so long as such
written notice is given on or prior to the Applicable Survival Date, such
representations and warranties, covenants and agreements shall continue to
survive solely with respect to such notified matter until such notified matter
is resolved in accordance with this _Article X_.

 



 

(c) Subject to _Section 10.3(d)_, in no event shall the Company Indemnifying
Parties be obligated to indemnify the Indemnified Parties (i) under _Section
10.2(a)(i)_, from any source other than the Indemnity Escrow Fund, (ii) under
_Sections 10.2(a)(ii)-(v)_ , in any amount in excess of the Merger
Consideration paid to such Company Indemnifying Party pursuant to this
Agreement, with such indemnification obligations several and not joint among
the Company Indemnifying Parties and (iii) for any Sales Tax Liabilities.

 



     

 

 



 

(d) Notwithstanding any provision of this Agreement, nothing in this Agreement
shall limit any claims made by an Indemnified Party for Fraud (including the
Deductible and the caps set forth in _Section 10.3(c)_).

 



 

10.4 **Procedures for Third Party Claims**.

 



 

(a) In the event that any claim or demand, or other circumstance or state of
facts which could give rise to any claim or demand, for which a Company
Indemnifying Party may be liable to an Indemnified Party hereunder is asserted
or sought to be collected by a third party (a " _Third Party Claim_ "), the
Indemnified Party shall deliver to Holder Representative, as soon as
practicable, written notice thereof, specifying, to the extent then known by
the Indemnified Party, the amount of such claim, the nature and basis of such
claim and all relevant facts and circumstances relating thereto, including
copies of all notices and documents (including court papers) received by the
Indemnified Party relating to the Third Party Claim; _provided_ , _however_ ,
that no delay on the part of the Indemnified Party in notifying the Holder
Representative shall relieve the Company Indemnifying Parties of any Losses
hereunder, except to the extent that the defense of any third party Action has
been materially prejudiced by the Indemnified Partys failure to give such
notice. Thereafter, the Indemnified Party shall keep the Holder Representative
reasonably informed on a current basis as to any changes or developments with
respect to the foregoing, including by providing copies of all notices and
documents (including court papers) from time to time received by the
Indemnified Party relating to the Third Party Claim.

 



 

(b) If a Third Party Claim is made against an Indemnified Party, the Holder
Representative (on behalf of the Company Indemnifying Parties) shall be
entitled to participate in the defense thereof and may upon written notice
given to the Indemnified Party within 60 days of the receipt by the Holder
Representative of the notice of such Third Party Claim, assume the defense
thereof and any litigation resulting therefrom with counsel selected by the
Holder Representative; _provided_ , _however_ , that the Holder Representative
shall not be entitled to assume control of such defense if (i) such Third
Party Claim seeks injunctive, equitable or other non-monetary relief, (ii)
such Third Party Claim involves criminal or quasi-criminal allegations, (iii)
such Third Party Claim is asserted directly by or on behalf of a Person that
is a supplier or customer of the Company, its Subsidiaries or the Surviving
Entity, (iv) such Third Party Claim involves Losses in excess of the value of
any remaining amount in the Indemnity Escrow Fund, or (v) the Indemnified
Party has been advised by counsel that an actual conflict of interest between
the Holder Representative and the Indemnified Party, the Indemnified Party
shall have the right to control such defense. If the Holder Representative
assumes such defense, the Indemnified Party shall have the right to
participate in the defense thereof and to employ counsel, at its own expense,
separate from the counsel employed by the Holder Representative, it being
understood, however, that the Holder Representative shall control such
defense. The party controlling the defense of a Third Party Claim shall keep
the other party reasonably advised of the status of such action, suit or
proceeding and the defense thereof and shall consider in good faith
recommendations made by the other party with respect thereto. If the Holder
Representative elects to defend a Third Party Claim, each party shall
cooperate in the defense or prosecution of such Third Party Claim. Such
cooperation shall include the retention and (upon the Holder Representatives
request) the provision to the Holder Representative of records and information
(including those of the Company, if applicable) which are reasonably relevant
to such Third Party Claim, and making employees (including those of the
Company if applicable) available on a mutually convenient basis

 



      

 

 



 

to provide additional information and explanation of any material provided
hereunder. The Holder Representative shall not, without the Indemnified
Partys prior written consent, which shall not be unreasonably withheld,
conditioned or delayed, settle, discharge or compromise any Third Party Claim
or consent to the entry of any judgment. The Indemnified Party shall not be
entitled to indemnification under this _Article X_ with respect to any Third
Party Claim that is settled by the Indemnified Party without the prior written
consent of the Holder Representative, which shall not be unreasonably
withheld, conditioned or delayed.

 



 

10.5 **Procedures for Inter-Party Claims**. In the event that an Indemnified
Party determines that it has a claim for Losses (other than as a result of a
Third Party Claim), the Indemnified Party shall, as soon as practicable, give
written notice thereof to the Holder Representative, specifying the amount of
such claim, the nature and basis of the alleged breach giving rise to such
claim and all relevant facts and circumstances relating thereto; _provided_ ,
_however_ , that no delay on the part of the Indemnified Party in notifying
the Holder Representative shall relieve the holder of Units of any Losses
hereunder, except to the extent that the Holder Representative has been
materially prejudiced by the Indemnified Partys failure to give such notice.
The Indemnified Party shall provide the Holder Representative with reasonable
access to its books and records (including the Companys books and records)
during normal business hours upon reasonable advance notice for the purpose of
allowing the Holder Representative a reasonable opportunity to verify any such
claim for Losses. The Holder Representative shall notify the Indemnified Party
within thirty (30) days following its receipt of such notice if the Holder
Representative disputes the Losses under this _Article X_. If (a) the Holder
Representative does not so notify the Indemnified Party, the claim specified
by the Indemnified Party in such notice shall be conclusively deemed to be a
Losses under this _Article X_, or (b) in the case of any notice in which the
amount of the claim (or any portion of the claim) has been finally determined,
in each case the Holder Representative and the Indemnified Party shall
promptly (but in any event within two (2) Business Days) jointly instruct the
Escrow Agent to pay such amount to the Indemnified Party from the remaining
balance of the Indemnity Escrow Fund and subject to the terms and conditions
of this _Article X_ or, in the case of any notice in which the amount of the
claim (or any portion of the claim) is estimated, on such later date when the
amount of such claim (or such portion of such claim) becomes finally
determined, in accordance with _Section 10.6_ and subject to the terms and
conditions of this _Article X_. If the Holder Representative has timely
disputed the Losses with respect to such claim as provided above, the Holder
Representative and the Indemnified Party shall negotiate in good faith to
resolve such dispute. Promptly following the final determination of the amount
of the Losses which the Indemnified Party has suffered (whether determined in
accordance with this _Section 10.5_ or by a court of competent jurisdiction
pursuant to _Section 11.9_), the Holder Representative and Acquiror shall
jointly instruct the Escrow Agent to pay the amount of such Losses to the
Indemnified Party from the remaining balance of the Indemnity Escrow Fund in
accordance with _Section 10.8_ and subject to the terms and conditions of
this _Article X_.

 



 

10.6 **Determination of Loss Amount**.

 



 

(a) For purposes of determining the amount of any indemnification obligation
to any Indemnified Party for any Losses, appropriate reductions shall be made
to reflect (i) the actual recovery pursuant to any insurance policy (other
than insurance proceeds received pursuant to the RandW Insurance Policy)
received by any Indemnified Party in respect of such Losses (net of

 



     

 

 



 

any deductibles or other expenses and any increase in the applicable
premium/retro-premiums related to the recovery of such proceeds) and (ii) any
other recovery actually received by any Indemnified Party from a third party
pursuant to any reimbursement arrangements, indemnification rights,
contribution agreements, holdback, offset or set-off agreements or similar
arrangements (other than insurance proceeds received pursuant to the RandW
Insurance Policy); _provided_ , _however_ , that the foregoing shall not be
deemed to require an Indemnified Party to seek recovery under any applicable
insurance policies or otherwise prior to making a claim for indemnification
hereunder, except to the extent such claim would be covered by the DandO Tail
Policy. If an indemnification payment pursuant to this _Article X_ is
received by any Indemnified Party, and such Indemnified Party later receives
proceeds of an insurance policy or other such third party payments (other than
insurance proceeds received pursuant to the RandW Insurance Policy), in each
case as described in the immediately preceding sentence, in respect of such
Losses, such Indemnified Party shall promptly notify the Holder
Representative, and promptly, but in any event no later than five (5) Business
Days after delivery of such proceeds, such Indemnified Party shall pay to the
Paying Agent for the accounts of the holder of Units an amount equal to the
aggregate amount of the insurance recovery (net of any deductibles or other
expenses and any increase in the applicable premiums/retro-premiums related to
the recovery of such proceeds) or such other third party payments so as to
avoid a duplication of recovery (but not to exceed the amount for which such
Indemnified Party was previously indemnified for hereunder in respect of such
Losses) (other than insurance proceeds received pursuant to the RandW Insurance
Policy). Notwithstanding the foregoing, for an avoidance of doubt, nothing in
this _Section 10.6(a)_ shall be deemed to permit any Indemnified Party to
recover for Losses from any Company Indemnifying Party to the extent such
Losses are recovered from insurance proceeds received pursuant to the RandW
Insurance Policy.

 



 

(b) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this Agreement, no
Indemnified Party shall be entitled to any recovery in respect of a Loss (or a
part thereof) to the extent the matter underlying the Loss (i) has been taken
into account in the determination of Closing Date Net Working Capital,
Adjusted Closing Date Cash, Closing Date Indebtedness or the Holder Expenses
as finally determined under this Agreement and (ii) such amount actually
resulted in an adjustment to the Closing Consideration.

 



 

10.7 **Payment of Losses**. No later than two (2) Business Days following the
final determination of the amount of any Losses payable to any Indemnified
Party in accordance with this _Article X_, the Holder Representative and
Acquiror shall deliver joint written instructions directing the Escrow Agent
to release to such Indemnified Party, from the account holding the Indemnity
Escrow Fund, the lesser of (i) the amount of such Losses and (ii) the then
remaining balance of the Indemnity Escrow Fund.

 



 

10.8 **Escrow Release**. On the date that is one (1) Business Day following
the twelve (12) months following the Closing Date, the Holder Representative
and Acquiror shall deliver joint written instructions to the Escrow Agent to
release to the Paying Agent, for the accounts of the holder of Units, an
amount equal to the positive difference between (i) the then remaining balance
of the Indemnity Escrow Fund, _minus_ (ii) the amount of all Losses for which
an Indemnified Party has timely made a claim for indemnification pursuant to
_Section 10.2_, _Section 10.4_ and _Section 10.5_, and which claim has not
then been finally determined in accordance with this _Article X_. In the
event any portion of the Indemnity Escrow Fund is not released to the Paying
Agent on the date that is twelve (12) months following the Closing Date as a
result of the reduction in respect

 



     

 

 



 

of the foregoing clause (ii), following the final determination of any of such
outstanding claims and, as applicable, payment in respect thereof in
accordance with and subject to the terms and conditions of this _Article X_,
the Holder Representative and Acquiror shall promptly deliver joint written
instructions directing the Escrow Agent to release to the Paying Agent, for
the accounts of the holder of Units, an amount as determined pursuant to the
first sentence of this _Section 10.8_ (after giving effect to the resolution
and, as applicable, payment of such claim).

 



 

10.9 **Treatment of Indemnity Payments**. Following the Closing, any payment
made pursuant to this _Article X_ shall be treated by the parties as an
adjustment to the purchase price for Tax purposes unless otherwise required by
applicable Law.

 



 

10.10 **Exclusive Remedy**. Each of the parties hereto acknowledges and agrees
that from and after the Closing, the indemnification provisions in this
_Article X_ shall be the exclusive remedy of Acquiror with respect to the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement (except for disputes under
_Section 2.8_, which disputes under _Section 2.8_ will be resolved in
accordance with the dispute resolution mechanism set forth _Section 2.8_);
_provided_ , _however_ , that nothing herein shall preclude any party from
seeking any remedy based upon Fraud. The limitations in this _Section 10.10_
shall not apply with respect to (i) any proceeding seeking equitable relief
for a breach hereof pursuant to _Section 11.1_, or (ii) any claims made
solely under the RandW Insurance Policy.

 



 

 **ARTICLE XI** ** 
MISCELLANEOUS**

 



 

11.1 **Remedies**.

 



 

(a) The parties hereto hereby agree that irreparable damage would occur in the
event that any provision of this Agreement was not performed in accordance
with its specific terms or was otherwise breached, and that money damages or
other legal remedies would not be an adequate remedy for any such damages.
Accordingly, the parties hereto acknowledge and hereby agree that in the event
of any breach by the Company, on the one hand, or Acquiror and Merger Sub, on
the other hand, of any of their respective covenants or obligations set forth
in this Agreement, subject to the provisions and limitations of this _Section
11.1(a)_, the Company, on the one hand, and Acquiror and Merger Sub, on the
other hand, shall be entitled, in addition to all other remedies available
under Law or equity, to an injunction or injunctions to prevent or restrain
breaches of this Agreement by the other (as applicable) under this Agreement,
and to specifically enforce the terms and provisions of this Agreement to
prevent breaches of, or to enforce compliance with, the covenants and
obligations of the other (as applicable) under this Agreement.

 



 

(b) The Company, on the one hand, and Acquiror and Merger Sub, on the other
hand, hereby agrees not to raise any objections to the availability, of the
equitable remedy of specific performance to prevent or restrain breaches or
threatened breaches of this Agreement by the Company, Acquiror or Merger Sub,
as applicable, and to specifically enforce the terms and provisions of this
Agreement to prevent breaches of, or to enforce compliance with, the covenants
and obligations of the Company, Acquiror and Merger Sub, as applicable, under
this Agreement, in each case, in accordance with its terms, conditions and
limitations.

 



     

 

 



 

11.2 **Waiver**. Any party to this Agreement may, at any time prior to the
Closing, waive on its own behalf any of the terms or conditions of this
Agreement or agree on its own behalf to an amendment or modification to this
Agreement by an agreement in writing executed by such party. The waiver by a
party hereto of any breach of any provision of this Agreement shall not
constitute or operate as a waiver of any other breach of such provision or of
any other provision hereof, nor shall any failure to enforce any provision
hereof operate as a waiver of such provision or of any other provision hereof.

 



 

11.3 **Notices**. All notices and other communications among the parties shall

11.4 **Assignment**. No party hereto shall assign this Agreement or any part
hereof without the prior written consent of the other parties, except that (a)
each of Acquiror and Merger Sub may assign all of its respective rights,
duties and obligations hereunder to any of its Affiliates, or in connection
with any disposition or transfer of all or substantially all membership
interests of the Surviving Entity acquired by Acquiror in connection herewith,
without the prior written consent of any other party hereto, and (b) each of
Acquiror and Merger Sub may and, as of and following the Closing, any of the
Surviving Entity, Acquiror, Company and its Subsidiaries may, (i) pledge,
transfer or assign its respective rights hereunder to their financing sources
as collateral security, without the prior written consent of any other party
hereto and (ii) pledge, assign or transfer its rights hereunder (in whole or
in part) in connection with any direct or indirect disposition, pledge,
assignment or transfer of any substantial portion of the equity or assets of
the Surviving Entity or its Subsidiaries; _provided_ that, in each case, that
Acquiror remains liable for the obligations assigned by Acquiror, Merger Sub,
the Surviving Entity, the Company or its Subsidiaries. Any purported
assignment of this Agreement in contravention of this Section shall be null
and void and of no force or effect. Subject to the foregoing, this Agreement
shall be binding upon and inure to the benefit of the parties hereto and their
respective permitted successors and assigns.

 



 

11.5 **Rights of Third Parties**. Except as contemplated by _Section 6.1_,
nothing expressed or implied in this Agreement is intended or shall be
construed to confer upon or give any Person, other than the parties hereto,
any right or remedies under or by reason of this Agreement.

 



 

11.6 **Attorney-Client Privilege. **Each of the parties hereto agrees that any
attorney-client privilege, attorney work-product protection, and the
expectation of client confidence attaching as a result of counsels (whether
external or internal) representation of each member of the Company in
connection with the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, including the
Merger, and all information and documents covered by such privilege or
protection (the " _Covered Materials_ "), shall belong to and be controlled by
the Holder Representative, and not by the Surviving Entity, following the
Closing, and may be waived only by the Holder Representative, and not the
Surviving Entity, and shall not pass to or be claimed or used by Acquiror or
the Surviving Entity. Absent the consent of the Holder Representative, neither
Acquiror nor the Surviving Entity shall have a right to access the Covered
Materials following the Closing and, in the event Acquiror or the Surviving
Entity access Covered Materials in violation of this sentence, such access
will not waive or otherwise affect the rights of the Holder Representative
with respect to the related privilege or protection. Notwithstanding the
foregoing, if a dispute arises between Acquiror or the Surviving Entity, on
the one hand, and a third party other than (and unaffiliated with) any member
of the Company Group, any holder of Units, and the Holder Representative, on
the other hand, after the Closing, then the Surviving Entity may assert such
attorney-client privilege to prevent disclosure to such Covered Materials;
_provided_ , _however_ , that Acquiror and the Surviving Entity may not waive
such privilege without the prior written consent of the Holder Representative.

 



     

 

 



 

11.7 **Conflict of Interest**. If the Holder Representative so desires, acting
on behalf of any unitholder of the Company (collectively the " _Transferors_
") and without the need for any consent or waiver by the Company or Acquiror,
Cooley LLP (" _Cooley_ ") shall be permitted to represent the Transferors
after the Closing in connection with any matter, including anything related to
the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, any other agreements
referenced herein or any disagreement or dispute relating thereto. Without
limiting the generality of the foregoing, after the Closing, Cooley shall be
permitted to represent the Transferors, any of their agents and Affiliates, or
any one or more of them, in connection with any negotiation, transaction or
dispute (including any litigation, arbitration or other adversary proceeding)
with Acquiror, any Transferor or any of their agents or Affiliates under or
relating to this Agreement, any transaction contemplated by this Agreement,
and any related matter, such as claims or disputes arising under other
agreements entered into in connection with this Agreement. Upon and after the
Closing, the Company shall cease to have any attorney-client relationship with
Cooley, except as contemplated by _Section 11.6_ or unless and to the extent
Cooley is specifically engaged in writing by the Company to represent the
Company after the Closing and either such engagement involves no conflict of
interest with respect to the Transferors or the Holder Representative consents
in writing at the time to such engagement. Any such representation of the
Company by Cooley after the Closing shall not affect the foregoing provisions
hereof.

 



 

11.8 **Expenses**. Except as otherwise provided expressly herein, each party
hereto shall bear its own expenses incurred in connection with this Agreement
and the transactions herein contemplated whether or not such transactions
shall be consummated, including all fees of its legal counsel, financial
advisers and accountants.

convenience only and shall not be considered a part of or affect the
construction or interpretation of any provision of this Agreement. This
Agreement may be executed in two or more counterparts, including by facsimile

11.11 **Schedules and Annexes**. The Schedules and Annexes are a part of this
Agreement as if fully set forth herein. All references herein to articles,

this Agreement. The representations and warranties contained in _Article III_
of this Agreement are subject to (a) the exceptions and disclosures set forth
in the part of the Company Disclosure Schedule corresponding to the particular
subsection of _Article III_ in which such representation and warranty
appears; and (b) any exceptions or disclosures explicitly cross-referenced in
such part of the Company Disclosure Schedule by reference to another part of
the Company Disclosure Schedule. No reference to or disclosure of any item or
other matter in the Company Disclosure Schedule shall be construed as an
admission or indication that such item or other matter is material (nor shall

such item or

 



     

 

 



 

other matter is required to be referred to or disclosed in the Company
Disclosure Schedule. The information set forth in the Company Disclosure
Schedule is disclosed solely for the purposes of this Agreement, and no
information set forth therein shall be deemed to be an admission by any party
hereto to any third party of any matter whatsoever, including of any violation
of Law or breach of any agreement. The Company Disclosure Schedule and the
information and disclosures contained therein are intended only to qualify and
limit the representations, warranties and covenants of the Company contained
in this Agreement. Nothing in the Company Disclosure Schedule is intended to
broaden the scope of any representation or warranty contained in this
Agreement or create any covenant.
