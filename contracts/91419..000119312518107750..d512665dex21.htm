of their respective permitted assignees) shall fail or be unable to duly, punctually and fully pay or perform the Guaranteed Obligations, Guarantor will forthwith pay and cause to be paid in lawful currency of the United States, or perform or cause
to be performed, the Guaranteed Obligations. This guarantee is one of payment, not collection, and a separate Action or Actions may be brought and prosecuted against the Guarantor to enforce this guarantee, irrespective of whether any action is
brought against Purchaser, Merger Sub, any permitted assignee of Purchaser or Merger Sub, the Guarantor or any other guarantor now or hereafter liable with respect to the Guaranteed Obligations, or whether Purchaser, Merger Sub, any permitted
assignee of Purchaser or Merger Sub or any other guarantor is joined in any such Action. The Guarantor hereby irrevocably and unconditionally waives any and all notice of the creation, renewal, extension or accrual of any of the Guaranteed
Obligations and notice of or proof of reliance by the Company or CP Blocker Seller upon this guarantee or acceptance of this guarantee (other than notices to be provided to Purchaser or Merger Sub (or their respective permitted assignees) pursuant
to this Agreement). The Guaranteed Obligations, and any of them, shall conclusively be deemed to have been created, contracted or incurred in reliance upon this guarantee, and all dealings between Purchaser, Merger Sub or the Guarantor (or any
permitted assignee of Merger Sub or Purchaser), on the one hand, and the Company or CP Blocker Seller, on the other hand, shall likewise be conclusively presumed to have been had or consummated in reliance upon this guarantee. When pursuing its
rights and remedies hereunder against the Guarantor, the Company and CP Blocker Seller shall be under no obligation to pursue such rights and remedies it may have against Purchaser (or any permitted assignee thereof) or any other Person for the
Guaranteed Obligations or any right of offset with respect thereto, and any failure by the Company or CP Blocker Seller to pursue such other rights or remedies or to collect any payments from Purchaser or any such other Person or to realize upon or
to exercise any such right of offset shall not relieve the Guarantor of any liability hereunder, and shall not impair or affect the rights and remedies, whether express, implied or available as a matter of law, of the Company or CP Blocker Seller.
The Company and CP Blocker Seller shall not be obligated to file any claim relating to any Guaranteed Obligation in the event that Purchaser or Merger Sub (or any of their respective permitted assignees) becomes subject to a bankruptcy,
reorganization or similar Action, and the failure of the Company and CP Blocker Seller to so file shall not affect the Guarantor&#146;s obligations hereunder. In the event that any payment to the Company or CP Blocker Seller in respect of any
Guaranteed Obligation is rescinded or must otherwise be returned for any reason whatsoever, this guarantee shall continue to be effective or be reinstated, as the case may be, and the Guarantor shall remain liable hereunder with respect to the
Guaranteed Obligation as if such payment had not been made. In the event the Guarantor consolidates with or merges with any other Person and is not the continuing or surviving entity </P>
