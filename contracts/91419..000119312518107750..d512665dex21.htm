follows:

 

ARTICLE 1

_PURCHASE AND SALE OF THE CP BLOCKER STOCK; MERGER_

1.1 _Purchase and Sale of CP Blocker Stock_. On the terms and subject
to the conditions set forth in this Agreement, at the Closing and immediately
prior to the Effective Time, the CP Blocker Seller shall sell to Purchaser,
and Purchaser shall purchase from the CP Blocker Seller, the CP Blocker Stock,
free and clear of all Liens (other than any Liens arising under the
Securities Act, state securities Laws or Liens created by or resulting from
actions of Purchaser) (the " _CP Blocker Stock Acquisition_ "). The aggregate
purchase price for the CP Blocker Stock payable by Purchaser shall be: (i) at
the Effective Time, the portion of the Aggregate Estimated Closing
Consideration that would be distributed in respect of the CP Blocker Units had
the Aggregate Estimated Closing Consideration been distributed by the Company
in accordance with the Payment Schedule (such amount, the " _CP Blocker
Consideration_ "), and (ii) following the Effective Time, the amounts payable,
if any, in respect of the CP Blocker Stock (A) pursuant to _Section_ __ _
1.13_, (B) upon release of the Escrow Amount pursuant to the terms of the
Escrow Agreement, (C) upon release of the Sellers Representative Expense Fund
pursuant to the terms of  _Section_ __ _ 10.2(e)_ and (D) pursuant to
_Section_ __ _ 7.7(d)_ and _Section_ __ _ 7.7(h)_.

 

1.2 _Merger of the Company_. At the Effective Time and upon the terms and
subject to the conditions set forth in this Agreement and the applicable
provisions of the DLLCA, Merger Sub shall merge with and into the Company, the
separate limited liability company existence of Merger Sub shall cease and the
Company shall continue as the Surviving Company (the " _Merger_ "). At the
Closing, the Parties shall be deemed to consummate the CP Blocker Stock
Acquisition immediately prior to the consummation of the Merger, but neither
the CP Blocker Stock Acquisition nor the Merger shall be consummated unless
both transactions are consummated.

1.3 _The Closing and the Effective Time_. The closing of the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement (the " _Closing_ ") shall take place at the
offices of Kirkland and Ellis LLP, 601 Lexington Ave., New York, NY commencing
at 10:00 a.m. local time on the second Business Day following the
satisfaction or waiver of all conditions to each Partys obligation to
consummate the transactions contemplated by this Agreement (other than the
conditions which by their nature are to be satisfied at the Closing), or at
such other place, by such other method (including, without limitation, by way
of electronic exchange of signature pages and deliveries) or on such other
date as is mutually agreed to in writing by Purchaser and the Sellers
Representative;  _provided_ , _however_ , that if the Marketing Period has
not ended at the

 



2  time of the satisfaction or waiver of the conditions set forth in _Section_
__ _ 8.1_ and _Section_ __ _ 8.2_ (other than the conditions which by their
nature are to be satisfied at Closing, but subject to the satisfaction or
waiver of those conditions at such time), the Closing shall occur on the
earlier of (i) the date during the Marketing Period specified by Purchaser on
no less than three (3) Business Days notice to the Company and CP Blocker,
and (ii) the Business Day immediately following the final day of the Marketing
Period (as it may be extended pursuant to the definition of "Marketing
Period") (subject in each case of _clauses (i)_ and _(ii)_ to the
satisfaction or waiver of the conditions set forth in _Section_ __ _ 8.1_ and
_Section_ __ _ 8.2_ (other than those conditions which by their nature are
to be satisfied at Closing, but subject to the satisfaction or waiver of those
conditions at such time) as of the date determined pursuant to this proviso).
The date of the Closing is referred to herein as the " _Closing Date_." All
matters to be calculated as of the Closing Date pursuant to this Agreement
shall be calculated as of the Determination Time. On the Closing Date, and on
the terms and subject to the conditions set forth in this Agreement, the
Parties shall cause the Merger to be consummated by filing the Certificate of
Merger (the " _Certificate of Merger_ ") in substantially the form attached
hereto as _Exhibit A_ , with the Secretary of State of the State of Delaware
as required by, and executed in accordance with, the applicable provisions of
the DLLCA (the time of such filing with, and acceptance by, the Secretary of
State of the State of Delaware, or such later time as may be agreed upon in
writing by Purchaser and the Company and specified in the Certificate of
Merger, shall be referred to herein as the " _Effective Time_ ").

 

1.4 _Effect of the Merger_. At the Effective Time, the effect of the
Merger shall be as provided in the applicable provisions of the DLLCA.
Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, and subject thereto, at the
Effective Time by virtue of the Merger and without any action on the part of
Merger Sub or the Company, all of the property, rights, privileges, powers
and franchises of the Company and Merger Sub shall vest in the Surviving
Company, and all debts, liabilities and duties of the Company and Merger Sub
shall become the debts, liabilities and duties of the Surviving Company.

 

1.5 _Organizational Documents of the Surviving Company_. At the Effective
Time, by virtue of the Merger and without any action on the part of Merger
Sub or the Company, (a) the limited liability company agreement of the
Surviving Company shall be the limited liability company agreement of Merger
Sub (the " _Surviving Company Operating Agreement_ ") (except that the
Surviving Company Operating Agreement shall automatically be amended, without
further action, to update the name set forth in the Surviving Company
Operating Agreement to be the name of the Surviving Company), and (b) the
certificate of formation of the Surviving Company shall be the certificate of
formation of the Company, each as in effect immediately prior to the Effective
Time.

 

1.6 _Member and Officers of the Surviving Company_. The sole member of
Merger Sub immediately prior to the Effective Time shall be the sole member
of the Surviving Company immediately after the Effective Time. Until duly
removed or until successors are duly elected or appointed and qualified, the
officers of Merger Sub immediately prior to the Effective Time shall be the
officers of the Surviving Company immediately after the Effective Time.

1.7 _Treatment of Company Units and Limited Liability Company Interests
of Merger Sub and CP Blocker Units_.

 



3 (a) _Effect on the Acquired Units_. At the Effective Time, by virtue of
the Merger and without any action on the part of Merger Sub, the Company or
the Unitholders, each Acquired Unit issued and outstanding immediately prior
to the Effective Time, on the terms and conditions set forth in this
Agreement, shall be converted automatically into the right to receive a
portion of the Aggregate Final Consideration as follows: (i) at the Effective
Time, the portion of the Aggregate Estimated Closing Consideration allocable
to such Acquired Unit (which, for the avoidance of doubt, will vary depending
on the designation and participation threshold of such Acquired Unit in the
Company LLC Agreement) in accordance with the Payment Schedule, and (ii)
following the Effective Time, the amounts payable, if any, in respect of each
Acquired Unit issued and outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time
(A) pursuant to _Section_ __ _ 1.13_, (B) upon release of the Escrow Amount
pursuant to the terms of the Escrow Agreement, (C) upon release of the
Sellers Representative Expense Fund pursuant to the terms of _Section_ __ _
10.2(e)_ and (D) pursuant to _Section_ __ _ 7.7(d)_ and  _Section_ __ _
7.7(h)_. All Acquired Units, by virtue of such conversion, shall cease to be
outstanding, shall automatically be cancelled and retired and cease to exist,
and each former holder thereof shall cease to have any rights with respect
thereto, except the right to receive the portion of the Aggregate Final
Consideration provided for in this _Section_ __ _ 1.7(a)_. For the avoidance
of doubt, in no event shall CP Blocker be entitled to receive any portion of
the Aggregate Final Consideration payable pursuant to this _Section_ __ _
1.7(a)_.

 

(b) _Limited Liability Company Interests of Merger Sub and CP Blocker
Units_. At the Effective Time, by virtue of the Merger and without any action
on the part of Merger Sub, CP Blocker, the Company or Purchaser, (i) all of
the limited liability company interests in Merger Sub issued and outstanding
immediately prior to the Effective Time and (ii) all CP Blocker Units shall
each be converted into and exchanged for limited liability company interests
in the Surviving Company. Each certificate of Merger Sub evidencing ownership
of any of its limited liability company interests, if any, and
each certificate representing CP Blocker Units, if any, shall automatically
be deemed to evidence ownership of such interests of the Surviving Company.

 

1.8 _Mechanism of Payment_.

 

(a) Prior to the Closing and in any event not later than ten (10) Business
Days after the date hereof, the Company shall deliver to (i) each Unitholder
(other than CP Blocker) a Letter of Transmittal substantially in the form
attached as _Exhibit B_ hereto (a " _Letter of Transmittal_ ") and (ii) each
Phantom Plan Participant a SAR Cancellation Agreement substantially in the
applicable form attached as _Exhibit C_ hereto (a " _SAR Cancellation
Agreement_ "). At the Effective Time, Purchaser shall deliver to each
Unitholder (other than CP Blocker) that has delivered, no later than two (2)
Business Days prior to the Closing Date, a Letter of Transmittal in accordance
with this _Section_ __ _ 1.8(a)_, to the account set forth in such Letter of
Transmittal, by wire transfer of immediately available funds, the portion of
the Aggregate Estimated Closing Consideration payable to such holder in
accordance with _Section_ __ _ 1.7(a)_ and the Payment Schedule.

 

(b) Following the Closing, upon delivery by a Unitholder (other than CP
Blocker) that did not receive a portion of the Aggregate Estimated Closing
Consideration at the Closing pursuant to _Section_ __ _ 1.8(a)_ to the
Surviving Company of a Letter of Transmittal, the

 



4  Surviving Company shall deliver to such Unitholder, within five (5) Business
Days after such delivery, to the account set forth in such Letter of
Transmittal, by wire transfer of immediately available funds, cash in an
amount equal to the portion of the Aggregate Estimated Closing Consideration
payable to such Unitholder in accordance with _Section_ __ _ 1.7(a)_. No
interest or dividends will be paid or accrued on the consideration payable to
any Unitholder hereunder. Until surrendered in accordance with the provisions
of this _Section_ __ _ 1.8(b)_, the Acquired Units shall represent, for all
purposes, only the right to receive an amount in cash equal to the portion of
the Aggregate Final Consideration payable in respect thereof pursuant to
_Section_ __ _ 1.7(a)_, without any interest or dividends thereon.

 

(c) None of Purchaser, Merger Sub, the CP Blocker Parties, the Company, the
Sellers Representative or the Surviving Company shall be liable to any
Person in respect of any cash or property delivered to a public official
pursuant to any applicable abandoned property, escheat or similar Law. To the
extent consideration hereunder is unclaimed and would otherwise escheat
pursuant to applicable Law, any portion of the Aggregate Estimated Closing
Consideration remaining unclaimed by Unitholders or Phantom Plan Participants
twelve (12) months after the Closing Date (or such earlier date immediately
prior to such time when the amounts would otherwise escheat to or become
property of any Governmental Authority) shall become the property of the
Surviving Company free and clear of any claim or interest of any Person
previously entitled thereto and may thereafter be paid by Surviving Company
to Purchaser, at Purchasers option.

(d) Each Letter of Transmittal and SAR Cancellation Agreement delivered
pursuant to _Section_ __ _ 1.8(a)_ and _1.8(b)_ must be duly executed by the
applicable Unitholder or Phantom Plan Participant and completed in accordance
with the instructions thereto.

(e) Following delivery of a fully executed SAR Cancellation Agreement by a
Phantom Plan Participant, Purchaser shall pay any amounts payable to such
Phantom Plan Participant to the Surviving Company (for the benefit and further
payment to such Phantom Plan Participant in accordance with the Payment
Schedule), which shall promptly pay such amounts to such Phantom Plan
Participants, less applicable withholding Taxes, in accordance with the
Surviving Companys customary payroll practices. For the avoidance of doubt,
no Phantom Plan Participant shall be entitled to receive any proceeds payable
to him or her under the SAR Phantom Stock Plan as a result of the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement until and unless he or she properly executes
and delivers a SAR Cancellation Agreement.

 

1.9 _No Further Ownership Rights in the Company Units_. The portion of the
Aggregate Final Consideration paid in respect of the Company Units (or, in
the case of CP Blocker Units, the limited liability company interests of the
Surviving Company issued in respect thereof) in accordance with the terms
hereof shall be deemed to be full satisfaction of all rights pertaining to
such Company Units (including such CP Blocker Units), and, upon the Effective
Time, there shall be no further registration of transfers on the records of
the Surviving Company of Company Units (including such CP Blocker Units)
which were outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time.

the Closing, the Company shall obtain customary payoff letters for all such

regulations promulgated under the Code; and

 

(i) the CP Blocker Seller shall deliver to Purchaser a stock certificate
representing all of the CP Blocker Stock, endorsed in blank or accompanied by

1.13 _Determination of Post-Closing Adjustment_.

 

(a) Promptly, but in any event within ninety (90) days after the Closing
Date, Purchaser shall prepare and deliver to the Sellers Representative (x)
a consolidated balance sheet of the APN Entities as of the Determination Time
(the " _Closing Balance Sheet_ ") and (y) a statement, duly certified by each
of Purchaser and the chief financial officer of the Surviving Company as
accurately setting forth Purchasers good faith determination of (i) Cash,
(ii) the Sellers Transaction Expenses, (iii) Indebtedness as of the Closing,
(iv) Working Capital and (v) the Aggregate Adjusted Closing Consideration
(such statement, the " _Closing Statement_ "). The Closing Statement shall be
prepared based upon the facts and circumstances of the APN Entities as of the
Determination Time in accordance with the definitions as provided in this
Agreement and the Agreed Accounting Principles. The Parties agree that this
_Section_ __ _ 1.13_ and the preparation of the Closing Statement is not
intended to permit the introduction of judgments, accounting methods,
policies, principles, practices, procedures, classifications or estimation
methodologies different from those used by the Company in the preparation of
the Latest Balance Sheet and in accordance with the Agreed Accounting
Principles. If Purchaser fails to timely deliver a Closing Statement in
accordance with this _Section_ __ _ 1.13(a)_, then the Closing Estimate
Certificate will be deemed to be the Closing Statement, and the Sellers
Representative may deliver a Dispute Notice with respect thereto in accordance
with _Section_ __ _ 1.13(b)_.

 



7 (b) If the Sellers Representative disagrees with any portion of
the Purchasers determination of the Cash, Indebtedness, Working Capital, the
Sellers Transaction Expenses and/or the Aggregate Adjusted Closing
Consideration, in each case, as reflected on the Closing Statement or any
portion of the Closing Balance Sheet, the Sellers Representative may, within
forty-five (45) days after receipt of the Closing Statement and the Closing
Balance Sheet, deliver a written notice (the " _Dispute Notice_ ") to
Purchaser setting forth the Sellers Representatives calculation of each
disputed amount (each an " _Item of Dispute_ "). The Sellers Representative
and its agents, accountants, auditors and representatives shall have
reasonable access to all books and records and work papers (including those
of Purchasers, CP Blockers and the APN Entities accountants and auditors)
relating to the Closing Statement and the Closing Balance Sheet and all other
items reasonably requested by the Sellers Representative or its agents,
accountants, auditors or representatives, as applicable, as well as reasonable
access to employees, accountants, auditors and representatives of Purchaser,
CP Blocker and the APN Entities to assist the Sellers Representative and its
agents, accountants, auditors and representatives in its and their review of
such work papers, the Closing Statement and the Closing Balance Sheet. If
Purchaser does not receive a Dispute Notice within forty-five (45) days after
receipt by the Sellers Representative of the Closing Statement and the
Closing Balance Sheet, the Closing Statement and the Closing Balance Sheet
shall be conclusive and binding upon each of the Parties. If Purchaser
receives a Dispute Notice from the Sellers Representative within forty-five
(45) days after receipt by the Sellers Representative of the Closing
Statement and the Closing Balance Sheet, Purchaser and the
Sellers Representative shall use reasonable efforts to resolve each Item of
Dispute, and, if any Item of Dispute is so resolved, the Closing Statement or
the Closing Balance Sheet, as applicable, shall be modified to the extent
necessary to reflect such resolution. If any Item of Dispute remains
unresolved as of the thirtieth (30th) day after delivery by the Sellers
Representative of the Dispute Notice, Purchaser and the Sellers
Representative shall jointly retain Grant Thornton LLP (the " _Arbiter_ ") to
resolve such remaining disagreement, it being understood that any item not
included as an Item of Dispute in the Dispute Notice shall be conclusive and
binding upon each of the Parties as set forth in the Closing Statement and
the Closing Balance Sheet. Purchaser and the Sellers Representative shall
request that the Arbiter render a determination as to each unresolved Item of
Dispute within thirty (30) days after the Arbiters retention, and Purchaser
and the Sellers Representative shall, and Purchaser shall cause CP Blocker
and the APN Entities and each of their respective agents, accountants,
auditors and representatives to, cooperate fully with the Arbiter so as to
enable it to make such determination as quickly and accurately as reasonably
practicable, including by the provision by Purchaser, CP Blocker and the APN
Entities of all books and records and work papers (including those of CP
Blockers and the APN Entities accountants and auditors) relating to the
Closing Statement or the Closing Balance Sheet and all other items reasonably
requested by the Arbiter (in each case in such a manner so as not to waive or
eliminate any privilege applicable to any such information). The Arbiter
shall consider only those Items of Dispute that remain unresolved by Purchaser
and the Sellers Representative. In resolving any Item of Dispute, the Arbiter
may not assign a value to any item greater than the greatest value, or less
than the smallest value, for such item claimed by Purchaser on the Closing
Statement and the Closing Balance Sheet or the Sellers Representative in the
Dispute Notice. The Arbiters determination(s) shall be based upon the
definitions of Cash, Sellers Transaction Expenses, Indebtedness, Working
Capital and Aggregate Adjusted Closing Consideration (as applicable) included
herein and the Agreed Accounting Principles, and shall not be an 

 



8  independent review. The Arbiters determination of each Item of Dispute
submitted to it shall be in writing, shall conform with this _Section_ __ _
1.13_ and shall be conclusive and binding upon each of the Parties, and the
Closing Statement and the Closing Balance Sheet shall be modified to the
extent necessary to reflect such determination(s). The Arbiter shall allocate
its fees, costs and expenses between Purchaser, on the one hand, and the
Sellers Representative (on behalf of the CP Blocker Seller and the
Unitholders (other than CP Blocker)), on the other hand, based upon the
percentage which the portion of the contested amount not awarded to each such
Party bears to the amount actually contested by such Party. For example, if
the Sellers Representative claims in a Dispute Notice that the Items of
Dispute are in the aggregate $1,000 greater than the amounts determined for
such items by Purchaser in the Closing Statement, and the Arbiter ultimately
determines to award the Sellers Representative $600 of the $1,000 contested,
then the fees, costs and expenses of the Arbiter will be allocated 60% (i.e.,
600 ÷ 1,000) to Purchaser and 40% (i.e., 400 ÷ 1,000) to the Sellers
Representative (on behalf of the CP Blocker Seller and the Unitholders (other
than CP Blocker)). Cash, Sellers Transaction Expenses, Indebtedness as of the
Closing and Working Capital, in each case as finally determined pursuant to
this _Section_ __ _ 1.13_, are referred to herein as the " _Actual Cash_ ," "
_Actual Sellers_ __ _Transaction Expenses_ ," " _Actual Indebtedness_ " and
the " _Actual Working Capital_ ," respectively. The Sellers Representative
shall promptly revise the Payment Schedule to reflect the final determination
of such amounts.

 

(c) If the Aggregate Adjusted Closing Consideration as finally determined
pursuant to  _Section_ __ _ 1.13(b)_ is greater than the Aggregate Estimated
Closing Consideration, then, within five (5) Business Days after the
determination of Aggregate Adjusted Closing Consideration, (A) Purchaser shall
pay, by wire transfer of immediately available funds, to (1) an account
designated in writing by the CP Blocker Seller, the portion of such excess
allocable to the CP Blocker Seller in accordance with _Section_ __ _ 1.1_ and
the Payment Schedule, and (2) each holder of Acquired Units that has
delivered a Letter of Transmittal in accordance with _Sections_ __ _ 1.8(a)_
or _1.8(b)_ , to the account set forth in such Letter of Transmittal,
the portion of such excess allocable to such holder in accordance with
_Section_ __ _ 1.7(a)_ and the Payment Schedule, and (B) Purchaser and
Sellers Representative shall jointly instruct the Escrow Agent to deliver
to (1) an account designated in writing by the CP Blocker Seller, the portion
of the Escrow Funds allocable to the CP Blocker Seller in accordance with
_Section_ __ _ 1.1_ and the Payment Schedule, and (2) each holder
of Acquired Units that has delivered a Letter of Transmittal in accordance
with _Sections_ __ _ 1.8(a)_ or _1.8(b)_ , to the account set forth in such
Letter of Transmittal, the portion of the Escrow Funds allocable to such
holder in accordance with _Section_ __ _ 1.7(a)_ and the Payment Schedule.

(d) If the Aggregate Adjusted Closing Consideration as finally determined
pursuant to _Section_ __ _ 1.13(b)_ is less than the Aggregate Estimated
Closing Consideration, then, within five (5) Business Days after the
determination of the Aggregate Adjusted Closing Consideration, Purchaser and
the Sellers Representative shall jointly instruct the Escrow Agent to (A)
deliver, by wire transfer of immediately available funds, to an account
designated in writing by the Purchaser from the Escrow Fund, an amount equal
to the lesser of (x) such difference and (y) the then remaining balance of the
Escrow Fund and (B) after giving effect to the delivery set forth in _clause
(A)_ , deliver, by wire transfer of immediately available funds, to (1) an
account designated in writing by the CP Blocker Seller, the portion of the
then remaining balance of the Escrow Fund (if any) allocable to the CP Blocker
Seller in accordance 

 



9  with _Section_ __ _ 1.1_ and the Payment Schedule, and (2) each holder of
Acquired Units that has delivered a Letter of Transmittal in accordance with 
_Sections_ __ _ 1.8(a)_ or _1.8(b)_ , to the account set forth in such Letter
of Transmittal, the portion of the then remaining balance of the Escrow Fund
(if any) allocable to such holder in accordance with  _Section_ __ _ 1.7(a)_
and the Payment Schedule.

(e) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement, (i) the CP
Blocker Seller and the Unitholders shall have no liability to Purchaser or any
of its Affiliates for any adjustment amount pursuant to this _Section_ __ _
1.13_ except to the extent of the then remaining balance of the Escrow Fund
and (ii) recovery from the Escrow Fund shall be the sole and exclusive remedy
available to Purchaser and any of its Affiliates for any claims arising out of
or relating to this  _Section_ __ _ 1.13_, and neither Purchaser nor the
Surviving Company nor any of their respective Affiliates shall have any claim
against CP Blocker Seller or any Unitholder in respect thereof.
Notwithstanding the foregoing, and for the avoidance of doubt, nothing in
this _Section_ __ _ 1.13(e)_ shall limit in any respect Purchasers rights
under _Section_ __ _ 7.7(h)_. The Parties agree that any amount paid under
this  _Section_ __ _ 1.13_ shall be treated as an adjustment to the
Aggregate Final Consideration for Tax purposes and, except to the extent
required by applicable Tax law, not to take any position inconsistent with
such treatment on any Tax Return.

1.14 _Allocation of Amounts Paid By Purchaser or Merger Sub_. The Parties
shall allocate the Aggregate Final Consideration for Tax purposes in
accordance with (i) the allocation of the Aggregate Final Consideration
between the CP Blocker Stock and the Acquired Units and (ii) the further
allocation of the Aggregate Final Consideration (and any other relevant items
for Tax purposes) among the assets of the APN Entities, in accordance with the
principles of Sections 743, 751 and 755 of the Code and the Treasury
Regulations thereunder and in the manner and in accordance with the
methodology set forth on _Exhibit D_ hereto (the " _Purchase Price Allocation_
"). Purchaser shall prepare and deliver to the Sellers Representative a draft
Purchase Price Allocation within 120 days following the Closing Date for the
Sellers Representatives review and comment. If Purchaser and the Sellers
Representative are unable to resolve any disagreement regarding the Purchase
Price Allocation within thirty (30) days of the Sellers Representatives
submission of revisions to the Purchase Price Allocation, then any remaining
disputed matters will be submitted to the Arbiter for resolution. The Sellers
Representative and Purchaser shall jointly instruct the Arbiter that it (i)
shall be bound to make a determination in accordance with _Exhibit D_ hereto,
(ii) shall review only the matters that were included in the written
submission of the parties to the Arbiter and which remain in dispute (which,
for the avoidance of doubt, shall be limited to the items that were the
subject of the Sellers Representatives proposed revisions to the Purchase
Price Allocation), and (iii) shall not assign a value for any disputed item
that is greater than the greatest value, or smaller than the smallest value,
advocated for by the Sellers Representative or Purchaser. On this basis, the
Arbiter will determine those matters in dispute in accordance with this
_Section_ __ _ 1.14_ and will render a written report as to the disputed
matters and the resulting Purchase Price Allocation which report shall be
conclusive and binding upon the parties. The fees and expenses of the Arbiter
in respect of such report shall be paid one-half by Purchaser and one-half by
the Sellers Representative (on behalf of the CP Blocker Seller and the
Unitholders (other than CP Blocker)). The Parties shall cooperate in good
faith to update the Purchase Price Allocation to reflect any adjustment to the
Aggregate Final Consideration (and any other relevant items). Each of
the Parties shall file all Tax Returns (including amended returns and claims
for refund) and

 



10  information reports in a manner consistent with the Purchase Price
Allocation, as finally determined pursuant to this _Section_ __ _ 1.14_.

 

1.15 _Withholding_. Purchaser and the Company shall be entitled to deduct
and withhold (or cause to be deducted and withheld) from any amount payable
pursuant to this Agreement such amounts as are required to be deducted and
withheld under applicable Tax law; provided, that promptly upon becoming aware
of any potential required withholding (other than in respect of wages or
other similar compensation for services), Purchaser shall notify the Sellers
Representative of such withholding obligation, in writing and in reasonable
detail, and shall cooperate with Sellers Representative to reduce or
eliminate any withholding that otherwise would be required. Amounts withheld
pursuant to this _Section_ __ _ 1.15_ and paid over to the appropriate Taxing
Authority shall be treated for all purposes of this Agreement as having been
paid to the Person in respect of which such deduction and withholding was
made. Notwithstanding the foregoing, if any Unitholder delivers to Purchaser
at or prior to Closing an affidavit of non-foreign status pursuant to Section
1446(f)(2)(A) of the Code, Notice 2018-29, 2018-16 IRB, and any subsequent
Department of Treasury or Internal Revenue Service guidance addressing the
application of Section 1446(f) of the Code, then Purchaser shall not be
permitted to withhold pursuant to Section 1446(f) of the Code unless pursuant
to the terms of Section 1446(f)(2)(B) of the Code. Absent a change in Law or
further regulatory guidance, the Parties agree that an Internal Revenue
Service Form W-9 meeting the requirements set forth in Section 6.01 of Notice
2018-29, 2018-16 IRB shall satisfy the affidavit requirement of non-foreign
status contemplated by Section 1446(f)(2)(A) of the Code.

other antitrust Law or Permit), except, in the case of _clause (iv)_ , where a
failure to give such notice, to file or to obtain any such authorization,
consent, approval, exemption, filing or registration would not reasonably be
expected to be material to the APN Entities, taken as a whole.

each of the following financial statements (collectively, the " _Financial

former officer, employee, director or consultant (or dependents of such
Persons), or (ii) accelerate the time of payment or vesting, or materially
increase the amount of compensation due to any current or former officer,
employee, director or consultant (or dependents of such Persons) of any of
the APN Entities.

(l) None of the APN Entities has agreed or committed to institute
any material plan, program, arrangement or agreement for the benefit of

or any of their affiliates who is a "disqualified individual" (as such term
is defined in Treasury Regulation Section 1.280G-1) under any employment,
severance or termination agreement, other compensation arrangement or Employee

against or with respect to any APN Entity, and no APN Entity has received

taxation by, or required to file Tax Returns in, that jurisdiction.

Tax sharing agreement (excluding (x) the tax distribution provision of any

or obligation to pay any fees or commissions to any broker, finder or agent
with respect to the transactions contemplated by this Agreement for which
Purchaser or any of the APN Entities would be liable after the Closing.

2.18 _Insurance_. _Schedule_ __ _ 2.18_ provides a complete and accurate
list of each insurance policy maintained by or for the benefit of the APN
Entities, their assets or properties or otherwise covering the operations of

policies have been timely paid, and the APN Entities have otherwise
materially complied with the terms and conditions of such policies. To the

such enforceability may be limited by the Enforceability Exceptions.

 



35 5.3 _No Breach_. Assuming the truth and accuracy of the representations
and warranties of the Company, CP Blocker Seller and CP Blocker in _Article 2_
, _Article 3_ and _Article 4_ , as the case may be, the execution, delivery
and performance by Purchaser, Merger Sub and Guarantor of this Agreement and

Guarantor is a party and the consummation of each of the transactions
contemplated hereby or thereby will not (i) violate any provision of

consent, approval, exemption, filing, registration or notice to any
Governmental Authority under the provisions of any Law (except for the filing
and recordation of the Certificate of Merger as required by the DLLCA and any
such actions required by the HSR Act or any other antitrust Law).

5.4 _Litigation_. There are no Actions pending or, to the Knowledge of
Purchaser, threatened against or affecting Purchaser, Merger Sub or
Guarantor, at law or in equity, or before or by any Governmental Authority,
which would reasonably be expected to prevent, enjoin, alter or materially
delay the consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby. 

5.5 _Investment Intent; Restricted Securities_. Purchaser is acquiring the
CP Blocker Stock and the Acquired Units solely for Purchasers own account,
for investment purposes only, and not with a view to, or with any present
intention of, reselling or otherwise distributing the CP Blocker Stock or the
Acquired Units or dividing its participation therein with others. Purchaser
understands and acknowledges that (i) neither the CP Blocker Stock nor the
Acquired Units have not been registered or qualified under the Securities Act,
or under any securities Laws of any state of the United States or any other
jurisdiction, and have been issued in reliance upon specific exemptions
thereunder, (ii) the CP Blocker Stock and the Acquired Units constitute
"restricted securities" as defined in Rule 144 under the Securities Act,
(iii) none of the Acquired Units or the CP Blocker Stock is traded or tradable
on any securities exchange or over-the-counter and (iv) none of the Acquired
Units or CP Blocker Stock may be sold, transferred or otherwise disposed of
unless a registration statement under the Securities Act with respect to such
CP Blocker Stock or Acquired Units, as applicable, and qualification in
accordance with any applicable state securities Laws becomes effective or
unless such registration and qualification is inapplicable, or an exemption
therefrom is available. Purchaser will not transfer or otherwise dispose of
any of the CP Blocker Stock or any of the Acquired Units acquired hereunder
or any interest thereon in any manner that may cause the CP Blocker Seller or
any Unitholder to be in violation of the Securities Act or any applicable
state securities Laws. Purchaser is an "accredited investor" as defined in
Rule 501(a) of the Securities Act. Purchaser acknowledges that it is informed
as to the risks of the transactions contemplated hereby and of ownership of
the CP Blocker Stock and the Acquired Units.

 



36 5.6 _Brokerage_. None of Purchaser, Merger Sub or Guarantor has
any liability or obligation to pay any fees or commissions to any broker,
finder or agent with respect to the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement for which CP Blocker Seller or the Unitholders (other than CP
Blocker) would be liable.

 

5.7 _Financing_. Guarantor has delivered to the Company true, complete and
correct copies of the executed commitment letter, dated as of the date
hereof, from the Debt Financing Sources and the executed fee letter (with only
the amounts or fees, "pricing flex" and economic terms therein redacted)
associated therewith (such commitment letter, including all exhibits,
schedules, annexes, supplements, amendments and joinders thereto and the fee
letter, including all exhibits, schedules, annexes, supplements, amendments
and joinders thereto, collectively, the " _Debt Financing Commitments_ "),
pursuant to which the Debt Financing Sources party thereto have committed, on
the terms and subject to the conditions set forth therein, to lend the amounts
set forth therein (the " _Debt Financing_ ") for the purposes of financing
the transactions contemplated by this Agreement and related fees and expenses.
None of Purchaser, Merger Sub, Guarantor or any of their respective Affiliates
has entered into any agreement, side letter or arrangement relating to the
Debt Financing that would be prohibited by _Section_ __ _ 6.8(a)_ of this
Agreement. The Debt Financing Commitments represent a valid, binding and
enforceable obligation of Purchaser and, to the knowledge of Purchaser,
each other party thereto, enforceable against such party in accordance with
its terms, subject to the applicable Enforceability Exceptions. Guarantor,
Purchaser and the Merger Sub have fully paid (or caused to be paid) any and
all commitment fees and other amounts that are due and payable on or prior to
the date of this Agreement in connection with the Debt Financing. No event has
occurred which, with or without notice, lapse of time or both, would
constitute a breach or default on the part of Purchaser, Merger Sub or
Guarantor or, to the knowledge of Purchaser, Merger Sub or Guarantor, any
other party thereto under the Debt Financing Commitments, which would or would
reasonably be expected, in any such case, to prevent or delay the funding or
financing described therein or the consummation of the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement. There are no conditions precedent related to
the funding of the full amount of the Debt Financing other than as expressly
set forth in the Debt Financing Commitments. Purchaser will have at Closing
sufficient cash on hand or other sources of immediately available funds
sufficient to consummate the transactions contemplated by this Agreement,
including to pay the Aggregate Adjusted Closing Consideration and the fees
and expenses of or payable by Purchaser, Merger Sub and Guarantor related to
the transactions contemplated hereby. Purchaser affirms that it is not a
condition to Closing or to any of its obligations under this Agreement that
Purchaser obtains financing for the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement.

5.8 _Purchaser Due Diligence Review_. Each of Purchaser, Merger Sub and
Guarantor acknowledges that: (i) it has conducted its own due diligence review
with respect to CP Blocker and the APN Entities and it is entering into the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement based on such independent
investigation and analysis and, except for the specific representations and
warranties made by the Company, the CP Blocker Seller and CP Blocker in
_Article 2_ , _Article 3_ and _Article 4_ , respectively, it is not relying
upon any representation or warranty of any APN Entity, CP Blocker or the CP
Blocker Seller or any Affiliate thereof or any officer, director, employee,
agent or advisor, or any of them, nor upon the accuracy of any projection or
statement made available or given to Purchaser, Merger Sub or Guarantor in the
performance of such investigation, (ii) it has had access to the APN Entities
and CP Blocker and

 



37  their respective books and records, contracts, agreements and documents
(including Tax Returns and related documents), and employees, agents,
representatives and other personnel, and (iii) it has had such opportunity to
seek accounting, legal, tax or other advice or information in connection with
its entry into this Agreement and the other documents referred to herein
relating to the consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby and
thereby as it has seen fit.

5.9 _Solvency_. Assuming the truth and accuracy in all material respects
of the representations and warranties of the Company, CP Blocker Seller and CP
Blocker in _Article 2_ , _Article 3_ and _Article 4_ , as the case may be, as
of the Closing, and after giving effect to all of the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement, Purchaser, CP Blocker, the Surviving Company
and the APN Entities, taken as a whole, will be Solvent. For purposes of this
_Section_ __ _ 5.9_, " _Solvent_ " means that, with respect to any Person
and as of any date of determination, (i) the amount of the "present fair
saleable value" of the assets of such Person, will, as of such date, exceed
the amount of all "liabilities of such Person, contingent or otherwise," as
of such date, as such quoted terms are generally determined in accordance with
applicable federal Laws governing determinations of the insolvency of debtors,
(ii) the present fair saleable value of the assets of such Person will, as of
such date, be greater than the amount that will be required to pay the
liability of such Person on its indebtedness as its indebtedness becomes
absolute and matured, (iii) such Person will not have, as of such date, an
unreasonably small amount of capital with which to conduct its business and
(iv) such Person will be able to pay its indebtedness as it matures. For
purposes of the foregoing definition only, "indebtedness" means a liability
in connection with another Persons (x) right to payment, whether or not such
a right is reduced to judgment, liquidated, unliquidated, fixed, contingent,
matured, unmatured, disputed, undisputed, legal, equitable, secured or
unsecured or (y) right to any equitable remedy for breach of performance if
such breach gives rise to a right of payment, whether or not such right to an
equitable remedy is reduced to judgment, fixed, contingent, matured,
unmatured, disputed, undisputed, secured or unsecured. No transfer of
property is being made and no obligation is being incurred in connection with
the transactions contemplated by this Agreement with the intent to hinder,
delay or defraud either present or future creditors of CP Blocker or the APN
Entities.

5.10 _Mass Layoffs_. Purchaser does not currently plan or contemplate any
plant closings, reductions in force, or terminations of employees of the APN
Entities that, in the aggregate, would trigger the WARN Act or any other
similar Law, rule or regulation of any Governmental Authority.

 

5.11 _No Prior Activities_. Except for obligations incurred in connection
with its organization and the transactions contemplated by this Agreement,
Merger Sub has not incurred any obligation or liability nor engaged in any
business or activity of any type or kind whatsoever or entered into any
agreement or arrangement with any Person.

grant any accommodation (financial or otherwise) to any third party, and in

6.3 _Access_. From the date of this Agreement until the Closing (or until
such earlier time as this Agreement is terminated in accordance with _Section_
__ _ 9.1_), CP Blocker shall permit, and the Company shall permit (and shall
cause each of the other APN Entities to permit), representatives of Purchaser
to have reasonable access, upon reasonable advance notice, at reasonable times

normal business operations of the APN Entities or CP Blocker, to all
premises, properties, assets, information technology, senior officers and
employees, agents, accountants (subject to access letters), consultants,
representatives, books, records, contracts and documents of the APN Entities
and/or CP Blocker, as applicable;  _provided_ , the foregoing shall be
permitted only to the extent (i) it would not result in the loss of the
ability of CP Blocker, the APN Entities or any of

 



39  their Affiliates to successfully assert attorney-client and work product
privileges and (ii) it would not breach any Contract or violate any Law or any
duty of confidentiality owed to any Person; _provided_ , _further_ , that the
foregoing shall not be permitted (x) in the event CP Blocker, the APN Entities
or any of their Affiliates, on the one hand, and Purchaser or any of its
Affiliates, on the other hand, are adverse parties in a litigation, to
anything reasonably pertinent thereto, (y) with respect to anything CP Blocker
or the Company, as applicable, reasonably determines should not be disclosed

Real Property, without the prior written consent of the Company; _provided_ ,
_further_ , that if any information is so restricted or withheld, CP Blocker
or the Company shall inform Purchaser as to the general nature of what is
being restricted or withheld and use reasonable best efforts to take those
actions reasonably necessary so that CP Blocker and the Company are able to
provide such information to Purchaser. Purchaser acknowledges that Purchaser
is and remains bound by the Confidentiality Agreement, between The J. M.
Smucker Company and the Company dated October 30, 2017 (the " _Confidentiality
Agreement_ "), and Merger Sub agrees to abide by the terms of the
Confidentiality Agreement in the same manner as such terms are applicable to
"you". The provision of any information pursuant to this Agreement by any APN
Entity shall not expand the remedies available hereunder to Purchaser or its

the transactions contemplated by this Agreement and will be governed by all
the terms and conditions of the Confidentiality Agreement.

submissions required under any Laws or regulations applicable to the
transactions contemplated herein (which filings and submissions shall request

further information made in respect of any such filing. Subject to applicable
Laws relating to the exchange of information, the Company and Purchaser will

relating to, or the consummation of, such acquisition, merger or consolidation

contemplated hereby or the expiration or termination of any applicable
waiting period, (ii) increase the risk of any Governmental Authority entering
an order prohibiting the consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby,

Commitments or an alternative source of debt financing, in each case in lieu
thereof) on the terms and conditions described in or contemplated by the Debt
Financing Commitments (including complying with any request exercising so-

Debt Financing Commitments or the definitive agreements relating to the Debt
Financing, or enter into any other agreement or arrangement with respect to
alternative financing, if such amendment, modification or waiver or other
agreement or arrangement (i) decreases the aggregate amount of the Debt
Financing to an amount that, together with Purchasers and the Merger Subs
cash on hand or available alternative financing commitments, would be less
than an amount that would be required to fund the payment of the Aggregate
Adjusted Closing Consideration and the fees and expenses of or payable by
Purchaser and Merger Sub related to the transactions contemplated hereby or
(ii) imposes new or additional conditions or otherwise expands any of the
conditions to the receipt of the Debt Financing (or the permanent financing
contemplated by the Debt Financing Commitments or an alternative source of
debt financing, in each case in lieu thereof) or otherwise consent or agree to
any amendment or modification, or any waiver of any provision or any other
agreement or arrangement that would or would reasonably be expected
to prevent or

 



43  materially delay the funding or financing described therein or the
consummation of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement; _provided_ ,
that, for the avoidance of doubt Purchaser and the Merger Sub shall be
permitted to consent or agree to any amendment or modification, or any waiver
of any provision, under the Debt Financing Commitments if such amendment,
modification or waiver solely extends the term of the Debt
Financing Commitments or adds lenders, lead arrangers, bookrunners,
syndication agents or similar entities that have not executed the Debt
Financing Commitments as of the date hereof as parties thereto. Upon the
Companys request, Purchaser and the Merger Sub shall keep the Company
reasonably informed on a current basis and in reasonable detail of material
developments in respect of the Debt Financing and the financing process
relating thereto. Purchaser and the Merger Sub shall provide the Company
prompt notice (x) of any breach or default by any party to the Debt Financing
Commitments (or the permanent financing contemplated by the Debt Financing
Commitments or an alternative source of debt financing, in each case in
lieu thereof) or definitive agreements related thereto of which Purchaser and
the Merger Sub become aware that would or would reasonably be expected to
prevent or materially delay the funding or financing described in the Debt
Financing Commitments or the consummation of the transactions contemplated by
this Agreement, and (y) if at any time for any reason Purchaser and the Merger
Sub believes in good faith that it will not be able to obtain all or any
portion of the Debt Financing on the terms and conditions contemplated by the
Debt Financing Commitments or definitive agreements related thereto. As soon
as reasonably practicable, Purchaser and the Merger Sub shall provide any
information reasonably requested by the Company relating to any circumstance
referred to in _clause (x)_ or _(y)_ of the immediately preceding sentence.

 

(b) Prior to the Closing, each of the Company and CP Blocker shall, and
each shall cause the other APN Entities and their respective Affiliates to,
and shall use its reasonable best efforts to cause its, the APN Entities and
their respective Affiliates officers, directors, employees, agents, and other
representatives (collectively, " _Representatives_ ") to, at Purchasers sole
cost and expense, provide all cooperation that is reasonably requested by
Purchaser to assist Purchaser and the Merger Sub in the arrangement of any
third party debt financing (including the Debt Financing and any debt capital
markets financing) for the purpose of funding the payment of the Aggregate
Adjusted Closing Consideration and the fees and expenses of or payable by
Purchaser and Merger Sub related to the transactions contemplated hereby
(collectively, the " _Financing_ "), including, without limitation: (i) using
reasonable best efforts to, as promptly as reasonably practicable, furnish to
Purchaser and the Financing Sources the Required Information and using
reasonable best efforts to furnish to Purchaser such limited financial data as
is customarily included in a registered offering of debt securities with
respect to an acquired business for which neither financial statements under
Item 3-05 of Regulation S-X nor pro forma financial statements under Article
11 of Regulation S-X are required to the extent reasonably requested by
Purchaser; (ii) using reasonable best efforts to cooperate with the marketing
efforts of Purchaser and the Financing Sources, including to participate in a
reasonable number of requested meetings with the parties acting as lead
arrangers or agents for, and prospective lenders and purchasers of, the
Financing and the APN Entities and any of their respective Affiliates senior
management and Representatives, presentations, roadshows, due
diligence sessions, drafting sessions and sessions with rating agencies in
connection with the Financing; (iii) using reasonable best efforts to cause
the APN Entities and their independent accountant, as reasonably requested,
to provide reasonable assistance to Purchaser consistent with their customary
practice (including to provide any "comfort letters" (including drafts

 



44  thereof) necessary and reasonably requested by Purchaser in connection with
any debt capital markets transaction comprising a part of the Financing (which
such accountants would be prepared to issue at the time of pricing and at
closing of any offering or placement of the Financing), in each case, on
customary terms and consistent with their customary practice) and to
participate in reasonable and customary due diligence sessions; and (iv) to
the extent that the APN Entities or any of their respective Affiliates are to
be party to the Financing following the occurrence of the Effective Time, (x)
facilitating the execution and delivery at the Closing of
definitive documents (including loan agreements, customary guarantee
documentation (if applicable) and other applicable loan documents) related to
the Financing, and (y) using reasonable best efforts to, to the extent
requested by the Financing Sources at least ten (10) Business Days prior to
the Closing Date, provide to the Financing Sources at least three (3) Business
Days prior to the Closing Date all customary and reasonable documentation and
other information required by regulatory authorities with respect to the APN
Entities under applicable "know your customer" and anti-money laundering rules
and regulations, including the USA PATRIOT Act of 2001, as amended; _provided_
, _however_ , that nothing in this _ Section_ __ _ 6.8_ shall require such
cooperation to the extent it would (A) unreasonably disrupt or interfere with
the business or operations of the APN Entities or the conduct thereof, (B)
require the APN Entities to pay any fees, incur or reimburse any costs or
expenses, or make any payment in connection with the Financing, prior to the
occurrence of the Effective Time (except to the extent Purchaser promptly
reimburses (in the case of ordinary course out-of-pocket costs and expenses)
or provides the funding (in all other cases) to the APN Entities), or incur
any liability in connection with the Financing that is effective prior to the
occurrence of the Effective Time, or (C) require the APN Entities to enter
into any instrument or agreement, or agree to any change or modification to
any instrument or agreement, that is effective prior to the occurrence of the
Effective Time or that would be effective if the Effective Time does not occur
(other than customary authorization letters in connection with any syndication
materials). Without limiting the foregoing proviso, Purchaser
agrees, promptly upon request, to reimburse the APN Entities for all of their
reasonable out-of-pocket costs, fees and expenses (including fees and
disbursements of counsel) in connection with the Financing promptly following
the incurrence thereof (but excluding any costs, fees and expenses of
preparing the Required Information set forth in _clauses (_ _i_ _)_ and
_(ii)_ of the definition thereof, which shall not be reimbursed). Purchaser
shall indemnify and hold harmless CP Blocker Seller, CP Blocker, the APN
Entities and their respective Affiliates, and its and their respective
Representatives, from and against any and all liabilities, obligations,
losses, damages, claims, costs, expenses, awards, judgments and penalties of
any type actually suffered or incurred by any of them in connection with any
action taken, or cooperation provided, by CP Blocker Seller, CP Blocker, the
APN Entities and their respective Affiliates or any of their respective
Representatives pursuant to this _ Section_ __ _ 6.8_ and/or the provision
of information utilized in connection therewith (other than
information provided in writing by any of the CP Blocker Seller, CP Blocker
or the APN Entities or their respective Affiliates specifically for use in
connection therewith); in each case, except to the extent that any such
obligations, losses, damages, claims, costs, expenses, awards, judgments and
penalties, fees, costs or other liabilities are suffered or incurred as a
result of the APN Entities or their Representatives gross negligence, willful
misconduct or material breach of this Agreement, as applicable. The Company
hereby consents to the use of its and the other APN Entities logos in
connection with the Financing, provided such logos are used solely in a
customary manner that is not intended to or reasonably likely to harm
or disparage the APN Entities or the reputation or

 



45  goodwill of the APN Entities and on such other customary terms and
conditions as the Company shall reasonably impose. Notwithstanding anything to
the contrary provided herein or in the Confidentiality Agreement, Purchaser
shall be permitted to share all information subject to such agreements with
its potential financing sources and their Representatives, subject to
customary confidentiality undertakings by such potential financing sources
with respect thereto.

(c) Purchaser and Merger Sub acknowledge and agree that obtaining the
Financing is not a condition to the Closing.

(c) The Seller Released Parties and the Purchaser Released Parties who are
contemplated to benefit from this _Section_ __ _ 7.4_ are expressly intended
to be third party beneficiaries of this _Section_ __ _ 7.4_.

 

7.5 _Directors  and Officers Indemnification_.

 

(a) From and after the Closing, Purchaser shall, or shall cause CP Blocker
and the Surviving Company to, indemnify, defend and hold harmless, to the
fullest extent permitted under applicable Law (but in no event more than as
set forth in the respective governing documents of CP Blocker or any APN
Entity as in effect as of immediately prior to 

 



47  the date hereof), the individuals who on or prior to the Closing were
directors, officers, managers, employees or agents of CP Blocker or any APN
Entity (the " _D andO Indemnified Parties_") with respect to all acts or
omissions by them in their capacities as such or as trustees or fiduciaries of
any plan for the benefit of employees of CP Blocker or any APN Entity or taken
at the request of CP Blocker or any APN Entity at any time prior to the
Closing.

(b) Purchaser agrees that all rights of the DandO Indemnified Parties to
indemnification and exculpation from liabilities for acts or omissions
occurring prior to the Closing as provided in the respective governing
documents of CP Blocker or any APN Entity as in effect as of immediately prior
to the date hereof shall survive the Closing and shall continue in full force
and effect in accordance with their terms. From and after the Closing for a
period of six (6) years following the Closing Date, Purchaser shall not, and
shall cause each of its Subsidiaries and Affiliates (including CP Blocker and
the APN Entities) not to, amend, repeal or otherwise modify the
indemnification provisions of any such Persons certificate of incorporation,
bylaws or other similar governing documents as in effect immediately prior to
the Closing in any manner that would adversely affect the rights thereunder of
the DandO Indemnified Parties. Purchaser shall pay all reasonable expenses,
including reasonable attorneys fees, that may be incurred by a DandO
Indemnified Party in enforcing the covenants set forth in this _Section_ __ _
7.4_.

 

(c) At or prior to the Closing, Purchaser shall, or shall cause CP Blocker
and the Surviving Company to, obtain, maintain and fully pay (subject to the
credit referenced below) for irrevocable "tail" insurance policies providing
coverage for those DandO Indemnified Parties who are covered by CP Blocker or
the APN Entities existing directors and officers liability insurance on or
prior to the Closing with a claims period of six (6) years from the Closing
Date from an insurance carrier with the same or better credit rating as the
current insurance carrier of CP Blocker or the APN Entities, as applicable,
with respect to directors and officers liability insurance in an amount and
scope at least as favorable as the existing policies of CP Blocker or the APN
Entities, as applicable, with respect to matters existing or occurring prior
to the Closing Date; _provided_ , _however_ , that on or after the Closing
Date, any prorated unearned premium relating to CP Blocker or the APN
Entities existing directors and officers liability insurance shall be paid
over or credited against any premium payable by Purchaser, CP Blocker and the
Surviving Company in connection with such "tail" insurance policies;
_provided_ , _further_ , that Purchaser, CP Blocker and the Surviving Company
shall not be required to pay for such "tail" insurance in an annual amount in
excess of Three Hundred Fifty percent (350%) of the annual premium currently
paid as of the date hereof by CP Blocker and the APN Entities for its and
their existing directors and officers liability insurance; _provided_ ,
_further_ , that if the annual premium of such insurance coverage exceed such
amount, Purchaser, CP Blocker and the Surviving Company shall be obligated to
obtain a policy with the greatest coverage available for a cost not exceeding
such maximum amount. Except as set forth herein, Purchaser shall not, and
shall cause CP Blocker and the APN Entities not to, cancel or change such
insurance policies in any respect.

(d) In the event Purchaser, CP Blocker, any APN Entity or any of their
respective successors or assigns, at any time during the six (6) year period
following the Closing Date, (i) consolidates with or merges into any other
Person and shall not be the continuing or surviving corporation or entity in
such consolidation or merger, or (ii) transfers all or substantially all of
its properties and assets to any Person, then and in either such case,
Purchaser

 



48  shall make proper provision so that the successors and assigns of Purchaser,
CP Blocker or the applicable APN Entities, as the case may be, shall assume
the obligations set forth in this  _Section_ __ _ 7.5_.

(e) The DandO Indemnified Parties who are contemplated to benefit from this
_Section_ __ _ 7.5_ are expressly intended to be third party beneficiaries of
this _Section_ __ _ 7.5_. The provisions of this _Section_ __ _ 7.5_ shall
survive (i) the consummation of the Closing for a period of six (6) years
following the Closing Date and (ii) with respect to any claim made prior to
the date contemplated by _clause (i)_ , until such claim is finally resolved.

 

7.6 _Post-Closing Record Retention and Access_. For a period of seven (7)
years after the Closing Date, Purchaser shall provide the Sellers
Representative and its authorized representatives with reasonable access (for
the purpose of examining and copying, at their own expense), during normal
business hours and upon reasonable advance notice, to any books and records
and other materials in the possession of CP Blocker or any of the APN Entities
relating to periods prior to the Closing Date solely in connection with any
Action relating to this Agreement, the other agreements contemplated hereby
and the transactions contemplated hereby or thereby, the preparation of Tax
Returns, amended Tax Returns or claims for refund and any Actions, the
preparation of financial statements including for periods ending on or prior
to the Closing Date, and the management and handling of any Action against
any third party other than Purchaser and/or its Affiliates (and any materials
necessary for the preparation of any of the foregoing), compliance with the
rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission or any other
Governmental Authority. Unless otherwise consented to in writing by the
Sellers Representative, Purchaser shall not, and shall cause each of CP
Blocker and the APN Entities not to, for a period of seven (7) years
following the Closing Date, destroy, alter or otherwise dispose of any books
and records and other materials of CP Blocker or any of the APN Entities, or
any portions thereof, relating to periods prior to the Closing Date without
first offering to surrender to the Sellers Representative such books and
records and materials or such portions thereof.

 

7.7 _Tax Matters_.

 

(a) _Additional Cooperation on Tax Matters_. From and after the Closing,
Purchaser, the Company, CP Blocker, CP Blocker Seller and Sellers
Representative shall cooperate fully and in good faith, as and to the extent
reasonably requested by any other Party, in connection with the preparation
and filing of any Tax Return and any audit, litigation or other proceeding
with respect to Taxes, including, without limitation, the extent such
cooperation is reasonably related to the preparation of Tax Returns pursuant
to _Section_ __ _ 7.7(c)_, the determination of or payment in respect of any
Tax Refund pursuant to _Section_ __ _ 7.7(d)_, and the determination of any
payment pursuant to _Section_ __ _ 7.7(h)_. Such cooperation shall include
the retention and (upon the other Partys request) the provision of records
and information which are reasonably relevant to any such Tax Return, audit,
litigation or other proceeding or any tax planning, as well as making
employees available on a mutually convenient basis to provide
additional information and explanation of any material provided hereunder.
Purchaser, the Company, CP Blocker and Sellers Representative further agree,
upon request, to use their reasonable best efforts to obtain any certificate
or other document from any Governmental Authority or any other Person as may
be necessary to mitigate, reduce or eliminate any Tax that

 



49  could be imposed in connection with the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement (including, but not limited to, any Transfer Taxes).

 

(b) _Tax Treatment_. Purchaser shall cause the taxable year of CP Blocker
to end on the Closing Date for U.S. federal income and applicable state Tax
purposes and shall cause CP Blocker to join Purchasers "consolidated group"
(as defined in Treasury Regulations Section 1.1502-76(h)) effective on the
day after the Closing Date. In preparing IRS Form 1065 (and any comparable
state or local form) of the Company for any Straddle Period, Purchaser shall
determine the distributive share of Company items allocable to any Unitholders
(other than CP Blocker) using an interim closing of the Companys books as of
the end of the day on the Closing Date, in accordance with _Section_ __ _
7.7(i)_, and treating any Transaction Tax Deductions reported on such Tax
Return as allocable to the portion of such Straddle Period ending at the end
of the day on the Closing Date to the extent permitted by applicable Law.
Further, to the extent permitted by applicable Law, the portion of the Pre-
Closing Reorganization that consists of the distribution by CP Blocker to CP
Blocker Seller of a direct or indirect interest in the Reorganized Entities
shall be treated as a redemption described in Section 302(b)(3) of the Code.

(c) _Preparation of Tax Returns_. Purchaser shall prepare and file,
or cause to be prepared and filed, all Tax Returns of any APN Entity or CP
Blocker for any Tax period that (i) ends on or before the Closing Date (but
for which the relevant Tax Return is not due until after the Closing Date) or
(ii) includes the Closing Date (the " _Seller Tax Returns_ "). Each Seller
Tax Return shall be prepared in accordance with the past practice of the APN
Entities and CP Blocker, unless otherwise required by Law, and shall report
the Transaction Tax Deductions as deductions thereon if permitted by
applicable Law. No later than thirty (30) days prior to the due date (subject
to any extension thereof) of any Seller Tax Return (or such shorter time as is
commercially reasonable), Purchaser shall provide to the Sellers
Representative a draft of such Seller Tax Return for the Sellers
Representatives review and comment. Purchaser shall make any changes
reasonably requested by the Sellers Representative in writing no later than
fifteen (15) days after receiving such draft Seller Tax Return (or such
shorter time as is commercially reasonable) provided that such changes are not
inconsistent with the past practice of the APN Entities or CP Blocker,
as applicable. No Seller Tax Return shall be filed without the consent of the
Sellers Representative (not to be unreasonably withheld, conditioned, or
delayed). For purposes of reporting the Tax consequences of the Pre-Closing
Reorganization (including calculating the amount of any gain recognized by CP
Blocker pursuant to Section 311(b) of the Code in connection with the
distribution by CP Blocker to CP Blocker Seller of a direct or indirect
interest in the Reorganized Entities owned by the Company), (i) the Company
shall (at the direction of the Sellers Representative) engage and instruct
Duff and Phelps (or another nationally recognized valuation firm) to prepare a
valuation of the interest in the Reorganized Entities owned by the Company,
(ii) the Company shall provide a copy of the valuation report to Purchaser and
(iii) unless the conclusion of such valuation report is demonstrably
incorrect (or is based on material facts that are demonstrably incorrect) and
Purchaser provides written notice thereof in specific detail to the Sellers
Representative no later than ten (10) days after receiving such valuation
report, the Seller Tax Returns shall be prepared and filed in a manner that
reflects the value for such interests specified in such valuation report.

 



50 (d) _Tax Refunds_. (i) CP Blocker Seller shall be entitled to any refunds
of income Taxes paid for any taxable period (or portion thereof) of CP Blocker
ending on or prior to the Closing Date (each, a " _CP Blocker Tax Refund_ ")
and (ii) CP Blocker Seller and the Unitholders (other than CP Blocker) shall
be entitled to any refunds of income Taxes paid for any taxable period (or
portion thereof) of the APN Entities ending on or prior to the Closing Date
(each, an " _APN Tax Refund_ " and, collectively with any CP Blocker Tax
Refunds, the " _Tax Refunds_ "), in each case along with any interest paid by
the relevant Taxing Authority with respect thereto. Purchaser shall use its
reasonable best efforts to obtain any Tax Refund that may be available
as promptly as reasonably practical, including by using any "quick refund" or
similar accelerated processes and amending any prior Tax Returns of CP Blocker
and the APN Entities to carryback any net operating loss (or similar item)
reflected on the Seller Tax Returns. Purchaser shall pay any Tax Refund
received by Purchaser or any of its Affiliates (including CP Blocker and the
APN Entities) to the CP Blocker Seller and the Sellers Representative (for
the benefit of and further distribution to the Unitholders, other than CP
Blocker) in accordance with the Payment Schedule, within five (5) Business
Days after receipt thereof, net of any reasonable documented out of pocket
expenses incurred in obtaining such Tax Refund. Purchaser shall not (and
shall cause its Affiliates, including CP Blocker and the APN Entities, not to)
elect to claim a Tax credit in lieu of a Tax Refund or fail to utilize any
available procedures to carryback any net operating loss or similar item
reported on a Seller Tax Return. If a Tax Refund is not available, but a
credit against Tax is available in lieu thereof, Purchaser shall pay the
amount of such credit to the CP Blocker Seller or the Sellers Representative
(on behalf of the Unitholders, other than CP Blocker), as applicable, within
five (5) Business Days after such credit is used to reduce any Taxes for a
Post-Closing Tax Period that Purchaser or any of its Affiliates (including CP
Blocker and the APN Entities) otherwise would have been required to pay. Upon
request of the Sellers Representative, Purchaser shall reasonably cooperate
to provide an update regarding the status of any amounts that may be payable
to CP Blocker Seller or the Sellers Representative pursuant to this
_Section_ __ _ 7.7(d)_. Such cooperation shall include the provision of such
information as the Sellers Representative shall reasonably request and making
Purchasers third-party advisors available for discussion.

(e) _Audits of Tax Returns_. Purchaser shall notify the Sellers
Representative promptly upon becoming aware of any audit or contest (and no
later than five (5) days after receiving written notice of such audit or
contest) regarding any Tax Return of CP Blocker or the APN Entities relating
to a Pre-Closing Tax Period or Straddle Period if such audit or contest (i)
relates to the amount or existence of a Tax Asset, (ii) otherwise would
reasonably be expected to affect the amount of any payment to CP Blocker
Seller or the Sellers Representative pursuant to _Section_ __ _ 7.7(d)_ or
_Section_ __ _ 7.7(h)_, or (iii) relates to any Tax Return reflecting income
or loss of an APN Entity that would "flow-through" to the Unitholders (each,
a " _Seller Tax Audit_ "). Sellers Representative shall have the right to
control each Seller Tax Audit; _provided_ , _however_ , that Purchaser will
have the right, directly or through its designated representatives and at
Purchasers sole cost and expense, to review in advance and comment upon all
submissions made in the course of any Seller Tax Audit (including any
administrative appeals thereof), the Sellers Representative shall keep
Purchaser reasonably notified regarding the progress of such Seller Tax Audit,
and the Sellers Representative shall not settle any Seller Tax Audit without
the consent of Purchaser (not to be unreasonable withheld, conditioned or
delayed). If (i) the Sellers Representative notifies Purchaser that it will
not control a Seller Tax Audit or (ii) the Seller Tax Audit is conducted
pursuant to the Internal Revenue Service 

 



51  Compliance Assurance Process, then Purchaser shall control such Seller Tax
Audit and the Sellers Representative shall have the rights described in the
preceding sentence _mutatis mutandis_.

(f) _Post-Closing Restrictions_. Without the prior written consent of
the Sellers Representative (which consent shall not be unreasonably
withheld, conditioned or delayed), Purchaser and its Affiliates (including CP
Blocker and the APN Entities) shall not (i) file any restatement or amendment
of, or modification to, any Tax Return of CP Blocker or the APN Entities for
any Pre-Closing Tax Period or Straddle Period (other than any such action
taken pursuant to _Section_ __ _ 7.7(d)_), (ii) extend or waive any statute
of limitations or other period for the assessment of any Tax or deficiency
related to a Pre-Closing Tax Period or Straddle Period of CP Blocker or an APN
Entity (other than any such action taken pursuant to _Section_ __ _
7.7(e)_), (iii) make or change any Tax election or accounting method that has
retroactive effect to any Pre-Closing Tax Period or Straddle Period of
CP Blocker or an APN Entity, (iv) voluntarily approach any Taxing Authority
or initiate any "voluntary disclosure" with respect to any Tax matter that
could affect any Pre-Closing Tax Period or Straddle Period of CP Blocker or
an APN Entity or (v) take any action after the Closing on the Closing Date
outside the ordinary course of business that would reasonably be expected to
result in taxable income or gain that would be allocated to the Unitholders;
provided, that, for the avoidance of doubt, the filing of a Tax Return in the
ordinary course of business for a Tax period beginning after the Closing Date
shall not, by and of itself, constitute a breach of this  _Section_ __ _
7.7(f)_.

(g) _Transfer Taxes_. All sales and transfer taxes, recording charges and
similar taxes, fees or charges imposed as a result of the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement (collectively, the " _Transfer Taxes_ "),
together with any interest, penalties or additions to such Transfer Taxes,
shall be borne by Purchaser. The Sellers Representative and Purchaser shall
cooperate in timely making all filings, returns, reports and forms as
necessary or appropriate to comply with the provisions of all applicable Laws
in connection with the payment of such Transfer Taxes, and shall cooperate in
good faith to minimize, to the fullest extent possible under such Laws, the
amount of any such Transfer Taxes payable in connection therewith.

(h) _Tax Assets_. On June 30, 2019, and on each of the first four (4)
anniversaries thereof, Purchaser shall pay to the Sellers Representative (on
behalf of CP Blocker Seller and the Unitholders, other than CP Blocker) an
amount equal to twenty percent (20%) of the product of (y) the total amount of
the Tax Assets and (z) the highest combined marginal federal and state income
tax rate applicable to a U.S. corporation utilizing a May 1 - April 30 fiscal
year for the fiscal year preceding such payment (assuming an average state tax
rate of five percent (5%) and without taking into account the deductibility
of state taxes for federal income tax purposes). For the avoidance of doubt,
such payments shall be made without regard to whether Purchaser or any of its
Affiliates use or benefit from the Tax Assets. _Section_ __ _ 1.13(e)_
notwithstanding, if any Tax Asset is reduced (in whole or in part) by a Taxing
Authority (on either a retroactive or prospective basis), Purchaser shall have
the right to offset any later payment pursuant to this _Section_ __ _
7.7(h)_ to take into account such reduction. The amount of any such offset
shall equal the product of (x) the amount of such reduction and (y) the
average of the tax rates used to determine the amount of prior payments
pursuant to this _Section_ __ _ 7.7(h)_. Further, and notwithstanding the
foregoing, Purchaser may offset any later payment pursuant to this

 



52   _Section_ __ _ 7.7(h)_ by the amount of any Taxes (in the case of any
state or local Taxes, net of any federal benefit) paid after the Closing Date
by Purchaser or any of its Affiliates in respect of a Pre-Closing Tax Period
of CP Blocker or any APN Entity (including, but not limited to, any such Taxes
resulting from the Pre-Closing Reorganization), in connection with the filing
of any Tax Return pursuant to _Section_ __ _ 7.7(c)_ or pursuant to any
audit, deficiency or other proceeding initiated by a Taxing Authority. If the
amount of any payment pursuant to this _Section_ __ _ 7.7(h)_ will be
reduced by Purchaser pursuant to the preceding sentence or the third preceding
sentence, Purchaser shall use its commercially reasonable efforts to provide
written notice to the Sellers Representative no later than June 10 of the
year of such reduced payment, together with a reasonable description of the
basis for and facts relating to such anticipated reduction in payment.

 

(i) _Straddle Periods_. In the case of any Straddle Period, the amount of
Taxes allocable to the portion of the Straddle Period ending on the Closing
Date (which portion shall constitute a Pre-Closing Tax Period) shall be deemed
to be (i) in the case of Taxes imposed on a periodic basis (such as real or
personal property Taxes), the amount of such Taxes for the entire period
multiplied by a fraction, the numerator of which is the number of calendar
days in the Straddle Period ending on and including the Closing Date and the
denominator of which is the number of calendar days in the entire relevant
Straddle Period and (ii) in the case of Taxes not described in _clause (_ _i_
_)_ (such as Taxes that are based upon or related to income or receipts, based
upon occupancy or imposed in connection with any sale or other transfer or
assignment or property (real or personal, tangible or intangible)), the amount
of any such Taxes shall be determined based on an interim closing of the books
as if such taxable period ended as of the end of the day on the Closing Date.

7.8 _Disclaimer_. Each of Purchaser and Merger Sub hereby agree
and acknowledge that, except as expressly set forth in _Article 2_ , _Article
3_ and _Article 4_ or in any Letter of Transmittal delivered pursuant to
_Section_ __ _ 1.8_, none of the CP Blocker Parties, the Unitholders or any
APN Entity or any other person (including, any equityholder, member, officer,

individual, corporate or any other capacity) makes any representation or
warranty, express or implied, at law or in equity and any such other
representations or warranties are hereby expressly disclaimed. Each of
Purchaser and Merger Sub hereby agree and acknowledge that, notwithstanding
anything to the contrary herein, (i) none of the CP Blocker Parties, the
Unitholders or any APN Entity or any other person (including, any

foregoing, whether in any individual, corporate or any other capacity) shall
be deemed to make to Purchaser or Merger Sub any representation or warranty
other than as expressly made by such Person in this Agreement or by such
Person delivering a Letter of Transmittal pursuant to _Section_ __ _ 1.8_ and
(ii) none of the CP Blocker Parties, the Unitholders or any APN Entity or any
other person (including, any equityholder, member, officer, director, employee
or agent of any of the foregoing, whether in any individual, corporate or any
other capacity) makes any representation or warranty to Purchaser or Merger
Sub with respect to (A) any projections, estimates or budgets heretofore
delivered to or made available to Purchaser, Merger Sub or their respective
counsels, accountants or advisors of future revenues, expenses or
expenditures or future results of operations of CP Blocker or the APN Entities
or any member thereof, (B) except as covered by a representation and warranty
contained in _Article 2_ , any other information or documents (financial or

53  counsels, accountants or advisors with respect to the CP Blocker Parties,

their properties, assets, liabilities, businesses, operations or otherwise
(other than representations solely made as of the date hereof with respect to
the last sentence of _Section_ __ _ 2.3_); _provided_ , for the avoidance of
doubt, this _clause (C)_ shall not affect (x) the allocation of liability
set forth in _Section_ __ _ 7.11_ or (y) any representation regarding the
Company or any of its Subsidiaries (other than the Reorganized Entities).
All representations and warranties set forth in this Agreement are
contractual in nature only and subject to the sole and exclusive remedies set
forth herein. NONE OF THE COMPANY, ANY OTHER APN ENTITY, ANY UNITHOLDER, ANY
CP BLOCKER PARTY OR ANY OTHER PERSON (INCLUDING, ANY EQUITYHOLDER, MEMBER,
OFFICER, DIRECTOR, EMPLOYEE OR AGENT OF ANY OF THE FOREGOING, WHETHER IN ANY
INDIVIDUAL, CORPORATE OR ANY OTHER CAPACITY) MAKES OR PROVIDES, AND PURCHASER
AND MERGER SUB HEREBY WAIVES, ANY WARRANTY OR REPRESENTATION, EXPRESS OR
IMPLIED, AS TO THE QUALITY, MERCHANTABILITY, FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE,
CONFORMITY TO SAMPLES, OR CONDITION OF THE APN ENTITIES OR CP BLOCKERS
ASSETS OR ANY PART THEREOF. EACH PURCHASER AND MERGER SUB SPECIFICALLY
ACKNOWLEDGES AND AGREES THAT (X) PURCHASER IS ACQUIRING THE APN ENTITIES AND
CP BLOCKER ON AN "AS IS, WHERE IS" BASIS AND (Y) NONE OF THE COMPANY, ANY
UNITHOLDER, ANY CP BLOCKER PARTY OR ANY OTHER PERSON (INCLUDING, ANY
EQUITYHOLDER, MEMBER, OFFICER, DIRECTOR, EMPLOYEE OR AGENT OF ANY OF THE
FOREGOING, WHETHER IN ANY INDIVIDUAL, CORPORATE OR ANY OTHER CAPACITY) IS
MAKING, AND, EXCEPT FOR THOSE REPRESENTATIONS AND WARRANTIES EXPRESSLY SET
FORTH IN  _ARTICLE_ __ _ 2_, _ARTICLE_ __ _ 3_ AND _ARTICLE_ __ _ 4_ OF
THIS AGREEMENT, NEITHER PURCHASER NOR MERGER SUB IS RELYING ON, ANY
REPRESENTATIONS, WARRANTIES, OR OTHER STATEMENTS OF ANY KIND WHATSOEVER,
WHETHER ORAL OR WRITTEN, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, STATUTORY OR OTHERWISE, AS TO ANY
MATTER CONCERNING ANY OF THE APN ENTITIES OR CP BLOCKER, THIS AGREEMENT OR THE
TRANSACTIONS CONTEMPLATED HEREBY, OR THE ACCURACY OR COMPLETENESS OF
ANY INFORMATION PROVIDED TO (OR OTHERWISE ACQUIRED BY) PURCHASER, MERGER SUB
OR ANY OF THEIR DIRECTORS, OFFICERS, EMPLOYEES, ADVISERS, AGENTS OR
REPRESENTATIVES.

 

7.9 _Certain Employee and Employee Benefits Matters_.

 

(a) For one (1) year following the Closing Date, Purchaser or an Affiliate
thereof shall provide each employee of each APN Entity who continues to be
employed by an APN Entity, Purchaser, the Surviving Company or any of their
respective Affiliates with not less than equal salary or hourly wage rate and
annual target cash incentive opportunities as provided to such employee
immediately prior to the Closing Date, and with employee benefits (excluding
equity or equity-based arrangements and any defined benefits) that are
substantially similar in the aggregate to those provided for such employees as
of the Closing Date. For the avoidance of doubt, the employee benefits shall
not include any stock appreciation rights, phantom stock or equity or equity-
based awards and, for purposes of determining whether the group employee
benefits are "substantially similar in the aggregate" to those provided to
the employees immediately prior to the Closing Date, the value or any stock
appreciation rights,

 



54  phantom stock or other equity or equity-based awards shall not be included.
Purchaser further agrees that, from and after the Closing Date, Purchaser
shall and shall cause the Surviving Company, each APN Entity and each of
their respective Affiliates to grant all of such employees credit for any
service with an APN Entity earned prior to the Closing Date (i) for
eligibility and vesting purposes and (ii) for purposes of vacation accrual
and severance benefit determinations under any benefit or compensation plan,
program, policy, agreement or arrangement in which employees are eligible to
participate following the Closing Date (except any defined benefit) (the "
_New Plans_ "); _provided_ , _however_ , that such service shall not be
credited to the extent that it would result in a duplication of benefits. In
addition, Purchaser and the Surviving Company shall (A) cause to be waived
all pre-existing condition exclusions and actively-at-work requirements and
similar limitations, eligibility waiting periods and evidence of insurability
requirements under any New Plans to the extent waived or satisfied by an
employee or his or her dependents under any Employee Plan as of the Closing
Date and (B) cause any deductible, co-insurance and covered out-of-pocket
expenses paid on or before the Closing Date with respect to the plan year in
which the Closing occurs by any employee (or covered dependent thereof) of
any APN Entity to be taken into account for purposes of satisfying the
corresponding deductible, coinsurance and maximum out-of-pocket provisions
after the Closing Date under any applicable New Plan in the year of initial
participation. Purchaser agrees that Purchaser, the Surviving Company and the
APN Entities (following the Closing) shall be solely responsible for
satisfying the continuation coverage requirements of Section 4980B of the Code
for all individuals who are "MandA qualified beneficiaries" as such term is
defined in Treasury Regulation Section 54.4980B-9.

 

(b) Nothing contained in this _Section_ __ _ 7.9_, express or implied, (i)
shall constitute an amendment to or any other modification of any New Plan,
Employee Plan or other employee benefit plan maintained by Purchaser or any of
its Affiliates, (ii) shall limit the right of Purchaser to amend, terminate or
otherwise modify any New Plan, Employee Plan or other employee benefit plan
maintained by Purchaser or any of its Affiliates following the Closing Date,
or (iii) shall create any third-party beneficiary rights in any Person who is
not a Party.

 

7.10 _Consents_. Each of Purchaser and Merger Sub acknowledges that
certain consents to the transactions contemplated by this Agreement may be
required from parties to contracts, leases, licenses or other agreements to
which any APN Entity is a party (including the contracts set forth on
_Schedule_ __ _ 2.9(a)_) and such consents may not have been obtained prior
to Closing. Each of Purchaser and Merger Sub agrees and acknowledges that none
of the Company, CP Blocker Parties or Unitholders will have any liability
whatsoever to Purchaser or Merger Sub (or the Surviving Company following the
Closing) (and neither Purchaser nor Merger Sub (or the Surviving Company
following the Closing) will be entitled to assert any claims) arising out of
or relating to the failure to obtain any consents that may be required in
connection with the transactions contemplated by this Agreement or because of
the default, acceleration or termination of any such contract, lease, license
or other agreement as a result thereof.

 

7.11 _Pre-Closing Reorganization_. From and after the Closing, none
of Purchaser, Merger Sub, the Company or the other APN Entities owned
directly or indirectly by Purchaser shall be obligated under, nor shall said
Persons be, or become liable for any obligation, Contract, debt or liability
of any of the Reorganized Entities, except, in each case, for those

 



55  obligations, debts or liability of an APN Entity arising out of (x) the Co-
Manufacturing Agreements (or any co-manufacturing arrangement entered into
between an APN Entity and any Reorganized Entity on a purchase order basis)
and (y) any other Contract entered into among Purchaser, Merger Sub, the
Company, the other APN Entities or any of their Affiliates, on the one hand,
and the Reorganized Entities or any of their Affiliates, on the other hand,
from and after the Closing. The Pre-Closing Reorganization shall not reduce
the amount of the Tax Assets by more than Five Million Dollars ($5,000,000);
_provided_ , that if the Pre-Closing Reorganization reduces the amount of the
Tax Assets by more than such amount (such excess, the " _Excess Tax Asset
Reduction Amount_ "), then (i) such aggregate reduction in Tax Assets shall,
for the avoidance of doubt and in accordance with _Section_ __ _ 7.7(h)_, be
taken into account in determining the amount of payments to be made to the
Sellers Representative pursuant to _Section_ __ _ 7.7(h)_, except that (ii)
the corresponding reduction in the amount of payments to be made to the
Sellers Representative shall, to the extent attributable to the Excess Tax
Asset Reduction Amount, be applied to reduce the first payment to which the
Sellers Representative would otherwise be entitled pursuant to  _Section_ __
_ 7.7(h)_ (rather than ratably reducing payments over the five (5) year
period specified therein).

60 ARTICLE 10

 

 _MISCELLANEOUS_

 

10.1 _No Survival_. The representations, warranties, covenants and
agreements of the Parties contained in this Agreement shall terminate as of
and shall not survive beyond the Closing for all purposes, including any right
to damages under any theory or cause of action, and there shall be no
liability in respect thereof, including but not limited to liability for any
inaccuracy, misrepresentation, breach of, default in, or failure to perform
any such representations, warranties, covenants or agreements whether such
liability has accrued prior to, on or after the Closing, on the part of any
Party, its Affiliates or any of its or their respective partners, members,
officers, directors, employees, agents or representatives, except for (i)
those covenants and agreements to the extent that by their terms apply or are
to be performed in whole or in part at or after the Closing (including, for
the avoidance of doubt, _Section_ __ _ 7.11_), which shall survive in
accordance with their respective terms, until performed or otherwise, and (ii)
_ Article 10_.

 

10.2 _Sellers  Representative_.

 

(a) At the Closing, CP APN, L.P. shall be constituted and appointed as the
Sellers Representative. For purposes of this Agreement, the term "Sellers
Representative" shall mean the representative, true and lawful agent, proxy
and attorney-in-fact of the CP Blocker Seller and the Unitholders (other than
CP Blocker) for all purposes of this Agreement and the Escrow Agreement, with
full power and authority on such Persons behalf to: (i) consummate the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement, (ii) pay such Persons expenses
(whether incurred on or after the date hereof) incurred in connection with the
negotiation and performance of this Agreement, (iii) receive, give receipt and
disburse any funds received hereunder on behalf of such Person and to
holdback from disbursement any such funds to the extent it reasonably
determines may be necessary, (iv) execute and deliver any certificates
representing the CP Blocker Stock and/or Acquired Units, if any, and execute
such further instruments as Purchaser shall reasonably request, (v) execute
and deliver on behalf of such Person all documents contemplated herein and any
amendment or waiver hereto, (vi) take all other actions to be taken by or
on behalf of such Person in connection herewith, (vii) negotiate, settle,
compromise and otherwise handle all disputes under this Agreement, including
without limitation, disputes pursuant to _Section_ __ _ 1.13_, (viii) waive
any condition to the obligation of such Person to consummate the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement, (ix) give and receive notices on behalf of
such Person and (x) do each and every act and exercise any and all rights
which such Person is, or the CP Blocker Seller and/or Unitholders (other than
CP Blocker) collectively are, permitted or required to do or exercise under
this Agreement. The CP Blocker Seller and the Unitholders (other than CP
Blocker), by approving the principal terms of the Merger and/or accepting the
consideration payable to them hereunder, irrevocably grant unto said attorney-
in-fact and agent full power and authority to do and perform each and every
act and thing necessary or desirable to be done in connection with the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement, as fully to all intents and
purposes as the CP Blocker Seller or such Unitholders (other than CP Blocker)
might or could do in person. The CP Blocker Seller and each of the Unitholders
(other than CP Blocker) agrees that such agency and proxy are coupled with an
interest, are therefore irrevocable without the consent of the Sellers
Representative and shall

 



61  survive the death, incapacity or bankruptcy of the CP Blocker Seller or any
such Unitholder (other than CP Blocker) and shall further survive the Closing.

 

(b) All decisions, actions, consents and instructions of the Sellers
Representative shall be final and binding upon the CP Blocker Seller and all
of the Unitholders (other than CP Blocker) and none of the CP Blocker Seller
or any such Unitholder shall have any right to object, dissent, protest or
otherwise contest the same, except in the case of fraud or bad faith by the
Sellers Representative. Purchaser, Merger Sub and the Surviving Company shall
be entitled to rely on all such decisions, actions, consents and instructions
of the Sellers Representative as being the binding actions of CP Blocker
Seller and all of the Unitholders (other than CP Blocker). Neither the
Sellers Representative nor any officer, director, employee or agent of
Sellers Representative shall incur any liability to the CP Blocker Seller or
any Unitholder relating to the performance of its duties hereunder except for
actions or omissions by the Sellers Representative or such agent constituting

or any Unitholder, except in respect of amounts actually received on behalf of
the CP Blocker Seller or any such Unitholder.

 

(c) The CP Blocker Seller and the Unitholders shall cooperate with the
Sellers Representative and any accountants, attorneys or other agents whom
the Sellers Representative may retain to assist in carrying out Sellers
Representatives duties hereunder. The CP Blocker Seller and the Unitholders
(other than CP Blocker) shall reimburse the Sellers Representative for all
costs and expenses incurred, including professional fees, on a pro rata basis,
based on the amount the CP Blocker Seller or each such Unitholder (other than
CP Blocker) would have borne of such costs and expenses had such costs and
expenses been deducted from the Aggregate Final Consideration prior to such
Aggregate Final Consideration being distributed pursuant to the Payment
Schedule.

obligations in connection with this Agreement and the transactions
contemplated hereby. The Sellers Representative shall, as and when determined
by the Sellers Representative in its sole discretion, pay (i) the Unitholders

each case, in accordance with the Payment Schedule.

 

(f) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this _Section_ __ _ 10.1_,
(x) no power of attorney shall be granted to the Sellers Representative on
behalf of any of the CP Blocker Parties or any other Unitholder affiliated
with _L_ Catterton Partners and (y) to the

_Section_ __ _ 10.1_ would have an effect that is disproportionately adverse
to any CP Blocker Party or any other Unitholder affiliated with _L_ Catterton
Partners, as compared to the effect of such action on the Unitholders (other
than CP Blocker), such action shall be subject to the prior written approval
of the CP Blocker Seller.

Entities, the Surviving Company or any of their respective Affiliates, on the
one hand, and the Sellers Representative or any of its Affiliates, on the
other hand, Sellers Counsel may represent the Sellers Representative or any
of its Affiliates in such dispute even though the interests of the Sellers
Representative or any of its Affiliates may be directly adverse to Purchaser,
any APN Entity, the Surviving Company, CP Blocker or any of their respective
Affiliates and even though Sellers Counsel may have represented CP Blocker or
any APN Entity in a matter substantially related to such dispute, and each of
Purchaser, CP Blocker and the Company hereby waive on behalf of itself and
its respective Affiliates, any conflict of interest in connection with such
representation by Sellers Counsel. Each of Purchaser and the Company further

rights to any evidentiary privilege (if and to the extent such privileges and
rights have not otherwise been expressly waived in writing by the Sellers
Representative) belong to the Sellers Representative and its Affiliates
(the " _Privileged Communications_ "), as applicable, and may be controlled
by the Sellers Representative and its Affiliates and shall not pass to or be
claimed by Purchaser, the APN Entities, the Surviving Company or any of
their respective Affiliates. Each of Purchaser, CP Blocker and the Company
hereby agree, on behalf of itself and its respective Affiliates, that no such
Person may use or rely on any of the Privileged Communications, whether

other APN Entity or the Surviving Company, or otherwise, in any action against
or involving any of the Parties after the Closing; and each of Purchaser, CP
Blocker and the Company agree, on behalf of itself and its respective

of any other provisions, whether or not similar, nor shall any waiver

for which money damages or other legal remedies would not be an adequate
remedy, would occur if any provision of this Agreement were not performed in
accordance with the terms hereof. Accordingly, the Parties acknowledge and
hereby agree that in the event of any breach or threatened breach of this
Agreement, each Party will be entitled to an injunction or injunctions to
prevent or restrain breaches or threatened breaches of this Agreement by any
other Party hereto, and to specifically enforce the terms and provisions of
this Agreement to prevent breaches or threatened breaches of, or to enforce

hereby agree not to raise any objections to the availability of the equitable
remedy of specific performance to prevent or restrain breaches or threatened
breaches of this Agreement. The Parties each hereby waive (i) any defenses in
any Action for specific performance, including the defense that a remedy at
law would be adequate, and (ii) any requirement under any Law to post a bond
or other security as a prerequisite to obtaining equitable relief. In the
event a Party prevails in any Action commenced to enforce the terms of this
Agreement, all fees, costs and expenses, including reasonable attorneys fees
and court costs, incurred by the such Party in such Action will be reimbursed

THIS AGREEMENT, THE DEBT FINANCING COMMITMENTS OR ANY TRANSACTION CONTEMPLATED
HEREBY (INCLUDING, FOR THE AVOIDANCE OF DOUBT, THE DEBT FINANCING). EACH PARTY
(A) CERTIFIES THAT NO REPRESENTATIVE, AGENT OR ATTORNEY OF ANY OTHER PARTY
HAS REPRESENTED, EXPRESSLY OR OTHERWISE, THAT SUCH OTHER PARTY WOULD NOT, IN
THE EVENT OF LITIGATION, SEEK TO ENFORCE THE FOREGOING WAIVER AND (B)
ACKNOWLEDGES THAT IT AND THE OTHER PARTIES HAVE BEEN INDUCED TO ENTER INTO
THIS AGREEMENT, BY, AMONG OTHER THINGS, THE MUTUAL WAIVERS AND CERTIFICATIONS

and irrevocably agrees that (i) any Action, whether in contract or tort, at
law or in equity or otherwise, involving any Financing Source arising out of,
or relating to, the transactions contemplated by this Agreement (including
the Debt Financing, Debt Financing Commitments or the Financing) shall be
subject to the exclusive jurisdiction of the Supreme Court of the State of New
York, County of New York, or if under applicable Law exclusive jurisdiction
is vested in the federal courts, the United States District Court for the

property with respect to any such Action to the exclusive jurisdiction of such

Affiliates to bring or support any such Action in any other court and (ii)
that any such Action shall be governed by, and construed in accordance with,
the laws of the State of New York without regard to the conflicts of law rules

State. 

10.16 _Disclosure Schedules_. The information set forth in each section or
subsection of the Disclosure Schedules shall be deemed to provide the
information contemplated by, or otherwise qualify, the provisions of this
Agreement set forth in the corresponding section or subsection of this

68 10.17 _Non-Recourse_.

 

(a) This Agreement may only be enforced against, and any claim or suit
based upon, arising out of, or related to this Agreement, or the negotiation,
execution or performance of this Agreement, may only be brought against the
named parties to this Agreement and then only with respect to the specific
obligations set forth herein with respect to the named parties to this
Agreement (in all cases, as limited by _Section_ __ _ 10.1_). No Person who
is not a named Party to this Agreement, including any past, present or future
director, officer, employee, incorporator, member, partner,
stockholder, Affiliate, agent, attorney or representative of the Company, CP
Blocker Parties or any of their respective Affiliates, or any Financing
Source, will have or be subject to any liability (whether in contract or in
tort) to Purchaser or any other Person resulting from (i) the distribution
of, or reliance on, any information, documents, projections, forecasts or
other material made available in certain "data rooms," confidential
information memoranda or management presentations in expectation of, or in
connection with, the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, or (ii) any
claim based on, in respect of, or by reason of, the sale and purchase of the
Company or CP Blocker, in each case, regardless of the legal theory under
which such liability or obligation may be sought to be imposed, whether
sounding in contract or tort, or whether at law or in equity, or otherwise;
and each Party waives and releases all such liabilities and obligations
against any such Persons; _provided_ , _however_ , that nothing in this
_Section_ __ _ 10.17_ shall prevent claims (x) against a Unitholder, CP
Blocker Seller or LCP VII for Fraud committed by any such Unitholder, CP
Blocker Seller or LCP VII, as applicable, or (y) pursuant to other Contracts
between the Parties or such Persons; _provided_ , _further_ , that nothing in
this _Section_ __ _ 10.17_ shall in any way limit or modify the rights
and obligations of any Debt Financing Sources obligations to Purchaser under
the Debt Financing Commitments. The Company, on behalf of itself and its
Affiliates, agrees that the Financing Sources shall be subject to no liability
or claims by the Company or its Affiliates (other than the Purchaser and its
pre-Closing Affiliates), whether at law, or equity, in contract, in tort or
otherwise, relating to or arising out of this Agreement, any breach of the
Debt Financing Commitments or in connection with the Debt Financing or the
performance of services by the Financing Sources with respect to the
foregoing. In no event shall the Company be entitled to seek the remedy of
specific performance of this Agreement against the Financing Sources.

(b) In connection with the investigation by Purchaser and Merger Sub of
the APN Entities and CP Blocker, Purchaser and Merger Sub received or may
receive from the APN Entities and CP Blocker certain projections, forward-
looking statements and other forecasts and certain business plan information.
Each of Purchaser and Merger Sub acknowledges that there are uncertainties
inherent in attempting to make such estimates, projections and other forecasts
and plans, that Purchaser and Merger Sub are familiar with such uncertainties,
that Purchaser and Merger Sub are taking full responsibility for making its
own evaluation of the adequacy and accuracy of all estimates, projections and
other forecasts and plans so furnished to it (including the reasonableness of
the assumptions underlying such estimates, projections, forecasts or plans),
and that Purchaser and Merger Sub will have no claim against anyone with
respect thereto. Accordingly, each of Purchaser and Merger Sub acknowledges
that neither the Company, any CP Blocker Party, nor any member, officer,
director, employee or agent of any of the foregoing, whether in an individual,
corporate or any other capacity, make any representation, warranty, or other
statement with respect to, and neither Purchaser nor Merger Sub is
relying on, such estimates, projections, forecasts or plans (including

 



69  the reasonableness of the assumptions underlying such estimates,
projections, forecasts or plans), and each of Purchaser and Merger Sub agrees
that it has not relied thereon.

 

10.18 _Guarantee_. To induce the Company and CP Blocker Seller to enter
into this Agreement, the Guarantor irrevocably and unconditionally guarantees
to the Company and CP Blocker Seller (a) the due and punctual payment of
Purchasers (and any of its permitted assignees) obligations set forth in
this Agreement, including _Sections 1.8_ , _1.10_ , _1.13_ and _7.7_ , the
reimbursement and indemnification obligations set forth in this Agreement,
including _Section_ __ _ 6.8_, and any other obligations set forth in this
Agreement and (b) the performance of Purchaser and Merger Sub, and each of
their respective permitted assignees, hereunder (the " _Guaranteed
Obligations_ "), subject to the conditions hereunder. If, for any reason
whatsoever, Purchaser or Merger Sub (or any of their respective permitted
assignees) shall fail or be unable to duly, punctually and fully pay or
perform the Guaranteed Obligations, Guarantor will forthwith pay and cause to
be paid in lawful currency of the United States, or perform or cause to be
performed, the Guaranteed Obligations. This guarantee is one of payment, not
collection, and a separate Action or Actions may be brought and prosecuted
against the Guarantor to enforce this guarantee, irrespective of whether any
action is brought against Purchaser, Merger Sub, any permitted assignee of
Purchaser or Merger Sub, the Guarantor or any other guarantor now or hereafter
liable with respect to the Guaranteed Obligations, or whether Purchaser,
Merger Sub, any permitted assignee of Purchaser or Merger Sub or any other
guarantor is joined in any such Action. The Guarantor hereby irrevocably and
unconditionally waives any and all notice of the creation, renewal, extension
or accrual of any of the Guaranteed Obligations and notice of or proof of
reliance by the Company or CP Blocker Seller upon this guarantee or acceptance
of this guarantee (other than notices to be provided to Purchaser or Merger
Sub (or their respective permitted assignees) pursuant to this Agreement).
The Guaranteed Obligations, and any of them, shall conclusively be deemed to
have been created, contracted or incurred in reliance upon this guarantee, and
all dealings between Purchaser, Merger Sub or the Guarantor (or any permitted
assignee of Merger Sub or Purchaser), on the one hand, and the Company or CP
Blocker Seller, on the other hand, shall likewise be conclusively presumed to
have been had or consummated in reliance upon this guarantee. When pursuing
its rights and remedies hereunder against the Guarantor, the Company and CP
Blocker Seller shall be under no obligation to pursue such rights and remedies
it may have against Purchaser (or any permitted assignee thereof) or any other
Person for the Guaranteed Obligations or any right of offset with respect
thereto, and any failure by the Company or CP Blocker Seller to pursue such
other rights or remedies or to collect any payments from Purchaser or any such
other Person or to realize upon or to exercise any such right of offset shall
not relieve the Guarantor of any liability hereunder, and shall not impair or
affect the rights and remedies, whether express, implied or available as a
matter of law, of the Company or CP Blocker Seller. The Company and CP
Blocker Seller shall not be obligated to file any claim relating to any
Guaranteed Obligation in the event that Purchaser or Merger Sub (or any of
their respective permitted assignees) becomes subject to a
bankruptcy, reorganization or similar Action, and the failure of the Company
and CP Blocker Seller to so file shall not affect the Guarantors obligations
hereunder. In the event that any payment to the Company or CP Blocker Seller
in respect of any Guaranteed Obligation is rescinded or must otherwise be
returned for any reason whatsoever, this guarantee shall continue to be
effective or be reinstated, as the case may be, and the Guarantor shall remain
liable hereunder with respect to the Guaranteed Obligation as if such payment
had not been made. In the event the Guarantor consolidates with or merges with
any other Person and is not the continuing or surviving entity

 



70  of such consolidation or merger, then, and in each such case, the Company
and CP Blocker Seller (acting jointly and not individually) may seek recourse,
whether by the enforcement of any judgment or assessment or by any equitable
or Action or by virtue of any Law, against such continuing or surviving entity
or such Person (in either case, a " _Successor Entity_ "), as the case may be,
but only to the extent of the unpaid liability hereunder up to the portion of
the amount of the Guaranteed Obligations for which the Guarantor is liable, as
determined in accordance with this guarantee. As used herein, unless otherwise
specified, the term Guarantor shall include the Guarantors Successor Entity.
