SECTION 3. 
  _CONSIDERATION_  

   

 SECTION 3.1. _Purchase Price_. The aggregate purchase price for the Purchased Assets shall be an amount equal to Four Hundred Eighty Five Million Dollars ($485,000,000) (the "Purchase Price"), and the assumption by Buyers at the Closing of the Assumed Liabilities. At the Closing, Buyers shall pay the Purchase Price by wire transfer of immediately available funds to such account as Sellers may reasonably direct by written notice delivered to Buyers by Sellers at least two (2) Business Days prior to the Closing Date. Buyers and Sellers acknowledge and agree that no amount of the Purchase Price is received, receivable or allocated explicitly to the covenants contained in Section 8.2.9. 

  

 SECTION 3.2. _Purchase Price Adjustment_. 

   

 (a) _Audited Balance Sheet Preparation_. No later than 60 days after the Closing Date, Sellers shall deliver to Buyers a balance sheet of the Sold Business dated as of the Closing Date audited by Ernst and Young (the "Independent Auditors") in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (the "Audited Balance Sheet"). The Audited Balance Sheet will be prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles using Sellers historical internal accounting practices and prepared in a manner consistent with the Balance Sheet. Audited Balance Sheet items listed on Schedule 3.2(a) will be estimated consistent with the methodology set forth in Schedule 3.2(a) which is consistent with the methodology used in preparation of the Financial Statements (as defined in Section 4.5). As part of the preparation of the Audited Balance Sheet, Buyers shall have the right to jointly conduct with Sellers a complete physical inventory of the Sold Business as of the Closing Date and the results thereof shall be reflected in the Audited Balance Sheet. The Audited Balance Sheet shall fairly present in all material respects the financial position of the Sold Business as of the Closing Date. Buyers and Sellers shall equally share the cost of the preparation and audit of the Audited Balance Sheet. 

   

 (b) _Audited Balance Sheet Review_. All work papers, documents and records used or generated by Sellers and the Independent Auditors in connection with the 

   ##### 

  

    

preparation of the Audited Balance Sheet, along with access to Sellers
accountants and management personnel, will be made available to Buyers.
Unless Buyers give Sellers written notice of their objection by the thirtieth
(30th) day after Buyers receipt of the Audited Balance Sheet, the Audited
Balance Sheet will become final and binding on the parties and will be deemed
to be the "Final Balance Sheet." 

   

 (c) _Audited Balance Sheet Dispute_. If Buyers object (as provided in the last sentence of Section 3.2(b)) to the Audited Balance Sheet and Buyers and Sellers are able to resolve their dispute within fifteen (15) days after Sellers receipt of Buyers written objection, the Audited Balance Sheet (reflecting the resolution) will be final and binding on the parties and will be deemed to be the "Final Balance Sheet." If Buyers object (as provided in the last sentence of Section 3.2(b)) to the Audited Balance Sheet and Buyers and Sellers are unable to resolve their dispute within fifteen (15) days after Sellers receipt of Buyers written objection, the dispute will be resolved by Price Waterhouse Coopers or any other mutually acceptable certified public accounting firm (the "Independent Accountants"). The Independent Accountants will be instructed to perform their services as expeditiously as possible. The resolution of the Independent Accountants shall be presented in an "Arbitrators Award Report," prepared by the Independent Accountants, which shall be final and binding on the parties. Buyers and Sellers shall each be given the opportunity to submit any documents to the Independent Accountants, with a copy to the other party, which that party believes will assist the Independent Accountant in the production of the Arbitrators Award Report. The decision of the Independent Accountants as reflected in the Arbitrators Award Report shall be reflected in a Final Balance Sheet to be issued by Sellers as soon as possible thereafter. 

   

 (d) _Cost of Independent Accountants_. The fees and expenses of the Independent Accountants for the resolution of the dispute shall be shared equally by Buyers and Sellers. 

   

 (e) _Working Capital Adjustment_. The Purchase Price shall be subject to adjustment as follows ("Working Capital Adjustment"): If Working Capital is less than the Target Working Capital, the Purchase Price shall be decreased in amount equal to the difference between the Target Working Capital and the amount of the Working Capital. If the Working Capital is greater than the Target Working Capital, the Purchase Price shall be increased in an amount equal to the difference between the amount of the Working Capital and the Target Working Capital. As used herein, "Working Capital" is defined as current assets (included in Purchased Assets) less current liabilities (included in Assumed Liabilities), as reflected on the Final Balance Sheet. Payments owed to either Buyers or Sellers as a result of the Working Capital Adjustment shall be made within 5 days after issuance of the Final Balance Sheet, by wire transfer of immediately available funds. Any such payments shall be an adjustment to the Purchase Price. 

  

 SECTION 3.3. _Allocation of Purchase Price_. The aggregate fair market values of the Purchased Assets and the allocation of the Purchase Price and Assumed Liabilities that are liabilities for income tax purposes among the Purchased Assets as of the Closing Date for purposes of Section 1060 of the Internal Revenue Code and for all Canadian and other tax 

   ##### 

  

    

purposes will be agreed to no less than three (3) business days before the
Closing and such allocation shall be attached to this Agreement as _Schedule
3.3_. Such allocation shall be amended to update any adjustment to the
Purchase Price. Buyers and Sellers agree to be bound by such fair market
value determination and allocation, as it may be amended from time to time,
and to complete and attach Internal Revenue Service Form 8594 to their
respective U.S. tax returns accordingly and to file all comparable Canadian
and other tax returns accordingly. 

  

 SECTION 3.4. _Pre-Closing Lost Customers-Lost Oracle Sales Adjustment_. Sellers shall notify Buyers promptly in the event that (i) any of the contracts of customers of the Sold Business (either with Sellers or with suppliers of the Sold Business) for the purchase of products from the Sold Business have been terminated prior to the Closing Date (the "Pre-Closing Lost Customers") or (ii) as of the Closing Date, Oracle has not consented to the transaction contemplated by this Agreement (the "Oracle Refusal"). In the event that Buyers receive notice or become aware of any Pre-Closing Lost Customers or of an Oracle Refusal then, in addition to any adjustment pursuant to Section 3.2, the Purchase Price shall be reduced by an amount equal to the product of (x) the amount by which the sum of (a) the sales to such Pre-Closing Lost Customers during the twelve (12) month period ending September 30, 2006 (the "Pre-Closing Lost Sales") and (b) sales of Oracle products during the twelve (12) month period ending September 30, 2006 (the "Oracle Lost Sales"), exceeds $200 million, multiplied by (y) 0.35 (the "Lost Customers Multiple").

 SECTION 4.4. _Absence of Conflicts_. Subject to receipt of the approvals, consents, orders, declarations and other matters set forth in Section 4.3 and except as set forth on  _Schedule 4.4_, neither the execution, delivery nor performance of this Agreement or any of the other agreements, instruments or documents to be delivered by or on behalf of Sellers in connection herewith will result in the acceleration of any of the Assumed Liabilities or the creation of any Lien on any of the Purchased Assets (other than Permitted Liens and the Liens created by Buyers as of the Closing Date) or conflict with, violate or result in any material breach of or constitute a material default under (whether upon notice or the passage of time or both) any (i) Law applicable to Sellers, (ii) instrument to which any Seller is a party or by which any Seller is bound relating to the Sold Business, excluding any supplier contracts, customer contracts, purchase orders, sales orders, and any non-disclosure agreements, the violation, conflict, breach or default of which would not reasonably be likely to result in a Material Adverse Effect, (iii) any provision of the Articles of Incorporation or Code of Regulations, as amended, or any similar document, of any Seller, or (iv) such other orders, authorizations, registrations, declarations or filings the failure of which to be obtained or made would not (x) reasonably be likely to result in a Material Adverse Effect, (y) materially impair the ability of Sellers to perform their obligations hereunder, or (z) prevent the consummation of any of the transactions contemplated hereby. 

  

 SECTION 4.5. _Financial_. The unaudited balance sheet and the related Statement of Net Sales, Cost of Goods Sold and Direct Operating Expenses (the "Statement of Operations") of the Sold Business for the fiscal year ended March 31, 2006, and at and for the six month period ended September 30, 2006, are attached hereto as Schedule 4.5, together with reconciling statements tying such Statement of Operations for the fiscal year ended March 31, 2006 to the income statement provided in the Proxy Statement (together, the "Financial Statements").

of footnote disclosure. In addition, the Statement of Operations presented in
the Financial Statements does not contain any extraordinary or non-recurring

preparation of its financial statements in accordance with GAAP as in effect
from time to time.

 SECTION 4.7. _No Litigation_. With respect to the operation of the Sold Business, except as set forth on _Schedule 4.7_, there is no claim, litigation, action, suit, hearing, investigation or proceeding pending or, to the Knowledge of Sellers, threatened against any Seller which could (i) reasonably be likely to result in a Material Adverse Effect, or (ii) prevent, prohibit or make illegal the consummation of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement.

   ##### 

  

    

requirements for return to the manufacturer under the applicable franchise
agreement other than as a result of quantity limitations with respect to such
return rights. Except as set forth on Schedule 4.9(c), none of the Sellers

accelerated, vested, funded or payable by reason of any transaction
contemplated under this Agreement or any other agreements and documents to be
executed or delivered in connection herewith. 

   

 (c) Since September 30, 2006, no promises or commitments have been made, or other agreement entered into by any Seller to amend any Benefit Plan, to provide increased benefits thereunder or to establish any additional Benefit Plan except in the ordinary course of business consistent with past practice. 

   

 (d) Each Benefit Plan intended to qualify under Section 401(a) of the Code has either received a favorable determination letter from the IRS as to its qualified status or the remedial amendment period for each such Benefit Plan has not yet expired. Each trust established in connection with any Benefit Plan intended to be exempt from federal taxation under Section 501(a) of the Code is so exempt. To the Knowledge of Sellers, no fact or event has occurred that would adversely affect the exempt status of any such trust or affect the qualified status, or registered status of any Benefit Plan maintained by any of the Sellers.

 (d) By Sellers if there has been a material breach by Buyers of any material representation or warranty or any covenant herein in each case which breach has not been cured within thirty (30) days following receipt by Buyers of notice of such breach, and will result in the failure to satisfy any of the conditions set forth in Section 6.3; or 

   

 (e) By Buyers if there has been a material breach by Sellers of any material representation or warranty herein or any covenant in each case which breach has not been cured within thirty (30) days following receipt by Sellers of notice of such breach, and will result in the failure to satisfy any of the conditions set forth in Section 6.2. 

  

 8.1.6 _Effect of Termination_. 

    

 (a) In the event of termination of this Agreement by either Sellers or Buyers, as provided in Section 8.1.5, this Agreement shall forthwith become void and there shall be no liability or obligation hereunder on the part of Buyers or Sellers or their respective shareholders, officers, employees, directors or agents (except as set forth in Section 8.1.2(b), Section 8.3.1 and Section 8.3.2 which shall survive the termination); _provided_ , _however_ , that nothing contained in this Section 8.1.6 shall relieve any party hereto from any liability for any breach of this Agreement in the event of termination pursuant to Sections 8.1.5(b), (c), (d), or (e); and  _provided_ _further_ , _however_ , that in the event of termination pursuant to (i) Section 8.1.5(b), if the Closing has not been effected due to the failure of the Proxy Statement to be cleared by the SEC or the Shareholders Meeting to have occurred prior to the Drop Dead Date, or (ii) Section 8.1.5(c), no party shall be entitled to recover for any Losses 

   ##### 

  

    

(as hereinafter defined) in excess of its actual out-of-pocket costs and
expenses incurred since November 29, 2004 in the event of such a
termination. 

   

 (b) Notwithstanding anything contained in Section 8.1.6(a), in the event that the Agilysys Board has received a Proposal and thereafter this Agreement is terminated in accordance with Section 8.1.5 (other than pursuant to Section 8.1.5(a), (b) (provided Sellers have not failed to fulfill any obligation under this Agreement that has been the cause of, or resulted in, the failure of the Closing to have occurred on or prior to the Drop Dead Date) or (d)), and within one (1) year of such termination, Sellers enter into a definitive agreement with a third party for a Superior Offer, then, within ten (10) days after the closing of the transaction contemplated by such definitive agreement, Sellers shall pay to Buyers, as their sole and exclusive remedy for such termination, a termination fee equal to two percent (2%) of the Purchase Price _less_ the aggregate amount of out-of-pocket expenses previously paid by Sellers to Buyers pursuant to this Section 8.1.6 (the "Acquisition Termination Fee"). 

   

 (c) Notwithstanding anything contained in Section 8.1.6(a), the Agilysys Board may withdraw, modify or change its Recommendation in a manner adverse to the interest of the Buyers, if facts or occurrences arising after the date hereof cause the Agilysys Board, after consultation with its outside legal counsel and a financial advisor of national recognized reputation, to determine in good faith that failure to take such action would be inconsistent with its fiduciary duties under applicable Law. In such event, if this Agreement is thereafter terminated in accordance with Section 8.1.5(c) and Sellers have not received a Proposal prior thereto, then, within ten (10) days after such termination, Sellers shall pay to Buyers, as their sole and exclusive remedy for such termination, a termination fee equal to one percent (1%) of the Purchase Price  _less_ the aggregate amount of out-of-pocket expenses previously paid by Sellers to Buyers pursuant to this Section 8.1.6 (the "Modification Termination Fee" and together with the Acquisition Termination Fee, the "Termination Fee"). 

   

 (d) Sellers acknowledge that the agreements contained in this Section 8.1.6 are an integral part of the transactions contemplated in this Agreement, that the damages resulting from termination of this Agreement under circumstances where a Termination Fee are payable are uncertain and incapable of accurate calculation and that the amounts payable pursuant to this Section 8.1.6 are reasonable forecasts of the actual damages which may be incurred and constitute liquidated damages and not a penalty, and that, without these agreements, Buyers would not enter into this Agreement; accordingly, if Sellers fail to promptly pay the Termination Fee, and, in order to obtain such payments Buyers commences a suit which results in a judgment against Sellers for the Termination Fee, Sellers shall pay to Buyers its costs and expenses (including reasonable attorneys fees) in connection with such suit.

(1) the decision of the Agilysys Board to take such action and (2) the
material terms and conditions of the Proposal, including the identity of the

Subject to Section 8.1.8(a), the Proxy Statement shall include the recommendation to the shareholders of Agilysys in favor of approval and adoption of this Agreement and approval of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement (the "Recommendation"). 

  

 8.1.9 _Bulk Sales_. Buyers and Sellers agree that the sale of the Purchased Assets may be considered to constitute a "sale in bulk" within the meaning of the Bulk Sales Act (Ontario) and other comparable legislation of other jurisdictions the laws of which may apply to the transactions contemplated in this Agreement. The parties agree that compliance with the provisions of such legislation is not practicable and therefore Buyers agree to waive compliance with the said provisions and Sellers hereby covenant and agree to be solely responsible for compliance therewith and further covenant to fully indemnify and hold harmless Buyers from and against any and all actions, proceedings, suits, claims, liabilities, damages, expenses and demands arising, directly or indirectly, as a result of or in relation to the failure of Sellers to comply with the requirements of such legislation in connection with the transactions contemplated in this Agreement.

As of the Effective Time, the Transferred Employees who were covered under the Retirement Plan of Agilysys, Inc. ("Sellers 401(k) Plan") shall be eligible to participate in Buyers 401(k) Plan without regard to any service requirements thereunder. Buyers 401(k) Plan will recognize the service of the Transferred

any such Sold Business Employee under any non-hire, non-solicitation, non-
competition, confidentiality or employment agreement or any cause of action
based on similar rights arising by contract, at common law or by statute or
regulation. Sellers hereby assign, to the extent legally permissible and only
in so far as they relate exclusively to the Sold Business, to Buyers all
of Sellers rights to enforce the provisions of any non-competition agreement

Promptly after the Closing Date, Buyers shall reimburse Seller for any amounts owed by Buyers under the preceding sentence that are paid by Seller, it being understood that Buyers shall have no obligations hereunder if the Closing does not occur.

   ##### 

  

   

 (ii) At Closing, Sellers shall transfer and assign, and Buyers shall assume, each New Employment Agreement (or other employment agreement for the Sold Business Employees listed on _Schedule 8.2.2(n)(i)_ which remains in effect at such time) and Change of Control Agreement for each Sold Business Employee a party thereto, provided, that, any change of control payment made by Buyers within twelve (12) months from Closing pursuant to a Change of Control Agreement on account of the termination of a Sold Business Employees employment shall be the sole responsibility of Sellers and their Affiliates, and Sellers and their Affiliates shall indemnify and hold harmless Buyers against all Losses incurred or accrued by Buyers with respect thereto. Notwithstanding anything contained herein to the contrary, the indemnity obligations of Sellers for the change of control payments referenced in this Section 8.2.2(n)(ii) shall be reduced by any severance amounts which would otherwise be owed to such Sold Business Employees pursuant to any employee benefit plans, programs or arrangements, including, without limitation, any termination or severance policies, of Buyers as a result of such Sold Business Employees status as a Transferred Employee following the Closing if the Change of Control Agreements did not exist.

 (b) Agilysys Canada acknowledges the above covenant by Agilysys and agrees that it will not for a period of five (5) years from the Closing Date, without the prior written consent of Buyers, either directly or indirectly, (i) engage or participate anywhere in Canada in (other than through the ownership of 5% or less of any class of securities registered under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended or of an otherwise publicly traded company) any line of business which comprised the Sold Business on the Closing Date; or (ii) cause or attempt to cause any officer, employee or consultant of Buyers engaged in the Sold Business to resign or sever a relationship with Buyers (the "Canada Non-Competition Covenant"). Notwithstanding the foregoing, Buyers acknowledge and agree that Agilysys Canada may continue to own an equity interest in and continue to maintain other business relationships with Magirus AG and such equity interest and relationships shall not constitute a violation of this Section 8.2.9(b). 

  

 8.2.10 _Nonsolicitation_.

 8.2.12 _Product Liability/Returned Goods_. In the event that any person asserts a claim for Product Liabilities or for Returned Goods in connection with any products sold by Sellers prior to the Closing Date, Buyers shall provide reasonable assistance to Sellers to notify the supplier of such product of the claim and to request such supplier to fulfill its responsibility in respect of such claim. In the event that the supplier does not assume 

   ##### 

  

 

responsibility for any such claim, Buyers shall, at the request of Sellers,
provide replacement product to Sellers at cost. 

   

 SECTION 8.3. _Miscellaneous Covenants_. 

  

 8.3.1 _Publicity_.

 8.3.2 _Expenses_. Except to the extent otherwise specifically provided herein, Buyers shall pay all the expenses incident to the transactions contemplated by this Agreement which are incurred by Buyers or their representatives, and Sellers shall pay all the expenses incident to the transactions contemplated by this Agreement which are incurred by Sellers or their representatives. 

  

 8.3.3 _No Assignment_. No assignment by either party of this Agreement or any right or obligation hereunder, in whole or in part, may be made without the prior written consent of the other party. Any assignment attempted without that consent will be void and of no effect;  _provided_ , _however_ , that Buyers may assign their rights under this Agreement to an Affiliate of Buyers so long as they remain obligated hereunder. 

  

 8.3.4 _Further Assurances_. Each party hereto agrees that, as requested by the other party after the Closing, it will do all such further acts as may be required to effect the transactions contemplated hereby. To the extent Sellers are not able to obtain the requisite consents to assign to Buyers any of the Assumed Contracts which require such consents, Sellers agree to enter into mutually agreeable agreements with Buyers for each such Assumed Contract for which consent to assignment was not obtained, under which Buyers shall, to the extent practicable and possible, obtain the reasonably equivalent corresponding rights and benefits of any such Assumed Contracts and the reasonably equivalent corresponding obligations and liabilities thereunder, so that Buyers are, to the extent practicable and possible, put in substantially the same position they would have been in had such consent been obtained by Sellers. Such agreements may be in the form of a subcontract, sub-license or sub-lease to a Buyer or Sellers appointing the relevant Buyer as agent to such Seller to perform under such Assumed Contract, or any other arrangement which the relevant Buyer could enforce for the benefit of such Buyer, with the relevant Buyer assuming such Sellers obligations, and any and all rights and benefits of such Seller against a third party thereto.

Subject to one or more provisions of this Article 9, Buyers and their Affiliates (collectively, the "Seller Indemnified Parties") shall be entitled to indemnification from Sellers for all Losses directly or indirectly incurred by or sought to be imposed upon the Seller Indemnified Parties arising out of or relating to any (i) breach of any covenant or agreement made by Sellers in or pursuant to this Agreement, (ii) breach of any representations and warranties made by Sellers in this Agreement, (iii) of the Retained Liabilities, (iv) Assumed Litigation in excess of $5,000,000 or (v) the contract provision described in item 2(a) of _Schedule 4.25_, and (vi) post-Closing liabilities of Buyers to IBM relating to the Sold Business arising from Sellers actions or inactions prior to Closing that are not reflected on the Audited Balance Sheet (unless Buyers have already been indemnified for such liabilities pursuant to sub-clause (1) below of this Section 9.2). "Losses" or "Loss" as used in this Agreement, means all liabilities, losses, damages, fines, fees, costs and expenses, including reasonable attorneys fees. In addition to the foregoing, during the period beginning on the Closing and ending on the one year anniversary thereof, the Seller Indemnified Parties shall be entitled to indemnification from Sellers for all Losses directly or indirectly incurred by or sought to be imposed upon the Seller Indemnified Parties resulting from, arising out of or relating to (1) 100% of liabilities related to trade activities with suppliers of the Sold Business arising from Sellers actions or inactions prior to Closing unrecorded on the Audited Balance Sheet (unless Buyers have already been indemnified for such liabilities pursuant to sub-clause (vi) of this Section 9.2) and (2) amounts not collectable from IBM for customer and debit claims, to the extent of (A) 80% of such customer and debit claims that are aged less than six (6) months as of the Closing Date, (B) 90% of such customer and debit claims that are aged between six (6) months and twelve (12) months as of the Closing Date and (C) 100% of such customer and debit claims that are aged more than twelve (12) months as of the Closing Date; provided, however, that, in each case, Seller Indemnified Parties use commercially reasonable efforts to resolve such matters during such period.

 (e) The Seller Indemnified Parties right to indemnification shall be reduced to the extent they receive insurance proceeds with respect to such Losses;

 (g) The Seller Indemnified Parties shall not be entitled to indemnification with respect to Losses resulting from the termination or non-renewal of any Assumed Contract with any supplier or customer by such supplier or customer other than for cause;  _provided_ , _however_ , notwithstanding anything contained herein or in any Assumed Contract to the contrary, the termination or non-renewal of any Assumed Contract with any supplier or customer of the Sold Business resulting from the consummation of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, including, without limitation, as a result of the assignment, or attempted assignment, of such Assumed Contract by Sellers to Buyers without first obtaining the consent of such supplier or customer, shall not constitute "for cause" for purposes of this Agreement. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the provisions of this Section 9.4(g) shall not limit, or otherwise effect, the rights of the Seller Indemnified Parties under Sections 3.4, 6.2(m) and 8.2.9.

 SECTION 9.6. _Notice of Non-Third Party Claim_. 

   

 (a) Promptly after acquiring knowledge of any Losses for which a Seller Indemnified Party is entitled to indemnification pursuant to this Article 9, Buyers shall give written notice thereof to Sellers accompanied by an affidavit of the chief executives or chief financial officers of Buyers setting forth with reasonable particularity the underlying facts (either, as of the date of such affidavit, actually known or in good faith believed by the affiant to exist) sufficient to establish a good faith estimate, if known, of the Losses incurred or to be incurred relating thereto; and including copies of all written documentation and summarizing all oral information actually known or in good faith believed by the affiant to exist relating to the circumstances or events underlying the indemnification claim. In the event Buyers make a claim which is determined by a court of competent jurisdiction to be without reasonable basis in law or fact, Buyers shall bear all reasonable costs and expenses (including court costs and reasonable attorneys and accountants fees) incurred by Sellers in investigating and defending against such claim. 

   

 (b) Promptly after acquiring knowledge of any Losses for which a Buyer Indemnified Party is entitled to indemnification pursuant to this Article 9, Sellers shall give written notice thereof to Buyers accompanied by an affidavit of the chief executive or chief financial officer of Agilysys setting forth with reasonable particularity the underlying facts (either, as of the date of such affidavit, actually known or in good faith believed by the affiant to exist) sufficient to establish, as of the date of such affidavit, the breach of a specified representation or warranty and setting forth a good faith estimate, if known, of the Losses incurred or to be incurred relating thereto; and including copies of all written documentation and summarizing 

   ##### 

  

   

all oral information actually known or in good faith believed by the affiant
to exist relating to the circumstances or events underlying the
indemnification claim. 

  

 SECTION 9.7. _Third Party Claims_. 

   

 (a) _Notice_. In order for a party (the "Indemnitee") to be entitled to any indemnification provided for under this Agreement in respect of, arising out of or involving a claim or demand made by any Person against the Indemnitee (a "Third Party Claim"), such Indemnitee must notify the party from who indemnification hereunder is sought (the "Indemnitor") in writing of the Third Party Claim no later than thirty (30) days after such claim or demand is first asserted. Such notice shall state in reasonable detail the amount of or estimated amount of such claim, and shall identify the specific basis or bases for such claim, including the representation, warranties or covenants alleged to have been breached. Failure to give such notification shall not affect the indemnification provided hereunder except to the extent the Indemnitor shall have been actually prejudiced as a result of such failure. Thereafter, the Indemnitee shall deliver to the Indemnitor, without undue delay, copies of all notices and documents (including court papers) received by the Indemnitee relating to the Third Party Claim so long as any such disclosure could not reasonably be expected to have an adverse effect on the attorney client or any other privilege that may be available to the Indemnitee in connection therewith. 

   

 (b) _Control_. 

   

 (i) If a Third Party Claim is made against an Indemnitee, the Indemnitor shall be entitled to participate, at its expense, in the defense thereof. Notwithstanding the foregoing, if the Indemnitor irrevocably admits to the Indemnitee in writing its obligation to indemnify the Indemnitee for all liabilities and obligations relating to such Third Party Claim, the Indemnitor may elect to assume and control the defense thereof (by providing notice to Indemnitee of such election within thirty (30) days following delivery of notice of a Third Party Claim by Indemnitee to Indemnitor) with counsel reasonably satisfactory to the Indemnitee, at the sole cost and expense of the Indemnitor, such Third Party Claim by all appropriate proceedings, which proceedings will be vigorously and diligently prosecuted by the Indemnitor to a final conclusion or will be settled in accordance with 9.7(c). If the Indemnitor assumes such defense, the Indemnitee shall have the right to participate in the defense thereof and to employ counsel, at its own expense, separate from the counsel employed by the Indemnitor, it being understood that the Indemnitor shall control such defense; _provided_ , _however_ , that the Indemnitee may at any time prior to the Indemnitors delivery of the notice to the Indemnitee of the Indemnitors election to assume the defense of any Third Party Claim, file any motion, answer or other pleadings or take any other action that is reasonably necessary or appropriate to protect the Indemnitees interests. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary provided in the immediately preceding sentence, the Indemnitor will pay the Indemnitees costs and expenses with respect to its separate counsel if (x) in the Indemnitees good faith judgment, it is advisable, based on advice of counsel, for the Indemnitee to be represented by 

   ##### 

  

    

separate counsel because a conflict or potential conflict exists between
the Indemnitor and the Indemnitee or (y) the named parties to such Third
Party Claim include both the Indemnitor and the Indemnitee and the Indemnitee
determines in good faith, based on advice of counsel, that defenses are
available to it that are unavailable to the Indemnitor. 

   

 (ii) If the Indemnitor fails to notify the Indemnitee within thirty (30) days following delivery of notice of a Third Party Claim by Indemnitee to Indemnitor that the Indemnitor desires to defend the Third Party Claim pursuant to this Section 9.7, or if the Indemnitor gives such notice but fails to prosecute diligently or settle the Third Party Claim, then the Indemnitee will have the right to defend, at the sole cost and expense of the Indemnitor, the Third Party Claim by all appropriate proceedings, which proceedings will be vigorously and diligently prosecuted by the Indemnitee in good faith or will be settled at the discretion of the Indemnitee (with the consent of the Indemnitor, which consent will not be unreasonably withheld). The Indemnitee will have full control of such defense and proceedings, including any compromise or settlement thereof (subject to the previous sentence);  _provided_ , _however_ , that if requested by the Indemnitee, the Indemnitor will, at the sole cost and expense of the Indemnitor, provide reasonable cooperation to the Indemnitee and its counsel in contesting any Third Party Claim which the Indemnitee is contesting. 

   

 (c) _Settlement_. If the Indemnitor so assumes the defense of any Third Party Claim, all of the indemnified parties shall cooperate with the Indemnitor in the defense or prosecution thereof. Such cooperation shall include, at the expense of the Indemnitor, the retention and (upon Indemnitors request) the provision to the Indemnitor of records and information which are reasonably relevant to such Third Party Claim, and making employees available on a mutually convenient basis to provide additional information and explanation of any material provided hereunder. If the Indemnitor has assumed the defense of a Third Party Claim, (i) the Indemnitee shall not admit any liability with respect to, or settle, compromise or discharge, such Third Party Claim without the Indemnitors prior written consent (which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld), (ii) the Indemnitee shall agree to any settlement, compromise or discharge of any Third Party Claim which the Indemnitor may recommend and which by its terms releases the Indemnitee from any liability in connection with such Third Party Claim, and (iii) the Indemnitor shall not, without the written consent of the Indemnitee, enter into any settlement, compromise or discharge or consent to the entry of a judgment which imposes any obligation or restriction upon Indemnitee. 

   

 (d) _Cooperation_. Each party shall make available to the other all records and other materials reasonably required to contest any Third Party Claim and shall cooperate fully with the other in the defense of all such claims. Information disclosed by one party to the other shall be kept confidential. The party not in control of the Third Party Claim shall have the right to be represented by counsel of its own choosing and at its own expense. The party in control shall keep the other informed of all material developments in connection with any Third Party Claim. 

   ##### 

  

  

 SECTION 9.8. _Disputes Involving Claims for Indemnification_. If the Indemnitor notifies the Indemnitee that it does not dispute its liability to the Indemnitee with respect to any claim for indemnification hereunder, or fails to notify the Indemnitee within thirty (30) days following delivery of notice of any such claim by Indemnitee to Indemnitor whether the Indemnitor disputes its liability to the Indemnitee with respect to such claim, the Loss arising from such claim will be conclusively deemed a liability of the Indemnitor and the Indemnitor shall pay the amount of such Loss to the Indemnitee on demand following the final determination thereof. If the Indemnitor has timely disputed its liability with respect to such claim, the Indemnitor and the Indemnitee will proceed in good faith to negotiate a resolution of such dispute, and if not resolved through negotiations within thirty (30) days following receipt of an Indemnitee of a written notice from an Indemnitor stating that it disputes all or any portion of a claim for indemnification hereunder, such dispute shall be resolved by litigation in a court of competent jurisdiction. 

  

 SECTION 9.9. _Exclusive Remedy_. Except as provided in Section 8.1.6, each party shall have no liability to the other party with respect to any breach or nonfulfillment of any covenant or any other matter or claim relating to or arising out of this Agreement, except that with respect to any breach of, inaccuracy in, or violation of any representation or warranty or nonfulfillment of any covenant for which a right to claim indemnification is provided in this Article 9, a claim or an action under and pursuant to the terms, conditions and limitations of this Article 9 shall be the sole and exclusive right and remedy of a party seeking indemnification, and such party shall not have any other claim, cause of action, right, or remedy for such breach, inaccuracy, violation or nonfulfillment based upon this Agreement, any provision of any federal, state or provincial securities or other Law (including CERCLA and similar contribution rights) or based upon any other cause of action arising at law or in equity; _provided_ , _however_ , that if for any reason a court of competent jurisdiction shall refuse to enforce this provision, and shall permit a party seeking indemnification to assert any action based other than upon the right to claim indemnification as provided in this Article 9, such party agrees that the amount of such other claim shall be subject to and limited by the provisions of this Article 9\. The provisions of this Section 9.9 shall not preclude the prosecution of any action or proceeding based on fraud.
