<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt; margin-left: 2%">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(a) <U>Notice</U>. In order for a party (the &#147;Indemnitee&#148;) to be entitled to any
indemnification provided for under this Agreement in respect of, arising out of or
involving a claim or demand made by any Person against the Indemnitee (a &#147;Third Party
Claim&#148;), such Indemnitee must notify the party from who indemnification hereunder is
sought (the &#147;Indemnitor&#148;) in writing of the Third Party Claim no later than thirty (30)
days after such claim or demand is first asserted. Such notice shall state in
reasonable detail the amount of or estimated amount of such claim, and shall identify
the specific basis or bases for such claim, including the representation, warranties or
covenants alleged to have been breached. Failure to give such notification shall not
affect the indemnification provided hereunder except to the extent the Indemnitor shall
have been actually prejudiced as a result of such failure. Thereafter, the Indemnitee
shall deliver to the Indemnitor, without undue delay, copies of all notices and
documents (including court papers) received by the Indemnitee relating to the Third
Party Claim so long as any such disclosure could not reasonably be expected to have an
adverse effect on the attorney client or any other privilege that may be available to
the Indemnitee in connection therewith.

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt; margin-left: 4%">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(i) If a Third Party Claim is made against an Indemnitee, the Indemnitor shall
be entitled to participate, at its expense, in the defense thereof. Notwithstanding
the foregoing, if the Indemnitor irrevocably admits to the Indemnitee in writing its
obligation to indemnify the Indemnitee for all liabilities and obligations relating
to such Third Party Claim, the Indemnitor may elect to assume and control the
defense thereof (by providing notice to Indemnitee of such election within thirty
(30)&nbsp;days following delivery of notice of a Third Party Claim by Indemnitee to
Indemnitor) with counsel reasonably satisfactory to the Indemnitee, at the sole cost
and expense of the Indemnitor, such Third Party Claim by all appropriate
proceedings, which proceedings will be vigorously and diligently prosecuted by the
Indemnitor to a final conclusion or will be settled in accordance with 9.7(c). If
the Indemnitor assumes such defense, the Indemnitee shall have the right to
participate in the defense thereof and to employ counsel, at its own expense,
separate from the counsel employed by the Indemnitor, it being understood that the
Indemnitor shall control such defense; <U>provided</U>, <U>however</U>, that the
Indemnitee may at any time prior to the Indemnitor&#146;s delivery of the notice to
the Indemnitee of the Indemnitor&#146;s election to assume the defense of any Third
Party Claim, file any motion, answer or other pleadings or take any other action
that is reasonably necessary or appropriate to protect the Indemnitee&#146;s interests.
Notwithstanding anything to the contrary provided in the immediately preceding
sentence, the Indemnitor will pay the Indemnitee&#146;s costs and expenses with respect
to its separate counsel if (x)&nbsp;in the Indemnitee&#146;s good faith judgment, it is

following delivery of notice of a Third Party Claim by Indemnitee to Indemnitor that
the Indemnitor desires to defend the Third Party Claim pursuant to this Section&nbsp;9.7,
or if the Indemnitor gives such notice but fails to prosecute diligently or settle
the Third Party Claim, then the Indemnitee will have the right to defend, at the
sole cost and expense of the Indemnitor, the Third Party Claim by all appropriate
proceedings, which proceedings will be vigorously and diligently prosecuted by the
Indemnitee in good faith or will be settled at the discretion of the Indemnitee
(with the consent of the Indemnitor, which consent will not be unreasonably
withheld). The Indemnitee will have full control of such defense and proceedings,
including any compromise or settlement thereof (subject to the previous sentence);
<U>provided</U>, <U>however</U>, that if requested by the Indemnitee, the
Indemnitor will, at the sole cost and expense of the Indemnitor, provide reasonable
cooperation to the Indemnitee and its counsel in contesting any Third Party Claim
which the Indemnitee is contesting.

Party Claim, all of the indemnified parties shall cooperate with the Indemnitor in the
defense or prosecution thereof. Such cooperation shall include, at the expense of the
Indemnitor, the retention and (upon Indemnitor&#146;s request) the provision to the
Indemnitor of records and information which are reasonably relevant to such Third Party
Claim, and making employees available on a mutually convenient basis to provide
additional information and explanation of any material provided hereunder. If the
Indemnitor has assumed the defense of a Third Party Claim, (i)&nbsp;the Indemnitee shall not
admit any liability with respect to, or settle, compromise or discharge, such Third
Party Claim without the Indemnitor&#146;s prior written consent (which consent shall not be
unreasonably withheld), (ii)&nbsp;the Indemnitee shall agree to any settlement, compromise or
discharge of any Third Party Claim which the Indemnitor may recommend and which by its
terms releases the Indemnitee from any liability in connection with such Third Party
Claim, and (iii)&nbsp;the Indemnitor shall not, without the written consent of the
Indemnitee, enter into any settlement, compromise or discharge or consent to the entry
of a judgment which imposes any obligation or restriction upon Indemnitee.

and other materials reasonably required to contest any Third Party Claim and shall
cooperate fully with the other in the defense of all such claims. Information disclosed
by one party to the other shall be kept confidential. The party not in control of the
Third Party Claim shall have the right to be represented by counsel of its own choosing
and at its own expense. The party in control shall keep the other informed of all
material developments in connection with any Third Party Claim.

any claim for indemnification hereunder, or fails to notify the Indemnitee within thirty (30)&nbsp;days
following delivery of notice of any such claim by Indemnitee to Indemnitor whether the Indemnitor
disputes its liability to the Indemnitee with respect to such claim, the Loss arising from such
claim will be conclusively deemed a liability of the Indemnitor and the Indemnitor shall pay the
amount of such Loss to the Indemnitee on demand following the final determination thereof. If the
Indemnitor has timely disputed its liability with respect to such claim, the Indemnitor and the
Indemnitee will proceed in good faith to negotiate a resolution of such dispute, and if not
resolved through negotiations within thirty (30)&nbsp;days following receipt of an Indemnitee of a

or any other matter or claim relating to or arising out of this Agreement, except that with respect
to any breach of, inaccuracy in, or violation of any representation or warranty or nonfulfillment
of any covenant for which a right to claim indemnification is provided in this Article&nbsp;9, a claim
or an action under and pursuant to the terms, conditions and limitations of this Article&nbsp;9 shall be
the sole and exclusive right and remedy of a party seeking indemnification, and such party shall
not have any other claim, cause of action, right, or remedy for such breach, inaccuracy, violation
or nonfulfillment based upon this Agreement, any provision of any federal, state or provincial
securities or other Law (including CERCLA and similar contribution rights) or based upon any other
cause of action arising at law or in equity; <U>provided</U>, <U>however</U>, that if for any

claim shall be subject to and limited by the provisions of this Article&nbsp;9. The provisions of this
