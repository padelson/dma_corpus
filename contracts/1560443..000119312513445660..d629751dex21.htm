agree that the Common Unit Consideration and the Earn-out Amount, if any, will

3 __Section 2.04 _No Fractional Units_. If any calculation of a number of
Common Units under this _Article II_ or _Article III_ does not yield a whole
number of Common Units, then the number of Common Units shall be rounded, up
or down, to the nearest whole number of Common Units (and 0.5 Common Unit
shall be rounded up to the nearest whole Common Unit) for all purposes of
this Agreement. __

ARTICLE III

 

EARN-OUT

 

Section 3.01 _Payment of Earn-out Common Unit Consideration_.

 

(a) On or before April 24, 2015, Acquirer shall in good faith determine the
Earn-out Amount, calculated as the amount equal to: 5.0  _times_ the EBITDA
attributed to the Acquired Companies for the trailing nine month period ended
March 31, 2015, on an annualized basis, _less_ (i) the Initial Consideration,
(ii) the Partnership Investments for the period from the Closing Date through
March 31, 2015 and (iii) the Transaction Costs of the MCE Parties paid by
Acquirer pursuant to _Section 8.04_; _provided that_ , in no event shall the
Earn-out Amount exceed One Hundred and Twenty Million Dollars ($120,000,000).

(b) On or before May 1, 2015, Acquirer shall issue to the MCE Owners
collectively a number of Common Units equal to the Earn-out Amount divided by
the Volume Weighted Average Price of the Common Units for the twenty (20)
Trading Days ending three Trading Days prior to the date of such payment (the
" _Earn-out Common Unit Consideration_ "). The Earn-out Common Unit
Consideration shall be allocated among the MCE Owners in accordance with the
allocations set forth in _Schedule 2.02_.

 

(c) Notwithstanding the foregoing, if between the date of this Agreement and
the Valuation Notice Date, the Common Units shall have been changed into a
different number of shares or units or a different class or an equity interest
in another Person, by reason of any distribution (but excluding any quarterly
cash distribution paid by Acquirer to its unitholders),
subdivision, reclassification, recapitalization, split, combination, exchange
of shares or units, merger, consolidation or similar transaction (a "
_Fundamental Transaction_ "), the Earn-out Common Unit Consideration shall be
appropriately adjusted in the reasonable discretion of Acquirer to reflect
such event. Notwithstanding the foregoing, if in a Fundamental Transaction the
Common Units are changed into cash, property or securities that are not listed
for trading on a U.S. national or regional securities exchange, the Earn-out
Common Unit Consideration shall be deemed to be the Earn-out Amount and shall
be payable entirely in cash.

 

(d) The Common Units to be issued under this _Article III_ will, when issued,
be validly issued, fully paid and nonassessable and will be issued by
Acquirer free of any Liens and restrictions on transfer other than
restrictions on transfer under the Securities Act, except as provided in
_Section 2.03_.

 

Section 3.02 _Operation of Business of the Acquired Companies_.

 

(a) Subject to the limitations set forth in _Section 3.02(b)_, Acquirer shall
be entitled to operate the business of the Acquired Companies and their
respective Subsidiaries in the manner it believes in its sole discretion to be
prudent and to make any and all decisions in its

 



4  sole discretion with respect to the business of the Acquired Companies and
their respective Subsidiaries, including its assets, liabilities and
employees, that it believes in its sole discretion are reasonable and in the
best interests of Acquirer, in each case without any obligation to achieve a
positive Earn-out Amount, and without any other obligation except as provided
herein. Without limiting the foregoing, Acquirer shall not be obligated to
(i) make any capital contributions to the Acquired Companies or any of their
respective Subsidiaries, (ii) lend any money to, or guarantee any debt or
obligation of, the Acquired Companies or any of their
respective Subsidiaries, or (iii) cause the Acquired Companies or any of
their respective Subsidiaries to seek equity or debt financing to operate or
expand their respective businesses.

 

(b) Except with the prior written consent of Contributor, for the period from
the Closing Date through March 31, 2015, Acquirer shall not: 

(i) permit the Acquired Companies to merge or consolidate with or into any
other Person;

 

(ii) permit the Acquired Companies to sell, exchange or otherwise dispose of
all, or substantially all, of the Acquired Companies assets in one
transaction or a series of related transactions, unless in either case the
purchaser thereof expressly agrees in writing to assume all of Acquirers
obligations under this _Article III_ in which event, if the purchaser is
obligated to issue any Common Units pursuant to the terms of this _Article
III_ , such obligation shall be replaced by an obligation to make a cash
payment to the extent the Earn-out Amount is a positive number and the Earn-
out Common Unit Consideration shall be deemed to be the Earn-out Amount in
which event Acquirer shall be discharged from all of its obligations under
this _Article III_ ; or

 

(iii) sell, exchange or otherwise dispose of all, or substantially all, of the
Acquired Interests other than to an Affiliate of Acquirer, unless in either
case the purchaser thereof expressly agrees in writing to assume all of
Acquirers obligations under this _Article III_ in which event, if the
purchaser is obligated to issue any Common Units pursuant to the terms of
this _Article III_, such obligation shall be replaced by an obligation to
make a cash payment to the extent the Earn-out Amount is a positive number and
the Earn-out Common Unit Consideration shall be deemed to be the Earn-
out Amount and in which event Acquirer shall be discharged from all of its
obligations under this _Article III_.

number of calendar days in the portion of the period ending on and including
the Effective Date and the denominator of which is the number of calendar
days in the entire period.

the Acquired Assets by Acquirer.

(iv) The Parties agree to use the Final Federal Income Tax Returns to
determine the aggregate 2013 U.S. federal income tax liability for each MCE

liability shall be included in, and constitute a portion of, such MCE Owners
Taxes and they shall be solely responsible for such 2013 Tax Liability without
any right of contribution or payment from the Acquired Entities.

(i) The MCE Parties shall be liable for, and shall indemnify and hold Acquirer

allocation provided herein for all Tax reporting purposes.

 

 __Section 8.04 _Expenses_. Except due to any breach, whether or not the
transactions contemplated hereby are consummated, Acquirer shall be
responsible for each partys legal, financial advisory and investment banking

(a) (i) In consideration for the transactions contemplated by this Agreement,
in order to protect the goodwill and customer information of the Acquired
Entities and in order to satisfy certain conditions to the consummation of the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement, each of the MCE Parties expressly
covenants and agrees that during the Prohibited Period, (A) such MCE Party
will not, other than on behalf of the Acquired Entities, Acquirer or any
Affiliate of Acquirer, engage directly or indirectly in any business in which
the Acquired Entities are engaged as of the Closing Date (a  _"_ _Competing
Business_ _"_ ) in the geographical areas within the jurisdictions set forth
on _Schedule 9.01(a)_ (the " _Restricted Area_ ") and (B) such MCE Party will
not, other than on behalf of the Acquired Entities, Acquirer or any Affiliate
of Acquirer, and will cause its Affiliates not to, directly or indirectly,
own, manage, operate, join, become an employee of, control or participate in
or be connected with, or loan money to or sell or lease equipment to, any
Person, which engages in a Competing Business in the Restricted Area. For
purposes of this _Section 9.01(a)_, each Person set forth on _Schedule
9.01(a)_ shall be deemed to be a Competing Business; the Parties recognize
that Persons not listed on _Schedule 9.01(a)_ may also be Competing
Businesses. In no event will (A) any Acquired Entity or (B) Acquirer or any
Affiliate of Acquirer be deemed to be a Competing Business. As used in this
Agreement, _"_ _Prohibited Period_ _"_ shall mean three years from and after
the Closing Date.

 

(b) Notwithstanding the restrictions contained in _Section 10.01(a)_, each
MCE Party or any of his Affiliates may own an aggregate of not more than 5%
of the outstanding Equity Interests of any corporation or other entity engaged
in a Competing Business, if such Equity Interests are listed on a national
securities exchange or regularly traded in the over-the-counter market by
a member of a national securities exchange, without violating the provisions
of _Section 9.01(a)_; _provided that_ such MCE Party does not have the power,
directly or indirectly, to control or direct the management or affairs of
any such corporation or other entity and is not involved in the management of
such corporation or other entity.

 



35 (c) Each MCE Party further expressly covenants and agrees that during the
Prohibited Period, such MCE Party will not, other than on behalf of the
Acquired Entities, Acquirer or any Affiliate of Acquirer, and such MCE Party
will cause his Affiliates not to (i) engage or employ, or solicit or contact
with a view to the engagement or employment of any Person who is an officer,
employee or agent of Acquirer or its respective Affiliates (including the
Acquired Entities after the Closing) or (ii) canvass, solicit, approach or
entice away or cause to be canvassed, solicited, approached or enticed away
any Person who or which is a customer, consultant or supplier of any Acquired
Entity with respect to a Competing Business.

 

(d) To the extent that any part of this _Section 9.01_ may be invalid,
illegal or unenforceable for any reason, it is intended that such part shall
be enforceable to the extent that a court of competent jurisdiction shall
determine that such part, if more limited in scope, would have been
enforceable, such part shall be deemed to have been so written and the
remaining parts shall as written be effective and enforceable in all events
and the Parties agree to request that such court enforce this _Section 9.01_
as if so written.

 

(e) Each MCE Party hereby represents to Acquirer that he has read and
understands, and agrees to be bound by, the terms of this  _Section 9.01_.
The MCE Parties and Acquirer agree and acknowledge that the limitations as to
time, geographical area and scope of activity to be restrained as set forth in
this _Section 9.01_ (i) are the result of arms-length bargaining, (ii) are
fair and reasonable in light of (A) the nature and wide geographic scope of
the operations of the Business, (B) such MCE Partys level of control over and
contact with the Business in all jurisdictions in which it is conducted, (C)
the fact that the Business is conducted throughout the geographic area where
competition is restricted by this Agreement, and (D) the amount of
consideration that such MCE Party is receiving in connection with the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement and the amount of goodwill for
which Acquirer is paying, and (iii) do not impose any greater restraint than
is necessary to protect the legitimate business interests of Acquirer. The
MCE Parties and Acquirer further agree and acknowledge that, in the event of a
breach or threatened breach of any of the provisions of this _Section 9.01_,
Acquirer shall be entitled to immediate injunctive relief, as any such
breach would cause Acquirer irreparable injury for which they would have no
adequate remedy at law. Nothing herein shall be construed so as to prohibit
Acquirer from pursuing any other remedies available to them hereunder, at law
or in equity (including specific performance) for any such breach or
threatened breach of any of the provisions of this _Section 9.01_.

(f) It is the desire and intent of the Parties that the provisions of this
Agreement be enforced to the fullest extent permitted under applicable Law,
whether now or hereafter in effect and therefore, to the extent permitted by
applicable Law, the Parties waive any provision of applicable Law that would
render any provision of this _Section 9.01_ invalid or unenforceable.

stockholders, officers, partners, members, employees, agents, consultants,
attorneys, representatives, successors, transferees and assigns (collectively,

conditions: __

 

(a) The Person or Persons making a claim for indemnification hereunder
(whether one or more Persons, the  _"_ _Indemnified Party_ _"_ ) will give
the Party or Parties against whom indemnification is sought (whether one or
more, the " _Indemnifying Party_ ") prompt written notice of any such Third
Party Claim, and the Indemnifying Party may, at its option, undertake the
defense thereof by representatives chosen by it and reasonably acceptable to
the Indemnified Party upon written notice to the Indemnified Party within 20
days of receiving notice of such Third Party Claim. Failure of the Indemnified
Party to give such notice shall not affect the Indemnifying Partys duty or
obligations under this _Article X_ , except to the extent the Indemnifying

the defense of a Third Party Claim, the Indemnified Party may retain separate
co-counsel at its sole cost and expense (except that the Indemnifying Party
will be responsible for the fees and expenses of the separate co-counsel to

representatives and in the possession or under the control of the Indemnified
Party, for the use of the Indemnifying Party and its representatives in
defending any such Third Party Claim, and shall in other respects reasonably
cooperate in such defense.

 



37 (b) If the Indemnifying Party, within 20 days after notice of any such Third
Party Claim (or sooner if the nature of the Third Party Claim so requires),
fails to defend such Third Party Claim actively and in good faith, then the

Indemnifying Party) have the right to undertake the defense (at the
Indemnifying Partys expense), compromise or settlement of such Third Party
Claim, or consent to the entry of a judgment with respect thereto, and the
Indemnifying Party shall thereafter have no right to challenge the
Indemnified Partys defense, compromise or settlement thereof.

(c) Notwithstanding anything in this _Article X_ to the contrary (i) if it is
reasonably likely, in the Indemnified Partys reasonable opinion, that a Third
Party Claim may adversely affect the Indemnified Party other than as a result
of money damages or other money payments, the Indemnified Party shall have
the right to defend, compromise or settle such Third Party Claim, and (ii) the
Indemnifying Party shall not, without the written consent of the Indemnified
Party, settle or compromise any Third Party Claim or consent to the entry of
any judgment which (A) does not include as an unconditional term thereof the
giving by the claimant or the plaintiff to the Indemnified Party of an
unconditional release from all liability in respect of such Third Party Claim

with the applicable third party to such Assumed Claim (whether through
compromise, settlement, the entry of a judgment with respect thereto or
otherwise) in accordance with the terms of this _Section 10.03_ and subject
to _Section 10.06_, the Indemnifying Party shall pay the amount of Damages
incurred by the Indemnified Party in connection with such Assumed Claim by
delivering to the Indemnified Party, as the Indemnifying Party may elect,
either (i) cash, (ii) Common Units (valued at the Closing Common Unit Value),
or (iii) a combination of cash and Common Units (valued at the Closing Common
Unit Value). For purposes of this Agreement, an " _Assumed Claim_ " is (i) a
Third Party Claim the defense of which is undertaken by the Indemnifying
Party pursuant to the terms of this _Section 10.03_ or (ii) a Third Party
Claim the defense of which is undertaken by the Indemnified Party and the
resolution of which (whether through compromise, settlement, the entry of a
judgment with respect thereto or otherwise) has been consented to in writing
by the Indemnifying Party, which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld or
delayed or for which such consent by the Indemnifying Party is not required in
accordance with the provisions of _Section 10.03(b)_.

__Section 10.04 _Other Claims; Payment_. Upon the occurrence of a Claim or
Damages (other than an Assumed Claim) for which an Indemnified Party believes
indemnification is due under this _Article X_ , the Indemnified Party shall
provide notice of such Claim or Damages to the Indemnifying Party, stating
the circumstances giving rise to the Claim or Damages, specifying the amount
or the amount estimated in good faith of the Claim or Damages and making a
request __

 



38 _ _ __for any payment then believed due. Any such claim for indemnification
shall be conclusive against the Indemnifying Party in all respects 20 days
after receipt by the Indemnifying Party of such notice, unless within such
period the Indemnifying Party sends the Indemnified Party a notice disputing
the propriety of such claim. Such notice of dispute shall describe the basis
for such objection and the amount of the claim as to which the Indemnifying
Party does not believe should be subject to indemnification. Upon receipt of
any such notice of objection, both the Indemnified Party and the Indemnifying
Party shall use commercially reasonable efforts to cooperate and arrive at a
mutually acceptable resolution of such dispute within the next 30 days. If a
mutually acceptable resolution cannot be reached between the Indemnified Party
and the Indemnifying Party within such 30 day period, the Indemnified Party
shall have the right to commence legal proceedings with respect to such Claim
or Damages. If it is finally determined that all or a portion of the amount so
claimed is owed to the Indemnified Party then, subject to  _Section 10.06_,
the Indemnifying Party shall, within ten Business Days of such determination,
pay the amount of Damages incurred by the Indemnified Party by delivering to
the Indemnified Party, as the Indemnifying Party may elect, either (i) cash,
(ii) Common Units (valued at the Closing Common Unit Value), or (iii) a
combination of cash and Common Units (valued at the Closing Common Unit
Value). __

 

 __Section 10.05 _Allocation of Certain Indemnification Responsibilities
among MCE Parties_. Notwithstanding the other terms and conditions of this
_Article X_ , with respect to any Claim, Damages or Assumed Claim for which
the MCE Owners are obligated pursuant to _Section 10.01_, the Parties agree
that (a) the MCE Owners shall be liable only for their proportionate share of
any such Claim, Damages, or Assumed Claim after the application of the
provisions of _Section 10.06_, determined by reference to the allocation of
the Common Unit Consideration set forth on _Schedule 2.02_ ; and (b)
Contributor shall act as the representative and administrator of all matters
for which indemnification is requested by the Acquirer Indemnitees and shall
have full authority to act with respect to such matters on behalf of the MCE
Owners. __

Section 10.06 _Survival of Representations and Warranties;
Liability Limitations_. __

(a) _Survival_. Subject to the terms and conditions of this _Article X_ , all
representations, warranties, covenants and agreements of Acquirer and each of
the MCE Parties in this Agreement or any certificate or document delivered
pursuant hereto shall survive the Closing.

 

(b) _Exclusive Remedy_. After the Closing, indemnification pursuant to this
_Article X_ shall be the sole and exclusive remedy of the parties for any

asserted on or before the date which is 18 months after the Closing Date;
_provided, however_ , that such limitation shall not apply to (A) any claim
for 

 



39  indemnification (1) arising out of or relating to any breach of any
representation or warranty contained in _Sections 5.01_ , _5.02(a)_ , _5.03_ ,
_5.05_ , _6.01_ ,  _6.02(b)_ , _6.03_ or _6.04(a)(i)_ or (2) under _Section
10.01(b)_, which claim, in any such case, may be asserted indefinitely or (B)
any claim for indemnification arising out of or relating to any breach of
any representation or warranty contained in _Section 6.10_ or 6 _.11_ ,
which claim, in any such case, must be first asserted on or before 30 days
after the expiration of the applicable statute of limitations or (C) any claim
for indemnification arising out of or relating to any breach of any
representation or warranty contained in _Section 6.20_, which claim must be
first asserted on or before the third anniversary of the Closing Date.

 

(ii) In no event shall any MCE Indemnitee be permitted to make any claim for
indemnification under _Section 10.02_ unless such claim is first asserted on
or before the date which is 18 months after the Closing Date; _provided,
however_ , that the foregoing limitation shall not apply to any claim for
indemnification (A) arising out of or relating to any breach of any
representation or warranty contained in _Sections 7.01_ , 7 _.02_ , 7 _.03(a)_
or _7.06_ or (B) under _Section 10.02(b)_, which claim, in any such case, may
be asserted indefinitely.

indemnification under _Section 10.01(a)_ and none of the MCE Indemnitees
will be entitled to indemnification under _Section 10.02(b)_ for any
individual claim for Damages that does not exceed $50,000 (each a " _De
Minimus Claim_ ").

 

(e) _Baskets_.

 

(i) In no event shall any Acquirer Indemnitee be entitled to indemnification
for any claim under _Section 10.01_ unless the aggregate amount for each
claim under _Section 10.01_ that exceeds a De Minimus Claim is in excess of
$500,000 (the " _Basket_ ") and then the Acquirer Indemnitees shall only be
entitled to such excess (excluding all De Minimus Claims); provided, however,
that the foregoing limitation shall not apply to any claim for indemnification
arising out of or relating to any breach of any representation or warranty
contained in _Sections 5.01_,  _5.02(a)_ , _5.03_ , _5.05_ , _6.01_ ,
_6.02(b)_ , _6.03_ , _6.04(a)(i)_ , 6 _.09(b)_ or _6.10(d)(iii)_ (which claims
are, for the avoidance of doubt, subject to _Section 10.06(d)_ ).

 

(ii) In no event shall any MCE Indemnitee be entitled to indemnification for
any claim under _Section 10.02_ unless the aggregate amount for each claim
under _Section 10.02_ that exceeds a De Minimus Claim is in excess of the
Basket and then the MCE Indemnitees shall only be entitled to such excess
(excluding all De Minimus Claims); _provided, however_ , that the foregoing
limitation shall not apply to any claim for indemnification (A) arising out of
or relating to any breach of any representation or warranty contained in

avoidance of doubt, subject to _Section 10.06(d)_) or (B) under _Section
10.02(b)_.

 



40 (f) _Cap_. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this _Article
X_ or any other provision of this Agreement:

(i) the aggregate amount recoverable by the Acquirer Indemnitees from each
MCE Party in satisfaction of Claims or Damages pursuant to this _Article X_
shall not exceed the Cap; _provided, however_ , that the foregoing limitation
shall not apply with respect to Claims or Damages arising out of relating to
any claim for indemnification (A) arising out of or relating to any breach of
any representation or warranty contained in _Sections 5.01_, _5.02(a)_ , 5
_.03_ , _5.05_ , _6.01_ , 6 _.02(b)_ , _6.03_ , _6.04(a)(i)_ , or  _6.09(b)_

10.06(d)_ or (2) under _Section 10.02(b)_.

 

(g) _Knowledge_. Except to the extent that a particular representation,

10.06(g)_ by a disclosure contained in the Contributor Disclosure Schedules,
(i) none of the representations, warranties or covenants of any of the MCE
Parties shall, and each Acquirer Indemnitees ability to claim and be
indemnified for a breach thereof pursuant to this _Article X_ shall not, be
treated as waived, qualified or otherwise affected by any Acquirer
Indemnitees knowledge of any such breach and (ii) none of the
representations, warranties or covenants of Acquirer shall, and each MCE
Indemnitees ability to claim and be indemnified for a breach thereof pursuant
to this _Article X_ shall not, be treated as waived, qualified or otherwise
affected by any MCE Indemnitees knowledge of any such breach.

(h) Certain Damages. IN NO EVENT SHALL ANY PARTY BE LIABLE UNDER THIS _ARTICLE
X_ FOR INCIDENTAL, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE, INDIRECT OR EXEMPLARY DAMAGES OR
ANY DAMAGES MEASURED BY LOST PROFITS OR A MULTIPLE OF EARNINGS; PROVIDED,
HOWEVER, THAT THIS _SECTION 10.06(H)_ SHALL NOT LIMIT A PARTYS RIGHT TO
RECOVER UNDER THIS _ARTICLE X_ FOR ANY SUCH DAMAGES TO THE EXTENT SUCH PARTY
IS REQUIRED TO PAY SUCH DAMAGES TO A THIRD PARTY IN CONNECTION WITH A MATTER
FOR WHICH SUCH PARTY IS OTHERWISE ENTITLED TO INDEMNIFICATION UNDER THIS
_ARTICLE X_.

 

(i) _Reserves_. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this _Article X_ ,
if any Acquirer Indemnitee has any Claims or Damages as a result of a breach
of a representation or warranty contained in _Article VI_ for which
indemnification would otherwise be due under this _Article X_ and there is a
liability reserved on the Latest Balance Sheet that specifically relates to
such Claims or Damages and is identified as so relating to such Claims or
Damages on _Schedule 10.06(i)_, then such Acquirer Indemnitee shall only be
entitled to indemnification in respect of such Claims or Damages to the extent
that the aggregate amount of all such Claims or Damages exceeds such reserve,
and then the Acquirer Indemnitees shall only be entitled to such excess.

 



41 (j) _Insurance_. Any Indemnified Party that becomes aware of Damages for which
it intends to seek indemnification hereunder shall use commercially
reasonable efforts to collect any amounts to which it may be entitled under or
pursuant to any insurance coverage. Except as provided in _Section 10.06(b)_,
to the extent an Indemnified Party suffers Damages for which any Indemnifying
Party is liable for indemnification under this _Article X_ and for which third
party insurance proceeds are available, such Damages shall be reduced by the
amount by which any third party insurance proceeds actually received by the
Indemnified Party as a result of the events giving rise to the Claim for
indemnification for such Damages exceeds the sum of (i) the costs and expenses
of pursuing such recovery, (ii) the deductible associated therewith and (iii)
the amount of all retropremium obligations or other premium increases
established by the carrier to be directly resulting from such recovery. If any
Indemnified Party receives any such third party insurance proceeds as a
result of the events giving rise to such a Claim for indemnification for
Damages at any time subsequent to the making of an indemnity payment in
respect thereof by an Indemnifying Party, the amount of such indemnity
payment shall be refunded to such Indemnifying Party to the extent such third
party insurance proceeds exceed the amounts described in clauses (i)  (iii)
of the preceding sentence ( _provided that_ in no event shall any such
refund exceed the amount of such indemnity payment). Nothing in this _Section
10.06(j)_ shall be construed to require any Person to obtain or maintain any
insurance coverage.

 

(k) _Purchase Price Adjustment_. The Parties agree that all indemnification
payments made under this Agreement shall be treated as purchase price
adjustments for Tax purposes.

 __Section 11.02 _Third Party Beneficiaries_. This Agreement is solely for
the benefit of the Parties and their successors and assigns permitted under
this Agreement, and no provision of this Agreement shall be deemed to confer
upon any other Person any remedy, Claim, liability, reimbursement, cause of
action or other right except as expressly provided herein, including that the
indemnification provisions of _Article X_ shall inure to the benefit of the
Acquirer Indemnitees and the MCE Indemnitees as provided therein. __

 

 __Section 11.03 _Severability_. If any provision of this Agreement or the
application of any such provision to any Person or circumstance shall be
declared by any court of competent jurisdiction to be invalid, illegal, void
or unenforceable in any respect, all other provisions of this Agreement, or
the application of such provision to Persons or circumstances other than
those as to which it has been held invalid, illegal, void or unenforceable,
shall nevertheless remain in full force and effect and will in no way be
affected, impaired or invalidated thereby. Upon such determination that
any provision, or the application of any such provision, is invalid, illegal,
void or unenforceable, the Parties shall negotiate in good faith to modify
this Agreement so as to effect the original intent of the Parties as closely
as possible to the fullest extent permitted by applicable Law in an
acceptable manner to the end that the transactions contemplated hereby are
fulfilled to the greatest extent possible. __

__

 

 __Section 11.06 _Waiver; Remedies Cumulative_. No waiver or consent by any
Party to or of any breach by any other Party of its obligations hereunder
shall be deemed or construed to be a consent or waiver to or of any other
breach by such other Party of the same or any other obligations of such other
Party hereunder. Failure on the part of a Party to complain of any breach by
any other Party, irrespective of how long such failure continues, shall not
constitute a waiver by such Party of its rights hereunder until the applicable
statute of limitations period has _ _

 



43 _ _ run. Any such waiver or consent shall be valid only if set forth in an
instrument in writing signed by the Party or Parties to be bound thereby. No
waiver by any of the Parties of any of the provisions hereof shall be
effective unless explicitly set forth in writing and executed by the Party
sought to be charged with such waiver. All rights and remedies existing under

any rights or remedies otherwise available. __

__Section 11.07 _Assignment_. This Agreement shall not be transferred or
assigned by Acquirer without the consent of Mr. Tourian and Mr. Kos or by any
of the MCE Parties without the consent of Acquirer, except that Acquirer may
transfer or assign in whole or from time to time in part, to one or more of
its respective Affiliates, its rights or obligations under this Agreement, but
no such transfer or assignment will relieve Acquirer of its obligations under
this Agreement. __

 

 __Section 11.08 _Specific Performance_. The Parties hereby acknowledge and
agree that the failure of any Party to perform its agreements and covenants
hereunder, including its failure to take all actions as are necessary on its
part to the consummation of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement,
will cause irreparable injury to the other parties for which damages, even if
available, will not be an adequate remedy. Accordingly, subject to the
limitations set forth in _Section 10.06(b)_, each Party hereby consents to
the issuance of injunctive relief by any court of competent jurisdiction to
compel performance of such Partys obligations and to the granting by any
court of the remedy of specific performance of its obligations hereunder. __

THAT HAS JURISDICTION OVER THE MATTER THAT IS REASONABLY NECESSARY TO OBTAIN
SUCH RELIEF.

 

 __Section 11.11 _Waiver of Jury Trial._ EACH OF THE PARTIES HERETO HEREBY
WAIVES TO THE FULLEST EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW ANY RIGHT IT MAY
HAVE TO A TRIAL BY JURY WITH RESPECT TO ANY LITIGATION DIRECTLY OR INDIRECTLY
