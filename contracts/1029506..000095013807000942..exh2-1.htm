4.7 _Issuance of Splitco Securities to KFG_.

  

(a) As consideration in the Splitco Contribution, Splitco shall issue and
deliver to KFG the Splitco Securities as set forth herein.

  

(b) The aggregate principal amount of the Splitco Securities shall equal
$662,200,000 **** (the " **Splitco Securities Principal Amount** "). The
Splitco Securities Principal

  



  

\- 30 -

     

Amount may be increased pursuant to Section 3.2. In addition, as of the
Estimation Date, (i) if the Parent Estimated Debt Expenses exceed the Parent
Allocated Debt Expenses, then the Splitco Securities Principal Amount shall be
increased by the amount of such excess, and (ii) if the Parent Allocated Debt
Expenses exceed the Parent Estimated Debt Expenses, then the Splitco
Securities Principal Amount shall be reduced by the amount of such excess. For
purposes of this Agreement:

  

(i) " **Parent Estimated Debt Expenses** " shall mean the estimated
aggregate amount of Splitco Debt Expenses and RMT Debt Expenses that have been
or are expected to be incurred by Parent and its subsidiaries as determined by
the parties acting reasonably. It is understood and agreed that costs and
expenses of Splitco and its subsidiaries to be paid prior to the Closing Date
shall be deemed to be costs and expenses of Parent, and costs and expenses of
Splitco and its subsidiaries to be paid after the Closing Date shall not be
deemed to be costs and expenses of Parent.

  

(ii) " **Parent Allocated Debt Expenses** " shall equal 50% of the
estimated aggregate amount of Splitco Debt Expenses that have been or are
expected to be incurred by the parties as determined by the parties acting
reasonably.

  

(c) Notwithstanding the foregoing, to the extent the resale by KFG or Parent
of some or all of the Splitco Securities at par or the exchange of some or all
of the Splitco Securities at par for debt obligations of Parent, in each case
as of the Closing Date, would not be reasonably practicable without a
reduction in the Splitco Securities Principal Amount (based on the reasonable
advice of financial advisors to Parent taking into account then-current market
conditions and the efforts to market the Splitco Securities), then the Splitco
Securities Principal Amount (as such amount may be increased or reduced
pursuant to Section 3.2 and Section 4.7(b)) shall be reduced to the maximum
amount that could be so sold (or so exchanged and sold) at par and the amount
of the reduction shall be replaced with additional shares of Splitco Common
Stock having an equivalent aggregate Per Share Fair Market Value; _provided_
that the amount of any such reduction and replacement shall be structured so
that not more than an additional 6,000,000 shares of Splitco Common Stock are
issued pursuant to this Section 4.7(c) and so that the aggregate value at
which the Splitco Securities can be so sold (or so exchanged and sold) plus
the aggregate Per Share Fair Market Value of the additional shares of Splitco
Common Stock equals the Splitco Securities Principal Amount.

  

(d) The Splitco Securities shall have a minimum term of ten years. The final
form and terms of the Splitco Securities and related agreements (including
indenture, security documents and registration rights arrangements) shall
include (x) the terms set forth in _Schedule 4.7_; and (y) such other terms
as are consistent with then-current market practice for "Rule 144A" (or
equivalent) debt offerings of securities comparable to the Splitco Securities,
in the case of this clause (y), to the extent necessary to ensure that the
Splitco Securities are sold (or exchanged and sold) at par. Any other material
terms of the Splitco Securities and related agreements that are not addressed
by the preceding sentence shall be subject to the joint approval of the
parties hereto, acting reasonably, consistent with the next sentence. For the
avoidance of doubt, the Splitco Securities are intended to be sold (or, in the
case of the External Debt Exchange, exchanged and sold) at par upon issuance
and shall carry an interest rate and other terms sufficient to ensure that the
Splitco Securities are sold (or, in the case of the External Debt

  



  

\- 31 -

     

Exchange, exchanged and sold) at par. Subject to the foregoing provisions of
this Section 4.7, RMT Partner shall have the right to approve the terms of the
Splitco Securities, provided that the Splitco Securities have such terms
sufficient to ensure that the Splitco Securities are sold (or exchanged and
sold) at par.

   

4.8 _Issuance of Splitco Common Stock to KFG_.

  

(a) As consideration in the Splitco Contribution, Splitco shall issue (the "
**Splitco Share Issuance** ") and deliver to KFG a number of shares of Splitco
Common Stock equal to the sum of the following:

  

(i) (x) 1.1602 **,** multiplied by the number of shares of common
stock of RMT Partner on a Fully Diluted Basis, less (y) the number of shares
of Splitco common stock outstanding immediately prior to the issuance of
Splitco Common Stock pursuant to this Section 4.8(a)(i) (without giving effect
to the issuances pursuant to Section 4.8(a)(ii)), provided that in no case
shall the number of shares of Splitco Common Stock calculated pursuant to this
Section 4.8(a)(i) equal less than 30,320,000, plus

  

(ii) (x) the amount (if any) by which the Splitco Securities Principal
Amount is reduced pursuant to Section 4.7(c), divided by (y) the Per Share
Fair Market Value.

  

(b) For purposes of this Agreement:

  

" **Fully Diluted Basis** " shall mean the parties best estimate, made in
good faith, of (i) the number of shares of RMT Partner Common Stock that are
outstanding as of the Closing Date together with (ii) the number of shares of
RMT Partner Common Stock issuable upon exercise of any options or rights of
any nature, whatsoever, whether contingent, vested or unvested, or otherwise,
based upon the treasury stock method (in accordance with the rules and
interpretations of the Financial Accounting Standard Board, subject to the
following sentence, and consistent with _Schedule 4.8(b)_ (which details the
calculation as of the date of this Agreement)), in each case other than the
shares of RMT Partner Common Stock issued or to be issued in the Splitco
Merger. The parties binding estimate of the number of shares of RMT Partner
Common Stock on a Fully Diluted Basis shall be made on the Estimation Date
using, for the purposes of the treasury stock method calculations, (i) $55.90
for the price of RMT Partner Common Stock for all options and rights scheduled
on _Schedule 4.8(b)_ and (ii) the Per Share Fair Market Value of RMT Partner
Common Stock on the Estimation Date, for any options and rights granted
between the date of this Agreement and the Closing Date.

  

" **Estimation Date** " shall mean (i) if Parent elects to effect the
Distribution as a Split-Off, ten business days prior to the date on which the
Split-Off exchange offer is commenced or (ii) if Parent elects to effect the
Distribution as a Spin-Off, the last trading day that ends at least 20 trading
days prior to the date the parties expect the Distribution Date to occur, or
such later date as may be reasonably agreed by the parties hereto.

  

" **Per Share Fair Market Value** " shall mean the volume weighted average
trading price of RMT Partner Common Stock on the RMT Partner Exchange during
the ten trading days preceding the later of (i) the Estimation Date and (ii)
the date on which a

  



  

\- 32 -

     

portion of the Splitco Securities Principal Amount is replaced by shares of
Splitco Common Stock pursuant to Section 4.7(c).

  

4.9 _Replacement of Splitco Securities Principal Amount with Demand
Note_. Notwithstanding Sections 4.7 and 4.8, if Parent reasonably determines
that it is neither (i) able to obtain a ruling from the IRS to the effect that
the Internal Debt Exchange qualifies for Intended Tax-Free Treatment nor (ii)
able to obtain a ruling from the IRS to the effect that the External Debt
Exchange qualifies for Intended Tax-Free Treatment, then Parent shall elect
that one of the following shall apply:

  

(a) Either the Internal Debt Exchange, the External Debt Exchange, or both the
Internal Debt Exchange and the External Debt Exchange (as determined by
Parent) shall be effected; or

  

(b) Neither the Internal Debt Exchange nor the External Debt Exchange shall be
effected. In that case, no Splitco Securities shall be issued by Splitco to
KFG, but instead a demand note shall be issued by Splitco to KFG with a
principal amount equal to the Splitco Securities Principal Amount as set forth
in Section 4.7(b) (and as increased or reduced pursuant to Section 3.2 and
Section 4.7(b), if applicable), and RMT Partner shall pay the demand note in
full (by wire transfer of immediately available funds) on the Closing Date,
immediately upon consummation of the Short Form Merger. For purposes of
consummating the other Transactions predicated on the issuance of the Splitco
Securities, the issuance of the demand note shall be deemed to constitute the
issuance of the Splitco Securities and shall be deemed to have occurred
immediately prior to the Internal Spin.

   

4.10 _Inventory Adjustment_.

  

(a) _Schedule 4.10_ is a statement setting forth Parents estimate of the
type and value of the Business Inventory, in each case to be transferred to
RMT Partner pursuant to Section 4.2 on the Closing Date (the " **Estimated
Adjustment Statement** "). Within 60 days following the Closing Date, Parent
shall prepare and deliver to RMT Partner a statement setting forth the type
and value of the Business Inventory, as of the Closing Date, that in the case
of the Business Inventory is current, non-obsolete and saleable or useable in
the ordinary course of business. Such statement of Business Inventory shall be
derived from a physical taking of the inventory as of the Closing Date. The
value of the Business Inventory shall be determined in a manner as described
on _Schedule 4.10_ consistent with the Financial Information to the extent
such Financial Information relates to the valuation of the Business Inventory
(the " **Closing Adjustment Statement** " and together with the Estimated
Adjustment Statement, the " **Adjustment Statements** "). The Adjustment
Statements shall exclude any items for amounts with respect to Taxes. Upon the
reasonable request of Parent, RMT Partner shall provide to Parent and its
accountants access to the books and records, any other information, including
working papers of its accountants, and to any employees of RMT Partner
necessary for Parent to prepare the Closing Adjustment Statement, to respond
to the RMT Partner Objection and to prepare materials for presentation to the
Accounting Firm in connection with Section 4.10 and RMT Partner shall
otherwise cooperate with and assist Parent as may be reasonably necessary to
carry out the purposes of this Section 4.10.

  



  

\- 33 -

     

(b) RMT Partner shall, within 30 days after the delivery by Parent of the
Closing Adjustment Statement, complete its review thereof. RMT Partner and its
representatives shall have the opportunity to observe the taking of inventory
(which may begin prior to the Closing Date) in connection with the calculation
of the Closing Adjustment Statement and verify the status of the Business
Inventory as current, non-obsolete and saleable or usable in the ordinary
course of business. For a period of 30 days after delivery of the Closing
Adjustment Statement, Parent shall make available to RMT Partner all books,
records, work papers, personnel (including their accountants and employees)
and other materials and sources used by Parent to prepare the Closing
Adjustment Statement. The Closing Adjustment Statement shall be binding and
conclusive upon, and deemed accepted by, RMT Partner unless RMT Partner shall
have notified Parent in writing within 30 days after delivery of the Closing
Adjustment Statement of any good faith objection thereto (the " **RMT Partner
Objection** "). Any RMT Partner Objection shall set forth a description of the
basis of the RMT Partner Objection and the adjustments to the value of
Business Inventory reflected on the Closing Adjustment Statement which RMT
Partner believes should be made. Any items not disputed during the foregoing
30 day period shall be deemed to have been accepted by RMT Partner.

  

(c) If Parent and RMT Partner are unable to resolve any of their disputes with
respect to the Closing Adjustment Statement within 30 days following Parents
receipt of the RMT Partner Objection to such Closing Adjustment Statement
pursuant to Section 4.10(b), they shall refer their remaining differences to
an internationally recognized firm of independent public accountants as to
which Parent and RMT Partner mutually agree (the " **Accounting Firm** ") for
decision, which decision shall be final and binding on the parties. Any
expenses relating to the engagement of the Accounting Firm shall be shared
equally by Parent, on one hand, and RMT Partner, on the other hand. Parent and
RMT Partner shall each bear the fees of their respective auditors incurred in
connection with the determination and review of the Adjustment Statements.

  

(d) The Closing Adjustment Statement shall become final and binding on the
parties upon the earliest of (i) if no RMT Partner Objection has been given,
the expiration of the period within which RMT Partner must make its objection
pursuant to Section 4.10(b) hereof, (ii) agreement in writing by Parent and
RMT Partner that the Closing Adjustment Statement, together with any
modifications thereto agreed by Parent and RMT Partner, shall be final and
binding and (iii) the date on which the Accounting Firm shall issue its
written determination with respect to any dispute relating to such Closing
Adjustment Statement. The Closing Adjustment Statement, as submitted by Parent
if no timely RMT Partner Objection has been given, as adjusted pursuant to any
agreement between the parties or as determined pursuant to the decision of the
Accounting Firm, when final and binding on all parties, is herein referred to
as the " **Final Closing Adjustment Statement**."

  

(e) Within ten business days following issuance of the Final Closing
Adjustment Statement, the net adjustment payment payable pursuant to this
Section 4.10(e) (the " **Adjustment Payment** ") and interest thereon shall be
paid by wire transfer of immediately available funds to a bank account
designated by Parent or RMT Partner, as the case may be. The Adjustment
Payment shall be the difference, if any, between (x) the value of Business
Inventory, as reflected on the Final Closing Adjustment Statement, minus (y)
the value of Business Inventory, as reflected on the Estimated Adjustment
Statement. The Adjustment Payment, if any, shall be payable by RMT Partner to
Parent, if positive, and by Parent to RMT Partner, if

  



  

\- 34 -

     

negative. The Adjustment Payment shall bear interest from the Closing Date to
the date of payment at the prime rate (as published in the _Wall Street
Journal_ , Northeastern Edition) in effect on the Closing Date, which interest
shall be calculated on the basis of a 365-day year and the actual number of
days elapsed and such interest shall be paid on the same date and in the same
manner as such Adjustment Payment.

  

 **ARTICLE 5**

  



  

 _ **ADDITIONAL COVENANTS RELATED TO THE CONTRIBUTION AND THE NON-U.S.
TRANSFER**_

   

5.1 _Use of Parent s UPC Codes and Intellectual Property_.

  

(a) Except as expressly permitted by this Section 5.1, following the Splitco
Contribution and the Non-U.S. Transfer, Splitco shall not use or authorize any
third party to use the Parent UPC Codes or any Retained Intellectual Property
in connection with the packaging, advertising, promotion or sale of Products
and shall not use any of the Retained Intellectual Property or Parent UPC
Codes in connection with any goods, business or services of Splitco or any of
its affiliates or the advertising or promotion thereof.

  

(b) Following the Splitco Contribution and the Non-U.S. Transfer, to the
extent any Retained Intellectual Property appears on any packaging that is in
and is part of the Business Inventory (the " **Marked Packaging** "), Splitco
or a subsidiary of Splitco, as applicable, may use or otherwise distribute
such Marked Packaging solely in connection with the Products or sell finished
Product in Marked Packaging in the ordinary course of business until such
inventory is exhausted or for a period not to exceed 12 months following the
date of the Splitco Contribution, whichever occurs first; _provided_ that (i)
to the extent that any Marked Packaging is designed for use only in a
particular jurisdiction, Splitco uses that Marked Packaging only in the
intended jurisdiction and (ii) all use of the Marked Packaging bearing the
Retained Intellectual Property shall comply with all laws and regulations in
the jurisdictions in which it is used. Splitco may manufacture or cause to be
manufactured Products to be sold in the existing inventory of Marked
Packaging; _provided_ that the Products manufactured by Splitco or a
subsidiary of Splitco, as applicable are of a quality level not materially
different from Parents quality for the same goods as of the date immediately
preceding the date of the Splitco Contribution. If Products manufactured by
Splitco or a subsidiary of Splitco, as applicable, and packaged in the Marked
Packaging fail to meet the required level of quality, then within 30 days
notice by Parent, Splitco shall provide Parent with evidence that the quality
of its Products is substantially similar in level to the quality maintained by
Parent immediately preceding the date of the Splitco Contribution or Splitco
and subsidiaries of Splitco shall stop using the Marked Packaging in
connection with such Products. Parent shall not be liable for any obligations,
liabilities, claims, other Losses or commitments in respect of any product
manufactured by Splitco or a subsidiary of Splitco, as applicable, that is
packaged in Marked Packaging and that is shipped or sold at any time after the
date of the Contribution. Splitco and its subsidiaries shall be entitled to
print and use additional packaging that is identical (other than
inconsequential differences that may result from the printing process) to
Marked Packaging (" **Newly-Printed Marked Packaging** ") and may sell Product
in such Newly-Printed Marked Packaging for a period not to exceed six months
following the date of the Contribution, _provided_ that (i) all use of the
Newly-Printed Marked

  



  

\- 35 -

     

Packaging complies with the requirements for use of Marked Packaging herein
and (ii) any Newly-Printed Marked Packaging that includes time sensitive
content (for example, sweepstakes information) shall be produced in a manner
reasonably expected to exhaust supplies of Product packaged in such Newly-
Printed Marked Packaging prior to expiration of such time sensitive periods
and shall not be used after expiration of such time sensitive periods. The
LIVEACTIVE mark shall not be used on Newly-Printed Marked Packaging unless RMT
Partner shall have entered into a license agreement for use of LIVEACTIVE
pursuant to Section 12.7.

  

(c) Any advertising, promotional or sale materials that are included in the
Acquired Assets and that include the Retained Intellectual Property may
continue to be used by Splitco or a subsidiary of Splitco, as applicable for a
period not to exceed 12 months following the date of the Splitco Contribution;
_provided_ that (i) to the extent any such materials are designed for use only
in a particular jurisdiction, Splitco or a subsidiary of Splitco, as
applicable, uses such materials only in the intended jurisdiction and (ii) all
use of any advertising, promotional or sales materials shall comply with all
laws and regulations in the jurisdictions where the materials are used or
distributed. In addition, Splitco or a subsidiary of Splitco, as applicable,
may use the Retained Intellectual Property (i) in connection with any ongoing
promotion as of the date of the Splitco Contribution, through the expiration
of such promotion, or (ii) in connection with in-process advertisements in the
event that such Retained Intellectual Property cannot be removed without undue
effort or substantial cost, as determined in good faith using commercially
reasonable standards by Splitco, or a subsidiary of Splitco.

  

(d) Splitco or a subsidiary of Splitco, as applicable, may continue to use any
Retained Intellectual Property that appears on a real property building
included in the Acquired Assets for a period of six months following the date
of the Splitco Contribution after which period such Retained Intellectual
Property may no longer appear on any such real property and must be removed by
Splitco at its cost.

  

(e) Without regard to anything in this Agreement to the contrary, neither RMT
Partner nor Splitco will be required to remove the Retained Intellectual
Property from schematics, plans, manuals, drawings, machines, machinery, and
the like of the Acquired Assets in existence as of the Splitco Contribution to
the extent that such instrumentalities are used in the ordinary internal
conduct of the Acquired Assets and are not generally observed by the public or
intended for use as a means to effectuate or enhance sales.

  

(f) Parent agrees that Parent UPC Codes related to Products may continue to
appear on packaging in Business Inventory used by Splitco for a period not to
exceed 24 months following the date of the Splitco Contribution. If the
Uniform Code Council requires or recommends that Splitco cease using the
Parent UPC Codes related to Products prior to the end of the 24-month phase
out, Splitco and its subsidiaries, as applicable, shall promptly comply with
such requirement or recommendation. All fines, penalties, costs or charges
imposed or incurred by Parent and its affiliates in connection with Splitcos
and its subsidiaries, as applicable, use of the Parent UPC Codes related to
Products shall be assumed and paid by Splitco and, for the avoidance of doubt,
shall be included in the Assumed Liabilities.

  

(g) Nothing in the foregoing is intended to or shall transfer to Splitco or
any affiliate of Splitco any rights in or ownership of any Retained
Intellectual Property or to the

  



  

\- 36 -

     

Parent UPC Codes and any use by Splitco of any Retained Intellectual Property
or the Parent UPC Codes related to Products pursuant to the terms set forth
above shall inure exclusively to and be for the sole benefit of Parent.
Nothing herein shall or is intended to permit Splitco or any affiliate of
Splitco to use any of the Retained Intellectual Property in any manner other
than as set forth herein and the use of Parents Retained Intellectual
Property pursuant to this provision shall not and is not intended to grant to
Splitco or any affiliate of Splitco any rights in or ownership of such
Retained Intellectual Property which Splitco acknowledges is owned exclusively
by Parent. Parent and its subsidiaries, as applicable, grant to Splitco and
its subsidiaries, as applicable, a non-exclusive, royalty free, fully paid up,
nontransferable, non-sublicenseable license to use the Retained
Intellectual Property in the Business as provided in this Section 5.1. The
license granted herein is not a certification or guarantee that the Marked
Packaging, Newly-Printed Marked Packaging or any advertising, promotion or
sales materials referenced in Section 5.1(c) or their use complies with
applicable law and in all cases Splitco and its subsidiaries, as applicable,
must comply with applicable laws in the use of such materials.

  

(h) Nothing in this Section 5.1 shall restrict the rights of Splitco or any
affiliate of Splitco to dispose of any Business Inventory that does not
include Retained Intellectual Property in such manner as they, in their sole
discretion, deem appropriate.

  

(i) RMT Partner and Splitco jointly and severally agree to and shall defend,
indemnify, and hold Parent and its affiliates and subsidiaries harmless from
and against any and all Losses alleged or actual, arising out of, relating to,
or that are based on (i) the manufacture, distribution, advertising or sale of
any products in the Marked Packaging regardless of whether the products or the
Marked Packaging are used or created in compliance with or in violation of
this Agreement and (ii) any violations of this Section 5.1.

  

5.2 _Transfer of Equipment_. Following the Splitco Contribution and the
Non-U.S. Transfer, RMT Partner and Splitco shall bear all costs and expenses
relating to, and shall have the right and responsibility to manage, the
transfer of all Equipment that is included in the Acquired Assets and is
located in facilities of Parent and its subsidiaries. Following the
Contribution and the Non-U.S. Transfer, Parent shall bear all costs and
expenses relating to, and shall have the right and responsibility to manage,
the transfer of all machinery, equipment and other property that is not
included in the Acquired Assets and are located in Facilities transferred to
Splitco or a subsidiary of Splitco. All such transfers shall be done as soon
as reasonably practicable after the Closing Date, subject to the rights of
the parties under the Co-Manufacturing Agreements.

   

5.3 _Accounts Receivable_.

  

(a) Parent shall promptly forward or cause to be forwarded to Splitco any and
all proceeds from accounts receivable that are included in the Acquired Assets

(b) Splitco shall promptly forward or cause to be forwarded to Parent any and
all proceeds from accounts receivable that are included in the Excluded Assets
that are received by Splitco or any of its affiliates.

  

5.4 _Promotions_. With respect to sweepstakes, contests and other similar
promotions in process on the Closing Date, Parent and its subsidiaries shall
have the right to elect to continue to manage (but not amend or otherwise
modify with respect to the Business without RMT Partners consent) such
promotions in all respects (including selection of winners and prize
fulfillment) after the Closing. RMT Partner shall reimburse Parent and its
subsidiaries for costs and expenses relating to such promotions as provided in
the Transition Services Agreement.

   

5.5 _Termination and Separation of Contractual Arrangements_.

  

(a) Except as set forth in Section 5.5(b), on or prior to the Distribution
Date, Splitco (and any subsidiary of Splitco) and Parent and its other
subsidiaries shall terminate any and all agreements, arrangements, commitments
or understandings, whether or not in writing, between or among Splitco (and
any subsidiary of Splitco), on the one hand, and Parent and its subsidiaries,
on the other hand (the " **Related Party Contracts** "). No such Related Party
Contract (including any provision thereof which purports to survive
termination) shall be of any further force or effect after the Distribution
Date and all parties shall be released from all obligations and liabilities
thereunder. Each party shall, at the reasonable request of any other party,
take, or cause to be taken, such other actions as may be necessary to effect
the foregoing.

  

(b) The provisions of Section 5.5(a) shall not apply to any of the following

which any Person other than the parties hereto and their respective
subsidiaries is a party, (iv) any agreement, arrangement, commitment or
understanding to which any non-wholly owned subsidiary of Parent or Splitco is
a party (it being understood that directors qualifying shares or similar
interests will be disregarded for purposes of determining whether a subsidiary
is wholly owned) and (v) any other agreement, arrangement, commitment or
understanding that this Agreement, the Collateral Agreements or any agreement
contemplated hereby or thereby expressly contemplates will survive the Closing
Date.

  

5.6 _Bulk Sales Waiver_. The parties hereto hereby waive compliance with

may be applicable to the sale or transfer of the Acquired Assets.

  

5.7 _Transfer Tax Documentation_. Splitco, a subsidiary of Splitco or RMT

law, for the Equipment and any other Acquired Assets), and such other
certificates and

  



  

\- 38 -

     

documentation as may be required to reasonably evidence any exemption from
Transfer Taxes. The parties shall not make an election under Section 167 of
the ETA.

   

5.8 _Additional Matters Relating to Transfers and Assumption_.

  

(a) On or prior to the date of the Closing Date, Splitco shall deliver to
Parent appropriate instruments of assumption evidencing and effecting the
assumption by Splitco and its applicable subsidiaries of the Assumed
Liabilities, including the RMT Debt (it being understood that such instruments
shall not require Splitco or any other Person to make any representations,
warranties or covenants or agreements, express or implied).

  

(b) On or prior to the date of the Closing Date, Parent shall deliver or cause
to be delivered to Splitco appropriately executed instruments of assignment,
transfer and conveyance evidencing and effecting the assignment, transfer and
conveyance to Splitco (and its subsidiaries, as applicable) of the Acquired
Assets (it being understood that such instruments shall not require Parent or
any other Person to make any representations, warranties or covenants or
agreements, express or implied, other than customary statutory covenants
contained in the deeds).

  

(c) Each party shall, upon reasonable request of the other party, cooperate by
using its reasonable best efforts to furnish to the other party any items
described in Section 5.8(a) and (b) that are not provided on or prior to the
Closing Date.

  

(d) Parent and Splitco shall use reasonable efforts to cooperate in connection
with the execution and delivery of reasonably requested deeds, bills of sale,
assignments and assurances to vest or confirm ownership of record in Splitco
(or its subsidiaries as applicable) any and all right, title and interest in,
to and under any Acquired Assets, including such affidavits, other evidence of
title, corporate articles, by laws, certificates of good standing, resolutions
and the like as may be reasonably requested by the parties mutually agreed
title insurance company.

  

(e) To the extent that any transferable licenses, permits, and other
governmental authorizations or Contracts are not included in the Acquired
Assets due to the exceptions set forth in Sections 4.2(f) and (n) relating to
the receipt of governmental or third-party consents (" **Non-Transferable
Assets** "), then for a period of 18 months following the Closing Date Parent
shall use its reasonable best efforts (or, in the case of Contracts listed on
_Schedule 5.8(e)_, from the date of this Agreement and for a period of 18
months following the Closing Date Parent shall use its best efforts, which may
in appropriate circumstances involve exercising rights to arbitration or, if
Parent or a subsidiary of Parent is a necessary party thereto, litigation to
enforce arbitration provisions) to obtain such governmental or third-party
consents; _provided_ that Parent shall not be required to pay any fees or
other amounts or incur any liabilities or obligations to obtain such consents
(including with respect to any Contracts listed on Schedule 5.8(e), but except
any such amounts which may be advanced by RMT Partner). If any such consents
are obtained, the applicable Non-Transferable Assets shall be transferred to
RMT Partner without the payment of any consideration, and all obligations and
liabilities of Parent and its subsidiaries related to such Non-Transferable
Assets shall simultaneously be assumed by RMT Partner or Splitco hereunder and
be deemed to be Assumed Liabilities (except to the extent any such

  



  

\- 39 -

     

obligation or liability would have been an Excluded Liability, and in each
case not before the Closing Date).

  

(f) Parent will use commercially reasonable efforts to pursue claims with its
third party insurance carriers to obtain the actual cash recoveries described
in Section 4.5(h) that it is entitled to recover under applicable third-party
insurance policies (and Parent shall keep RMT Partner reasonably informed with
respect thereto).

  

(g) In the event that (i) any Contracts relating primarily to the Business are
not included in the Assigned Contracts, (ii) the benefits of such Contracts
are not being provided to RMT Partner pursuant to the Transition Services
Agreement, (iii) services provided under the Transition Services Agreement do
not otherwise provide RMT Partner with equivalent benefits and (iv) the type
of benefits provided under such Contract are not reasonably available to RMT
Partner from third party sources, at RMT Partners request Parent shall use
commercially reasonable efforts to provide the benefits of such Contract to
RMT Partner as an additional service under the Transition Services Agreement
(with service fees consistent with the fees set forth for similar services
under the Transition Services Agreement).

  

(h) To the extent that Parent or any of its subsidiaries own any internet
keywords that are legally assignable and that contain any Acquired
Intellectual Property including Assigned Key Marks, Parent and its
subsidiaries shall assign all right, title, and interest in and to such
keywords to RMT Partner. For the avoidance of doubt, keywords that are the
subject of contracts between Parent or any of its subsidiaries and any third
parties for the purpose of generating sponsored ads or placement on search
result pages are specifically excluded. Notwithstanding the foregoing, to the
extent RMT Partner seeks to obtain an internet keyword that contains any
Acquired Intellectual Property and is prevented from doing so as a result of
Parents or its subsidiaries ownership of a keyword that contains Acquired
Intellectual Property, Parent or its subsidiary shall provide
reasonable cooperation in assisting RMT Partner in obtaining such keyword.

  

(i) RMT Partner, at RMT Partners expense, shall use its reasonable best
efforts to obtain a survey for each owned Facility, and Parent, at RMT
Partners expense, shall use its reasonable best efforts to obtain an owners
policy of title insurance for each owned Facility from the parties mutually
agreed title insurance company in an amount reasonably agreed to by the
parties, insuring the title and interest of Splitco or Newco, as applicable,
in and to each owned Facility and any beneficial easements or rights of way
appurtenant thereto, on ALTA Forms or equivalent with such affirmative
endorsements as RMT Partner may reasonably require, and with exceptions only
for (y) any items disclosed by the above referenced surveys that do not,
individually or in the aggregate, impair in any material respect the use of
such Facility as currently conducted, and (z) Permitted Liens.

  

5.9 _Matters Relating to the Non-U.S. Transfer_. (a) In connection with
any Non-U.S. Transfer, Parent shall specify the relevant transferor or
transferors (each, a " **Non-U.S. Transferor** ") that will transfer the
applicable Non-U.S. Acquired Assets to the relevant transferee or transferees
(each, a " **Non-U.S. Transferee** "). The consideration for any Non-U.S.
Transfer shall be the fair market value thereof. To the extent, if any, that
the fair market value of the applicable Non-U.S. Acquired Assets acquired by
any applicable Non-U.S. Transferee

  



  

\- 40 -

     

exceeds the reasonably quantifiable and estimated amount of the Non-U.S.
Assumed Liabilities assumed by such Non-U.S. Transferee, the consideration
shall be paid in cash (or such other form as the parties may agree, and in any
case shall not be in the form of an Acquired Asset), and shall be reflected
appropriately on the relevant books and records of the parties. The parties
will make appropriate provision under local law and practice for the payment
of all Transfer Taxes and the delivery of all assignment, transfer and
conveyance documents applicable to such Non-U.S. Transfer. To the extent and
at the time required for applicable Tax purposes, Parent shall prepare a
purchase price allocation for any Non-U.S. Transfer, which shall be final and
binding. Parent and Splitco shall, or shall cause their respective
subsidiaries to, make all relevant elections, reports and returns (for
Tax, financial accounting and all other purposes) on a basis consistent with
such purchase price allocation. For the avoidance of doubt, except as
otherwise provided in Section 5.9((b), the Canadian Non-U.S. Transfer shall be
considered a Non-U.S. Transfer for purposes of this Agreement.

  

(b) In connection with the sale, conveyance, transfer and assignment of the
Acquired Assets that relate to the conduct of the Business in Canada (the "
**Canadian Assets** ") and the assumption of any liabilities that relate to
the conduct of the Business in Canada other than Excluded Liabilities (the "
**Canadian Liabilities** ") (the sale, conveyance, transfer and assignment of
the Canadian Assets, together with the assumption of the Canadian Liabilities,
the " **Canadian Non-U.S. Transfer** "), RMT Partner shall cause RMT Partner
Canada to acquire the Canadian Assets and assume the Canadian Liabilities from
the applicable Non-U.S. Transferor immediately after the Short Form Merger
pursuant to a Bill of Sale and any transfer documents necessary to convey the
Canadian Assets. The purchase price shall be the fair market value of the
Canadian Assets, and the parties agree that the fair market value shall equal
the net book value of the Business Inventory, the Equipment and the Facility
in Canada, subject to any adjustment pursuant to the Adjustment Payment or any
fixed asset appraisal of the Equipment and the Facility in Canada conducted by
a party approved by Parent and RMT Partner.

  

(c) RMT Partner, at RMT Partners expense, shall use its reasonable best
efforts to obtain a survey for each owned Facility which is a Canadian Asset,
and Parent, at RMT Partners expense, shall use its reasonable best efforts to
obtain an owners policy of title insurance for each owned Facility which is a
Canadian Asset from the parties mutually agreed title insurance company in an
amount reasonably agreed to by the parties, insuring the title and interest of
RMT Partner Canada in and to each such owned Facility and any beneficial
easements or rights of way appurtenant thereto, on ALTA Forms or equivalent
with such affirmative endorsements as RMT Partner may reasonably require, and
with exceptions only for (y) any items disclosed by the above referenced
surveys that do not, individually or in the aggregate, impair in any material
respect the use of such Facility as currently conducted, and (z) Permitted
Liens.

12:01 a.m. on the Distribution Date, to each Canadian Non-Represented
Employee, other than Employees on Disability Leave, in accordance with this
Section 5.10 and Section 11.3 of this Agreement, on terms and conditions that
are no less favorable with respect to title, compensation, benefits, hours of
work and location than those applicable to such Canadian Non-Represented
Employee as of the Distribution Date and with duties that are similar to the
duties being performed by such Canadian Non-Represented Employee in respect
of the Business as of the Distribution Date.

  

(iii) _Canadian Represented Employees_. Conditional on the Closing and
effective as of 12:01 a.m. on the Distribution Date, RMT Partner shall cause
RMT Partner Canada to continue the employment of all Canadian Represented
Employees and shall recognize the union listed in _Schedule 5.10(a)(iii)_ as
the sole and exclusive collective bargaining agent as of the Distribution Date
and immediately thereafter for the Canadian Represented Employees.

  

(b) _Collective Bargaining Agreements_. Splitco (or the applicable subsidiary
of Splitco) shall assume the collective bargaining agreements (collectively,
the " **CBAs** ") identified on _Schedule 5.10(b)_ effective as of 12:01 a.m.
on the Distribution Date (including the obligation to honor the terms and
conditions thereof and any obligations thereunder requiring a successor to
recognize a particular labor union as authorized representative and bargaining
agent of an employee group or for any other purpose). As of 12:01 a.m. on the
Distribution Date, Splitco (or the applicable subsidiary of Splitco) shall be
the "Employer" for purposes of each such CBA and Splitco and its subsidiaries
shall have sole responsibility for all obligations, liabilities and
commitments arising under the CBAs, and shall indemnify and hold harmless
Parent and its affiliates with respect to the CBAs. Following 12:01 a.m. on
the Distribution Date, any employee benefit required to be provided to any
Represented Employee pursuant to an employee benefit plan maintained by Parent
or any of its affiliates shall instead be provided pursuant to an employee
benefit plan maintained by Splitco, RMT Partner or one of their respective
affiliates; _provided_ that Parent shall remain responsible for, and shall
retain all liabilities associated with, benefits pursuant to any employee
benefit plan maintained by Parent or one of its affiliates that accrued with
respect to service prior to the Distribution Date.

result of such transfer is that such individual will not be considered a
Business Employee upon the Closing, provided that the list of Business
Employees shall be updated prior to Closing in accordance with Section
11.3(a).

applicable U.S. securities laws.

  

(b) To the extent the Distribution is effected as a Split-Off and the Split-
Off exchange offer is not fully subscribed (or less than the total number of
shares of Splitco Common Stock are offered in the Split-Off exchange offer),
any remaining shares of Splitco Common Stock held by Parent that are not
exchanged pursuant to the Split-Off exchange offer may be distributed in a
Spin-Off with a Distribution Record Date established in the same manner as
provided in Section 6.8(a), and on the Distribution Date up to 100,000 shares

accounting for shares of Splitco Common Stock being distributed pursuant to a
Split-Off), and on the Distribution Date up to 100,000 shares of Splitco
Common Stock may be distributed to holders of Parent Deferred Stock Awards in
connection with their Parent Deferred Stock Awards.

  

(c) To the extent the Distribution is effected in whole or in part as a Spin-
Off, each Eligible Parent Stockholder shall be entitled to receive, for each

of Splitco Common Stock equal to (x) the total number of shares of Splitco
Common Stock held by Parent on the Distribution Date (in each case after
giving effect to the issuance of Splitco Common Stock to KFG pursuant to
Section 4.8(a) and reduced by the amount of Splitco Common Stock being
distributed pursuant to a Split-Off and any shares of Splitco Common Stock
that Parent distributes on the Distribution Date to holders of Parent Deferred
Stock Awards) divided by (y) the total number of shares of Eligible Parent
Common Stock outstanding as of the Distribution Record Date.

the Distribution Agent irrevocable instructions to hold such shares of Splitco
Common Stock in trust for each such Eligible Parent Stockholder (pending
conversion of such shares of Splitco Common Stock into shares of RMT Partner
Common Stock as a result of the Splitco Merger). The " **Distribution** "
shall mean the consummation of the Split-Off or Spin-Off, as applicable;
_provided_ that for purposes of this Agreement the Distribution shall be
deemed to have occurred upon the irrevocable delivery to the Distribution
Agent of all the shares of Splitco Common Stock outstanding as of the
Distribution Date pursuant to this Section 6.9(a).

  

(b) Immediately after the Distribution and prior to the Splitco Merger
Effective Time, the shares of Splitco Common Stock shall not be transferable,

Stock to Eligible Parent Stockholders.

  

6.10 _Withholding_. Parent, Splitco or the Distribution Agent, as the case
may be, shall be entitled to deduct and withhold from the consideration
otherwise payable pursuant to this Agreement such amounts as may be required
to be deducted and withheld with respect to the making of such payment under
the Code or any provision of state, local or foreign tax law. Any withheld
amounts shall be treated for all purposes of this Agreement as having been
paid to the Persons otherwise entitled thereto.

  

6.11 _External Debt Exchange_. (a) Parent may, at its election, exchange
the Splitco Securities for debt obligations of Parent held by unrelated
parties (the " **External Debt Exchange** ") if either of the following
conditions are satisfied:

Exchange qualifies for the Intended Tax-Free Treatment and the effectiveness
of such ruling is conditioned upon the occurrence of the External Debt
Exchange; or

  

(ii) Parent does not receive a ruling from the IRS that the Internal
Debt Exchange qualifies for the Intended Tax-Free Treatment.

  

(b) In the External Debt Exchange, Parent shall acquire outstanding commercial
paper of Parent, or other outstanding debt obligations of Parent with the
shortest remaining terms to maturity, to the extent reasonably practicable as
determined by Parent in light of market conditions, discussions with the IRS
about the proposed IRS rulings concerning the External Debt Exchange (if
applicable) or discussions with tax counsel to Parent about the proposed Tax

7.1 _The Splitco Merger_. At the Splitco Merger Effective Time, which
shall occur immediately following the Distribution in accordance with the
Delaware Limited Liability Company Act (the "DLLCA") and the Delaware General
Corporation Law ("DGCL"), Splitco shall be merged with and into Merger Sub
(the " **Splitco Merger** "). At the Splitco Merger Effective Time, the
separate corporate existence of Splitco shall cease and Merger Sub shall
continue as the surviving company (the " **Splitco Merger Surviving Company**
"). Notwithstanding the foregoing, if Parent does not receive a ruling from
the IRS to the effect that the Mergers qualify for the Intended Tax-Free
Treatment, then, in the Splitco Merger, Merger Sub shall elect to be treated
as a corporation for income tax purposes and shall be merged with and into
Splitco, with Splitco continuing as the Splitco Merger Surviving Company. In
the event the direction of the Splitco Merger is reversed pursuant to the
foregoing sentence, conforming changes shall be deemed to have been made to
Sections 7.3, 7.4 and 7.5 and the parties shall execute any amendment hereto
that is reasonably required to effectuate the foregoing.

  

7.2 _Splitco Merger Effective Time_. Prior to the Closing, the parties
shall prepare, and on the Closing Date the parties shall file with the
Secretary of State of the State of Delaware, a certificate of merger or other
appropriate documents (in any such case, the " **Splitco Certificate of
Merger** ") executed in accordance with the relevant provisions of the DLLCA
and shall make all other filings or recordings required under the DLLCA. The
Splitco Merger shall become effective at such time as the Splitco Merger
Certificate of Merger is duly filed with such Secretary of State, or at such
other time as RMT Partner and Parent shall agree and specify in the Splitco
Certificate of Merger (the time the Merger becomes effective being the "
**Splitco Merger Effective Time** "); _provided_ that the Splitco Merger
Effective Time shall occur after the irrevocable delivery of Splitco Common
Stock to the Distribution Agent pursuant to Section 6.9(a).

  

7.3 _Effects_. The Splitco Merger shall have the effects set forth in
Section 209 of the DLLCA.

  

7.4 _Operating Agreement_. The Operating Agreement of Merger Sub, as in
effect immediately prior to the Splitco Merger Effective Time, shall be the
Operating Agreement of the Splitco Merger Surviving Company until thereafter
changed or amended as provided therein or by applicable law.

  

7.5 _Effect on Capital Stock_. At the Splitco Merger Effective Time, by
virtue of the Splitco Merger and without any action on the part of the holder
of any shares of Splitco Common Stock or any membership interests in Merger
Sub:

  

(a) _Capital Stock of Merger Sub_. Each membership interest in Merger Sub
shall be converted into and become one membership interest in the Splitco
Merger Surviving Company.

  



  

\- 46 -

     

(b) _Conversion of Splitco Common Stock_. Subject to Section 7.10, each
issued share of Splitco Common Stock shall be converted into the right to
receive one fully paid and nonassessable share of RMT Partner Common Stock.
The shares of RMT Partner Common Stock to be issued upon the conversion of
shares of Splitco Common Stock pursuant to this Section 7.5(b) and cash in
lieu of fractional shares of as contemplated by Section 7.10 are referred to
collectively as " **Merger Consideration**." As of the Splitco Merger
Effective Time, all such shares of Splitco Common Stock shall no longer be
outstanding and shall automatically be canceled and retired and shall cease to
exist, and any holder of a certificate representing any such shares of Splitco
Common Stock shall cease to have any rights with respect thereto, except the
right to receive Merger Consideration upon surrender of such certificate,
without interest.

  

7.6 _Exchange of Certificates_. Prior to or promptly following the
Splitco Merger Effective Time, RMT Partner shall deposit with the Distribution
Agent (or another bank or trust company appointed by Parent, which shall be
reasonably acceptable to RMT Partner) acting in the capacity as the merger
exchange agent (the " **Merger Exchange Agent** "), for the benefit of the
holders of shares of Splitco Common Stock, for exchange in accordance with
this Article 7 through the Merger Exchange Agent, certificates representing
the shares of RMT Partner Common Stock issuable pursuant to Section 7.5 in
exchange for outstanding shares of Splitco Common Stock (such shares of RMT
Partner Common Stock, together with any dividends or distributions
with respect thereto, being hereinafter referred to as the " **Exchange
Fund** "). For the purposes of such deposit, RMT Partner shall assume that
there will not be any fractional shares of RMT Partner Common Stock. RMT
Partner shall make available to the Merger Exchange Agent, for addition to the
Exchange Fund, from time to time as needed, cash sufficient to pay cash in
lieu of fractional shares in accordance with Section 7.10. The Merger Exchange
Agent shall, pursuant to irrevocable instructions, deliver the RMT Partner
Common Stock to be issued pursuant to Section 7.5 out of the Exchange Fund.
The Exchange Fund shall not be used for any other purpose.

  

7.7 _Exchange Procedures_. As soon as reasonably practicable after the
Splitco Merger Effective Time, and to the extent not previously distributed in
connection with the Distribution, the Merger Exchange Agent shall mail to any
holder of record of outstanding shares of Splitco Common Stock whose shares
were converted into the right to receive Merger Consideration pursuant to
Section 7.5, (a) a letter of transmittal (which shall specify that delivery
shall be effected, and risk of loss and title to any certificates shall pass,
only upon delivery of such certificates to the Merger Exchange Agent and shall
be in such form and have such other provisions as RMT Partner may reasonably
specify) and (b) instructions for use in effecting the surrender of any
certificates in exchange for Merger Consideration. Upon surrender of any
certificate for cancellation to the Merger Exchange Agent, together with such
letter of transmittal, duly executed, and such other documents as may
reasonably be required by the Merger Exchange Agent, the holder of such
certificate shall be entitled to receive in exchange therefor the Merger
Consideration (together with cash in lieu of fractional shares) that such
holder has the right to receive pursuant to the provisions of this Article 7,
and the certificate so surrendered shall forthwith be canceled. Until
surrendered as contemplated by this Section 7.7, any certificate shall be
deemed at any time after the Splitco Merger Effective Time to represent only
the right to receive upon such surrender Merger Consideration as contemplated
by this Section 7.7. No interest shall be paid or accrue on any cash payable
upon surrender of any certificate.

  



  

\- 47 -

     

7.8 _Distributions with Respect to Unexchanged Shares_. No dividends or
other distributions with respect to RMT Partner Common Stock with a record
date after the Splitco Merger Effective Time shall be paid to the holder of
any certificate formerly representing Splitco Common Stock with respect to the
shares of RMT Partner Common Stock issuable upon surrender thereof, and no
cash payment in lieu of fractional shares shall be paid to any such holder
pursuant to Section 7.10 until the surrender of such certificate in accordance
with this Article 7\. Subject to applicable law, following surrender of any
such certificate, there shall be paid to the holder of the certificate
representing whole shares of RMT Partner Common Stock issued in exchange
therefor, without interest, (i) at the time of such surrender, the amount of
any cash payable in lieu of a fractional share of RMT Partner Common Stock to
which such holder is entitled pursuant to Section 7.10 and the amount of
dividends or other distributions with a record date after the Splitco Merger
Effective Time theretofore paid with respect to such whole shares of RMT
Partner Common Stock and (ii) at the appropriate payment date, the amount of
dividends or other distributions with a record date after the Splitco Merger
Effective Time but prior to such surrender and a payment date subsequent to
such surrender payable with respect to such whole shares of RMT Partner Common
Stock.

  

7.9 _No Further Ownership Rights in Splitco Common Stock_. The Merger
Consideration issued (and paid) in accordance with the terms of this Article 7
upon conversion of any shares of Splitco Common Stock shall be deemed to have
been issued (and paid) in full satisfaction of all rights pertaining to such
shares of Splitco Common Stock, and after the Splitco Merger Effective Time
there shall be no further registration of transfers on the stock transfer
books of the Splitco Merger Surviving Company of shares of Splitco Common
Stock that were outstanding immediately prior to the Splitco Merger Effective
Time. If, after the Splitco Merger Effective Time, any certificates formerly
representing shares of Splitco Common Stock are presented to the Splitco
Merger Surviving Company or the Merger Exchange Agent for any reason, they
shall be canceled and exchanged as provided in this Article 7.

   

7.10 _No Fractional Shares_.

  

(a) No certificates or scrip representing fractional shares of RMT Partner
Common Stock shall be issued upon the conversion of Splitco Common Stock
pursuant to Section 7.5, and such fractional share interests shall not entitle
the owner thereof to vote or to any rights of a holder of RMT Partner Common
Stock. For purposes of this Section 7.10, all fractional shares to which a
single record holder would be entitled shall be aggregated and calculations
shall be rounded to three decimal places.

  

(b) In lieu of any such fractional shares of RMT Partner Common Stock, each
holder of Splitco Common Stock who would otherwise be entitled to such
fractional shares shall be entitled to an amount in cash, without interest,
rounded to the nearest cent, equal to the product of (x) the amount of the
fractional share interest in a share of RMT Partner Common Stock to which such
holder is entitled under Section 7.5 (or would be entitled but for this
Section 7.10) and (y) the average of the closing sale prices for RMT Partner
Common Stock on the RMT Partner Exchange, as reported in _The Wall Street
Journal_ , Northeastern edition, for each of the ten consecutive trading days

Common Stock entitled to receive such cash.

remains undistributed to the holders of Splitco Common Stock as of the first
anniversary of the Splitco Merger Effective Time shall be delivered to RMT
Partner, upon demand, and any holder of Splitco Common Stock who has not
theretofore complied with this Article 7 shall thereafter look only to RMT
Partner for payment of its claim for Merger Consideration and any dividends or
distributions with respect to RMT Partner Common Stock as contemplated by

the Exchange Fund delivered to a public official pursuant to any abandoned
property, escheat or similar law.

  

7.13 _Investment of Exchange Fund_. The Merger Exchange Agent shall invest
any cash included in the Exchange Fund, as directed by RMT Partner, on a daily
basis. Any interest and other income resulting from such investments shall be
paid to RMT Partner.

Company or the Merger Exchange Agent, as the case may be, shall be entitled to
deduct and withhold from the consideration otherwise payable pursuant to this
Agreement such amounts as may be required to be deducted and withheld with
respect to the making of such payment under the Code or any provision of
state, local or foreign tax law. Any withheld amounts shall be treated for all
purposes of this Agreement as having been paid to the Persons otherwise
entitled thereto.

  

7.15 _The Short Form Merger_. At the Short Form Merger Effective Time,
which shall occur immediately following the Splitco Merger in accordance with
the General and Business Corporation Law of Missouri (the "GBCL") and the
DLLCA, the Splitco Merger Surviving Company shall be merged with and into RMT
Partner (the " **Short Form Merger** "). At the Short Form Merger Effective
Time, the separate corporate existence of the Splitco Merger Surviving Company

shall prepare, and on the Closing Date the parties shall file with the

claims or legal, administrative or arbitration proceedings pending or, to
Parents Knowledge, threatened under any applicable Environmental Law relating
to the Business, (d) neither Parent nor any of its affiliates has stored or

(e) neither Parent nor any of its affiliates has received any written notice
(i) of any violation of any Environmental Laws or (ii) alleging liability for,

period shall be extended in the event that Parent has entered into a
definitive agreement to dispose of such business within such one year period

in any discussions or negotiations regarding, or furnish to any Person any
information with respect to, or take any other action to facilitate any

foregoing, it is agreed that any violation of the restrictions set forth in
the preceding sentence by any Representative or affiliate of Parent, Splitco
or any of their subsidiaries, whether or not such Person is purporting to act
on behalf of Parent, Splitco or any of their subsidiaries or otherwise, shall
be deemed to be a breach of this Section 10.7(a) by Parent. Parent shall, and
shall cause its Representatives to, cease immediately any discussions and
negotiations regarding any proposal that constitutes, or may reasonably be
expected to lead to, a Splitco Takeover Proposal.

related goods or services subject to the following limitations: (i) the
prohibitions on the use of the marks SPOONSIZE, TRAIL MIX CRUNCH, and any
marks confusingly similar to any of the Assigned Key Marks shall expire five

prohibitions contained herein shall not apply to the use of the words "trail

granola bars manufactured or distributed by Parent or any of its subsidiaries
or affiliates prior to or after the Closing Date,

all such actions as are necessary to provide that each Parent Stock Award that

Business Employee who is employed by Parent or one of its affiliates as of
such date will become vested upon the Closing with respect to a number of
shares of Parent Common Stock (rounded down to the nearest whole share)
subject to such Parent Stock Award as determined in accordance with the
immediately following sentence. Such number shall be determined by multiplying
the total number of shares of Parent Common Stock subject to such Parent Stock
Award by a fraction, the numerator of which is equal to the number of full
years (if any) that have elapsed following the grant of such Parent
Stock Award, and the denominator of which is equal to three, provided that in
no event will the numerator equal or exceed the denominator. Following
settlement by Parent of the portion of each Parent Stock Award that vests in
accordance with this Section 10.11, Parent shall have no further obligations
with respect to such Parent Stock Award or any other Parent Stock Awards held
by Transferred Employees.

   

10.12 _Acknowledgment Regarding Intellectual Property_.

  

(a) Nothing in this Agreement constitutes or shall be construed to constitute
any agreement, consent, permission, waiver, or the like by RMT Partner and
Splitco, that Parent or any of its related subsidiaries can use any
Intellectual Property (other than the rights to Intellectual Property licensed
to or used by the joint venture described in _Schedule 4.3(n)_ ), including
any Retained Intellectual Property and/or any subsequently developed
Intellectual Property of Parent that is likely to be confused with, infringe,
misappropriate, and/or otherwise violate, any of RMT Partners, Splitcos,
and/or any of their subsidiaries rights in any Acquired Intellectual
Property. Further, Parent recognizes, acknowledges, and agrees that RMT
Partner, Splitco, and their subsidiaries and affiliates, shall have the
right to, and nothing in this Agreement shall in any way preclude them from,
bringing any actions against Parent, its subsidiaries, affiliates, or related
parties, for infringement, misappropriation, or any other violations of RMT
Partners, Splitcos, and their subsidiaries and affiliates, intellectual
property rights including, but not limited to, in, and under any of the
Acquired Intellectual Property. RMT Partner and Splitco expressly recognize,
agree and acknowledge that neither they nor any of their affiliates,
subsidiaries or related entities shall challenge, interfere with or object to
the rights to Intellectual Property licensed to or used by the joint venture
described in _Schedule 4.3(n)_.

  

(b) The use and operation of the Facilities and Equipment by RMT Partner,
Splitco, and/or their subsidiaries and affiliates in the conduct of the
Business as conducted by Parent or its subsidiaries or affiliates as of the
date of this Agreement, and/or the five (5) year period preceding the date of
this Agreement, will not infringe, misappropriate, and/or otherwise violate
any rights in any Retained Intellectual Property; therefore, Parent, its
subsidiaries and affiliates, hereby covenant and agree that they will not
hereafter allege, object to, and/or bring, commence, prosecute or maintain, or
cause or permit to be brought, commenced, prosecuted or maintained, any suit
or action, either at law or in equity, in any court in the United States or in
any state thereof, or anywhere else in the world, against RMT Partner,
Splitco, and their

  



  

\- 83 -

     

subsidiaries, affiliates, successors, or assigns, for, on account of, arising
out of, or in any way connected with, the use and operation by any of them of
the Facilities, Equipment, and/or any processes, methods, systems, apparatus,
and/or technical information used in connection therewith as such Facilities,
Equipment, and/or any processes, methods, systems, apparatus, and/or technical
information, was used in the conduct of the Business by Parent and/or its
subsidiaries and/or affiliates as of the date of this Agreement, or during the
five (5) years preceding the date of this Agreement; provided, however, that
this provision shall not preclude Parents enforcement of any rights it may
have under any of the Collateral Agreements or any other agreement entered
into by and between the parties after the Closing Date; and _provided further_
, however, that this provision shall not prevent the exercise by RMT Partner,
Splitco, and/or their subsidiaries or affiliates of any rights any of them may
receive under any of the Collateral Agreements or any other agreement entered
into by and between the parties after the Closing Date.

  

(c) Nothing in this Agreement constitutes or shall be construed to constitute
any agreement, consent, permission, waiver, or the like by Parent (i) that RMT
Partner, Splitco, or any of its related subsidiaries can use any Intellectual
Property, including any subsequently developed Intellectual Property by
Parent, other than Acquired Intellectual Property and as permitted under any
Collateral Agreement, and other than the right to use and employ the
Facilities, Equipment, and/or any processes, methods, systems, apparatus,
and/or technical information used in connection therewith, as they were used
and/or employed as of the date of this Agreement and for the five (5) year
period preceding the date of this Agreement, or (ii) that use by RMT Partner,
Splitco, or any of its related subsidiaries of any Intellectual Property,
including any subsequently developed Intellectual Property by Kraft, but
specifically excluding Acquired Intellectual Property used for the Business
(and the right to use and employ the Facilities, Equipment, and/or any
processes, methods, systems, apparatus, and/or technical information used in
connection therewith), does not infringe any intellectual property rights of
Parent. Further, each of RMT Partner and Splitco recognizes, acknowledges, and
agrees that Parent and its subsidiaries and affiliates shall have the right
to, and nothing in this Agreement shall in any way preclude them from,
bringing any actions against RMT Partner, Splitco, either of their
subsidiaries, affiliates, or related parties, for infringement,
misappropriation, or any other violations of Parents or its subsidiaries and
affiliates intellectual property rights including, but not limited to, in,
and under any of the Retained Intellectual Property other than: (x) any claims
arising out of RMT Partners, Splitcos, or any of their subsidiaries use of
Acquired Intellectual Property in connection with the Business, and as
permitted under any Collateral Agreements; or (y) any claims arising out of
RMT Partners, Splitcos, or any of their subsidiaries use or employment of
the Facilities, Equipment, and/or any processes, methods, systems, apparatus,
and/or technical information used in connection therewith, as they were used
and/or employed as of the date of this Agreement and for the five (5) year
period preceding the date of this Agreement.

  



  

10.13 _Additional Matters_. Parent shall take or cause to be taken the
actions set forth on Schedule 10.13.

11.2 _Confidential Information_. Effective upon the Closing, information
provided to RMT Partner or its affiliates that relates primarily to the
Business, the Acquired Assets and the Assumed Liabilities shall (to the extent
such information relates to the Business, the Acquired Assets and the Assumed
Liabilities but not to the extent such information relates to retained
businesses, assets and liabilities of Parent) become RMT Partners
information. RMT Partner acknowledges that any and all information provided to
it concerning Parent, including any of its businesses or products (other than
information that shall become RMT Partners information pursuant to the
immediately preceding sentence), shall remain subject to the terms and
conditions of the Confidentiality Agreement after the Closing.

   

11.3 _Employees and Employee Benefits_.

  



  

\- 86 -

     

(a) _Business Employees_. Within ten business days following the date of this
Agreement, Parent shall deliver to RMT Partner a list of each employee of
Parent and its affiliates who is employed primarily in the Business, including
the job title and location for each such employee and indicating which
employees are Employees on Disability Leave (such list to be updated prior to
Closing). All such employees are referred to herein as the " **Business
Employees**." All Business Employees who are union represented employees
covered by a collective bargaining agreement are referred to herein as the "
**Represented Employees** ," and all Business Employees who are not
Represented Employees are referred to herein as the " **Non-Represented
Employees**." Business Employees who transfer to RMT Partner, Splitco or one
of their respective affiliates pursuant to this Agreement, as of the effective
date of such transfer, shall be referred to as " **Transferred Employees**."
With respect to any Business Employee on approved leave of absence as of the
Distribution Date (including, without limitation, military leave and leave
under the Family and Medical Leave Act or other applicable laws), other than
any Employee on Disability Leave, who transfers to RMT Partner, Splitco or one
of their respective affiliates, at and following such employees Transfer
Time, RMT Partner and its affiliates shall continue such employees leave of
absence in accordance with the leave policy of RMT Partner and its affiliates.
Effective as of the date on which an Employee on Disability Leave presents
himself or herself to RMT Partner or one of its affiliates for active
employment following the Distribution Date, RMT Partner shall, or shall cause
one of its affiliates to, make an offer of employment (in compliance with the
covenants set forth in this Section 11.3 and, in the case of any Canadian Non-
Represented Employee, in compliance with the requirements of Section
5.10(a)(ii)) to such Employee on Disability Leave to the same extent, if any,
as Parent or its affiliates would have been required to re-employ or offer
continued employment to, as applicable, such Employee on Disability Leave if
the transactions contemplated by this Agreement had not occurred; _provided_ ,
_however_ , that subject to any additional requirements under applicable law,
RMT Partner or its affiliates shall only be required to re-employ or offer
continued employment to an Employee on Disability Leave if such employee
presents himself or herself for active employment on or prior to the earlier
of (i) the second anniversary of the Distribution Date and (ii) solely in the
case of a Represented Employee, such earlier date as permitted under the
applicable collective bargaining agreement. Each Employee on Disability Leave
who accepts such offer and actually returns to work shall be considered a
Transferred Employee, effective as of the date of such return, which shall be
such employees Transfer Time. RMT Partner and Splitco are acquiring the
Business as a going concern for the purpose of carrying out a business that is
similar to the Business following the Closing, and RMT Partner does not
currently anticipate the cessation of operations at any of the Facilities of
the Business. Parent and RMT Partner intend that the transactions contemplated
by this Agreement shall not constitute a severance or termination of
employment of any Business Employee prior to or upon the Closing, and that
Business Employees shall have continuous and uninterrupted employment
immediately before and immediately after the Closing. Nothing herein shall be
construed as a representation or guarantee by Parent or RMT Partner that any
particular Business Employee shall transfer to Splitco or any of its
subsidiaries or shall continue in employment with RMT Partner or its
affiliates following the Closing. If any Transferred Employee requires a visa,
work permit or employment pass or other approval for his or her employment to
continue with RMT Partner or its affiliates following such employees Transfer
Time, RMT Partner shall use its reasonable best efforts to see that any
necessary applications are promptly made and to secure the necessary visa,
permit, pass or other approval. RMT Partner and its affiliates shall comply

  



  

\- 87 -

     

with all applicable laws and all applicable collective bargaining agreements
relating to the offers of employment to, and continuation of employment of,
the Business Employees at and after 12:01 a.m. on the Distribution Date. For
greater certainty, in the event that proceedings are initiated before the
Ontario Labour Relations Board seeking a declaration that there has been a
"sale of business" pursuant to s. 69 of the Ontario Labour Relations Act, 1995
and consequential orders, RMT Partner will not take the position that the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement do not constitute a "sale" of a
"business" as contemplated by that Act. Notwithstanding anything herein to the
contrary, Parent and its affiliates shall remain responsible for any and all
liabilities relating to the employment and/or re-employment of any Business
Employee who terminates employment with Parent and its affiliates prior to
the Distribution Date or who is an Employee on Disability Leave and does not
present himself or herself for active employment on or prior to the earlier of
the dates set forth in clauses (i) and (ii) above.

  

(b) _Continuation of Benefits Generally_. Except as specifically provided in
this Agreement, as of the Transfer Time of any Transferred Employee, such
Transferred Employee shall cease active participation in and accrual of
benefits under the Parent Benefit Plans. During the Benefits Continuation
Period, RMT Partner shall provide, or shall cause one of its affiliates to
provide, to each Transferred Employee who is employed by RMT Partner or its
affiliates a base salary and target cash incentives no lower than those
provided to such employee immediately prior to such employees Transfer Time;
_provided_ that nothing in this Agreement shall require RMT Partner to
continue, or cause any of its affiliates to continue, to employ any
Transferred Employee. In addition to the requirements relating to base salary
and target cash incentives, in the case of each U.S. Transferred Employee who
is a U.S. Non-Represented Employee, during the Benefits Continuation Period,
RMT Partner shall, or shall cause one of its affiliates to (i) maintain for
the benefit of each such U.S. Transferred Employee tax-qualified and
nonqualified defined benefit pension plans that are at least as favorable with
respect to such U.S. Transferred Employee with respect to benefit accrual
formulas, vesting and eligibility for retirement and early retirement
subsidies as those benefits provided to such U.S. Transferred Employee under
the tax-qualified and nonqualified defined benefit plans maintained by Parent
and its affiliates immediately prior to such U.S. Transferred Employees
Transfer Date and (ii) maintain for the benefit of each such U.S. Transferred
Employee tax-qualified and nonqualified defined contribution plans that are at
least as favorable to such U.S. Transferred Employee with respect to vesting
and level of employer contributions as those benefits provided to such U.S.
Transferred Employee under the tax-qualified and nonqualified defined
contribution plans maintained by Parent and its affiliates immediately prior
to such U.S. Transferred Employees Transfer Date. Each U.S. Transferred
Employee who is a U.S. Non-Represented Employee shall be eligible to
participate in the employee benefit plans maintained by RMT Partner and its
affiliates from time to time which are described in Schedule 11.3(b)(i) and
applicable to such U.S. Transferred Employee. Nothing herein shall be
construed as a representation or guarantee by RMT Partner or one of its
affiliates that it shall maintain any RMT Partner Benefit Plan listed on
Schedule 11.3(b)(i) for any particular period of time, and RMT Partner shall
be permitted to amend, modify or terminate such RMT Partner Benefit Plans in
accordance with their terms, provided that any such amendment, modification
or termination that applies to any Transferred Employee shall apply on the
same basis to all other similarly situated employees of RMT Partner and its
affiliates. In addition, following the Distribution Date, RMT Partner shall
provide, or shall cause its affiliates to provide, the Transferred Employees
who are described in Schedule 11.3(b)(ii) with the compensation described in
Schedule 11.3(b)(ii). In addition to the

  



  

\- 88 -

     

requirements relating to base salary and target cash incentives, in the case
of each Canadian Transferred Employee who is a Canadian Non-Represented
Employee, during the Benefits Continuation Period, RMT Partner shall, or shall
cause one of its affiliates to provide each such Canadian Transferred Employee
with other compensation and employee benefits that, in the aggregate, are no
less favorable than those provided to such Canadian Transferred Employee
immediately prior to such employees Transfer Time. At and following the
Distribution Date, RMT Partner and its affiliates will provide Represented
Employees with compensation and benefits in accordance with all applicable
laws and all applicable CBAs. Except as otherwise required pursuant to
applicable law or any applicable CBA and except as set forth in Sections
11.3(d), 11.3(h), 11.3(i) and 11.3(m) and Schedule 11.3(b)(ii), any
such employee benefit plans may be amended or terminated at any time by RMT
Partner in its discretion or otherwise in accordance with the terms of the
relevant plan. Prior to the Distribution Date, RMT Partner shall provide
Parent with a written description of the compensation and benefits programs
that shall apply to the U.S. Represented Employees and the Canadian Business
Employees following the Distribution Date.

  

(c) _Service Credit_. For all purposes relating to employment, including
determining eligibility to participate, level of benefits, vesting, benefit
accruals and early retirement subsidies, under any employee benefit plans and
arrangements and employment-related entitlements sponsored, provided,
maintained or contributed to by RMT Partner or its affiliates providing
benefits to any Transferred Employee at any time at or after such employees
Transfer Time (the " **New Plans** "), each Transferred Employee shall be
credited for his or her service with Parent and its affiliates (and any
predecessors) before such employees Transfer Time, to the same extent as such
Transferred Employee was entitled, before the relevant Transfer Time, to
credit for such service under any comparable Parent Benefit Plan in which
such Transferred Employee participated immediately before such employees
Transfer Time (such plans, collectively, the " **Old Plans** "), except (i)
for purposes of benefit accrual under any final average pay defined benefit
pension plan, (ii) with respect to any plan or benefit under any plan that is
listed in Schedule 11.3(c), to the extent provided in such schedule or (iii)
as would result in any duplication of benefits for the same period of service.
In addition, and without limiting the generality of the foregoing, as of each
Transferred Employees Transfer Time: (A) each such Transferred Employee shall
be immediately eligible to participate, without any waiting time, in any and
all New Plans to the extent coverage under such New Plan replaces coverage
under an Old Plan; and (B) for purposes of each New Plan providing medical,
dental, pharmaceutical and/or vision benefits to any Transferred Employee,
RMT Partner shall cause all pre-existing condition exclusions and actively-at-
work requirements of such New Plan to be waived for such employee and his or
her covered dependents, to the extent such exclusions or requirements were
waived or satisfied under the corresponding Old Plan, and RMT Partner shall
cause any eligible expenses incurred by such employee and his or her covered
dependents during the portion of the plan year of the Old Plan ending on the
date such employees participation in the corresponding New Plan begins to be
taken into account under such New Plan for purposes of satisfying all
deductible, co-insurance and maximum out-of-pocket requirements applicable to
such employee and his or her covered dependents for the applicable plan year
as if such amounts had been paid in accordance with such New Plan.
Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary and except as specifically set
forth in Sections 11.3(d), 11.3(h), 11.3(i) and 11.3(m) and Schedule
11.3(b)(ii), RMT Partner and its affiliates shall have no obligation to
provide any particular employee benefit or employee benefit plan and may amend
or terminate any New Plan

  



  

\- 89 -

     

or any other employee benefit plan at any time in its discretion or as
otherwise set forth in the respective plan.

  

(d) _Severance_. If, during the Benefits Continuation Period, RMT Partner or
its affiliates terminates the employment of any Transferred Employee without
Cause or subjects any Transferred Employee to any indefinite lay-off, or if
any Transferred Employee voluntarily terminates employment because a condition
of continued employment is such employees agreement to relocate to regularly
report to work at a job site more than 50 miles from such employees job site
immediately prior to the such employees Transfer Time (each such employee
whose employment is terminated under one of the foregoing circumstances, a "
**Terminated Employee** "), RMT Partner or its affiliates shall pay to such
Terminated Employee severance in an amount equal to the greatest of (i) the
severance pay due under the applicable severance plan of RMT Partner and its
affiliates, (ii) the severance pay that would have been due under the
severance plan of Parent and its affiliates (including a CBA) that was
applicable to such Terminated Employee immediately prior to such employees
Transfer Time, (iii) in the case of exempt U.S. Non-Represented Employees,
three months base salary, (iv) in the case of non-exempt U.S. Non-Represented
Employees (including both hourly and salaried non-exempt employees), six
weeks base salary and (v) the severance and termination pay and benefits
continuation and any other notice, pay in lieu of notice, pay, benefits or
compensation that is required by applicable law. The level of severance
benefits a Terminated Employee is entitled to receive pursuant to clauses (i)
through (v) of the preceding sentence shall be determined by taking into
account such Terminated Employees service with Parent and its affiliates (and
any predecessors) prior to such employees Transfer Time and such Terminated
Employees service with RMT Partner and its affiliates on and after such
employees Transfer Time. In addition, subject to the immediately following
sentence, RMT Partner or its affiliates shall continue to provide to each
Terminated Employee and his or her covered dependents with group health plan
coverage (on the same terms as are applicable to similarly situated active
employees and their covered dependents, and at no greater cost to such
Terminated Employee than would be applicable were such Terminated Employee
still employed) during the Severance Period, _provided_ that (i) in the case
of U.S. Transferred Employees, such employees properly elect COBRA Coverage
and (ii) such continued group health plan coverage shall cease to be provided
upon the first to occur of the following: (A) solely in the case of U.S.
Transferred Employees, the date such Terminated Employee ceases to be
eligible for COBRA Coverage, (B) the date that such Terminated Employee
becomes eligible for another group health plan from a subsequent employer, and
(C) the date on which the Severance Period expires. RMT Partner or its
affiliates shall provide outplacement services to any Terminated Employee
entitled to severance benefits pursuant to this paragraph that are reasonable
with respect to such employee. For purposes of this paragraph, " **Cause** "
shall mean, (1) solely in the case of any Canadian Business Employee, conduct
which allows the employer to terminate such employee without notice or pay in
lieu of notice under applicable law, or (2) solely in the case of any U.S.
Business Employee, such U.S. Business Employees material and willful
misconduct, willful refusal (other than as a result of incapacity due to
physical or mental illness) to perform substantially his or her job
responsibilities after a written demand for substantial performance has been
delivered to such employee by RMT Partner or its affiliates, or conviction of
a felony or non-felony crime involving fraud or dishonesty. " **Severance
Period** " shall mean, with respect to any Terminated Employee, a number of
weeks determined by dividing such Terminated Employees cash severance benefit
by such Terminated Employees weekly base rate of pay. At and following the

  



  

\- 90 -

     

applicable Transfer Time, RMT Partner and its affiliates shall be solely
liable with respect to the Business Employees for all severance and
termination pay and benefits continuation and any other notice, pay in lieu of
notice, pay, benefits or compensation that is required by applicable law, and
shall indemnify and hold harmless Parent and its affiliates with respect to
all such liabilities, obligations and commitments. Notwithstanding any
provision of this Section 11.3(d) to the contrary, except as otherwise
required by applicable law or an applicable collective bargaining agreement,
no Business Employee will be entitled to any of the severance or separation
benefits pursuant to this Section 11.3(d) unless and until such Business
Employee executes a release of claims in favor of Parent, RMT Partner and each
of their respective affiliates and each of their respective predecessors,
successors, parents and affiliates, and their respective present and former
officers, directors, employees and agents, and the release becomes effective
and irrevocable.

  

(e) _Welfare Benefits Generally_. With respect to Transferred Employees, (i)
Parent and its affiliates shall be solely responsible in accordance with their
applicable welfare benefit plans for (A) claims for the type of benefits
described in Section 3(1) of ERISA (whether or not covered by ERISA) ("
**Welfare Benefits** ") and for workers compensation benefits, in each case
that are incurred by or with respect to any Transferred Employee before his or
her Transfer Time, and (B) claims relating to health continuation coverage
required by Section 4980B of the Code or Part 6 of Subpart B of Title I of
ERISA (" **COBRA Coverage** ") attributable to "qualifying events" with
respect to any U.S. Transferred Employee and his or her beneficiaries and
dependents that occur before such U.S. Transferred Employees Transfer Time,
and (ii) RMT Partner and its affiliates shall be solely responsible in
accordance with their applicable welfare benefit plans for (A) claims for
Welfare Benefits and for workers compensation benefits, in each case that are
incurred by or with respect to any Transferred Employee after his or her
Transfer Time, and (B) claims relating to COBRA Coverage attributable to
"qualifying events" with respect to any U.S. Transferred Employee and his or
her beneficiaries and dependents that occur after such U.S. Transferred
Employees Transfer Time. For purposes of the foregoing, a claim shall be
deemed to be incurred as follows: (1) life, accidental death and
dismemberment, and business travel accident insurance benefits, upon the death
or accident giving rise to such benefits, (2) health, dental and prescription
drug benefits (including in respect of any hospital confinement), upon
provision of such services, materials or supplies, _provided_ that, in the
case of any hospital confinement, the provision of such services, materials or
supplies shall be deemed to have occurred at the time the relevant hospital
stay commenced, and (3) disability or workers compensation benefits, upon the
occurrence of the injury or condition giving rise to the claim, but in the
case of an injury or condition occurring before the Transfer Time, only if
such claim is actually filed before the third anniversary of the Transfer
Time. In the case of workers compensation claims relating to an injury or
condition that occurred over a period both preceding and following the
Transfer Time, subject to the immediately preceding sentence, the claim shall
be the joint responsibility of Parent and RMT Partner and shall be equitably
apportioned among them based upon the relative periods of time that the
condition or injury transpired preceding and following the Transfer Time.

  

(f) _Vacation_. From and after each Transferred Employees Transfer Time, RMT
Partner, Splitco or one of their respective affiliates shall assume and honor
all unused vacation and, to the extent applicable, paid time off days of the
Transferred Employees (i) that accrued during the calendar year of and prior
to the applicable Transfer Time or (ii) solely to the extent

  



  

\- 91 -

     

required by applicable law or any applicable collective bargaining agreements
that accrued prior to the calendar year of the applicable Transfer Time, and
shall hold harmless Parent and its affiliates in respect of any liabilities
with respect to such accrued vacation and paid time off.

  

(g) _Cash Compensation Obligations_. Parent and its affiliates shall retain
liability for payment of base salary, wages and overtime pay for each Business
Employee accruing prior to such Business Employees Transfer Time, and RMT
Partner and its affiliates shall assume responsibility for payments of base
salary, wages and overtime pay to each Transferred Employee accruing at or
after such Transferred Employees Transfer Time. Parent shall make a prorated
annual bonus payment to each Transferred Employee (other than any Employee on
Disability Leave), the amount (if any) of which shall equal the product of
such Transferred Employees annual bonus amount (as described in the
immediately following sentence) multiplied by a fraction, the numerator of
which is the number of days in the calendar year during which the
Distribution Date occurs that elapse prior to the Distribution Date, and the
denominator of which is 365. Parent may determine the annual bonus amount
using any good faith methodology (which need not be the same for each
Transferred Employee), including, without limitation, by basing such amount
upon target bonus or upon actual performance. Such prorated bonuses shall be
paid no later than the date on which Parent pays annual bonuses to similarly
situated other employees of Parent and its affiliates. In the case of any
Employee on Disability Leave, Parent and its affiliates will comply with all
applicable laws relating to the payment to such employee of a prorated annual
bonus with respect to the period that precedes the Distribution Date.

  

(h) _U.S. Tax-Qualified Retirement Plans_. Parent shall retain all liabilities
and obligations under the Parent Benefit Plans that are Parent Qualified Plans
(other than in respect of a U.S. Transferred Employees account balance under
the Parent 401(k) Plan that is rolled over to the RMT Partner 401(k) Plan
pursuant to this Section 11.3(h) in respect of benefits accrued thereunder by
Business Employees prior to such employees Transfer Time. No Transferred
Employee shall accrue any benefit under such plans in respect of service with
RMT Partner or any of its affiliates after such employees Transfer Time. No
assets or liabilities of any Parent Benefit Plan that is a Parent Qualified
Plan shall be transferred to a retirement plan maintained by RMT Partner or
any of its affiliates, other than in connection with a rollover of a U.S.
Transferred Employees account balance under the Parent 401(k) Plan. RMT
Partner or its applicable affiliate shall cause a tax-qualified defined
contribution plan that includes a cash or deferred arrangement within the
meaning of Section 401(k) of the Code established or maintained by RMT Partner
or such affiliate (" **RMT Partner 401(k) Plan** ") to accept eligible
rollover distributions (as defined in Section 402(c)(4) of the Code) from U.S.
Transferred Employees with respect to such U.S. Transferred Employees account
balances (including loans) under the Parent Qualified Plans that include a
cash or deferred arrangement within the meaning of Section 401(k) of the Code
(collectively, the " **Parent 401(k) Plan** ") in the form of cash (and, as
applicable, promissory notes with respect to loans), if elected by such U.S.
Transferred Employees in accordance with applicable law and the applicable
Parent 401(k) Plan and RMT Partner 401(k) Plan; _provided_ that such loans
would not be treated as taxable distributions at any time prior to such
transfer and _provided further_ that in no event shall the applicable RMT
Partner 401(k) Plan be required to accept the transfer of stock. The rollovers
described herein shall comply with applicable law, and each party shall make
all filings and take any actions required of such party under applicable law
in connection therewith. The foregoing provisions relating to

  



  

\- 92 -

     

account balance rollovers are subject to each of Parents and RMT Partners
reasonable satisfaction that the Parent 401(k) Plan or the RMT Partner 401(k)
Plan, as applicable, continues to satisfy the requirements for a qualified
plan under Section 401(a) of the Code and that the trust that forms a part of
such plan is exempt from tax under Section 501(a) of the Code.

  

(i) _U.S. Flexible Spending Account Plans_. As of the Distribution Date, RMT
Partner or one of its affiliates shall establish flexible spending accounts
for medical and dependent care expenses under a new or existing plan (" **RMT
Partner s FSA**") for each Transferred Employee who, on or prior to the
Distribution Date, is a participant in a flexible spending account for medical
or dependent care expenses under a Parent Benefit Plan (" **Parent s FSA**")
and shall honor and continue, through December 31 of the year in which the
Distribution Date occurs, the elections made by each such Transferred Employee
under Parents FSA in respect of such flexible spending accounts that are in
effect immediately prior to the Distribution Date. Subject to RMT Partner
being provided all information reasonably necessary to permit the
administrator of RMT Partners FSA to accommodate the inclusion of the
Transferred Employees in RMT Partners FSA on the basis described herein, RMT
Partner or one of its affiliates shall credit or debit, as applicable,
effective as of the Distribution Date, the applicable account of each
Transferred Employee under RMT Partners FSA with an amount equal to the
balance of each such Transferred Employees account under Parents FSA as of
immediately prior to the Distribution Date. As soon as practicable after the
Distribution Date, Parent shall pay to RMT Partner or one of its affiliates
the net aggregate amount of the account balances credited under RMT Partners
FSA, if such amount is positive, and RMT Partner or one of its affiliates
shall pay to Parent the net aggregate amount of the account balances credited
under RMT Partners FSA, if such amount is negative. From and after the
Distribution Date, RMT Partner or one of its affiliates shall assume and be
solely responsible for all claims by U.S. Transferred Employees under Parents
FSA incurred at any time during the calendar year in which the Distribution
Date occurs, whether incurred prior to, on or after such date, that have not
been paid in full as of such date. For purposes of this Section 11.3(i), a
claim for reimbursement shall be deemed to have been incurred on the date on
which the charge or expense giving rise to such claim is incurred.

  

(j) _WARN Act_. RMT Partner shall assume liability for, and shall indemnify
and hold harmless Parent and its affiliates with respect to, any liabilities
incurred by Parent and its affiliates pursuant to the Worker Adjustment and
Retraining Notification Act and any similar statute in connection with any
Business Employee, to the extent such liability arises from actions of RMT
Partner or its affiliates.

  

(k) _U.S. Employment Tax Reporting_. RMT Partner and Parent hereby agree to
follow the alternate procedure for United States employment Tax withholding as
provided in Section 5 of Rev. Proc. 2004-53, I.R.B. 2004-34. Accordingly,
Parent shall have no United States employment Tax reporting responsibilities,
and RMT Partner and its affiliates shall have full United States employment
Tax reporting responsibilities, for each Transferred Employee subject to
United States employment Taxes on and following such employees Transfer Time.

  

(l) _Retiree Welfare Benefits_. Parent shall retain all liability relating to
and shall be responsible for providing any retiree welfare benefits, including
without limitation, retiree life, medical and dental benefits, to any Business
Employees who retired or who has satisfied the

  



  

\- 93 -

     

age and service requirements to become eligible for such benefits pursuant to
the applicable Parent Benefit Plan prior to the applicable Transfer Time (each
such Business Employee, a " **Retiree Medical Eligible Employee** "), and to
their covered dependents. Neither RMT Partner nor any of its affiliates shall
assume such liability with respect to Retiree Medical Eligible Employees and
their covered dependents. In the case of any Transferred Employee who is not a
Retiree Medical Eligible Employee, RMT Partner shall be responsible, in
accordance with its applicable welfare plans and arrangements and any
applicable collective bargaining agreement, to provide retiree welfare
benefits to such Transferred Employee. Notwithstanding any provision of this
Agreement to the contrary, (i) nothing herein shall prohibit Parent from
amending, modifying or terminating any of its post-retirement welfare plans
or prevent the application of any such amendment, modification or termination
to any Retiree Medical Eligible Employee, _provided_ that Parent shall retain
all liability arising out of or otherwise relating to any actions that it
takes to effect the foregoing provisions, (ii) RMT Partner shall provide, or
cause its affiliates to provide, Retiree Medical Eligible Employees with
medical coverage under RMT Partners plans on the same basis as such coverage
is provided to other similarly situated Transferred Employees for so long as
such Retiree Medical Eligible Employees remain actively employed with RMT
Partner or any of its affiliates, and (iii) while a Retiree Medical Eligible
Employee remains eligible for coverage under RMT Partners plans in accordance
with the preceding clause (ii), such Retiree Medical Eligible Employee shall
not be permitted to receive post-retirement medical benefits pursuant to
Parents plans, _provided_ that Parent shall retain all liability arising out
of or otherwise relating to any failure to provide post-retirement medical
benefits pursuant to its plans during the period set forth in this clause
(iii).

  

(m) _Canadian Pension Plans_. (i) Parent or one of its affiliates shall retain
all liabilities and obligations under the Canadian Parent Hourly Pension Plan
and the Canadian Parent Salaried Pension Plans in respect of benefits accrued
thereunder by Business Employees prior to such employees Transfer Time. No
Transferred Employee shall accrue any benefit under such plans in respect of
service with RMT Partner or any of its affiliates after such employees
Transfer Time. No assets or liabilities of the Canadian Parent Hourly Pension
Plan or the Canadian Parent Salaried Pension Plans shall be transferred to a
retirement plan maintained by RMT Partner or any of its affiliates.

  

(ii) RMT Partner or its applicable affiliate shall establish a
registered defined benefit pension plan and associated funding vehicle to be
effective as of 12:01 a.m. on the Distribution Date to provide pension
benefits for the Represented Transferred Employees who participated in the
Canadian Parent Hourly Pension Plan immediately prior to such employees
Transfer Time and shall register such plan and funding vehicle with the
appropriate regulatory authorities (the " **RMT Partner Hourly Pension Plan**
"). The RMT Partner Hourly Pension Plan shall contain provisions which comply
in all respects with all applicable laws and with the applicable CBA which
shall be assumed by RMT Partner or its applicable affiliate. Each such
Represented Transferred Employee will be eligible to and shall become a
member of the RMT Partner Hourly Pension Plan immediately upon the employees
Transfer Time. The RMT Partner Hourly Pension Plan shall be a successor
pension plan to the Canadian Parent Hourly Pension Plan for the purposes of
Section 80 of the Ontario _Pension Benefits Act_ , R.S.O. 1990, c. P.8. Prior
to the Distribution Date, RMT Partner shall provide Parent with evidence
reasonably satisfactory to Parent of the establishment of the RMT Partner
Hourly Pension Plan.

  



  

\- 94 -

     

(iii) RMT Partner or its applicable affiliate shall establish a
registered defined contribution pension plan and associated funding vehicle to
be effective as of 12:01 a.m. on the Distribution Date to provide pension
benefits for the Non-Represented Transferred Employees who participated in
either of the Canadian Parent Salaried Pension Plans immediately prior to such
employees Transfer Time and shall register such plan and funding vehicle with
the appropriate regulatory authority (the " **RMT Partner Salaried Pension
Plan** "). The RMT Partner Salaried Pension Plan shall provide, for a period
of two years following the Distribution Date, benefits in respect of service
after each Non-Represented Transferred Employees Transfer Time that are of
substantially equal value to the benefits provided under the provisions of
the applicable Canadian Parent Salaried Pension Plan as such plan existed
immediately prior to such employees Transfer Time. Each such Non-Represented
Transferred Employee will be eligible to and shall become a member of the RMT
Partner Salaried Pension Plan immediately upon the employees Transfer Time.
The RMT Partner Salaried Pension Plan shall be a successor pension plan to
each of the Canadian Parent Salaried Pension Plans for the purposes of Section
80 of the Ontario _Pension Benefits Act_ , R.S.O. 1990, c. P.8. Prior to the
Distribution Date, RMT Partner shall provide Parent with evidence reasonably
satisfactory to Parent of the establishment of the RMT Partner Salaried
Pension Plan, and the benefits pursuant to such plan are generally described
in Schedule 11.3(m). To the extent that during the two-year period following
the Distribution Date, the RMT Partner Salaried Pension Plan as generally
described on Schedule 11.3(m) does not otherwise provide benefits of
substantially equal value to the benefits provided to any Non-Represented
Transferred Employee under the provisions of the applicable Canadian Parent
Salaried Pension Plan as such plan existed immediately prior to such
employees Transfer Time, RMT Partner shall provide such Non-Represented
Transferred Employee with other compensation, including either cash
compensation or other defined contribution plan benefits, as RMT Partner so
determines, that, when combined with such employees benefits under the RMT
Partner Salaried Pension Plan, in the aggregate, provide such employee, for
the two-year period following the Distribution Date, with benefits of
substantially equal value to the benefits provided to such Non-Represented
Transferred Employee under the provisions of the applicable Canadian Parent
Salaried Pension Plan as such plan existed immediately prior to such
employees Transfer Time; _provided_ , _however_ , that in no event shall RMT
Partner be required to provide benefits under a defined benefit plan with
respect to any such employee. For the avoidance of doubt, in no event shall
any provision of this Section 11.3(m)(iii) limit the obligations of RMT
Partner and its affiliates pursuant to Section 11.3(b) to provide each
Canadian Non-Represented Employee with compensation and benefits that, in the
aggregate, are no less favorable than those provided to such Canadian Non-
Represented Employee immediately prior to such employees Transfer Time.

  

(iv) If, during the two-year period following the Distribution Date,
there is a windup or partial windup of the RMT Partner Salaried Pension Plan
or the RMT Partner Hourly Pension Plan that results in a windup or partial
windup of a Canadian Parent Salaried Pension Plan or the Canadian Parent
Hourly Pension Plan with respect to any Transferred Employees, RMT shall
indemnify and hold harmless Parent and its affiliates from and against (A) all
Losses relating to additional benefits to which the Transferred Employees
become entitled under such Canadian Parent Salaried Pension Plan or Canadian
Parent Hourly Pension Plan in connection with such windup or partial windup
and (B) all Losses relating to administrative costs incurred by such Canadian
Parent Salaried Pension Plan or Canadian Parent Hourly Pension Plan with
respect to such windup or partial windup. In addition, RMT Partner or

  



  

\- 95 -

     

its affiliates shall reimburse Parent or its affiliates for an amount equal to
the value (determined as of the Distribution Date) of the surplus assets to
which the Transferred Employees become entitled by reason of such windup or
partial windup that occurs during the two-year period following the
Distribution Date, regardless of whether such surplus assets are provided to
such Transferred Employees in the form of cash or benefit enhancements.

  

(n) _Ongoing Obligations_. Commencing on the date of this Agreement and
continuing thereafter, Parent shall cooperate in good faith with RMT Partner
to effectuate the most expeditious procedures, subject to the limitations of
applicable law (including any applicable laws relating to the safeguarding of
data privacy), for transferring from Parent and its affiliates to RMT Partner
such data, knowledge and information relating to Business Employees (including
certain payroll processing data but excluding (i) any such data that could
result in a violation of applicable data privacy laws and (ii) performance
reviews and other files of a sensitive nature) that is reasonably appropriate
for the operation of employee benefit plans maintained by RMT Partner or its
affiliates in which Business Employees will participate following the Closing
and in a manner such that all personnel records of Business Employees, the
service of all Business Employees and all other information mutually
determined by RMT Partner and Parent to be needed by RMT Partner in connection
with the employment of Business Employees will be provided to RMT Partner on
the date of this Agreement and thereafter as appropriate. RMT Partner agrees
that the provision by Parent of the relevant information does not constitute a
breach of applicable laws, including in particular any privacy or access to
information legislation.

  

(o) _No Third-Party Beneficiaries_. The provisions of this Section 11.3 and
Section 5.10 are for the sole benefit of the parties to this Agreement and
nothing herein, expressed or implied, is intended or shall be construed to (i)
constitute an amendment to any of the compensation and benefits plans
maintained for or provided to Transferred Employees prior to or following the
Closing or (ii) confer upon or give to any person (including for the avoidance
of doubt any current or former employees, directors, or independent
contractors of Parent, Splitco or any of their affiliates), other than the
parties hereto and their respective permitted successors and assigns, any
legal or equitable or other rights or remedies (with respect to the matters
provided for in this Section 11.3 and Section 5.10) under or by reason of
any provision of this Agreement.

  

(p) _Other_. Except as specifically provided in Sections 11.3(d), 11.3(h),
11.3(i) and 11.3(m) and Schedule 11.3(b)(ii), nothing contained herein shall
be construed as requiring, and Parent and its affiliates shall take no action
that would have the effect of requiring, RMT Partner or its affiliates to
continue any specific employee benefit plans or to continue the employment of
any specific person.

   

11.4 _No Solicitation by RMT Partner_.

  

(a) RMT Partner shall not, nor shall it authorize or permit any of its
subsidiaries to, nor shall it authorize or permit any officer, employee,
agent, advisor, director or other representative (collectively, "
**Representatives** ") of RMT Partner or any of its subsidiaries to (and shall
instruct such Representative not to), directly or indirectly (i) solicit,
initiate or encourage the submission of any RMT Partner Takeover Proposal or
(ii) participate in any

  



  

\- 96 -

     

discussions or negotiations regarding, or furnish to any Person any
information with respect to, or take any other action to facilitate any
inquiries or the making of any proposal that constitutes, or may reasonably be
expected to lead to, any RMT Partner Takeover Proposal; _provided_ , _however_
, that prior to receipt of the RMT Partner Stock Issuance Approval , RMT
Partner may, if the failure to take such action would be inconsistent with the
fiduciary duties of the Board of Directors of RMT Partner to the stockholders
of RMT Partner under applicable law, as determined in good faith after
consulting with outside legal counsel, in response to a bona fide, written RMT
Partner Takeover Proposal (A) that is made by a Person the Board of Directors
of RMT Partner determines, in good faith, after consulting with outside
counsel and independent financial advisors, is reasonably capable of making an
RMT Partner Superior Proposal, (B) that the Board of Directors of RMT Partner
determines, in good faith, after consulting with its independent financial
advisor, constitutes or is reasonably likely to lead to an RMT Partner
Superior Proposal and (C) that was not solicited by RMT Partner and that did
not otherwise result from a breach of this Section 11.4, and subject to
compliance with Section 11.4(c), (x) furnish information with respect to RMT
Partner to the Person making such RMT Partner Takeover Proposal and its
Representatives pursuant to a confidentiality agreement not less restrictive
of the other party than the Confidentiality Agreement ( _provided_ that all
such information has previously been provided to Parent or is provided to
Parent prior to or substantially concurrent with the time it is provided to
such Person) and (y) participate in discussions and negotiations with such
Person and its Representatives regarding any RMT Partner Takeover Proposal.
Without limiting the foregoing, it is agreed that any violation of the
restrictions set forth in the preceding sentence by any Representative or
affiliate of RMT Partner or any of its subsidiaries, whether or not such
Person is purporting to act on behalf of RMT Partner or any of its
subsidiaries or otherwise, shall be deemed to be a breach of this Section 11.4
by RMT Partner. RMT Partner shall, and shall cause its Representatives to,
cease immediately any discussions and negotiations regarding any proposal that
constitutes, or may reasonably be expected to lead to, a RMT Partner Takeover
Proposal.

  

(b) Neither the Board of Directors of RMT Partner nor any committee thereof
shall (i) withdraw or modify in a manner adverse to Parent or Splitco, or
publicly propose to withdraw or modify in a manner adverse to Parent or
Splitco, the approval, recommendation or declaration of advisability by the
Board of Directors of RMT Partner of this Agreement, the Collateral Agreements
or any of the transactions contemplated hereby or thereby, including the RMT
Partner Stock Issuance Approval, (ii) approve, adopt or recommend, or permit
RMT Partner or any of its subsidiaries to enter into, any letter of intent,
agreement in principle, acquisition agreement, option agreement, joint venture
agreement, merger agreement or similar agreement relating to any RMT Partner
Takeover Proposal or (iii) approve, adopt or recommend, or publicly propose to
approve, adopt or recommend, any RMT Partner Takeover Proposal.
Notwithstanding the foregoing, if, prior to receipt of the RMT Partner Stock
Issuance Approval, the Board of Directors of RMT Partner receives an RMT
Partner Superior Proposal and as a result thereof the Board of Directors of
RMT Partner reasonably determines in good faith, after consulting with its
outside legal counsel, that the failure to take such action would be
inconsistent with its fiduciary duties to the stockholders of RMT Partner
under applicable law, then, on the fifth business day following Parents
receipt of written notice from RMT Partner, the Board of Directors of RMT
Partner may withdraw or modify its recommendation of the RMT Partner Stock
Issuance Approval and, in connection therewith, recommend such RMT Partner
Superior Proposal and may elect to terminate this Agreement to the extent
permitted by

  



  

\- 97 -

     

Section 14.1(d)(iii); _provided_ that, during such five-business day period,
RMT Partner shall be obligated to negotiate in good faith with Parent and
Splitco any modification to this Agreement proposed by Parent or Splitco.

  

(c) RMT Partner promptly shall advise Parent orally and in writing of any RMT
Partner Takeover Proposal or any inquiry with respect to or that could lead to
any RMT Partner Takeover Proposal, and the identity of the Person making any
such RMT Partner Takeover Proposal or inquiry and the material terms of any
such RMT Partner Takeover Proposal or inquiry. RMT Partner shall (i) keep
Parent reasonably informed of the status including any change to the material
terms of any such RMT Partner Takeover Proposal or inquiry and (ii) provide to
Parent as soon as reasonably practicable after receipt or delivery thereof
with copies of all correspondence and other written material sent or provided
to RMT Partner from any third party in connection with any RMT Partner
Takeover Proposal or sent or provided by RMT Partner to any third party in
connection with any RMT Partner Takeover Proposal.

  

(d) Nothing contained in this Section 11.4 shall prohibit RMT Partner from
taking and disclosing to its stockholders a position contemplated by Rules
14d-9 or 14e-2(a) promulgated under the Exchange Act or from making any
required disclosure to RMT Partners stockholders if, in the good-faith
judgment of the Board of Directors of RMT Partner, after consulting with
outside legal counsel, failure so to disclose would be inconsistent with its
obligations under applicable law; _provided_ , _however_ , that this Section
11.4(d) shall not eliminate or modify (x) RMT Partners obligations under the
last sentence of Section 11.4(b) or (y) the effect that taking and disclosing
any such position would otherwise have under this Agreement (including under
Section 14.1(c)(i)).

  

(e) For purposes of this Agreement:

  

" **RMT Partner Takeover Proposal** " shall mean (i) any proposal for a
merger, consolidation, dissolution, recapitalization or other business
combination involving RMT Partner, (ii) any proposal or offer for the issuance
by RMT Partner of over 15% of its equity securities as consideration for the
assets or securities of another Person or (iii) any proposal or offer to
acquire in any manner, directly or indirectly, over 15% of the equity
securities or consolidated assets of RMT Partner, or assets or business that
constitute over 15% of the consolidated revenues or net income of RMT Partner,
in each case other than the transactions contemplated hereby.

  

" **RMT Partner Superior Proposal** " shall mean any bona fide proposal made
by a third party to acquire 80% or more of the equity securities or all or
substantially all the assets of RMT Partner, pursuant to a tender or exchange
offer, a merger, a consolidation, a liquidation or dissolution, a
recapitalization, a sale of all or substantially all its assets or otherwise,
on terms which the Board of Directors of RMT Partner determines in its good-
faith judgment after consulting with its independent financial advisor (i) to
be superior from a financial point of view to the holders of RMT Partner
Common Stock than the transactions contemplated hereby, taking into account
all the terms and conditions of such proposal and this Agreement (including
any proposal by Parent to amend the terms of the transactions contemplated
hereby) and (ii) is reasonably capable of being

  



  

\- 98 -

     

completed, taking into account all financial, regulatory, legal and other
aspects of such proposal.

  

11.5 _Stock Exchange Listing_. RMT Partner shall use its reasonable best
efforts to cause the shares of RMT Partner Common Stock to be issued in the

(a) Each of the parties hereto shall cooperate with the other and use (and
shall cause their respective subsidiaries and affiliates to use) their
respective best efforts to promptly (i) take or cause to be taken all
necessary actions, and do or cause to be done all things, necessary, proper or
advisable under this Agreement and applicable laws to consummate and make

statements, registrations, submissions of information and applications and
(ii) obtain as soon as practicable all approvals, consents, registrations,

review in advance, and to the extent practicable, each shall consult the other
on any filing made with, or written materials submitted to, any third party
and/or any governmental authority in connection with the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement. Subject to any applicable laws relating to the
exchange of information and any conditions imposed by any governmental
authority, each of the parties legal counsel shall provide the other parties
legal counsel with the opportunity to participate in any meeting with any
governmental authority in respect of any filing, investigation or other
inquiry in connection with the transactions contemplated hereby. Parent and
Splitco agree and acknowledge that, notwithstanding anything to the contrary
in this Section 12.1 (but subject to the actions permitted under Section
10.1), in connection with any filing or submission required, action to be
taken or commitment to be made by RMT Partner or its affiliates to consummate
the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, Parent and Splitco shall not,
without RMT Partners prior written consent, sell, divest, or dispose of any

affiliates, officers or directors should be discovered by Parent or RMT
Partner which should be set forth in an amendment or supplement to any of the
Proxy Statement, the RMT Partner Form S-4, the Splitco Form S-1/S-4 or the
Schedule TO, so that any such document would not include any misstatement of a

notify the other parties hereto and an appropriate amendment or supplement

12.3 _Tax Treatment and IRS Ruling_.

respective best efforts to cause the Proposed Transactions to qualify for the
Intended Tax-Free Treatment, including not taking any action that such party
knows is reasonably likely to prevent the Intended Tax-Free Treatment.

  

(b) Parent and Splitco shall use their best efforts to seek, as promptly as
practicable, rulings from the IRS, in form and substance reasonably
satisfactory to Parent (the " **IRS Ruling** "), to the effect that the

\- 101 -

     

(c) The IRS Ruling and the Tax Opinions may be based upon customary factual
statements, representations and covenants by the parties, their subsidiaries
and their stockholders in connection with the IRS Ruling or as tax counsel
shall request in connection with the Tax Opinions (collectively, the " **Tax
Representations** "). Subject to, and consistent with, Section 12.10, Parent,
KFG, RMT Partner and Merger Sub agree to provide such appropriate information
and Tax Representations as the IRS shall request in connection with the IRS
Ruling.

  

(d) In the event that the IRS will not issue the rulings requested by Parent,
Parent and RMT Partner shall consider in good faith any reasonable
modifications to the structure of the transactions contemplated hereby that
will facilitate receipt of the rulings requested by Parent, so long as such
modifications will not materially adversely affect the value of the
transactions contemplated hereby to RMT Partner, Parent or their respective
stockholders; it being understood and agreed that reversing the direction of
the Splitco Merger (pursuant to Section 7.1) shall be deemed not to materially
adversely affect the value of the transactions. Parent shall have exclusive
control over the process of obtaining the IRS Ruling, including the
preparation and filing of the required information for the IRS Ruling and
supplements thereto to be submitted to the IRS in connection with the
IRS Ruling (the " **IRS Submission** "). In connection with and to the extent
the IRS Ruling can reasonably be expected to affect RMT Partners obligations
or liabilities under this Agreement, Parent shall (i) keep RMT Partner
informed of all material actions taken or proposed to be taken by Parent, (ii)
reasonably in advance of the submission of any IRS Submission provide RMT
Partner with a draft thereof ( _provided_ that Parent may redact from such
draft any information that Parent in its good-faith judgment considers to be
confidential and is not publicly available), consider RMT Partners comments
on such draft, and provide RMT Partner with a final copy, and (iii) provide
RMT Partner with notice reasonably in advance of, and permit RMT Partner to
attend, any formally scheduled meetings with the IRS (subject to the approval
by the IRS) that relate to such ruling.

failure of a condition set forth in Article 13 and (B) cannot be or has not
been cured within 60 days after the giving of written notice to RMT Partner of
such breach; or

  

(iv) if any of the conditions set forth in Section 13.1 or 13.1(h) shall
have become incapable of fulfillment, and shall not have been waived by
Parent; or

  

(d) by RMT Partner,

  

(i) if Parent or Splitco breaches or fails to perform any of its
representations and warranties or covenants and agreements contained in this
Agreement, which breach or failure to perform (A) would give rise to the
failure of a condition set forth in Article 13, and (B) cannot be or has not
been cured within 60 days after the giving of written notice to Parent of such
breach;

  

(ii) if any of the conditions set forth in Section 13.1 or 13.3 shall
have become incapable of fulfillment, and shall not have been waived by RMT
Partner; or

  

(iii) prior to receipt of the RMT Partner Stock Issuance Approval, if
the Board of Directors of RMT Partner authorizes RMT Partner, subject to
complying with the terms of this Agreement, to enter into a definitive
agreement with respect to a Superior Proposal and RMT Partner enters into such
definitive agreement at the time of termination pursuant to this

  



  

\- 109 -

     

Section 14.1(d)(iii); _provided_ that RMT Partner shall have paid the amounts
due pursuant to Sections 12.4(b) and 12.4(c) in accordance with their terms;

  

 _provided_ , _however_ , that the party seeking termination pursuant to
clause (b)(ii), (c)(iii), (c)(iv), (d)(i), (d)(ii) or (d)(iii)is not in
material breach of any of its representations, warranties, covenants or
agreements contained in this Agreement.

  

14.2 _Notice of Termination, Return of Documents, Continuing
Confidentiality Obligation_. In the event of termination by Parent or RMT
Partner pursuant to this Article 14, written notice thereof shall forthwith be
given to the other parties and the transactions contemplated by this Agreement
and the Collateral Agreements shall be terminated, without further action by
any party. If the transactions contemplated by this Agreement and the
Collateral Agreements are terminated as provided herein:

  

(a) (i) RMT Partner and Merger Sub shall to Parent return all documents and
copies and other material received from Parent and its subsidiaries and its
and their representatives relating to the transactions contemplated hereby and
by the Collateral Agreements, whether so obtained before or after the
execution hereof, and (ii) Parent and Splitco shall return to RMT Partner all
documents and copies and other material received from RMT Partner and its
subsidiaries and its and their Representatives relating to the transactions
contemplated hereby and by the Collateral Agreements, whether so obtained
before or after the execution hereof; and

  

(b) (i) all confidential information received by RMT Partner with respect to
the Business or Products or any other businesses or products of Parent shall
be treated in accordance with the confidentiality provisions of this Agreement
and the Confidentiality Agreement, which shall remain in full force and effect
notwithstanding the termination of this Agreement, and (ii) all confidential
information received by Parent with respect to the business or products of RMT
Partner shall be treated in accordance with the confidentiality provisions of
this Agreement and the Confidentiality Agreement, which shall remain in full
force and effect notwithstanding the termination of this Agreement.

  

14.3 _Effect of Termination_. If this Agreement is terminated and the
transactions contemplated hereby are abandoned as described in this Article
14, this Agreement shall become void and of no further force and effect,
except for the provisions of Sections 11.2 and 14.2(b) relating obligations to
keep certain information confidential, Section 12.4 relating to fees and
expenses, Section 12.9 relating to publicity, this Section 14.3 and Article 16
containing general provisions. Nothing in this Article 14 shall be deemed to
release any party from any liability for any breach by such party of the terms
and provisions of this Agreement or to impair the right of any party to compel
specific performance by another party of its obligations under this Agreement.
For the avoidance of doubt, receipt by Parent of a payment or reimbursement
pursuant to Section 12.4(b) or 12.4(c) shall not limit the ability of Parent
to sue for any breach of Section 11.4 or collect damages arising from any such
breach (except, in the case of calculation of damages, to the extent a court
would otherwise take such payment or reimbursement into account in assessing
damages for such breach).

 **ARTICLE 15**

  



  

 _ **INDEMNIFICATION; MUTUAL RELEASES**_

  

15.1 _Survival_. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement
or in any other agreements contemplated hereby or thereby (except as provided
in the Tax Allocation Agreement), no representations and warranties of the
parties hereto or thereto shall survive the Closing. No covenants and
agreements of the parties hereto (except as provided in the Tax Allocation
Agreement) shall survive the Closing, except that any covenants or agreements
contained herein or made pursuant hereto that by their terms are to be
performed after the Closing shall survive until fully discharged.

  

15.2 _Indemnification by Parent_. From and after the Closing Date, Parent
shall indemnify RMT Partner, Splitco and their affiliates and their respective
officers, directors, employees and agents and hold them harmless from and
against any loss, liability, claim, cost, damage or expense (including
reasonable legal fees and expenses) (collectively, " **Losses** ") suffered or
incurred by any such indemnified party to the extent arising from the Excluded
Liabilities. Indemnification for matters subject to the Tax Allocation
Agreement is governed by the terms, provisions and procedures of the Tax
Allocation Agreement and not by this Article 15.

  

15.3 _Indemnification by Splitco and RMT Partner_. From and after the
Closing Date, Splitco and RMT Partner shall indemnify Parent and its
affiliates and their respective officers, directors, employees and agents and
hold them harmless from and against any Loss suffered or incurred by any such
indemnified party to the extent arising from the Assumed Liabilities.

  

15.4 _Losses Net of Insurance; Tax Benefits_. The amount of any Losses for
which indemnification is provided under this Article 15 shall be net of (a)
any amounts actually recoverable by the indemnified party under its insurance
policies with respect to such Losses and (b) any net Tax Benefit to the
indemnified party or its affiliates arising from the incurrence or payment of
any such Losses. Each party hereby waives, to the extent permitted under its
applicable insurance policies, any subrogation rights that its insurer may
have with respect to any indemnified Losses.

   

15.5 _Procedures Relating to Indemnification_.

  

(a) In order for an indemnified party to be entitled to any indemnification
provided for under this Article 15 and Sections 5.1(i), 5.10(b) and 11.3 and
any agreements entered into pursuant to Section 10.3 and 12.8, such
indemnified party must notify the indemnifying party in writing, and in
reasonable detail, of such claim or demand as promptly as reasonably possible;
_provided_ , _however_ , that failure to give such notification shall not
affect the indemnification provided hereunder except to the extent the
indemnifying party shall have been actually prejudiced as a result of such
failure.

  

(b) If a claim or demand is made by any Person against the indemnified party,
including any written notice or request for information pursuant to
Environmental Law relating to the matters that are the subject of Schedule
4.5(g) (a " **Third Party Claim** "), the indemnified

  



  

\- 111 -

     

party shall deliver to the indemnifying party, within five business days (or
sooner, if the nature of the asserted liability so requires) after the
indemnified partys receipt thereof, copies of all notices and documents
(including court papers) received by the indemnified party relating to the
Third-Party Claim. If a Third Party Claim is made against an indemnified
party, the indemnifying party shall be entitled to participate in the defense
thereof and, if it so chooses and acknowledges its obligation to indemnify the
indemnified party therefor, to assume the defense thereof with counsel
selected by the indemnifying party and reasonably satisfactory to the
indemnified party. Should the indemnifying party so elect to assume the
defense of a Third-Party Claim, the indemnifying party shall not be liable to
the indemnified party for legal expenses subsequently incurred by the
indemnified party in connection with the defense thereof, unless the Third-
Party Claim involves potential conflicts of interest or substantially
different defenses for the indemnified party and the indemnifying party. If
the indemnifying party assumes such defense, the indemnified party shall have
the right to participate in the defense thereof and to employ counsel, at its
own expense (except to the extent provided in the immediately preceding
sentence), separate from the counsel employed by the indemnifying party, it
being understood that the indemnifying party shall control such defense. The
indemnifying party shall be liable for the fees and expenses of counsel
employed by the indemnified party for any period during which the indemnifying
party has not assumed the defense thereof. If the indemnifying party chooses
to defend any Third-Party Claim, all the parties hereto shall cooperate in the
defense or prosecution thereof. Such cooperation shall include the retention
and (upon the indemnifying partys request) the provision to the indemnifying
party of records and information that are reasonably relevant to such Third-
Party Claim, and making employees available on a mutually convenient basis to
provide additional information and explanation of any material provided
hereunder. Whether or not the indemnifying party shall have assumed the
defense of a Third-Party Claim, the indemnified party shall not admit any
liability with respect to, or settle, compromise or discharge, such Third-
Party Claim without the indemnifying partys prior written consent (which
consent shall not be unreasonably withheld).

  

15.6 _Exclusive Remedy_. Parent, Splitco, RMT Partner and Merger Sub each
acknowledge and agree that, from and after the Closing, their sole and
exclusive monetary remedy with respect to any and all claims relating to the
subject matter of this Agreement shall be pursuant to the indemnification
provisions set forth in this Article 15 and Sections 5.1(i), 5.10(b) and 11.3
and any agreements entered into pursuant to Section 10.3 or Section 12.8 and
in furtherance of the foregoing, Parent, Splitco and RMT Partner, hereby
waive, from and after the Closing, to the fullest extent permitted under
applicable law, any and all rights, claims and causes of action for damages
they may have against each other relating to the subject matter of this
Agreement arising under or based upon any federal, state or local statute,
law (including common law), ordinance, rule or regulation or otherwise;
_provided_ that nothing contained in this Section 15.6 and Sections 5.1(i),
5.10(b) and 11.3 and any agreements entered into pursuant to Section 10.3 or
Section 12.8 shall impair any right of any Person to enforce any covenants or
agreements contained in this Agreement that survive after the Closing Date, in
each case in accordance with its terms. It is understood and agreed that
nothing in this Agreement is intended to limit any claims as to fraud that any
party may have as a matter of law.

  



  

\- 112 -

      

15.7 _Release of Pre-Closing Claims_.

  

(a) Except as provided in Section 15.3 and Sections 5.1(i), 5.10(b), 11.3 and
12.5 and any agreements entered into pursuant to Section 10.3 or Section 12.8,
effective as of the date of the Distribution, Parent shall, for itself and
each of its affiliates, release and forever discharge Splitco and RMT Partner
and each of their respective affiliates from any and all liabilities
whatsoever owing to Parent and each of its affiliates, whether at law or in
equity (including any right of contribution), whether arising under any
Contract, by operation of law or otherwise, existing or arising from any acts
or events occurring or failing to occur or alleged to have occurred or to have
failed to occur or any conditions existing or alleged to have existed on or
before the date of the Distribution, whether or not known as of such date,
including in connection with the transactions contemplated hereby.

  

(b) Except as provided in Section 15.2, effective as of the date of the
Distribution, each of Splitco and RMT Partner shall, for itself and each of
its affiliates, release and forever discharge Parent and each of its
affiliates from any and all liabilities whatsoever owing to Splitco or RMT
Partner or any of their respective affiliates, whether at law or in equity
(including any right of Contribution), whether arising under any Contract, by
operation of law or otherwise, existing or arising from any acts or events
occurring or failing to occur or alleged to have occurred or to have failed to
occur or any conditions existing or alleged to have existed on or before the
date of the Distribution, whether or not known as of such date, including in
connection with the transactions contemplated hereby.

  

(c) Nothing contained in Section 15.6 or this Section 15.7 shall impair any
right of any Person to enforce this Agreement or any Collateral Agreement or
any agreements entered into pursuant to Section 10.3 or Section 12.8 or any
covenants or agreements contained herein that survive the Closing pursuant to
Section 15.1, in each case in accordance with its terms.

  

(d) Nothing contained in this Section 15.7 or Section 15.6 shall release any
Person from:

  

(i) any liability, contingent or otherwise, assumed, transferred,
assigned or allocated to a party, its subsidiaries or its affiliates in
accordance with, or any other liability of a party or its affiliates under
this Agreement or any Collateral Agreement;

  

(ii) any liability that the parties may have with respect to
indemnification pursuant to this Agreement for claims brought against the
parties by third parties, which liability shall be governed by the provisions
of this Article 15 and, if applicable, the appropriate provisions of the
Collateral Agreements; or

  

(iii) any liability the release of which would result in the release of
any Person other than a Person released pursuant to Section 15.7(a) or (b).

  

(e) At any time, at the request of any other party, each party shall cause
each of its respective affiliates to execute and deliver releases reflecting
the provisions of this Section 15.7.

  



  

\- 113 -

      

15.8 _Additional Matters_.

  

(a) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement,
indemnification for tax matters shall be governed by the terms, provisions and
procedures of the Tax Allocation Agreement and not by this Article 15.

  

(b) In no event shall an indemnifying party be liable for special, punitive,
exemplary, incidental, consequential or indirect damages, or lost profits,
whether based on contract, tort, strict liability, other law or otherwise.

  

 **ARTICLE 16**

Agreement, any failure of any of the parties to comply with any obligation,
covenant, agreement or condition herein may be waived by the party entitled to
the benefits thereof only by a written instrument signed by the party granting

16.8 _Severability_. If any provision of this Agreement or the application
of any such provision to any Person or circumstance shall be held invalid,
illegal or unenforceable in any respect by a court of competent jurisdiction,
such invalidity, illegality or unenforceability shall not affect any other
provision hereof.

  

16.9 _Governing Law_. This Agreement shall be governed by and construed in
accordance with the laws of the State of Delaware applicable to agreements

jurisdiction by motion or other request for leave from any such court and (c)
agrees that it will not bring any action relating to this Agreement or any of
the transactions contemplated by this Agreement in any court other than a

Each of the parties hereto irrevocably consents to the service of any summons
and complaint and any other process in any other action relating to the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement, on behalf of itself or its
property, by the personal delivery of copies of such process to such party.
Nothing in this Section 16.10 shall affect the right of any party hereto to
serve legal process in any other manner permitted by law.

shareholders (taking into consideration relevant matters, including lost
shareholder premium, other combination opportunities and the time value of
money), which shall be deemed in such event to be damages of such party.

16.12 _Exhibits and Schedules_. All Exhibits and Schedules annexed hereto or
referred to herein are hereby incorporated in and made a part of this
Agreement as if set forth in full herein. Inclusion of any matter in any

16.13 _Entire Agreement; Priority of Tax Allocation Agreement_.

  

(a) This Agreement, the Collateral Agreements and the Confidentiality
Agreement contain the entire agreement and understanding between the parties
hereto and thereto with respect to the subject matter hereof and thereof and,
except to the extent specifically set forth herein, supersede all prior
agreements and understandings relating to such subject matter.

terms of the Tax Allocation Agreement and any provision of this Agreement, or
any provision of any other Collateral Agreement or other agreement
contemplated hereby, shall be resolved in favor of the Tax Allocation
Agreement.
