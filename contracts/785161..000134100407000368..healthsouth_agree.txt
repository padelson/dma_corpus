PURCHASE AGREEMENT  ------------------------   STOCK PURCHASE AGREEMENT,
dated as of January 27, 2007 (the "Agreement"), by and between HealthSouth
Corporation, a Delaware corporation ("Seller"), and Select Medical
Corporation, a Delaware corporation ("Buyer").   RECITALS  --------  
WHEREAS, Seller is engaged, directly and through the Division Entities (as
hereinafter defined), in the business of operating and managing outpatient
rehabilitation facilities offering a range of rehabilitative health care
services, including physical therapy and occupation therapy, with
a particular focus on orthopedic, sports-related, hand and spine injuries
and various neurological/neuromuscular conditions (the "Business");  
WHEREAS, the Business is operated by Seller through the entities listed on
Schedule I attached hereto (collectively, the "Division Entities");  
WHEREAS, prior to Closing (as hereinafter defined), all of Seller\'s equity
interests in the Division Entities shall be held, directly or indirectly, by
HealthSouth Holdings, Inc., a Delaware corporation (the "Company" and,
collectively with the Division Entities, the "Division");   WHEREAS, Seller
is the record and beneficial owner of all of the issued and outstanding
shares of common stock, par value $0.01 per share (the "Shares"), of the
Company;   WHEREAS, Buyer desires to purchase and acquire from Seller,
and Seller desires to sell and transfer to Buyer, all of Seller\'s right,
title and interest in and to the Division by way of a purchase by Buyer and
sale by Seller of the Shares, upon the terms and subject to the conditions
hereinafter set forth; and   WHEREAS, the respective Board of Directors of
each of Seller and Buyer has approved this Agreement and the transactions
contemplated hereby.   NOW, THEREFORE, in consideration of the foregoing and
of the representations, warranties, covenants, agreements and conditions
contained herein, and intending to be legally bound hereby, the parties
hereto agree as follows:    TERMS  -----   ARTICLE I  PURCHASE AND
SALE  -----------------   1.1 Purchase and Sale of the Shares. Upon the
terms and subject to the conditions of this Agreement, at the closing
provided for in Section 1.3 hereof (the "Closing"), Seller shall sell,
convey, assign, transfer and deliver to Buyer, and Buyer shall purchase,
acquire and accept from Seller, all of Seller\'s right, title and interest in
and to the Shares, free and clear of all liens, encumbrances, security
interests, mortgages, pledges, claims and options (collectively,
"Liens").       1.2 Consideration. Upon the terms and subject to the
conditions of this Agreement, in consideration of the aforesaid sale,
conveyance, assignment, transfer and delivery of the Shares at the Closing,
Buyer shall pay to Seller an amount in cash, equal to (i) Two Hundred Forty
Five Million Dollars ($245,000,000) (the "Unadjusted Purchase Price"), plus
(ii) an amount equal to the Estimated Closing Cash Balance (as hereinafter
defined), minus (iii) an amount equal to Capitalized Lease Indebtedness as of
the Effective Time, minus (iv) an amount equal to Earn-Out Indebtedness as of
the Effective Time, plus (v) the amount, if any, by which the Estimated Net
Working Capital exceeds the Target Net Working Capital, minus (vi) the
amount, if any, by which the Estimated Net Working Capital is less than the
Target Net Working Capital (such amount, the "Initial Purchase Price"). Any
increase or decrease to the Unadjusted Purchase Price pursuant to clauses (v)
or (vi) of this Section 1.2 shall be referred to herein as the "Estimated Net
Working Capital Adjustment."   1.3 Closing. Subject to Article X hereof,
the Closing of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement shall take
place at the offices of Bradley, Arant, Rose and White LLP, 1819 Fifth Avenue
North, Birmingham, Alabama 35203, at 10:00 a.m., local time, on the first
Business Day of the month immediately following the month in which the
condition set forth in Section 7.1(c) is satisfied, but no sooner than March
1, 2007; provided that all other conditions set forth in Article VII, Article
VIII and Article IX hereof are satisfied or capable of being satisfied at the
Closing, or at such other place, date and time as shall be agreed upon in
writing by the parties hereto (the date that the Closing actually occurs
shall be referred to herein as the "Closing Date"). Notwithstanding the
foregoing, the parties hereto intend that such Closing shall be deemed to be
effective, and the transactions contemplated by this Agreement shall be
deemed to occur simultaneously, at 11:59 p.m., Central Time, on the last day
of the month immediately prior to the Closing Date (the "Effective
Time").   1.4 Deliveries by Seller. Prior to or at the Closing, Seller
shall deliver or cause to be delivered to Buyer the following:    (a)
stock certificate(s) representing the Shares, duly endorsed or accompanied by
stock powers duly executed in blank;   (b) each of the Ancillary Agreements,
duly executed by Seller;   (c) the resignations referred to in Section 2.3
hereof; and   (d) the officer\'s certificate referred to in Section
9.1(c) hereof.   1.5 Deliveries by Buyer. Prior to or at the Closing, Buyer
shall deliver or cause to be delivered to Seller the following:    (a)
cash in an amount equal to the Initial Purchase Price by wire transfer of
immediately available funds to a bank account designated in writing by Seller
at least two (2) Business Days prior to the Closing Date;   (b) each of the
Ancillary Agreements, duly executed by Buyer; and   (c) the officer\'s
certificate referred to in Section 8.1(c) hereof.     2      1.6
Related Calculations.   (a) Cash Balance and Net Working Capital
Calculations.   (i) Seller shall, at least five (5) Business Days prior to 
the Closing Date, cause to be prepared and delivered to Buyer a  statement
(the "Good Faith Statement") setting forth a good faith  estimate of the
Closing Cash Balance (as hereinafter defined) of the  Division as of the
Effective Time (the "Estimated Closing Cash Balance")  and the Net Working
Capital (as hereinafter defined) of the Division as  of the Effective Time
(the "Estimated Net Working Capital") and the  respective components and
calculations of each thereof. Buyer and its  representatives shall have an
opportunity to review and comment upon the  Good Faith Statement, which shall
be subject to Buyer\'s reasonable  approval. As used herein, "Closing Cash
Balance" shall mean an amount  equal to (A) Cash less (B) Cash Due to
Minority Interest Holders as of  the Effective Time (it being understood that
Seller shall be responsible  for any checks that are outstanding as of the
Effective Time that relate  to the Company or the Division Entities). As used
herein, "Net Working  Capital" shall mean (i) the sum of (A) accounts
receivable, net of  reserves for doubtful accounts (but excluding any
intercompany accounts  receivable) and (B) other current assets, less (ii)
the sum of (A) trade  accounts payable (but excluding any intercompany
accounts payable and  unapplied cash), (B) refunds due to patients and third-
party payors,  principally as reflected in account 2512 (which as of
September 30, 2006  reflected an accrued liability of $1.5 million), (C)
accrued liabilities  (but excluding any intercompany accrued liabilities and
excluding the  current portion of long-term Indebtedness) and (D) other
current  liabilities, and shall be calculated in accordance with the
Accounting  Principles. The "Accounting Principles" shall mean GAAP utilizing
the  methodologies, accounting principles and practices used in the 
preparation of the Audited Financial Statements (as hereinafter  defined),
and as adjusted to derive the 2005 Pro Forma Financial  Information,
consistent with the reconciliation thereof set forth in  Section 3.7(d) of
the Disclosure Letter. Net Working Capital shall be  prepared in a manner
consistent with the example thereof set forth in  Schedule II hereto, which
Schedule II is derived from the September 30,  2006 pro forma balance sheet
of the Division attached as Schedule III  hereto.   (ii) Between eight-five
(85) and ninety (90) days after the  Closing Date, Seller shall cause to be
prepared and delivered to Buyer a  statement (the "Statement") setting forth
the Closing Cash Balance of  the Division as of the Effective Time (the
"Actual Closing Cash  Balance") and the Net Working Capital of the Division
as of the  Effective Time (the "Actual Net Working Capital") and the
components and  calculations of each thereof. The Statement shall also set
forth (i) the  difference, if any, determined by subtracting the Estimated
Closing Cash  Balance from the Actual Closing Cash Balance (any such
difference, the  "Cash Adjustment Amount"), it being understood that the Cash
Adjustment  Amount may be either a positive or negative number and (ii) the 
difference, if any, determined by subtracting the Estimated Net Working 
Capital from the Actual Net Working Capital (such difference, the "Net 
Working Capital Adjustment Amount"), it being understood that the Net 
Working Capital Adjustment Amount may be either a positive or negative 
number. Subject to Sections 1.6(a)(iii)-(v), (i) Buyer shall pay to  Seller
the amount of any positive Cash Adjustment Amount and any  positive Net   
3     Working Capital Amount and (ii) Seller shall pay to Buyer the amount
of  any negative Cash Adjustment Amount and any negative Net Working
Capital  Adjustment Amount, in each case, as finally determined pursuant to
this  Section 1.6(a). To the extent that netting the payments referenced in 
the preceding sentence results in a net payment by Buyer to Seller, the 
amount of such net payment shall be referred to herein as the "Excess 
Amount" and, to the extent that netting the payments referenced in the 
preceding sentence results in a net payment by Seller to Buyer, the  amount
of such net payment shall be referred to herein as the  "Deficiency Amount."
Contemporaneously with its delivery to Buyer of the  Statement, Seller shall
also deliver to Buyer a copy of the work papers  prepared in connection with
the Statement\'s preparation. The Statement  shall be prepared in accordance
with the Accounting Principles. Buyer  shall provide Seller and its
representatives reasonable access, during  normal business hours of Buyer, to
all personnel, books and records of  the Division as reasonably requested by
Seller to assist it in its  preparation of the Statement.   (iii) After
receipt of the Statement, Buyer shall have  forty-five (45) days to review
the Statement together with the work  papers used in its preparation. During
the course of the preparation of  the Statement and following the delivery of
the Statement, Seller shall  provide Buyer and its representatives reasonable
access, during normal  business hours of Seller, to all personnel, books and
records of Seller  as reasonably requested by Buyer to assist it in its
review of the  Statement and its preparation. The Statement shall become
final and  binding upon the parties on the forty-fifth day following
receipt  thereof by Buyer unless Buyer gives written notice of its
disagreement  (a "Notice of Disagreement") to Seller prior to such date. Any
Notice of  Disagreement shall (A) specify in reasonable detail the nature
and  amount of any disagreement so asserted, and (B) include Buyer\'s 
calculation of the Closing Cash Balance and/or Net Working Capital 
(whichever is being disputed) of the Division as of the Effective Time.  If
Buyer has given Seller a Notice of Disagreement prior to the  forty-fifth day
following receipt by Buyer of the Statement, then the  Statement shall become
final and binding upon the parties on the date  the parties hereto resolve in
writing any differences they have with  respect to any matter properly
included in the Notice of Disagreement,  in accordance with this Section
1.6(a). During the twenty (20) Business  Days immediately following the
receipt by Seller of a Notice of  Disagreement, the respective Chief
Financial Officers of Seller and  Buyer or their designees shall negotiate in
good faith to resolve any  disputed items timely included in a Notice of
Disagreement. During such  period, Buyer shall have full access to the
working papers of Seller  prepared in connection with Seller\'s preparation
of the Statement, and  Seller shall have full access to the working papers of
Buyer prepared in  connection with Buyer\'s preparation of the Notice of
Disagreement. Any  resolution of disputed items included in the Notice of
Disagreement that  is agreed upon in writing by Buyer and Seller shall be
final, binding  and conclusive as to Seller, Buyer and their respective
Affiliates. At  the end of such twenty (20) Business Day period, at the
request of  Seller or Buyer, any and all matters which remain in dispute, and
which  were properly included in the Notice of Disagreement, shall be
submitted  to a mutually acceptable, nationally recognized independent
accounting  firm or other professional service organization that provides
financial  dispute resolution services (the "Accounting Arbiter") selected
by  Seller and Buyer, with no material relationship to Seller or Buyer or 
any of their respective    4     Affiliates, for a binding resolution
of such disputed items. If Buyer  and Seller are not able to agree upon an
Accounting Arbiter, the  appointment of an Accounting Arbiter will be finally
selected by mutual  agreement of an independent accounting firm selected by
Seller and an  independent accounting firm selected by Buyer; provided that,
neither of  the independent accounting firms selected by Buyer or Seller
shall serve  as the Accounting Arbiter. The fees and expenses of the
Accounting  Arbiter shall be paid one-half by Seller and one-half by
Buyer.   (iv) The Accounting Arbiter shall determine and report in  writing
to Seller and Buyer as to its determination of all disputed  matters
submitted to the Accounting Arbiter and the effect of such  determinations on
the Statement within twenty (20) Business Days after  such submission, and
such determinations shall be final, binding and  conclusive as to Seller,
Buyer and their respective Affiliates. In  resolving any disputed item, the
Accounting Arbiter, acting in its  capacity as an expert and not as an
arbitrator: (A) shall limit its  review to matters specifically set forth in
such Notice of Disagreement  delivered pursuant to Section 1.6(a)(iii) as a
disputed item (other than  those items thereafter resolved by mutual written
agreement of Seller  and Buyer), (B) shall further limit its review to
whether the  calculation of any such disputed item is mathematically accurate
and  whether the calculation of the Closing Cash Balance and/or Net Working 
Capital was made in accordance with the Accounting Principles and the  terms
of this Agreement, and (C) shall not assign a value to any item  greater than
the greatest value for such item claimed by any party or  less than the
smallest value for such item claimed by any other party in  the Statement or
the Notice of Disagreement delivered pursuant to  Section 1.6(a)(iii). Each
of Seller and Buyer shall have the right,  within five (5) Business Days of
submission of any disputed item to the  Accounting Arbiter, to meet with
representatives of the Accounting  Arbiter and present its position as to the
resolution of such disputed  item. In addition, Seller and Buyer shall each
furnish to the Accounting  Arbiter such work papers and other documents and
information relating to  the disputed items, as the Accounting Arbiter may
reasonably request.   (v) At such time as the Statement becomes final,
binding and  conclusive upon Seller, Buyer and their respective Affiliates
in  accordance with this Section 1.6(a), the Statement shall become the 
"Conclusive Statement." If the Conclusive Statement contains a  Deficiency
Amount, then Seller shall pay to Buyer an amount in cash  equal to such
Deficiency Amount. If the Conclusive Statement contains an  Excess Amount,
then Buyer shall pay to Seller an amount in cash equal to  such Excess
Amount. Any payment to be made pursuant to this Section 1.6  shall be made on
the third Business Day following the date on which the  Statement becomes the
Conclusive Statement pursuant to this Section  1.6(a). Any payment to be made
pursuant to this Section 1.6(a) shall be  made on the third Business Day
following the date on which the Statement  becomes the Conclusive Statement
pursuant to this Section 1.6(a). Any  payment required to be made by Seller
or Buyer pursuant to this Section  1.6(a) shall bear interest from the
Closing Date through the date of  payment at the Interest Rate and shall be
payable by wire transfer of  immediately available funds to an account or
accounts designated by the  party entitled to receive such funds prior to the
date when such payment  is due.    5     (b) The Initial Purchase
Price, as increased by any Excess Amount or decreased by any Deficiency
Amount, as the case may be, shall be referred to herein as the "Purchase
Price."    ARTICLE II  RELATED MATTERS  ---------------   2.1 Ancillary
Agreement. Prior to or at the Closing, Seller and Buyer shall enter into the
Transition Services Agreement between Seller and Buyer, substantially in the
form set forth in Exhibit A attached hereto, pursuant to which Seller shall
provide, or cause to be provided, to the Division certain transition
services, as set forth therein, for the time periods set forth therein, in
accordance with the terms thereof (the "Transition Agreement").  2.2
Intercompany Agreements; Certain Other Intercompany Matters.   (a) Section
2.2(a)(i) of the disclosure letter delivered by Seller to Buyer
simultaneously herewith (the "Disclosure Letter") lists all intercompany
agreements between Seller or any of its Affiliates (other than the Company or
any Division Entity), on the one hand, and the Company or any Division
Entity, on the other hand (the "Intercompany Agreements"). Except as set
forth in Section 2.2(a)(ii) of the Disclosure Letter and except for
those Intercompany Agreements to be assigned by Seller to the Company
pursuant to Section 2.4(a) hereof, as of the Closing, Seller, the Company and
the Division Entities shall cause all Intercompany Agreements to be
terminated in all respects (pursuant to documentation reasonably acceptable
to Buyer) such that there is no cost or liability (including any Tax
liability) thereunder from and after the Closing on the part of the Company
or any Division Entity.   (b) As of the Closing, all intercompany accounts
receivable and accounts payable between the Company or any Division Entity,
on the one hand, and Seller or any of its Affiliates (other than the Company
or any Division Entity), on the other hand, shall be cancelled and terminated
in all respects (pursuant to documentation reasonably acceptable to Buyer)
such that there is no cost or liability (including any Tax liability)
thereunder from and after the Closing on the part of the Company or any
Division Entity.   (c) Except as provided in the Transition Agreement, at or
prior to the Closing, all information technology, accounting, insurance,
banking, human resources, legal, tax, communications and other products or
services (i) provided to the Company or any Division Entity (A) by Seller or
any of its Affiliates (other than the Company or any Division Entity) or (B)
pursuant to agreements, licenses or arrangements between Seller or its
Affiliates (other than the Company or a Division Entity), on the one hand,
and third parties, on the other hand, under which goods or services are
provided to the Company or any Division Entity, or (ii) provided by either
the Company or any Division Entity to Seller or any of its Affiliates (other
than the Company or any Division Entity), including any agreements or
understandings (written or oral) with respect thereto, will terminate. Except
as otherwise specifically provided in the Transition Agreement, on and after
the Closing Date, Buyer shall be solely responsible for the operation of the
Division. Section 2.2(c) of the Disclosure Letter sets forth all (x)
Contracts between Seller or its Affiliates (other than the Company or a
Division Entity), on the one hand, and third parties, on the other hand,
pursuant to which the Company or any Division Entity is entitled to
receive    6    payments or other benefits, which will not be
transferred to the Company or a Division Entity and, following the Effective
Time, the Company or such Division Entity will no longer be entitled to such
payments or benefits provided thereunder and (y) other assets, properties and
rights of the Division that will be retained by Seller and will not be
available for use by the Division following the Effective Time.   2.3
Resignations. At the Closing, Seller shall cause to be delivered to Buyer and
the Company duly signed resignations from the members of the board of
directors, board of managers or similar governing bodies, effective as of the
Closing, of each Division Entity, unless otherwise requested by Buyer, and
shall take such other action as is necessary to accomplish the foregoing.  
2.4 Restructuring Transactions.   (a) Prior to the Closing, Seller shall,
and shall cause its Subsidiaries to, consummate the transactions listed in
Section 2.4(a) of the Disclosure Letter in order to transfer and convey to
the Company or the Division Entities all of Seller\'s right, title and
interest in and to (i) the equity interests in the Division Entities held by
Seller or any of its Subsidiaries (other than the Company or a Division
Entity) and (ii) such other properties, assets and Contracts primarily used
in the conduct of the Business as are set forth on Section 2.4(a) of the
Disclosure Letter. Section 2.4(a) of the Disclosure Letter shall also set
forth a list of each of the current operating outpatient rehabilitation
clinics that will be owned by the Company or the Division Entities
immediately after the Closing (the "Going Clinics"), and shall include a
listing of the legal entity that owns each such Going Clinic.   (b) Prior
to the Closing, Seller shall, and shall cause its Subsidiaries to, consummate
the transactions listed in Section 2.4(b) of the Disclosure Letter in order
to transfer or convey to Seller or a Subsidiary of Seller (other than the
Company or a Division Entity) all of their right, title and interest in and
to (i) the equity interests in all Subsidiaries of or other entities owned by
the Company and the Division Entities that are not engaged in the conduct of
the Business and (ii) such other properties, assets and Contracts that are
not primarily used in the conduct of Business and which are set forth in
Section 2.4(b) of the Disclosure Letter (collectively, the "Excluded
Assets"). Section 2.4(b) of the Disclosure Letter shall also set forth a list
of each of the outpatient rehabilitation clinics owned or controlled by
Seller or its Subsidiaries at any time since September 30, 2005 that will not
be owned by the Company or the Division immediately after the Closing. Such
outpatient rehabilitation clinics and any other clinic presently or formerly
owned or operated by Seller or its Subsidiaries (other than the Going
Clinics) shall be referred to as the "Staying Clinics." Buyer and
Seller agree that any liabilities or obligations of the Company or any
Division Entity that relate to the Excluded Assets or the Staying Clinics
will also be transferred to or assumed by Seller or a Subsidiary of Seller
(other than the Company or its Subsidiaries) prior to the Effective Time, and
that the Company and the Division Entities shall be released from any
obligation relating to such liabilities as of the Effective Time and
indemnified by Seller from and against such liabilities. The transactions
listed in Sections 2.4(a) and 2.4(b) of the Disclosure Letter shall be
collectively referred to herein as the "Restructuring Transactions," and the
agreements to effectuate the Restructuring Transactions shall be referred to
herein as the "Restructuring Agreements." Together, the Transition Agreement
and the Restructuring Agreements are referred to herein as the
"Ancillary    7     Agreements." Seller will consult with and take
into account Buyer\'s reasonable suggestions regarding the manner to
effectuate the Restructuring Transactions; provided, however, that Seller
shall be free to structure the Restructuring Transactions in such manner as
it determines, in its sole discretion, as to maximize tax efficiencies to
Seller without Buyer\'s prior consent so long as such structure does not
adversely affect the parties\' ability to effect either the Election or the
DRE Sales (each as hereinafter defined); provided, further, that if Buyer
shall propose changes to the Restructuring Transactions, then (i) Seller
shall effect the Restructuring Transactions in accordance with Buyer\'s
proposal to the extent commercially practicable and (ii) Buyer shall
reimburse and indemnify Seller from and against any and all incremental
Taxes, on a grossed up basis, and out-of-pocket expenses incurred by Seller
in effectuating the Restructuring Transactions in accordance with Buyer\'s
proposal to the extent such Taxes and out-of-pocket expenses exceed the
amount thereof that would have been incurred by Seller had Seller effectuated
the Restructuring Transactions in the manner proposed by Seller (the "Excess
Restructuring Costs").   (c) To the extent any property, asset or Contract
that is required to be transferred or conveyed pursuant to the
Restructuring Transactions or the transactions contemplated by this Agreement
is not assignable or transferable without the consent of any Person other
than Seller, Buyer or any of their respective Affiliates, and such consent
shall not have been given prior to the Closing, Seller shall have the
continuing obligation after the Closing to use its commercially reasonable
efforts to endeavor to obtain any such consent. After the Closing, Seller and
Buyer shall cooperate with each other in any reasonable arrangement that is
designed to (i) relieve Seller of the obligations of any such property,
assets and Contracts that are required to be transferred or conveyed to the
Company or the Division Entities pursuant to the Restructuring Transactions
or the transactions contemplated by this Agreement and provide Buyer the
benefits thereunder and (ii) relieve Buyer of the obligations of any such
property, assets and Contracts that are required to be transferred or
conveyed to Seller or a Subsidiary of Seller (other than the Company or the
Division Entities) pursuant to the Restructuring Transactions or the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement and provide Seller the benefits
thereunder. Without limiting the generality of the preceding sentence, with
respect to Required Consent Leases that are not Consented Leases as of the
Closing, Seller shall be entitled, in its reasonable discretion, to (i) enter
into one or more management agreements with the Company, in form and
substance reasonably acceptable to Buyer, with respect to the Facilities
covered by each such Required Consent Lease whereby Seller will maintain the
Required Consent Lease and operate such Facility for the benefit of Buyer, or
(ii) cooperate with Buyer in relocating the Facility to a location, and on
lease terms, reasonably acceptable to Buyer (each, a "Replacement Lease"),
with Seller reimbursing and indemnifying Buyer from and against all
reasonable out-of-pocket expenses incurred by Buyer in connection with such
relocation, including, without limitation, reasonable (x) moving expenses,
(y) tenant improvements and (z) any incremental rent expense required under
such Replacement Lease above the amount that would have been required to be
paid by Buyer under the terms of the Required Consent Lease; provided,
however, that Seller\'s obligation to reimburse and indemnify under clause
(z) above shall be limited to amounts incurred with respect to the period
commencing on the Closing Date and ending on the earliest date that the
Required Consent Lease could be terminated by the lessor (or, if earlier, the
date such Required Consent Lease would have expired) in accordance with its
terms had the relocation not occurred.    8     2.5 Guaranties. Buyer
shall use its commercially reasonable efforts to cause itself or one of its
Affiliates to be substituted in all respects for Seller, effective as of the
Closing, in respect of all obligations of Seller under each of the guaranties
of leases of real property which are set forth in Section 2.5 of the
Disclosure Letter for the benefit of the Division or any of the Division
Entities or any extensions or modifications thereto in accordance with this
Agreement (collectively, the "Guaranties"), and to use its commercially
reasonable efforts to cause each other party to such Guaranty to release
Seller and its Affiliates (other than the Company and any Division Entity)
from any and all obligations and liabilities under such Guaranty. To the
extent that it is commercially impracticable with respect to any
given Guaranty for Buyer to effect such substitution and release, Buyer
shall indemnify and hold harmless the Seller Indemnified Parties (as
hereinafter defined) from and against all Damages (as hereinafter defined)
asserted against, resulting to, imposed upon or incurred by the Seller
Indemnified Parties by reason of or arising from any liability or obligation
resulting from any such Guaranty in accordance with Section 11.4(e) hereof.
Buyer shall take all actions that are necessary to comply with this Section
2.5 as promptly as practicable after the date hereof and shall keep Seller
reasonably informed of any developments associated therewith. Seller agrees
to reasonably cooperate with Buyer in connection with the fulfillment of
Buyer\'s obligations under this Section 2.5.   2.6 Payment of Division
Indebtedness. At or prior to the Closing, Seller shall repay or assume, or
cause to be repaid or assumed, on behalf of the Company and the Division
Entities, all outstanding Indebtedness (together with accrued interest
thereon) of the Company and the Division Entities as of the Closing Date
(other than Capitalized Lease Indebtedness and Earn-Out Indebtedness), and
shall take all actions as may be required to release the Company and the
Division Entities from any and all obligations and liabilities under such
Indebtedness (other than Capitalized Lease Indebtedness and Earn-Out
Indebtedness) and any Lien or guaranty in respect of any such Indebtedness
(other than Capitalized Lease Indebtedness and Earn-Out Indebtedness) or any
Indebtedness of Seller or its Subsidiaries (other than Capitalized Lease
Indebtedness and Earn-Out Indebtedness) pursuant to releases in form and
substance reasonably acceptable to Buyer.    ARTICLE III  REPRESENTATIONS

hereof) (with specific reference to the particular Section or subsection of
this Agreement to which the information set forth in such Disclosure Letter
relates; provided, that any information set forth in one section of the
Disclosure Letter shall be deemed to apply to each other Section or
subsection thereof or hereof to which its relevance is readily apparent on
its face), Seller represents and warrants to Buyer as follows:   3.1
Organization of Seller; Authority. Seller is a corporation duly organized,
validly existing and in good standing under the laws of the State of
Delaware, and has all requisite corporate power and corporate authority
to enter into this Agreement and the Ancillary Agreements, to perform
its obligations hereunder and thereunder and to consummate the
transactions contemplated hereby and thereby. The execution, delivery and
performance by Seller and its Affiliates of this Agreement and each of the
Ancillary Agreements to which it is a party, and the consummation of the
transactions contemplated hereby and thereby, have been    9    duly
authorized by all necessary corporate action on the part of Seller, and no
other acts or proceedings on the part of Seller, including
stockholder approval, are necessary for Seller to authorize this Agreement or
the Ancillary Agreements or the transactions contemplated hereby or thereby.
This Agreement has been (and each such Ancillary Agreement, upon execution
and delivery, will be) duly executed and delivered by Seller and each of
its Affiliates a party thereto and constitutes (and each such Ancillary
Agreement, upon execution and delivery, will constitute) a valid and binding
obligation of Seller and each of its Affiliates a party thereto, enforceable
against Seller and each of its Affiliates a party thereto in accordance with
its and their respective terms, except that (i) such enforcement may be
subject to bankruptcy, insolvency, reorganization, moratorium, fraudulent
transfer or other Laws, now or hereafter in effect, relating to or limiting
creditors\' rights generally and (ii) the remedy of specific performance and
injunctive and other forms of equitable relief may be subject to equitable
defenses and to the discretion of the court before which any proceeding
therefor may be brought.   3.2 Title to Shares. Seller has good and valid
title to the Shares, free and clear of all Liens, and upon delivery to Buyer
at the Closing of a certificate or certificates representing the Shares, duly
endorsed by Seller for transfer to Buyer or accompanied by stock powers duly
executed in blank, and upon receipt by Seller of the Initial Purchase Price
at the Closing, good and valid title to the Shares will pass to Buyer, free
and clear of any Liens. Other than this Agreement, the Shares are not subject
to any voting trust agreement or other Contract, including any such Contract
restricting or otherwise relating to the voting, dividend rights or
disposition of the Shares. Except as set forth in Section 3.2 of the
Disclosure Letter, Seller, directly or indirectly through one of its
Subsidiaries, has good and valid title to all of the outstanding shares of
capital stock or other equity interests of the Division Entities, directly or
indirectly (the "Subsidiary Shares"), free and clear of all Liens.   3.3
Organization and Qualification. The Company and each of the Division Entities
is duly organized or formed, validly existing and in good standing under the
laws of the jurisdiction of its incorporation or formation and has all
requisite corporate or other power and authority to own, lease and operate
its properties and to conduct its business as conducted on the date hereof,
except where the failure to be in good standing would not, individually or in
the aggregate, reasonably be expected to result in a Material Adverse Effect
(as hereinafter defined). Except as set forth in Section 3.3 of the
Disclosure Letter, the Company and each of the Division Entities is duly
qualified or licensed to do business as a foreign corporation, partnership or
limited liability company and is in good standing in each jurisdiction in
which the property owned, leased or operated by it or the nature of the
business conducted by it makes such qualification necessary, except in those
jurisdictions where the failure to be so duly qualified or licensed and in
good standing would not, individually or in the aggregate, reasonably be
expected to result in a Material Adverse Effect.   3.4 Capitalization of the
Company. The authorized capital stock of the Company consists of 1,000 shares
of common stock, par value $0.01 per share, of which 1,000 shares,
constituting the Shares, are validly issued and outstanding. The Shares were
duly authorized and are fully paid and nonassessable. The Shares are owned of
record and beneficially by Seller. Such Shares have not been issued in

rights. Except for the Shares, there are no shares of capital stock or other
equity securities of the Company outstanding. There are no outstanding   
10    warrants, options, "phantom" stock rights, agreements, convertible
or exchangeable securities or other commitments pursuant to which Seller or
the Company is or may become obligated to issue, sell, purchase, return or
redeem any shares of capital stock or other securities of the Company, or
which give any Person the right to receive any benefits or rights similar to
any rights enjoyed by or accruing to the holders of shares of capital stock
of the Company. There are no outstanding bonds, debentures, notes or
other Indebtedness having the right to vote on any matters upon which

equity interest in any other Person. The Subsidiary Shares for each Division
Entity that is a corporation were duly authorized and are validly issued,

that is not a corporation were duly authorized, and are validly issued.

and outstanding shares of capital stock or other equity interests of each
Division Entity will, as of the Closing, be owned of record and beneficially
by the Company or another Division Entity. The Subsidiary Shares as of the
Closing will be owned of record and beneficially by the Company, either
directly or indirectly through a Division Entity.   (b) The Subsidiary
Shares of each Division Entity have not been issued in violation of, and are
not subject to, any preemptive, subscription or similar rights (except as
otherwise required by applicable Law). Except as set forth in Section 3.5(b)
of the Disclosure Letter, there are no outstanding warrants, puts, calls,
options, "phantom" stock rights, agreements, convertible or exchangeable
securities or other commitments pursuant to which Seller, the Company or any
of the Division Entities is or may become obligated to issue, sell, purchase,

securities of the Division Entities or which give any Person the right to
receive any benefits or rights similar to any rights enjoyed by or accruing

right to vote on any matters on which stockholders of any of the Division
Entities may vote.  3.6 No Violation; Consents and Approvals.   (a) The
execution and delivery by Seller and each of its Affiliates that are a party
thereto of this Agreement and the Ancillary Agreements do not, and the
performance by Seller and its Affiliates of their obligations hereunder and

having jurisdiction over the Division or the Facilities, including such Laws
relating to health care fraud and abuse; or (iii) subject to the receipt of
the Consents and making of the Filings listed in Section 3.6(b) of the

material violation of or a material breach or default under), or result in or
give rise to a right of termination, cancellation or acceleration, or result
in the creation, of any Lien upon, any of the material properties or assets
of the Company or any of the Division Entities under any Material Contract
(as hereinafter defined) or Permit (as hereinafter defined) to which Seller,
the Company or any of the Division Entities is a party or by or to which
Seller, the Company or any of the Division Entities or any of their
respective properties or assets is bound or subject, except, in the case of
(ii) and (iii) above, for any such conflict, violation, breach, default,

requests which could not reasonably be expected to have, individually or in
the aggregate, a Material Adverse Effect. All payments required in connection

Division Entity has received any notice from any third-party payor,
including, but not limited to, Federal Health Care Programs, that indicates

Closing; Confidentiality; Cooperation.    27     (a) During the period
from the date of this Agreement through the Closing Date, Seller shall, and
shall cause the Company and the Division Entities to, give Buyer and its
authorized employees, accountants, counsel and other representatives (such
entities and representatives other than Buyer being referred to as "Buyer
Representatives") reasonable access during regular business hours to all
offices, personnel, facilities, books and records of Seller, the Company or
the Division Entities as they may reasonably request, and shall furnish or
cause to be furnished to Buyer such financial and operating data and other
information with respect to the business and properties of the Division as
Buyer may from time to time reasonably request and as may be necessary to
enable Buyer to have its own financial, payroll and accounting systems in
place as of the Closing Date so as to not need to rely on Seller to provide
such services after the Closing, and Seller agrees to reasonably cooperate
with Buyer in connection with such transition matters; provided, however,
that (i) Buyer and Buyer Representatives shall take such action as is deemed
necessary in the reasonable judgment of Seller to schedule such access and
visits through only those specifically identified representatives of Seller
and in such a way as to avoid unreasonably disrupting the normal business of
the Company and the Division Entities; (ii) the Company and the Division
Entities shall not be required to take any action which would constitute a
waiver of the attorney-client or other privilege; (iii) the Company and the
Division Entities need not supply Buyer with any information which, in the
reasonable judgment of Seller, the Company or any of the Division Entities is
under a legal obligation not to supply; and (iv) Seller, the Company and the
Division Entities shall not be required to supply Buyer with any information
that does not relate to the Division. No information received pursuant to
this Section 5.2 shall affect or be deemed to modify or update any of the
representations and warranties of Seller contained in this Agreement.   (b)
Buyer shall hold, and shall cause Buyer Representatives to hold, any
information which it or they receive in connection with the activities and
transactions contemplated by this Agreement and the Ancillary Agreements in
strict confidence in accordance with and subject to the terms of the
confidentiality agreement between Buyer and Seller (the
"Confidentiality Agreement"), which shall survive the execution and delivery
of this Agreement, and any termination of this Agreement pursuant to Article
X hereof, but shall be terminated and of no further force and effect as of
the Closing.   5.3 Commercially Reasonable Efforts. Subject to the terms
and conditions of this Agreement, each of the parties hereto shall use
all commercially reasonable efforts to take, or cause to be taken, all
actions, and to do, or cause to be done, all things necessary, proper or
advisable under applicable Laws and regulations to consummate the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement and the Ancillary Agreements at
the earliest practicable date.   5.4 Consents. Without limiting the
generality of Section 5.3 hereof, each of the parties hereto shall use
commercially reasonable efforts to obtain all Consents of, and make all
Filings with, all Governmental Entities and third parties required in
connection with the consummation of the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement prior to the Closing. Without limiting the generality of the
preceding sentence, Buyer specifically agrees to reasonably cooperate with
Seller in obtaining Consents for Required Third Party Payor Contracts. Within
ten (10) Business Days following the date hereof, each of the parties hereto
shall make or cause to be made all Filings under Laws applicable to it as may
be required for the consummation of the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement and the Ancillary Agreements. In addition to    28    the
foregoing, Buyer agrees to provide such assurances as to
financial capability, resources and creditworthiness as may be reasonably
requested by any Governmental Entity or third party whose Consent is sought
or to whom a Filing is made hereunder. Buyer and Seller shall coordinate and
cooperate with each other in exchanging such information and assistance as
any of the parties hereto may reasonably request in connection with the
foregoing.   5.5 Antitrust Notification. Subject to Section 10.2(b) hereof,
Buyer and Seller shall use their respective reasonable best efforts to obtain
all authorizations or waivers required under the HSR Act to consummate
the transactions contemplated hereby and by the Ancillary Agreements,
including (a) making all Filings with the Antitrust Division of the
Department of Justice ("DOJ") or the Federal Trade Commission ("FTC")
required in connection therewith (the initial filing to occur no later than
ten (10) Business Days following the execution and delivery of this
Agreement), (b) responding as promptly as practicable to all inquiries
received from the DOJ or the FTC for additional information or documentation,
and (c) resolving any objections that may be asserted by any Governmental
Entity with respect to the transactions contemplated by this Agreement in
connection with any Filings made in accordance with this Section 5.5. Each of
Buyer and Seller shall furnish to the other such necessary information and
reasonable assistance as the other may request in connection with its
preparation of any filing or submission which is necessary under the HSR Act.
Seller and Buyer shall keep each other apprised of the status of any
communications with, and any inquiries or requests for additional information
from, the DOJ or the FTC. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this
Agreement, Buyer and Seller will use their respective reasonable best efforts
to offer to take, or cause to be taken, all other actions and do, or cause to
be done, all other things necessary, proper or advisable to consummate and
make effective the transactions contemplated by this Agreement and the
Ancillary Agreements, including taking all such further action as reasonably
may be necessary to resolve such objections, if any, as the DOJ or the FTC or
state antitrust enforcement authorities or any other Person may assert under
the HSR Act with respect to the transactions contemplated hereby, and to
avoid or eliminate each and every impediment under any Law that may be
asserted by any Governmental Entity with respect to the transactions
contemplated hereby so as to enable the Closing to occur as soon as
expeditiously possible, including, without limitation, (i)
proposing, negotiating, committing to and effecting, by consent decree, hold
separate order or otherwise, the sale, divestiture or disposition of such
assets or businesses of the Division or of Buyer or any of its Subsidiaries,
and (ii) otherwise taking or committing to take actions that after the
Closing Date would limit the freedom of the Division or of Buyer or any of
its Subsidiaries with respect to, or its ability to retain, one or more of
their respective businesses or assets, in each case, as may be required in
order to avoid the entry of, or to effect the dissolution of, any injunction,
temporary restraining order or other order in any suit or proceeding which
would otherwise have the effect of preventing or materially delaying the
Closing, provided, however, that nothing in this Agreement shall require or
be construed to require any of Buyer or any of its Subsidiaries to take
any action, propose or make any divestiture or other undertaking, or propose
or enter into any consent decree, except for those that would not,
individually or in the aggregate, reasonably be expected to be materially
adverse to the outpatient segment of Buyer and its Subsidiaries taken as a
whole (assuming for this purpose, that the transactions contemplated hereby
have already been consummated).   5.6 Public Announcements. Seller and
Buyer shall not, and shall cause their respective Subsidiaries not to, issue
any public report, statement or press release or otherwise   
29    make any public statement with respect to this Agreement or the
Ancillary Agreements and the transactions contemplated hereby or thereby,
from the date hereof through the Closing Date, without prior consultation
with and approval of the other party (which approval shall not be
unreasonably withheld, delayed or conditioned), except as may be required by
Law or securities exchange regulations applicable to any such party, in which
case such party shall advise the other party and discuss the contents of the
disclosure before issuing any such report, statement or press release. In
addition, except as provided in this Section 5.6, Seller and Buyer shall not
make any general communication to suppliers, creditors, distributors,
employees, customers or others having business or financial relationships
with the Division pertaining to this Agreement or the Ancillary Agreements
and the transactions contemplated hereby or thereby, without the prior
written approval of the other party (which approval will not be unreasonably
withheld, delayed or conditioned). Immediately following the execution and
delivery of this Agreement, Seller and Buyer shall issue a press release to
be mutually agreed upon with respect to this Agreement and the transactions
contemplated hereby.   5.7 Supplemental Disclosure.   (a) Seller shall
from time to time prior to the Closing promptly supplement or amend the
Disclosure Letter with respect to (i) any matter that existed as of the date
of this Agreement and should have been set forth or described in the
Disclosure Letter and (ii) any matter hereafter arising which, if existing as
of the date of this Agreement, would have been required to be set forth or
described in the Disclosure Letter; provided, however, that, with respect to
clause (i) above, any such supplemental or amended disclosure shall not be
deemed to have been disclosed as of the date of this Agreement unless
expressly consented to in writing by Buyer; provided further, that, with
respect to clause (ii) above, any such supplement or amended disclosure
shall, for purposes of this Agreement and the Ancillary Agreements (other
than for the purposes of determining whether the conditions set forth in
Article IX hereof are satisfied), be deemed to have been disclosed as of the
date of this Agreement.   (b) Seller shall promptly notify Buyer of, and
furnish Buyer any information it may reasonably request with respect to, the
occurrence, to the Knowledge of Seller, of any event or condition or the
existence, to the Knowledge of Seller, of any fact that would cause any of
the conditions to Buyer\'s obligation to consummate the purchase and sale of
the Shares not to be fulfilled.   5.8 Certain Licenses and Permits. Seller
covenants that all Permits which are held in the name of Seller or any of its
Affiliates (other than the Company and the Division Entities) or any
employee, officer, director, stockholder or agent of Seller or any of its
Affiliates (including the Company and the Division Entities) or otherwise on
behalf of the Company or any of the Division Entities, that are used in the
Business shall be duly and validly transferred, to the extent legally
transferable, to the Company or one of the Division Entities without
consideration prior to the Closing and that the warranties, representations,
covenants and conditions contained in this Agreement shall apply to such
Permits as if held by the Company or such Division Entity as of the date
hereof.   5.9 Records; Cooperation.    30     (a) On the Closing Date
or at such other time as may be specified in Section 5.9(a) of the Disclosure
Letter, Seller shall deliver or cause to be delivered to Buyer, but only to
the extent permitted by applicable Law, all original agreements, documents,
books, records and files, including without limitation financial information,
asset management information, cash management information, licensing or
certification files, Medicare or Medicaid cost reports, audits, appeals and
related documentation, Real Property leases and other information listed in
Section 5.9(a) of the Disclosure Letter (collectively, "Records"), if any, in
the possession of Seller or any of its Affiliates, relating primarily to the
Division and the Division Entities to the extent not then in the possession
of the Company and the Division Entities (and in the case of Records
available in electronic form, such Records will also be delivered to Buyer in
electronic form in a manner reasonably acceptable to Buyer), subject to the
following exceptions:   (i) Buyer recognizes that certain Records may
contain  incidental information relating to the Company and the Division
Entities  or may relate primarily to Subsidiaries or divisions of Seller
other  than the Company and the Division Entities, and that Seller may
retain  such Records and shall provide copies of the relevant portions
thereof  to Buyer; and   (ii) Seller may retain all Records prepared in
connection  with the sale of the Shares, including all information and 
correspondence received from other parties and analyses relating to the 
Company and the Division Entities; provided, however, that any 
confidentiality agreements entered into by Seller with respect to the 
proposed sale of the Division shall be assigned to Buyer or the Company 
effective as of the Closing Date to the extent assignable.   (b) In order
that Seller may (i) properly respond to, conduct,  manage or otherwise
participate in any Litigation which may arise from,  or relate to, any of the
matters set forth on Section 5.9(b) of the  Disclosure Letter, or any
settlement, arrangement or agreement entered  into in connection therewith
(collectively, the "Retained Litigation")  and (ii) investigate, defend and
otherwise respond to or satisfy  Retained Liabilities, Buyer agrees to use
its commercially reasonable  efforts to reasonably cooperate, and to cause
its Affiliates, employees,  accountants, counsel and other representatives to
reasonably cooperate,  with Seller, its Affiliates, employees, accountants,
counsel and other  representatives in connection with the Retained Litigation
and Retained  Liabilities, and Seller agrees to reimburse Buyer for any
reasonable  out-of-pocket costs of any such cooperation. Following the
Closing,  neither Buyer, the Company, nor any Division Entity shall have
any  rights or liabilities in connection with the Retained Litigation or
the  Retained Liabilities and Seller shall have the right to settle the 
Retained Litigation on behalf and in the name of the Company and/or any  of
the Division Entities; provided, however, that Seller shall not,  without the
consent of Buyer (which consent shall not be unreasonably  withheld, delayed
or conditioned), enter into any settlement with  respect to any Retained
Litigation which settlement provides for any  injunctive or other equitable
relief with respect to the Business of the  Division or which requires the
Company or the Division to pay any amount  of money. Without limiting the
scope of the foregoing and except for  books and records relating to Taxes,
which are addressed by Section  6.1(b)(vi) hereof, following the Closing,
Buyer shall permit Seller and  its authorized representatives, during normal
business hours and upon  reasonable notice, to have reasonable access to, and
examine and make  copies of (at Seller\'s    31     expense), all
books, records and personnel of the Company and the  Division Entities which
relate to transactions or events occurring prior  to the Closing, including,
without limitation, the events or  circumstances giving rise to the Retained
Litigation and Retained  Liabilities ("Pre-Closing Transactions") or
transactions or events  occurring subsequent to the Closing which are related
to or arise out of  Pre-Closing Transactions, in each case, to the extent
such Pre-Closing  Transactions relate to obligations of Seller or as
necessary to comply  with applicable financial reporting obligations. Buyer
agrees that it  shall retain all such books and records for a period of seven
years  following the Closing Date, or for such longer period following the 
Closing Date as may be required by Law. Seller shall hold, and shall  cause
its Affiliates and representatives to hold, any information which  it or they
receive in connection with the access granted pursuant to  this Section
5.9(b) in strict confidence and will not disclose such  information to any
Person unless required by applicable law or with the  prior written consent
of Buyer (which will not unreasonably be  conditioned, withheld or
delayed).   (c) Seller and Buyer agree that it is the parties\' mutual
intent that all Division Offerees who are to become Transferred Employees
be transitioned over to Buyer\'s payroll system at the Closing, and each of
Seller and Buyer agree to use their respective commercially reasonable
efforts in order to reasonably cooperate, and to cause their respective
Affiliates, employees, accountants, counsel and other representatives to
reasonably cooperate, with the other party in accomplishing such transition.
In the event that, despite the exercise of the efforts set forth in the
preceding sentence, Buyer is not able to reflect such Division Offerees on
its payroll system as of Closing, then such Division Offerees shall continue
to be employees of Seller or its applicable Subsidiary until such time, not
later than ninety (90) days after the Closing Date, as Buyer is able to
reflect such Division Offerees on its payroll (the later of such date and the
Closing Date being hereinafter referred to as the "Transition Date"). From
the period beginning on the Closing Date and ending on the Transition Date,
(i) Seller agrees to continue to reflect such Division Offerees who are to
become Transferred Employees on Seller\'s payroll system and to lease or
second such employees to Buyer pursuant to the terms of an employee lease
agreement on terms to be mutually agreed upon by Buyer and Seller, and (ii)
Buyer agrees to reimburse Seller for all associated costs and expenses
incurred by Seller in its performance of this Section 5.9(c), including,
without limitation, all expenses relating to such Division Offerees\' base
salary or wage rate, as applicable, bonuses and employee benefits and all
reasonable costs and overhead of Seller in connection with providing the
payroll services provided hereunder.   (d) Seller and Buyer agree that the
Division and Buyer are not and will not be, by virtue of this Agreement or
the transactions contemplated hereunder, assuming any liabilities or
obligations under the Amended and Restated Class Settlement Procedure
Agreement and Consent Decree or any other obligations stemming from a
proposed class action styled Access Now, Inc., a Florida Corporation, Edward
Resnick, Emily Charmaine Evans and Kathy Dyer, individuals v. St. Petersburg
Surgery Center, Ltd., et al., Civil Action No. 8:01-CV-T-17EAJ filed in the
United States District Court for the Middle District of Florida.   5.10
Preparation of Financial Statements. In the event that Buyer reasonably
determines, based upon the advice of its independent accountants or a request
by the Securities and Exchange Commission ("SEC"), that it requires any
financial statements (audited or otherwise) with respect to the Division in
addition to the financial statements described in    32    Section 3.7
hereof in order to comply with the requirements of the SEC, Seller shall use
commercially reasonable efforts to afford Buyer and its auditors access to
(a) the books and records of Seller, the Company and the Division Entities
(to the extent related to the Division only) and (b) Seller\'s auditors and
personnel to the extent reasonably required by Buyer to prepare and/or audit
all such financial statements. The cost and expense of preparing such
additional financial statements (including the costs of Seller\'s auditors)
shall be borne solely by Buyer. Seller agrees to, and to use reasonable
efforts to cause its Affiliates, advisors, accountants, auditors, attorneys
and representatives to, reasonably cooperate with Buyer and its auditor in
the preparation of such additional financial statements, including by using
commercially reasonable efforts to provide customary auditor representation
letters, and Buyer agrees to reimburse Seller for any reasonable out-of-
pocket costs incurred in connection with such cooperation. For the avoidance
of doubt, any information obtained by Buyer or its auditors pursuant to this
Section 5.10 shall be subject, prior to the Closing Date, to the restrictions
set forth in Section 5.2(b) hereof. From and after the Closing Date, Buyer
shall, and shall use reasonable efforts to cause its Affiliates, advisors,
accountants, auditors, attorneys and representatives to, hold any material
non-public information concerning or relating to Seller or any of its
Subsidiaries (other than the Company and the Division Entities) in confidence
except for such disclosures as may be (i) consented to by Seller in writing
or (ii) required by Law.   5.11 Covenant Not to Compete.   (a) Seller
Covenant.   (i) In order to induce Buyer to enter into this Agreement, 
Seller hereby covenants and agrees that, except as otherwise provided 
herein, from and after the Closing and until the fifth (5th) anniversary  of
the Closing Date, it shall not, and shall cause its controlled  Affiliates
not to, directly or indirectly, participate in the  management, operation or
control of, or have any financial or ownership  interest in, or aid or
knowingly assist anyone else in the conduct of  (including providing
financing or leasing any assets to), any business  or entity that (a) engages
in the Business in any Restricted Territory,  or (b) is, to Seller\'s
Knowledge, making preparations for engaging in  such Business in any
Restricted Territory; provided, however, that  Seller may (y) acquire a
Person that engages in the Business, among  other activities of such Person,
in any Restricted Territory, provided  that such Person\'s EBITDA from the
conduct of the Business in such  Restricted Territory do not exceed 10% of
its total EBITDA for the  completed portion of its then current fiscal year
or the full fiscal  year immediately prior to such acquisition, and (z) enter
into, at arm\'s  length, any bona fide joint venture (or partnership or other
business  arrangement) with any Person who is not directly engaged in the
Business  but which is an Affiliate of another Person engaged in the
Business; and  provided, further, that nothing contained in this Section
5.11(a)(i)  shall prohibit or otherwise restrict Seller\'s current or
future  operation of (a) the facilities listed in Section 5.11(a)(i) of the 
Disclosure Letter which provide outpatient therapy in affiliation with  one
of Seller\'s inpatient rehabilitation facilities or (b) any of the  four
facilities listed in Section 5.11(a)(i) of the Disclosure Letter  which
provide outpatient therapy in affiliation with one of Seller\'s  long-term
acute care hospitals, or, with respect to both clauses (a) and  (b), a
relocation of such a facility. In addition, nothing contained in  this
Section 5.11(a)(i) will prohibit Seller from operating one (but not  more
than one) facility that    33     provides outpatient therapy in
affiliation with an inpatient  rehabilitation facility that is built,
developed or acquired by Seller  after the date hereof. In the event Seller
acquires a Person that  engages in the Business in compliance with clause
(b)(y), then in each  such case Seller shall, within twelve (12) months after
the date that  such acquisition is consummated, sell or otherwise divest
itself of the  portion of such acquired Person that engages in the Business
and  promptly provide written notice to Buyer of such intended
divestiture.   (ii) For a period of two (2) years from and after the date 
hereof, neither Seller nor any of its Subsidiaries shall, directly or 
indirectly, without the prior written consent of Buyer: (x) solicit or 
direct any other Person to solicit any officer or other employee (or any 
Person who was an officer or employee of the Company or any Division  Entity
within six (6) months of the date of any such solicitation, if  such
Person\'s employment was not terminated by the Company or such  Division
Entity) to: (A) terminate such officer\'s or employee\'s  employment with the
Company or any Division Entity; or (B) seek or  accept employment or other
affiliation with Seller or its Subsidiaries  (other than, in each case, any
solicitation directed at the public in  general in publications available to
the public in general or any  contact which Seller or its Subsidiaries can
demonstrate was initiated  by such officer, director or employee or any
contact six (6) months  after such officer\'s or employee\'s employment with
the Company or any  Division Entity is terminated) or (y) hire, employ or
retain as a  consultant or direct any other person to hire, employ or retain
as a  consultant, any such officer or other employee of the Company or any 
Division Entity (or any Person who was an officer or employee of the  Company
or any Division Entity within six (6) months of the date of any  such hiring,
if such Person\'s employment was not terminated by the  Company or any
Division Entity). Seller\'s obligations under this Section  5.11(a)(ii) with
respect to new Company and Division Entity employees  hired after the Closing
Date shall be subject to the condition that  Buyer shall have notified Seller
of the names of such new employees.   (iii) Seller hereby acknowledges and
agrees that if Seller  or any one or more of its Subsidiaries breaches any
provision of this  Section 5.11(a), any remedy at law would be inadequate and
that Buyer,  in addition to seeking monetary damages in connection with any
such  breach (other than a breach arising under Section 5.11(a)(ii)(y)),
shall  be entitled to specific performance, and injunctive and other
equitable  relief to prevent or restrain a breach of this Section 5.11(a) or
to  enforce the provisions hereof. Buyer and Seller acknowledge and agree 
that, notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement,  including
Article XI hereof, in the event of a breach by Seller or any  one or more of
its Subsidiaries of Section 5.11(a)(ii)(y) with regard to  any given Person,
Buyer\'s sole and exclusive remedy for such breach  shall be to cause Seller
to terminate the employment or consultancy of  such Person; provided,
however, that the foregoing shall not relieve  Seller from any liability for
its failure to comply with the provisions  of this sentence.   (b) Buyer
Covenant.   (i) For a period of two (2) years from and after the date 
hereof, neither Buyer nor any of its Subsidiaries shall, directly or 
indirectly, without the prior written consent of Seller, hire, employ or 
retain as a consultant or direct any other person    34     to hire,
employ or retain as a consultant, any officer or other employee  of Seller or
its Subsidiaries who is directly associated with a facility  of Seller or its
Subsidiaries that provides outpatient therapy in  affiliation with an
inpatient rehabilitation facility or (solely with  respect to the four
facilities listed in Section 5.11(a)(i) of the  Disclosure Letter that
provide outpatient therapy in affiliation with a  long-term acute care
hospital) long-term acute care hospital (a "Seller  Outpatient Employee") (or
any Person who was a Seller Outpatient  Employee within six (6) months of the
date of any such hiring, if such  Person\'s employment was not terminated by
Seller or its Subsidiaries).  Section 5.11(b)(i) of the Disclosure Statement,
as supplemented pursuant  to Section 5.7, sets forth a list of all current
Seller Outpatient  Employees. Buyer\'s obligations under this Section
5.11(b)(i) with  respect to new employees of Seller or its Subsidiaries hired
after the  Closing Date shall be subject to the condition that Seller shall
have  notified Buyer of the names of such new employees.   (ii) Buyer
hereby acknowledges and agrees that if Buyer or  any one or more of its
Subsidiaries breaches any provision of this  Section 5.11(b), any remedy at
law would be inadequate and that Buyer,  in addition to seeking monetary
damages in connection with any such  breach (other than a breach arising
under Section 5.11(b)(i)(y)), shall  be entitled to specific performance, and
injunctive and other equitable  relief to prevent or restrain a breach of
this Section 5.11(b) or to  enforce the provisions hereof. Buyer and Seller
acknowledge and agree  that, notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this
Agreement,  including Article XI hereof, in the event of a breach by Buyer or
any  one or more of its Subsidiaries of Section 5.11(b)(i)(y) with regard
to  any given Person, Seller\'s sole and exclusive remedy for such breach 
shall be to cause Buyer to terminate the employment or consultancy of  such
Person; provided, however, that the foregoing shall not relieve  Buyer from
any liability for its failure to comply with the provisions  of this
sentence.   (c) Mutual Covenant. Seller and Buyer intend that the
provisions of this Section 5.11 be enforced to the fullest extent permissible
under the laws applied in each jurisdiction in which enforcement is sought.
If any provision of this Section 5.11, or any part hereof, shall be held by a
court of competent jurisdiction to be invalid or unenforceable, this Section
5.11 shall be amended to revise the scope of such provision, to make it
enforceable to the fullest extent permitted by applicable Law, if possible,
or to delete such provision or such part, such revision or deletion to apply
only with respect to the operation of this Section 5.11 in the jurisdiction
of such court.    ARTICLE VI  ADDITIONAL AGREEMENTS 
---------------------  6.1 Tax Matters.   (a) Section 338(h)(10) Election;
Actions to Treat The Company and The Division Entities as Disregarded.  
(i) Seller and Buyer shall jointly make an election under  Section 338(h)(10)
of the Code (and any comparable provision of  applicable state or local
income Tax Law) with respect to the purchase  of the shares of the Company by
Buyer    35    (and with respect to the Division Entities, except those
if any as shall be mutually agreed upon by Buyer and Seller) and shall
cooperate with each other to take all actions necessary and appropriate
(including filing such additional forms, returns, elections schedules and
other documents as may be required) to effect and preserve a timely election,
in accordance with the provisions of Treasury Regulation Section
1.338(h)(10)-1 (or any comparable provisions of state or local Tax Law) (the
"Election").   (ii) In connection with the Election, Buyer and Seller
shall  mutually prepare an Internal Revenue Service Form 8023 (or successor 
form) and all other schedules and documents as may be required ("Form  8023")
and any comparable forms required by provisions of state or local  Law. With
the cooperation of Buyer, Seller shall prepare a draft Form  8023 and provide
such draft Form 8023 to Buyer within twenty (20) days  of the provision of
the Conclusive Statement, as provided in Section  1.6(a)(v) hereof. If,
within twenty (20) days of the receipt of the  draft Form 8023, Buyer
notifies Seller that it disagrees with the draft  Form 8023 and provides
Seller with a statement setting out the reasons  for its disagreement, then
Seller and Buyer shall attempt to resolve  their disagreement within the
twenty (20) days following Buyer\'s  notification to Seller of such
disagreement; otherwise, the draft Form  8023 shall become the Final Form
8023. If Seller and Buyer are unable to  resolve their disagreement, the
dispute shall be submitted to the  Accounting Arbiter or such other
internationally recognized accounting  firm as Seller and Buyer shall in good
faith agree (the "Independent  Accounting Firm"), whose expense shall be
borne equally by Seller and  Buyer, for resolution within twenty (20) days of
such submission. The  Form 8023 delivered by the Independent Accounting Firm
shall be the  Final Form 8023. The Final Form 8023 shall be binding on
Seller, Buyer,  and their respective Affiliates. Seller and Buyer shall take
no  position, and cause their respective Affiliates to take no position, 
inconsistent with the Final Form 8023. Neither Seller nor Buyer shall,  or
shall permit the Company and the Division Entities to, take any  action to
modify the Form 8023 (including any corrections, amendments or  supplements
thereto) after their execution or to modify or revoke the  Election following
the filing of the Form 8023 by Seller without the  written consent of Seller
or Buyer, as the case may be.   (iii) In connection with the Election, on or
prior to the  six-month anniversary of the Closing Date, (a) Buyer shall
provide to  Seller a proposed determination of the "Aggregate Deemed Sales
Price"  and the "Adjusted Grossed Up Basis" (each, as defined under
applicable  Treasury Regulations) with respect to the Company and the
Division  Entities (except those if any as shall be mutually agreed upon by
Buyer  and Seller), which allocations shall be made in accordance with
Section  338(b) of the Code and any applicable Treasury Regulations. Within 
fifteen (15) days following such provision, Seller shall have the right  to
dispute any such proposed determination or proposed allocation;  otherwise,
such proposed determination or proposed allocation shall  become final. If
Seller so disputes any such determination or allocation  and Buyer and Seller
are unable to resolve their disagreement within the  twenty (20) days
following notification of such dispute, the dispute  shall be submitted to
the Independent Accounting Firm, whose expense  shall be borne equally by
Buyer and Seller, for resolution within twenty  (20) days of such submission.
The decision of the Independent Accounting  Firm with respect to such dispute
shall be binding upon Buyer and  Seller. Seller and Buyer (a)   
36     shall be bound by the determinations and the allocations
determined  pursuant to this paragraph consistently therewith for purposes
of  determining any Taxes, including the preparation and filing of Internal 
Revenue Service Form 8883; (b) shall prepare and file all Tax Returns to  be
filed with any Tax authority in a manner consistent with such  allocations;
and (c) shall take no position inconsistent with such  allocations in any Tax
Return, any proceeding before any Tax authority  or otherwise. In the event
that any such allocation is disputed by any  Tax authority, the party
receiving notice of such dispute shall promptly  notify and consult with the
other party hereto concerning resolution of  such dispute.   (iv) Buyer and
Seller shall mutually prepare any forms or  schedules similar to Form 8023
that are required for provisions of state  or local Law that are comparable
to Treasury Regulations Section  1.338(h)(10)-1 in a manner similar to the
above procedure. In the event  that the Final Form 8023 (or similar forms or
schedules required for  provisions of state or local Law) is disputed by any
Tax authority, the  party receiving written notice of the dispute shall
promptly notify the  other party hereto concerning such dispute.   (v)
Notwithstanding the provisions of Sections 6.1(a)(i)  through (iv) or any
provision of Section 5.1, to the extent permitted by  applicable Law, Seller
may take such action, including converting the  Company and Division Entities
to limited liability companies or similar  forms of organization, and shall
make such elections as may be required  to cause the Company and each of the
Division Entities, other than those  Division Entities as may be mutually
agreed between Buyer and Seller  prior to Closing, to be treated as entities
each of which is disregarded  as separate from its owner, within the meaning
of Treasury Department  Regulation 301.7701-2(c)(2) (and any analogous
provision of state or  local Tax law) ("Disregarded Entities"), so that, with
respect to each  such Disregarded Entity Seller shall be treated as selling,
and Buyer  shall be treated as purchasing, for all Federal and applicable
state and  local income tax purposes, the assets (other than stock of
another  Disregarded Entity) held by such Disregarded Entity; provided,
however,  that Seller may not take such action without the prior written
consent  of Buyer with respect to the Company or any Division Entity if
such  action would preclude Buyer from obtaining a tax basis in the assets
of  such entity equal to the allocable portion of the Purchase Price 
pursuant to the provisions of Section 6.1(f) or would otherwise  adversely
affect Buyer. Deemed sales of assets pursuant to the  provisions of this
Section 6.1(a)(v) are referred to herein as "DRE  Sales."   (b) Tax Return
Filings, Refunds, and Credits.   (i) Seller shall timely prepare and file
(or cause such  preparation and filing) with the appropriate Tax authorities
all  required Tax Returns (including any Consolidated Income Tax Returns), 
and any amended Tax Returns, with respect to the Division, the Company  and
the Division Entities for Tax periods that end on or before the  Closing Date
(the "Seller Returns"), and will pay (or cause to be paid)  all Taxes due
with respect to Seller Returns. Seller shall provide Buyer  with a copy of
any such Seller Return.    37     (ii) Buyer shall timely prepare and
file (or cause such  preparation and filing) with the appropriate Tax
authorities all  required Tax Returns with respect to the Division, the
Company, and the  Division Entities for all Tax periods that include, but do
not end on,  the Closing Date (the "Straddle Period Returns"). The
preparation and  the filing shall be consistent with (including, as
necessary, attaching  copies of any relevant forms of its U.S. federal income
Tax Return for  the year including the Closing Date), and Buyer shall take no
position  that is inconsistent with, the Election (or, if applicable, the
DRE  Sales), or the forms filed with the Tax authorities with respect to
the  Election (or, if applicable, the DRE Sales) in any proceeding before
any  Tax authority. Buyer shall provide Seller with copies of any Straddle 
Period Returns at least thirty (30) Business Days (or such lesser period  if,
in the case of non-income Taxes, such forty-five (45) Business Day  deadline
is not reasonably practicable) prior to the due date thereof  (giving effect
to any extensions thereto), accompanied by a statement  (the "Straddle
Statement") setting forth and calculating in reasonable  detail the Pre-
Closing Taxes (as hereinafter defined). If Seller agrees  with the Straddle
Period Return and Straddle Statement, Seller shall pay  to Buyer an amount
equal to the Pre-Closing Taxes shown on the Straddle  Statement not later
than two (2) Business Days before the due date  (including any extensions
thereof) for payment of Taxes with respect to  such Straddle Period Return.
If, within ten (10) days of the receipt of  the Straddle Period Return and
Straddle Statement, Seller notifies Buyer  that it disputes the manner of
preparation of the Straddle Period Return  or the Pre-Closing Taxes shown on
the Straddle Statement, then Buyer and  Seller shall attempt to resolve their
disagreement within the five (5)  days following Seller\'s notification to
Buyer of such disagreement. If  Buyer and Seller are unable to resolve their
disagreement, the dispute  shall be submitted to the Independent Accounting
Firm, whose expense  shall be borne equally by Buyer and Seller, for
resolution within twenty  (20) days of such submission. The decision of the
Independent Accounting  Firm with respect to such dispute shall be binding
upon Buyer and  Seller, and Seller shall pay to Buyer an amount equal to the
Pre-Closing  Taxes, as decided by the Independent Accounting Firm, not later
than two  (2) Business Days before the due date (including any extensions
thereof)  for payment of Taxes with respect to such Straddle Period Return
or, if  later, within two (2) Business Days following the resolution of the 
amount of such Pre-Closing Taxes, provided that Seller shall reimburse  Buyer
for any undisputed amounts not later than two (2) Business Days  before the
due date (including applicable extensions) for the payment of  Taxes with
respect to such Straddle Period Return.   (iii) From and after the Closing
Date, Buyer and its  Affiliates (including the Company and the Division
Entities) shall not  file any amended Tax Return, carryback claim, or other
adjustment  request with respect to the Division, the Company or the
Division  Entities for any Tax period that includes or ends on or before
the  Closing Date unless Seller consents in writing; provided, however,
that  with respect to any Straddle Period, such consent shall not be 
unreasonably withheld, delayed or conditioned.   (iv) For purposes of this
Agreement, in the case of any  Taxes of the Division, the Company, or the
Division Entities that are  payable with respect to any Straddle Period, the
portion of any such  Taxes that constitutes "Pre-Closing Taxes" shall:   
38     (A) in the case of real property, personal property and other ad
valorem  Taxes imposed on a periodic basis with respect to the business or
assets  of the Division, the Company, or the Division Entities or otherwise 
measured by the level of any item, be deemed to be the amount of such  Taxes
for the entire Straddle Period (or, in the case of such Taxes  determined on
an arrears basis, the amount of such Taxes for the  immediately preceding Tax
period) multiplied by a fraction, the  numerator of which is the number of
calendar days in the portion of the  Straddle Period ending on the Closing
Date and the denominator of which  is the number of calendar days in the
entire Straddle Period, and (B) in  the case of all other Taxes that are
either (x) based upon or related to  income or receipts or (y) imposed in
connection with any sale, transfer  or assignment or any deemed sale,
transfer or assignment of property  (real or personal, tangible or
intangible), be deemed equal to the  amount that would be payable if the Tax
period ended on the Closing  Date. For purposes of clause (B) of the
preceding sentence, any  exemption, deduction, credit or other item that is
calculated on an  annual basis shall be allocated to the portion of the
Straddle Period  ending on the Closing Date on a pro rata basis determined by
multiplying  the total amount of such item allocated to the Straddle Period
times a  fraction, the numerator of which is the number of calendar days in
the  portion of the Straddle Period ending on the Closing Date and the 
denominator of which is the number of calendar days in the entire  Straddle
Period. The parties hereto shall, to the extent permitted by  applicable Law,
elect with the relevant Tax authority to treat a portion  of any Straddle
Period as a short taxable period ending as of the close  of business on the
Closing Date. For purposes of this Agreement,  "Post-Closing Taxes" shall
include any Taxes of the Division, the  Company, and the Division Entities
that are payable with respect to a  Straddle Period, except for the portion
of any such Taxes that  constitutes Pre-Closing Taxes.   (v) Seller and
Buyer shall reasonably cooperate in preparing  and filing all Tax Returns
with respect to the Division, the Company,  and the Division Entities,
including maintaining and making available to  each other all records
reasonably necessary in connection with Taxes of  the Division, the Company,
or the Division Entities and in resolving all  disputes and audits with
respect to all Tax periods relating to Taxes of  the Division, the Company,
and the Division Entities. Buyer shall  prepare (or cause such preparation)
within one hundred twenty (120) days  after the Closing Date, usual and
customary Consolidated Income Tax  Return reporting packages submitted to
Buyer by Seller with respect to  the Company and the Division Entities for
the taxable period ending on  December 31, 2006 and for the taxable period
beginning January 1, 2007,  and ending as of the Closing Date. Without
limiting the generality of  the foregoing, Buyer shall reasonably cooperate
(at Seller\'s expense) in  the preparation, filing and prosecution of any
claim for refunds of  Taxes with respect to any Tax Period ending on or
before the Closing  Date.   (vi) For a period of six years after the
Closing Date,  Seller and its representatives shall have reasonable access to
the books  and records (including the right to make extracts thereof) of
the  Division, the Company, and the Division Entities to the extent that
such  books and records relate to Taxes and to the extent that such access
may  reasonably be required by Seller in connection with matters relating
to  or affected by the operation of the Division (including the Division 
Entities) prior to the Closing Date.    39     Such access shall be
afforded by Buyer upon receipt of reasonable  advance notice and during
normal business hours. If Buyer shall desire  to dispose of any of such books
and records prior to the expiration of  such six-year period, Buyer shall,
prior to such disposition, give  Seller a reasonable opportunity, at
Seller\'s expense, to segregate and  remove such books and records as Seller
may select. In addition to the  foregoing, the parties agree to cooperate
with each other with respect  to the defense of any claims or litigation
relating to Taxes pertaining  to the Division, the Company, or the Division
Entities, provided that  the party requesting such cooperation shall
reimburse the other party  for the other party\'s reasonable out-of-pocket
costs and expenses of  furnishing such cooperation.   (vii) If a Tax
Indemnified Party (as hereinafter defined)  receives a refund or credit or
other reimbursement with respect to Taxes  for which, or a Tax Period with
respect to which, it would be  indemnified under this Agreement, the Tax
Indemnified Party shall pay  over such refund or credit or other
reimbursement to the Tax  Indemnifying Party (as hereinafter defined). For
the avoidance of doubt,  any refund of Taxes relating to the Division
received by Buyer with  respect to a Taxable Period ending on or before the
Closing Date shall  be paid over to Seller and any refund of Taxes relating
to the Division  received by Seller with respect to a Taxable Period ending
after the  Closing Date shall be paid over to Buyer.   (viii) To the
maximum extent allowed by law, Buyer must  carry back any Tax Benefit (as
hereinafter defined) which is  attributable to the Division, the Company, or
any of the Division  Entities for any Tax period ending on or before the
Closing Date or the  portion of the Straddle Period ending on the Closing
Date unless Buyer  requests and obtains the written consent of Seller to do
otherwise.   (ix) Buyer shall not, and shall cause the Company and the 
Division Entities not to, make, amend or revoke any Tax election if such 
action would adversely affect any Seller or its Affiliates with respect  to
any Tax period ending on or before the Closing Date or for the  portion of a
Straddle Period ending on the Closing Date or any Tax  refund with respect
thereto; provided that Buyer may take such actions  if it reimburses Seller
for the amount of Taxes resulting from such  election that Seller would
otherwise be responsible for hereunder.   (x) For purposes of this
Agreement, a "Consolidated Income  Tax Return" is any income Tax Return filed
with respect to any  consolidated, combined, affiliated or unified group
provided for under  Section 1501 of the Code and the Treasury Regulations
under Section 1502  of the Code, or any comparable provisions of foreign,
state or local  Law, other than any income Tax Return that includes only the
Company and  the Division Entities.   (c) Indemnity for Taxes.   (i)
Notwithstanding any other provision of this Agreement,  any indemnification
with respect to Taxes shall be exclusively governed  by the provisions of
this Section 6.1(c).    40     (ii) Seller shall indemnify Buyer
Indemnified Parties  against and hold them harmless from all liability for
(i) all Taxes  imposed on the Division, the Company, or the Division Entities
with  respect to Tax periods ending on or before the Closing Date, (ii) 
Pre-Closing Taxes determined pursuant to Section 6.1(b)(iv) with respect  to
any Straddle Period, (iii) all Taxes that are attributable to Seller  or any
member (other than the Company or the Division Entities) of an  Affiliated
Group to which Seller is or was the common parent prior to  the Closing Date
that is imposed under Treasury Regulations Section  1.1502-6 (or any similar
provision of state, local or foreign Tax Law)  by reason of the Company or
any of the Division Entities being included  in any such Tax group, (iv) all
Damages imposed or suffered by Buyer  Indemnified Parties by reason of or
arising from any breach of or  inaccuracy in any representation or warranty
of Seller with regard to  Taxes contained in Section 3.13 hereof, and (v) all
Taxes arising in  connection with or resulting from the Restructuring
Transactions (other  than Excess Restructuring Costs).   (iii) Buyer, the
Company, and the Division Entities shall  indemnify Seller and its Affiliates
against and hold them harmless from  all liability for (i) all Taxes of the
Division, the Company, and the  Division Entities with respect to Tax periods
beginning after the  Closing Date and (ii) Post-Closing Taxes, as determined
pursuant to  Section 6.1(b)(iv) with respect to any Straddle Period.   (iv)
The obligation of Seller to indemnify and hold harmless  Buyer Indemnified
Parties, on the one hand, and the obligations of  Buyer, the Company, and the
Division Entities to indemnify and hold  harmless Seller, on the other hand,
pursuant to this Section 6.1(c),  shall terminate sixty (60) days following
the expiration of the  applicable statutes of limitations with respect to the
Tax liabilities  in question (giving effect to any waiver, mitigation or
extension  thereof and except for claims that have been asserted prior to
that  time).   (v) A party seeking indemnification provided for under
this  Agreement (a "Tax Indemnified Party") in respect of Taxes arising out
of  or involving a claim or demand made by any third Person, including a
Tax  authority, against such party (a "Tax Third-Party Claim") must notify 
the party from whom such indemnification is sought (the "Tax  Indemnifying
Party") in writing of the Tax Third-Party Claim as promptly  as possible but
in no event later than ten (10) days after receipt by  the Tax Indemnified
Party of written notice of the Tax Third-Party  Claim; provided, however,
that failure to give such notification shall  not affect the indemnification
provided hereunder except to the extent  the Tax Indemnifying Party shall
have been actually prejudiced as a  result of such failure (except that the
Tax Indemnifying Party shall not  be liable for any expenses incurred during
the period in which the Tax  Indemnified Party failed to give such notice).
Thereafter, the Tax  Indemnified Party shall deliver to the Tax Indemnifying
Party, as  promptly as possible but in no event later than ten (10) days
after the  Tax Indemnified Party\'s receipt thereof, copies of all notices
and  documents (including court papers) received by the Tax Indemnified 
Party, relating to the Tax Third-Party Claim.    41     If a Tax Third-
Party Claim is made against the Tax Indemnified Party, the Tax Indemnifying
Party shall be entitled to participate in the defense thereof and (except in
the case of Straddle Period Taxes) to assume the defense thereof with counsel
or other Tax advisors selected by the Tax Indemnifying Party reasonably
satisfactory to the Tax Indemnified Party, if the Tax Indemnifying Party
expressly agrees in writing that, as between the two, the Tax Indemnifying
Party is solely responsible to satisfy and discharge the claim. If the Tax
Indemnifying Party assumes such defense, the Tax Indemnifying Party shall not
be liable to the Tax Indemnified Party for legal or other expenses
subsequently incurred by the Tax Indemnified Party in connection with the
defense thereof, provided, however, that the Tax Indemnifying Party shall be
liable for the reasonable fees and expenses of counsel employed by the Tax
Indemnified Party, if and to the extent that (i) the Tax Indemnifying Party
has not employed counsel reasonably satisfactory to the Tax Indemnified Party
to assume the defense of such action within a reasonable time after
commencement of the action; (ii) the employment of counsel and the amount
reimbursable therefor by the Tax Indemnified Party has been authorized in
writing by the Tax Indemnifying Party; or (iii) representation of the Tax
Indemnifying Party and the Tax Indemnified Party by the same counsel would,
in the reasonable opinion of such counsel, create a conflict of interest. If
the Tax Indemnifying Party assumes such defense, the Tax Indemnified Party
shall have the right to participate in the defense thereof and to employ
counsel or other Tax advisors, at its own expense separate from the counsel
or other Tax advisors employed by the Tax Indemnifying Party. Whether or not
the Tax Indemnifying Party chooses to defend or prosecute any Tax Third-Party
Claim, all of the parties hereto shall reasonably cooperate in the defense or
prosecution thereof. Such cooperation shall include the provision to the Tax
Indemnifying Party of records and information which are reasonably relevant
to such Tax Third-Party Claim, and making employees available on a mutually
convenient basis to provide additional information and explanation of any
material provided hereunder. Whether or not the Tax Indemnifying Party shall
have assumed the defense of a Tax Third-Party Claim, the Tax Indemnified
Party shall not admit any liability with respect to, or settle, compromise or
discharge, such Tax Third-Party Claim without the Tax Indemnifying Party\'s
prior written consent, which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld,
delayed or conditioned.   (d) Transfer and Similar Taxes. Notwithstanding
any other provisions of this Agreement to the contrary, all sales, use,
transfer, gains, stamp, duties, recording and similar Taxes (collectively,
"Transfer Taxes") incurred in connection with the transactions contemplated
by this Agreement shall be borne one-half by Buyer and one-half by Seller,
provided that all Transfer Taxes incurred in connection with the
Restructuring Transactions (other than Excess Restructuring Costs) shall be
borne by Seller. Seller shall accurately prepare and file all necessary Tax
Returns and other documentation with respect to Transfer Taxes and timely pay
all such Transfer Taxes. Buyer shall have reasonable opportunity to review
and comment on any such Tax Return prior to filing, and Seller shall make
such changes thereto as Buyer shall reasonably request. Buyer shall pay to
Seller its share, if any, of the Transfer Tax shown to be due on the Tax
Return as agreed within ten (10) Business Days after such Tax Return is given
to Buyer. If required by applicable Law, Buyer will join in the execution of
any such Return.   (e) Termination of Tax Sharing Agreements. On or prior to
the Closing Date, any agreement with respect to Taxes to which the Company or
any of the Division Entities is a party shall be terminated (other
than agreements, arrangements or practices solely    42    between or
among the Company and the Division Entities), all obligations thereunder
shall be settled no later than immediately prior to the Closing and no
additional payments shall be made under any provisions thereof after
the Closing Date.   (f) Allocation of Purchase Price. Within thirty (30)
Business Days following the date hereof, Buyer shall prepare and deliver, or
cause to be prepared and delivered, to Seller, an allocation of the Initial
Purchase Price among the assets of the Company and the Division Entities and
the non-competition covenant set forth in Section 5.11 hereof (the
"Allocation"). If, within thirty (30) Business Days of the receipt of the
Allocation, Seller notifies Buyer that it disagrees with the Allocation and
provides Buyer with a notice setting out in reasonable detail the reasons for
its disagreement (the "Allocation Dispute Notice"), then Seller and Buyer
shall attempt to resolve their disagreement within the ten (10) days
following Buyer\'s receipt of Seller\'s Allocation Dispute Notice; otherwise,
the Allocation shall become the "Final Allocation." If Seller and Buyer are
unable to resolve their disagreement, the disputed items set forth in the
Allocation Dispute Notice shall be submitted to the Independent Accounting
Firm, whose expense shall be borne equally by Seller and Buyer. The
Independent Accounting Firm shall determine and report in writing to Seller
and Buyer as to its determination of all disputed matters submitted to the
Independent Accounting Firm and the effect of such determinations on the
Allocation within ten (10) Business Days after such submission, and such
determinations shall be final, binding and conclusive as to Seller, Buyer and
their respective Affiliates. In resolving any disputed item set forth in the
Allocation Dispute Notice, the Independent Accounting Firm, acting in its
capacity as an expert and not as an arbitrator: (i) shall limit its review to
matters specifically set forth in Buyer\'s Allocation Dispute Notice as a
disputed item (other than those items thereafter resolved by mutual written
agreement of Seller and Buyer) and (ii) shall not assign a value to any item
greater than the greatest value for such item claimed by any party or less
than the smallest value for such item claimed by any other party in the
Allocation prepared by Seller or Buyer\'s Allocation Dispute Notice delivered
pursuant to this Section 6.1(f). Each of Seller and Buyer shall have the
right, within five (5) Business Days of submission of any disputed item to
the Independent Accounting Firm, to meet with representatives of the
Independent Accounting Firm and present its position as to the resolution of
such disputed item. In addition, Seller and Buyer shall each furnish to the
Independent Accounting Firm such work papers and other documents and
information relating to the disputed items, as the Independent Accounting
Firm may reasonably request. Buyer and Seller agree to (i) be bound by the
Final Allocation, (ii) act in a manner consistent with the Final Allocation
for all purposes, including, without limitation, the preparation of financial
statements and filing of all Tax Returns and in the course of any Tax audit,
Tax review or Tax litigation relating thereto, and (iii) take no position,
and cause their Affiliates to take no position, inconsistent with the Final
Allocation for any purpose, in each case, except as otherwise required by
Law.   6.2 Division Employees; Employee Contracts and Benefits.   (a)
Continuation of Employment. At or prior to the Closing, Buyer shall make "at
will" offers of employment to all employees of Seller and its Subsidiaries
who are    43    actively employed by Seller and who work at any of the
Facilities, as well as those employees of Seller and its Subsidiaries who are
primarily involved in actively providing services to the Division and who are
listed in Section 6.2(a) of the Disclosure Letter (the "Division Offerees")
on the terms described in Section 6.2(b). Any employees of Seller and its
Subsidiaries who are normally employed in connection with the operation of
the Facilities, or primarily in providing services to the Division and who
are listed on Schedule 6.2(a) of the Disclosure Letter and are on approved
leave of absence, including by reason of short or long term disability, shall
become Division Offerees if, and only if, they are able to return to active
employment within 180 days after Closing. Buyer agrees to hire the Division
Offerees who accept such offer of employment. Division Offerees who accept
their employment offers and commence employment with Buyer pursuant to such
offers shall be referred to herein as "Transferred Employees." If, at any
time from the Transition Date until the date that is one year after the
Transition Date, Buyer, the Company or any Division Entity terminate the
employment of any Transferred Employee (other than any Transferred Employee
listed in Section 6.2(g) of the Disclosure Letter), Buyer shall be
responsible for any severance due such employees under the severance plan of
Seller disclosed in Section 6.2(a) of the Disclosure Letter (the "Severance
Policy") and shall indemnify and hold harmless Seller against any Damages
arising in connection therewith. If, at any time from and after the date that
is one year after the Transition Date, Buyer, the Company or any Division
Entity terminate the employment of any Transferred Employee (other than any
Transferred Employee listed in Section 6.2(g) of the Disclosure Letter),
Buyer shall be responsible for any severance due such employees under any
applicable severance plan of Buyer and shall indemnify and hold harmless
Seller against any Damages arising in connection therewith. If a Division
Offeree does not accept Buyer\'s offer of employment where such offer did not
reflect a base salary or wage rate, as applicable, bonus opportunities and
employee benefits comparable in the aggregate to (or in excess of) the base
salary or wage rate, as applicable, bonus opportunities (excluding
transaction, retention or similar bonuses) and employee benefits provided to
such Division Offeree as of the date hereof, Buyer shall be responsible for
any severance due such Division Offeree under the Severance Policy and shall
indemnify and hold harmless Seller against any Damages arising in connection
therewith. If a Division Offeree does not accept Buyer\'s offer of employment
where such offer reflected a base salary or wage rate, as applicable, bonus
opportunities and employee benefits comparable in the aggregate to (or in
excess of) the base salary or wage rate, as applicable, bonus opportunities
(excluding transaction, retention or similar bonuses) and employee benefits
provided to such Division Offeree as of the date hereof, Seller shall be
responsible for any severance due such Division Offeree under the Severance
Policy and shall indemnify and hold harmless Buyer against any Damages
arising in connection therewith.   (b) Compensation and Benefits. Subject to
Section 6.2(g) hereof, upon the Transition Date, Buyer shall offer, or shall
cause, as applicable, a Subsidiary of Buyer to offer, a base salary or wage
rate, as applicable, bonus opportunity and employee benefits to the
Transferred Employees that are substantially similar to those offered by
Buyer, or the relevant Subsidiary of Buyer, to its own similarly situated
employees. Any employee benefits provided to such Transferred Employees will
be provided under existing or newly established employee benefit plans which
will, in either case, be employee benefit plans of Buyer, a Subsidiary of
Buyer, the Company or a Division Entity (any such employee benefit plan in
which Transferred Employees participate, the "Applicable Buyer Plan") and

Section 6.2(d) on the date on which the services or other benefits giving
rise to that liability are provided without regard to when any bill or other
demand for payment is made. Seller shall not be liable for any liabilities

evidence of insurability under the  Applicable Buyer Plan for Transferred
Employees to the extent such  restrictions have been or would have been
satisfied under Seller Welfare  Plans. Transferred Employees shall receive
credit under each Applicable  Buyer Plan for co-payments and payments under a

limits applicable to  them during the plan year of Seller Welfare Plan in
which the Transition  Date occurs in accordance with the corresponding Seller

Seller in connection with the termination of employment of any employee
listed in Section 6.2(g) of the Disclosure Letter, provided that, as a
condition of that reimbursement Seller has taken all such actions as are
reasonably necessary to ensure that Buyer, its Subsidiaries, the Company and
the Division Entities are entitled to the protections of all restrictive
covenants, including without limitation, non-competition, protection of
confidential information and non-solicitation of employees, to which any of

to Transferred Employees employed by Buyer or a Subsidiary of Buyer for
purposes of Taxes imposed under the United States Federal Unemployment Tax
Act or the United States Federal Insurance Contributions Act, and (ii)
cooperate with each other to avoid the filing of more than one IRS Form W-2
with respect to each such Transferred Employee for the calendar year in which
the Transition Date occurs.   (i) WARN Act Requirements. On and after the

posting surety bonds or purchasing insurance policies.   6.4 Use of
Seller\'s Name and Logo. It is expressly agreed that Buyer is not purchasing,
acquiring or otherwise obtaining any right, title or interest in and to the

identifying logos or service marks related thereto or employing the words
"HealthSouth" or any part or variation of any of the foregoing or any
confusingly similar trade name, trademark, Internet domain name, logo or
service mark (collectively, "Seller\'s Trademarks and
Logos"). Notwithstanding the foregoing, the parties agree that during the
period from the Closing Date until one hundred eighty (180) days after the
Closing Date (the "Wind-down Period"), the Division Entities shall be
entitled to continue to use Seller\'s Trademarks and Logos to the extent that
such Seller\'s Trademarks and Logos exist or are contained as of the Closing
Date on any business cards, schedules, stationery, displays, signs,
promotional materials, manuals, forms, computer software and other similar
material used by the Division prior to the Closing Date in the operation of
the Division. The nature and quality of all uses of Seller\'s Trademarks and
Logos made by the Division Entities shall conform to the quality standards
set by Seller and communicated to Buyer, the Company or the Division
Entities, either directly or indirectly. Buyer, the Company and the Division
Entities shall not use Seller\'s Trademarks and Logos in any manner which
might dilute, tarnish or disparage Seller or Seller\'s Trademarks and Logos.
Buyer agrees that immediately upon termination of the Wind-down Period, Buyer
shall cause the Division Entities to cease and desist from all further use of
Seller\'s Trademarks and Logos and shall adopt new trade names, trademarks,
Internet domain names, identifying logos and service marks related thereto
which are not confusingly similar to Seller\'s Trademarks and Logos.

schematics, help files, documentation and other material that a reasonably
skilled programmer would need to operate, maintain, support and modify the
HPAS, Data Warehouse and Intranet applications. Seller shall deliver the

Division. In connection with the delivery of the HPAS, Data Warehouse and
Intranet source code as provided herein, Seller hereby grants to Buyer and
its Subsidiaries a perpetual, irrevocable, assignable, non-exclusive,
worldwide, royalty-free and fully paid-up license to use, reproduce,
distribute, display, modify, create derivative works of and otherwise exploit
the HPAS, Data Warehouse and Intranet applications.   6.6 Enterprise

service agreements used by the Division Entities and set forth in Section 6.6
of the Disclosure Letter, which have been acquired by Seller on an enterprise
basis on behalf of the Company, the Division Entities or, as applicable,
other Affiliates of Seller (the "Enterprise Systems"). Seller shall assist
Buyer in effecting such assignments or transfers under the Enterprise System
agreements as are set forth in Section 6.6 of the Disclosure Letter, which
Buyer and Seller have determined are necessary for the Division Entities to
continue to use such Enterprise Systems following the Closing, provided that
any such transfer or assignment shall involve only the capacity or volume
used by the Division Entities under such agreements. Buyer shall be fully
responsible for the payment of any fee or charge imposed by a licensor,
lessor, or service provider under any Enterprise Systems as a consequence of
such transfer. No other rights under computer hardware and software licenses,
leases and service agreements used by the Division Entities which have been
acquired by Seller on an enterprise basis on behalf of the Company, the
Division Entities or, as applicable, other Affiliates of Seller shall be
assigned or transferred to Buyer, the Company or any Division Entity pursuant
to this Agreement, and Buyer, the Company and the Division Entities shall not
be responsible for the payment of any support, lease or license fees due and
owing after Closing with respect to any such other computer hardware and
software licenses, leases and service agreements.    ARTICLE VII

any such Third-Party Claim; provided,  however, that failure to give such
notification shall not affect the  indemnification provided hereunder except
to the extent the indemnifying  party shall have been materially prejudiced
as a result of such failure;  and (B) the indemnifying party shall have the
right to undertake the  defense thereof by counsel chosen by it that is
reasonably acceptable to  the indemnified party, if the claim involves solely
monetary damages and  the indemnifying party expressly agrees in writing with
the indemnified  party that, as between the two, the indemnifying party is
solely  responsible to satisfy and discharge the claim; provided, that if
the  indemnifying party assumes such defense, the indemnified party shall 
have the right to participate in the defense thereof and to employ  counsel,
at its own expense, separate from the counsel employed by the  indemnifying
party, it being understood that the indemnifying party  shall control such
defense; provided further, however, that the  indemnifying party shall be
liable for the reasonable fees and expenses  of counsel employed by the
indemnified party, if and to the extent that  (x) the indemnifying party has
not employed counsel reasonably  satisfactory to the indemnified party to
assume the defense of such  action within a reasonable time after receiving
notice of the  commencement of the action; (y) the employment of counsel and
the amount  reimbursable therefor by the indemnified party has been
authorized in  writing by the indemnifying party; or (z) representation of
the  indemnifying party and the indemnified    54     party by the
same counsel would, in the reasonable opinion of such  counsel, create a
conflict of interest;   (ii) Until the indemnifying party assumes the
defense of a  Third-Party Claim, the indemnified party shall have the right
to  undertake the defense, compromise or settlement of such Third-Party 
Claim on behalf of and for the account and risk of the indemnifying  party
subject to the right of the indemnifying party to assume the  defense of such
Third-Party Claim at any time prior to settlement,  compromise or final
determination thereof (subject to subclause (B) of  clause (i) above);
and   (iii) Notwithstanding any provision in this Article XI to  the
contrary, without the prior written consent of the indemnified party  (which
consent shall not be unreasonably withheld, delayed or  conditioned), the
indemnifying party shall not admit any liability with  respect to, or settle,
compromise or discharge, any Third-Party Claim or  consent to the entry of
any judgment with respect thereto, except in the  case of any settlement that
(A) includes as an unconditional term  thereof the delivery by the claimant
or plaintiff to the indemnified  party of a written release from all
liability in respect of such  Third-Party Claim and which does not impose any
obligation on the  indemnified party, or (B) provides solely for monetary
relief to be paid  by the indemnifying party and which does not otherwise
involve or  purport to bind or limit the indemnified party. In addition, if
the  indemnifying party shall have assumed the defense of the Third-Party 
Claim, the indemnified party shall not admit any liability with respect  to,
or settle, compromise or discharge, any Third-Party Claim or consent  to the
entry of any judgment with respect thereto, without the prior  written
consent of the indemnifying party (which consent shall not be  unreasonably
withheld, delayed or conditioned), and the indemnifying  party will not be
subject to any liability for any such admission,  settlement, compromise,
discharge or consent to judgment made by an  indemnified party without such
prior written consent of the indemnifying  party.   11.7 Other Claims. In
the event any indemnified party should have a claim against any indemnifying
party under Section 11.2 or 11.4 hereof that does not involve a Third-Party
Claim being asserted against or sought to be collected from such indemnified
party, the indemnified party shall, as promptly as practicable after
discovery of such claim, deliver written notice of such claim to the
indemnifying party. The failure by any indemnified party so to notify the
indemnifying party shall not relieve the indemnifying party from any
liability which it may have to such indemnified party under Section 11.2 or
11.4 hereof, except to the extent that the indemnifying party shall have been
materially prejudiced by such failure. If the indemnifying party does not
notify the indemnified party within twenty (20) Business Days following its
receipt of such notice that the indemnifying party disputes its liability to
the indemnified party under Section 11.2 or 11.4 hereof, such claim specified
by the indemnified party in such notice shall be conclusively deemed a
liability of the indemnifying party under Section 11.2 or 11.4 hereof and the
indemnifying party shall pay the amount of such liability to the indemnified
party on demand or, in the case of any notice in which the amount of the
claim (or any portion thereof) is estimated, on such later date when the
amount of such claim (or such portion thereof) becomes finally determined. If
the indemnifying party has timely disputed its liability with respect to such
claim, as provided above, the indemnifying party and the indemnified party
shall proceed in    55    good faith to negotiate a resolution of such
dispute and, if not resolved through negotiations, such dispute shall be
resolved by litigation in an appropriate Court of competent jurisdiction.  
11.8 Sole Remedy.   (a) Buyer and Seller acknowledge and agree that, if the
Closing occurs, their sole and exclusive remedy for monetary damages
following the Closing with respect to any and all claims, including Buyer
Claims and Seller Claims (whether Third-Party Claims or otherwise), relating
to the subject matter of this Agreement shall be pursuant to the provisions
set forth in Section 6.1(c) hereof and this Article XI; provided, however,
that nothing contained herein shall prevent an indemnified party from
pursuing remedies as may be available to such party under applicable Law in
the event of an indemnifying party\'s fraud or failure to comply with its
indemnification obligations hereunder.   (b) The indemnifying party shall
be subrogated to the rights of the indemnified party in respect of any
insurance relating to the Damages to the extent of any indemnification
payments made hereunder. The parties agree that the indemnification
obligations of the parties set forth in this Agreement do not in any way
change or modify any duty of any party to mitigate its Damages under
applicable Law; provided that, with regard to any indemnification obligation
of Seller under 11.2(h), Seller and Buyer agree that Buyer\'s duty to
mitigate shall include the entry into a management agreement with Seller or
relocation of the applicable Facility in accordance with the last sentence of
Section 2.4(c). Any liability for indemnification hereunder shall be
determined without duplication of recovery by reason of the state of facts
giving rise to such liability constituting a breach of more than one
representation, warranty, covenant or agreement.   (c) Buyer and Seller
agree to treat (and cause their Affiliates to treat), to the extent permitted
by applicable Law, any indemnification payment under this Agreement as an
adjustment to the Purchase Price. Any indemnification obligation under this
Agreement shall be net of (i) any Tax Benefit actually realized by the
indemnified party or its Affiliates, and (ii) any insurance proceeds or any
indemnity, contribution or other similar payment received by the indemnified
party or its Affiliates from any third party with respect thereto, net of any
expenses related to the recovery of such proceeds and net of any increase in
premiums of retroactive premium adjustments. The indemnified party shall use
its commercially reasonable efforts, at no cost to the Indemnified Party, to
obtain full recovery under all insurance policies covering any
indemnification obligation to the same extent as they would if such
indemnification obligation were not subject to indemnification under
this Agreement (it being understood that Buyer shall have no obligation to
make a claim against Buyer\'s insurance policies with respect to any matter
that is covered by Seller\'s self-insurance program). In the event that an
insurance or other recovery is received by any indemnified party with respect
to any indemnification obligation for which any such Person has been
indemnified under this Agreement, then a refund equal to the aggregate amount
of the recovery shall be made promptly to the indemnifying party. As used
herein, "Tax Benefit" shall mean the Tax savings attributable to any
deduction, expense, loss, credit or refund to the indemnified party or its
Affiliates, when actually realized, net of any Tax detriment associated with
the receipt, or right to receive indemnification hereunder. The amount of any
Tax Benefit actually realized shall be equal to the actual reduction in Taxes
paid    56    in cash determined with the applicable Tax items taken
into account as compared with the Taxes that would have been payable without
the applicable Tax items.   (d) For purposes of this Agreement, except with
respect to damages claimed by a third party, the parties acknowledge and
agree that Damages shall not include damages incurred directly or indirectly
as a result of lost profits or any special, consequential or punitive
damages. Notwithstanding the foregoing, it is understood and agreed that the
limitation on recovery of lost profits, special, consequential or punitive
damages contained in the preceding sentence shall not limit a party\'s
ability to recover direct or general damages or change or have any bearing on
the interpretation of what constitutes direct or general damages, it
being understood that direct and general damages shall be given its normal
meaning under the Law.   (e) It is agreed that, solely in determining
whether there has been a breach of any provision under this Agreement for
purposes of this Article XI, the concepts of materiality, Material Adverse
Effect, "in all material respects" and other similar qualifying language
contained in such provision shall be read to mean that the breach of or
failure to comply with such provision has resulted, or would reasonably be
expected to result, in Damages to the non-breaching party in excess of
$100,000; provided, however, that in the event that there has been a breach
of such provision after giving effect to such qualifying language (as read in
the manner set forth above in this Section 11.8(e)), then for purposes of
determining whether the Basket has been exceeded with respect to such breach
or breaches and the amount of any resulting Damages, the concept of
materiality, Material Adverse Effect, "in all material respects" and other
similar qualifying language contained in the representations and warranties
and certifications of or on behalf of the applicable party shall be
disregarded.   (f) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained
herein, no limitation or condition of liability or indemnity shall apply to
any rights or claims based upon fraud or intentional misrepresentation.  
(g) No right of indemnification hereunder shall be limited by reason of any
investigation or audit conducted before or after the Closing or the knowledge
of the non-breaching party of any breach of a representation, warranty,
covenant or agreement contained in this Agreement or in any certificate
delivered pursuant hereto by the other party at any time, or the decision of
any party to complete the Closing.    ARTICLE XII  MISCELLANEOUS

between the Confidentiality Agreement and this Agreement, the terms of this
Agreement shall govern. This Agreement supersedes all prior agreements and
understandings, oral and written, with respect to its subject matter.  
12.5 Severability. Should any provision of this Agreement for any reason be
declared invalid or unenforceable, such decision shall not affect the
validity or enforceability of any of the other provisions of this Agreement,
which other provisions shall remain in full force and effect and the
application of such invalid or unenforceable provision to Persons
or circumstances other than those as to which it is held invalid or
unenforceable shall be valid and be enforced to the fullest extent permitted
by Law.   12.6 Binding Effect; Assignment. This Agreement and all of

prior written consent of the other party hereto; (b) the rights and

subsidiaries, which at the time of such assignment own the Shares, provided
that no such assignment shall limit or affect Seller\'s obligations

of its wholly-owned Subsidiaries, provided that no such assignment shall
limit or affect Buyer\'s obligations hereunder.   12.7 No Third-Party
Beneficiaries. This Agreement is not intended and shall not be deemed to
confer upon or give any Person except the parties hereto and their respective
successors and permitted assigns any remedy, claim, liability, reimbursement,
cause of action or other right under or by reason of this Agreement (except
as set forth in Article XI hereof with respect to Buyer Indemnified Parties
and Seller Indemnified Parties).   12.8 Counterparts. This Agreement may be
executed in counterparts (including by facsimile), each of which shall be
deemed an original, but all of which together shall constitute one and the
same instrument.   12.9 Interpretation. The article and section headings
contained in this Agreement are solely for the purpose of reference, are not
part of the agreement of the parties and shall not in any way affect the
meaning or interpretation of this Agreement. As used in this Agreement, the
term "including" shall mean including, without limitation, and, unless the
context otherwise requires, the word "or" is not exclusive. All references in
this Agreement to "dollars" or "$" shall mean United States dollars.

Delaware (collectively, the "Courts"), and each of Seller and Buyer (on its

now or hereafter have to the laying of venue of any such proceeding, and

suit, action or proceeding. EACH OF THE PARTIES HERETO HEREBY IRREVOCABLY
WAIVES ALL RIGHT TO A TRIAL BY JURY IN ANY SUIT, ACTION OR PROCEEDING
(INCLUDING ANY COUNTERCLAIM) ARISING OUT OF OR BASED UPON THIS AGREEMENT.  
12.11 Governing Law. This Agreement shall be governed by and construed in
accordance with the laws of the State of Delaware, without regard to the
principles of conflicts of law thereof (to the extent that the application of
the laws of another jurisdiction would be required thereby).   12.12
Specific Performance. Each party hereto acknowledges that money damages would
be both incalculable and an insufficient remedy for any breach of this
Agreement by such party and that any such breach would cause the other party
hereto irreparable harm. Accordingly, each party hereto also agrees that, in
the event of any breach or threatened breach of the provisions of this
Agreement by such party, the other party hereto shall be entitled
to equitable relief without the requirement of posting a bond or other
security, including in the form of injunctions and orders for specific
performance, in addition to all other remedies available to such other
parties at law or in equity. The provisions of this Section 12.12 shall not
apply with regard to Section 5.11, which shall be governed by the terms set
forth therein.   12.13 Waivers. Except as otherwise provided herein, no
action taken pursuant to this Agreement, including any investigation by or on

taking such action of compliance with any representations, warranties,
covenants or agreements contained in this Agreement or in any of the
Ancillary Agreements. Any term, covenant or condition of this Agreement may
be waived at any time by the party which is entitled to the benefit thereof,
but only by a written notice signed by such party expressly waiving such term
or condition. The waiver by any party hereto of a breach of any provision
hereunder shall not operate or be construed as a waiver of any prior or
