  1.2 _Interpretation_. (a) When a reference is made in
this Agreement to Articles, Sections, Exhibits or Schedules, such reference
will be to an Article or Section or Exhibit or Schedule to this Agreement
unless otherwise indicated. The table of contents and headings contained in
this Agreement are for reference purposes only and will not affect in any way
the meaning or interpretation of this Agreement. Whenever the words
"include," "includes" or "including" are used in this Agreement, they will be
deemed to be followed by the words "without limitation." Unless the context
otherwise requires, (i) "or" is disjunctive but not necessarily exclusive,
(ii) words in the singular include the plural and vice versa, (iii) the use in
this Agreement of a pronoun in reference to a party hereto includes the
masculine, feminine or neuter, as the context may require, and (iv) unless
otherwise defined herein, terms used herein which are defined in GAAP have the
meanings ascribed to them therein. Without prejudice to any party\'s rights
and remedies for breach of a representation or warranty made by another party
under this Agreement, this Agreement will not be interpreted or construed to
require any Person to take any action, or fail to take any action, that would
violate any applicable Law. The Company Disclosure Schedule, as well as
all other Schedules and all Exhibits hereto, will be deemed part of this
Agreement and included in any reference to this Agreement. Notwithstanding
anything in this Agreement to the contrary, the mere inclusion of an item in
any Schedule or Exhibit hereto as an exception to a representation or
warranty will not merely by the fact of such inclusion be deemed an admission
that such item represents a material exception or material fact, event or
circumstance or that such item has had or would, individually or in the
aggregate, reasonably be expected to have a Parent Material Adverse Effect, an
Acquisition Sub Material Adverse Effect or a Company Material Adverse Effect,
as the case may be.

 

  (b) The parties have participated
jointly in negotiating and drafting this Agreement. In the event that an
ambiguity or a question of intent or interpretation arises, this Agreement
will be construed as if drafted jointly by the parties, and no presumption or
burden of proof will arise favoring or disfavoring any party by virtue of the
authorship of any provision of this Agreement.

the satisfaction or, where permitted, the waiver of those conditions), or at
such other date, time or place as Acquisition Sub and Company may agree in
writing. The date on which the Closing occurs is referred to as the "
_Closing Date_."

 

  (c) Subject to the provisions of this
Agreement, at the Closing, Company and Acquisition Sub will cause articles of
merger (the " _Articles of Merger_ ") to be executed, acknowledged and filed
with the Registrar, or Deputy Registrar, of Corporations in accordance with
the applicable provisions of the BCA. The Merger will become effective at such
time as the Articles of Merger have been duly filed with the Registrar, or

specified in the Articles of Merger (the time that the Merger becomes
effective in accordance with the BCA is referred to in this Agreement as the "

  (d) The Merger will have the effects set
forth in this Agreement and the BCA. Without limiting the generality or effect
of the foregoing, as of the Effective Time, all properties,
rights, privileges, powers and franchises of Acquisition Sub and Company will
vest in the Surviving Corporation and all debts, liabilities and duties of
Acquisition Sub and Company will become debts, liabilities and duties of the
Surviving Corporation. 

 

  3.2 _Articles of Incorporation and Bylaws_. At the
Effective Time, the articles of incorporation and bylaws of Acquisition
Sub, as in effect immediately prior to the Effective Time, will be the
articles of incorporation (the " _Charter_ ") and bylaws (the " _Bylaws_ ") of
the Surviving Corporation, except that the Charter and the Bylaws will be
amended as of the Effective Time to change the name of the Surviving
Corporation to [Omaha], and as so amended, the Charter and Bylaws will be the
articles of incorporation and bylaws of the Surviving Corporation until
thereafter amended as provided therein or by applicable Law.

 

  3.3 _Directors_. The directors of Acquisition Sub
immediately prior to the Effective Time will be the initial directors of
the Surviving Corporation and will hold office

     

 until their respective successors are duly elected or appointed and
qualified, or their earlier death, resignation or removal, in accordance with
the Charter and Bylaws.

 

  3.4 _Officers_. The officers of Company immediately
prior to the Effective Time will be the initial officers of the
Surviving Corporation and will hold office until their respective successors
are duly elected or appointed and qualified, or their earlier death,
resignation or removal, in accordance with the Charter and Bylaws.

 

  3.5 _Conversion of Shares_. (a) Each Share issued and
outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time (other than Shares owned
by Parent, Acquisition Sub or any other Subsidiary of Parent or Company or
held in the treasury of Company, all of which will by virtue of the Merger and
without any action on part of the holder thereof be cancelled without any
consideration being exchanged therefor and other than Dissenting Shares)
will, by virtue of the Merger and without any action on the part of Company,
Parent or Acquisition Sub or their respective shareholders, be converted at
the Effective Time into the right to receive the Acquisition Price (subject
to any applicable withholding tax specified in _Section 3.7_ ), without
interest, upon the surrender of the certificate representing such Shares and
a letter of transmittal as provided in _Section 4.1_. At the Effective Time,
all such Shares will no longer be outstanding and will automatically be
canceled and will cease to exist, and each holder of such Shares will cease
to have any rights with respect thereto, except the right to receive the
Acquisition Price as provided herein, without interest or dividends thereon.

 

  (b) The Acquisition Price will be
adjusted to reflect fully the effect of any reclassification, stock split,
reverse split, stock dividend (including any dividend or distribution of
securities convertible into Shares), occurring (or for which a record date is
established) after the date hereof and prior to the Effective Time; _provided_
that nothing herein will be construed to permit Company to take any action
with respect to its securities that is prohibited by the terms of this
Agreement.

 

  3.6 _Common Stock of Acquisition Sub_. Each share of
common stock of Acquisition Sub issued and outstanding immediately prior
to the Effective Time will remain issued and outstanding.

 

  3.7 _Withholding Taxes_. Acquisition Sub or the

(or cause the Paying Agent to deduct and withhold) from the consideration
otherwise payable to a holder of Shares, Company Options or Restricted Shares
pursuant to the Offer, the Merger or this Agreement any stock transfer taxes
and such amounts as are required to be withheld under the Code, or any
applicable provision of state, local or foreign Tax Law. To the extent that
amounts are so withheld, such withheld amounts will be treated for all
purposes of this Agreement as having been paid to the holder of the Shares in
respect of which such deduction and withholding was made.

 

  3.8 _Dissenting Shares_. Notwithstanding anything in
this Agreement to the contrary, Shares (" _Dissenting Shares_ ") that are
outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time and held by a holder that
has delivered a written objection to the

     

 proposed corporate action and a demand for payment of such shares in
accordance with Sections 100 and 101 of the BCA (" _Dissenting Shareholder_
"), will not be converted into the right to receive the Acquisition Price
unless and until such holder fails to perfect or effectively withdraws or
otherwise loses its right to payment as a Dissenting Shareholder under the
BCA. From and after the Effective Time, a Dissenting Shareholder will not be
entitled to exercise any of the voting rights or other rights of a shareholder
of the Surviving Corporation. If any Dissenting Shareholder fails to perfect
or has effectively withdrawn or otherwise lost its right to payment as a
Dissenting Shareholder, such Dissenting Shares will thereupon be converted
into and become exchangeable for the right to receive, as of the Effective
Time, the Acquisition Price pursuant to  _Section 3.5_ for each Share,
without interest or dividends thereon. Company will give Parent and
Acquisition Sub (a) prompt notice of any demands received by Company for
payment of Shares, written demands for appraisal of any Shares, attempted
withdrawals of such demands and any other instruments served pursuant to the
BCA and received by Company relating to shareholders\' rights of appraisal or
dissent and (b) the opportunity to direct all negotiations and proceedings
with respect to demands for appraisal or dissent under the BCA. Neither
Company nor Surviving Corporation will, except with the prior written consent
of Parent, voluntarily make any payment with respect to, or settle or offer
to settle, any such demands.

 

 IV. PAYMENT FOR SHARES; OPTIONS

 

  4.1 _Payment for Shares_. (a) Prior to the Effective
Time, Parent will select a bank or trust company (reasonably acceptable
to Company) to act as the paying agent (the " _Paying Agent_ ") with respect
to the payment of the Acquisition Price. At or prior to the Effective Time,
Parent or Acquisition Sub will make available to the Paying Agent sufficient
funds to make the payments due pursuant to _Section 3.5_  on a timely basis
to Company Shareholders that own Shares that are issued and outstanding
immediately prior to the Effective Time (such funds being hereinafter referred
to as the " _Payment_ _Fund_ "). The Paying Agent will, pursuant to
irrevocable instructions, make payments provided for in the preceding sentence
out of the Payment Fund. Such funds may be invested by the Paying Agent as
directed by Parent or Acquisition Sub or, after the Effective Time, the
Surviving Corporation; _provided_ , that (i) no such investment or
losses thereon will affect the Acquisition Price payable to Company
Shareholders and following any losses (net of any gains) Parent or Acquisition
Sub will promptly provide additional funds to the Paying Agent for the benefit
of the Company Shareholders in the amount of any such losses (net of any
gains) and (ii) such investments will be in obligations of or guaranteed by
the United States of America and backed by the full faith and credit of the
United states of America or in commercial paper obligations rated A-1 or P-1
or better by Moody\'s Investors Service, Inc. or Standard and Poor\'s
Corporation, respectively. The Payment Fund will not be used for any other
purpose, except as provided in this Agreement.

 

  (b) As soon as practicable, but in any
event no later than five Business Days following the Effective Time, the
Surviving Corporation will cause the Paying Agent to mail to each record
holder, as of the Effective Time, of an outstanding certificate or
certificates (the " _Certificates_ "), which immediately prior to the
Effective

     

 Time represented Shares (other than Shares owned by Parent or Acquisition
Sub or any of their respective Subsidiaries and Dissenting Shares), a letter
of transmittal in customary form (which will specify that delivery will
be effected, and risk of loss and title to the Certificates will pass, only
upon proper delivery of the Certificates or effective affidavits of loss in
lieu thereof to the Paying Agent) and instructions for use in effecting the
surrender of the Certificate and receiving payment therefor (together, the "
_LT_ "). In addition, immediately following the Effective Time, Parent or the
Surviving Corporation will cause the Paying Agent to have a location open in
New York City during regular business hours by which Certificates may be
exchanged for the Acquisition Price upon due presentation of Certificates and
a duly executed LT. Following surrender to the Paying Agent of a Certificate
or an effective affidavit of loss in lieu thereof, together with such LT duly
completed and executed, the holder of such Certificate will be paid in
exchange therefor cash in an amount (subject to any applicable withholding tax
as specified in _Section 3.7_ ) equal to the product of the number of Shares
represented by such Certificate multiplied by the Acquisition Price. No
interest will be paid or accrued on the cash payable upon the surrender of
the Certificate. If payment is to be made to a Person other than the Person in
whose name the Certificate surrendered is registered, it will be a condition
of payment that the Certificate so surrendered is properly endorsed or
otherwise in proper form for transfer and that the Person requesting such
payment pay any transfer or other taxes required by reason of the payment to a
Person other than the registered holder of the Certificate surrendered
or establish to the satisfaction of the Surviving Corporation that such tax
has been paid or is not applicable. From and after the Effective Time and
until surrendered in accordance with the provisions of this _Section 4.1_ ,
each Certificate will represent for all purposes solely the right to receive,
in accordance with the terms hereof, the Acquisition Price in cash multiplied
by the number of Shares evidenced by such Certificate, without any interest
or dividend thereon.

 

  (c) If any Certificate has been lost,
stolen or destroyed, upon the making of an affidavit of that fact by the
Person claiming such Certificate to be lost, stolen or destroyed and, if
required by the Surviving Corporation, the posting by such Person of a bond
in such reasonable amount as the Surviving Corporation may direct as indemnity
against any claim that may be made against it with respect to such
Certificate, the Paying Agent will deliver in exchange for such lost, stolen
or destroyed Certificate the applicable Acquisition Price with respect to the
Shares formerly represented thereby.

 

  (d) Any portion of the Payment Fund
(including the proceeds of any investments thereof) that remains unclaimed by
the former Company Shareholders one year after the Effective Time will be
repaid to the Surviving Corporation. Any former Company Shareholder will
thereafter look only to the Surviving Corporation (subject to abandoned
property, escheat or other similar Laws) but only as general creditors thereof
for payment of their claim for the Acquisition Price, without any interest or
dividends thereon. None of Parent, Acquisition Sub, Company, the Surviving
Corporation or the Paying Agent will be liable to any holder of Shares for any
monies delivered from the Payment Fund or otherwise to a public official
pursuant to any applicable abandoned property, escheat or similar Law. If any
Certificates have not

     

 been surrendered prior to six years after the Effective Time (or such
earlier date as will be immediately prior to the date that such unclaimed
funds would otherwise become subject to any abandoned property, escheat
or similar Law) unclaimed funds payable with respect to such Certificates
will, to the extent permitted by applicable Law, become the property of the
Surviving Corporation, free and clear of all claims or interest of any Person
previously entitled thereto.

 

  (e) In the event of a transfer of
ownership of Shares that is not registered in the transfer records of Company,
the consideration may be paid and issued with respect to such Shares to
a transferee of such Shares if the Certificate representing such Shares or an
effective affidavit of loss in lien thereof is presented to the Paying Agent,
accompanied by all documents reasonably required by the Paying Agent to
evidence and effect such transfer and to evidence that any applicable stock
transfer taxes relating to such transfer have been paid.

 

  (f) The Surviving Corporation or Parent
will bear and pay all charges and expenses, including those of the Paying
Agent, incurred in connection with the payment of Shares.

 

  4.2 _Closing of Company\'s Transfer Books_. No transfer
of Shares will be made in the stock transfer books of Company following the
Effective Time. If, following the Effective Time, Certificates are presented
to the Surviving Corporation for transfer, they will be cancelled and
exchanged for the Acquisition Price as provided in this Article IV, subject to
applicable Law in the case of Dissenting Shares.

 

  4.3 _Treatment of Options, Equity-Based Awards and
Deferred Compensation_. (a) Company will provide that, immediately prior
to the Purchase Date, each Company Option to purchase Shares granted under
the Company Option Plans that is outstanding and unexercised immediately prior
to the Purchase Date (whether vested or unvested), will be cancelled, and the
holder thereof will receive on the Purchase Date from Company, or as soon as
practicable thereafter from the Surviving Corporation, in consideration for
such cancellation and in full settlement of such Company Option, an amount in
cash equal to the product of (A) the number of Shares previously subject to
such Company Option and (B) the excess, if any, of the Acquisition Price over
the exercise price per Share previously subject to such Company Option, less
any required withholding Taxes.

 

  (b) On the Purchase Date, each
restricted Share granted under the Company Option Plans (collectively, the "
_Restricted Shares_ "), that is outstanding immediately prior to the Purchase
Date, will cease to represent a right or award with respect to Shares and will
be cancelled and of no further force and effect, and the holder thereof will
receive on the Purchase Date, or as soon as practicable thereafter from the
Surviving Corporation, in consideration for such cancellation, an amount in
cash equal to the product of (A) the number of Restricted Shares and (B) the
Acquisition Price, less any required withholding Taxes.

     

  (c) With respect to all deferred amounts
credited under the Amended and Restated Executive Savings Plan (the "
_Executive Savings Plan_ "), on the Purchase Date, Company will, or as soon as
practicable thereafter the Surviving Corporation will, terminate such plan and
make a cash lump sum payment in an amount equal to the amount credited to the
applicable participant\'s account under the Executive Savings Plan, less any
required withholding Taxes.

 

  (d) Notwithstanding the foregoing
provisions of this _Section 4.3_ , Company will terminate any and all equity-
based plans, programs arrangements or agreements maintained by Company or any
of its Subsidiaries, effective, in each case as of the Purchase Date,
immediately prior to the Effective Time. Company will provide Parent evidence
that such plans have been terminated pursuant to resolutions of Company Board
or the board of directors of its Subsidiaries, as applicable (the form and
substance of such resolutions will be subject to review and reasonable
approval of Parent)

or would, individually or in the aggregate, reasonably be expected to have a
Company Material Adverse Effect.

statements, certifications and other documents (including exhibits and all
other information incorporated by reference therein) required

     

 to be filed by Company since January 1, 2004 (the " _Company SEC Reports_
"). The Company SEC Reports (i) were prepared in all material respects in
accordance with the requirements of the Securities Act or the Exchange Act,
as the case may be, and (ii) did not at the time they were filed and will not,
when filed after the date of this Agreement, contain any untrue statement of a

or necessary in order to make the statements made therein, in the light of the
circumstances under which they were made, not misleading, except to the extent

material respects, the consolidated financial position and consolidated
results of operations and changes in cash flows of Company and its
Subsidiaries as of the respective dates thereof and for the respective
periods indicated therein, except as otherwise noted therein and subject, in
the case of unaudited statements, to normal year-end audit adjustments in

906 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 (" _Sarbanes-Oxley Act_ ") and any
related rules and regulations promulgated by the SEC and the NYSE, and the
statements contained in any such certifications are complete and correct. For
purposes of this Agreement, "principal executive officer" and "principal
financial officer" will have the meanings given to such terms in the Sarbanes-
Oxley Act. Except as permitted by the Exchange Act, including Sections
13(k)(2) and (3) or rules of the SEC, since the enactment of the Sarbanes-
Oxley Act, neither Company nor any of its affiliates (as such term is defined
in Rule 405 promulgated under the Securities Act) has made, arranged or
modified (in any material way) any extensions of credit in the form of a
personal loan to any executive officer or director of Company. In addition,

 

 

 (i) Company and its Subsidiaries maintain internal control over financial reporting (as defined in Rule 13a-15 or 15d-15, as applicable, under the Exchange Act). Company assessed the effectiveness of Company\'s internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2006; provided, however, that the assessment excluded an assessment of internal controls of OMI Crewing Services Ltd. and Orinoco Maritime Consultancy India Pvt. Ltd., which were acquired effective as of July 13, 2006 and September 7, 2006, respectively, and whose financial statements reflect total assets and net sales aggregating 1% and 1%, respectively, of the related consolidated financial statement amounts as of and for the year ended December 31, 2006.

those criteria, we concluded that our internal control over financial

Company.

Effect.

 

  (b) Each of Company and its Subsidiaries
holds, to the extent legally required, all Permits that are required for the
lawful operation of its business as now conducted, except where the
failure to hold any such Permit would not, individually or in the aggregate,

default that would not, individually or in the aggregate, reasonably be
expected to have a Company Material Adverse Effect.

Arrangements_. Company will not, and will cause its Subsidiaries not to,
materially amend, terminate or waive rights in respect of any Material
Contract or enter into any Contract that, had it been entered into prior to or

will cause its Subsidiaries not to, (i) purchase or construct any vessel or
enter into any Contract for the purchase or construction of any vessel, (ii)
sell or otherwise dispose of any Vessel or enter into any Contract for the

consent of Parent (which consent will not be unreasonably withheld), (iv)
defer scheduled maintenance of any Vessel, (v) depart from any normal drydock

case of this clause (v), such work cannot prudently be deferred and is

agree, in writing or otherwise, to take any of the foregoing actions.

 

  (l) _No Related Actions_. Company will
not, and will not permit any of its Subsidiaries to, agree or commit to do any

  7.2 _Efforts to Close_. (a) Each of Parent, Acquisition
Sub and their Subsidiaries on the one hand, and Company and its Subsidiaries
on the other, will use its commercially reasonable efforts to cause all of the
conditions, as specified in Article VIII, to the obligations of the other
party to consummate the Transactions to be met as

     

 soon as practicable after the date of this Agreement. Each of Parent,
Acquisition Sub and Company and their respective Subsidiaries will use its
commercially reasonable efforts to obtain, as soon as practicable,
the Authorizations and third-party consents that may be or become necessary
for the performance of its respective obligations under this Agreement and the
consummation of the Transactions, and will cooperate with each other in
promptly seeking to obtain such Authorizations and third-party consents.

 

  (b) Company, Parent and Acquisition Sub
will each use its commercially reasonable efforts to cooperate to obtain any
government clearances or approvals required for Closing under the HSR Act
and any and all other applicable Antitrust Laws (" _Antitrust Clearance_ "),
to respond to any government requests for information under any Antitrust Law,
and to contest and resist any action, including any legislative,
administrative or judicial action, and to have vacated, lifted, reversed or
overturned any decree, judgment, injunction or other order (whether temporary,
preliminary or permanent) (an " _Antitrust Order_ ") that restricts, prevents
or prohibits the consummation of the Transactions under any Antitrust Law,
provided that any such action would not, in the commercially
reasonable judgment of Parent, reasonably be expected to materially impair or
materially reduce the value of the on-going business operations of Company and
its Subsidiaries or the overall benefits expected, as of the date hereof, to
be realized by Parent from the consummation of the Merger. The parties hereto
will consult and cooperate with one another, and consider in good faith the
views of one another, in connection with, and provide to the other parties in
advance, any analyses, appearances, presentations, memoranda, briefs,
arguments, opinions and proposals made or submitted by or on behalf of any
party hereto in connection with proceedings under or relating to any Antitrust
Law.

 

  (c) Parent and Acquisition Sub will
propose, negotiate, offer to commit and effect (and if such offer is accepted,
commit to and effect), by consent decree, hold separate order or otherwise,
the sale, divestiture or disposition of such assets or businesses of Parent
or, effective as of the Effective Time, the Surviving Corporation, or their
respective Subsidiaries, or otherwise offer to take or offer to commit to take
any action which it is capable of taking and if the offer is accepted, take
or commit to take such action that limits its freedom of action with respect
to, or its ability to retain, any of the businesses, services or assets of
Parent, the Surviving Corporation or their respective Subsidiaries, in order
to avoid the entry of, or to effect the dissolution of, any Antitrust Order,
which would have the effect of preventing or delaying the Purchase Date beyond
the Expiration Date, _provided_ that any such action would not, in the
commercially reasonable judgment of Parent, reasonably be expected to
materially impair or materially reduce the value of the on-going
business operations of Company and its Subsidiaries or the overall benefits
expected, as of the date hereof, to be realized by Parent from the
consummation of the Merger.

 

  7.3 _Confidentiality_. Prior to the Purchase Date, each
of Parent, Acquisition Sub and Company will, and will cause each of their
respective Subsidiaries to comply with, all of their respective obligations
under the Confidentiality Agreement with respect to any information obtained
by any such Person in connection with this Agreement and the Transactions.

     

  7.4 _Actions Regarding Anti-Takeover Statutes_. If the
provisions of any potentially applicable anti-takeover or similar statute are
or become applicable to the Transactions or Parent, Acquisition Sub or any of
their Affiliates, the Company Board will grant such approvals and endeavor to
take such other actions to the extent permitted by applicable Law as may be
required so that the Transactions may be consummated as promptly as
practicable on the terms and conditions set forth in this Agreement.

 

  7.5 _Access_. (a) From the date hereof to the Purchase
Date, Company will allow all designated officers, attorneys, accountants and
other representatives of Parent or Acquisition Sub access at reasonable times
upon reasonable notice and in a manner as will not unduly impact the conduct
of the business of Company to the personnel, representatives, books, records,
files, correspondence, audits and properties of Company (including, to the
extent permitted by the Company\'s independent auditors, following the
Company\'s commercially reasonable efforts to cause such permission to be
granted, work papers of the Company\'s independent auditors) and Company will
furnish to Parent or representatives of Parent such financial and operating
data and other information as such Persons may reasonably request, as well as
to all information relating to commitments, contracts, titles and financial
position, or otherwise pertaining to the business and affairs, of Company
including inspection of such properties; _provided_ that Company may restrict
the foregoing access to the extent that (i) any applicable Law requires
Company to restrict or prohibit access to any such properties or information,
(ii) such disclosure would, based on the advice of outside counsel, violate
any agreement to which Company or any of its Subsidiaries is a party, or
result in a waiver of attorney-client privilege. Company will use commercially
reasonable efforts to make substitute disclosure arrangements under
circumstances in which the restrictions of the preceding sentence apply.

 

  (b) No investigation pursuant to this
_Section 7.5_ will affect any representation or warranty given by any party
hereunder, and, notwithstanding the provision of information or investigation
by any party, no party will be deemed to make any representation or warranty
except as expressly set forth in this Agreement. Prior to the Purchase Date,
each of Parent and Acquisition Sub agrees that it will not, and will cause
its respective representatives not to, use any information obtained pursuant
to this _Section 7.5_ for any purpose unrelated to the consummation of the
Transactions. All information provided by a party to the other party hereunder
will be subject to the confidentiality provisions of _Section 7.3_. 

 

  7.6 _Public Announcements_. Prior to the Effective Time,
Parent, Acquisition Sub and Company will consult with each other
before issuing any press releases or otherwise making any public statements
with respect to this Agreement or the Transactions, and none of them will
issue any such press release or make any such public statement or
communication without the prior approval of the other, except as any party
may determine in good faith is required by Law or by obligations pursuant to
any listing agreement with any national securities market or exchange.

     

  7.7 _No Solicitation_. (a) Company will, and will cause
its Subsidiaries and representatives to, immediately cease, terminate and
discontinue any and all existing activities, discussions or negotiations with
any Person (other than Parent, Acquisition Sub and their respective
representatives) conducted before the date of this Agreement with respect to
any Company Acquisition Proposal. Company will promptly, following the
execution of this Agreement, request the return or destruction (as provided in
the applicable agreement) of all confidential information provided by or on
behalf of Company to all Persons who have had such discussions or
negotiations or who have entered into confidentiality agreements with Company
pertaining to any Company Acquisition Proposal and to otherwise enforce its
rights under such confidentiality agreements.

 

  (b) Prior to the Effective Time, Company
will not, and will cause its Affiliates and representatives not to, directly
or indirectly solicit, initiate or knowingly take any action to facilitate
or encourage the submission of any Company Acquisition Proposal or any
proposals that would reasonably be expected to lead to any Company Acquisition
Proposal, or, subject to _Section 7.7(e)_ , (i) discuss or negotiate with,
disclose any information to, afford access to the business, properties,
assets, books, data or records of Company or any of its Subsidiaries, or
otherwise cooperate in any way with, or knowingly assist, participate in,
facilitate or encourage any effort by any Person (other than Parent,
Acquisition Sub and their respective representatives) that is seeking to make,
or has made, any Company Acquisition Proposal, (ii)(A) amend or grant
any waiver or release under any standstill or similar agreement with respect
to any class of equity securities of Company or any of its Subsidiaries, (B)
approve any transaction pursuant to which any Person (other than Parent,
Acquisition Sub or their respective Affiliates) would become a Related Person
(as such term is defined in the articles of incorporation of Company), or (C)
amend or grant any waiver or release from or redeem any Rights under the
Rights Agreement, except in connection with the Transactions, or (iii) enter
into any agreement in principle, letter of intent, term sheet, acquisition
agreement, merger agreement, option agreement, joint venture agreement,
partnership agreement or other Contract (other than a
confidentiality agreement permitted to be entered into in accordance with
_Section 7.7(e)_ ) relating to any Company Acquisition Proposal.

 

  (c) Unless and until this Agreement has
been terminated in accordance with _Section 9.1_ and except as expressly
permitted by  _Sections 7.7(e)_ and _7.7(g)_ , neither the Company Board nor
any committee thereof will (i) fail to make, withdraw or modify or propose
(to any Person other than Parent or Parent\'s Affiliates or representatives)
to withdraw or modify in a manner adverse to Parent or Acquisition Sub, the
Company Board Recommendation (it being understood that recommending
or declaring advisable (publicly or otherwise), or taking a neutral position
or no position, with respect to any Company Acquisition Proposal will be
considered an adverse modification), (ii) fail to publicly reaffirm the
Company Board Recommendation, the Agreement or the Merger or fail to reaffirm
its determination that the Offer, this Agreement, the Merger and the
Transactions are in the best interest of Company and the Company Shareholders,
within ten Business Days following Parent\'s written request to do so, (iii)
fail to recommend against acceptance of any tender offer or exchange

     

 offer (other than the Offer) for the Shares within 10 Business Days after
the commencement of such offer, (iv) enter into any letter of intent,
agreement in principle, acquisition agreement or other agreement (other than
a confidentiality agreement with a Person making a Company Acquisition
Proposal pursuant to _Section 7.7(e_ )), related to any Company Acquisition
Proposal or (v) resolve or agree to take any of the foregoing actions (any of
the foregoing, an " _Adverse Recommendation Change_ ").

 

  (d) Company will promptly notify Parent
of its or any of its officers\', directors\' or representatives\' receipt of
any inquiry or proposal relating to, a Company Acquisition Proposal.

 

  (e) Notwithstanding anything in this
Agreement to the contrary, prior to the Purchase Date, Company or the Company
Board will be permitted to (i) provide any information to, and afford access
to its business, properties, assets, books, data and records to, any Person
in response to an unsolicited Company Acquisition Proposal by such Person
(that has not been withdrawn) if the Company Board has received from such
Person an executed confidentiality agreement containing terms no less
favorable to Company than those contained in the Confidentiality Agreement and
containing additional provisions that expressly permit Company to comply with
the terms of this _Section 7.7_ (a copy of which confidentiality agreement
shall be promptly (and in any event within 48 hours) provided to Parent), (ii)
engage in any discussions or negotiations with any Person in response to an
unsolicited Company Acquisition Proposal by any such Person (that has not been
withdrawn), or (iii) make or propose to make any Adverse Recommendation
Change, if and only to the extent that such Company Acquisition Proposal did
not result from a breach of this _Section 7.7_ and, the Company Board
determines, after consultation with outside counsel, failure to take such
action would violate the fiduciary duties of the members of the Company Board
under applicable Law and the Company Board has determined in good faith after
consultation with its outside legal counsel and its financial advisors that
such Company Acquisition Proposal (I) constitutes or (II) would reasonably be
expected to constitute a Company Superior Proposal, provided that in such case
referred to in clause (iii) above (x) such Company Acquisition Proposal is a
Company Superior Proposal and (y) Parent shall have received the
Superior Proposal Notice (as defined below).

 

  (f) The Company Board will not take any
of the actions referred to in _Section 7.7(e)(iii)_ unless Company has
delivered to Parent a prior written notice advising Parent that it intends to
take such action. Company will notify Parent promptly (but in no event later
than 48 hours) after receipt by Company or any of its Subsidiaries (or any of
their respective representatives) of any Company Acquisition Proposal or any
inquiry that the Company Board determines in good faith would reasonably be
expected to lead to a Company Acquisition Proposal, any request for non-public
information relating to Company or any of its Subsidiaries or for access to
the business, properties, assets, books or records of Company or any of its
Subsidiaries by any third party that is seeking to make, or has made after the
date hereof, a Company Acquisition Proposal. Company will provide such notice
orally and in writing and will identify the third party making, and the
material terms and conditions of, any such Company Acquisition Proposal,
indication or request. Company will keep Parent regularly informed, as 

     

 promptly as practicable, of the status and terms, in reasonable detail, of
any such Company Acquisition Proposal. Company will provide Parent with at
least 48 hours prior notice of any meeting of the Company Board (or
such lesser notice as is provided to the members of the Company Board) at
which the Company Board is reasonably expected to consider any Company
Acquisition Proposal and will provide Parent with written notice (the "
_Superior Proposal Notice_ ") of its intention to take action referred to in
_Section 7.7(e)(iii)_ , which notice shall describe in reasonable detail and
include any draft agreements pertaining to such Company Superior Proposal, at
least four Business Days prior to accepting any Company Superior Proposal
(such four-Business Day period being the " _Waiting Period_ "). Company will
also promptly provide Parent with any material information concerning the
Company\'s business, present or future performance, financial condition or
results of operations or otherwise, provided to any third party that was not
previously provided to Parent.

 

  (g) Nothing contained in this _Section
7.7_ will prohibit Company or the Company Board from taking and disclosing to
the Company Shareholders a position with respect to a tender offer by a third
party pursuant to Rules 14d-9 and 14e-2(a) promulgated under the Exchange Act
or making or authorizing Company to make any other public disclosure if the
Company Board determines, after consultation with outside counsel, that
failure to do so would violate the fiduciary duties or other obligations under
applicable Law.

 

  7.8 _Notification of Certain Matters_. Each of Parent
and Acquisition Sub, on the one hand, and Company, on the other hand,
will give prompt written notice to the other of (a) any notice or other
communication from any Person alleging that the consent of such Person is or
may be required in connection with the Transactions, (b) any Action commenced
or threatened in writing against, relating to or involving or otherwise
affecting it or any of its Subsidiaries that relates to the consummation of
the Transactions, and (c) any change that, individually or in the aggregate,
would reasonably be expected to have a Parent Material Adverse Effect, an
Acquisition Sub Material Adverse Effect or a Company Material Adverse Effect,
as the case may be.

 

  7.9 _Fees and Expenses_. Except as otherwise provided
herein, Company will bear all of the Expenses of Company and its Affiliates,
including the broker\'s or finder\'s fees referred to in _Section 5.21_ , and

Acquisition Sub and their Affiliates, including the broker\'s or finder\'s
fees referred to in _Section 6.8_.

Insurance_. (a) Parent will, to the fullest extent permitted by Law,
cause the Surviving Corporation to honor all of Company\'s obligations to
indemnify the current or former directors or officers of Company for acts or
omissions by such directors and officers occurring prior to the Purchase Date
to the extent that such obligations of Company exist on the date of this
Agreement, whether pursuant to Company\'s articles of incorporation or bylaws
or individual indemnity agreements, and such obligations will survive the
Merger and will continue in full force and effect in accordance with their
current terms from the Purchase

     

 Date until the expiration of the applicable statute of limitations with
respect to any claims against such directors or officers arising out of such
acts or omissions.

 

  (b) The Surviving Corporation will (i)
maintain in effect for a period of six years after the Purchase Date, if
available, the current policies of directors\' and officers\' liability
insurance maintained by Company (provided that the Surviving Corporation may
substitute therefor policies of at least the same coverage and amounts
containing terms and conditions which are not less advantageous to the
directors and officers of Company) (the " _Insured Parties_ ")) or (ii)
obtain as of the Purchase Date "tail" insurance policies with a claims period
of six years from the Purchase Date with at least the same coverage
and amounts and containing terms and conditions which are no less
advantageous to the directors and officers of Company, in each case, with
respect to claims arising out of or relating to events which occurred before
or at the Purchase Date;  _provided_ , _however_ , that in no event will the
Surviving Corporation be required to expend an annual premium for such
coverage in excess of 300% of the last annual premium paid by Company for such
insurance prior to the date of this Agreement (the " _Maximum Premium_ "). If
such insurance coverage cannot be obtained at all, or can only be obtained at
an annual premium in excess of the Maximum Premium, the Surviving Corporation
will obtain that amount of directors\' and officers\' insurance (or "tail"
coverage) obtainable for an annual premium equal to the Maximum Premium.

 

  (c) The provisions of this _Section
7.10_ will survive the Closing and are intended to be for the benefit of, and
will be enforceable by, each Insured Party and its successors and
representatives after the Purchase Date and their rights under this _Section
7.10_ are in addition to, and will not be deemed to be exclusive of, any
other rights to which an Insured Party is entitled, whether pursuant to Law,
Contract or otherwise.

 

  (d) The obligations under this _Section
7.10_ may not be terminated or modified by the Surviving Corporation in a
manner as to adversely affect any Insured Party to whom this _Section 7.10_
applies without the consent of the affected Insured Party, _provided_ ,
_however_ , that "tail" coverage is obtained to fulfill all such obligations
of the Surviving Corporation as set forth above. In the event that the
Surviving Corporation or any of their respective successors or assigns (i)
consolidates with or merges into any other Persons or (ii) transfers 50% or
more of its properties or assets to any Person, then and in each case, proper
provision will be made so that the applicable successors, assigns or
transferees assume the obligations set forth in this _Section 7.10_.

 

  7.11 _NYSE Quotation_. Company will use commercially
reasonable efforts to continue the listing of the Shares on NYSE during
the term of this Agreement.

 

  7.12 _Employee Matters_. Parent will take any actions
necessary to effectuate the provisions, covenants and agreements set forth in
_Section 7.12(a)_ of the Company Disclosure Schedule. The Surviving
Corporation will take any actions necessary to effectuate the other
provisions, covenants and agreements set forth in _Section 7.12_ of the
Company Disclosure Schedule.

     

  7.13 _Notes Tender Offer_. Following the commencement of
the Offer, at Parent\'s sole cost and expense (and if such costs and expenses
are first paid by Company, Parent or Acquisition Sub shall promptly reimburse
Company for such costs and expenses upon request), Parent or Acquisition Sub
may commence a cash tender offer to purchase all of Company\'s outstanding
7.625% Senior Notes due 2013 (the " _2013 Notes_ ") and/or all of Company\'s
2.875% Convertible Notes due 2024 (the " _2024 Notes_ ") (such tender offers,
respectively, the " _2013 Notes Tender Offer_ " and the " _2024_ _Notes Tender
Offer_ "). Company will, at the request of Parent or Acquisition Sub, defease
pursuant to Article XIII of the indenture under which the 2013 Notes were
issued, dated as of November 26, 2003, all 2013 Notes not tendered pursuant to
the 2013 Notes Tender Offer (or in the event that the 2013 Notes Tender Offer
is not commenced) with funds made available from Parent or Acquisition Sub.
Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the contrary, Company,
Acquisition Sub or Parent, as applicable, will not be required to accept for
payment or pay for any 2013 Notes or any 2024 Notes tendered pursuant to
the 2013 Notes Tender Offer or, as the case may be, the 2024 Notes Tender
Offer or defease any of the 2013 Notes prior to the consummation of the Offer.

 

  7.14 _Financing-Related Cooperation_. Company will, at
Parent\'s sole cost and expense, use commercially reasonable efforts
to assist Parent and Acquisition Sub in seeking any consents of the lenders
under the Existing Senior Credit Facilities that may be required in order to
avoid the occurrence of any event of default under, or other acceleration of

timely file, all Tax Returns of the Company that are due on or after
the Closing Date of the Transactions and pay all Taxes which are due on or

9.1_ , prior to the Purchase Date:

 

  (a) by mutual written consent of Parent
and Company (without the joinder of Acquisition Sub);

     

  (b) by Parent, Acquisition Sub or

occurred, (ii) any Order preventing or prohibiting consummation of the
Transactions has become final and nonappealable, or (iii) the Purchase Date
has not occurred on or before October 31, 2007, unless the failure of the
Purchase Date to occur on or prior to such date is the result of a willful and
material breach of this Agreement by the party seeking to terminate this
Agreement;

 

  (c) by Company (i) if prior to the
Purchase Date, Parent or Acquisition Sub breaches any representation, warranty
or covenant contained in this Agreement that is not curable or, if curable,
is not cured within twenty calendar days after written notice of such breach
is given by Company to the party committing such breach or (ii) if, prior to
the Purchase Date, subject to complying with the terms of this Agreement, (A)
the Company Board has received a Company Acquisition Proposal that
constitutes a Company Superior Proposal that did not result from a breach of
this Agreement, (B) Company has notified Parent in writing of its intention to
terminate this Agreement pursuant to this  _Section 9.1(c)(ii)_ and included
with such notice the most current written agreement relating to the
transaction that constitutes such Company Superior Proposal and has
otherwise complied with _Section 7.7(f)_ , (C) at least four Business Days
have elapsed following receipt by Parent of the notice referred to in clause
(B) above, the Company Board nonetheless determines in good faith after
consultation with its outside legal counsel and a financial advisor, that such
Company Acquisition Proposal continues to constitute a Company Superior
Proposal, (D) on the date of such termination, Company enters into a

written notice of such breach is given by either Parent or Acquisition Sub to
Company, (ii) prior to the Purchase Date, Company fails to perform any of its
obligations under, or otherwise breaches, _Section 7.7(b)_ or _(e)_ in any
respect or _Section_ _7.7(a), (d), (f)_ or _(g)_ , in any material
respect, or (iii) prior to the Purchase Date, subject to complying with the
terms of this Agreement, the Company Board has made an Adverse Recommendation
Change.

 

  9.2 _Effect of Termination_. In the event of termination
of this Agreement by Parent, Acquisition Sub or Company pursuant to  _Section
9.1_ , this Agreement will forthwith become void and there will be no
liability under this Agreement on the part of Parent, Acquisition Sub or
Company, except to the extent that such termination results from the willful
and material breach by a party of any of its representations, warranties or
covenants in this Agreement; _provided_ , _however_ , that the provisions of
_Sections 7.3_ , _7.9_ ,  _7.10_ , this _Article IX_ and _Article X_
will each remain in full force and effect and will survive any termination of
this Agreement.

 

  9.3 _Fees and Expenses_. (a) Notwithstanding _Section
7.9_ , in the event this Agreement is (i) terminated (A) by Company pursuant
to _Section 9.1(c)(ii)_ or (B) by

     

 Parent pursuant to _Section 9.1(d)(ii)_ and, prior to such termination
pursuant to Section 9.1(d)(ii), a Company Acquisition Proposal shall have been
made (publicly or otherwise) after the date of this Agreement by any person
other than Parent, or Parent\'s Affiliates or representatives or _Section
9.1(d)(iii)_ , then in any such event Company will pay to Parent a
termination fee of $65,000,000 in cash (the " _Termination Fee_ "); (ii)
terminated by (A) Parent pursuant to _Section 9.1(d)(i)_ and the Minimum
Tender Condition and/or any of the conditions set forth in _Section 1.9(a)(v)_
or _(vi)_ of _Exhibit A_ were not satisfied at such time (provided such
failure to satisfy was not due to willful and material breach of this
Agreement by any action or inaction of Parent), then in any such event Company
will pay to Parent all of the Termination Expenses (as hereinafter defined) of
Parent and Acquisition Sub or (B) Parent or Company pursuant to _Section
9.1(b)(i)_ or _Section_ _9.1(b)(iii)_ and either (x) the conditions set forth
in _Section 1.9(a)(v)_ or _(vi)_ of _Exhibit A_ were not satisfied or (y) the
Minimum Tender Condition was not satisfied at a time when, in either such
case, neither Parent nor Acquisition Sub were in breach of the Agreement and
the Antitrust Clearance had been obtained or Company was not entitled to
receive the fee set forth in Section 9.3(b) under the circumstances set forth
therein , then in any such event Company will pay to Parent all of the
Termination Expenses of Parent and Acquisition Sub ; or (iii)(A) terminated
under the same circumstances as set forth in clause (ii) above, (B) prior to
the event giving rise to such termination, a Company Acquisition Proposal
shall have been made (either publicly or otherwise) after the date of
this Agreement by any Person other than Parent or Parent\'s Affiliates or
representatives and not withdrawn, and (C) within 12 months after the date of
such termination, a Company Acquisition Proposal (whether or not with the
party making such Company Acquisition Proposal) shall have been consummated
or Company has entered into a definitive agreement with respect to a Company
Acquisition Proposal, then Company will pay to Parent the Termination Fee less
the amount of Termination Expenses paid pursuant to _Section 9.3(a)(ii)_. As
used herein, " _Termination Expenses_ " will mean up to $6,500,000
of reasonable, out-of-pocket, documented, third-party fees and expenses
(including fees and expenses of counsel, accountants, consultants, financial
advisors, lenders and investment bankers of Parent and its Affiliates),
incurred by Parent and Acquisition Sub, on an aggregate basis, or on their
behalf in connection with or related to the authorization, preparation,
negotiation, execution and performance of this Agreement and the Transaction
(including the Merger and the Offer). Any payments due under _Section
9.3(a)(i)(A)_ will be paid to Parent by wire transfer of same-day funds
simultaneously with Company\'s termination of this Agreement. Any payments
due under _Section 9.3(a)(i)(B)_ or _Section 9.3(a)(ii)(A)_ will be paid to
Parent within two Business Days after termination of the Agreement. Any
payments due under _Section 9.3(a)(ii)(B)_ will be paid to Company within two
Business Days after termination of the Agreement. Any payments due under
_Section 9.3(a)(iii)_ will be paid to Parent by wire transfer of same-day
funds within two Business Days after the date on which the transaction
referenced in clause (C) of  _Section 9.3(a)(iii)_ is consummated.

 

  (b) Notwithstanding _Section 7.9_ , in
the event (i) this Agreement is terminated by either party pursuant to
_Section 9.1(b)(i)_ or _Section 9.1(b)(iii)_ , (ii) as of the date of such
termination, the Antitrust Clearance shall not have occurred or any Order
relating to any antitrust Law that prevents, prohibits or delays the
consummation of the Transactions exists or is in effect, (iii) Company has
performed in all material respects

     

 the obligations, and complied in all material respects with the agreements
and covenants, required to be performed by or complied with by it under this
Agreement prior to such termination, and (iv) the conditions set forth in 
_Section 1.9(a)(iii)-(ix)_ of _Exhibit A_ were satisfied, then Parent will pay
to Company a termination fee of $65,000,000 in cash no later than the first
Business Day following such termination.

 

  (c) Each of the parties acknowledges
that the agreements contained in _Section 9.3_ are an integral part of the
Transactions, that without these agreements, the other party would not enter
into this Agreement and that any fee payable under this _Section 9.3_ is not a
penalty, but rather is liquidated damages in a reasonable amount that will
compensate the other party for the efforts and resources expended and
opportunities foregone while negotiating this Agreement and in reliance on
this Agreement and on the expectation of the consummation of the
Transactions, which amount would otherwise be impossible to calculate with
precision. Upon making such payments, no party will have further liabilities
or obligations to the other party, regardless of the circumstances relating
thereto. 

 

 X. MISCELLANEOUS

 

  10.1 _Nonsurvival of Representations, Warranties and
Covenants_. Except for the covenants set forth in _Sections 7.3_ , _7.9_ ,

Law, this Agreement may be amended, modified, or supplemented only by the

  10.3 _Waiver of Compliance_. Except as otherwise provided
in this Agreement, the failure by any Person to comply with any obligation,
covenant or condition under this Agreement may be waived by the Person
entitled to the benefit thereof only by a written instrument signed by the
Person granting such waiver, but such waiver or failure to insist upon strict
compliance with such obligation, covenant, agreement or condition will not
operate as a waiver of, or estoppel with respect to, any subsequent or other
failure. The failure of any Person to enforce at any time any of the
provisions of this Agreement will in no way be construed to be a waiver of
any such provision, nor in any way to affect the validity of this Agreement or
any part hereof or the right of any Person thereafter to enforce each and
every such provision. No waiver of any breach of such provisions will be held
to be a waiver of any other or subsequent breach.

  10.5 _Third-Party Beneficiaries_. Except as specifically

implied, is intended to confer on any Person other than the parties hereto or

  10.6 _Successors and Assigns_. This Agreement will be
binding upon and will inure to the benefit of the signatories hereto
and their respective successors and permitted assigns. None of Parent,
Acquisition Sub or Company may assign this Agreement or any of their rights or
liabilities hereunder without the prior written consent of the other parties
hereto, and any attempt to make any such assignment without such consent will
be null and void; _provided_ , _however_ , that (i) either Parent may assign
all of its rights and liabilities under this Agreement to the other Parent
without the prior written consent of Company, (ii) either Parent may assign
all of its rights and liabilities under this Agreement to any of its
Subsidiaries without the prior written consent of Company and (iii)
Acquisition Sub may assign all of its rights and liabilities under this

relieve the party making the assignment from any liability under this
Agreement, and any such assignment by Acquisition Sub will not affect any of
the obligations of either Parent hereunder.

 

  10.7 _Severability_. The illegality or partial illegality
of any or all of this Agreement, or any provision hereof, will not affect the
validity of the remainder of this Agreement, or any provision hereof, and the
illegality or partial illegality of this Agreement will not affect its
validity in any jurisdiction in which such determination of illegality or
partial illegality has not been made, except to the extent such illegality or

material provisions reasonably expected by the parties to be contained herein.

 

  10.8 _Governing Law_. This Agreement will be governed by
and construed in accordance with the internal Laws of the State of New York
applicable to Contracts made and wholly performed within such state, without

Company, Parent and Acquisition Sub hereby irrevocably submits with regard to
any such Action or proceeding for itself and in respect to its property,

and agrees not to assert, by way of motion, as a defense, counterclaim or
otherwise, in any Action with respect to this Agreement, the Transactions, any
provision hereof or the breach, performance, enforcement, validity or
invalidity hereof, (a) any claim that it is not personally subject to
the jurisdiction of the above-named courts for any reason other than the
failure to lawfully serve process, (b) that it or its property is exempt or
immune from jurisdiction of any such court or from any legal process commenced
in such courts (whether through service of notice, attachment prior to
judgment, attachment in aid of execution of judgment, execution of judgment or
otherwise), and (c) to the fullest extent permitted by applicable Laws, that
(i) Action in any such court is brought in an inconvenient forum, (ii) the
venue of such Action is improper and (iii) this Agreement, or the subject
matter hereof, may not be enforced in or by such courts.

 

  10.10 _Counterparts_. This Agreement may be executed in two

of the parties and delivered to the other parties, it being understood that
each party need not sign the same counterpart.

     

  10.11 _Entire Agreement_. This Agreement (including the
documents and the instruments referred to in this Agreement), together with

will be completed and for the other purposes expressly provided herein and
therein. Parent will ensure that each of Acquisition Sub and the Surviving

  _EXHIBIT A_

 



 

 THE ACQUISITION

 

  1.1 _The Offer_. (a) (i) On the terms and subject to the
conditions set forth in the Agreement and provided that the Agreement shall
not have been terminated in accordance with _Article IX_ thereof, as soon as
practicable (and in any event within ten calendar days) after the date of the
Agreement (unless the parties otherwise agree in writing), Parent will cause
Acquisition Sub to commence (within the meaning of Rule 14d-2 under the
Exchange Act) the Offer. The obligations of Acquisition Sub to promptly accept
for payment and to pay promptly for any Shares tendered pursuant to the Offer
will be subject to only those conditions (the " _Offer Conditions_ ") set
forth in _Sections 1.8_ and _1.9_ of this _Exhibit A_. The initial expiration
date of the Offer will be the twentieth Business Day following the
commencement of the Offer. Acquisition Sub may at any time or from time to
time in its sole discretion waive any Offer Condition or modify or amend the
terms of the Offer, except that, without the prior written consent
of Company, Acquisition Sub will not (A) decrease the Acquisition Price or
change the form of the consideration payable in the Offer, (B) amend or waive
the Minimum Tender Condition, (C) impose conditions in addition to those set
forth in this  _Exhibit A_ or modify the conditions set forth in this
_Exhibit A_ in a manner adverse to Company Shareholders, or (D) make any
other change in the terms or conditions of the Offer that is adverse to the
Company Shareholders.

 

  (ii) Subject to the terms and conditions
of the Agreement and to the satisfaction or waiver of the Offer Conditions as
of any scheduled expiration of the Offer, Acquisition Sub will accept
for payment and pay for Shares validly tendered and not withdrawn pursuant to
the Offer as soon as practicable after such scheduled expiration. Acquisition
Sub may, without the consent of Company, and will, if requested by Company,
(A) extend the Offer for one or more periods of time up to ten Business Days
per extension if at any scheduled expiration of the Offer any of the Offer
Conditions is not satisfied or waived, except that Acquisition Sub will not be
required to extend the Offer more than once (except in accordance with the
next sentence) if the only unsatisfied condition is the Minimum Tender
Condition, (B) extend the Offer for any period required by any rule,
regulation, interpretation or position of the SEC or the staff thereof or the
NYSE applicable to the Offer, or (C) elect to provide a subsequent offering
period for the Offer in accordance with Rule 14d-11 under the Exchange Act. So
long as the Offer and the Agreement have not been terminated pursuant to
_Article IX_ of the Agreement (1) if, as of any Expiration Date, all of the
Offer Conditions (other than the Minimum Tender Condition) have been satisfied
or waived by Acquisition Sub, but the Minimum Tender Condition is not
satisfied, Acquisition Sub will extend the Offer for a period of five Business
Days, in order to permit the satisfaction of the Offer Conditions; _provided_
, that if at the end of such five Business Day period, all of the Offer
Conditions (other than the Minimum Tender Condition) are satisfied, but the
Minimum Tender Condition is not satisfied, Acquisition Sub will not be
required to make further

     

 extension pursuant to this clause (1), and (2) if, as of any Expiration
Date, the Offer Conditions set forth in paragraphs (v) or (vi) of _Section
1.9(a)_ of this _Exhibit A_ (each, an " _Absence of Breach Condition_ ") are
not satisfied and have not been waived, then upon written request by Company
delivered on or prior to such Expiration Date, to the extent that Company is
entitled pursuant to _Section 9.1(d)(i)_ of the Agreement to attempt to
cure such breach of its representations and warranties, or failure to comply
with any of its covenants, contained in the Agreement, and the cure of such
breach or failure would result in the satisfaction of the Absence of Breach
Condition, Acquisition Sub will extend the Offer until the date of the
expiration of such cure period, or such earlier date as specified by Company
in its request, _provided_ that if at the end of such expiration date such
breach has not been cured, Acquisition Sub shall not be required to make any
further extension. Subject to the proviso in clause (1) above, the foregoing
rights of Company to cause an extension of the Offer are cumulative so that
if at any time, either of the foregoing is applicable, the Offer will be so
extended further. In addition, in the event that fewer than 90% of the total
number of outstanding Shares have been validly tendered and not withdrawn on
the Expiration Date, Acquisition Sub will, if requested by Company, make
available a subsequent offering period in accordance with Rule 14d-11 of the
Exchange Act for a period of time determined by Acquisition Sub, but not less
than five Business Days. The Acquisition Price may be increased and the Offer
may be extended to the extent required by Law in connection with such increase
in each case without the consent of Company. Notwithstanding the foregoing,
Acquisition Sub may, but will not be required to, extend the Offer beyond
October 31, 2007.

 

  (b) On the date of commencement of the
Offer, Parent and Acquisition Sub will file or caused to be filed with the SEC
a Tender Offer Statement on Schedule TO (together with all amendments
and supplements thereto, " _Schedule TO_ ") with respect to the Offer that
will contain the offer to purchase and related LT and summary advertisement
and other ancillary Offer documents and instruments pursuant to which the
Offer will be made (collectively with any supplements or amendments thereto, "
_Offer Documents_ "). Each of Parent and Acquisition Sub agrees (i) to
provide Company with, and to consult with Company regarding, any comments that
may be received from the SEC or its staff with respect to the Offer Documents
promptly upon receipt thereof and prior to responding thereto and (ii) to
provide Company with any comments or responses thereto. Each of Parent,
Acquisition Sub and Company agrees to promptly correct any information
provided by it for use in the Offer Documents if and to the extent that it
shall have become false or misleading in any material respect and each of
Parent and Acquisition Sub further agrees to take all steps necessary to cause
the Offer Documents as so corrected to be filed with the SEC and be
disseminated to Company Shareholders, in each case, as and to the
extent required by applicable Law. Company will promptly furnish to Parent
all information concerning the Company that may be reasonably requested by
Parent and Acquisition Sub in connection with any action contemplated by this
_Section 1.1(b)_. No representation is made by Parent or Acquisition Sub with
respect to information supplied by Company for inclusion in the Offer
Documents.

 

  1.2 _Company Actions_. (a) Company hereby approves of
and consents to the Offer and represents and warrants that (i) the making of
the Offer and proposal and the

     

 taking of any other action by Parent and Acquisition Sub in accordance with
the Agreement and the Transactions have been unanimously consented to by the
Company Board, and (ii) the Company Board (at a meeting or meetings
duly called and held) has, on the terms and subject to the conditions set
forth herein, unanimously (A) determined that the Agreement and the
Transactions, including the Offer and the Merger, are advisable, fair to, and
in the best interests of, Company and the Company Shareholders, (B) approved
the execution, performance and delivery of the Agreement and the consummation
of the Transactions, including the Merger and the Offer, (C) rendered the
Rights and the limitations on certain transactions contained in Article NINTH
of Company\'s articles of incorporation inapplicable to the Transactions,
including the Offer and the Merger, (D) approved the Transactions, (C)
approved, adopted and declared advisable the agreement and plan of
merger contained in the Agreement and directed that such agreement and plan
of merger be submitted to the Company Shareholders for approval (unless the
Merger is consummated in accordance with Section 96 of the BCA as contemplated
by _Section 1.6(d)_ of this _Exhibit A_ ) and resolved to recommend to the
Company Shareholders acceptance of the Offer, tender of their shares to
Acquisition Sub pursuant to the Offer and approval of the agreement and plan
of merger contained in the Agreement (" _Company Board Recommendation_ "), and
Company hereby consents to the inclusion of the foregoing determination and
approval in the Offer Documents, and (E) irrevocably resolved to elect, to the
extent permitted by Law, not to be subject to any "moratorium", "control share
acquisition", "business combination", "fair price", "interested stockholder"
or other form of anti-takeover Laws and regulations (collectively, " _Takeover
Laws_ ") of any jurisdiction that may purport to be applicable to the
Agreement.

 

  (b) On the date of the Offer is

  1.4 _Directors_. (a) Promptly upon the purchase of
Shares by Acquisition Sub pursuant to the Offer and from time to
time thereafter, Acquisition Sub will be entitled to designate such number of
directors, rounded up to the next whole number, on the Company Board as will

of the total number of directors on the Company Board (after giving effect to
any increase in the number of directors pursuant to this _Section 1.4(a)_ )
and the percentage that the number of Shares beneficially owned by Parent and
Acquisition Sub bears to the total number of Shares then outstanding, and
Company and Company Board will take all action necessary to promptly cause,
upon request by Acquisition Sub, the increase of the size of the Company
Board or use its reasonable best efforts to secure the resignations of such
number of directors as is necessary to provide Acquisition Sub with such level
of representation and Company and Company Board will take all action necessary
to cause Acquisition Sub\'s designees to be so elected or appointed. Company

Acquisition Sub to constitute the same percentage of the entire Company Board
to constitute: (i) each committee of the Company Board; (ii) each board of
directors and each committee thereof of each wholly owned Subsidiary of
Company; and (iii) the designees, appointees or other similar representatives
of Company on each board of directors and each committee thereof of each non-
wholly owned Subsidiary. Company\'s obligations to appoint designees to the
Company Board will be subject to

     

 Section 14(f) of the Exchange Act. At the request of Acquisition Sub,
Company will take all actions necessary to effect any such election or
appointment of Acquisition Sub\'s designees, including mailing to the
Company Shareholders the information required by Section 14(f) of the
Exchange Act and Rule 14f-1 promulgated thereunder which, unless Acquisition

requiring action by the Company Board, any extension of time for the
performance of any of the obligations or other acts of Acquisition Sub under
the Agreement and any waiver of compliance with any of the agreements or
conditions under the Agreement for the benefit of Company or any exercise of
Company\'s rights or remedies under the Agreement will require the concurrence
of a majority of the directors of Company then in office who are directors of
Company on the date hereof.

 

  (c) In the event that Acquisition
Sub\'s designees are elected or appointed to the Company Board pursuant to
_Section 1.4(a)_ of this _Exhibit A_ , until the Effective Time, (i) the
Company Board will have at least such number of directors as may be required
under the rules of the NYSE or the federal securities Laws who are considered
independent directors within the meaning of such rules and Laws ("
_Independent Directors_ ") and (ii) each committee of the Company Board that
is required by such rules or securities Laws to consist solely of, or a
majority of, Independent Directors will consist of the requisite number of
Independent Directors; _provided_ , _however_ , that in such event, if the
number of Independent Directors will be reduced below the number of directors
as may be required by such rules or securities Laws for any reason whatsoever,
the remaining Independent Director(s) will be entitled to designate Persons
to fill such vacancies who will be deemed to be Independent Directors for
purposes of the Agreement or, if no other Independent Director then remains,
the other directors will designate such number of independent directors as
may be required by the rules of the NYSE and the federal securities Laws, to
fill such vacancies who will not be shareholders or Affiliates of Acquisition
Sub or Company.

 

  1.5 _Top-Up Option_. (a) Company hereby grants to Parent
and Acquisition Sub an irrevocable option (the " _Top-Up Option_ "),
exercisable only on the terms and conditions in this _Section 1.5_ , to
purchase at a price per share equal to the Acquisition Price, a number of
newly issued shares of Company common stock (the " _Top-Up Option Shares_
") that, when added to the number of Shares owned by Parent or Acquisition
Sub or any wholly-owned Subsidiary of Parent or Acquisition Sub at the time of
exercise of the Top-Up Option, constitutes one Share more than 90% of the
number of Shares that will be outstanding immediately after the issuance of
the Top-Up Option Shares. The Top-Up Option may be exercised by Parent or
Acquisition Sub, in whole or in part, at any time on or after the expiration
date of the Offer and on or prior to the fifth Business Day after the later
of (i) the expiration date of the offer or (ii) the expiration date of any
subsequent offering period; provided, however, that the obligation of

     

 Company to deliver Top-Up Option Shares upon the exercise of the Top-Up
Option is subject to the conditions that (A) no provision of any applicable
Law and no judgment, injunction, order or decree shall prohibit the
exercise of the Top-Up Option or the delivery of the Top-Up Option Shares in
respect of such exercise, (B) the issuance of Top-Up Option Shares pursuant to
the Top-Up Option would not require approval of Company Shareholders under
applicable Law or regulation (including, without limitation, NYSE rules and
regulations), (C) upon exercise of the Top-Up Option, the number of Shares
owned by Parent or Acquisition Sub or any wholly-owned Subsidiary of Parent or
Acquisition Sub constitutes one Share more than 90% of the number of Shares
that will be outstanding immediately after the issuance of the Top-Up Option
Shares, and (D) Acquisition Sub has accepted for payment and paid for all
Shares validly tendered in the Offer and not withdrawn. The parties will
cooperate to ensure that the issuance of the Top-Up Option Shares is
accomplished consistent with all applicable legal requirements of all
Governmental Entities, including compliance with an applicable exemption from
registration of the Top-Up Option Shares under the Securities Act.

 

  (b) Upon the exercise of the Top-Up
Option in accordance with _Section 1.5(a)_ , Parent will so notify Company, at
least one Business Day in advance, and will set forth in such notice (i) the
aggregate number of Shares that are expected to be owned by Parent,
Acquisition Sub or any wholly-owned Subsidiary of Parent or Acquisition Sub
immediately preceding the purchase of the Top-Up Option Shares and (ii) a
place and time for the closing of the purchase of the Top-Up Option Shares.
Company will, as soon as practicable following receipt of such notice, notify
Parent and Acquisition Sub of the number of Shares then outstanding and the
number of Top-Up Option Shares. At the closing of the purchase of the Top-Up
Option Shares, Parent or Acquisition Sub, as the case may be, will pay the
Company the aggregate price required to be paid for the Top-Up Option
Shares, and the Company will cause to be issued to Parent or Acquisition Sub
a certificate representing the Top-Up Option Shares. The aggregate purchase
price payable for the Top-Up Shares may be paid by Acquisition Sub or Parent
by executing and delivering to the Company a promissory note having a
principal amount equal to the balance of the aggregate purchase price for the
Top-Up Shares. Any such promissory note shall bear interest at the rate of
interest per annum equal to 8%, shall mature on the first anniversary of the
date of execution and delivery of such promissory note and may be prepaid
without premium or penalty.

occurrence and cooperate in filing with the SEC or its staff or any other
government officials, and/or mailing to Company Shareholders, such amendment
or supplement.
