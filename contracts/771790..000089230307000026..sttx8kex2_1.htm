 \t

 5.2. _Exchange of \tCertificates_. 

 \t

 (a) _Paying \tAgent_. At or prior to the Closing and for the benefit of holders of \tShares, Mitsui USA shall make available or cause to be made available to the \tPaying Agent immediately available funds sufficient in the aggregate to \tprovide all funds necessary for the Paying Agent to make payments of the Per \tShare Merger Consideration 

 \t pursuant to Section 5.1(a) \t(such cash being hereinafter referred to as the
" _Exchange Fund_ ").  \tThe Paying Agent shall invest the Exchange Fund as
directed by Mitsui USA; \t _provided_ that such investments shall be in
obligations of or \tguaranteed by the United States of America, in commercial
paper obligations \trated A-1 or P-1 or better by Moody\'s Investors Service,
Inc. or Standard and \tPoor\'s Corporation, respectively, in certificates of
deposit, bank \trepurchase agreements or banker\'s acceptances of commercial
banks with \tcapital exceeding $1 billion, or in money market funds having a

resulting from \tsuch investment shall become a part of the Exchange Fund,
and any amounts in \texcess of the amounts payable under Section
5.1(a) \tshall be promptly returned to the Surviving Corporation.

 \t

 (b) _Exchange \tProcedures_. Promptly after the Effective Time (and in any event within \tthree business days thereafter), the Surviving Corporation shall cause the \tPaying Agent to mail to each holder of record of Shares (other than holders \tof Excluded Shares) (i) a letter of transmittal in customary form specifying \tthat delivery shall be effected, and risk of loss and title to the \tCertificates shall pass, only upon delivery of the Certificates (or \taffidavits of loss in lieu of the Certificates as provided in Section 5.2(e)) \tto the Paying Agent, such letter of transmittal to be in such form and to \thave such other provisions as Mitsui USA and the Company may reasonably \tagree, and (ii) instructions for use in effecting the surrender of the \tCertificates (or affidavits of loss in lieu of the Certificates as provided \tin Section 5.2(e)) in exchange for the Per \tShare Merger Consideration. Upon surrender of a Certificate (or affidavit \tof loss in lieu of the Certificate as provided in Section 5.2(e)) \tto the Paying Agent in accordance with the terms of such letter of \ttransmittal, duly executed, the holder of such Certificate shall be entitled \tto receive in exchange therefor a cash amount in immediately available funds \t(after giving effect to any required tax withholdings as provided in \tSection 5.2(g)) equal to (x) the number of \tShares represented by such Certificate (or affidavit of loss in lieu of the \tCertificate as provided in Section 5.2(e)) \tmultiplied by (y) the Per Share Merger Consideration, and the Certificate so \tsurrendered shall forthwith be cancelled. No interest shall be paid or \taccrued on any amount payable upon due surrender of the Certificates. In \tthe event of a transfer of ownership of Shares that is not registered in the \ttransfer records of the Company, a check for any cash to be exchanged upon \tdue surrender of the Certificate may be issued to such transferee if the \tCertificate formerly representing such Shares is presented to the Paying \tAgent, accompanied by all documents required to evidence and effect such \ttransfer and to evidence that any applicable stock transfer taxes have been \tpaid or are not applicable.

 \t

 (c) _Transfers_.  \tFrom and after the Effective Time, there shall be no transfers on the stock \ttransfer books of the Company of the Shares that were outstanding \timmediately prior to the Effective Time. If, after the Effective Time, any \tCertificate is presented to the Surviving Corporation, Mitsui USA or the \tPaying Agent for transfer, it shall be cancelled and exchanged for the cash \tamount in immediately available funds to which the holder of the Certificate \tis entitled pursuant to this ARTICLE V, \tunless such holder or any other Person already shall have received cash in \trespect of such Shares 

 \t pursuant to Section 5.2(e).

 \t

 (d) _Termination \tof Exchange Fund_. Any portion of the Exchange Fund (including the \tproceeds of any investments of the Exchange Fund) that remains unclaimed by \tthe shareholders of the Company for 180 days after the Effective Time shall \tbe delivered to the Surviving Corporation. Any holder of Shares (other than \tExcluded Shares) who has not theretofore complied with this ARTICLE V \tshall thereafter look only to the Surviving Corporation for payment of the \tPer Share Merger Consideration (after giving effect to any required tax \twithholdings as provided in Section 5.2(g)) \tupon due surrender of its Certificates (or affidavits of loss in lieu of the \tCertificates), without any interest thereon. Notwithstanding the foregoing, \tnone of the Surviving Corporation, Mitsui USA, the Paying Agent nor any \tother Person shall be liable to any former holder of Shares for any amount \tproperly delivered to a public official pursuant to applicable abandoned \tproperty, escheat or similar Laws. 

 \t

 (e) _Lost, \tStolen or Destroyed Certificates_. In the event any Certificate shall \thave been lost, stolen or destroyed, upon the making of an affidavit of that \tfact by the Person claiming such Certificate to be lost, stolen or destroyed \tand, if required by Mitsui USA, the posting by such Person of a bond in \tcustomary amount and upon such terms as may be required by Mitsui USA as \tindemnity against any claim that may be made against it or the Surviving \tCorporation with respect to such Certificate, the Paying Agent shall issue a \tcheck in the amount (after giving effect to any required tax withholdings) \tequal to the number of Shares represented by such lost, stolen or destroyed \tCertificate multiplied by the Per Share Merger Consideration.

 \t

 (f) _ \tDissenters\' Rights_. No Dissenting Shareholder shall be entitled to \treceive any of the Per Share Merger Consideration for his or her Shares \tunless and until the holder thereof shall have failed to perfect or shall \thave effectively withdrawn or lost such holder\'s right to dissent from the \tMerger under the KBCA, and any Dissenting Shareholder shall be entitled to \treceive only the payment as provided by Sections 271B.13-010 through \t271B.13-310 of the KBCA (the " _Dissenters\' Rights Statute_ ") with \trespect to Shares owned by such Dissenting Shareholder. If any Person who \totherwise would be deemed a Dissenting Shareholder shall have failed to \tperfect properly or shall have effectively withdrawn or lost the right to \tdissent with respect to any Shares, such Shares shall thereupon be treated \tas though such Shares had been converted into the right to receive the Per \tShare Merger Consideration pursuant to Section 5.1(a). \t The Company shall give Mitsui USA (i) prompt notice of any written demands \tfor payment under the Dissenters\' Rights Statute, attempted withdrawals of \tsuch demands, and any other instruments served pursuant to applicable Law \treceived by the Company relating to shareholders\' right to dissent or to \treceive payment under the Dissenters\' Rights Statute and (ii) the \topportunity to direct all negotiations and proceedings with respect to \tdemand for payment under the Dissenters\' Rights Statute. The Company shall \tnot, except with the prior written consent of Mitsui USA, voluntarily make \tany payment with respect to any demands for payment under the Dissenters\' \tRights Statute with respect to any Shares that are owned by Dissenting \tShareholders, offer to settle or settle any such demands or 

 \t approve any withdrawal of any such demands.

 \t

 (g) _Withholding \tRights_. Each of Mitsui USA, the Surviving Corporation, the Paying Agent \tand any Affiliate of Mitsui USA shall be entitled to deduct and withhold \tfrom the consideration otherwise payable pursuant to this Agreement to any \tholder of Shares, Company Options or Company Awards such amounts as it is \trequired to deduct and withhold with respect to the making of such payment \tunder the Code or any other applicable state, local or foreign Tax Law.
