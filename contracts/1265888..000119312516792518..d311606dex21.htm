successful in whole or in part, shall be entitled to be paid also the expense of prosecuting the claim.&nbsp;In connection with any claim for indemnification, the corporation shall be entitled to raise as a defense to any such action that the
claimant has not met the standards of conduct that make it permissible under the DGCL or any other applicable law for the corporation to indemnify the claimant for the amount claimed.&nbsp;Neither the failure of the corporation (including its Board
of Directors, independent legal counsel or its stockholders) to have made a determination prior to the commencement of such action that indemnification of the claimant is proper in the circumstances because the director or officer has met the
applicable standard of conduct set forth in the DGCL or any other applicable law, nor an actual determination by the corporation (including its Board of Directors, independent legal counsel or its stockholders) that the claimant has not met such
applicable standard of conduct, shall be a defense to the action or create a presumption that claimant has not met the applicable standard of conduct.&nbsp;In any suit brought by a director or officer to enforce a right to indemnification or to an
advancement of expenses hereunder, the burden of proving that the director or officer is not entitled to be indemnified, or to such advancement of expenses, under this section or otherwise shall be on the corporation. </P>
