on the one hand; and

4 Target Company 2s total share capital amounts to EUR 100,000.00 (hundred

   (G) | The shareholdings in Target Company 2 are therefore as follows:

      |  |  |  |  |  |  |  | 
---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---

 |



 | 
 



   (H) | It is intended to restructure the Target Companies in a way such
that Target Company 1 and Target Company 2 will merge pursuant to Sec. 96
GmbHG ( _Verschmelzung_ ), whereas Target Company 2 shall be the company
transferring all of its assets and liabilities ( _u bertragende Gesellschaft_)
and Target Company 1 shall be the company assuming Target Company 2 including
its respective assets and liabilities ( _aufnehmende Gesellschaft_ ), thereby
utilizing the benefits of the Austrian _Umgr undungssteuergesetz_ (the "
_Merger_ "). The Parties contemplate that Seller 2 will, prior to the Merger,
and as a condition to Closing, contribute Share 3 to Target Company 1 (the "
_Contribution_ "). After implementation of the Contribution and/or the Merger
(meaning registration of the Merger in the Austrian companies register (
_Firmenbuch_ )), Target Company 2 shall have ceased to exist.

   (I) | Following the Contribution _,_ Seller 1 shall hold a share in
Target Company 1 that corresponds to a share capital in the amount of EUR
32,375.75 (thirty-two thousand three hundred seventy-five point seventy-five
Euros), representing approx. 89.1 % of Target Company 1s total share capital
(the " _Share 1_ ") and Seller 2 shall hold a share in Target Company 1

thousand nine hundred sixty point sixty-seven Euros), representing approx.
10.9 % of Target Company 1s total share capital (the " _Share 2_ "; Share
1 and Share 2 are referred to collectively as the " _Shares_ " _,_ and the "
_Share_ " means each of them, as the case may be).

---|---|--- 



   2.7 | Notice of Objection

     | (a) | If the Party receiving the Final Financial Statement (the "
_Receiving Party_ ") intends to object to the determination and/or calculation
of the Final Net Financial Debt and/or the Final Net Working Capital as
determined under the Final Financial Statement delivered by the other Party
(the " _Sending Party_ ") and, consequently, to the Purchase Price Adjustments
and the Purchase Price, the Receiving Party shall, no later than 30 (thirty)
Business Days from the receipt of the Final Financial Statement, deliver to
the Sending Party a written notice of objection setting out the reasons for
the Receiving Partys objections and, in particular, specifying the items
which the Receiving Party disputes and the variation, specifying the amounts,
with adequate explanations which, in the Receiving Partys opinion, should be
made to the Final Financial Statement (the " _Notice of Objection_ "). Each
Party shall (and shall procure that the Target Companies, as well as their and
the Target Companies employees, officers and advisers shall) cooperate with
each Party in good faith and shall provide each Party with all the
explanations and clarifications reasonably requested in connection with the
review of the Final Financial Statement. 
---|---|--- 
 



     | (b) | If the Receiving Party delivers the Notice of Objection

Parties shall negotiate in good faith to resolve any disagreement. If the
Parties are unable to reach an amicable settlement within 20 (twenty) Business
Days from the Sending Partys receipt of the Notice of Objection, any such
disagreement between the Parties shall be submitted by either Party to the
Expert as an exclusive remedy. 
---|---|--- 



     | (c) |

For the purposes of the Experts determination pursuant to this paragraph, the
Expert shall not be bound by any determinations, statements or valuations
included in the annual accounts of the Target Companies (whether approved or
not approved, audited or unaudited) and shall apply in the following order:
(i) the criteria, determinations and rules set out in this Agreement, (ii)
Austrian GAAP including on whether to include and how to value items on a
consistent basis for the last 2 (two) business years of the Target Companies.
For its determination, the Expert shall take into account also all such facts

have become known only after the Reference Date. The Expert shall calculate
and determine only the items of the Final Net Financial Debt and/or the Final
Net Working Capital, which are being disputed by the Parties, excluding the

subject to any further challenge by the Parties, except in the event of a
manifest error (in which case the relevant part of the Experts determination
shall be void and the matter be remitted to the Expert for correction). § 1056
second sentence of the Austrian Civil Code ( _ABGB_ ) shall be excluded for
purposes of this Agreement. The fees, costs and expenses of the Expert shall
be divided 50/50 between the Sellers on the one hand and the Purchaser on the
other hand.

   2.8 | The reference date for the Final Financial Statement shall be 30
April 2012 (the " _Reference Date_ ").

   2.9 | Payments 
---|--- 



     | (a) | Provisional Purchase Price

Incremental Stores together equals at least EUR *** (in words: Euro ***); and

     | (e) | the average capital expenditure for Incremental Stores that
are Street Locations does not exceed EUR *** (in words: Euro ***) per square
meter and the average capital expenditure for Incremental Stores that are
Mall Stores does not exceed EUR *** (in words: Euro ***) per square meter
(except if the Purchaser approves of a deviation of such capital expenditure);
upon the written consent by the Purchaser (not to be unreasonably withheld),
the Sellers shall have the right to determine whether and to which extent the
Target Companies open Street Locations and/or Mall Stores; to the extent the
average capital expenditure for Incremental Stores that are Street Locations
is lower than EUR *** (in words: Euro ***) per square meter the " _Saving_ "
(defined as the difference of EUR *** (in words: Euro ***) and actual lower
capital expenditure per square meter multiplied by store surface of
Incremental Stores that are Street Locations) shall upon the written consent
by the Purchaser (not to be unreasonably withheld) be available for increasing
the EUR *** (in words: Euro ***) cap for Mall Stores set forth above as
follows: the Saving divided by store surface of Incremental Stores that are
Mall Stores. 
---|---|--- 



   3.7 | With respect to the calculation of the Incremental European Store
Metrics, for Incremental Stores that have been in operation for at least
twelve 12 (twelve) months by 30 April 2015, then the actual Aggregate Sales
and actual Profit Contribution Margin for such stores for the 12-Months Period
shall be utilized. For Incremental Stores that have not been in operation for
at least 12 (twelve) months by 30 April 2015 (the " _Latest Incremental
Stores_ "), the Aggregate Sales and Profit Contribution Margin shall be
determined for the 12-Months Period by utilizing a pro forma extrapolation of
Aggregate Sales and Profit Contribution Margin based on actual results
starting on the first day of the month following the opening of such Latest
Incremental Stores until 30 April 2015 (the " _Pro Forma Extrapolation_ "). In
the event that the Pro Forma Extrapolation for the Latest Incremental Store
results in an average Profit Contribution Margin for all Incremental Stores of
less than *** percent (*** %), then the Sellers may elect to re-calculate the
average Profit Contribution Margin for the Latest Incremental Stores by
utilizing actual results of the Latest Incremental Stores for the first 12
(twelve) months of operation of the Latest Incremental Stores starting on the
first day of the month following the opening of such Latest Incremental
Stores, provided, that if Sellers make this election then the Aggregate Sales
for the Latest Incremental Stores will also be determined by utilizing the
actual results for the first 12 (twelve) months of operation starting on the
first day of the month following the opening of such Latest Incremental
Stores (rather than the Pro Forma Extrapolation calculation for Aggregate
Sales). Similarly, in the event that the Pro Forma Extrapolation of Aggregate
Sales for the Incremental Stores results in a calculation of Aggregate Sales
of less than EUR *** (in words: Euro ***), then the Sellers may elect to re-
calculate the Aggregate Sales for the Incremental Stores by utilizing actual
results for the first 12 (twelve) months of operation for the Latest
Incremental Stores starting on the first day of the month following the
opening of such Latest Incremental Stores, provided, that if Sellers make this
election then the average Profit Contribution Margin calculation for
the Incremental Stores will also be determined by utilizing the actual
results for the first 12 (twelve) months of operation starting on the first
day of the month following the opening of such Latest Incremental Stores
(rather than the Pro Forma Extrapolation calculation for the average Profit
Contribution Margin) for the Latest Incremental Stores.

13 provisions set forth in Clauses 3.6(a) and 3.6(e) and applied _mutatis
mutandis_ for the *** new stores are fulfilled (unless the Purchaser has
otherwise approved of a deviation of such capital expenditure). For the
avoidance of doubt, those of the Target Companies new stores that are taken
into consideration for the calculation of the EBITDA 2014/15 for the
First Incentive Payment are in accordance with the Sellers determination
shall not be taken into consideration for purposes of calculating the
Incremental European Store Metric for the Third Incentive Payment. 
---|--- 
 



   3.9 | Any businesses, assets or Subsidiaries acquired by the Target
Companies by way of mergers or acquisitions (including by way of share deals
and assets deals), if any, are to be taken into considerations for purposes
of the calculation of the EBITDA 2014/15 for the First Incentive Payment
and/or the EBITDA 2014/15 for the Second Incentive Payment and the Incremental
European Store Metric for the Third Incentive Payment. 
---|--- 



   3.10 | Any stores acquired by the Target Companies by way of mergers or
acquisitions (including by way of share deals or asset deals) (as opposed to
newly opened stores) will be included in the calculation for the Incremental
European Store Metric for the Third Incentive Payment, provided: 
---|--- 



     | (a) | the Purchaser has agreed to the acquisition (such agreement
not to be unreasonably withheld); or 
---|---|--- 
 



     | (b) | the capital expenditure to purchase such acquired stores
(the " _Acquisition Costs_ ") complies with the capital expenditure provisions
set forth in Clause 3.6(e) and which shall be applied _mutatis mutandis_ to
the acquired stores and the Acquisition Costs. 
---|---|--- 



   3.11 | If a Second Incentive Payment and/or a Third Incentive Payment
is payable, in each case 50 % (fifty percent) thereof shall be payable in the
form of cash, whilst the other 50 % (fifty percent) shall be payable in the
form of common stock of Zumiez, Inc. (Nasdaq: ZUMZ US) (" _Zumiez Stock_ ").
For the calculation under this provision, the number of shares of Zumiez Stock
to be awarded will be based on the Stock Ratio. The " _Stock Ratio_ " shall
be equal to the inverse of the closing per share price of Zumiez Stock on the
Nasdaq Global Select Market on the Closing Date as converted from United
States dollars to Euros using the currency exchange rate in effect on the
Closing Date as determined by the currency converter of Oanda.com (on the
basis of the median value stated on such website), whereas the Purchaser shall
be deemed to be the person purchasing Euros rather than the Sellers being the
person selling Euros. Accordingly, the number of shares of Zumiez Stock to be
granted to the Sellers shall be determined as follows: The amount of the total
Second Incentive Payment and/or Third Incentive Payment multiplied by 50%
(fifty percent) multiplied by the Stock Ratio. The Purchaser agrees to take
all necessary actions to reserve from the authorized and unissued shares of
Zumiez Stock a sufficient number of shares to provide for the issuance of
Zumiez Stock to the Sellers as contemplated and subject to the terms herein. 
---|--- 



   3.12 | For the avoidance of doubt, the total Earn-Out Payment that may
be made in cash shall in no event exceed the amount of EUR 17,100,000 (in
words: Euro seventeen million one hundred thousand). Also, for the avoidance
of doubt, the maximum amount of Zumiez Stock that can be awarded as part of
the Second Incentive Payment and the Third Incentive Payment is the number of
shares equal to EUR 5,000,000 (in words: Euro five million) multiplied by the
Stock Ratio. 
---|--- 



   3.13 | Within thirty (30) Business Days after the Purchaser has
received from the management of the Target Companies (i) the audited annual
accounts of the Target Companies for the 12-Months Period including also, for
purposes of reference, the 12 (twelve) months period preceding the

for the First Incentive Payment and the EBITDA 2014/15 for the Second
Incentive Payment, the Aggregate Sales, the average Profit Contribution Margin
for the Incremental Stores and the amount of the Earn-Out Payment, if any,
and including all information, working papers and calculation materials
reasonably available in order to understand and verify the Purchasers
calculations and determinations (the " _Earn-Out Calculation_ "), and deliver
the Earn-Out Calculation together with the Annual Accounts 2014/15, the Pro
Forma Extrapolation to the Sellers. 
---|--- 



   3.14 | Should, pursuant to the Earn-Out Calculation, the Sellers not
qualify for the Third Incentive Payment, the Purchaser shall instruct the
managing directors of the Target Companies to (and shall itself) repeat the
process provided for in clause 3.13 as soon as the re-calculation of the
Profit Contribution Margin and the Aggregate Sales is possible pursuant to
clause 3.7 on the basis of actual results for the first 12 (twelve) months of
operation of all of the Latest Incremental Stores. Once such process is
completed the Purchaser shall deliver the Earn-Out Calculation together with
the Annual Accounts 2014/15 and the actual results for the first 12
(twelve) months of operation of all of the Latest Incremental Stores to the
Sellers. 
---|--- 



   3.15 | If the Sellers have received the Earn-Out Calculation pursuant
to Clause 3.13 and the Sellers qualify for the Third Incentive Payment
thereunder: the Earn-Out Calculation shall be final and binding upon the
Parties unless and to the extent the Sellers object in writing to the
Purchaser within thirty (30) Business Days after delivery of the Earn-Out
Calculation produced pursuant to Clause 3.13 (the " _Earn-Out Calculation
Objection_ "). If, within one (1) month after receipt of an Earn-Out
Calculation Objection the Parties cannot settle their dispute, the Expert, at
the request of one Party, which must be made within one (1) further week,
shall decide on the issues disputed between the Parties. Clause 2.7(d) applies
accordingly. The application to the Expert must finally specify the challenged
positions in the Earn-Out Calculation and the Expert shall only review the
specified positions. The Expert shall render its decision and notify it to the
Parties within one (1) month after application is made. Items which are not
challenged in the application can no longer be challenged by the Parties
after the expiration of the deadline. The Earn-Out Calculation shall become
final and binding to the extent it has been agreed between the Parties or
determined by the Expert and delivered to the Parties in writing. 
---|--- 
 



   3.16 | If the Sellers have received the Earn-Out Calculation pursuant
to Clause 3.13 and the Sellers do not qualify for the Third Incentive Payment
thereunder: the Earn-Out Calculation shall become final and binding upon the
Parties as follows: as regards the First Incentive Payment and the Second
Incentive Payment Clause 3.15 shall be applied first with respect to the First
Incentive Payment and the Second Incentive Payment irrespective of the fact
that the determination of the Third Incentive Payment has not been completed
and, once the process provided for under Clause 3.13 has been completed, also
to the Third Incentive Payment. 
---|--- 
 



   3.17 | Each part of the Earn-Out Payment that has become final and
binding according to Clauses 3.15 and 3.16, if any, shall be made to the
Sellers bank accounts as specified in _Schedule 3.17_ within ten (10)
Business Days after said part of the Earn-Out Calculation has become final and
binding according to Clauses 3.15 and 3.16. 
---|--- 
 



   3.18 | The Purchaser shall have the right to withhold and set off
against any amount of Earn-Out Payment due to be paid pursuant to this Clause
3 the amount of (i) any Purchase Price Adjustments owed to it pursuant to
Clause 2.4 and (ii) any liability for breaches of Sellers Warranties or
indemnifications to which Purchaser may be entitled under this Agreement.

   3.19 | The Purchaser shall procure that the Target Companies are
granted the opportunity to purchase any of

a price to be approved by Zumiez, Inc., which price may reflect a reasonable
mark-up over the FOB price (Incoterms) at which Zumiez, Inc. and its
Subsidiaries would acquire such store brands ( _Einkaufspreis_ ).



   3.20 | The Purchaser shall use reasonable efforts (including by way of
directions ( _Weisungen_ ) to the management of the Target Companies) to
support the management of the Target Companies in a way to promote the Target
Companies business and will not prevent in bad faith the management from
meeting all criteria required for the full Earn-Out Payment. The Sellers
acknowledge that there is no assurance that the Sellers will receive any
Earn-Out Payment and the Purchaser has not promised or projected any Earn-Out
Payment. 
---|--- 



   3.21 | The relevant Seller will irrevocably and fully forfeit any Earn-
Out Payment if such Sellers employment with the Target Companies pursuant to
Clause 6.2(c) has been terminated (i) by the respective Seller other than for
good cause ( _au ßer aus wichtigem Grund_), good cause to be construed in
accordance with Section 16a of the Austrian Limited Liability Companies Act (
_wichtiger Grund iSd § 16a GmbHG_); or (ii) by the relevant Target Company
for good cause ( _aus wichtigem Grund_ ), good cause to be construed in
accordance with Section 16 para. 2 of the Austrian Limited Liability Companies
Act ( _wichtiger Grund iSd § 16 Abs 2 GmbHG_), in each case with effect prior
to 30 April 2015. If the Sellers elect to re-calculate the Profit Contribution
Margin for the Latest Incremental Stores under Clause 3.7 by utilizing actual
results of the Latest Incremental Stores for the first 12 (twelve) months of
operation of such Latest Incremental Stores, (it being understood, for the
avoidance of doubt, that in these circumstances sentence one of this sub-
clause applies to the question whether or not the relevant Seller forfeits
the First Incentive Payment and the Second Incentive Payment) the relevant
Seller, in deviation from the preceding sentence, irrevocably and fully
forfeits any Third Incentive Payment if such Sellers employment with the
Target Companies has been terminated (i) by the respective Seller other than
for good cause ( _au ßer aus wichtigem Grund_), good cause to be construed in
accordance with Section 16a of the Austrian Limited Liability Companies Act (
_wichtiger Grund iSd § 16a GmbHG_); or (ii) by the relevant Target Company for
good cause ( _aus wichtigem Grund_ ), good cause to be construed in accordance
with Section 16 para. 2 of the Austrian Limited Liability Companies Act (
_wichtiger Grund iSd § 16 Abs 2 GmbHG_), in each case with effect prior to the
end of the first 12 (twelve) months of operation of the last of the Latest
Incremental Stores. 
---|--- 
 



   3.22 | For the avoidance of doubt, if a Sellers employment with the
Target Companies has been terminated (i) by the respective Seller for good
cause ( _aus wichtigem Grund_ ), good cause to be construed in accordance
with Section 16a of the Austrian Limited Liability Companies Act ( _wichtiger
Grund iSd § 16a GmbHG_); or (ii) by the relevant Target Company other than for
good cause ( _au ßer aus wichtigem Grund_), good cause to be construed in
accordance with Section 16 para. 2 of the Austrian Limited Liability Companies
Act ( _wichtiger Grund iSd § 16 Abs 2 GmbHG_), the respective Seller shall
be entitled to his portion of the Earn-Out Payment only if and to the extent
that the criteria for the Earn-Out Payment are met.

   3.23 | The Sellers (in their capacity as managers of the Target
Companies) shall be entitled to introduce and implement an incentive program
for the (senior) management of the Target Companies up to an overall amount
to be agreed between the Parties, with the goal to incentivize the management
to meet the criteria for the Earn-Out Payment and/or further targets (to be
determined by the Sellers and the Purchaser jointly).

---|--- 
 



   8.2 | _ _Disclosure_ :_ The Parties agree that the fact that the
Purchaser has conducted a due diligence review of the Target Companies or has
obtained knowledge of any circumstances constituting a breach of a Sellers
Warranty in any manner other than through a proper disclosure by the Sellers
in this Agreement or through those of its Schedules (including Annexes, if
applicable) which are relevant to the respective Sellers Warranty shall not
exclude, limit or prejudice the rights of the Purchaser in any manner. 
---|--- 



   8.3 | _ _Financial limits__ : The liability of each Seller under or in
respect of the Sellers Warranties shall be limited as follows: 
---|--- 
 



     | (a) | any individual breach of the Sellers Warranties in respect
of which the amount of the damages to which the Purchaser would otherwise be

Warranty or indemnity shall count for the purposes of calculating the
liability caps set out in sub-clauses (i) and (ii) of this Clause so that a
payment having been made under sub-clause (i) shall also be fully taken into

clause (ii) as if such payment had been made under the Sellers Warranties
referred to in sub-clause (ii) and _vice versa_.

being subject to further ordinary or extraordinary legal remedies), but in any
event not before 6 (six) months after expiry of the statute of limitations (
_Festsetzungs- und Bemessungsverj ahrung_) as set out in the Austrian Fiscal
Code ( _Bundesabgabenordnung_ ) or as defined in any other comparable foreign
fiscal code or legislation. The liability of the Sellers for the Sellers

facts and in any event 7 (seven) Business Days prior to the end of the period
available to submit legal remedies in relation to such matter, failing which

the failure of the Purchaser to give notice to the Sellers in accordance with
the provisions of this Clause ( _Verzugsschaden_ ).

   8.6 | _ _No other warranties__ : The Purchaser acknowledges and agrees
that:

any Sellers Warranty to the extent: 
---|--- 
 



     | (a) | an appropriate specific provision is made, or the payment or
discharge is specifically reflected, in the Final Financial Statement and is
therefore reflected in the Purchase Price; or 
---|---|--- 



     | (b) | it would not have arisen but for a change in legislation
announced or enacted on or after the Closing Date (whether relating to
taxation, the rate of taxation or otherwise) or any amendment to or the
withdrawal after the Closing Date of any Tax rulings of the Austrian Tax
authorities (whether or not that change, amendment or withdrawal purports to
be effective retrospectively in whole or in part); or

     | (b) | at any time after the making of the Damages Payment, any
Target Company or the Purchaser is otherwise compensated by actual payments of
insurance or third parties (the " _Third Party Sum_ "); and

the receipt of the Third Party Sum was not taken into account in calculating
the Damages Payment anyway (for the avoidance of doubt, any Damages Payment
shall be reduced before being made to the extent of any compensation the

exceeds the amount required to compensate the Purchaser to the extent provided
herein for the loss or liability which gave rise to the Sellers Warranty in
question (such excess being the " _Excess Recovery_ ").

If this Clause applies, the Purchaser shall or shall procure that the relevant
Target Company shall, without undue delay under the circumstances on receipt
of the Third Party Sum by it (and in any event within 5 (five) Business Days)
inform the Sellers accordingly and repay or procure that the relevant Target
Company repays to the Sellers an amount equal to the Excess Recovery after
deducting (in either case) all reasonable costs (excluding internal costs)
incurred by the Purchaser or the relevant Target Company in recovering the
Third Party Sum and any taxation payable by the Purchaser or the relevant
Target Company by virtue of its receipt.

 



   8.9 | _ _Insurance__ : Without prejudice to the Purchasers duty to
mitigate any loss in respect of any breach of the Sellers Warranties, if in
respect of any matter which would otherwise give rise to a claim arising from
a breach of the Sellers Warranties, any Target Company is entitled to claim
under any policy of insurance (or would have been so entitled had it
maintained in force its insurance cover current at the Closing Date), the
amount of insurance monies to which the relevant Target Company is or would
have been entitled shall reduce the claim for a breach of the Sellers
Warranties. Any such claim for a breach of the Sellers Warranties shall
exclude any increase in insurance premiums to be paid by a Target Company due
to the matter giving rise to the claim under the respective insurance policy.

   8.10 | _ _Tax indemnification__ : The Sellers shall indemnify the
Purchaser and the Target Companies for the payment of any Taxes payable in
respect to periods up to and including the Reference Date to the extent they

---|--- 
 



   9.1 | If the Purchaser becomes aware that any claim has been made
against the Purchaser and/or a Target Company by a third party (including by

Seller in connection with this Agreement:

     | (c) | no admission of liability shall be made and the third party
claim shall not be compromised, disposed of or settled without the prior
consent of the Sellers (not to be unreasonably withheld);

Companies shall take such action, at the Sellers cost, as the Sellers may
reasonably request, taking legitimate business interests of the Target
Companies into account, to avoid, dispute, resist, appeal, compromise or
defend any claim and any adjudication in respect thereof. The Sellers shall
have the right (if they wish and to the extent the Purchaser gives its prior
consent, such consent not to be unreasonably withheld) to control any
proceedings taken in connection with such action, and shall in any event be
kept fully informed of any actual or proposed developments (including
any meetings) and shall be provided with copies of all correspondence and
documentation relating to such claim or action, and such other information,
assistance and access to records and personnel as they reasonably require; and

claim as instructed by the relevant Seller. The costs of such legal counsel
are to be borne by the Seller nominating such counsel (or in case legal
counsel is nominated by both Sellers _pro rata_ to their share ratio in
Target Company 1 as outlined in recital (D). For the avoidance of doubt: to
the extent the costs of legal or tax counsel nominated by any of the (or both)
Sellers under this Clause shall be reimbursed to the Target Companies such

---|---|--- 



   10. | REMEDIES; NO RIGHTS OF RESCISSION OR TERMINATION 
---|--- 



   10.1 |

In case of any breach of any Sellers Warranty, the Sellers shall, subject to
the terms and limitations set out in this Agreement, indemnify the Purchaser,
on a euro-per-euro basis from and against any damages, liabilities, penalties,
expenses, assessments, judgements or deficiencies of any nature whatsoever
adequately attributable to such breach, as well as reasonable attorneys
fees and expenses, but excluding loss of goodwill and purely reputational
losses (the " _Loss_ "), suffered or incurred by the Purchaser and/or any or
all of the Target Companies as a result of such breach. However, with
respect to any violation or breach of a Sellers Warranty, covenant,
agreement or obligation of the Sellers under this Agreement, which has been
notified by Purchaser to Sellers pursuant to this Clause 10.1, the Sellers
shall have the right within a period of 25 (twenty five) Business Days from
receipt of such notice of breach, to remedy, at their own cost and expense,
the defect, violation or breach and take such actions as to put the relevant
Target Company in such state as if no breach of the relevant Sellers
Warranty had occurred to establish the situation which would have existed if
the violation or breach had not occurred during the period until the date as
of which the relevant Sellers Warranty was given. The Purchaser shall be
entitled to claim consequential damages ( _Mangelfolgesch aden_) and loss of
profit ( _entgangener Gewinn_ ). Any payments made by the Sellers hereunder
shall be deemed reductions of the Purchase Price. The Sellers shall promptly

AGREEMENT IN ACCORDANCE WITH RULE 24b-2 UNDER THE SECURITIES EXCHANGE ACT OF
1934.

  



25  reimburse the Purchaser in cash for the Loss promptly after a Loss has been
accepted by Sellers, an arbitration or friendly settlement has been reached
between the Sellers and the Purchaser or an award pursuant to Clause 21.2
below has been passed against the Sellers. The Purchaser shall not be required
to pursue any other remedy (whether statutory, contractual or other) before or
prior to being entitled to indemnification by way of set-off or payment. For
the avoidance of doubt, any liability of the Sellers under this Agreement
shall not depend on intention or negligence by the Sellers, but should be
independent of any fault by any of the Sellers ( _verschuldensunabh
angig_) instead.



   10.2 | The liability of the Sellers for a breach of a Sellers
Warranty, indemnity and for all other obligations of the Sellers under this
Agreement shall be joint and several ( _gesamtschuldnerisch)_ , provided,
however, that any such liability of Seller 2 shall be limited to an amount
equal to 10.9 % (ten point nine percent) of the Purchase Price except for a
breach by Seller 2 of the Sellers Warranty set out in Clause 1.2 of
_Schedule 8.1_ which shall be limited to 100 % (hundred percent) of the
Purchase Price. 
---|--- 



   10.3 | As a general principle to this Agreement, the Purchaser shall
not be entitled to recover more than once in respect of the same Loss
suffered, in particular in case of a breach of the Sellers Warranties the
Purchaser may claim such breach only once even though the facts may constitute
2 (two) or more breaches of the Sellers Warranties (no double dip). 
---|--- 
 



   10.4 | To the greatest extent legally possible, the Purchaser hereby
explicitly waives and excludes any further claims and remedies irrespective of
the nature, amount or legal basis of any such claim or remedy and, in
particular, without limitation, the Purchaser shall have no rights of (i)
withdrawal ( _R ucktritt_), (ii) rescission ( _Wandlung_ ), (iii) challenge of
this Agreement on the grounds of error ( _Irrtumsanfechtung_ ) or _laesio
enormis_ , or (iv) any other form of reversal or avoidance ( _R uckabwicklung,
Anfechtung_) of this Agreement, nor any claims against the Sellers or its
representatives, agents and/or advisers as a result of any mistake ( _Irrtum_
) about (or as a result of any disturbance ( _St orung_) or disappearance of
the basis of the transaction ( _Wegfall der Gesch aftsgrundlage_) or as a
result of a breach of any pre-contractual duties ( _culpa in contrahendo_ )
or any breach of contract ( _Pflichtverletzung aus dem Schuldverh altnis_)
and/or any liability in tort ( _Deliktshaftung_ ) or (v) damage claims (
_Schadenersatz_ ) for breaches of the Sellers Warranties or any obligation
to indemnify the Purchaser other than as explicitly set out in this Agreement.
Furthermore, it is explicitly agreed by the Parties that the assumption set
forth in Section 924 of the Austrian Civil Code ( _ABGB_ ) does not apply.

undertakes not to:  
---|--- 



     | (a) | engage in any Competitive Activities in the current line of
business of the Target Companies, in particular in any operation of and any
acquisition of or offer to acquire direct or indirect shareholdings in
Competitors, except for shares acquired or held purely for financial
investment purposes without granting the Seller, directly or indirectly,

---|---|--- 
 



   13.2 | For the purpose of the assessment of the existence of any "

his respective capacity as Seller under this Agreement and shall not be
affected or limited by any laws, regulations or restrictions applicable to a
Seller in his capacity as an employee or managing director of a Target
Company. 
---|--- 



   13.3 | _ _Liquidated Damages:__ In case of breach of any of the
undertakings in Clause 13.1, it is understood and agreed that for each breach
and also for each repeated breach, liquidated damages ( _Vertragsstrafe_ ) in
the amount of EUR 100,000 (Euro one hundred thousand) shall apply. However,
the Parties agree that money damages would not be a sufficient remedy for any
breach of this obligation by the Sellers and the Purchaser shall be entitled
to specific performance and injunctive relief as remedies for any such breach.
Such remedies shall not be deemed to be the exclusive remedies for the breach
of this obligation, but shall be in addition to all other remedies in respect
of damage, or otherwise that are available at law. All liquidated damages paid
hereunder shall be taken into account on a Euro per Euro basis in case of any
such additional remedies (including damage claims) in excess of the
liquidated damages.
