Company OP Units whose Shares or Company OP Units, as applicable, were
converted into the Merger Consideration pursuant to _Section 2.01_ or

the date of this Agreement, and (B) any agreement or additional documents
necessary to admit the holders of Company OP Units as of immediately prior to
the Partnership Merger Effective Time as new limited partners of the Surviving

-7-  which such Letter of Transmittal relates, duly endorsed in blank or
otherwise in form acceptable for transfer on the books of the Company or the
Company OP, as applicable, or by an appropriate customary guarantee of
delivery of such Certificates, as set forth in such Letter of Transmittal,

fact delivered to the Paying Agent by the time required in such guarantee of
delivery, and, in the case of Book-Entry Shares, any additional documents
specified in the procedures set forth in the Letter of Transmittal. The
Letter of Transmittal shall specify that delivery shall be effected, and risk
of loss and title to Certificates shall pass, only upon delivery of such
Certificates (or effective affidavits of loss in lieu thereof as provided in
this  _Section 2.03(c)(i)_) or Book-Entry Shares to the Paying Agent and
shall be in such form and have such other provisions as Parent and the Company
may agree.

 

(ii) As soon as reasonably practicable after the date of delivery (or, if

if any, of transfer as the Paying Agent may reasonably request), together with
a properly completed and duly executed Letter of Transmittal and any other
documentation required hereby, the holder of record of such Certificate (or
effective affidavit of loss in lieu thereof as provided in _Section
2.03(c)(i)_) or Book-Entry Shares shall be entitled to receive from the
Exchange Fund in exchange therefor the applicable Merger Consideration in

Unit Cash Consideration payments shall be made via check or wire or other
electronic transfer of immediately available funds, at each such holders
election as specified in the Letter of Transmittal. No interest will be paid

event of a transfer of ownership of Shares that is not registered in
the transfer records of the Company or Company OP Units that is not

applicable stock transfer Taxes have been paid or are not applicable.

Parent to the Paying Agent and shall be included in the Exchange Fund, in
each case until the surrender of such Certificate (or affidavit of loss in
lieu thereof) or Book-Entry Share in accordance with this Agreement. Subject
to applicable Laws, following surrender of any such Certificate (or affidavit
of loss in lieu thereof) or Book-Entry Share there shall be paid to the record

(including the proceeds of any investments thereof) that remains undistributed
to the former holders of Shares or Company OP Units for one year after the
Effective Time shall be delivered to the Surviving Company upon demand, and
any former holders of Shares or Company OP Units who have not surrendered
their Shares in accordance with this _Section 2.03_ shall thereafter look
only to the Surviving Company for payment of their claim for the Merger

Any interest and other income resulting from such investments shall become a
part of the Exchange Fund, and any amounts in excess of the aggregate amount
payable pursuant to this _Article II_ shall be paid to the Surviving Company.
Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained herein, no investment
losses resulting from investment of the Exchange Fund shall diminish the

losses with respect to any investments of the Exchange Fund, or the

 



-10-  Exchange Fund diminishes for any reason below the level required for the
Paying Agent promptly to pay the Merger Consideration to all holders of
Certificates and Book-Entry Shares entitled thereto, Parent shall, or shall
cause the Surviving Company to, promptly replace or restore the cash in the

destroyed, upon the making of an affidavit of that fact by the Person
claiming such document to be lost, stolen or destroyed and, if determined by
Parent in its sole discretion, the posting by such Person of a bond in

compliance that would not reasonably be likely to have a Company Material
Adverse Effect. As of the date hereof, no outstanding written notice of
cancellation or termination has been received with respect to any such

and based on and subject to the limitations, qualifications and assumptions
set forth therein, the Share Merger Consideration proposed to be received in
the Company Merger by the holders of the Company Common Stock pursuant to
this Agreement, is fair to such holders from a financial point of view.

 

3.22 _Takeover Statutes_. Assuming the accuracy of the representation in
_Section 4.22_, the Company Board has taken all action necessary to render
inapplicable to the Company Merger and the other Transactions, the
restrictions on business combinations contained in Subtitle 6 of Title 3 of
the MGCL and Subtitle 7 of Title 3 of the MGCL. No other
"business combination," "control share acquisition," "fair price,"
"moratorium" or other takeover or anti-takeover statute or similar federal or
state Law is applicable to this Agreement, the Company Merger, the
Partnership Merger or the other Transactions. None of the Company, the

filings under the Hart-Scott-Rodino Antitrust Improvements Act of 1976, as

that the aggregate fair market value of the non-exempt assets of Parent and
the entities controlled by the Company is less than $76.3 million.

3.26 _No Other Representations and Warranties_. Each of the Company and the

financial condition, results of operations or otherwise in connection with the
Merger, (b) no

 



-31-  Person has been authorized by Parent, Parent OP, OP Merger Sub or IRT LP LLC
to make any representation or warranty relating to itself or its business or
otherwise in connection with the Merger, and if made, such representation or
warranty must not be relied upon by the Company or the Company OP as having
been authorized by such party and (c) any estimates, projections, predictions,
data, financial information, memoranda, presentations or any other materials

boundary lines of the Parent Property, are not encroached upon, are not in

Parent Properties, except for any such rezoning proceedings that have been
initiated in connection with the development or redevelopment of any of the
Parent Properties, or (ii) any Laws including any zoning regulation or
ordinance, building, fire, health or similar Law, code, ordinance, order or
regulation has been violated for any Parent Property, which in the case of
clauses (i) and (ii) above, would reasonably be likely to have, individually
or in the aggregate, a Parent Material Adverse Effect. Except as set forth on
_Section 4.14(h)_ of the Parent Disclosure Letter, there are no material
unrestored casualties to any Parent Property or any part thereof. The physical
condition of the Parent Property is sufficient to permit the continued conduct
of the business as presently conducted subject to the provision of usual
and customary maintenance and repair performed in the ordinary course of
business, consistent with past practice.

(i)  _Section 4.14(i)_ of the Parent Disclosure Letter sets forth a correct

Parent, any other person thereto (in each case, with or without notice
or lapse of time or both). Each Parent Real Property Lease is valid, binding

ownership of or leasehold interest in any such personal property is subject to
any Liens, except for Parent Permitted Liens.

 

4.15 _Intellectual Property_. Except as individually or in the aggregate would
not reasonably be likely to have a Parent Material Adverse Effect, (a) to the

(i) any Contract that would be required to be filed by Parent as an exhibit to
the Companys Annual Report on Form 10-K pursuant to Item 601(b)(2), (4), (9)
or (10) of Regulation S-K under the Securities Act;

 



-46- (ii) any Contract containing covenants binding upon Parent or the Parent
Subsidiaries that materially restrict the ability of Parent or any of the

materially restrict the ability of the Surviving Company, the Surviving
Partnership or any of their respective Affiliates) to compete in any business
or geographic area or with any Person;

(iii) any material partnership, limited liability company agreement, joint
venture or other similar agreement entered into with any third party;

otherwise, any real property, including any Parent Property or any asset
that, if purchased by Parent or any Parent Subsidiary, would be a Parent
Property;

(v) any Contract that requires Parent or any Parent Subsidiary to dispose of
or acquire assets or properties (other than any real property) that (together
with all of the assets and properties subject to such requirement in such
Contract) have a fair market value in excess of $1,000,000, or involves any
pending or contemplated merger, consolidation or similar business combination
transaction;

(vi) any Contract relating to indebtedness for borrowed money (whether
incurred, assumed, guaranteed or secured by any asset) or under which Parent
or any Parent Subsidiary has, directly or indirectly, made any loan, capital
contribution to, or other investment in, any Person (other than in Parent or
any Parent Subsidiary) in excess of $2,000,000;

(vii) any Contract that obligates Parent or any Parent Subsidiary to
make non-contingent aggregate annual expenditures (other than principal

obligations) in excess of $1,000,000 and is not cancelable within ninety (90)
days without material penalty to Parent or any Parent Subsidiary

(b) As of the date hereof, each of the Parent Material Contracts is valid,
binding and enforceable on Parent or the Parent Subsidiaries, as the case may
be, and, to the Knowledge of Parent, each other party thereto and is in full
force and effect, in each case subject to the Bankruptcy and Equity Exception,
except for such failures to be valid, binding or enforceable or to be in full
force and effect as would not be material to Parent and any Parent Subsidiary.
As of the date hereof, each of Parent and the Parent Subsidiaries has complied
in all material respects with the terms and conditions of Parent Material
Contracts and is not (with or without notice or lapse of time, or both) in
breach or default thereunder, in each case except as would not, individually
or in the aggregate, reasonably be likely to have a Parent Material Adverse
Effect. Neither Parent nor any Parent Subsidiary has received notice of any
violation or default under any Parent Material Contract, except for violations
or defaults that would not, individually or in 

 



-47-  the aggregate, reasonably be expected to have a Parent Material Adverse
Effect. Parent has delivered or made available to the Company, prior to the
execution of this Agreement, true and complete copies of all of the Parent
Material Contracts.

4.17 _Insurance_. Parent and the Parent Subsidiaries have policies of
insurance covering Parent, the Parent Subsidiaries and their respective
properties and assets, in such amounts and with respect to such risks and
losses, which Parent believes are adequate for the operation of its business
and the protection of its assets. All such insurance policies of Parent and
each Parent Subsidiary are in full force and effect, all premiums due and
payable through the date hereof under all such policies have been paid, and
Parent and each Parent Subsidiary are otherwise in compliance in all respects
with the terms of such policies, except for such failures to be in full force
and effect, to pay any premiums, or to be in compliance that would not
reasonably be likely to have a Parent Material Adverse Effect. As of the date
hereof, no outstanding written notice of cancellation or termination has been
received with respect to any such insurance policy, other than in connection
with ordinary renewals.

 

4.18 _Interested Party Transactions_. Except as set forth on _Section 4.18_
of the Parent Disclosure Letter, none of Parent or any Parent Subsidiary, on
the one hand, is a party to any transaction or Contract with any Affiliate,
stockholder that beneficially owns 5% or more of the Parent Common Stock, or
director or executive officer of Parent or any Parent Subsidiary, on the
other hand, and no event has occurred since the date of Parents last proxy
statement to its stockholders that would be required to be reported by Parent
pursuant to Item 404 of Regulation S-K promulgated by the SEC.

 

4.19 _Vote Required_. Assuming the accuracy of the representation in the last
sentence of _Section 3.22_, the Parent Stockholder Approval is the only vote
of the holders of any class or series of shares of Parent necessary to adopt
this Agreement and approve the Merger, the issuance of Parent Common Stock in
the Company Merger and the other Transactions. Other than the Parent OP GP
Approval, no vote of or consent or approval by the holders of any limited
partnership units or general partnership units of Parent OP is necessary to
approve this Agreement, the Partnership Merger, the issuance of Parent
OP Common Units in the Partnership Merger and the other Transactions.

4.20 _Brokers_. None of Parent, Parent OP, OP Merger Sub, IRT LP LLC nor any
of their respective officers, directors or employees has employed any broker,
investment banker or finder or incurred any liability for any brokers fees,
commissions, finders fees or other similar fees in connection with
the Transactions, except that Parent has employed Deutsche Bank Securities
Inc. as its financial advisor, whose fees and expenses will be paid by Parent
in accordance with Parents agreement with such firm.

 

4.21 _Opinion of Financial Advisor_. The Parent Board has received an oral
opinion of Deutsche Bank Securities Inc., to be confirmed by a written
opinion, dated as of the date of this Agreement, to the effect that, as of
such date and based on and subject to the limitations, qualifications and
assumptions set forth therein, the Merger Consideration proposed to be paid by
Parent pursuant to this Agreement is fair, from a financial point of view, to
Parent.

 



-48- 4.22 _Takeover Statutes_. None of Parent, Parent OP, OP Merger Sub or any
other Parent Subsidiary is, nor at any time during the last two (2) years has
been, an "interested stockholder" of the Company as defined in Section 3-601
of the MGCL. No "business combination," "control share acquisition," "fair
price," "moratorium" or other takeover or anti-takeover statute or similar
federal or state Law is applicable to this Agreement or the Transactions.

 

4.23 _Financing_.

(a) Parent has delivered to the Company true, correct and complete copies, as
of the date of this Agreement, of an executed debt commitment letter, dated as
of the date hereof (as the same may be amended or replaced in accordance
with  _Section 6.10_, the " _Commitment Letter_ "), from Deutsche Bank AG
New York Branch, regarding debt funding available to Parent in the amount
noted therein for the purpose of funding a portion of the Share Cash
Consideration and Unit Cash Consideration and all transaction expenses
payable by Parent pursuant hereto (the " _Financing_ "), subject to the terms
thereof.

 

(b) As of the date of this Agreement, the Commitment Letter is in full force
and effect and is the valid, binding and enforceable obligation of Parent and
the other parties thereto, subject to the Bankruptcy and Equity Exception.
There are no conditions precedent to the funding of the full amount of the
Financing, other than as expressly set forth in or contemplated by the
Commitment Letter. Subject to obtaining the Financing in accordance with the
terms and conditions of the Commitment Letter, as of the date of this
Agreement, the available funds referenced in the Commitment Letter together
with other financial resources of Parent, including cash on hand of Parent on
the Closing Date, will, in the aggregate, be sufficient for the satisfaction
of all of Parents obligations under this Agreement, including the payment of
any amounts required to be paid by Parent pursuant to Article II and of all
fees and expenses required to be paid by Parent and reasonably expected to be
incurred in connection herewith. Parent has fully paid all fees required to be
paid prior to the date of this Agreement pursuant to the Commitment Letter,
if any. As of the date of this Agreement, no event has occurred which, with or
without notice, lapse of time or both, would or would reasonably be expected
to constitute a default or breach on the part of Parent or, to the Knowledge
of Parent, any other parties thereto, under the Commitment Letter. As of the
date of this Agreement, Parent is not aware of any fact, occurrence or
condition that makes any of the assumptions or statements set forth in the
Commitment Letter inaccurate in any material respect.

4.24 _Investment Company Act_. Neither Parent nor any Parent Subsidiary is
required to be registered as an investment company under the Investment
Company Act of 1940, as amended.

4.25 _Hart-Scott-Rodino Antitrust Improvements Act_. In reliance upon, and
subject to the accuracy of the representations and warranties provided in
_Section 3.25_, the Transactions are exempt from any requirement to make any
filings under the Hart-Scott-Rodino Antitrust Improvements Act of 1976, as
amended, and the implementing regulations thereto, 16 C.F.R. parts 801-803,
because (a) the Company is a REIT and (b) the Parent Board has determined that
the aggregate fair market value of the non-exempt assets of Parent and the
entities controlled by the Company is less than $76.3 million.

 



-49- 4.26 _No Other Representations and Warranties_. Parent, Parent OP, OP Merger
Sub and IRT LP LLC each acknowledges and agrees that, except for the
representations and warranties contained in _Article III_ , (a) neither the
Company nor the Company OP makes, or has made, and Parent, Parent OP, OP

warranty, whether express or implied, relating to itself or its business,
affairs, assets, liabilities, financial condition, results of operations or
otherwise in connection with the Merger, (b) no Person has been authorized by

such party and (c) any estimates, projections, predictions, data, financial
information, memoranda, presentations or any other materials or information
provided or addressed to Parent, Parent OP, OP Merger Sub, IRT LP LLC or any
of their Representatives are not and shall not be deemed to be or include

Representatives to, immediately cease and cause to be terminated all existing
discussions and negotiations with any Person conducted theretofore with
respect to any Company Takeover Proposal and request that any such Person
promptly return and/or destroy all confidential information concerning the
Company and the Companys Subsidiaries to the extent permitted pursuant to a
confidentiality agreement with any such Persons. Notwithstanding anything in
this Agreement to the contrary, prior to obtaining Company Stockholder
Approval, the Company and its Representatives may, in response to each
(if any) Company Takeover Proposal made after the date hereof that does not
result from a material breach of this _Section 5.03_, (y) contact the Person
making such Company Takeover Proposal solely to clarify the terms and
conditions thereof and (z) if the Company Board determines in good faith,
after consultation with independent financial advisors and outside legal
counsel, that such Company Takeover Proposal constitutes or is reasonably be 

 



-57-  expected to lead to a Superior Company Proposal, (1) provide access to or
furnish information with respect to the Company and the Company Subsidiaries
to the Person making such Company Takeover Proposal and its Representatives
pursuant to an Acceptable Confidentiality Agreement; _provided_ , that the
Company will prior to or concurrently with the time such information is
provided to such Person provide Parent with all non-public information
regarding the Company that has not previously been provided to Parent that is
provided to any Person making such Company Takeover Proposal; and (2) conduct,
engage or participate in discussions or negotiations with such Person and its
Representatives making such Company Takeover Proposal.

For purposes of this Agreement, " _Acceptable Confidentiality Agreement_ "
means (y) a confidentiality agreement that contains provisions that are no
less favorable in the aggregate to the Company than those contained in the
Confidentiality Agreement; _provided_ that an Acceptable Confidentiality
Agreement need not contain any "standstill" or similar covenant, or (z) to the
extent applicable, a confidentiality agreement entered into prior to the date
hereof.

 

For purposes of this Agreement, " _Company Takeover Proposal_ " means any
inquiry, proposal or offer from any Person (other than Parent or any Parent
Subsidiary) or "group", within the meaning of Section 13(d) of the Exchange
Act, relating to, in a single transaction or series of related transactions,
any (A) acquisition of assets of the Company and the Company Subsidiaries
equal to 20% or more of the Companys consolidated assets (as determined on a
book-value basis) or to which 20% or more of the Companys revenues or
earnings on a consolidated basis are attributable, (B) acquisition of 20% or
more of the outstanding Company Common Stock, (C) tender offer or exchange

the foregoing types of transactions if the sum of the percentage of
consolidated assets, consolidated revenues or earnings and Company Common
Stock involved is 20% or more, in each case, other than the Transactions.

 

For purposes of this Agreement, " _Superior Company Proposal_ " means any bona
fide written Company Takeover Proposal (except that, for purposes of this
definition, the references in the definition of "Company Takeover Proposal" to
"20%" shall be replaced by "50%") that was not the result of a material breach
by the Company of this  _Section 5.03_ and that the Company Board has
determined in good faith, after consulting with the Companys outside legal
counsel and independent financial advisors, is reasonably likely to be
consummated in accordance with its terms and that, if consummated, would
result in a transaction more favorable to the Companys stockholders (solely
in their capacity as such) than the Transactions (including any revisions to
the terms of this Agreement proposed by Parent in response to such proposal
or otherwise) taking into account all reasonably available legal, financial,
regulatory and other aspects of such Company Takeover Proposal (including the
likelihood of consummation of such Company Takeover Proposal) that
the Company Board deems relevant.

(b) Except as expressly permitted by this _Section 5.03(b)_, neither the
Company Board nor any committee thereof shall (i) (A) fail to recommend to
its stockholders that the Company Stockholder Approval be given or fail to
include the Company Boards recommendation of the Agreement, the Merger and
the other Transactions in the Joint Proxy Statement, (B) change,

 



-58-  modify, withhold, or withdraw, or publicly propose to change, qualify,
withhold, withdraw of modify, in a manner adverse to Parent or Parent OP, the
approval of this Agreement, the Merger or any of the other Transactions, (C)
take any formal action or make any recommendation or public statement or other
disclosure in connection with a tender offer or exchange offer other than a

Exchange Act, (D) adopt, approve or recommend, or publicly propose to approve
or recommend to the stockholders of the Company any Company Takeover Proposal
or agree to take any such action, or (E) fail to publicly recommend against
any Company Takeover Proposal within five (5) Business Days of the request of
Parent and/or fail to reaffirm the Company Boards recommendation of the
Agreement, the Merger and the other Transactions within five (5) Business Days
of the request of Parent, or such fewer number of days as remains prior to the
Company Stockholder Meeting (any action described in this clause (i) being
referred to herein as an " _Adverse Recommendation Change_ ") or (ii) cause or
permit the Company or any of the Company Subsidiaries to enter into any letter
of intent, memorandum of understanding, agreement in principle, acquisition
agreement, merger agreement, joint venture agreement, partnership agreement or
other similar agreement relating to a Company Takeover Proposal (other than an
Acceptable Confidentiality Agreement) (an " _Alternative Acquisition
Agreement_ "), or resolve or agree to take any such action. Notwithstanding
anything in this Agreement to the contrary, prior to obtaining Company
Stockholder Approval, but not after, the Company Board may (I) effect
an Adverse Recommendation Change if (a)(1) a material development or change
in circumstances occurs or arises after the date of this Agreement that was
not known by the Company Board as of the date of this Agreement (such material
development or change in circumstances being referred to herein as an "
_Intervening Event_ "), and (2) the Company Board shall have determined, after
consultation with independent financial advisors and outside legal counsel,
that, in light of such Intervening Event, failure to take such action would
be inconsistent with the directors duties under applicable Law, or (b) the
Company receives a Company Takeover Proposal that was not the result of a
breach by the Company of this  _Section 5.03_ in any material respect and
that the Company Board determines, after consultation with independent
financial advisors and outside legal counsel, constitutes a Superior Company
Proposal, and (II) enter into an Alternative Acquisition Agreement with
respect to a Company Takeover Proposal and concurrently cause the Company to
terminate this Agreement pursuant to _Section 8.01_, if and only if, the
Company receives a Company Takeover Proposal that was not the result of a
breach by the Company of this _Section 5.03_ in any material respect and that
the Company Board determines, after consultation with independent financial
advisors and outside legal counsel, constitutes a Superior Company Proposal.

(c) The Company Board shall not be entitled to (i) effect and Adverse
Recommendation Change or (ii) terminate this Agreement pursuant to _Section
8.01_ to enter into an Alternative Acquisition Agreement with respect to a
Superior Company Proposal unless: (A) the Company Board shall have determined,
after consultation with independent financial advisors and outside legal
counsel, that failure to take such action would be inconsistent with the
directors duties under applicable Law; (B) the Company Board shall have
provided at least four (4) Business Days prior written notice to Parent that
it is prepared to effect an Adverse Recommendation Change or terminate this
Agreement pursuant to _Section 8.01_, which notice shall contain a reasonably
detailed description of the basis for the Adverse Recommendation Change or
termination, the identity of the Person making the Superior Company Proposal,
if

 



-59-  applicable, and the material terms and conditions of such Superior Company
Proposal, if applicable (it being understood and agreed that the delivery of
such notice shall not, in and of itself, be deemed to be an Adverse
Recommendation Change); (C) the Company shall have negotiated, and shall have
caused its Representatives to negotiate, in good faith with Parent during such
notice period, to the extent Parent wishes to negotiate; and (D) following
the end of such notice period, the Company Board shall have considered any
proposed revisions to this Agreement proposed by Parent in writing, and shall
have determined, after consultation with its independent financial
advisors and outside legal counsel, that such Superior Company Proposal would
continue to constitute a Superior Company Proposal if such revisions were to
be given effect; _provided_ , that in the event of any material change to the
material terms of such Superior Company Proposal, the Company shall, in each
case, have delivered to Parent an additional notice consistent with that
described in subclause (B) above and the notice period shall have recommenced,
except that the notice period shall be at least two (2) Business Days.

(d) The Company shall, as promptly as practicable (and in any event within
twenty-four (24) hours), advise Parent of the receipt of (i) any Company
Takeover Proposal or request for information or inquiry that expressly
contemplates or that the Company believes could reasonably be expected to lead
to a Company Takeover Proposal, (ii) the identity of the Person making the
Company Takeover Proposal, request or inquiry, and (iii) the material terms
and conditions of such Company Takeover Proposal, request or inquiry. The
Company shall keep Parent promptly advised of all material developments
(including all changes to the material terms of any Company Takeover
Proposal), discussions or negotiations regarding any Company Takeover Proposal
and the status of such Company Takeover Proposal. The Company agrees that it
and the Company Subsidiaries will not enter into any confidentiality agreement
with any Person subsequent to the date hereof which prohibits it or a Company
Subsidiary from providing any information required to be provided to
Parent in accordance with this _Section 5.03_ within the time periods
contemplated hereby.

(e) Nothing contained in this Agreement shall prohibit the Company from (i)
taking and disclosing to its stockholders a position contemplated by Rule
14d-9, Rule 14e-2(a) or Item 1012(a) of Regulation M-A promulgated under the
Exchange Act or (ii) making any disclosure to the Companys stockholders if,
the Company Board determines, after consultation with outside legal counsel,
that the failure so to disclose would be inconsistent with the duties of its
members under applicable Law; _provided_ ,  _however_ , that any disclosure
other than a "stop, look and listen" letter or similar communication of the
type contemplated by Rule 14d-9(f) under the Exchange Act, an accurate
disclosure of factual information to the Companys stockholders that is
required to be made to such stockholders under applicable Law or in
satisfaction of the Company Boards duties or applicable Law, an express
rejection of any applicable Company Takeover Proposal or an express
reaffirmation of the Company Boards recommendation of the Agreement, the
Merger and the other Transactions shall be deemed to be an Adverse
Recommendation Change.

 

(f) Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the contrary, at any time
prior to any termination of this Agreement, the Company Board may grant a
waiver or release under, or determine not to enforce, any standstill agreement
with respect to any class of equity securities of the Company if the Company
Board determines that the failure to take such action would be inconsistent
with the duties of its members under applicable Law.

Each of the Company and Parent shall promptly notify the other upon the
receipt of any comments from the SEC or any request from the SEC for
amendments or supplements to the Form S-4 or the Joint Proxy Statement, and
shall, as promptly as practicable after receipt thereof, provide the other
with copies of all correspondence between it and its Representatives, on the
one hand, and the SEC, on the other hand, and all written comments with

with respect thereto, each of the Company and Parent shall cooperate and
provide the other a reasonable opportunity to review and comment on such
document or response (including the proposed final version of such document

concerning the Company and the holders of the Company Common Stock as may be

-61- (b) If, at any time prior to the receipt of the Company Stockholder Approval
or the Parent Stockholder Approval, any information relating to the Company
or Parent, or any of their respective Affiliates, should be discovered by the
Company or Parent which, in the reasonable judgment of the Company or Parent,
should be set forth in an amendment of, or a supplement to, either the Form
S-4 or the Joint Proxy Statement, so that such documents would not include any
misstatement of a material fact or omit to state any material fact necessary
to make the statements therein, in light of the circumstances under which
they were made, not misleading, the party that discovers such information
shall promptly notify Parent or the Company, as applicable, and the Company
and Parent shall cooperate in the prompt filing with the SEC of any necessary
amendment of, or supplement to, the Joint Proxy Statement or the Form S-4 and,
to the extent required by Law, in disseminating the information contained in

stockholders of Parent. Nothing in this _Section 6.01(b)_ shall limit the
obligations of any party under _Section 6.01(a)_. For purposes of _Section
3.06_, _Section 4.06_ and this _Section 6.01_, any information concerning
or related to the Company, its Affiliates or the Company Stockholder Meeting

Company Stockholder Approval, except to the extent that the Company Board
shall have made an Adverse Recommendation Change as permitted by _Section
5.03(b)_ or effected a termination pursuant to _Section 8.01_.
Notwithstanding the foregoing provisions of this _Section 6.01(c)_, if, on a
date for which the Company Stockholder Meeting is scheduled, the Company has
not received proxies representing a sufficient number of shares of Company
Common Stock to obtain the Company Stockholder Approval, whether or not a
quorum is present, the Company shall have the right to make one or more
successive postponements or adjournments of the Company Stockholder Meeting;
_provided_ that the Company Stockholder Meeting is not postponed or adjourned
to a date that is more than three (3) Business Days prior to the End Date.
Notwithstanding any Adverse Recommendation Change, unless this Agreement is
terminated in accordance with its terms, the obligations of the parties
hereunder shall continue in full force and effect and such obligations shall
not be affected by the commencement, public proposal, public disclosure
or communication to Company of any Company Takeover Proposal (whether or not
a Superior Company Proposal).

 



-62- (d) As promptly as practicable following the date of this Agreement, Parent

its reasonable best efforts to obtain the Parent Stockholder Approval.
Notwithstanding the foregoing provisions of this _Section 6.01(d)_, if, on a
date for which the Parent Stockholder Meeting is scheduled, Parent has not
received proxies representing a sufficient number of shares of Parent Common
Stock to obtain the Parent Stockholder Approval, whether or not a quorum is
present, Parent shall have the right to make one or more successive
postponements or adjournments of the Parent Stockholder Meeting; _provided_
that the Parent Stockholder Meeting is not postponed or adjourned to a date
that is more than three (3) Business Days prior to the End Date.

 

(e) Unless and until this Agreement is terminated, the Company and Parent will
use their respective reasonable best efforts to hold the Company Stockholder
Meeting and the Parent Stockholder Meeting on the same date and as soon as
reasonably practicable after the date of this Agreement.

by Parent, Parent OP or any of their respective Affiliates to be voted in
favor of the adoption of this Agreement and the approval of the Merger and the

Agreement until the Effective Time or the date, if any, on which this
Agreement is terminated pursuant to _Section 8.01_, subject to applicable
Law, and upon reasonable prior written notice, the Company, on the one hand,
and Parent, on the other hand, shall, and each shall cause each of their
respective Subsidiaries to, afford to the other parties and to the other
parties respective Representatives reasonable access during normal business
hours to all of their and their respective Subsidiaries properties, offices,
personnel and books and records and, during such period, the Company, on the
one hand, and Parent, on the other hand, shall, and each shall cause each of
their respective Subsidiaries to, furnish promptly to the other parties all
financial, operating and other data and information concerning its business,
properties and personnel as each may reasonably request; _provided_ ,
_however_ , that any such access shall not interfere unreasonably with the
business or operations of the party granting access or otherwise result in any
unreasonable interference with the prompt and timely discharge by such partys
employees of their normal duties. Neither the Company, nor Parent, nor any of
their respective Subsidiaries shall be required to (i) provide access to or to
disclose information where such access or disclosure would reasonably be
expected to jeopardize the attorney-client, attorney work product or other
legal privilege of the disclosing party (provided that the disclosing party
shall use its reasonable best efforts to allow for such access or disclosure
in a manner that would not reasonably be expected to jeopardize the attorney-
client, attorney work product or other legal privilege) or contravene any Law,
legal duty or binding agreement entered into prior to the date of this
Agreement (provided that the disclosing party shall use its reasonable best
efforts to make appropriate substitute arrangements

 



-63-  to permit reasonable disclosure not in violation of any Law, legal duty or
agreement) or (ii) provide access to or to disclose such portions of documents
or information relating to pricing or other matters that are highly sensitive
where such access or disclosure is reasonably likely to result in antitrust

representations and warranties of the Company and the Company OP, on the one
hand, or of Parent, Parent OP, OP Merger Sub and IRT LP LLC, on the other
hand, contained in this Agreement or any condition to the obligations of the
parties under this Agreement. All information exchanged pursuant to this
_Section 6.02_ shall be subject to the non-disclosure agreement, dated as of
November 5, 2014, between the Company and Parent (or one of its
upstream Affiliates) (the " _Confidentiality Agreement_ ").

6.03 _Reasonable Best Efforts; Notification_.

 

(a) Upon the terms and subject to the conditions set forth in this Agreement,
each of the parties hereto agrees to use its reasonable best efforts to take,
or cause to be taken, all actions and to do, or cause to be done, and to
assist and cooperate with the other parties in doing, all things necessary to
fulfill all conditions applicable to such party pursuant to this Agreement and
to consummate and make effective, in the most expeditious manner practicable,
the Merger and the other Transactions, including (i) obtaining all necessary

(b) The parties shall reasonably cooperate with each other in connection with
the making of all such filings, including furnishing to the others such
information and assistance as a party may reasonably request in connection
with its preparation of any filing or submission that is necessary or
allowable under applicable competition or other Law or requested by any
competition authorities. The parties shall use their respective reasonable
best efforts to furnish to each other all information required for any
application or other filing to be made pursuant to any Law (including all
information required to be included in the Companys disclosure documents) in
connection with the Transactions. To the extent permitted by applicable Law or
any relevant Governmental Entity, and subject to all applicable privileges,
including the attorney-client privilege, each party hereto shall (i) give the
other parties hereto prompt notice upon obtaining knowledge of the making or
commencement of any request, inquiry, investigation, action or
Legal Proceeding by or before any Governmental Entity with respect to the
Merger or any of the other Transactions, (ii) keep the other parties hereto
informed as to the status of any such request, inquiry, investigation, action
or Legal Proceeding and (iii) promptly inform the other parties hereto of any
material communication to or from the U.S. Federal Trade Commission, the U.S.
Department of Justice, any foreign competition authority or any other
Governmental Entity regarding the Merger or any of the other Transactions.
The parties hereto will consult and

 



-64-  reasonably cooperate with one another, and consider in good faith the views
of one another, in connection with, and provide to the other parties in
advance, all analyses, appearances, presentations, memoranda, briefs,
arguments, opinions and proposals to be made or submitted by or on behalf of
any party hereto, including reasonable access to any materials submitted in
connection with any proceedings under or relating to any other applicable
federal, state or foreign competition, merger control, antitrust or similar
Law, including any proceeding under 16 C.F.R. § 803.20.

 

(c) Any party may, as it reasonably deems advisable and necessary, designate
any competitively sensitive material provided to the other parties under this
_Section 6.03_ as "outside counsel only." Such materials and the information
contained therein shall be given only to the outside legal counsel of the
recipient and will not be disclosed by such outside counsel to employees,
officers or directors of the recipient, unless express written permission is
obtained in advance from the source of such materials. In addition, except as
may be prohibited by any Governmental Entity or by any Law, each party
hereto will permit authorized Representatives of the other parties to be
present at each meeting or telephone conference of which such party shall have
advance notice (other than telephone conversations to the extent they relate
to administrative matters) with representatives of any Governmental Entity
relating to any such request, inquiry, investigation, action or Legal
Proceeding and to have access to and be consulted in connection with any
document, opinion or proposal made or submitted to any Governmental Entity in
connection with any such request, inquiry, investigation, action or
proceeding.

(d) In furtherance and not in limitation of the foregoing, subject to the
terms and conditions of this Agreement, each of the parties hereto shall
respond to and seek to resolve as promptly as reasonably practicable any
objection asserted by any Governmental Entity with respect to the
Transactions, and shall use its reasonable best efforts to defend any action,
suit, dispute, litigation, proceeding, hearing, arbitration or claim by or
before any Governmental Entity, whether judicial or administrative, whether
brought by private parties or Governmental Entities or officials, challenging
this Agreement or the consummation of the Transactions. Each of the parties
hereto shall use its reasonable best efforts to take such action as is
reasonably necessary to ensure that no Governmental Entity enters any order,
decision, Judgment, decree, ruling, injunction (preliminary or permanent), or
establishes any Law, rule, regulation or other action preliminarily or
permanently restraining, enjoining or prohibiting the consummation of the
Merger or the other Transactions, or to ensure that no Governmental Entity
with the authority to clear, authorize or otherwise approve the consummation
of the Merger, fails to do so by the End Date. In the event that any
action is threatened or instituted challenging the Merger as violative of any
Law, each of the parties hereto shall use its reasonable best efforts to take
such action as is reasonably necessary to avoid or resolve such action. In the
event that any permanent or preliminary injunction or other order is entered
or becomes reasonably foreseeable to be entered in any proceeding that would
make consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby in accordance with
the terms of this Agreement unlawful or that would restrain, enjoin or
otherwise prevent or materially delay the consummation of the Transactions,
each of the parties hereto shall use its reasonable best efforts to take
promptly such steps as are reasonably necessary to vacate, modify or suspend
such injunction or order so as to permit such consummation prior to the End
Date and shall cooperate with one another in connection with all proceedings
related to the foregoing. The actions required hereunder shall include,
without limitation, the proposal, negotiation and acceptance by the Company or
Parent prior to the End Date of (i) any and all

 



-65-  divestitures of the businesses or assets of it or its Subsidiaries or its
Affiliates, (ii) any agreement to hold any assets of Parent or any of the
Parent Subsidiaries or of the Company or any of the Company Subsidiaries
separate, (iii) any limitation to or modification of any of the businesses,
services or operations of Parent or any of the Parent Subsidiaries or of the
Company or any of the Company Subsidiaries, and (iv) any other action
(including any action that limits the freedom of action, ownership or control
with respect to, or ability to retain or hold, any of the businesses, assets,
properties or services of Parent or any of the Parent Subsidiaries or of the
Company or any of the Company Subsidiaries), in each case as may be required
by any applicable Governmental Entity in order to obtain approval for the
Transactions; _provided_ , _however_ , that no party hereto shall be required
to become subject to, or consent or agree to or otherwise take any action
with respect to, any order, requirement, condition, understanding or agreement
of or with a Governmental Entity to sell, to license, to hold separate or
otherwise dispose of, or to conduct, restrict, operate, or otherwise change
their assets or businesses, unless such order, requirement, condition,
understanding or agreement is conditioned upon the occurrence of the Closing.

 

(e) In connection with and without limiting the foregoing, the Company, the
Company OP and the Company Board shall (i) take all action necessary to
ensure that no state takeover statute or similar statute or regulation is or
becomes applicable to this Agreement, the Company Voting Agreements, the
Partnership Merger, the Company Merger or any of the other Transactions
and (ii) if any state takeover statute or similar statute or regulation
becomes applicable to this Agreement, the Company Voting Agreements, the
Partnership Merger, the Company Merger or any of the other Transactions, take
all action necessary to ensure that the Partnership Merger, the Company
Merger and the other Transactions may be consummated as promptly as
practicable on the terms contemplated by this Agreement and the Company Voting
Agreements and otherwise to minimize the effect of such statute or regulation
on the Partnership Merger, the Company Merger and the other Transactions.

(f) In connection with and without limiting the foregoing, Parent, the Parent
OP, OP Merger Sub, IRT LP LLC and the Parent Board shall (i) take all action
necessary to ensure that no state takeover statute or similar statute or
regulation is or becomes applicable to this Agreement, the Parent Voting
Agreements, the Partnership Merger, the Company Merger or any of the other
Transactions and (ii) if any state takeover statute or similar statute or
regulation becomes applicable to this Agreement, the Parent
Voting Agreements, the Partnership Merger, the Company Merger or any of the
other Transactions, take all action necessary to ensure that the Partnership
Merger, the Company Merger and the other Transactions may be consummated as
promptly as practicable on the terms contemplated by this Agreement and the
Parent Voting Agreements and otherwise to minimize the effect of such statute
or regulation on the Partnership Merger, the Company Merger and the other
Transactions.

 

(g) Each of the Company and the Company OP, on the one hand, and Parent and
Parent OP, on the other hand, shall, to the extent permitted by applicable
Law and any relevant Governmental Entity and subject to all privileges
(including the attorney-client privilege), promptly (and in any event within
two (2) Business Days) notify the other party in writing of:

 

(i) any notice or other communication from any Person alleging that the
Consent of such Person is or may be required in connection with
the Transactions;

 



-66- (ii) any action, suit, claim, investigation or proceeding commenced or, to its
Knowledge, threatened against, relating to or involving or otherwise
affecting the Company, the Company OP or any of the Company Subsidiaries or
Parent or any of the Parent Subsidiaries, as the case may be, that, if pending
on the date of this Agreement, would have been required to have been
disclosed pursuant to any of the representations and warranties contained
herein, or that relates to the consummation of the Transactions;

 

(iii) any inaccuracy of any representation or warranty contained in this
Agreement at any time during the term hereof that would reasonably be likely
to cause the conditions set forth in _Article VII_ not to be satisfied;

connection with the Merger;

(v) in the case of the Company, any Event which, either individually or in
the aggregate, has had or would reasonably be likely to have a Company

delay the ability of the Company or the Company OP to consummate the Merger;

 

(vi) in the case of Parent, any Event which, either individually or in the
aggregate, has had or would reasonably be likely to have a Parent Material
Adverse Effect or would reasonably be likely to materially impair or delay the

condition or agreement to be complied with or satisfied by it hereunder.

(a) Immediately prior to the Partnership Merger Effective Time, the Company
and the Company Subsidiaries shall terminate the employment of all of their
employees, with such termination in accordance with all applicable Laws,
including federal and state "WARN" Act statutes. Parent shall have no
obligation to offer to employ, or to employ, any such employees.

 

(b) Parent shall be responsible for perpetuating the group health plan

(c) Parent shall, or shall cause the Surviving Company to, assume and honor
the obligations of the Company and the Company Subsidiaries under each
Company Benefit Plan, in accordance with their terms, subject to the right to
make amendments or modifications to the extent permitted by such terms. Parent
hereby acknowledges that (i) the Merger will constitute a "Change in Control"
(or concept of similar import) under the Company Benefit Plans and (ii) as a
result of the Merger, the individuals identified in _Schedule 6.04(b)_ will be
deemed to have experienced a "Good Reason" event (or concept of similar
import), as applicable, for all purposes under the Company Benefit Plans.

 



-67- (d) Nothing in this Agreement, express or implied, shall (i) alter or limit
the ability of Parent or any of its Subsidiaries (including, after the
Effective Time, the Surviving Company or any Subsidiary of the Surviving
Company or the Surviving Partnership or any Subsidiary of the Surviving
Partnership) to amend, modify or terminate any of the Company Benefit Plans
or any other benefit or employment plan, program, agreement or arrangement
after the Effective Time, or (ii) confer upon any current or former employee
or other service provider of the Company or the Company Subsidiaries, any
right to employment or continued employment or continued service with the
Parent or any of its Affiliates or constitute or create an employment or
agreement with, or modify the at-will status of, any employee or other
service provider.

6.05 _Indemnification_.

 

(a) Parent and Parent OP agree that all rights to indemnification, exculpation
and advancement of expenses from liabilities for acts or omissions occurring
at or prior to the Effective Time (including any matters arising in connection
with the Transactions) in favor of the current or former directors or officers
of the Company and the Company Subsidiaries as provided in the
Company Articles, the Company Bylaws, the Company OP Limited Partnership
Agreement and the respective comparable organizational documents of the
Company Subsidiaries, and any indemnification or other agreements of the
Company (in each case, as in effect on the date of this Agreement) shall be
assumed by the Surviving Company or the Surviving Partnership, as applicable,
in the Merger, without further action, at the Effective Time, and shall
survive the Merger and shall continue in full force and effect in accordance
with their terms until the expiration of the applicable statute of limitations
with respect to any claims against such directors or officers arising out of
such acts or omissions (and until such later date as such claims
and proceedings arising therefrom shall be finally disposed of), and from and
after the Effective Time Parent shall ensure that the Surviving Company and
Surviving Partnership comply with and honor the foregoing obligations.

 

(b) Parent shall cause to be maintained for a period of not less than six (6)
years from the Effective Time (and until such later time as any proceedings
commenced during such period shall be finally disposed of) the directors and
officers insurance and indemnification policies of the Company and the
Company OP in effect on the date hereof ( _provided_ that Parent
may substitute therefor policies with reputable and financially sound
carriers of at least the same coverage and amounts containing terms and
conditions that are no less favorable to the Indemnified Parties) with respect
to events occurring at or prior to the Effective Time (the " _D andO
Insurance_") for all Persons who are currently covered by such DandO Insurance,
so long as the annual premium therefor would not be in excess of 250% of the
last annual premium paid prior to the date of this Agreement (such 250%
amount, the " _Maximum Premium_ "); _provided_ that (i) if the annual premiums
for such DandO Insurance exceed the Maximum Premium, Parent shall maintain the
most favorable policies of directors and officers insurance obtainable for
an annual premium equal to the Maximum Premium and (ii) Parent may satisfy
their obligations under this _Section 6.05(b)_ by causing the Company and the
Company OP, as applicable, to obtain, on or prior to the Closing Date,
prepaid (or "tail") directors and officers liability insurance policy at
Parents expense, the material terms of which, including coverage and amount,
are no less favorable to such directors and officers than the insurance
coverage otherwise required under this _Section 6.05(b)_. Notwithstanding the
foregoing, if the Company or the Company OP in its sole discretion elects, by
giving written notice to Parent at least two (2)

 



-68-  Business Days prior to the Effective Time, then, in lieu of the foregoing
insurance, effective as of the Effective Time, the Company or the Company OP,
as applicable, shall purchase a directors and officers liability insurance
"tail" or "runoff" insurance program for a period of six (6) years after the
Effective Time with respect to wrongful acts and/or omissions committed or
allegedly committed at or prior to the Effective Time (such coverage to have
an aggregate coverage limit over the term of such policy in an amount not to
exceed the annual aggregate coverage limit under the Companys or the Company
OPs, as applicable, existing directors and officers liability policy, and
in all other respects to be comparable to such existing coverage).

 

(c) From and after the Effective Time, to the fullest extent permitted by Law,
Parent shall and shall cause the Surviving Company and any Subsidiaries of
the Surviving Company, including the Surviving Partnership, to indemnify,
defend and hold harmless, and provide advancement of expenses to, the present
and former officers and directors of the Company, the Company OP or any
Company Subsidiary and any employee of the Company, the Company OP or any
Company Subsidiary who acts as a fiduciary under any Company Benefit Plan
(each an " _Indemnified Party_ ") against all losses, claims, damages,
liabilities, fees and expenses (including reasonable attorneys fees and
disbursements), judgments, fines and amounts paid in settlement (in the case
of settlements, with the approval of the indemnifying party (which approval
shall not be unreasonably withheld)) (collectively, " _Losses_ "), as
incurred (payable monthly upon written request, which request shall include
reasonable evidence of the Losses set forth therein) to the extent arising
from, relating to, or otherwise in respect of, any actual or threatened
action, suit, proceeding or investigation, in respect of actions or omissions
occurring at or prior to the Effective Time in connection with such
Indemnified Partys duties as an officer or director of the Company,
the Company OP or any Company Subsidiary, including in respect of this
Agreement, the Merger and the other Transactions, or as a fiduciary under any
Company Benefit Plan. If any action, suit, proceeding or investigation is
brought against any Indemnified Party in which indemnification or advancement
of expenses could be sought by such Indemnified Party under this _Section
6.05(c)_, the Surviving Company or the Surviving Partnership shall have the
right to control the defense thereof after the Effective Time; _provided_ ,
_however_ , that neither the Surviving Company nor the Surviving Partnership
shall settle or compromise or consent to the entry of any judgment or
otherwise terminate any claim, action, suit, proceeding or investigation of
an Indemnified Party for which indemnification may be sought under this
_Section 6.05(c)_ unless such settlement, compromise, consent or termination
includes an unconditional release of such Person from all liability arising
out of such claim, action, suit, proceeding or investigation or such Person
otherwise consents.

(d) This  _Section 6.05_ is intended to be for the benefit of, and shall be
enforceable by, each of the Indemnified Parties and their respective heirs and
legal representatives. The rights provided for herein shall not be deemed
exclusive of any other rights to which an Indemnified Party is entitled,
whether pursuant to Law, contract or otherwise.

(e) In the event that Parent, the Surviving Company or the Surviving
Partnership or any of their respective successors or assigns (i) consolidates
with or merges into any other Person and is not the continuing or surviving
company or entity of such consolidation or merger or (ii) transfers or
conveys all or substantially all of its properties and assets to any Person,
or if Parent dissolves or dissolves the Surviving Company or the Surviving
Partnership is dissolved then, and in each such case, Parent shall cause the
successors and assigns of Parent, the

 



-69-  Surviving Company or the Surviving Partnership, as applicable, to assume the
obligations of Parent, the Surviving Company or the Surviving Partnership, as
applicable, set forth in this  _Section 6.05_.

(f) Parent shall pay all reasonable expenses, including reasonable attorneys
fees, that may be incurred by any Indemnified Party in enforcing the
indemnity, advancement and other obligations provided in this _Section 6.05_;
_provided_ , _however_ , that such Indemnified Party provides an undertaking
to repay such expenses if it is determined by a final and non-appealable
judgment of a court of competent jurisdiction that such Indemnified Party is
not legally entitled to indemnification under Law.

 

6.06 _Rule 16b-3 Matters_. Prior to the Partnership Merger Effective Time, the
Company and Parent shall, as applicable, take all actions, if any, as may be
reasonably necessary or appropriate to ensure that any dispositions of Company
Common Stock or acquisitions of Parent Common Stock, or dispositions of

each case any derivative securities thereof) pursuant to the Transactions by
any individual who is subject to Section 16 of the Exchange Act with respect
to the Company or the Company OP are exempt under Rule 16b-3 promulgated under
the Exchange Act. Upon request, the Company shall promptly furnish Parent
with all requisite information for Parent to take the actions contemplated by

release to be issued with respect to the Merger shall be in the form
heretofore agreed upon by the parties hereto. Except in connection with an
Adverse Recommendation Change, so long as this Agreement is in effect, Parent
or Parent OP, on the one hand, and the Company and the Company OP, on the
other hand, shall consult with each other before issuing, and provide each
other the opportunity to review and comment upon, any press release or other
public statements with respect to the Merger and the other Transactions, and
shall not issue any such press release or make any such public statement
prior to such consultation, except as may be required by applicable Law, court
process or obligations pursuant to the listing rules of any national
securities exchange.

preparation, execution and filing of all returns,
questionnaires, applications or other documents regarding any real property
transfer or gains, sales, use, transfer, value added, stock transfer or stamp
taxes, any transfer, recording, registration and other fees and any similar
taxes that become payable in connection with the transactions contemplated by
this Agreement (together with any related interests, penalties or additions to
Tax, " _Transfer Taxes_ "), and shall cooperate in attempting to minimize the
amount of Transfer Taxes. From and after the Effective Time, the Surviving
Company shall pay or cause to be paid all Transfer Taxes.

6.09  _Stockholder Litigation_. The Company shall give prompt notice to
Parent of and keep Parent reasonably informed on a current basis with respect
to, and Parent shall give prompt notice to the Company of and keep the Company
reasonably informed on a current basis with respect to, any claim, action,
suit, charge, demand, inquiry, subpoena, proceeding, arbitration, mediation or
other investigation commenced or, to such partys Knowledge, threatened
against, relating to or involving such party or the Company OP or Parent OP,
respectively, which relate

 



-70-  to this Agreement, the Merger or the other Transactions. The Company shall
give Parent the opportunity to reasonably participate in (but not control),
subject to a customary joint defense agreement, the defense and settlement of
any stockholder litigation (including arbitration proceedings) against the

Parent OP or any Parent Subsidiary and/or any of their respective directors
relating to this Agreement and the transactions contemplated hereby, and no
such settlement shall be agreed to without the Companys prior written consent
(which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed).

6.10 _Financing_.

 

(a) Parent, with the cooperation of the Company as provided in _Section
6.10(c)_, shall use its reasonable best efforts to take, or cause to be
taken, all actions and to do, or cause to be done, all things necessary,
proper or advisable to (i) maintain in effect, from the date hereof through
the earlier of the Closing and the termination of this Agreement, the
availability to Parent of the Financing and the effectiveness of the
Commitment Letter, (ii) to obtain and consummate the Financing on terms and
conditions substantially similar to the Commitment Letter, and (iii) to obtain
and consummate any Alternative Financing (as defined below). Parent shall
give the Company prompt notice after becoming aware of any material breach or
default (or any event or circumstance that would reasonably be expected to
result in a breach or default) of any partys obligations under the
Commitment Letter. If, notwithstanding the use by Parent of its reasonable
best efforts (with the cooperation of the Company as provided in _Section
6.10(c)_) to consummate the Financing, any portion of the Financing does not
become available in the manner or from the sources contemplated in the
Commitment Letter and such portion is reasonably required in order for Parent
to satisfy all of Parents obligations under this Agreement, including the
payment of any amounts required to be paid by Parent pursuant to _Article II_
and of all fees and expenses required to be paid by Parent and reasonably
expected to be incurred in connection herewith (the " _Necessary Financing_

alternative financing from alternative sources on terms and conditions
reasonably acceptable to Parent in an amount such that the aggregate funds
together with other financial resources of Parent, including any remaining
portion of the Financing and any other cash on hand, will be sufficient to
obtain the Necessary Financing and consummate the Transactions (the "
_Alternate Financing_ "), and Parent shall provide a true, correct and
complete copy of the documents relating to Alternative Financing to the
Company.

(b) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this _Section 6.10_, the
provisions of _Section 6.10_ shall not limit in any manner the ability of the
Company or Parent to terminate this Agreement in accordance with  _Section
8.01(b)(i)_ or _Section 8.01(b)(ii)_ or the Company to terminate this
Agreement in accordance with _Section 8.01(k)_, in each case as a result of a
Financing Failure, and the sole remedy for any such termination described in
_Section 8.03(b)(iv)_ shall be the payment by Parent of the Parent
Termination Fee.

 



-71- (c) Prior to the Closing, the Company agrees to provide, and shall cause the
Company Subsidiaries and its and their officers, directors, employees,
accountants, consultants, legal counsel, agents and other representatives to

Specified Existing Debt, (B) unrestricted offers, sales, issuances,
transfers, conversions, redemptions and repurchases of common equity or
preferred equity of Parent and Parent OP, and (C) mergers, consolidations,

and/or Parent OP into, or with, one or more of their Subsidiaries

(v) with respect to the Designated Loans of the Designated Lenders set forth
on _Section 7.02(g)(i)_ of the Parent Disclosure Letter, obtain at the
request of Parent amendments to the loan documents applicable to such
Designated Loan to permit prepayment of such Designated Loan at any time on
or before the End Date with no increase in the prepayment fee or penalty
(whether or not labeled as such);

 

(vi) assisting Parent and its financing sources in obtaining the items
required by Sections (xiii) through (xix) of Schedule B to the Commitment
Letter (or similar items related to an alternate debt financing);

(vii) requesting customary payoff letters, lien terminations and instruments
of discharge to be delivered at Closing to allow for the payoff, discharge and
termination in full on the Closing Date of all indebtedness and liens under
the Specified Existing Debt to be extinguished on the Closing Date;

(viii) taking such actions as are reasonably requested by Parent or its
financing sources to facilitate the satisfaction on a timely basis of all
conditions precedent to obtaining the Financing;

(ix) using commercially reasonable efforts to cause its auditors to cooperate
with the Financing; and

(x) using its commercially reasonable efforts to ensure that the Financing
benefits from the existing lending relationships of the Company and the
Company Subsidiaries;

 



-72- _provided_ that (A) such requested cooperation does not unreasonably interfere
with the ongoing operations of the Company and the Company Subsidiaries and
(B) none of the Company or any of the Company Subsidiaries shall be required
to pay any commitment or other similar fee or incur any other liability in
connection with the Financing (other than its own reasonable out-of-pocket
costs; _provided_ that Parent shall, upon request by the Company, reimburse
the Company for all reasonable and documented out-of-pocket costs and expenses
(including reasonable and documented attorneys fees of one outside counsel)
incurred by the Company and the Company Subsidiaries solely and to the extent
in connection with the cooperation of the Company and the Company Subsidiaries
contemplated by this  _Section 6.10(c)_). The Company will provide, or cause
to be provided, to Parent and its financing sources such information as may be
necessary so that the Required Information and Marketing Material is complete
and correct in all material respects and does not and will not contain any
untrue statement of a material fact or omit to state a material fact necessary
to make the statements contained therein, in light of the circumstances under
which such statements are made, not misleading. The Company hereby consents
to the use of all of its and the Company Subsidiaries logos in connection
with the Financing. Parent agrees that the execution by the Company or any of
the Company Subsidiaries of any documents in connection with the financing
for the transactions contemplated by this Agreement will be subject to the
consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby at the Closing and such
documents will not take effect prior thereto.

 

6.11 _Certain Tax Matters_.

 

(a) Each of Parent and the Company shall use its reasonable best efforts to
cause the Company Merger to qualify as a reorganization within the meaning of
Section 368(a) of the Code, including by executing and delivering the
officers certificates referred to herein and reporting consistently for all
federal, state, and local income Tax or other purposes, _provided_ , 
_however_ , that this sentence shall not restrict the right of Parent with
respect to elections made with respect to the consideration to be provided in
the Company Merger as provided in this Agreement. Neither Parent nor the
Company shall take any action, or fail to take any action, other than actions
anticipated by his Agreement, that would reasonably be expected to cause the
Company Merger to fail to qualify as a reorganization within the meaning of
Section 368(a) of the Code. Provided that the tax opinions referenced in
_Section 7.02(e)_ and _Section 7.03(e)_ have been provided, unless there has
been a "determination" (within the meaning of Section 1313(a) of the Code) to
the contrary, each of Parent, the Company and the Company stockholders shall
report the Company Merger as a reorganization within the meaning of Section
368(a) of the Code, with no gain or loss recognized by the Company or any
Company stockholder for federal income tax purposes, except with respect to
any cash received by or paid to the Company stockholders.

(b) Each of Parent and the Company shall use its reasonable best efforts to
cause the Partnership Merger to be treated as an "asset-over" form of merger
governed by Treasury Regulations Section 1.708-1(c)(3)(i), with Parent OP
being a continuation of Company OP for federal income tax purposes.

6.12 _401(k) Plan_. The Company shall take any and all actions necessary to
terminate the Companys 401(k) Plan effective immediately before the Closing.
The Company shall provide Parent with evidence that the 401(k) Plan has been
terminated (effective no later than immediately before the Closing) pursuant
to appropriate resolutions and any other necessary corporate action.

 



-73- 6.13 _Pre-Closing Dividends_.

 

(a) From and after the date of this Agreement and until the earlier of the
termination of this Agreement and the Effective Time, the Company shall not
make any dividend or distribution to its stockholders, and the Company OP
shall not make any dividend or distribution to its partners, in each case
without the prior written consent of Parent in its sole discretion; _provided_
,  _however_ , that the written consent of Parent shall not be required for
the authorization and payment of (i) distributions required for the Company to
maintain its status as a REIT under the Code, (ii) quarterly distributions of
up to $0.095 per share of Company Common Stock to the holders thereof for the
quarter ending June 30, 2015 and for each quarter thereafter ending prior to
the Effective Time and for each partial quarter ending on the Effective Time;
_provided_ ,  _however_ , that the record date of any such dividend must be
on or before the date which is ten (10) days prior to the Closing Date, and
(iii) a distribution per Company OP Unit in the same amount as a dividend per
share of Company Common Stock permitted pursuant to clauses (i) or (ii)
above, with the same record and payment dates as such dividends on shares of

9.04 _Interpretation; Exhibits and Disclosure Letters_. The table of contents
and headings contained in this Agreement or in any Exhibit hereto, the
Company Disclosure Letter or the Parent Disclosure Letter are for reference
purposes only and shall not affect the meaning or interpretation of this
Agreement. Any capitalized terms used in any Exhibit, the Company Disclosure
Letter or the Parent Disclosure Letter, but not otherwise defined therein,
shall have the meaning as defined in this Agreement. When a reference is made
in this Agreement to an Article, Section or Exhibit, such reference shall be
to a Section or Article of, or an Exhibit to, this Agreement unless otherwise
indicated. Whenever the words "include", "includes" or "including" are used in
this Agreement, they shall be deemed to be followed by the words "without
limitation". The words "hereof", "hereto", "hereby", "herein" and "hereunder"
and

 



-96-  words of similar import when used in this Agreement shall refer to this
Agreement as a whole and not to any particular provision of this Agreement.
The term "or" has the inclusive meaning frequently identified with the phrase
"and/or". The word "extent" in the phrase "to the extent" shall mean the
degree to which a subject or other thing extends, and such phrase shall not
mean simply "if". The definitions contained in this Agreement are applicable
to the singular as well as the plural forms of such terms. Any item disclosed
in any Section of the Company Disclosure Letter or the Parent Disclosure
Letter whose relevance or applicability to any representation or warranty
made elsewhere in this Agreement is reasonably apparent from the text of the
disclosure made shall be deemed to be disclosed with respect to such Sections
of such Company Disclosure Letter or Parent Disclosure Letter, as applicable,
relating to such representation or warranty, notwithstanding the omission of a
reference or cross-reference thereto. Any agreement or instrument defined or
referred to herein or in any agreement or instrument that is referred to
herein means such agreement or instrument as from time to time amended,
modified or supplemented. References to a Person are also to its permitted
successors and assigns. References to matters disclosed in the Filed Company
SEC Documents or the Filed Parent SEC Documents are made without giving
effect to any amendment to any such Filed Company SEC Document or Filed Parent
SEC Document that is filed on or after the date hereof and exclude any
disclosures set forth in any risk factor section, sections relating to
forward looking statements and any other disclosures included in such Filed
Company SEC Documents or Filed Parent SEC Documents that constitute
predictive, cautionary or forward-looking statements.

 

9.05 _Severability_. If any term or other provision of this Agreement is
determined to be invalid, illegal or incapable of being enforced by any rule
or Law, or public policy, all other conditions and provisions of this
Agreement shall nevertheless remain in full force and effect so long as the
economic or legal substance of the Transactions is not affected in any manner
materially adverse to any party. Upon such determination that any term or
other provision is invalid, illegal or incapable of being enforced, the
parties hereto shall negotiate in good faith to modify this Agreement so as to
effect the original intent of the parties hereto as closely as possible in an
acceptable manner to the end that Transactions are fulfilled to the extent
possible.

9.06  _Counterparts_. This Agreement may be executed (including by facsimile
or email of a .pdf attachment) in one or more counterparts, each of which
shall be deemed an original, but all of which together shall constitute one
and the same instrument, it being understood that all parties need not sign
the same counterpart. It shall not be necessary in making proof of this
Agreement to produce or account for more than one such counterpart. The
parties hereto may deliver this Agreement and the other Transaction Documents
by facsimile or email of a .pdf attachment, and each party shall be permitted
to rely upon the signatures so transmitted to the same extent and effect as if
they were original signatures.

 

9.07 _Entire Agreement; No Third Party Beneficiaries_. This Agreement, taken
together with the Exhibits hereto, the Company Disclosure Letter, the Parent
Disclosure Letter and the Confidentiality Agreement, (a) constitute the entire
agreement, and supersede all prior agreements and understandings, both written
and oral, among the parties hereto with respect to the Transactions and (b)
except for (i) _Section 6.05_ , (ii) only with respect to holders of record
of the Company Common Stock immediately prior to the Effective Time, and only
after the Effective Time, for the provisions set forth in _Article II_ ,
(iii) only with respect to holders of Company Restricted Stock immediately
prior to the Effective Time, and only at and after the

 



-97-  Effective Time, for the provisions set forth in _Section 2.05_, and (iv)
only with respect to holders of record of the Company OP Units immediately
prior to the Partnership Merger Effective Time, and only after the
Partnership Merger Effective Time, for the provisions set forth in _Article
II_ , are not intended to confer upon any Person other than the parties hereto
any rights or remedies, whether as third-party beneficiaries or otherwise;
_provided_ , _however_ , that the Company shall be entitled to pursue damages
on behalf of its stockholders as provided in _Section 9.13(b)_.
Notwithstanding the immediately preceding sentence, following the Effective
Time, the Financing Sources are express third party beneficiaries of, and may
enforce, the provisions of _Sections 8.04_ , _8.07_ , _9.08_ , _9.09_ , _9.10_
, _9.11_ and _9.13(d)_ and this  _Section 9.07_.

9.08 _Governing Law_. This Agreement shall be governed by, and construed in
accordance with, the Laws of the State of Maryland, without giving effect to
any choice or conflict of Laws provision or rule (whether of the State of
Maryland or any other jurisdiction) that would cause the application of the
Laws of any jurisdiction other than the State of Maryland; _provided_ ,
_however_ , that the (i) Partnership Merger and the Company Merger shall be
governed by the Laws of the State of Delaware and (ii) all disputes or
controversies arising out of or relating to this Agreement or the
Transactions (whether in law, contract, tort, equity or otherwise), in each
case, to the extent relating to the Commitment Letter or the Financing Sources
shall be governed by, and construed in accordance with, the Laws of the State
of New York.

9.09 _Jurisdiction; Venue_. All proceedings arising out of or relating to this
Agreement shall be heard and determined exclusively in the Circuit Court for
Baltimore City (Maryland), or, if under applicable Law exclusive jurisdiction
over the matter is vested in the federal courts, any federal court located in
the State of Maryland (the " _Maryland Court_ "). Each of the Parties hereby
irrevocably and unconditionally agrees to request and/or consent to the
assignment of any such proceeding to the Maryland Courts Business and
Technology Case Management Program. Each of the Parties hereby irrevocably
and unconditionally (a) consents and submits to the exclusive jurisdiction of
the Maryland Court for the purpose of any proceeding brought by any party
arising out of or relating to this Agreement, (b) agrees not to commence any
such action or proceeding except in the Maryland Court, (c) irrevocably
submits itself to the personal jurisdiction of the Maryland Court in any
proceeding arising out of or relating to this Agreement, (d) agrees that
it will not attempt to deny or defeat such personal jurisdiction by motion or
other request for leave from any such court, (e) waives, to the fullest extent
it may legally and effectively do so, any objection which it may now or
hereafter have to venue of any such action or proceeding in the Maryland
Court, and (f) waives, to the fullest extent permitted by Law, the defense of
an inconvenient forum to the maintenance of such action or proceeding in the
Maryland Court. Each Party irrevocably consents to service of process in the
manner provided for notices in _Section 9.02_. Nothing in this Agreement will
affect the right of any Party to serve process in any other manner permitted
by Law. Notwithstanding the foregoing, with respect to any disputes or
controversies arising out of or relating to this Agreement or the Transactions
(whether in law, contract, tort, equity or otherwise), in each case, to the
extent relating to the Commitment Letter or the Financing Sources, each of
the parties hereto (a) consents to submit itself to the personal jurisdiction
of any Federal court located in the State of New York or, if such Federal
courts do not have subject matter jurisdiction, of any New York state court
in the case of any such dispute or controversy, (b) agrees that it will not
attempt to deny or defeat such personal jurisdiction by motion or other
request for leave from any such court, (c) agrees that it 

 



-98-  will not bring any action relating to any such matter in any court other
than any Federal court sitting in the State of New York or any New York state
court, and (d) waives any right to trial by jury with respect to any action
related to or arising out of any such matter.

9.10 _WAIVER OF JURY TRIAL_. EACH OF THE PARTIES HERETO ACKNOWLEDGES AND
AGREES THAT ANY CONTROVERSY WHICH MAY ARISE OUT OF OR RELATING TO THIS
AGREEMENT IS LIKELY TO INVOLVE COMPLICATED AND DIFFICULT ISSUES, AND THEREFORE
EACH SUCH PARTY HEREBY IRREVOCABLY AND UNCONDITIONALLY WAIVES, TO THE FULLEST
EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW, ANY RIGHT SUCH PARTY MAY HAVE TO A TRIAL
BY JURY IN ANY ACTION, PROCEEDING OR COUNTERCLAIM (WHETHER BASED ON CONTRACT,
TORT OR OTHERWISE), DIRECTLY OR INDIRECTLY, ARISING OUT OF OR RELATING
TO THIS AGREEMENT OR THE TRANSACTIONS, OR THE ACTIONS OF THE PARTIES HERETO
IN THE NEGOTIATION, ADMINISTRATION, PERFORMANCE AND ENFORCEMENT THEREOF. EACH
OF THE PARTIES HERETO CERTIFIES AND ACKNOWLEDGES THAT (A) NO REPRESENTATIVE,
AGENT OR ATTORNEY OF ANY OTHER PARTY HAS REPRESENTED, EXPRESSLY OR OTHERWISE,
THAT SUCH OTHER PARTY WOULD NOT, IN THE EVENT OF LITIGATION, SEEK TO ENFORCE
THE FOREGOING WAIVER, (B) EACH SUCH PARTY UNDERSTANDS AND HAS CONSIDERED THE
IMPLICATIONS OF THIS WAIVER, (C) EACH SUCH PARTY MAKES THIS WAIVER
VOLUNTARILY, AND (D) EACH SUCH PARTY HAS BEEN INDUCED TO ENTER INTO THIS
AGREEMENT BY, AMONG OTHER THINGS, THE MUTUAL WAIVERS AND CERTIFICATIONS IN
THIS _SECTION 9.10_.

 

9.11 _Assignment_. Neither this Agreement nor any of the rights, interests or
obligations under this Agreement shall be assigned, in whole or in part, by
operation of Law or otherwise by any of the parties hereto without the prior
written consent of the other parties hereto. Any purported assignment without
such consent shall be void. Notwithstanding the foregoing, Parent shall be
permitted, without the consent of any other party hereto, to make a collateral
assignment to any of any Lender or other Financing Source in connection with
obtaining the Necessary Financing (or any Alternate Financing); _provided_ ,
that no such assignment shall (i) relieve Parent of its obligations under
this Agreement, or (ii) enlarge, alter or change any obligation of any other
party hereto. Subject to the preceding sentences, this Agreement will be
binding upon, inure to the benefit of, and be enforceable by, the parties
hereto and their respective successors and assigns.

9.12 _Consents and Approvals_. For any matter under this Agreement requiring
the consent or approval of any party to be valid and binding on the parties
hereto, such consent or approval must be in writing and executed and delivered
to the other parties hereto by a Person duly authorized by such party to do
so.

9.13 _Enforcement_.

 

(a) The parties hereto agree that irreparable damage for which monetary and
other legal damages, even if available, would not be an adequate remedy would
occur in the event that the parties hereto do not perform their obligations
under the provisions of this Agreement

 



-99-  (including failing to take such actions as are required of them hereunder to
consummate the Merger and the other Transactions) in accordance with its
specified terms or otherwise breach any such provisions; _provided_ ,
_however_ , that in the event of a termination of this Agreement under
circumstances in which the Parent Termination Fee is paid, the Company will
not be entitled to seek or obtain a decree or order of specific performance
to enforce the observance or performance of, and will not be entitled to seek
or obtain an injunction restraining the breach of, or to seek or obtain
damages or any other remedy at law or in equity relating to any breach of, any
covenant or obligation of any of Parent, Parent OP, OP Merger Sub or IRT LP
LLC other than with respect to the payment of the Parent Termination Fee. The
parties shall be entitled to an injunction or injunctions, specific
performance or other equitable relief to prevent any breach or threatened
breach of any of the covenants or obligations under this Agreement and to
enforce specifically the terms and provisions hereof, without proof of damages
or otherwise. The parties hereto agree that such rights of specific
enforcement are an integral part of the Transactions and that, without such
rights, none of the parties hereto would have entered into this Agreement.

 

(b) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained herein, prior to a
valid termination of this Agreement pursuant to  _Article VIII_, (i) the
Company shall be entitled to seek and obtain an injunction, specific
performance and other equitable relief to prevent any breaches or threatened
breaches of this Agreement by Parent or Parent OP and to enforce specifically
the terms and provisions hereof, including Parents and Parent OPs
obligations to consummate the Merger and the other Transactions, and (ii)
Parent shall be entitled to seek and obtain an injunction, specific
performance and other equitable relief to prevent any breaches or threatened
breaches of this Agreement by the Company or Company OP and to enforce
specifically the terms and provisions hereof, including the Companys and
Company OPs obligations to consummate the Merger and the other Transactions.
Neither the commencement of any Legal Proceeding pursuant to this _Section
9.13_ nor anything else in this _Section 9.13_ shall restrict or limit the
Companys or Parents right to terminate this Agreement in accordance with
the terms of _Article VIII_ or (before or after any termination) to pursue any
other remedies under this Agreement, and nothing in this _Section 9.13_ or
elsewhere in this Agreement shall require the Company or Parent to institute
any proceedings for specific performance prior to or as a condition to
exercising any other right or remedy hereunder. Without limiting the
generality of the foregoing, any and all remedies herein conferred upon the
Company or Parent are cumulative and not exclusive of any other remedy
conferred hereby, or by law or equity upon the Company or Parent, and the
exercise by the Company or Parent of any one remedy will not preclude the
exercise of any other remedy.

(c) Each party hereto further agrees that it will not oppose the granting of
an injunction, specific performance and other equitable relief on the basis
that the other parties hereto have an adequate remedy at law or an award of
specific performance is not an appropriate remedy for any reason at law or in
equity. The parties hereto acknowledge and agree that any party seeking an
injunction or injunctions to prevent breaches of this Agreement and to enforce
specifically the terms and provisions of this Agreement shall not be required
to provide any bond or other security in connection with any such order or
injunction.

(d) Nothing contained in this Agreement shall require or otherwise obligate
Parent or any of its Affiliates to enforce specifically the terms and
provisions of the Commitment Letter.

 



-100- IN WITNESS WHEREOF, Parent, Parent OP, OP Merger Sub, IRT LP LLC, the Company
and Company OP have duly executed this Agreement as of the date first written
above.

Independence Realty Trust, Inc.

Cira Centre

2929 Arch St., 17th Floor

 

Philadelphia, PA 19104

Dear Sirs:

 

The undersigned, a holder of common stock of Trade Street Residential, Inc., a
Maryland corporation (the " _Company_ "), acknowledges that in connection
with the merger (the " _Merger_ ") of the Company with Independence Realty
Trust, Inc. (the " _IRT_ "), the undersigned will receive, as part of the
consideration for the undersigneds shares of common stock, par value $0.01
per share, of the Company, (the " _IRT Stock_ "). For good and valuable
consideration, the receipt and sufficiency of which are hereby acknowledged,
the undersigned agrees with IRT that, during the period beginning on the date
of the closing of the Merger (the " _Merger Closing Date_ "), and ending on
the Release Date (as defined below) (such period shall be the " _Lock-
Up Period_ "), the undersigned will not, without the prior written consent of
the IRT, on any single day during the Lock-Up Period, (i) directly or
indirectly, offer, sell, contract to sell, sell any option or contract to
purchase, purchase any option or contract to sell, grant any option, right or
warrant to purchase or otherwise transfer or dispose of shares of the IRT
Stock or any securities convertible into or exercisable or exchangeable for
IRT Stock, whether now owned or hereafter acquired by the undersigned or with
respect to which the undersigned has or hereafter acquires the power of
disposition (collectively, the " _Lock-Up Securities_ "), in excess of the
Daily Limit (as defined below), (ii) enter into any swap or any other
agreement or any transaction that transfers, in whole or in part, directly or
indirectly, the economic consequence of ownership of the Lock-Up Securities in
excess of the Daily Limit, whether any such swap or transaction is to be
settled by delivery of IRT Stock or other securities, in cash or otherwise, or
(iii) publicly announce any intention to do any of the foregoing.

 

The " _Release Date_ " shall mean the date that is 180 days after the Merger
Closing Date, _provided, however_ , that if IRT closes an underwritten public
offering of IRT Stock (a " _Public Offering_ ") during the period beginning on
the date of this letter agreement and ending on the date that is 90 days after
the Merger Closing Date, the Release Date shall be the date that is 90 days
after the closing date of such Public Offering. The " _Daily Limit_ " shall
mean, for any particular date, 25% of the average daily trading volume of IRT
Stock (excepting any volume resulting from the closing of a Public Offering)
during the four weeks prior to the date on which the Daily Limit is being
calculated.

 

Notwithstanding the foregoing, and subject to the conditions below, the
undersigned may transfer the Lock-Up Securities in excess of the Daily Limit
without the prior written consent of IRT (i) as a distribution to limited
partners, general partners, members or stockholders of the undersigned, (ii)
pursuant to any "block trade" or "block sale," including as such term is as
defined in Rule 10b-18 under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended,
through an intermediary or otherwise; _provided_ that such sales are not in
excess of the Daily Limit during the Lock-Up Period, (iii) establishing a
trading plan pursuant to Rule 10b5-1 under the Exchange Act for the transfer
of common shares of IRT Stock, _provided_ that such plan does not provide for
the transfer of common shares of IRT Stock in excess of the Daily Limit
during the Lock-Up Period, (iv) to the undersigneds affiliates or to any
investment fund or other entity controlled or managed by the undersigned, (v)
pursuant to a will, other testamentary document or applicable laws
of descent, or (vi) in response to a bona fide third party take-over bid made
to all holders of common shares of IRT Stock or any other acquisition
transaction whereby all or substantially all of the common shares of IRT Stock
are acquired by a bona fide third party, which transaction was approved by
the board of directors of IRT; provided that in the case of any transfer or
distribution pursuant to clauses (i), (iii), (iv) and (v), (1) IRT receive a
signed agreement with terms   similar to this letter agreement for the balance of the Lock-Up Period from
each distributee, or transferee, as the case may be, (2) any such transfer
shall not involve a disposition for value, (3) such transfers are not
required to be reported with the Securities and Exchange Commission, and (4)
the undersigned does not otherwise voluntarily effect any public filing or
report regarding such transfers; _provided further_ that in the case clause
(vi), if such take-over bid or other acquisition transaction is unsuccessful,
such common shares of IRT Stock may not be transferred until after the
expiration of the Lock-Up Period.

 

The undersigned also agrees and consents to the entry of stop transfer
instructions with the IRTs transfer agent and registrar against the transfer
of the Lock-Up Securities in violation of this letter agreement.

The undersigned hereby represents and warrants that the undersigned has full
power and authority to enter into this letter agreement and that this letter
agreement has been duly authorized, executed and delivered by the undersigned
and is a valid and binding agreement of the undersigned.

 

IRT hereby represents and warrants and covenants and agrees that any agreement
entered into by IRT with any person with respect to restrictions similar to
those set forth in this Agreement in connection with the Merger will be in
form and substance identical to this Agreement.

 

Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary if the agreement pursuant to
which the Merger shall be conducted (the " _Merger Agreement_ ") shall
terminate or be terminated prior to the Merger closing, then the undersigned
shall be released from all obligations under this letter agreement upon the
date of such termination of the Merger Agreement.

 

This letter agreement shall be governed by the laws of the State of New York.       |  |
