month of the Seller in which the conditions precedent to the Initial Closing
listed in _Article 6_ shall have been satisfied or, if permissible, waived
(other than those conditions that are by their nature to be satisfied by
action taken at the Initial Closing, but subject to the satisfaction of such
conditions at the Initial Closing) (the date of the Initial Closing, the "
_Initial Closing Date_ "); _provided_ , _however_ , at its sole discretion,
the Seller may direct that the Initial Closing shall take place earlier than
the fiscal month end of the Seller on any Business Day specified by the
Seller to the Purchaser on no less than three (3) Business Days written
notice to the Purchaser; _provided_ _further_ , that notwithstanding the

Marketing Period has not ended at the time of the satisfaction or waiver of
such conditions (other than those conditions that are by their nature to be

Initial Closing Date as a result of the non-satisfaction or waiver of
all conditions set forth in _Article 6_ to the transfer of any of the
Acquired Assets or assumption of any of the Assumed Liabilities (other than
those conditions that are to be satisfied by action taken at such closing),
from time to time after the Initial Closing, as soon as reasonably
practicable on the last day of a fiscal month of the Seller in which the
conditions precedent to an Additional Closing listed in _Article 6_ shall have
been satisfied or, if permissible, waived (other than those conditions that
are to be satisfied by action taken at the Additional Closing, but subject to
the satisfaction or waiver of such conditions at the Additional Closing),
unless the parties mutually agree on a different date (including as may be
specified in a Local Asset Transfer Agreement), the parties shall hold

assuming such Assumed Liabilities. The effective time of each Additional
Closing for tax, accounting, operational and all other matters will be deemed
to be 11:59 p.m., local time, on the date of such Additional Closing.

applicable Laws and Orders, the Seller and the Purchaser shall use their
respective Reasonable Efforts to establish arrangements and, if necessary,
enter into one or more agreements with respect to the Remaining Assets which,
following the Initial Closing and any subsequent Closing, result in the
Purchaser Group receiving all the benefits and bearing all the costs,
liabilities and burdens with respect to the Remaining Assets. The Seller and
the Purchaser shall cooperate in good faith prior to the

reasonably may request of the other party to ensure that, to the greatest
extent permitted by applicable Laws and Orders, following the Initial

request of the Purchaser, and subject to applicable Laws and Orders,

reasonable detail, the Sellers good faith estimate of the Closing Working
Capital (and the components thereof) as of the month-end of the Seller prior
to the Initial Closing Date (the " _Estimated Closing Working Capital_ ") and
the amount, if any, by which the Purchase Price is to be adjusted in
accordance with the terms of this Agreement. The amount, if any, by which the
Estimated Closing Working Capital exceeds the Target Closing Working Capital
is referred to herein as the " _Estimated Closing Working Capital Surplus_."
The amount, if any, by which the Estimated Closing Working Capital is
less than the Target Closing Working Capital is referred to herein as the "
_Estimated Closing Working Capital Deficiency_."

(b) Not less than five (5) Business Days prior to the anticipated Initial
Closing Date, the Seller shall prepare and deliver to the Purchaser a
certificate (the " _Closing Cash Certificate_ " and, together with the Closing
Working Capital Certificate, the " _Closing Certificates_ ") setting forth,
in reasonable detail, the Sellers good faith estimate of the Closing Cash as
of the month-end of the Seller prior to the Initial Closing Date (the "
_Estimated Closing Cash_ ") and the amount, if any, by which the Purchase
Price is to be adjusted in accordance with the terms of this Agreement.

 

(c) The Closing Certificates and their respective components (including the
Estimated Closing Working Capital, the Estimated Closing Working Capital
Surplus, the Estimated Closing Working Capital Deficiency and the Estimated
Closing Cash) and all determinations and calculations contained therein shall
be prepared in accordance with GAAP and using the same principles, policies
and methodologies used in preparing the Audited



MASTER ACQUISITION AGREEMENT

 



13  Financial Statements, _provided_ , that the Closing Certificates shall not
have footnotes or other audit disclosures and shall be subject to normal year-
end adjustments which, individually and in the aggregate, are not material.

2.5 _Post-Closing Adjustment_.

 

(a) As soon as reasonably practicable after the Initial Closing Date (but in
any event within one hundred five (105) days after the Initial Closing Date),
the Purchaser shall prepare and deliver to the Seller a statement (the "
_Closing Statement_ ") setting forth, in reasonable detail, the Purchasers
calculation of (i) the Closing Working Capital (the " _Final Closing Working
Capital_ ") and (ii) Closing Cash (the " _Final Closing Cash_ "), in each
case, as of 11:59 pm Central time on the Initial Closing Date. The amount, if
any, by which the Final Closing Working Capital, as determined in accordance
with this _Section 2.5_, exceeds or is less than the Target Closing Working
Capital, is referred to herein as the " _Final Closing Working Capital
Surplus_ " or " _Final Closing Working Capital Deficiency_ ," respectively.
The Closing Statement shall be prepared in accordance with GAAP and using the
same principles, policies and methodologies used in preparing the Audited
Financial Statements, _provided_ , that the Closing Statement shall not have
footnotes or other audit disclosures and shall be subject to normal year-end

Statement to the Seller, the Purchaser shall provide the Seller
with reasonable access to all books and records and personnel of the
Purchaser and each of its subsidiaries (including the Acquired Companies) to
enable the Seller to evaluate the accuracy of the Closing Statement. If the
Seller disagrees with the determination of any component of the Closing
Statement calculations, then the Seller shall notify the Purchaser in writing
(an " _Objection Notice_ ") of such disagreement within sixty (60) days after
delivery of the Closing Statement, which Objection Notice shall describe the
nature of any such disagreement in reasonable detail. If the Seller does not
deliver an Objection Notice within such sixty (60)-day period, then the
Closing Statement and the calculations of the Final Closing Working Capital
and the Final Closing Cash set forth therein shall be conclusive and binding
upon the parties.

(c) If the Purchaser and the Seller are unable to resolve all disagreements
properly identified by the Seller pursuant to _Section 2.5(b)_ within thirty
(30) days after delivery to the Purchaser of the Objection Notice, then such
disagreements shall be resolved by Deloitte LLP (the " _Independent
Accounting Firm_ "), and such determination shall be final and binding on the
parties. If Deloitte LLP shall not be willing to serve as the Independent
Accounting Firm, then the Seller and the Purchaser shall each submit to the
other partys independent auditor the name of a national accounting firm other
than Ernst and Young LLP, KPMG LLP, and Deloitte LLP, and the Independent
Accounting Firm shall be selected by lot from these two firms by the
independent auditors of the two parties. In calculating the Closing Statement,
the Independent Accounting Firms calculations shall be no greater than the
higher amount calculated by the Seller or the Purchaser with respect to any
item, and no less than the lower amount calculated by the Seller or the
Purchaser with respect to any item, as the case may be. Any fees and expenses
relating to the engagement of the Independent Accounting Firm in respect of
its services pursuant to this _Section 2.5(c)_ shall be allocated between the
Seller and the Purchaser such that the amount paid by the Seller bears the
same proportion that the aggregate dollar amount

 



MASTER ACQUISITION AGREEMENT

 



14  unsuccessfully disputed by the Seller bears to the total dollar amount of
the disputed items that were submitted for resolution to the Independent
Accounting Firm, and the Purchaser shall pay the balance. The Independent
Accounting Firm shall be instructed to use Reasonable Efforts to perform its
services within thirty (30) days of submission of the dispute to it and, in
any case, as promptly as practicable after such submission. The Closing
Statement and the Final Closing Working Capital and Final Closing Cash
reflected thereon shall then be prepared by the parties based on the
determination of the Independent Accounting Firm, whose determination shall be
conclusive and binding upon the parties.

(d) If any of the Final Closing Working Capital or the Final Closing Cash as
finally determined pursuant to this  _Section 2.5_ differs from the
corresponding estimated figures set forth in the Closing Certificates and used
in the calculation of the Closing Purchase Price Payment paid at the Initial
Closing, then the Closing Purchase Price Payment shall be recalculated using
such final figures in lieu of such estimated figures and the following
adjustment (the " _Post-Closing Adjustment_ ") to the Closing Purchase Price
Payment shall be made:

 

(i) If the Closing Purchase Price Payment based on the Final Closing Working
Capital and/or the Final Closing Cash would have been greater than the
estimated Closing Purchase Price Payment actually paid at the Initial Closing,
the Purchaser shall pay, or cause to be paid, to the Seller the amount of such
difference.

 

(ii) If the Closing Purchase Price Payment based on the Final Closing Working
Capital and/or the Final Closing Cash would have been less than the estimated
Closing Purchase Price Payment actually paid at the Initial Closing, the
Seller shall pay, or cause to be paid, to the Purchaser the amount of such
difference.

 

(iii) The Purchaser or the Seller, as the case may be, shall, within two (2)
Business Days after the final determination of the Final Closing Working
Capital and Final Closing Cash in accordance with this _Section 2.5_, make
payment to the other by wire transfer in immediately available funds of the
amount of the Post-Closing Adjustment as determined pursuant to the preceding
subsections, together with interest thereon from the Initial Closing Date to
the date of payment at a fixed rate equal to six percent (6%) per annum. Such
interest shall be calculated based on a year of 365 days and the number of
days elapsed since the Initial Closing Date.

29 ARTICLE 4

 

REPRESENTATIONS AND WARRANTIES OF THE PURCHASER

 

Except as specifically set forth in, or qualified by any matter set forth in,
the disclosure schedules, dated as of the date of this Agreement and
delivered by the Purchaser to the Seller (collectively, the " _Purchaser
Disclosure Schedule_ ") (it being agreed that the disclosure of any matter in
any section or subsection in the Purchaser Disclosure Schedule shall be deemed
to have been disclosed in any other section or subsection in the Purchaser
Disclosure Schedule to which the applicability of such disclosure is
reasonably apparent on the face of such disclosure), the Purchaser represents
and warrants to the Seller as follows:

4.1 _Corporate Organization_. The Purchaser is, and each member of the
Purchaser Group will be at each applicable Closing, a Business Entity duly
incorporated or organized, validly existing, and, to the extent applicable in
its jurisdiction of incorporation or organization, in good standing under the
laws of its jurisdiction of incorporation or organization, and has full power
and authority to carry on its business as now conducted. Each member of the
Purchaser Group is, or as of the applicable Closing will be, in all respects
duly qualified as necessary to conduct the Business following the applicable
Closing Date and, to the extent legally applicable, is, or as of the
applicable Closing will be, in good standing under the Laws of each
jurisdiction in which the Business is conducted, except where the failure to
be so qualified or in good standing would not reasonably be expected to have
a Purchaser Material Adverse Effect.

4.2 _Authorization_. The Purchaser has, and each other member of the
Purchaser Group will have at the applicable Closing, all power and authority
it requires to execute, consummate the transactions contemplated by and
perform its respective obligations under the Transaction Agreements to which
it is a party. Each member of the Purchaser Group has obtained, or will have
obtained prior to the applicable Closing Date, all organizational approvals
necessary for the due and valid authorization of its execution, delivery and
performance of the Transaction Agreements to which it is a party and the
consummation by it of the Contemplated Transactions, as applicable. The
Purchaser has duly and validly executed and delivered the Principal Agreements
and, on or prior to the applicable Closing, each member of the Purchaser
Group will have duly and validly executed and delivered the other Transaction
Agreements to which it is a party. Assuming the due authorization, execution
and delivery of the Transaction Agreements by the other parties thereto, the
Principal Agreements are, and at each applicable Closing each other
Transaction Agreement will be, a valid and binding obligation of each member
of the Purchaser Group that is a party hereto or thereto, as applicable,
enforceable against such member of the Purchaser Group in accordance with its
terms, subject, as to enforceability, to (a) Laws of general application
relating to bankruptcy, insolvency, fraudulent conveyance, preferential
transfers or the relief of debtors, and (b) Laws governing specific
performance, injunctive relief and other equitable remedies or general
principles of equity.

 

4.3 _No Conflict_. Except for the requirements of the HSR Act and any
Antitrust Laws of jurisdictions outside the United States of America (if and
to the extent any of the foregoing Laws may apply), the execution, delivery
and performance by each member of the Purchaser Group of the Transaction
Agreements to which it is a party and/or the consummation by each such member
of the Purchaser Group of the Contemplated Transactions, as applicable, do
not and will not, as applicable, (a) conflict with or violate any provision of
the Purchasers certificate of incorporation or bylaws (or the equivalent
organizational documents of the applicable member of the Purchaser Group),
each as amended to date, (b) require any member of the Purchaser Group to make
any filing with any Governmental Entity or obtain any material Governmental
Authorization, except where the failure to obtain such Governmental
Authorization or to make such filing would not prevent or materially delay the
consummation by the Purchaser Group of the Contemplated Transactions or the
performance by the Purchaser Group of any of its material obligations under
the Transaction Agreements or as may be necessary as a result of any facts or
circumstances relating to the Seller or its Affiliates), (c) result in a
breach or default under, create

 



MASTER ACQUISITION AGREEMENT

 



30  in any Person the right to accelerate, terminate, modify or cancel, or
require any prior notice, consent or waiver under, any material agreement or
instrument to which the Purchaser or one of its Affiliates is a party, in any
case with or without due notice or lapse of time or both, or (d) violate any
material Law or Order applicable to the Purchaser Group.

 

4.4 _Legal Proceedings_. There is no Legal Proceeding pending or, to the
Knowledge of the Purchaser, threatened by or against any member of the
Purchaser Group that questions or challenges the validity of this Agreement or
the ability of the Purchaser Group to consummate any of the Contemplated
Transactions.

 

4.5 _Available Financing_.

 

(a) The Purchaser has delivered to the Seller a true, correct and complete
copy of the executed Debt Commitment Letter. The Debt Commitment Letter and
the commitments thereunder are in full force and effect on the date hereof,
have not been amended or modified or withdrawn, waived or rescinded except as
permitted hereby and, as of the date hereof, (i) there is no breach or
default existing (or which with notice or lapse of time or otherwise may
exist) thereunder and (ii) the Purchaser does not have any reason to believe
that any of the conditions to the Financing will not be satisfied or that the
Financing or any other funds necessary for the satisfaction of each of the
items described in the final sentence of this paragraph (a) will not be
available to the Purchaser on the Initial Closing Date. The Debt Commitment
Letter constitutes a legal, valid and binding obligation of the Purchaser
and, to the Knowledge of the Purchaser, the other parties thereto, in each
case except as such enforceability may be limited by applicable bankruptcy,
insolvency, reorganization, moratorium and other Laws affecting creditors
rights generally. Upon the funding of the Financing in accordance with and
subject to its terms and conditions, the aggregate proceeds of the Financing
plus unrestricted cash on hand as of the Initial Closing Date are sufficient
to satisfy the obligation to pay (A) the Closing Purchase Price Payment, (B)
all fees and expenses incurred by the Purchaser in connection with the
Contemplated Transactions that are due and payable and required to be paid
on the Initial Closing Date and (C) all other amounts (including refinancing
or repayment of any debt) required to be paid by the Purchaser Group on the
Initial Closing Date to consummate the Initial Closing (including the
transactions contemplated or required by the Debt Commitment Letter) (the sum
of clauses (A), (B) and (C) above, the " _Required Closing Amount_ ").

 

(b) Except as otherwise specifically set forth in the Debt Commitment Letter,
(i) there are no conditions precedent, "flex" provisions or other
contingencies to the obligations of the parties thereto to fund the Financing
contemplated by the Debt Commitment Letter; (ii) there are no contingencies
that would permit the parties thereto either to reduce the total amount of
the Financing contemplated by the Debt Commitment Letter or to impose any
additional conditions precedent or contingency to the availability of the
Financing contemplated by the Debt Commitment Letter; and (iii) there are no
side letters or other contracts or agreements that could impact the
availability of the financing or the commitment by the lenders under the Debt
Commitment Letter to provide the Financing, or the conditions, the "Certain
Funds" provisions, the "flex" provisions or the termination provisions of the
Debt Commitment Letter.

4.6 _Solvency_. The Purchaser is not entering into the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement with the actual intent to hinder, delay or
defraud either present or future creditors



 

MASTER ACQUISITION AGREEMENT

 



31  of the Purchaser or any of its subsidiaries. Assuming the satisfaction of
the conditions set forth in _Section 6.3_ to the Purchasers obligation to
consummate the Contemplated Transactions, the Purchaser and its subsidiaries
(on a consolidated basis) will be Solvent on a pro forma basis after giving
effect to the transactions contemplated hereby, including the Financing and
payment of all related fees and expenses. As used in this _Section 4.6_, the
term " _Solvent_ " means, with respect to any person as of a particular date,
that on such date, (a) the fair value of the assets (on a going concern basis)
of such person, on a consolidated basis, exceeds, on a consolidated basis,
its debts and liabilities, subordinated, contingent or otherwise; (b) the
present fair saleable value of the property (on a going concern basis) of such
person, on a consolidated basis, is greater than the amount that will be
required to pay the probable liability, on a consolidated basis, of its debts
and other liabilities, subordinated, contingent or otherwise, as such debts
and other liabilities become absolute and matured in the ordinary course of
business; (c) such person, on a consolidated basis, is able to pay its debts
and liabilities, subordinated, contingent or otherwise, as such liabilities
become absolute and matured in the ordinary course of business; and (d) such
person, on a consolidated basis, is not engaged in, and is not about to engage
in, business contemplated as of the date hereof for which it has unreasonably
small capital.

 

4.7 _Brokers  Fees_. No member of the Purchaser Group has any Liability to
pay any fees or commissions to any broker, finder or agent with respect to
the Contemplated Transactions except fees which will be borne entirely by the
Purchaser.

4.8 _Disclaimer of Other Representations and Warranties_. The Purchaser
acknowledges and agrees that, except for the representations and warranties
expressly set forth in this Agreement, neither the Seller nor any of its
Subsidiaries, nor any of their respective Affiliates or Representatives,
makes, or has made, any representation or warranty relating to itself or the
Business or otherwise in connection with the Contemplated Transactions, and
the Purchaser is not relying on any representation or warranty except for
those expressly set forth in the Principal Agreements. The Purchaser
acknowledges that it has conducted, to its satisfaction, its own independent
investigation of the condition, operations and business of the Business and,
in making its determination to proceed with the Contemplated Transactions,
the Purchaser has relied on the results of its own independent investigation.

 

ARTICLE 5

PRE-CLOSING COVENANTS

5.1 _Interim Operations_.

other Transaction Agreement, as required by applicable Law or Order, or as
set forth on _Schedule 5.1_ , the Acquired Companies and, with respect to the

Companies, including any Transferred Cash held in the Transferred Accounts,
prior to the Initial Closing), or (D) the renewal, extension or amendment for

favorable in the aggregate than existing on the date hereof of any Assumed
Real Property Lease in the Ordinary Course;

(vi) license, transfer, assign, or subject to any Encumbrance any Intellectual
Property constituting an Acquired Asset, except for non-exclusive licenses to

5.2 _Access to Information_. From the date of this Agreement until the Initial

expense and in accordance with the procedures to be agreed upon by

reasonable notice and during normal working hours to (a) such materials and
information about the Business as the Purchaser may reasonably request, and
(b) specified members of management of the Business as the parties may
reasonably agree. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Purchaser expressly
acknowledges and agrees that (i) during any period of regulatory review,
including pursuant to applicable Antitrust Laws, access to materials and
information about the Business will be limited as required by applicable Law
and Orders; and (ii) it will not, and will cause its Affiliates to not,

extent discussions with respect to the Contemplated Transactions with

any investigation undertaken pursuant to the access granted under this

affect the Purchasers right to rely upon, any of the representations,
warranties or covenants of the Seller or the indemnification rights of
the Purchaser contained in this Agreement. Notwithstanding anything to the
contrary in this Agreement, neither the Seller nor any of its Affiliates shall
be required to provide access to or disclose information where such access or
disclosure would jeopardize attorney-client privilege or contravene any
applicable Laws or Orders and counsel has so advised the Seller or its
Affiliates in writing, it being understood that the Seller shall use
Reasonable Efforts to allow for such access or disclosure (or as much of it

Acquired Company, on the one hand, and any member of the Seller Group, on the
other hand, shall be terminated (or deemed terminated without any action on
the part of any party), effective no later than as of the Initial

public disclosure it believes in good faith is required by applicable
securities Laws or securities listing standards, including the filing of this
Agreement with the SEC (in which case the disclosing party agrees to use
Reasonable Efforts to advise the other party prior to making
such disclosure). The parties agree that the initial press release to be
issued with respect to the Contemplated Transactions shall be in the form
mutually agreed to by the parties. Notwithstanding the foregoing, (i) to the
extent the content of any press release or other public statement has been
made in accordance with this _Section 5.5_, no separate approval shall be

part in any subsequent press release or other public statement, and (ii) the

Agreement or the Contemplated Transactions.

(b) Each party agrees to continue to abide by that certain Non-Disclosure
Agreement dated as of November 21, 2013 (the " _NDA_ "), the terms of which
are incorporated by reference in this Agreement and which terms will survive
until the Initial Closing, at which time the NDA will terminate with respect
to any Acquired Asset or Assumed Liability; _provided_ , _however_ , that if
this Agreement is, for any reason, terminated prior to the Initial Closing,
the NDA will continue in full force and effect. Except as contemplated by 
_subsection (a)_ hereof, the existence of this Agreement and the other
Transaction Agreements and the terms hereof and thereof (including the
exhibits and schedules appended hereto and thereto) will be deemed "
_Confidential Information_ " for purposes of the NDA.

MASTER ACQUISITION AGREEMENT

 



37 (b) Without limiting the generality of _Section 5.6(a)_, each of the Seller
and the Purchaser agrees to (i) as soon as practicable following the date of
this Agreement, but in no event later than the earlier of (A) the date legally
required for filing and (B) the tenth (10th) Business Day following the date
of execution and delivery of this Agreement (except as otherwise agreed by the
parties), file any notification and report forms and related material that it
may be required to file with the United States Federal Trade Commission and
the Antitrust Division of the United States Department of Justice under the
HSR Act and seek an early termination of the applicable waiting period,
and (ii) make, using Reasonable Efforts, any further filings or information
submissions that may be requested, necessary, proper or advisable pursuant to
the HSR Act. In addition, each party agrees to file with the applicable
Governmental Entity, as soon as reasonably practicable following the date of
this Agreement, any filings or similar information submissions required under
any other applicable United States federal or state or foreign statutes,
rules, regulations, Orders, administrative or judicial doctrines or other
Laws that are designed to prohibit, restrict or regulate actions having the
purpose or effect of monopolization or restraint of trade or constituting
anticompetitive conduct (collectively, together with the HSR Act, the "
_Antitrust Laws_ "). Each party will promptly notify the other party of any
material communication it or any of its Affiliates receives from any
Governmental Entity relating to the Contemplated Transactions, and will permit
the other party to review in advance, if possible, any proposed material
communication by such party to any Governmental Entity. Neither party will
agree to participate in any meeting with any Governmental Entity in respect of
any filings, investigation or other inquiry unless it consults with the other
party in advance and, to the extent permitted by such Governmental Entity,
gives the other party and/or its outside counsel the opportunity to attend and
participate at such meeting. The parties will coordinate and cooperate fully
with each other in exchanging such information and providing such assistance
as the other party may reasonably request in connection with the foregoing and
in seeking early termination of any applicable waiting periods, including
under the HSR Act. Each party will provide to counsel for the other party
copies of all material correspondence, material filings or material
communications between them or any of their Representatives, on the one hand,
and any Governmental Entity or members of its staff, on the other hand, with
respect to this Agreement and the Contemplated Transactions; distribution of
these materials may be limited to outside counsel only, upon reasonable
request of the providing party. 

(c) Notwithstanding any other provision in this _Section 5.6_ or elsewhere in
this Agreement, the Purchaser and the Seller will each pay one half of any
and all filing fees due under the HSR Act and any other Antitrust Laws of
jurisdictions outside of the United States of America in connection with the
filings described above and neither the Seller nor any other member of the
Seller Group will have any Liability with respect to the payment of such
filing fee other than its own internal costs.

(d) Without limiting the generality of _Sections 5.6(a)_ and _(b)_ , the
Purchaser and the Seller will each (i) use its Reasonable Efforts to achieve
"substantial compliance" as promptly as practicable with any request for
additional information or documentary material issued by a Governmental
Entity under 15 U.S.C. § 18a(e) and in conjunction with the Contemplated
Transactions (a " _Second Request_ "), (ii) certify "substantial compliance"
with any



MASTER ACQUISITION AGREEMENT

 



38  Second Request as promptly as practicable after the date of such Second
Request, but in no event later than sixty (60) days from receipt of the Second
Request, (iii) take all actions necessary to assert, defend and support its
certification of "substantial compliance" with such Second Request, and (iv)
not extend any waiting period under the HSR Act or enter into any agreement
with such Governmental Entities or other authorities to delay or otherwise
not to consummate as soon as practicable any of the Contemplated Transactions
except with the prior written consent of the other party hereto, which consent
may be withheld in the sole discretion of the non-requesting party.

(e) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary set forth herein, each party will
use its Reasonable Efforts to resolve such objections, if any, as may be
asserted by any Governmental Entity or private plaintiff with respect to the
Contemplated Transactions under the HSR Act and any other Antitrust Laws. In
connection therewith, if any Legal Proceeding is instituted (or threatened to
be instituted) challenging any transaction contemplated by this Agreement as a
violation of any Antitrust Law, each party will cooperate and use its
Reasonable Efforts to contest and resist any such Legal Proceeding, and to
have vacated, lifted, reversed, or overturned any Order, whether temporary,
preliminary or permanent, that is in effect and that prohibits, prevents, or
restricts consummation of the Contemplated Transactions, including by pursuing
all available avenues of administrative and judicial appeal, unless by mutual
agreement, the parties decide that litigation is not in their respective best
interests. Notwithstanding the foregoing, in the event any such litigation,
negotiation or other action is not reasonably capable of being resolved by
the Termination Date, the Purchaser shall propose, negotiate, offer to commit
and effect (and if such offer is accepted, commit to and effect), by consent
decree, hold separate order or otherwise, the sale, divestiture or
disposition of such assets or businesses of the Purchaser or its subsidiaries
(including any of the Acquired Assets), or otherwise offer to take or offer to
commit to take any action which it is capable of taking (and if such offer is
accepted, take or commit to take such action) that limits its freedom of
action with respect to, or its ability to retain, any of the businesses,
services or assets of the Purchaser or its subsidiaries (including the
Business), in order to avoid the entry of, or to effect the dissolution of,
any Order in any suit or proceeding, which would have the effect of preventing
or delaying the Initial Closing Date beyond the Termination Date, except as
would be or create a material adverse effect upon the Purchaser or the value
of the Business to the Purchaser. From the date hereof until the date of the
final Closing (the " _Final Closing Date_ "), neither the Seller nor the
Purchaser will enter into any agreement or commitment with, or propose any
agreement or commitment to, any Governmental Entity with respect to matters
arising under the HSR Act or other Antitrust Laws or otherwise relating to the
Contemplated Transactions without the written consent of the other party.

5.7 _Satisfaction of Conditions Precedent_. Without limiting any other
provision of this Agreement, upon the terms and subject to the conditions set
forth in this Agreement, the Purchaser and the Seller shall each use
Reasonable Efforts to take, or cause to be taken, all actions, and do, or
cause to be done, all things necessary, proper or advisable under
applicable Law or Order or otherwise to consummate and make effective the
Contemplated Transactions as soon as practicable after the date hereof;
_provided_ that nothing in this _Section 5.7_ shall require the Purchaser or
the Seller to waive any of the conditions set forth in _Article 6_. Without
limiting the generality of the foregoing, (a) if all other conditions to a
partys obligation to effectuate the applicable Closing and the consummation
of the Contemplated Transactions have been satisfied



MASTER ACQUISITION AGREEMENT

 



39  or waived, such Party shall execute and deliver at the applicable Closing
all Transaction Agreements applicable to such Closing to which it is a party,
and (b) each party agrees to use its reasonable best efforts to contest and
resist any Legal Proceeding that may be commenced by any of such partys
shareholders challenging or seeking to restrain any Contemplated Transaction.

 

5.8 _Financing_.

(a) The Purchaser will use its reasonable best efforts to take, or cause to
be taken, all actions and to do, or cause to be done, all things necessary,
proper or, in the Purchasers reasonable determination, advisable to arrange,
consummate and obtain the financing on the terms and conditions described in
the Debt Commitment Letter (as such terms and conditions may be modified or
adjusted in accordance with the terms thereof and within the limits of the
"market flex" provisions in the Fee Letter) (the " _Financing_ "), and (1)
not borrow funds or voluntarily incur liabilities which materially increase
the likelihood of a failure of the condition set forth in paragraph 2 of
Exhibit C to the Debt Commitment Letter and (2) will not permit any amendment
or modification to be made to, or any waiver of any provision or remedy under,
the Debt Commitment Letter if such amendment, modification or waiver would (i)
reduce the aggregate amount of the Financing plus unrestricted cash on hand
at the time of the Initial Closing below the Required Closing Amount or (ii)
impose new or additional conditions, or otherwise amend, modify or expand any
conditions, to the receipt of the Financing, in the case of either clause (i)
or (ii) above, in a manner that would reasonably be expected to (A) prevent,
impede or delay the ability of the Purchaser to consummate the Initial
Closing, (B) make any portion of the Financing (or satisfaction of the
conditions to obtaining the Financing) less likely to be obtained or prevent,
impede or delay in any material respect the funding of the Financing or (C)
adversely impact the ability of the Purchaser to enforce its rights against
the other parties to the Debt Commitment Letter; _provided_ that the Purchaser
may, without the consent of the Seller, (1) amend the Debt Commitment Letter
(A) in accordance with the "market flex" provisions thereof and (B) to add
lenders, lead arrangers, bookrunners, syndication agents or similar entities
who had not executed the Debt Commitment Letter as of the date of this
Agreement or (2) otherwise amend or replace the Debt Commitment Letter
so long as in the case of this clause (2), (x) such amendment does not impose
terms or conditions that would reasonably be expected to prevent, impede or
delay in any material respect the ability of the Purchaser to consummate the
Initial Closing or adversely impact the ability of the Purchaser to enforce
its rights against the other parties to the Debt Commitment Letter and (y)
with respect to replacements, the replacement debt commitments otherwise
satisfy the terms and conditions of an Alternative Financing set forth below.
In the event of such amendment or replacement of the Debt Commitment Letter as
permitted by the proviso to the immediately preceding sentence, the financing
under such amended or replaced Debt Commitment Letter will be deemed to be
the "Financing" as such term is used in this Agreement, and the commitment
letter evidencing any Alternative Financing (as defined below) will be deemed
to be the "Debt Commitment Letter" as such term is used in this Agreement.
The Purchaser will use reasonable best efforts to (I) maintain in effect the
Debt Commitment Letter (including any definitive agreements entered into in
connection therewith), (II) satisfy on a timely basis (or obtain the waiver
of) all conditions in the Debt Commitment Letter applicable to, and within the
control of, the Purchaser necessary to obtaining the Financing on the Initial
Closing Date and comply with its obligations thereunder, (III) consummate
the Financing on or prior to the Initial Closing Date and (IV) fully enforce
the



 

MASTER ACQUISITION AGREEMENT

 



40  counterparties obligations and its rights under the Debt Commitment Letter,
including by suit or other appropriate proceeding (including by seeking
specific performance) to cause the lenders under the Debt Commitment Letter
to fund in accordance with their respective commitments. The Purchaser will
keep the Seller reasonably informed on a current basis and in reasonable
detail of the status of the Purchasers efforts to arrange the Financing and
to satisfy the conditions thereof and shall provide to the Seller, upon
request, copies of any amendments, modifications or supplements to or
replacements of the Debt Commitment Letter related to the availability of
the Financing, the commitment by the lenders to provide the Financing, or the
conditions, the "Certain Funds" provisions, the "flex" provisions or the
termination provisions of the Debt Commitment Letter. In the event that
the Purchaser commences an enforcement action to enforce its rights under the
Debt Commitment Letter or the definitive agreements entered into in connection
therewith and/or to compel the financing sources under the Debt Commitment
Letter to fund the Financing (any such action, a " _Financing Action_ "), the
Purchaser shall keep the Seller reasonably informed of the status of the
Financing Action. If any portion of the Financing becomes reasonably likely to
be unavailable or the Purchaser becomes aware of any event or circumstance
that is reasonably likely to result in any portion of the Financing being
unavailable, in each case, on the terms and conditions (including any "market
flex" provisions) contemplated in the Debt Commitment Letter, (i) the
Purchaser will promptly notify the Seller and (ii) the Purchaser will use
reasonable best efforts to arrange and obtain alternative financing (A) in an
amount sufficient, when added to any portion of the Financing that is
available and unrestricted cash on hand and other readily available liquidity,
to pay in cash the Required Closing Amount and (B) that does not impose new or
additional conditions that were not contained in the Debt Commitment Letter
or otherwise expands, amends or modifies any of the conditions or
contingencies that were contained in the Debt Commitment Letter (taking into
account the "market flex" provisions of the Debt Commitment Letter)
not materially less favorable or more onerous to the Purchaser or the Seller,
taken as a whole (" _Alternative Financing_ ") as promptly as practicable
following the occurrence of such event. The Purchaser shall provide a true,
correct and complete copy of each alternative financing commitment (together
with a redacted copy of any related fee letter) to the Seller. Notwithstanding
the foregoing, it is understood and agreed that Alternative Financing may take
the form of senior secured or senior second secured term loans with
substantially similar terms to any first lien term loans (except for customary
cushions and other modifications) in lieu of debt securities and if a
commitment for second secured term loans is obtained, the conditions may be
expanded to include customary supplemental security documents and a customary
intercreditor agreement. In such event, (1) the term "Financing" will be
deemed to include any Alternative Financing and (2) the term "Debt Commitment
Letter" will be deemed to include any commitment letters with respect to any
such Alternative Financing. Without limiting the generality of the foregoing,
the Purchaser shall give the Seller notice as promptly as reasonably
practicable and in any event within two (2) Business Days: (I) of any breach
or default by any party to the Debt Commitment Letter or definitive document
related to the Financing of which the Purchaser becomes aware; (II) of
the receipt of any written notice or other written communication from any
Financing Source with respect to (X) any breach, default, termination or
repudiation by any party to the Debt Commitment Letter or any definitive
document related to the Financing of any provisions of the Debt Commitment
Letter or any definitive document related to the Financing or (Y) any material
dispute or disagreement between or among any parties to the Debt Commitment
Letter or any definitive document that pertains to the availability of the
Financing or the commitment



 

MASTER ACQUISITION AGREEMENT

 



41  by the lenders under the Debt Commitment Lender to provide the Financing, or
the conditions, the "Certain Funds" provisions, the "flex" provisions, the
termination provisions of the Debt Commitment Letter; and (III) if for any
reason the Purchaser believes in good faith that it will not be able to obtain
all or any portion of the Financing on the terms, in the manner or from the
sources contemplated by the Debt Commitment Letter or the definitive
documents related to the Financing. As soon as reasonably practicable, but in
any event within five (5) Business Days of the date the Seller delivers a
written request to the Purchaser, the Purchaser shall provide any information
reasonably requested by the Seller relating to any circumstance referred to in
clause (I), (II) or (III) of the immediately preceding sentence.

 

(b) Through the Initial Closing Date, the Seller will provide to the
Purchaser, and will cause its Subsidiaries to provide, at the Purchasers
cost and expense as provided in _Section 5.8(e)_, in each case subject to
_Section 10.5_, all cooperation reasonably requested by the Purchaser that is
customary or reasonably necessary in connection with arranging, obtaining and
syndicating the Financing and causing the conditions in the Debt Commitment
Letter to be satisfied as such matters relate to the Acquired Companies and
the Business, including using Reasonable Efforts in (i) assisting with the
preparation prior to the Marketing Period of offering and syndication
documents and materials in connection with the Financing, including (A)
private placement memoranda, registration statements and prospectuses and (B)
information memoranda and packages, lender and investor presentations and
rating agency materials, and providing reasonable and customary authorization
letters to the Financing Sources authorizing the distribution of information
to prospective lenders and containing customary information (all such
documents and materials, collectively, the " _Offering Documents_ "), (ii)
preparing and furnishing to the Purchaser and the Financing Sources as
promptly as reasonably practicable (A) all Required Information, (B) to the
extent it is reasonably available to the Seller and not previously made
otherwise available to the Purchaser, all pertinent information reasonably
necessary for the Purchaser to prepare pro forma financial statements and
projections or otherwise as is requested and customarily provided in
connection with any financing comparable to the Financing and (C) all other
information and disclosures relating to the Acquired Companies and the
Business (including their businesses, operations and financial projections) as
may be reasonably requested by the Purchaser to assist in preparation of the
Offering Documents (including execution of customary authorization
and management representation letters relating to the Acquired Companies and
the Business), (iii) having the Seller designate members of senior management
of the Acquired Companies and the Business to participate in a reasonable
number of presentations, road shows, due diligence sessions, drafting
sessions and sessions with ratings agencies in connection with the Financing,
(iv) assisting the Purchaser in obtaining any corporate credit and family
ratings from any ratings agencies contemplated by the Debt Commitment Letter,
(v) assisting in the preparation of definitive financing documents (including
any schedules, annexes or exhibits thereto and any pro forma financial
statements and financial projections, in each case, customarily required to
be delivered thereunder), (vi) subject to any contractual agreement in effect,
assisting in the pledging of collateral for the Financing, including taking
commercially reasonable actions necessary to permit the Financing Sources to
evaluate the Acquired Companies and the Businesss real property and current
assets, cash management and accounting systems, policies and procedures for
the purpose of establishing collateral arrangements, in each case, to the
extent customary and not unreasonably interfering with the business of the
Seller, (vii) assisting in obtaining, to the extent applicable, from the
Sellers existing lenders such consents, approvals, authorizations
and instruments which may be



MASTER ACQUISITION AGREEMENT

 



42  reasonably requested by the Purchaser in connection with the Financing and
collateral arrangements, including customary payoff letters, lien releases,
release of guaranties, instruments of termination or discharge, (viii)
providing the Purchaser with all documentation and other information required
by regulatory authorities and as reasonably requested by the Purchaser on
behalf of Financing Sources with respect to the Acquired Companies and the
Business in connection with applicable "know your customer" and anti-money
laundering rules and regulations, including the USA PATRIOT ACT, Title III of
Pub. L. 107-56 (signed into law October 26, 2001) and (ix) preparing and
delivering to the Purchaser any supplements to the above information as may be
reasonably required pursuant to the Debt Commitment Letter. The Seller hereby
consents to the use of the Acquired Companies and the Businesss logos,
trademarks and servicemarks in connection with the Financing in a form and
manner mutually agreed with the Seller; _provided_ , _however_ , that such
logos are used in a customary manner and solely in a manner that is not
intended, or reasonably likely, to harm or disparage the Seller or any of its
Subsidiaries or the reputation or goodwill of the Seller or any of its
Subsidiaries. The Seller will, upon the reasonable request of the Purchaser,
use Reasonable Efforts to periodically update any information (to the extent
it is reasonably available) to be included in any Offering Document to be used
in connection with such Financing, so that the Purchaser may ensure that any
such Required Information remains Compliant.

(c) Notwithstanding the requirements of _Section 5.8(b)_, (i) the Purchaser
shall solely be responsible for provision of any post-Initial Closing pro
forma financial information, including cost savings, synergies,
capitalization, ownership, purchase accounting adjustments or other pro forma
adjustments ( _provided_ , that for the avoidance of doubt, the Seller shall
provide the Purchaser with financial and other information relating to the
Acquired Companies and the Business reasonably requested by the Purchaser to
allow the Purchaser to prepare such pro forma financial
information, including projections of the Acquired Companies and the
Business), (ii) none of the Seller, any of its Subsidiaries, or any of their
respective Representatives shall be required to enter into any certificate,
document, agreement or instrument in connection with the Financing which will
be effective prior to the Initial Closing Date (other than in connection with
the issuance of a customary comfort letter by the Sellers auditors in
connection with the pricing and closing of any high-yield debt offering in
connection with the Financing), (iii) nothing herein shall require cooperation
contemplated thereby to the extent it would interfere unreasonably or
materially with the business or operations of the Seller or any of its
Subsidiaries (it being agreed that contacting the customers of the Seller
without the Sellers consent shall constitute unreasonable interference), (iv)
none of the Seller and any of its Subsidiaries will be required to pay
any commitment or other similar fee or incur any other liability in
connection with the Financing prior to the Initial Closing Date, (v) nothing
herein shall require cooperation or assistance from a Seller director, officer
or employee to the extent such director, officer or employee is reasonably
likely to incur any personal financial liability by providing such cooperation
or assistance that will not be repaid, reimbursed or indemnified in full by
the Purchaser and (vi) neither the Seller nor any of its Subsidiaries
(excluding the Acquired Companies on the Initial Closing Date after giving
effect to the Initial Closing) shall (except as expressly set forth in this
Agreement) have any liability or obligation under any credit agreement or any
related document or any other agreement or document related to the Financing
(or any alternative financing that the Purchaser may raise in connection with
the transactions contemplated by this Agreement) or be required to incur any
other liability in connection therewith.

Seller for all documented out-of-pocket costs and expenses (including
reasonable and documented out-of-pocket attorneys fees) incurred by the
Seller or any of its Subsidiaries in connection with the cooperation of the
Seller and its Subsidiaries contemplated by _Section 5.8(b)_, including
in connection with the Sellers obligations under _Section 5.11_. The
Purchaser will indemnify and hold harmless the Seller, its Subsidiaries and
their respective Representatives from and against any and all losses, damages,
claims, costs or expenses suffered or incurred by any of them in connection
with the arrangement of the Financing (including any action taken in
accordance with this _Section 5.8_) and any information used in connection
therewith, except with respect to any information relating to the Seller or
the Acquired Companies or the Business provided in writing by the Seller or
any of its Subsidiaries specifically for use in the Financing offering
documents or any fraud or intentional misrepresentations or willful
misconduct or gross negligence by any such Persons.

(f) All information provided by the Seller or any of its Representatives
pursuant to this _Section 5.8_ that consists of "confidential information"
pursuant to the NDA shall be kept confidential in accordance with the NDA,
except that the Purchaser shall be permitted to disclose such information to

the terms of the Debt Commitment Letters, subject to customary confidentiality
undertakings by the Financing Sources and other lenders and potential lenders
similar to those in the NDA.

5.9 _Bulk Transfer Laws_. The Purchaser hereby waives compliance by the
Acquired Companies or each member of the Seller Group with any applicable
bulk sale or bulk transfer Laws of any jurisdiction in connection with the
Contemplated Transactions.

 

5.10 _Insurance_.

except for insurance policies acquired directly by and in the name of one or
more Acquired Companies or direct self-insurance programs of the Acquired
Companies, the Acquired Assets, Assumed Liabilities and Acquired Companies
shall cease to be insured by the Sellers or its Affiliates insurance
policies or by any of their self-insured programs (collectively, the " _Seller
Insurance Policies_ "), including by TCS Insurance Company of Ireland, Ltd.
and/or TCS Reinsurance Company of Ireland, Ltd. With respect to events or
circumstances relating to the Acquired Assets, Assumed Liabilities or Acquired
Companies that occurred or existed prior to the applicable Closing Date that
are covered by the Seller Insurance Policies that are occurrence-based
liability insurance policies and any workers compensation insurance policies
and/or comparable workers compensation self-insurance, state or country
programs that apply to the locations at which the Acquired Companies
businesses are operated, upon the reasonable request of the Purchaser, the
Seller shall make claims, pursuant to the terms of this  _Section 5.10(a)_,
for the benefit of a member of the Purchaser Group or an Acquired Company,
under such policies and programs to the extent such coverage and limits are
available under such

 



MASTER ACQUISITION AGREEMENT

 



44  policies and programs and subject to the Purchaser paying, or causing the
applicable member of the Purchaser Group or Acquired Company to pay, any
applicable deductible. For the avoidance of doubt, the Purchaser shall be
responsible for the payment of any applicable deductible. The Seller and its
Affiliates shall retain all rights to control its insurance policies and
programs and claims made thereunder, including the right to exhaust, settle,
release, commute, buy-back or otherwise resolve disputes with respect to any
of its insurance policies and programs or claims made thereunder,
notwithstanding whether any such policies or programs apply to any Acquired
Asset, Assumed Liability or Acquired Company. For the avoidance of doubt, the
right of the Seller and its Affiliates to control claims includes the right to
control any matters reasonably necessary to preserve, present and prosecute
such claim. To the extent that the Purchaser desires to assert a claim that
may be covered by a Seller Insurance Policy pursuant to this _Section
5.10(a)_, the Purchaser will deliver a written notice to the Seller, which
notice must contain (i) a description of, and an estimated amount payable
pursuant to, such claim, (ii) the applicable insurance policy under which the
Purchaser is asserting such claim to the extent known, and (iii) a reasonable
explanation of the basis for the claim. The Seller will either (A) agree to
control such claim with the applicable insurance carrier, or (B) dispute that
the claim is covered in whole or in part, provided that in either event the
Seller will, or will cause its applicable Affiliate to, make Reasonable
Efforts to give notice of claim to the insurer which maintains the insurance
policy or policies identified by the Purchaser in its notice to the Seller,
and the Purchaser will, and will cause its Affiliates (including the members
of the Purchaser Group and the Acquired Companies) to, at all times cooperate
with reasonable requests for information by the Seller and its Affiliates or
the insurers regarding any such claim. The Purchaser will promptly pay or
reimburse the Seller and its Affiliates for all reasonable out-of-pocket
costs and expenses incurred by the Seller and its Affiliates in connection
with any claims asserted by the Purchaser or any of its Affiliates (including,
following the Initial Closing, an Acquired Company) pursuant to this _Section
5.10(a)_.

(b) The Seller shall use Reasonable Efforts to assist the Purchaser in
obtaining "tail" or other appropriate insurance coverage for the Acquired
Companies prior to Closing.

5.11 _Interim and Audited Financial Statements_. From the date of this
Agreement until the Initial Closing, the Seller shall deliver to the Purchaser
the unaudited balance sheet and the related statement of income and statement
of cash flow of the Business as of and for the interim period ended the last
day of each quarter ended on or after March 31, 2014 (collectively, the "
_Interim Financial Statements_ "), as soon as practical, but within forty-five
(45) calendar days, after the last day of the applicable quarter. The Interim
Financial Statements (i) will be prepared in accordance with GAAP using the
same principles, policies and methodologies used in preparing the Audited
Financial Statements, and will present fairly in all material respects the
financial condition of the Business as of the respective dates thereof and the
results of operations of the Business for the respective periods indicated
therein, except, in each case, (A) the absence of footnotes or other audit
disclosures and statements of changes in stockholders equity, and (B) subject
to normal year-end adjustments which, individually or in the aggregate, are
not material, and (ii) will be reviewed by the Sellers independent auditors
in accordance with the procedures specified by the Public Company Accounting
Oversight Board in AU 722. In addition, (a) the Seller has delivered to the
Purchaser the Audited Financial Statements and, (b) if the Initial
Closing takes place after February 12, 2015, the Seller shall prepare, and
deliver to the Purchaser on or prior to March 1, 2015, audited financial
statements for the Business of the same type and

 



MASTER ACQUISITION AGREEMENT

 



45  prepared in substantially the same manner as the Audited Financial
Statements as of and for the year ended December 31, 2014, in each case, in
compliance with the requirements of the Securities Act (including Regulation
S-X thereunder and other accounting rules and regulations of the SEC
(excluding information required by Regulation S-X Rule 3-10 and Regulation S-X
Rule 3-16 or "segment reporting")) in order to enable the Purchaser to comply

of this Agreement or any other Principal Agreement has caused or resulted in
the Initial Closing not having occurred by such date;

(c) By the Purchaser, if, prior to the Initial Closing Date, any condition

(d) By the Seller, if, prior to the Initial Closing Date, any condition
provided in _Section 6.2_ has not been met, satisfaction of such condition

Any valid termination of this Agreement in accordance with this _Section

deemed to prejudice, or to constitute or operate as a waiver of, any other
right or remedy that such party may be entitled to exercise (whether under
this Agreement, under any other Contract, under any statute, rule or other
Laws, at common Law, in equity or otherwise); _provided_ , _however_ , if a
party terminates this Agreement pursuant to _Section 7.1_, such party shall
not thereafter be entitled to specific performance to enforce specifically the

the Financing Termination Fee shall not be the sole and exclusive remedy if
the Financing is not obtained due to the Purchasers breach of _Section
5.8(a)_ (it being understood and agreed that, if the Seller has accepted
payment of the Financing Termination Fee, it shall not be entitled to pursue
any Claim against the Purchaser or its Affiliates for Damages allegedly
arising out of the Financing Failure). Without limitation of the foregoing,
none of the Seller, any of its respective Affiliates and any other Person

MASTER ACQUISITION AGREEMENT

 



53 (b) _Response to Notice of Claim_. Within thirty (30) days after delivery of a
Claim Notice, the Indemnifying Party will deliver to the Indemnified Party a
written response (the " _Response_ ") in which the Indemnifying Party will:

 

(i) agree that the Indemnified Party is entitled to receive all of the Claimed
Amount, and, within five (5) Business Days of the Indemnified Partys receipt
of the Response, the Indemnifying Party will pay the Claimed Amount to the
Indemnified Party in accordance with a payment and distribution method
reasonably acceptable to the Indemnified Party;

 

(ii) agree that the Indemnified Party is entitled to receive part, but not
all, of the Claimed Amount (such portion, the " _Agreed Portion_ "), and,
within five (5) Business Days of the Indemnified Partys receipt of the
Response, the Indemnifying Party will pay the Agreed Portion to the
Indemnified Party in accordance with a payment and distribution method
reasonably acceptable to the Indemnified Party; or

(iii) dispute that the Indemnified Party is entitled to receive any of the
Claimed Amount.

If no Response is delivered by the Indemnifying Party to the Indemnified Party

deemed to have disputed the Indemnified Partys right to receive any of the
Claimed Amount.

 

(c) _Contested Claims_. In the event that the Indemnifying Party disputes (or
is deemed to have disputed) the Claimed Amount (or the portion of the Claimed

provide indemnification under this _Article 8_ or  _Article 9_ (a " _Third
Party Claim_ "), the Indemnified Party will provide a Claim Notice to the
Indemnifying Party as soon as practicable but in no event later than thirty
(30) days thereafter. Such Claim Notice will be accompanied by reasonable
supporting documentation submitted by such third party (to the extent then in
the possession of the Indemnified Party) and will describe in reasonable
detail the facts constituting the basis for such claim, suit, audit
or proceeding and the amount of the claimed damages (in each case to the
extent known or reasonably ascertainable by the Indemnified Party); _provided_
, _however_ , that no delay or deficiency on the part of the Indemnified Party
in so notifying the Indemnifying Party will relieve the Indemnifying Party of
any Liability hereunder except to the extent the Indemnifying Partys ability
to remedy, contest, defend or settle with respect to such Third Party Claim is
prejudiced thereby.



MASTER ACQUISITION AGREEMENT

 



54 (ii) Within thirty (30) days after receipt of such notification pursuant to 
_Section 8.3(d)(i)_, the Indemnifying Party shall have the right to
undertake, by counsel or other Representatives of its own choosing (provided
such counsel or other Representative is reasonably satisfactory to the
Indemnified Party), the defense of such Third Party Claim at the Indemnifying
Partys sole expense. In the event that (A) the Indemnifying Party shall elect
not to undertake such defense; (B) the Indemnifying Party shall fail to
undertake to defend such Third Party Claim within thirty (30) days after
delivery of the Claim Notice by the Indemnified Party of such Third Party
Claim or thereafter fail to diligently pursue or maintain such defense; (C)

and adversely affect the Indemnified Party other than as solely a result of
money damages or other money payments; or (E) the Indemnified Party reasonably
concludes that the Indemnifying Party and the Indemnified Party have
conflicting interests with respect to such Third Party Claim, then
the Indemnified Party (upon further notice to the Indemnifying Party) shall
have the right to undertake the defense, compromise and/or settlement of such
Third Party Claim, by counsel or other Representatives of its own choosing, on
behalf of and without limiting the indemnification obligations of the
Indemnifying Party under this Agreement. In the event that the Indemnified
Party undertakes the defense of a Third Party Claim under this _Section
8.3(d)(ii)_, the Indemnifying Party shall pay to the Indemnified Party, in
addition to all other amounts required to be paid hereunder, the reasonable
costs and expenses (including reasonable attorneys fees) incurred by the
Indemnified Party in connection with the investigation, defense, compromise
and/or settlement thereof.

(iii) The party not controlling such defense of a Third Party Claim (the "
_Non-Controlling Party_ ") may participate therein at its own expense, subject
to any limitations that are reasonably required to preserve any applicable
privilege or third party confidentiality. The party controlling such
defense (the " _Controlling Party_ ") will keep the Non-Controlling Party
reasonably advised of the status of such claim, suit, audit or proceeding and
the defense thereof (subject to any limitations that are reasonably required
to preserve any applicable privilege or third party confidentiality), and
will consider in good faith recommendations made by the Non-Controlling Party
with respect thereto. The Non-Controlling Party will, subject to any
limitations that are reasonably required to preserve any applicable privilege
or third party confidentiality, furnish the Controlling Party with such
information as it may have with respect to such claim, suit, audit or
proceeding (including copies of any summons, complaint or other
pleading which may have been served on such party and any written claim,
demand, invoice, billing or other document evidencing or asserting the same)
and will otherwise cooperate with and assist the Controlling Party in the

consent of the Indemnified Party, which will not be unreasonably withheld,
delayed or conditioned; _provided_ ,  _however_ , that the consent of the
Indemnified Party will not be required if (A) the Indemnifying Party agrees in
writing to pay any amounts payable pursuant to such settlement, compromise or
Order, (B) such settlement, compromise or Order includes a full, complete and
unconditional release of the Indemnified Party from further Liability with
respect to such claim, suit, audit or proceeding, (C) such settlement,
compromise or Order would not result in the finding or admission of any
violation of Law, and (D) such settlement, compromise or Order does not impose
any injunctive relief or operational restrictions on the Indemnified Party or
admit to any wrongdoing by or on behalf of the Indemnified Party;  _provided_
_further_ , that the Indemnifying Party shall not encumber any of the Assets
of any Indemnified Party or agree to any restriction or condition that would
apply to or materially adversely affect any Indemnified Party or the conduct
of any Indemnified Partys business.

(v) The Indemnified Party will not agree (or allow any Affiliate to agree) to
any settlement or compromise of, or consent to the entry of any Order arising

identified in _Sections 8.4(a)_, _(b)_ ,  _(c)_ or _(d)_ shall survive the

56 (f) All covenants and agreements of the parties contained in any Principal
Agreement or in any certificate or other writing delivered pursuant thereto
or in connection therewith will survive until the expiration of the applicable
statute of limitations (including any extension or tolling thereof) or for the

(g) If an Indemnified Party delivers to an Indemnifying Party, before
expiration of the applicable indemnification period set forth above, either a
Claim Notice based on the fact that an Indemnified Party has incurred Damages,
or a notice that, as a result of a Legal Proceeding instituted by or claim
made by a third Person, the Indemnified Party reasonably expects to
incur Damages (an " _Expected Claim Notice_ "), then the applicable
representation, warranty, covenant or agreement will survive until, but only
for purposes of, the resolution of the matter covered by such notice. If the
Legal Proceeding or written claim with respect to which an Expected Claim
Notice has been given is definitively withdrawn or resolved in favor of the
Indemnified Party, the Indemnified Party will promptly so notify the
Indemnifying Party.

 

8.5 _Limitations_.

(a)  _Liability of the Seller_. The Purchaser Indemnitees shall not be
entitled to indemnification under _Section 8.1(a)_ (except with respect to
any failure of any Seller Fundamental Representation or any representation and
warranty in  _Section 3.22_ to be true and correct) until the Purchaser
Indemnitees shall have incurred (i) with respect to any particular claim
(taken together with other claims arising out of the same or related
circumstances or set of facts (" _Related Claims_ ")), Damages in excess of
$500,000 (such amount, the " _Minimum Per Claim Amount_ "), and (ii) as to all
such claims, Damages in excess of $34,500,000 (the " _Deductible_ "), and
then only to the extent such Damages exceed the Deductible. Damages related
to Related Claims asserted by the Purchaser Indemnitees that do not meet the
Minimum Per Claim Amount shall not count toward the Deductible. The Purchaser
Indemnitees shall not be entitled to indemnification under _Section 8.1(a)_
with respect to any failure of _Section 3.22_ to be true and correct until
the Purchaser Indemnitees shall have incurred with respect to any particular
claim, Damages in excess of $250,000. The Sellers aggregate Liability for
Damages arising under _Section 8.1(a)_ (except with respect to any failure of
any Seller Fundamental Representation to be true and correct) will not exceed
$345,000,000 (the " _Representations and Warranties Cap_ ").

(b) _Liability of the Purchaser_. The Seller Indemnitees shall not
be entitled to indemnification under _Section 8.2(a)_ (except with respect
to any failure of any Purchaser Fundamental Representation to be true and
correct) until the Seller Indemnitees shall have incurred (i) with respect to
any Related Claims, Damages in excess of the Minimum Per Claim Amount, and
(ii) as to all such claims, Damages in excess of the Deductible, and then only
to the extent such Damages exceed the Deductible. Damages related to Related
Claims asserted by the Seller Indemnitees that do not meet the Minimum Per
Claim Amount shall not count toward the Deductible. The Seller Indemnitees
shall not be entitled to indemnification under _Section 8.2(c)_ with respect
to Assumed Liabilities covered by _Section 1.3(i)_ until the Seller
Indemnitees shall



 

MASTER ACQUISITION AGREEMENT

 



57  have incurred Damages in excess of $10,000,000, and then only to the extent
such Damages exceed such amount. The Purchasers aggregate Liability for
Damages arising under  _Section 8.2(a)_ (except with respect to any failure
of any Purchaser Fundamental Representation to be true and correct) will not
exceed the Representations and Warranties Cap.

 

(c) _Tax Benefit_. The amount of any and all Damages for which indemnification
is provided pursuant to this _Article 8_ or  _Article 9_ will be net of any
Tax benefit realized by an Indemnified Party in the taxable year such Damage
is incurred (taking into account any Tax cost or reduction in Tax basis and
such Tax benefits by reason of receipt of the indemnification payment that
was not included in the computation of the Damages) to the extent actually
received by, or paid in kind to, the Indemnified Party with respect to such
Damages or any of the circumstances giving rise thereto. In connection
therewith, if, at any time following payment in full by the Indemnifying Party
of any amounts of Damages due hereunder, the Indemnified Party realizes any
Tax benefit, in the taxable year such Damage is incurred (or the succeeding
three taxable years), relating to the circumstances giving rise to such
Damages, the Indemnified Party will promptly remit to the Indemnifying Party
such Tax benefit in an amount not to exceed the amount of the corresponding
indemnification payment made by the Indemnifying Party. For this purpose, the
Indemnified Party shall be deemed to realize a Tax benefit with respect to a
taxable year if, and to the extent that, the Indemnified Partys cumulative
liability for Taxes through the end of such taxable year, calculated by
excluding any Tax items attributable to the Damages from such taxable year,
_exceeds_ the Indemnified Partys actual cumulative liability for Taxes
through the end of such taxable year, calculated by taking into account any
Tax items attributable to the Losses for such taxable years (to the extent
permitted by relevant Tax Law and treating such Tax items as the last items
claimed for any taxable year) and taking into account, for all purposes,
any increase in Tax refunds and related interest paid by a Governmental
Entity with respect thereto. Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary,
no Indemnified Party shall be entitled to indemnification or reimbursement
under any provision of this Agreement for any amount to the extent such
Person or its Affiliate has been indemnified or reimbursed for such amount
under any other provision of this Agreement or any other Transaction
Agreement. Notwithstanding any other provisions of this Agreement to the
contrary, the Indemnifying Party shall have no indemnification obligations to
the extent that any Indemnified Party affirmatively causes or contributes to,
or knowingly fails to take actions that causes or contributes to,
the conditions giving rise to any indemnifiable Damages; _provided_ ,
_however_ , that this limitation on the Indemnifying Partys indemnification
obligations shall apply only to the extent of the Indemnified Partys cause
or contribution to the Damages.

8.6 _Exclusive Remedy_.

 

(a) Except in the case of fraud, intentional misrepresentation, intentional
breach, willful misconduct or criminal acts and as otherwise set forth herein
(including _Section 11.13_), following the Initial Closing, the sole and
exclusive remedy of any Purchaser Indemnitee with respect to any and all
monetary Damages for any inaccuracy or breach of any representation or
warranty or any breach of any covenant or agreement contained in the
Principal Agreements will be pursuant to the indemnification obligations set
forth in _Section 8.1_ and _Section 9.1(a)_; _provided_ , _however_ , that
the foregoing will not prohibit the Purchaser from seeking injunctive relief
from a court of competent jurisdiction to prevent any failure or breach or to
specifically enforce the Principal Agreements or any of the terms or
provisions thereof.

 



MASTER ACQUISITION AGREEMENT

 



58 (b) Except in the case of fraud, intentional misrepresentation, intentional
breach, willful misconduct or criminal acts and as otherwise set forth herein
(including _Section 11.13_), following the Initial Closing, the sole and
exclusive remedy of any Seller Indemnitee with respect to any and all monetary
Damages for any inaccuracy or breach of any representation or warranty or any
breach of any covenant or agreement contained in the Principal Agreements will
be pursuant to the indemnification obligations set forth in _Section 8.2_
and  _Section 9.1(b)_; _provided_ , _however_ , that the foregoing will not
prohibit the Seller from seeking injunctive relief from a court of competent
jurisdiction to prevent any failure or breach or to specifically enforce
the Principal Agreements or any of the terms or provisions thereof.

8.7 _Exercise of Remedies by Persons Other than the Parties_. No Purchaser
Indemnitee (other than the Purchaser or any successor or permitted assignee of
the Purchaser) is entitled to assert any indemnification claim under this
Agreement unless the Purchaser (or any successor or permitted assignee of
the Purchaser) consents to the assertion of the indemnification claim. No
Seller Indemnitee (other than the Seller or any successor or permitted
assignee of the Seller) is entitled to assert any indemnification claim under
this Agreement unless the Seller (or any successor or permitted assignee of
the Seller) consents to the assertion of the indemnification claim.

8.8  _Releases_.

(a) Effective as of the Initial Closing Date, each of the Seller and each
member of the Seller Group (each a " _Seller Releasor_ "), on behalf of
itself and its Affiliates, legal representatives, successors and assigns,
hereby releases, acquits and forever discharges, to the fullest extent
permitted by Law, each of the Acquired Companies and each of their respective
past, present or future officers, managers, directors, shareholders, partners,

Seller Releasor or its Affiliates, legal representatives, successors or
assigns ever had, now has or may have on or by reason of any matter, cause or
thing whatsoever arising out of the operation of the Business or the ownership
by the Seller Group of the Acquired Companies prior to the Initial Closing
Date (the " _Released Matters_ "). Each Seller Releasor agrees not to, and
agrees to cause its respective Affiliates and Subsidiaries not to, assert any
Claim against the Acquired Company Releasees with respect to the Released
Matters. Notwithstanding the foregoing, each Seller Releasor and its
respective Affiliates, legal representatives, successors and assigns retain
all of, do not release any of, and are free to assert any Claim relating to,
their rights and interests under the terms of this Agreement and the other
Transaction Agreements, the obligations of the Seller Group explicitly set
forth in any provisions of this Agreement or the other Transaction
Agreements, or with respect to any Claim or Damages resulting from such
Persons fraud or criminal act. Each Seller Releasor acknowledges that it has
received or has had the opportunity to receive independent legal advice from
its attorneys regarding this waiver, and each Seller Releasor hereby assumes
full responsibility for any Damages which it may hereunder incur by reason of
such waiver.

 

(b) Effective as of the Initial Closing Date, the Purchaser and each member of
the Purchaser Group (each a " _Purchaser Releasor_ "), on behalf of each
Acquired Company and its Affiliates, legal representatives, successors and
assigns, hereby releases, acquits and forever discharges, to the fullest
extent permitted by Law, each of the past and present officers,

Purchaser Releasor or its Affiliates, legal representatives, successors or

thing whatsoever arising out of the Released Matters. Each Purchaser Releasor
agrees not to, and agrees to cause the Acquired Companies not to, assert any

Notwithstanding the foregoing, each Purchaser Releasor and its respective
Affiliates, legal representatives, successors and assigns retain all of, do
not release any of, and are free to assert any Claim relating to, their rights
and interests under the terms of this Agreement and the other Transaction
Agreements, the obligations of the Purchaser Group explicitly set forth in
any provisions of this Agreement or the other Transaction Agreements, or with
respect to any Claim or Damages resulting from such Persons fraud or criminal
act. Each Purchaser Releasor acknowledges that it has received or has had
the opportunity to receive independent legal advice from its attorneys
regarding this waiver, and each Purchaser Releasor hereby assumes full
responsibility for any Damages which it may hereunder incur by reason of such
waiver.

 

ARTICLE 9

TAX MATTERS 

9.1 Liability and Indemnification for Taxes.

 

(a) The Seller will indemnify the Purchaser Indemnitees against all Excluded
Taxes and all related costs of defending claims relating to Excluded Taxes.
Any Purchaser Indemnitee seeking indemnity under this _Article 9_ will comply
with the claims procedure set forth in _Section 8.3_.

 

(b) The Purchaser will indemnify the Seller Indemnitees against (i) any Tax
(other than a Tax for a Pre-Closing Period) of (or payable by) any Acquired
Company, or that is attributable to the ownership of any Acquired Assets, that
is not, in each case, an Excluded Tax; (ii) any Transfer Taxes and any
Indirect Taxes pursuant to _subsections (d)_ and  _(e)_ hereof that the
Purchaser is responsible under this Agreement; (iii) any Taxes resulting from
the breach of any covenant or other obligation of the Purchaser under this
Agreement (including this _Article 9_ ); (iv) any Taxes that the Purchaser is
responsible for under _Section 10.6_ or _Section 10.7_; (v) any Taxes
imposed under Treasury Regulation section 1.1503(d) (or other provision of the
Code or Treasury Regulations or any provision of state or local or non-U.S.
Law) as a result of the loss or recapture (including as a result of a
"triggering event" (as used for purposes of Treasury Regulation section
1.1503(d)) with respect to any "dual consolidated loss" set forth on
_Schedule 9.8(a)_ to the extent such Taxes result from the Purchasers failure
to comply with the New Domestic Use Agreement; (vi) any Taxes included in
Final Closing Working Capital (as finally determined under  _Section 2.5_);
(vii) all related costs of defending any claims relating to Taxes set forth in
clauses (i) to (vi); and (viii) the cost of filing any Purchaser Prepared
Returns under _Section 9.5_. Any Seller Indemnitee seeking indemnity under
this _Article 9_ will comply with the claims procedure set forth in _Section
8.3_.

(c) With respect to determining the Taxes for any Straddle Period that are
attributable to the portion of the Straddle Period ending on the Initial
Closing Date and the portion beginning on the day after the Initial Closing
Date, the parties agree that Taxes will be



MASTER ACQUISITION AGREEMENT

 



60  allocated based on a closing of the books at the end of the Initial Closing
Date, except that (i) Tax items of a periodic nature or measured by the level
of any item, such as real and personal ad valorem property Taxes (" _Property
Taxes_ ") and depreciation allowances calculated on an annual or periodic
basis, will be allocated by apportioning a pro-rata portion of such Taxes to
each day in the relevant Straddle Period and (ii) Tax items resulting from
activities or transactions on the Initial Closing Date, but after the Initial
Closing, that are not in the Ordinary Course or otherwise result from actions
described in _Section 9.6_ will be treated as occurring on the day after the
Initial Closing Date.

(d) Any applicable transfer, stamp, stock transfer or similar
Taxes (excluding for this purpose, any tax imposed or assessed on income or
gains) that are or become due and payable as a result of the Contemplated
Transactions, and all related interest or penalties, whether such Taxes are
imposed by Law on the Acquired Companies, the other Acquired Assets, the
Seller Group or the Purchaser Group (other than an Indirect Tax, which is
addressed in _subsection (e)_ hereof) (such Taxes, the " _Transfer Taxes_ "),
shall be borne fifty percent (50%) by the Purchaser and fifty percent (50%)
by the Seller. The parties will cooperate with each other in minimizing the
amount of any Transfer Taxes to the extent permitted by applicable Law
(including the provision of any information or preparation of any
documentation that may be necessary or useful for obtaining any available
mitigation, reduction or exemption from any such Transfer Taxes). Any Tax
Returns that are required to be filed with respect to any Transfer Taxes will
be prepared and filed by the party that customarily has primary responsibility
for filing such Tax Returns pursuant to the applicable Law.

 

(e) The amount of any payment for a supply of goods or services or the value
of any supply made or deemed to have been made pursuant to any Principal
Agreement will be exclusive of any Indirect Tax properly chargeable on the
supply. To the extent such Indirect Tax is non-refundable or non-creditable,
the amount of such Indirect Tax will be borne fifty percent (50%) by the
Purchaser and fifty percent (50%) by the Seller in addition to any payment
due under any Principal Agreement at the time the supply is made. To the
extent such Indirect Tax is refundable or creditable to the Purchaser, the
amount of any such Indirect Tax will be borne by the Purchaser in addition to
any payment due under any Principal Agreement at the time the supply is made.
In the event that any Indirect Tax is imposed upon or imposed against any
member of the Seller Group, the Seller will promptly notify the Purchaser of
the Indirect Tax amount on a valid Indirect Tax invoice (and any reasonable
detail or any other information reasonably requested by the Purchaser and
required by applicable Law). Upon receipt of any invoice for any Indirect Tax
that is non-refundable or non-creditable to the Seller, the Purchaser will
promptly remit to the Seller fifty percent (50%) of the amount specified in
such invoice, and the Seller will make, or will cause to be made, any
payments to the applicable Governmental Entities as required under applicable
Law. Upon receipt of any invoice for any Indirect Tax that is refundable or
creditable to the Purchaser, the Purchaser will promptly remit to the Seller
one hundred percent (100%) of the amount specified in such invoice, and the
Seller will make, or will cause to be made, any payments to the applicable
Governmental Entities as required under applicable Law. The parties will
cooperate with each other in the provision of any information or preparation
of any documentation that may be necessary or useful for obtaining any
available mitigation, reduction or exemption of Indirect Tax or for seeking a
refund or credit of Indirect Tax (including any contests by any Governmental
Entity with respect to such refund or credit), including cooperating so that
no Indirect Tax is charged on any payment due under any Principal



 

MASTER ACQUISITION AGREEMENT

 



61  Agreement if an exemption for an Indirect Tax (in whole or in part) is
permitted under applicable Law (e.g., an exemption for a sale of a going
concern). Any Tax Returns that are required to be filed with respect to
Indirect Tax will be prepared and filed by the party that customarily has
primary responsibility for filing such Tax Return pursuant to the applicable
Law. If the Purchaser initially incurs one hundred percent (100%) of
an Indirect Tax pursuant to this _Section 9.1(e)_ assuming that such
Indirect Tax is refundable or creditable, and after good faith efforts to
obtain such refund or credit, it is denied by an appropriate Governmental
Entity, and the Seller is not able to recover such Indirect Tax, the Seller
will reimburse the Purchaser for fifty percent (50%) of the Indirect Tax for
which a refund or credit is denied. If the Seller in such cases recovers such
Indirect Tax through a refund or credit, the Seller will reimburse the
Purchaser for one hundred percent (100%) of such Indirect Tax.

(f) Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the contrary, all
obligations of the Seller under this _Section 9.1_ shall represent the sole
and exclusive indemnity obligation for Taxes and all of the Sellers and the
Purchasers obligations for Taxes under this _Section 9.1_ with respect to
Taxes shall not be subject to the Minimum Per Claim Amount, Deductible, and
Representations and Warranties Cap provided for in _Section 8.5_.

 

9.2 _Allocation of Purchase Price_.

 

(a) The Seller will prepare an allocation statement allocating the Purchase
Price, as adjusted (including for purposes of this  _Section 9.2_, any other
items required to be included under the Code, and any other consideration paid
to the Seller for Income Tax purposes, including the relevant portion of
Assumed Liabilities (the " _Consideration_ ")) among the Acquired Assets
(including the Acquired Company Shares) (the " _Proposed Allocation Statement_
"). The Proposed Allocation Statement will be sent to the Purchaser within
ninety (90) Business Days following the Initial Closing Date. Within thirty
(30) Business Days after the receipt of the Proposed Allocation Statement, the
Purchaser will propose any changes or will indicate its concurrence therewith.
In the event that the Purchaser does not concur with the Proposed Allocation
Statement, the Purchaser and the Seller will attempt to reach agreement on the
allocation of the Consideration among the Acquired Assets in a manner
consistent with applicable Income Tax Law. If the Purchaser and the Seller
reach agreement on such allocation (an " _Agreed Allocation_ "), the
Purchaser and the Seller will, and will cause each applicable Affiliate to:
(A) file all Tax Returns for Income Taxes consistent therewith; (B) promptly
inform each other of any challenge by any Governmental Entity to the Agreed
Allocation; and (C) consult with and keep one another informed with respect to
the status of, and any discussion, proposal or submission with respect to, any
challenge to the Agreed Allocation. If the Purchaser and the Seller do not
reach an Agreed Allocation within six (6) months after the Initial Closing
Date, the Purchaser and the Seller will each prepare its own allocation of the
Consideration among the Acquired Assets (including the Acquired Company
Shares) to be used by such party and its Affiliates.

(b) For the purposes of this  _Section 9.2_, any payments made pursuant to
_Article 8_ or _Article 9_ hereof will be treated as adjustments to the
Purchase Price, to the extent permitted by applicable Law, and the parties
shall make appropriate adjustments to any allocation (whether or not an
Agreed Allocation) to reflect any adjustments to the Purchase Price. In the
event there is an adjustment to the Purchase Price and the original Purchase
Price

 



MASTER ACQUISITION AGREEMENT

 



62  was included in an Indirect Tax invoice or Indirect Tax return, the
Purchaser and the Seller will amend, if necessary, such Indirect Tax invoice
or Indirect Tax Return and the obligation and rights of the Purchaser and the
Seller pursuant to _Section 9.1(e)_ shall control with respect to such
amended Indirect Tax invoice or Indirect Tax Return.

 

(c) Notwithstanding the foregoing, but solely to the extent the Purchaser and
the Seller are required by applicable Law or Order to agree on the amount or
value of a particular Acquired Asset for purposes of any Transfer Taxes or
Indirect Taxes, the Purchaser and the Seller will mutually agree on a good
faith estimate of the fair market value of such asset prior to the date any
Transfer Tax or Indirect Tax filing is required to be made or any such
Transfer Tax payment is required to be paid (including applicable extensions).
The Purchaser and the Seller understand and agree that any agreement reached
pursuant to this  _Section 9.2(c)_ is reached solely for purposes of
Transfer Tax or Indirect Tax filings and payments required under applicable
Law or Order, and will in no way be regarded by the parties as conclusive with
respect to the allocation described in _Section 9.2(a)_ unless required
under applicable Law or Order.

(d) Prior to the Initial Closing Date, the Seller will cooperate with the
Purchaser in good faith to assist the Purchaser in determining for its funds
flow on the Initial Closing Date as to a preliminary allocation of the
Consideration among the Acquired Companies not organized or formed in
the United States that are being directly acquired by the Purchaser Group and
each local country transaction set forth on _Schedule 1.5_ (other than
transactions set forth in the section titled "United States"), provided that
no preliminary allocation shall be binding on either the Seller or the
Purchaser for purposes of any final allocations under _Section 9.2_ (whether
or not such allocation is an Agreed Allocation).

 

9.3 _Tax Refunds and Tax Benefits_. Any cash Tax refund and any credit claimed
in lieu of a cash Tax refund (including any interest paid by a Governmental
Entity with respect thereto) relating to Excluded Taxes or Tax payments made
for Pre-Closing Periods (or that is otherwise an Excluded Asset or is with
respect to Taxes paid or accrued by any Acquired Company for a Pre-
Closing Period) to the extent such Tax refund or credit was not included in
Final Closing Working Capital (as finally determined under _Section 2.5_)
will be the property of the Seller, and if received by the Purchaser or any
Acquired Company or one of their Affiliates, will be paid over promptly to
the Seller. The Purchaser will, if the Seller so requests and at the Sellers
expense, cause the Acquired Companies to file for and use Reasonable Efforts
to obtain and expedite the receipt of any refund to which the Seller is
entitled under this _Section 9.3_. The Purchaser will permit the Seller to
participate (at the Sellers expense) in the prosecution of any such refund
claim. Payments to the Seller under this  _Section 9.3_ shall be net of (1)
any reasonable out-of-pocket costs associated in obtaining such refund of
Taxes, and (2) any Taxes actually imposed on the Purchaser and/or the Acquired
Companies as a result of such refunds. To the extent a withholding Tax is
imposed on such payments, the Purchaser (or any Acquired Company or their
designees) shall be entitled to withhold from such payments pursuant to
_Section 9.13_. If there is a subsequent reduction by a Governmental Entity,
of any amounts with respect to which a payment has been made pursuant to this
_Section 9.3_, then the Seller shall pay the Purchaser or the Acquired
Company an amount equal to such reduction plus any interest or penalties
imposed by the Governmental Entity with respect to such reduction.



 

MASTER ACQUISITION AGREEMENT

 



63 9.4 _Cooperation_. In addition to the Purchasers agreements under  _Section
10.3(b)_, each of the Seller and the Purchaser agree that it will (and will
cause its respective Affiliates to):

(a) Provide assistance to the other party as reasonably requested in
preparing and filing Tax Returns, responding to Tax Contests, and recovering
any Indirect Tax or Transfer Tax, in each case, relating to Taxes concerning
the Acquired Companies, the other Acquired Assets, or the Business;

(b) Make available to the other party as reasonably requested all information,
records and documents relating to Taxes concerning the Acquired Companies,
the Acquired Assets and the Business (including any information, records or
documents that the Seller reasonably requests to allow the Seller (or any of
its Affiliates) to timely and properly file any Seller Prepared Tax Return,
including any Tax Return for any affiliated, combined, unitary or consolidated
group that includes the Seller (or any of its Affiliates) and any Acquired
Company);

 

(c) Retain any Tax Returns and other books and records that could reasonably
be expected to be necessary or useful in connection with any preparation or
filing by any other party of any Tax Returns concerning the Acquired
Companies, the other Acquired Assets or the Business, or any Tax Contest or
other examination or proceeding relating to Taxes concerning the Acquired
Companies, the other Acquired Assets or the Business. Such books and records
will be retained until the expiration of the applicable statute of limitations
(including extensions thereof);

 

(d) Execute any powers of attorney or other documents that will allow an
Indemnifying Party to take control of a Tax Contest as contemplated by
_Section 8.3_;

(e) Use Reasonable Efforts to obtain any certificate or other document from
any Governmental Entity or any other Person as may be necessary to mitigate,
reduce or eliminate any Tax that could be imposed (including with respect to
the transactions under this Agreement); and

 

(f) Provide assistance with respect to the timely filing of the New Domestic
Use Agreement.

 

9.5 _Tax Returns of the Acquired Companies_.

 

(a) The Seller, at its sole cost and expense, shall prepare and timely file,
or cause to be prepared and timely filed, all Tax Returns of the Acquired
Companies due prior to the Initial Closing Date and all Income Tax Returns of,
or with respect to, any Acquired Company for any Pre-Closing Period (whether
due on, before, or after the Initial Closing Date) (collectively, "
_Seller Prepared Returns_ "). All Seller Prepared Returns shall be prepared
on a basis consistent with current practices, procedures, and accounting
methods of the Seller and the Acquired Company to the extent permitted by
applicable law. Not less than thirty (30) days prior to the due date (after
applicable extensions) of any Income Tax Return due after the Initial Closing
Date or thirty (30) days prior to filing any Income Tax Return or other
material Tax Return that was due prior to the Initial Closing Date, but will
actually be filed after the Initial Closing Date, the Seller shall submit such
Tax Return for the Purchasers review and comment and consent, which shall not
be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed. If the parties are unable
to agree on the Seller Prepared Returns, then the provisions of _Section
9.5(c)_ shall apply.



 

MASTER ACQUISITION AGREEMENT

 



64 (b) The Purchaser, at its sole cost and expense, shall prepare and timely
file, or caused to be prepared and timely filed, all Tax Returns of the
Acquired Companies (other than Seller Prepared Returns) (collectively, "
_Purchaser Prepared Returns_ "). All Purchaser Prepared Returns, to the extent
they relate to a Pre-Closing Period or Straddle Period shall be prepared on a
basis consistent with current practices, procedures, and accounting methods of
the Seller and the Acquired Company to the extent permitted by applicable Law
and Order. Not less than thirty (30) days prior to the due date (after
applicable extensions) of any Purchaser Prepared Return that relates to a Pre-
Closing Period or Straddle Period, the Purchaser shall submit such Tax Return
for the Sellers review, comment, and consent, which shall not be
unreasonably withheld, conditioned, or delayed. If the parties are unable to
agree on the Seller Prepared Returns, then the provisions of _Section 9.5(c)_
shall apply.

 

(c) The Purchaser and the Seller shall undertake in good faith to resolve any
issues with respect to the Seller Prepared Returns and the Purchaser Prepared
Returns. If the Purchaser and the Seller are unable to resolve any issue
within ten (10) Business Days of the due date (including any extension
thereof) for filing of the Tax Return in question, then the Seller and
Purchaser shall jointly engage an Independent Accounting Firm (in the manner
set forth in _Section 2.5(c)_) to resolve such dispute (adopting, for this
purposes, a "more-likely-than-not" standard for what constitutes applicable
Law and Order), and the decision of such Independent Accounting Firm shall be
final and binding on the Parties. If any dispute with respect to a Tax Return
is not resolved prior to the due date of such Tax Return, such Tax Return
shall be filled in the manner that the party responsible for preparing the
Tax Return believes is appropriate without prejudice to the resolution of such
dispute; _provided_ that if the Purchaser reasonably believes that a position
proposed by the Seller will result in any employee of the Purchaser or any
Acquired Company being exposed to criminal sanctions that would be avoided if
the Purchasers position is followed, the Tax Return shall be initially filed
in a manner that the Purchaser reasonably believes is appropriate without
prejudice to the resolution of such dispute; _provided_ , _further_ , that,
once resolution of such dispute has been determined, such Tax Return shall be
amended, if necessary, to include the final resolution of such dispute.

Period); or (g) make any voluntary disclosures to any Governmental Entity with
respect to Taxes or Tax Returns of any Acquired Company for a Pre-Closing
Period (or Straddle Period), in each case, if any action set forth in clauses
(a) through (g) could result in any Acquired Company incurring any Tax for a
Pre-Closing Period (or Straddle Period) or could result in the Seller (or any
of its Affiliates) paying any additional Taxes. Following the Initial Closing,
the Purchaser shall not, and shall not allow any of its Affiliates (including
any Acquired Company) to agree to extend, waive, or toll any statute
of limitations with respect to the assessment or collection of any Tax of any
Acquired Company for any Pre-Closing Period (or Straddle Period) (without the
prior written consent of the Seller, which may consent shall not be withheld,

Taxes result from the Purchasers failure to comply with the New Domestic Use
Agreement).

(b) The New Domestic Use Agreement shall include the language "New Domestic
Use Agreement" set forth on top of such agreement, shall be appropriately
signed under penalties of perjury by the officer of the Purchaser that is
signing its U.S. federal Income Tax Return for the relevant year, and shall
include all of the information specified in Treasury Regulation Section

MASTER ACQUISITION AGREEMENT

 



66 (d) Within ninety (90) days of the end of each taxable year for U.S. federal
Income Tax purposes ending on or after the Initial Closing Date, the
Purchaser shall deliver to the Seller a certification signed by the Chief
Financial Officer of the Purchaser that certifies (I) either (i) without
exception (A) that the Purchaser (and its Affiliates) have complied with the
requirements of this _Section 9.8_ and the provisions of the New Domestic Use
Agreement and (B) that no "triggering event" (as such term is used in Treasury
Regulation Section 1.1503(d)) has occurred in the prior year with respect to
any "dual consolidated loss" set forth on _Schedule 9.8(a)_ and such "dual
consolidated losses" have not otherwise been lost or recaptured; or (ii) with
exception (A) that the Purchaser (and its Affiliates) have complied with the
requirements of this _Section 9.8_ and the provisions of the New Domestic Use
Agreement and (B) that no "triggering event" (as such term is used in
Treasury Regulation Section 1.1503(d)) has occurred in the prior year with
respect to any "dual consolidated losses" set forth on _Schedule 9.8(a)_
(accompanied by a reasonable description of the exceptions to (A) and (B) and
a reasonable computation of the Taxes payable as a result of such exceptions),
and (II) that the Purchaser (and its Affiliates) have timely paid all Taxes
resulting from any exceptions set forth in the certification or that are
otherwise payable with respect to the recapture or other loss (including from

9.8(a)_.

 

(e) To the extent applicable, the Seller shall properly and timely include in
its U.S. federal income tax return for the year including the Initial
Closing, the required statements under Treasury Regulation section
1.1503(d)-6(e)(2) with respect to the Reynosa Outsourcing Transaction prior to
the Initial Closing (the " _Rebuttal of Triggering Event_ "). The Rebuttal
of Triggering Event statement shall include all of the information specified
in Treasury Regulation section 1.1503(d)-6(e)(2). No later than thirty (30)
days prior to filing the U.S. federal income Tax Return of the Seller for the
year including the Initial Closing, the Seller shall provide to the Purchaser
a draft copy of the Rebuttal of Triggering Event for the Purchasers review
and comment. The Seller shall pay all Taxes resulting from any Governmental
Entity successfully challenging the Rebuttal of Triggering Event (such
amounts, the " _Rebuttal of Triggering Event Taxes_ ").

9.9 _Tax Sharing Agreements_. All Tax sharing agreements with respect to and
involving the Acquired Companies shall be cancelled (or appropriately amended)
so that no Acquired Company has any rights or obligations thereunder after the
Initial Closing. 

9.10 _Tax Savings_. Without duplication to any amounts determined under
_Section 8.5(c)_, if as a result of any adjustment by any Governmental
Entity or the filing of an amended Tax Return required by any Governmental
Entity, the Seller (or any of its Affiliates, including any Acquired Company
for any period (or portions thereof) ending on or prior to the
applicable Closing Date) realizes an item of income or gain for Income Tax
purposes (or any reduction in any deduction or loss or credit for Income Tax
purposes) and any of the Purchaser and its Affiliates actually realizes a Tax
Savings, the Purchaser shall pay to the Seller the amount of such Tax Savings
as a result of such corresponding adjustment. Such amounts shall be paid to
the Seller within ten (10) days of filing the Tax Return claiming the Tax
Savings (or if it is in the form of a refund, ten (10) days of receiving the
refund). The Purchaser shall, upon the request of



 

MASTER ACQUISITION AGREEMENT

 



67  the Seller and at the Sellers expense, cause the Acquired Companies to file
all Tax Returns (including amended Tax Returns required by any Governmental
Entity), and use all other Reasonable Efforts, to obtain or expedite the
claiming or otherwise obtaining any Tax Savings (including any refund) that
will rise to the payment to the Seller under this _Section 9.10_ or _Section
8.5(c)_. The Purchaser shall permit the Seller to participate (at the
Sellers expense) in the prosecution of any claim for refund that is the
benefit of the Seller under this _Section 9.10_ or _Section 8.5(c)_. If
there is a subsequent reduction by a Governmental Entity of any amounts with
respect to which a payment has been made pursuant to this _Section 9.10_,
then the Seller shall pay the Purchaser or the Acquired Company an amount
equal to such reduction plus any interest or penalties imposed by the
Governmental Entity with respect to such reduction.

9.11 _NOLs and Tax Attributes_. The Purchaser shall not allow any Acquired
Company to carry back any net operating loss or other Tax attribute or credit
into a Pre-Closing Period without the prior written consent of the Seller,
which may not be unreasonably withheld, delayed or conditioned.

 

9.12 _Seller s Election_. The Seller shall make a timely and proper election
(or cause its applicable Affiliate to make an election) under Treasury
Regulation Section 1.1502-36(d)(6) with respect to the acquisition of the
stock under this Agreement and shall within thirty (30) days of filing such
election provide the executed and filed election forms (and other
relevant information) filed with the Internal Revenue Service to the
Purchaser.

9.13 _Tax Withholding_. Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the
contrary, Purchaser and the Acquired Companies or their respective designees
will be entitled to withhold and deduct from any amounts payable pursuant to
this Agreement such amounts as such Person is required to deduct and
withhold with respect to the making of such payment under the Code or any
provision of state, local or foreign Tax law. To the extent that amounts are
so withheld, such amounts will be treated for all purposes of this Agreement
as having been paid to the Person in respect of which such deduction and
withholding were made. To the extent the Purchaser determines that it may need
to withhold under this _Section 9.13_, it shall provide reasonable notice to
Seller and work in good faith to reduce or eliminate such withholding.

ARTICLE 10

 

OTHER AGREEMENTS

10.1  _Further Assurances_.

(a) Without limiting the other provisions of this Agreement, prior to and
following the Initial Closing, each party agrees to cooperate fully with the
other party and to execute such further instruments, documents and agreements,
and to give such further written assurances, as may be reasonably requested by
any other party to evidence, give effect to or otherwise implement the
Contemplated Transactions and to carry into effect the intents and purposes of
this Agreement and the Contemplated Transactions. In connection therewith,
each party agrees to comply, and will cause its applicable Affiliates to
comply, with its respective pre-Closing commitments, obligations and covenants
under the other Principal Agreements. The Purchaser and the Seller shall
promptly execute and deliver to the other party, as may be reasonably
requested and without payment of any additional consideration, any other
assurances



 

MASTER ACQUISITION AGREEMENT

 



68  or additional documents or instruments necessary, proper or advisable to
consummate the Contemplated Transactions by, and to carry out fully the
purposes of, the Transaction Agreements. Without limiting the generality of
the foregoing, the Seller shall from time to time when reasonably requested by
the Purchaser, including after the applicable Closing, and without further
consideration, promptly take further action or execute and deliver, or cause
to be executed and delivered, to the Purchaser or its designee all such
documents necessary or advisable to vest in the Purchaser all right, title and
interest in and to the Acquired Companies and the Acquired Assets, in
accordance with the Transaction Agreements.

(b) Without limiting the foregoing, with reference to the Transition Services
Agreement, each party agrees that, from the date hereof through the Initial
Closing, it will cooperate fully with the other party in identifying and
agreeing in good faith upon the Transition Services (as defined in the
Transition Services Agreement) and the details thereof to be set forth on
Annex A or Annex B thereto in respect of such Transition Services as
reasonably necessary for the transfer of the Business to the Purchaser Group
and the operation of the Business after the Initial Closing. Except as set
forth in the Transition Services Agreement, such Transition Services will be
provided for a period not to exceed twelve (12) months and for consideration
as set forth in the Transition Services Agreement equal to the cost of such
Transition Service charged or allocated internally immediately prior to the
date of this Agreement by the Seller or its Affiliates to the Business, and
shall be limited to those services performed for the Business immediately
prior to the date of this Agreement. The parties shall use Reasonable Efforts
to finalize Annex A and Annex B to the Transition Services Agreement within
sixty (60) days from the date of this Agreement, but in any event shall
finalize Annex A and Annex B to the Transition Services Agreement no later
than the Initial Closing.

10.2 _Wrong Pocket_. In the event the Seller or any of its Affiliates receives
any payment related to any Acquired Asset after the Initial Closing, the
Seller agrees to promptly remit (or cause to be promptly remitted) such funds
to the Purchaser. In the event that the Purchaser or any Affiliate of the
Purchaser (including, for the avoidance of doubt, the Acquired Companies)
receives any payment related to any Excluded Asset after the Initial Closing,
the Purchaser agrees to promptly remit (or cause to be promptly remitted) such
funds to the Seller. In the event that any Cash held by the Seller Group in a
Transferred Account is not transferred or distributed out of such account by
the Seller Group prior to the Initial Closing, and the amount of such Cash is
not taken into account in the calculation of Final Closing Cash, the
Purchaser agrees to promptly remit (or cause to be promptly remitted) such
funds to the Seller.

10.3 _Cooperation; Records and Documents_.

(a) In the event and for so long as either party (the " _Contesting Party_ ")
is actively contesting, defending against, or undertaking any activity or
internal investigation in preparation for or that may be expected to result in
any Legal Proceeding in connection with or related to (i) any Contemplated
Transaction or (ii) any fact, situation, circumstance, status, condition,
activity, practice, plan, occurrence, event, incident, action, failure to act
or transaction on or prior to the Initial Closing Date involving the Business,
the other party shall (x) cooperate with the Contesting Party and its counsel
in the contest, defense, or internal investigation, (y) make available its
personnel, and (z) provide such testimony and access to its books and records,
in each case as may be necessary in connection with the contest, defense, or
investigation, at the



 

MASTER ACQUISITION AGREEMENT

 



69  sole cost and expense of the Contesting Party (unless the Contesting Party
is entitled to indemnification therefor under _Article 8_ ). Without limiting
the foregoing, each party will, and will cause each of its Affiliates to, use
Reasonable Efforts to make available to each other, upon written request, its
past and present Representatives as witnesses to the extent that any such
Representatives may reasonably be required (giving consideration to the
business demands upon such Representatives) in connection with any Legal
Proceeding in which the requesting party may from time to time be involved.
The parties further agree that any such contest, defense, or
internal investigation related to an indemnification claim under _Article 8_
or _Article 9_ shall be treated as a Third Party Claim after the Initial
Closing Date, even if first brought to the attention of the Seller or the
Purchaser by a source other than a Third Party. The provisions of this
_Section 10.3(a)_ shall not be applicable in the case of any Legal Proceeding
by one party to this Agreement against the other.

 

(b) Following the Initial Closing Date, the Seller shall grant to the
Purchaser and its Representatives, at the Purchasers reasonable request
(subject to any limitations that are reasonably required to preserve any
applicable privilege or third party confidentiality obligation), reasonable
access during normal business hours and under reasonable circumstances to, and
the right to make copies at the Purchasers sole expense of, those records
and documents in the Sellers possession related to the Business, the Acquired
Companies, the Acquired Assets or the Assumed Liabilities as may be reasonably
necessary for the Purchasers operation of the Business after each applicable
Closing. Following the Initial Closing Date, the Purchaser shall grant to the
Seller and its Representatives, at the Sellers reasonable request (subject to
any limitations that are reasonably required to preserve any applicable
privilege or third party confidentiality obligation), reasonable access during
normal business hours and under reasonable circumstances to, and the right to
make copies at the Sellers sole expense of, those records and documents
covering any period prior to each applicable Closing related to the Business,
the Acquired Companies or the Acquired Assets as may be reasonably necessary
for litigation, preparation of financial statements, Tax Returns and Tax
Contests or other valid business purposes. If the Purchaser elects to dispose
of any of such records within six (6) years after the Initial Closing Date,
the Purchaser shall first give the Seller sixty (60) days written notice,
during which period the Seller shall have the right to take such records
without payment of consideration. If so requested by either the Seller or the
Purchaser, the other party shall enter into a customary joint defense
agreement with the Seller or the Purchaser with respect to any information to
be provided to such party pursuant to this _Section 10.3(b)_. All rights of
access to information and documents granted under this _Section 10.3_ are
subject to restrictions on access to classified facilities and information
imposed by Governmental Entities. Each party agrees that any investigation
undertaken pursuant to the access granted under this _Section 10.3_ shall be
conducted in such a manner as not to unreasonably interfere with the
operation of the other partys business. Notwithstanding anything to the
contrary in this Agreement, neither party nor any of its respective Affiliates
shall be required to provide access to or disclose information where, upon
the advice of counsel, such access or disclosure would jeopardize attorney-
client privilege or contravene any Laws or Orders.

 

10.4 _Indemnification_. The Purchaser will not (and will cause STI and Psion
not to), for such period of time as is necessary to comply with obligations
set forth in the definitive acquisition agreements governing the acquisitions
by the Seller of each of STI and Psion, take any action to alter or impair any
exculpatory or indemnification provisions now existing in the

 



MASTER ACQUISITION AGREEMENT

 



70  charter or bylaws (or comparable constituent document) of each of STI or
Psion for the benefit of any individual who served as a director or officer of
STI or Psion, as applicable, at any time prior to the Initial Closing (each
an " _Affiliate Indemnified Party_ "), except for any changes which may be
required to conform with changes in applicable Law or Order and any changes
which do not affect the application of such provisions to acts or omissions
of such individuals prior to the Initial Closing. In addition, for a period of
six (6) years after the Initial Closing, the Purchaser agrees to cover under
its DandO insurance policies and indemnification policies each individual who
serves as a director or officer of an Acquired Company immediately prior to
the applicable Closing and is to continue as a director or officer of such
Acquired Company following the applicable Closing Date. Without limiting the
generality of the foregoing, and notwithstanding the provisions of _Section
8.7_ hereof, the provisions of this _Section 10.4_ are intended for the
benefit of, and may be enforced by, each of the Affiliate Indemnified Parties
and their respective heirs.

10.5 _Confidential Information_. The parties agree as follows:

 

(a) The Seller agrees that following the Initial Closing Date it shall, and
shall cause its directors, officers, employees, advisors and Affiliates to,
keep the Business Confidential Information (as defined below), confidential
for a period of three (3) years from the Initial Closing Date (and, with
respect to any and all trade secrets, for so long as such trade secrets
are protectable under applicable Law), except that any Business Confidential
Information may be disclosed if such disclosure is (i) required by or
requested pursuant to any applicable Law or Order (including those promulgated
by the SEC), including any information required to be disclosed in any
Offering Document to make such information accurate in all material respects,
or (ii) necessary to establish rights under this Agreement. For purposes
hereof, the term " _Business Confidential Information_ " means all
information (including written, graphical or machine readable information that
relates to trade secrets, product plans, vendor and customer information,
business plans and data stored electronically) to the extent it relates to
the Business, the Acquired Companies, the Acquired Assets or the Assumed
Liabilities, other than any such information that (A) is available to the
public on the Initial Closing Date, or thereafter becomes available to the
public other than as a result of a breach of this _Section 10.5(a)_; (B) is
disclosed by the Purchaser to a Third Party without an obligation of
confidentiality; (C) is developed by the Seller independently of the
Business; or (D) is received by the Seller after the Initial Closing Date
from a Third Party without any obligation of confidentiality.

(b) The Purchaser agrees that following the Initial Closing Date it shall,
and shall cause its directors, officers, employees, advisors and Affiliates
(including the Acquired Companies) to, keep the Seller Confidential
Information (as defined below) confidential for a period of three (3) years
from the Initial Closing Date (and, with respect to any and all trade secrets,
for so long as such trade secrets are protectable under applicable Law),
except that any Seller Confidential Information may be disclosed if such
disclosure is (i) required or requested pursuant to any applicable Law or
Order (including those promulgated by the SEC) or (ii) necessary to establish
rights under this Agreement. For purposes hereof, the term " _Seller
Confidential Information_ " means all information (including written,
graphical or machine readable information that relates to trade secrets,
product plans, vendor and customer information, business plans and data
stored electronically) of the Seller and its Affiliates (excluding, for such
purpose and for the avoidance of any doubt, the Acquired Companies) that



 

MASTER ACQUISITION AGREEMENT

 



71  relates to the Excluded Assets or the Excluded Liabilities and provided to
the Purchaser in connection with the Contemplated Transactions or otherwise in
the possession of the Purchaser or one of its Affiliates (including an
Acquired Company) following the Initial Closing, other than any such
information that (A) is available to the public on the Initial Closing Date,
or thereafter becomes available to the public other than as a result of a
breach of this _Section 10.5(b)_; (B) is disclosed by the Seller to a Third
Party without an obligation of confidentiality; (C) is developed by the
Purchaser independently of the Seller; or (D) is received by the Purchaser
after the Initial Closing Date from a Third Party without any obligation of
confidentiality.

(c) In no event will the Purchaser or any Acquired Company or any Affiliate
or agent of those Persons involved in the operation of the Business advertise
or hold itself out as the Seller or any then-current Affiliate of the Seller
after the Initial Closing Date. In no event will the Seller or any member of
the Seller or any Affiliate or agent of those Persons hold itself out as the
Purchaser or any Affiliate of the Purchaser after the Initial Closing Date.

 

10.6 _Assignment of Contracts and Permits_. Notwithstanding any other
provision of this Agreement, this Agreement does not constitute an agreement
to assign or transfer, or effect an assignment or transfer, of any Assumed
Contract, Assumed Real Property Lease or Assigned Permit, or any claim or
right or any benefit arising thereunder or resulting therefrom, with respect
to which the Seller has not obtained a required consent to assignment or
transfer as of the applicable Closing and an attempted assignment or transfer
thereof without the consent of a Third Party (including any Governmental
Entity) would constitute a breach or other contravention thereof or a
violation of Law or Order. As to any such Assumed Contract, Assumed Real
Property Lease or Assigned Permit, (a) the Seller agrees to continue to use
Reasonable Efforts following the applicable Closing Date to obtain any
required consent(s), and the Purchaser agrees to use Reasonable Efforts to
cooperate in connection with same until the date that is twelve (12) months
following the applicable Closing Date, and (b) the parties agree to
cooperate in good faith to take such actions as are reasonably necessary to
avoid any breach or violation by a party as a result of any failure to obtain
any required consent prior to the applicable Closing. The Purchaser and the
Seller shall each pay one half of any payment reasonably required by any
Third Party for any such consent. If on the applicable Closing Date, any such
consent is not obtained or an attempted transfer or assignment would be
ineffective or a violation of Law or Order or would impair any member of the
Purchaser Groups rights thereto or thereunder so that the Purchaser Group
would not receive all such rights, then the Seller and the Purchaser will use
Reasonable Efforts to cooperate for twelve (12) months following the
applicable Closing in any lawful and reasonable arrangement, to the extent so
permitted under the terms of such Assumed Contract, Assumed Real Property
Lease or Assigned Permit and applicable Law and Order, to provide the
Purchaser Group the obligations and benefits of any such Assumed Contract,
Assumed Real Property Lease or Assigned Permit, including subcontracting,
licensing or sublicensing to the Purchaser Group of any or all of the Seller
Groups rights and obligations with respect to such Acquired Asset. In any
such arrangement, the Purchaser will (i) bear the sole responsibility for
completion of the work or provision of goods and services, (ii) bear Taxes
with respect thereto or arising therefrom, (iii) be solely entitled to all
benefits thereof, economic or otherwise, (iv) be solely responsible for any
warranty or breach thereof, any repurchase, indemnity and service obligations
thereof, and (v) promptly reimburse the reasonable costs and expenses of the
Seller and its Affiliates related thereto. If and when such consents or
approvals are obtained or such other required actions have been taken, the
transfer of such Assumed Contract, Assumed Real Property Lease or Assigned
Permit will be effected in accordance with the terms of this Agreement.



 

MASTER ACQUISITION AGREEMENT

 



72 10.7 _Shared Contracts_.

 

(a) Within forty-five (45) days after the execution of this Agreement, the
Seller shall use Reasonable Efforts to provide the Purchaser with a list of
all material Shared Contracts, indicating which of such material Shared
Contracts may be split and assigned in part to a member of the Purchaser Group
or replicated for the benefit of the Purchaser Group pursuant to its terms,
without the consent of the counterparty thereto or other conditions,
including the payment of a transfer or other fee (the " _Assignable Shared
Contracts_ "). Within thirty (30) days after receipt thereof, the Purchaser
will provide the Seller with written notice of those Assignable Shared
Contracts that a member of the Purchaser Group desires to have split and
assume in part or for the Seller to replicate for the Purchaser Groups
benefit. Each Assignable Shared Contract for which the Purchaser provides
written notice of its desire to have split and assume in part or have
replicated for its benefit shall thereafter be deemed (to the extent of the
requested split or replication) to be an Assumed Contract hereunder and the
Seller Group shall split and partially assign to the Purchaser Group or have
replicated for the benefit of the Purchaser Group as of the applicable Closing
such Contract in accordance with its terms.

 

(b) With respect to each material Shared Contract identified pursuant to the
first sentence of _subsection (a)_ above that is not an Assignable Shared
Contract (the " _Non-Assignable Shared Contracts_ "), the Purchaser will also,
within thirty (30) days after receipt thereof, provide the Seller with written
notice of those Non-Assignable Shared Contracts that the Purchaser Group
desires to have split and assume in part or have replicated for the benefit of
the Purchaser Group. Each party shall use Reasonable Efforts prior to the
applicable Closing Date to cause the counterparty to each such Non-Assignable
Shared Contract to consent to the split and partial assignment or replication
of such Non-Assignable Shared Contract to the Purchaser Group, or to otherwise
enter into a new Contract with a member of the Purchaser Group
on substantially the same terms as exist under the applicable Shared
Contract, in each case as of the applicable Closing. Each such Non-Assignable
Shared Contract for which the parties have received consent to the split and
partial assignment or replication shall thereafter be deemed (to the extent
of the requested split or replication) to be an Assumed Contract hereunder and
the Seller Group shall split and partially assign to the Purchaser Group or
have replicated as of the applicable Closing such Contract in accordance with
its terms. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Seller Group shall not be
required to split and partially assign to the Purchaser Group or have
replicated at the applicable Closing any of the Non-Assignable Shared
Contracts for which consent has not been obtained. To the extent any
counterparty under a Non-Assignable Shared Contract requires the payment of a
transfer or other fee for the split and partial assignment or replication of
such Shared Contract, the Purchaser and the Seller shall each pay one half of
any such fee that is reasonably required. As to any Non-Assignable Shared
Contract for which the parties have not received consent, (a) the Seller
agrees to continue to use Reasonable Efforts following the applicable Closing
Date to obtain any required consent(s), and the Purchaser agrees to use
Reasonable Efforts to cooperate in connection with same until the date that is
twelve (12) months following the applicable Closing Date, and (b) the parties
agree to cooperate in good faith to take such actions as are reasonably
necessary to avoid any breach or violation by a party as a result of any
failure to obtain any required consent prior to the applicable Closing.



MASTER ACQUISITION AGREEMENT

 



73  Until any such consent or new Contract is obtained, the Seller and the
Purchaser will use Reasonable Efforts to cooperate for twelve (12) months
following the Initial Closing, in any lawful and reasonable arrangement, to
the extent such cooperation would not result in a breach of the terms of such
Non-Assignable Shared Contract, and not prohibited under applicable Law or
Order, which will provide the Purchaser Group the obligations and benefits of
any such Non-Assignable Shared Contract with respect to the Business,
including subcontracting, licensing, sublicensing, leasing or subleasing to
the Purchaser Group any or all of the Seller Groups rights and obligations
with respect to such Non-Assignable Shared Contract with respect to the
Business. In any such arrangement, the Purchaser will with respect to the
obligations and benefits under the Non-Assignable Shared Contracts that relate
to the Business (i) bear the sole responsibility for completion of the work
or provision of goods and services, (ii) bear all Taxes with respect thereto
or arising therefrom, (iii) be solely entitled to all benefits thereof,
economic or otherwise, (iv) be solely responsible for any warranty or breach
thereof, any repurchase, indemnity and service obligations thereof, and (v)
promptly reimburse the reasonable costs and expenses of the Seller and its
Affiliates related thereto, in each case, solely to the extent each of the
foregoing arise out of or relate to the use by the Business of the Non-
Assignable Shared Contracts. If and when such consents or approvals are
obtained or such other required actions have been taken, the split
and partial assignment, or replication, of such Non-Assignable Shared
Contract will be effected in accordance with the terms of this Agreement.

 

(c) The Seller and the Purchaser each agree that "Reasonable Efforts" for
purposes of this _Section 10.7_ includes an obligation on the Purchaser to
provide financial information, subject to receipt from the counterparty to a
Shared Contract of an executed confidentiality agreement, and the Purchaser
agrees to, and agrees to cause any of its subsidiaries to, enter into a
guaranty, in each case, as may be reasonably requested by the counterparty to
a Shared Contract.

10.8 _Transfer of Acquired Assets; Risk of Loss_.

(a) Promptly following each applicable Closing Date, the Purchaser will (i) at
the Purchasers cost and expense, prepare for relocation the Acquired Assets
located at any facilities currently occupied by the Seller or any of its
Affiliates which facilities are not to be purchased, assigned, subleased,
transferred to or otherwise occupied by the Purchaser Group pursuant to this
Agreement, the Lease/Sublease Agreements, the Joint Use and Occupancy Agreements
or any other agreement entered into in connection with the Contemplated
Transactions, or, if a third party facility, the contract for which is not an
Assumed Contract (each such facility, an " _Excluded Seller Facility_ ") and
remove and relocate such Acquired Assets from the relevant Excluded Seller
Facility, and (ii) be responsible for all data transfer (including from the
Seller Group information databases, servers, or data infrastructure
facilities), delivery, transmission and reformatting costs and expenses
related to the transfer of the Acquired Assets; _provided_ , _however_ , each
of the Purchaser and the Seller shall be responsible for one-half of any costs
and expenses incurred by the Purchaser or the Seller in connection with any
actions reasonably required by a third party to remove Business Confidential
Information or Seller Confidential Information, as applicable, in connection
with the transfer of data referred to in clause (ii). Subject to the
provisions hereof, the Seller agrees to cooperate, and agrees to cause the
other members of the Seller Group to cooperate, with the Purchaser Group and
provide the Purchaser Group all assistance reasonably requested by the
Purchaser in connection with the



 

MASTER ACQUISITION AGREEMENT

 



74  planning and implementation of the removal and relocation of any Acquired
Assets or any portion of any of them to such location as the Purchaser will
designate. The Acquired Assets will be transported by or on behalf of the
Purchaser, and until all of the Acquired Assets are removed from an Excluded
Seller Facility, the Seller will permit, and will cause its Affiliates to
permit, the Purchaser and its authorized Representatives, upon reasonable
prior notice, to have reasonable access to such Excluded Seller Facility
during normal business hours to the extent necessary to disconnect, detach,
remove, package and crate the Acquired Assets for transport. The Purchaser
will be responsible for (A) disconnecting and detaching all fixtures and
equipment that are Acquired Assets from the roof, floor, ceiling and walls of
an Excluded Seller Facility so as to be freely removed from such Excluded
Seller Facility by the Purchaser Group (and shall repair all damage caused by
such removal), (B) packaging and loading the Acquired Assets for transporting
to and reinstalling the Acquired Assets at such location(s) as the Purchaser
will determine, and (C) repairing any damage that is caused by such removal
and leaving the Excluded Seller Facility clean and free of debris and in a
safe condition with no exposed wiring.

 

(b) All risk of loss as to the Acquired Assets will be borne by, and will pass
to, the Purchaser Group as of the applicable Closing for each such Acquired
Asset.

10.9 _Certain Real Property Matters_.

 

(a) At each applicable Closing, the Purchaser shall reimburse the Seller Group
for an amount equal to the total of any and all security deposit monies then
being held by the landlords under the Assumed Real Property Leases. With
respect to the letters of credit or other similar instruments held by the
applicable landlord under an Assumed Real Property Lease (each, a "
_Lease Security Instrument_ ") as security for performance of the tenants
obligations under such Assumed Real Property Lease, the Purchaser shall use
Reasonable Efforts to cause each and every such Lease Security Instrument to
be returned to the Seller promptly following the applicable Closing Date. The
Purchaser agrees, unconditionally and irrevocably, to reimburse and indemnify
the Seller and its Affiliates for and against all payments, costs and expenses
incurred after the applicable Closing and relating to any Lease Security
Instrument that is not replaced, released, terminated or returned on or prior
to the applicable Closing Date, in each case until the release of the Sellers
and its Affiliates obligations with respect thereto. All claims by the
Seller hereunder and any reimbursements and indemnities by the Purchaser
required hereunder shall be made in accordance with the procedures set forth
in _Section 8.3_, but shall not be subject to the limitations set forth in
_Section 8.5_.

(b) At the Purchasers sole cost and expense, the Purchaser shall promptly
and, in any event, within one hundred and eighty (180) days following the
applicable Closing Date, remove, or cause to be removed, from the Acquired
Real Property any and all identification signage, including signs, windows or
door lettering, placards or decorations (collectively, the " _Seller Signage_
"), relating to the Seller Group or containing any Intellectual Property of
the Seller Group other than the rights of the Seller (if any) which were
transferred to the Purchaser pursuant to the IP Agreement.

(c) The Purchaser acknowledges and agrees that (i) as of the applicable
Closing Date, the Seller Group may cancel any and all of its insurance
policies and coverages with respect to the Acquired Real Property, and (ii)
following the applicable Closing Date, (A)



 

MASTER ACQUISITION AGREEMENT

 



75  the Purchaser assumes any and all Liabilities with respect to maintaining
insurance on the Acquired Real Property, and (B) the Seller Group shall have
no Liability whatsoever with respect thereto.

10.10 _Closing of Books_. Each party agrees to consult in good faith and
cooperate with the other party and its Representatives, including by making
its employees and advisors available to the other party as reasonably
requested, in the closing of the Seller Groups books and records with respect
to the Business as of the Initial Closing Date in accordance with the
Sellers regular closing schedule and procedures.

10.11 _Non-Competition_.

 

(a) For a period beginning on the Initial Closing Date until the date which is
three (3) years after the Initial Closing Date, the Seller will not, and will
not permit any of its Affiliates to, directly or indirectly, in any country in
which the Business is conducted as of the Initial Closing Date, own, manage,
operate, control or participate in the ownership, management, operation
or control of any business that is engaged in any Business Activity for
Enterprise Products or products substantially similar to Enterprise Products
(collectively, the " _Seller Competitive Activities_ ").

 

(b) Notwithstanding the foregoing, and for the avoidance of doubt, the
provisions of _Section 10.11(a)_ shall not prohibit the Seller or any of its
Affiliates from (i) engaging in Business Activities with respect to (A)
Purchaser Excluded Products; or (B) Public Safety LTE Smartphone Devices; or
(ii) reselling Enterprise Wireless LAN Products together with the sale of
Purchaser Excluded Products.

(c) Notwithstanding the provisions of _Section 10.11(a)_, the acquisition
(by asset purchase, stock purchase, merger, consolidation or otherwise) by
the Seller or any of its Affiliates of the stock, business or assets of any
Person that at the time of such acquisition is engaged in Seller Competitive
Activities, and the continuation of such Seller Competitive Activities
following such acquisition shall not be in breach of the terms of this
_Section 10.11_ if: (i) the portion of the revenues of such Person and its
subsidiaries on a consolidated basis for the most recent fiscal year ending
prior to the date of such acquisition that is attributable to Seller
Competitive Activities by such Person and its subsidiaries account for less
than twenty percent (20%) of the revenues of such Person and its subsidiaries
on a consolidated basis for such fiscal year; and (ii) the Seller uses
Reasonable Efforts to divest, or causes its Affiliates to use Reasonable
Efforts to divest, such Seller Competitive Activities within twelve (12)
months after the consummation of such acquisition.

(d) Nothing in this _Section 10.11_ will restrict or prevent the Seller or
any of its Affiliates from maintaining and/or undertaking passive investments
in Persons primarily engaged in the Seller Competitive Activities so long as
the aggregate interest represented by such investments does not exceed (i)
five percent (5%) of any class of the outstanding debt or equity securities
of any such Person, in the case of a Person whose shares are listed on a
national securities exchange or the NASDAQ National Market System or
equivalent foreign exchange or quotation system or (ii) ten percent (10%) of
any class of the outstanding equity or debt securities in the case of any
other Person.



 

MASTER ACQUISITION AGREEMENT

 



76 10.12 _Reimbursement of Certain Financing Costs_. If the Initial Closing
occurs on a date following the six (6) month anniversary of the date hereof,
the Seller agrees to reimburse the Purchaser, by wire transfer of immediately
available funds to an account designated by the Purchaser, an amount equal to
the Seller Percentage Share of the Incremental Financing Fees. For purposes
of this _Section 10.12_, " _Incremental Financing Fees_ " means all fees and
interest expense actually paid by the Purchaser to the Financing Sources (a)
in respect of the Term Facility (as defined in the Fee Letter) ticking fee on
the term loan commitments from and after the six (6) month anniversary of the
date hereof until the Initial Closing Date, and (b) if, following a debt
securities offering that decreases the bridge commitment, the Financing
Sources fund the proceeds of such offering into escrow to reduce their bridge
loan commitment, in respect of the accrued interest on the high yield notes
from the closing date of the Securities Offering into escrow to the Initial
Closing Date. Also for purposes of this _Section 10.12_, the " _Seller
Percentage Share_ " shall be an amount equal to (a) (i) the amount in respect
of the Incremental Financing Fees actually paid by the Purchaser to the
Financing Sources _divided by_ (ii) two (2), _multiplied by_ (b) 0.65. If the
Contemplated Transactions are consummated and any amounts are due pursuant to
this _Section 10.12_, the Seller agrees to make such payment no later than
ten (10) days following receipt of the calculation of such Incremental
Financing Fees and evidence of the Incremental Financing Fees paid, in each
case as reasonably satisfactory to the Seller. Notwithstanding anything to
the contrary, in no event shall the Seller be responsible for reimbursing the
Purchaser for an amount greater than $5,650,000 with respect to each month up
to the Initial Closing Date following the six (6) month anniversary of the
date hereof.

ARTICLE 11

 

MISCELLANEOUS

11.1  _Governing Law; Forum_.

(a) The Laws of the State of Delaware (without reference to its principles of

(b) The parties mutually desire that friendly collaboration will develop
between them. Accordingly, they will try to resolve in a friendly manner all
disagreements and misunderstandings connected with their respective rights and
obligations under this Agreement or any agreement or document delivered
pursuant hereto or the Transaction Agreements, including any amendments hereof
and thereof. Except with respect to matters for which an injunction, specific
performance or other equitable relief is sought pursuant to _Section 11.13_,
in the event that after the date hereof, to the extent that any
misunderstanding, dispute, controversy or claim (a " _Dispute_ ") arising out
of or relating to the transactions contemplated by the Principal Agreements or
the validity, interpretation, breach or termination of any such agreement
cannot be resolved agreeably in a friendly manner either the Purchaser or the
Seller may by written notice to the other party (the " _Initial Notice_ ")
call for the consideration of such dispute by a high level management
employee, which shall be the Senior Vice President, Business Development and
Ventures of the Seller and Senior Vice President, Corporate Development of the
Purchaser, or an equivalent position, as the case may be (a " _High Level

High Level Management Employee may be

77  assisted by other advisors, including accountants, attorneys and employees,
in his or her discussions and negotiations with the other party. The Purchaser
and the Seller agree to negotiate in good faith with one another for an
additional period ending sixty (60) days after the date of the Initial Notice.
Any Dispute which the parties cannot resolve through negotiation within such
sixty (60) day period may then be submitted to the courts for resolution
pursuant to _Section 11.1(c)_. Nothing in this _Section 11.1(b)_ will
prevent either party from resorting to judicial proceedings if (i) Reasonable
Efforts to resolve the Dispute under these procedures have been unsuccessful
or (ii) interim relief from a court is necessary to prevent serious and
irreparable injury to one party or to others. All offers of compromise or
settlement among the parties or their Representatives in connection with the
attempted resolution of any Dispute shall be deemed confidential settlement
communications that have been delivered in furtherance of a Dispute settlement
and shall be exempt from discovery and production and shall not be admissible
in evidence (whether as an admission or otherwise) in any proceeding for the
resolution of the Dispute.

(c) The parties hereto irrevocably submit to the exclusive jurisdiction of
the courts of the State of Delaware and the federal courts of the United
States of America located in the State of Delaware over any Dispute arising
out of or relating to the Transaction Agreements or any agreement or

party hereby irrevocably agrees that all claims in respect of such Dispute
or proceeding will be heard and determined in such courts (and the courts
hearing appeals from such courts). The parties hereby irrevocably waive, to
the fullest extent permitted by applicable Law, any objection which they may
now or hereafter have to the laying of venue of any such Dispute brought in
such court or any defense of inconvenient forum in connection therewith. TO
THE EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW THEN IN EFFECT, EACH PARTY HERETO
WAIVES ITS RIGHT TO TRIAL OF ANY ISSUE BY JURY IN ANY ACTION, PROCEEDING OR
COUNTERCLAIM WHETHER BASED ON CONTRACT, TORT OR OTHERWISE ARISING OUT OF OR
RELATING TO THIS AGREEMENT OR THE ACTION OF ANY OF THE PARTIES THERETO IN THE
NEGOTIATION, ADMINISTRATION, PERFORMANCE AND ENFORCEMENT THEREOF. 

(d) EXCEPT AS EXPRESSLY PROVIDED OTHERWISE IN THIS AGREEMENT, EACH PARTY
HERETO WAIVES ANY CLAIM FOR ATTORNEYS FEES, COSTS OR PREJUDGMENT INTEREST
FROM THE OTHER.

(e) Notwithstanding the foregoing, each of the parties hereto agrees that it
will not bring or support any action, cause of action, claim, cross-claim or
third-party claim of any kind or description, whether in Law or in equity,
whether in contract or in tort or otherwise, against any of the Financing
Source Related Parties in any way relating to this Agreement or any of the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement, including any dispute arising out
of or relating in any way to the Financing or the Debt Commitment Letter or
the performance of any of the foregoing, in any forum other than a court of
competent jurisdiction located within the City of New York, New York, whether
a state or Federal court.



 

MASTER ACQUISITION AGREEMENT

 



78 11.2 _Binding Effect, Assignment and Beneficiaries_.

 

(a) This Agreement binds and benefits the parties and their respective
successors and assignees, except that the Purchaser will not assign any of
its rights under this Agreement prior to the Initial Closing without the prior
written consent of the Seller; _provided_ that, without such consent, the
Purchaser may transfer or assign, in whole or in part from time to time, to
the Financing Sources and any other financing sources for collateral security
purposes, but no such transfer or assignment will relieve the Purchaser of its
obligations hereunder. In addition, no party may delegate any performance of
its obligations under this Agreement, except that the Purchaser may at any
time assign, delegate or transfer in whole or in part the performance of its
obligations (other than the obligation to pay the Purchase Price) to any
Affiliate of the Purchaser so long as the Purchaser (i) remains fully
responsible for the performance of the delegated obligations by executing such
documents or instruments as the Seller may reasonably request and (ii) such
Affiliate executes a written agreement of assumption of such obligations in a
form reasonably acceptable to the Seller.

(b) Notwithstanding the foregoing, following the Initial Closing, the Seller
may assign all or part of its rights under this Agreement and delegate all or
part of its obligations under this Agreement to one or more Persons, the
majority of the capital stock or equity interest of which are owned, directly
or indirectly, by the Seller or any Affiliate thereof so long as the Seller
(i) remains fully responsible for the performance of the delegated obligations
by executing such documents or instruments as the Purchaser may reasonably
request and (ii) such assignee executes a written agreement of assumption of
such obligations in a form reasonably acceptable to the Purchaser; in which
event all the rights and powers of the Seller and the remedies available to it
under this Agreement shall extend to and be enforceable by each such
assignee. In the event of any such assignment and delegation referred to
above, the term " _Seller_ " as used in this Agreement shall be deemed to
refer to each such assignee of the Seller where appropriate, and shall be
deemed to include both the Seller and each such assignee where appropriate.

(c) Subject to  _Section 11.2(a)_, nothing in this Agreement, express or
implied, other than the rights of Indemnified Parties pursuant to _Article 8_
and Affiliate Indemnified Parties pursuant to _Section 10.4_, is intended to
or shall confer upon any other Person any right, benefit or remedy of any
nature whatsoever under or by reason of this Agreement.

(d) Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, nothing in this
Agreement, whether express or implied, shall: (i) confer third-party
beneficiary rights upon any Transferred Employee; (ii) be construed as giving
to any Transferred Employee any legal or equitable right against the Seller
or the Purchaser or their Affiliates; (iii) constitute a contract of
employment or give any Transferred Employee a right to be retained in the
employ of either the Seller or the Purchaser or any of their Affiliates or a
right to any particular terms or conditions of such employment, unless the
Transferred Employee would otherwise have that right under applicable Law;
(iv) be interpreted to prevent or restrict the Purchaser or any of
its Affiliates from modifying or terminating the employment or terms of
employment of any Transferred Employee, including the amendment or termination
of any benefit or compensation plan, program, policy, agreement or
arrangement, after any applicable Closing Date; (v) limit the ability of the
Purchaser or any of its Affiliates (including, following any applicable
Closing Date, the Acquired Companies) to terminate the employment of any
employee (including any

 



MASTER ACQUISITION AGREEMENT

 



79  Transferred Employee) or the engagement of any Contractor (as defined in the
Employee Matters Agreement) at any time and for any or no reason; or (vi) be
treated as an amendment or other modification of any Employee Benefit Plan or
other compensation or benefit plan, program, policy, agreement or arrangement.

(e) Notwithstanding the foregoing, each Financing Source shall be an express
third party beneficiary of and shall be entitled to rely upon and enforce
_Sections 11.1(a)_ , _11.1(c)_ , _11.1(d)_ , _11.1(e)_ , _11.7_ and _11.13_
 and this _Section 11.2(e)_. In addition, the Seller agrees, on behalf of
itself, its Affiliates and their respective directors, officers, managers,
members, stockholders, partners, employees, agents, Representatives,
successors and permitted assigns (collectively, the " _Seller Related
Parties_ ") that the Financing Source Related Parties shall be subject to no
liability or claims (whether legal or equitable, arising under contract, tort
or otherwise) by the Seller or the Seller Related Parties arising out of or
relating to this Agreement, the Financing, the Debt Commitment Letter or the
Contemplated Transactions or in connection with the Financing, or the
performance of services by such Financing Source Related Parties with respect
to the foregoing.

11.3 _Severability_. If any term or provision of this Agreement is
determined to be invalid, illegal or unenforceable, the remaining terms and
provisions of this Agreement remain in full force, if the essential terms and
conditions of this Agreement for each party remain valid, binding and
enforceable. Upon such determination that any term or other provision is
invalid, illegal or unenforceable, the parties hereto will negotiate in good
faith to modify this Agreement so as to effect the original intent of the
parties as closely as possible in an acceptable manner in order that the
transactions contemplated hereby are consummated as originally contemplated to
the greatest extent possible.

11.4  _Entire Agreement; Conflicting Provisions_. This Agreement, together
with the other Transaction Agreements and any side letters executed by the
parties in connection therewith, and all of the exhibits and schedules
appended hereto and thereto, constitute the final, complete and exclusive
statement of the parties agreement on the matters contained herein and
therein. All prior and contemporaneous negotiations and agreements between the
parties on the matters contained in this Agreement and the other Transaction
Agreements are superseded by this Agreement and the other Transaction
Agreements, including, but subject to _Section 5.5(b)_ hereof, the NDA. In
the event of any conflict between any specific provision of this Agreement
(including _Section 10.5_) and the provisions of the IP Agreement with
respect to the subject matter thereof, the provisions of the IP Agreement will
control, and in the event of any conflict between any specific provision of
this Agreement and the provisions of the Employee Matters Agreement with
respect to the subject matter thereof, the provisions of the Employee Matters
Agreement will control.

 

11.5 _Counterparts_. The parties may execute this Agreement in multiple
counterparts, each of which constitutes an original as against the party that
signed it, and all of which together constitute one agreement. This Agreement
is effective upon delivery of one executed counterpart from each party to the
other party. The signatures of all parties need not appear on the
same counterpart. The delivery of signed counterparts by facsimile or email
transmission which includes a copy of the sending partys signature(s) is as
effective as signing and delivering the counterpart in person.

 



MASTER ACQUISITION AGREEMENT

 



80 11.6 _Expenses_. Except to the extent specified otherwise in this Agreement,
each party will pay its own costs, professional fees and other expenses
(including all legal, accounting, broker, lender or investment banking)
incurred by it in connection with the Contemplated Transactions.

 

11.7 _Amendment_. The parties may amend this Agreement only by a written
agreement signed by the parties and that identifies itself as an amendment to
this Agreement.

11.8 _Waiver_. The parties may waive a provision of this Agreement only by a
writing signed by the party against whom enforcement of the waiver is sought.
A party is not prevented from enforcing any right, remedy or condition in the
partys favor because of any failure or delay in exercising any right or
remedy or in requiring satisfaction of any condition, except to the extent
that the party specifically waives the same in writing. A written waiver given
for one matter or occasion is effective only in that instance and only for the
purpose stated. A waiver once given is not to be construed as a waiver for
any other matter or occasion. Any enumeration of a partys rights and remedies
in this Agreement is not intended to be exclusive, and a partys rights and
remedies are intended to be cumulative to the extent permitted by Law and
include any rights and remedies authorized in Law or in equity.

11.9 _Notices_. Each party giving any notice required or permitted under this
Agreement will give the notice in writing, and shall be deemed to have been
duly given: (a) when received if delivered personally; (b) when transmitted if
sent by facsimile (with transmission confirmed); (c) the day after it is sent
if sent by commercial overnight courier; (d) upon receipt if sent by certified
or registered mail (return receipt requested); or (e) when transmitted if sent
by email (with receipt confirmed by recipient). Notice to a party is
effective for purposes of this Agreement only if given as provided in this
_Section 11.9_ at the address of which the sending party has been notified in
accordance with this _Section 11.9_.

11.10 _Construction of Agreement_.

 

(a) Where this Agreement states that a party "shall," "will" or "must" perform
in some manner or otherwise act or omit to act, it means that the party is
legally obligated to do so in accordance with this Agreement.

(b) In the negotiation of this Agreement, each party has received advice from
its own attorney. This Agreement is not to be construed for or against any
party based on which party drafted any of the provisions of this Agreement.

 

(c) The captions, titles, headings, recitals and table of contents included in
this Agreement are for convenience only, and do not affect the construction
or interpretation of this Agreement.

(d) This Agreement does not, and is not intended to, confer any rights or
remedies in favor of any Person other than the parties signing this
Agreement, except as may be specifically set forth in other provisions of this
Agreement.

 

(e) The words "including," "includes," or "include" are to be read as listing
non-exclusive examples of the matters referred to, whether or not words such
as "without limitation" or "but not limited to" are used in each instance.



 

MASTER ACQUISITION AGREEMENT

 



82 (f) The words "hereof, "herein" and "hereunder" and words of similar import
when used in this Agreement will refer to this Agreement as a whole (including
any annexes, exhibits and schedules to this Agreement) and not to any
particular provision of this Agreement, and section and subsection references
are to this Agreement unless otherwise specified.

(g) Any reference in this Agreement to wire transfers or other payments
requires payment in Dollars unless some other currency is expressly stated in
that reference.

(h) Any reference in this Agreement to the singular includes the plural where
appropriate. Any reference in this Agreement to the masculine, feminine or
neuter gender includes the other genders where appropriate.

 

11.11 _No Joint Venture_. Nothing in this Agreement creates a joint venture or
partnership between the parties. This Agreement does not authorize any party
(a) to bind or commit, or to act as an agent, employee or legal representative
of, another party, except as may be specifically set forth in other provisions
of this Agreement, or (b) to have the power to control the activities and
operations of another party. The parties are independent contractors with
respect to each other under this Agreement. Each party agrees not to hold
itself out as having any authority or relationship contrary to this  _Section
11.11_.

11.12 _Disclosure Schedules_. The Seller and the Purchaser each acknowledge
that the other party is relying on the accuracy of the Seller Representations
or the Purchaser Representations, respectively, in entering into this
Agreement and consummating the Contemplated Transactions. Accordingly, nothing
in any particular schedule or section of the Purchaser Disclosure Schedule or
the Seller Disclosure Schedule shall be deemed to be disclosed in any other
schedule or section of the Purchaser Disclosure Schedule or the Seller
Disclosure Schedule, respectively, except to the extent the applicability of
the disclosure to another schedule or section is reasonably apparent on the
face of such disclosure.

11.13 _Remedies Cumulative; Specific Performance_. The provisions of this
_Section 11.13_ are subject to _Section 8.6_ herein. The rights and remedies
of the parties hereto will be cumulative (and not alternative). The parties
agree that irreparable damage for which monetary damages, even if available,
would not be an adequate remedy, would occur in the event that the parties
hereto do not perform the provisions of this Agreement (including failing to
take such actions as are required of it hereunder to consummate the
Contemplated Transactions) in accordance with its specified terms or otherwise
breach such provisions. Therefore, notwithstanding anything in _Section 11.1_
or elsewhere in this Agreement to the contrary, the parties acknowledge and
agree that the parties shall be entitled to an injunction, specific
performance and other equitable relief to prevent breaches of this Agreement
and to enforce specifically the terms and provisions hereof, this being in
addition to any other remedy to which they are entitled at Law or in equity.
Each of the parties agrees that it will not oppose the granting of an
injunction, specific performance and other equitable relief on the basis that
the other party has an adequate remedy at Law or an award of specific
performance is not an appropriate remedy for any reason at Law or equity. Any
party seeking an injunction or injunctions to prevent breaches of this
Agreement and to enforce specifically the terms and provisions of this
Agreement shall not be required to provide any bond or other security in
connection with any such order or injunction. If, prior to the Termination
Date, any party brings

 



MASTER ACQUISITION AGREEMENT

 



83  a Legal Proceeding to enforce the terms and provisions hereof, the
Termination Date may, to the extent determined to be appropriate by the court
of competent jurisdiction presiding over such Legal Proceeding, be extended
by any time period established by such court. Subject to _Section 7.3(b)_,
notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement, neither the Seller
nor any of its Affiliates or Representatives shall be entitled to any
specific performance, injunctive relief, other equitable relief or enforcement
of the terms of this Agreement with respect to the failure of the Purchaser to
complete the Contemplated Transactions in the event of a Financing
Failure, in which case, the provisions of _Section 7.3(b)_ and _Section
7.4_ shall apply, which shall be the sole and exclusive remedies of the
Seller, its Affiliates and Representatives. For the avoidance of doubt,
neither this  _Section 11.13_ nor _Section 7.3(b)_ shall limit the Sellers
ability to seek specific performance of the Purchasers obligations pursuant
to _Section 5.8_ or to seek specific performance of the Purchasers
obligations to consummate the Contemplated Transactions if a Financing Failure
is cured.

11.14 _Contract Under Seal_. The Seller and the Purchaser intend that, to the
fullest extent permitted by Law, this Agreement shall be treated and construed
as a contract under seal under the Laws of the State of Delaware with all the
consequences of such a contract under the Laws of the State of Delaware;
_provided_ , _however_ , that the parties hereto agree that, notwithstanding
the designation of this Agreement as a contract under seal, the applicable
limitations period shall be reduced as follows: (i) for purposes of _Section
8.4(b)_, the statute of limitation (including any extensions or waivers
thereof) applicable to a claim for Taxes, (ii) for purposes of _Section
8.4(c)_, seven years from the anniversary date of the Initial Closing Date,
(iii) for purposes of _Section 8.4(d)_, three years from the anniversary date
of the Initial Closing Date, (iv) for purposes of _Section 8.4(e)_, eighteen
months from the anniversary date of the Initial Closing Date, (v) for
purposes of _Section 8.4(f)_, the shorter of three years or the applicable
