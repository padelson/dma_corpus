consultant, business solicitor, participant in, or otherwise) (w) producing,
distributing, marketing or selling (i) any non gluten-free products within

Party's successor agrees in writing for the express benefit of the Buyer to

the terms of this _Section 5.7_ and that, in addition to all other remedies
available hereunder or otherwise, Buyer shall be entitled to equitable relief,
including temporary and permanent injunctive relief (without any requirement
to post any bond or other security or to demonstrate the insufficiency of
monetary damages), in the event of any such breach or any threatened breach of
the terms of this _Section 5.7_, and that such Restricted Party shall not
oppose Buyer seeking such form of equitable relief based upon the sufficiency
of monetary damages. In the event of any breach of any covenant set forth in

(e) Following the Closing, each Restricted Party shall, and shall
cause its Affiliates and Representatives to, (i) maintain the
confidentiality of, (ii) not use, and (iii) not disclose (other than
disclosure directly to Company) any confidential, non-public or
proprietary information regarding the Covered Business or the Competing
Products that such Restricted Party received from Company or any third party
or developed during such Restricted Party's, direct or indirect, ownership of
Company (or any predecessor of Company) (the " _Confidential Information_ "),
except for financial information as required (and only to the extent
necessary) to file Tax Returns. In the event Seller is requested by a
Governmental Authority or required by applicable Law (or by oral question or
request for information or documents in any Proceeding) to disclose any
Confidential Information, it will notify Buyer and Acquisition Co. promptly
of the request or requirement in writing so that Buyer or Acquisition Co. may
seek an appropriate protective order or other appropriate remedy or (in
Buyer's and Acquisition Co.'s sole discretion) waive compliance with the
provisions of this _Section 5.7(e)_ (and if Buyer or Acquisition Co. seeks
such an order, such Restricted Party will provide such cooperation as Buyer
or Acquisition Co., as applicable, shall reasonably request). If, in the
absence of a protective order or other remedy or the receipt of a waiver
hereunder, a Restricted Party is, on the advice of such Restricted Party's
legal counsel, compelled to disclose any Confidential Information to any
Governmental Authority or else stand liable for fines, damages or contempt,
such Restricted Party may disclose only that portion of the Confidential
Information that such Restricted Party is required by applicable Law to
disclose to such Governmental Authority and will give Buyer and Acquisition
Co. written notice (unless prohibited by Law) of the information to be
disclosed as far in advance as practicable and exercise reasonable efforts to
obtain reliable assurance that confidential treatment will be accorded the
information. The limitations upon disclosure set forth in this _Section
5.7(e)_  do not apply to information that is publicly known as of the
Closing, or becomes publicly known or available after the Closing, in each
case other than by means in violation of this Agreement or any other duty owed
to Buyer, Acquisition Co. or Company by any person.

  



  

(f) All of the covenants in this _Section 5.7_ shall be construed
as agreements independent of any other provision of this Agreement or any
other agreement between or among any of the parties hereto, and the existence
of any claim or cause of action by any party hereto against any other party,
whether predicated on this Agreement or otherwise, shall not constitute a
defense to the enforcement of this _Section 5.7_, and no material or other
breach of any contractual or legal duty by any party hereto shall be held
sufficient to excuse or terminate any party's obligations under this _Section
5.7_ or to preclude Buyer or Acquisition Co. from obtaining injunctive relief
as aforesaid.

  



  

(g) Buyer and Acquisition Co. agree and acknowledge that the
restrictions set forth in _Section 3.6_ of the Amended and Restated
Operating Agreement of Company, effective as of April 9, 2010, shall not be
applicable after the Closing Date.

Source in the preparation of all information memoranda, lender presentations,
rating agency presentations, and similar documents in connection with the
Financing; (v) reasonably assisting Buyer and the Financing Source in the

transaction documents for the Financing (including credit agreements, notes,
guarantees, pledge and security agreements and account control agreements)
and consummating the borrowings thereunder, so long as they only become
effective immediately prior to the Closing; (vii) facilitating the pledge of
and granting and perfection of Liens on applicable collateral (including the
release, identification, grant or perfection of any Liens on the assets of
Company), if any, to provide security in connection with the Financing at
and after the Closing; (viii) using reasonable best efforts to obtain the
assistance of accountants of Company to provide consents for the use of their
reports in materials related to the Financing; (ix) using commercially
reasonable efforts to obtain such consents, approvals and authorizations
which may be reasonably requested by Buyer in connection with the Financing
and collateral arrangements in connection therewith; and (x) cooperating with
Buyer to satisfy the conditions precedent to the Financing to the extent
within the control of Company; _provided_ that neither Company nor any of its
directors, officers, managers or employees, nor any Seller, shall be required
to pay any commitment or other similar fee or to incur any other Liability or
expense whatsoever (other than fees and expenses to be reimbursed by Buyer)
in connection with the Financing prior to the Closing, and _provided, further_
, that no action or inaction by Company or any of its directors, officers,
managers or employees, or by any Seller, under this _Section 5.8_ may form
the basis of any claim by Buyer or Acquisition Co. that the Financing was
delayed or in any other way negatively impacted thereby, any and all of which
claims are hereby waived by Buyer and Acquisition Co, in each case so long as
Sellers shall have sought in good faith to comply, and to cause Company to
comply, with the provisions of this _Section 5.8_.

  



  

5.9. Taxes.

  



  

(a) Buyer shall notify Sellers' Representative of any actions taken
by Company or any Taxing authority which will result in a refund of Taxes
paid by Company for any Tax period ending on or before the Closing Date and

such periods that are received by Company to the extent such refund of Taxes
is not included or reflected in the Closing Date Working Capital Schedule.

  



  

(b) From and after the Closing Date, Sellers may retain copies of
such Tax, finance and legal records of Company as Sellers may deem
reasonably necessary for purposes of preparing Tax Returns.

  



  

(c) In connection with the preparation of any Tax Returns, audit
examinations and any administrative or judicial proceedings relating to Tax
liabilities imposed on Company, or Buyer or Sellers (and relating to Company),
Buyer, on the one hand, and Sellers, on the other hand, will cooperate fully
with each other, including the furnishing or making available during normal
business hours of records, personnel (as reasonably required), books of

(d) Any Tax liability relating to the taxable period that includes
but does not end on the Closing Date shall be apportioned between the period
deemed to end at the close of business on the Closing Date and the period
deemed to begin at the beginning of the day following the Closing Date. Such
apportionment shall be made based on an interim closing of the books or, in
the case of real, personal and intangible property Taxes, based on the number
of days elapsed in the pre-Closing period and post-Closing period,
respectively. Sellers shall be responsible, jointly and severally, for any
such Tax liability apportioned to the pre-Closing period to the extent such
Tax liability is not included or reflected in the Closing Date Working Capital
Schedule, and Buyer shall be responsible for any such Tax liability
apportioned to the post-Closing period. If one party is required to remit to

shall present a statement to the non-paying party setting forth the amount of
reimbursement to which the paying party is entitled under this  _Section
5.9(d)_ , together with such supporting evidence as is reasonably necessary to
calculate the amount to be reimbursed. The non-paying party shall make such
reimbursement promptly, but in no event later than ten (10) days after the
presentation of such statement. In the event any amounts are payable pursuant
to this _Section 5.9(d)_ , at the written request of the party to which such
amounts are payable to Buyer and Sellers' Representative, Buyer and Sellers'
Representative shall, within three (3) business days following receipt of
such request, deliver joint written instructions to Escrow Agent in accordance
with the Escrow Agreement, instructing Escrow Agent to distribute to the
requesting party any amounts payable by the other party pursuant to this
_Section 5.9(d)_ from the Escrow Account and, in the case of Sellers, shall be
obligated, jointly and severally, to thereafter promptly replenish the Escrow
Account by depositing an aggregate amount equal to the distributed amount
into the Escrow Account.

  



  

(e) Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, Sellers shall
be liable, jointly and severally, for, and shall pay when due, any stamp
duties, transfer or similar Taxes (including any tax fines) (" _Transfer

contemplated by this Agreement. Sellers shall prepare and file all necessary

established by the Group Health Plan (taking into consideration appropriate

(" _Pre-Closing Claims_ "). EandA Industries, Inc. shall be entitled to invoice

interest following the due date at a rate of twelve percent (12%) per annum,
calculated on the basis of the actual number of days elapsed over three
hundred sixty (360), until either (a) paid by Sellers' Representative to
Company, or (b) distributed to Company from the Escrow Account and the amount
distributed from the Escrow Account has been replenished. In the event any
amount payable to Company pursuant to this subsection is not received by
Company within the time period provided herein, at the written request of
Buyer, Buyer and Sellers' Representative shall, within three (3) business
days following Sellers' Representative's receipt of such request, deliver
joint written instructions to Escrow Agent in accordance with the Escrow
Agreement, instructing Escrow Agent to distribute such amount to Company from

thereafter promptly replenish the Escrow Account by depositing an aggregate

the Closing Date Working Capital Schedule, Buyer shall cause Company to pay
to Seller's Representative the amount of such deficiency no later than ten
(10) business days after the Deadline Date. In the event such amount is not
received by Sellers' Representative on the tenth (10th) business days after
the Deadline Date, such amount shall bear default interest following the due
date at a rate of twelve percent (12%) per annum, calculated on the basis of
the actual number of days elapsed over three hundred sixty (360), until either

Sellers' Representative from the Escrow Account and the amount distributed
from the Escrow Account has been replenished by Buyer. In the event the full
amount, if any, determined to be owed to Sellers' Representative pursuant to

period provided herein, at the written request of Sellers' Representative,

following Buyer's receipt of such request, deliver joint written instructions
to Escrow Agent in accordance with the Escrow Agreement, instructing Escrow
Agent to distribute such deficit amount to Sellers' Representative from the
Escrow Account. Buyer shall be obligated, jointly and severally, to

6.3. Defense of Claims.

  



  

As promptly as practicable after its discovery of grounds for a claim for
indemnification hereunder, the applicable Buyer Indemnified Party or Seller
Indemnified Party (for the purposes of this _Section 6.3_ , each, an "
_Indemnified Party_ ") shall deliver a written claim for indemnification to
Sellers' Representative or Buyer, as applicable (an " _Indemnifying Party_ "),
specifying in reasonable detail the basis therefor and, if known, the amount,
or an estimate of the amount, of the Losses arising therefrom. Thereafter,
the Indemnified Party shall promptly provide to the Indemnifying Party all
information and documentation reasonably available to it to support and
verify such claim; _provided_ , _however_ , if such claim involves or
otherwise requires the disclosure of trade secrets or other confidentially
proprietary information of the Indemnified Party to a third party,
the Indemnifying Party will seek and obtain, at its own expense, a protective
order which is reasonably acceptable to the Indemnified Party with respect to
such trade secrets or other confidential proprietary information. The failure
of any Indemnified Party to comply with the prior two sentences shall not
relieve the applicable Indemnifying Party from any liability under this
ARTICLE 6 with respect to such matter, except to the extent the Indemnifying
Party is actually prejudiced by such failure to comply. If the facts giving
rise to a claim for indemnification hereunder arise out of the claim of any
third party, the Indemnifying Party may, at its option, assume the defense
thereof, with counsel reasonably satisfactory to the Indemnified Party, at its
sole cost and expense, so long as (i) the Indemnifying Party gives written
notice to the Indemnified Party within fifteen (15) days after
the Indemnified Party has provided the Indemnifying Party with notice of such
third party claim that the Indemnifying Party will indemnify the Indemnified
Party from and against the entirety of any and all Losses the Indemnified
Party may suffer from, arising out of the third party claim, (ii) such claim
involves only money damages and does not seek an order, injunction or other
equitable relief against any Indemnified Party, (iii) the Indemnified Party
shall have reasonably concluded that there is not a conflict of
interest between the Indemnified Party and the Indemnifying Party in the
defense of such claim, (iv) the Indemnifying Party conducts defense of the
third party claim in a reasonably active and diligent manner, (v) if such
claim is asserted directly or indirectly by or on behalf a person that is a
current or prospective customer of Company or Buyer of any of its Affiliates,
the Indemnified Party, in its reasonable judgment, has not determined that
the Indemnifying Party's defense thereof could reasonably be expected to have
a material and adverse effect on the Indemnified Party's (or Buyer's or any of
its Affiliates' or Company's) existing or prospective relationship with such
current or prospective customer, (vi) if such claim is subject to the
limitations set forth in _Section 6.1(e)_ , such claim asserts an amount of
Losses which, when taken together with all amounts paid for resolved
indemnification claims that are subject to the limitations set forth in
_Section 6.1(e)_ with all amounts the maximum aggregate amount of Losses
alleged in all other unresolved indemnification claims that are subject to the
limitations set forth in _Section 6.1(e)_ , does not exceed the Cap, (vii)
the Indemnified Party has not reasonably concluded that there may be one or
more legal defenses available to such Indemnified Party or other Indemnified
Parties that are not available to the Indemnifying Party and (viii) such
claim does not involve matters arising under Environmental Law and relating to
any Facilities; _provided_ , notwithstanding the Indemnifying Party's
assumption of the defense of a claim pursuant to the foregoing, the
Indemnified Party shall have the right to participate in the defense of any
claim with counsel selected by the Indemnified Party subject to the
Indemnifying Party's right to direct the defense (the fees and disbursements
of such counsel in such circumstances shall be at the expense of the
Indemnified Party). After any assumption of the defense of any claim by the
Indemnifying Party and only for so long as the conditions set forth in
subclauses (i) through (viii) of the immediately prior sentence with respect
to such claim remain satisfied, it shall not be liable to any Indemnified
Party for any legal expenses incurred by any Indemnified Party in connection
with the defense or prosecution thereof other than reasonable costs of
investigation and any costs incurred in the course of such defense. The
Indemnified Party and the Indemnifying Party shall each fully cooperate as
reasonably requested by the other in the defense thereof and shall furnish
such records and information and attend such proceedings as may be
reasonably requested in connection herewith. The Indemnifying Party shall not
settle any indemnifiable claim or demand without the prior written consent of
the Indemnified Party, unless the settlement (i) will be fully satisfied by
payment of money by the Indemnifying Party, (ii) does not involve Taxes that
would affect Buyer in a post-Closing period, (iii) results in the full and
general release of the Indemnified Parties from all liabilities relating to
the claim, (iv) involves no finding or admission of any violation of Law or
the rights of any person on the part of any Indemnified Party, (v) does not
require the modification by the Indemnified Party of any business practice,
and (vi) contains as an unconditional term thereof the delivery by the
claimant or plaintiff, if applicable, to the Indemnifying Party of a written
release of the Indemnified Party from all liabilities relating to the
applicable claim.

incurred by a Buyer Indemnified Party and any of the Sellers or any
Restricted Party hereunder are required to indemnify a Buyer Indemnified
Party for such Losses, at the written request of Buyer to
Sellers' Representative, Buyer and Sellers' Representative shall, within (3)
business days following Sellers' Representative receipt of such request,
deliver joint written instructions to Escrow Agent in accordance with the
Escrow Agreement, instructing Escrow Agent to pay such Buyer Indemnified
Party for such Losses from the Escrow Account.

  



  

6.5. Exclusive Remedy.

incurred by any of them after the Closing Date as a result of any breach by
Sellers or any Restricted Party of any of their respective
representations, warranties covenants and agreements set forth in this
Agreement or otherwise in connection with the transactions contemplated
hereby;  _provided_ , _however_ , that (a) the foregoing limitation shall not
apply to any Losses that may be incurred by virtue of or result from fraud on
the part of any Seller or any other Restricted Party and (b) this _Section
6.5_ shall not preclude or limit Buyer from exercising all available
equitable remedies in the event of any breach by Sellers or any Restricted
Party of any of their respective covenants to be performed hereunder.

  



  

6.6. Tax Treatment of Indemnity Payments.

  



  

Sellers and Buyer agree to treat any indemnity payments made pursuant to this
ARTICLE 6 as an adjustment to Purchase Price for Tax purposes.

  



  

6.7. Waiver of Claims.

  



  

Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, Company (on behalf of itself
and each of its stockholders, partners, members, Affiliates, directors,
officers, employees, agents and Representatives) hereby waives any rights or

Financing or the Financing Commitment, whether at Law or equity, in contract,

stockholders, partners, members, Affiliates, directors, offices, employees,
agents and Representatives) agrees not to commence (and if commenced agrees
to dismiss or otherwise terminate) any Proceeding against the Financing
Source in connection with this Agreement or the transactions contemplated
hereby (including any Proceeding relating to the Financing or the Financing
Commitment). In furtherance and not in limitation of the foregoing waiver, it
is agreed that the Financing Source shall not have any liability for any
claims, losses, settlements, liabilities, damages, costs, expenses, fines or
penalties to Company (or any of its stockholders, partners, members,
Affiliates, directors, officers, employees, agents and Representatives) in
connection with this Agreement or the transactions contemplated hereby.
Nothing in this _Section 6.7_ shall in any way (i) expand the circumstances
in which Buyer may be liable under this Agreement or as a result of the
transactions contemplated hereby (including as a result of the Financing) or
(ii) limit or qualify the obligations and liabilities of the parties to
the Financing Commitment to each other thereunder or in connection therewith.

Notwithstanding anything contained in this Agreement to the contrary, no
party hereto shall be directly liable to any other party hereto for punitive
damages arising out of this Agreement, _provided_ , _however_ , the foregoing
shall not be construed to preclude or limit in any way the recovery by a
Buyer Indemnified Party or Seller Indemnified Party in respect of, or the
liability or obligation of any indemnifying party in respect of, any third
party claims pursuant to ARTICLE 6.

inaction constitutes a breach of this Agreement (which, for purposes of
clarity, would be the case in the event of a failure by Buyer to obtain the
Financing on or before the anticipated Closing (subject to Buyer's right to
delay the Closing pursuant to _Section 1.3_ ); for purposes hereof, " _End
Date_ " shall initially mean July 30, 2012; _provided_ , that if as of three
(3) business days prior to any End Date (as it may be extended in accordance
herewith) any of the conditions set forth in _Sections 7.1(c)_ ( _Consents and
Approvals_ ), _7.1(d)_  ( _No Order_ ), _7.1(f)_ ( _HSR Act_ ), _7.2(c)_ (
_No Order_ ) or _7.2(e)_ ( _HSR Act_ ) shall not have been satisfied, then
the End Date may be extended one or more times by Sellers' Representative or
Buyer (by delivery of a written notice to the other prior to the termination
of this Agreement); but _provided,_ _further_ that, in no event may the End
Date be extended beyond November 30, 2012;

breach (i) has rendered impossible the satisfaction of any of the conditions
set forth in _Section 7.1_ hereof; and (ii) has not been remedied within ten
(10) days after Buyer delivers written notice of such breach to Sellers'
Representative (any such written notice to refer specifically to this _Section
8.1(c)_  and to describe such breach in reasonable detail);

  



  

(d) by Sellers' Representative, at any time prior to Closing, if
there shall have been any material breach by Buyer or Acquisition Co. of any
of their respective representations, warranties, covenants and agreements set
forth herein, which breach (i) has rendered impossible the satisfaction of
any of the conditions set forth in _Section 7.2_ hereof and (ii) has not been
remedied within ten (10) days after Sellers' Representative delivers written
notice of such breach to Buyer and Acquisition Co. (any such written notice

otherwise prohibits consummation of the purchase and sale of the Units
contemplated by this Agreement.

8.2. Procedure and Effect of Termination.

  



  

In the event of termination of this Agreement pursuant to this ARTICLE 8, the
terminating party shall forthwith give written notice thereof to the other
party and this Agreement shall terminate, and the transactions contemplated
hereby shall be abandoned, without further action by any of the parties
hereto. If this Agreement is terminated as provided herein, no party hereto
shall have any liability or further obligation hereunder to any other party,
except as provided in _Section 9.2_ and except that nothing herein will
relieve any party from liability for any breach of this Agreement which
occurred prior to or in connection with such termination.

  



  

ARTICLE 9

  



  

Miscellaneous and General

  



  

9.1. Knowledge of Sellers.

  



  

Unless specifically stated otherwise herein, for the purposes of this
Agreement, the terms "Know", "Known", "Knowledge" and all similar phrases
mean, with reference to Sellers, the knowledge of each individual Seller and
the knowledge of Devin Anderson, Jason Kashman, Rich Clark, Denise Sirovatka
and any other Key Employee, in each case, after reasonable inquiry.

  



  

9.2. Payment of Expenses.

9.3. Survival.

  



  

Notwithstanding any investigation made by or on behalf of any of the parties
hereto, or the participation of such party in the Closing, the
representations, warranties, covenants and agreements made by any party and
contained in or made pursuant to this Agreement, including the Schedules and
Exhibits, or in any certificate furnished in connection with the transactions
contemplated hereby, shall survive the Closing. The representations and
warranties of ARTICLE 2 and ARTICLE 3, and any indemnification obligations
related to such representations and warranties, shall expire on the date
which is eighteen (18) months after the Closing Date, other than the
representations and warranties the inaccuracy or breach of which would result
in a Special Claim (as such term is defined in ARTICLE 6),
which representations and warranties and any indemnification obligations
related to such representation and warranty shall survive until ninety (90)
days after the expiration of the statute of limitation applicable to claims
for inaccuracies or breaches of such representations or warranties;
_provided_ that in the case of the representations and warranties set forth in
_Section 2.1_ and _Section 3.3_ , the parties agree the statute of limitation
applicable thereto will not begin to run until such time as Buyer knew
of such inaccuracy or breach. The covenants set forth in _Section 5.7_ shall
survive for the period set forth in that Section. The date when any
representation, warranty, covenant or agreement expires in accordance with
this Section and this Agreement is referred to herein as the " _Expiration
Date_." Notwithstanding the foregoing, if written notice is properly
given pursuant to ARTICLE 6 and this ARTICLE 9 with respect to any alleged
breach of a representation, warranty, covenant or agreement or other matter
to which any Buyer Indemnified Party is entitled to be indemnified hereunder
prior to the applicable Expiration Date, then such representation, warranty,
covenant or agreement shall survive, with respect to the subject matter of
such written notice only, until the applicable claim is finally resolved in
accordance with the provisions of this Agreement.

  



  

9.4. Modification or Amendment.

  



  

The parties hereto may modify or amend this Agreement at any time, only by a
written instrument duly executed and delivered by Buyer and
Sellers' Representative; _provided_ that no amendment that adversely affects
the obligations of Hubbard or Anderson under _Sections 5.3_ ( _Exclusivity_
), _5.7_ ( _Covenant Not to Compete_ ), _5.13_ ( _Release_ ), _5.18_ (
_Transfer of Units_ ) and _6.1(b)_ ( _Indemnification by Sellers and the
Restricted Parties_ ) and ARTICLE 9 shall be made without the written consent
of Hubbard and Anderson.

9.6. Entire Agreement; Assignment; Etc.

  



  

This Agreement (including the Exhibits and Schedules hereto) and the
Confidentiality Agreement constitute the entire agreement, and supersede all
other agreements, understandings, representations and warranties, both
written and oral, among the parties with respect to the subject matter
hereof, and shall not be assignable by operation of Law or otherwise and is
not intended to create any obligations to, or rights in respect of, any
persons other than the parties hereto (and the Indemnified Parties referred to
in ARTICLE 6 hereof) and their respective successors and permitted assigns.
Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the contrary, Buyer may (a)
assign any or all of its rights and interests hereunder to one or more of its
Affiliates, (b) designate one or more of its Affiliates to perform
its obligations hereunder (in any or all of which cases, Buyer nonetheless
shall remain responsible for the performance of all of its obligations
hereunder) and (c) assign this Agreement to any subsidiary of Buyer or to the
Financing Source (including any agent or other Representative thereof) or any
Subsidiary (including, on and after the Closing, Company) or Affiliate thereof
as collateral security for obligations to the Financing Source in respect of
the financing arrangements entered into in connection with the
transactions contemplated hereby (including, without limitation, the
Financing) and any refinancings, extensions, refundings or renewals thereof; 
_provided_ that no assignment to any such Affiliate, Subsidiary or the
Financing Source (including any agent or other Representative thereof) will
in any way affect Buyer's obligations or liabilities under this Agreement.

9.7. Severability.

  



  

If any term or other provision of this Agreement, or any portion thereof, is
invalid, illegal or incapable of being enforced by any rule of Law or
public policy, all other terms and provisions of this Agreement, or remaining
portion thereof, shall nevertheless remain in full force and effect so long
as the economic or legal substance of the transactions contemplated hereby is
not affected in any manner materially adverse to any party. Moreover, if any
term or other provision of this Agreement shall be invalid, illegal or
incapable of being enforced by any rule of Law or public policy because it is
excessively broad as to duration, scope, activity or subject, the
parties intend that such provision shall be deemed modified to the minimum
degree necessary to make such provision valid and enforceable under
applicable Law and that such modified provision shall thereafter be enforced
to the fullest extent permitted under applicable Law. In addition, upon a
determination that any such term or other provision, or any portion thereof,
is invalid, illegal or incapable of being enforced, the parties hereto shall
negotiate in good faith to modify this Agreement so as to effect the original
intent of the parties as closely as possible in an acceptable manner to the
end that the transactions contemplated hereby are consummated to the fullest
extent possible.

  



  

9.8. Failure or Delay Not Waiver; Remedies Cumulative.

  



  

No failure or delay on the part of any party hereto in the exercise of any
right hereunder shall impair such right or be construed to be a waiver of, or
acquiescence in, any breach of any representation, warranty, covenant or
agreement herein, nor shall any single or partial exercise of any such right
preclude other or further exercise thereof or of any other right. All rights
and remedies existing under this Agreement are cumulative to, and not
exclusive of, any rights or remedies otherwise available.

or in tort or otherwise, against the Financing Source in any way relating to

exclusive jurisdiction of (i) the Chancery Court of the State of Delaware; and
(ii) the United States District Court for the District of Delaware for the

contract or in tort or otherwise, against the Financing Source relating to
this Agreement or any other related transactions, including any dispute
arising out of or relating in any way to the Financing Commitment or
the performance thereof (any such Proceeding, a " _Financing Proceeding_ "),
each party irrevocably submits to the exclusive jurisdiction of (i) the
supreme court of the state of New York, New York County and (ii) the United
States District Court for the Southern District of New York) and agrees that
all claims in respect of the Proceeding may be heard and determined in any
such court. Each party agrees to commence any such Proceeding either in the
United States District Court for the District of Delaware (or, in the case of
any Financing Proceeding, in the United States District Court for the Southern
District of New York) or if such Proceeding may not be brought in such court
for jurisdictional reasons, in the Chancery Court of the State of Delaware
(or, in the case of any Financing Proceeding, in the supreme court of the
state of New York, New York County). Each party waives any defense of
improper venue or inconvenient forum to the maintenance of any Proceeding so

of any other party with respect thereto. Any party may make service on any
other party by sending or delivering a copy of the process to the party to be
served at the address and in the manner provided for the giving of notices in
_Section 9.5_. Nothing in this _Section 9.13_ , however, shall affect the
right of any party to serve legal process in any other manner permitted by
law or at equity. Each party agrees that a final judgment in any Proceeding so
brought shall be conclusive and may be enforced by suit on the judgment or in
any other manner provided by law or at equity. Each party hereto agrees that
it will not bring or support any Financing Proceeding in any forum other than
the supreme court of the state of New York, New York County, or, if under
applicable law exclusive jurisdiction is vested in the federal courts, the
United States District Court for the Southern District of New York (and
appellate courts thereof).
