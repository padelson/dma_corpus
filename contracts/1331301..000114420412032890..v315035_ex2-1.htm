after its discovery of grounds for a claim for indemnification hereunder, the applicable Buyer Indemnified Party or Seller Indemnified
Party (for the purposes of this <U>Section 6.3</U>, each, an &ldquo;<U>Indemnified Party</U>&rdquo;) shall deliver a written claim
for indemnification to Sellers&rsquo; Representative or Buyer, as applicable (an &ldquo;<U>Indemnifying Party</U>&rdquo;), specifying
in reasonable detail the basis therefor and, if known, the amount, or an estimate of the amount, of the Losses arising therefrom.
Thereafter, the Indemnified Party shall promptly provide to the Indemnifying Party all information and documentation reasonably
available to it to support and verify such claim; <U>provided</U>, <U>however</U>, if such claim involves or otherwise requires
the disclosure of trade secrets or other confidentially proprietary information of the Indemnified Party to a third party, the
Indemnifying Party will seek and obtain, at its own expense, a protective order which is reasonably acceptable to the Indemnified
Party with respect to such trade secrets or other confidential proprietary information. The failure of any Indemnified Party to
comply with the prior two sentences shall not relieve the applicable Indemnifying Party from any liability under this ARTICLE 6
with respect to such matter, except to the extent the Indemnifying Party is actually prejudiced by such failure to comply. If the
facts giving rise to a claim for indemnification hereunder arise out of the claim of any third party, the Indemnifying Party may,
at its option, assume the defense thereof, with counsel reasonably satisfactory to the Indemnified Party, at its sole cost and
expense, so long as (i) the Indemnifying Party gives written notice to the Indemnified Party within fifteen (15) days after the
Indemnified Party has provided the Indemnifying Party with notice of such third party claim that the Indemnifying Party will indemnify
the Indemnified Party from and against the entirety of any and all Losses the Indemnified Party may suffer from, arising out of
the third party claim, (ii) such claim involves only money damages and does not seek an order, injunction or other equitable relief
against any Indemnified Party, (iii) the Indemnified Party shall have reasonably concluded that there is not a conflict of interest
between the Indemnified Party and the Indemnifying Party in the defense of such claim, (iv) the Indemnifying Party conducts defense
of the third party claim in a reasonably active and diligent manner, (v) if such claim is asserted directly or indirectly by or
on behalf a person that is a current or prospective customer of Company or Buyer of any of its Affiliates, the Indemnified Party,
in its reasonable judgment, has not determined that the Indemnifying Party&rsquo;s defense thereof could reasonably be expected
to have a material and adverse effect on the Indemnified Party&rsquo;s (or Buyer&rsquo;s or any of its Affiliates&rsquo; or Company&rsquo;s)
existing or prospective relationship with such current or prospective customer, (vi) if such claim is subject to the limitations
set forth in <U>Section 6.1(e)</U>, such claim asserts an amount of Losses which, when taken together with all amounts paid for
resolved indemnification claims that are subject to the limitations set forth in <U>Section 6.1(e)</U> with all amounts the maximum
aggregate amount of Losses alleged in all other unresolved indemnification claims that are subject to the limitations set forth
in <U>Section 6.1(e)</U>, does not exceed the Cap, (vii) the Indemnified Party has not reasonably concluded that there may be one
or more legal defenses available to such Indemnified Party or other Indemnified Parties that are not available to the Indemnifying
Party and (viii) such claim does not involve matters arising under Environmental Law and relating to any Facilities; <U>provided</U>,
notwithstanding the Indemnifying Party&rsquo;s assumption of the defense of a claim pursuant to the foregoing, the Indemnified
Party shall have the right to participate in the defense of any claim with counsel selected by the Indemnified Party subject to
the Indemnifying Party&rsquo;s right to direct the defense (the fees and disbursements of such counsel in such circumstances shall
be at the expense of the Indemnified Party). After any assumption of the defense of any claim by the Indemnifying Party and only
for so long as the conditions set forth in subclauses (i) through (viii) of the immediately prior sentence with respect to such
claim remain satisfied, it shall not be liable to any Indemnified Party for any legal expenses incurred by any Indemnified Party
in connection with the defense or prosecution thereof other than reasonable costs of investigation and any costs incurred in the
course of such defense. The Indemnified Party and the Indemnifying Party shall each fully cooperate as reasonably requested by
the other in the defense thereof and shall furnish such records and information and attend such proceedings as may be reasonably
requested in connection herewith. The Indemnifying Party shall not settle any indemnifiable claim or demand without the prior written
consent of the Indemnified Party, unless the settlement (i) will be fully satisfied by payment of money by the Indemnifying Party,
(ii) does not involve Taxes that would affect Buyer in a post-Closing period, (iii) results in the full and general release of
the Indemnified Parties from all liabilities relating to the claim, (iv) involves no finding or admission of any violation of Law
or the rights of any person on the part of any Indemnified Party, (v) does not require the modification by the Indemnified Party
of any business practice, and (vi) contains as an unconditional term thereof the delivery by the claimant or plaintiff, if applicable,
to the Indemnifying Party of a written release of the Indemnified Party from all liabilities relating to the applicable claim.</P>

such Proceeding may not be brought in such court for jurisdictional reasons, in the Chancery Court of the State of Delaware (or,
in the case of any Financing Proceeding, in the supreme court of the state of New York, New York County). Each party waives any
defense of improper venue or inconvenient forum to the maintenance of any Proceeding so brought and waives any bond, surety, or
other security that might be required of any other party with respect thereto. Any party may make service on any other party by
sending or delivering a copy of the process to the party to be served at the address and in the manner provided for the giving
of notices in <U>Section 9.5</U>. Nothing in this <U>Section 9.13</U>, however, shall affect the right of any party to serve legal
process in any other manner permitted by law or at equity. Each party agrees that a final judgment in any Proceeding so brought
shall be conclusive and may be enforced by suit on the judgment or in any other manner provided by law or at equity. Each party
hereto agrees that it will not bring or support any Financing Proceeding in any forum other than the supreme court of the state
of New York, New York County, or, if under applicable law exclusive jurisdiction is vested in the federal courts, the United States
District Court for the Southern District of New York (and appellate courts thereof).</P>
