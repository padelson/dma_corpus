AGREEMENT AND PLAN OF REORGANIZATION (the "Agreement") entered into as of
the 4th day of May, 2007, by and between GREATER BAY BANCORP ("Company"), a
California corporation, and WELLS FARGO and COMPANY ("Wells Fargo"), a Delaware
corporation.

WHEREAS, the parties hereto desire to effect a reorganization whereby a
direct, wholly-owned subsidiary of Wells Fargo incorporated under the laws of
the State of California ("Merger Co.") will merge with and into Company
(the "Merger") pursuant to an agreement and plan of merger (the "Merger
Agreement") in substantially the form attached hereto as Exhibit A, which
provides, among other things, for the conversion of the shares of Common Stock
of Company, of no par value per share ("Company Common Stock"), issued and
outstanding immediately prior to the time the Merger becomes effective in
accordance with the provisions of the Merger Agreement into the right to
receive shares of voting Common Stock of Wells Fargo of the par value of $1
2/3 per share ("Wells Fargo Common Stock"); and

WHEREAS, as a further condition and an inducement to Wells Fargos willingness
to enter into this Agreement, Company is granting to Wells Fargo an option to
acquire shares of Company Common Stock pursuant to a stock option agreement in
the form attached hereto as Exhibit B (the "Greater Bay Option Agreement").

WHEREAS, subject to the terms and conditions contained in this Agreement, the
parties to this Agreement intend to effect the merger of Merger Co. with and
into the Company, with the Company being the corporation surviving such Merger
and it is the intention of the parties to this Agreement that the business
combination contemplated hereby qualify as a "reorganization" within the
meaning of Section 368(a) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended
(the "Code"); and

WHEREAS, the respective boards of directors of each of Wells Fargo and the
Company deem it is in the best interests of their respective companies and
their shareholders to consummate the transactions provided for in this
Agreement.

NOW, THEREFORE, to effect such reorganization and in consideration of the
premises and the mutual covenants and agreements contained herein, the
parties hereto do hereby represent, warrant, covenant, and agree as follows: 1\. Basic Plan of Reorganization

(a) _Merger_. Subject to the terms and conditions contained herein, Merger Co.
will be merged by statutory merger with and into Company pursuant to the
Merger Agreement, with Company as the surviving corporation, in which Merger
each share of Company Common Stock, including any restricted shares
outstanding under any Company Stock Option Plan (as defined below) issued and
outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time of the Merger (as defined
in paragraph 1(f) below) (other than shares as to which statutory dissenters
appraisal rights have been exercised and other than shares of Company Common
Stock owned, directly or indirectly, by Wells Fargo or the Company (other
than shares of Company Common Stock held, directly or indirectly, in trust
accounts, managed accounts and the like, or otherwise held in a fiduciary
capacity, that are beneficially owned by third parties ("Trust Account
Shares"), and any shares of Company Common Stock held by the Company or Wells
Fargo or any of their respective subsidiaries in respect of a debt previously
contracted ("DPC Shares")) will be converted into the right to receive, and
exchanged for certificates or direct registration statements representing the
number of shares of Wells Fargo Common Stock equal to (i) if the Wells Fargo
Measurement Price is equal to or less than $32.175, then 0.8858 shares of
Wells Fargo Common Stock for each share of Company Common Stock, (ii) if the
Wells Fargo Measurement Price is greater than $32.175 but less than $39.325,
the quotient determined by dividing $28.50 by the Wells Fargo Measurement
Price (such quotient to be rounded to the nearest ten-thousandth), and (iii)
if the Wells Fargo Measurement Price is greater than or equal to $39.325, then
0.7247 shares of Wells Fargo Common Stock for each share of Company Common
Stock (in each case subject to adjustment pursuant to paragraphs 1(c) or
9(a)) (the "Merger Exchange Ratio"). The "Wells Fargo Measurement Price" is
defined as the daily volume weighted average price of a share of Wells Fargo
Common Stock on the New York Stock Exchange ("NYSE") only as reported by
Bloomberg LP for each of the ten (10) consecutive trading days ending on the
trading day immediately prior to the meeting of shareholders required by
paragraph 4(c) (i) of this Agreement (the "Condition Date"), rounded to the
nearest ten-thousandth.

(b) _Conversion of Company Options_. At the Effective Time of the Merger,
each right or option to acquire or purchase shares of Company Common Stock,
including options phantom stock appreciation rights, and similar equity
equivalents ("Rights") under any stock incentive plan, other than pursuant to
the Greater Bay Option Agreement (collectively the "Company Stock Option
Plans") which is outstanding and unexercised immediately prior to the
Effective Date of the Merger (each, a "Company Stock Option" or "Right"),
shall cease to represent a Stock Option or Right to acquire shares of the
Company Common Stock, such Stock Options, Rights, and Company Stock Option
Plans shall be assumed by Wells Fargo and such Company Stock Options and
Rights shall be converted automatically into a Right to purchase shares of
Wells Fargo Common Stock on the same terms and conditions as set forth in the
Company Stock Option Plans (each, a "Substitute Option"), but in an amount and
at an exercise price determined as provided below (and otherwise subject to
the terms of the Company Stock Option Plans immediately prior to the Effective
Time).



 

-2- (i) The number of shares of Wells Fargo Common Stock to be subject to the
Substitute Option shall be the product (rounded down to the nearest share) of
(A) the number of shares of Company Common Stock subject to the Company Stock
Option or Right by (B) the Merger Exchange Ratio; and

(ii) The exercise price per share of Wells Fargo Common Stock under the
Substitute Option, if applicable, shall be equal to the result (rounded down
to the nearest cent) of dividing (A) the exercise price per share of Company
Common Stock subject to the Company Stock Option by (B) the Merger Exchange
Ratio.

The adjustment provided herein with respect to any options that are "incentive
stock options" (as defined in Section 422 of the Code) shall be and is
intended to be effected in a manner which is consistent with Section 424(a)
of the Code.

(c) _Wells Fargo Common Stock Adjustments_. If, between the date hereof and
the Effective Time of the Merger as defined below, shares of Wells Fargo
Common Stock shall be changed into a different number of shares or a different
class of shares by reason of any reclassification, recapitalization, split-up,
combination, exchange of shares or readjustment, or if a stock dividend
thereon shall be declared with a record date within such period (a "Common
Stock Adjustment"), then the number of shares of Wells Fargo Common Stock
issuable pursuant to subparagraph (a), above, will be appropriately and
proportionately adjusted so that the number of such shares of Wells Fargo
Common Stock issuable in the Merger will equal the number of shares of Wells
Fargo Common Stock which holders of shares of Company Common Stock would have
received pursuant to such Common Stock Adjustment had the record date therefor
been immediately following the Effective Time of the Merger.

(d) _Fractional Shares_. No fractional shares of Wells Fargo Common Stock and
no certificates or scrip certificates therefor shall be issued to represent
any such fractional interest, and any holder thereof shall be paid an amount
of cash equal to the product obtained by multiplying the fractional share
interest to which such holder is entitled by the Wells Fargo Measurement
Price.

(e) _Treasury Shares_. At the Effective Time, all shares of Company Common
Stock owned, directly or indirectly, by the Company or by Wells Fargo, other
than Trust Account Shares or DPC Shares, shall be canceled and shall cease to
exist, and no capital stock of Wells Fargo or other consideration shall be
delivered in exchange therefor.

(f) _Mechanics of Closing Merger_. Subject to the terms and conditions set
forth herein, the Merger Agreement shall be executed and
officers certificates prescribed by Section 1103 of the California General
Corporation Law ("CGCL") shall be filed with the Secretary of State of the
State of California within two (2) business days following the first business
day occurring after the satisfaction or waiver of all conditions precedent
set forth in paragraphs 6 and 7 of this Agreement and after expiration of the
period for determining which shares of Company Common Stock, if any, are
eligible to be  



 

-3-  "Perfected Dissenting Shares" as provided in paragraph 1302 of the CGCL or
on such other date as may be agreed to by the parties (the "Closing Date"),
_provided_ that the Closing Date shall not occur on the last business day of a
calendar month. Subject to the terms and conditions of this Agreement, each of
the parties agrees to use its best efforts to cause the Merger to
be completed as soon as practicable after the receipt of all final regulatory
approvals of the Merger and the expiration of all required statutory waiting
periods. The time that the filing referred to in the first sentence of this
paragraph is made is herein referred to as the "Time of Filing." The day on
which such filing is made and accepted is herein referred to as the "Effective
Date of the Merger." The "Effective Time of the Merger" shall be 11:59
p.m., Central time, on the Effective Date of the Merger. At the Effective
Time of the Merger on the Effective Date of the Merger, the separate existence
of Merger Co. shall cease and Merger Co. will be merged with and into Company
pursuant to the Merger Agreement. "Perfected Dissenting Shares" shall mean
shares of Company Common Stock that are "dissenting shares" within the meaning
of Section 1300(b) of the CGCL and for which all requisite actions to be
treated as dissenting shares pursuant to Section 1300 of the CGCL have been
taken by the holder thereof.

The closing of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement and the Merger
Agreement (the "Closing") shall take place on the Closing Date at the offices
of Wells Fargos Law Department in San Francisco, California.

(g) _Reservation of Right to Revise Structure_. At Wells Fargos election, the
Merger may alternatively be structured so that (i) Company is merged with and
into any other direct or indirect wholly owned subsidiary of Wells Fargo, (ii)
any direct or indirect wholly owned subsidiary of Wells Fargo is merged with
and into Company, or (iii) Company is merged with and into Wells Fargo;
_provided, however_ , that no such change shall (A) alter or change the amount
or kind of consideration to be issued to Companys shareholders in the Merger
or under such alternative structure (the "Merger Consideration"), (B)
adversely affect the tax treatment of Companys shareholders as a result of
receiving the Merger Consideration or prevent the parties from obtaining the
opinion referred to in paragraph 6(h), or (C) materially impede or delay
consummation of the Merger. In the event of such election, the parties agree
to execute an appropriate amendment to this Agreement in order to reflect such
election.

(h) _Dissenting Shares_. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in
this Agreement, any holder of shares of Company Common Stock who shall be
entitled to be paid the "fair market value" of such holders Perfected
Dissenting Shares, as provided in Section 1300 of the CGCL, shall only be
entitled to receive such payment provided for in Section 1300 of the CGCL
unless and until such holder shall have failed to perfect or withdraw or lost
such holders rights under Section 1300 of the CGCL.

2\. Representations and Warranties of Company. Except as set forth in a
confidential disclosure schedule delivered by the Company to Wells Fargo in
conjunction with the execution of this Agreement, which identifies exceptions
by specific paragraph references ( _provided_ that any information set forth
in any one section of the Company  



 

-4-  disclosure schedule shall be deemed to apply to each other applicable
paragraph or subsection thereof if its relevance to the information called for
in such paragraph or subsection is reasonably apparent), Company represents
and warrants to Wells Fargo as follows:

(a) _Organization and Authority_. Company is a corporation duly incorporated,
validly existing and in good standing under the laws of the State of
California and is duly qualified to do business and is in good standing in all
jurisdictions where its ownership or leasing of property or the conduct of
its business requires it to be so qualified, except where the failure to be so
qualified would not have a Material Adverse Effect. The Company has the
corporate power and authority to own its properties and assets and to carry
on its business as it is now being conducted except where the failure to have
such power and authority would not have a Material Adverse Effect. Company is
registered as a financial holding company with the Federal Reserve
Board ("FRB") under the Bank Holding Company Act of 1956, as amended (the
"BHC Act"). Company has furnished Wells Fargo true and correct copies of its
and the Company Subsidiaries (as defined in paragraph 2(b)) articles
of incorporation and bylaws, as amended and in effect on the date of this
Agreement, and provided access to all minutes of meetings and actions of its
and the Companys subsidiaries respective boards and committees for the
period beginning January 1, 2001 and ending as of the date hereof.

(b) _Company s Subsidiaries_. Schedule 2(b) sets forth a complete and
correct list of all of Companys subsidiaries as of the date hereof
(individually a "Company Subsidiary" and collectively the "Company
Subsidiaries"), all shares of the outstanding capital stock of each of which,
except as set forth in Schedule 2(b), are owned directly or indirectly by
Company. No equity security of any Company Subsidiary is or may be required to
be issued by reason of any option, warrant, scrip, preemptive right, right to
subscribe to, call or commitment of any character whatsoever relating to, or
security or right convertible into, shares of any capital stock of such
subsidiary, and there are no contracts, commitments, understandings or
arrangements by which any Company Subsidiary is bound to issue additional
shares of its capital stock. Subject to 12 U.S.C. § 55 (1982) with respect to
shares held in a national banking association, all of such shares so owned by
Company are fully paid and nonassessable and are owned by it free and clear
of any lien, claim, charge, option, encumbrance or agreement with respect
thereto. Each Company Subsidiary is a corporation, limited liability company,
trust, or national banking association duly incorporated, validly
existing, duly qualified to do business and in good standing under the laws
of its jurisdiction of incorporation, and has corporate power and authority to
own or lease its properties and assets and to carry on its business as it is
now being conducted except where the failure to be so qualified would not
have a Material Adverse Effect. Except as set forth on Schedule 2(b), Company
does not own beneficially, directly or indirectly, more than five percent (5%)
of any class of equity securities or similar interests of any corporation,
bank, business trust, association or similar organization, and is not,
directly or indirectly, a partner in any partnership or party to any joint
venture.

Series A Preferred were outstanding or held in the treasury (or by any Company
Subsidiary) and 2,021,079 shares of Series B Preferred were outstanding and no
shares were held in the treasury (or by any Company Subsidiary). The maximum
number of shares of Company Common Stock (assuming for this purpose that the
conversion of all outstanding shares of Series B Preferred in accordance with
the terms thereof and all phantom shares options and all other rights to
acquire, purchase, or subscribe for shares of Company Common Stock, restricted
stock, stock appreciation rights, or other share equivalents constitute
Company Common Stock) that would be outstanding as of the Effective Date of
the Merger if all options, warrants, conversion rights, and other rights with
respect thereto (other than under the Greater Bay Option Agreement) were
exercised is 62,603,314. Company has reserved 10,172,084 shares of Common

privileges, options, warrants, calls, plans, preemptive rights, or other
rights obligating Company or any Company Subsidiary to issue, sell or
otherwise dispose of, or to purchase, redeem or otherwise acquire, any shares
of capital stock of Company or any Company Subsidiary. Company has provided
Wells Fargo with a list of all Company Stock Options and Rights
outstanding under the Company Stock Option Plans, the holders of all Company
Stock Options and Rights, the exercise price thereof, and the number and date
of grant of Company Stock Options and Rights held by such optionee as of the
date hereof and vesting schedule for all such Company Stock Options and
Rights. The Company has reserved shares of Company Common Stock in an amount
sufficient to be issued upon exercise of all Company Stock Options and Rights
and conversion of the Series B Preferred. Except as set forth in Schedule
2(c), since December 31, 2006, no shares of Company capital stock have been
purchased, redeemed, or otherwise acquired, directly or indirectly, by Company
or any Company Subsidiary and except as set forth in Schedule 2(c), since

adverse effect on the system of internal accounting controls described in the

filed with the SEC prior to the date hereof, Company and the Company
Subsidiaries have devised and maintain a system of internal control over

most recent annual evaluation of internal control over financial reporting
prior to the date hereof, to Companys auditors and the audit committee of
Companys Board of Directors (1) any significant deficiencies in the design or
operation of internal controls which could adversely affect in any material
respect Companys ability to record, process, summarize, and report financial
data and have identified for Companys auditors any material weaknesses in
internal controls and (2) any fraud, whether or not material, that involves
management or other employees who have a significant role in Companys
internal controls. Company has made available to Wells Fargo a summary of any
such disclosure made by management to Companys auditors and audit committee

been any "reportable events" as that term is defined in Section 4043 of ERISA,

basis for any such proceeding, claim or action; except as disclosed in

no pending claims or charges brought by Company or any Company Subsidiary
against any person with respect to the use of any Intellectual Property or

rights plan ("Company Rights Plan") or which would separate such rights from
the Company Common Stock or become exercisable or unredeemable. All rights

in such value.

license, regulation or demand of any federal, state, municipal or other
governmental agency or with respect to any order, writ, injunction or decree

Rule 13a-15(f) of the Exchange Act) sufficient to provide reasonable
assurances regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the
preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted
accounting principles, and Wells Fargo has not received notice from the SEC
questioning the accuracy or completeness of any certifications required by
Sarbanes-Oxley to be included in any Wells Fargo Report filed with the SEC.
Wells Fargo (A) has designed disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in
Rule 13a-15(e) of the Exchange Act, or caused such disclosure controls and
procedures to be designed and implemented under its supervision) to ensure
that material information relating to Wells Fargo, including its consolidated
subsidiaries, is made known to the management of Wells Fargo by others within
those entities and (B) has disclosed, based on its most recent evaluation of
internal control over financial reporting prior to the date hereof, to Wells
Fargos auditors and the audit committee of Wells Fargos Board of Directors
(1) any significant deficiencies in the design or operation of internal
controls which could adversely  



 

-26-  affect in any material respect Wells Fargos ability to record, process,
summarize, and report financial data and have identified for Wells
Fargos auditors any material weaknesses in internal controls and (2) any
fraud, whether or not material, that involves management or other employees

(iii) Each Wells Fargo Plan is and has been in all material respects operated
and administered in accordance with its provisions and applicable law,
including, if applicable, ERISA and the Code.

(iv) Except as set forth on Schedule 3(o), each Wells Fargo Plan intended to
be qualified under Section 401(a) of the Code has received a favorable
determination letter from the Internal Revenue Service stating that the
Wells Fargo Plan (including all amendments) is tax qualified under Section
401(a) of the Code and Wells Fargo knows of no reason that any such Wells

contemplated hereby and thereby.

(r) _No Defaults_. Neither Wells Fargo nor any Wells Fargo Subsidiary is in

giving of notice, or both, would constitute a default under any material
agreement, indenture, loan agreement or other instrument to which it is a
party or by which it or any of its assets is bound or to which any of its
assets is subject, the result of which has had or could reasonably be expected
to have a material adverse effect upon Wells Fargo and its subsidiaries taken

material respects.

including, without limitation, CERCLA, pending or to the  



 

-28-  best of Wells Fargos knowledge, threatened against Wells Fargo or any Wells
Fargo Subsidiary, the result of which has had or could reasonably be expected
to have a material adverse effect upon Wells Fargo and its subsidiaries taken
as a whole; to the best of Wells Fargos knowledge, there is no reasonable
basis for any such proceeding, claim or action; and to the best of
