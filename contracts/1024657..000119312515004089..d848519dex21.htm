pay money, to perform obligations or to admit liability without the consent of the other party, such consent not to be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed. If the Indemnified Party shall refuse to consent to the settlement of any Third
Party Claim, so long as only money damages are involved and there is no admission of liability or wrongdoing with respect to the Indemnified Party, the liability of the Indemnitor in respect of such Third Party Claim shall not exceed the amount for
which the Third Party Claim could have been settled plus the amount of expenses incurred by the Indemnified Party prior to the time of and in connection with the proposed settlement to which it is entitled to indemnification. Notwithstanding the
foregoing, the Indemnified Party shall have the right to pay, settle or compromise any Third Party Claim without consent, <U>provided</U> that in such event the Indemnified Party shall waive any right to indemnity therefor hereunder. </P>
