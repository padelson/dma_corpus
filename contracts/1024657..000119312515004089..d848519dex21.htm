pay, discharge or perform any Seller Taxes, which Seller Taxes shall be paid
by Seller pursuant to _Section 8.1_, or any Liabilities of Seller or the
other Asset Contributors or any other member of the Seller Group except for
the Assumed Liabilities (the " _Excluded Liabilities_ "), including the
following Liabilities of Seller or the other Asset Contributors,
notwithstanding any other provisions of this Agreement:

 

(i) any indebtedness for borrowed money, other than indebtedness reflected in
the Closing Date Working Capital;

 

(ii) all Liabilities to the extent related to the Excluded Assets or arising
out of any cause of action to the extent related to the Excluded Assets,
whether accruing before, on or after the Closing Date, whether known or
unknown, fixed or contingent, asserted or unasserted, and not satisfied or
extinguished as of the Closing Date; and

 

(iii) all Liabilities of Seller or any of its Affiliates arising or incurred
in connection with the negotiation, preparation, investigation and
performance of this Agreement, the other Ancillary Agreements and the
transactions contemplated hereby and thereby, including, without limitation,
fees and expenses of counsel, accountants, consultants, advisers (including

18 (e) _Third Party Consents_. To the extent that any Asset Contributors rights
under any Contract or Governmental Permit constituting a Contributed Asset, or
any other Contributed Asset, may not be assigned to the applicable member of
the Company Group without the consent of another Person which has not been
obtained, this Agreement shall not constitute an agreement to assign the same
if an attempted assignment would constitute a breach thereof or be unlawful;
_provided_ , _however_ , that subject to the satisfaction or waiver of the
conditions contained in _Articles IX_ and _X_ , the Closing shall occur
notwithstanding the foregoing without any adjustment to the Purchase Price on
account thereof. Following the Closing, at the request of Buyer, Seller shall
use its reasonable best efforts to obtain any such required consent(s) as
promptly as possible; _provided_ , _however_ , that neither the Seller Group
nor the Buyer Group shall be required to pay any consideration therefor. If
any such consent shall not be obtained or if any attempted assignment would
be ineffective or would impair the Company Groups rights under the
Contributed Asset in question so that the applicable member of the Company
Group would not in effect acquire the benefit of all such rights, the parties
shall use commercially reasonable efforts to enter into such arrangements
(such as subleasing, sublicensing or subcontracting) to provide to the parties
the economic and, to the extent permitted under applicable Requirements of
Law, operational equivalent of the transfer of such asset and/or Liability as
of the Closing.

3.2. _Determination of Estimated Purchase Price_. At least five (5) calendar
days prior to the Closing, Seller shall deliver to Buyer a written
calculation (the " _Price Calculation_ ") substantially in the form attached
hereto as _Schedule 3.2_ setting forth in reasonable detail Sellers estimate
of the Purchase Price (the " _Estimated Purchase Price_ "), including the

Capital_ ") and the components thereof. The Price Calculation shall be
prepared in good faith by Seller.

 

3.3. _Post-Closing Adjustments_. (a) As promptly as practicable (but not later
than ninety (90) days) following the Closing Date, Buyer shall:

(i) prepare, in accordance with the Agreed Accounting Principles, a Closing
Date Balance Sheet (the " _Preliminary Closing Date Balance Sheet_ "); and

Preliminary Closing Date Balance Sheet and the Preliminary Closing Date
Working Capital (such period, the " _Review Period_ "), deliver to Buyer a
written statement (" _Notice of Objection_ ") setting forth its objections
thereto, together with a summary of the reasons therefor and calculations
which, in its view, are necessary to eliminate such objections. In the event
Seller does not so object within the Review Period, the Preliminary Closing
Date Balance Sheet and the Preliminary Closing Date Working Capital shall be
final and binding as the Closing Date Balance Sheet and the Closing Date
Working Capital, respectively, for purposes of this Agreement. In the event
Seller so objects within the Review Period, Buyer and Seller shall use their
reasonable efforts to resolve by written agreement (the " _Agreed
Adjustments_ ") any differences as to the Preliminary Closing Date Balance
Sheet and the Preliminary Closing Date Working Capital and, in the event
Seller and Buyer so resolve any such differences, the Preliminary Closing
Date Balance Sheet and the Preliminary Closing Date Working Capital, in each
case as adjusted by the Agreed Adjustments, shall be final and binding as the
Closing Date Balance Sheet and the Closing Date Working Capital,

Buyer and Seller, and such firm (the " _Accounting Firm_ ") shall be directed
by Buyer and Seller to resolve the unresolved objections as promptly as
reasonably practicable and to deliver (within 30 days after the engagement of
the Accounting Firm) written notice to each of Buyer and Seller setting forth
its resolution of the disputed matters. The Accounting Firms role in
completing such review shall be limited to resolving such objections and
determining the correct calculations to be used with respect to only the
disputed portions of the Preliminary Closing Date Balance Sheet and
the Preliminary Closing Date Working Capital. In resolving such objections,
the Accounting Firm shall apply the provisions of this Agreement concerning
determination of the amounts set forth in the Preliminary Closing Date Balance
Sheet and the Preliminary Closing Date Working Capital and the decision of
the Accounting Firm shall be solely based on (i) whether such item objected to
was prepared in accordance with the guidelines set forth in this Agreement
concerning determination of the amounts set forth therein, including, for the
avoidance of doubt, the Agreed Accounting Principles or (ii) whether such item
objected to contains a mathematical or clerical error; _provided_ , _however_
, that, in making such decision, the Accounting Firm shall not use any dollar
amount that is either lower or higher, as applicable, than those which were
proposed by Buyer and Seller. The Preliminary Closing Date Balance Sheet and
the Preliminary Closing Date Working Capital, in each case after giving
effect to any Agreed Adjustments and to the resolution of disputed matters by
the Accounting Firm, shall be final and binding as the Closing Date Balance
Sheet and the Closing Date Working Capital, respectively, for purposes of
this Agreement.

(c) Each of Buyer and Seller shall make available, and shall cause their
respective Affiliates to make available, to the other and their respective
Affiliates and representatives (at the expense of the requesting party) and,

information (including work papers) as any of the foregoing may reasonably
request in connection with the preparation and/or review of the Preliminary
Closing Date Balance Sheet and the Preliminary Closing Date Working Capital,
respectively, or any matters submitted to the Accounting Firm. The fees and
expenses of the Accounting Firm under this _Section 3.3_, if any, shall be
paid 50% by Buyer and 50% by Seller.

 

3.4. _Payment of Adjustments_. Promptly (but not later than five (5) Business
Days) after the final determination of the Closing Date Working Capital
pursuant to _Section 3.3_, the following shall occur:

(a) if the Purchase Price is greater than the Estimated Purchase Price, Buyer
shall pay to Seller, by wire transfer of immediately available funds, a dollar
amount equal to the amount by which the Purchase Price exceeds the Estimated
Purchase Price; and

 

(b) if the Purchase Price is less than the Estimated Purchase Price, Seller
shall pay to Buyer, by wire transfer of immediately available funds, a dollar
amount equal to the amount by which the Estimated Purchase Price exceeds the
Purchase Price.

 



21 For avoidance of doubt, if the Purchase Price as finally determined hereunder
is equal to the Estimated Purchase Price, no payments will be made by the
parties pursuant to this _Section 3.4_.

3.5. _Allocation of Purchase Price_.

 

(a) Buyer and Seller agree that the Purchase Price shall be allocated among
the Companies Equity sold in accordance with  _Section 3.1_.

(b) (i) Within 45 days following the finalization of the Closing Date Balance
Sheet, Seller shall deliver to Buyer a schedule (the " _Preliminary
Allocation Schedule_ ") (A) allocating the Purchase Price among the capital
stock or other equity interests in each of the Companies and (B) with respect
to the amount so allocated to the equity interests of West Business
Solutions, LLC, allocating such amount among the assets of West Business
Solutions, LLC, such allocation to be made consistent with _Section 3.1_ and
in accordance with Section 1060 of the Code and the Treasury Regulations
thereunder. If, within 30 days following delivery of the Preliminary
Allocation Schedule, Buyer does not notify Seller in writing of its
disagreement with the Preliminary Allocation Schedule, the
Preliminary Allocation Schedule shall become final and binding. If, within 30
days following delivery of the Preliminary Allocation Schedule, Buyer notifies
Seller in writing of its disagreement with the Preliminary Allocation
Schedule, Seller and Buyer shall endeavor to resolve such disagreement, and,
if they are able to do so, shall make such revisions to the Preliminary
Allocation Schedule to reflect such resolution, which shall be final and
binding on Buyer and Seller.

 

(ii) If, within 20 days following such notification by Buyer to Seller (or
such longer period as Buyer and Seller mutually agree) Seller and Buyer are
unable to resolve any disagreement, then each of Buyer and Seller shall be
entitled to allocate the Purchase Price among the capital stock or other
equity interests in each of the Companies and the assets of West
Business Solutions, LLC in any manner it so determines in its sole
discretion; _provided_ , that no such allocation amongst the capital stock or
other equity interests shall be inconsistent with _Section 3.1_, adjusted
solely to reflect the sources of any difference between the Purchase Price
and the Base Purchase Price. Each of Buyer and Seller agrees that it shall
not, and shall cause each of its Affiliates not to, take any position on any
Tax Return or otherwise for Tax or other purposes, (i) inconsistent with the
final and binding Preliminary Allocation Schedule, if any, or (ii) in the
absence of a final and binding Preliminary Allocation Schedule, inconsistent
with _Section 3.1_, adjusted solely to reflect the sources of any difference
between the Purchase Price and the Base Purchase Price; _provided_ , _however_
, neither Buyer nor Seller (nor any of their Affiliates) shall be required to
litigate before any court, or contest before any administrative agency, any
proposed deficiency or adjustment by any Governmental Body challenging such
allocation.

6.1. _Organization of Buyer_. Buyer is a corporation validly existing and in
good standing under the laws of the State of California. Buyer has the
requisite power and authority to own or lease and to operate and use its
properties and assets and to carry on its business as now conducted.

 



42 6.2. _Authority of Buyer_.

 

(a) Buyer has the requisite corporate power and authority to execute, deliver
and perform this Agreement and to consummate the transactions contemplated
hereby. The execution, delivery and performance of this Agreement by Buyer
have been duly authorized and approved by Buyers board of directors and does
not require any further authorization or consent of Buyer or
its stockholders. This Agreement has been duly authorized, executed and
delivered by Buyer and (assuming the valid authorization, execution and
delivery of this Agreement by Seller) is the legal, valid and binding
agreement of Buyer enforceable against Buyer in accordance with its terms,
enforceable against Buyer in accordance with its terms subject to bankruptcy,
insolvency, reorganization, moratorium and similar laws of general application
relating to or affecting creditors rights and to general equity principles.
Each Buyer Group Member that is a party to a Buyer Ancillary Agreement has the
requisite corporate or limited liability company power and authority to
execute, deliver and perform such Buyer Ancillary Agreement and to consummate
the transactions contemplated thereby. The execution, delivery and performance
of the Buyer Ancillary Agreements to which each Buyer Group Member is a party
have been duly authorized and approved by board of directors, managers or
members of such Buyer Group Member and does not require any further
authorization or consent of such Buyer Group Member or its stockholders,
managers or members. Each Buyer Ancillary Agreement has been (or at or before
Closing will have been) duly authorized, executed and delivered by the Buyer
Group Member party thereto and (assuming the valid authorization, execution
and delivery of such Buyer Ancillary Agreement by the applicable Seller Group
Member(s) party thereto) is (or will be) the legal, valid and binding
agreement of such Buyer Group Member enforceable against such Buyer Group
Member in accordance with its terms, subject to bankruptcy, insolvency,
reorganization, moratorium and similar laws of general application relating
to or affecting creditors rights and to general equity principles.

(b) Neither the execution and delivery of this Agreement or any of the Buyer
Ancillary Agreements or the consummation of any of the transactions
contemplated hereby or thereby nor performance, compliance with or fulfillment
of the terms, conditions and provisions hereof or thereof, in each case by
Buyer or any other Buyer Group Member, as applicable, will:

(i) conflict with, violate, result in a breach of the terms, conditions or
provisions of, or constitute a default (with or without notice or lapse of
time, or both), an event of default or an event creating additional rights
(such as rights of amendment, impairment, modification,
suspension, revocation, rights of acceleration, termination or cancellation),
or a loss of rights under, or result in the creation or imposition of any
Encumbrance upon any of the assets of any Buyer Group Member under (1) the
organizational documents of such Buyer Group Member, (2) any material note,
instrument, agreement, mortgage, lease, license, franchise, permit or other
authorization, right, restriction or obligation to which such Buyer Group
Member is a party or by which such Buyer Group Member or any of its
properties is bound, (3) any Court Order to which such Buyer Group Member is a
bound or by which such Buyer or any of their properties is bound or (4) any
material Requirements of Law by which such Buyer Group Member is

 



43  bound, except in the case of _clauses (2)_ through _(4)_ as would not,
individually or in the aggregate, reasonably be expected to materially impair
the ability of Buyer to perform its obligations hereunder or prevent or
materially delay the consummation of any of the transactions contemplated
hereby; or

 

(ii) require the approval, consent, authorization or act of, or the making by
any Buyer Group Member of any material declaration, filing or registration
with, any Governmental Body, except for the filings required under the HSR Act
or as would not, individually or in the aggregate, reasonably be expected to
materially impair the ability of Buyer to perform its obligations hereunder
or prevent or materially delay the consummation of any of the transactions
contemplated hereby.

(c) As of the date hereof, there is no Proceeding by any Governmental Body
pending or, to the Knowledge of Buyer, threatened against Buyer that questions
the legality or propriety of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement.

 

6.3. _Financing_.

 

(a) Concurrently with the execution of this Agreement, Buyer has delivered to
Seller true and correct copies of fully executed commitment letters (the "
_Debt Commitment Letters_ ") providing the terms and conditions upon which the
issuers thereof (collectively, the " _Lenders_ ") have committed to provide
the full amount of debt financing required in connection with this Agreement
(the " _Debt Financing_ "). The Debt Commitment Letters are in full force and
effect as of the date of this Agreement. The obligations to fund the full
amount of the commitments under the Debt Commitment Letters are not subject
to any conditions other than as set forth in the Debt Commitment Letters.
There is no fact or occurrence existing as of the date of this Agreement that
makes any of the assumptions or statements set forth in the Debt Commitment
Letters inaccurate or that causes the Debt Commitment Letters to be
ineffective with respect to Buyer or that precludes or is reasonably likely to
preclude the satisfaction of the conditions set forth in the Debt Commitment
Letters. All commitment and other fees required to be paid under the Debt
Commitment Letters on or prior to the date hereof have been paid.

 

(b) Subject to its terms and conditions, the Debt Financing, when funded in
accordance with the Debt Commitment Letters, will provide Buyer with funds
sufficient on the Closing Date to consummate the transactions contemplated by
this Agreement on the terms contemplated hereby, including, for the avoidance
of doubt, to pay the Purchase Price and all related fees and expenses payable
by Buyer in connection with this Agreement and the transactions contemplated
hereby at the Closing.

6.4. _Investment Intent_. Buyer is acquiring the Companies Equity as an
investment for its own account and not with a view to the distribution or sale
thereof and is an "accredited investor" within the meaning of Regulation D
promulgated under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended. Buyer shall not
sell, transfer, assign, pledge or hypothecate any of the Companies Equity in
the absence of registration under, or pursuant to an applicable exemption
from, federal and all applicable state securities laws.

 



44 6.5. _No Finder_. Neither Buyer nor any Person acting on its behalf has paid
or become obligated to pay any fee or commission to any broker, finder or
intermediary for or on account of the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement.

 

6.6. _Solvency_. Assuming the accuracy of the representations and warranties
of Seller set forth in _Article V_ , immediately after giving effect to the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement at Closing, each Company Group
Member will be able to pay its debts as they become due and will own property
which has a fair saleable value greater than the amounts required to pay its
debts (including a reasonable estimate of the amount of all contingent
liabilities). Assuming the accuracy of the representations and warranties of
Seller set forth in _Article V_ , immediately after giving effect to the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement, the Company Group will have
adequate capital to carry on the Business. No transfer of property is being
made by Buyer, its Affiliates or any Company Group Member at Closing or
immediately thereafter and no obligation is being incurred in connection with
the transactions contemplated by this Agreement with the intent to hinder,
delay or defraud either present or future creditors of any Company Group
Member.

 

ARTICLE VII

ACTION PRIOR TO THE CLOSING DATE

The respective parties hereto covenant and agree to take the following actions
between the date hereof and the Closing Date:

7.1. _Access to Records_. Subject to applicable Requirements of Law, Seller
shall afford to the officers, employees and authorized representatives of
Buyer (including, without limitation, independent public accountants and
attorneys) reasonable access during normal business hours upon reasonable
advance notice to the offices, properties, employees and business and
financial records of the Company Group, and to the business and financial
records of the Asset Contributors to the extent such records are related to
the Contributed Assets and the Assumed Liabilities, in each case, as and to
the extent reasonably necessary to consummate the transactions contemplated
by this Agreement and the Ancillary Documents and shall furnish to Buyer or
its authorized representatives such additional information concerning the
Company Group, the Contributed Assets and the Assumed Liabilities as shall be
reasonably requested; _provided_ , _however_ , that Seller shall not be
required to (a) violate any obligation of confidentiality, non-disclosure or
other Requirements of Law to which it; any other Selling Entity or any
Company Group Member is then subject, (b) disclose any information or provide
any access that the Sellers counsel determines in good faith will result in
the loss of attorney-client privilege with respect to such information or a
breach of any confidentiality obligation of Seller or violation of any
Requirement of Law (in which case Seller will provide any related information
or discuss such matter to the extent permissible without waiving attorney-
client privilege, violation of confidentiality obligation or violation of
Requirement of Law, as the case may be) or (c) provide any information that it
reasonably believes constitutes personal medical or health information that it
is prohibited from providing due to Requirements of Law. Buyer shall not
undertake any environmental sampling without Sellers prior consent, which
consent shall be at the sole discretion of Seller. Buyer agrees that any
investigation under this  _Section 7.1_ shall be conducted in such a manner
as not to interfere unreasonably with the operations of Seller or the Company
Group or any of their respective Affiliates. If, in the course of any
investigation 

 



45  pursuant to this _Section 7.1_, Buyer acquires Knowledge of any breach of
any representation or warranty of Seller contained in this Agreement, or any
circumstance or condition that upon Closing would constitute such a breach,

plan with respect to the Business Employees, except as consistent with past

the Tax Liability to which the Contributed Assets could be subject, levied or
assessed, for any period ending after the Closing Date; _provided_ ,
_however_ , for the avoidance of doubt, Seller or any Company Group Member or
any Affiliate thereof shall be entitled to settle or otherwise resolve any Tax

paying, pre-paying, reducing or otherwise discharging any indebtedness for
borrowed money of any Company Group Member, up until the completion of the
Closing. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained herein, nothing
shall prohibit or limit the transfer of Excluded Assets prior to the Closing

(a) During the period prior to the Closing Date, each party hereto shall, and
shall cause its Affiliates to, act diligently and reasonably and shall, at
the request of the other party hereto, use its commercially reasonable efforts
to cooperate with such other party in attempting to secure any consents,
waivers and approvals of any third party (including any Governmental Body)
required to be obtained to consummate the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement and set forth on _Schedule 7.3(a)(i)_ , and in connection therewith
may agree to an extension of the term of the Contract for which such consent
is being sought, to the extent that such extension is provided for on
_Schedule 7.3(a)(i)_ , and Seller shall, and shall cause its applicable
Subsidiaries to, use commercially reasonable efforts to seek the release by
the lien holder (or its successor) of the Encumbrance listed on _Schedule
7.3(a)(ii)_ ; _provided_ , _however_ , that, in each case, notwithstanding
anything to the contrary in this Agreement, such action shall not include any
requirement of Seller, Buyer or any of their respective Affiliates
(including, for the avoidance of doubt, the Company Group Members on or prior
to the Closing Date) to pay money to any third party (other than _de minimis_
administrative and review costs), commence or participate in any litigation,
arbitration, mediation or administrative process, offer or grant any
accommodation or undertake any obligation or liability (in each case financial
or otherwise) to any third party (including any Governmental Body); _provided_
,  _further_ , _however_ , that prior to the Closing, neither Buyer or its
Affiliates nor any of their respective officers, employees or authorized
representatives may contact any customer, supplier, independent service
provider or lessor of any Company Group Member regarding the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement, or any other third party (other than any
Governmental Body) in connection with any such consent, without Sellers prior
written consent (which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld,
conditioned or delayed).

(b) Without limiting the generality and limitations of  _Section 7.3(a)_,
and except as set forth in _Section 7.3(d)_, upon the terms and subject to
the conditions set forth in this Agreement, each of the parties hereto agrees
to use its commercially reasonable efforts to take, or cause to be taken, all
actions, and to do, or cause to be done, and to assist and cooperate with the
other party in doing all things necessary, proper or advisable to

 



49  consummate, in the most expeditious manner practicable, the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement, including (i) obtaining all necessary actions
or non-actions, waivers, consents and approvals from all Governmental Bodies
and making all necessary registrations and filings (including with
Governmental Bodies) and taking all steps as may be necessary to obtain an
approval or waiver from, or to avoid a Proceeding by, any Governmental Body
(including those in connection with the HSR Act), (ii) keeping the other party
informed in all respects of any substantive communication received by such
party from, or given by such party to, any Governmental Body and of
any substantive communication received or given in connection with any
Proceeding by a private party relating to the transactions contemplated by
this Agreement, in each case regarding any of the transactions contemplated
hereby, (iii) permitting the other party to review any substantive
communication delivered to, and consulting with the other party in advance of

obtain any consent to the transactions contemplated by this Agreement or (ii)
consent to any sale, divestiture, license or disposition of any of the assets
or businesses of Buyer (or its Affiliates, including, for the avoidance of
doubt, following the Closing, the Company Group members) or otherwise take or
commit to take actions that limit Buyers freedom of action with respect to,
or its ability to retain, any of the businesses, product lines or assets of
Buyer (or its Affiliates, including, for the avoidance of doubt, following the
Closing, the members of the Company Group). For the avoidance of doubt,
nothing in this _Section 7.3(d)_ shall limit Buyers obligation to use its
commercially reasonable efforts to obtain all necessary actions or non-
actions, waivers, consents and approvals, and make all necessary registrations
and filings (including submitting a response to a second request) and take
all steps as may be necessary to obtain an approval or waiver from, or to

unreasonably withheld or delayed).

(b) Each of Seller and Buyer understands and agrees that any transfers,
assignments, sales or other dispositions of assets, interest, rights, capital

to Seller or one or more of its Affiliates or from Seller or one or more of
its Affiliates to a Company Group Member, shall be made on an "AS-IS",
"WHERE-IS" basis, without representation or warranty of any kind except as
expressly set forth in this Agreement or the applicable transfer or
assignment document, and without recourse to the party making such transfer,
assignment, sale or other disposition, and without recourse to the recipient
thereof.

(a) Between the date of this Agreement and the earlier of the Closing Date and
the termination of this Agreement in accordance with the terms of this

of any Proceeding that shall be instituted or threatened against such party to
restrain, prohibit or otherwise challenge the legality of any transaction
contemplated by this Agreement or any Ancillary Agreement. Seller shall
promptly notify Buyer upon obtaining Knowledge of (a) any Proceeding that may
be instituted or threatened against any Company Group Member or any Selling
Entity which would have been listed in _Schedule 5.14_ if such Proceeding had
arisen prior to the date hereof and (b) any other event or matter which, to
the Knowledge of Seller, would cause any other representation or warranty
contained in  _Article V_ to be untrue in any material respect. No such
notification shall affect any of the representations and warranties of Seller
hereunder, or the conditions to the obligations of the parties contained
herein or otherwise affect the remedies available.

(b) Between the date of this Agreement and the earlier of the Closing Date and
the termination of this Agreement in accordance with the terms of this
Agreement, Seller shall promptly advise the Buyer in writing upon obtaining
Knowledge of (a) any change or event having a Material Adverse Effect, (b) any
notice or other communication from any Governmental Body alleging that the
consent of such Governmental Body is or may be required in connection with the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement, (c) any material default under
any Company Contract or event which, with notice or lapse of time or both,
would become such a default on or prior to the Closing and (d) any material
adverse change in, or any termination of, or threatened termination in writing
of, the business relationship between any Company Group Member or any Selling
Entity, on the one hand, and any Top 20 Customer or Top 10 Supplier, on the
other hand, in respect of the Business. No such

 



51  notification shall affect any of the representations and warranties of
Seller hereunder, or the conditions to the obligations of the parties
contained herein or otherwise affect the remedies available.

(c) Notwithstanding _Section 7.5(a)_ and _Section 7.5(b)_, if a party fails
to notify the other party under this _Section 7.5_, (i) such non-breaching
party shall only be entitled to seek indemnification for breach of this
_Section 7.5_ if and to the extent such non-breaching party is otherwise
entitled to indemnification pursuant to _Section 11.1_ or _Section 11.2_,
as the case may be, for breach of a representation and warranty, and the
limits (if any) set forth in _Section 11.1_ or _Section 11.2_, as the
case may be, shall apply to any such indemnification, and (ii) a failure to
comply with this _Section 7.5_ shall not cause the failure of any condition
set forth in _Article IX_ or _Article X_ , as the case may be, to be
satisfied unless the underlying change, event or development would
independently result in the failure of a condition set forth in _Article IX_
or _Article X_ , as the case may be, to be satisfied.

 

7.6. _No Solicitation of Other Bids_.

 

(a) For the 30-day period following the date of this Agreement, Seller shall
not, and shall not authorize or permit any of its Affiliates or any of its or
their Representatives to, directly or indirectly, (i) encourage, solicit,
initiate, facilitate or continue inquiries regarding an Acquisition Proposal;
(ii) enter into discussions or negotiations with, or provide any information
to, any Person concerning a possible Acquisition Proposal; or (iii) enter into
any agreements or other instruments (whether or not binding) regarding an
Acquisition Proposal; _provided_ , _however_ , that nothing contained in this
sentence shall preclude Seller from complying with its reporting obligations
under applicable securities laws. Seller shall immediately cease and cause to
be terminated, and shall cause its Affiliates and all of its and
their Representatives to immediately cease and cause to be terminated all
existing discussions or negotiations with any Persons conducted heretofore
with respect to, or that could lead to, an Acquisition Proposal. For purposes
hereof, " _Alternative Transaction_ " means any (i) direct or indirect
acquisition of assets of the Business equal to 20% or more of the fair market
value of the combined assets of the Business or to which 20% or more of net
revenues or net income on a combined basis of the Business are attributable,
(ii) direct or indirect acquisition of 20% or more of the voting equity
interests of any Company Group Member, (iii) tender offer or exchange offer
that if consummated would result in any person beneficially owning 20% or
more of the voting equity interests of any Company Group Member, or (iv)
merger, consolidation, other business combination or similar transaction
involving the Business or any Company Group Member, pursuant to which such
person would own 20% or more of the combined assets, net revenues or net
income of the Business, taken as a whole; in all cases of clauses (i)-(iv)
where such transaction is to be entered into with any person or group of
persons other than Buyer and its Affiliates. For purposes hereof, "
_Acquisition Proposal_ " means any inquiry, proposal or offer from any Person
(other than Buyer or any of its Affiliates) relating to any Alternative
Transaction. It is agreed that the sale of the capital stock of Seller, any
equity interest in Seller or its assets and business as a whole shall not be
deemed to be an Alternative Transaction. Notwithstanding anything to the
contrary contained herein, nothing shall prohibit or limit the transfer of
Excluded Assets prior to the Closing or limit in any manner Sellers ability
to take any actions expressly contemplated by _Article II_ and _Section 7.4_.

 



52 (b) In addition to the other obligations under this _Section 7.6_, Seller
shall promptly (and in any event within three (3) Business Days after receipt
thereof by Seller or its Representatives) advise Buyer orally and in writing
of any Acquisition Proposal and the material terms and conditions of
such Acquisition Proposal.

(c) Seller agrees that the rights and remedies for noncompliance with this
_Section 7.6_ shall include having such provision specifically enforced by
any court having equity jurisdiction, it being acknowledged and agreed that
any such breach or threatened breach shall cause irreparable injury to Buyer
and that money damages would not provide an adequate remedy to Buyer.

7.7. _Pre-Closing Financing Obligations_.

 

(a) Prior to the Closing, Buyer shall use its reasonable best efforts to
arrange and to consummate the Debt Financing as soon as reasonably
practicable after the date of this Agreement on the terms and conditions
described in the Debt Commitment Letters ( _provided_ that Buyer may replace
or amend the Debt Commitment Letters to add Lenders, lead arrangers,
bookrunners, syndication agents, similar entities, as applicable, which had
not executed the Debt Commitment Letters as of the date hereof, or otherwise
on terms which would not (x) expand the conditions precedent to the Debt
Financing as set forth in the Debt Commitment Letters as of the date hereof,
(y) delay the Closing or (z) reduce the aggregate amount available under the
Debt Commitment Letters below an amount that, when combined with Buyers other
sources of funds, is sufficient to pay the Purchase Price and all related
fees and expenses of Buyer in connection with this Agreement and the
transactions contemplated hereby at the Closing), which reasonable best
efforts shall include (i) negotiating definitive agreements with respect to
the Debt Financing on terms and conditions contained in the Debt Commitment
Letters (the " _Financing Agreements_ "), (ii) satisfying on a timely basis
all conditions in the Debt Commitment Letters and the Financing Agreements,
(iii) enforcing its rights under the Debt Commitment Letters and the Financing
Agreements; _provided_ , _however_ , that Buyer shall not be required to, and
Buyer shall not be required to cause any other Person to,
commence, participate in, pursue or defend any Proceeding against or
involving any of Buyers lenders or other Persons that have or may have agreed
to provide any portion of, or otherwise with respect to, the Debt Financing,
and (iv) drawing upon any bridge financing provided for therein.

(b) In the event that any portion of the Debt Financing becomes unavailable
on the terms and conditions contemplated in the Debt Commitment Letters
and/or the Financing Agreements, prior to the Closing, Buyer shall use its
reasonable best efforts to arrange to obtain, as promptly as reasonably
practicable, financing from alternative sources in an amount sufficient to
consummate the transactions contemplated by this Agreement on terms comparable
to those contained in the Debt Commitment Letters (the " _Alternative
Financing_ ") and to obtain (and, when obtained, to provide Seller with a
copy of) a new financing commitment for the Alternative Financing (the "
_Alternative Financing Commitment Letter_ "). To the extent applicable, prior
to the Closing, Buyer shall use its reasonable best efforts to arrange and to
consummate the Alternative Financing as soon as reasonably practicable on the
terms and conditions described in the Alternative Financing Commitment Letter,
which reasonable best efforts shall include (i) negotiating definitive
agreements with

 



53  respect thereto on terms and conditions contained therein (the "
_Alternative Financing Agreements_ "), (ii) satisfying on a timely basis all
conditions in the Alternative Financing Commitment Letter and the Alternative
Financing Agreements, (iii) enforcing its rights under the Alternative
Financing Commitment Letter and the Alternative Financing Agreements;
_provided_ , _however_ , that Buyer shall not be required to, and Buyer shall
not be required to cause any other Person to, commence, participate in, pursue
or defend any Proceeding against or involving any of Buyers lenders or other
Persons that have or may have agreed to provide any portion of, or otherwise
with respect to, the Alternative Financing, and (iv) drawing upon any bridge
financing provided for therein.

 

(c) Buyer shall give Seller notice as promptly as reasonably practicable (and
in any event within three (3) Business Days) of any breach or termination by
any party of the Debt Commitment Letters and/or the Financing Agreements and,
if applicable, the Alternative Financing Commitment Letter and/or the
Alternative Financing Agreements. Upon Sellers reasonable request, Buyer
shall inform Seller in reasonable detail of the status of its efforts to
arrange the Debt Financing and, if applicable, the Alternative Financing and
shall not permit any material amendment or modification to be made to, or any
waiver of any material provision or remedy under, the Debt Commitment Letters
and/or the Financing Agreements, and, if applicable, the Alternative Financing
Commitment Letter and the Alternative Financing Agreements without Sellers
prior written consent, which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld,
delayed or conditioned.

(d) Prior to the Closing, Seller shall provide, at Buyers expense, and shall
cause its Affiliates and their respective directors, officers, managers,
employees, consultants, counsel, accountants, agents, advisors and other
representatives (with respect to any Person, the foregoing are collectively
referred to as such Persons " _Representatives_ "), including legal and
accounting advisors, to use their commercially reasonable efforts to provide
all cooperation reasonably requested by Buyer, its Debt Financing and
Alternative Financing sources (including the Lenders in the Debt Financing)
and each of their respective Representatives in connection with the
arrangement of the Debt Financing or any Alternative Financing, including, to
the extent reasonable, furnishing Buyer and the Lenders with financial and
other pertinent information regarding the Business as may be reasonably
requested; _provided_ , _however_ , that (w) such cooperation shall not
unreasonably interfere with the ongoing operations of the Seller or the
Business, (x) none of the Seller or the Business or any of their respective
directors or officers shall be obligated to adopt or approve resolutions or
execute consents to approve or authorize the execution of the Debt Financing
unless such directors or officers will continue in such positions or in
similar positions after the Closing and, in each case, such documents shall
not become effective until the Closing or thereafter, (y) no obligation of
the Seller or the Business under any agreement, certificate document or
instrument shall be effective until the Closing and (z) none of the Seller,
the Business or their respective representatives, agents or affiliates shall
be required to pay or incur any liability for any commitment or other fee or
pay or incur any other liability in connection with the Debt Financing prior
to the Closing.

 

Notwithstanding the foregoing, nothing set forth in this _Section 7.7(d)_
shall require such cooperation by the Seller, the Business or their
respective directors, officers, employees, Affiliates, agents or
representatives to the extent it would (x) cause any condition to Closing

 



54  set forth in this Agreement to fail to be satisfied or otherwise cause any
breach of this Agreement that would provide Buyer the right to terminate this
Agreement or seek indemnity under the terms hereof (unless, in each case,
waived by Buyer), (y) require the Seller or the Business to take any action
that will conflict with or violate their formation or organization documents
or any legal requirements or result in the contravention of, or would
reasonably be expected to result in a violation or breach of, or default
under, any law, or material agreement (it being understood that the foregoing
shall not prevent such Persons from seeking any consents reasonably requested
by the Buyer in connection with the Debt Financing) or (z) result in any
employee, officer or director of the Seller or the Business incurring any
personal liability (as opposed to liability in his or her capacity as an
officer of such Person) with respect to any matters related to the Debt
Financing. Buyer shall promptly, upon request by Seller, reimburse Seller or
the Business, as applicable, for all reasonable and documented out-of-pocket
costs and expenses (including reasonable attorneys fees) incurred by Seller
or the Business in connection with the cooperation contemplated by this
_Section 7.7(d)_. Buyer shall indemnify and hold harmless Seller and the
Business and their respective officers, directors and other representatives
for and against any and all Losses or damages suffered or incurred by them in
connection with the arrangement and/or consummation of the Debt Financing and
any information utilized in connection therewith, in each case except to the
extent the relevant amounts result from the bad faith, gross negligence or
willful misconduct of Seller, the Business or any of their respective
officers, directors or other representatives. Notwithstanding anything herein
to the contrary, the obligations of Buyer under this paragraph shall survive
the termination of this Agreement.

Buyer acknowledges and agrees that, except as otherwise expressly provided in
this _Section 7.7_, Seller and its Affiliates and representatives have no
responsibility for any financing (including, for the avoidance of doubt, the
Debt Financing and the Alternative Financing) that Buyer may raise in
connection with the transactions contemplated hereby.

(e) Notwithstanding the foregoing, compliance by Buyer with this _Section
7.7_ shall not relieve Buyer of its obligation to consummate the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement, whether or not the Debt Financing is
available.

 

7.8. _Pre-Closing Delivery of IP Cross-License Agreement_. Prior to Closing,
Buyer shall, upon written request by Seller, promptly deliver to Seller the
IP Cross-License Agreement, duly executed by Buyer; _provided_ , _however_ ,
that, in accordance with its terms, such executed and delivered IP Cross-
License Agreement shall only become effective upon consummation of the
Closing and, until effective, Buyer shall have no obligation or liability
thereunder. If Buyer has executed and delivered the IP Cross-License Agreement
and if the Closing does not occur, the IP Cross-License shall become void
without further action on the part of Buyer or Seller upon the termination of
this Agreement in accordance with its terms. If Seller makes no such written
request prior to the Closing, Buyer shall deliver the IP Cross-License
Agreement, duly executed by Buyer, to Seller at Closing in accordance with
_Section 4.3_.

ADDITIONAL AGREEMENTS

 

8.1. _Tax Matters_.

 

(a) _Liability for Taxes_.

 

(i) Seller shall be liable for and pay, and pursuant to _Article XI_ (and
subject to the limitations thereof), shall indemnify and hold harmless each
Buyer Group Member from and against any and all of the following Taxes
(collectively, the " _Seller Taxes_ "): (A) Taxes imposed on any member of the
Seller Group, or any of the Selling Entities, or for which any member of the
Seller Group or any of the Selling Entities may otherwise be liable,
regardless of the Tax period to which such Taxes relate; (B) Taxes imposed on
any Company Group Member, or for which any Company Group Member may otherwise
be liable under Requirements of Law, for any Pre-Closing Tax Period and for
any Pre-Closing Straddle Period (determined in accordance with _Section
8.1(a)(iii)_); (C) Taxes resulting from or incurred in connection with
the Reorganization or (subject to _Section 8.1(a)(iv))_ the transfer of the
Contributed Assets pursuant to _Section 2.2(a)_; (D) Taxes of any member of
any Consolidated Tax Group of which any Company Group Member (or
any predecessor of any Company Group Member) was a member on or prior to the
Closing Date by reason of Treasury Regulation § 1.1502-6(a) or any analogous
or similar provision of foreign, state or local law, and Taxes imposed on any
Company Group Member under the intercompany transaction rules of Treasury
Regulation § 1.1502-13 (or any analogous or similar provision of foreign,
state or local law) upon ceasing to be a member of such a Consolidated Tax
Group; (E) Taxes of any other Person for which a Company Group Member is or
has been liable under Requirements of Law for any Pre-Closing Tax Period and
for any Pre-Closing Straddle Period (determined in accordance with  _Section
8.1(a)(iii)_) as a transferee or successor; (F) Taxes levied or assessed
against, or payable with respect to, the Contributed Assets for any Pre-
Closing Tax Period or for any Pre-Closing Straddle Period (determined

Closing Tax Period and for any Pre-Closing Straddle Period (determined in
accordance with _Section 8.1(a)(iii)_) under any written agreement or
contract in effect as of the Closing Date, but excluding any agreement or
contract entered into by the Company Group Member or any Affiliate thereof in
the Ordinary Course of Business which does not pertain primarily to Taxes;
_provided_ , _however_ , the term "Seller Taxes" shall not include (I) the
amount of any Taxes reflected as a liability and included in the final
calculation of Closing Date Working Capital, (II) Taxes imposed on any Company
Group Member as a result of transactions that occur on the Closing Date with
respect to such Company Group Member that are properly allocable (based on
factors set forth in Treasury Regulation Section 1.1502-76(b)(1)(ii)(B)) to
the portion of the Closing Date after the Closing, it

 



56  being understood that this clause (II) should be interpreted in a manner
consistent with the determination of Closing Date Working Capital as of the
Measurement Time, (III) Taxes that result from the transactions contemplated
by this Agreement being treated for Tax purposes as a purchase or sale of
assets of any member of the Company Group (other than West Business Solutions,
LLC and West Contact Services Mexico) as a result of any Tax election made or
caused to be made by Buyer, or any action not contemplated by this Agreement
taken or caused to be taken by Buyer after the Closing, or (IV) Transfer Taxes
allocated to and payable by Buyer pursuant to  _Section 8.1(a)(iv)_, (Taxes
described in this proviso, hereinafter the " _Excluded Taxes_ "). To the
extent permitted by Requirements of Law, Buyer and Seller agree that, with
respect to any transaction described in clause (II) of the preceding
sentence, each Company Group Member and all persons related to such member
under Section 267(b) of the Code immediately after the Closing shall treat
such transaction for federal Income Tax purposes (in accordance with Treasury
Regulation Section 1.1502-76(b)(1)(ii)(B)) and, to the extent permitted, for
other Tax purposes, as occurring at the beginning of the day following the
Closing Date.

 

(ii) Buyer shall be liable for and pay, and pursuant to _Article XI_ (and
subject to the limitations thereof) shall indemnify and hold harmless each
Seller Group Member from and against (collectively, " _Buyer Taxes_ "), (A)
all Taxes imposed on any Company Group Member, or for which any Company Group
Member may otherwise be liable under Requirements of Law, attributable to
taxable years or periods beginning after the Closing Date and, with respect to
any Straddle Period, the portion of such Straddle Period beginning immediately
after the Closing Date and (B) Excluded Taxes;  _provided_ , _however_ ,
Buyer shall not be liable for, and shall have no obligation to pay, (i) any
Seller Tax, or (ii) any Tax for which Seller is responsible or obligated to
pay pursuant to this _Section 8.1_ or  _Article XI_.

(iii) For purposes of _paragraph (a)(i)_ and _(a)(ii)_ of this _Section
8.1_, any Straddle Period shall be treated on a "closing of the books" basis
as two partial periods, one ending at the close of the Closing Date and the
other beginning immediately after the Closing Date, _provided_ , _however_ ,
that (I) transactions occurring on the Closing Date that are properly
allocable (based on factors similar to those set forth in Treasury Regulation
Section 1.1502-76(b)(1)(ii)(B)) to the portion of the Closing Date after the
Closing shall be allocated to the taxable year or period that is deemed to
begin immediately after the Closing Date, it being understood that this clause
(I) should be interpreted in a manner consistent with the determination of
Closing Date Working Capital as of the Measurement Time, and (II) exemptions,
allowances or deductions that are calculated on a periodic basis (such as
property Taxes and depreciation deductions) and any Tax allowances or
incentives (including graduated Tax rates) applicable to a Company Group
Member organized outside the U.S. shall be apportioned between such two
taxable years or periods on a daily basis.

 



57 (iv) Notwithstanding _paragraphs (a)(i)_ and _(a)(ii)_ of this  _Section
8.1_, any sales Tax, use Tax, real property transfer Tax, asset transfer Tax,
documentary stamp Tax, or similar Tax (each, a " _Transfer Tax_ ") imposed on
the transactions effected pursuant to this Agreement shall be paid fifty
percent (50%) by Buyer and fifty percent (50%) by Seller when due. Buyer, on
the one hand, and Seller, on the other hand, agree to timely sign and deliver
such certificates or forms as may be necessary or appropriate to establish an
exemption from (or otherwise reduce), or file Tax Returns with respect to,
such Taxes (including resale certificates from Buyer to Seller with respect to
inventory).

 

(v) If, as a result of any action, suit, investigation, audit, claim,
assessment or amended Tax Return that results in an increase in a Tax
liability for which Seller would otherwise be liable pursuant to _paragraph
(a)(i)_ of this _Section 8.1_, there is any change in an item of income,
gain, loss, deduction, credit or amount of Tax and such change results or is
reasonably expected to result in an allowable decrease in the amount of Taxes
due and payable by any Company Group Member, Buyer or any Affiliate or
successor of any thereof with respect to any of the two (2) taxable years
or periods beginning after the Closing Date or for the portion of any
Straddle Period beginning after the Closing Date, Seller shall not be liable
pursuant to such _paragraph (a)(i)_ with respect to such increase to the
extent of the present value (using a discount rate equal to the then "
_Federal mid-term rate_ ," as that term is defined in Section 1274(d) of the
Code) of such decrease (and, to the extent such increase in Tax liability is
paid to a Governmental Body by Seller or any Affiliate thereof, Buyer shall
pay Seller an amount equal to the present value of such decrease). Buyer
shall, and shall cause its Affiliates to, use commercially reasonable efforts
to realize all such allowable material decreases in Tax liability, including
through the filing of amended Tax Returns; _provided_ , _however_ , Seller
shall pay Buyer, within five (5) days of demand, all reasonable third party
costs and expenses (including reasonable attorney fees) incurred or payable
by Buyer or any of its Affiliates (including any Company Group Member) in
connection with its efforts to realize such decreases in Tax liability, and
_provided_ , _further_ , that none of Buyer or its Affiliates shall
be required to institute or engage in legal or administrative proceedings to
realize any such decreases in Tax liability. Buyer shall inform Seller shortly
after the end of each calendar year as to whether, to the Knowledge of Buyer,
any material decrease is, or with the taking of commercially reasonable
action would be, available.

(vi) Subject to the following sentence, but otherwise notwithstanding
anything to the contrary herein, Seller and Buyer agree that Seller makes no
representation or warranty, and provides no other assurance, with respect to
the amount or availability of any Tax Attributes of any Company Group Member
with respect to any taxable year or periods beginning after the Closing Date
and, with respect to any Straddle Period, the portion of such Straddle Period
beginning immediately after the Closing Date. Notwithstanding the foregoing,
Seller shall make a timely and valid election pursuant to Treasury Regulation
Sections 1.1502-36(d)(6)(i)(A) and 1.1502-36(e)(5)(viii) to reduce the basis
of the

 



58  relevant Company Group Member to the extent necessary to prevent any
attribute reduction amount pursuant to Treasury Regulation Section
1.1502-36(d)(3) associated with the transactions effected by the Seller.
Seller shall not make an election pursuant to Treasury Regulation Sections
1.1502-36(d)(6)(i)(B) or (C) to reattribute any Company Group Members Tax
Attributes to Seller, without the prior written consent of Buyer, which may
be withheld in Buyers sole discretion.

(vii) To the extent permitted by Requirements of Law, any Tax benefits
arising from or attributable to wages or other similar amounts paid or accrued
by any Company Group Member on or prior to the Closing Date (including, but
not limited to, the work opportunity credit under the Code, the Indian
employment credit under the Code, the empowerment zone employment credit
under the Code, the renewal community employment credit under the Code, the
enterprise zone credit under the Code, any similar or related provision of
federal, state or local law, or any successor to any of the foregoing
provisions, whether under existing legislation or pursuant to post-Closing
legislation applicable to wages or other similar amounts paid or accrued
during the pre-Closing period) shall be treated as arising in, and shall be
allocated to a Pre-Closing Tax Period or, with respect to any Straddle Period,
the portion of such Straddle Period ending on the Closing Date. To the extent
permitted by Requirements of Law, the parties shall report consistently with
the preceding sentence for all Tax purposes, and shall not take any
inconsistent position in any Tax proceeding; _provided_ , _however_ , neither
Buyer nor Seller (nor any of their Affiliates) shall be required to litigate
before any court, or contest before any administrative agency, any proposed
deficiency or adjustment by any Governmental Body challenging such deductions.
If such Tax benefits cannot be allocated to any such Pre-Closing Tax Period
under applicable law, Seller shall be entitled to any Tax refunds (or
reductions in Tax liability) attributable to any such Tax benefits to the
extent actually realized by a reduction in Taxes otherwise due and payable by
Buyer, any Company Group Member, or any Affiliate of the foregoing Persons
with respect to each of the two (2) taxable years or periods beginning after
the Closing Date or the portion of any Straddle Period beginning after the
Closing Date, but only to the extent the amount of such Tax refunds
or reductions in Tax liability exceed all reasonable third party costs and
expenses (including reasonable attorney fees) incurred by Buyer and its
Affiliates in obtaining such Tax refunds or reductions in Tax liability. Buyer
shall forward or reimburse to Seller any such Tax refunds received or
reductions utilized within ten (10) days after receipt or entitlement thereto.

 

(b) _Tax Returns_.

 

(i) Seller shall file or cause to be filed when due (taking into account all
extensions properly obtained) (A) all Income Tax Returns that are required to
be filed by or with respect to any Company Group Member for taxable years or
periods ending on or before the Closing Date (other than such Income Tax
Returns required to be filed by any Company Group Member organized outside
the United States, which shall be filed by Buyer) and (B) all other Tax

 



59  Returns that are required to be filed by or with respect to any Company
Group Member (taking into account all extensions properly obtained) on or
prior to the Closing Date. Seller shall timely remit or cause to be timely
remitted, in full, any Taxes due in respect of such Tax Returns. Except as
required by Requirements of Law or to reflect changes in fact, or except as
otherwise provided herein, all Tax Returns that Seller is required to file or
cause to be filed in accordance with this paragraph (b)(i) shall be prepared
and filed in a manner consistent with past practice and, on such Tax Returns,
no position shall be taken, election made or method adopted that is
inconsistent with positions taken, elections made or methods used in
preparing and filing similar Tax Returns in prior periods unless failure to do
so would not have the effect of increasing by more than $50,000 in the
aggregate the Tax liability of Buyer and its Affiliates (including the
Company Group Members) for any taxable period beginning after the Closing Date
or the portion of any Straddle Period beginning immediately following the
Closing Date.

 

(A) With respect to any Tax Return to be filed by Seller after the Closing
Date pursuant to _Section 8.1(b)(i)_ that is not required to be signed by a
Company Group Member prior to filing, Seller shall provide Buyer with a copy
of such Tax Return (or the portion thereof reflecting Tax information of the
relevant Company Group Member) as promptly as practicable following the
preparation thereof (it being understood that if necessary such copies shall
be provided after filing). Buyer shall review such Tax Returns within 30 days
after the delivery of such Tax Returns. Buyer will be deemed to have
approved such Tax Returns as prepared by Seller if it does not submit
comments within such 30 day review period. If Buyer delivers comments
(including proposed revisions) to Seller within such review period, Buyer and
Seller shall negotiate in good faith and use commercially reasonable efforts
to resolve any dispute in connection with such comments, but only if and to
the extent the comments delivered by Buyer pursuant to this _Section
8.1(b)(i)(A)_ pertain to (i) Tax positions taken, elections made or methods
used with respect to such Tax Returns that Buyer believes (A) are inconsistent
with positions taken, elections made or methods used in preparing and filing
similar Tax Returns in prior periods and such inconsistency is not required
by Requirements of Law or to reflect changes in fact, and (B) could reasonably
be expected to have the effect of increasing by more than $50,000 in the
aggregate the Tax liability of Buyer and its Affiliates (including the
Company Group Members) for any taxable period beginning after the Closing
Date and the portion of any Straddle Period beginning immediately following
the Closing Date, or (ii) the allocation of items of income, gain, loss,
deduction, or credit with respect to the Closing Date (including the
allocation of items pursuant to Treasury Regulation Section 1.1502-76(b) or
any comparable or similar provision of federal, state or foreign law). In the
event Buyer and 

 



60  Seller are unable to resolve any such dispute with respect to the matters
specified above within 10 days after Buyer provides its comments, Buyer and
Seller shall resolve the items disputed by Buyer pursuant to this _Section
8.1(b)(i)(A)_ in accordance with _Section 8.1(b)(iii)_.

(B) With respect to any Tax Return to be filed by Seller after the Closing
Date pursuant to _Section 8.1(b)(i)_ that is required to be signed by a
Company Group Member prior to filing, not less than 60 days prior to the due
date for filing of each such Tax Return, taking into account extensions (or,
if such due date is within 120 days following the Closing Date, as promptly as
practicable following the Closing Date), Seller shall provide Buyer with a
draft copy of such Tax Returns (or the portion thereof reflecting Tax
information of the relevant Company Group Member) for Buyers review and
approval. Buyer shall review such Tax Returns within 30 days after the
delivery of such Tax Returns. Buyer will be deemed to have approved such Tax
Returns as prepared by Seller if it does not submit comments within such 30
day review period. If Buyer delivers comments (including proposed revisions)
to Seller within such review period, Buyer and Seller shall negotiate in good
faith and use commercially reasonable efforts to resolve any dispute in
connection with such comments, but only if and to the extent the comments
delivered by Buyer pursuant to this _Section 8.1(b)(i)(B)_ pertain to (i) Tax
positions taken, elections made or methods used with respect to such Tax
Returns that Buyer believes (A) are inconsistent with positions taken,
elections made or methods used in preparing and filing similar Tax Returns in
prior periods and such inconsistency is not required by Requirements of Law
or to reflect changes in fact, and (B) could reasonably be expected to have
the effect of increasing by more than $50,000 in the aggregate the Tax
liability of Buyer and its Affiliates (including the Company Group Members)
for any taxable period beginning after the Closing Date and the portion of any
Straddle Period beginning immediately following the Closing Date, (ii) the
allocation of items of income, gain, loss, deduction, or credit with respect
to the Closing Date (including the allocation of items pursuant to Treasury
Regulation Section 1.1502-76(b) or any comparable or similar provision of
federal, state or foreign law), or (iii) whether there is a
"reasonable basis" (as defined in Treasury Regulation Section 1.6662-3(b)(3)
or any comparable or similar provision of state or foreign law) for any
position taken on such Tax Returns. In the event Buyer and Seller are unable
to resolve any such dispute with respect to the matters specified above
within 10 days after Buyer provides its comments, Buyer and Seller shall
resolve the items disputed by Buyer pursuant to this _Section 8.1(b)(i)(B)_
in accordance with  _Section 8.1(b)(iii)_.

 



61 (ii) Buyer shall file or cause to be filed when due (taking into account
all extensions properly obtained) (A) all Income Tax Returns that are
required to be filed by or with respect to any Company Group Member for
taxable years or periods ending after the Closing Date and (B) all other Tax
Returns that are required to be filed after the Closing Date. Subject to
Sellers obligation to pay Seller Taxes in accordance with this Agreement, and
further subject to Buyers rights to indemnification hereunder, Buyer shall
timely remit or cause to be timely remitted, in full, any Taxes due in
respect of such Tax Returns. Except as required by Requirements of Law or to
reflect changes in fact, or except as otherwise provided herein, all Tax
Returns that Buyer is required to file or cause to be filed in accordance
with this paragraph (b) that relate to any Pre-Closing Tax Period or any
Straddle Period shall be prepared and filed in a manner consistent with past
practice and, on such Tax Returns, no position shall be taken, election made
or method adopted that is inconsistent with positions taken, elections made or
methods used in preparing and filing similar Tax Returns in the immediately
prior period unless failure to do so would not have the effect of increasing
by more than $50,000 in the aggregate the Tax liability of Seller and its
Affiliates (including the Company Group Members) with respect to such taxable
periods. Not less than 60 days prior to the due date for filing of each such
Tax Return, taking into account extensions (or, if such due date is within
120 days following the Closing Date, as promptly as practicable following the
Closing Date), Buyer shall provide Seller with a draft copy of such Tax
Returns (or the portion thereof reflecting Tax information of the relevant
Company Group Member) for Sellers review and approval prior to the filing
thereof. Seller shall review such Tax Returns within 30 days after the
delivery of such Tax Returns. Seller will be deemed to have approved such Tax
Returns as prepared by Buyer if it does not submit comments within such 30 day
review period. If Seller delivers comments (including proposed revisions) to
Buyer within such review period, Buyer and Seller shall negotiate in good
faith and use commercially reasonable efforts to resolve any dispute in
connection with such comments (which, for the avoidance of doubt, shall not be
subject to the limitations set forth in _Section 8.1(b)(i)(A)_ or _(B)_ ). In
the event Buyer and Seller are unable to agree on any such revisions within
10 days after Seller provides its comments, Buyer and Seller shall resolve the
items disputed by Seller pursuant to this _Section 8.1(b)(ii)_ in accordance
with  _Section 8.1(b)(iii)_.

(iii) In the event Buyer (pursuant to, and subject to the limitations of, 
_Section 8.1(b)(i)_) or Seller (pursuant to _Section 8.1(b)(ii)_) delivers
comments to the other Party within the relevant 30 day review period and the
Parties are unable to resolve the disputed items within 10 days
thereafter, Seller and Buyer shall engage the Accounting Firm to resolve the
matter, and the Accounting Firms determination shall be final and binding on
the Parties. The Accounting Firm shall resolve the dispute in accordance with
the terms of this  _Section 8.1_ within 10 days after the item has been
referred to it. Notwithstanding

 



62  anything to the contrary in this _Section 8.1(b)_, the Seller (with respect
to a Tax Return prepared pursuant to _Section 8.1(b)(i)_) or the Buyer (with
respect to a Tax Return prepared pursuant to _Section 8.1(b)(ii)_) shall be
entitled to file or cause to be filed the applicable Tax Return on behalf of a
Company Group Member without having incorporated the disagreed upon changes to
avoid a late filing of such Tax Return. If the Accounting Firms resolution
of the dispute necessitates that a Tax Return filed in accordance with the
previous sentence be amended, then Seller (with respect to a Tax Return
prepared pursuant to  _Section 8.1(b)(i)_) or the Buyer (with respect to a
Tax Return prepared pursuant to _Section 8.1(b)(ii)_) shall cause an amended
Tax Return to be filed that reflects such resolution. The fees and expenses of
the Accounting Firm shall be borne by each Party in the percentage inversely
proportionate to the percentage of the total items submitted for dispute that
are resolved in such Partys favor. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary
herein, nothing in this  _Section 8.1(b)_ shall prohibit Buyer, Seller, or
any of their Affiliates (including the Company Group Members) from filing Tax
Returns at the time required by law (taking into account any available
extensions).

 

(iv) Except as required by Requirements of Law, none of Buyer or any Affiliate
of Buyer shall (or shall cause or permit any Company Group Member to) amend,
refile or otherwise modify (or grant an extension of any statute of
limitations or reassessment period with respect to) any Tax Return relating in
whole or in part to any Company Group Member with respect to any Pre-Closing
Tax Period or any Straddle Period without the prior written consent of Seller
(not to be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed).

 

(v) Buyer shall use commercially reasonable efforts to prepare and provide to
Seller (or cause to be prepared and provided to Seller) a package of Tax
information materials, including, without limitation, schedules and work
papers (the " _Tax Package_ ") required by Seller to enable Seller to prepare
and file all Tax Returns required to be prepared and filed by it pursuant to
_paragraph (b)(i)_ of this _Section 8.1_. The Tax Package shall be completed
in accordance with past practice, including past practice as to providing such
information and as to the method of computation of separate taxable income or
other relevant measure of income of the Company. Buyer shall use commercially
reasonable efforts to cause the Tax Package to be delivered to Seller within
30 days after Seller requests delivery of the Tax Package. Seller shall pay
all reasonable third-party costs and expenses incurred by Buyer and its
Affiliates, including each Company Group Member, in preparing such Tax
Package.

 

(vi) Except to the extent reflected as an asset and included in the final
calculation of Closing Date Working Capital, Seller shall be entitled to any
refund of (or credit for) Taxes allocable to any Pre-Closing Tax Period and,
with respect to any Straddle Period, the Pre-Closing Straddle Period
(determined in accordance with _Section 8.1(a)(iii))_. Buyer shall, and
shall cause its Affiliates, to take such steps as may be commercially
reasonable and requested in writing by Seller to secure any such refund or
credit, including through the filing of amended Tax Returns; _provided_ ,
_however_ , except as provided on _Schedule 8.1(b)_, neither

 



63  Buyer nor any of its Affiliates (and no Company Group Member) shall be
required to institute or engage in legal or administrative proceedings to
secure such Tax refund. Seller shall pay Buyer, within five (5) days of
demand, all reasonable third party costs and expenses (including reasonable
attorney fees) incurred or payable by Buyer or any of its Affiliates
(including any Company Group Member) in connection with its efforts to secure
such refunds or credits. Buyer shall promptly pay any such Tax refund, net of
all fees and expenses not yet reimbursed by Seller, and net of all Taxes
incurred by Buyer or its Affiliates, in connection therewith. In the event any
Governmental Body subsequently disallows all or any portion of such Tax
Refund with respect to which Buyer has made a payment to Seller, Seller shall
promptly pay Buyer the portion of such Tax refund which was disallowed,
together with any penalties, interests or costs incurred in connection with
such disallowance. Buyer shall inform Seller shortly after the end of each
calendar year as to whether, to the Knowledge of Buyer, any material refund or
credit is, or with the taking of commercially reasonable action would be,
available.

(c) _Contest Provisions_. Each of Seller and Buyer shall promptly notify the
other Party in writing upon receipt (including receipt by Affiliates of
Seller or Buyer) of any written notice of any pending or threatened federal,
state, local or foreign Tax audits, examinations or assessments or
administrative or court proceeding that pertains to or is reasonably expected
to affect a Company Group Member with respect to any Pre-Closing Tax Period or
any Straddle Period. With respect to such proceeding that pertain to a Pre-
Closing Tax Period, Seller shall have the sole right to control any such Tax
audit, examination, assessment or proceeding, and to employ counsel of its
choice at its expense; _provided_ , _however_ , that Buyer and its
representatives shall be permitted, at Buyers expense, to be present at, and
participate in, any such audit, examination, assessment or proceeding (except
to the extent such audit, examination, assessment or proceeding pertains to a
Tax Return of a Consolidated Tax Group or to the Tax information of any Seller
Group Member. With respect to such proceeding that pertain to a Straddle
Period, Buyer shall have the sole right to control any such Tax audit,
examination, assessment or proceeding, and to employ counsel of its choice at
its expense; _provided_ ,  _however_ , that Seller and its representatives
shall be permitted, at Sellers expense, to be present at, and participate in,
any such audit, examination, assessment or proceeding (except to the extent
such audit, examination, assessment or proceeding pertains to a Tax Return of
a Consolidated Tax Group or to the Tax information of Buyer or an Affiliate of
Buyer other than a Company Group Member). Neither Seller nor any Affiliate of
Seller (with respect to a proceeding involving a Pre-Closing Tax Period), and
neither Buyer nor any Affiliate of Buyer (with respect to a proceeding
involving a Straddle Period) shall be entitled to settle, either
administratively or after the commencement of litigation, any claim for Taxes
which could reasonably be expected to adversely affect the liability for
Taxes for which the other party may be liable under this Agreement without the
prior written consent of the other party (which shall not be unreasonably
delayed, conditioned or withheld); _provided_ , _however_ , each of Seller
and Buyer shall be permitted to settle any claim for Taxes to the extent such
claim relates solely to, with respect to Seller, a Seller Group Member, and
with respect to Buyer, either Buyer or an Affiliate of Buyer other than a
Company Group Member.

 



64 (d) _Assistance and Cooperation_. After the Closing Date, each of Seller
and Buyer shall (and cause their respective Affiliates to): (i) timely sign
and deliver such certificates or forms as may be necessary or appropriate to
establish an exemption from (or otherwise reduce), or file Tax Returns or
other reports with respect to, Taxes described in _paragraph (a)(iii)_ of
this _Section 8.1_ (relating to sales, transfer and similar Taxes); (ii)
assist the other party in preparing any Tax Returns which such other party is
responsible for preparing and filing in accordance with _paragraph (b)_ of
this _Section 8.1_; (iii) cooperate fully in preparing for any audits of, or
disputes with taxing authorities regarding, any Tax Returns relating to the
Companies, the Company Subsidiary or the Contributed Assets; (iv) make
available to the other party and to any taxing authority as reasonably
requested all information, records, and documents relating to Taxes relating
to the Companies, the Company Subsidiary or the Contributed Assets; (v)
provide timely notice to the other in writing of any pending or threatened Tax
audits or assessments relating to the Companies, the Company Subsidiary or the
Contributed Assets for taxable periods for which the other may have a
liability under this _Section 8.1_; (vi) furnish the other with copies of all
correspondence received from any taxing authority in connection with any Tax
audit or information request with respect to any such taxable period; and
(vii) timely provide to the other powers of attorney or similar authorizations
necessary to carry out the purposes of this _Section 8.1_.

 

(e) Prior to or as of the Closing, Seller will cause each Company Group Member
to terminate all written or unwritten agreements or arrangements providing
for the allocation or payment of Tax liabilities or for Tax benefits between
or among any Seller Group Member or other members of any group of corporations
that files, will file, or has filed Tax Returns on a combined, consolidated
or unitary basis (excluding any such agreement or arrangement relating solely
to Company Group Members and excluding, for the avoidance of doubt, this
Agreement), and after the Closing no Company Group Member nor any member of
the Seller Group shall have any liability thereunder.

(f) At least five (5) days prior to Closing, Seller will provide Buyer in
writing a list of all powers of attorney relating to Taxes then in effect with
respect to each Company Group Member. As of the Closing, Seller will cause
each Company Group Member to terminate all such powers of attorney except as
otherwise requested in writing by Buyer.

(g) At Buyers option, Seller shall join in making a valid and timely election
under Code Section 338(h)(10) (and any corresponding elections under state,
local, or non-U.S. tax law) (collectively, a " _Section 338(h)(10) Election_
") with respect to the acquisition and disposition of the stock of West
At Home, LLC or West Direct II, Inc. hereunder. If requested in writing by
Buyer, Seller shall properly complete and duly execute an IRS Form 8023 (and
any corresponding or similar Tax form or statement under state, local or
non-U.S. Tax law that Buyer reasonably requests), deliver a copy of such
executed Tax form or statement to Buyer at least thirty (30) days prior to the
date by which it is required to be filed with the relevant taxing authority,
and timely file such executed Tax form or statement with the appropriate
taxing authority. Prior to Seller joining in making any Section 338(h)(10)
Election, Buyer shall provide compensation to Seller for Taxes imposed
pursuant to such Section 338(h)(10) Election in excess of the Taxes that
would have been imposed without such Section 338(h)(10) Election, together
with an additional amount to compensate Seller for the tax consequences of the
receipt of such amount (including the additional amount), in all cases
as reasonably acceptable to Seller.

 



65 8.2. _Use of Names_. Except as otherwise provided in the West At Home
Transitional Trademark License, for a period of 45 days after the Closing
Date, Buyer and its Affiliates shall have, and Seller on behalf of itself and
the other Selling Group Members hereby grants Buyer and its Affiliates, a non-
exclusive, non-transferable, fully paid royalty-free right to refer to the
Business as "formerly West Contact Services, Inc.", "formerly West Asset
Management, Inc.", "formerly West Contact Services Mexico, S. de R.L. de
C.V.", "formerly West Direct II, Inc.", "formerly West Direct, LLC" or
"formerly West Business Solutions" (collectively, the " _Marks_ ") and to use
such reference in advertising or in the description or name of any service
from time to time provided by Buyer and its Affiliates in continuation of the
Business. Notwithstanding the foregoing, Buyer shall, and shall cause each
Company Group Member to, use commercially reasonable efforts to change all
references to the Marks used by the Company Group as soon as practicable
following the Closing Date, and shall make clear in all correspondence and
communications made by Buyer, the Company Group and the Business that the
members of the Company Group are no longer owned by Seller or its
Subsidiaries. Buyer agrees that, as promptly as practicable, and in any event
within five (5) Business Days following the Closing, it shall amend the
organizational documents of each Company Group Member whose name includes one
of the Marks to a name which does not include any of the Marks. Other than as
provided in the preceding three sentences, Seller is not granting Buyer or the
Company Group or any of their Affiliates a license to use any of Sellers
existing trade names or trademarks (including "West Corporation"), and after
the Closing, Buyer shall not permit the Company Group or any Affiliate of the
Company Group to use in any manner any names or marks of Seller or any of
Sellers Affiliates or any names or marks which are confusingly similar to
any names or marks of Seller or any Affiliate of Seller, _provided_ that the
foregoing shall not apply to Transferred Trademarks. Buyer acknowledges that
Seller and its Affiliates would be irreparably harmed by any breach of this
_Section 8.2_ and that any relief under _Article XI_ will be inadequate to
compensate Seller or such Affiliates for any such breach. Accordingly, Buyer
agrees that, in addition to any relief available under _Article XI_, Seller
and its Affiliates shall be entitled, without the necessity of proving actual
damages or posting any bond, to injunctive relief against Buyer and any
involved Affiliates of Buyer in the event of any breach or threatened breach
by Buyer (or its Affiliates) of its covenants and agreements in this _Section
8.2_, and Buyer (on behalf of itself and its Affiliates) consents to the entry
thereof if granted.

 

8.3. _Compensation and Employee Benefit Plan Matters_.

 

(a) Subject to the terms of this Agreement and applicable Requirements of Law,
Seller shall, and shall cause its Subsidiaries (as applicable) to, take such
actions as may be reasonably necessary to assign and transfer the employment
of any Business Employees not employed by a Company Group Member as of the
date hereof, to one or more members of the Company Group, with
such assignments and transfers of employment to be effective no later than
the Closing Date (it being understood and agreed that any employees may
terminate their employment at any time and their election to do so shall not
constitute a breach of this Agreement by Seller). The assignment and transfer
of the employment of any Business Employee as described herein shall be deemed
not to be a layoff, severance, position

 



66  elimination or other termination of the employment of such Business Employee
for the purposes of any policy, practice, employee benefit plan or other
arrangement of the Seller Group or the Company Group or otherwise. The
Company Group shall, and Buyer shall cause the Company Group to, (i)
automatically continue the employment of all Business Employees employed by
the Company Group as of the Closing Date, and such Business Employees shall
not be employed (or considered to be employed) by any member of the Seller
Group as of the Closing Date, and (ii) comply with the collective bargaining
agreement applicable to West Contact Services Mexico.

 

(b) Buyer and Seller shall jointly give notice to all Business Employees no
later than the Closing Date that the active participation of Business
Employees in the Company Plans shall terminate on the Closing Date, as of
which date the Business Employees shall be eligible to participate in the
employee benefit plans of Buyer pursuant to the terms and conditions
of Buyers employee benefit plans. In no event shall any employee of the
Companies be entitled to accrue any benefits under the Company Plans with
respect to services rendered or compensation paid after the Closing Date.

 

(c) Except as otherwise provided in this _Section 8.3_, Seller shall retain
the responsibility for payment of all covered medical, dental, vision, life
insurance, long-term disability or other welfare benefit claims, in each case,
incurred by Business Employees prior to the Closing Date (including with
respect to long-term disability claims arising from events occurring before
the Closing Date to the extent covered under Sellers long-term disability
insurance). Buyer shall remit to Seller all Business Employee premiums due for
all Company Plans for coverage attributable to periods prior to the Closing
Date to the extent Buyer collects the same after Closing. All benefit Plans
and programs established or maintained by Buyer in which the Business
Employees participate shall recognize employment with the Asset Contributors
or Companies (or their respective predecessors) for purposes of eligibility,
vesting and level of vacation, severance and other benefits to the same extent
as recognized by the Selling Entities and their Affiliates and the Company
Plans. Any pre-existing condition clause in any of the medical and vision
plans included in Buyers Plans and other employee benefits (collectively, the
" _Buyer s Benefit Programs_") shall be waived for those Business Employees
who elect to enroll in such medical and/or vision plans within the enrollment
period offered to such Business Employees following Closing. Any pre-existing
condition clause in the short-term disability plan included in Buyers
Benefits Programs Plans shall be waived for any Business Employee who is
enrolled in a short-term disability plan that is a Company Plan immediately
prior to Closing and who elects to enroll in such short-term disability plan
included in Buyers Benefit Programs within the enrollment period offered to
such Business Employee following Closing. Any Business Employee who is
enrolled in a dental plan or long-term disability plan that is a Company Plan
immediately prior to Closing will be credited under the comparable Buyer
Benefit Program (if such Business Employee elects to join any such program)
for time of enrollment under such Company Plan. As long as Seller provides
Buyer with the applicable deductible and/or out of pocket maximum information,
Buyer shall credit Business Employees with any amounts paid under the Company
Plans prior to the Closing Date toward satisfaction of applicable deductibles
or out of pocket maximums under the corresponding Buyers Benefits Programs.

 



67 (d) Buyer shall cause the Company Group to provide, recognize and credit
each Business Employee employed by a Company Group Member as of the Closing
Date with such Business Employees accrued but unused vacation time as of the
Closing Date, as determined pursuant to Sellers policy in effect immediately
prior to the Closing Date.

(e) Buyer shall establish, for the calendar year in which the Closing Date
occurs, flexible spending accounts for medical and dependent care expenses
under a new or existing plan established or maintained under Section 125 and
Section 129 of the Code (" _Buyer s FSA_"), effective as of the Closing Date,
for each Business Employee who, on or prior to such date, is a participant
in, and maintains a flexible spending account for medical or dependent care
expenses under, a Company Plan pursuant to Section 125 and Section 129 of the
Code (" _Seller s FSA_"). As of the Closing Date, Buyer shall credit the
applicable account of each such Business Employee under Buyers FSA with an
amount equal to the balance of such Business Employees account
under Sellers FSA immediately prior to such date. Buyer and Seller intend
that the actions to be taken pursuant to this _Section 8.3(e)_ be treated as
an assumption by Buyer of the portion of Sellers FSA and the elections
made thereunder attributable to such Business Employees. As soon as
reasonably practicable after the Closing Date, Seller shall determine the
Aggregate Balance (as defined below) of the assumed flexible spending accounts
and notify Buyer of the amount of such Aggregate Balance in writing. For
purposes of this _Section 8.3(e)_, the term " _Aggregate Balance_ " shall
mean, as of the Closing Date, the aggregate amount of contributions that have
been made to the Business Employees flexible spending accounts under
Sellers FSA by Business Employees for the plan year in which the Closing Date
occurs minus the aggregate amount of reimbursements that have been made from
the Business Employees flexible spending accounts under Sellers FSA to
Business Employees for the plan year in which the Closing Date occurs. If the
Aggregate Balance is a negative amount, Buyer shall pay such negative amount
to Seller as soon as practicable following Buyers receipt of the written
notice thereof. If the Aggregate Balance is a positive amount, Seller shall
pay such positive amount to Buyer as soon as practicable following Sellers
delivery to Buyer of the written notice thereof. If the Aggregate Balance is
zero, neither Seller nor Buyer shall owe any amount to the other.

(f) Buyer shall be responsible for providing the continuation of group health
coverage required by Section 4980B(f) of the Code to the extent required by
Requirements of Law to any Business Employee (and such persons "qualified
beneficiaries" within the meaning of Section 4980B(f) of the Code) who has a
"qualifying event," within the meaning of Section 4980B(f) of the Code on or
after the Closing Date.

 

(g) For a period commencing on the Closing Date and ending no earlier than
December 31, 2015, Buyer (or an Affiliate of Buyer) shall take any and all
action necessary such that each Staff Business Employee shall continue to
receive, with respect to his or her employment with Buyer, the Company Group
or their Affiliates, (i) base wages or salary and incentive compensation
opportunities that in each case are not less favorable than those in effect
for such Staff Business Employee immediately prior to the Closing and (ii)
other employee benefits that are not less favorable than those of
Buyer applicable to similarly situated employees of Buyer. For the period
beginning on the Closing Date and ending no earlier than December 31, 2015,
Buyer agrees to provide, or cause an Affiliate of Buyer to provide, notice of
termination or pay in lieu thereof and severance pay, if applicable, to each

 



68  Staff Business Employee that is no less favorable than would be provided
under (x) the applicable agreements, policies and practices of Seller, the
Companies or the Company Subsidiary, as applicable, in effect immediately
prior to the Closing Date, or (y) the policies and practices of Buyer
applicable to similarly situated employees of Buyer, whichever is more
favorable for such Staff Business Employee. Buyer and the Company Group shall
be solely responsible for all liability for severance pay and obligations
payable or otherwise due (including, without limitation, under WARN and any
similar national, state or local Requirements of Law) to any Business Employee
who is terminated by Buyer or any Company Group Member on or after the
Closing Date.

(h) With respect to the Business Employees, Buyer and the Company Group shall
assume and shall have the liability and obligation for, and neither Seller nor
any of its Affiliates shall have any liability or obligation for: (i) short-
term disability and sick pay or salary continuation benefits payable on or
after the Closing Date, (ii) any medical, dental, vision, life insurance,
long-term disability or other welfare benefit claims, in each case, incurred
on or after the Closing Date (except with respect to long-term disability
claims arising from events occurring before the Closing Date to the extent
covered under Sellers long-term disability insurance) and (iii) the
individual agreements with the Business Employees set forth in
_Schedule 8.3(h)_.

(i) Buyer and the Company Group shall be liable for any workers compensation
or similar workers protection claims of any Business Employee incurred with
respect to which the date of injury (or all dates of injury, if applicable)
occurred on or after the Closing Date.

 

(j) Except to the extent otherwise specifically set forth in this _Section
8.3_, Seller (or its applicable Affiliate) shall retain all liabilities
relating to all Company Plans accrued as of the Closing Date, including all
applicable pension obligations and post-retirement healthcare obligations
which accrued under such Company Plans as of the Closing Date.

 

(k) Regardless of anything else contained herein, the Parties do not intend
for this Agreement to, and this Agreement shall not, amend any Plans or
arrangements or create any rights or obligations except between the Parties.
No Business Employee or other current or former employee of any Company Group
Member including any beneficiary or dependent thereof, or any other person
not a party to this Agreement, shall be entitled to assert any claim, or
otherwise have any third party beneficiary rights, hereunder. Notwithstanding
anything to the contrary in this Agreement, and without limiting or otherwise
affecting any provision of _Section 8.3(j)_, nothing in this Agreement shall
(i) give any person the right to be employed by Seller, Buyer, the Companies
or any of their respective Affiliates for any period of time, (ii) obligate
Seller, Buyer, the Companies or any of the respective Affiliates to offer any
inducement or other consideration to any Business Employee to become or remain
employed by any Company Group Member, or (iii) prohibit or otherwise limit
Seller, Buyer, the Company Group or any of their respective Affiliates from
accepting the resignation of any Business Employee, terminating the employment
of any Business Employee or, subject to _Section 7.2(b)(v)_, hiring any
person who would become a Business Employee.

 



69 8.4. _Non-Solicitation_.

 

(a) For a period of twenty-four (24) months following the Closing Date,
neither Seller nor any of its Subsidiaries shall, or shall permit any of its
officers, employees or any other Person acting on its or their behalf to,
solicit or attempt to persuade any Buyer Covered Employee to terminate such
employment to become an employee of Seller or any of its Subsidiaries; 
_provided_ , _however_ , that it is understood that this provision shall not
prohibit: (i) generalized solicitations by advertising and the like which are
not directed to specific individuals or Buyer Covered Employees; (ii)

acting on its or their behalf to, solicit any Current Seller Customer to
terminate its relationship with Seller or its Subsidiaries (other than the
Company Group) as such relationship exists on the Closing Date or enter into a
new relationship with Buyer or any of its Affiliates (including the Company
Group), in each case with respect to any Interactive Solutions, _provided_ ,
_however_ , that it is understood that this provision shall not prohibit
solicitation of any Current Seller Customer that contacts Buyer or any of its

without any solicitation by or encouragement from Buyer or any of its
Subsidiaries.

any of its Affiliates are offered as an integrated service with the services
provided by the third party provider of Restricted Activities. For purposes of
this _Section 8.5(c)_, a service is "incidental" or "ancillary" if such
service involves no more than twenty (20) employees who are engaged in a

(d) In the event that during the Restricted Period, Seller or its Affiliates
request that Buyer or a Company Group Member engage in Restricted Activities
for a customer or prospective customer of Seller and its Affiliates to
facilitate an offering which would include Restricted Activities and Buyer
declines to provide such services on commercially reasonable terms, Seller or
its Affiliates shall be permitted to engage in Restricted Activities for such
customer or prospective customer on substantially the same terms and to
substantially the same extent as such services were requested to be provided

the date immediately preceding such acquisition.

 

8.6. _Substitution of Guaranty_. At or prior to Closing, Buyer shall (i)
obtain letters of credit in replacement of the letters of credit of Seller or

holder of such Guaranty, and (ii) cause Seller or such Affiliate to be fully
released, as of the Closing Date, in respect of all obligations under such
Guaranties. With respect to any other obligations of Seller under any
guaranties, letters of credit, letters of comfort, bid bonds or
performance bonds obtained or given by Seller or any of its Affiliates
relating to the Business which Seller notifies Buyer in writing (the " _Other
Guaranties_ "), Buyer shall use commercially reasonable efforts to cause
Seller or any Affiliate thereof providing an Other Guaranty to be fully
released, in each case, effective as promptly as practicable following
Closing, in respect of all obligations of Seller and any Affiliate under any

release with respect to any Other Guaranty after using commercially reasonable
efforts to do so, Buyer shall indemnify Seller from any Losses arising from
such Other Guaranty, other than Losses arising from the gross negligence or
willful misconduct of any Seller Group Member. Without limiting the foregoing,
after the Closing, Buyer will not, and will not permit any of its Affiliates
to, renew, extend, amend or

 



73  supplement any loan, contract, lease or other obligation that is covered by
an Other Guaranty without providing Seller with evidence satisfactory to
Seller that such Other Guaranty has been released. Any cash or other
collateral posted by Seller or one of its Affiliates and received by any Buyer
Group Member in respect of any Other Guaranty shall be delivered to Seller.

 

8.7. _Intercompany Accounts_. During the period from the date hereof through
the Closing Date, Seller and its Affiliates shall be permitted to manage all
Intercompany Accounts between the Company Group, on the one hand, and Seller
or any of its Affiliates (excluding the Company Group), on the other hand, in
the sole discretion of Seller; _provided_ that Seller shall cause, in a
manner determined by it in its sole discretion, all Intercompany Accounts to
be entirely paid in full or otherwise cancelled effective prior to or as of
the Closing, excluding intercompany liabilities and intercompany
receivables reclassified as trade payables and trade receivables,
respectively, and invoiced following Closing in accordance with the Agreed

as otherwise expressly contemplated in the previous sentence or elsewhere in
this Agreement, Seller shall cause all agreements and commitments, whether
written, oral or otherwise, which are solely between the Company Group, on the
one hand, and Seller or any of its Affiliates (excluding the Company Group),
on the other hand to be terminated and of no further effect, prior to or as of
the Closing.

anticipation of providing services pursuant to the Transition Services
Agreement (including Sellers and its Affiliates actual and/or allocated
internal costs and actual amounts paid to third parties (without premium or
other mark-up) with respect to software, licenses, services, hardware, assets
or other resources used to provide such services), as reasonably determined by
Seller in accordance with past practices. Such costs shall be paid by Buyer
as Seller and its Affiliates incur such costs, promptly upon receipt of an
invoice from Seller and/or its Affiliates to be delivered to Buyer no more
frequently than once a month setting forth in each instance in
reasonable detail the calculation of the applicable costs.

8.9. _Insurance_. From and after the Closing Date, the Company Group and
the Contributed Assets shall cease to be insured by, or have any rights

whatsoever of each

 



74  Company Group Member or any predecessor thereof occurring prior to the
Closing or any operations of any Company Group Member or any of its
predecessors businesses prior to the Closing;  _provided_ , _however_ , that
such claims shall not include claims arising out of, under or pursuant to this
Agreement, any Ancillary Agreement, indemnification rights pursuant to the
Companies certificate of incorporation, bylaws or other governing documents,

predecessors businesses with respect to the Business prior to the Closing;
_provided_ , _however_ , that such claims shall not include claims arising out
of, under or pursuant to this Agreement or any Ancillary Agreement. 

8.11. _Director and Officer Liability and Indemnification_.

 

(a) Buyer shall cause the members of the Company Group to, for a period of six
(6) years after the Closing Date, indemnify and hold harmless, to the fullest
extent permitted under applicable Requirements of Law (and Buyer shall, and
shall cause the Company Group to, advance expenses as incurred to the fullest
extent permitted under applicable Requirements of Law and the organizational
documents of each Company Group Member in respect of), each current or former
officer, director, partner, member, manager or employee of each Company Group
Member (or their respective predecessors) from and against any and all
Losses incurred resulting from matters arising prior to Closing. Buyer agrees
that at all times during such six (6) year period, Buyer shall not, and shall
cause the members of the Company Group not to, amend the provisions of the
organizational documents of the members of the Company Group relating to
indemnification, exculpation and advancement of expenses in a manner that
would adversely affect any such officer, director, partner, member, manager or
employee. In lieu of the foregoing provisions of this _Section 8.11_, Buyer
may, or may cause any Company Group Member to, obtain as of the Closing Date
and maintain "tail" insurance policies with a claims period of six (6) years

Company Group, in each case with respect to claims arising out of or relating
to events which occurred on or prior to the Closing Date (including in
connection with the transactions contemplated by this Agreement).

 

(b) In the event that (i) a sale of Buyer or all or substantially all of its
assets is consummated after the Closing or (ii) this Agreement is otherwise
assigned by Buyer in

 



75  accordance with _Section 13.5_, Buyer shall cause the applicable
acquiror(s), purchaser(s) or assignee(s) to expressly assume the obligations
of Buyer contained in this  _Section 8.11_ and confirm such assumption in a
writing addressed to Seller.

8.12. _Commingled Contracts_.

 

(a) Buyer and Seller acknowledge that members of the Seller Group and the
Company Group are parties to certain contracts (collectively, the "
_Commingled Contracts_ ") that relate in part to both (a) the operations or
conduct of the Business and (b) the operations or conduct of the businesses of
Seller and its Affiliates other than the Business (collectively, the "
_Seller Business_ "), including those Contracts set forth on _Schedule
8.12(a)(i)_. Except as may be otherwise specified on _Schedule 8.12(a)(ii)_ in
respect of specific Commingled Contracts that shall be treated in a different
manner, Buyer and Seller shall cooperate with each other and use their
respective reasonable best efforts to (i) notify the third party that is the
counterparty to each Commingled Contract and, to the extent reasonably within
the contractual or other ability or control of Seller or Buyer or their
respective Affiliates, as the case may be, to cause the applicable Commingled
Contract to be apportioned at the invoice level between the Business and the
Seller Business, pursuant to which the Seller Group will assume all of the
rights and obligations under such Commingled Contract that relate to the
Seller Business, on the one hand, and the Company Group will assume all of the
rights and obligation under such Commingled Contract that relate to the
Business, on the other hand, and (ii) to the extent reasonably within the
contractual or other ability or control of Seller or Buyer or their respective
Affiliates, in the case of the Seller Group, to cause the applicable
counterparty to release the Company Group from the obligations of the Seller
Group arising after the Closing Date under the portion of the Commingled
Contract apportioned to the Seller Group and, in the case of the
Company Group, to cause the applicable counterparty to release the Seller
Group from the obligations of the Company Group arising after the Closing Date
under the portion of the Commingled Contract apportioned to the Company Group.
From and after the date hereof, the parties shall take actions reasonably
necessary to allocate rights and obligations under such Commingled Contracts
in accordance with the foregoing. In no event shall any of the foregoing
arrangement result in Buyer or a member of the Company Group having any
responsibility for any Excluded Liability or in any member of the Seller Group
having any responsibility for any Assumed Liability.

 

(b) For a period beginning on the date hereof and ending thirty (30) days
after the Closing Date, Buyer and Seller will cooperate with each other to
develop a mutually agreeable transition or separation plan with respect to any
vendor agreements that are included among the Commingled Contracts. During
such time period, Seller and Buyer will not take any action, and will cause
their respective Affiliates (including the Company Group Members) to not take
any action, in each case including engaging in any communication, written or
unwritten, with the counterparties to such Contracts, to terminate or
materially decrease or discontinue their use or purchase of goods and
services under such Commingled Contracts with vendors without the written
consent of the other party, such consent not to be unreasonably withheld.
Following such time period, unless otherwise agreed pursuant to the
transition or separation plan referenced above, the parties and their
respective Affiliates (including the Company Group Members) may, in its or
their sole discretion, terminate, or 

 



76  materially decrease or discontinue its or their use or purchase of goods and
services under, any of such Commingled Contracts, other than the Commingled
Contracts set forth on _Schedule 8.12(b)_. With respect to the Commingled
Contracts set forth on _Schedule 8.12(b)_ , any termination, material decrease
or discontinuation under such Commingled Contract prior to the end of the
termination period specified on _Schedule 8.12(b)_ for such Commingled
Contract shall require the prior written consent of the other party;
_provided_ , _however_ , that in the case of those Commingled Contracts with a
termination period that refers to "the full term of the agreement unless
other agreement entered into," nothing contained in this sentence shall
prevent or limit Buyer or any Company Group Member from entering into a new
agreement with the counterparty to such Commingled Contract without the
consent of Seller as long as such new agreement does not result in a
termination of such Commingled Contract as it relates to Seller and does not
increase Sellers obligations under such Commingled Contract after giving
effect to this  _Section 8.12_ and any assignment or contribution of such
Commingled Contract to a Company Group Member pursuant to _Article II_.

 

8.13. _Accounts Payable and Receivable_.

 

(a) From and after the Closing, (i) if the Company Group receives any payment,
refund or other amount that is properly due and owing in respect of the
Seller Business, the Company Group promptly shall remit, or shall cause to be
remitted, such amount to Seller or its designee and (ii) if the Seller Group
receives any payment, refund or other amount that is properly due and owing
to the Business, the Seller Group promptly shall remit, or shall cause to be
remitted, such amount to Buyer or its designee.

 

(b) To the extent the Company Group receives any invoices or statements
evidencing amounts owed to another Person in respect of the Seller Business,
the Company Group shall promptly deliver such documents to Seller or its
designee unless otherwise set forth in the Transition Services Agreement. To
the extent the Seller Group receives any invoices or statements
evidencing amounts owed to another Person in respect of the Business, Seller
shall promptly deliver such documents to Buyer or its designee unless
otherwise set forth in the Transition Services Agreement.

 

(c) Following the Closing, the parties shall cooperate in promptly advising
customers and vendors to direct to the appropriate party any future payments
by such customers and vendors.

8.14. _Litigation Cooperation_. From and after the Closing Date, Buyer
and Seller shall, and shall cause their applicable Affiliates to, provide
such assistance and cooperation as the other party or its counsel may
reasonably request in connection with Proceeding relating to the Business, the
Company Group, the Contributed Assets and the Assumed Liabilities or the
Retained Business, as the case may be, _provided_ that the party making such
request shall reimburse each such other party for its reasonable and
documented out-of-pocket costs and expenses in providing such assistance;
_provided_ , _further_ , that such assistance shall not unreasonably interfere
with the business and operations of any such other party or its Affiliates.

 



77 8.15. _Third Party Consents_. Following the Closing, if any consents, waivers
or approvals from any third party set forth under items 1 and 2 on _Schedule
7.3(a)(i)_ have not been obtained at or prior to Closing, Seller shall have
the right, at its option, upon prior written notice to Buyer, to continue to
seek such consents, waivers or approvals in consultation with Buyer, and in
connection therewith may agree to an extension of the term of the Contract for
which consent is being sought, to the extent that such extension is provided
for on _Schedule 7.3(a)(i)_ and the extension does not exceed the term
provided for on _Schedule 7.3(a)(i)_ ; _provided_ , _however_ , that any
action taken in seeking such consents shall be undertaken in a manner that
shall not unreasonably disrupt the business and operations of the Company
Group; _provided_ , _further_ , that notwithstanding anything to the contrary
in this Agreement, such action shall not include any requirement of Seller or
any of its Affiliates (including, for the avoidance of doubt, the Company
Group Members on or prior to the Closing Date) or Buyer or any of its
Affiliates (including, for the avoidance of doubt, the Company Group Members
after the Closing Date) to pay money to any third party (other than
_de minimis_ administrative and review costs), commence or participate in any
litigation, arbitration, mediation or administrative process, offer or grant
any accommodation or undertake any obligation or liability (in each case
financial or otherwise) to any third party (including any Governmental Body);
and _provided_ , _further_ , that no provision of any such Contract (other
than the term of such Contract to the extent provided for on _Schedule
7.3(a)(i)_ ) may be amended or modified in any manner without the prior
written consent of Buyer.

8.16. _Commercial Agreements_. Seller and Buyer hereby agree that from and
after the Closing, notwithstanding the terms thereof, each of the Commercial
Agreements shall be terminable with or without cause by any of Seller, Buyer
or their applicable Affiliates (including the Company Group Members)
party thereto upon ninety (90) days prior written notice, and each of Seller
and Buyer shall, and shall cause their applicable Affiliates to, take all such
actions necessary to effectuate the termination in accordance with this
sentence upon the request of the other party.

_Section 5.20(b)_, _provided_ that in no event shall the amount provided for
in this clause (B) exceed $7,000,000; _provided_ , _further_ , that Losses,
if any, in respect of any breach of _Section 5.20(b)_ shall be paid first
from the amount set forth in clause (B) above and second from the amount set
forth in clause (A) above; _provided_ , _further_ , that other than
for fraud, the aggregate amount required to be paid by Seller pursuant to
this _Article XI_, taken together, shall not exceed the Base Purchase Price.
For the avoidance of doubt, other than with respect to breaches of Seller
Fundamental Representations, in no event shall the aggregate amount required
to be paid by Seller under _Sections 11.1(a)(i)(A)_, _11.1(a)(ii)_ (other
than in respect to a breach of _Section 5.20(b)_) and _11.1(a)(vi)_
exceed $13,750,000.

(b) The indemnification provided for in _Section 11.1(a)(i)_ and _Section
11.1(a)(ii)_ shall terminate eighteen (18) months after the Closing Date (and
no claims shall be made by any Buyer Group Member under this _Article XI_
thereafter), except that:

 

(i) the indemnification by Seller shall continue as to the covenants of Seller
to be performed after the Closing Date until performed in accordance with
their respective terms or, if no term is expressly stated, upon the expiration
of the statute of limitations period applicable to the matters covered
thereby;

 

(ii) the indemnification by Seller shall continue as to the Seller Fundamental
Representations until the expiration of the applicable statute of
limitations;

(iii) the indemnification by Seller shall continue as to the representations
and warranties of Seller set forth in clauses (a), (c), (d), (e), (g), (h),
(i), (m), (q) and (r) of _Section 5.10_ (Taxes) until the expiration of the
applicable statute of limitations, plus 60 days;

 

(iv) the indemnification by Seller shall continue as to the representations
and warranties of Seller set forth in _Sections 5.18_ (Employee Benefit
Plans) and _5.20_ (Employees), which shall terminate the earlier of (A) three
(3) years after the Closing Date and (B) the applicable statute of limitations
with respect to the liabilities in question (as extended), plus 60 days; and

(v) the indemnification by Seller shall continue as to any Loss of which any
Buyer Group Member has notified Seller in accordance with the requirements of
_Section 11.3_ on or prior to the date such indemnification would otherwise
terminate in accordance with this _Section 11.1_ until the liability of
Seller shall have been determined pursuant to this _Article XI_, and Seller
shall have reimbursed all Buyer Group Members for the full amount of such
indemnifiable Loss in accordance with this _Article XI_.

 



82 (c) The indemnification provided for in this _Section 11.1_ as to
the representations and warranties of Seller set forth in clauses (f), (j)
and (o) of _Section 5.10_ shall terminate eighteen (18) months after the
Closing Date (and no claims shall be made by any Buyer Group Member under
this  _Article XI_ thereafter with respect to such representations and
warranties of Seller set forth in such clauses), and no Losses with respect to
any breach by Seller or any Seller Affiliate of the representations and
warranties of Seller set forth in such clauses shall be taken into account
except to the extent of Losses actually incurred with respect to taxable
periods or portions thereof (determined on a closing of the books basis)
during such eighteen (18) month period due to the breach of the
representations and warranties of Seller set forth in clauses (f), (j) and (o)
of _Section 5.10_ (and, for avoidance of doubt, Losses incurred in respect of
taxable periods or portions thereof (determined on a closing of the books
basis) beyond such eighteen (18) month period shall not be taken into account,
whether or not a claim in respect of such Losses is made during such eighteen
(18) month period). As provided in _Section 5.10_, notwithstanding anything
to the contrary in this Agreement, for the avoidance of doubt (and without
creating any implication as to the scope or effect of any other
representations), nothing in the representations and warranties of Seller set
forth in clauses (b), (k), (l), (n), or (p) of _Section 5.10_ shall cause
Seller to be liable for any Taxes or related Losses for which Seller is not
expressly liable pursuant to _Section 8.1_ (relating to Tax matters). For
the avoidance of doubt, to the extent the applicable Governmental Body
successfully challenges Sellers and its Affiliates application of accounting
principles or the Code in its Tax Returns, which successful challenge results
in Losses to Buyer for Taxes imposed on any Company Group Member attributable
to taxable years or periods beginning after the Closing Date (and, with
respect to any Straddle Period, the portion of such Straddle Period beginning
immediately after the Closing Date), then Buyer may assert a claim for Losses
under _Section 11.1(a)(iv)_; _provided_ , _however_ , that Buyer shall not be
entitled to indemnification to the extent that such Losses result from the
continued application by Buyer of Sellers and its Affiliates application of
Sellers and its Affiliates historical accounting principles and
interpretation of the Code at any time after the Closing Date.

 

11.2. _Indemnification by Buyer_.

 

(a) Subject to the limitations in this _Article XI_, from and after the
Closing, Buyer shall indemnify and hold harmless each Seller Group Member
from and against any and all Losses incurred by such Seller Group Member
proximately resulting from:

 

(i) any breach by Buyer or, after the Closing, the Company Group of any of
their respective covenants or agreements in (A) _Article VII_ and (B) any
other provision of this Agreement;

(ii) any breach of any warranty or the inaccuracy of any representation of
Buyer contained in this Agreement or any certificate delivered by or on behalf
of Buyer pursuant to this Agreement (determined without regard to any
limitation or qualification by the words "material", "in all material
respects" or derivatives of such words);

(iii) the Assumed Liabilities and Buyer Taxes; or

(iv) the employment, or termination of employment, of any Business Employees
on or after the Closing Date, including the payment of compensation earned or
benefits accrued by Business Employees on or after the Closing Date.

 



83 _provided_ , _however_ , (1) other than with respect to breaches of the Buyer
Fundamental Representations, Buyer shall not be required to indemnify and
hold harmless any Seller Group Member under _clauses (i)(A)_ and _(ii)_ of
this _Section 11.2(a)_ with respect to Losses incurred by Seller Group
Members that are less than $75,000 and any such individual claim shall not be
aggregated for purposes of the following _clause (2)_ ( _provided_ that
Losses arising out of the same facts or circumstances may be aggregated for
purposes of this  _clause (1)_), (2) other than with respect to breaches of
the Buyer Fundamental Representations, Buyer shall be required to indemnify
and hold harmless any Seller Group Member under _clauses (i)(A)_ and _(ii)_
of this _Section 11.2(a)_ with respect to Losses incurred by Seller Group
Members only to the extent that the aggregate amount of such Losses incurred
by the Seller Group Members exceeds $2,000,000 and then only with respect to
such excess, and (3) other than with respect to breaches of the Buyer
Fundamental Representations, the aggregate amount required to be paid by Buyer
under _Sections 11.2(a)(i)(A)_ and _11.2(a)(ii)_ shall not exceed
$13,750,000; and  _provided_ , _further_ , that other than for fraud, the
aggregate amount required to be paid by Buyer pursuant to this _Article XI_,
taken together, shall not exceed the Base Purchase Price.

 

(b) The indemnification provided for in this _Section 11.2_ shall terminate
eighteen (18) months after the Closing Date (and no claims shall be made by
any Seller Group Member under this _Section 11.2_ thereafter), except that:

 

(i) the indemnification by Buyer shall continue as to the covenants of Buyer
and the Company Group to be performed after the Closing Date until performed
in accordance with their respective terms or, if no term is expressly stated,
upon the expiration of the statute of limitations period applicable to the
matters covered thereby;

 

(ii) the indemnification by Buyer shall continue indefinitely as to the
matters covered in _Sections 11.2(a)(iii)_ and  _11.2(a)(iv)_ ;

(iii) the indemnification by Buyer shall continue as to the Buyer Fundamental
Representations until the expiration of the applicable statute of
limitations; and

(iv) the indemnification by Buyer shall continue as to any Loss of which any
Seller Group Member has notified Buyer in accordance with the requirements of
_Section 11.3_ on or prior to the date such indemnification would otherwise
terminate in accordance with this _Section 11.2_ until the liability of
Buyer shall have been determined pursuant to this _Article XI_, and Buyer
shall have reimbursed all Seller Group Members for the full amount of such
indemnifiable Loss in accordance with this _Article XI_.

 



84 11.3. _Notice of Claims_.

 

(a) Any Buyer Group Member or Seller Group Member (the " _Indemnified Party_
") seeking indemnification hereunder shall give to the party obligated to
provide indemnification to such Indemnified Party (the " _Indemnitor_ ") a
notice (a " _Claim Notice_ ") describing in reasonable detail the facts giving
rise to any claim for indemnification hereunder and shall include in such
Claim Notice the amount or the method of computation of the amount of such
claim, and a reference to the provision of this Agreement or any other
agreement, document or instrument executed hereunder or in connection
herewith upon which such claim is based; _provided_ that a Claim Notice in
respect of any Third Party Claim shall be given promptly after such
Indemnified Party has become aware of such Third Party Claim;  _provided_ ,
_further_ , that failure to give such notice shall not relieve the Indemnitor
of its obligations hereunder except to the extent the Indemnitor shall have
been prejudiced by such failure (including prejudice to Indemnitors right to
participate in the defense or resolution of the matter giving rise to the
indemnification obligation hereunder). The Indemnified Party shall reasonably
cooperate and assist the Indemnitor in determining the validity of any claim
for indemnity by the Indemnified Party and in otherwise resolving such
matters, including, without limitation, providing during normal business hours
upon reasonable advance notice and with a view toward minimizing disruption of
the Indemnified Partys business reasonable access to and copies of
information, records and documents relating to such matters ( _provided_ that
this _Section 11.3(a)_ shall not require the Indemnified Party to make
available any such records, materials or information (i) that is subject to
attorney-client or other legal privilege if making available any such records,
materials or information would result in a violation or waiver of such
privilege, or (ii) if the provision thereof to the Indemnitor would violate
Requirements of Law) and furnishing employees to assist in the investigation,
defense and resolution of such matters.

 

(b) After the giving of any Claim Notice pursuant hereto, the amount of
indemnification to which an Indemnified Party shall be entitled under this
_Article XI_ shall be determined: (i) by the written agreement between the
Indemnified Party and the Indemnitor; (ii) by a final judgment or decree of
any court of competent jurisdiction; or (iii) by any other means to which the
Indemnified Party and the Indemnitor shall agree. The judgment or decree of a
court shall be deemed final when the time for appeal, if any, shall have
expired and no appeal shall have been taken or when all appeals taken shall
have been finally determined. The Indemnified Party shall have the burden of
proof in establishing the amount of Losses suffered by it.

 

11.4. _Third Party Claims_.

 

(a) Any party seeking indemnification provided for under this Agreement in
respect of, arising out of or involving a claim or demand made by any third
Person against the Indemnified Party (a " _Third Party Claim_ ") shall notify
the Indemnitor in writing, and in reasonable detail, of the Third Party Claim
within ten (10) Business Days (or reasonably more promptly dependent upon the
circumstances) after receipt by such Indemnified Party of written notice of
the Third Party Claim. Thereafter, the Indemnified Party shall deliver to the
Indemnitor, within five (5) Business Days after the Indemnified Partys
receipt thereof, copies of all notices and documents (including court papers)
received by the Indemnified Party

 



85  relating to the Third Party Claim. Any notice of a claim by reason of any of
the representations, warranties or covenants contained in this Agreement shall
refer to the provision of this Agreement upon which such claim is based and
describe in reasonable detail (to the extent known) the facts giving rise to
an alleged basis for the claim and the amount of the liability asserted
against the Indemnitor by reason of the Third Party Claim; _provided_ ,
_however_ , that the failure or delay of the Indemnified Party to give notice
to the Indemnitor as provided in this _Section 11.4_ shall not relieve the
Indemnitor of its obligations hereunder except to the extent the Indemnitor
shall have been prejudiced by such failure (including prejudice to
Indemnitors right to assume or participate in the defense or resolution of
the Third Party Claim giving rise to the indemnification obligation
hereunder). 

(b) In the event of the initiation of a Third Party Claim, the Indemnitor
shall have the sole and absolute right after the receipt of notice, at its
option and at its own expense, to be represented by counsel of its choice and
to control, defend against, negotiate, settle or otherwise deal with any
Proceeding, claim, or demand which relates to any Loss indemnified against
hereunder; _provided_ , _however_ , that the Indemnified Party may participate
in any such Proceeding with counsel of its choice and at its expense;
_provided_ _further_ , _however_ , that the Indemnitor shall not be entitled
to assume or continue control of the defense of any Third Party Claim if (i)
the Third Party Claim primarily relates to or arises in connection with any
criminal Proceeding against the Indemnified Party or (ii) the Third
Party Claim seeks an injunction or equitable relief against any Indemnified
Party; _provided_ _further_ , _however_ , that if the Indemnitor and the
Indemnified Party determine that such injunction or equitable relief portion
of any Third Party Claim can be so separated from the portion for monetary
damages for which the Indemnified Party would be entitled to indemnification
under this Agreement, the Indemnitor shall be entitled to assume the defense
of the portion relating to monetary damages for which the Indemnified Party
would be entitled to indemnification under this Agreement. The parties hereto
agree to cooperate fully with each other in connection with the defense,
negotiation or settlement of any Third Party Claim. To the extent the
Indemnitor elects not to defend such Third Party Claim and the Indemnified
Party defends against or otherwise deals therewith, the Indemnified Party may
retain counsel at the expense of the Indemnitor, which counsel shall
be reasonably acceptable to the Indemnitor, and control the defense of such
Proceeding; _provided_ , _however_ , that the Indemnitor shall be obligated
pursuant to this _Section 11.4_ to pay for only one firm of counsel for
all Indemnified Parties. Neither the Indemnitor nor the Indemnified Party may
settle any such Proceeding which it is entitled to, and has elected to,
control in accordance with this _Section 11.4_, which settlement obligates
the other party to pay money, to perform obligations or to admit liability
without the consent of the other party, such consent not to be unreasonably
withheld, conditioned or delayed. If the Indemnified Party shall refuse to
consent to the settlement of any Third Party Claim, so long as only money
damages are involved and there is no admission of liability or wrongdoing with
respect to the Indemnified Party, the liability of the Indemnitor in respect
of such Third Party Claim shall not exceed the amount for which the Third
Party Claim could have been settled plus the amount of expenses incurred by
the Indemnified Party prior to the time of and in connection with the proposed
settlement to which it is entitled to indemnification. Notwithstanding
the foregoing, the Indemnified Party shall have the right to pay, settle or
compromise any Third Party Claim without consent, _provided_ that in such
event the Indemnified Party shall waive any right to indemnity therefor
hereunder.

 

(c) If there shall be any conflicts between the provisions of this _Section
11.4_ and _Section 8.1(c)_ (relating to Tax contests), the provision of
_Section 8.1(c)_ shall control with respect to Tax contests.

 



86 11.5. _Adjustment to Purchase Price_. Buyer and Seller agree that, for
purposes of computing the amount of any indemnification payment under this
_Article XI_, any such indemnification payment shall be treated as an
adjustment to the Purchase Price for all Tax purposes.

 

11.6. _Calculation of Losses_.

 

(a) In calculating any Loss there shall be deducted (i) any insurance recovery
in respect thereof (and no right of subrogation shall accrue hereunder to any
insurer), (ii) all Tax benefits actually realized by the Indemnified Party or
any of its Affiliates through a reduction in federal, state, local and foreign
Taxes (including estimated Taxes) then due and payable, or a refund of Taxes
previously paid, with respect to the taxable year or period in which such Loss
occurred or a prior taxable year or period, but only if and to the extent such
reduction or refund in Tax results from incurrence of such Loss, and (iii)
any amount to the extent accrued for or reserved against in the Financial
Statements or accounted for in the Closing Date Balance Sheet and the Closing
Date Working Capital, excluding for purposes of this clause (iii) any such
amounts accrued for or reserved against in the Financial Statements or
accounted for in the Closing Date Balance Sheet with respect to Taxes (except
to the extent such Taxes are also accounted for in Closing Date
Working Capital). In the event that expenses are incurred by an Indemnitor in
conducting the defense against a Third Party Claim in accordance with _Section
11.4(b)_, such expenses shall not constitute Losses for purposes of
determining the maximum aggregate amount to be paid by the applicable
Indemnitor pursuant to _Section 11.1_ or _11.2_ , as the case may be. To the
extent a Loss (A) has not otherwise been reduced pursuant to clause (ii) of
this  _Section 11.6(a)_, and (B) remains available to be utilized to reduce
Taxes actually due and payable by the Indemnified Party or its Affiliates with
respect to future years, the Indemnified Party shall remit to the Indemnitor
the amount, if any, of any Tax benefit actually realized by the Indemnified
Party or its Affiliates with respect to the two (2) taxable years or periods
following the year or period in which the Loss was incurred. For purposes of
this  _Section 11.6_, a Tax benefit is realized to the extent (i) the Tax
liability of the Indemnified Party or its Affiliates calculated by excluding
the relevant Tax deductions, losses and credits attributable to the Loss
exceeds (ii) the actual Tax liability of the Indemnified Party or its
Affiliates calculated by taking into account the relevant Tax deductions,
losses and credits attributable to the Loss (and treating such deductions,
losses and credits as the last items in such calculation). The Indemnified
Party shall remit to the Indemnitor the amount of the realized Tax benefit
within thirty (30) days after the date of realization.

 

(b) No party shall have any liability or obligation under any provision of
this Agreement for any punitive, consequential, special or indirect damages,
including business interruption, loss of future revenue whether or not
expected, profits or income, or loss of business reputation or opportunity
relating to the breach or alleged breach of this Agreement.

 



87 (c) Buyer and Seller shall cooperate with each other with respect to
resolving any claim or Loss for which indemnification may be required
hereunder, including by making, or causing the applicable Indemnified Party to
make, all commercially reasonable efforts to mitigate any such claim or Loss.
If Buyer or Seller shall fail to make such commercially reasonable efforts,
then notwithstanding anything else to the contrary contained herein, the other
party shall not be required to indemnify any Person for any claim, liability
or Loss that would reasonably be expected to have been avoided if such
efforts had been made. Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, Buyer
and Seller shall, or shall cause the applicable Indemnified Party to, use
commercially reasonable efforts to seek full recovery under all
insurance policies covering any Loss to the same extent as they would if such
Loss were not subject to indemnification hereunder.

 

(d) Notwithstanding any other provision of this Agreement to the contrary,
Seller shall have no Liability for any inaccuracy in or breach of any
representation, warranty, covenant or agreement by Seller if Buyer had
Knowledge on or before the Closing Date of the facts as a result of which or
in connection with such representation, warranty, covenant or agreement
was inaccurate or breached. Solely for purposes of this _Section 11.6(d)_,
Knowledge of Buyer as it relates to materials in the Data Room shall be
confined to those materials in the Data Room and available for viewing by
Buyer on or prior to October 28, 2014\. Notwithstanding any other provision
of this Agreement to the contrary, Buyer shall have no Liability for any
inaccuracy in or breach of any representation, warranty, covenant or agreement
by Buyer if Seller had Knowledge on or before the Closing Date of the facts
as a result of which or in connection with such representation, warranty,
covenant or agreement was inaccurate or breached.

 

11.7. _Assignment of Claims_. If any Indemnified Party or any of its
Affiliates receives any payment from any Indemnitor in respect of any Losses
pursuant to this _Article XI_ and the Indemnified Party or any of its
Affiliates could have recovered all or a part of such Losses from a third
party (a " _Potential Contributor_ ") based on the underlying claim asserted
against the Indemnitor, the Indemnified Party or its applicable Affiliate
shall assign, on a non-recourse basis and without any representation or
warranty, such of its rights to proceed against the Potential Contributor as
are necessary to permit the Indemnitor to recover from the Potential
Contributor the amount of such payment. If any such assignment would afford
the Potential Contributor any defense to the payment of the same, such
assignment shall not take place and the Indemnified Party will, at
Indemnitors direction, take all reasonable actions to seek to recover such
claim from such Potential Contributor. Any payment received in respect of such
claim against the Potential Contributor (whether by the Indemnitor or the
relevant Indemnified Party as provided in the immediately preceding sentence)
shall be distributed, (a) first, to the Indemnitor in an amount equal to the
aggregate payments made by the Indemnitor to the Indemnified Party in respect
of such claim, plus the costs and expenses incurred in investigating,
prosecuting, defending or otherwise addressing such claim, (b) second, to the
Indemnified Party in the amount of any deductible or similar amount required
to be paid by the Indemnified Party prior to the Indemnitor being required to
make any payment to the Indemnified Party plus, in the case of any claim by
the Indemnified Party as provided in the immediately preceding sentence, the
costs and expenses incurred in investigating, prosecuting, defending or
otherwise addressing such claim, and (c) third, the balance, if any, to the
Indemnified Party.

 



88 11.8. _Exclusive Remedy_.

 

(a) Except for intentional fraud and for injunctive relief, if the Closing
occurs, this _Article XI_ shall be the exclusive remedy for any breach of
this Agreement (whether under this Agreement or arising under common law or
Requirements of Law), any certificate or document delivered pursuant hereto
or, except as expressly specified therein, any Ancillary Agreement. In
furtherance of the foregoing, each party hereby waives, to the fullest extent
permitted under Requirements of Law, any and all rights, claims and causes of
action for any breach of any representation, warranty, covenant, agreement
or obligation set forth herein or otherwise relating to the subject matter of
this Agreement it may have against the other parties hereto and their
Affiliates and each of their respective Representatives arising under or based
upon any Requirements of Law, except pursuant to the indemnification
provisions set forth in this _Article XI_.

(b) Any liability for indemnification hereunder shall be determined without
duplication of recovery by reason of the state of facts giving rise to such
liability constituting a breach of more than one representation, warranty,
covenant or agreement or by reason of a Party receiving an adjustment to the
Base Purchase Price pursuant to _Article III_ in connection with the facts
giving rise to the right of indemnification.

 

ARTICLE XII

12.1. _Termination_. Anything contained in this Agreement to the contrary
notwithstanding, this Agreement may be terminated at any time prior to the
Closing Date:

April 30, 2015 (the " _Termination Date_ "); _provided_ , _however_ , that if
all of the conditions to Closing, other than the conditions set forth in
_Section 9.1(b)_ and _Section 10.1(b)_ (and other than those conditions that
by their nature can only be satisfied at the Closing), shall have been

or Buyer by written notice to the other party up to a date that is not more
than sixty (60) days after the original Termination Date;

(c) by Buyer in the event of (i) any material breach by Seller of any of

cure such breach within 30 days after receipt of notice from Buyer requesting
such breach to be cured;

 

(d) by Seller in the event of (i) any material breach by Buyer of any of
Buyers covenants, agreements, representations or warranties contained herein

such breach within 30 days after receipt of notice from Seller requesting
such breach to be cured; or

(e) by Buyer or Seller if any Governmental Body of competent jurisdiction
shall have issued a Court Order prohibiting or making illegal the consummation
of the Closing and such Court Order has become final and nonappealable.

) shall be terminated without further liability of any party to the other,
_provided_ that nothing herein shall relieve any party from liability for its
breach of this Agreement.

months, except for the periods stated in _Sections 11.1_ and  _11.2_ with
respect to those representations, warranties and covenants expressly referred
to in such Sections. Except as otherwise provided herein, no claim shall be
made for the breach of any representation or warranty contained in  _Articles
V_ or _VI_ or under any certificate delivered with respect thereto under this

advisors or lenders). No party shall use any such confidential information in
any manner whatsoever except solely for the purpose of evaluating the

the other party hereto.

 

13.5. _Successors and Assigns_.

 

(a) The rights of either party under this Agreement shall not be assignable by
such party hereto prior to the Closing without the written consent of the
other. Following the Closing, either party may assign any of its rights
hereunder to any of its Affiliates, but no such assignment shall relieve such
party of its obligations hereunder.

 

(b) This Agreement shall be binding upon and inure to the benefit of the
parties hereto and their successors and permitted assigns. Nothing in this
Agreement, expressed or implied, is intended or shall be construed to confer
upon any Person other than the parties and successors and assigns permitted by
this _Section 13.5_ any right, remedy or claim under or by reason of this
Agreement; _provided_ , _however_ , the provisions of _Section 13.14_,
_Section 13.19_, this _Section 13.5(b)_ and _Section 13.7_ shall be
enforceable by each Lender.

 

13.6. _Access to Records after Closing_.

 

(a) For a period of six years after the Closing Date, Seller and its
representatives shall have reasonable access to all of the books and records
of the Company Group pertaining to the operations of the Company Group or the
Seller Group prior to the Closing Date (to the extent that such books and
records were delivered to Buyer (either directly or indirectly
through Buyers acquisition of the Company Group Members) pursuant to this
Agreement) for any reasonable business purpose, including in order for Seller
to (i) defend an indemnified claim made pursuant to this Agreement, (ii)
defend a Tax proceeding or Tax audit, (iii) respond to a written demand of a
Governmental Body with jurisdiction over the Seller Group and (iv) comply with
its reporting obligations under applicable securities laws; _provided_ ,
_however_ , that nothing in this _Section 13.6(a)_ shall obligate Buyer or
its

 



92  Affiliates to provide any such access if providing such access would violate
Requirements of Laws. Such access shall be afforded by Buyer upon receipt of
reasonable advance notice and during normal business hours and with a view
toward minimizing disruption of business. Seller shall be solely responsible
for any costs or expenses incurred by it, its representatives, Buyer or any
Company Group Member pursuant to this  _Section 13.6(a)_. If Buyer or the
Company Group shall desire to dispose of any of such books and records prior
to the expiration of such six-year period, Buyer shall, prior to such
disposition, give Seller a reasonable opportunity, at Sellers expense, to
segregate and remove such books and records as Seller may select.

(b) For a period of six years after the Closing Date, Buyer and its
representatives shall have reasonable access to all of the books and records
of the Seller Group pertaining to the Business prior to the Closing Date (to
the extent that such books and records were not delivered to Buyer (either
directly or indirectly through Buyers acquisition of the Company Group
Members) pursuant to this Agreement) for any reasonable business purpose,
including in order for Buyer to (i) defend an indemnified claim made pursuant
to this Agreement, (ii) defend a Tax proceeding or Tax audit, (iii) respond to
a written demand of a Governmental Body with jurisdiction over the Buyer Group
and (iv) comply with its reporting obligations under applicable securities
laws; _provided_ , _however_ , that nothing in this _Section 13.6(b)_ shall
obligate Seller or its Affiliates to provide any such access if providing such
access would violate Requirements of Laws. Such access shall be afforded by
Seller upon receipt of reasonable advance notice and during normal business
hours and with a view toward minimizing disruption of business. Buyer shall be
solely responsible for any costs or expenses incurred by it, its
representatives, Seller or any Seller Group Member pursuant to this _Section
13.6(b)_. If Seller shall desire to dispose of any of such books and records
prior to the expiration of such six-year period, Seller shall, prior to such
disposition, give Buyer a reasonable opportunity, at Buyers expense, to
segregate and remove such books and records as Buyer may select.

13.7. _Entire Agreement; Amendments; Conflicts_.

(a) This Agreement and the Exhibits and Schedules referred to herein and
the documents delivered pursuant hereto contain the entire understanding of
the parties hereto with regard to the subject matter contained herein or
therein, and supersede all prior agreements, understandings or letters of
intent between or among any of the parties hereto, including, without
limitation, the Confidentiality Agreement. This Agreement shall not be
amended, modified or supplemented except by a written instrument signed by an
authorized representative of each of the parties hereto;  _provided_ that
this _Section 13.7(a)_, _Section 13.5_, _Section 13.14_ and _Section
13.19_ may not be amended in a manner adverse to any Lender without the
written consent of such Lender.

 

(b) In the event of any conflict between the terms of this Agreement and the
terms any instrument of transfer in a form attached hereto as _Exhibit E_ ,
_Exhibit F_ , _Exhibit F-1_ , _Exhibit F-2_ or _Exhibit F-3_ , the terms of
this Agreement shall control.

 

13.8. _Interpretation_. Article titles and headings to sections herein are
inserted for convenience of reference only and are not intended to be a part
of or to affect the meaning or

 



93  interpretation of this Agreement. Whenever the words "include", "includes"
or "including" are used in this Agreement they shall be deemed to be followed
by the words "without limitation." The words "hereof", "herein" and
"herewith" and words of similar import shall, unless otherwise stated, be
construed to refer to this Agreement as a whole and not to any
particular provision of this Agreement, and article, section, paragraph,
exhibit and schedule references are to the articles, sections, paragraphs,
exhibits and schedules of this Agreement unless otherwise specified. The words
"or" and "nor" shall not be exclusive. The meaning assigned to each term
defined herein shall be equally applicable to both the singular and the plural
forms of such term, and words denoting any gender shall include all genders.
Where a word or phrase is defined herein, each of its other grammatical forms
shall have a corresponding meaning. A reference to any party to this Agreement
or any other agreement or document shall include such partys successors and
permitted assigns. Unless the context shall otherwise require, any reference
to any contract, instrument, statute, rule or regulation is a reference to it
as amended and supplemented from time to time (and, in the case of a statute,
rule or regulation, to any successor provision). The parties have
participated jointly in the negotiation and drafting of this Agreement. In the
event an ambiguity or question of intent or interpretation arises, this
Agreement shall be construed as if drafted jointly by the parties hereto, and
no presumption or burden of proof shall arise favoring or disfavoring any
Party by virtue of the authorship of any provisions of this Agreement. All
payments and adjustments under this Agreement shall be made in U.S. Dollars; 
_provided_ , _however_ , that the return to Seller of cash or other collateral
received any Buyer Group Member pursuant to _Section 8.6_ shall be made in
the currency received by such Buyer Group Member. The Schedules and
Exhibits referred to herein shall be construed with and as an integral part
of this Agreement to the same extent as if they were set forth verbatim
herein. Disclosure of any fact or item in any Schedule hereto referenced by a
particular section in this Agreement shall be deemed to have been disclosed
with respect to every other section in this Agreement. Except as explicitly
disclosed as material in this Agreement or the Schedules hereto, neither the
specification of any dollar amount in any representation or warranty
contained in this Agreement nor the inclusion of any specific item in any
Schedule hereto is intended to imply that such amount, or higher or lower
amounts, or the item so included or other items, are or are not material, and
no party shall use the fact of the setting forth of any such amount or the
inclusion of any such item in any dispute or controversy between the parties
as to whether any obligation, item or matter not described herein or included
in any Schedule is or is not material for purposes of this Agreement. Unless
this Agreement specifically provides otherwise, neither the specification of
any item or matter in any representation or warranty contained in this
Agreement nor the inclusion of any specific item in any Schedule hereto is
intended to imply that such item or matter, or other items or matters, are or
are not in the Ordinary Course of Business, and no party shall use the fact of
the setting forth or the inclusion of any such item or matter in any dispute
or controversy between the parties as to whether any obligation, item or
matter not described herein or included in any Schedule is or is not in the
Ordinary Course of Business for purposes of this Agreement. No later
than three (3) Business Days prior to the Closing, Seller shall have the
right upon notice to Buyer to supplement, modify or update the Schedules to
this Agreement; _provided_ that the information disclosed to Buyer pursuant to
any such supplement, modification or update shall not be taken into account
for purposes of determining whether the conditions described in _Article IX_
have been satisfied; _provided_ , _further_ , that if the Closing occurs, any
such supplement, modification or update shall be effective to cure and
correct for all other purposes (including, for the avoidance of doubt, for

 



94  purposes of _Article XI_ ) any inaccuracy in or breach of any
representation, warranty or covenant which would have existed at Closing if
Seller had not made such supplement, modification or update, and all
references in this Agreement to any Schedule to this Agreement which is
supplemented, modified or updated in accordance with this _Section 13.8_
shall for purposes after the Closing be deemed to be a reference to
such Schedule as so supplemented, modified or updated.

13.9. _Waivers_. Any term or provision of this Agreement may be waived, or
the time for its performance may be extended, by the party or parties
entitled to the benefit thereof. Any such waiver shall be validly and
sufficiently authorized for the purposes of this Agreement if, as to any
party, it is authorized in writing by an authorized representative of such
party. The failure of any party hereto to enforce at any time any provision of
this Agreement shall not be construed to be a waiver of such provision, nor in
any way to affect the validity of this Agreement or any part hereof or the
right of any party thereafter to enforce each and every such provision. No
waiver of any breach of this Agreement shall be held to constitute a waiver of
any other or subsequent breach.

 

13.10. _Expenses_. Each party hereto will pay all costs and expenses incident
to its negotiation and preparation of this Agreement and to its performance
and compliance with all agreements and conditions contained herein on its part
to be performed or complied with, including the fees, expenses and
disbursements of its counsel, investment bank and accountants.

 

13.11. _Partial Invalidity_. Wherever possible, each provision hereof shall be
interpreted in such manner as to be effective and valid under applicable law,
but in case any one or more of the provisions contained herein shall, for any
reason, be held to be invalid, illegal or unenforceable in any respect, such
provision shall be ineffective to the extent, but only to the extent, of such
invalidity, illegality or unenforceability without invalidating the remainder
of such invalid, illegal or unenforceable provision or provisions or any other
provisions hereof, unless such a construction would be unreasonable.

 

13.12. _Execution in Counterparts_. This Agreement may be executed in two or
more counterparts, each of which shall be considered an original instrument,
but all of which shall be considered one and the same agreement, and shall
become binding when one or more counterparts have been signed by each of the
parties hereto and delivered to each of Seller and Buyer.

 

13.13. _Further Assurances_.

 

(a) On and after the Closing Date each party hereto shall take such other
actions and execute such other documents and instruments of conveyance and
transfer as may be reasonably requested by the other party hereto from time to
time to effectuate the transactions contemplated by this Agreement and the
Ancillary Agreements.

 

(b) The parties hereto acknowledge and agree that certain assets, rights and
claims of the Seller Group that are not related exclusively to the Business
may be transferred pursuant to this Agreement. If, following the Closing,
Buyer or any member of the Seller Group reasonably determines that any such
asset was transferred to Buyer, the parties agree, if and to 

 



95  the extent otherwise consistent with this Agreement and the Ancillary
Agreements to which they are party, to cooperate to transfer back to the
Seller Group or its designated Affiliate such asset as promptly as
practicable without the payment of consideration. The parties hereto
acknowledge and agree that certain assets of the Asset Contributors related
exclusively to the Business may not have been transferred pursuant to this
Agreement. If, following the Closing, Buyer or any Asset Contributor
determines that any such asset was not transferred to Buyer, the parties
agree, if and to the extent otherwise consistent with this Agreement and the
Ancillary Agreements to which they are party, to cooperate to transfer to
Buyer such asset as promptly as practicable without the payment of any further
consideration.

13.14.  _Governing Law; Submission to Jurisdiction; Waiver of Jury Trial_.
This Agreement shall be governed by and construed in accordance with the
internal laws (as opposed to the conflicts of law provisions) of the State of
Delaware. Each party irrevocably submits to the exclusive jurisdiction of the
Delaware State courts located in the City of Wilmington, Delaware, and the
United States District Court for the District of Delaware (and the appropriate
appellate courts), for the purposes of any suit, action or other proceeding
arising out of this Agreement, any Ancillary Agreement, any certificate
delivered pursuant hereto or thereto or any transaction contemplated by this
Agreement. Each party agrees to commence any such action, suit or Proceeding
either in the United States District Court for the District of Delaware or if
such suit, action or other proceeding may not be brought in such court for
jurisdictional reasons, in any Delaware State court located in the City
of Wilmington, Delaware. Each party irrevocably and unconditionally waives
any objection to the laying of venue of any action, suit or proceeding arising
out of this Agreement, any Ancillary Agreement or the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement in (i) any Delaware State court located in the
City of Wilmington, Delaware or (ii) the United States District Court for the
District of Delaware, and hereby further irrevocably and unconditionally
waives and agrees not to plead or claim in any such court that any such
action, suit or proceeding brought in any such court has been brought in an
inconvenient forum. EACH PARTY HEREBY WAIVES, TO THE FULLEST EXTENT PERMITTED
BY APPLICABLE LAW, ANY RIGHT IT MAY HAVE TO A TRIAL BY JURY IN ANY LITIGATION
DIRECTLY OR INDIRECTLY ARISING OUT OF, INVOLVING OR OTHERWISE IN RESPECT OF
THIS AGREEMENT, ANY ANCILLARY AGREEMENT OR ANY TRANSACTION CONTEMPLATED HEREBY
OR THEREBY (INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO ANY DISPUTE ARISING OUT OF OR
RELATING TO THE DEBT COMMITMENT LETTER, THE FINANCING AGREEMENTS OR THE
PERFORMANCE THEREOF). EACH PARTY (A) CERTIFIES THAT NO REPRESENTATIVE, AGENT
OR ATTORNEY OF ANY OTHER PARTY HAS REPRESENTED, EXPRESSLY OR OTHERWISE, THAT
SUCH OTHER PARTY WOULD NOT, IN THE EVENT OF LITIGATION, SEEK TO ENFORCE THE
FOREGOING WAIVER AND (B) ACKNOWLEDGES THAT IT AND THE OTHER PARTIES HERETO
HAVE BEEN INDUCED TO ENTER INTO THIS AGREEMENT AND THE ANCILLARY AGREEMENTS,
AS APPLICABLE, BY, AMONG OTHER THINGS, THE MUTUAL WAIVERS AND CERTIFICATIONS
IN THIS _SECTION 13.14_.

Notwithstanding anything contrary in this Agreement, each of the parties
hereto agrees that it will not bring or support, nor will it permit any of
its Affiliates to bring or support, any action, cause of action, claim, cross-
claim or third-party claim of any kind or description, whether in law or in
equity, whether in contract or in tort or otherwise, against the Lenders in
any way relating

 



96  to this Agreement or any of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement,
including any dispute arising out of or relating in any way to the Debt
Commitment Letter, the Financing Agreements or the performance thereof, in
any forum other than the Supreme Court of the State of New York, County of New
York, or, if under applicable law exclusive jurisdiction is vested in the
federal courts, the United States District Court for the Southern District of
New York (and, in each case, appellate courts thereof). The parties hereto
further agree that all of the provisions of the preceding paragraph of this
_Section 13.14_ relating to waiver of jury trial shall apply to any
action, cause of action, claim, cross-claim or third party-claim referenced
in this paragraph. The provisions of this paragraph shall be enforceable by
each Lender, its Affiliates and their respective successors and permitted
assigns.

 

13.15. _Waiver of Conflicts; Confidentiality and Privilege_. Buyer (on behalf
of itself and its Affiliates) hereby irrevocably acknowledges and agrees
that: (a) Seller and its respective Affiliates shall each have the right to
retain the Designated Firm to represent their respective interests in any
Dispute arising under or in connection with this Agreement or
the transactions contemplated hereby, (b) Buyer (on behalf of itself and its
Affiliates) irrevocably waives, consents to and covenants not to assert any
objection, based on conflict of interest, to any representation of Seller or
any of its Affiliates by the Designated Firm prior to or after the Closing in
any Dispute by any Buyer Group Member against Seller or any of its Affiliates
in connection with this Agreement or the transactions contemplated hereby, (c)
all communications at or prior to Closing between any of Seller, the Company
Group Members or any of their respective Affiliates, managers, members,
officers or employees, on the one hand, and the Designated Firm, on the other
hand, made solely in connection with the negotiation, preparation, execution,
delivery and closing under, or any Dispute arising under or in connection
with, this Agreement (the " _Protected Seller Communications_ "), shall be
deemed to be privileged and confidential communications, (d) all rights to
such Protected Seller Communications, and the control of the confidentiality
and privilege applicable thereto, shall be retained by Seller and (e) to the
extent Buyer or any of its Affiliates should discover in its possession after
the Closing any Protected Seller Communications, it shall take reasonable
steps to preserve the confidentiality thereof and promptly deliver the same to
Seller, keeping no copies, and shall not by reason thereof assert any loss of
confidentiality or privilege protection.

13.16. _Disclaimer of Warranties_. Buyer acknowledges that none of Seller,
the Selling Entities, any Company, any Company Subsidiary, any Asset
Contributor or any other Person has made any representation or warranty,
express or implied, as to the financial projections, forecasts, cost estimates
and other predictions relating to the Companies, the Company Subsidiary or
the Asset Contributors delivered or made available to Buyer. EXCEPT AS TO
THOSE MATTERS EXPRESSLY COVERED BY THE REPRESENTATIONS AND WARRANTIES IN THIS
AGREEMENT OR THE SCHEDULES ATTACHED HERETO AND THE CERTIFICATE DELIVERED BY
SELLER PURSUANT TO THIS AGREEMENT, THE COMPANIES EQUITY, THE CONTRIBUTED
ASSETS AND THE BUSINESS, ASSETS AND LIABILITIES OF THE COMPANY GROUP ARE BEING
SOLD WITHOUT, AND SELLER EXPRESSLY DISCLAIMS ANY AND ALL OTHER, WARRANTIES,
REPRESENTATIONS AND GUARANTEES WHETHER EXPRESS OR IMPLIED. SELLER MAKES NO
REPRESENTATION OR WARRANTY AS TO MERCHANTABILITY OR FITNESS FOR ANY PARTICULAR
PURPOSE AND NO IMPLIED WARRANTIES WHATSOEVER.

 



97 13.17. _Independent Investigation_. Buyer acknowledges that it has conducted
its own independent investigation, review and analysis of the business,
assets and liabilities of the Company Group, and acknowledges that it has been
provided adequate access to the personnel, properties, assets, premises, books
and records, and other documents and data of Seller and the Company Group for
such purpose. Buyer acknowledges and agrees that: (a) in making its decision
to enter into this Agreement and to consummate the transactions contemplated
hereby, Buyer has relied solely upon its own investigation and the express
representations and warranties of Seller set forth in this Agreement; (b)
neither Seller nor any of its representatives nor any other Person has made
any representation nor warranty, express or implied, as to the accuracy or
completeness of any memoranda, charts, summaries or schedules heretofore made
available by Seller or its representatives to Buyer or any other information
except as expressly set forth in this Agreement, and (c) except in the case
of fraud, neither Seller nor any of its representatives nor any other Person
will have or be subject to any liability to Buyer, any Affiliate of Buyer or
any other Person (including the Confidential Information Memorandum and any
information, documents or material made available to Buyer in the Data Room,
management presentations or in any other form in expectation of the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement) resulting from the distribution
of any such information to, or use of any such information by, Buyer, any
Affiliate of Buyer or any of their agents, consultants, accountants, counsel
or other representatives. No Person is asserting the truth of any
representation and warranty set forth in this Agreement; rather the parties
have agreed that, other than in the case of fraud, if any representations and
warranties of any party prove untrue, the other party shall have the specific
rights and remedies herein specified as the exclusive remedy therefor, but
that no other rights, remedies or causes of action (whether in law or in
equity or whether in contract or in tort) are permitted to any party hereto as
a result of the untruth of any such representation and warranty.

 

13.18. _Specific Performance_. Each of the parties agrees that irreparable
damage would occur in the event that any of the provisions of this Agreement
to be performed by Buyer or Seller were not performed in accordance with their
specific terms or were otherwise breached. Accordingly, prior to any
termination of this Agreement pursuant to _Section 12.1_, each of Buyer
and Seller shall be entitled to seek specific performance of the terms
hereof, including an injunction or injunctions and any other equitable relief
to prevent breaches of this Agreement by the other Party, and to seek to
enforce specifically the terms and provisions of this Agreement in the U.S.
District Court in the District of Delaware, this being in addition to any
other remedy to which such party is entitled at law or in equity. Buyer and
Seller hereby waive (i) any defense in any action for an injunction, specific
performance and other equitable relief that a remedy at law would be adequate
and (ii) any requirements of applicable Requirements of Law to post security
as a prerequisite to obtaining equitable relief.

 

13.19. _Non-Recourse to Lenders_. Subject to the rights of the parties to the
Debt Commitment Letter under the terms of the Debt Commitment Letter, none of
the parties hereto, nor or any of their respective Affiliates, solely in their
respective capacities as parties to this Agreement, shall have any rights or
claims against any Lender, solely in their respective capacities as lenders
or arrangers in connection with the Debt Financing, and the Lenders, solely in
their respective capacities as lenders or arrangers, shall not have any rights
or claims against any party hereto or any related person thereof, in
connection with this Agreement or the Debt Financing, whether at law or
equity, in contract, in tort or otherwise.
