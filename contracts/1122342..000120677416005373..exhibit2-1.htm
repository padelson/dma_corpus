Certificates to the Paying Agent, and shall otherwise be in such form and have
such other provisions as the Purchaser or the Paying Agent may reasonably

each Book-Entry Share and, subject to the terms and conditions of this Agreement
and the procedures provided in the letter of transmittal, the Paying Agent shall
deliver the Merger Consideration that such holder is entitled to receive within
five (5) Business Days. Any Certificates and Book-Entry Shares so surrendered
shall forthwith be cancelled. If payment of the Merger Consideration is to be
made to a Person other than the Person in whose name any surrendered Certificate
is registered, it shall be a condition precedent of payment that the Certificate
so surrendered shall be properly endorsed or shall be otherwise in proper form

transfer and other similar Taxes required by reason of the payment of the Merger
Consideration to a Person other than the registered holder of the Certificate so
surrendered and shall have established to the satisfaction of the Surviving
Corporation that such Taxes either have been paid or are not required to be
