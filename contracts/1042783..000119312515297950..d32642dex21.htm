-vii- ACQUISITION AGREEMENT

 

THIS ACQUISITION AGREEMENT (this " _Agreement_ ") is made and entered into as
of August 18, 2015 by and among Seagate HDD Cayman, an exempted company with
limited liability organized under the laws of the Cayman Islands (" _Parent_
"), Denali Acquisition Sub Corp., a Delaware corporation and a wholly owned
subsidiary of Parent (" _Merger Sub_ "), and Dot Hill Systems Corp., a
Delaware corporation (the " _Company_ "). All capitalized terms that are used
in this Agreement but not defined herein shall have the respective meanings
ascribed thereto in _Annex A_. 

W I T N E S S E T H:

 

WHEREAS, Parent desires to acquire the Company on the terms and subject to the
conditions set forth in this Agreement.

 

WHEREAS, in order to effect the foregoing acquisition, Parent and the Company
have agreed that Merger Sub shall commence a tender offer (the " _Offer_ ")
to acquire all of the outstanding Company Shares at a price of $9.75 per
Company Share, net to the holder thereof in cash, without interest (such
amount, or any higher amount per Company Share that may be paid pursuant
to the Offer, being hereinafter referred to as the " _Offer Price_ "), all
upon the terms and subject to the conditions set forth herein.

 

WHEREAS, in order to complete the foregoing acquisition, following the
completion of the Offer, Merger Sub will be merged with and into the Company,
each Company Share (other than Canceled Company Shares or Dissenting Company
Shares) that is then outstanding will thereupon be cancelled and converted
into the right to receive cash in an amount equal to the Offer Price, and the
Company will survive the foregoing merger as a wholly owned subsidiary of
Parent, all upon the terms and subject to the conditions set forth herein.

 

WHEREAS, Parent and the Company acknowledge and agree that the Merger will be
governed by Section 251(h) of the DGCL and will be effected as soon as
practicable following the consummation of the Offer upon the terms and subject
to the conditions set forth herein.

WHEREAS, each of the respective Boards of Directors of Parent and Merger Sub
has approved this Agreement and the transactions contemplated hereby,
including the Offer and the Merger, all upon the terms and subject to the
conditions set forth herein.

 

WHEREAS, the Board of Directors of the Company has unanimously (i) determined
that this Agreement is advisable, (ii) determined that this Agreement and the
transactions contemplated hereby, including the Offer and the Merger, taken
together, are at a price and on terms that are fair to, and in the best
interests of the Company and the Company Stockholders (iii) approved
the execution, delivery and performance by the Company of this Agreement and
the transactions contemplated hereby, including the Offer and the Merger, (iv)
agreed that the Merger shall be governed by Section 251(h) of the DGCL,
and (v) resolved to recommend that the Company Stockholders tender their
shares to Merger Sub pursuant to the Offer, all upon the terms and subject to
the conditions set forth herein.

 



-1- WHEREAS, concurrently with the execution and delivery of this Agreement, as a
condition and inducement to the willingness of Parent and Merger Sub to enter
into this Agreement, certain stockholders of the Company, in their respective
capacities as stockholders of the Company, are entering into Support
Agreements with Parent (each, a " _Support Agreement_ " and collectively, the
" _Support Agreements_ ") pursuant to which the signatories thereto are
agreeing to tender their Company Shares into the Offer and to take (and
refrain from taking) certain other actions in connection with the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement.

NOW, THEREFORE, in consideration of the foregoing premises and the
representations, warranties, covenants and agreements set forth herein, as
well as other good and valuable consideration, the receipt and sufficiency of
which are hereby acknowledged and accepted, and intending to be legally
bound hereby, Parent, Merger Sub and the Company hereby agree as follows:

benefit of Parent and Merger Sub and, accordingly, Parent and Merger Sub may

time to time prior to the expiration of the Offer, in their sole and absolute
discretion. The failure by Parent and Merger Sub at any time to exercise the
foregoing right to waive any Offer Condition (other than the Minimum

from time to time.

(iii) in the event that the condition set forth in _Section 1.1(b)(iv)_ or

the Minimum Condition shall not have been satisfied as of such scheduled
Expiration Date, Merger Sub shall (and Parent shall cause Merger Sub to)
extend the Offer for one extension period of ten (10) Business Days in order
to seek to satisfy the Minimum Condition.

_provided, however_ , that notwithstanding the foregoing clauses (i) - (v) of
this  _Section 1.1(e)_, inclusive, in no event shall Merger Sub be required
to (or permitted to, without the prior written consent of the Company) extend
the Offer beyond the First Termination Date or the Extended Termination Date,
as applicable; and _provided further_ , that the foregoing clauses (i) - (v)
of this _Section 1.1(e)_, inclusive, shall not be deemed to impair, limit or
otherwise restrict in any manner the right of Parent to terminate

that the Offer Documents, when filed with the SEC, comply in all material
respects with the applicable requirements of the Exchange Act and, on the date
first published, sent or given to the Company Stockholders, do not contain any
untrue statement of a material fact or omit to state any material fact
required to be stated therein or necessary in order to make the statements
therein, in light of the circumstances under which they were made, not
misleading. The Company shall ensure that the information supplied by the

14D-9, when filed with the SEC, complies in all material respects with the
applicable requirements of the Exchange Act and, on the date first published,
sent or given to the Company Stockholders, does not contain any untrue

(b) _Company Board Recommendation_.

 

(i) The Company hereby approves and consents to the Offer and represents that
the Company Board, at a meeting duly called and held on or prior to the date
of this Agreement, has unanimously made the Company Board Recommendation.
Subject to the terms of this _Section 1.2(b)_, the Company Board shall (A)
unanimously recommend that the Company Stockholders accept the Offer and
tender their Company Shares to Merger Sub pursuant to the Offer (the "
_Company Board Recommendation_ ") and (B) include the Company Board
Recommendation (with respect to the Offer) in the Schedule 14D-9 and (C)
permit Parent and Merger Sub to include a description of the Company Board
Recommendation in the Offer Documents if and to the extent that the Company
Board Recommendation is not withheld, withdrawn, amended or modified in
accordance with this _Section 1.2(b)_.

(ii) Subject to the terms of this _Section 1.2(b)_, neither the
Company Board nor any committee thereof shall (A) fail to make, withhold,
withdraw, amend, qualify or modify, or publicly propose to refuse to make,
withhold, withdraw, amend, qualify or modify, the Company Board
Recommendation, (B) approve, endorse or recommend an Acquisition Proposal, or
fail to publicly recommend against any Acquisition Proposal that is a tender
offer or exchange offer for Company Shares within ten (10) Business Days after
commencement of such offer or fail to reaffirm the Company Board
Recommendation within such ten (10) Business Day-period, (C) fail to include
the Company Board Recommendation in the Schedule 14D-9, (D) fail to reaffirm
the Company Board Recommendation within three (3) Business Days of a written
request to do so by Parent (provided that, unless an Acquisition Proposal
shall have been publicly disclosed, Parent may only make two (2) such
requests), or (E) resolve, agree or publicly propose to take any of the
foregoing actions (any action described in the preceding clauses (A)  (E)
being referred to herein as a " _Company Board Recommendation Change_ ");
_provided, however_ , that notwithstanding the foregoing, a "stop, look and
listen" communication by the Company Board pursuant to and in compliance with
Rule 14d9-(f) of the Exchange Act shall not be deemed to be a Company Board
Recommendation Change and shall not require compliance with the procedures
set forth in this _Section 1.2(b)_. For avoidance of doubt, a termination of
this Agreement by the Company pursuant to _Section 7.1(h)_ shall not
constitute a Company Board Recommendation Change, and any Company Board
Recommendation Change effected simultaneously with such termination shall not
require a separate notice period under _Section 1.2(b)(iii)_ below.

 



-10- (iii) Notwithstanding the limitations set forth in  _Section 1.2(b)(ii)_,
the Company Board may effect a Company Board Recommendation Change at any time
prior to the Acceptance Time, if (A) the Company Board has received an
unsolicited, _bona fide,_ written Acquisition Proposal and after consultation
with a financial advisor of nationally recognized standing and outside legal
counsel, the Company Board shall have determined, in good faith, that such
Acquisition Proposal constitutes a Superior Proposal, (B) such Acquisition
Proposal did not arise out of a breach of the provisions of this _Section
1.2(b)_ or _Section 6.1_, (C) the Company Board has determined in good faith
(after consultation with outside legal counsel and after considering in good
faith any proposal made by Parent pursuant to clause (E) below), that, in
light of the foregoing Superior Proposal, the Company Board is reasonably
required to effect a Company Board Recommendation Change in order to
comply with its fiduciary duties to the Company Stockholders under Delaware
Law, (D) prior to effecting such Company Board Recommendation Change, the
Company Board shall have given Parent at least five (5) Business Days prior
written notice thereof (a " _Determination Notice_ ") (which Determination
Notice shall not constitute a Company Board Recommendation Change), which
Determination Notice shall attach such Superior Proposal and all Contracts and
other written materials provided by the Person making such Superior Proposal
(including any definitive agreements and financing commitment letters relating
thereto), and the opportunity to meet (which may be telephonic) with the
Company Board (or its designees) and its outside legal counsel during such
five-Business Day period, with the purpose and intent of enabling Parent and
the Company to discuss in good faith a modification of the terms and
conditions of this Agreement so that the Acquisition Proposal that is the
subject of the foregoing Determination Notice is no longer a Superior Proposal
(it being understood and agreed that in the event of any material amendment to
any Acquisition Proposal that is the subject of a previously delivered
Determination Notice, the Company Board shall not be permitted to effect a
Company Board Recommendation Change with respect to such Acquisition Proposal,
as so amended, unless and until the Company shall have given Parent another
Determination Notice based on such Acquisition Proposal, as so amended, at
least three (3) Business Days prior to effecting such Company Board
Recommendation Change on the basis of such Acquisition Proposal, as so
amended, and the opportunity to meet (which may be telephonic) with the
Company Board (or its designees) and its outside legal counsel during such
three-Business Day period), and (E) Parent shall not have made, within five
(5) Business Days after receipt of the Determination Notice referenced in the
preceding clause (D) (or within three (3) Business Days in the event of a
material amendment to the Acquisition Proposal that is the subject of a
previously delivered Determination Notice), a proposal for a transaction
on the basis of which the Acquisition Proposal that is the subject of the
Determination Notice referenced in the preceding clause (D) no longer
constitutes a Superior Proposal relative to any transaction proposed by Parent
and; (F) after the expiration of the five-Business Day period referenced in
the preceding clauses (D) and (E) (or the three-Business Day period in the
event of a material

 



-11-  amendment to the Acquisition Proposal that is the subject of a previously
delivered Determination Notice) the Company Board determines in good faith
(after consultation with its outside legal counsel) that it is still
reasonably required to effect a Company Board Recommendation Change in respect
of the Acquisition Proposal that is the subject of the Determination Notice
referenced in the preceding clause (D) in order to comply with its fiduciary
duties to the Company Stockholders under Delaware Law after considering in
good faith any proposals made by Parent during the five-Business Day period
referenced in the preceding clauses (D) and (E) (or the three-Business
Day period in the event of a material amendment to the amendment to the
Acquisition Proposal that is the subject of a previously delivered
Determination Notice). The Company shall keep confidential any such proposals
made by Parent to revise the terms of this Agreement, whether pursuant to
this _Section 1.2(b)_, _Section 7.1(h)_ or otherwise, other than in the
event of any amendment to this Agreement and to the extent required to be
disclosed in any SEC Reports.

 

(iv) Notwithstanding the limitations set forth in _Section 1.2(b)(ii)_, the
Company Board may effect a Company Board Recommendation Change at any time
prior to the Acceptance Time in response to an Intervening Event if (A) the
Company Board shall have determined in good faith (after consultation with
outside legal counsel) that, in light of such Intervening Event, the Company
Board is reasonably required to effect a Company Board Recommendation Change
in order to comply with its fiduciary duties to the Company Stockholders under
Delaware Law, (B) prior to effecting such Company Board Recommendation
Change, the Company Board shall have given Parent a Determination Notice at
least five (5) Business Days prior written notice thereof, which Determination
Notice shall specify in reasonable detail the facts underlying the
Company Boards determination that an Intervening Event has occurred and the
rationale and basis for such Company Board Recommendation Change and the
opportunity to meet (which may be telephonic) with the Company Board (or its
designees) and its outside legal counsel, with the purpose and intent of
enabling Parent and the Company to discuss in good faith a modification of the
terms and conditions of this Agreement so as to obviate the need to effect a
Company Board Recommendation Change on the basis of such Intervening Event so
that the transactions contemplated hereby may be effected, and (C) following
the expiration of such five (5) Business Day period, the Company Board shall
have determined in good faith (after consultation with outside legal counsel)
and after giving good faith consideration to any offer or proposal from
Parent, that, in light of such Intervening Event, the Company Board is
reasonably required to effect a Company Board Recommendation Change in order
to comply with its fiduciary duties to the Company Stockholders under Delaware
Law.

(v) Nothing in this Agreement shall prohibit the Company Board from taking
and disclosing to the Company Stockholders a position contemplated by Rule
14e-2(a) under the Exchange Act or complying with the provisions of Rule 14d-9
promulgated under the Exchange Act or making any

 



-12-  "stop, look and listen" communication by the Company Board pursuant to and
in compliance with Rule 14d9-(f), _provided_ , _however_ , that any
statement(s) made by the Company Board pursuant to Rule 14e-2(a) under the
Exchange Act or Rule 14d-9 under the Exchange Act shall be deemed to be a
Company Board Recommendation Change unless accompanied by a clear,

beneficial Company Stockholders as of the most recent practicable date, and

pursuant to _Article VII_, Parent and Merger Sub shall either, in Parents
sole discretion, (A) destroy any and all copies and any extracts or summaries

unvested shares, if any, that may be held by Persons pursuant to the grant of
restricted stock purchase rights or following exercise of employee stock
options.

-14- 2.3 _The Surviving Corporation_.

 

(a) _Certificate of Incorporation and Bylaws_.

 

(i) _Certificate of Incorporation_. At the Effective Time, the Certificate of
Incorporation of the Company shall be amended and restated in its entirety to
read identically to the Certificate of Incorporation of Merger Sub, as in
effect immediately prior to the Effective Time, and such amended and restated
Certificate of Incorporation shall become the Certificate of Incorporation of
the Surviving Corporation until thereafter amended in accordance with the
applicable provisions of Delaware Law and such Certificate of Incorporation;
_provided, however_ , that at the Effective Time the Certificate
of Incorporation of the Surviving Corporation shall be amended so that the
name of the Surviving Corporation shall be "Dot Hill Systems Corp."

 

(ii) _Bylaws_. At the Effective Time, the Bylaws of Merger Sub, as in effect
immediately prior to the Effective Time, shall become the Bylaws of the
Surviving Corporation until thereafter amended in accordance with the
applicable provisions of Delaware Law, the Certificate of Incorporation of the
Surviving Corporation and such Bylaws.

 

(b) _Directors and Officers_.

 

(i) _Directors_. At the Effective Time, the initial directors of the Surviving
Corporation shall be the directors of Merger Sub immediately prior to the
Effective Time, each to hold office in accordance with the Certificate of
Incorporation and Bylaws of the Surviving Corporation until their respective
successors are duly elected or appointed and qualified.

 

(ii) _Officers_. At the Effective Time, the initial officers of the Surviving
Corporation shall be the officers of Merger Sub immediately prior to the
Effective Time, each to hold office in accordance with the Certificate of
Incorporation and Bylaws of the Surviving Corporation until their respective
successors are duly appointed.

 

2.4 _General Effects of the Merger_. At the Effective Time, the effect of the

of Delaware Law. Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, and subject
thereto, at the Effective Time, all of the property, rights, privileges,

2.5 _Effect of the Merger on Capital Stock of the Constituent Corporations_.

conditions set forth in this Agreement, at the Effective Time, by virtue of
the Merger and without any action on the part of Parent, Merger Sub, the
Company, or the holders of any of the following securities, each share of
common stock, par value $0.01 per share, of Merger Sub that is issued and
outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time shall be converted into
one (1) validly issued, fully paid and non-assessable share of common stock of
the Surviving

 



-15-  Corporation. Each certificate evidencing ownership of such shares of common
stock of Merger Sub shall thereafter evidence ownership of shares of common
stock of the Surviving Corporation.

 

(b) _Capital Stock of the Company_.

 

(i) _Company Shares_. Upon the terms and subject to the conditions set forth
in this Agreement, at the Effective Time, by virtue of the Merger and without
any action on the part of Parent, Merger Sub, the Company, or the holders of
any of the following securities, the following shall occur: each Company Share
issued and outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time (other than
Canceled Company Shares and Dissenting Company Shares) shall be canceled and
extinguished and automatically converted into the right to receive cash in an
amount equal to the Offer Price, without interest thereon (the " _Merger
Consideration_ "); _provided, however_ , that the Merger Consideration shall
be automatically adjusted to reflect the effect of any stock split, reverse
stock split, stock dividend (including any dividend or distribution of
securities convertible into Company Shares), cash dividends, reorganization,
recapitalization, reclassification, combination, exchange of shares or other
like change with respect to Company Shares occurring on or after the date
hereof and prior to the Effective Time. From and after the Effective Time,
all Company Shares shall no longer be outstanding and shall automatically be
cancelled, extinguished and cease to exist, and each holder of a Certificate
or Book-Entry Share theretofore representing any Company Shares (other than
Dissenting Company Shares) shall cease to have any rights with respect
thereto, except the right to receive the Merger Consideration payable therefor
upon the surrender or transfer thereof in accordance with the provisions of
_Section 2.6_. The Merger Consideration paid in accordance with the terms of
this _Article II_ shall be deemed to have been paid in full satisfaction of
all rights pertaining to such Company Shares. From and after the Effective
Time, there shall be no further registration of transfers on the records of
the Surviving Corporation of Company Shares that were issued and outstanding
immediately prior to the Effective Time, other than transfers to reflect, in
accordance with customary settlement procedures, trades effected prior to the
Effective Time, and if, after the Effective Time, Certificates or Book-Entry
Shares are presented to the Surviving Corporation for any reason, they shall
be canceled and exchanged as provided in this _Article II_.

(ii) _Company Restricted Stock_. Holders of Company Restricted Stock shall be
treated the same as holders of Company Shares; _provided, however_ , that each
share of Company Restricted Stock that is outstanding and unvested as of
immediately prior to the Effective Time (after giving effect to any
acceleration of vesting that occurs at or prior to the Effective Time as a
result of the consummation of the Merger) shall be converted into the right to
receive the consideration set forth in _Section 2.5(b)(i)_, which shall be
subject to, and payable to the holder of such Company Restricted Stock, in
accordance with and subject to the vesting schedule, right of repurchase and
forfeiture provisions applicable to such Company Restricted Stock as in effect
immediately prior to the Effective Time.

 



-16- (iii) _Canceled Company Shares_. Upon the terms and subject to the conditions
set forth in this Agreement, at the Effective Time, by virtue of the Merger
and without any action on the part of Parent, Merger Sub, the Company, or the
holders of any of the following securities, each Company Share that is owned
by Parent, Merger Sub or the Company, or by any direct or indirect wholly
owned Subsidiary of Parent, Merger Sub or the Company, in each case
immediately prior to the Effective Time (whether pursuant to the Offer or
otherwise) (" _Canceled Company Shares_ ") shall be cancelled and
extinguished without any conversion thereof or consideration paid therefor.

 

(iv) _Dissenting Company Shares_.

 

(A) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary set forth in this Agreement, all
Company Shares that are issued and outstanding immediately prior to the
Effective Time and held by stockholders who shall have properly and validly
exercised their statutory rights of appraisal in respect of such Company
Shares in accordance with Section 262 of the DGCL (collectively, "
_Dissenting Company Shares_ ") shall not be converted into, or represent the
right to receive, the Merger Consideration pursuant to this _Section 2.5_.
Such stockholders shall be entitled to receive payment of the appraised value
of such Dissenting Company Shares in accordance with the provisions of Section
262 of the DGCL, except that all Dissenting Company Shares held by
stockholders who shall have failed to perfect or who shall have effectively
withdrawn or lost their rights to appraisal of such Dissenting Company Shares
under such Section 262 of the DGCL shall thereupon be deemed to have been
converted into, and to have become exchangeable for, as of the Effective Time,
the right to receive the Merger Consideration, without any interest thereon,
upon surrender of the certificate or certificates that formerly evidenced such
Company Shares in the manner provided in _Section 2.6_.

 

(B) The Company shall give Parent (1) prompt notice of any demands for
appraisal received by the Company, withdrawals of such demands, and any other
instruments served pursuant to Delaware Law and received by the Company in
respect of Dissenting Company Shares and (2) the opportunity and right (at
Parents election) to direct and control all negotiations and proceedings
with respect to demands for appraisal under Delaware Law in respect of
Dissenting Company Shares. The Company shall not, except with the prior
written consent of Parent, voluntarily make any payment with respect to any
demands for appraisal or settle or offer to settle any such demands for
payment in respect of Dissenting Company Shares.

 



-17- 2.6 _Payment of Merger Consideration_.

 

(a) _Payment Agent_. Prior to the Effective Time, Parent shall select a bank
or trust company reasonably acceptable to the Company to act as the payment
agent for the Merger (the " _Payment Agent_ ").

(b) _Exchange Fund_. On or prior to the Effective Time, Parent shall deposit
(or cause to be deposited) the aggregate Merger Consideration with the Payment
Agent, for payment to the Company Stockholders pursuant to the provisions of
this _Article II_ (such cash amount being referred to herein as the "
_Exchange Fund_ ").

(c) _Payment Procedures_. Promptly following the Effective Time (but in no
event later than five (5) Business Days thereafter), Parent and Merger Sub
shall cause the Payment Agent to mail to each holder of record (as of
immediately prior to the Effective Time) of a certificate or certificates (the
" _Certificates_ ") or non-certificated Company Shares represented by book-
entry (" _Book-Entry Shares_ "), which immediately prior to the Effective Time
represented outstanding Company Shares (other than Canceled Company Shares and
Dissenting Company Shares) (i) a letter of transmittal in customary form
(which shall specify that delivery shall be effected, and risk of loss and
title to the Certificates shall pass, only upon delivery of the Certificates
or transfer of the Book-Entry Shares to the Payment Agent) and (ii)
instructions for use in effecting the surrender of the Certificates or
transfer of Book-Entry Shares in exchange for the Merger Consideration payable
in respect thereof pursuant to the provisions of this  _Article II_. Upon
(i) surrender of Certificates for cancellation to the Payment Agent or to such
other agent or agents as may be appointed by Parent, together with such letter
of transmittal, duly completed and validly executed in accordance with the
instructions thereto, or (ii) receipt of an "agents message" by the Payment
Agent (or such other evidence, if any, of the transfer as the Payment Agent
may reasonably request) in the case of a transfer of Book-Entry Shares, the
holders of such Certificates or Book-Entry Shares shall be entitled to receive
in exchange therefor the Merger Consideration payable in respect thereof
pursuant to the provisions of this _Article II_, and the Certificates so
surrendered or Book-Entry Shares so transferred shall forthwith be canceled.
The Payment Agent shall accept such Certificates or Book-Entry Shares upon
compliance with such reasonable terms and conditions as the Payment Agent
may impose to effect an orderly exchange thereof in accordance with normal
exchange practices. No interest shall be paid or accrued for the benefit of
holders of the Certificates or Book-Entry Shares on the Merger Consideration
payable upon the surrender of such Certificates or transfer of Book-Entry
Shares pursuant to this _Section 2.6_. Until so surrendered or transferred,
outstanding Certificates or Book-Entry Shares shall be deemed from and after
the Effective Time, to evidence only the right to receive the Merger
Consideration payable in respect thereof pursuant to the provisions of this
_Article II_.

 

(d) _Transfers of Ownership_. In the event that a transfer of ownership of
Company Shares is not registered in the stock transfer books or ledger of the
Company, or if Merger Consideration is to be paid in a name other than that in
which the surrendered Certificate or transferred Book-Entry Shares are
registered in the stock transfer books or ledger of the Company, the
Merger Consideration may be paid to a Person other than the Person in whose
name the surrendered Certificate or transferred Book-Entry Shares are
registered in the stock transfer books or ledger of the Company only if such
Certificate is properly endorsed and otherwise in proper form for surrender
and transfer or such Book-Entry Shares are properly transferred and the Person
requesting such payment has paid to Parent (or any agent designated

 



-18-  by Parent) any transfer or other Taxes required by reason of the payment of
Merger Consideration to a Person other than the registered holder of such
Certificate or Book-Entry Share, or established to the satisfaction of Parent
(or any agent designated by Parent) that such transfer or other Taxes have
been paid or are otherwise not payable.

 

(e) _Lost, Stolen or Destroyed Certificates_. In the event that any
Certificates shall have been lost, stolen or destroyed, the Payment Agent
shall issue in exchange for such lost, stolen or destroyed Certificates, upon
the making of an affidavit of that fact by the holder thereof, the Merger
Consideration payable in respect thereof pursuant to this _Article II_; 
_provided, however_ , that Parent may, in its discretion and as a condition
precedent to the payment of such Merger Consideration, require the owners of
such lost, stolen or destroyed Certificates to deliver a bond in such sum as
it may reasonably direct as indemnity against any claim that may be made
against Parent, the Surviving Corporation or the Payment Agent with respect to
the Certificates alleged to have been lost, stolen or destroyed.

 

(f) _Required Withholding_. Each of the Payment Agent, Merger Sub, Parent and
the Surviving Corporation shall be entitled to deduct and withhold from any
amounts payable pursuant to this Agreement such amounts as are required to be
deducted or withheld therefrom under applicable Law. To the extent that such
amounts are so deducted or withheld and properly remitted to the
appropriate Governmental Authority in accordance with applicable Law, such
amounts shall be treated for all purposes under this Agreement as having been
paid to the Person to whom such amounts would otherwise have been paid.

 

(g) _No Liability_. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary set forth in this
Agreement, none of the Payment Agent, Parent, the Surviving Corporation or
any other party hereto shall be liable to a holder of Company Shares for any
amount properly paid to a public official pursuant to any applicable abandoned
property, escheat or similar Law.

 

(h) _Distribution of Exchange Fund to Parent_. Any portion of the Exchange
Fund that remains undistributed to the holders of the Certificates or Book-
Entry Shares on the date that is twelve (12) months after the Effective Time
shall be delivered to Parent (or its designee) upon demand, and any Company
Stockholders who have not theretofore surrendered their Certificates or
transferred their Book-Entry Shares evidencing such Company Shares for
exchange pursuant to the provisions of this _Section 2.6_ shall thereafter
look for payment of the Merger Consideration payable in respect of the Company
Shares evidenced by such Certificates or Book-Entry Shares solely to Parent,
as general creditors thereof, for any claim to the applicable Merger
Consideration to which such holders may be entitled pursuant to the provisions
of this _Article II_. 

2.7 _Necessary Further Action_. In the event that, at any time from and after
the Effective Time, any further action is necessary or desirable to carry out
the purposes of this Agreement and to vest the Surviving Corporation with full
right, title and possession to all assets, property, rights, privileges,
powers and franchises of the Company and Merger Sub, the directors and
officers of the Surviving Corporation shall take all such lawful and necessary
action on behalf of the Company and Merger Sub to accomplish the foregoing.
From and after the Effective Time, the directors and officers of the
Surviving Corporation shall be authorized to execute and deliver, in the name
and on behalf of the Company or Merger Sub, any deeds, bills

 



-19-  of sale, assignments or assurances and to take and do, in the name and on
behalf of the Company or Merger Sub, any other actions and things to vest,
perfect or confirm of record or otherwise in the Surviving Corporation any
and all right, title and interest in, to and under any of the rights,
properties or assets of the Company acquired or to be acquired by the
Surviving Corporation as a result of, or in connection with, the Merger.

 

ARTICLE III

 

REPRESENTATIONS AND WARRANTIES

 

OF THE COMPANY

Except as (a) expressly set forth in the disclosure schedule delivered by the
Company to Parent on the date of this Agreement immediately prior to the
execution hereof (the " _Company Disclosure Schedule_ "), which disclosure
shall be deemed to qualify or provide disclosure in response to (i) the
specific section or subsection of this _Article III_ that specifically
corresponds to the section or subsection of the Company Disclosure Schedule in
which any such disclosure is set forth, and/or (ii) any other section or
subsection of this _Article III_ solely to the extent that it is readily
apparent from the text of such disclosure (without reference to the underlying
documents referenced therein and without assuming any knowledge of the
matters disclosed) that such disclosure is applicable to such other section or
subsection of this _Article III_ or (b) as disclosed in the Companys Annual
Reports on Form 10-K for the fiscal years ended December 31, 2013 and
December 31, 2014 (the " _2014 10-K_ "), the Companys proxy statements on
Schedule 14A for its 2014 and 2015 annual stockholder meetings, and any
Quarterly Reports on Form 10-Q or Current Reports on Form 8-K filed
subsequent to the 2014 10-K and prior to the date of this Agreement (other
than any information in the "Risk Factors" or "Forward-Looking Statements"
sections of such filings by the Company with the SEC or any other forward-
looking statements in such filings), the Company hereby represents and
warrants to Parent and Merger Sub as follows:

 

3.1 _Organization and Good Standing_.

 

(a) The Company is a corporation duly organized, validly existing and in good
standing under Delaware Law. The Company has the requisite power and
authority to carry on its respective business as it is presently being
conducted and to own, lease or operate its respective properties and assets.
The Company is duly qualified to do business and is in good standing in each
jurisdiction where the character of its properties owned or leased or the
nature of its activities make such qualification necessary (to the extent the
"good standing" concept is applicable in the case of any jurisdiction outside
the United States), except where the failure to be so qualified or in good
standing would not, individually or in the aggregate, have or reasonably be
expected to have a Company Material Adverse Effect. The Company has delivered
or made available to Parent true, correct and complete copies of the
certificates of incorporation and bylaws, as amended to date, of the Company.
The Company is not in violation of its certificate of incorporation or bylaws,
except for such violations that would not, individually or in the aggregate,
(i) be or reasonably be expected to be, material to business, operations,
properties, assets, liabilities, condition (financial or otherwise) or results
of operations of the Company and its Subsidiaries, taken together as a whole,
or (ii) reasonably be expected to materially impede the ability of the
Company to consummate the transactions contemplated by this Agreement
(including the Offer and the Merger) in accordance with the terms hereof and
applicable Law.

 

(b) Except as set forth in _Section 3.1(b)_ of the Company Disclosure
Schedules, the Company has delivered or made available to Parent true,
correct and complete (in all material respects) copies of the minutes (or, in
the case of draft minutes, the most recent drafts thereof) of all meetings,
and any action taken by written consent, of the Company Stockholders, the
Company Board and each committee of the Company Board, in each case occurring
at any time on or after January 1, 2011.

 



-20- 3.2 _Authorization and Enforceability_.

 

(a) The Company has all requisite power and authority to execute and deliver
this Agreement and to consummate the transactions contemplated hereby and to
perform its obligations hereunder.

(b) The execution and delivery of this Agreement by the Company and the
consummation by the Company of the transactions contemplated hereby
(including the Offer and the Merger) have been duly authorized by all
necessary corporate action on the part of the Company and no additional
corporate proceedings on the part of the Company are necessary to authorize
this Agreement or the consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby
(including the Offer and the Merger). The affirmative vote of the holders of a
majority of the issued and outstanding Company Shares is the only vote of the
holders of any class or series of Company capital stock that, absent Section
251(h) of the DGCL, would have been necessary under applicable Law and the
Companys certificate of incorporation and bylaws to adopt, approve or
authorize this Agreement and consummate the Merger.

(c) At a meeting duly called and held prior to the execution of this
Agreement, the Company Board has, upon the terms and subject to the
conditions set forth herein, (i) unanimously determined that this Agreement is
advisable, (ii) unanimously determined that this Agreement and the
transactions contemplated hereby, including the Offer and the Merger, taken
together, are at a price and on terms that are fair to, and in the best
interests of the Company and the Company Stockholders, (iii) unanimously
approved this Agreement and the transactions contemplated hereby, including
the Offer and the Merger, and the Support Agreements, and (iv) unanimously
resolved to make the Company Board Recommendation.

 

(d) The Company Board has received the opinions of (i) Morgan Stanley and Co.
LLC to the effect that, as of the date of such opinion, and based upon and
subject to the assumptions, qualifications, matters and limitations set forth
therein, the consideration to be received by the holders of the Company Shares
(other than Canceled Company Shares and Dissenting Company Shares) pursuant
to this Agreement is fair from a financial point of view to such holders, and
(ii) Needham and Company to the effect that, as of the date of such opinions and
based on and subject to the various assumptions made, procedures followed,
matters considered and limitations on the review undertaken in preparing the
opinions as set forth therein, the consideration of $9.75 per Company Share to
be paid to the holders of the Company Shares (other than holders of Cancelled
Company Shares (as defined in the opinion) and Dissenting

 



-21-  Company Shares (as defined in the opinion) and affiliates of Parent)
pursuant to this Agreement, is fair, from a financial point of view, to such
holders. As of the date of this Agreement, such opinions have not been
withdrawn, revoked or modified. The Company shall deliver or make available to
Parent, solely for informational purposes, copies of the signed opinions as
soon as possible following the date of this Agreement.

 

(e) Assuming that the representations of Parent and Merger Sub set forth in
_Section 4.6_ are accurate, the Company Board has taken all necessary
actions so that the restrictions on business combinations set forth in Section
203 of the DGCL and any other similar applicable Law are not applicable to
this Agreement and the transactions contemplated hereby (including the
Offer and the Merger) or the Support Agreements or the transactions
contemplated thereby. No other state takeover statute or similar statute or
regulation applies to or purports to apply to the Offer, the Merger, the
Support Agreements or the transactions contemplated hereby or thereby.

(f) At a meeting duly called and held at which all members of the Compensation
Committee of the Company Board (the " _Compensation Committee_ ") were
present, the Compensation Committee (i) duly and unanimously adopted
resolutions approving as an "employment compensation, severance or other
employee benefit arrangement" within the meaning of Rule 14d-10(d)(1) under
the Exchange Act, (A) each Company Stock Plan, (B) the treatment of Company
Options and Company Restricted Stock, in accordance with the terms set forth
in this Agreement, the applicable Company Stock Plan and any applicable
Employee Plan, (C) the terms of _Sections 6.9_ and _6.10_ , (D) each other
Employee Plan that under the terms of this Agreement is required to be set
forth in _Sections 3.17(a)(i)_ and  _3.17(a)(ii)_ of the Company Disclosure
Schedule which resolutions have not been rescinded, modified or withdrawn in
any way, (E) each compensation arrangement entered into by the Company or any
of its Subsidiaries with an executive officer of the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries, as applicable, within in one (1) year prior to the date of this
Agreement, (F) any compensation arrangement entered into by the Company or any
of its Subsidiaries on the date of this Agreement, and (G) the treatment of
Company Restricted Stock pursuant to _Section 2.5(b)(ii)_ of this Agreement,
and (ii) has taken all other actions necessary to satisfy the requirements of
the no-exclusive safe harbor under Rule 14d-10(d)(2) under the Exchange Act
with respect to the foregoing arrangements. A true and complete copy of the
draft resolutions of the Compensation Committee reflecting any approvals and
actions referred to in the preceding sentence has been provided to Parent and
Merger Sub prior to execution of this Agreement. Each member of the
Compensation Committee is an "independent director" within the meaning of the
requirements of Rule 14d-10(d) under the Exchange Act.

(g) This Agreement has been duly executed and delivered by the Company and,
assuming the due authorization, execution and delivery by Parent and Merger
Sub, constitutes a legal, valid and binding obligation of the Company,
enforceable against the Company in accordance with its terms, except that
such enforceability (i) may be limited by applicable bankruptcy, insolvency,
reorganization, moratorium and other similar laws affecting or relating to
creditors rights generally and (ii) is subject to rules of law
governing specific performance, injunctive relief and other equitable
remedies and general principles of equity.

 



-22- 3.3 _Required Governmental Consents_. No consent, approval, Order or
authorization of, or filing or registration with, or notification to (any of
the foregoing being a " _Consent_ "), any Governmental Authority is required
on the part of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries in connection with the
execution, delivery and performance by the Company of this Agreement and the
consummation by the Company of the transactions contemplated hereby (including
the Offer and the Merger), except (a) the filing and recordation of the
Certificate of Merger with the Secretary of State of the State of Delaware
and such filings with Governmental Authorities to satisfy the Laws of states
in which the Company and its Subsidiaries are qualified to do business, (b)
such filings and approvals as may be required by any federal or state
securities laws, including compliance with any applicable requirements of the
Exchange Act, (c) compliance with any applicable requirements of the HSR Act
and (d) such other Consents, the failure of which to obtain would not,
individually or in the aggregate, (i) be or reasonably be expected to be,
materially adverse to business, operations, properties, assets, liabilities,
condition (financial or otherwise) or results of operations of the Company and
its Subsidiaries, taken together as a whole, or (ii) would or would
reasonably be expected to materially impede the ability of the Company to
consummate the transactions contemplated by this Agreement (including the
Offer and the Merger) in accordance with the terms hereof and applicable Law.
The Company has not opted out of Section 251(h) of the DGCL in the Company
Certificate or taken any other action to preclude the Merger from being
effected in accordance with Section 251(h) of the DGCL.

3.4 _Conflicts_. The execution, delivery or performance by the Company of this
Agreement, the consummation by the Company of the transactions contemplated
hereby (including the Offer and the Merger) and the compliance by the Company
with any of the provisions hereof do not and will not (a) violate or conflict

to have been misclassified as exempt or non-exempt, as the case may be, under
the Fair Labor Standards Act or other applicable Laws in a manner that would
result in any material liability to the Company and its Subsidiaries, taken as
a whole.

 

(e) Neither the Company nor any Subsidiary has taken any action which would
constitute a "plant closing" or "mass layoff" within the meaning of the WARN
Act or similar foreign, state or local applicable Law, issued any notification
of a plant closing or mass layoff required by the WARN Act or similar foreign,
state or local applicable Law, or incurred any liability or obligation under
WARN or any similar foreign, state or local applicable Law that remains
unsatisfied. No terminations prior to the Closing would trigger any notice or
other obligations under the WARN Act or similar foreign, state or local
applicable Law.

(f) _Section 3.18(f)(i)_ of the Company Disclosure Schedule contains a
complete and accurate list, as of the date hereof, of (i) the name of each
current employee and consultant currently providing services to the Company or
any of its Subsidiaries and the country (and state, for those located in the
U.S.) in which each such employee and consultant is based and primarily
performs his or her duties or services (except where the disclosure of such
information would be prohibited by data privacy/protection Laws without the
employees or consultants consent, in which case an employee ID number
shall be provided), and (ii) each such persons position or function, annual
base salary or wages or consulting fees and, with respect to employees,
vacation entitlement, service date, benefit entitlement and any incentives or
bonus arrangement with respect to such person, a description of any
employment contract (including any oral contract) with such parties,
applicable termination rules and any change of control provisions contained in
any employment contract.  _Section 3.18(f)(ii)_ of the Company Disclosure
Schedule contains a list of the countries, which does not include the U.S., in
which data privacy/protection Laws prohibit the disclosure of information in
this Section without the employees or consultants consent. As of the date
hereof, no Key Employee has terminated or has advised the Company or any of
its Subsidiaries of his or her intention to terminate his or her relationship
or status as a Key Employee of the Company or its Subsidiaries for any
reason,

 



-43-  including because of the consummation of the transactions contemplated
hereby, and, as of the date hereof, the Company and its Subsidiaries have no
plans or intentions, as of the date hereof, to terminate any such Key
Employee.

3.19 _Real Property_.

 

(a) Neither the Company nor any of its Subsidiaries owns or has ever owned any
real property, nor is any party to any agreement to purchase or sell any real
property.

(b) _Section 3.19(b)_ of the Company Disclosure Schedule contains a complete
and accurate list of all real property currently leased, used, or occupied by
the Company or any Subsidiary (" _Leased Real Property_ ") and each of the
leases, subleases, licenses, or other agreements (collectively, the " _Leases_
") to which the Company or any Subsidiary is a party, including, with respect
to each Lease, the name of the lessor, master and sublessor, the date of the
Lease and each amendment thereto, the expiration date, and the aggregate
annual rental payable to the lessor thereunder. The Company has heretofore
made available to Parent true, correct and complete copies of all Leases
(including all modifications, amendments, supplements, consents, waivers and
side letters thereto and all agreements in connection therewith, and all work
letters, improvement agreements, estoppel certificates, and subordination
agreements relating thereto). Each Lease is in full force and effect in
accordance with its terms, and the Company or Subsidiary which is a
party thereto holds a valid leasehold estate in the Leased Real Property
described therein, free and clear of all Liens.

(c)  _Section 3.19(c)_ of the Company Disclosure Schedule contains a
complete and accurate list of all of the existing Leases granting to any
Person, other than the Company or any of its Subsidiaries, any subleasehold
estate, license to use or occupy, or other right, now or in the future, in
any of the Leased Real Property including, with respect to each such Lease,
the parties thereto, the date of the Lease, and each amendment thereto, the
square footage of the premises affected by such Lease, the square footage of
the premises currently occupied by the third-party holder of the rights
granted by the Lease the aggregate annual rental or other consideration
(including operating expense reimbursements) payable to the Company or
a Subsidiary thereunder, and whether any such payments to the Company or a
Subsidiary are delinquent.

(d) The Leases will survive the Closing, and will inure to be benefit of the
Surviving Corporation and its Subsidiaries in accordance with their existing
terms. The execution and delivery of this Agreement by the Company does not,
and the consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby will not, result
in any breach of or constitute a default (or an event that with notice or
lapse of time or both would become a default) under, or materially impair the
rights of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries or alter the rights or
obligations of the sublessor, lessor or licensor under, or give to others any
rights of termination, amendment, acceleration or cancellation of any Leases,
or otherwise adversely affect the continued use and possession of the
Leased Real Property for the conduct of business as presently conducted.
Neither the Company nor any of its Subsidiaries is in breach of or default
under or has received written notice of any breach of or default under any
Lease, and, to the Knowledge of the Company, no event has occurred that with
notice or lapse of time or both would constitute a breach or default
thereunder by the Company or any of its Subsidiaries or any other party

 



-44-  thereto. Neither the Company nor any of its Subsidiaries owes brokerage
commissions or finders fees with respect to any Leased Real Property, nor is
it party to any agreement or subject to any claim that may require the
payment of a real estate brokerage commission. The Company and its
Subsidiaries currently occupy all of the Leased Real Property for the
operation of their business. The Company has not transferred or assigned
any interest in any Lease, nor has the Company subleased or otherwise granted
rights of use or occupancy of any of the premises described therein to any
other person or entity. Neither the Company nor any of its Subsidiaries could
be required to expend more than $50,000 in causing any Leased Real Property
to comply with the surrender conditions set forth in the applicable Lease. The
Company and each of its subsidiaries has performed all of its obligations
under any termination agreements pursuant to which it has terminated any
leases of real property that are no longer in effect and has no continuing
material liability with respect to such terminated real property leases.

 

(e) Each Leased Real Property is in good operating condition and repair, and
suitable for the conduct of the business of the Company and its Subsidiaries
as presently conducted in all material respects.

(f) Since January 1, 2012, the Company has not received any notice from any
insurance company of any activities by the Company, any Subsidiary or any
other occupant of a Leased Real Property, or any defects or inadequacies in
any Leased Real Property or any part thereof, which could materially and
adversely affect the insurability of such Leased Real Property or materially
increase the premiums for the insurance covering such Leased Real Property. To
the Knowledge of the Company and its Subsidiaries, since January 1, 2012, no
notice has been given by any insurance company which has issued a policy with
respect to any portion of any Leased Real Property or by any board of fire
underwriters (or other body exercising similar functions) requesting the
performance of any repairs, alterations or other work with which compliance
has not been made.

(g) To the Knowledge of the Company, the Leased Real Property, and
improvements and activities thereon do not violate in any material respect
any applicable building code, zoning requirement or other law relating to such
property, improvements or activities, without regard to any so-called non-
conforming use exceptions. No law, ordinance, regulation or restriction is,
or as of the Closing Date will be, violated by the continued occupancy,
maintenance, operation or use by the Surviving Corporation and its
Subsidiaries of any Leased Real Property in its present manner. To the
Knowledge of the Company, there are no laws, statutes, rules, regulations or
orders now in existence or under active consideration by any Governmental
Authority which could require any expenditure in excess of $50,000 to modify
or improve any Leased Real Property to bring it into compliance with any
current or planned applicable Law.

(h) There is no pending or, to the Knowledge of the Company, threatened
condemnation or similar proceeding affecting any Leased Real Property or any
portion thereof, and the Company has no Knowledge that any such action is
currently contemplated. There are no legal actions, suits or other legal or
administrative proceedings pending or, to the Knowledge of the Company,
threatened against the Company or against third parties affecting or with
respect to any Leased Real Property, and the Company has no knowledge of any
facts which might result in any such action, suit or proceeding.

 



-45- 3.20 _Tangible Personal Property_. The machinery, equipment, furniture,
fixtures and other tangible property and assets owned, leased or used by the
Company or any of its Subsidiaries (the " _Assets_ ") are sufficient and
adequate to carry on their respective businesses in all material respects as
presently conducted. The Company and its Subsidiaries are in possession of
and have good title to, or valid leasehold interests in or valid rights under
contract to use, such Assets, free and clear of all Liens (other than
Permitted Encumbrances), except for defects in title that, individually are
valued at less than $50,000 or in the aggregate are valued at less than
$250,000.

Company is solely owned by the Company and is free and clear of all Liens
(other than Permitted Encumbrances) and immediately following the Closing will
be, valid and enforceable and freely exercisable, transferable, licensable,
and alienable without the consent of, or notice or payment of any kind to any
Governmental Authority or third party. In the three year period preceding the
date hereof, neither the Company nor any of its Subsidiaries has transferred
ownership to any person, or permitted any person to retain, any exclusive
rights, or joint ownership of, any material Intellectual Property Right that
is or was Company Intellectual Property.

 

(d) Neither the Company Products, nor the past or current conduct or
operations of the Company or its Subsidiaries have infringed
or misappropriated the Intellectual Property Rights of any third party, or
have violated any right of any person or any Laws. No Legal Proceeding has
been asserted or, to the Knowledge of the Company, threatened against the
Company or any of its Subsidiaries by, and none of the Company or its
Subsidiaries has received written notice from, any third party alleging that
any Company Product or the operation or conduct of the business of the Company
or any of its Subsidiaries, infringes or misappropriates the Intellectual
Property Rights of any third party, violates the rights of any third party or
any Laws, or challenging the ownership, validity, or enforceability of any
Company Intellectual Property (in each case, which remain unresolved as of
the date hereof).

(e) To the Knowledge of the Company, no person is misappropriating,
infringing, diluting or violating any Company Intellectual Property. None of
the Company or its

 



-46-  Subsidiaries has brought any claims, suits, arbitrations or other
adversarial proceedings before any court, Governmental Authority or arbitral
tribunal against any third party with respect to any Company Intellectual
Property which remain unresolved as of the date hereof.

(f) In each case in which the Company or any of its Subsidiaries has engaged
or hired a third party to develop or create any Intellectual Property Rights
or Technology for any of them with respect to Company Products, or the Company
or any of its Subsidiaries has acquired or purported to acquire ownership of
any Intellectual Property Rights or Technology with respect to the Company
Products from any person, the Company or any of its Subsidiaries, as the case
may be, has obtained a valid and enforceable written assignment, sufficient
to irrevocably transfer all such Intellectual Property Rights (including the
right to seek past and future damages with respect thereto) to the Company or
any of its Subsidiaries, and where such Intellectual Property Rights are
Registered Intellectual Property, the Company or any of its Subsidiaries has
recorded each such assignment with the relevant Governmental Authority.

(g) The Company and its Subsidiaries have taken commercially reasonable
measures necessary to protect its Trade Secrets and the Trade Secrets provided
to the Company or any of its Subsidiaries by any other person. Without
limiting the generality of the foregoing, the Company and its Subsidiaries
have, and enforce, a policy requiring each employee, consultant and
independent contractor involved in the creation of Intellectual Property
Rights or Technology for the Company or its Subsidiaries to execute a
proprietary information, confidentiality and invention assignment agreement,
which, since January 1, 2012, has been substantially in the form attached to
_Section 3.21(g)_ of the Company Disclosure Schedule, and all current and
former employees, consultants and independent contractors of the Company or
its Subsidiaries involved in the creation of such Intellectual Property Rights
or Technology have executed such or a substantially similar agreement
since January 1, 2012 and such agreements are in possession of the Company.

(h) _Section 3.21(h)_ of the Company Disclosure Schedule lists all Contracts
currently in effect as of the date of this Agreement pursuant to which a third
party has either (i) licensed or granted any right to the Company or any of
its Subsidiaries in any Technology or Intellectual Property Rights or (ii)
provided or agreed to provide any services (including hosted services) with
which the Company Products interface via API or other method (" _In-Licenses_

the Company with any Company Products, and (B) Open Source Licenses. For all
In-Licenses for Technology or Intellectual Property Rights that are
incorporated into, embedded into, hosted with, distributed with, or
installed with any Company Products, _Section 3.21(h)_ of the Company
Disclosure Schedule specifies whether any royalty, honorarium, or other
similar fee is or will become payable by Company or any of its Subsidiaries to
retain such rights and, in each such case, indicates the applicable payment.

(i) _Section 3.21(i)_ of the Company Disclosure Schedule lists all

-47-  services for any third party (other than Ordinary Course Licenses), or (C)

Ordinary Course Licenses. _Section 3.21(i)_ of the Company Disclosure
Schedule also lists all Contracts between or among Company and any of its
Subsidiaries with respect to Intellectual Property Rights or related services
(the Contracts described in this _Section 3.21(i)_, together with the
Ordinary Course Licenses, " _Out-Licenses_ "; and together with the In-
Licenses, the " _IP Contracts_ ").

 

(j) All IP Contracts are in full force and effect. Neither Company nor any of
its Subsidiaries is, nor, to the Knowledge of Company is, or any other party
to any IP Contract, in material breach of any IP Contract. The consummation of
the transactions contemplated hereby will not result in the release of any
Source Code or other proprietary Technology of the Company or the
Surviving Corporation or in the granting of any right or licenses to any
Company Intellectual Property to any third party, (iii) result in Parent or
any of its Affiliates being required to grant to any third party any rights to
or under their Intellectual Property Rights as a result of such IP Contract,
or (iv) subject the Surviving Corporation or any of its Subsidiaries, or (as a
result of such IP Contract) Parent or any of its Affiliates, to any non-
compete or other material restriction on the operation or scope of their
respective businesses. All IP Contracts shall survive the Closing in
accordance with their terms and the Surviving Corporation will be permitted to
exercise all of the Companys rights under all IP Contracts that they had
prior to the Closing, other than termination or similar rights that, if
exercised, would not individually or in the aggregate be materially adverse to
any business, operations, properties, assets, liabilities,
condition (financial or otherwise) or results of operations of the Company
and its Subsidiaries.

(k) Other than pursuant to Ordinary Course Licenses, none of the IP Contracts
requires Company or any of its Subsidiaries, or will require the Surviving
Corporation, to return or refund any amounts paid to any of them, or grant any
credit to any third party, or pay any liquidated damages or penalties in the
event of any breach of any warranty of any of them or any failure of any of
them to perform under such IP Contract, other than liquidated damages or
contractual penalties that would not individually or in the aggregate be
materially adverse to business, operations, properties, assets, liabilities,
condition (financial or otherwise) or results of operations of the Company and
its Subsidiaries, taken together as a whole.

 

(l) _Section 3.21(l)_ of the Company Disclosure Schedule lists any Open
Source Materials used by the Company or its Subsidiaries in, or in the
development of, any Company Products or any other proprietary Company
Technology sold, licensed, or distributed by the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries and identifies (i) the name of the applicable Open Source License
and the applicable license URL, (ii) whether the relevant Open Source
Material is sold, licensed, or distributed by Company or its Subsidiaries,
(iii) whether the Open Source Material is embedded into a Company Product,
(iv) whether the Open Source Material has been modified by Company or its
Subsidiaries, and (v) whether the Open Source Material is statically or
dynamically linked to any Company Product.

 

(m) Without limiting _Section 3.21(l)_, neither the Company nor any of its
Subsidiaries has (i) granted, nor are any of them obligated to grant, access
or rights to any of the Source Code of any Company Products or proprietary
Company Technology (other than access

 



-48-  rights to the Companys and its Subsidiaries employees and contractors as
necessary to internally support, maintain, and develop the Company Products or
Company Technology), (ii) rendered its proprietary Source Code subject to any
Open Source License, (iii) distributed any of the Company Products with Open
Source Materials in a manner that would have the effect described in clause
(m)(ii)) or pursuant to the terms of an Open Source License or (iv) licensed,

Source License. Except as set forth in _Section 3.21(m)_ of the Company
Disclosure Schedule, no Source Code owned by the Company or its Subsidiaries
is subject to any escrow or similar agreement.

Company or any of its Subsidiaries, and no notice of any such claim or
complaint has been received by, Company or any of its Subsidiaries, since
January 1, 2012 with respect to any Company Products (including with respect
to any delay, defect, deficiency of any product, or quality of any service) or
with respect to the breach of any Contract (including any Out-License) under
which Company Products have been supplied or provided, other than breaches or
warranty claims that would not individually or in the aggregate be materially
adverse to business, operations, properties, assets, liabilities, condition
(financial or otherwise) or results of operations of the Company and
its Subsidiaries, taken together as a whole. To the Knowledge of the Company,
there is no reasonable basis for any present or future complaint or claim with
respect to any Company Products (including with respect to any delay, defect,
deficiency of any product, or quality of any service) or with respect to the
breach of any Contract (including any Out-License) under which Company
Products have been supplied or provided that would result in a Company
Material Adverse Effect. Each Company Product (including any service
provided) has been and is in conformity in all material respects with all
applicable Laws and all express and implied warranties (to the extent any such
implied warranties have not been disclaimed under applicable Law), except for
such violations or noncompliance that would not be material to the Company and
its Subsidiaries, taken as a whole.

(o) To the Knowledge of the Company, no Company Product contains any (i)
undisclosed disabling codes or instructions, "time bombs," "Trojan horses,"

and services in the custody or control of the Company (collectively, "
_Systems_ "), are reasonably sufficient for the existing, and reasonably
anticipated future (for the next twelve (12) months) (without taking into
account this transaction) needs of the Company, including as to capacity,
scalability and ability to process current and anticipated peak volumes in a
timely manner. Since January 1, 2012, the Company has not suffered a material
security breach with respect to the Systems.

to be taken, all actions, and to do, or cause to be done (and to assist and
cooperate with the other party hereto in doing), all things reasonably
necessary, proper or advisable to consummate and make effective, in the most
expeditious manner practicable, the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement (including the Offer and the Merger), including using commercially
reasonable efforts to (a) cause the conditions to the Offer set forth on
_Section 1.1(b)_ and the conditions to the Merger set forth in _Section
2.2(b)_ to be satisfied or fulfilled as soon as reasonably practicable, (b)
obtain all necessary consents, waivers and approvals under any Material
Contracts (or such other Contracts as Parents may reasonably request) to which
the Company or any of its Subsidiaries is a party in connection with this
Agreement and the consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby
(including the Offer and the Merger) so as to maintain and preserve the
benefits under such Contracts following the consummation of the transactions
contemplated hereby (including the Offer and the Merger), (c) obtain all
necessary actions or non-actions, waivers, consents, approvals, Orders and
authorizations from Governmental Authorities, the expiration or termination of
any applicable waiting periods, making all necessary registrations,

additional instruments reasonably necessary to consummate the transactions
contemplated by, and to fully carry out the purposes of, this Agreement. With
respect to clause (b) above, (i) all fees, costs and expenses to obtain, and
satisfy the conditions of the consents to be obtained by the
Company hereunder (including the consents of all lessors of Leased Real
Property) shall be paid and borne entirely by the Company, and (ii) if the
lessor, master lessor, sublessor, or licensor under any Lease conditions its
grant of a consent (including by threatening to exercise a "recapture" or
other termination right) upon, or otherwise requires in response to a notice
or consent request regarding the transactions contemplated by this Agreement,
the payment of a consent fee, "profit sharing" payment or other consideration
(including increased rent payments), or the provision of additional security
(including a guaranty), the Company shall be solely responsible for making all
such payments and providing all such additional security.

6.3 _Regulatory Approvals_.

 

(a) Without limiting the generality of _Section 6.2_, as soon as reasonably
practicable (and in any event within ten (10) Business Days) following the
date hereof, each of Parent and the Company shall file with the FTC and the
Antitrust Division of the DOJ a Notification and Report Form relating to this
Agreement and the transactions contemplated hereby (including the Offer and
the Merger) as required by the HSR Act, as well as any comparable pre-merger
notification filings, forms and submissions with any foreign Governmental
Authority that may be required by other applicable Antitrust Laws, in each
case as Parent may deem necessary and/or appropriate. Each of Parent and the
Company shall promptly, (i) cooperate and coordinate with the other in the
making of such filings, (ii) supply the other with any information that may
be required in order to effectuate such filings, (iii) supply any additional
information that reasonably may be required or requested by the FTC, the DOJ

that Parent reasonably deems necessary and/or appropriate and (iv) Parent
shall be solely responsible for fees and expenses incurred in connection with
filings made in connection with this _Section 6.3(a)_. Each 

 



-63-  party hereto shall promptly inform the other party or parties hereto, as the
case may be, of any communication from any Governmental Authority regarding
any of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement (including the Offer
and the Merger). If any party hereto or Affiliate thereof receives a request
for additional information or documentary material from any such Governmental
Authority with respect to the transactions contemplated by this Agreement
(including the Offer and the Merger), then such party shall use commercially
reasonable efforts to make, or cause to be made, as soon as reasonably
practicable and after consultation with the other party, an appropriate
response in compliance with such request. Neither Parent nor the Company
shall commit or agree (or permit their respective Subsidiaries or Affiliates
to commit or agree) with any Governmental Authority to stay, toll, restart or
extend any applicable waiting period under the HSR Act or other applicable
Antitrust Laws, without the prior written consent of the other (such consent
not to be unreasonably withheld or delayed).

 

(b) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary set forth in this Agreement, none
of Parent, Merger Sub or any of their Subsidiaries shall be required to, and
the Company may not, without the prior written consent of Parent, become
subject to, consent to, or offer or agree to, or otherwise take any action
with respect to, any requirement, condition, limitation, understanding,
agreement or order to (A) sell, license, assign, transfer, divest, hold
separate or otherwise dispose of any assets, business or portion of business
of the Company, the Surviving Corporation, Parent, Merger Sub or any of their
respective Subsidiaries, (B) conduct, restrict, operate, invest or otherwise
change the assets, business or portion of business of the Company, the
Surviving Corporation, Parent, Merger Sub or any of their respective
Subsidiaries in any manner, or (C) impose any restriction, requirement or
limitation on the operation of the business or portion of the business of the
Company, the Surviving Corporation, Parent, Merger Sub or any of their
respective Subsidiaries; _provided_ that, if requested by Parent, the Company
will become subject to, consent to, or offer or agree to, or otherwise take
any action with respect to, any such requirement, condition, limitation,
understanding, agreement or order so long as such requirement, condition,
limitation, understanding, agreement or order is only binding on the Company
in the event the Closing occurs or (ii) file or defend any lawsuit or Legal
Proceeding, appeal any judgment or Order or contest any injunction issued in a
Legal Proceeding initiated by a Governmental Authority.

6.4 _Anti-Takeover Statutes_. Without limiting the generality of the
provisions of  _Sections 6.2_ and _6.3_ , in the event that any state anti-
takeover or other similar statute or regulation is or becomes applicable to
this Agreement or any of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement
(including the Offer and the Merger), the Company, at the direction of the
Company Board, shall use reasonable best efforts to ensure that the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement (including the Offer and the
Merger) may be consummated as promptly as practicable on the terms and
subject to the conditions set forth in this Agreement, and otherwise to
minimize the effect of such statute or regulation on this Agreement and the
transactions contemplated hereby (including the Offer and the Merger).

 

6.5 _Access to Books, Records, Properties and Personnel_. At all times during
the period commencing with the execution and delivery of this Agreement and
continuing until the earlier to occur of the termination of this Agreement
pursuant to _Article VII_ and the Acceptance Time, the Company shall afford
Parent and its accountants, legal counsel and other representatives
reasonable access during normal business hours, upon reasonable notice, to the

 



-64-  properties, books and records and personnel of the Company to enable Parent
to obtain all information concerning the Leased Real Property (including any
inspections, evaluations, surveys or tests which Parent may deem necessary or
appropriate), the Assets and the businesses of the Company and its
Subsidiaries, including the status of product development efforts, properties,
results of operations and personnel of the Company, as Parent may reasonably
request; _provided, however,_ that any such access shall be conducted at
Parents expense, at a reasonable time, under the supervision of appropriate
personnel of the Company and in such a manner as not to unreasonably
interfere with the normal operation of the business of the Company. Nothing
herein shall require the Company to disclose any information to Parent if such
disclosure would, in Companys reasonable discretion (i) jeopardize any
attorney-client or other legal privilege (so long as the Company has
reasonably cooperated with Parent to permit such inspection of or to disclose
such information on a basis that does not waive such privilege with respect
thereto) or (ii) contravene any applicable Law; _provided, however,_ that
information shall be disclosed subject to execution of a joint defense
agreement in customary form, and disclosure may be limited to external counsel
for Parent, to the extent doing so may be reasonably required for the purpose
of complying with applicable Antitrust Laws; and _provided, further,_ that the
parties will cooperate and use reasonable best efforts to find a way to allow
diligence of such information in a manner that would not cause the results in
clauses (i) or (ii); and _provided, further,_ that no information or knowledge
obtained by Parent in any investigation conducted pursuant to this _Section
6.5_ shall affect or be deemed to modify or waive (i) any right or claim of
Parent or the Surviving Corporation with respect to any representation or
warranty of the Company or a Subsidiary set forth herein, or (ii) any
condition to the obligations of Parent and Merger Sub to consummate the
transactions contemplated hereby, including the Offer and the Merger, or the
remedies available to the parties hereunder; and _provided further_ , that the
terms and conditions of the Confidentiality Agreement shall apply to any
information provided to Parent pursuant to this _Section 6.5_. Parents
exercise of its right to inspect the properties, books and records of the
Company, or Parents election not to inspect any of the foregoing, shall in no
way be interpreted as a waiver of any of Parents rights or remedies
contained in this Agreement, including, without limitation, Parents right to
rely upon the Companys representations and warranties in this Agreement.

 

6.6 _Notification Obligations_.

 

(a) At all times during the period commencing with the execution and delivery

communication received by it from any third party, subsequent to the date of
this Agreement and prior to the Effective Time, alleging any material breach
of or material default under any Material Contract or Government Contract to
which the Company or any of its Subsidiaries is a party, or (ii) any notice
or other communication received by the Company or any of its Subsidiaries from
any third party, subsequent to the date of this Agreement and prior to the
Effective Time, alleging that the consent of such third party is or may be
required in connection with the transactions contemplated by this Agreement
(including the Offer and the Merger); _provided, however_ , that no such
notification shall affect or be deemed to modify any representation or
warranty of the Company set forth herein or the conditions to the obligations
of Parent and Merger Sub to consummate the transactions contemplated hereby,
including the Offer and the Merger, or the remedies available to the parties
hereunder; and _provided further_ , that the terms and conditions of the
Confidentiality Agreement shall apply to any information provided to Parent
pursuant to this _Section 6.6(b)_.

termination of this Agreement pursuant to _Article VII_ and the Effective
Time, Parent shall give prompt notice to the Company upon becoming aware that
any representation or warranty made by it or Merger Sub in this Agreement
has become untrue or inaccurate in any material respect, or of any failure of
Parent or Merger Sub to comply with or satisfy in any material respect any
covenant, condition or agreement to be complied with or satisfied by it under
this Agreement;  _provided, however_ , that no such notification shall affect
or be deemed to modify any representation or warranty of Parent or Merger Sub
set forth herein or the conditions to the obligations of the Company to
consummate the transactions contemplated hereby, including the Offer and the
Merger, or the remedies available to the parties hereunder and _provided
further_ , that the terms and conditions of the Confidentiality Agreement

_Section 6.6(c)_.

6.7 _Transaction-Related Litigation_.

 

(a) The Company shall promptly advise Parent orally and in writing of any
litigation commenced after the date hereof against the Company or any of its
directors by any Company Stockholders (on their own behalf or on behalf of the
Company) relating to this Agreement or the transactions contemplated hereby
(including the Offer and the Merger) and shall keep Parent reasonably and
regularly informed regarding any such litigation.

(b) The Company shall give Parent the opportunity to consult with the Company
regarding the defense or settlement of any litigation filed against the
Company or any of its directors or officers in connection with any of the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement (including the Offer and the
Merger), shall consider Parents views with respect to such litigation and
shall not settle any such litigation without the prior written consent of
Parent (which shall not be unreasonably withheld or delayed).

 



-66- 6.8 _Treatment of Company Options and Company Warrant_.

 

(a) _Company Options_.

 

(i) At the Effective Time, by virtue of the Merger and without any action on
the part of Ultimate Parent, Parent, Merger Sub, the Company or any other
parties, each Company Option that is then outstanding, unvested and held by a
Continuing Service Provider (a " _Continuing Option_ ") shall be assumed by
Ultimate Parent. Each Continuing Option assumed by Ultimate Parent shall
continue to have, and be subject to the same terms and conditions of such
option immediately prior to the Effective Time, including the vesting
restrictions, except for administrative changes that are not adverse to the
holder of the Continuing Option or to which the holder consents and except
that: (x) each Continuing Option shall be exercisable for a number of shares
of common stock of Ultimate Parent (" _Ultimate Parent Common Stock_ ") equal
to the product of the number of shares of Company Common Stock that would be
issuable upon exercise of the Continuing Option outstanding immediately prior
to the Effective Time multiplied by a quotient obtained by dividing (I) the
Merger Consideration by (II) the average closing price of Ultimate Parent
Common Stock on the NASDAQ Global Select Market for the five trading days
immediately preceding (but not including) the Effective Time (the " _Exchange
Ratio_ "), rounded down to the nearest whole number of shares of Ultimate
Parent Common Stock; and (y) the per share exercise price for the Ultimate
Parent Common Stock issuable upon exercise of such assumed Continuing Option
shall be equal to the quotient determined by dividing the per share exercise
price for such Continuing Option outstanding immediately prior to the
Effective Time by the Exchange Ratio, rounded up to the nearest whole cent;
and (z) all references to the "Company" in the applicable Company Stock Plans
and the applicable Company Option agreements shall be references to Ultimate
Parent. It is the intention of the parties that each Company Option so assumed
by Ultimate Parent shall qualify following the Effective Time as an incentive
stock option as defined in Section 422 of the Code to the extent permitted
under Section 422 of the Code and to the extent such Company Stock Option
qualified as an incentive stock option prior to the Effective Time,
and comply with or be exempt from Section 409A of the Code, and any
ambiguities hereunder will be resolved in a manner to maintain such exemption
from or compliance with Section 409A of the Code.

 

(ii) By virtue of the Merger and without any action on the part of Ultimate
Parent, Parent, Merger Sub, the Company or any other parties, each Company
Option that is outstanding and vested by its terms (after giving effect to any
acceleration of vesting that occurs at or prior to the Effective Time as a
result of the consummation of the Merger) and each outstanding and unvested
Company Option that is not a Continuing Option (each, a " _Terminating Option_
") shall be cancelled immediately prior to the Effective Time and shall be
converted

 



-67-  automatically into the right to receive, as soon as practicable after the
Effective Time (but not later than thirty 30 days after the Effective Time, an
amount in cash determined by multiplying (x) the excess, if any, of the
Merger Consideration over the applicable exercise price of such option by (y)
the number of Company Shares subject to each Terminating Option, less all
applicable deductions and withholdings required by applicable Law to be
withheld in respect of such payment. Each Terminating Option that is
outstanding and unexercised immediately prior to the Effective Time that has
an exercise price equal to or greater than the Merger Consideration shall
be cancelled immediately prior to the Effective Time without consideration
therefor and the holder of such Terminating Option shall cease to have any
rights with respect thereto.

 

(b) Prior to the Closing, the Company shall satisfy all notification
requirements under the terms of the Company Warrant to the extent the Company
Warrant is outstanding immediately prior to the Acceptance Time.

(c) No later than thirty (30) days after the Effective Time, the Surviving
Corporation shall pay the aggregate Merger Consideration, net of any
withholding Taxes required to be deducted and withheld by applicable Laws in
accordance with _Section 2.6(f)_, payable with respect to
Terminating Options that are not tendered in the Offer.

(d) _Company Action_. Prior to the Effective Time, the Company shall take or
cause to be taken any and all actions necessary to give effect to the
treatment of the Company Options pursuant to this _Section 6.8._ As promptly
as practicable (and in any event no later than five (5) Business Days)
following the date hereof, the Company shall deliver a written notice to the
holders of Company Options, setting forth the treatment in this _Section 6.8_
and providing that Company Options shall be exercisable until no later than
five (5) Business Days prior to the Effective Time. Any materials to be
submitted to the holders of Company Options in connection with the written
notice required under this _Section 6.8_ shall be subject to the reasonable
review and approval of Parent (which approval shall not be unreasonably
withheld or delayed).

6.9 _Company Employee Matters_.

 

(a) Prior to the Acceptance Time, the Company shall take all actions necessary
or required under the 2014 Employee Stock Purchase Plan (the " _Company ESPP_
") and applicable Law to, contingent on the Effective Time, (i) ensure that no
new offering period or purchase period shall be authorized, commenced or
extended on or after the date of this Agreement and (ii) if the Closing shall
occur prior to the end of the offering period in existence under the Company
ESPP on the date of this Agreement, cause the rights of participants in the
Company ESPP with respect to any such offering period (and purchase period
thereunder) then underway under the Company ESPP to be determined by treating
the last Business Day prior to the Acceptance Time as the last day of such
offering period and purchase period and by making such other pro-
rata adjustments as may be necessary to reflect the shortened offering period
and purchase period but otherwise treating such shortened offering period and
purchase period as a fully effective and completed offering period and
purchase period for all purposes under the Company ESPP. The Company shall
terminate the Company ESPP in its entirety effective as of the Acceptance
Time, contingent upon the Effective Time. Prior to the Acceptance Time, the
Company shall take all actions (including, if appropriate, amending the terms
of the Company ESPP) that are necessary to give effect to the transactions
contemplated by this _Section 6.9(a)_.

 



-68- (b) _401(k) Plan_. The Company shall terminate any and all 401(k) plans
maintained by the Company or any Subsidiary (each a " _401(k) Plan_ "), in
each case effective as of the day immediately preceding the date the Company
becomes a member of the same controlled group of corporations (as defined in
Section 414(b) of the Code) as Parent, unless Parent provides written notice
(at least seven (7) Business Days prior to the date the Company becomes a
member of the same controlled group of corporations as Parent) to the Company
that such 401(k) Plan(s) shall not be terminated. The Company shall provide
Parent evidence that the 401(k) Plan(s) of the Company and its Subsidiaries
have been terminated pursuant to resolutions of the Company Board or the board
of directors of its Subsidiaries, as applicable. The Company shall also take
such other actions in furtherance of terminating any such 401(k) Plan(s) as
Parent may reasonably request.

 

(c) _Termination of Company Plans_. The Company shall terminate any and all
group severance, separation or salary continuation plans, programs or
arrangements maintained by the Company or any of its ERISA Affiliates, each of
which such group plans, programs and arrangements is set forth _Section
6.9(c)_ of the Company Disclosure Schedule, in each case effective as of
no later than the day immediately preceding the last day of the initial
period of the Offer. For the avoidance of any doubt, the termination of all
group severance, separation and salary continuation plans, programs or
arrangements pursuant to the preceding sentence shall be effected without any
payment or benefits (or giving rights to any payment or benefits) thereunder.
The Company shall provide Parent evidence that such plans have been terminated
pursuant to resolutions of the Company Board or the board of directors of its
Subsidiaries, as applicable (the form and substance of which resolutions shall
be subject to review and approval of Parent).

 

(d) _No Third Party Rights_. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary set
forth in this Agreement, no provision of this Agreement shall be deemed to
(i) guarantee employment for any period of time for, or preclude the ability
of Parent, Merger Sub or the Surviving Corporation to terminate, any Employee
for any reason, or (ii) require Parent or the Surviving Corporation
to continue any Employee Plan or prevent the amendment, modification or
termination thereof on and after the Effective Time.

6.10 _Company Director and Officer Indemnification and Insurance_.

(a) Parent shall cause the Surviving Corporation and its Subsidiaries to,
honor and fulfill in all respects the obligations of the Company and its
Subsidiaries under their respective certificates of incorporation and bylaws
(and other similar organizational documents) and all indemnification
agreements in effect as of the date of this Agreement between the Company or
any of its Subsidiaries and any of their respective current or former
directors and officers (the " _Company Indemnified Parties_ ") (which, to the
extent under Delaware Law, shall be honored for a period of six (6) years
from the Closing Date, and any claim made requesting indemnification pursuant
to such indemnification rights within such six-year period shall continue to
be subject to this _Section 6.10(a)_ and the indemnification rights provided
under this _Section 6.10(a)_ until disposition of such claim).

 



-69- (b) For a period of six (6) years after the Effective Time, Parent and the
Surviving Corporation shall maintain in effect the Companys current
directors and officers liability insurance (" _D andO Insurance_") in respect
of acts or omissions occurring at or prior to the Acceptance Time, covering
each person covered by the DandO Insurance as of the date of this Agreement, on
terms with respect to the coverage and amounts no less favorable, in the
aggregate, than those of the DandO Insurance in effect on the date of this
Agreement;  _provided, however_ , that the Surviving Corporation may, at its
option, substitute therefor policies of Parent, the Surviving Corporation or
any of their respective Subsidiaries containing terms with respect to coverage
and amounts no less favorable, in the aggregate, to such persons than the DandO
Insurance, _provided, further_ , that in satisfying its obligations under this
_Section 6.10(b)_ Parent and the Surviving Corporation shall not be obligated
to pay annual premiums in excess of two hundred percent (200%) of the amount
paid by the Company for coverage for its last full fiscal year (such two
hundred percent (200%) amount, the " _Maximum Annual Premium_ ") (which
premiums the Company represents and warrants to be as set forth in _Section
6.10(b_) of the Company Disclosure Schedule), _provided, further,_ that that
if the annual premiums of such insurance coverage exceed such amount, Parent
and the Surviving Corporation shall be obligated to obtain a policy with the
greatest coverage available for a cost not exceeding the Maximum Annual
Premium. Prior to the Acceptance Time, notwithstanding anything to the
contrary set forth in this Agreement, the Company may purchase a six-year
"tail" prepaid policy (the " _Tail Policy_ ") on the DandO Insurance on terms
and conditions no less favorable, in the aggregate, than the DandO Insurance. In
the event that the Company purchases such a Tail Policy prior to the
Acceptance Time, Parent and the Surviving Corporation shall maintain such Tail
Policy in full force and effect and continue to honor their respective
obligations thereunder, in lieu of all other obligations of Parent and the
Surviving Corporation under the first sentence of this _Section 6.10(b)_ for
so long as such Tail Policy shall be maintained in full force and effect.

 

(c) If Parent or the Surviving Corporation or any of its successors or assigns
shall (i) consolidate with or merge into any other Person and shall not be
the continuing or surviving corporation or entity of such consolidation or
merger or (ii) transfer all or substantially all of its properties and assets
to any Person, then, and in each such case, proper provisions shall be made
so that the successors and assigns of the Surviving Corporation shall assume
all of the obligations of Parent and the Surviving Corporation set forth in
this _Section 6.10_.

 

(d) The obligations under this _Section 6.10_ shall not be terminated,
amended or otherwise modified in such a manner as to adversely affect any
Company Indemnified Party (or any other person who is a beneficiary under the
DandO Insurance or the Tail Policy referred to in _Section 6.10(b)_ (and their
heirs and representatives)) without the prior written consent of such
affected Company Indemnified Party or other person who is a beneficiary under
the DandO Insurance or the Tail Policy referred to in _Section 6.10(b)_ (and
their heirs and representatives). Each of the Company Indemnified Parties or
other persons who are beneficiaries under the DandO Insurance or the Tail Policy
referred to in _Section 6.10(b)_ (and their heirs and representatives) are
intended to be third party beneficiaries of this  _Section 6.10_, with full
rights of enforcement as if a party thereto. The rights of the Company
Indemnified Parties (and other persons who are beneficiaries under the DandO
Insurance or the Tail Policy referred to in  _Section 6.10(b)_ (and their
heirs and representatives)) under this _Section 6.10_ shall be in addition
to, and not in substitution for, any other rights that such persons may have
under the certificate or articles of incorporation, bylaws or other
equivalent organizational documents, any and all indemnification agreements of
or entered into by the Company or any of its Subsidiaries, or applicable Law
(whether at law or in equity).

 



-70- 6.11 _Section 16 Matters_. Prior to the Effective Time, the Company shall
take all such steps as may be required to cause to be exempt under Rule 16b-3
promulgated under the Exchange Act any dispositions of shares of Company
Shares (including derivative securities with respect to such shares) that are
treated as dispositions under such rule and result from the Offer, the Merger
and the other transactions contemplated hereby by each director or officer of
the Company who is subject to the reporting requirements of Section 16(a) of
the Exchange Act with respect to the Company.

6.12 _Compensation Committee Approval of New Compensation Arrangements_. Prior
to the Effective Time, if and to the extent not already approved by the
Compensation Committee as of the date of this Agreement, the Company (acting
through its Compensation Committee) will take all steps that may be necessary
or advisable to cause (i) each compensation arrangement entered into by the
Company or any of its Subsidiaries with an executive officer of the Company
within one (1) year prior to the date of this Agreement, and (ii) each
compensation arrangement entered into by the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries on or after the date of this Agreement to be approved by the
Compensation Committee (comprised solely of "independent directors" determined
within the meaning of Rule 14d-10(d) under the Exchange Act) as
an "employment compensation, severance or other employee benefit arrangement"
within the meaning of Rule 14d-10(d)(2) under the Exchange Act and to satisfy
the requirements of the non-exclusive safe harbor set forth in Rule
14d-10(d)(1) of the Exchange Act. To the extent such actions are taken by
resolution or consent, the form and substance of such resolutions or consents
shall be in writing and be subject to review and approval of Parent, which
shall not be unreasonably delayed or withheld.

6.13 _Termination of Certain Agreements_. The Company shall use commercially
reasonable efforts to terminate each of the agreements listed in _Section
6.13_ of the Company Disclosure Schedule (the " _Terminated Agreements_ "),
effective as of and contingent upon the Closing, including sending all
required notices, such that each such agreement shall be of no further force
or effect immediately following the Effective Time. Upon the Closing, the
Company shall have paid all amounts owed under the Terminated Agreements (as a
result of the termination of the Terminated Agreements or otherwise), and the
Surviving Corporation will not incur any claim, liability or obligation
(absolute, accrued, asserted or unasserted, contingent or otherwise) under any
Terminated Agreement following the Closing Date. The Company shall be
responsible for making any payments required to terminate the Terminated
Agreements. In the event the Offer or the Merger does not close for any
reason, Parent shall not have any liability to the Company, the stockholders
of the Company or any other Person for any costs, claims, liabilities or
damages resulting from the Company seeking to obtain such terminations.

 

6.14 _Obligations of Merger Sub_. Parent shall take all action necessary to
cause Merger Sub and the Surviving Corporation to perform their respective
obligations under this Agreement and to consummate the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement, including the Offer and the Merger, upon the
terms and subject to the conditions set forth in this Agreement.
Immediately following the execution of this Agreement, Parent shall execute
and deliver, in accordance with Section 228 of the DGCL and in its capacity as
the sole stockholder of Merger Sub, a written consent adopting this Agreement.

 



-71- 6.15 _SEC Filings_. In the event that the Company would be required, under the
Exchange Act, to file any Annual Report on Form 10-K or Quarterly SEC Report
on Form 10-Q within ten (10) Business Days immediately following an Expiration
Date of the Offer, the Company shall file such Annual Report or Quarterly
Report (and all certifications required under the Exchange Act to be filed or
furnished with the SEC in connection therewith) prior to the Expiration Date.

 

ARTICLE VII

 

TERMINATION OF AGREEMENT

 

7.1 _Termination Prior to Acceptance Time_. This Agreement may be validly
terminated, and the Offer may be terminated and abandoned, at any time prior
to the Acceptance Time only as follows:

(a) by mutual written agreement of Parent and the Company; or

 

(b) by either Parent or the Company, if the Offer shall have expired or been
terminated in accordance with the terms hereof without Merger Sub (or Parent
on Merger Subs behalf) having accepted for payment any Company Shares
pursuant to the Offer; _provided, however_ , that the right to terminate this
Agreement pursuant to this _Section 7.1(b)_ shall not be available to any
party hereto whose action or failure to fulfill any obligation under this
Agreement has been the principal cause of or resulted (i) in any of the
conditions to the Offer Conditions having failed to be satisfied, or (ii) in
the expiration or termination of the Offer in accordance with the terms
hereof without Merger Sub (or Parent on Merger Subs behalf) having accepted
for payment any Company Shares pursuant to the Offer, and in either such case,
such action or failure to act constitutes a material breach of this
Agreement; or

of the notice referenced in the preceding clause (ii) (or within three (3)
Business Days in the event of a material amendment to the
Acquisition Proposal that is the subject of a previously delivered notice),
no longer constitutes a Superior Proposal relative to any transaction proposed
by Parent, and (iv) in connection with the termination of this Agreement, the

other party.

7.1_, this Agreement shall be of no further force or effect without liability

parties) to the other party or parties hereto, as applicable, except 

 



-74-  (i) for the terms of this _Section 7.2_, _Section 7.3_, and _Article

this Agreement pursuant to _Section 7.1_.

clause (iii) that triggers the obligation to such fee, a fee in the amount of
twenty-seven million one hundred thousand dollars ($27,100,000) (the "
_Termination Fee Amount_ "), in cash by wire transfer of immediately
available funds to an account designated in writing by Parent (provided that
for purposes of this clause (a) the references to "15%" and "85%" in the

with such termination, the Termination Fee Amount in cash by wire transfer of
immediately available funds to an account designated in writing by Parent.

 



-75- (e) In no event shall the Company be required to pay the Termination Fee
Amount on more than one occasion. The Company acknowledges and hereby agrees
that the provisions of this _Section 7.3_ are an integral part of the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement (including the Offer and the
Merger), and that, without such provisions, Parent would not have entered
into this Agreement. Accordingly, if the Company shall fail to pay in a timely

obtain such payment, Parent makes a claim that results in a judgment against
the Company, the Company shall promptly reimburse Parent its reasonable costs
and expenses (including its reasonable attorneys fees and expenses) incurred
