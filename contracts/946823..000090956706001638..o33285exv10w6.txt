     period, the September 30, 2006 Financial Statements shall be deemed to have

<PAGE>

     such twenty (20) day period. If the Vendors objects to any part of the

     nature of such objection, the parties agree to attempt to resolve the

     the extent required to give effect to such resolution and shall be deemed
     to have been approved as of the date of such resolution. If the parties

     all unresolved matters shall be submitted to the Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania,
     office of Ernst & Young LLP ("ERNST & YOUNG") for resolution, and Ernst &

     years prior to the date hereof. The rules and procedures to be followed by
     Ernst & Young in resolving the matters in dispute shall be determined by
     Ernst & Young in its discretion. Ernst & Young's determination of all such
     matters shall be final and binding on both parties and shall not be subject
     to appeal by either party. The fees and expenses of Ernst & Young shall be
     borne equally by the parties. The September 30, 2006 Financial Statements
     shall be modified to the extent required to give effect to Ernst & Young's
     determination and shall be deemed to have been approved as of the date of
     such determination.

2.6  CASH ON CLOSING.

     The Corporation shall have cash in the bank on the close of business on
     September 29, 2006 in an amount of $1,500,000. The Vendors represent and
     warrant that such cash amount should be sufficient to carry on the Business
     in the ordinary course consistent with past practice for the period ending
     forty-five (45) days after the Closing and should further amounts be
     required, the Vendors shall reimburse the Purchaser for the amount of any
     deficiency, such reimbursement to be made initially from the amount
     described in subsection 2.2(b) and such reimbursement shall reduce the
     Purchase Price.

2.7  ADJUSTMENT FOR INDEBTEDNESS.

     The Vendors and the Purchasers acknowledge and agree that the Purchase
     Price has been determined based on the assumption that the aggregate
     amounts owing by the Corporation, as at the Closing Date, under its
     existing term loan from National City Bank of Pennsylvania under its
     outstanding capital leases (such amounts collectively the "DEBT") is
     $22,640,000 (the "LOAN BALANCE"). To the extent that the actual amount
     outstanding on the Debt is greater than the Loan Balance by more than
     $1,000, the Vendors shall pay to the Purchaser the amount of such excess
     and the Purchase Price shall be reduced accordingly, such repayment to be
     made initially from the amount described in subsection 2.2(b). To the
     extent that the actual amount outstanding on the Debt is less than the Loan
     Balance by more than $1,000, the Purchaser shall pay to the


                                      -12-

<PAGE>

     Vendors the amount of such difference and the Purchase Price shall be
     increased accordingly.

     liabilities incurred by the Corporation since December 31, 2005, in the

     condition of the Corporation on the date hereof is no worse than as
     reflected in the Financial Statements. All accruals on the Financial
     Statements and books and records of the Corporation are bona fide and have
     been made in good faith based on the knowledge available to the Vendors as

     liability with respect to such increase.

     and records. The Corporation does not have any of its records, systems,
     controls, data or information recorded, stored, maintained, operated or
     wholly or partly dependent upon or held by any means (including any

     under its ownership and direct control.

3.18 ACCOUNTS RECEIVABLE.

     All outstanding accounts receivable, book debts or other debts due and
     accruing to the Corporation are good and collectible, subject to the
     allowance for doubtful accounts reflected in the Financial Statements. All
     accruals in the Financial Statements for bad debts or doubtful accounts are
     reasonable based on historical experience.

     experience with respect to freight damage claims and has properly reflected
     such accruals in its books and records.

          the proper tax or other receiving officers within the time required
          under any applicable legislation. The Purchaser acknowledges that the
          Vendors have provided to the Purchaser a true and correct copy of all

          the Purchaser and each of the Vendors shall jointly make, at the

          state income taxes governed by such elections ("APPLICABLE INCOME
          TAXES"), shall be treated as a sale by the Corporation of its assets
          and properties (the "ELECTION"). Assuming the conditions of this
          Section 6.8 are met and the Purchaser elects to make the Election, the
          Purchaser and each of the Vendors shall execute and file Internal
          Revenue Service Form 8023 and all accompanying schedules and all other
          forms, elections and statements required by the Internal Revenue

          each of the Vendors, Vitran or the Corporation may be subject,
          necessary or appropriate to effectuate, evidence and confirm the
          Election, and, in such event, the Purchaser, each of the Vendors,
          Vitran, and the Corporation shall file all tax returns in a manner
          consistent with the foregoing. The Purchaser and each of the Vendors
          agree that, for purposes of this Election, the purchase price for the
          assets and properties of the Corporation shall be determined by the
          Purchaser and the Vendors, jointly, in accordance with the provisions
          of Section 338 of the Code and applicable regulations of the Treasury
          Department and with reference to the fair market value of the assets
          and properties of the Corporation as reasonably determined by the
          Purchaser and the Vendors, jointly. If the Purchaser wishes to make
          the Election, the Purchaser shall, as expeditiously as possible, and,
          in any event, by November 30, 2006, disclose and describe to the
          Vendors its proposals for all such determinations and allocations.
          Prior to the making of the Election, Vitran shall have a reasonable
          opportunity to review, and the right to approve (insofar as they
          relate to the Election), each of the Vendors' tax returns as they
          relate to the Election and the Vendors calculation of 338 Taxes
          payable to be filed in connection with the


                                      -35-

<PAGE>

          Election and the Vendors' calculation of 338 Taxes payable, provided
          that the contents thereof shall remain strictly confidential and may
          be used by the Purchaser and its representatives only in and so far as
          they may be relevant to the purposes of this Section 6.8 provided that
          the Vendors acknowledge that Vitran will be required to disclose the
          aggregate amount of the 338 Taxes payable by all of the Vendors in its
          financial statements. The parties agree to attempt to resolve any
          dispute between them in respect of such tax returns or calculations
          within ten (10) days of the date the dispute first arises. If the
          parties cannot resolve all matters in dispute within such ten (10) day
          period, all unresolved matters shall be submitted to the Pittsburgh,
          Pennsylvania office of Ernst & Young for resolution by arbitration,
          and Ernst & Young shall be given access to all materials and
          information reasonably requested by it for such purpose. Vitran and
          the Vendors shall be entitled to make submissions to Ernst & Young
          during its consideration of the matters in dispute. Ernst & Young's
          determination of all such matters shall be final and binding on both
          parties and shall not be subject to appeal by either party. The fees
          and expenses of Ernst & Young shall be borne by Vitran unless the
          dispute is the result of the bad faith (in the sole opinion of Ernst &
          Young) of any of the Vendors in which case, it shall be borne by
          Vendors, jointly. Each of the Vendors' tax returns shall be modified
          to the extent required to give effect to Ernst & Young's
          determination.

     (b)  Provided that the Election is made in accordance with this Section
          6.8, the Purchaser will compensate, and Vitran shall cause the
          Purchaser to compensate, each of the Vendors for, and the Purchase
          Price will be increased by the amount of, any additional federal
          and/or state income taxes or other Taxes payable by the Vendors which
          would not have been payable by the Vendors if the Election had not
          been made ("338 TAXES"), together with any additional federal and/or
          state income taxes or other Taxes payable by the Vendors with respect
          to the payments which the Purchaser has made or is obligated to make
          to the Vendors in respect of 338 Taxes (i.e. on a gross up basis, the
          "PURCHASER 338 PAYMENTS"). Any 338 Taxes or Purchaser 338 Payments
          payable to the Vendors in accordance with this Section 6.8 will be due
          and payable by the Purchaser promptly upon calculation and under no
          circumstances later than a sufficient time prior to the date any of
          the Vendors is required to pay the applicable tax so that such Vendor
          has funds on hand within which to pay the tax.

     (c)  Notwithstanding any other provisions of this Agreement, the covenants
          and agreements of subsections 6.8 (a) and (b) shall have no expiration
          date.

     (d)  The Purchaser shall reimburse the Vendors for their reasonable costs
          incurred in connection with the Election and calculation of the 338
          Taxes payable.

          Price and the liabilities of the Corporation will be allocated to the
          assets of the Corporation for all purposes (including Tax and
          financial accounting) in a manner consistent with the Code sections
          338 and 1060 and the regulations thereunder. The

10.  INDEMNIFICATION

10.1 INDEMNIFICATION BY THE VENDORS

     Each of the Vendors agrees to indemnify, save harmless and hereby
     indemnifies and holds harmless the Purchaser, its permitted assigns, and,
     after the Time of Closing, the Corporation, and the directors, officers,
     employees, agents and representatives of each of the foregoing (all such
     persons other than the Purchaser, collectively, the "PURCHASER'S
     REPRESENTATIVES"), from all Losses suffered or incurred by the Purchaser or
     the Purchaser's Representatives as a result of or arising directly or
     indirectly out of or in connection with (and in the case of indemnification
     for matters described in subsections 10.1(b), notwithstanding any
     disclosure in this Agreement or in any agreement, certificate or other
     document delivered pursuant hereto):

     (a)  any breach by any of the Vendors of, or any inaccuracy of any
          representation or warranty of the Vendors contained in this Agreement
          or in any agreement, certificate or other document delivered pursuant
          hereto;

     (b)  any breach or non-performance by the Vendors of any covenant to be
          performed by him which is contained in this Agreement or in any
          agreement, certificate or other document delivered pursuant hereto;
          and

     (c)  all claims, demands, costs and expenses, including reasonable legal
          fees, in respect of the foregoing.

     The Purchaser holds the foregoing indemnity to the extent in favour of the
     Purchaser's Representatives in trust and as agent for the Purchaser's
     Representatives so that they may enjoy and be entitled to the benefit
     thereof.

10.2 INDEMNIFICATION BY THE PURCHASER.

     The Purchaser and Vitran agree to indemnify and save harmless and hereby
     indemnify and hold harmless each of the Vendors from all Losses suffered or
     incurred by the Vendors as a result of or arising directly or indirectly
     out of or in connection with: (a) any breach by the Purchaser or Vitran of
     or any inaccuracy of any representation or warranty contained in this
     Agreement or in any agreement, instrument, certificate or other document
     delivered pursuant hereto; (b) any breach or non-performance by the
     Purchaser of any covenant to be performed by it which is contained in this
     Agreement or in any agreement, certificate or other document delivered
     pursuant hereto; and (c) all claims, demands, costs and expenses, including
     reasonable legal fees, in respect of the foregoing.

10.3 LIMITATION ON OBLIGATION TO INDEMNIFY.

     (a)  In the event that any of the Vendors are required to indemnify and
          save harmless the Purchaser or the Purchaser's Representatives
          pursuant to Section 10.1 in


                                      -42-

<PAGE>

          respect of any Loss suffered or incurred, the liability of such party
          shall not arise until the Losses in respect thereof exceeds $100,000
          and the maximum aggregate amount of such liability shall not exceed
          $50,000,000.

     (b) In the event that the Purchaser or Vitran are required to indemnify and
          save harmless any of the Vendors pursuant to Section 10.2 in respect
          of any Loss suffered or incurred, the liability of the Purchaser and
          Vitran shall not arise until the losses in respect thereof exceeds
          $100,000.

10.4 NOTICE OF CLAIM.

     In the event that a party (the "INDEMNIFIED PARTY") shall become aware of
     any claim, proceeding or other matter which may result in a Loss (a
     "CLAIM") in respect of which another party (the "INDEMNIFYING PARTY")
     agreed to indemnify the Indemnified Party pursuant to this Agreement, the
     Indemnified Party shall promptly give written notice thereof to the
     Indemnifying Party. Such notice shall specify whether the Claim arises as a
     result of a claim by a person against the Indemnified Party (a "THIRD PARTY
     CLAIM") or whether the Claim does not so arise (a "DIRECT CLAIM"), and
     shall also specify with reasonable particularity (to the extent that the
     information is available) the factual basis for the Claim and the amount of
     the Claim, if known. If, through the fault of the Indemnified Party, the
     Indemnifying Party does not receive notice of any Claim in time to contest
     effectively the determination of any liability susceptible of being
     contested, the Indemnifying Party shall be entitled to set off against the
     amount claimed by the Indemnified Party the amount of any Losses incurred
     by the Indemnifying Party resulting from the Indemnified Party's failure to
     give such notice on a timely basis.

10.5 DIRECT CLAIMS.

     With respect to any Direct Claim, following receipt of notice from the
     Indemnified Party of the Claim, the Indemnifying Party shall have sixty
     (60) days to make such investigation of the Claim as is considered
     necessary or desirable. For the purpose of such investigation, the
     Indemnified Party shall make available to the Indemnifying Party the
     information relied upon by the Indemnified Party to substantiate the Claim,
     together with all such other information as the Indemnifying Party may
     reasonably request. If both parties agree at or prior to the expiration of
     such sixty (60) day period (or any mutually agreed upon extension thereof)
     to the validity and amount of such Claim, the Indemnifying Party shall
     immediately pay to the Indemnified Party the full agreed-upon amount of the
     Claim, failing which the matter shall be referred to binding arbitration in
     such manner as the parties may agree or shall be determined by a court of
     competent jurisdiction.

10.6 THIRD PARTY CLAIMS.

     With respect to any Third Party Claim, the Indemnifying Party shall have
     the right, at its expense, to participate in or assume control of the
     negotiation, settlement or defense of the Claim and, in such event, the
     Indemnifying Party shall reimburse the Indemnified


                                      -43-

<PAGE>

     Party for all the Indemnified Party's out-of-pocket expenses as a result of
     such participation or assumption. If the Indemnifying Party elects to
     assume such control, the Indemnified Party shall have the right to
     participate in the negotiation, settlement or defense of such Third Party
     Claim and to retain counsel to act on its behalf, provided that the fees
     and disbursements of such counsel shall be paid by the Indemnified Party
     unless the Indemnifying Party consents to the retention of such counsel or
     unless the named parties to any action or proceeding include both the
     Indemnifying Party and the Indemnified Party and the representation of both
     the Indemnifying Party and the Indemnified Party by the same counsel would
     be inappropriate due to the actual or potential differing interests between
     them (such as the availability of different defenses). If the Indemnifying
     Party, having elected to assume such control, thereafter fails to defend
     the Third Party Claim within a reasonable time, the Indemnified Party shall
     be entitled to assume such control, and the Indemnifying Party shall be
     bound by the results obtained by the Indemnified Party with respect to such
     Third Party Claim. If any Third Party Claim is of a nature such that: (a)
     the Indemnified Party is required by applicable law or the order of any
     court, tribunal or regulatory body having jurisdiction; or (b) it is
     necessary in the reasonable view of the Indemnified Party acting in good
     faith and in a manner consistent with reasonable commercial practices in
     respect of: (i) a Third Party Claim by a customer relating to products or
     services supplied by the Business; or (ii) a Third Party Claim relating to
     any Contract which is necessary to the ongoing operations of the Business
     or any material part thereof by a reasonable and prudent operator in
     substantially the same manner in which it has heretofore been operated by
     the Corporation in order to avoid material damage to the relationship
     between the Indemnified Party and any of its major customers or to preserve
     the rights of the Indemnified Party under such an essential Contract, to
     make a payment to any Person (a "THIRD PARTY") with respect to the Third
     Party Claim before the completion of settlement negotiations or related
     legal proceedings, as the case may be, the Indemnified Party may make such
     payment and the Indemnifying Party shall, forthwith after demand by the
     Indemnified Party, reimburse the Indemnified Party for such payment.

10.7 SETTLEMENT OF THIRD PARTY CLAIMS.

     If the Indemnifying Party fails to assume control of the defense of any
     Third Party Claim, the Indemnified Party shall have the exclusive right to
     contest, settle or pay the amount claimed. Whether or not the Indemnifying
     Party assumes control of the negotiation, settlement or defense of any
     Third Party Claim, the Indemnifying Party shall not settle any Third Party
     Claim without the written consent of the Indemnified Party, which consent
     shall not be unreasonably withheld or delayed; provided, however, that the
     liability of the Indemnifying Party shall be limited to the proposed
     settlement amount if any such consent is not obtained for any reason.

10.8 CO-OPERATION.

     The Indemnified Party and the Indemnifying Party shall co-operate fully
     with each other with respect to Third Party Claims, and shall keep each
     other fully advised with respect


                                      -44-

<PAGE>

     thereto (including supplying copies of all relevant documentation promptly
     as it becomes available).

10.9 EXCLUSIVITY.

     The provisions of this Article 10 shall apply to any Claim for breach of
     any covenant, representation, warranty or other provision of this Agreement
     or any agreement, certificate or other document delivered pursuant hereto
     (other than a claim for specific performance or injunctive relief) with the
     intent that all such Claims shall be subject to the limitations and other
     provisions contained in this Article 10.

11.  MISCELLANEOUS

          be consummated, of the Corporation, which it may have acquired in
          connection with the transactions contemplated by this Agreement and in

               otherwise than at the request or occurrence of the Vendors and

          using any information concerning the business and affairs of any of
          the Purchaser and Vitran which it may have acquired in connection with
          the transactions contemplated by this Agreement and in addition, shall
          return all records or documents received from the Purchaser

               Vendors;

               Vendors of its obligations under this subsection 11.1(b);

     Purchaser may, at any time prior to the Time of Closing:

     (a)  assign all of its rights and obligations under this Agreement to any

          the obligations of the Purchaser under this Agreement as if it were an
          original signatory;

     (b)  assign all of its rights and obligations hereunder to a Subsidiary or
