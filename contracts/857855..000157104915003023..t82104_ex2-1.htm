that it is in the best interests of their respective companies and
shareholders for PLMT to merge with and into Parent, with Parent being the
surviving entity (the "Merger") pursuant to the terms of this Agreement and
have unanimously approved the Merger, upon the terms and subject to the

PLMT's shareholders approve this Agreement (the "PLMT Recommendation");

  


 

  

WHEREAS, the Merger is subject to the approvals of the shareholders of PLMT,
regulatory agencies, and the satisfaction of certain other conditions
described in this Agreement;

  


 

  

WHEREAS, Parent and PLMT desire to make certain representations, warranties,
covenants and agreements in connection with the Merger and also to prescribe
various conditions to the Merger;

  


 

  

WHEREAS, Parent and PLMT intend, (i) for federal income tax purposes, that the

ARTICLE 3

  

MANNER OF CONVERTING SHARES

  

  

3.1 Effect on PLMT Common Stock.

  

  

(a) At the Effective Time, in each case subject to Sections 3.1(d) and 3.2, by
virtue of the Merger and without any action on the part of the Parties, each
share of PLMT Common Stock that is issued and outstanding immediately prior to
the Effective Time (other than shares of PLMT Common Stock held by either
Party or any Subsidiary of either Party (in each case other than shares of
PLMT Common Stock held on behalf of third parties or held by any Parent Entity
or PLMT Entity as a result of debts previously contracted (such as a
foreclosure on a loan)) shall be converted into the right to receive one of
the following: (i) cash in the amount of $19.25 less any applicable
withholding Taxes (the "Cash Consideration"); (ii) a number of duly
authorized, validly issued, fully paid and non-assessable shares of Parent
Common Stock equal to the Exchange Ratio (the "Stock Consideration"); or (iii)
a combination of the Cash Consideration and Stock Consideration (the "Mixed
Consideration"), in such proportions as requested by PLMT shareholder to the
extent available after the proration of the total Merger Consideration to 70%
Stock Consideration and 30% Cash Consideration in accordance with Section 3.2
of this Agreement (items (i), (ii), or (iii) are referred to herein
individually as the "Per Share Purchase Price" and collectively as the "Merger
Consideration"). The "Exchange Ratio" shall be 0.97 shares of Parent Common
Stock.

  


 

  

(b) At the Effective Time, all shares of PLMT Common Stock shall no longer be
outstanding and shall automatically be cancelled and retired and shall cease
to exist as of the Effective Time, and each certificate previously
representing any such shares of PLMT Common Stock (the "Certificates") shall
thereafter represent only the right to receive the Per Share Purchase Price.

  


 

  

(c) If, prior to the Effective Time, the outstanding shares of PLMT Common
Stock, or the outstanding shares of Parent Common Stock, shall have been
increased, decreased, changed into or exchanged for a different number or kind
of shares or securities as a result of a reorganization, recapitalization,
reclassification, stock dividend, stock split, reverse stock split, or other
similar change in capitalization, or if a record date prior to the Effective
Time has been established with respect to any such change in capitalization,
then an appropriate and proportionate adjustment shall be made to the Per
Share Purchase Price.

  


 

  

(d) Each share of PLMT Common Stock issued and outstanding immediately prior
to the Effective Time and owned by any of the Parties or their respective
Subsidiaries (in each case other than shares of PLMT Common Stock held on
behalf of third parties or as a result of debts previously contracted) shall,
by virtue of the Merger and without any action on the part of the holder
thereof, cease to be outstanding, shall be cancelled and retired without
payment of any consideration, and shall cease to exist (the "Extinguished
Shares").

3.2 Election and Proration Procedures.

  


 

  

(a) An election form in such form as Parent and PLMT shall agree (an "Election
Form") shall be mailed on the Mailing Date (as defined below) to each holder
of record of PLMT Common Stock. Unless another date is agreed to by Parent and
PLMT prior to the Effective Time, the "Mailing Date" shall be the date on
which the Proxy/Registration Statement is first mailed to holders of PLMT
Common Stock. Parent shall make available Election Forms as may be reasonably
requested by all persons who become holders of PLMT Common Stock after the
record date for eligibility to vote at the PLMT Shareholders' Meeting and
prior to the Election Deadline (as defined herein), and PLMT shall provide to
Continental Stock Transfer and Trust Company or such other exchange agent
selected by Parent and reasonably acceptable to PLMT (the "Exchange Agent")
all information reasonably necessary for it to perform its obligations as
specified herein.

  


 

  

(b) Each Election Form shall entitle the holder of PLMT Common Stock (or the
beneficial owner through appropriate and customary documentation and
instructions) to elect to receive (i) the Stock Consideration for all of such
holder's shares (a "Stock Election"), (ii) the Cash Consideration for all of
such holder's shares (a "Cash Election"), (iii) the Mixed Consideration for
all of such holder's shares (a "Mixed Election") or (iv) make no election (a
"Non-Election"). Holders of record of PLMT Common Stock who hold such shares
as nominees, trustees or in other representative capacity (a "Holder
Representative") may submit multiple Election Forms, provided that such Holder
Representative certifies that each such Election Form covers all of the shares
of PLMT Common Stock held by that Holder Representative for a particular
beneficial owner. The shares of PLMT Common Stock as to which a Stock Election
has been made (including pursuant to a Mixed Election) are referred to herein
as "Stock Election Shares" and the aggregate number thereof is referred to
herein as the "Stock Election Number." The shares of PLMT Common Stock as to
which a Cash Election has been made (including pursuant to a Mixed Election)
are referred to herein as "Cash Election Shares" and the aggregate number
thereof is referred to as the "Cash Election Number." Shares of PLMT Common
Stock as to which no election has been made (or as to which an Election Form
is not properly completed or returned in a timely fashion) are referred to as
"Non-Election Shares."

  


 

  

(c) To be effective, a properly completed Election Form must be received by
the Exchange Agent on or prior to the date of the PLMT's Shareholders' Meeting
(or such other date as the Parties may mutually agree prior to the Effective
Time) (the "Election Deadline"). An election shall have been properly made
only if the Exchange Agent shall have actually received a properly completed
Election Form by the Election Deadline. For the holders of PLMT Common Stock
who make a Non-Election, subject to Section 3.2(e), Parent shall have the
authority to determine the type of consideration constituting the Per Share
Purchase Price to be exchanged for the Non-Election Shares. Any PLMT
shareholder may at any time prior to, but not after, the Election Deadline
change his or her election by written notice received by the Exchange Agent
prior to the Election Deadline accompanied by a properly completed and signed
revised Election Form. Any PLMT shareholder may, at any time prior to the
Election Deadline, revoke his or her election by written notice received by
the Exchange Agent prior to the Election Deadline or by withdrawal prior to
the Election Deadline of his or her Certificates, or of the guarantee of
delivery of such Certificates. All elections shall be revoked automatically if
the Exchange Agent is notified in writing by either Party that this Agreement
has been terminated prior to the Effective Time pursuant to Section 9.1 of
this Agreement. If a shareholder either (i) does not submit a properly
completed Election Form by the Election Deadline or (ii) revokes its Election
Form prior to the Election Deadline but does not submit a new properly
executed Election Form prior to the Election Deadline, the shares of PLMT
Common Stock held by such shareholder shall be designated as Non-Election
Shares. Subject to the terms of this Agreement and the Election Form, the
Exchange Agent shall have reasonable discretion to determine whether any
election, revocation or change has been properly made and to disregard
immaterial defects in any Election Form, and any good faith decisions of the
Exchange Agent regarding such matters shall be binding and conclusive.

(d) The number of shares of PLMT Common Stock to be converted into the right
to receive the Cash Consideration shall be equal to 30% of the number of
shares of PLMT Common Stock outstanding immediately prior to the Effective
Time (the "Aggregate Cash Limit") and the number of shares of PLMT Common
Stock to be converted into the right to receive the Stock Consideration shall
be equal to 70% of the number of shares of PLMT Common Stock outstanding
immediately prior to the Effective Time (the "Aggregate Stock Limit").

  

  

(e) Within three business days after the later to occur of the Election
Deadline or the Effective Time, Parent shall cause the Exchange Agent to
effect the allocation among holders of PLMT Common Stock of Rights to receive
the Per Share Purchase Price and to distribute such as follows:

  


 

  

(i) if the Stock Election Number exceeds the Aggregate Stock Limit, then all
Cash Election Shares and all Non-Election Shares shall be converted into the
right to receive the Cash Consideration, and each Stock Election Share shall
be converted into the right to receive (A) the Stock Consideration in respect
of that number of Stock Election Shares equal to the product obtained by
multiplying (1) the number of Stock Election Shares held by such holder by (2)
a fraction, the numerator of which is the Aggregate Stock Limit and the
denominator of which is the Stock Election Number and (B) the Cash
Consideration in respect of the remaining number of such Stock Election
Shares;

  


 

  

(ii) if the Cash Election Number exceeds the Aggregate Cash Limit, then all
Stock Election Shares and all Non-Election Shares shall be converted into the
right to receive the Stock Consideration, and each Cash Election Share shall
be converted into the right to receive (A) the Cash Consideration in respect
of that number of Cash Election Shares equal to the product obtained by
multiplying (1) the number of Cash Election Shares held by such holder by (2)
a fraction, the numerator of which is the Aggregate Cash Limit and the
denominator of which is the Cash Election Number and (B) the Stock
Consideration in respect of the remaining number of such Cash Election Shares;
and

  


 

  

(iii) if the Stock Election Number and the Cash Election Number do not exceed
the Aggregate Stock Limit and the Aggregate Cash Limit, respectively, then (i)
all Cash Election Shares shall be converted into the right to receive the Cash
Consideration, (ii) all Stock Election Shares shall be converted into the
right to receive the Stock Consideration, and (iii) all Non-Election Shares
shall be converted into the right to receive the Cash Consideration and/or the
Stock Consideration such that the aggregate number of shares of PLMT Common
Stock entitled to receive the Cash Consideration is equal to the Aggregate
Cash Limit and the aggregate number of shares of PLMT Common Stock entitled to
receive the Stock Consideration is equal to the Aggregate Stock Limit.

  


 

  

3.3 Exchange Procedures.

  


 

  

(a) On the Closing Date, Parent shall make available to the Exchange Agent,
for exchange in accordance with this Section 3.3, the Merger Consideration
(including cash in an aggregate amount sufficient for payment in lieu of
fractional shares of Parent Common Stock to which holders of PLMT Common Stock
may be entitled pursuant to Section 3.7); provided that as of the Effective
Time the Parent shall deliver to the Exchange Agent evidence of shares, in
book entry form, representing the number of shares of Parent Common Stock
issuable to the holders of PLMT Common Stock as part of the Merger
Consideration. In addition, Parent shall make available to the Exchange Agent,
as necessary from time to time at or after the Effective Time, any dividends
or other distributions payable pursuant to Section 3.3(f). All Merger
Consideration (including cash in an aggregate amount sufficient for payment in
lieu of fractional shares of Parent Common Stock to which holders of PLMT
Common Stock may be entitled pursuant to Section 3.7) and dividends and
distributions made available to the Exchange Agent pursuant to this Section
3.3(a) shall hereinafter be referred to as the "Exchange Fund." In the event
the cash in the Exchange Fund shall be insufficient to fully satisfy all of
the payment obligations to be made by the Exchange Agent hereunder (including
pursuant to Section 3.7), Parent shall promptly make available to the Exchange
Agent the amounts so required to satisfy such payment obligations in full. The
Exchange Agent shall deliver the Merger Consideration and cash in lieu of any
fractional shares of Parent Common Stock out of the Exchange Fund. Except as
contemplated by this Section 3.3, the Exchange Fund will not be used for any
other purpose.

(b) Unless different timing is agreed to by Parent and PLMT, as soon as
reasonably practicable after the Effective Time, but in any event no more than
five business days after the Effective Time, Parent shall cause the Exchange
Agent to mail to the former shareholders of PLMT appropriate transmittal
materials. The letter of transmittal shall provide instructions for the
submission of Certificates representing, immediately prior to the Effective
Time, shares of PLMT Common Stock (or an indemnity satisfactory to PLMT,
Parent and Exchange Agent, if any of such Certificates are lost, stolen, or
destroyed) to each holder of record of shares of PLMT Common Stock converted
into the right to receive the applicable portion of the Merger Consideration
at the Effective Time. In the event of a transfer of ownership of shares of
PLMT Common Stock represented by one or more Certificates that are not
registered in the transfer records of PLMT, the Per Share Purchase Price
payable for such shares as provided in Sections 3.1 and 3.2 may be issued to a
transferee if the Certificate or Certificates representing such shares are
delivered to the Exchange Agent, accompanied by all documents required to
evidence such transfer and by evidence reasonably satisfactory to the Exchange
Agent that such transfer is proper and that any applicable stock transfer
taxes have been paid. In the event any certificate representing PLMT Common
Stock certificate shall have been lost, mutilated, stolen, or destroyed, upon
the making of an affidavit of that fact by the person claiming such
certificate to be lost, mutilated, stolen, or destroyed and the posting by
such person of a bond in such amount as Parent may reasonably direct as
indemnity against any claim that may be made against it with respect to such
certificate, the Exchange Agent shall issue in exchange for such lost,
mutilated, stolen, or destroyed certificate the Per Share Purchase Price as
provided for in Sections 3.1 and 3.2 (together with any unpaid dividends or
distributions with respect thereto). The Exchange Agent may establish such
other reasonable and customary rules and procedures in connection with its
duties as it may deem appropriate. Parent shall pay all charges and expenses,
including those of the Exchange Agent in connection with the distribution of
the Per Share Purchase Price as provided in Sections 3.1 and 3.2. Parent or
its Exchange Agent will maintain a book entry list of Parent Common Stock to
which each former holder of PLMT Common Stock is entitled.

  


 

  

(c) After the Effective Time, each holder of shares of PLMT Common Stock
(other than Extinguished Shares) issued and outstanding at the Effective Time
shall surrender the Certificate or Certificates representing such shares to
the Exchange Agent and shall promptly (and in any event within five business
days) upon surrender thereof (or an indemnity satisfactory to PLMT, Parent and
Exchange Agent, if any of such certificates are lost, stolen, or destroyed)
receive in exchange therefor the consideration provided in Sections 3.1 and
3.2 (and any unpaid dividends or distributions thereon), without interest,
pursuant to this Section 3.3. The Certificate or Certificates of PLMT Common
Stock so surrendered shall be duly endorsed as the Exchange Agent may
reasonably require. Parent shall not be obligated to deliver the consideration
to which any former holder of PLMT Common Stock is entitled as a result of the
Merger until such holder surrenders such holder's Certificate or Certificates
for exchange (or an indemnity satisfactory to PLMT, Parent and Exchange Agent,
if any of such Certificates are lost, stolen, or destroyed) as provided in
this Section 3.3. Any other provision of this Agreement notwithstanding,
neither any Parent Entity, nor any PLMT Entity, nor the Exchange Agent shall
be liable to any holder of PLMT Common Stock for any amounts paid or properly
delivered in good faith to a public official pursuant to any applicable
abandoned property, escheat, or similar Law.

(d) Each of Parent and the Exchange Agent shall be entitled to deduct and
withhold from the consideration otherwise payable pursuant to this Agreement
to any holder of shares of PLMT Common Stock and PLMT Options such amounts, if
any, as it is required to deduct and withhold with respect to the making of
such payment under the Code or any provision of state, local, or foreign Tax
Law or by any Taxing Authority or Governmental Authority. To the extent that
any amounts are so withheld by Parent, the Surviving Corporation, or the
Exchange Agent, as the case may be, such withheld amounts shall be treated for
all purposes of this Agreement as having been paid to the holder of the shares
of PLMT Common Stock, as applicable in respect of which such deduction and
withholding was made by Parent, the Surviving Corporation, or the Exchange
Agent, as the case may be.

  


 

  

(e) Any portion of the Merger Consideration and cash delivered to the Exchange
Agent by Parent pursuant to Section 3.3(a) that remains unclaimed by the
holder of shares of PLMT Common Stock for one year after the Effective Time
(as well as any proceeds from any investment thereof) shall be delivered by
the Exchange Agent to Parent. Any holder of shares of PLMT Common Stock who
have not theretofore complied with Section 3.3(c) shall thereafter look only
to Parent for the consideration and any unpaid dividends or distributions
deliverable in respect of each share of PLMT Common Stock such holder holds as
determined pursuant to this Agreement without any interest thereon.

  


 

  

(f) No dividends or other distributions with respect to Parent Common Stock
shall be paid to the holder of any unsurrendered Certificate that immediately
prior to the Effective Time represented shares of PLMT Common Stock with
respect to the shares, if any, of Parent Common Stock represented thereby, in
each case unless and until the surrender of such Certificate (or an indemnity
satisfactory to PLMT, Parent and Exchange Agent, if any of such Certificates
are lost, stolen, or destroyed) in accordance with this Section 3.3. Subject
to the effect of applicable abandoned property, escheat or similar Laws,
following surrender of any such Certificate in accordance with this Section
3.3, the holder thereof shall be entitled to receive, without interest, (i)
the amount of dividends or other distributions with a record date after the
Effective Time theretofore payable with respect to the whole shares of Parent
Common Stock represented by such Certificate and not paid and/or (ii) at the
appropriate payment date, the amount of dividends or other distributions
payable with respect to whole shares of Parent Common Stock represented by
such Certificate with a record date after the Effective Time (but before such
surrender date) and with a payment date subsequent to the issuance of the
Parent Common Stock issuable with respect to such Certificate.

  


 

  

(g) Adoption of this Agreement by the shareholders of PLMT shall constitute
ratification of the appointment of the Exchange Agent.

  


 

  

3.4 Effect on Parent Common Stock.

  


 

  

At and after the Effective Time, each share of Parent Common Stock issued and
outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time shall remain an issued and
outstanding share of common stock of the Surviving Corporation and shall not
be affected by the Merger.

  


 

  

3.5 PLMT Options; PLMT Restricted Stock.

  


 

  

(a) At the Effective Time, all Rights with respect to PLMT Common Stock
pursuant to stock options granted by PLMT (the "PLMT Options") which are
outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time, whether or not
exercisable, shall be:

  


 

  

(i) With respect to all outstanding PLMT Options granted under the PLMT 2011
Stock Incentive Plan, converted at the Effective Time into an obligation of
Parent to pay (or cause to be paid) and a right of the holder to receive, in
full satisfaction of any Rights in respect of the PLMT Option, a cash payment
equal to the product obtained by multiplying (1) the number of shares of PLMT
Common Stock underlying such Person's PLMT Options by (2) the Weighted Average
Consideration Per Share less the exercise price per share under such option,
subject to any income or employment tax withholding required under the Code or
any provision of applicable Law. The amount determined in accordance with the
foregoing shall be paid to the applicable holder of a PLMT Option on the
Closing Date. The "Weighted Average Consideration Per Share" means the sum of:
(x) $19.25 x 0.30, plus (y) the Average Parent Stock Price x the Exchange
Ratio x 0.70.

--- 

 


--- 

   



    


 

  

(ii) With respect to all outstanding PLMT Options granted under the PLMT 1997
Stock Compensation Plan, converted into an option to purchase shares of Parent
Common Stock, each such PLMT Option so converted shall be exercisable upon the
same terms and conditions as under the PLMT 1997 Stock Compensation Plan and
the applicable option agreement issued thereunder, except that (i) each such
PLMT Option shall be exercisable for that whole number of shares of Parent
Common Stock (rounded to the nearest whole share) equal to the number of
shares of PLMT Common Stock subject to such PLMT Option immediately prior to
the Effective Time multiplied by the Exchange Ratio, and (ii) the option price
per share of Parent Common Stock shall be an amount equal to the option price
per share of PLMT Common Stock subject to such PLMT Option in effect
immediately prior to the Effective Time divided by the Exchange Ratio (the
option price per share, as so determined, being rounded to the nearest whole
cent). Prior to the Effective time, PLMT will use its reasonable best efforts
to enter into agreements with one or more holders of PLMT Options granted
under the PLMT 1997 Stock Compensation Plan to cancel such holder's PLMT
Options for consideration of $0.01 per share of PLMT Common Stock underlying
any such PLMT Options.

  


 

  

(b) At the Effective Time, each share of PLMT Common Stock subject to
restrictions on transfer and/or forfeiture granted under the PLMT 2008
Restricted Stock Plan or the 2011 Stock Incentive Plan (the "PLMT Restricted
Stock") that is issued and outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time
shall, as of the Effective Time, become fully vested and shall be converted
automatically into and shall thereafter represent the right to receive the
Merger Consideration, subject to any income or employment tax withholding
required under the Code or any provision of applicable Law, in accordance with
this Article 3. For the avoidance of doubt, like other holders of PLMT Common
Stock, holders of PLMT Restricted Stock shall be entitled, pursuant to the
terms and subject to the conditions and limitations of Section 3.2, to make an
election with respect to the Merger Consideration that each will receive.

  


 

  

(c) PLMT's board of directors or its compensation committee shall make any
adjustments or amendments to or make such determinations with respect to the
PLMT Options and PLMT Restricted Stock necessary to effect the foregoing
provisions of this Section 3.5.

  


 

  

3.6 Rights of Former PLMT Shareholders.

  


 

  

At the Effective Time, the stock transfer books of PLMT shall be closed as to
holders of PLMT Common Stock and no transfer of PLMT Common Stock by any
holder of such shares shall thereafter be made or recognized. Until
surrendered for exchange in accordance with the provisions of Section 3.3,
each Certificate theretofore representing shares of PLMT Common Stock (other
than Certificates representing Extinguished Shares), shall from and after the
Effective Time represent for all purposes only the right to receive the Per
Share Purchase Price and, if applicable, any unpaid dividends or
distributions, in each case without interest, as provided in Article 3.

3.7 Fractional Shares.

  


 

  

Notwithstanding any other provision of this Agreement, each holder of shares
of PLMT Common Stock exchanged pursuant to the Merger, who would otherwise
have been entitled to receive a fraction of a share of Parent Common Stock
(after taking into account all Certificates delivered by such holder), shall
receive, in lieu thereof, cash (without interest) in an amount equal to such
fractional part of a share of Parent Common Stock multiplied by the final
Average Parent Stock Price (as defined in Section 9.1(g)). No such holder will
be entitled to dividends, voting rights, or any other Rights as a shareholder
in respect of any fractional shares.

4.2 Authority of PLMT; No Breach By Agreement.

  


 

  

(a) PLMT has the corporate power and authority necessary (i) to execute,
deliver, and, other than with respect to the Merger, perform this Agreement,

Agreement represents a legal, valid, and binding obligation of PLMT,
enforceable against PLMT in accordance with its terms (except in all cases as
such enforceability may be limited by applicable bankruptcy,
insolvency, reorganization, moratorium, or similar Laws affecting the
enforcement of creditors' rights generally and except that the availability
of the equitable remedy of specific performance or injunctive relief is
subject to the discretion of the court before which any proceeding may be
brought).

  


 

  

(b) Neither the execution and delivery of this Agreement by PLMT, nor the
consummation by PLMT and Bank of the transactions contemplated hereby, nor
compliance by PLMT and Bank with any of the provisions hereof, will (i)
conflict with or result in a breach of any provision of PLMT's articles of
incorporation or bylaws or the articles of incorporation or bylaws of Bank or
any resolution adopted by the board of directors or the shareholders of any
PLMT Entity, or (ii) constitute or result in a Default under, or require any
Consent pursuant to, or result in the creation of any Lien on any Asset of any
PLMT Entity under, any Contract or Permit of any PLMT Entity, or (iii) and
subject to receipt of the regulatory approvals referred to in Section 8.1(b),
constitute or result in a Default under, or require any Consent pursuant to,
any Law or Order applicable to any PLMT Entity or any of their material
Assets, except, in the case of clauses (ii) and (iii) for any of the foregoing
that, individually or in the aggregate, would not reasonably be expected to
have a PLMT Material Adverse Effect.

  


 

  

(c) Except for (a) the filing of applications and notices with, and approval
of such applications and notices from, the Federal Reserve, the FDIC, the
South Carolina Board of Financial Institutions and the Georgia Department of
Banking and Finance, (b) the filing of any other required applications,

(b) Except for the 404,701 shares of PLMT Common Stock reserved for issuance
pursuant to outstanding PLMT Options, or as disclosed in Section 4.3 of PLMT
Disclosure Memorandum, there are no shares of capital stock or other equity
securities of PLMT reserved for issuance and no outstanding Rights relating to
the capital stock of PLMT. Section 4.3 of PLMT Disclosure Memorandum contains
a list that sets forth the holder, number of underlying shares of PLMT Common
Stock, the applicable PLMT equity plan, and expiration date with respect to
all PLMT Options, and the holder, applicable PLMT equity plan and number of
shares with respect to all unvested PLMT Restricted Stock, outstanding on the

4.4 PLMT Subsidiaries.

  


 

  

PLMT has no Subsidiaries except as set forth in Section 4.4 of PLMT Disclosure
Memorandum, and PLMT owns all of the equity interests in each of its
Subsidiaries. No capital stock (or other equity interest) of any such
Subsidiary is or may become required to be issued (other than to another PLMT
Entity) by reason of any Rights, and there are no Contracts by which any such
Subsidiary is bound to issue (other than to another PLMT Entity) additional
shares of its capital stock (or other equity interests) or Rights or by which
any PLMT Entity is or may be bound to transfer any shares of the capital stock
(or other equity interests) of any such Subsidiary (other than to another PLMT
Entity). There are no Contracts relating to the Rights of any PLMT Entity to
vote or to dispose of any shares of the capital stock (or other equity
interests) of any such Subsidiary. All of the shares of capital stock (or
other equity interests) of each Subsidiary are fully paid and nonassessable
and are owned directly or indirectly by PLMT free and clear of any Lien. Each
Subsidiary is duly qualified or licensed to transact business as a foreign
entity in good standing in the states of the United States and foreign
jurisdictions where the character of its Assets or the nature or conduct of
its business requires it to be so qualified or licensed, except for such
jurisdictions in which the failure to be so qualified or licensed is not
reasonably likely to have, individually or in the aggregate, a PLMT Material
Adverse Effect.

  


 

  

4.5 Exchange Act Filings; Securities Offerings; Financial Statements.

  


 

  

(a) PLMT has timely filed all Exchange Act Documents required to be filed by
PLMT since January 1, 2014 (the "PLMT Exchange Act Reports"). PLMT Exchange
Act Reports (i) at the time filed, (or, if amended or superseded by a filing
prior to the date of this Agreement, then on the date of such filing) complied
in all material respects with the applicable requirements of the Securities
Laws and other applicable Laws and (ii) did not, at the time they were filed
(or, if amended or superseded by a filing prior to the date of this Agreement,
then on the date of such filing) contain any untrue statement of a material
fact or omit to state a material fact required to be stated in such PLMT
Exchange Act Reports or necessary in order to make the statements in such PLMT
Exchange Act Reports not misleading. Each offering or sale of securities by
PLMT (i) was either registered under the Securities Act or made pursuant to a
valid exemption from registration, (ii) complied in all material respects with
the applicable requirements of the Securities Laws and other applicable Laws,
except for immaterial late "blue sky" filings, including disclosure and
broker/dealer registration requirements, and (iii) was made pursuant to
offering documents which did not, at the time of the offering (or, in the case
of registration statements, at the effective date thereof) contain any untrue
statement of a material fact or omit to state a material fact required to be
stated in the offering documents or necessary in order to make the statements
in such documents not misleading. PLMT's principal executive officer and
principal financial officer have made the certifications required by Sections
302 and 906 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act and the rules and regulations of the
Exchange Act thereunder with respect to PLMT Exchange Act Reports to the
extent such rules or regulations applied at the time of the filing. For
purposes of the preceding sentence, "principal executive officer" and
"principal financial officer" shall have the meanings given to such terms in
the Sarbanes-Oxley Act. Such certifications contain no qualifications or
exceptions to the matters certified therein and have not been modified or
withdrawn; and neither PLMT nor any of its officers has received notice from
any Regulatory Authority questioning or challenging the accuracy,
completeness, content, form, or manner of filing or submission of such
certifications. No PLMT Subsidiary is required to file any Exchange Act
Documents.

(b) Each of PLMT Financial Statements (including, in each case, any related
notes) that are contained in PLMT Exchange Act Reports, including any PLMT
Exchange Act Reports filed after the date of this Agreement until the
Effective Time, complied, or will comply, as to form in all material respects
with the Exchange Act, was, or will be, prepared in accordance with GAAP
applied on a consistent basis throughout the periods involved (except as may
be indicated in the notes to such financial statements or, in the case of
unaudited interim statements, as permitted by Form 10-Q of the Exchange Act),
fairly presented in accordance with GAAP the consolidated financial position
of PLMT and its Subsidiaries as of the respective dates and the consolidated
results of operations and cash flows for the periods indicated, including the
fair values of the assets and liabilities shown therein, except that the
unaudited interim financial statements were or are subject to normal and
recurring year-end adjustments which were not or are not expected to be
material in amount or effect, and were certified to the extent required by the
Sarbanes-Oxley Act.

  


 

  

(c) PLMT's independent registered public accountants, which have expressed
their opinion with respect to the Financial Statements of PLMT and its

(d) PLMT maintains disclosure controls and procedures as required by Rule
13a-15 or 15d-15 under the Exchange Act, and such controls and procedures are
effective to ensure that all material information relating to PLMT and its
Subsidiaries is made known on a timely basis to PLMT's principal executive
officer and PLMT's principal financial officer.

  


 

  

4.6 Absence of Undisclosed Liabilities.

  


 

  

No PLMT Entity has any Liabilities required under GAAP to be set forth on a
consolidated balance sheet or in the notes thereto that are reasonably likely
to have, individually or in the aggregate, a PLMT Material Adverse Effect,
except Liabilities which are (i) accrued or reserved against in the
consolidated balance sheet of PLMT as of December 31, 2014, included in PLMT
Financial Statements or reflected in the notes thereto, (ii) incurred in the
ordinary course of business consistent with past practices, or (iii) incurred
in connection with the transactions contemplated by this Agreement. Neither
PLMT nor any of its Subsidiaries is a party to, or has any commitment to
become a party to, any joint venture, off-balance sheet partnership or any
similar Contract or arrangement (including any Contract or arrangement
relating to any transaction or relationship between or among PLMT and any of
its Subsidiaries, on the one hand, and any unconsolidated Affiliate, including
any structured finance, special purpose or limited purpose entity or Person,
on the other hand, or any "off-balance sheet arrangement"), where the result,
purpose or intended effect of such Contract or arrangement is to avoid
disclosure of any material transaction involving, or material liabilities of,
PLMT or any of its Subsidiaries in PLMT's or such Subsidiary's financial
statements.

4.7 Absence of Certain Changes or Events.

  


 

  

Except as disclosed in PLMT Financial Statements delivered prior to the date
of this Agreement, from December 31, 2014 through the date of this Agreement
(i) there have been no events, changes, or occurrences which have had, or are
reasonably likely to have, individually or in the aggregate, a PLMT Material
Adverse Effect, and (ii) since December 31, 2014, PLMT Entities have conducted
their respective businesses in the ordinary course of business consistent with
past practice.

  


 

  

4.8 Tax Matters.

  


 

  

(a) All PLMT Entities have timely filed (taking into account any applicable
extensions) with the appropriate Taxing Authorities (i) all income Tax Returns
and (ii) all other Tax Returns where the failure to file such Tax Returns
would be reasonably expected to result in a material Liability, in all
jurisdictions in which Tax Returns are required to be filed, and such Tax
Returns are correct and complete in all respects. All Taxes of PLMT Entities
(whether or not shown on any Tax Return) have been fully and timely paid other
than Taxes being contested in good faith for which adequate reserves have been
established on the financial statements of PLMT in accordance with GAAP. There
are no Liens for any Taxes (other than a Lien for Taxes not yet due and
payable or being contested in good faith through appropriate proceedings, for
which adequate reserves have been established on the financial statement of
Parent in accordance with GAAP) on any of the Assets of any PLMT Entity.

  


 

  

(b) None of PLMT Entities has received any notice of assessment or proposed
assessment in connection with any Taxes, and there are no threatened or
pending disputes, claims, audits, or examinations regarding any Taxes of any
PLMT Entity, any Tax Returns of any PLMT Entity, or the assets of any PLMT
Entity. No officer or employee responsible for Tax matters of any PLMT Entity
expects any Taxing Authority to assess any additional Taxes for any period for
which Tax Returns have been filed. No issue has been raised by a Taxing
Authority in any prior examination of any PLMT Entity which, by application of
the same or similar principles, could be expected to result in a deficiency
for any subsequent taxable period. None of PLMT Entities has waived any
statute of limitations in respect of any Taxes or agreed to a Tax assessment
or deficiency.

  


 

  

(c) Each PLMT Entity has complied in all material respects with all applicable
Laws relating to the withholding of Taxes and the payment thereof to
appropriate authorities, including Taxes required to have been withheld and
paid in connection with amounts paid or owing to any employee or independent
contractor, and Taxes required to be withheld and paid pursuant to Sections
1441 and 1442 of the Code or similar provisions under foreign Law, and all Tax
Returns (including without limitation all IRS Forms W-2 and 1099) required
with respect thereto have been properly completed and timely filed (taking
into account any applicable extensions) with, and supplied to, the appropriate
parties.

  


 

  

(d) The unpaid Taxes of each PLMT Entity (i) did not, as of the most recent
fiscal month end, materially exceed the accrual for Tax Liability (rather than
any reserve for deferred Taxes established to reflect timing differences
between book and Tax income) included in the most recent balance sheet (rather
than in any notes thereto) for such PLMT Entity and (ii) do not materially
exceed that accrual as adjusted for the passage of time through the Closing
Date in accordance with past custom and practice of PLMT Entities in filing
their Tax Returns.

(e) Other than the Tax allocation agreement between PLMT and the Bank (which

to any Tax allocation or sharing agreement. Except for the affiliated group of
which PLMT is the common parent, none of PLMT Entities has been a member of an
affiliated group filing a consolidated federal income Tax Return or has any
Tax Liability of any Person (other than PLMT and the Bank) under Treasury
Regulation Section 1.1502-6 or any similar provision of state, local or
foreign Law, or as a transferee or successor, by Contract or otherwise.

  


 

  

(f) During the five-year period ending on the date hereof, none of PLMT
Entities was a "distributing corporation" or a "controlled corporation" as
defined in, and in a transaction intended to be governed by Section 355 of the
Code.

  


 

  

(g) Neither PLMT nor the Bank has taken any action, failed to take any action,
or knows of any fact that would be reasonably expected to prevent the Merger
from qualifying as a "reorganization" within the meaning of Section 368(a) of
the Code.

  


 

  

(h) Except as disclosed in Section 4.8(h) of PLMT Disclosure Memorandum, none
of PLMT Entities has made any payments, is obligated to make any payments, or
is a party to any Contract that could obligate it to make any payments that
could be disallowed as a deduction under Section 280G or 162(m) of the Code,
or which would be subject to withholding under Section 4999 of the Code. None
of PLMT Entities has been during the past three years or will be (except
potentially to conform with the "Tangible Property Regulations" pursuant to
Rev. Proc. 2014-16, §§1.162-3, 1.162-4, 1.263(a)-1, 1.263(a)-2, and 1.263(a)-3
of the Income Tax Regulations and §§1.162-3T, 1.162-4T, 1.263(a)-1T,
1.263(a)-2T, and 1.263(a)-3T of the temporary regulations) required to include
any adjustment in taxable income for any Tax period (or portion thereof)
pursuant to Section 481 of the Code or any comparable provision under state or
foreign Tax Laws as a result of transactions or events occurring prior to the
Closing. Any net operating losses of PLMT Entities are not subject to any
limitation on their use under the provisions of Sections 382 or 269 of the
Code or, to the best of PLMT's Knowledge, any other provisions of the Code or
the Treasury Regulations dealing with the utilization of net operating losses
other than any such limitations as may arise as a result of the consummation
of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement.

  


 

  

(i) Except for transactions entered into in the normal course of PLMT's
banking operations, PLMT has not taken any action not in accordance with past
practice that would have the effect of deferring a measure of Tax from a
period (or portion thereof) ending on or before the Closing Date to a period
(or portion thereof) beginning after the Closing Date. PLMT has no deferred
income or other Tax Liability arising out of any transaction, including,
without limitation, any (i) intercompany transaction (as defined in Treasury
Regulations Section 1.1502-13), (ii) the disposal of any property in a
transaction accounted for under the installment method pursuant to Section 453
of the Code, (iii) excess loss account (as defined in Treasury Regulations
Section 1.1502-19) with respect to the stock of any subsidiary of PLMT, (iv)
use of the long-term contract method of accounting, or (v) receipt of any
prepaid amount on or before the Closing Date. Neither PLMT nor the Bank has
made an election under Section 108(i) of the Code (or any corresponding
provision of state, local or foreign Law). Except for transactions entered
into in the normal course of PLMT's banking operations, PLMT has no deferred
income or other Tax Liability arising out of any transaction, including,

transaction accounted for under the installment method pursuant to Section 453

such records identify with specificity all accounts subject to backup

(b) As of the date hereof, the loans, discounts and leases (in which any PLMT
Entity is lessor) reflected on PLMT Financial Statements were in all material
respects, and with respect to the consolidated balance sheets delivered as of
the dates subsequent to the execution of this Agreement will in all material
respects be as of the dates thereof, (a) at the time and under the

of any nature whatsoever, except (i) statutory Liens securing payments not yet
due, (ii) Liens for real property taxes not yet delinquent (or being contested

easements, rights of way and other similar encumbrances and matters of record
that do not materially adversely affect the use of the properties or assets

or irregularities of title or Liens as do not materially affect the use of the
properties or assets subject thereto or affected thereby or otherwise

(c) Since December 31, 2011, no PLMT Entity has effectuated (i) a "plant
closing" (as defined in the Worker Adjustment and Retraining Notification Act
(the "WARN Act")) affecting any site of employment or one or more facilities
or operating units within any site of employment or facility of any PLMT

4.15 Employee Benefit Plans.

  


 

  

(a) PLMT has disclosed in Section 4.15 of PLMT Disclosure Memorandum, and has
delivered or made available to Parent prior to the execution of this
Agreement, (i) copies of each Employee Benefit Plan currently adopted,
maintained by, sponsored in whole or in part by, or contributed or required to
be contributed to by any PLMT Entity or ERISA Affiliate thereof for the
benefit of current or former employees, officers, retirees, directors,
independent contractors, leased employees or other service providers, or their
spouses, dependents or beneficiaries or under which any of them are eligible
to participate and (ii) a list of each Employee Benefit Plan that is not
identified in (i) above (e.g., former Employee Benefit Plans) but for which
any PLMT Entity or ERISA Affiliate has or reasonably could have any obligation
or Liability (contingent or otherwise) (each, a "PLMT Benefit Plan," and
collectively, the "PLMT Benefit Plans"). Any of PLMT Benefit Plans which is an
"employee pension benefit plan," as that term is defined in ERISA Section
3(2), is referred to herein as a "PLMT ERISA Plan." Each PLMT ERISA Plan which
is also a "defined benefit plan" (as defined in Code Section 414(j)) is
referred to herein as a "PLMT Pension Plan," and is identified as such in
Section 4.15 of PLMT Disclosure Memorandum.

  


 

  

(b) PLMT has delivered or made available to Parent prior to the execution of
this Agreement (i) all trust agreements or other funding arrangements for all
PLMT Benefit Plans, (ii) all determination letters, rulings, opinion letters,
information letters, or advisory opinions issued by the United States Internal
Revenue Service ("IRS"), the United States Department of Labor ("DOL") or the
Pension Benefit Guaranty Corporation ("PBGC") during this calendar year or the
preceding calendar year (2014), (iii) any filing or documentation (whether or
not filed with the IRS) where corrective action was taken in connection with
the IRS EPCRS program set forth in Revenue Procedure 2013-12 as modified by
2015-27 (or its predecessor or successor rulings) for the current plan year
and the preceding plan year, (iv) annual reports or returns, audited or
unaudited financial statements, actuarial reports, and valuations prepared for
any PLMT Benefit Plan for the current plan year, (v) the most recent summary
plan descriptions and any material modifications thereto and (vi) all material
correspondence from or to the IRS, DOL or PBGC regarding any PLMT Benefit Plan
received or sent during this calendar year or the preceding calendar year
(2014).

(c) Each PLMT Benefit Plan is, and has been administered, in material
compliance with the terms of such PLMT Benefit Plan, in material compliance
with the applicable requirements of the Code, in material compliance with the
applicable requirements of ERISA, and in material compliance with any other
applicable Laws. Since December 31, 2011, PLMT has not received any written
communication from any Governmental Authority challenging the compliance of
any PLMT Benefit Plan with applicable Laws. No PLMT Benefit Plan is currently
being or, to PLMT's knowledge, threatened to be, audited by any Governmental
Authority for compliance with applicable Laws.

  


 

  

(d) To PLMT's Knowledge, there has been no material written or oral
representation or communication with respect to any aspect of the PLMT Benefit
Plans made to employees of any PLMT Entity which is not in accordance with the
written or otherwise preexisting terms and provisions of such plans. Neither
PLMT, any PLMT Entity nor any administrator or fiduciary of any PLMT Benefit
Plan (or any agent of any of the foregoing) has engaged in any transaction, or
acted or failed to act in any manner, which could subject PLMT any PLMT Entity
or Parent to any direct or indirect Liability (by indemnity or otherwise) for
breach of any fiduciary, co-fiduciary, or other duty under ERISA. There are no
unresolved claims or disputes under the terms of, or in connection with, PLMT
Benefit Plans other than claims for benefits which are payable in the ordinary
course of business consistent with the terms of the applicable plan, and no
action, proceeding, prosecution, inquiry, hearing or, to PLMT's Knowledge,
investigation has been commenced or threatened with respect to any PLMT
Benefit Plan.

  


 

  

(e) All PLMT Benefit Plan documents and annual reports or returns, audited or
unaudited financial statements, actuarial valuations, summary annual reports,
and summary plan descriptions issued with respect to PLMT Benefit Plans are
correct and complete in all material respects, have been timely filed with the
IRS, the DOL or PBGC, and distributed to participants of PLMT Benefit Plans
(as required by Law), and there have been no changes in the information set
forth therein.

  


 

  

(f) To PLMT's Knowledge, no "party in interest" (as defined in ERISA Section
3(14)) or "disqualified person" (as defined in Code Section 4975(e)(2)) of any
PLMT Benefit Plan has engaged in any nonexempt "prohibited transaction"
(described in Code Section 4975(c) or ERISA Section 406).

  


 

  

(g) No Liability under Title IV of ERISA has been or is expected to be
incurred by any PLMT Entity or its ERISA Affiliates and no event has occurred
that could reasonably result in Liability under Title IV of ERISA being
incurred by any PLMT Entity or its ERISA Affiliates with respect to any
ongoing, frozen, terminated, or other single-employer plan of any PLMT Entity
or the single-employer plan of any ERISA Affiliate. Except as may arise in
connection with the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, there has
been no "reportable event," within the meaning of ERISA Section 4043, for
which the 30-day reporting requirement has not been waived by any ongoing,
frozen, terminated or other single employer plan of PLMT or of an ERISA
Affiliate.

  


 

  

(h) Except as disclosed in Section 4.15 of PLMT Disclosure Memorandum, no PLMT
Entity has any Liability for retiree health or life benefits under any of PLMT
Benefit Plans, or other plan or arrangement, and there are no restrictions on
the Rights of such PLMT Entity to amend or terminate any such retiree health
or benefit plan without incurring any Liability thereunder, except to the
extent required under Part 6 of Title I of ERISA or Code Section 4980B. No Tax
under Code Sections 4980B or 5000 has been incurred with respect to any PLMT
Benefit Plan, or other plan or arrangement, and no circumstance exists which
could give rise to such Taxes.

(i) Except as disclosed in Section 4.15 of PLMT Disclosure Memorandum, neither
the execution and delivery of this Agreement nor the consummation of the
transactions contemplated hereby (whether alone or in connection with any
other event) will (i) result in or increase any payment (including severance,
unemployment compensation, golden parachute, or otherwise) becoming due to any
director or any employee of any PLMT Entity from any PLMT Entity under any
PLMT Benefit Plan or otherwise, (ii) increase any benefits otherwise payable
under any PLMT Benefit Plan, or (iii) result in any acceleration of the time
of payment or vesting of any such payment or benefit, or any benefit under any
life insurance owned by any PLMT Entity or the Rights of any PLMT Entity in,
to or under any insurance on the life of any current or former officer,
director, or employee of any PLMT Entity, or change any Rights or obligations
of any PLMT Entity with respect to such insurance or (iv) result in an "excess
parachute payment" within the meaning of Section 280G of the Code.

  


 

  

(j) Section 4.15 of PLMT Disclosure Memorandum sets forth preliminary
calculations, based on assumptions set forth therein, of the following: (A)
the amount of all payments and benefits to which each individual set forth on
such PLMT Disclosure Memorandum is entitled to receive, pursuant to all
employment, salary continuation, bonus, change in control, and all other
agreements, plans and arrangements, in connection with a termination of
employment before or following, or otherwise in connection with or contingent
upon, the transactions contemplated under this Agreement (for the avoidance of
doubt, excluding payments or benefits in respect of vested equity awards)
(each such total amount in respect of each such individual, the "Change in
Control Benefit"), other than the payment any such individual shall otherwise
be entitled to receive as a gross-up payment in respect of any excise tax
imposed on the individual pursuant to Section 4999 of the Code as calculated
pursuant to the applicable agreement (any each such payment, a "Gross-Up
Payment"); (B) the amount of any Gross-Up Payment payable to each such
individual; and (C) the aggregate amount of all Change in Control Benefits and
Gross-Up Payments.

  


 

  

(k) Except as disclosed in Section 4.15 of PLMT Disclosure Memorandum, no PLMT
Benefit Plan is or has been funded by, associated with, or related to a
"voluntary employee's beneficiary association" within the meaning of Section
501(c)(9) of the Code, a "welfare benefit fund" within the meaning of Section
419 of the Code, a "qualified asset account" within the meaning of Section
419A of the Code or a "multiple employer welfare arrangement" within the
meaning of Section 3(40) of ERISA. The actuarial present values of all accrued
deferred compensation entitlements (including entitlements under any executive
compensation, supplemental retirement, or employment agreement) of employees
and former employees of any PLMT Entity and their respective beneficiaries,
other than entitlements accrued pursuant to funded retirement plans, whether
or not subject to the provisions of Code Section 412 or ERISA Section 302,
have been fully reflected on PLMT Financial Statements to the extent required
by and in accordance with GAAP.

  


 

  

(l) Each PLMT Benefit Plan which is a "nonqualified deferred compensation
plan" (within the meaning of Section 409A of the Code) has been operated in
compliance with Section 409A of the Code and the guidance issued by the IRS
with respect to such plans or is not required to comply therewith due to its
grandfathered status under Section 409A of the Code.

  


 

  

(m) All individuals who render services to any PLMT Entity and who are
authorized to participate in a PLMT Benefit Plan pursuant to the terms of such
PLMT Benefit Plan are in fact eligible to and authorized to participate in
such PLMT Benefit Plan. To PLMT's Knowledge, all PLMT Entities have, for
purposes of the PLMT Benefit Plans and all other purposes, correctly
classified all individuals performing services for such PLMT Entity as common
law employees, independent contractors or agents, as applicable.

(n) Except as disclosed in Section 4.15 of PLMT Disclosure Memorandum, neither
any PLMT Entity nor any of its ERISA Affiliates has had an "obligation to
contribute" (as defined in ERISA Section 4212) to, or other obligations or
Liability in connection with, a "multiemployer plan" (as defined in ERISA
Sections 4001(a)(3) or 3(37)(A)) or any employee pension benefit plan within
the meaning of ERISA Section 3(2) that is subject to Section 412 of the Code
or Section 302 of ERISA or a multiple employer plan within the meaning of
Section 413(c) of the Code or ERISA Sections 4063, 4064 or 4066.

  


 

  

(o) There are no payments or changes in terms due to any insured person as a
result of this Agreement, the Merger or the transactions contemplated herein,
under any bank-owned, corporate-owned split dollar life insurance, other life
insurance, or similar arrangement or Contract of any PLMT Entity.

  


 

  

(p) To PLMT's Knowledge, each PLMT ERISA Plan that is intended to qualify
under Section 401(a) of the Code so qualifies, and its related trust is tax
exempt under Section 501(a) of the Code, and no event has occurred and no
condition exists that could cause the loss of such qualified or tax exempt
status.

  


 

  

(q) Except as disclosed in Section 4.15 of the PLMT Disclosure Memorandum,

made under Sections 412 and 430 of the Code with respect to such PLMT Pension
Plan have been made timely, (ii) there has been no application for any waiver
of the minimum funding standards imposed by Section 412 of the Code, and such
minimum funding standards have been met to date, and (iii) there is not any
"amount of unfunded benefit liabilities" as defined in Section 4001(a)(18) of
ERISA under such PLMT Pension Plan.

Agreement none of PLMT Entities, nor any of their respective Assets,

Default thereunder; and (iii) no other party to any such Contract is, to

PLMT's internal control over financial reporting is effective to provide
reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of PLMT's financial reporting
and the preparation of PLMT financial statements for external purposes in

financial statements in accordance with GAAP and that receipts and

Parent and any of its Subsidiaries, on the one hand, and any unconsolidated
Affiliate, including any structured finance, special purpose or limited
purpose entity or Person, on the other hand, or any "off-balance sheet

5.8 Tax Matters.

  


 

  

(a) All Parent Entities have timely filed (taking into account any applicable
extensions) with the appropriate Taxing Authorities (i) all income Tax Returns
and (ii) all other Tax Returns where the failure to file such Tax Returns

jurisdictions in which Tax Returns are required to be filed, and such Tax
Returns are correct and complete in all respects. All Taxes of Parent Entities
(whether or not shown on any Tax Return) have been fully and timely paid other
than Taxes being contested in good faith for which adequate reserves have been
established on the financial statement of Parent in accordance with GAAP.
There are no Liens for any Taxes (other than a Lien for Taxes not yet due and

which adequate reserves have been established on the financial statement of
Parent in accordance with GAAP) on any of the Assets of any Parent Entity.

  


 

  

(b) None of Parent Entities has received any notice of assessment or proposed
assessment in connection with any Taxes, and there are no threatened or
pending disputes, claims, audits, or examinations regarding any Taxes of any
Parent Entity, any Tax Return of any Parent Entity or the assets of any Parent
Entity. No officer or employee responsible for Tax matters of any Parent
Entity expects any Taxing Authority to assess any additional Taxes for any
period for which Tax Returns have been filed. No issue has been raised by a
Taxing Authority in any prior examination of any Parent entity which, by
application of the same or similar principles, could be expected to result in
a deficiency for any subsequent taxable period. None of Parent Entities has
waived any statute of limitations in respect of any Taxes or agreed to a Tax
assessment or deficiency.

into account any applicable extensions) with, and supplied to, the appropriate
parties.

  


 

  

(d) The unpaid Taxes of each Parent Entity (i) did not, as of the most recent

any reserve for deferred Taxes established to reflect timing differences
between book and Tax income) included in the most recent balance sheet (rather
than in any notes thereto) for such Parent Entity and (ii) do not materially
exceed that accrual as adjusted for the passage of time through the Closing

the Code. None of Parent Entities has been during the past three years or will
be (except potentially to conform with the "Tangible Property Regulations"
pursuant to Rev. Proc. 2014-16, §§1.162-3, 1.162-4, 1.263(a)-1, 1.263(a)-2,
and 1.263(a)-3 of the Income Tax Regulations and §§1.162-3T, 1.162-4T,

portion thereof) pursuant to Section 481 of the Code or any comparable

a list of each Employee Benefit Plan that is not identified in (i) above

Plans are correct and complete in all material respects, have been timely
filed with the IRS, the DOL or PBGC, and distributed to participants of Parent
Benefit Plans (as required by Law), and there have been no changes in the
information set forth therein.

  


 

  

(e) To Parent's Knowledge, no "party in interest" (as defined in ERISA Section
3(14)) or "disqualified person" (as defined in Code Section 4975(e)(2)) of any
Parent Benefit Plan has engaged in any nonexempt "prohibited transaction"
(described in Code Section 4975(c) or ERISA Section 406).

  


 

  

(f) No Liability under Title IV of ERISA has been or is expected to be
incurred by any Parent Entity or its ERISA Affiliates and no event has
occurred that could reasonably result in Liability under Title IV of ERISA
being incurred by any Parent Entity or its ERISA Affiliates with respect to
any ongoing, frozen, terminated, or other single-employer plan of any Parent
Entity or the single-employer plan of any ERISA Affiliate. Except as may arise
in connection with the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, there has
been no "reportable event," within the meaning of ERISA Section 4043, for
which the 30-day reporting requirement has not been waived by any ongoing,
frozen, terminated or other single employer plan of Parent or of an ERISA
Affiliate.

  


 

  

(g) Except as disclosed in Section 5.11 of Parent Disclosure Memorandum, no
Parent Entity has any Liability for retiree health or life benefits under any
of Parent Benefit Plans, or other plan or arrangement, and there are no
restrictions on the Rights of such Parent Entity to amend or terminate any
such retiree health or benefit plan without incurring any Liability
thereunder, except to the extent required under Part 6 of Title I of ERISA or
Code Section 4980B. No Tax under Code Sections 4980B or 5000 has been incurred
with respect to any Parent Benefit Plan, or other plan or arrangement, and no
circumstance exists which could give rise to such Taxes.

  


 

  

(h) No Parent Benefit Plan is or has been funded by, associated with, or
related to a "voluntary employee's beneficiary association" within the meaning
of Section 501(c)(9) of the Code, a "welfare benefit fund" within the meaning
of Section 419 of the Code, a "qualified asset account" within the meaning of
Section 419A of the Code or a "multiple employer welfare arrangement" within
the meaning of Section 3(40) of ERISA. The actuarial present values of all
accrued deferred compensation entitlements (including entitlements under any
executive compensation, supplemental retirement, or employment agreement) of
employees and former employees of any Parent Entity and their respective
beneficiaries, other than entitlements accrued pursuant to funded retirement
plans, whether or not subject to the provisions of Code Section 412 or ERISA
Section 302, have been fully reflected on Parent Financial Statements to the
extent required by and in accordance with GAAP.

  


 

  

(i) Each Parent Benefit Plan which is a "nonqualified deferred compensation
plan" (within the meaning of Section 409A of the Code) has been operated in
compliance with Section 409A of the Code and the guidance issued by the IRS
with respect to such plans or is not required to comply therewith due to its
grandfathered status under Section 409A of the Code.

  


 

  

(j) All individuals who render services to any Parent Entity and who are
authorized to participate in a Parent Benefit Plan pursuant to the terms of
such Parent Benefit Plan are in fact eligible to and authorized to participate
in such Parent Benefit Plan.

  


 

  

(k) Neither any Parent Entity nor any of its ERISA Affiliates has had an
"obligation to contribute" (as defined in ERISA Section 4212) to, or other
obligations or Liability in connection with, a "multiemployer plan" (as
defined in ERISA Sections 4001(a)(3) or 3(37)(A)), or any employee pension
benefit plan within the meaning of ERISA Section 3(2) that is subject to
Section 412 of the Code or Section 302 of ERISA, or a multiple employer plan
within the meaning of Section 413(c) of the Code or ERISA Sections 4063, 4064
or 4066.

As of the date of this Agreement, there is no material Litigation instituted

Entity, or any director, officer, employee, or agent of any Parent Entity in

agreed to take any action or has any Knowledge of any fact or circumstance
that is reasonably likely to materially impede or delay receipt of any
regulatory approvals from any Governmental Authority required for the
consummation of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement. As of the
date of this Agreement, Parent knows of no facts or circumstances that are
reasonably likely to cause any regulatory approvals from any Governmental
Authority required for the consummation of the transactions contemplated by
this Agreement not to be obtained on a timely basis.

  


 

  

5.15 Takeover Laws and Provisions.

  


 

  

Parent has taken all necessary action, if any, to render inapplicable to this
Agreement, the Merger and the other transactions contemplated in this
Agreement the provisions of any potentially applicable Takeover Provisions

of Incorporation or similar Parent Bylaws provision is applicable to this
Agreement and the transactions contemplated hereby.

  


 

  

5.16 Brokers and Finders.

  


 

  

Except for Parent Financial Advisor, neither Parent nor its Subsidiaries, has

by Parent with the SEC will, when the Registration Statement becomes
effective, be false or misleading with respect to any material fact, or omit
to state any material fact necessary to make the statements therein, in light
of the circumstances under which they were made, not misleading. None of the
information supplied or to be supplied by any Parent Entity or any Affiliate
thereof for inclusion in any Proxy Statement/Prospectus to be mailed to PLMT
shareholders in connection with PLMT's Shareholders' Meeting, and any other
documents to be filed by any Parent Entity or any Affiliate thereof with the
SEC or any other Regulatory Authority in connection with the transactions
contemplated hereby, will, at the respective time such documents are filed,
and with respect to the Proxy Statement/Prospectus, when first mailed to the
shareholders of PLMT be false or misleading with respect to any material fact,
or omit to state any material fact necessary to make the statements therein,
in light of the circumstances under which they were made, not misleading, or,
in the case of the Proxy Statement/Prospectus or any amendment thereof or
supplement thereto, at the time of PLMT's Shareholders' Meeting be false or
misleading with respect to any material fact, or omit to state any material
fact necessary to correct any statement in any earlier communication with
respect to the solicitation of any proxy for PLMT's Shareholders' Meeting.

respective businesses, operations, assets, liabilities, conditions (financial
or otherwise) or prospects, and Parent hereby disclaims any such other
representations or warranties. In particular, without limiting the foregoing
disclaimer, except for the representations and warranties made by Parent in

Parent or any of its Affiliates or Representatives in the course of their due
diligence investigation of Parent, the negotiation of this Agreement or in the

which they were made, not misleading. Any financial statements contained in
any other reports to another Regulatory Authority shall be prepared in
accordance with the Laws applicable to such reports.

ADDITIONAL AGREEMENTS

  


 

  

7.1 Shareholder Approvals.

  


 

  

(a) In accordance with and subject to applicable Law and its articles of
incorporation and bylaws, PLMT will submit this Agreement to its shareholders
for approval and will take all action necessary to call, give notice of,
convene, and hold PLMT's Shareholders' Meeting as promptly as practicable for
the purpose of considering and voting on approval of this Agreement.

  


 

  

(b) Neither PLMT's board of directors nor any committee thereof shall, except
as permitted by this Agreement: (x) withdraw, qualify or modify, or propose
publicly to withdraw, qualify or modify, in a manner adverse to Parent, the
PLMT Recommendation or (y) approve or recommend, or propose publicly to
approve or recommend, any Acquisition Proposal (each, an "Adverse
Recommendation Change"); provided that, notwithstanding the foregoing, prior
to the Requisite PLMT Shareholder Approval, PLMT's board of directors may make
an Adverse Recommendation Change (A) if a material development or material
change in circumstance occurs or arises after the date of this Agreement (such
material development or change in circumstances being referred to as an
"Intervening Event") and PLMT's board of directors determines in good faith,
after consultation with PLMT's outside counsel, that in light of such
Intervening Event an Adverse Recommendation Change is required in order for
PLMT's board of directors to comply with its fiduciary obligations to PLMT's
shareholders under applicable Law, or (B) if:

  

  

    

  |  

i)

  |  

PLMT's board of directors determines in good faith, after consultation with
PLMT's financial advisor and outside counsel, that it has received an
Acquisition Proposal (that did not result from a knowing and material breach
of Section 7.3) that is a Superior Proposal;

   
---|---|--- 
 

  

   

44 
--- 

 


--- 

   



    

  

    

  |  

ii)

  |  

PLMT's board of directors determines in good faith, after consultation with
PLMT's outside counsel, that a failure to accept such Superior Proposal would
result in PLMT's board of directors breaching its fiduciary duties to PLMT or
its shareholders under applicable Law;

   
---|---|--- 
 

  

  

    

  |  

iii)

  |  

PLMT's board of directors provides written notice (a "Notice of Recommendation
Change") to Parent of its receipt of the Superior Proposal and its intent to
announce an Adverse Recommendation Change on the third business day following
delivery of such notice, which notice shall specify the material terms and
conditions of the Superior Proposal (it being understood that any amendment to
any material term of such Superior Proposal shall require a new Notice of
Recommendation Change);

   
---|---|--- 
 

  

  

    

  |  

iv)

  |  

after providing such Notice of Recommendation Change, PLMT shall negotiate in
good faith with Parent (if requested by Parent) and provide Parent reasonable
opportunity during the subsequent three business day period to make such
adjustments in the terms and conditions of this Agreement as would enable
PLMT's board of directors to proceed without an Adverse Recommendation Change
(provided, however, that Parent shall not be required to propose any such
adjustments); and

   
---|---|--- 
 

  

  

    

  |  

v)

  |  

PLMT's board of directors, following such three business day period, again
determines in good faith, after consultation with PLMT Financial Advisor and
outside counsel, that such Acquisition Proposal nonetheless continues to
constitute a Superior Proposal and that failure to take such action would
violate their fiduciary duties to PLMT and its shareholders under applicable
Law.

   
---|---|--- 
 

  

  

7.2 Registration of Parent Common Stock.

  


 

  

(a) As promptly as reasonably practicable (and in any event, within fifty
days) following the date hereof, Parent shall prepare and file with the SEC a
Registration Statement on Form S-4 with respect to the issuance of Parent
Common Stock in the Merger (such Form S-4, and any amendments or supplements
thereto, the "Registration Statement"). The Registration Statement shall
contain proxy materials relating to the matters to be submitted to PLMT's
shareholders at PLMT's Shareholders' Meeting. Such proxy materials shall also
constitute the prospectus relating to the shares of Parent Common Stock to be
issued in the Merger (such proxy statement-prospectus, and any amendments or
supplements thereto, the "Proxy Statement/Prospectus"). PLMT will furnish to
Parent the information required to be included in the Registration Statement
with respect to its business and affairs and shall have the right to review
and consult with Parent on the form of, and any characterizations of such
information included in, the Registration Statement prior to its being filed
with the SEC. Parent shall use its reasonable best efforts to have the
Registration Statement declared effective by the SEC and to keep the
Registration Statement effective as long as is necessary to consummate the
Merger and the transactions contemplated hereby. Each of Parent and PLMT will
use their reasonable best efforts to cause the Proxy Statement/Prospectus to
be mailed to the PLMT shareholders as promptly as practicable after the
Registration Statement is declared effective under the Securities Act. Parent
will advise PLMT, promptly after it receives notice thereof, of the time when
the Registration Statement has become effective, the issuance of any stop
order, the suspension of the qualification of Parent Common Stock issuable in
connection with the Merger for offering or sale in any jurisdiction, or any
request by the SEC for amendment of the Proxy Statement/Prospectus or the
Registration Statement. If at any time prior to the Effective Time any
information relating to Parent or PLMT, or any of their respective affiliates,
officers or directors, should be discovered by Parent or PLMT which should be
set forth in an amendment or supplement to any of the Registration Statement
or the Proxy Statement/Prospectus so that any of such documents would not
include any misstatement of a material fact or omit to state any material fact
necessary to make the statements therein, in light of the circumstances under
which they were made, not misleading, the Party that discovers such
information shall promptly notify the other Party hereto and, to the extent
required by Law, rules or regulations, an appropriate amendment or supplement
describing such information shall be promptly filed by Parent with the SEC and
disseminated by the Parties to their respective shareholders.

  

   

45 
--- 

 


--- 

   



    


 

  

(b) Parent shall also take any action required to be taken under any
applicable state Securities Laws in connection with the Merger and each of
Parent and PLMT shall furnish all information concerning it and the holders of
PLMT Common Stock as may be reasonably requested in connection with any such
action.

  


 

  

(c) Prior to the Effective Time, Parent shall take such action as shall be
necessary to permit the additional shares of Parent Common Stock to be issued
by Parent in exchange for the shares of PLMT Common Stock to be traded on the
primary exchange on which Parent Common Stock is listed.

  


 

  

7.3 Other Offers, etc.

  


 

  

(a) From the date of this Agreement through the first to occur of the
Effective Time or termination of this Agreement, PLMT shall not, and shall
cause its Affiliates and Representatives not to, directly or indirectly (i)
solicit or initiate, or knowingly encourage, induce or facilitate, the making,
submission, or announcement of any proposal that constitutes an Acquisition
Proposal, or (ii) participate in any discussions (except to notify a third-
party of the existence of restrictions provided in this Section 7.3) or
negotiations regarding, or disclose or provide any nonpublic information with
respect to, or knowingly facilitate any inquiries or the making of any
proposal that constitutes an Acquisition Proposal, (iii) enter into any
agreement (including any agreement in principle, letter of intent or
understanding, merger agreement, stock purchase agreement, asset purchase
agreement, or share exchange agreement, but excluding a confidentiality
agreement of the type described below) relating to any Acquisition
Transaction, or (iv) propose or agree to do any of the foregoing; provided,
however, that prior to the Requisite PLMT Shareholder Approval, this Section
7.3 shall not prohibit a PLMT Entity from furnishing nonpublic information
regarding any PLMT Entity to, or entering into a confidentiality agreement or
discussions or negotiations with, any Person or Group in response to a bona
fide, unsolicited written Acquisition Proposal submitted by such Person or
Group if: (A) the Acquisition Proposal did not result from a breach of this
Section 7.3 by any PLMT Entity or Representative or Affiliate thereof (other
than any breach that is unintentional or immaterial), (B) PLMT's board of
directors shall have determined in good faith, after consultation with its
financial advisors and outside legal counsel, that such Acquisition Proposal
constitutes or is reasonably likely to result in a Superior Proposal, (C)
PLMT's board of directors concludes in good faith, after consultation with its
outside counsel, that the failure to take such action would be inconsistent
with its fiduciary duties under applicable Law to PLMT and its shareholders,
(D) (1) PLMT gives Parent prompt (but in no event alter than twenty-four (24)
hours) notice (which notice may be oral, and, if oral, shall be subsequently
confirmed in writing) (x) of PLMT's receipt of any Acquisition Proposal (which
notice shall include the identity of such Person or Group) and (y) of PLMT's
furnishing nonpublic information to, or entering into discussions or
negotiations with, such Person or Group, and (2) PLMT receives from such
Person or Group an executed confidentiality agreement containing terms no less
favorable to PLMT than the confidentiality terms of the mutual non-disclosure
agreement entered into by the Bank and Parent dated as of February 9, 2015,
and (E) contemporaneously with or promptly after furnishing any such nonpublic
information to such Person or Group, PLMT furnishes such nonpublic information
to Parent (to the extent such nonpublic information has not been previously
furnished by PLMT to Parent). In addition to the foregoing, PLMT shall keep
Parent reasonably informed on a prompt basis of the status and material terms
of any such Acquisition Proposal, including any material amendments or
proposed amendments as to price and other material terms thereof.

  

   

46 
--- 

 


--- 

   



    


 

  

(b) In addition to the obligations of PLMT set forth in this Section 7.3, as
promptly as reasonably practicable, after any of the directors of PLMT become
aware thereof, PLMT shall advise Parent of any request received by PLMT for
nonpublic information which PLMT believes is related to a potential
Acquisition Proposal, the material terms and conditions of such request or
Acquisition Proposal, and the identity of the Person or Group making any such
request or Acquisition Proposal. PLMT shall keep Parent informed promptly of
material amendments or modifications to any such request or Acquisition
Proposal.

  


 

  

(c) PLMT shall, and shall cause its Subsidiaries, directors, officers,
employees, and Representatives to immediately cease any and all existing
activities, discussions, or negotiations with any Persons conducted heretofore
with respect to any Acquisition Proposal (other than to advise them of the
existence of this Agreement) and will use and cause to be used all
commercially reasonable best efforts to enforce any confidentiality or similar
or related agreement relating to any Acquisition Proposal.

  


 

  

(d) Nothing contained in this Agreement shall prevent a Party or its board of
directors from complying with Rule 14d-9 and Rule 14e-2 under the Exchange Act
with respect to an Acquisition Proposal or with its fiduciary duties under
applicable Law.

  


 

  

7.4 Consents of Regulatory Authorities.

  


 

  

The Parties hereto shall cooperate with each other and use their reasonable
best efforts to promptly prepare and file all necessary documentation and
applications, to effect all applications, notices, petitions and filings, and
to obtain as promptly as practicable all Consents of all Regulatory
Authorities and other Persons which are necessary or advisable to consummate
the transactions contemplated by this Agreement (including the Merger). The
Parties agree that they will consult with each other with respect to the
obtaining of all Consents of all Regulatory Authorities and other Persons
necessary or advisable to consummate the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement and each Party will keep the other apprised of the status of matters
relating to consummation of the transactions contemplated herein. Each Party
also shall promptly advise the other upon receiving any communication from any
Regulatory Authority or other Person whose Consent is required for
consummation of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement which causes
such Party to believe that there is a reasonable likelihood that any requisite
Consent will not be obtained or that the receipt of any such Consent will be
materially delayed.

  


 

  

7.5 Agreement as to Efforts to Consummate.

  


 

  

Subject to the terms and conditions of this Agreement, each Party agrees to
use, and to cause its Subsidiaries to use, its reasonable best efforts to
take, or cause to be taken, all actions, and to do, or cause to be done, all
things necessary, proper, or advisable under applicable Laws to consummate and
make effective, as soon as reasonably practicable after the date of this
Agreement, the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, including using
its reasonable best efforts to lift or rescind any Order adversely affecting
its ability to consummate the transactions contemplated herein and to cause to
be satisfied the conditions referred to in Article 8; provided, that nothing
herein shall preclude either Party from exercising its Rights under this
Agreement.

  

   

47

7.6 Investigation and Confidentiality.

  


 

  

(a) Prior to the Effective Time, each Party shall keep the other Party advised
of all material developments relevant to its business and the consummation of
the Merger and shall permit the other Party to make or cause to be made such
investigation of its business and properties (including that of its
Subsidiaries) and of their respective financial and legal conditions as the
other Party reasonably requests; provided, that such investigation shall be
reasonably related to the transactions contemplated hereby and shall not
interfere unnecessarily with normal operations. No investigation by a Party
shall affect the ability of such Party to rely on the representations and
warranties of the other Party.

  


 

  

(b) Each Party shall, and shall cause its advisors and agents to, maintain the
confidentiality of all confidential information furnished to it by the other
Party concerning its and its Subsidiaries' businesses, operations, and
financial positions and shall not use such information for any purpose except
in furtherance of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement. If this
Agreement is terminated prior to the Effective Time, each Party shall promptly
return or certify the destruction of all documents and copies thereof, and all
work papers containing confidential information received from the other Party.

  


 

  

(c) PLMT shall use its commercially reasonable efforts to exercise, and shall
not waive any of, its Rights under confidentiality agreements entered into
with Persons which were considering an Acquisition Proposal with respect to
PLMT to preserve the confidentiality of the information relating to PLMT
Entities provided to such Persons and their Affiliates and Representatives.

  


 

  

(d) Each Party agrees to give the other Party notice as soon as practicable
after any determination by it of any fact or occurrence relating to the other
Party which it has discovered through the course of its investigation and
which represents, or is reasonably likely to represent, either a material
breach of any representation, warranty, covenant, or agreement of the other
Party or which has had or is reasonably likely to have a PLMT Material Adverse
Effect or a Parent Material Adverse Effect, as applicable.

  


 

  

7.7 Press Releases.

  


 

  

Prior to the Effective Time, PLMT and Parent shall consult with each other and
agree as to the form and substance of any press release, communication with
shareholders of PLMT or shareholders of Parent, or other public disclosure
materially related to this Agreement, or any other transaction contemplated
hereby; provided, that nothing in this Section 7.7 shall be deemed to prohibit
any Party from making any disclosure which its counsel deems necessary or
advisable in order to satisfy such Party's disclosure obligations imposed by
Law.

  


 

  

7.8 Employee Benefits and Contracts.

  


 

  

(a) All persons who are employees of PLMT Entities immediately prior to the
Effective Time and whose employment is not specifically terminated, if any, at
or prior to the Effective Time (a "Continuing Employee") shall, at the
Effective Time or the time of the Bank Merger, as applicable, become employees
of Parent or Parent Banksub, as applicable. Parent and Parent Banksub shall
honor all PLMT employment and change of control agreements existing as of the
date of this Agreement that have been disclosed to Parent. All of the other
Continuing Employees shall be employed at will, and no contractual right with
respect to employment shall inure to such employees because of this Agreement,
except as otherwise contemplated by this Agreement.

  


 

  

(b) As of the Effective Time, each Continuing Employee shall be eligible to
participate in Parent's 401(k) and other retirement plans with full credit for
prior service with PLMT for purposes of eligibility and vesting (but not
benefit accruals).

  

   

48 
--- 

 


--- 

   



    


 

  

(c) Except as provided in the last sentence of this Section 7.8(e), as of the
Effective Time, Parent shall make available employer-provided health and other
employee welfare benefit plans to each Continuing Employee on substantially
the same basis as it provides such coverage to similarly-situated Parent
employees except that any pre-existing condition, eligibility waiting period,
or other limitations or exclusions otherwise applicable under such plans to
new employees shall not apply to a Continuing Employee or their covered
dependents if they did not apply under a similar PLMT plan at the Effective
Time of the Merger. In addition, if any such transition occurs during a plan
year, Parent shall use commercially reasonable efforts to cause any such
successor Parent Employee Benefit Plan providing health coverage to give
credit towards satisfaction of any annual deductible limitation and out-of-
pocket maximum applied under such successor plan for any deductible, co-
payment and other cost-sharing amounts previously paid by a Continuing
Employee respecting his or her participation in the corresponding PLMT Benefit
Plan during that plan year prior to the transition effective date.
Notwithstanding the foregoing, and in lieu of same, Parent may continue PLMT's
health and other employee welfare benefit plans for each Continuing Employee
as in effect immediately prior to the Effective Time.

  


 

  

(d) With respect to employee benefit plans of Parent and its Subsidiaries not
addressed in Sections (c) or (d) above, Parent and its Subsidiaries shall
Parent shall make such plans available to each Continuing Employee on
substantially the same basis as it provides such coverage to similarly-
situated Parent employees and shall take into account for purposes of
eligibility and vesting (but not benefit accrual) (except that there shall not
be any benefit accrual for past service under any qualified defined benefit
pension plan), the service of such employees with PLMT and its Subsidiaries as
if such service were with Parent and its Subsidiaries. Continuing Employees
will retain credit for unused sick leave and vacation pay for unused vacation
days for the current year only without carryover of vacation days for prior
years, which has been accrued as of the Effective Time. For purposes of
determining the accrual of Continuing Employees to sick leave and vacation pay
following the Effective Time, the service of such employees with PLMT shall be
treated as if such service were with Parent and its Subsidiaries.

  


 

  

(e) Continuing Employees, and any employees of PLMT or its Subsidiaries who
are (i) terminated involuntarily other than for cause at the Effective Time,
or who do not have employment or change of control or agreements that include
severance payments or severance agreements as of the date of their termination
and who are terminated involuntarily other than for cause within one year
after the Effective Time, and (ii) who sign and deliver a termination and
release agreement in a customary and reasonable form that is reasonably
acceptable to Parent, shall be entitled to severance pay equal to two (2)
weeks of severance pay (at the greater of their rate of base pay in effect at
the time of termination and their base pay rate in effect at the Effective
Time) for each full year of continuous service with PLMT Entities or Parent
Entities, subject to a minimum of eight (8) weeks and a maximum of fifty-two
(52) weeks of pay; provided that employees with fifteen (15) years of tenure
will receive fifty-two (52) weeks of severance pay; and provided further that
and any such terminated employees shall be entitled to continuation coverage
as required by COBRA and Parent or Parent Banksub shall reimburse for COBRA
coverage for four months for employees with less than fifteen (15) years of
tenure and six months for employees with fifteen (15) or more years of tenure
(service with PLMT or its Subsidiaries prior to the Effective Time will be
treated as service to Parent or Parent Banksub for purposes of determining any
severance due under this 7.8(e)). Nothing in this Section 7.8(e) shall be
deemed to limit or modify the at-will employment policy of PLMT or Parent or
their respective Subsidiaries.

  


 

  

(f) No officer, employee, or other Person (other than the corporate Parties to
this Agreement) shall be deemed a third-party or other beneficiary of this
Section 7.8, and no such Person shall have any right or other entitlement to
enforce any provision of this Agreement or seek any remedy in connection with
this Agreement, except as set forth in Section 7.10.

  

   

49

--- 

   



    


 

  

7.9 Section 16 Matters.

  


 

  

Prior to the Effective Time, PLMT and Parent shall take all such steps as may
be required to cause any dispositions of PLMT Common Stock (including
derivative securities with respect to PLMT Common Stock) or acquisitions of
Parent Common Stock resulting from the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement by each individual who is subject to the reporting requirements of
Section 16(a) of the Exchange Act with respect to PLMT to be exempt under Rule
16b-3 promulgated under the Exchange Act. PLMT agrees to promptly furnish
Parent with all requisite information necessary for Parent to take the actions
contemplated by this Section 7.9.

  


 

  

7.10 Indemnification.

  


 

  

(a) For a period of six years after the Effective Time (or, in the case of
Claims that have not been resolved prior to the sixth anniversary of the
Effective Time, until such Claims are finally resolved), Parent shall
indemnify, defend, and hold harmless the present and former directors and
executive officers of PLMT Entities (each, an "Indemnified Party") against all
Liabilities arising out of, resulting from or related to any claim, action,
suit, proceeding, investigation or other legal proceeding, whether civil,
criminal, administrative or investigative or investigation (each, a "Claim"),
in which a PLMT Indemnified Party is, or is threatened to be made, a party or
witness arising out of the fact that such Person is or was a director or
officer of PLMT (or, at PLMT's request, as a director, officer, manager or
trustee of, or in a similar capacity with, another PLMT Entity or PLMT
Employee Benefit Plan, prior to the Effective Time) if such Claim pertains to
any matter of fact arising, existing or occurring at or before the Effective
Time (including the Merger and the other transactions contemplated hereby),
regardless of whether such Claim is asserted or claimed before, or after, the
Effective Time, to the fullest extent permitted by applicable Law. Parent
shall promptly pay reasonable expenses (including reasonable attorneys' fees)
in advance of the final disposition of any such Claim to each Indemnified
Party to the fullest extent permitted by applicable Law upon receipt of an
undertaking to repay such advance payments if he or she shall be adjudicated
to be not entitled to indemnification under this Section 7.10(a). Parent shall
not have any obligation hereunder to any Indemnified Party when and if a court
of competent jurisdiction shall determine, and such determination shall have
become final and non-appealable, that the indemnification of such Indemnified
Party in the manner contemplated hereby is prohibited by applicable Law
(including any Law promulgated, interpreted or enforced by any Regulatory
Authority).

  


 

  

(b) Prior to the Effective Time, Parent shall purchase, or shall direct PLMT
to purchase, an extended reporting period endorsement under PLMT Entities'
existing directors' and officers' liability insurance coverage ("PLMT DandO
Policy") for acts or omissions occurring prior to the Effective Time by such
directors and officers currently covered by PLMT Entities' DandO Policy which
shall maintain such PLMT DandO Policy in effect for a period of six (6) years
after the Effective Time; provided that Parent shall not be obligated to make
aggregate annual premium payments for such six (6)-year period in respect of
such policy which exceed 300% of the annual premium payments on PLMT's current
policy in effect as of the date of this Agreement (the "Maximum Amount"). If
the amount of the premiums necessary to maintain or procure such insurance
coverage exceeds the Maximum Amount, Parent shall use its reasonable best
efforts to maintain the most advantageous policies of directors' and officers'
liability insurance obtainable for a premium equal to the Maximum Amount. The
directors and officers of PLMT Entities shall take all reasonable actions
required by the insurance carrier necessary to procure such endorsement.

  

   

50 
--- 

 


--- 

   



    


 

  

(c) Any Indemnified Party wishing to claim indemnification under paragraph (a)
of this Section 7.10, upon learning of any such Liability, damages, or
Litigation, shall promptly notify Parent thereof in writing (provided that a
failure to timely provide such notice shall not relieve the Parent of any
indemnification obligation unless, and to the extent that, the Parent is
materially prejudiced by such failure). In the event of any such Litigation
(whether arising before or after the Effective Time), (i) Parent shall have
the right to assume the defense thereof and Parent shall not be liable to such
Indemnified Parties for any legal expenses of other counsel or any other
expenses subsequently incurred by such Indemnified Parties in connection with
the defense thereof, except that if Parent elects not to assume such defense
or counsel for the Indemnified Parties and there are substantive issues which
raise conflicts of interest between Parent and the Indemnified Parties, the
Indemnified Parties may retain counsel satisfactory to them, and Parent shall
pay all reasonable fees and expenses of such counsel for the Indemnified
Parties promptly as statements therefor are received; provided, that Parent
shall be obligated pursuant to this paragraph (c) to pay for only one firm of
counsel for any Indemnified Party in any jurisdiction; (ii) each Indemnified
Party will cooperate in good faith in the defense of any such Litigation;
(iii) Parent shall not be liable for any settlement effected without its prior
written Consent (which shall not be unreasonably withheld or delayed) and (iv)
without the prior written Consent of the Indemnified Party (which shall not be
unreasonably withheld or delayed) Parent shall not agree to any settlement
which does not provide for a complete and irrevocable release of the
Indemnified Party.

  


 

  

(d) Parent covenants and agrees that neither it, nor any successors or
assigns, shall consolidate with or merge into any other Person where Parent or
any such successor or assign shall not be the continuing or surviving Person
of such consolidation or merger or transfer all or substantially all of its
assets to any Person, unless, in each case, proper provision shall have been
made to ensure that the successors and assigns of Parent shall assume the
obligations set forth in this Section 7.10.

  


 

  

(e) The provisions of this Section 7.10 are intended to be for the benefit of
and shall be enforceable by, each Indemnified Party and their respective heirs
and legal and personal representatives.

  


 

  

7.11 Retention Plan and Conversion Bonus Plan.

  


 

  

(a) PLMT may implement a retention plan (the "Retention Plan") for the benefit
of those non-director employees of PLMT and its Subsidiaries (i) with respect
to non-executive officers, as determined by the chief executive officer of
PLMT or (ii) with respect to non-director executive officers, as determined by
the Compensation Committee of the board of directors of PLMT (which may
consider the proposals of the chief executive officer of PLMT in making such
determinations), and in each case as agreed to by Parent (which agreement will
not be unreasonably withheld or delayed), which Retention Plan shall involve
aggregate benefits to such non-director employees of up to $250,000 (or such
greater amount as Parent and PLMT may agree), which shall be payable to such
employees of PLMT Entities that remain employees until the Closing Date.

  


 

  

(b) To facilitate the successful integration of PLMT into Parent and the
conversion of the systems of PLMT to Parent, Parent shall establish a stay
bonus/conversion bonus pool in the aggregate amount up to $250,000 (or such
greater amount as Parent shall determine) to be allocated and paid to non-
director employees of PLMT who continue in the employ of Parent at the
expiration of ninety(90) days after the Effective Time. The specific amount to
be allocated and paid to each such non-director employee who continues in the
employ of Parent shall be determined by Parent prior to the Effective time,
after consultation with the chief executive officer of PLMT.

Notwithstanding any other provision of this Agreement, and notwithstanding the
approval of this Agreement by the shareholders of PLMT, this Agreement may be
terminated and the Merger abandoned at any time prior to the Effective Time:

  


 

  

(a) By mutual written agreement of Parent and PLMT; or

  

   

54 
--- 

 


--- 

   



    


 

  

(b) By either Party (provided, that the terminating Party is not then in
material breach of any representation, warranty, covenant, or other agreement
contained in this Agreement) in the event of a breach by the other Party of
any representation or warranty contained in this Agreement which cannot be or
has not been cured within 30 days after the giving of written notice to the
breaching Party of such breach and which breach is reasonably likely, in the
opinion of the non-breaching Party, to permit such Party to refuse to
consummate the transactions contemplated by this Agreement pursuant to the
standard set forth in Section 8.2(a) or (b), or 8.3(a) or (b), as applicable;
or

  


 

  

(c) By either Party in the event (i) any Requisite Regulatory Approvals shall
have been denied by final, non-appealable action of such authority, (ii) any
Law or Order permanently restraining, enjoining or otherwise prohibiting the
consummation of the Merger shall have become final and non-appealable, or
(iii) the Requisite PLMT Shareholder Approval is not obtained at PLMT's
Shareholders' Meeting where such matters were presented to such shareholders
for approval and voted upon; or

  


 

  

(d) By either Party in the event that the Merger shall not have been
consummated by December 31, 2015 (the "End Date"), or, if all of the
conditions of Article 8 other than Section 8.1(b) shall have been satisfied,
or are capable of being satisfied, by such date, February 29, 2016 (the
"Extended End Date"); provided, however, that the right to terminate this
Agreement under this Section 9.1(d) shall not be available to any Party whose
failure to fulfill any obligation under this Agreement has been the cause of
or resulted in the failure of the Merger to occur on or before the End Date or
Extended End Date, as applicable; or

  


 

  

(e) By Parent (provided, that Parent is not then in material breach of any
representation, warranty, covenant, or other agreement contained in this
Agreement) in the event that (i) upon the effectiveness of the Registration
Statement, the PLMT board of directors shall not have recommended approval of
this Agreement to its shareholders; or (ii) at any time prior to receipt of
the Requisite PLMT Shareholder Approval, the PLMT board of directors shall
have made an Adverse Recommendation Change; or

  


 

  

(f) By PLMT, prior to the Requisite PLMT Shareholder Approval (and provided
that PLMT has complied in all material respects with Section 7.1 and Section
7.3), in order to enter into a Superior Proposal.

  


 

  

(g) (X) By PLMT, at any time during the four business day period following the
Determination Date, if both of the following conditions are satisfied:

  


 

  

(i)   the Average Parent Stock Price shall be less than $15.72; and

  


 

  

(ii) (1) the quotient of the Average Parent Stock Price divided by the
Starting Price (such quotient being the "Parent Ratio"), shall be less than
85% of (2) the quotient of the Average Index Price divided by the Index Price
on the Starting Date (which quotient shall be the "Index Ratio"). 
 

  

Example 1: if Parent Ratio = 0.80 and the Index Ratio = 0.90, then 85% of the
Index Ratio would be 0.85 x 0.90, or 76.5%. Condition (g)(i) would be
satisfied, but condition (g)(ii) would not be satisfied.

  

   

55 
--- 

 


--- 

   



    


 

  

Example 2: if Parent Ratio = 0.70 and the Index Ratio = 0.84, then 85% of the
Index Ratio would be 0.85 x 0.84, or 71.4%. Both conditions (g)(i) and (g)(ii)
would be satisfied.

  


 

  

provided, however, that if PLMT refuses to consummate the Merger pursuant to
this Section 9.1(g)(X), it shall give prompt written notice thereof to Parent
(and provided that such PLMT notice of election to terminate may be withdrawn
at any time within the aforementioned four business day period). During the
five-day period commencing with its receipt of such notice, Parent shall have
the option to increase the consideration to be received by the holders of PLMT
Common Stock hereunder, by either:

  


 

  

 

(A) increasing the Exchange Ratio (calculated to the nearest one one-
thousandth); or

 

  


 

  

(B) provided that it does not and will not prevent or impede the Merger from
qualifying as a "reorganization" within the meaning of Section 368(a) of the
Code, paying, as part of the Merger Consideration, to each recipient of Stock
Consideration a cash payment (in addition to, and not in lieu of, issuing
shares of Parent Common Stock to them) (the "Additional Cash Payment Per
Share");

  


 

  

so that the value of the Per Share Purchase Price (calculated based on the
Average Parent Stock Price and including any Additional Cash Payment Per
Share) to be received by each recipient of Stock Consideration equals the
lesser of:

  


 

  

(x) the product of the Starting Price, 0.85 and the Exchange Ratio (as in
effect immediately prior to any increase in the Exchange Ratio pursuant to
this Section 9.1(g)( X)); and

  


 

  

(y) an amount equal to (1) the product of the Index Ratio, 0.85, the Exchange
Ratio (as in effect immediately prior to any increase in the Exchange Ratio
pursuant to this Section 9.1(g)(X)), and the Average Parent Stock Price,
divided by (2) the Parent Ratio.

  


 

  

If Parent so elects within such five-day period, it shall give prompt written
notice to PLMT of such election and the revised Exchange Ratio or the
Additional Cash Payment Per Share, as applicable, whereupon no termination
shall have occurred pursuant to this Section 9.01(g) and this Agreement shall
remain in effect in accordance with its terms, provided that any references in
this Agreement to the "Exchange Ratio" shall thereafter be deemed to refer to
the Exchange Ratio as increased pursuant to this section, if applicable, and
any references in this Agreement to the Stock Consideration shall thereafter
include the Additional Cash Payment Per Share as set forth in this section, if
applicable.

  


 

  

(Y) For purposes of Section 9.1(g), the following terms shall have the
meanings indicated:

  


 

  

"Average Parent Stock Price" shall mean the average of the closing sale prices
of Parent Common Stock as reported on the Nasdaq Global Select Market during
the 20 consecutive full trading days ending at the closing of trading on the
trading day immediately prior to the Determination Date; provided, however,
that in the event Parent Common Stock does not trade on any one or more of the
trading days during the 20 consecutive full trading days ending at the closing
of trading on the trading day immediately prior to the Determination Date, any
such date shall be disregarded in computing the average closing sales price
and the average shall be based upon the closing sales prices and number of
days on which Parent Common Stock actually traded during the 20 consecutive
full trading days ending at the closing of trading on the trading day
immediately prior to the Determination Date.

  

   

56 
---

recapitalization, split up, combination, exchange of shares, similar
transaction between the date of this Agreement and the Determination Date, the
prices for Parent Common Stock shall be appropriately adjusted for the
purposes of applying this Section 9.1(g).

  


 

  

9.2 Effect of Termination.

  


 

  

In the event of the termination and abandonment of this Agreement by either
Parent or PLMT pursuant to Section 9.1, this Agreement shall have no further
effect, except that (i) the provisions of Sections 7.6(b) (Confidentiality),
9.2 (Effect of Termination), 9.3 (Termination Fee), and Article 10
(Miscellaneous) shall survive any such termination and abandonment, and (ii)
no such termination shall relieve the breaching Party from Liability resulting
from any willful and material breach by that Party of this Agreement.

  


 

  

9.3 Termination Fee.

  


 

  

(a) If PLMT terminates this Agreement pursuant to Section 9.1(f) of this
Agreement, then PLMT shall pay to Parent the sum of $7.5 million (the
"Termination Fee") by wire transfer of immediately available funds within five
(5) business days of such termination.

  


 

  

(b) If (i) after the date of this Agreement, an Acquisition Proposal with
respect to PLMT shall have been communicated to or otherwise made known to the
shareholders or board of directors of PLMT, or any Person shall have publicly
announced an intention to make an Acquisition Proposal with respect to the
PLMT, and such Acquisition Proposal shall not have been withdrawn, (ii) Parent
terminates this Agreement pursuant to Section 9.1(e) of this Agreement, or
either Party terminates this Agreement pursuant to Section 9.1(c)(ii) of this
Agreement, and (iii) within 12 months of such termination an Acquisition
Transaction is consummated, then PLMT shall pay to Parent the Termination Fee
by wire transfer of immediately available funds within five (5) business days
of the consummation of such Acquisition Transaction.

  


 

  

(c) The Parties acknowledge that the agreements contained in this Article 9
are an integral part of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, and
that without these agreements, they would not enter into this Agreement;
accordingly, if PLMT fails to pay promptly any fee payable by it pursuant to
this Section 9.3, then PLMT shall pay to Parent its reasonable costs and
expenses (including reasonable attorneys' fees) in connection with collecting
such Termination Fee, together with interest on the amount of the fee at the
prime annual rate of interest (as published in The Wall Street Journal) plus
2% as the same is in effect from time to time from the date such payment was

authorized officer of Parent.

  


 

  

(b) Prior to or at the Effective Time, PLMT, acting through its chief
executive officer, or other authorized officer, shall have the right to waive
any Default in the performance of any term of this Agreement by Parent, to
waive or extend the time for the compliance or fulfillment by Parent of any
and all of its obligations under this Agreement, and to waive any or all of
the conditions precedent to the obligations of PLMT under this Agreement,
except any condition which, if not satisfied, would result in the violation of
any Law. No such waiver shall be effective unless in writing signed by a duly
authorized officer of PLMT.

  


 

  

(c) The failure of any Party at any time or times to require performance of
any provision hereof shall in no manner affect the right of such Party at a
later time to enforce the same or any other provision of this Agreement. No
waiver of any condition or of the breach of any term contained in this
Agreement in one or more instances shall be deemed to be or construed as a
further or continuing waiver of such condition or breach or a waiver of any
other condition or of the breach of any other term of this Agreement.

the preceding sentence, this Agreement will be binding upon, inure to the
