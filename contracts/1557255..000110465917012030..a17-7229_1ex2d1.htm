the terms of Section 15.1B of the Company LP Agreement if the Company had
issued and delivered Company Common Stock in exchange for such Company OP
Common Unit immediately prior to the Partnership Merger Effective Time (as if
such Company OP Common Unit were a "Tendered Unit" pursuant to the Company LP
Agreement and the Company GP had elected to cause the Company to acquire such
Company OP Common Unit pursuant to Section 15.1B of the Company LP Agreement),
_multiplied by_ (ii) the Merger Consideration (such total, the " **Company OP
Unit Consideration** ") and each holder of a certificate (a " **Company OP

Merger and without any further action on the part of any Parent Party, Company
Party or the holders of Company OP Common Units, each Company OP Common Unit
issued and outstanding immediately prior to the Partnership Merger Effective
Time and held by either Company GP or Company shall remain outstanding
(entitling Company (and following the Parent Merger, the Surviving Company),
Parent or an Affiliate of Parent to such rights, duties and obligations as

Merger and without any further action on the part of any Parent Party or
Company Party, each unit of Parent LP issued and outstanding immediately prior
to the Partnership Merger Effective

 



      
 

 



 

Time shall automatically be retired and shall cease to exist and no payment
shall be made with respect thereto.

 



 

Section 3.3 _Adjustments_. Without limiting the other provisions of this
Agreement and subject to _Section 6.1(b)(ii)_ and _Section 6.1(b)(iii)_, if
at any time during the period between the date of this Agreement and the
Parent Merger Effective Time, Company should split, combine or otherwise
reclassify the shares of Company Common Stock, or make a dividend or other
distribution in shares of Company Common Stock (including any dividend or
other distribution of securities convertible into shares of Company Common
Stock), or engage in a reclassification, reorganization, recapitalization or
exchange or other like change, then (without limiting any other rights of the
other Parties hereunder), the Merger Consideration and Preferred Merger
Consideration shall be equitably adjusted to reflect fully the effect of any
such change.

 



 

Section 3.4 _Company Restricted Stock and Company PSUs_.

 



 

(a) Parent will not assume any Company Restricted Stock Awards. At the Parent
Merger Effective Time, by virtue of the Parent Merger and without any further
action on the part of any Company Party, Parent Party or any holder of Company
Restricted Stock Awards, any and all outstanding issuance and forfeiture
conditions, or other restrictions, on any shares of Company Common Stock
subject to Company Restricted Stock Awards shall be deemed satisfied in full,
contingent upon the closing of the Parent Merger, as stated in the Company
Equity Incentive Plans, and such shares of Company Common Stock shall be
treated as an outstanding share of Company Common Stock and entitled to
receive the Merger Consideration pursuant to _Section 3.1(b)_.

 



 

(b) Parent will not assume any Company PSUs. At the Parent Merger Effective
Time, by virtue of the Parent Merger and without any further action on the
part of any Company Party, Parent Party or any holder of Company PSUs, each
Company PSU that is outstanding as of immediately prior to the Parent Merger
Effective Time shall vest in accordance with the terms thereof, including all
DER Stock Units subject to the same vesting provisions as the Company PSU, and
be cancelled and converted into, and will become a right to receive an amount
in cash, without interest subject to any applicable withholding Tax, equal to
the product obtained by multiplying (i) the number of shares of Company Common
Stock subject to such Company PSU as of immediately prior to the Parent Merger
Effective Time, after taking into account the vesting in connection with the
Parent Merger, by (ii) the Merger Consideration. For purposes of the
immediately preceding sentence, (a) to the extent the performance period
relating to any such Company PSU has not expired as of the Parent Merger
Effective Time and the grant date of the Company PSU occurred less than
eighteen (18) months prior to the Parent Merger Effective Time, the number of
shares of Company Common Stock in clause (i) shall be determined as if the
applicable "total stockholder return" applicable to such Company PSU was
achieved at the target level of performance; (b) to the extent the performance
period relating to any such Company PSU has not expired as of the Parent
Merger Effective Time and the grant date of the Company PSU occurred eighteen
(18) months or more prior to the Parent Merger Effective Time, the number of
shares of Company Common Stock in clause (i) shall be determined as if the
applicable "total stockholder return" applicable to such Company PSU was
achieved at the maximum level of performance; and (c) to the extent the
performance period

 



      
 

 



 

relating to any such Company PSU has expired as of the Parent Merger Effective
Time, the number of shares of Company Common Stock in clause (i) shall be
determined based on the actual achievement of all applicable "total
stockholder return" targets applicable to such Company PSU through the Parent
Merger Effective Time. Each such Company PSU that vests pursuant to this
_Section 3.4(b)_ shall, as of immediately prior to the Parent Merger
Effective Time, no longer be subject to any issuance and forfeiture
conditions, or other restrictions, and such holders shall be entitled to
receive the Merger Consideration pursuant to _Section 3.1(b)_.

 



 

(c) As soon as reasonably practicable after the Closing (but no later than the
second payroll date after the Closing Date), the applicable holders of Company
Restricted Stock Awards and Company PSUs will receive a payment from Parent
(as the Surviving Company in the Parent Merger), through its payroll system or
payroll provider, of all amounts required to be paid to such holders in
respect of Company Restricted Stock Awards and Company PSUs that are cancelled
and converted pursuant to _Section 3.4(a)_ or _Section 3.4(b)_, as
applicable. Notwithstanding the foregoing, if any payment owed to a holder of
Company Restricted Stock Awards and Company PSUs pursuant to _Section 3.4(a)_
or _Section 3.4(b)_, as applicable, cannot be made through Parents payroll
system or payroll provider, then Parent will issue a check for such payment to
such holder, which check will be sent by overnight courier to such holder
promptly following the Closing Date (but in no event more than five (5)
Business Days thereafter).

 



 

(d) Prior to the Parent Merger Effective Time, Company shall take such actions
as are necessary to provide for the treatment of the Company Restricted Stock
Awards and Company PSUs as contemplated by this _Section 3.4_, subject in all
cases to the requirements of applicable Law.

 



 

Section 3.5 _Exchange of Certificates_.

 



 

(a) The Parent Parties shall appoint a bank or trust company reasonably
satisfactory to Company to act as paying agent (the " **Paying Agent** ") for
the payment and delivery of the Merger Consideration, the Preferred Merger
Consideration and the Company OP Unit Consideration, as provided in _Section
3.1(b)_ and _Section 3.1(c)_ and _Section 3.2(a)_. The paying agent
agreement pursuant to which the Parent Parties shall appoint the Paying Agent
(the " **Paying Agent Agreement** ") will be in a form and substance
reasonably satisfactory to Company. At or before the Parent Merger Effective
Time, the Parent Parties shall deposit, or cause to be deposited, with the
Paying Agent cash in immediately available funds in an amount sufficient to
pay the aggregate Merger Consideration, Preferred Merger Consideration and
Company OP Unit Consideration in accordance with _Section 3.1(b)_, _Section
3.1(c)_ and _Section 3.2(a)_ (the " **Payment Fund** "), in each case, for
the sole benefit of the holders of shares of Company Common Stock, shares of
Company Preferred Stock and Company OP Common Units, as applicable. The Parent
Parties shall cause the Paying Agent to make, and the Paying Agent shall make,
delivery of the Merger Consideration, Preferred Merger Consideration and the
Company OP Unit Consideration out of the Payment Fund in accordance with this
Agreement. The Payment Fund shall not be used for any purpose other than to
fund payments due pursuant to this _Article III_.

 



      
 

 



 

(b) The Payment Fund shall be invested by the Paying Agent in accordance with
the Paying Agent Agreement. Interest and other income on the Payment Fund
shall be the sole and exclusive property of the Parent Parties. No investment
of the Payment Fund shall relieve the Parent Parties or the Paying Agent from
making the payments required by this _Article III_, and, following any losses
from any such investment, the Parent Parties shall promptly provide additional
funds to the Paying Agent to the extent necessary to satisfy the Parent
Parties obligations hereunder for the benefit of the holders of shares of
Company Common Stock, Company Preferred Stock and holders of Company OP Common
Units at the Parent Merger Effective Time, which additional funds will be
deemed to be part of the Payment Fund.

 



 

(c) _Exchange Procedures_.

 



 

(i) As promptly as practicable following the Parent Merger Effective Time (but
in no event later than five (5) Business Days thereafter), the Parent Parties
shall cause the Paying Agent to mail (and to make available for collection by
hand) to each holder of record of a Certificate or Book-Entry Share, or of a
Preferred Certificate or Preferred Book-Entry Share, or a Company OP Unit
Certificate or Uncertificated Unit, as applicable, (A) a letter of transmittal
(a " **Letter of Transmittal** ") which shall specify that delivery shall be
effected, and risk of loss and title to the Certificates or Book-Entry Shares,
the Preferred Certificates or Preferred Book-Entry Shares or the Company OP
Unit Certificates or Uncertificated Units, as applicable, shall pass only upon
proper delivery of the Certificates, the Preferred Certificates or the Company
OP Unit Certificates (or affidavits of loss in lieu thereof) or transfer of
the Book-Entry Shares, the Preferred Book-Entry Shares or the Uncertificated
Units (as evidenced by, as applicable, receipt by the Paying Agent of an
"agents message" in customary form or other evidence as the Paying Agent may
reasonably request), as applicable, to the Paying Agent, which Letter of
Transmittal shall be in such form and have such other customary provisions as
the Parent Parties and Company may reasonably mutually agree upon, and (B)
instructions for use in effecting the surrender of the Certificates, the

be filed, taking into account any extensions of time within which to file such
Tax Returns, and all such Tax Returns were complete and correct in all
material respects. Company and each Company Subsidiary has duly paid (or there
has been paid on their behalf), or made adequate provisions on the financial
statements of Company in accordance with GAAP for, all material

 



      
 

 



 

amounts of Taxes required to be paid by them, whether or not shown on any Tax
return. Company has made available to Parent complete and correct copies of
(i) all U.S. federal, state and local income and other material Tax Returns of
Company and the Company Subsidiaries relating to the last three years which

years relating to any Taxes due from or with respect to Company or any Company
Subsidiaries. Neither Company nor any Company Subsidiaries has received a
written claim, or to the Knowledge of Company, an unwritten claim, by any
authority in a jurisdiction where any of them does not file Tax Returns that
it is or may be subject to taxation by that jurisdiction.

 



 

(b) Company (i) for all taxable years commencing with the taxable year ending
December 31, 2012 and through December 31, 2016, has been subject to taxation

REIT, and to the Knowledge of Company, no such challenge is pending or

Subsidiary** ") or a "taxable REIT subsidiary" within the meaning of Section
856(l) of the Code (" **Taxable REIT Subsidiary** "). _Section 4.11(b)_ of

Taxable REIT Subsidiary owned directly or indirectly by Company, and each
Company Subsidiary not set forth in _Section 4.11(b)_ of the Disclosure
Letter is and has been since its formation classified as a partnership or
entity disregarded as separate from Company or a Company Subsidiary for U.S.
federal income tax purposes. Each Company Subsidiary that is a partnership,
joint venture or limited liability company and has not elected to be a Taxable
REIT Subsidiary has been since its formation treated for U.S. federal income
tax purposes as a partnership or disregarded entity, as the case may be, and
not as a corporation or an association taxable as a corporation. Taking into
account all distributions to be made by Company prior to the Parent Merger
Effective Time and the deemed distributions by Company by reason of the deemed
sale of assets and liquidation for U.S federal income tax purposes resulting
from the Parent Merger, Company will have distributed cash to its Stockholders
in its taxable year ending with the Parent Merger in an amount equal to or in
excess of the amount required to be distributed pursuant to Section 857(a) of
the Code in respect of its taxable year ending with the Parent Merger, and
Company will not be subject to Tax under Sections 857(b) or 4981 of the Code
in respect of its taxable year ending with the Parent Merger (other than as
set forth in _Schedule 4.11(p)_ of the Disclosure Letter).

proposed or assessed in writing or, to the Knowledge of Company, threatened,
by any Governmental Authority, which deficiency has not yet been settled,

limitations with

respect to any Tax assessment or deficiency for any open tax year or is the
beneficiary of an extension of time to file any Tax Return except for any such
waivers or extensions relating to an extension of time to file any non-income
Tax Return in respect of a taxable year or period ending in 2016 or 2017; and

857(b)(7), 860(c) or 4981 of the Code which have not been previously paid and
shall not incur any such liability for such Taxes in the taxable year ending
on the Closing Date (other than as set forth in _Schedule 4.11(p)_ of the
Disclosure Letter), and (ii) neither Company nor any Company Subsidiary has
incurred any material liability for Taxes other than (A) in the ordinary
course of business consistent with past practice, or (B) transfer or similar
Taxes arising in connection with a sale, exchange, or other transfer of
property. No event has occurred, and no condition or circumstance exists,
which presents a material risk that any material Tax described in the
preceding sentence will be imposed upon Company or the Company Subsidiaries.

 



 

(f) Company and the Company Subsidiaries have complied, in all material
respects, with all applicable Laws, rules and regulations relating to the
payment and withholding of Taxes (including withholding of Taxes pursuant to

contemplated by this Agreement or the Debt Financing Commitments, Ultimate
Parent will be Solvent at and immediately following the Parent Merger
Effective Time. For purposes of this _Section 5.7_, " _Solvent_ " with
respect to Ultimate Parent means that, as of any date of determination, (i)
the amount of the "present fair saleable value" of the assets of Ultimate
Parent taken as a whole, exceeds, as of such date, the value of all of

transaction contemplated hereby.

"), pursuant to which the Debt Financing Sources have agreed, subject to the
terms and conditions thereof, to provide or cause to be provided the debt
amounts set forth therein (the " **Debt Financing** ") and (ii) the "bought
deal" letter dated as of the date hereof (the " **BD Financing Commitment** ",
and together with the Debt

 



      
 

 



 

Financing Commitments, the " **Financing Commitments** "), pursuant to which
the Person(s) investing thereunder have committed (the " **BD Investors** ",
and together with the Debt Financing Sources, the " **Financing Sources** "),
subject to the terms and conditions thereof, to invest the amount(s) set forth
therein (the " **BD Financing** ", and together with the Debt Financing, the "
**Financing** "). A true and complete copy of each fee letter and engagement
letter related to the Financing Commitments has been provided to Company,
except that the numerical fees and other commercially sensitive numerical
information therein (including provisions in such fee letter related solely to
fees, "flex terms" and economic terms) may have been redacted; provided,
however, that no redacted term provides that the aggregate amount of the
Financing set forth in the unredacted portion of the Financing Commitments
could be reduced or adds any conditions, contingencies or affects the
availability of all or any portion of the Financing. Except for any fee letter
referred to in the Financing Commitments (a copy of which has been provided to
Company in accordance with the foregoing, which may be redacted as permitted
herein), as of the date hereof, there are no side letters or other contracts,
arrangements or understandings related to the funding or investing, as

(b) As of the date of this Agreement, none of the Financing Commitments has
been amended, modified, withdrawn, terminated or rescinded in any material
respect and the respective commitments contained in the Financing Commitments
have not been withdrawn or rescinded. As of the date of this Agreement, the
Financing Commitments are in full force and effect and constitute the legal,
valid and binding obligation of each of the Parent Parties and, to the
knowledge of the Parent, the other parties thereto, except as such
enforceability may be limited by the Enforceability Exceptions. There are no
conditions precedent related to the funding of the full amount of the
Financing other than as set forth in or contemplated by the Financing
Commitments. As of the date of this Agreement, and subject to the satisfaction
of the conditions contained in _Section 8.1_ and _Section 8.2_, no event has
occurred that (with or without notice or lapse of time, or both) would
constitute a breach or default under the Financing Commitments by the Parent
Parties, or to the Knowledge of Parent, the other parties thereto. As of the
date of this Agreement, assuming the accuracy of the Company Parties
representations and warranties set forth in _Article IV_ and assuming
compliance by the Company Parties with the covenants set forth in _Section
7.8_ (to the standards set forth therein) and assuming the satisfaction of the
conditions contained in _Sections 8.1_ and _8.2_ , to the Knowledge of
Parent, there is no reason to believe that the Parent Parties will not be able
to satisfy on a timely basis any term or condition to be satisfied by it and
contained in the Financing Commitments. The Parent Parties have fully paid any
and all commitment fees or other fees required by the terms of the Financing
Commitments to be paid on or before the date of this Agreement.

 



 

(c) Subject to the terms and conditions of the Financing Commitments and
subject to the satisfaction of the conditions contained in _Sections 8.1_ and
_8.2_ , assuming the accuracy of the Company Parties representations and
warranties set forth in _Article IV_ and assuming compliance by the Company
Parties with the covenants set forth in _Section 7.8_, the aggregate proceeds
contemplated by the Financing Commitments, together with other immediately
available financial resources of the Parent Parties, will be sufficient for
the Parent Parties to consummate the Mergers and all other transactions upon
the terms contemplated by this Agreement and pay all related consideration,
fees and expenses pursuant to this Agreement, including the Merger
Consideration or Preferred Merger Consideration.

 



      
 

 



 

Section 5.10 _Brokers_. Except for the fees and expenses payable to RBC
Dominion Securities Inc., no broker, investment banker, financial advisor or
other Person is entitled to any brokers, finders or other similar fee or
commission in connection with the Mergers or any transactions contemplated by
this Agreement.

expressed or implied, with respect to the Company Parties their respective
businesses, operations, assets, liabilities, financial condition, results of
operations, future operating or financial results, estimates, projections,
forecasts, plans or prospects (including the reasonableness of the assumptions
underlying such estimates, projections, forecasts, plans or prospects) or with
respect to the accuracy or completeness of any information regarding any
Company Party, and no Parent Party nor any of their Affiliates nor any other
person on behalf of any Parent Party has relied on any representation or
warranty except for those expressly set forth in this _Article IV_.

Mergers or any of the other transactions contemplated by this Agreement. All
documents that Company is responsible for filing with the SEC in connection
with the Mergers will comply as to form and substance in all material respects
with the applicable requirements of the Exchange Act and the rules and
regulations thereunder.

 



      
 

 



 

(b) As promptly as practicable after the date of this Agreement and,
thereafter, upon Parents written request (though not more frequently than
weekly), Company shall run a broker search for a deemed record date 20
Business Days after the date of such search. Subject to _Section 7.4_,
Company shall, not later than the earlier of (x) the SECs clearance of the
Proxy Statement for mailing the Stockholders and (y) receiving notification
that the SEC is not reviewing the preliminary Proxy Statement, take all
commercially reasonable actions in accordance with applicable Law, the Company
Charter and Company Bylaws and the rules of the NYSE to (i) establish the
earliest reasonably practicable record date for a meeting of the Stockholders
(the " **Record Date** "), (ii) duly call, give notice of, convene and hold a
special meeting of the Stockholders on the earliest reasonably practicable
date (including any adjournment or postponement thereof, the " **Company
Stockholder Meeting** ") for the purpose of obtaining the Company Stockholder
Approval and (iii) file with the SEC, and mail to the Stockholders as of the
Record Date, the definitive Proxy Statement. Without the prior written consent
of Parent, the approval of the Parent Merger and the other transactions
contemplated by this Agreement shall be the only matter (other than matters of
procedure and matters required by applicable Law to be voted on by the
Stockholders in connection with the approval of the Parent Merger and the
other transactions contemplated by this Agreement) that Company shall propose
to be acted on by the Stockholders at the Company Stockholder Meeting. Company
shall solicit from the Stockholders proxies in favor of the approval of the
Parent Merger and the other transactions contemplated by this Agreement in
accordance with applicable Law and, unless the Company Board has effected a
Change in Company Recommendation as permitted by _Section 7.4_, the Proxy
Statement shall include the Company Recommendation and Company shall use its
commercially reasonable efforts to secure the Company Stockholder Approval at
the Company Stockholder Meeting. Company shall cooperate with and keep Parent
reasonably informed on a reasonably current basis regarding its solicitation
efforts and voting results following dissemination of the definitive Proxy
Statement. Company may adjourn or postpone the Company Stockholder Meeting
after consultation with Parent (i) to the extent necessary to ensure that any
supplement or amendment to the Proxy Statement required pursuant to _Section
7.1(a)_ is provided to the Stockholders in compliance with applicable Law,
(ii) if as of the time for which the Company Stockholder Meeting is originally
scheduled (as set forth in the Proxy Statement) there are insufficient shares
of Company Common Stock represented (either in person or by proxy) to
constitute a quorum necessary to conduct the business of the Company
Stockholder Meeting or (iii) for a single period not to exceed ten (10)
Business Days, to solicit additional proxies if necessary to obtain the
Company Stockholder Approval; provided, however, that in no event shall all
such adjournments or postponements be for more than the later of 30 days in
the aggregate or three (3) Business Days prior to the Outside Date and, unless
(and only to the extent) required by applicable Law, the Record Date may not
be changed without Parents prior written consent.

 



 

(c) Notwithstanding any Change in Company Recommendation, Company shall
nonetheless submit the Parent Merger and the other transactions contemplated
by this Agreement to the Stockholders for approval at the Company Stockholders
Meeting unless this Agreement is terminated in accordance with _Article IX_
prior to the Company Stockholder Meeting.

 



      
 

 



 

(d) The Parent Parties shall vote, or cause to be voted, all of the shares of
Company Common Stock then beneficially owned as of the Record Date by it, any
Parent Party or any of their respective Affiliates in favor of the adoption of
this Agreement.

 



 

Section 7.2 _Access to Information_. During the Interim Period, and to the
extent permitted by applicable Law, Company shall, and shall cause each of the
Company Subsidiaries, respectively, to, afford to each Parent Party and to
their respective Representatives reasonable access during normal business
hours and upon reasonable advance notice to all of its respective properties,
offices, books, contracts, personnel and books and records and, during such
period, Company shall, and shall cause each of the Company Subsidiaries to,
(i) furnish as promptly as practicable to the Parent Parties a copy of each
report, schedule, registration statement and other document filed by it during
such period pursuant to the requirements of U.S. federal or state securities
Laws and (ii) furnish as promptly as practicable all other information
(financial or otherwise) concerning its business, properties and personnel as
Parent may reasonably request. No representation or warranty as to the
accuracy of information provided pursuant to this _Section 7.2_ by any
Company Party, or their respective Affiliates and Representatives, is made and
no Parent Party may rely on the accuracy of such information except to the
extent expressly set forth in the representations and warranties included in
_Article IV_. Notwithstanding the foregoing, Company shall not be required by
this _Section 7.2_ to provide any Parent Party or its Representatives with
access to, or to disclose, information (A) that is subject to the terms of a
confidentiality agreement with a third party entered into prior to the date of
this Agreement or entered into after the date of this Agreement in the
ordinary course of business consistent with past practice (if Company has used
commercially reasonable efforts to obtain permission or consent of such third
party to such disclosure), (B) the disclosure of which would violate any Law
or legal or contractual duty of any Company Party or any of their respective
Representatives, (C) that is subject to any attorney-client, attorney work
product or other legal privilege or (D) if it reasonably determines in good
faith that any such access is reasonably likely to materially impair such
Company Partys business or operations; provided, that that Company shall use
commercially reasonable efforts to allow for the fullest access or disclosure
possible in a manner that does not result in triggering any of the
prohibitions set out in clauses (A) through (D). For the avoidance of doubt,
with respect to clause (D), "commercially reasonable efforts" of Company shall
include, as is reasonably practicable, designating any such materials that are
reasonably likely to materially impair such Company Partys business or
operations as "outside counsel only" or "outside accounting firm only." Such
materials and the information contained therein shall be given only to
Parents outside counsel or accounting firm, as the case may be, and will not
be disclosed by such outside counsel or accounting firm to employees,
officers, or directors of Parent without the prior written consent of Company.
Prior to the Parent Merger Effective Time, each of the Parent Parties shall
not, and shall cause their respective Representatives and Affiliates not to,
contact or otherwise communicate with parties with which any Company Party has
a business relationship regarding the business of such Company Party or this
Agreement and the transactions contemplated hereby without giving prior notice
to Company.

to the terms and conditions of this Agreement, each of the Parties hereto
agrees to use its commercially reasonable efforts to (i) cooperate with the
other Party in determining which filings are required to be made prior to the
Closing with, and which consents, clearances, approvals, permits or
authorizations are required to be obtained prior to the Closing from, any
Governmental Authority in connection with the execution and delivery of this
Agreement and the consummation of the Mergers and the other transactions
contemplated hereby and in timely making all such filings, (ii) promptly
furnish the other Party, subject, in appropriate cases, to appropriate
confidentiality agreements to limit disclosure to outside lawyers and
consultants, with such information and reasonable assistance as such other
Party and its Affiliates may reasonably request in connection with their
preparation of necessary filings, registrations and submissions of information
to any Governmental Authority with respect to this Agreement or the
transactions contemplated hereby, (iii) supply as promptly as practicable and
to the extent necessary any additional information and documentary material
that may be requested pursuant to any applicable Laws by any Governmental
Authority and (iv) take or cause to be taken all other actions necessary,
proper or advisable to obtain applicable clearances, consents, authorizations,
approvals or waivers and cause the expiration or termination of the applicable
waiting periods with respect to the Mergers under any applicable Laws as
promptly as practicable and, in any event, no later than the Outside Date.

 



 

(b) Subject to the terms and conditions of this Agreement, each of the Parties
hereto shall, in connection with the efforts referenced in _Section 7.3(a)_,
use its commercially reasonable efforts to: (i) cooperate in all respects with
each other in connection with any investigation or other inquiry, including
any proceeding initiated by a private party with respect to this Agreement or
the transactions contemplated hereby; (ii) promptly notify the other Party of
any communication concerning this Agreement or any of the transactions
contemplated hereby to that Party from or with any Governmental Authority and
consider in good faith the views of the other Party and keep the other Party
reasonably informed of the status of matters related to the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement, including furnishing as promptly as
practicable the other Party with copies of any written notices or other
communications received by such Party from, or given by such Party to, any
Governmental Authority and of any communication received or given in
connection with any proceeding by a private party, in each case regarding any
of the transactions contemplated hereby; and (iii) permit the other Party to
review in draft any proposed written communication to be submitted by it to
any Governmental Authority with reasonable time and opportunity to comment,
and consult with each other in advance of any in-

 



      
 

 



 

person or telephonic meeting or conference with any Governmental Authority or,
in connection with any proceeding by a private party with respect to this
Agreement or the transactions contemplated hereby, with any other Person, and,
to the extent permitted by the applicable Governmental Authority or Person,
not agree to participate in any meeting or discussion with any Governmental
Authority relating to any filings or investigations concerning this Agreement
or any of the transactions contemplated hereby unless it consults with the
other Party and its Representatives in advance and invites the other Partys
Representatives to attend in accordance with applicable Laws. The Parties may,
as advised by outside counsel, designate competitively sensitive information
provided to the other under this _Section 7.3_ as "outside counsel only."
Such materials and the information contained therein shall be given only to
outside counsel of the recipient and will not be disclosed by such outside
counsel to employees, officers, or directors of the recipient without the
advance written consent of the Party providing such materials.

 



 

(c) In furtherance and not in limitation of the foregoing, subject to the
terms and conditions of this Agreement, each of the Parties hereto shall (i)
use its commercially reasonable efforts to resolve objections, if any, as may
be asserted with respect to the transactions contemplated by this Agreement
under any Laws, including defending any lawsuits or other legal proceedings,
whether judicial or administrative, challenging this Agreement or the
consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby (including seeking to
have any stay, temporary restraining order or preliminary injunction entered
by any court or other Governmental Authority vacated or reversed), and (ii)
take, or cause to be taken, all such further commercially reasonable actions
as may be necessary to resolve such objections, if any, as any Governmental
Authority or any other Person may assert under any Law with respect to the
Mergers and the other transactions contemplated hereby, and to avoid or
eliminate each and every impediment under any Law so as to enable the Closing
to occur as promptly as reasonably practicable and, in any event, no later
than the Outside Date.

 



 

(d) Each of the Parties shall, if any takeover statute becomes applicable to
this Agreement, the Mergers, or any other transactions contemplated hereby or
thereby, grant approvals and use all commercially reasonable efforts to ensure
that the Mergers and the other transactions contemplated by this Agreement may
be consummated as promptly as practicable on the terms contemplated hereby or
thereby and otherwise to minimize the effect of such takeover statute on this
Agreement, the Mergers and the other transactions contemplated hereby.

 



 

Section 7.4 _Acquisition Proposals; Changes in Recommendation_.

 



 

(a) Company agrees that it shall not, nor shall it permit any of the Company
Subsidiaries to, authorize or permit any of its officers, directors or
employees to, and shall use its commercially reasonable efforts to cause its
and the Company Subsidiaries other Representatives not to, directly or
indirectly, (i) initiate, solicit or knowingly encourage or knowingly
facilitate any inquiries or the making of any proposal or offer by or with a
Third Party with respect to any Acquisition Proposal, (ii) engage in any
discussions or negotiations concerning, or provide any non-public information
to any Third Party in connection with, or for the purpose of, encouraging or
facilitating any Acquisition Proposal or the making of any proposal or offer
that could reasonably be expected to lead to any Acquisition Proposal or

 



      
 

 



 

(iii) enter into any letter of intent, agreement in principle, merger
agreement, asset purchase or share exchange agreement, option agreement or
other similar agreement with any Third Party providing for any Acquisition
Proposal (each, an " **Acquisition Agreement** ").

 



 

(i) Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the contrary, Company and
its Representatives shall be permitted to take the following actions, prior to
receipt of the Company Stockholder Approval, in response to an unsolicited
bona fide written Acquisition Proposal by any Person made after the date of
this Agreement (provided that the Acquisition Proposal by such Person did not
result from a breach of this _Section 7.4_): (A) contact such Person or group
of Persons solely to clarify the terms and conditions thereof and (B) if the
Company Board concludes in good faith (after consultation with its outside
legal counsel and financial advisors) that such Acquisition Proposal either
constitutes or would be reasonably likely to lead to a Superior Proposal, (I)
engage in or otherwise participate in discussions and negotiations with such
Person and its Representatives regarding such Acquisition Proposal and (II)
provide any information or data (including non-public information or data) to
the Person who made such Acquisition Proposal, but only after entering into an
Acceptable Confidentiality Agreement with such Third Party. Company shall
promptly (and in any event within forty-eight (48) hours) provide Parent with
a copy of any nonpublic information or data provided to a Third Party pursuant
to the prior sentence to the extent such nonpublic information or data has not
been previously provided to Parent.

 



 

(ii) Company will (A) advise Parent in writing of the receipt of any
Acquisition Proposal, the material terms and conditions thereof (including, if
applicable, providing copies of any written Acquisition Proposal and drafts of
proposed agreements related thereto) and the identity of any person making
such Acquisition Proposal on a prompt basis (and in any event within forty-
eight (48) hours) and (B) promptly (and in any event within forty-eight (48)
hours thereafter) notify Parent of any changes to the financial and other
material terms and conditions of any Acquisition Proposal and otherwise keep
Parent reasonably informed of any material changes to the status of any such
Acquisition Proposal, including by providing copies of all proposals, offers
and drafts of proposed agreements related thereto.

 



 

(iii) Except as provided in _Section 7.4(b)(iv)_ or _Section 7.4(b)(v)_, the
Company Board shall not (A) withhold, withdraw, qualify or modify in any
manner adverse to Parent, or propose publicly to withhold, withdraw, qualify
or modify in any manner adverse to Parent, the Company Recommendation, (B)
adopt, authorize, approve or recommend (or publicly propose or announce its
intention to adopt, authorize, approve or recommend) any Acquisition Proposal,
(C) fail to include the Company Recommendation in the Proxy Statement (any
action set forth in the foregoing clauses (A) through (C), a " **Change in
Company Recommendation** ") or (D) authorize, cause or permit Company or any
Company Subsidiary to enter into any letter of intent, agreement in principle,
merger agreement or any other agreement with respect to any Acquisition
Proposal (other than an Acceptable Confidentiality Agreement) or requiring
Company or Company LP to abandon, terminate or fail to consummate the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement.

 



       
 

 



 

(iv) Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the contrary, with respect
to an Acquisition Proposal, the Company Board may, prior to receipt of the
Company Stockholder Approval, make in writing a Change in Company
Recommendation (and in the event that the Company Board determines such
Acquisition Proposal to be a Superior Proposal, in accordance with this
Section 7.4, terminate this Agreement in writing pursuant to _Section 9.1_),
if and only if (A) an unsolicited bona fide written Acquisition Proposal
(provided that the Acquisition Proposal did not result from a breach of this
_Section 7.4_) is made to Company and is not withdrawn, (B) the Company Board
has concluded in good faith (after consultation with its outside legal counsel
and financial advisors) that such Acquisition Proposal constitutes a Superior
Proposal, (C) the Company Board has concluded in good faith (after
consultation with its outside legal counsel) that failure to do so would
reasonably be expected to be inconsistent with their fiduciary duties under
applicable Law, (D) three (3) Business Days (the " **Notice Period** ") shall
have elapsed since Company has given written notice to Parent advising it that
Company intends to take such action and specifying in reasonable detail the
reasons therefor, including the identity of the person making such Acquisition
Proposal, material terms and conditions of any such Superior Proposal that is
the basis of the proposed action, including, if applicable, copies of any
written proposals or offers and any proposed agreements related thereto (a "
**Notice of Recommendation Change** "), which Notice of Recommendation Change
or intention shall not be deemed a Change in Company Recommendation for any
purpose of this Agreement, (E) during such Notice Period, Company has
considered and, at the reasonable request of Parent, engaged in good faith
discussions with Parent regarding any adjustment or modification of the terms
of this Agreement proposed by Parent, and (F) the Company Board, following
such Notice Period, again concludes in good faith (after consultation with its
outside legal counsel and taking into account any adjustment or modification
of the terms of this Agreement proposed by Parent) that the failure to do so
would reasonably be expected to be inconsistent with their fiduciary duties
under applicable Law and that such Acquisition Proposal continues to
constitute a Superior Proposal; provided, however, that if, during the Notice
Period, any material revisions are made to the Superior Proposal by such Third
Party, Company, shall promptly give a new written notice to Parent and shall
comply in all respects with the requirements of this _Section 7.4(a)(iv)_,
which shall apply anew, with respect to such new written notice (provided,
however, that in this instance the Notice Period shall be two (2) Business
Days instead of three (3) Business Days).

 



 

(v) Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the contrary, in
circumstances not involving or relating to an Acquisition Proposal, the
Company Board may, prior to receipt of the Company Stockholder Approval, make
a Change in Company Recommendation if and only if (A) an Intervening Event has
occurred or arisen, (B) the Company Board has first reasonably determined in
good faith (after consultation with outside legal counsel) that failure to do
so would be inconsistent with their fiduciary duties under applicable Law, (C)
three (3) Business Days (the " **Intervening Event Notice Period** ") shall
have elapsed since Company has given a Notice of Recommendation Change (which
Notice of Recommendation Change or intention shall not be deemed a Change in
Company Recommendation for any purpose of this

 



      
 

 



 

Agreement) to Parent advising that Company intends to take such action and
specifying in reasonable detail the reasons therefor, (D) during such
Intervening Event Notice Period, Company has considered and, at the reasonable
request of Parent, engaged in good faith discussions with Parent regarding any
adjustment or modification of the terms of this Agreement proposed by Parent
and (E) the Company Board proposing to take such action, following such
Intervening Event Notice Period, again reasonably determine in good faith
(after consultation with its outside legal counsel, and taking into account
any adjustment or modification of the terms of this Agreement proposed by
Parent) that failure to do so would reasonably be expected to be inconsistent
with their fiduciary duties under applicable Law.

 



 

(vi) Nothing contained in this _Section 7.4_ shall prohibit the Company
Board, directly or indirectly, from (A) taking and disclosing to its
Stockholders a position contemplated by Rule 14e-2(a) promulgated under the
Exchange Act (or any similar communication to its stockholders in connection
with the making or amendment of a tender offer or exchange offer) or from
making a statement contemplated by Item 1012(a) of Regulation M-A or Rule
14d-9 promulgated under the Exchange Act, (B) making any other disclosure to
its Stockholders with regard to the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement or an Acquisition Proposal that the Company Board determines (after
consultation with its outside legal counsel) is reasonably required by
applicable Law or (C) issuing a "stop, look and listen" statement pending
disclosure of its position thereunder; provided, however, that, in each case,
no such action or disclosure that would constitute a Change in Company
Recommendation shall be permitted, made or taken other than in compliance with
_Section 7.4(b)(iv)_ or _Section 7.4(b)(v)_.

 



 

(b) Company agrees that (i) it will and will cause the Company Subsidiaries,
and its and their Representatives to, cease immediately and terminate any and
all existing activities, discussions or negotiations with any Third Parties
conducted heretofore with respect to any Acquisition Proposal and cause such
Third Party to return to Company any nonpublic information or data provided to
it and (ii) it will not release any Third Party from, or terminate, waive,
amend or modify any provisions of, any confidentiality or standstill agreement
to which it or any Company Subsidiary is a party with respect to any
Acquisition Proposal; provided, however, that the Company Board may, to the
extent the Company Board concludes in good faith (after consultation with its
outside legal counsel) that the failure to do so would reasonably be expected
to be inconsistent with their fiduciary duties under applicable Law, release
any Third Party from its standstill obligations solely for purposes of
enabling such Third Party to confidentially submit to the Company Board an
Acquisition Proposal.

 



 

(c) References in this _Section 7.4_ to the Company Board shall mean the
board of directors of Company or any duly authorized committee thereof.

 



 

Section 7.5 _Public Announcements_. Except with respect to any Change in
Company Recommendation or any action taken by Company or the Company Board
pursuant to and in accordance with _Section 7.4_, so long as this Agreement
is an effect, the Parties hereto shall consult with each other before issuing
any press release or otherwise making any public statements or filings with
respect to this Agreement or any of the transactions contemplated by

 



      
 

 



 

this Agreement, and none of the Parties shall issue any such press release or
make any such public statement or filing prior to obtaining the other Parties
consent (which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or
delayed); provided, however, that a Party may, without obtaining the other
Parties consent, (a) issue such press release or make such public statement
or filing as may be required by Law, Order or the applicable rules of any
stock exchange if for any reason it is not reasonably practicable to consult
with the other Party before making any press release, public statement or
filing with respect to this Agreement or any of the transactions contemplated
by this Agreement and (b) issue press releases or make public statements to
the extent that the substance of such press release or public statements was
previously publicly disclosed and subject to the foregoing requirements.

 



 

Section 7.6 _Indemnification; Directors  and Officers Insurance_.

 



 

(a) Without limiting any additional rights that any manager, director,
officer, trustee, employee, agent, or fiduciary may have under any employment
or indemnification or similar agreement, or under the Company Charter, the
Company Bylaws, the Company LP Agreement or, if applicable, similar
organizational documents (including any limited liability company agreement or
partnership agreement) or agreements of any Company Subsidiary (including any
successor entities) (collectively, the " **Organizational Documents** ") or
this Agreement, from and after the Parent Merger Effective Time, the Surviving
Company (the " **Indemnifying Party** ") shall, and Ultimate Parent shall
cause the Indemnifying Party to, for a period of six (6) years from the Parent
Merger Effective Time: (i) indemnify and hold harmless each person who is at
the date hereof, was previously, or is during any of the period from the date
hereof through the date of the Parent Merger Effective Time, serving as a
manager, director or officer of Company or any of the Company Subsidiaries and
acting in such capacity (collectively, the " **Indemnified Parties** ") to the
fullest extent authorized or not prohibited by applicable Law, as now or
hereafter in effect, in connection with any Claim and any losses, damages,
liabilities, costs, Claim Expenses, judgments, fines, penalties and amounts
paid in settlement (including all interest, assessments and other charges paid
or payable in connection with or in respect of any thereof) relating to or
resulting from such Claim; and (ii) promptly (in any event within ten (10)
Business Days after any request for payment or advancement, as applicable) pay
on behalf of, or advance to, each of the Indemnified Parties, to the fullest
extent authorized and not prohibited by applicable Law, as now or hereafter in
effect, any documented Claim Expenses reasonably incurred in defending,
serving as a witness with respect to or otherwise participating with respect
to any Claim in advance of the final disposition of such Claim, including,
upon request by the Indemnified Party, payment on behalf of or advancement to
the Indemnified Party of reasonable Claim Expenses incurred by such
Indemnified Party in connection with enforcing any rights with respect to such
Claim, in each case without the requirement of any bond or other security, but
subject to Parents receipt of an undertaking by or on behalf of such
Indemnified Party to repay all such amounts if it is ultimately determined
under applicable Laws or any of the Organizational Documents that such
Indemnified Party is not entitled to be indemnified; provided, that (x) the
Indemnifying Party shall not be liable for any settlement effected without its
prior written consent (which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld,
conditioned or delayed); and (y) except for legal counsel engaged for one or
more Indemnified Parties on the date hereof, the Indemnifying Party shall not
be obligated under this _Section 7.6(a)_ to pay the fees and expenses of more
than one legal counsel (selected

 



      
 

 



 

by a plurality of the applicable Indemnified Parties) for all Indemnified
Parties in any jurisdiction with respect to any single Claim except to the
extent that, on the advice of any such Indemnified Partys counsel, two or
more of such Indemnified Parties shall have conflicting interests in the
outcome of such action. The indemnification and advancement obligations of the
Indemnifying Party pursuant to this _Section 7.6(a)_ shall extend to acts or
omissions occurring at or before the Parent Merger Effective Time and any
Claim relating thereto (including with respect to any acts or omissions
occurring in connection with the approval of this Agreement, the Mergers and
the consummation of the other transactions contemplated by this Agreement,
including the consideration and approval thereof and the process undertaken in
connection therewith and any Claim relating thereto), and all rights to
indemnification and advancement conferred hereunder shall continue as to a
person who has ceased to be a manager, director or officer of Company or any
of the Company Subsidiaries after the date hereof and shall inure to the
benefit of such persons heirs, executors and personal and legal
representatives. As used in this _Section 7.6(a)_: (A) the term " **Claim** "
means any threatened, asserted, pending or completed Action or inquiry,
whether civil, criminal, administrative, investigative or otherwise, including
any arbitration or other alternative dispute resolution mechanism, and whether
instituted by any Party hereto, any Governmental Authority or any other Person
arising out of or pertaining to matters that relate to such Indemnified
Partys duties (including with respect to any acts or omissions occurring in
connection with the approval of this Agreement, the Mergers and the
consummation of the other transactions contemplated by this Agreement,
including the consideration and approval thereof and the process undertaken in
connection therewith and any Claim relating thereto) or service as a manager,
director or officer of Company or, any of the Company Subsidiaries; and (B)
the term " **Claim Expenses** " means reasonable documented attorneys fees
and all other reasonable costs, expenses and obligations (including experts
fees, travel expenses, court costs, retainers, transcript fees, duplicating,
printing and binding costs, as well as telecommunications, postage and courier
charges) paid or incurred in connection with investigating, defending, being a
witness in or participating in (including on appeal), or preparing to
investigate, defend, be a witness in or participate in, any Claim, including
any Action relating to a claim for indemnification or advancement brought by
an Indemnified Party as contemplated in this _Section 7.6_.

 



 

(b) Without limiting the foregoing, the Parent Parties agree that all rights
to indemnification and exculpation from liabilities for acts or omissions
occurring at or prior to the Partnership Merger Effective Time now existing in
favor of the current or former manager, directors or officers of Company or
any of the Company Subsidiaries as provided in the Organizational Documents
and indemnification or similar agreements of Company shall survive the Parent
Merger and shall continue in full force and effect in accordance with their
terms. Subject to any limitations imposed by applicable Law, for a period of
six (6) years from the Parent Merger Effective Time, (i) the Parent Parties
shall cause the Surviving Company and the Company Subsidiaries to honor and
fulfill in all respects the obligations of the Surviving Company and the
Company Subsidiaries to the Indemnified Parties under the Organizational
Documents and any indemnification or similar agreement of Company or any
Company Subsidiary entered into prior to the Parent Merger Effective Time and
(ii) the charter and bylaws and the limited partnership agreement or other
organizational documents (including any limited liability company agreement or
partnership agreement) of the Parent Parties and the Parent

 



      
 

 



 

Subsidiaries (including any successor entities) and the organizational
documents of any applicable Company Subsidiary (including any limited
liability company agreement or limited partnership agreement) shall contain
provisions no less favorable to the Indemnified Parties with respect to
indemnification, advancement of expenses and limitations on liability of
directors and officers than are set forth in the Organizational Documents,
which provisions shall not be amended, repealed or otherwise modified for a
period of six (6) years from the Parent Merger Effective Time in any manner
that would affect adversely the rights thereunder of individuals who, at or
prior to the Parent Merger Effective Time, were Indemnified Parties, unless
required by applicable Law and then only to the minimum extent required by
applicable Law.

 



 

(c) Prior to the Parent Merger Effective Time, Company shall obtain and fully
pay the premium for, and the Parent Parties shall cause to be maintained in
full force and effect (and the obligations under to be honored), during the
six (6) year period beginning on the date of the Parent Merger Effective Time,
a "tail" prepaid insurance policy or policies (which policy or policies by
their respective express terms shall survive the Mergers) from Companys
current insurance carrier or an insurance carrier with the same or better
credit rating as Companys current insurance carrier, of at least the same
coverage and amounts and containing terms and conditions, retentions and
limits of liability that are no less favorable in the aggregate to the
managers, directors and officers of Company or any of the Company Subsidiaries
as Companys and the Company Subsidiaries existing policy or policies, for
the benefit of the current and former managers, directors and officers of
Company and each Company Subsidiary with a claims reporting or discovery
period of six (6) years from the Parent Merger Effective Time with respect to
directors and officers liability insurance for Claims arising from facts or
events that occurred on or prior to the Parent Merger Effective Time;
provided, however, that in no event shall the aggregate premium payable for
such "tail" insurance policy for its entire period exceed an amount equal to
300% of the current annual premium paid by Company for such insurance (such
amount being the " _Maximum Premium_ "). If Company is unable to obtain the
"tail" insurance described in the first sentence of this _Section 7.6(c)_ for
an amount equal to or less than the Maximum Premium, Company shall be entitled
to obtain as much comparable "tail" insurance as possible for an amount equal
to the Maximum Premium. If Company is unable to, or does not, obtain and fully
pay the premium for such "tail" insurance contemplated in the two preceding
sentences, the Parent Parties shall obtain and fully pay the premium for and
maintain in full force and effect (and honor the obligations under), during
the six (6) year period beginning on the date of the Parent Merger Effective
Time, a "tail" insurance policy or policies (which policy or policies by their
respective express terms shall survive the Mergers) from Companys current
insurance carrier or an insurance carrier with the same or better credit
rating as Companys current insurance carrier, of at least the same coverage
and amounts and containing terms and conditions, retentions and limits of
liability that are no less favorable in the aggregate to managers, directors
and officers of Company or any of the Company Subsidiaries as Company or any
of the Company Subsidiaries existing policy or policies for the benefit of
the current and former directors and officers of Company or any Company
Subsidiary with a claims reporting or discovery period of six (6) years from
the Parent Merger Effective Time; provided, however, that in no event shall
the Parent Parties be required to pay more than the Maximum Premium as the
aggregate premium for such "tail" insurance policies for its entire period, in

 



      
 

 



 

which case the Parent Parties will obtain as much comparable "tail" insurance
as possible for an amount equal to the Maximum Premium.

 



 

(d) If any of the Parent Parties or any of their respective successors or
assigns (i) consolidates with or merges with or into any other Person and
shall not be the continuing or surviving company, partnership or other entity
of such consolidation or merger or (ii) liquidates, dissolves or winds-up, or
transfers or conveys all or substantially all of its properties and assets to
any Person, then, and in each such case, proper provision shall be made so
that the successors and assigns of Ultimate Parent, Parent or Parent LP, as
applicable, shall assume the obligations set forth in this _Section 7.6_.

 



 

(e) The Parent Parties shall pay all reasonable expenses, including reasonable
attorneys fees, that may be incurred by any Indemnified Party in enforcing
the indemnity and other obligations provided in this _Section 7.6_; provided,
however, that such Indemnified Party provides an undertaking to repay such
expenses if it is determined by a final and non-appealable judgment of a court
of competent jurisdiction that such Person is not legally entitled to
indemnification under Law.

 



 

(f) The provisions of this _Section 7.6_ are intended to be for the express
benefit of, and shall be enforceable by, each Indemnified Party and other
Person referred to in this _Section 7.6_ (who are intended to be third party
beneficiaries of this _Section 7.6_), his or her heirs and his or her
personal representatives, shall be binding on all successors and assigns of
the Parent Parties and the Company Parties, and shall not be amended in a
manner that is adverse to the Indemnified Party (including his or her
successors, assigns and heirs) without the prior written consent of the
Indemnified Party (including the successors, assigns and heirs) affected
thereby. The agreements and covenants provided for by this _Section 7.6_,
including with respect to indemnification, exculpation and insurance, shall be
in addition to, and not in substitution for or in exclusion of, any other
rights to indemnification, exculpation or insurance which an Indemnified Party
and other Person referred to in this _Section 7.6_ is entitled, whether
pursuant to applicable Law, contract or otherwise. Nothing in this Agreement
is intended to, shall be construed to or shall release, waive or impair any
rights to directors and officers insurance claims under any policy that is
or has been in existence with respect to Company or the Company Subsidiaries
or their respective directors, officers and other employees, it being
understood and agreed that the indemnification provided for in this _Section
7.6_ is not prior to, or in substitution for, any such claims under any such
policies.

shall use their respective reasonable best efforts to (i) obtain the Financing

under the Financing Commitments or the Alternative Financing Agreements (as
defined below), as applicable, without the prior written consent of Company
(which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed),
except where such amendments, modifications or waivers would not reasonably be
expected to (i) result in the aggregate proceeds of the Financing (as amended
or modified) being insufficient for the Parent Parties to pay (1) the Merger
Consideration, Preferred Merger Consideration and Company OP Unit
Consideration and (2) any other amounts required to be paid in connection with
the consummation of the transactions upon the terms and conditions
contemplated by this Agreement or (ii) (1) prevent or materially delay the

transactions contemplated hereby or (2) adversely impact in any material
respect the ability of the Parent Parties to enforce their respective rights
against the other parties to the Financing Commitments or the Alternative
Financing Documents, as applicable. Without limiting the generality of the
foregoing, neither of the Parent Parties shall release or consent to the
termination of the obligations of the Debt Financing Source(s) under the Debt
Financing Commitments, the BD Investors under the BD Financing Commitments, or
the comparable parties under the Alternative Financing Agreements, as
applicable, except as expressly contemplated hereby. In the event any portion
of the Financing becomes unavailable on the terms and conditions contemplated
in the Financing Commitments, Parent shall promptly so notify Company and
shall use its reasonable best efforts to amend or modify the Financing
Commitments and/or arrange and obtain as promptly as practicable following the
occurrence of such event alternative financing on terms and conditions no less
favorable, in the aggregate, to the Parent Parties, than those contained in
the Financing Commitments (" **Alternative Financing** " which upon being
entered into shall be deemed the "Debt Financing") from alternative sources ("
**Alternative Financing Source** " which upon the entering into of the
Alternative Financing shall be deemed "Debt Financing Sources"), so long as
the aggregate proceeds of the Financing and, if applicable, the Alternative
Financing are sufficient to pay such amounts as are required to consummate the
transactions upon the terms and conditions herein. Parent shall deliver to
Company true and complete copies of all contracts or other arrangements
pursuant to which any Alternative Financing Source shall have committed to
provide the Alternative Financing (the " **Alternative Financing Agreements**
" which upon being entered into shall be deemed the "Debt Financing
Commitments") as promptly as practicable after execution. To the extent the
Alternative Financing has been arranged, and subject to the terms and
conditions of this Agreement, each of the Parent Parties shall use its
reasonable best efforts to (i) obtain such financing on the terms and
conditions described in the Alternative Financing Agreements, (ii) maintain in
effect the Alternative Financing Agreements until the Mergers and other
transactions contemplated by this Agreement are consummated; (iii) satisfy, or
cause to be satisfied, on a timely basis all conditions to the closing and
funding of the Alternative Financing Agreements as applicable to the Parent
Parties that are within their control, and (iv) draw upon and consummate the
Alternative Financing at or prior to the Parent Merger Effective Time.

 



 

(b) Parent shall (i) prior to the Parent Merger Effective Time, give Company
prompt written notice (A) upon becoming aware of any material breach of any
provision of, or termination by any party to, the Financing Commitments or, as
applicable, any Alternative

 



      
 

 



 

Financing Agreements, or (B) upon the receipt of any written notice or other
written communication from any Person with respect to any threatened breach or
threatened termination by any party to the Financing Commitments or
Alternative Financing Agreements, as applicable, and (ii) prior to the Parent
Merger Effective Time, otherwise keep Company reasonably informed of the
status of the Parent Parties efforts to arrange and maintain the Financing or
any Alternative Financing.

 



 

(c) The Parent Parties shall, and shall cause their Parent Subsidiaries to, at
all times after consummation of the BD Financing and prior to the Parent
Merger Effective Time, maintain cash on hand and/or unused revolving
availability under their existing revolving credit facility of no less than
$75,000,000 in the aggregate.

 



 

(d) Each of the Parent Parties acknowledges and agrees that the obtaining of
the Financing (including any Debt Financing, BD Financing or Alternative
Financing) is not a condition to the Closing, and reaffirms its obligation to
consummate the Mergers and other transactions contemplated hereby irrespective
and independent of the availability of the Financing, subject to the
applicable conditions set forth in _Article VIII_.

Company or any Company Subsidiary immediately prior to the Closing and who
remains employed by the Surviving Company, any Company Subsidiary, Ultimate
Parent or any Parent Subsidiary immediately following the Closing (each a "
**Continuing Employee** " and collectively, the " **Continuing Employees** ")
with (i) compensation (base salary and bonus opportunity) that taken as a
whole, are not less favorable in the aggregate than the compensation (base
salary and cash bonus opportunity) provided to each Continuing Employee
immediately prior to the Closing and (ii) benefits, that are, in the
aggregate, no less favorable than those provided to, at Parents election,
either similarly situated employees of (A) Company or any Company Subsidiary
immediately prior to the Closing or (B) Ultimate Parent, Parent or the Parent
Subsidiary, as applicable, immediately following the Closing. During the
period commencing on the Closing and ending on the date that is twelve (12)
months after the Closing, the Parent Parties shall, and shall cause each
Parent Subsidiary to, provide each Continuing Employee, to the extent their
employment is severed during such period, with severance

vesting and benefit level, but not for purposes of any benefit accrual) under
each plan, program, policy, agreement or arrangement of Ultimate Parent,
Parent or the Parent Subsidiaries (including vacation and paid time-off) to
the same extent that such service was recognized under a similar plan,
program, policy, agreement or arrangement of Company or any Company
Subsidiary, except that no such prior service credit will be required or
provided to the extent that (i) it results in a duplication of benefits, or
(ii) such service was not recognized under the corresponding Company Employee
Benefit Plan.

 



 

(c) To the extent permitted by applicable Law, the Parent Parties shall use
commercially reasonable efforts to cause each Employee Benefit Plan of
Ultimate Parent, Parent and the Parent Subsidiaries in which any Continuing
Employee participates that provides health or welfare benefits to (i) waive
all limitations as to preexisting conditions, exclusions, waiting periods and
service conditions with respect to participation and coverage requirements
applicable to Continuing Employees, other than limitations applicable under
the corresponding Company Employee Benefit Plan or to the extent that such
pre-existing condition limitations, exclusions, actively-at-work requirements
and waiting periods would not have been satisfied or waived under the
comparable Company Employee Benefit Plan and (ii) honor any payments, charges
and expenses of Continuing Employees (and their eligible dependents) that were
applied toward the deductible and out-of-pocket maximums under the
corresponding Company Employee Benefit Plan in satisfying any applicable
deductibles, out-of-pocket maximums or co-payments under a corresponding
Company Employee Benefit Plan during the calendar year in which the Closing
occurs.

 



 

(d) Any vacation or paid time off accrued but unused by a Continuing Employee
as of immediately prior to the Parent Merger Effective Time will be credited
to such Continuing Employee following the Parent Merger Effective Time.

Person, including any Continuing Employee or former employee of Company or the
Company Subsidiaries, other than the Parties to this Agreement and their
respective successors and permitted assigns, (ii) constitute or create an
employment agreement or create any right in any Continuing Employee or any
other Person to any continued employment or service with or for Company, the
Company Subsidiaries, Ultimate Parent, Parent or the Parent Subsidiaries, or
to any compensation or benefits of any nature or kind whatsoever, (iii)
constitute or be treated as an amendment, modification, adoption, suspension
or termination of any employee benefit plan, program, policy, agreement or
arrangement of Company, the Company Subsidiaries, Ultimate Parent, Parent, or
the Parent Subsidiaries, or (iv) alter or limit the ability of Company, the
Company Subsidiaries, Ultimate Parent, Parent or the Parent Subsidiaries to
amend, modify or

 



      
 

 



 

terminate any benefit plan, program, policy, agreement or arrangement at any
time assumed, established, sponsored or maintained by any of them.

 



 

Section 7.18 _Integration Planning_. As promptly as practicable after the date
of this Agreement, Parent and Company shall use their respective commercially
reasonable efforts to establish a mechanism, subject to applicable Law,
reasonably acceptable to both Parties by which the Parties will confer on a
regular and continued basis (subject to reasonable advance written notice of
any such meeting being provided to each Party) regarding the general status of
the ongoing operations and administration of Company and the Company
Subsidiaries (including with respect to the ongoing debt and equity
capitalization of Company and Company Subsidiaries) and integration planning
matters and communicate and consult with, and use their respective
commercially reasonable efforts to cooperate with, each other and the specific
persons to be identified by each Party with respect to the foregoing.

 



 

Section 7.19 _Company Capitalization_. Company shall make available to Parent,

of the preceding calendar month and (y) in respect of clause (b), the most

Section 7.21 _Use of Company Cash_. At the prior written direction of Parent
and subject to any applicable limitations or restrictions imposed by
applicable Law or pursuant to any contractual agreement to which Company or
any Company Subsidiary is a party immediately prior to the Closing, Company
shall, in connection with the Closing, use the existing unrestricted cash of
Company and the Company Subsidiaries to, at Parents election, either
contribute to (a) repayment of the Existing Company Indebtedness and/or (b)
the Payment Fund for purposes of paying the Merger Consideration, Preferred
Merger Consideration and Company OP Unit Consideration.

underlying such Notice of Recommendation Change that is not publicly made
shall in and of itself be considered a Change in Company Recommendation), (ii)
the Company Board shall have failed to publicly recommend against any tender
offer or exchange offer that constitutes an Acquisition Proposal (including,

offer; (iii) the Company Board shall have failed to publicly reaffirm the
Company Recommendation within ten (10) Business Days after the date an

Section 9.2 _Effect of Termination_. In the event that this Agreement is
terminated pursuant to _Section 9.1_, written notice thereof shall be given
to the other Party or Parties, specifying the provisions hereof pursuant to
which such termination is made and describing the basis therefor in reasonable
detail, and subject to compliance with _Section 9.3_, this Agreement shall
forthwith become null and void and of no further force or effect whatsoever
without liability on the part of any Party hereto, and all rights and
obligations of any Party hereto shall cease; provided, however, that,
notwithstanding anything in the foregoing to the contrary (a) subject to
_Section 9.3(b)_, no such termination shall relieve any Party hereto of any
liability or damages resulting from or arising out of any Partys willful
breach of this Agreement prior to its termination, or for fraud; and (b) the
Confidentiality Agreement, _Section 7.5_, the indemnification and
reimbursement obligations of _Section 7.8_, this _Section 9.2_, _Section

Agreement pursuant to _Section 9.1_. For purposes of this Agreement, "willful
breach" means a breach that is a consequence of an act knowingly undertaken by
the breaching party with either the intent of causing a breach of this
Agreement or the knowledge that such act constitutes a breach of this
Agreement. If this Agreement is terminated as provided herein, all filings,
applications and other submissions made pursuant to this Agreement, to the
extent practicable and permitted by applicable Law, shall be withdrawn from
the Governmental Authority or other Person to which they were made. If a
Delaware Court awards damages to any Parent Party as a result of a willful
breach by a Company Party of this Agreement prior to its termination or fraud
by a Company Party, the Parties agree that any such damages shall be paid to
Ultimate Parent.

(b) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary set forth in this Agreement, the
Parties agree that payment of the Termination Fee by Company to Ultimate
Parent, or the Parent Termination Fee by the Parent Parties to Company, will
in each case constitute liquidated

 



      
 

 



 

damages for any and all losses and liabilities of any kind suffered by the
Parent Parties and their Affiliates, on the one hand, and the Company Parties
and their Affiliates, on the other hand, and from and after such termination

shall be taken into account when determining any remedies), or (ii) both a
grant of specific performance to consummate the Closing (to the extent

remedies, including all or any portion of the Termination Fee or Parent
Termination Fee, as applicable. In no event will the Parent Parties be

(c) Each of the Parties hereto acknowledges that (i) the agreements contained
in this _Section 9.3_ are an integral part of the transactions contemplated
by this Agreement, (ii) neither the Termination Fee or Parent Termination Fee
is a penalty, and (iii) without these agreements, the Parent Parties and

Section 9.4 _Payment of Parent Termination Fee_.

 



 

(a) In the event that the Parent Parties are obligated to pay the Parent
Termination Fee pursuant to _Section 9.3(a)_ (the " **Parent Termination Fee
Base Amount** "), the Parent Parties shall actually pay, or cause to be paid,
to Company from the applicable Parent Termination Fee Base Amount, an amount
equal to the lesser of (i) the Parent Termination Fee Base Amount and (ii) the
maximum amount that can be paid to Company without causing Company to fail to
meet the requirements of Sections 856(c)(2) and (3) of the Code determined as
if the payment of such amount did not constitute income described in Sections
856(c)(2) or 856(c)(3) of the Code (" **Qualifying Income** "), as determined
by Company; provided that in the event either (1) Company has received a
ruling from the IRS described in _Section 9.4(b)(ii)_ or (2) an opinion from
Companys outside counsel as described in _Section 9.4(b)(ii)_, Company may
elect to receive payment of the entire Parent Termination Fee Base Amount.
Company shall give reasonable advance notice to Parent in writing of the
amount that may be paid to it under the preceding sentence. The Parent Parties
shall be obligated to deposit any unpaid balance of the Parent Termination Fee
Base Amount (the " **Remaining Parent Termination Fee** ") into escrow to
secure the Parent Parties obligations to pay the Remaining Parent Termination
Fee (with such escrow agent selected by Company and on such terms (subject to
_Section 9.4(b)_) as shall be mutually agreed upon by Company, Parent and the
escrow agent as reflected in an escrow agreement among such parties, provided
that the payment or deposit into escrow shall be at Companys option). The
deposit into escrow of the Remaining Parent Termination Fee pursuant to this
_Section 9.4(a)_ shall be made at the time the Parent Parties would otherwise
be obligated to pay, or cause to be paid, Company the Parent Termination Fee
pursuant to _Section 9.3(a)_ by wire transfer of same day funds.

 



 

(b) The escrow agreement shall provide that the Remaining Parent Termination
Fee held in escrow or any portion thereof shall not be released to Company
unless the escrow agent receives any one or combination of the following: (i)
a letter from Company indicating the maximum amount that can be paid by the
escrow agent to Company without causing Company to fail to meet the
requirements of Sections 856(c)(2) and (3) of the Code in a particular year
determined as if the payment of such amount did not constitute Qualifying
Income or a subsequent letter from Company revising that amount, in which case
the escrow agent shall release such amount to Company, or (ii) a letter from
Companys counsel indicating that Company received a ruling from the IRS
holding that the receipt by Company of the Remaining Parent Termination Fee
would either constitute Qualifying Income or would be excluded from gross
income within the meaning of Sections 856(c)(2) and (3) of the Code (or
alternatively, Companys outside counsel has rendered a legal opinion to the
effect that the receipt by Company of the Remaining Parent Termination Fee
would either constitute Qualifying Income or would be excluded from gross
income within the meaning of Sections 856(c)(2) and (3) of the Code), in which
case the escrow agent shall release the entire unpaid Remaining Parent
Termination Fee to Company. The Parent Parties agree to amend this _Section
9.4_ at the reasonable request of Company in order to (x) maximize the portion
of the Parent Termination Fee Base Amount that may be distributed to Company
hereunder

 



      
 

 



 

without causing Company to fail to meet the requirements of Sections 856(c)(2)
and (3) of the Code, (y) improve Companys chances of securing a favorable
ruling described in this _Section 9.4(b)_ or (z) assist Company in obtaining
a favorable legal opinion from its outside counsel as described in this
_Section 9.4_. The Parent Parties shall be deemed to have satisfied their
obligations pursuant to _Section 9.3(a)_ and this _Section 9.4_ so long as
the Parent Parties make all of the cash payments to Company and deposits into
escrow in accordance with this _Section 9.4_, and the Parent Parties shall
thereafter have no further liability with respect to payment of the Parent
Termination Fee Base Amount. The portion of the Remaining Parent Termination
Fee that remains unpaid as of the end of a taxable year shall be paid as soon
as possible during the following taxable year, subject to the foregoing
limitations of this _Section 9.4_. Company shall fully indemnify the Parent
Parties from and against any liabilities, losses, damages, claims, costs,
expenses, interest, awards, judgments and penalties suffered or incurred by it
resulting directly or indirectly from the escrow arrangements contemplated by
this _Section 9.4_.

 



 

Section 9.5 _Amendment_. To the extent permitted by applicable Law and subject
to the second sentence of this _Section 9.5_, this Agreement may be amended
by the Parties hereto, by action taken or authorized by the Company Board or
the Ultimate Parent Board, as applicable, at any time before or after the
Company Stockholder Approval of the applicable matters presented in connection
with the Mergers, but, after any such approval, no amendment shall be made
which by Law requires further approval by the Stockholders without such
further approval by such Stockholders. This Agreement may not be amended
except by an instrument in writing signed on behalf of each of the Parties
hereto and, with respect to this _Section 9.5_, _Sections 10.4(e)_ , _10.7_ ,
_10.8(c)_ , _10.9_ and _10.11_ , to the extent such amendment is material and
adverse to the interests of the Financing Sources, taken as a whole, the
consent of the Financing Sources.

 



 

Section 9.6 _Extension; Waiver_. At any time prior to the Parent Merger
Effective Time, the Parties hereto, by action taken or authorized by the
Company Board or the Ultimate Parent Board and Parent Board, as applicable,
may, to the extent legally allowed, (a) extend the time for the performance of
any of the obligations or other acts of the other Party hereto, (b) waive any
inaccuracies in the representations and warranties of the other Party
contained herein or in any document delivered pursuant hereto, and (c) waive
compliance with any of the agreements or conditions contained herein. Any
agreement on the part of a Party hereto to any such extension or waiver shall
be valid only if set forth in a written instrument signed on behalf of such
Party. The failure of a Party to assert any of its rights under this Agreement
or otherwise shall not constitute a waiver of those rights. No single or
partial exercise of any right, remedy, power or privilege hereunder shall
preclude any other or further exercise thereof or the exercise of any other
right, remedy, power or privilege. Any waiver shall be effective only in the
specific instance and for the specific purpose for which given and shall not
constitute a waiver to any subsequent or other exercise of any right, remedy,
power or privilege hereunder.

Section 10.3 _Counterparts_. This Agreement may be executed in counterparts,
all of which shall be considered one and the same agreement and shall become
effective when counterparts have been signed by each of the Parties and
delivered to each other Party (including by means of electronic delivery), it
being understood that the Parties need not sign the same counterpart.
Signatures to this Agreement transmitted by facsimile transmission, by
electronic mail in "portable document format" (".pdf"), or by any other
electronic means intended to preserve the original graphic and pictorial
appearance of a document, will have the same effect as physical delivery of
the paper document bearing the original signature.

 



 

Section 10.4 _Entire Agreement; No Third-Party Beneficiaries_. This Agreement
(including the schedules, documents and the instruments referred to herein)
constitutes the entire agreement and supersedes all prior agreements and
understandings, both written and oral, between the Parties with respect to the
subject matter hereof, other than the Confidentiality Agreement, which shall
survive the execution and delivery of this Agreement. Nothing in this
Agreement, express or implied, is intended to or shall confer upon any person
(other than the Parties hereto) any right, benefit or remedy of any nature
whatsoever under or by reason of this Agreement except for (a) the rights,
benefits and remedies granted to the Indemnified Parties under _Section 7.6_,
(b) after the Partnership Merger Effective Time, the rights of the holders of
Company OP Common Units to receive the consideration set forth in _Article
III_ in accordance with the provisions of this Agreement, (c) after the Parent
Merger Effective Time, the rights of the holders of Company Common Stock to

of holders of Company Restricted Stock Awards and Company PSUs to receive the
consideration specified in _Article III_ in accordance with the provisions of
this Agreement, (d) the right of Company, on behalf of its Stockholders, to
pursue claims for damages and other relief, including equitable relief, for
any breach of this Agreement by the Parent Parties, to the extent recovery is
otherwise permitted under _Section 9.2_ and _Section 9.3_ and (e) the rights
of the Financing Sources under this _Section 10.4_ and _Sections 9.5_ ,
_10.7_ , _10.8(c)_ , _10.9_ and _10.11_ , and

 



      
 

 



 

such Financing Sources are hereby made express third party beneficiaries of
such Sections. The representations and warranties in this Agreement may
represent an allocation among the Parties of risks associated with particular
matters regardless of the knowledge of any of the Parties. Accordingly,
Persons other than the Parties may not rely upon the representations and
warranties in this Agreement as characterizations of actual facts or
circumstances as of the date of this Agreement or as of any other date.

 



 

Section 10.5 _Severability_. Any term or provision of this Agreement which is
invalid or unenforceable in any jurisdiction shall, as to that jurisdiction,
be ineffective only to the extent of such invalidity or unenforceability and,
unless the effect of such invalidity or unenforceability would prevent the
Parties from realizing the major portion of the economic benefits of the
Mergers that they currently anticipate obtaining therefrom, shall not render
invalid or unenforceable the remaining terms and provisions of this Agreement
or affect the validity or enforceability of any of the terms or provisions of
this Agreement in any other jurisdiction. If any provision of this Agreement
is so broad as to be unenforceable, the provision shall be interpreted to be
only so broad as is enforceable.

 



 

Section 10.6 _Assignment_. Neither this Agreement nor any of the rights,
interests or obligations of the Parties hereunder shall be assigned by any of
the Parties hereto (whether by operation of law or otherwise) without the
prior written consent of the other Parties, and any attempt to make any such
assignment without such consent shall be null and void; provided, _however_ ,
that the Parent Parties may assign their rights and benefits hereunder, in
whole or in part, without the prior written consent of the Company Parties (i)
to any Financing Source as collateral security or (ii) to any of its
Affiliates, provided that no such assignment will relieve any Parent Party
from its obligations under this Agreement. Subject to the preceding sentence,
this Agreement will be binding upon, inure to the benefit of and be
enforceable by the Parties and their respective successors and permitted
assigns.

 



 

Section 10.7 _Governing Law_. This Agreement and all claims or causes of
actions (whether at Law, in contract or in tort) that may be based upon, arise
out of or related to this Agreement or the negotiation, execution or
performance of this Agreement shall be governed by and construed in accordance
with the laws of the State of Delaware applicable to agreements entered into
and performed entirely therein by residents thereof, without regard to any
provisions relating to choice of laws among different jurisdictions, except
that (i) the provisions of the DLLCA and the MGCL applicable to the
authorization, effectiveness and effects of the Parent Merger and the
provisions of the DRULPA applicable to the authorization, effectiveness and
effects of the Partnership Merger will apply to the Parent Merger and the
Partnership Merger and (ii) the applicable Law of the State of Maryland shall
apply to the discharge of the fiduciary duties of the Company Board (or any
committees thereof) in connection with the Merger Agreement.

 



 

Section 10.8 _Specific Performance; Venue_.

 



 

(a) The Parties agree that irreparable damage would occur if any of the
provisions of this Agreement were not performed in accordance with their
specific terms or were otherwise breached, including if the Parties hereto
fail to take any action required of them

 



      
 

 



 

hereunder to consummate the transactions contemplated by this Agreement (and,
more specifically, that irreparable damage would occur if the Mergers were not
consummated, including the Parties obligations to consummate the Mergers and
the obligation of the Parent Parties to pay, and the right of the holders of
Company Common Stock and the holders of Company Preferred Stock right to
receive, the aggregate Merger Consideration and the Preferred Merger
Consideration, as applicable, pursuant to the Mergers, subject in each case to
the terms and conditions of this Agreement), and that monetary damages, even
if available, would not be an adequate remedy therefor. It is accordingly
agreed that, subject to _Section 10.8(b)_, prior to the termination of this
Agreement pursuant to _Article IX_, the Parties sole and exclusive remedy
shall be an injunction or injunctions, specific performance or other equitable
relief to prevent breaches of this Agreement and to enforce specifically the
terms and provisions of this Agreement, without proof of damages or otherwise
(including the Parties obligations to consummate the Mergers and the
obligation of the Parent Parties to pay, and the right of the holders of
Company Common Stock and the holders of Company Preferred Stock right to
receive, the aggregate Merger Consideration and the Preferred Merger
Consideration, as applicable, pursuant to the Mergers, subject in each case to
the terms and conditions of this Agreement) in the Court of Chancery of the
State of Delaware and any appellate court therefrom, unless such court shall
decline to accept jurisdiction over a particular matter, in which case, in the
Superior Court of the State of Delaware (in the Complex Commercial Litigation
Division thereof if permitted by the applicable rules of the Superior Court)
and any appellate court therefrom or, if the Superior Court of the State of
Delaware declines to accept jurisdiction over a particular matter, any federal
court located in the State of Delaware and any federal appellate court
therefrom (collectively, the " **Delaware Courts** "), and each Party hereto
hereby waives any requirement for the securing or posting of any bond in
connection with such remedy, this being in addition to any other remedy to
which they are entitled at Law or in equity. Each Party agrees that the right
of specific performance and other equitable relief is an integral part of the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement and without that right neither the
Company Parties nor the Parent Parties would have entered into this Agreement.
The Parties agree not to assert that a remedy of specific performance or other
equitable relief is unenforceable, invalid, contrary to law or inequitable for
any reason, and not to assert that a remedy of monetary damages would provide
an adequate remedy or that the parties otherwise have an adequate remedy at
law. If, prior to the Outside Date, any party brings an action to enforce
specifically the performance of the terms and provisions of this Agreement by
another party, the Outside Date shall automatically be extended by (i) the
amount of time during which such action is pending, plus twenty (20) Business
Days, or (ii) such other time period established by the court presiding over
such action.

 



 

(b) Notwithstanding the foregoing, it is explicitly agreed that the Company
Parties shall each be entitled to seek specific performance of Parents
obligation to consummate the Closing if and only if (i) all of the conditions
to the obligations of the Parent Parties to consummate the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement set forth in _Section 8.1_ and _Section 8.2_
have been satisfied or waived in writing as of or prior to the date the
Closing should have been consummated pursuant to Section 2.3 and the other
terms of this Agreement (other than those conditions that by their terms are
to be satisfied by actions taken at the Closing, and subject to such
conditions being capable of being satisfied), (ii) the Company Parties have

 



      
 

 



 

irrevocably confirmed to Parent in writing that, if specific performance is
granted and the BD Financing and Debt Financing are funded, the Company
Parties are ready, willing and able to (and shall) perform their respective
obligations in connection with effectuating the Closing, subject to the
satisfaction of those conditions to Company Parties obligation to consummate
the Closing that by their terms are to be satisfied by actions taken at the
Closing, (iii) the BD Financing has been funded, (iv) the Debt Financing
(and/or, if applicable, the Alternative Debt Financing) has been funded or the
financing sources thereunder have indicated that the Debt Financing (and/or,
if applicable, the Alternative Debt Financing) will be funded at the Closing,
and (v) Parent fails to consummate the Closing within three (3) Business Days
following the date of the notice described in clause (ii).

 



 

(c) Each of the Parties irrevocably agrees that any legal action or proceeding
arising out of or relating to this Agreement, the Financing or the Financing
Sources (including with respect to any claim or cause of action whether at
Law, in equity, in contract or tort and with respect to any claim or cause of
action relating to the negotiation, execution or performance of this
Agreement) brought by any other Party, its Affiliates or its successors or
assigns shall be brought and determined in the Delaware Courts (subject to the
order of preference of each of the Delaware Courts set forth in _Section
10.8(a)_), and each of the Parties hereby irrevocably submits to the exclusive
jurisdiction of the aforesaid courts for itself and with respect to its
property, generally and unconditionally, with regard to any such action or
proceeding arising out of or relating to this Agreement and the transactions
contemplated hereby. Each of the Parties agrees not to commence, permit any
of their respective Affiliates to commence or support any other Person in
commencing any action, suit or proceeding relating thereto except in the
Delaware Courts.

 



 

(d) Each of the Parties further agrees that notice as provided herein shall
constitute sufficient service of process and the Parties further waive any
argument that such service is insufficient. Each of the Parties hereby
irrevocably and unconditionally waives, and agrees not to assert, by way of
motion or as a defense, counterclaim or otherwise, in any action or proceeding
arising out of or relating to this Agreement or the transactions contemplated
hereby, (i) any claim that it is not personally subject to the jurisdiction of
the Delaware Courts as described herein for any reason, (ii) that it or its
property is exempt or immune from jurisdiction of any such court or from any
legal process commenced in the Delaware Courts (whether through service of
notice, attachment prior to judgment, attachment in aid of execution of
judgment, execution of judgment or otherwise) and (iii) that (A) the suit,
action or proceeding in any such court is brought in an inconvenient forum,
(B) the venue of such suit, action or proceeding is improper, or (C) this
Agreement, or the subject matter hereof, may not be enforced in or by such
courts.

 



 

(e) EACH PARTY ACKNOWLEDGES THAT IT IS KNOWINGLY AND VOLUNTARILY AGREEING TO
THE CHOICE OF DELAWARE LAW TO GOVERN THIS AGREEMENT AND TO THE JURISDICTION OF
DELAWARE COURTS IN CONNECTION WITH PROCEEDINGS ARISING OUT OF OR RELATING TO
THIS AGREEMENT AND THE TRANSACTIONS CONTEMPLATED HEREBY. THE PARTIES INTEND
THIS TO BE AN EFFECTIVE CHOICE OF DELAWARE LAW AND AN EFFECTIVE CONSENT TO
JURISDICTION AND SERVICE OF PROCESS UNDER 6 DEL.

 



      
 

 



 

C. § 2708, INCLUDING THAT THIS AGREEMENT INVOLVES OVER $100,000 FOR PURPOSES
OF THE APPLICATION OF 6 DEL. C. § 2708.

 



 

Section 10.9 _WAIVER OF JURY TRIAL_. EACH PARTY HERETO HEREBY IRREVOCABLY
WAIVES, TO THE FULLEST EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW, ANY RIGHT IT MAY
HAVE TO A TRIAL BY JURY IN RESPECT OF ANY SUIT, ACTION OR OTHER PROCEEDING
(WHETHER BASED ON CONTRACT, TORT OR OTHERWISE) ARISING OUT OF OR RELATING TO
THIS AGREEMENT, THE TRANSACTIONS CONTEMPLATED HEREBY, THE FINANCING, THE
TRANSACTIONS CONTEMPLATED THEREBY OR THE FINANCING SOURCES. EACH PARTY HERETO
(A) CERTIFIES THAT NO REPRESENTATIVE OF ANY OTHER PARTY HAS REPRESENTED,
EXPRESSLY OR OTHERWISE, THAT SUCH PARTY WOULD NOT, IN THE EVENT OF ANY ACTION,
SUIT OR PROCEEDING, SEEK TO ENFORCE THE FOREGOING WAIVER AND (B) ACKNOWLEDGES
THAT IT AND THE OTHER PARTIES HERETO HAVE BEEN INDUCED TO ENTER INTO THIS
AGREEMENT, BY, AMONG OTHER THINGS, THE MUTUAL WAIVER AND CERTIFICATIONS IN
THIS _SECTION 10.9_.

 



 

Section 10.10 _Authorship_. The Parties agree that the terms and language of
this Agreement are the result of negotiations between the Parties and their
respective advisors and, as a result, there shall be no presumption that any
ambiguities in this Agreement shall be resolved against any Party. Any
controversy over construction of this Agreement shall be decided without
regard to events of authorship or negotiation.

 



 

Section 10.11 _Financing Sources_. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary
contained in this Agreement, (a) the Company Parties, the Company Subsidiaries
and their respective Affiliates, directors, officers, employees, agents,
partners, managers, members or stockholders shall not have any rights or
claims against any Financing Source in any way relating to this Agreement or
any of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, or in respect of any
oral representations made or alleged to have been made in connection herewith
or therewith, including any dispute arising out of or relating in any way to
the Financing, whether at Law or equity, in contract, in tort or otherwise and
(b) no Financing Source shall have any liability (whether in contract, in tort
or otherwise) to the Company Parties, the Company Subsidiaries and their
respective Affiliates, directors, officers, employees, agents, partners,
managers, members or stockholders for any obligations or liabilities of any
party hereto under this Agreement or for any claim based on, in respect of, or
by reason of, the transactions contemplated hereby or in respect of any oral
representations made or alleged to have been made in connection herewith or
therewith, including any dispute arising out of or relating in any way to the
Financing whether at Law or equity, in contract, in tort or otherwise.
Notwithstanding the foregoing provisions of this _Section 10.11_, following
the consummation of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, the
foregoing provisions will not limit the rights of the parties to the Financing
under the definitive agreements in respect of the Financing.
