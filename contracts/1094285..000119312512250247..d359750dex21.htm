This AGREEMENT AND PLAN OF MERGER (this " _Agreement_ "), dated as of May 28,
2012, is by and among TELEDYNE TECHNOLOGIES INCORPORATED, a Delaware

to which each Stockholder party thereto has, among other things, agreed to

for other good and valuable consideration, the receipt and sufficiency of
which is hereby acknowledged, and intending to be legally bound hereby, the

date hereof;

(ii) use best efforts to prepare and file with the United States Securities
and Exchange Commission (the " _SEC_ "), within fourteen (14) Business Days

approval of this Agreement.

 

(c) Each of the Company, Parent and Merger Sub agrees to promptly (i) correct
any information provided by it specifically for use in the Proxy Statement if
and to the extent that such information shall have become false or misleading
in any material respect and (ii) supplement the information provided by it
specifically for use in the Proxy Statement to include any information that
shall become necessary in order to make the statements in the Proxy Statement,
in light of the circumstances under which they were made, not misleading. The
Company further agrees to cause the Proxy Statement as so corrected
or supplemented promptly to be filed with the SEC and to be disseminated to
its stockholders, in each case as and to the extent required by applicable
federal securities laws.

ARTICLE II

CONVERSION OF SECURITIES

 

Section 2.1 _Conversion of Capital Stock_. As of the Effective Time, by virtue
of the Merger and without any action on the part of the holders of any shares
of the Company Common Stock or of the shares of common stock, $0.01 par value,
of Merger Sub (the " _Merger Sub Common Stock_ "):

(a) _Merger Sub Common Stock_. Each issued and outstanding share of Merger Sub
Common Stock shall be converted into and become one validly issued, fully paid
and nonassessable share of the common stock, $0.01 par value, of the
Surviving Corporation.

(b) _Cancellation of Treasury Stock and Parent-Owned Stock_. All shares of
Company Common Stock that are owned by the Company as treasury stock, all
shares of Company Common Stock owned by any Subsidiary of the Company and any
shares of Company Common Stock owned by Parent, Merger Sub or any other
wholly-owned Subsidiary of Parent shall be canceled and retired and shall
cease to exist and no cash or other consideration shall be delivered or
deliverable in exchange therefor.

(c) _Conversion of Shares_. Each issued and outstanding share of Company
Common Stock, other than Shares to be canceled in accordance with _Section
2.1(b)_ and Dissenting Shares (if any), shall be converted into the right to
receive the Merger Consideration in cash, without interest, payable to the
holder thereof upon surrender of the certificate formerly representing such
share of Company Common Stock in the manner provided in  _Section 2.2_. All
such shares of Company Common Stock, when so converted, shall no longer be
outstanding and shall automatically be canceled and retired and shall cease to
exist, and each 

 



4  holder of a certificate representing any such Shares shall cease to have any
rights with respect thereto, except the right to receive the Merger
Consideration therefor upon the surrender of such certificate in accordance
with _Section 2.2_, without interest.

(d) _Adjustments to Merger Consideration_. The Merger Consideration shall be
adjusted (at Parents option) to reflect fully the appropriate effect of any
stock split, reverse stock split, stock dividend or distribution (including
any dividend or distribution of securities convertible into Company Common
Stock), reorganization, recapitalization, reclassification or other like
change; _provided_ that nothing in this _Section 2.1(d)_ shall be construed
to permit the Company to take any action with respect to its securities that
is otherwise prohibited by the terms of this Agreement.

Section 2.2 _Exchange of Certificates_. 

(a) _Paying Agent_. Prior to the Effective Time, Parent shall designate a bank
or trust company (the " _Paying Agent_ "), reasonably acceptable to the
Company to make the payments of the funds to which holders of shares of
Company Common Stock shall become entitled pursuant to _Section 2.1(c)_ and
to which holders of Company Stock Rights (as defined in _Section 2.4_) shall
become entitled pursuant to _Section 2.4_. When and as needed, Parent shall
deposit with the Paying Agent such funds in trust for the benefit of holders
of shares of Company Common Stock for exchange in accordance with _Section
2.1_, and for the benefit of holders of Company Stock Rights in accordance
with _Section 2.4_, for timely payment hereunder. Such funds shall be
invested by the Paying Agent as directed by Parent; _provided_ that such
investments shall be in obligations of or guaranteed by the United States of
America and backed by the full faith and credit of the United States of
America or in commercial paper obligations rated A-1 or P-1 or better by
Moodys Investors Service, Inc. or Standard and Poors, respectively. Any net
profit resulting from, or interest or income produced by, such investments
will be payable to Parent.

 

(b) _Exchange Procedures_. As promptly as practicable after the Effective
Time, but in no event more than ten (10) days thereafter, Parent shall cause
the Paying Agent to mail to each holder of record of a certificate or
certificates that, immediately prior to the Effective Time, represented
outstanding shares of Company Common Stock (the " _Certificates_ ") whose
shares were converted pursuant to _Section 2.1(c)_ into the right to receive
the Merger Consideration:

(i) a letter of transmittal (which shall specify that delivery shall be
effected, and risk of loss and title to the Certificates shall pass, only upon
delivery of the Certificates to the Paying Agent and shall be in such form
and have such other provisions as Parent and the Surviving Corporation may
reasonably specify); and

(ii) instructions for use in effecting the surrender of the Certificates in
exchange for payment of the Merger Consideration.

Upon surrender of a Certificate for cancellation to the Paying Agent, together
with such letter of transmittal, duly executed by the holder of such
Certificate, the holder of such Certificate shall 

 



5  be entitled to receive in exchange therefor the Merger Consideration
(subject to _Section 2.2(d)_ and _Section 2.2(e)_) multiplied by the number
of shares of Company Common Stock formerly represented by such Certificate
and the Certificate so surrendered shall forthwith be canceled. If payment of
the Merger Consideration is to be made to an individual, corporation, limited
liability company, or other entity (a " _Person_ ") other than the Person in
whose name the surrendered Certificate is registered, it shall be a condition
of payment that the Certificate so surrendered shall be properly endorsed or
shall be otherwise in proper form for transfer and that the Person requesting
such payment shall have paid any transfer and other taxes required by reason
of the payment of the Merger Consideration to a Person other than the
registered holder of the Certificate surrendered or shall have established to
the satisfaction of the Surviving Corporation that such tax either has been
paid or is not applicable. Until surrendered as contemplated by this _Section
2.2(b)_, each Certificate held by a holder whose Shares were
converted pursuant to _Section 2.1(c))_ into the right to receive the Merger
Consideration shall be deemed at any time after the Effective Time to
represent only the right to receive the Merger Consideration in cash as
contemplated by this  _Section 2.2_. If any Certificate has been lost,
stolen or destroyed, upon the making of an affidavit of that fact by the
Person claiming such Certificate to be lost, stolen or destroyed and, if
required by Parent or the Surviving Corporation, the posting by such Person
of a bond in such reasonable amount as Parent or the Surviving Corporation, as
the case may be, may direct as indemnity against any action that may be made
against it with respect to such Certificate, the Paying Agent shall issue, in
exchange for such lost, stolen or destroyed Certificate, the Merger
Consideration to be paid in respect of the Shares represented by such
Certificates as contemplated by this _ARTICLE II_.

 

(c) _Transfer Books; No Further Ownership Rights in Company Common Stock_. At
the Effective Time, the stock transfer books of the Company shall be closed
and thereafter there shall be no further registration of transfers of shares
of Company Common Stock on the records of the Company. From and after the
Effective Time, the holders of Certificates evidencing ownership of shares of
Company Common Stock outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time shall
cease to have any rights with respect to such Shares, except as otherwise
provided for herein or by applicable law. If, after the Effective Time,
Certificates are presented to the Surviving Corporation for any reason, they
shall be canceled and exchanged for Merger Consideration in the proper amount
of cash as provided in this _ARTICLE II_.

 

(d) _Return of Funds; No Liability_. At any time following 270 calendar days
after the Effective Time, each of Parent and the Surviving Corporation shall
be entitled to require the Paying Agent to deliver to it any funds (including
any interest received with respect thereto) which had been deposited with the
Paying Agent and which have not been disbursed to holders of Certificates or
holders of Company Stock Rights described in _Section 2.4_, and thereafter
such holders of Certificates or Company Stock Rights shall be entitled to look
only to Parent or the Surviving Corporation (subject to abandoned property,
escheat or other similar laws) as general creditors thereof with respect to
the payment of any Merger Consideration that may be payable upon surrender of
any Certificates such holder holds, or the Stock Right Termination
Consideration (as defined in _Section 2.4(a)_) with respect to payments to
holders of Company Stock Rights to be made under _Section 2.4_, all as
determined pursuant to this Agreement (and, in the case of the Stock Right
Termination Consideration, pursuant to the terms

 



6  of the applicable Company Stock-Based Plan (as defined in _Section
2.4(a)_)), without any interest thereon. Notwithstanding the foregoing, none
of Parent, the Surviving Corporation, or the Paying Agent shall be liable to
any holder of a Certificate for the Merger Consideration or to any holder of a
Company Stock Right for the Stock Right Termination Consideration, delivered

is required to deduct and withhold with respect to the making of such payment
under the Code (as defined in _Section 3.16_) or any provision of state,
local or foreign tax law. To the extent amounts are so withheld by Parent,

Section 2.3  _Appraisal Rights_.

(a) In accordance with Section 262 of the DGCL (the " _DGCL Appraisal

Common Stock held of record by Persons who, prior to the Special Meeting, have
objected to the Merger and complied with all applicable provisions of the
DGCL Appraisal Rights Provisions necessary to perfect and maintain their
appraisal rights thereunder (any such shares of Company Common Stock, "
_Dissenting Shares_ ") shall not be converted as of the Effective Time into a
right to receive the Merger Consideration, but instead shall entitle the
holder of such shares of Company Common Stock to such rights as may be
available under the DGCL Appraisal Rights Provisions; _provided_ ,  _however_
, that if after the Effective Time such holder fails to perfect or withdraws
or otherwise loses its rights under the DGCL Appraisal Rights Provisions, the
shares of Company Common Stock owned by such holder immediately prior to
the Effective Time shall be treated as if they had been converted as of the
Effective Time into the right to receive the Merger Consideration, without
interest.

(c) Prior to the Effective Time, the Company shall give Parent prompt notice
of its receipt of each notification from a stockholder of the Company stating
such stockholders intent to demand payment for his or her shares if the
Merger is effectuated, and Parent shall have the right to participate in all
negotiations and proceedings with respect to such demands. Prior to the
Effective Time, the Company shall not, except with the prior written consent

After the Effective Time, Parent shall pay, or shall cause the Surviving
Corporation to pay, any amounts that may become payable in respect of

"), or under any separate agreement (each, a " _Company Stock Right_ "), shall
fully and immediately vest in accordance with the terms of the applicable
Company Stock-Based Plan, by virtue of the Merger and without the need of any
action on the part of any holder thereof. As of the Effective Time, each
Company Stock Right, whether or not vested, shall be converted into and shall
entitle the holder thereof to a right to receive an amount in cash equal to
the product of (i) excess, if any, of (x) the Merger Consideration over (y)
the exercise price, strike price or (in the case of stock
appreciation rights) base price, as the case may be, of the Company Stock
Right, multiplied by (ii) the number of shares of Company Common Stock subject

Time without the payment of any consideration therefor and shall have no
further force or effect. All payments made with respect to such Company Stock
Rights shall be made by the Paying Agent (or such other agent reasonably
acceptable to the Company as the Parent shall designate prior to the Effective
Time) as promptly after the Effective Time from funds deposited by or at the
direction of the Surviving Corporation to pay such amounts in accordance with

Rights shall have no further rights with respect thereto other than to
receive the Stock Right Termination Consideration, if any, as provided herein.

(b) _Company Restricted Shares_. Each outstanding share of restricted stock
awarded under the Company Stock-Based Plans or under any separate agreement
(each, a " _Company Restricted Share_ ") that is outstanding immediately prior
to the Effective Time shall vest and become free of restrictions as of the
Effective Time and be converted into the right to receive an amount in cash
equal to the Merger Consideration, subject to the applicable provisions of
_Section 2.2_. All payments with respect to such Company Restricted Shares
shall be made by the Paying Agent (or such other agent reasonably acceptable
to the Company as Parent shall designate prior to the Effective Time) as
promptly as reasonably practicable after the Effective Time in accordance
with _Section 2.2_.

1995 Employee Stock Purchase Plan, Amended and Restated 1995 Employee Stock

employee payroll withholding amounts credited to participants accounts
thereunder as of such time shall be refunded to the participants in accordance
with the terms of such plans by the Surviving Corporation on or as soon as

Agreement and any applicable Employee Stock Purchase Plan, the Effective Time
shall be treated as the last day of any then effective offering period under
any applicable Employee Stock Purchase Plan and the number of shares of the
Companys Stock subject to outstanding Company Stock Rights granted and

of shares which could be purchased the amounts with the accumulated employee

accounting fees) to effectuate the actions contemplated by this _Section
2.4_, including without limitation to effectuate the vesting of the Company
Stock Rights and Company Restricted Shares and the termination of the Company
Stock-Based Plans, in each case of the Effective Time, without paying any
material consideration or incurring any material debts or obligations on
behalf of the Company or the Surviving Corporation.

Company Stock-Based Plans, as promptly as practicable after the Effective
Time, but in no event more than ten (10) days thereafter, Parent shall cause
the Paying Agent to mail to each holder of record of a Company Stock Right:

 

(i) a letter of transmittal, which (A) shall specify that such Company Stock
Right has been terminated, effective as of the Effective Time, in
consideration of the Surviving Corporations obligation to make the cash
payments described in this _Section 2.4_, (B) shall contain representations
and warranties by the applicable holder that he or she is the sole record and
beneficial owner of all right, title, and interest in and to such Company
Stock Right (and has no right, title or interest to any other Company Stock
Rights), and (C) shall contain a release of all claims against the Company,
the Surviving Corporation, Parent and their respective Subsidiaries and
Affiliates with respect to all such Company Stock Rights); and

(ii) instructions for claiming the Stock Right Termination Consideration.

authority to own or lease all of its properties and assets and to carry on its
business as it is now being conducted. Each of the Company and each of
its Subsidiaries is duly licensed or qualified to do business in each
jurisdiction in which the nature of the business conducted by it or the
character or location of the properties and assets owned or leased by it makes
such licensing or qualification necessary, except where the failure to be so
licensed or qualified would not reasonably be expected to have, individually
or in the aggregate, a Material Adverse Effect (as defined below) on the
Company (a " _Company Material Adverse Effect_ "). The copies of the Company
Charter attached in _Section 3.1(a)_ of the Companys disclosure schedule
delivered to Parent concurrently with the execution of this Agreement (the "
_Company Disclosure Schedule_ ") and the by-laws of the Company (the "
_Company By-laws_ ") as most recently filed with the Companys SEC Documents
(as defined in _Section 3.5(a)_), are true, complete and correct copies of
such documents as in effect as of the date of this Agreement. _Section
3.1(a) of the Company Disclosure Schedule_ lists the full legal name,
jurisdiction of incorporation or organization, and tax identification number
of each Subsidiary, and each jurisdiction in which the Company or any
Subsidiary is qualified to do business.

As used in this Agreement, the term " _Material Adverse Effect_ " means any
state of facts, change, development, effect, event, occurrence, or condition
that, directly or indirectly, is materially adverse to, or would reasonably be
expected to have a materially adverse effect on, (i) the business, results of
operations, properties, assets, liabilities, or financial condition of the
Company and its Subsidiaries taken as a whole or Parent and its Subsidiaries
taken as a whole, as applicable, or (ii) a partys or parties ability to
consummate the transactions contemplated hereby within the timeframes
contemplated by this Agreement; in each case, when used with reference to the
Company and/or its Subsidiaries, other than any state of facts,
change, development, event, occurrence, or condition relating to or arising
in connection with (i) changes, developments, or events affecting the tests
and measurements equipment industry in general, to the extent that they do not
materially disproportionately affect the Company and its Subsidiaries, taken
as a whole, in relation to other companies in the tests and measurements
equipment industry, (ii) the economy in general, or financial or capital
markets in general, in the United States and/or elsewhere in the world, to
the extent that they do not materially disproportionately affect the Company
and its Subsidiaries, taken as a whole, in relation to other companies in the
tests and measurements equipment industry, (iii) changes (after the date of
this Agreement) in laws or in GAAP or in accounting standards (including the
impact thereof on financial statements as at or for a period ending on a date
prior to or after the date of this Agreement), (iv) the announcement or
pendency of this Agreement or the transactions hereby

 



10  contemplated or the anticipated consummation of such transactions, or the
taking of any actions or omission to take any action, which action or omission
is required pursuant to this Agreement or undertaken pursuant to the written
request of the Parent or Merger Sub, (v) any change in global, national, or
regional political conditions or any act of war, sabotage, or terrorism, or
any escalation or worsening of any such act of war, sabotage or terrorism
threatened or underway as of the date of this Agreement to the extent that
they do not materially disproportionately affect the Company and its
Subsidiaries, taken as a whole, in relation to other companies in the tests
and measurements equipment industry, (vi) earthquakes, hurricanes, tornados
or other natural disasters to the extent that they do not materially
disproportionately affect the Company and its Subsidiaries, taken as a whole,
in relation to other companies in the tests and measurements equipment
industry, or (vii) any changes in the market prices or trading volumes of the
Shares or any failure to meet publicly announced or internal financial
projections (it being understood that, subject to and without limiting the
applicability of the provisions contained in clauses (i) through (vii) above,
the cause or causes of any such decline, change, or failure may be deemed to
constitute, in and of itself and themselves, a Material Adverse Effect and
may be taken into consideration when determining whether a Material Adverse
Effect has occurred). References in certain sections of this Agreement to
dollar amounts are not intended to be, and shall not be deemed to
be, illustrative or interpretative for purposes of determining whether a
"Material Adverse Effect" has occurred.

of the SEC promulgated thereunder with respect to the SEC Documents filed
since such certifications have been required and such filings were true and

such determination.

(d) No condition exists that is reasonably likely to subject the Company or
any of its Subsidiaries to any direct or indirect liability under Title IV of

of Section 406 or Section 407 of ERISA or Section 4975 of the Code with
respect to any of the Company Benefit Plans that could reasonably expected to
result in any material liability for the Company or any Subsidiary related to
any excise Taxes under the Code or to any liabilities under ERISA.

 

(h) Except as would not reasonably expected to result in a Company Material
Adverse Effect, each Company Benefit Plan has been maintained and
administered in compliance with its terms and with the requirements prescribed

Plan or to the Company or any Subsidiary as a sponsor, a plan administrator
or a fiduciary of such Company Benefit Plan.

(i) Except as set forth in _Section 3.11(i) of the Company Disclosure
Schedule_ or as a result of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement,
neither the requisite corporate or stockholder approval of, nor the
consummation of, the transactions contemplated by this Agreement will (either

employment) entitle any current or former officer, employee, director or other
independent contractor of the Company or a Subsidiary to any change in
control payment or benefit, transaction bonus or similar benefit or severance
pay or accelerate the time of payment or vesting or trigger any payment or
funding (through a grantor trust or otherwise) of compensation or benefits
under, increase the amount payable or trigger any other material obligation

Subsidiary, other than any such amounts arising as a result of the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement.

comply with applicable insurance laws.

(k) All material contributions and other material payments due from the
Company or any Subsidiary with respect to each Company Benefit Plan have been
made or paid in full, and all of the assets which have been set aside in a
trust, escrow account or insurance 

 



22  company separate account to satisfy any obligations under any Company
Benefit Plan are shown on the books and records of each such trust or account
at their current fair market value as of the most recent valuation date for
such trust or account.

(l) There are no pending or, to the Companys Knowledge, threatened claims
with respect to a Company Benefit Plan (other than routine claims for

termination of employment of any current or former officer, employee or
independent contractor of the Company or a Subsidiary, which claims would
reasonably be expected to result in a Company Material Adverse Effect, and no
audit or investigation by any domestic or foreign governmental or other law
enforcement agency is pending or, to the Knowledge of the Company, has been
threatened with respect to any Company Benefit Plan.

(m) Except as set forth on  _Section 3.11(m) of the Company Disclosure
Schedule_, neither the Company nor any of its Subsidiaries sponsors,
maintains, contributes to (or is obligated to contribute to) any Company
Benefit Plan that is primarily subject to the laws of any jurisdiction
outside of the United States (each such plan, a " _Foreign Plan_ "). Except as
would not reasonably be expected to result in a Company Material Adverse
Effect, each Foreign Plan has been administered in all material respects in
accordance with its terms and applicable legal requirements of each
jurisdiction in which such Foreign Plan is maintained. All material
contributions to, and material payments from, such Foreign Plan which may have
been required to be made in accordance with the terms of such Foreign Plan,
and, when applicable, the legal requirements of the jurisdiction in which such
Foreign Plan is maintained, have been timely made or shall be made by the
Closing Date. Each Foreign Plan has obtained from the Governmental Entity
having jurisdiction with respect to such Foreign Plan any required
determinations, if any, that such Foreign Plan is in compliance with the legal
requirements of the relevant jurisdiction if such determinations are required
in order to give effect to such Foreign Plan. No such Foreign Plan promises or
provides retiree medical or other retiree welfare benefits to any person other
than as required by applicable law or as would not result in a
material liability to the Company or any Subsidiary. No Foreign Plan has
material unfunded liabilities that will not be offset by insurance or that are
not fully accrued on the SEC Financial Statements to the extent required by
GAAP.

 

(n) Each Company Benefit Plan that is a "nonqualified deferred compensation
plan" (as defined in Section 409A(d)(1) of the Code), including each award

(o) Neither the Company nor any of its Subsidiaries has undertaken to create
any additional plan, agreement or arrangement which, once established, would
constitute a

 



23  Company Benefit Plan, or to modify or change in any material way any
existing Company Benefit Plan. No event, condition or circumstance exists that
would prevent the amendment or termination of any Company Benefit Plan other
than the satisfaction of any applicable legal requirements, including the
giving of notice, and any such termination would not result in any cost or
other liability other than routine administrative costs and liability for
benefits accrued through termination.

environmental statute, regulation or ordinance, including the Comprehensive

and to compliance with _Sections 5.2(a)_ , _5.2(c)_ and _5.2(d)_ (xx) withdraw
or modify its approval, determination of advisability, or recommendation of
this Agreement, the Merger, and the other transactions contemplated hereby or

_however_ , that any actions described in clause (xx) or (yy) may be taken
only if the conditions of _Section 5.2(c)_ are also met.

in either _Section 5.2(b)(xx)_ or _Section 5.2(b)(yy)_ with respect to such
Superior Proposal, such notice also specifying the material terms and
conditions of such Superior Proposal and identifying the Person making such
Superior Proposal (unless identifying the Person would violate an obligation
of confidentiality), and (ii) the Parent does not provide within five (5)
Business Days of receipt of the written notice from the Company of such
Superior Proposal an offer that the Company Board determines in good faith,
after consultation with its outside counsel and financial advisor, is at least

the event Parents offer (as described in the preceding sentence) is
determined by the Company to be at least as favorable from a financial point
of view to the Companys stockholders, then this Agreement shall be deemed to
be amended in accordance with the terms of that offer, Company shall terminate
such other discussions, and (subject to the terms and conditions of this

Proposal, including a Superior Proposal (iv) the material terms and conditions

or any Takeover Proposal, (v) the identity of the Person making such request

or more of any class of equity securities of the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries, any tender offer or exchange offer that if consummated
would result in any Person beneficially owning 20% or more of any class of

liquidation, dissolution or similar transaction involving the Company or any
of its Subsidiaries, in each case other than the transactions contemplated by

recapitalization, liquidation, dissolution or

 



46  similar transaction involving the Company or any of its Subsidiaries, in
each case other than the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, which
provides for consideration on a per share basis to the stockholders of the
Company with a value (it being understood that securities retained by the
Companys stockholders be included for purposes of that determination) that
the Board of Directors of the Company determines in good faith (after
consultation with its outside counsel and financial advisor and taking into
account all relevant factors, including all legal, financial, regulatory and
other aspects of such Takeover Proposal and the Person making such
Takeover Proposal) to be more favorable from a financial point of view to the
Companys stockholders than the Merger Consideration; _provided_ , _however_ ,

unless (A) there is no financing contingency and any financing required to
consummate the transaction contemplated by such proposal is committed at least
to the same extent as the financing arranged by Parent, (B) there is no due
diligence condition to the third partys obligation to consummate the
transactions that are the subject of such proposal; (C) the transactions
contemplated by such Takeover Proposal are reasonably capable of being
completed in accordance with their terms without undue delay; and (D) the
Board of Directors of the Company has determined in its good faith judgment
(after consultation with its outside counsel) that failure to take such action
would be inconsistent with their fiduciary duties under applicable law. Any
Superior Proposal is a Takeover Proposal.

Change of Recommendation, take any action to change the approval of the Board
of Directors of the Company for purposes of causing any state takeover statute
or other state law to be applicable to the transactions contemplated hereby.

execution of this Agreement shall be a joint press release reasonably

all actions, and to do, or cause to be done, all things necessary, proper or
advisable to consummate and make effective, as soon as practicable after the

Section 5.7 _Indemnification; Directors  and Officers Insurance_.

(a) From and after the Effective Time until the sixth anniversary of
the Effective Time, Parent shall indemnify, advance expenses to, and hold
harmless the present and former officers and directors of the Company and its
Subsidiaries (each, an "Indemnified Party"), in each case to the fullest
extent permitted by law, in respect of acts or omissions occurring or alleged
to have occurred prior to or after the Effective Time. From and after the
Effective Time, Parent shall cause the certificate of incorporation and by-
laws of the Surviving Corporation to contain provisions substantially similar
in terms to the rights granted in the provisions with respect to
indemnification and insurance set forth in the Company Charter and the Company
By-laws in effect on the date hereof, which provisions shall not be amended
in any manner that would materially and adversely affect the rights thereunder
of the Companys employees, agents, directors or officers for acts or
omissions occurring on or prior to the Effective Time, except if such
amendment is required by applicable law. Any determination required to be
made with respect to whether an officers or directors conduct complies with
the standards set forth in the Company Charter or the Company By-laws shall be
made by independent counsel selected by Parent and reasonably acceptable to
such officer or director. Parent shall pay such reasonable counsels fees and
expenses. With respect to acts or omissions occurring on or prior to the
Effective Time, the Company may on or prior to the Effective Time purchase
(and if it does not, at or after the Effective Time the Parent shall purchase
or cause the Surviving Corporation to purchase) a tail, run-off or similar
directors and officers liability insurance coverage policy for a period of
six (6) years, with the same or similar coverages as are currently in effect
for the Company, at no cost to the beneficiaries thereof; _provided_ that (i)
the total premiums to be paid for such policy shall not exceed 200% of the
aggregate annual premium most recently paid by the Company prior to the date
hereof to maintain directors and officers liability insurance coverage (and
if the total premium of such insurance coverage 

 



49  exceeds such amount, the Company, Parent or the Surviving Corporation shall
obtain a tail policy with the greatest coverage available for a cost not
exceeding such amount) and (ii) prior to the Effective Time, the Company
shall not enter into any insurance contract for a "tail" policy without the
prior written consent of Parent which shall not be unreasonably withheld,
conditioned or delayed.

 

(b) In the event the Surviving Corporation or any of its successors or assigns
(i) consolidates with or merges into any other Person and shall not be the
continuing or surviving corporation or entity of such consolidation or merger
or (ii) transfers all or substantially all of its properties and assets to any
Person, then, and in each such case, proper provisions shall be made so that
the successors and assigns of the Surviving Corporation shall assume its
obligations set forth in this _Section 5.7_.

Employees_ ") for service with the Company prior to the Effective Time,
_provided_ that except in the case of severance or vacation accrual, such
crediting of service shall be solely for purposes of eligibility and vesting
under such plans and not for purposes of benefit accrual, and _provided
further_ that such crediting is permitted under applicable law and pursuant to
the terms of the Teledyne Technologies Incorporated Employee Stock Purchase
Plan (the Stock Advantage Plan) and does not result in duplication of
benefits. Parent shall, and shall cause the Surviving Corporation to, honor in
accordance with their terms all Company Benefit Plans that are in effect
as of the Effective Time; _provided_ , _however_ , that Parent may, or may
cause the Surviving Corporation to, amend, modify or terminate any individual
Company Benefit Plan in accordance with its terms and applicable law. Parent
shall cause Surviving Corporation to timely pay all performance or other
bonuses earned based on performance or service in periods ending on or prior
to December 31, 2012, (i) in accordance with the respective terms of the
applicable Company Benefit Plan as in effect as of and the awards granted
thereunder as of the Closing Date; (ii) to the extent not already paid as of
the Closing Date; (iii) in amounts as disclosed to Parent prior to the Closing
Date; and (iv) so long as the metrics for the first half of fiscal year 2013
Consolidated Operating Plan is substantially similar to the Consolidated
Operating Plan for the second half of fiscal year 2012.

(b) Prior to the Closing, the Company shall take the necessary action to
terminate its 401(k) plan effective as of the Closing Date. Upon request of an
employee of the Company and to the extent permitted by the Companys 401(k)
plan and applicable law, Parent shall permit the direct rollover of cash
account balances and any notes evidencing an outstanding plan loan or loans to
the Parents 401(k) plan. The Company further agrees, upon Parents request
(which request shall be made no less than ten (10) days prior the Effective
Time), to take any and all actions required (including the adoption of
resolutions by its Board of Directors) to amend, freeze and/or terminate any
or all Company Benefit Plans immediately before but contingent upon the
Effective Time.

 



50 (c) Notwithstanding the foregoing, nothing contained in this Agreement shall
(i) be treated as an amendment of any particular Company Benefit Plan, (ii)
give any third party any right to enforce the provisions of this _Section
5.8_, (iii) limit the right of Parent or any of its Subsidiaries to terminate
the employment of any Company Employee at any time, or, except as
specifically provided in _Section 5.8(a)_ above, (iv) require Parent or any
of its Subsidiaries to provide any particular employee benefits, rates of base
salary or hourly wage or annual bonus opportunities for any period following

Company Benefit Plan.

Company has such information readily available or can obtain it without undue
effort or expense.

satisfactory to Parent for RBS to deliver all related Lien releases to Parent
upon the payoff of all such Indebtedness.

 

Section 5.11 _Tax Efficiency_. The Company shall, and shall cause its

efficient manner to Parent and Merger Sub.

Section 5.12 _Additional Agreements_. In case at any time after the Effective
Time any further action is necessary or desirable to carry out the purposes

respect thereof; and _provided further_ , that the Termination Fee and any
reimbursement of expenses due pursuant to _Section 7.3(b)_ hereto, if paid,

relinquish in exchange for the right to receive the Termination Fee and any

consent of the other parties hereto, except that the Merger Sub may assign, in
its sole discretion, any or all of its rights, interests and

any provisions of this Agreement.

(j) Any reference herein to any contract, agreement, or other obligation being
in full force and effect, valid, binding, and/or enforceable, or to similar

such representation or warranty or otherwise) as being qualified by
such information, or (ii) with respect to which the relevance of such
information is reasonably apparent.

Section 8.11  _Enforcement; Venue_.

(a) The parties hereto agree that irreparable damage would occur in the event
that any of the provisions of this Agreement were not performed in accordance

the United States District Court located in the State of Delaware or (ii) of
the State of New York located in the Borough of Manhattan in the City and
State of New York or of the United States located in the Southern District of
New York. The jurisdiction of the foregoing courts shall be exclusive in the
event any dispute arises out of this Agreement or any of the

 



60  transactions contemplated by this Agreement, and no party hereto will
attempt to deny or defeat personal jurisdiction or venue in any such court by
motion or other request for leave from any such court. Each party hereto
irrevocably consents to the service of process outside the territorial
jurisdiction of the courts referred to in this section in any such action or
proceeding by mailing copies thereof by registered United States mail, return
receipt requested, to its address as specified in _Section 8.4_. However, the
foregoing shall not limit the right of a party hereto to effect service of
process by any other legally available method.

ARISE UNDER THIS AGREEMENT IS LIKELY TO INVOLVE COMPLICATED AND DIFFICULT
ISSUES, AND THEREFORE EACH SUCH PARTY HERETO HEREBY IRREVOCABLY AND
UNCONDITIONALLY WAIVES ANY RIGHT SUCH PARTY MAY HAVE TO A TRIAL BY JURY IN
RESPECT OF ANY LITIGATION DIRECTLY OR INDIRECTLY ARISING OUT OF OR RELATING TO
THIS AGREEMENT, OR THE TRANSACTIONS CONTEMPLATED BY THIS AGREEMENT. Each
party hereto certifies and acknowledges that (i) no representative, agent or

enforce the foregoing waiver, (ii) each party hereto understands and has
considered the implications of this waiver, (iii) each party hereto makes this
