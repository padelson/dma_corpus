"Merger Agreement"), on August 13, 2013 Ameristar became a wholly-owned
Subsidiary of Parent through a merger of PNK Holdings, Inc. with and into

with Parent being the surviving entity;

WHEREAS, the United States Federal Trade Commission (the "FTC") has issued an

WHEREAS, in connection with the Merger, Parent has entered into an agreement
containing consent orders (the "Consent Agreement") and is required to comply
with the Decision and Order accepted by the FTC (Docket No.9355) (the "Order")

1 WHEREAS, Buyer desires to acquire from Sellers and Sellers desire to sell to
Buyer, all of Sellers' right, title and interest in and to the issued and
outstanding Equity Interests on the terms and subject to the conditions set
forth herein, after which the Companies shall become wholly-owned subsidiaries
of Buyer; and

WHEREAS, concurrently with the execution of this Agreement, and as a condition
and inducement to Sellers' willingness to enter into this Agreement, Tropicana
Entertainment Inc. ("Tropicana") is entering into a limited guarantee in favor
of Sellers with respect to certain obligations of Buyer hereunder (the
"Limited Guarantee") and Tropicana Entertainment Inc. and Sellers are entering
into a letter agreement providing for certain obligations of Tropicana in
contemplation of the Section 338(h)(10) Election (the "338(h)(10) Letter");

NOW, THEREFORE, the parties hereto, in consideration of the premises and of
the mutual representations, warranties and covenants contained herein and for
other good and valuable consideration, the receipt and sufficiency of which
are hereby acknowledged, agree as follows:

ARTICLE 1

PURCHASE AND SALE OF EQUITY INTERESTS



Section 1.1 Purchase and Sale of Equity Interests. Upon the terms and subject
to the conditions set forth in this Agreement, at the Closing, Holdco shall
sell to Buyer, and Buyer shall purchase from Holdco the Target Stock, and
Parent shall sell to Buyer, and Buyer shall purchase from Parent, the
Membership Interests, in each case free and clear of all Liens (other than
restrictions to which Buyer may be subject under applicable securities Laws
and Gaming Laws).

Section 1.2 Excluded Assets. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary
contained in this Agreement, from and after the Closing, Sellers shall retain
all of their right, title and interest in and to each and all of the assets
set forth on Schedule A (collectively, the "Excluded Assets"), which Excluded
Assets are not a part of the transactions contemplated hereby, whether or not
any such Excluded Asset is presently owned by the Companies. Sellers and Buyer
may amend Schedule A as necessary to include any specific items owned by
Sellers which are not owned by the Companies but which were inadvertently
omitted from said Schedule. Prior to the Closing Date, Sellers shall cause the
Companies to assign to Sellers or an Affiliate designated by Parent, all
right, title and interest of the Companies (if any) in such Excluded Assets.
All items, whether located at the Companies' Real Property, or otherwise owned
by the Companies, that constitute Excluded Assets, may be removed on or prior
to the Closing Date or within one hundred twenty (120) days after the Closing
Date by Sellers; provided that such removal shall be done upon reasonable
notice at prearranged times during normal business hours so as not to
unreasonably disrupt the Companies' operations or customers; provided further
that if Buyer or any Company so requests, Sellers' Representatives shall be
accompanied by a Representative of Buyer during the course of such removal.
Sellers acknowledge and agree that all liability and loss associated with the
Excluded Assets and their removal shall be borne exclusively by Sellers.

Section 1.3 Retention of Assets. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary
contained in this Agreement, Sellers and their respective Affiliates may
retain and use, at their own expense, archival copies of all of the Contracts,
books, records and other documents or materials of the

| | 

2844184.4 01

|

2 Companies (except to the extent prohibited by Section 8.15), in each case,
which (a) are in existence on or prior to the Closing, (b) are used in
connection with Sellers or any of their respective Affiliates' businesses
other than the Companies (except to the extent prohibited by the FTC
Documents), or (c) if Parent, in good faith, determines that it or any of its
Affiliates is reasonably likely to need access to, in connection with the
preparation or filing of any Tax Returns or compliance with any other Tax
reporting obligations or other obligation under applicable Law, or the defense
(or any counterclaim, cross-claim or similar claim in connection therewith) or
prosecution of any suit, claim, action, proceeding or investigation (including
any Tax audit or examination) against or by Parent or any of Parent's
Affiliates that relates to any periods on or prior to the Closing Date. Buyer
understands and agrees that it is solely Buyer's responsibility to obtain any
and all operating agreements necessary to conduct the Business from and after
the Closing Date, including replacement software license agreements for the
software that will replace the Excluded Software. Subject to the terms hereof,
Buyer shall also be responsible for obtaining new licenses and permits for the
operation of the Business from and after the Closing to the extent such
licenses and permits of the Companies are not transferable with the transfer
of the Equity Interests.

ARTICLE 2 
PURCHASE PRICE AND DEPOSIT

Section 2.1 Purchase Price.

(a) At the Closing, as consideration for the Equity Interests, Buyer shall
deliver or cause to be delivered to Parent (or its designee) by electronic
transfer of immediately available funds to an account designated by Sellers a
cash payment equal to the sum of (i) Two Hundred Sixty Million Dollars
($260,000,000.00) subject to adjustment as described in Section 2.1(b) below
(the "Purchase Price") plus (ii) the Estimated Closing Payment (which can be a
positive or negative number). The Purchase Price, together with the Estimated
Closing Payment, is the "Closing Payment."

(b) The Purchase Price shall be reduced by (i) the amount of any remaining
payment obligations of Sellers under Section 1 of that certain Seventh
Amendment to Redevelopment Agreement dated as of December 11, 2012 by and
between the LCRA and Parent as calculated at the Closing Date, and (ii) the
Capex Shortfall, if any.

Section 2.2 Deposit. No later than five (5) Business Days after the Effective
Date, Buyer shall deposit Fifteen Million Dollars ($15,000,000.00) (the
"Deposit") with Citibank N.A. (the "Escrow Agent") pursuant to an escrow
agreement in substantially the form attached hereto as Exhibit A (the "Deposit
Escrow Agreement") to be executed and delivered by Parent, Buyer and the
Escrow Agent in connection with the making of the Deposit. Upon the Closing,
the Deposit, plus the interest accrued thereon, shall be credited against the
Purchase Price, and the parties shall instruct the Escrow Agent to promptly
release and pay the Deposit, plus the interest accrued thereon, to Sellers (or
their designee) pursuant to the terms of the Deposit Escrow Agreement. Upon
the termination of this Agreement, the parties shall instruct the Escrow Agent
to promptly release and pay the Deposit, plus the interest accrued thereon, to
Buyer or Parent, as applicable, pursuant to Section 10.2(c) hereof and the
terms of the Deposit Escrow Agreement. In the event of any inconsistency
between the terms and provisions of the Deposit Escrow Agreement and the terms


 

--- 
| | 

2844184.4 01

|

3 and provisions of this Agreement, the terms and provisions of this Agreement
shall control, absent an express written agreement between the parties hereto
to the contrary, which written agreement acknowledges and expressly amends
this Section 2.1(b). All fees of the Escrow Agent shall be borne one-half by
Sellers and one-half by Buyer.

Section 2.3 Allocation of Purchase Price and Section 338(h)(10) Election.

(a) Election. Buyer (or, if Buyer is a disregarded entity for U.S. federal
income tax purposes, Buyer's immediate corporate parent) shall join with the
Companies and Sellers in making a timely election under Section 338(h)(10) of
the Code (and any corresponding election under state, local, and foreign Law)
with respect to the purchase and sale of the Target Stock hereunder
(collectively, a "Section 338(h)(10) Election"). Buyer (or, if Buyer is a
disregarded entity for U.S. federal income tax purposes, Buyer's immediate
corporate parent) and Sellers, as appropriate, shall execute a properly
prepared IRS Form 8023 at the Closing to make the Section 338(h)(10) Election.
In addition, Sellers and the Companies hereby agree to make a protective
election under Section 336(e) of the Code in compliance with Section
1.336-2(h) of the Treasury Regulations.

(b) Allocation of Purchase Price. For federal income Tax and applicable state
and local Tax purposes, Buyer and Parent hereby agree to treat (and to cause
their respective Affiliates to treat) the purchase and sale of the Membership
Interests pursuant to this Agreement as a sale of the Purchased Assets held by
ES, RE and, if the transaction structure is modified pursuant to Section 8.23
to involve the direct sale of the STLH Equity Interests to Buyer, STLH. No
more than ninety (90) days after the Determination Date, Buyer shall prepare
and deliver to Sellers a written statement setting forth (i) the allocation of
the purchase price (as determined for federal income Tax purposes, taking into
account any additional amounts payable pursuant to Section 3.2) among the
Target Stock and the Membership Interests, (ii) the allocation of the purchase
price from clause (i) allocated to the Membership Interests, plus any assumed
liabilities of ES, RE and, if the transaction structure is modified pursuant
to Section 8.23 to involve the direct sale of the STLH Equity Interests to
Buyer, STLH that are required to be treated as part of the purchase price for
federal income Tax purposes to the Purchased Assets (and any other assets that
are considered to be acquired for federal income Tax purposes) held by ES, RE
and, if the transaction structure is modified pursuant to Section 8.23 to
involve the direct sale of the STLH Equity Interests to Buyer, STLH in
accordance with Section 1060 of the Code and the Treasury Regulations
thereunder and (iii) the allocation of the purchase price from clause (i)
allocated to the Target Stock, plus any assumed liabilities of Target that are
required to be treated as part of the purchase price for federal income Tax
purposes to the Purchased Assets (and any other assets that are considered to
be acquired for federal income Tax purposes) held by Target in accordance with
Section 338(h)(10) (and, on a protective basis, Section 336(e)) of the Code
and the Treasury Regulations thereunder (the "Purchase Price Allocation").
Buyer and Sellers shall negotiate in good faith to agree on the Purchase Price
Allocation. If Buyer and Sellers have not agreed on the Purchase Price
Allocation within sixty (60) days following the Determination Date, then any
disputed matter(s) will be finally and conclusively resolved by a mutually
agreed upon national accounting firm (the "Tax Arbiter") in accordance with
this Agreement, as promptly as practicable, and such resolution(s) will be
reflected in the Purchase Price Allocation, provided that the resolution for
each disputed item contained in the Tax Arbiter's determination shall be made
subject to the definitions and principles set forth in this Agreement. Buyer
and Sellers shall each


 

--- 
| | 

2844184.4 01

|

4 use its commercially reasonable efforts to furnish to the Tax Arbiter such
work papers and other documents and information pertaining to the disputed
item as the Tax Arbiter may request. Sellers and Buyer shall bear their own
expenses in the preparation and review of the Purchase Price Allocation,
except that the fees and expenses of the Tax Arbiter shall be borne equally by
Buyer, on the one hand, and Sellers, on the other hand. Buyer, the Companies
and Sellers shall file all Tax Returns (including, but not limited to, IRS
Forms 8594 and 8883) consistent with the Purchase Price Allocation, and shall
not agree to any proposed adjustment to, or settlement with respect to, the
Purchase Price Allocation by any Governmental Entity without first giving the
other parties prior written notice and an opportunity to confer regarding such
adjustment; provided, however, that the Purchase Price Allocation shall be
adjusted by any other amounts paid under this Agreement following the
Determination Date that affect the purchase price for federal income Tax
purposes.

Section 2.4 Risk of Loss. Subject to Section 8.13 hereof, until the Closing,
Sellers shall bear the risk of any loss or damage to the Companies, including
the Purchased Assets and Excluded Assets, from condemnation, fire, casualty,
taking by eminent domain, or any other occurrence. Following the Closing,
Buyer shall bear the risk of any loss or damage to the Companies, including
the Purchased Assets, and excluding the Excluded Assets, from condemnation,
fire, casualty, taking by eminent domain, or any other occurrence.

Section 2.5 Tax Withholding. Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the
contrary, Buyer shall be entitled to deduct and withhold from any amounts
otherwise payable under this Agreement to Sellers or any other Person such
amounts as are required to be deducted or withheld under the Code, or any
provision of applicable Law with respect to the making of such payment. To the
extent that amounts are so deducted and withheld and paid over to the
applicable Governmental Entity, such deducted and withheld amounts shall be
treated for all purposes of this Agreement as having been paid to Sellers or
such other Person in respect of which such deduction and withholding were
made.

ARTICLE 3

WORKING CAPITAL ADJUSTMENT AND OTHER ADJUSTMENTS

Section 3.1 Estimated Closing Statement. No less than five (5) Business Days
prior to the Closing Date, Sellers shall prepare and deliver to Buyer a
written closing statement certified by the Chief Financial Officer of Parent
(the "Estimated Closing Statement") of the Estimated Closing Net Working
Capital, including the resulting Estimated Closing Net Working Capital Overage
(if any) or Estimated Closing Net Working Capital Shortage (if any), and
including a detailed classification of the various amounts of each component
of Net Working Capital, which Estimated Closing Statement shall be prepared in
good faith and on a basis consistent with the preparation of the Financial
Information and the calculation of Net Working Capital set forth on Schedule
B. Any amounts determined to be due and owing to Sellers pursuant to the

and deliver to Sellers a written statement (the "Final Closing Statement") of
the Final Closing Net Working Capital, including the resulting Final Closing
Net Working Capital Overage (if any) or Final Closing Net Working Capital

amounts of each component of Net Working Capital, which Final Closing
Statement shall be prepared in good faith and on a basis consistent with the
preparation of the Financial Information and the calculation of Net Working
Capital set forth on Schedule B. Any such amounts determined to be payable
pursuant to the Final Closing Statement shall be paid to either Sellers, on

(the "Final Closing Payment").

(b) If Sellers disagree with the calculation of any amounts on the Final
Closing Statement, Sellers shall, within twenty (20) Business Days after their
receipt of the Final Closing Statement, notify Buyer of such disagreement in
writing, setting forth in detail the particulars of such disagreement. Any
amounts on the Final Closing Statement not disputed in writing by Sellers

shall be final, binding and conclusive for purposes of this Agreement. Buyer
will provide Sellers reasonable access to any of Buyer's and the Companies'
records (including work papers and source documents) and relevant employees
not otherwise available to Sellers as a result of the transactions
contemplated hereby, to the extent reasonably related to Sellers' review of
the Final Closing Statement. If Sellers do not provide such notice of
disagreement within the twenty (20) Business Day period, Sellers shall be
deemed to have accepted the Final Closing Statement and the calculation of all
amounts set forth thereon, which shall be final, binding and conclusive for
purposes of this Agreement and not subject to any further recourse by Buyer,
Sellers or their respective Affiliates absent manifest error or fraud. If any
such notice of disagreement is timely provided, Buyer and Sellers shall use
commercially reasonable efforts for a period of twenty (20) Business Days (or
such longer period as they may mutually agree) to resolve any disagreements
with respect to the calculation of any amounts set forth on the Final Closing
Statement (and which were previously identified in writing by Sellers pursuant
to the first sentence of this Section 3.2(b)). If, at the end of such period,
the parties are unable to fully resolve the disagreements, the parties shall
refer the matter to BDO USA LLP (the "Auditor") to resolve any remaining
disagreements. The Auditor shall be instructed to (i) consider only such
matters as to which there is a disagreement, (ii) determine, as promptly as
practicable, whether the disputed amounts set forth on the Final Closing
Statement were prepared in accordance with the standards set forth in this
Agreement, and (iii) deliver, as promptly as practicable but in any event
within forty-five (45) days of the end of such 20-Business Day period (or such
longer period as the parties may have mutually agreed), to Sellers and Buyer
its determination in writing. The resolution for each disputed item contained
in the Auditor's determination shall be made subject to the definitions and
principles set forth in this Agreement, and shall be consistent with either
the position of Sellers or Buyer. Sellers and Buyer shall bear their own
expenses in the preparation and review of the Estimated Closing Statement and
Final Closing Statement, except that the fees and expenses of the Auditor
shall be paid one-half by Buyer

binding and conclusive for purposes of this Agreement and not subject to any
further recourse by Buyer, Sellers or their respective Affiliates, absent
manifest error or fraud by Buyer, Sellers or the Auditor. Any dispute with
respect to the Final Closing Statement will not affect any undisputed amounts
in the Final Closing Statement or the related payments contemplated by Section
3.2(c) hereof. The date on which an amount set forth on the Final Closing
Statement is finally determined in accordance with this Section 3.2(b) is
hereinafter referred to as the "Determination Date."

(c) Any amounts determined to be due and owing to Sellers from Buyer or to

Buyer or its Affiliates receive to the extent relating to any Accounts

creditor of such accounts payable to the extent such account payable relating
to the Business is owed by the other party. Should either party discover it
has paid an accounts payable belonging to the other party that is not included
in the Final Closing Net Working Capital, then Buyer or Sellers, as
applicable, shall provide written notice of such payment to the other party,
and the other party shall promptly reimburse the party that paid such accounts
payable all amounts listed on such notice.

(c) Customer Deposits. Customer Deposits received by the Companies relating to
rooms, services and/or events relating to the period from and after the

payable, or required to be provided, to any Property Employee, (ii) increase
the amount or value of any benefit or compensation otherwise payable or
required to be provided to any such Property Employee, (iii) result in the

including Laws concerning unfair labor practices within the meaning of Section
8 of the National Labor Relations Act, and the employment of non-residents
under the Immigration Reform and Control Act of 1986. All of the Companies'
employees are lawfully authorized to work in the United States in accordance
with applicable federal and state law, and none of the Companies' employees
are illegal aliens. There are no charges, governmental audits, investigations,
administrative proceedings or complaints concerning employment practices
pending or, to the knowledge of Sellers, threatened before any federal, state,
or local agency or court, except to the extent disclosed in Section 6.13(i) of
the Company Disclosure Letter, and, to the knowledge of Sellers, no basis for
any such matter exists. Each employee, independent contractor, and consultant
of any Company has been, and is, properly classified as such under applicable
law.

Section 6.14 Brokers. Except for the fees and commissions of Goldman Sachs
(which fees and commissions are the sole responsibility of Sellers), Sellers
have not employed and no Person has acted directly or indirectly as a broker,
financial advisor or finder for Sellers and Sellers have not incurred any
liability for any brokerage fees, commissions or finder's fees in connection
with the transactions contemplated by this Agreement.

Section 6.15 Title to Purchased Assets; Sufficiency of Purchased Assets. The
Companies have good and marketable title to, or a valid leasehold interest in,
the material tangible Personal Property constituting Purchased Assets, free
and clear of any Encumbrances or Liens other than for Permitted Encumbrances
and Permitted Liens. To Sellers' knowledge, all of the tangible Personal
Property constituting Purchased Assets, taken as a whole, are structurally
sound, are in good operating condition and, taken as a whole, such tangible
Personal Property constituting Purchased Assets is not in need of maintenance
or repairs except for ordinary, routine maintenance and repairs or except
where the failure to be so, in the aggregate, would not be reasonably likely
to have a Company Material Adverse Effect. The tangible Personal Property
constituting Purchased Assets currently owned or leased by any Company,
together with all other assets of the Companies constituting Purchased Assets,
the Excluded Assets, and any assets and services the benefit of which is to be
provided under the Transition Services Agreement, taken as a whole, are
sufficient in all material respects for the continued conduct of the Business
in substantially the same manner as currently conducted. The Purchased Assets
include all of the "Lumiere Assets," as defined in the Order.

Section 6.16 Minimum Cash. As of the Closing, the Business will have an amount
of House Funds at least equal to the minimum bankroll required by applicable
Gaming Laws, if any.

Section 6.17 Absence of Changes. From December 31, 2012 through the Effective
Date, the Business has been conducted in the Ordinary Course of Business, and
there has not been any event, occurrence, state of circumstances or facts or
change that has had or that would be reasonably likely, individually or in the
aggregate (x) to have a Company Material Adverse Effect or (y) to materially
impair or materially delay the Closing.

25 Section 6.18 Insurance. Section 6.18 of the Company Disclosure Letter sets
forth a true and complete list of all current insurance policies (specifying
each insured, the insurer, the amount of coverage, the type of insurance, the
policy number, the expiration date, the annual premium, and any pending claim
thereunder) maintained by any Seller or any of their respective Affiliates
(including the Companies) which insure the assets, business, operations,
employees, officers and directors of any Company. Sellers have made true and
complete copies of all such insurance policies available to Buyer. Such
insurance policies are in full force and effect and shall remain in full force
and effect following the consummation of the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement. To Sellers' knowledge, all premiums due on such insurance policies
have either been paid or, if due and payable prior to Closing, will be paid
prior to Closing in accordance with the payment terms of each insurance
policy. The insurance policies do not provide for any retrospective premium
adjustment or other experience-based liability on the part of any Company. The
insurance policies are of the type and in the amounts customarily carried by
Persons conducting a business similar to the Companies and are sufficient for
compliance in all material respects with all applicable Laws and Material
Contracts to which any Company is a party or by which any Company is bound.

Section 6.19 Hotel Agreements and Redevelopment Agreement. Each of the Hotel
Agreements and the Redevelopment Agreement is a valid and binding obligation
of the Company party thereto and, to the knowledge of Sellers, is a valid and
binding obligation of each other party thereto, and is in full force and
effect and enforceable by such Company in accordance with its terms, except as
such enforceability may be limited by (i) applicable bankruptcy, insolvency,
reorganization, moratorium or similar laws now or hereinafter in effect
affecting creditors' rights generally and (ii) general principles of equity.
There is no breach or violation of or default by any Company or, to Sellers'
knowledge, by any other party under any Hotel Agreement or the Redevelopment
Agreement nor have Sellers or the Companies received any written notice of any
default under any Hotel Agreement or the Redevelopment Agreement. Assuming
that Buyer is a "Qualified Person" as defined in the Hotel Management
Agreement and Buyer has executed and delivered the Four Seasons Agreement, the
execution and delivery by Sellers of this Agreement and the consummation of
the transactions contemplated hereby does not and will not result in any
violation or breach of any Hotel Agreement. Subject to any consent which may
be required from the LCRA, the execution and delivery by Sellers of this
Agreement and the consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby does
not and will not result in any violation or breach of the Redevelopment
Agreement. None of Sellers or any Company has received any written notice of
the intention of any Person to terminate, nor has there been any termination
of, any Hotel Agreement or the Redevelopment Agreement. Sellers have made
available to Buyer all material written notices and submissions, submitted or
delivered by or to any Company since January 1, 2010 pursuant to or in
connection with the Hotel Agreements and the Redevelopment Agreement. To
Sellers' knowledge, as of the Effective Date, the Four Seasons Hotel satisfies
the World Class Luxury Hotel standard (as defined in the Hotel Management
Agreement and the Hotel License Agreement), and the Casino satisfies the
design and maintenance standards of the Hotel Management Agreement. With
respect to the Redevelopment Agreement, (a) Parent has written acknowledgement
from the LCRA that its obligations under Section 3.12.1 of the Redevelopment
and with respect to the Essential Elements of the Project on Exhibit B to the
Redevelopment Agreement are satisfied, (b) with respect to Section 3.8, Parent
has satisfied the Required Expenditure requirements and has constructed a
luxury class, fully integrated mixed-use gaming facility and hotel
development,

26 including a "Four Seasons" branded hotel, (c) Parent has satisfied its
obligations to the LCRA with respect to the Hammond Apartments, L.P. required
under the Redevelopment Agreement, (d) Parent has completed the improvements
to the Ancillary Development Site under Section 3.12.3, and (e) Parent has
timely made all payments due under the Redevelopment Agreement during the
previous five (5) years.

the terms, conditions or provisions of any note, bond, mortgage, indenture,
lease, Contract or obligation to which Buyer is a party or by which Buyer or
any of its properties or assets may be bound, or (iii) subject to the

to (x) have a Buyer Material Adverse Effect or (y) materially impair or
materially delay the Closing.

(c) No consent, approval, finding of suitability, license, permit, waiver,
order or authorization of, or registration, declaration or filing with, any
Governmental Entity is required by or with respect to Buyer or its Affiliates

that are contemplated hereby, except for (i) any approvals and filing of
notices required under the Gaming Laws, (ii) approval by, or filing a notice

consents, approvals, findings of suitability, licenses, waivers, orders,
authorizations, permits, registrations and declarations as may be required
under the Laws of any jurisdiction in which Buyer conducts any business or
owns any assets, the failure of which to make or obtain would not,
individually or in the aggregate, be reasonably likely to (x) have a Buyer
Material Adverse Effect or (y) materially impair or materially delay the
Closing and (v) any consents, approvals, orders, authorizations,
registrations, permits, declaration or filings required by Sellers or the
Companies or any of their Subsidiaries, Affiliates or key employees (including

the Buyer Disclosure Letter, none of Tropicana, its Subsidiaries (including

|

28 finding of suitability by a Governmental Entity or Gaming Authority. Buyer and
each of the Buyer Related Parties are in good standing, and in material
compliance with all Gaming Laws, in each of the jurisdictions in which Buyer
or any Buyer Related Party owns or operates gaming facilities. To Buyer's
knowledge, as of the Effective Date, there are no facts, which if known to the
Gaming Authorities, would (a) be reasonably likely to result in the denial,
revocation, limitation or suspension of a gaming license currently held or
other Gaming Approval, or (b) result in a negative outcome to any finding of
suitability proceedings currently pending, or under the suitability,
licensing, permits, orders, authorizations or proceedings necessary for the
consummation of this Agreement.

Section 7.6 Permits; Compliance with Gaming Laws. Buyer, and to Buyer's
knowledge, each of the Buyer Related Parties, and its and their respective

similar to officers and partners, hold all permits, registrations, findings of
suitability, licenses, variances, exemptions, certificates of occupancy,
orders and approvals of all Governmental Entities (including all
authorizations under Gaming Laws) necessary to conduct the business and
operations of Buyer (the "Buyer Permits"), each of which is in full force and
effect, except for such Buyer Permits, the failure of which to hold would not,
individually or in the aggregate, be reasonably likely to (x) have a Buyer
Material Adverse Effect or (y) materially impair or materially delay the
Closing, and no event has occurred which permits, or upon the giving of notice
or passage of time or both would permit, revocation, non-renewal,
modification, suspension, limitation or termination of the Buyer Permits that
are currently in effect, the loss of which would, individually or in the
aggregate, be reasonably likely to (x) have a Buyer Material Adverse Effect or
(y) materially impair or materially delay the Closing. Buyer, and to Buyer's
knowledge, Buyer's directors, officers, key employees and Persons performing
management functions similar to officers and partners are, and since January
1, 2010 have been, in compliance with the terms of the Buyer Permits, except
for such failures to comply, as would not, individually or in the aggregate,
be reasonably likely to (x) have a Buyer Material Adverse Effect (y)
materially impair or materially delay the Closing. Buyer has not received
written notice of any investigation or review by any Governmental Entity with
respect to Buyer that is pending, and, to Buyer's knowledge, no investigation
or review is threatened, nor has any Governmental Entity indicated in writing
any intention to conduct the same, other than those the outcome of which would
not, individually or in the aggregate, be reasonably likely to (x) have a
Buyer Material Adverse Effect or (y) materially impair or materially delay the
Closing.

Section 7.7 Qualified Person. In Buyer's reasonable opinion, Buyer is a
"Qualified Person" as defined in the Hotel Management Agreement.

set forth in Article 9 hereof.

Section 7.9 Litigation. There are no actions, claims, suits or proceedings
pending or, to Buyer's knowledge, threatened against Buyer before any
Governmental Entity, that, individually

29 or in the aggregate, would be reasonably be likely to (x) have a Buyer
Material Adverse Effect or (y) materially impair or materially delay the
Closing.

Section 7.10 Status of Buyer. Buyer is a direct wholly-owned subsidiary of (a)
Tropicana, or (b) a direct or indirect wholly-owned corporate subsidiary of
Tropicana. Since its formation, Buyer has been a Delaware limited liability
company and either (x) prior to or as of the beginning of the Closing Date
will be wholly owned by a domestic U.S. corporation and also treated as a
disregarded entity for U.S. federal income tax purposes, or (y) on or before

(r) enter into a Contract to do any of the foregoing, or to authorize or

liabilities to such extent and at such times as Buyer and Buyer's
Representatives may reasonably request, including, without limitation, the
Internal Control System established by the Target under 11 CSF 45-9.010, et.
seq. (the "Internal Controls"); provided, however, that (x) such access does
not unreasonably disrupt the normal operations of the Companies and (y) the
Companies are under no obligation to disclose to Buyer any information the
disclosure of which is restricted by Contract, Law or is subject to attorney-
client privilege; provided, further, that, for the avoidance of doubt, such
access to the Companies shall include reasonable access (it being understood,
however, that such access does not include log-in access or access that would
violate applicable Gaming Laws) to, and cooperation from, any Company's
information technology systems and employees to permit Buyer to test the
information technology systems and to prepare any Company's information
technology systems for integration with those of Buyer, and prepare for the
implementation of Buyer's own systems, including the training of any of the
Companies' employees (which training shall be conducted by Buyer at its cost
and expense) and integration of the Internal Controls.

known to such party, that causes any representation, covenant or agreement of
Sellers or Buyer under this Agreement to be breached in any material respect
or that renders untrue in any material respect any representation or warranty
of Sellers or Buyer contained in this Agreement. No notice given pursuant to
this Section 8.2(b)

33 shall have any effect on the representations, warranties, covenants or
agreements contained in this Agreement for purposes of determining
satisfaction of any condition contained herein or the parties' rights to
indemnification hereunder. For the avoidance of doubt, no failure to give
notice required by this Section 8.2(b) with respect to a breach of any
representation or warranty by the party required to give such notice shall, in
and of itself, result in the subject matter of such representation or warranty
breach constituting a breach of a covenant of such party.

Section 8.3 No Solicitation. Prior to the earlier of the Closing and the
termination of this Agreement in accordance with Section 10.1 hereof, neither
Sellers, the Companies, nor any of their respective shareholders, members,
directors, officers, employees, advisors, agents or other representatives
(collectively, "Representatives"), directly or indirectly, through Affiliates
or otherwise, shall (a) solicit or initiate, or take any other action to
facilitate knowingly, including, without limitation, by entering into a non-
disclosure agreement with any person (or group of persons) other than Buyer or
its Affiliates (a "Third Party"), any inquiries or proposals that constitute,
or could reasonably be expected to lead to, a proposal or offer of any kind

Proposal, (b) engage in negotiations or discussions with any Third Party
concerning, or provide any non-public information to any person or entity

Acquisition Proposal.

Section 8.4 Employee Matters.

(a) Each Property Employee who is an employee of any Company as of the Closing
shall hereinafter be referred to as a "Transferred Employee". Each of the
Property Employees is an at-will employee, except that certain Property
Employees may be eligible for severance compensation upon certain termination
events under an employment agreement that covers any such Property Employee as
set forth on Section 6.13(a) of the Company Disclosure Letter.

(b) For a period of at least six (6) months immediately following the Closing
Date, (x) Buyer shall cause the Companies to provide the Transferred Employees
who remain employed by any of the Companies, Buyer or any Affiliate of Buyer
with base compensation, bonus opportunities and annual and long-term incentive
compensation opportunities that are substantially similar to those provided by
the Companies or their respective Affiliates immediately prior to the Closing
Date and (y) Buyer shall honor the severance policies of the Companies and
their respective Affiliates with respect to Transferred Employees.

(c) For a period of at least six (6) months immediately following the Closing
Date, Buyer shall, pursuant to plans and arrangements established or
maintained by Buyer (the "Buyer Benefit Plans"), provide the Transferred
Employees who remain employed by the Companies, Buyer or any Affiliate of
Buyer with employee benefits (including medical benefits) which are

34 Buyer shall cause service with the Companies and their respective Affiliates
prior to the Closing to be treated the same as service with any of Buyer or
its Affiliates from and after the Closing Date for purposes of eligibility,
vesting, and benefit accrual under Buyer Benefit Plans, except (i) to the
extent giving such credit would result in duplication of benefits, (ii) for
benefit accrual purposes under any defined benefit pension plan, (iii) for
purposes of any retiree medical plan or (iv) for any newly established plan of
Buyer for which similarly situated employees of Buyer do not receive past
service credit. To the extent permitted under the terms of Buyer's medical
benefit plans, to the extent not administratively impracticable, Buyer shall
use commercially reasonable efforts to (A) give effect, in determining any
deductible and maximum out-of-pocket limitations, to claims incurred and
amounts paid by, and amounts reimbursed to, such employees for the calendar
year in which the Closing occurs under any welfare benefit plans maintained or
contributed to by the Companies for their benefit immediately prior to the
Closing Date and (B) waive all limitations as to preexisting conditions,
exclusions and waiting periods with respect to participation and coverage
requirements applicable to the Transferred Employees under any welfare benefit
plans in which such employees may be eligible to participate after the Closing

with respect to such employees and that have not been satisfied as of the
Closing Date under any welfare plan maintained or contributed to by the
Companies or their Affiliates for their benefit immediately prior to the
Closing Date.

(d) Effective as of the Closing Date, Buyer shall establish or designate a
defined contribution retirement plan which is qualified or eligible for
qualification under Section 401(a) of the Code (the "Buyer's 401(k) Plan"),
except to the extent giving such credit would result in a duplication of
benefits. Buyer shall cause service with the Companies and their respective
Affiliates prior to the Closing to be treated the same as service with any of
Buyer and its Affiliates from and after the Closing Date for purposes of
eligibility, vesting, and benefit accrual under the Buyer's 401(k) Plan.
Consistent with Section 8.4(b) above, Buyer or its applicable Subsidiary shall
cause each Transferred Employee to be eligible to participate in the Buyer's
401(k) Plan, and any Transferred Employee who satisfies the eligibility
requirements of Buyer's 401(k) Plan, taking into account the foregoing, shall
become a participant in accordance with the terms of the Buyer's 401(k) Plan.
Buyer or its applicable Subsidiary shall cause Buyer's 401(k) Plan to accept
"eligible rollover distributions" (as defined in Section 402(c)(4) of the
Code) from Transferred Employees with respect to such Transferred Employees'
account balances (including loans) under the Pinnacle Entertainment, Inc.
401(k) investment plan in the form of cash (and, as applicable, promissory
notes with respect to loans), if elected by such Transferred Employees.

(e) No provision of this Agreement shall create any third party beneficiary
rights in any Transferred Employee, or any beneficiary or eligible family
member thereof, with respect to the compensation, terms and conditions of
employment and/or benefits that may be provided to any Transferred Employee by
Buyer or under any benefit plan which Buyer may maintain. In no event shall
the terms of this Agreement be deemed to (i) establish, amend, or modify any
Company Benefit Plan or any other benefit plan, program, agreement or
arrangement maintained or sponsored by Buyer, the Companies or any Subsidiary
of the Companies or any of their respective Affiliates; (ii) alter or limit
the ability of Buyer or any of its Subsidiaries (including, after the Closing
Date, the Companies or any Subsidiary of the Companies) to amend, modify or
terminate any benefit or employment plan, program, agreement or arrangement
after the Closing Date; or (iii) confer upon

35 any Property Employee any right to employment or continued employment or
continued service with Buyer or any of its Subsidiaries (including, following
the Closing Date, the Companies or any Subsidiary of the Companies), or
constitute or create an employment or other agreement with any Property
Employee.

(f) Sellers shall take all actions and execute all documents that are
necessary or advisable to ensure that, immediately prior to the Closing Date,
the Companies cease to participate in all Company Benefit Plans.

(g) On or following the Closing, Buyer shall comply with all provisions of the
WARN Act with respect to all Transferred Employees. As part of its obligations
under Article 11 hereof, Buyer shall indemnify, defend and hold Sellers and
the Companies harmless from and against any liability to any Transferred
Employees or any Governmental Entity that may result to Sellers and/or the
Companies based on Buyer's failure to comply with any provision of the WARN
Act as required by this Section 8.4(g), including, but not limited to, fines,
back pay and attorneys' fees. Sellers shall notify Buyer of any terminations
of the employment of any employees of the Companies that occur during the
ninety (90)-day period prior to the Closing.

Section 8.5 Access to Information and the Real Property; Post-Closing
Cooperation; Furnishing of Financial Statements.

(a) Upon reasonable notice, subject to applicable Law, including antitrust
Laws and Gaming Laws, the Companies shall afford Buyer's Representatives
reasonable access, during normal business hours, during the period from the
Effective Date to the Closing, to the Real Property (including the Casino) and
to all personnel, properties, books, Contracts and records (whether in paper
or electronic form) of the Casino and, during such period, the Companies shall
furnish promptly to Buyer all material information concerning the Business
(including the Real Property) as Buyer may reasonably request (collectively,
the "Inspection"); provided, however, that (i) Buyer shall provide the
Companies with at least twenty-four (24) hours' prior notice of any
Inspection; (ii) if any Company so requests, Buyer's Representatives shall be
accompanied by a Representative of such Company; (iii) Buyer shall not
initiate contact with employees or other representatives of any Company other
than such Representative designated by such Company without the prior consent
of Sellers, such Company or such Representative, which consent shall not be
unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed; (iv) Buyer's Representatives
shall not be entitled to perform any physical testing of any nature with
respect to any portion of the Real Property without a Company's prior written
consent, such consent not to be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed;
(v) Buyer shall not materially interfere with the Business; (vi) with respect
to any inspection of the gaming areas in the Casino (floor, casino cage,
accounting, and Missouri Gaming Commission security areas), Buyer and Sellers
shall agree on the date, time and scope of the inspection and also obtain the
concurrence of the Missouri Gaming Commission; and (vii) Buyer shall, at its
sole cost and expense, repair any damage (including damage relating to the
worsening or alteration of environmental conditions or migration of Hazardous
Materials) to the Purchased Assets or any other property owned by a Person
other than Buyer caused by Inspection, and shall reimburse the Companies for
any loss caused by any Inspection, and restore the Purchased Assets or such
other third-party property to substantially similar condition as existed prior
to such Inspection, and shall indemnify, defend and hold harmless Sellers, the
Companies and its Affiliates from and against any

36 personal injury or property damage claims, liabilities, judgments or expenses
(including reasonable attorneys' fees) incurred by any of them arising or
resulting therefrom. Prior to entering the Real Property to perform any tests
and assessments or for any other reason permitted hereunder and, thereafter,
Buyer's contractors or consultants who shall perform the Inspection shall
obtain a policy of comprehensive public liability insurance in an amount not
less than Ten Million Dollars ($10,000,000.00) naming the Companies as
additional insureds and insuring against any and all liabilities for damages
to property or injury or death to persons arising out of the entry onto the
Real Property of all persons and property on Buyer's behalf. Such insurance
policy shall be with a nationally recognized insurance company and Buyer shall
endeavor to provide the Companies at least thirty (30) days' written notice
prior to the termination of such policy. Sellers and the Companies shall
permit Buyer to meet with the Trustee to discuss the Companies, the Business
and the finances and operations of the Companies, all in such detail and at
such times and as often as Buyer may reasonably request, so long as, in the
reasonable judgment of the Companies, such meetings and discussions would not
be reasonably be expected to materially interfere with the Business or the
Trustee's duties and responsibilities under the FTC Documents. In addition to
the foregoing, at all times from the Effective Date to the Closing Date,
Sellers shall take all action reasonably necessary to cause Buyer to have
direct and unlimited access to the Trustee, so long as, in the reasonable
judgment of the Sellers, such access would not be reasonably be expected to
materially interfere with the Business or the Trustee's duties and
responsibilities under the FTC Documents. Notwithstanding the foregoing, (i)
Target agrees to provide Buyer a complete copy of all documented Internal
Controls within forty-five (45) days after the Effective Date and (ii) Buyer,
directly or indirectly, shall not have the right to control or direct any
Company's operations prior to the Closing.

(b) Following the Closing Date, each party hereto will hold, and will use its
commercially reasonable efforts to cause its Affiliates and its and their
respective Representatives to hold, in strict confidence from any Person
(other than any such Affiliate or Representative) all documents and
information concerning the other party or any of its Affiliates (and, for the
avoidance of doubt, treating information concerning the Business and the
Purchased Assets as information concerning Buyer) unless (i) compelled to
disclose by judicial or administrative process (including in connection with
obtaining the necessary approvals of this Agreement and the transactions
contemplated hereby of any Governmental Entity) or by other requirements of
Law or (ii) disclosed in an action or proceeding brought by another party
hereto in pursuit of its rights or in the exercise of its remedies hereunder,
or unless such documents or information can be shown to have been (1)
previously known by the party receiving such documents or information (other
than pursuant to breach of an agreement to keep such information
confidential), (2) in the public domain (either prior to or after the
furnishing of such documents or information hereunder) through no fault of
such receiving party or (3) later acquired by the receiving party from another
source if the receiving party is not aware that such source is under an
obligation to another party hereto to keep such documents and information
confidential. Buyer and the Companies agree that in the event any proprietary
information or knowledge relating to an Excluded Asset is obtained, revealed
or otherwise made known to Buyer in effecting (x) the transition from Excluded
Software to replacement software pursuant to Section 1.2 hereof, specifically,
or (y) the removal of the Excluded Assets, generally, Buyer shall not reveal,
disclose, employ or otherwise use any such proprietary information and will
hold such information in confidence in accordance with the terms of the
Confidentiality Agreement.

37 (c) Following the Closing, and for so long as Sellers, on the one hand, or
Buyer, on the other hand, or their respective Affiliates are prosecuting,
participating in, contesting or defending any action, claim, investigation,
suit or proceeding, whenever filed or made, in connection with or involving in
any way (i) this Agreement or the transactions contemplated hereby or (ii) the
conduct or operation of the Business prior to or after the Closing, including
any action, claim, investigation, suit or proceeding related to the Excluded
Assets, the other party shall (and shall cause its Affiliates, and its and
their respective Representatives, to) (A) reasonably cooperate with such party
and its Affiliates and their Representatives with the prosecution,
participation, contest or defense, (B) provide such party and its Affiliates
and their Representatives with reasonable access to all properties, books,
contracts, commitments and records (whether in paper or electronic form)
related to the Real Property and (C) reasonably make available to such party
and its Affiliates and their Representatives its personnel (including, by
Buyer, the Transferred Employees), including for purposes of fact finding,
consultation, testimony, interviews, depositions and witnesses, in each case
as shall be reasonably necessary in connection with the prosecution,
participation, contest or defense of the applicable action, claim,
investigation, suit or proceeding by such party and its Affiliates and
Representatives. Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, following
the Closing, Buyer shall, upon reasonable notice, afford Sellers reasonable
access during normal business hours to the books and records of the Companies
(including information regarding accounts receivable and accounts payable that
may have been received by the Companies following the Closing but relate to
periods prior to or through the Closing) relating to the periods prior to and
through the Closing in connection with the preparation of the Final Closing
Statement and in connection with Parent's reporting obligations under Law
(including Gaming Laws and securities Laws).

(d) During the period from the Effective Date through the earlier of the
termination of this Agreement and the Closing, Sellers shall furnish or cause
to be furnished to Buyer:

(i) Monthly Financial Statements. As soon as available, and in any event
within thirty (30) calendar days after the end of each calendar month,
financial statements of the Companies, consisting of an unaudited balance

month, all in reasonable detail and certified (subject to normal year-end
audit adjustments and the absence of footnotes) by an officer of the Companies
as having been prepared in accordance with GAAP, consistently applied.

(ii) Quarterly Financial Statements. As soon as available and in any event
within forty-five (45) calendar days after the end of each fiscal quarter,
including the last fiscal quarter in each fiscal year, financial statements of

statement of income for the fiscal quarter then ended and the fiscal year
through that date, all in reasonable detail and certified (subject to normal
year-end audit adjustments and the absence of footnotes) by an officer of the
Companies as having been prepared in accordance with GAAP, consistently
applied.

(iii) Other Reports. Promptly upon becoming available, any budget, forecast,
projection, report or notice made, submitted or delivered in writing that was
required to be given pursuant to any Material Contract.

(a) The parties hereto shall reasonably cooperate with each other and use

necessary, proper or advisable under applicable Law or otherwise to consummate
and make effective the transactions contemplated by this Agreement as promptly
as practicable; (ii) obtain from any Governmental Entities any consents,
approvals, findings of suitability, expiration or terminations of waiting
periods, licenses, permits, waivers, approvals, orders or authorizations
required (A) to be obtained or made by Sellers, the Companies or Buyer or any
of their respective Affiliates or any of their respective Representatives and
(B) to avoid any action or proceeding by any Governmental Entity, in

and shall act diligently and promptly to pursue the Governmental Approvals and
shall reasonably cooperate with each other in connection with the making of
all filings and the obtaining of all such Governmental Approvals referenced in
the preceding sentence, provided, that Buyer shall bear the ultimate
responsibility of obtaining all Gaming Approvals and that nothing in this
Section 8.6(b) shall be deemed to create any obligation to provide to Sellers
personal information regarding any individual applicant for licensing under
applicable Gaming Laws. Subject to applicable Laws relating to the exchange of
information, prior to making any application or material written communication
to or filing with any Governmental Entity with respect to Governmental
Approvals (other than information related to Buyer's casino license

applications), each party shall provide the other parties with drafts thereof

parties the opportunity to participate in all telephonic conferences and all
meetings with any Governmental Entity (other than information related to
Buyer's casino license applications and personal information concerning
individuals who are filing applications) to the extent relating to
Governmental Approvals. Buyer, Sellers and the Companies shall, to the extent
practicable, consult with the other parties on, in each case, subject to
applicable Laws relating to the exchange of information (including antitrust
Laws and Gaming Laws), all the non-confidential information relating to Buyer,
Sellers or the Companies, as the case may be, and any of their respective
Affiliates or Representatives which appear in any filing made with, or written
materials submitted to, any third party or any Governmental Entity to the
extent

Agreement (other than information related to Buyer's casino license
applications and personal information concerning individuals who are filing
applications).

(b) Without limiting Section 8.6(a) hereof, Buyer, each Seller and each
Company shall:

(i) each use its reasonable best efforts to avoid the entry of, or to have
vacated or terminated, any decree, order, or judgment that would restrain,
prevent or delay the Closing, on or before the Outside Date, including

any Person; and

(ii) each use its reasonable best efforts to avoid or eliminate each and every
impediment under any antitrust, competition or trade regulation Law that may
be asserted by any Governmental Entity or any other Person with respect to the
Closing so as to enable the Closing to occur as soon as reasonably possible
(and in any event no later than the Outside Date), including implementing,
contesting, or resisting any litigation before any court or administrative
tribunal seeking to restrain or enjoin the Closing.

challenging this Agreement or the consummation of the transactions

consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby and use reasonable best
efforts to have any such decree, injunction or other order vacated or
reversed.

(d) From the Effective Date until the Closing, each party shall promptly
notify all other parties hereto in writing of any pending or, to the knowledge
of Buyer, Sellers or any Company, as appropriate, threatened action, suit,
arbitration or other proceeding or investigation by any Governmental Entity or
any other Person (i) challenging or seeking damages in connection with the
Closing or any other transaction contemplated by this Agreement or (ii)
seeking to restrain or prohibit the consummation of the Closing.

Section 8.7 Publicity. Sellers, on the one hand, and Buyer, on the other hand,
shall agree on the form and content of the initial press release regarding the
transactions contemplated hereby and thereafter shall consult with each other
before issuing, provide each other the opportunity to review and comment upon,
and negotiate in good faith to agree upon, any press release or other public
statement with respect to any of the transactions contemplated hereby and
shall not issue any such press release or make any such public statement prior
to such consultation and prior to considering in good faith any such comments,
except as may be required by applicable Law or any listing agreement with any

transactions that Sellers or Buyer elect to undertake). Notwithstanding
anything to the contrary herein, Buyer and Parent may make any public

Buyer, Sellers and the Companies shall take all commercially reasonable action
necessary (including executing and delivering further notices, assumptions,
releases and acquisitions); provided, that if such action is necessary due to
events or circumstances particular to Buyer, Buyer shall bear the cost of such
action, and otherwise Sellers shall bear the cost of such action. All costs
and expenses related to recording the Trademark Assignment Agreement shall be
borne by Buyer.

(c) Except with respect to the Assigned Contracts which the parties agree
shall be assigned to one of the Companies prior to Closing, this Agreement
shall not constitute an agreement to assign any Contract or Permit included in
the Purchased Assets or the Excluded Assets if an attempted assignment of such
Contract or Permit, without the consent of any third parties thereto, would
constitute a breach thereof or in any material adverse way affect the rights
thereunder of the party that is to be assigned such Contract or Permit
hereunder (the "Intended Assignee"). If any such consent has not been obtained
prior to the Closing, the holder of the applicable Contract or Permit agrees
to hold the benefit of such Contract or Permit in trust for the Intended
Assignee and to cooperate with the Intended Assignee in any reasonable
arrangements designed to provide all benefits thereunder to the Intended
Assignee, including enforcement for the benefit of the Intended Assignee of

indemnify, defend and hold harmless the Companies for any obligation or
liability asserted against the Companies arising out of Sellers' or their
Subsidiaries' performance of such Excluded Contracts for periods from and
after the Closing.

(e) Sellers shall use their commercially reasonable efforts to obtain the
consent of any third parties necessary to remove themselves or their
Subsidiaries, as applicable, as parties to any Contract constituting a
Purchased Asset to which Sellers or any of their Subsidiaries other than the
Companies is also party. If Sellers are not able to obtain any such consents
prior to the Closing, Sellers agree not to assert or enforce, and to cause
their Subsidiaries, if applicable, not to assert or enforce, any rights under
the applicable Contracts against the other party or parties thereto. Buyer
agrees to indemnify, defend and hold harmless Sellers and their Subsidiaries,
as applicable, for any obligation or liability asserted against Sellers or
their Subsidiaries arising out of the Companies' performance of such Contracts
for periods from and after the Closing.

Section 8.9 Transfer Taxes. All transfer, recording, documentary, sales, use,
stamp, registration and other such Taxes (including real estate transfer or
similar Taxes that arise from any indirect transfer of property as a result of
the transfer of the Equity Interests) and related fees (including any

("Transfer Taxes") shall be paid half by Sellers and half by Buyer; provided,

Returns pertaining to and paying such Transfer Taxes shall (i) timely file
such Tax Returns and remit to the applicable Governmental Authority payment of
the Transfer Taxes required to be remitted therewith and (ii) promptly provide
a copy of such Tax Return to the other party. If a party pays Transfer Taxes

Tax Returns and related documentation on a timely basis as may be required to
comply with the provisions of any applicable Law.

Section 8.10 No Control. Except as permitted by the terms of this Agreement,
prior to the Closing, Buyer shall not directly or indirectly control,
supervise, direct or interfere with, or attempt to control, supervise, direct
or interfere with, the Companies, including the Casino, the Real Property,

records as having visited the Casino and restrict access to the Customer
Database Records to Casino employees and those Parent's employees in its
Database Marketing Shared Services Group who need access to the Customer
Database Records to provide


 

--- 
| | 

2844184.4 01

|

46 support services required by the Trustee and Casino marketing employees;
provided, however, that Parent and its Affiliates may retain each Lumiere Only
Customer's (as defined below) name, address, email and tier status in the
Customer Loyalty Program and total comp balance for all of Parent's and its
Affiliates' casinos (including the Casino) in the aggregate; provided further,
that Parent shall also have access to the Customer Database Records to the
extent such information is necessary to ensure compliance with Law or other
legal obligations or to defend or prosecute actual or potential litigation.
Parent shall adopt written policies to provide that, once access to the
Customer Database Records has been appropriately restricted as required under
the terms of the FTC Documents and this Section 8.15, additional access may
not be granted to other individuals and positions at Parent or its Affiliates
(other than Casino employees and Parent's Database Marketing Shared Services
Group employees) without a written approval from Parent's general counsel.
During the Interim Period, Parent's marketing strategies and activities with
respect to the Casino shall be managed and directed by the Trustee and Casino
employees, and the Trustee will be able to utilize Parent's Database Marketing
Shared Services Group to obtain necessary support services to implement such
marketing activities. Except for joint marketing activities approved by the
Trustee or Casino employees under the direction of the Trustee, Parent or its
Affiliates shall not directly market any other casino or hotel owned by Parent
or its Affiliates to any Lumiere Only Customer during the Interim Period
unless or until such customer visits another casino or hotel owned by Parent
or its Affiliates (other than the Casino) and furnishes personal information
to such casino or hotel (by presenting such customer's Customer Loyalty
Program card or otherwise); provided, however, that Parent and its Affiliates
may engage in general advertising and general marketing for other casinos or
hotels owned by Parent or its Affiliates not specifically directed to Lumiere
Only Customers. For purposes of clarity, during the Interim Period, Parent may
retain and use the Retained Database Records.

(c) From and after the Closing Date, for customers referenced in Parent's
database records as of the Closing Date as having visited only the Casino, and
not any other casinos or hotels owned by Parent or its Affiliates ("Lumiere
Only Customers"), Parent and its Affiliates may retain each Lumiere Only
Customer's name, address, email and tier status in the Customer Loyalty
Program and total comp balance as of the Closing Date for all of Parent's and
its Affiliates' casinos (including the Casino) in the aggregate. In addition,
on the Closing Date Parent will segregate in its customer database all other
information regarding Lumiere Only Customers and shall only permit access to
such information to the extent such information is necessary to ensure
compliance with Law or other legal obligations or to defend or prosecute
actual or potential litigation. At no time following the Closing Date shall
Parent or its Affiliates directly market to any Lumiere Only Customer unless
or until such customer visits another casino or hotel owned by Parent or its
Affiliates (other than the Casino) and furnishes personal information to such
casino or hotel (by presenting such customer's Customer Loyalty Program card
or otherwise); provided, however, that Parent and its Affiliates may use the
name, address and email of Lumiere Only Customers to send (i) one (1)
notification (in the form and substance reasonably acceptable to Buyer) within
thirty (30) days after the Closing Date to each Lumiere Only Customer
informing such Lumiere Only Customer of his or her total comp balance as of
the Closing Date and of the discontinuance of the Customer Loyalty Program at
the Casino and (ii) one (1) notification (in the form and substance reasonably
acceptable to Buyer) to each Lumiere Only Customer, if applicable, seeking or
conveying information (e.g., selection of type of car or color) from or to
such Lumiere Only Customer relating to the fulfillment

47 of the prior year's tier benefits under the Customer Loyalty Program;
provided, further, that Parent and its Affiliates may engage in general
advertising and general marketing for other casinos or hotels owned by Parent
or its Affiliates not specifically directed to Lumiere Only Customers.

(d) From and after the Closing Date, for customers referenced in Parent's
database records as having visited the Casino and any other casino or hotel
owned by Parent or its Affiliates other than the Casino (the "Shared
Customers"), Parent and its Affiliates may retain and use the Retained
Database Records. Parent will segregate in its customer database the
information described in items 2 and 3 referenced in the definition of
Customer Database Records with respect to the Shared Customers and shall only
permit access to such information to the extent such information is necessary
to ensure compliance with Law or other legal obligations or to defend or
prosecute actual or potential litigation. For the avoidance of doubt, nothing
in this Agreement shall restrict Parent or its Affiliates from retaining and
using any information, including, without limitation, the Retained Database
Records, with respect to customers who have not visited the Casino.

(e) For purposes of this Section 8.15, the Companies shall not be considered
Affiliates of Parent from and after the Closing.

Section 8.16 Lien and Guaranty Release. Sellers shall use their commercially
reasonable efforts to facilitate and encourage the making of any filings,
releases, discharges, deeds and other documents necessary to evidence the

Indebtedness (including guarantee obligations in respect of indebtedness of
Parent or its other subsidiaries) of the Companies is outstanding (the
"Lenders") of all Liens and Encumbrances in connection therewith relating to
the Purchased Assets, the Equity Interests, the Business or the Companies
("Lender Liens"), and all obligations (including guarantee obligations) of the
Companies in respect of such Indebtedness ("Loan Obligations"), on or prior to
the Closing Date.

Section 8.17 Rebranding. Until six (6) months following the Closing, the
Companies shall have a non-exclusive, non-transferable license to use the
names "Stadium Sports Bar," "ETC," "Blush" and "globar" in connection with the
operation of the venues within the Casino bearing such names at no cost to
Buyer. Within such six-month period, Buyer shall timely complete all steps
required to rebrand such venues under different names. Buyer, the Companies
and their Affiliates shall not (a) use the "Stadium Sports Bar," "ETC,"
"Blush," and "globar" names or trademarks in any manner after such name change
and (b) shall not use any other Intellectual Property of Sellers, including
the "mychoice" name or trademark after the Closing. Buyer and the Companies
(after Closing) shall use commercially reasonable efforts to obtain any
necessary approvals from Gaming Authorities with respect to the name change
contemplated by this Section 8.17.

Section 8.18 FTC Approval. Subject to this Section 8.18, all terms and
conditions of this Agreement shall be subject to FTC approval and the
substitution or addition of such modified or other terms and conditions as the
FTC may require.

(a) Each party hereto agrees to accept such changes to this Agreement as shall
be required by the FTC and to negotiate in good faith and execute promptly an
appropriate amendment to this Agreement to reflect such required changes (an
"Amendment"), unless (i) such


 

--- 
| | 

2844184.4 01

|

48 changes would reasonably be expected to have, in the aggregate, a Company
Material Adverse Effect or a Buyer Material Adverse Effect, (ii) as a result
of such changes, either party requires a change in the Purchase Price, or
(iii) such changes would adversely affect the economics of the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement (other than as a result of either party's
requirement of a change in the Purchase Price, which shall be subject to
Section 8.18(a)(ii)); provided, that in the case of clauses (ii) and (iii),
only the party who is not requiring the change in Purchase Price or whose
economics would be adversely affected (the "Affected Party") may elect not to
execute an Amendment and may terminate this Agreement pursuant to Section
8.18(b) hereof. Prior to entering any Amendment, the parties shall use
reasonable efforts to seek consultation with the FTC or its staff to review
the Amendment in light of the requirements of the FTC giving rise to such
Amendment.

(b) If either party elects not to execute an Amendment pursuant to Section
8.18(a)(i) or the Affected Party elects not to execute an Amendment pursuant
to Section 8.18(a)(ii) or (iii), either party may terminate this Agreement
and, upon such termination, the Deposit, together with any interest earned
thereon, shall be paid to Buyer; provided, that in the case of Section
8.18(a)(iii), the parties hereto shall take the actions set forth in Section
8.18(c) below prior to any termination of this Agreement pursuant to this
Section 8.18(b).

(c) If the Affected Party elects not to execute an Amendment pursuant to
Section 8.18(a)(iii), then the parties hereto shall, in good faith, use their
respective commercially reasonable efforts to reach prompt (but in any event
within ten (10) Business Days after receiving the FTC's request to make the
required changes) mutual agreement with respect to an Amendment reflecting
such changes. If the parties hereto, after complying with the preceding
sentence are unable to reach mutual agreement with respect to an Amendment
within such ten (10) Business Day period, then the parties shall submit the
matters that the parties have been unable to resolve with respect to such
Amendment, including, without limitation, economic accommodations arising from
or related to the changes required by the FTC, but excluding changes to the
Purchase Price, to an independent nationally recognized investment banking
firm, independent nationally recognized accounting firm or other independent
arbitrator ("Arbitrator") mutually agreed upon by Parent and Buyer for final
and binding resolution of such dispute in accordance with procedures mutually
agreed upon by Parent and Buyer. If Parent and Buyer are unable to agree on an
Arbitrator, then Parent and Buyer shall each select such an Arbitrator, and
the two Arbitrators so selected shall select a third Arbitrator to be the
Arbitrator with respect to the unresolved matters with respect to such
Amendment. Subject to the last sentence of this Section 8.18(c), the findings
of the Arbitrator so selected by Parent and Buyer (or, if Parent and Buyer are
unable to agree on an Arbitrator, so selected by the Arbitrators pursuant to
the foregoing sentence) shall be final and binding on all of the parties
hereto, and the fees and expenses of the Arbitrator(s) shall be paid by one-
half by Parent and one-half by Buyer. In the event that the findings of the
Arbitrator include a change to the Purchase Price or changes that cause either
party to require a change to the Purchase Price, the party who is not
requiring the change in Purchase Price or whose economics would be adversely
affected may elect not to execute an Amendment and terminate this Agreement,
and, upon such termination, the Deposit, together with any interest earned
thereon, shall be paid to Buyer.

ARTICLE 10

TERMINATION AND AMENDMENT

Section 10.1 Termination. This Agreement may be terminated at any time prior
to the Closing (with respect to Section 10.1(b) through Section 10.1(h)
hereof, by written notice by the terminating party to the other parties):

(a) by mutual written agreement of Sellers and Buyer;

(b) by Sellers or Buyer, if the transactions contemplated hereby shall not
have been consummated on or prior to the Outside Date; provided, however, that
(i) if the Closing shall not have occurred by the Outside Date and the receipt
of Gaming Approval of the Missouri Gaming Commission is the sole remaining
condition to Closing (other than conditions to be satisfied or waived at or
upon the Closing) and the satisfaction of such conditions remains reasonably
possible, (x) each of Sellers and Buyer shall have the right, exercisable in
its sole discretion, to extend the Outside Date by written notice given to the
other parties to this Agreement for up to an additional thirty (30) days, and
such right may be exercised on successive occasions up to two (2) times, (y)
Buyer shall have the right, exercisable with consent of Sellers, not to be
unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed (taking into account, among
other factors, the likelihood of the receipt by Buyer of Gaming Approval of
the Missouri Gaming Commission), by written notice to Sellers at least thirty
(30) days prior to the Outside Date (as extended pursuant to the preceding
clause (x)), to require Sellers to use reasonable best efforts to obtain FTC
approval to further extend the time permitted under the FTC Documents to
consummate the Closing, and (z) in the event the FTC provides its approval
pursuant to the foregoing clause (y), Buyer shall have the right, in each case
exercisable with consent of Sellers, not to be unreasonably withheld,
conditioned or delayed (taking

54 into account, among other factors, the likelihood of the receipt by Buyer of
Gaming Approval of the Missouri Gaming Commission), by written notice to
Sellers to extend the Outside Date for up to an additional thirty (30) days,
and such right may be exercised on successive occasions up to three (3) times;
provided, that in any case no extension may be longer than is permitted under
the FTC Documents; provided, further, that the right to terminate this
Agreement under this Section 10.1(b) shall not be available to Sellers or
Buyer, respectively, if Sellers' (or the Companies') or Buyer's failure,
respectively, to fulfill any obligation of Sellers (or the Companies) or
Buyer, respectively, under this Agreement has been the primary cause of the
failure of the Closing to occur on or before the Outside Date (it being agreed
solely for purposes of this Section 10.1(b), and without limiting Section
10.1(c) or any other provision of this Agreement, that the failure to obtain
the Gaming Approval of the Missouri Gaming Commission shall not be deemed to
have been primarily caused by Buyer's failure to fulfill any of its
obligations under this Agreement if Buyer has used its reasonable best efforts
to obtain such Gaming Approval under Section 8.6);

(c) by Sellers or Buyer, if the Missouri Gaming Commission has made a final,
non‑appealable determination that the Missouri Gaming Commission will not
issue to Buyer all Gaming Approvals issuable by the Missouri Gaming
Commission;

(d) by Sellers or Buyer, if a court of competent jurisdiction or other
Governmental Entity (other than the Missouri Gaming Commission, which shall be
governed by Section 10.1(c)) shall have issued a non-appealable final order,
decree or ruling or taken any other non-appealable final action, in each case,
having the effect of permanently restraining, enjoining or otherwise
prohibiting the Closing and the transactions contemplated hereby;

(e) by Buyer, if the Companies or Sellers have breached any representation,
warranty, covenant or agreement on the part of the Companies or Sellers set
forth in this Agreement which (i) would result in a failure of a condition set
forth in Section 9.1 or Section 9.2 hereof to be satisfied and (ii) is not
cured within thirty (30) calendar days after written notice thereof; provided,
however, that if such breach cannot reasonably be cured within such thirty
(30) day period but can be reasonably cured prior to the Outside Date, and the
Companies and Sellers are diligently proceeding to cure such breach, this
Agreement may not be terminated pursuant to this Section 10.1(e); provided,
further, that Buyer's right to terminate this Agreement under this Section
10.1(e) shall not be available if, at the time of such intended termination,
Sellers have the right to terminate this Agreement under Section 10.1(b),
Section 10.1(c), Section 10.1(d), Section 10.1(f), Section 10.1(g), or Section
10.1(h) hereof;

(f) by Sellers, if Buyer has breached any representation, warranty, covenant
or agreement on the part of Buyer set forth in this Agreement which (i) would
result in a failure of a condition set forth in Section 9.1 or Section 9.3 to
be satisfied hereof and (ii) is not cured within thirty (30) calendar days
after written notice thereof; provided, however, that if such breach cannot
reasonably be cured within such thirty (30) calendar day period but can be
reasonably cured prior to the Outside Date, and Buyer is diligently proceeding
to cure such breach, this Agreement may not be terminated pursuant to this
Section 10.1(f); provided, further, that Sellers' right to terminate this
Agreement under this Section 10.1(f) shall not be available if, at the time of
such intended termination, Buyer has the right to terminate this Agreement
under Section 10.1(b), Section 10.1(d) , Section 10.1(e) or Section 10.1(g)
hereof;


 

--- 
| | 

2844184.4 01

|

55 (g) by Sellers or Buyer, pursuant to Section 8.18(b) or Section 8.18(c); or

(h) by Sellers or Buyer, if the FTC shall have made a final determination that
the FTC will not approve the FTC Documents, this Agreement and, if approval
thereof is required by the FTC, the Ancillary Documents, Buyer or the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement.

Section 10.2 Effect of Termination.

(a) Liability. In the event of termination of this Agreement as provided in
Section 10.1 hereof, this Agreement shall immediately become void, and there
shall be no liability on the part of Buyer or Sellers, or their respective
Affiliates or Representatives, other than pursuant to this Section 10.2 and
Article 13 hereof; provided, however, that nothing contained in this Section
10.2 shall relieve or limit the liability of any party to this Agreement for
any fraud or willful misconduct.

(b) Fees and Expenses. Except as otherwise expressly provided in this
Agreement, all fees and expenses incurred in connection with this Agreement
and the transactions contemplated hereby shall be paid by the party incurring
such expenses, whether or not the Closing is consummated. Any cancellation
charges of the Escrow Agent or Title Insurer shall be paid by the party who
breached this Agreement, and, if no party breached this Agreement, then each
of Sellers and Buyer shall pay one-half of such cancellation charges.

(c) Application of the Deposit; Specific Performance; Liability Limitation.

(i) Except as expressly provided in this Section 10.2(c)(i), upon the
termination of this Agreement, the Deposit, together with interest earned
thereon, shall be paid to Buyer. In the event that this Agreement is
terminated by Buyer or Sellers under (A) Section 10.1(b) and any Gaming
Authority has made a final determination that such Gaming Authority will not
issue to Buyer all Gaming Approvals, regardless of whether such determination
is appealable or then being appealed, (B) Section 10.1(c), or (C) Section
10.1(f), then, in each such case, within ten (10) Business Days after
termination of this Agreement, Sellers shall elect in writing to either (x)
pursue specific performance of this Agreement and/or money damages for breach
of this Agreement (and to the extent Sellers elect to pursue specific
performance, this Agreement shall be deemed not to have terminated), or (y)
direct Buyer to give the Escrow Agent instructions to pay the Deposit,
together with any interest thereon, to Parent (or its designee) by wire
transfer of immediately available funds to an account designated by Parent. If
Sellers fail to make an election pursuant to the prior sentence within such
ten (10) Business Day period, then Sellers shall be deemed to have elected to
receive the Deposit pursuant to the preceding clause (y), and Buyer shall give
the Escrow Agent instructions to such effect. Notwithstanding the foregoing,
if, at any time prior to the time of termination of this Agreement by Sellers
as described in this Section 10.2(c)(i), Buyer had any right to terminate this
Agreement pursuant to any other provision of this Agreement, the Deposit,
together with any interest thereon, shall not be payable to Parent (or its
designee), and the Deposit, together with any interest thereon, shall be paid
to Buyer.

(ii) Each of Sellers and Buyer acknowledge that, without the provisions set
forth in Section 10.2(c)(i), and the other provisions of this Section 10.2(c),
Sellers would not have entered into this Agreement; and that the payment of
the Deposit pursuant to Section 10.2(c)


 

--- 
| | 

2844184.4 01

|

56 (i)(y) is not a penalty, but rather is liquidated damages in a reasonable
amount that will appropriately compensate Sellers in the event this Agreement
is terminated as described in Section 10.2(c)(i). The payment of the Deposit
to Parent (or its designee) in accordance with Section 10.2(c)(i)(y) shall be
liquidated damages and shall be the sole and exclusive remedy of Sellers in
connection with the termination of this Agreement as provided in Section
10.2(c)(i)(y).

(iii) Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, in the event of a
termination of this Agreement, Sellers' aggregate recovery of monetary damages
against Buyer or any of Buyer's Affiliates in any lawsuit, arbitration, claim
or other action brought in law against Buyer or any of Buyer's Affiliates, in
connection with this Agreement or the transactions contemplated hereby, shall
not exceed Thirty Million Dollars ($30,000,000.00). For the avoidance of
doubt, the foregoing limitation shall not prevent Sellers from recovering the
full Purchase Price, as it may be adjusted in accordance with the terms of
this Agreement, to the extent Sellers are granted specific performance of this
Agreement sought in accordance with Section 10.2(c)(i)(x).

ARTICLE 11

Agreements.

(a) Except as set forth in Article 10 and Section 11.1(b) hereof, the

controlling any such party or any of their Representatives whether prior to or
after the execution of this Agreement.

(b) The representations and warranties made by Sellers, the Companies and
Buyer in this Agreement shall survive the Closing until (and claims based upon

expiration of the statute of limitations (taking into account any extensions
or waivers thereof) applicable to the collection of the applicable Tax that is
the subject of such representations. The period of time a representation or
warranty survives the Closing pursuant to the preceding sentence shall be the
"Survival Period" with respect to such representation or warranty. The parties
agree that, subject to the last sentence of this Section 11.1(b), no claim may
be brought based upon, directly or indirectly, any of the representations and
warranties contained in this Agreement after the Survival Period with respect
to such representation or warranty.


 

--- 
| | 

2844184.4 01

|

57 The covenants and agreements of the parties hereto in this Agreement shall
survive the Closing without any contractual limitation on the period of
survival (other than those covenants and agreements that are expressly
required to remain in full force and effect for a specified period of time).
The termination of the representations and warranties provided herein shall
not affect a party (i) in respect of any claim made by such party in
reasonable detail in writing received by an Indemnifying Party prior to the
expiration of the applicable Survival Period provided herein, or (ii) in
respect of any claim based in fraud or willful misconduct of the Indemnifying
Party.

Section 11.2 Indemnification.

(a) Except with respect to Taxes that are governed by Section 11.2(d), from
and after the Closing, Sellers, jointly and severally, shall indemnify, save
and hold harmless Buyer and its Affiliates and its and their respective
Representatives, successors and assigns (each, a "Buyer Indemnified Party" and
collectively, the "Buyer Indemnified Parties") from and against any and all
costs, losses, Taxes, Liabilities, obligations, damages, claims, demands and
expenses (whether or not arising out of third-party claims), including
interest, penalties, reasonable attorneys' fees and all amounts paid in

"Damages"), incurred in connection with, arising out of, or resulting from:

(i) any breach of any representation or warranty made by Sellers or the
Companies in this Agreement;

Representatives and successors (each, a "Seller Indemnified Party" and
collectively, the "Seller Indemnified Parties") from and against any and all
Damages incurred in connection with, arising out of, or resulting from:

(i) any breach of any representation or warranty made by Buyer in this
Agreement; or

(ii) any breach of any covenant or agreement made, or to be performed, by
Buyer in this Agreement.

(c) Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the contrary, the term
Damages shall not include any consequential, special or incidental damages,

2844184.4 01

58 (d) Without duplication of Taxes taken into account in the determination of
the Estimated Closing Payment or the Final Closing Payment, and aside from any
Transfer Taxes for which Buyer is liable under Section 8.9, from and after the
Closing, Sellers shall indemnify, save and hold harmless the Buyer Indemnified
Parties from and against any and all Damages incurred in connection with,
arising out of, or resulting from: (A) any breach of any representation or
warranty contained in Section 6.5 (Taxes); (B) any breach of any covenant or
agreement made, or to be performed by Sellers or the Companies on or prior to
the Closing Date, pursuant to Section 2.3, Section 8.1(q), Section 8.9 and
Section 11.8; (C) any Taxes of the Companies or relating to the Purchased
Assets for any Pre-Closing Period; (D) any and all liability for Taxes (as a
result of Treasury Regulation Section 1.1502-6 or otherwise) of any other
Person with whom Companies otherwise join or have ever joined (or is or has
ever been required to join) in filing any consolidated, combined or unitary
Tax Return for a Pre-Closing Period or a Straddle Period; (E) any and all
liability for Taxes for any Pre-Closing Period as a result of any of the
Companies being party to or having any obligation under any Tax-sharing, Tax
indemnity or Tax allocation agreement or similar agreement; (F) any Taxes
imposed on the Buyer or the Companies resulting from any transaction or action
engaged in (or election made) by Sellers or the Companies prior to the
effective time of the Closing; and (G) any Taxes imposed on the Companies (in
their capacity as "old target" under Treasury Regulation Section
1.338-2(c)(17) or Treasury Regulation Section 1.336-1(b)(3), as applicable) or
Parent as a result of consummating the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement, including making the elections under Section 338(h)(10) of the Code
and the protective election under Section 336(e) of the Code. From and after
the Closing, Buyer shall indemnify, save and hold harmless Seller Indemnified
Parties from and against any and all Damages incurred in connection with,
arising out of, or resulting from: (A) any breach of any covenant or agreement
made, or to be performed by Buyer, pursuant to Section 2.3, Section 8.9 and
Section 11.8; and (B) any Taxes of the Companies or relating to the Purchased
Assets for any Post-Closing Period; in each case, other than Taxes for which
Sellers are responsible pursuant to this Section 11.2(d). Sellers acknowledge
that the rights to indemnification of Buyer Indemnified Parties under this
Section 11.2(d) are intended to be an unconditional "first dollar"
indemnification (an indemnification that is not subject to the Deductible or
Cap).

Section 11.3 Procedure for Claims between Parties. Except with respect to
Taxes which are governed by Section 11.2(d), if a claim for Damages is to be
made by a Buyer Indemnified Party or Seller Indemnified Party (each, an
"Indemnified Party" and collectively, the "Indemnified Parties") entitled to
indemnification hereunder, such party shall give written notice briefly
describing the claim and, to the extent then ascertainable, the monetary
damages sought (each, a "Notice") to the indemnifying party hereunder (the
"Indemnifying Party" and collectively, the "Indemnifying Parties") as soon as
practicable after such Indemnified Party becomes aware of any fact, condition
or event which may give rise to Damages for which indemnification may be
sought under this Article 11\. Any failure to submit any such notice of claim
to the Indemnifying Party shall not relieve any Indemnifying Party of any
liability hereunder, except to the extent that the Indemnifying Party was
actually prejudiced by such failure.

Section 11.4 Defense of Third Party Claims.

(a) Except with respect to Taxes that are governed by Section 11.2(d), if any
lawsuit, action, proceeding, investigation, claim or enforcement action is
initiated against an


 

--- 
| | 

2844184.4 01

|

59 Indemnified Party by any third party (each, a "Third Party Claim") for which
indemnification under this Article 11 may be sought, Notice thereof, together
with copies of all notices and communication relating to such Third Party
Claim, shall be given to the Indemnifying Party as promptly as practicable.
The failure of any Indemnified Party to give timely Notice hereunder shall not
affect rights to indemnification hereunder, except to the extent that the
Indemnifying Party was actually prejudiced by such failure.

(b) If it so elects, at its own cost, risk and expense, the Indemnifying Party
shall be entitled to:

(i) take control of the defense and investigation of such Third Party Claim at
its sole cost and expense if the Indemnifying Party notifies the Indemnified
Party in writing that the Indemnifying Party will indemnify the Indemnified
Party for any Damages related to the Third Party Claim;

(ii) employ and engage attorneys of its own choice (provided that such
attorneys are reasonably acceptable to the Indemnified Party) to handle and
defend the same, unless the named parties to such action or proceeding include
both one or more Indemnifying Parties and an Indemnified Party, and the
Indemnified Party has reasonably concluded that there may be one or more legal
defenses or defense strategies available to such Indemnified Party that are
different from or additional to those available to an applicable Indemnifying
Party or that there exists or is reasonably likely to exist a conflict of
interest, in which event such Indemnified Party shall be entitled, at the
Indemnifying Parties' reasonable cost, risk and expense, to separate counsel
(provided that such counsel is reasonably acceptable to the Indemnifying
Party); and

(iii) compromise or settle such Third Party Claim, which compromise or
settlement shall be made (x) only with the written consent of the Indemnified
Party, such consent not to be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed,
or (y) if such compromise or settlement contains an unconditional release of
the Indemnified Party in respect of such claim, without any cost, liability or
admission of wrongdoing of any nature whatsoever to or by such Indemnified
Party, and provides only for monetary damages that will be paid in full by the
Indemnifying Party.

(c) If the Indemnifying Party elects to assume the defense of a Third Party
Claim, the Indemnified Party shall reasonably cooperate with the Indemnifying
Party and its attorneys in the investigation, trial and defense of such Third
Party Claim and any appeal arising therefrom; provided, however, that the
Indemnified Party may, at its own cost, participate in the investigation,
trial and defense of such lawsuit or action and any appeal arising therefrom.
The parties shall reasonably cooperate with each other in any notifications to
insurers.

(d) If the Indemnifying Party fails to assume the defense of such Third Party
Claim within fifteen (15) calendar days after receipt of the Notice, the
Indemnified Party against which such Third Party Claim has been asserted will
have the right to undertake, at the Indemnifying Parties' reasonable cost,
risk and expense, the defense, compromise or settlement of such Third Party
Claim on behalf of and for the account and risk of the Indemnifying Parties;
provided, however, that such Third Party Claim shall not be compromised or
settled without the written consent of the Indemnifying Party, which consent
shall not be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed.


 

--- 
| | 

2844184.4 01

|

60 (e) If the Indemnified Party assumes the defense of the Third Party Claim, the
Indemnified Party will keep the Indemnifying Party reasonably informed of the
progress of any such defense, compromise or settlement.

(f) This Section 11.4 shall not apply to any claim with respect to Taxes that
are governed by Section 11.2(d), which shall be governed exclusively by
Section 11.8(c).

Section 11.5 Limitations on Indemnity.

(a) No Buyer Indemnified Party shall seek, or be entitled to, indemnification
from any of the Indemnifying Parties pursuant to Section 11.2(a)(i) hereof
(other than with respect to a breach of any Fundamental Representation,
Section 6.5 (Taxes), Section 6.12 (Labor Matters), or any claim based on fraud
or willful misconduct) to the extent the aggregate claims for Damages of the
Buyer Indemnified Parties for which indemnification is sought pursuant to
Section 11.2(a)(i) hereof (other than with respect to a breach of any
Fundamental Representation, Section 6.5 (Taxes), or any claim based on fraud
or willful misconduct) are less than Two Million Dollars ($2,000,000.00) (the
"Deductible") or exceed an amount equal to Thirty-Five Million Dollars
($35,000,000.00) (the "Cap"); provided, that, if the aggregate of all claims
for Damages for which indemnification is sought pursuant to Section 11.2(a)(i)
hereof (other than with respect to a breach of any Fundamental Representation,
Section 6.5 (Taxes), or any claim based on fraud or willful misconduct) equals
or exceeds the Deductible, then the Buyer Indemnified Parties shall be
entitled to recover for such Damages, subject to the limitations in Section
11.5(b), only to the extent such Damages exceed the Deductible, but in any
event not to exceed the Cap.

(b) In addition to, and subject to, the limitations set forth in Section
11.5(a), no Buyer Indemnified Party shall seek, or be entitled to,
indemnification from any of the Indemnifying Parties pursuant to Section
11.2(a)(i) hereof to the extent any individual claim or series of related
individual claims for Damages of the Buyer Indemnified Parties for which
indemnification is sought pursuant to Section 11.2(a)(i) hereof is less than
Seventy-Five Thousand Dollars ($75,000.00), at which time, subject to the
limitation set forth herein, the Buyer Indemnified Party shall be entitled to
indemnification for the full amount of all such Damages from and including the
first dollar of such Damages, and all such Damages shall count towards the
satisfaction of the Deductible.

(c) In calculating the amount of any Damages payable to a Buyer Indemnified
Party or a Seller Indemnified Party hereunder, the amount of the Damages (i)
shall not be duplicative of any other Damage for which an indemnification
claim has been made and (ii) shall be computed net of any amounts actually
recovered by such Indemnified Party under any insurance policy with respect to
such Damages (net of any costs and expenses incurred in obtaining such
insurance proceeds). An Indemnified Party shall use commercially reasonable
efforts to recover insurance proceeds in respect of such claim. If an
Indemnifying Party pays an Indemnified Party for a claim and subsequently
insurance proceeds in respect of such claim are collected by the Indemnified
Parties, then the Indemnified Party promptly shall remit the insurance
proceeds (net of any costs and expenses incurred in obtaining such insurance
proceeds) up to the amount paid by the Indemnifying Party to the Indemnified
Party. The Indemnified Parties shall use commercially reasonable efforts to
obtain from any applicable insurance company any insurance proceeds in respect
of any claim for which the Indemnified Parties seek indemnification under this
Article 11.


 

--- 
| | 

2844184.4 01

|

61 (d) No Damages may be claimed under Section 11.2 by any Indemnified Party to
the extent such Damages are included in the calculation of the Estimated
Closing Payment or the Final Closing Payment.

(e) For purposes of determining the amount of any Damages pursuant to this
Article 11, (i) any inaccuracy in or breach of any representation or warranty
shall be determined without regard to any materiality, Company Material
Adverse Effect or other similar qualification contained in or otherwise
applicable to such representation or warranty and (ii) any inaccuracy in or
breach of Section 6.9(a)(ii) or Section 6.12(b)(ii)(y) shall be determined
without regard to the Seven Hundred Fifty Thousand Dollar ($750,000) threshold
contained therein. For the avoidance of doubt, all materiality, Company
Material Adverse Effect, dollar thresholds and other qualifications shall be
respected for purposes of determining whether there has been any inaccuracy in
or breach of any representation or warranty.

(f) The representations, warranties and covenants of the Indemnifying Party,
and the Indemnified Party's right to indemnification with respect thereto,
shall not be affected or deemed waived by reason of any investigation made by
or on behalf of the Indemnified Party (including by any of its
Representatives) or by reason of the fact that the Indemnified Party or any of
its Representatives knew or should have known that any such representation or
warranty is, was or might be inaccurate or by reason of the Indemnified
Party's waiver of any condition set forth in Section 9.2 or Section 9.3, as
applicable.

Section 11.6 Payment of Damages. Except as otherwise permitted in Section
11.8(a), an Indemnified Party shall be paid in cash by an Indemnifying Party
the amount to which such Indemnified Party may become entitled by reason of
the provisions of this Article 11, within ten (10) Business Days after such
amount is determined either by mutual agreement of the parties or on the date
on which both such amount and an Indemnified Party's obligation to pay such
amount have been determined by a final judgment of a court or administrative
body having jurisdiction over such proceeding.

Section 11.7 Exclusive Remedy.

(a) After the Closing, except with respect to fraud or willful misconduct, the
indemnities provided in this Article 11 shall constitute the sole and
exclusive remedy of any Indemnified Party for Damages arising out of,
resulting from or incurred in connection with any claims regarding matters
arising under or otherwise relating to this Agreement; provided, however; that
this exclusive remedy for Damages does not preclude a party from bringing an
action for specific performance or other equitable remedy to require a party
to perform its obligations under this Agreement. Without limiting the
foregoing, Buyer, Parent and Sellers each hereby waive (and, by their
acceptance of the benefits under this Agreement, each Buyer Indemnified Party
and Seller Indemnified Party hereby waives), from and after the Closing, any
and all rights, claims and causes of action (other than claims of, or causes
of action arising from, fraud or willful misconduct) such party may have
against the other party arising under or based upon this Agreement or any
schedule, exhibit, disclosure letter, document or certificate delivered in
connection herewith, and no legal action sounding in tort, statute or strict
liability may be maintained by any party (other than a legal action brought
solely to enforce or pursuant to the provisions of this Article 11).
Notwithstanding

2844184.4 01

|

62 anything to the contrary in this Section 11.7, in the event of a fraudulent or
willful breach of the representations, warranties, covenants or agreements
contained herein, by Buyer, Parent or Sellers, any Indemnified Party shall
have all remedies available at law or in equity (including for tort) with
respect thereto.

(b) Without limiting the foregoing, the Buyer Indemnified Parties and the
Seller Indemnified Parties hereby waive and agree not to seek (whether under
any Environmental Law or otherwise) any statutory or common law remedy
(whether for contribution, equitable indemnity or otherwise) against any
Indemnifying Party with regard to any Environmental Condition or Environmental
Liability, except solely in accordance with the exclusive remedy provided in
this Article 11.

Section 11.8 Tax Matters.

(a) Treatment of Indemnification Payments. All indemnification payments made
pursuant to this Article 11 shall be treated by the parties for income Tax
purposes as adjustments to the purchase price, unless (i) otherwise required
pursuant to a "determination" (as defined in Section 1313(a) of the Code or
any similar provision of state, local or foreign Law) or (ii) Buyer and
Sellers shall otherwise agree in writing.

(b) Tax Returns.

(i) Sellers shall prepare or cause to be prepared all Tax Returns required to
be filed by, with respect to or that include any of the Companies with respect
to taxable periods of the Companies ending on or before the Closing Date (the
"Pre-Closing Separate Tax Returns"), and such Pre-Closing Separate Tax
Returns, to the extent they relate to any of the Companies, shall be prepared
consistent with the Companies' past practices and this Agreement, except as
otherwise required by applicable Law. Sellers shall file or cause to be filed
all Pre-Closing Separate Tax Returns that are required to be filed on or
before the Closing Date, and Sellers shall pay, or cause to be paid, all such
Taxes shown as due on such Tax Returns. To the extent Buyer is liable for such
Taxes under Section 8.9, Buyer shall promptly reimburse Sellers. Buyer shall
file or cause to be filed all Pre-Closing Separate Tax Returns for the
Companies (to the extent such Tax Returns need to be filed by the Companies)
that are prepared by Sellers pursuant to the first sentence of this Section
11.8(b)(i) that are due after the Closing Date and, subject to the other
provisions in this Agreement, shall pay or cause to be paid all Taxes shown as
due on such Pre-Closing Separate Tax Returns. Sellers shall pay to Buyer no
later than three (3) Business Days prior to the due date for filing any Pre-
Closing Separate Tax Return referenced in the preceding sentence, the amount
of Taxes shown as due on such Pre-Closing Separate Tax Returns, except to the
extent the amount shown represents Taxes for which Buyer is liable under
Section 8.9 or to the extent such Taxes were taken into account in the
determination of the Estimated Closing Payment or Final Closing Payment.
Sellers shall provide Buyer a copy of each such Pre-Closing Separate Tax
Return, other than any consolidated or combined Tax Return which Parent is
responsible for filing, for its review and comment a reasonable number of days
prior to the due date (including any applicable extension) of such Tax Return,
(which reasonable time period shall in no event be less than ten (10) Business
Days), and Sellers shall reasonably consider any written comments of Buyer
received prior to filing such Pre-Closing Separate Tax Return. If the
Companies are permitted under any applicable income

63 Tax Law to treat the Closing Date as the last day of the taxable period in
which the Closing occurs, Buyer and Sellers shall treat (and shall cause their
respective Affiliates to treat) the Closing Date as the last day of such
taxable period.

(ii) Buyer shall prepare or cause to be prepared all Tax Returns of the
Companies for taxable periods starting on or before the Closing Date and
ending after the Closing Date (each, a "Straddle Period"), and shall cause
such Tax Returns to be prepared consistent with past practices, except as
otherwise required by applicable Law. The Companies shall file or cause to be
filed all such Tax Returns for any Straddle Period and, subject to the other
provisions in this Agreement, shall pay or cause to be paid all Taxes shown as
due on such Tax Returns. Sellers shall pay to Buyer no later than three (3)
Business Days prior to the due date for filing any Tax Return for any Straddle
Period the amount of Taxes owing with respect to the Pre-Closing Period
pursuant to clause (iii) below, except to the extent such Taxes were taken
into account in the determination of the Estimated Closing Payment or Final
Closing Payment. Buyer shall provide Sellers a copy of each such Tax Return
for their review and comment a reasonable number of days prior to the due date
(including any applicable extension) of such Tax Return, and Buyer shall
reasonably consider any written comments of Sellers received by Buyer prior to
filing such Tax Return.

(iii) For purposes of the indemnity provisions of this Agreement, in the case
of any Taxes that are imposed on a periodic basis and are payable for a
Straddle Period, the portion of such Tax related to the Pre-Closing Period
shall (A) in the case of any Taxes other than gross receipts, employment,
sales or use Taxes, Taxes based upon or related to income and other similar
Taxes, be deemed to be the amount of such Tax for the entire Straddle Period
(excluding any reassessment arising out of any event occurring on or after the
Closing Date) multiplied by a fraction the numerator of which is the number of
days in the Pre-Closing Period and the denominator of which is the number of
days in the entire Straddle Period, and (B) in the case of any Tax based upon
or related to income and any gross receipts, employment, sales or use Tax and
other similar Taxes, be deemed equal to the amount which would be payable if
the relevant Tax period ended on and included the Closing Date.

(c) Tax Contest. Buyer or Sellers, as applicable, shall promptly notify
Sellers or Buyer, as applicable, in writing upon receipt by Buyer (or,
following the Closing, the Companies) or Sellers, as applicable, of a written
notice of any audit or administrative or judicial proceeding with respect to
Taxes of the Companies which Sellers or Buyer, as applicable, may be
responsible for pursuant to Section 11.2(d) (a "Tax Claim"); provided,
however, no failure or delay by Buyer or Sellers, as applicable, to provide
notice of a Tax Claim shall reduce or otherwise affect the obligation of
Sellers or Buyer, as applicable, hereunder except to the extent Sellers or
Buyer, as applicable, is actually prejudiced thereby. Buyer and Sellers shall
reasonably cooperate with each other in the conduct of any Tax Claim. Sellers
shall have the right to control the conduct of any Tax Claim for a period that
ends on or prior to the Closing Date if Sellers provide Buyer with notice of
their election to control such claim within twenty (20) days after Buyer
giving notice to Sellers of such Tax Claim. If Sellers do not elect to control
any such Tax Claim within the time period set forth above, then Buyer shall be
entitled to control all aspects of such claim. Buyer shall control any Tax
Claim for a period that begins before and ends after the Closing Date. If the
resolution of any Tax Claim for any Pre-Closing Period or Straddle Period
could be reasonably likely to have an adverse effect on the party that is not
in control of such claim, (A) the party in control of such claim


 

--- 
| | 

2844184.4 01

|

64 shall keep the other party reasonably informed regarding the progress and
substantive aspects of such Tax Claim, (B) the other party shall be entitled
to participate in any proceedings with respect to such Tax Claim and (C) the
party in control of such claim shall not compromise or settle any such Tax
Claim without obtaining the other party's prior written consent, which consent
shall not be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed. Notwithstanding
anything to the contrary in this Agreement, Buyer shall have the right to
exclusively control the conduct of any audit or administrative or judicial
proceeding with respect to the Companies for any taxable period other than a
Straddle Period beginning after the Closing Date.

(d) Cooperation. Buyer and Sellers shall reasonably cooperate, as and to the
extent reasonably requested by the other party, in connection with the filing
of Tax Returns and any audit, litigation or other proceeding with respect to
Taxes of the Companies. Such cooperation shall include the retention and (upon
the other party's request, provided that the other party provides
reimbursement for all reasonable out of pocket expenses) the provision of
records and information reasonably relevant to any such audit, litigation or
other proceeding and making employees available on a mutually convenient basis
to provide additional information and explanation of any material provided
hereunder. Each of Buyer and Sellers shall (i) retain all books and records in
its (or its Affiliate's) possession after the Closing with respect to Tax
matters pertinent to the Companies relating to any taxable period beginning
before the Closing Date until expiration of the statute of limitations (taking
into account any extensions thereof) of the respective taxable periods and
(ii) give the other party reasonable written notice prior to transferring,
destroying or discarding any such books and records and, if the other party so
requests, shall allow the requesting party to take possession of such books
and records.

(e) Certain Actions After Closing. Neither Buyer nor any of its Affiliates
(including, after the Closing, the Companies) shall, without the prior written
consent of Sellers (such consent not to be unreasonably withheld, conditioned
or delayed), (i) make or change any Tax election of any Company for a taxable
period (or portion thereof) ending on or before the Closing Date, (ii) amend,
refile or otherwise modify (or grant an extension of any applicable statute of
limitations with respect to) any Tax Return of the Companies for a taxable
period (or portion thereof) ending on or before the Closing Date, or (iii)
cause any Company to engage in any transaction on the Closing Date after the
Closing that is outside of the ordinary course of business, except for the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement; in each case, except for any
action that would not, individually or in the aggregate, have an adverse
effect on Sellers or any of their Affiliates (including, with respect to a
taxable period (or portion thereof) ending on or before the Closing Date, the
Companies) that is material; provided, however, that the parties have agreed
to make a Section 338(h)(10) Election (and a protective election under Section
336(e) of the Code) pursuant to Section 2.3(a).

(f) Tax Sharing Agreements. Sellers shall cause any and all existing Tax
sharing, Tax allocation or similar agreements between Sellers or any of their
Affiliates, on the one hand, and any Company, on the other hand, to be
terminated, and all payables and receivables arising thereunder shall be
settled, in each case prior to the Closing Date such that after the Closing,
neither Buyer nor any Company shall have any further rights or liabilities
thereunder.

65 (g) Tax Refunds. Sellers shall be entitled to any refund (whether by way of
payment or reduction in Taxes otherwise payable in cash) received by Buyer or
the Companies of Taxes in respect of a Pre-Closing Period; provided, however,
that Sellers shall not be entitled to any refund of Taxes to the extent that
such refund is attributable to the carryback of a loss or other Tax attribute
arising in a Post-Closing Period. Except as provided in the foregoing
sentence, Buyer shall be entitled to any other refund of or with respect to
the Companies or with respect to Transfer Taxes paid by Buyer pursuant to
Section 8.9 and not reimbursed by Seller. If any party receives a refund to
which another party is entitled pursuant to this Section 11.8(g), such party
shall pay over such refund (net of costs or Taxes to the party receiving such
refund) to the party entitled to such refund no later than ten (10) Business
Days following receipt of such refund.

Commitments issued to its lenders for the owned Real Property designated on
Section 6.6(a) of the Company Disclosure Letter as Properties 1-22, 25-31 (the

hereby acknowledges receipt of the Existing Title Policies and Title
Commitments as evidence of the status of the Companies' title to the Real
Property as reflected in the Existing Title Policies and the Title Commitments
and acceptance of all matters thereon as Permitted Encumbrances or Permitted
Liens. With respect to the tunnel/pedestrian link connecting Property 1 to the
vestibule, Buyer hereby acknowledges receipt of the Agreements referenced in
Section 6.6(a) of the Company Disclosure Letter pertaining to such link and
the City Encroachment Permit referenced on Section 5.2(c) of Sellers
Disclosure Letter and, subject to receipt of the replacement encroachment
permit referenced in Section 4.2(p) of this Agreement, accepts same as
evidence of the Company's title to the tunnel/pedestrian link. With respect to
the vacated streets listed on Section 6.6(a) of the Company Disclosure Letter,
Buyer may obtain an Owner's title insurance policy at Buyer's sole cost and
expense.

(b) Sellers and Buyer shall split the cost of a new Owner's Title Insurance
Policy, provided that Sellers maximum payment for the new Owner's Title
Insurance Policy shall not exceed the sum of Fifty Thousand Dollars ($50,000)
and Buyer shall be responsible for all costs and expenses in excess of
$100,000. Such new Owner's Title Insurance Policy shall be in an amount

referenced on Schedule 6.6(a) on the Company Disclosure Letter including a
non-imputation endorsement, if available, (the "Closing Title Policy"), which

(c) In the event that any new liens or encumbrances to the title to the owned
Real Property other than the Permitted Encumbrances or the Permitted Liens
shall be created or appear

66 on the title to the owned Real Property that unreasonably interfere with or
impair the ability to use the owned Real Property as presently constructed and
located on the owned Real Property, materially diminish the value of the owned
Real Property or any other matter which would render title to the owned Real
Property uninsurable and unmarketable, Sellers shall cause such liens or
encumbrances to be removed from title prior to the Closing Date and, if
Sellers shall fail to cause such matters to be removed, Buyer may cause such
matters to be removed from title, and Buyer shall receive a credit against the
Purchase Price at Closing equal to the cost of having such matters removed
from title.

Section 12.2 Survey. Section 12.2 of the Company Disclosure Letter sets forth
the most current ALTA Surveys for the owned Real Property designated on
Section 6.6(a) of the Company Disclosure Letter as Property Numbers 1, 5-9,

Property designated on Schedule 6.6(a) on the Company Disclosure Letter as
Property numbers 1-4, 5-7, 8-9, and 13-22 (the "Lender's Surveys"), copies of
which have been made available to Buyer. Buyer agrees to accept the Real
Property subject to all matters shown by the Existing Surveys and the Lender's
Surveys. Sellers shall cause the Lender's Surveys (or the most recent Existing
Survey, if there is no Lender's Survey) to be updated and recertified to the
respective Companies no more than thirty (30) days and not less than five (5)
days prior to the Closing Date, at Buyer's option and at Buyer's sole expense
such that Buyer shall receive current, certified ALTA surveys with respect to
all Real Property identified in Section 6.6(a) of the Company Disclosure
Letter (the "Surveys"). Buyer may obtain a survey on Property 10 at its sole
cost and expense. Except as set forth in Section 12.2 of the Company
Disclosure Letter, if a recertified updated Lender's Survey reveals any
matters not already shown on the Existing Surveys that would materially and
adversely affect the ability to use the Real Property as presently constructed
and located on the Real Property, materially diminish the value of the Real
Property or any other matter which would render title to the Real Property
uninsurable and unmarketable, Sellers shall correct such condition prior to
the Closing, at Sellers' sole cost and expense. Buyer acknowledges that there
is no survey for the Real Property designated as Property 10 on Section 6.6(a)
of the Company Disclosure Letter.

69 this Section 12.5, no dates in this Agreement will be extended as a result

Section 13.2 Governing Law; Consent to Jurisdiction; Waiver of Trial by Jury;
Limitation on Damages.

(a) This Agreement and the transactions contemplated hereby, and all disputes
between the parties under or related to this Agreement or the facts and
circumstances leading to its execution, whether in contract, tort or
otherwise, shall be governed by and construed in accordance with the Laws of
the State of Delaware applicable to contracts executed in and to be performed
entirely within the State of Delaware, without regard to the conflicts of laws
principles thereof.

(b) Each of the parties hereto hereby irrevocably and unconditionally submits,
for itself and its property, to the exclusive jurisdiction of the Federal
District Court for the District of Delaware (and appellate courts from any of
the foregoing) as the party instituting such suit, action or proceeding may,
in its sole discretion, elect, in any action or proceeding arising out of or
relating to this Agreement or the agreements delivered in connection herewith
or the transactions contemplated hereby or thereby or for recognition or
enforcement of any judgment relating thereto, and each of the parties hereby
irrevocably and unconditionally (i) agrees not to commence any such action or
proceeding except in such court, (ii) agrees that any claim in respect of any
such action or proceeding may be heard and determined in such court, (iii)
waives, to the fullest extent it may legally and effectively do so, any
objection which it may now or hereafter have to the laying of venue of any
such action or proceeding in such court, (iv) waives, to the fullest extent
permitted by Law, the defense of an inconvenient forum to the maintenance of
such action or proceeding in such court, and (v) to the extent such party is
not otherwise subject to service of process in the State of Delaware, appoints
Corporation Service Company as such party's agent in the State of Delaware for
acceptance of legal process and agrees that service made on any such agent
shall have the same legal force and effect as if served upon such party
personally within such state. Each of the parties hereto agrees that a final
judgment in any such action or proceeding shall be conclusive and may be
enforced in other jurisdictions by suit on the judgment or in any other manner
provided by Law. Each party to this Agreement irrevocably consents to service
of process in the manner provided for notices in Section 13.3 hereof. Nothing
in this Agreement will affect the right of any party to this Agreement to
serve process in any other manner permitted by Law.

(c) EACH PARTY ACKNOWLEDGES AND AGREES THAT ANY CONTROVERSY WHICH MAY ARISE
UNDER THIS AGREEMENT IS LIKELY TO INVOLVE COMPLICATED AND DIFFICULT ISSUES,
AND THEREFORE IT HEREBY IRREVOCABLY AND UNCONDITIONALLY WAIVES ANY RIGHT IT
MAY HAVE TO A TRIAL BY JURY IN RESPECT OF ANY LITIGATION DIRECTLY OR
INDIRECTLY ARISING OUT OF OR

85 RELATING TO THIS AGREEMENT AND ANY OF THE AGREEMENTS DELIVERED IN CONNECTION
HEREWITH OR THE TRANSACTIONS CONTEMPLATED HEREBY OR THEREBY. EACH PARTY
CERTIFIES AND ACKNOWLEDGES THAT (i) NO REPRESENTATIVE, AGENT OR ATTORNEY OF
ANY OTHER PARTY HAS REPRESENTED, EXPRESSLY OR OTHERWISE, THAT SUCH OTHER PARTY
WOULD NOT, IN THE EVENT OF LITIGATION, SEEK TO ENFORCE EITHER OF SUCH WAIVERS,
(ii) IT UNDERSTANDS AND HAS CONSIDERED THE IMPLICATIONS OF SUCH WAIVERS, (iii)
IT MAKES SUCH WAIVERS VOLUNTARILY, AND (iv) IT HAS BEEN INDUCED TO ENTER INTO
THIS AGREEMENT BY, AMONG OTHER THINGS, THE MUTUAL WAIVERS AND CERTIFICATIONS
IN THIS Section 13.2(c).

(d) The parties hereby acknowledge and agree that, in the circumstances where
Sellers are entitled to under this Agreement pursue a specific performance
remedy, the failure of Buyer or any of Buyer's Affiliates to perform its
agreements and covenants hereunder, including the failure to take all actions
as are necessary on its part to consummate the transactions contemplated
hereby, will cause irreparable injury to Sellers, for which damages, even if
available, will not be an adequate remedy. Accordingly, except as otherwise
limited by this Agreement, Buyer on behalf of itself and its Affiliates agrees
that Sellers shall be entitled to seek an injunction or injunctions in the
circumstances where Sellers are entitled under this Agreement to pursue a
specific performance remedy in any federal court located in the Federal
District Court for the District of Delaware, without bond or other security.

Section 13.4 Interpretation. When a reference is made in this Agreement to
Sections, Exhibits or Schedules, such reference shall be to a Section or
Exhibit or Schedule of this Agreement unless otherwise indicated. All Exhibits
and Schedules of this Agreement are incorporated herein by reference. The
table of contents and headings contained in this Agreement are for reference
purposes only and shall not affect in any way the meaning or interpretation of
this Agreement. Whenever the words "include," "includes" or "including" are
used in this Agreement they shall be deemed to be followed by the words
"without limitation." The phrase "made available" in this Agreement shall mean
that the information referred to has been made available if requested by the
party to whom such information is to be made available. Buyer, Sellers and
each Company will be referred to herein individually as a "party" and
collectively as "parties" (except where the context otherwise requires).

Section 13.5 Entire Agreement. This Agreement and all documents and
instruments referred to herein constitute the entire agreement and supersede
all prior agreements and understandings, both written and oral, among the
parties with respect to the subject matter hereof, provided that the
Confidentiality Agreement shall remain in full force and effect after the
Closing pursuant to the terms thereof. Each party hereto agrees that, except

2844184.4 01

|

87 any other representations and warranties made by itself or any of its
respective Representatives or other representatives, with respect to the
execution and delivery of this Agreement or the transactions contemplated
hereby, notwithstanding the delivery or disclosure to any of them or their
respective representatives of any documentation or other information with
respect to any one or more of the foregoing.

Section 13.6 Severability. If any term or other provision of this Agreement is
invalid, illegal or incapable of being enforced by any rule of Law or public
policy, all other conditions and provisions of this Agreement shall
nevertheless remain in full force and effect so long as the economic or legal
substance of the transactions contemplated hereby is not affected in any
manner materially adverse to any party. Upon such determination that any term
or other provision is invalid, illegal or incapable of being enforced, the
parties hereto shall negotiate in good faith to modify this Agreement so as to
effect the original intent of the parties as closely as possible in an
acceptable manner to the end that transactions contemplated hereby are
fulfilled to the extent possible.

Section 13.7 Assignment. Without the prior written consent of the other party,
neither this Agreement nor any of the rights, interests or obligations
hereunder shall be assigned by operation of Law or otherwise; provided,
however, Buyer may assign any of its rights in whole or in part to one or more
of Tropicana, or any of its direct or indirect wholly owned Subsidiaries if it
has obtained written consent of Sellers, not to be unreasonably withheld,
conditioned or delayed; provided, further that no such assignment shall
relieve Buyer of any of its obligations hereunder. Any assignment in violation
of the preceding sentence shall be void, and no assignment shall relieve the
assigning party of any of its obligations hereunder.

Section 13.8 Parties of Interest. Except as set forth in Article 11 hereof,
this Agreement shall be binding upon and inure solely to the benefit of each
party hereto and their respective successors and assigns, and nothing in this
Agreement, express or implied is intended to or shall confer upon any other
Person any right, benefit or remedy of any nature whatsoever under or by
reason of this Agreement.

Section 13.9 Counterparts. This Agreement may be executed by facsimile or
electronic mail transmission and/or in one or more counterparts, and by the
different parties hereto in separate counterparts, each of which when executed
shall be deemed to be an original but all of which taken together shall
constitute one and the same agreement.

Section 13.10 Mutual Drafting. Each party hereto has participated in the
drafting of this Agreement, which each party acknowledges is the result of
extensive negotiations between the parties. In the event that any ambiguity or
question of intent arises, this Agreement shall be construed as if drafted
jointly by the parties, and no presumption or burden of proof shall arise
favoring or disfavoring any party by virtue of the authorship of any of the
provisions of this Agreement.

Section 13.11 Amendment. This Agreement may not be amended except by an
instrument in writing signed on behalf of each of Buyer and Sellers.

Section 13.12 Non-Recourse. This Agreement may only be enforced against, and
any Action based upon, arising out of, or related to this Agreement, or the
negotiation, execution or

assigns, shall have any liability for any obligations or liabilities of any
party hereto under this Agreement or for any claim or action based on, in
respect of or by reason of the transactions contemplated hereby.

Sellers and the Companies by action taken or authorized by their respective
boards of directors, managing members, or equivalent governing body or Person
may, to the extent legally allowed (i) extend the time for or waive the
performance of any of the obligations or other acts of the other parties
hereto, (ii) waive any inaccuracies in the representations and warranties
contained herein or in any document delivered pursuant hereto, or (iii) waive
compliance with any of the agreements or conditions contained herein. Any
agreement on the part of a party hereto to any such extension or waiver shall
be valid only if set forth in a written instrument signed on behalf of such
party.

Agreement and all terms, provisions, covenants and conditions hereof.

IN WITNESS WHEREOF, the undersigned have caused this Agreement to be signed by
