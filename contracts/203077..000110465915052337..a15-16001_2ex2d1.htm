 **AGREEMENT**

 



 

NOW, THEREFORE, in consideration of the mutual covenants and premises
contained in this Agreement and for other good and valuable consideration, the
receipt and adequacy of which are hereby acknowledged, the parties to this
Agreement, intending to be legally bound, agree as follows:

 



 

 **ARTICLE 1 
THE MERGER**

 



 

1.1 _The Merger_.

 



 

(a) Upon the terms and subject to the conditions set forth in this Agreement,
and in accordance with the CGCL, at the Effective Time, Merger Sub will be
merged with and into the Company. As a result of the Merger, the separate
corporate existence of Merger Sub will cease, and the Company will continue as
the surviving corporation of the Merger (the " _Surviving Corporation_ "). The
Merger will have the effects set forth in the applicable provisions of the
CGCL. Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, at the Effective Time,
all of the property, rights, privileges, immunities, powers and franchises of
the Company and Merger Sub will vest in the Surviving Corporation, and all of
the debts, liabilities and duties of the Company and Merger Sub will become
the debts, liabilities and duties of the Surviving Corporation.

 



 

(b) At the Effective Time, the articles of incorporation of the Surviving
Corporation will, by virtue of the Merger, be amended so as to read in its
entirety in the form set forth as _Exhibit A_ hereto, until thereafter
changed or amended as provided therein or by applicable Law. In addition, the
Company and the Surviving Corporation will take all necessary action such
that, at the Effective Time, the bylaws of the Surviving Corporation will be
amended so as to read in its entirety in the form set forth as _Exhibit B_
hereto, until thereafter changed or amended as provided therein or by
applicable Law.

 



 

(c) The directors of Merger Sub immediately prior to the Effective Time will,
from and after the Effective Time, be the initial directors of the Surviving
Corporation, each to hold office in accordance with the articles of
incorporation and bylaws of the Surviving Corporation until their respective
successors have been duly elected, designated or qualified, or until their
earlier death, resignation or removal in accordance with the articles of
incorporation and bylaws of the Surviving Corporation. The officers of the
Company immediately prior to the Effective Time, from and after the Effective
Time, will continue as the officers of the Surviving Corporation, each to hold
office in accordance with the articles of incorporation and bylaws of the
Surviving Corporation until their respective successors have been duly
elected, designated or qualified, or until their earlier death, resignation or
removal in accordance with the articles of incorporation and bylaws of the
Surviving Corporation; _provided_ , _however_ , that the Company will appoint
and remove and replace, effective as of the Effective Time, any officers (in
their capacity as such) as designated in writing by Parent.

 



 

(d) If at any time after the Effective Time, the Surviving Corporation
determines, in its sole discretion, or is advised, that any deeds, bills of
sale, instruments of conveyance, assignments, assurances or any other actions
or things are necessary or desirable to vest, perfect or confirm of record or
otherwise in the Surviving Corporation its right, title or interest in, to or
under any of the rights, properties or assets of either of the Company or
Merger Sub acquired or to be acquired by the Surviving Corporation as a result
of, or in connection with, the Merger or otherwise to carry out this
Agreement, then the officers and directors of the Surviving Corporation shall
be authorized to execute and deliver, in the name and on behalf of either the
Company or Merger Sub, all such deeds, bills of sale, instruments of
conveyance, assignments and assurances and to take and do, in the name and on
behalf of

 



      
 

 



 

each of such corporations or otherwise, all such other actions and things as
may be necessary or desirable to vest, perfect or confirm any and all right,
title or interest in, to and under such rights, properties or assets in the
Surviving Corporation or otherwise to carry out this Agreement.

 



 

1.2 _Closing and Effective Time of the Merger_. The closing of the Merger (the
" _Closing_ ") will take place at the offices of Latham and Watkins LLP, 140
Scott Drive, Menlo Park, California at 7:00 a.m., Pacific time, on a date to
be specified by the parties, such date to be no later than the second Business
Day after satisfaction or waiver of all of the conditions set forth in
_Article 6_ (other than those conditions that by their nature are to be
satisfied at the Closing, but subject to the fulfillment or waiver of those
conditions at the Closing), unless another time, date or place is agreed to in
writing by the parties hereto. The date on which the Closing occurs is
referred to in this Agreement as the " _Closing Date_." On the Closing Date,
or on such other date as Parent and the Company may agree to in writing,
Parent, Merger Sub and the Company will cause an agreement of merger in the
form attached hereto as _Exhibit C_, subject to such changes as may be
mutually agreed to by Parent and the Company (the " _Agreement of Merger_ "),
together with an officers certificate satisfying the applicable requirements
of the CGCL, to be executed and filed with the Secretary of State of the State
of California in accordance with the relevant provisions of the CGCL. The
Merger will become effective at the time the Agreement of Merger will have
been duly filed with the Secretary of State of the State of California or such
other date and time as is agreed upon by the parties and specified in the
Agreement of Merger, such date and time hereinafter referred to as the "
_Effective Time_."

 



 

 **ARTICLE 2 
CONVERSION OF SECURITIES IN THE MERGER**

 



 

2.1 _Conversion of Securities_. At the Effective Time, by virtue of the Merger
and without any action on the part of Parent, Merger Sub, the Company or the
holders of any of the following securities:

 



 

(a) _Conversion of the Shares_. Each Share issued and outstanding immediately
prior to the Effective Time (other than Shares to be cancelled in accordance
with _Section 2.1(b)_ and other than Dissenting Shares) will be converted
into the right to receive the Merger Consideration, payable net to the holder
in cash, without interest and subject to deduction for any required
withholding Tax pursuant to _Section 2.2(g)_, in accordance with the
procedures set forth in _Section 2.2_. At the Effective Time, all of the
Shares shall cease to be outstanding, shall be cancelled and shall cease to
exist, and each Certificate that immediately prior to the Effective Time
represented any of the Shares (other than Shares to be cancelled in accordance
with _Section 2.1(b)_ and other than Dissenting Shares) shall thereafter
represent only the right to receive the Merger Consideration, without interest
and subject to deduction for any required withholding Tax pursuant to _Section
2.2(g)_.

 



 

(b) _Cancellation of Treasury Stock and Parent-Owned Stock_. All Shares that
are held in the treasury of the Company or owned of record by any Company
Subsidiary, and all Shares owned of record by Parent, Merger Sub or any of
their respective wholly-owned Subsidiaries, will be cancelled and will cease
to exist, with no payment being made with respect thereto.

 



 

(c) _Merger Sub Common Stock_. Each share of common stock, $0.01 par value, of
Merger Sub (the " _Merger Sub Common Stock_ ") issued and outstanding
immediately prior to the Effective Time will be converted into and become one
newly and validly issued, fully paid and nonassessable share of common stock,
$0.01 par value, of the Surviving Corporation, and such shares shall
constitute the only outstanding shares of capital stock of the Surviving
Corporation. From and after the Effective Time, all certificates representing
Merger Sub Common Stock shall be deemed for all

 



      
 

 



 

purposes to represent the number of shares of common stock of the Surviving
Corporation into which they were converted in accordance with the preceding
sentence.

 



 

(d) _Changes in Stock_. If at any time during the period between the date of
this Agreement and the Effective Time, any change in the outstanding shares of
capital stock of the Company, or securities convertible into or exchangeable
into or exercisable for shares of such capital stock, shall occur as a result
of any reclassification, recapitalization, stock split (including a reverse
stock split) or subdivision or combination, exchange or readjustment of
shares, or any stock dividend or stock distribution with a record date during
such period (excluding, in each case, normal quarterly cash dividends), merger
or other similar transaction, the Merger Consideration shall be equitably
adjusted so as to provide Parent and the holder of Shares the same economic
effect as contemplated by this Agreement prior to such event; _provided_ ,
that nothing in this _Section 2.1(d)_ shall be construed to permit the
Company to take any action with respect to its securities that is prohibited
by the terms of this Agreement.

 



 

2.2 _Payment for Securities; Surrender of Certificates_.

 



 

(a) _Paying Agent_. At or prior to the Effective Time, Parent will designate a
reputable bank or trust company, reasonably acceptable to the Company, to act
as the paying agent for purposes of effecting the payment of the Merger
Consideration in connection with the Merger (the " _Paying Agent_ "). At or
immediately after the Effective Time, Parent or Merger Sub will deposit, or
cause to be deposited, with the Paying Agent the aggregate Merger
Consideration to which holders of Shares will be entitled at the Effective
Time pursuant to this Agreement (for the avoidance of doubt, other than Shares
to be cancelled in accordance with _Section 2.1(b)_ and other than Dissenting
Shares) (collectively, the " _Payment Fund_ "). Such funds will be invested by
the Paying Agent as directed by Parent, in its sole discretion, pending
payment thereof by the Paying Agent to the holders of the Shares. Earnings
from such investments will be the sole and exclusive property of Parent, and
no part of such earnings will accrue to the benefit of holders of Shares.

 



 

(b) _Procedures for Surrender_. As promptly as practicable after the Effective
Time (and in any event, within four Business Days thereafter), Parent will
cause the Paying Agent to mail to each holder of record of a certificate or
certificates that represented Shares (the " _Certificates_ "), which Shares
were converted into the right to receive the Merger Consideration at the
Effective Time pursuant to this Agreement: (i) a letter of transmittal, which
will specify that delivery will be effected, and risk of loss and title to the
Certificates (if any) will pass, only upon delivery of such Certificates to
the Paying Agent, and will otherwise be in such form and have such other
provisions as Parent or the Paying Agent may reasonably specify and (ii)
instructions for effecting the surrender of the Certificates in exchange for
payment of the Merger Consideration. Upon surrender of Certificates for
cancellation to the Paying Agent or to such other agent or agents as may be
appointed by Parent, and upon delivery of a letter of transmittal, duly
executed and in proper form, with respect to such Certificates, and such other
documents as the Paying Agent may reasonably require, the holder of such
Certificates will be entitled to receive the Merger Consideration for each
Share formerly represented by such Certificates (for the avoidance of doubt,
other than Shares to be cancelled in accordance with _Section 2.1(b)_ and
other than Dissenting Shares). Any Certificates so surrendered will forthwith
be cancelled. All cash paid upon the surrender for exchange of Certificates
will be deemed to have been paid in full satisfaction of all rights pertaining
to Shares formerly represented by such Certificates. Promptly after the
Effective Time and in any event not later than the fourth Business Day
thereafter, the Surviving Corporation shall cause the Paying Agent to issue
and send to each holder of uncertificated Shares represented by book entry ("
_Book-Entry Shares_ "), other than with respect to Shares to be cancelled in
accordance with _Section 2.1(b)_ and other than Dissenting Shares, a check or
wire transfer for the amount of cash that such holder is entitled to receive
pursuant to _Section 2.1(a)_ in respect of such Book-Entry Shares, without
such holder being required to deliver a Certificate or an executed letter of
transmittal to the Paying Agent, and such Book-Entry Shares

 



      
 

 



 

shall then be cancelled. No interest will be paid or accrued for the benefit
of holders of Certificates or Book-Entry Shares on the Merger Consideration
and the Merger Consideration will be subject to deduction for any required
withholding Tax pursuant to _Section 2.2(g)_.

 



 

(c) If payment of the Merger Consideration is to be made to a Person other
than the Person in whose name any surrendered Certificate is registered, it
will be a condition precedent of payment that the Certificate so surrendered
will be properly endorsed or will be otherwise in proper form for transfer,
and the Person requesting such payment will have paid any transfer or similar
Taxes required by reason of the payment of the Merger Consideration to a
Person other than the registered holder of the Certificate so surrendered or
will have established to the satisfaction of the Paying Agent that such Taxes
either have been paid or are not payable. Any other transfer or similar Taxes
incurred in connection with the Merger will be paid by Parent. Payment of the
Merger Consideration with respect to Book-Entry Shares will only be made to
the Person in whose name such Book-Entry Shares are registered. Until
surrendered as contemplated hereby, each Certificate will be deemed at any
time after the Effective Time to represent only the right to receive the
Merger Consideration in cash as contemplated by this Agreement, without
interest.

 



 

(d) _Transfer Books; No Further Ownership Rights in Shares_. At the Effective
Time, the stock transfer books of the Company will be closed and thereafter
there will be no further registration of transfers of Shares on the records of
the Company. From and after the Effective Time, the holders of Certificates
and Book-Entry Shares outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time will
cease to have any rights with respect to such Shares except as otherwise
provided for herein or by applicable Law. If, after the Effective Time,
Certificates are presented to the Surviving Corporation for any reason, then
(subject to compliance with the exchange procedures of _Section 2.2(b)_) they
will be cancelled and exchanged as provided in this Agreement.

 



 

(e) _Termination of Fund; Abandoned Property; No Liability_. At any time
following the date that is nine months after the Effective Time, the Surviving
Corporation will be entitled to require the Paying Agent to deliver to it any
portion of the Payment Fund (including any interest accrued with respect
thereto) not disbursed to holders of Certificates or Book-Entry Shares, and
thereafter such holders will be entitled to look only to the Surviving
Corporation (subject to abandoned property, escheat or other similar Laws)
only as general creditors thereof with respect to the Merger Consideration
payable upon due surrender of their Certificates or Book-Entry Shares and
compliance with the procedures in _Section 2.2(b)_, without interest and
subject to deduction for any required withholding Tax pursuant to _Section
2.2(g)_. If, immediately prior to such time on which any payment in respect
hereof would escheat to or become the property of any Governmental Entity
pursuant to any applicable abandoned property, escheat or similar Laws, any
holder of Certificates or Book-Entry Shares has not complied with the
procedures in _Section 2.2(b)_ to receive payment of the Merger Consideration
to which such holder would otherwise be entitled, the payment in respect of
such Certificates or Book-Entry Shares will, to the extent permitted by
applicable Law, become the property of the Surviving Corporation, free and
clear of all claims or interest of any Person previously entitled thereto.
Notwithstanding the foregoing, neither the Surviving Corporation nor the
Paying Agent will be liable to any holder of a Certificate or Book-Entry
Shares for Merger Consideration delivered to a public official pursuant to any
applicable abandoned property, escheat or similar Law.

 



 

(f) _Lost, Stolen or Destroyed Certificates_. In the event that any
Certificates have been lost, stolen or destroyed, the Paying Agent will issue
in exchange for such lost, stolen or destroyed Certificates, upon the making
of an affidavit of that fact by the holder thereof, in form and substance
reasonably acceptable to Parent, the Merger Consideration payable in respect
thereof pursuant to _Section 2.1(a)_ hereof; _provided_ , _however_ , that
Parent or the Paying Agent may, in its discretion and as a condition precedent
to the payment of such Merger Consideration, require the owners of such lost,

 



      
 

 



 

stolen or destroyed Certificates to deliver a bond in such sum as either of
them may reasonably direct as indemnity against any claim that may be made
against Parent, Merger Sub, the Surviving Corporation or the Paying Agent with
respect to the Certificates alleged to have been lost, stolen or destroyed.

 



 

(g) _Withholding Rights_. Each of Ultimate Parent, Parent, the Surviving
Corporation and the Paying Agent shall be entitled to deduct and withhold from
the consideration otherwise payable pursuant to this Agreement such amounts as
Ultimate Parent, Parent, the Surviving Corporation or the Paying Agent, as the
case may be, is required to deduct and withhold with respect to the making of
such payment under the Code or any other applicable state, local or foreign
Tax Law, and to the extent that amounts are so withheld, such withheld amounts
(i) shall be remitted to the applicable Governmental Entity and (ii) shall be
treated for all purposes of this Agreement as having been paid to the Person
from whom such amounts were withheld.

 



 

2.3 _Dissenting Shares_. Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the
contrary, Shares outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time and held
by a holder who is entitled to demand and has properly demanded that the
Company purchase such Shares for fair market value in accordance with, and who
complies in all respects with, Chapter 13 of the CGCL (such Shares, the "
_Dissenting Shares_ ") will not be converted into the right to receive the
Merger Consideration and will instead represent the right to receive only the
payment as may be determined to be due with respect to such Dissenting Shares
pursuant to Chapter 13 of the CGCL (subject to deduction for any required
withholding Tax pursuant to _Section 2.2(g)_). If any such holder withdraws
such holders demand for purchase of such Dissenting Shares for fair market
value pursuant to Chapter 13 of the CGCL or becomes ineligible for such
payment, then the right of such holder to receive such payment in respect of
such Dissenting Shares will cease and such Dissenting Shares will be deemed to
have been converted, as of the Effective Time, into and will be exchangeable
solely for the right to receive the Merger Consideration, without interest and
subject to deduction for any required withholding Tax pursuant to _Section
2.2(g)_. The Company will give Parent prompt notice of any demands received by
the Company for the purchase of Shares pursuant to Chapter 13 of the CGCL,
attempted withdrawals of such demands and any other instruments served
pursuant to the CGCL and received by the Company relating to rights to be paid
the fair market value of Dissenting Shares, and Parent will have the right to
participate in and direct all negotiations and Proceedings with respect to
such demands. The Company will not, except with the prior written consent of
Parent, make any payment with respect to, or settle or compromise or offer to
settle or compromise, any such demands, or approve any withdrawal of any such
demands, or agree to do any of the foregoing. Any portion of the Merger
Consideration made available to the Paying Agent pursuant to _Section 2.2(a)_
to pay for Shares for which appraisal rights have been perfected as described
in this _Section 2.3_ shall be returned to Parent, upon demand; _provided_ ,
that the parties acknowledge that, notwithstanding anything to the contrary in
this Agreement, Parent shall not be required under this _Section 2.3_ or
otherwise to deposit with the Paying Agent any cash to pay any Merger
Consideration with respect to Shares as to which its holder has purported to
deliver a notice or demand of appraisal that has not been withdrawn prior to
the Closing Date. Parent shall pay additional cash to the Paying Agent to the
extent required to pay the Merger Consideration in respect of the foregoing
Shares if and when such Shares cease to be Dissenting Shares.

 



 

2.4 _Treatment of Company Options and Company RSUs; Stock Plans_.

 



 

(a) _Treatment of Unvested Company Options_. Except as specified in _Section
2.4(a)_ of the Company Disclosure Schedule, prior to the Effective Time, the
Company Board (or, if appropriate, any committee thereof) will adopt
resolutions and take all other actions necessary and appropriate to provide
that, at the Effective Time, each unexpired and unexercised option to purchase
Shares (the " _Company Options_ "), under any stock option plan of the
Company, including the Companys 1997 Stock Option Plan (as amended) and the
Companys Amended and Restated 2006 Incentive Stock

 



       
 

 



 

Plan or any other plan, agreement or arrangement (the " _Company Stock Option
Plans_ "), that is unvested and unexercisable, shall, except as set forth in
such _Section 2.4(a)_ of the Company Disclosure Schedule, cease to represent
the right to purchase Shares and shall be converted into and become an award
of restricted shares of Ultimate Parent common stock (" _Ultimate Parent
Shares_ ") equal to the quotient of (x) the product of (A) the total number of
unvested and unexercisable Shares previously subject to such Company Option
and (B) the excess, if any, of the Merger Consideration over the exercise
price per Share previously subject to such unvested and unexercisable Company
Option, divided by (y) the volume weighted average trading price of Ultimate
Parent Shares on the New York Stock Exchange, calculated to four decimal
places and determined without regard to after-hours trading or any other
trading outside of the regular trading session trading hours, for the five
consecutive trading days ending on the third complete trading day prior to
(and not including) the Closing Date as reported by Bloomberg, L.P., rounded
down to the nearest whole share (each, an " _Assumed Restricted Stock Award_
"); _provided_ , _however_ , that with respect to any such Company Options
that are outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time, and which have
an exercise price greater than the Merger Consideration, such Company Options
shall not be assumed by Ultimate Parent, shall not convert into an Assumed
Restricted Stock Award and shall automatically terminate as of the Effective
Time. From and after the Effective Time, each Assumed Restricted Stock Award
shall (i) be subject to a risk of forfeiture with respect to all of the
Ultimate Parent Shares subject thereto as of the Effective Time, which such
risk of forfeiture shall lapse in accordance with the vesting schedule of the
corresponding Company Option, (ii) be subject to the accelerated vesting terms
set forth on _Section 2.4(a)(i)_ of the Company Disclosure Schedule, (iii) be
administered by Ultimate Parent and the compensation committee of its board of
directors (the " _Ultimate Parent Compensation Committee_ "), which shall be
substituted for the Company and the compensation committee of the Company
Board administering such Company Stock Option Plans. For the avoidance of
doubt, each Assumed Restricted Stock Award shall be solely with respect to
Ultimate Parent Shares and shall no longer be a stock option or have the
features thereof.

 



 

(b) _Treatment of Vested Company Options_. Prior to the Effective Time, the
Company Board (or, if appropriate, any committee thereof) will adopt
resolutions and take all other actions necessary and appropriate to provide
that, with respect to Company Options that are outstanding and vested as of
immediately prior to the Effective Time, will, immediately prior to the
Effective Time, be cancelled and, in exchange therefor, each former holder of
any such cancelled vested Company Option will only be entitled to receive, in
consideration of the cancellation of such vested Company Option and in full
settlement therefor, a payment in cash (without interest, and subject to
deduction for any required withholding Tax pursuant to _Section 2.2(g)_) of
an amount equal to the product of (A) the total number of vested Shares
previously subject to such Company Option and (B) the excess, if any, of the
Merger Consideration over the exercise price per Share previously subject to
such vested Company Option (such amounts payable hereunder being referred to
as the " _Option Payments_ "). For avoidance of doubt, if the exercise price
per Share of any such Company Option is equal to or greater than the Merger
Consideration, such Company Option shall be canceled without any cash payment
being made in respect thereof. From and after the Effective Time, any such
cancelled vested Company Option will no longer be exercisable by the former
holder thereof. Any Option Payment shall be made through the Surviving
Corporations payroll no more than three (3) Business Days following the
Effective Time; _provided_ , _however_ , that Ultimate Parent may, in its sole
discretion, cause the Paying Agent, on behalf of the Surviving Corporation, to
make the payments described in this _Section 2.4(b)_.

 



 

(c) _Treatment of Unvested Company RSUs_. Except as specified in _Section
2.4(c)_ of the Company Disclosure Schedule, prior to the Effective Time, the
Company Board (or, if appropriate, any committee thereof) will adopt
resolutions and take all other actions necessary and appropriate to provide
that, immediately prior to the Effective Time, each outstanding award of
restricted stock units and performance share units granted pursuant to any
Company Stock Option Plan (the " _Company RSUs_ ") that is unvested as of
immediately prior to the Effective Time, shall, except to the

 



      
 

 



 

extent set forth on such _Section 2.4(c)_ of the Company Disclosure Schedule,
cease to represent the right to receive Shares and shall be converted into and
become rights with respect to Ultimate Parent Shares, and Ultimate Parent
shall assume the Company RSUs, on the same terms and conditions (including any
forfeiture provisions or repurchase rights, and treating for this purpose any
performance-based vesting conditions as provided for in the award agreement by
which each Company RSU is evidenced, except that any performance-based vesting
conditions shall be treated as having been attained at the "maximum" level) as
were applicable under such Company RSUs as of immediately prior to the
Effective Time, except that from and after the Effective Time, (i) the
accelerated vesting terms set forth on _Section 2.4(c)(i)_ of the Company
Disclosure Schedule shall apply to such assumed Company RSUs, (ii) Ultimate
Parent and the Ultimate Parent Compensation Committee shall be substituted for
Company and the compensation committee of the Company Board administering such
Company Stock Option Plans, (iii) the Company RSUs assumed by Ultimate Parent
shall represent the right to receive Ultimate Parent Shares upon settlement of
such Company RSU promptly after vesting (except to the extent the terms of the
applicable restricted stock unit agreement provide for deferred settlement, in
which case settlement shall be in accordance with the specified terms), and
(iv) the number of Ultimate Parent Shares subject to each award of Company
RSUs assumed by Ultimate Parent shall be equal to the number of Shares subject
to such award immediately prior to the Effective Time multiplied by a ratio
where the numerator is the Merger Consideration and the denominator is the
volume weighted average trading price of Ultimate Parent Shares on the New
York Stock Exchange, calculated to four decimal places and determined without
regard to after-hours trading or any other trading outside of the regular
trading session trading hours, for the five consecutive trading days ending on
the third complete trading day prior to (and not including) the Closing Date
as reported by Bloomberg, L.P. (the " _Exchange Ratio_ "), rounded down to the
nearest whole share, and in any event Ultimate Parent shall convert any
remaining fractional share into the right to receive cash based on the terms
of _Section 2.1_ (except that in no event shall any vesting restrictions
applicable to a Company RSU be accelerated unless so provided under the terms
of such Company RSU, a Company Stock Option Plan or other Company Benefit
Plan, or as provided on _Section 2.4(c)_ of the Company Disclosure Schedule).

 



 

(d) _Treatment of Vested Company RSUs_. Prior to the Effective Time, the
Company Board (or, if appropriate, any committee thereof) will adopt
resolutions and take all other actions necessary and appropriate to provide
that, each Company RSU that is outstanding and vested as of immediately prior
to the Effective Time (after giving effect to any vesting accelerated in
connection with the Merger) will be cancelled in exchange for the right to
receive a payment (without interest, and subject to deduction for any required
withholding Tax pursuant to _Section 2.2(g)_) equal to the Merger
Consideration with respect to such vested Company RSU (such amounts payable
hereunder being referred to as the " _RSU Payments_ "). Any RSU Payment shall
be made through the Surviving Corporations payroll no more than three (3)
Business Days following the Effective Time; _provided_ , _however_ , that
Ultimate Parent may, in its sole discretion, cause the Paying Agent, on behalf
of the Surviving Corporation, to make the payments described in this _Section
2.4(d)_.

 



 

(e) _Reservation of Shares; Registration Statement_. Ultimate Parent will (i)
reserve the number of Ultimate Parent Shares that will become subject to the
assumed Company Options pursuant to _Section 2.4(a)_ or assumed Company RSUs
pursuant to _Section 2.4(c)_ and (ii) issue or cause to be issued the
appropriate number of Ultimate Parent Shares upon the exercise of the assumed
Company Options or settlement of assumed Company RSUs. No later than the
Effective Time, Ultimate Parent will prepare and file with the Securities
Exchange Commission (the " _SEC_ ") a registration statement on Form S-8 (or
other appropriate form) registering a number of Ultimate Parent Shares
necessary to fulfill Ultimate Parents obligations under this Agreement.
Ultimate Parent will use the same level of efforts Ultimate Parent uses to
maintain the effectiveness of its other registration statements on Form S-8 to
maintain the effectiveness of such registration statement for so long as any
assumed Company Options or assumed Company RSUs remain outstanding.

 



      
 

 



 

(f) _Corporate Actions_. At or prior to the Effective Time, the Company, the
Company Board and the compensation committee of the Company Board, as
applicable, shall adopt any resolutions and take any actions which are
necessary to effectuate the provisions of this _Section 2.4_, including
delivering all required notices (which notices shall have been approved by
Ultimate Parent, in its reasonable discretion) to each holder of Company
Options and Company RSUs setting forth each holders rights pursuant to the
respective Company Stock Option Plan, stating that such Company Options and
Company RSUs shall be treated in the manner set forth in this _Section 2.4_.
The Company shall take all actions necessary to ensure that from and after the
Effective Time neither Ultimate Parent nor the Surviving Corporation will be
required to deliver to any Person any Shares or other Equity Interests of the
Company, the Surviving Corporation or any other Person pursuant to or in
settlement of Company Options, Company RSUs or other rights with respect to
Shares except with respect to the assumed Company Options and the assumed
Company RSUs.

 



 

(g) _Company ESPP_. The Company shall take all actions necessary such that any
current offering period as of the date of this Agreement shall be the final
offering period under the Company ESPP. In addition, effective as of the date
of this Agreement, the Company shall have taken all actions necessary such
that (i) no new participant shall be permitted to join any current offering
period in progress under the Company ESPP and (ii) no participant in the
Company ESPP with respect to any current offering period shall be permitted to
increase his or her contributions or the amount of withholding elections with
respect to any current offering period. Unless it has earlier terminated, the
Company shall take all actions necessary so that the Company ESPP shall
terminate immediately prior to the Effective Time. Prior to the Effective
Time, the Company shall shorten the duration of any then-current offering
period under the Company ESPP and purchase any Shares with all amounts
withheld by the Company on behalf of the participants in the Company ESPP as
of such date. Any Shares so purchased shall be treated in accordance with
_Section 2.1_ above. All amounts withheld by the Company on behalf of the
participants in the Company ESPP that have not been used to purchase Shares at
or prior to the Effective Time will be returned to the participants without
interest and subject to deduction for any required withholding Tax pursuant to
the terms of the Company ESPP upon the termination of the Company ESPP. The
Company agrees to take any and all actions necessary to approve and effectuate
the foregoing provisions of this _Section 2.4(g)_ including making any
determinations and/or resolutions of the Company Board or a committee thereof
and delivering all required notices (which notices shall have been approved by
Parent, in its reasonable discretion) to each Company ESPP participant.

of time, or both): (i) subject to obtaining the Company Shareholder Approval,
conflict with or violate any provision of the Company Articles or Company
Bylaws or any equivalent organizational or governing documents of any Company

authorizations and permits described in _Section 3.5_ have been obtained and
all filings and notifications described in _Section 3.5_ have been made and
any waiting periods thereunder have terminated or expired, constitute or

it under such Company Material Contract; and (iii) none of the Company or any
Company Subsidiary has received written notice of any material violation or

Company Material Contract.

3.17 _Intellectual Property_.

 



 

(a) _General_. _Section 3.17(a)(i)-(iv)_ of the Company Disclosure Schedule
sets forth a list that is accurate and complete in all material respects of
all Intellectual Property Rights that are registered or for which an
application for registration is currently pending with a Governmental Entity
(or, in the case of Internet domain names, are registered with a domain name
registrar) and that are owned by the Company or any Company Subsidiary (the "
_Registered Intellectual Property_ "): (i) for each patent and patent
application, the patent number or application serial number for each
jurisdiction in which the patent or application has been filed, the respective
jurisdiction where filed, the date filed or issued, and the present status
thereof; (ii) for each trademark, trade name or service mark that is
registered, for which a pending application for registration has been filed,
the application serial number or registration number, the jurisdiction where
filed, the date filed or granted, and the class of goods covered, in each
case, if applicable; (iii) for any URL or Internet domain name, the
registration date, any renewal date and name of the Internet domain name
registrar; and (iv) for each copyrighted work for which a registration has
been filed, the registration number, date of registration and the jurisdiction
in which the copyright has been filed. _Section 3.17(a)(v)_ of the Company
Disclosure Schedule sets forth a list that is accurate and complete in all
material respects of all material licenses or covenants not to sue granted to
the Company or any of the Company Subsidiaries under or with respect to
Intellectual Property Rights owned by a third party that (A) claim or cover
the Company Products, (B) are incorporated in or necessary for the design,
manufacture, use, distribution or sale of the Company Products, or are
otherwise material to the business of the Company and the Company Subsidiaries
taken as a whole (" _Licensed Intellectual Property_ "), other than standard,
unmodified, off-the-shelf Software that is licensed in object code form on
non-exclusive basis solely for internal use license and that is commercially
available on standard terms from third-party vendors (e.g., Microsoft
Windows). _Section 3.17(a)(vi)_ of the Company Disclosure Schedule sets forth
a list that is accurate and complete in all material respects of all Contracts
under which any Licensed Intellectual Property is licensed to the Company or
any Company Subsidiary on an exclusive basis (collectively, " _Inbound
Exclusive License Agreements"_ ). All milestones and other conditions set
forth in any Inbound Exclusive License Agreements that are required to be
satisfied in order for the Company or such Company Subsidiary to retain any
exclusive rights granted under such Inbound Exclusive License Agreements have
been timely satisfied such that all such exclusive rights remain in full force
and effect as of the date of this Agreement.

 



 

(b) _Sufficiency_. The Company and the Company Subsidiaries own or have valid
and sufficient rights to use, in the manner currently used, all Intellectual
Property Rights that claim or cover any of the Company Products, or that are
incorporated in or necessary for the design, manufacture, use, distribution or
sale of any of the Company Products or that are otherwise material to the
business of the Company and the Company Subsidiaries taken as a whole
(collectively referred to herein

 



      
 

 



 

as the " _Material Intellectual Property_ "). The Material Intellectual
Property constitutes all material Intellectual Property Rights necessary for
the conduct of the Business as presently conducted, including for the design,
manufacture, use, distribution and sale of the Company Products. Nothing in
this subsection (b) shall be deemed a representation or warranty of non-
infringement of third party Intellectual Property Rights.

 



 

(c) _Ownership; Validity and Enforceability_. The Company or each Company
Subsidiary exclusively owns the Registered Intellectual Property and all other
Intellectual Property Rights purported to be owned by the Company or any
Company Subsidiary, including any Intellectual Property Rights that were
developed by any employees or contractors of the Company or any Company
Subsidiaries for the Company or such Company Subsidiary (collectively, "
_Owned Intellectual Property_ "), free and clear of Liens (other than
Permitted Liens). The Registered Intellectual Property owned by the Company or
any of the Company Subsidiaries and, to knowledge of the Company, all issued
patents, registered copyrights and registered trademarks exclusively licensed
to the Company or any of the Company Subsidiaries under any Inbound Exclusive
License Agreements (" _Exclusively Licensed Registered Intellectual Property_
") are subsisting. To the knowledge of the Company, the Registered
Intellectual Property (excluding any pending applications included in the
Registered Intellectual Property) and the Exclusively Licensed Registered
Intellectual Property are valid and enforceable. To the knowledge of the
Company, neither the Company nor any of the Company Subsidiaries has taken any
action or failed to take any action that would reasonably be expected to
result in the abandonment, cancellation, forfeiture, relinquishment,
invalidation or unenforceability of any of the material Registered
Intellectual Property (including any of the foregoing that covers or claims
any Company Product), and all filing, examination, issuance, post registration
and maintenance fees, annuities and the like that have come due and are
required to maintain, preserve or renew any such material Registered
Intellectual Property have been timely paid. With respect to the material
Registered Intellectual Property to the Company or any of the Company
Subsidiaries, there are no filings, payments or other actions that were
required to have been or are required to be made or taken by January 31, 2016,
including the payment of any registration, maintenance or renewal fees or the
filing of any responses to office actions, documents, applications or
certificates, for the purposes of complying with legal requirements to obtain,
maintain, preserve or renew any such Registered Intellectual Property.

 



 

(d) _Absence of Claims; Non-infringement_. No Proceedings have been instituted
in the last three years or are pending, or to the knowledge of the Company are
threatened against, the Company or any Company Subsidiary, that challenge the
Companys or any Company Subsidiarys ownership of any Owned Intellectual
Property or right to use any Licensed Intellectual Property. To the knowledge
of the Company, no Proceeding, including any interference, opposition,
reissue, reexamination, derivation, post-grant or other similar Proceeding, is
or has been pending or threatened, in which the scope, validity or
enforceability of any of the Owned Intellectual Property is being or has been
contested or challenged. Since January 1, 2013, the Company has not received
any written notice alleging the invalidity or unenforceability of any Owned
Intellectual Property (excluding, for clarity, all correspondence with patent
authorities with respect to ordinary course patent prosecution activities), or
any written notice (including through letters offering to provide a license)
alleging infringement of any other Persons Intellectual Property Rights or
any misappropriation of any other Persons Trade Secrets by the Company or any
of its Subsidiaries, including in connection with research, development,
manufacture, use, distribution or sale of any Company Product. Since January
1, 2013, no Person has notified the Company that it is claiming any ownership
of or right to use any material Owned Intellectual Property. The Owned
Intellectual Property is not subject to any outstanding Order of an arbitrator
or court or other Governmental Entity affecting adversely the rights of the
Company or any Company Subsidiary with respect thereto (excluding
communications and decisions made in the ordinary course of patent
prosecution). As of the date of this Agreement, to the knowledge of the
Company, (i) the development, manufacture, sale, distribution or use by the
Company or any Company Subsidiaries of any

 



      
 

 



 

Company Products and (ii) during the last five years the provision of any
material services by the Company or any Company Subsidiaries, and all of the
other material activities or operations of the Company or any of the Company
Subsidiaries, have not infringed upon, misappropriated or violated, and do not
and, in the case of Companys HeartMate PHP (Percutaneous Heart Pump) product,
will not (based on its existing specifications) upon commercial release in
each country in the European Union and the United States, infringe upon,
misappropriate or violate any valid and enforceable Intellectual Property
Rights of any third party.

 



 

(e) _Licenses to Third Parties_. _Section 3.17(e)_ of the Company Disclosure
Schedule sets forth a complete and accurate list of all Contracts pursuant to
which any Person has been granted any exclusive license under, or otherwise
has received or acquired any exclusive right to use (whether or not currently
exercisable), any Owned Intellectual Property. Neither the Company nor any
Company Subsidiary is bound by, and no Owned Intellectual Property is subject
to, any Contract containing any covenant or other provision that in any way
limits or restricts the ability of the Company or any Company Subsidiary to
use, exploit, assert or enforce any of the Owned Intellectual Property
anywhere in the world, other than non-exclusive licenses granted in the
ordinary course of business.

 



 

(f) _Protection of Intellectual Property Rights_. All of the registrations and
pending applications with or to governmental or regulatory bodies with respect
to the material Owned Intellectual Property have been timely and duly filed,
and prosecution of such applications has been diligently conducted, except in
each case as the Company or a Company Subsidiary has elected in its reasonable
business judgment to abandon or permit to lapse a registration or application.
The Company and each Company Subsidiary has taken reasonable steps (including,
entering into written confidentiality and nondisclosure agreements with
officers, directors, subcontractors, employees, licensees and customers in
connection with its assets or the Business) to safeguard and maintain the
secrecy and confidentiality of Trade Secrets that are material to the
Business. All current and former employees, consultants and contractors of the
Company or any Company Subsidiary who have participated in the development of
any Intellectual Property Rights for the Company or any Company Subsidiaries
or who have had access to any confidential information of the Company or any
of the Company Subsidiaries have executed and delivered proprietary
information, confidentiality and assignment agreements substantially in the
Companys standard forms, except where the failure to have executed and
delivered any such agreements would not reasonably be expected to result in,
either individually or in the aggregate, a Company Material Adverse Effect.

 



 

(g) _Software_. The Company and each of the Company Subsidiaries has used
commercially reasonable efforts to prevent the introduction into any material
Software owned by the Company or the Company Subsidiaries, and to the
knowledge of the Company, such Software does not contain, any "back door,"
"drop dead device," "time bomb," "Trojan horse," "virus" or "worm" (as such
terms are commonly understood in the software industry) or any other code
designed or intended to have any of the following functions: disrupting or
disabling the operation of, or providing unauthorized access to, a computer
system or network or other device on which such code is stored or installed.
The Company and the Company Subsidiaries are in compliance with all
obligations applicable to any "open source" or similar software used by the
Company or any Company Subsidiaries in the Business, excluding any such
software that is embedded in proprietary software licensed from a third party,
except as would not reasonably be expected to result in, either individually
or in the aggregate, a Company Material Adverse Effect.

 



 

(h) No funding, facilities or personnel of any Governmental Entity were used
by the Company or any Company Subsidiary to develop any material Registered
Intellectual Property owned

 



      
 

 



 

by the Company or any of Company Subsidiaries (including any of the foregoing
that covers or claims any Company Product).

 



 

(i) _Data Privacy_. The Company and each of the Company Subsidiaries maintain
and use reasonable efforts to enforce policies and procedures regarding data
security, privacy, data transfer and the use of data that enable the Company
and the Company Subsidiaries to comply with all applicable Laws, except where
the failure to maintain and be in compliance with such policies would not
reasonably be expected to be material to the Company and the Company
Subsidiaries (taken as a whole).

 



 

(j) _IT Systems_. To the knowledge of the Company, since January 1, 2014, no
Person has gained unauthorized access to any of the computer systems, networks
or data used by the Company or any of the Company Subsidiaries that would
compromise or impair to any material degree the value or confidentiality of
such computer systems, networks or data or that would necessitate that the
Company or any Company Subsidiary notify a third Person of such unauthorized
access.

 



 

3.18 _Tax Matters_.

 



 

(a) _Tax Returns_. The Company and each Company Subsidiary have timely filed
(taking into account any extension of time within which to file) with the
appropriate Governmental Entity all income, franchise and other material Tax
Returns required to have been filed by or with respect to the Company or any
Company Subsidiaries, and all such Tax Returns are true, correct and complete
in all material respects. No claim has been made in the past three years in
writing by a Governmental Entity in a jurisdiction where the Company or any
Company Subsidiary does not file Tax Returns that the Company or any Company
Subsidiary is or may be subject to Taxes in such jurisdiction.

 



 

(b) _Payment of Taxes_. All material Taxes of the Company and each Company
Subsidiary required to be paid (whether or not shown on any Tax Return) have
been timely paid. Since January 3, 2015, the Company and the Company
Subsidiaries have not incurred, individually or in the aggregate, any material
liability for Taxes outside the ordinary course of business.

 



 

(c) _Audits, Investigations or Claims_. No deficiencies for any material
amount of Taxes have been proposed or assessed in writing against any of the
Company and the Company Subsidiaries by any Governmental Entity. Neither the
Company nor any of the Company Subsidiaries (i) is the subject of any Tax
audit, examination or other Proceeding involving a Governmental Entity with
respect to material Taxes, or has received written notice of any request for
such an audit, examination or Proceeding that has not been fully resolved with
all amounts due as a result thereof fully reflected in the Company SEC
Documents or (ii) has waived any statute of limitations in respect of any
material Taxes or agreed to any extension of time with respect to a material
Tax assessment or deficiency or the collection of any material Taxes, which
waiver or extension is currently in effect.

 



 

(d) _Tax Sharing Agreements_. Neither the Company nor any Company Subsidiary
has any liability under or is a party to any written agreement for the
sharing, indemnification or allocation of Taxes (other than customary
provisions for Taxes contained in credit, lease or other commercial agreements
the primary purposes of which do not relate to Taxes) or is a party to any
closing agreement pursuant to Section 7121 of the Code (or any similar
provision of state, local or foreign Tax Law) or any other written contract
with any Taxing Authority related to Taxes that could reasonably be expected
to materially affect the liability of the Company or any Company Subsidiary
for Taxes after January 3, 2015, or, with respect to the periods reflected in
the Company SEC Documents, beyond the amounts already reflected with respect
to such Taxes in such Company SEC Documents.

 



      
 

 



 

(e) _Third Party Liability; Consolidated and Other Groups_. None of the
Company or any Company Subsidiary has any material liability for the Taxes of
any Person (other than Taxes of the Company and the Company Subsidiaries)
under Treasury Regulation Section 1.1502-6 (or any similar provision of state,
local or foreign Tax Law), or as a transferee or successor, by Contract or
otherwise. Neither the Company nor any Company Subsidiary has been a member of
an affiliated group (within the meaning of Section 1504 of the Code) or other
comparable group for state, local or foreign Tax purposes filing a combined,
consolidated or unitary Tax Return, which group included any Person other than
the Company or Company Subsidiary.

 



 

(f) _Items Relating to Periods Ending After the Closing Date_. Other than in
the ordinary course of business consistent with past practice, neither the
Company nor any Company Subsidiary will be required to include any material
item of income or gain in, or exclude any material item of deduction or loss
from, taxable income for any taxable period (or portion thereof) ending after
the Closing Date as a result of (i) a change in method of accounting for Tax
purposes (including by reason of Section 481 of the Code (or any similar
provision of state, local or foreign Tax Law)) filed or requested by the
Company, a Company Subsidiary or a Governmental Entity prior to the Closing
Date, (ii) an installment sale or open transaction made or entered into prior
to the Closing Date, (iii) any prepaid amount received by the Company or any
Company Subsidiary prior to the Closing Date, (iv) an election pursuant to
Section 108(i) of the Code (or any similar provision of state, local or
foreign Tax Law), made prior to the Closing Date, or (v) a closing agreement
pursuant to Section 7121 of the Code (or any similar provision of state, local
or foreign Tax Law) entered into prior to the Closing Date.

 



 

(g) _Liens for Taxes_. There are no material Liens on the assets of the
Company or any Company Subsidiary for Taxes, other than Permitted Liens.

 



 

(h) _Withholding_. Each of the Company and the Company Subsidiaries has
withheld and, to the extent required by Law, paid to the appropriate
Governmental Entity all material Taxes required to have been withheld and paid
in connection with amounts paid or owing to any employee, independent
contractor, creditor, shareholder or other third party.

 



 

(i) _Spin-Offs_. Neither the Company nor any Company Subsidiary has been a
"distributing corporation" or a "controlled corporation" (within the meaning
of Section 355 of the Code) in a transaction intended to qualify under Section
355 of the Code within the past two years.

 



 

(j) _Tax Rulings, Holidays and Other Agreements_. To the knowledge of the
Company, there is no material risk that any material Tax ruling, Tax holiday
or other agreement with any Government Entity with respect to Taxes will
expire, be revoked or otherwise terminate solely as a result of the Merger
(and not, for the avoidance of doubt, as a result of any action taken by
Parent or its Affiliates after the Closing). Neither the Company nor any
Company Subsidiary currently has outstanding any requests for Tax rulings, Tax
holidays or other agreements with any Governmental Entity with respect to
material Taxes.

 



 

(k) _Listed Transactions_. Neither the Company nor any Company Subsidiary has
entered into any "listed transaction" within the meaning of Treasury
Regulation Section 1.6011-4(b)(2).

 



 

(l) To the extent a breach or inaccuracy of the representations in this
_Section 3.18_ could result in a liability to the Company or a Company
Subsidiary, references to the Company or any Company Subsidiary shall include
references to any Person for whose Taxes the Company or such Company
Subsidiary is liable as a transferee or successor under applicable Law.

 



       
 

 



 

3.19 _Insurance_. The Company and each Company Subsidiary maintains insurance
coverage with reputable and financially sound insurers, or maintains self-
insurance practices, in such amounts and covering such risks as are in
accordance with customary industry practice for companies engaged in
businesses similar to that of the Company and the Company Subsidiaries. The
Company has made available to Parent accurate and complete copies of all
material insurance policies and all material self-insurance programs and
arrangements relating to the business, assets and operations of the Company
and the Company Subsidiaries (the " _Insurance Policies_ "). Each of the
Insurance Policies is in full force and effect, all premiums due and payable
thereon have been paid and the Company and the Company Subsidiaries are in
compliance in all material respects with the terms and conditions of such
Insurance Policies. Since January 1, 2014, neither the Company nor any Company
Subsidiary has received any written notice regarding any invalidation or
cancellation of any Insurance Policy that has not been renewed in the ordinary
course without any lapse in coverage.

 



 

3.20 _Properties and Assets_. (i) The Company or the Company Subsidiaries, as
the case may be, have valid and subsisting ownership interests in all of the
material tangible personal property reflected in the latest balance sheet
included in the Company SEC Reports prior to the date of this Agreement as
being owned by the Company or any Company Subsidiaries or acquired after the
date thereof (except tangible personal properties sold or otherwise disposed
of since the date thereof in the ordinary course of business), free and clear
of all Liens, other than Permitted Liens and (ii) the tangible personal
property owned by the Company or the Company Subsidiaries is in satisfactory
operating condition and repair for its continued use as it has been used in
all material respects, subject to reasonable wear and tear.

 



 

3.21 _Real Property_.

 



 

(a) _Section 3.21(a)_ of the Company Disclosure Schedule sets forth (i) an
accurate and complete list of all real property leased or subleased by the
Company or any Company Subsidiary (collectively, the " _Leased Real Property_
"), (ii) the address for each Leased Real Property, and (iii) the name of the
third party lessor(s) thereof, the date of the lease contract relating thereto
and all amendments thereof. The Company and each Company Subsidiary have a
valid and subsisting leasehold interest in all Leased Real Property leased by
them, in each case free and clear of all Liens, other than Permitted Liens.

 



 

(b) Except as set forth in _Section 3.21(b)_ of the Company Disclosure
Schedule, neither the Company nor any of the Company Subsidiaries owns any
real property or is a party to any Contract or otherwise has any obligation to
acquire any real property.

 



 

(c) Neither the Company nor any Company Subsidiary has received written notice
of any Proceedings in eminent domain, condemnation or other similar
Proceedings that are pending, and, to the knowledge of the Company, there are
no such Proceedings threatened, affecting any portion of the Leased Real
Property.

 



 

3.22 _Opinion of Financial Advisors_.

 



 

(a) The Company Board has received the opinion of Guggenheim Securities, LLC
(" _Guggenheim_ ") to the effect that, subject to the assumptions,
qualifications and other matters set forth therein, as of the date of this

$63.50 per Share to be paid to the holders of Shares (other than Shares to be
cancelled in accordance with _Section 2.1(b)_ and other than Dissenting
Shares and any Shares held by any Affiliate of Parent, Merger Sub or Ultimate
Parent) pursuant to this Agreement is fair, from a financial point of view, to
such holders, a signed true and complete copy of which has been or will
promptly be provided to Parent.

 



 

3.23 _Company Shareholder Approval_. The affirmative vote or written consent
of the holders of Shares representing a majority of the voting power of the
outstanding Shares entitled to vote thereon is the only vote required of the
holders of any class of capital stock of the Company to approve this Agreement
and the Merger (the " _Company Shareholder Approval_ ").

 



 

3.24 _Brokers_. Except for the Companys obligations to Guggenheim and
Centerview, neither the Company nor any shareholder, director, officer,
employee or affiliate of the Company, has incurred or will incur on behalf of
the Company or any Company Subsidiary, any brokerage, finders, advisory or
similar fee in connection with the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement, including the Merger. The Company has heretofore made available to
Parent accurate and complete copies of all agreements between the Company and
Guggenheim and Centerview respectively, pursuant to which such firm would be
entitled to any payment, commission, fees or expenses in connection with the
Merger or any other transactions contemplated by this Agreement.

 



 

3.25 _Related Party Transactions_. No holder of 5% or more of the Shares or
any director, officer, or affiliate of the Company or any Company Subsidiary,

Companys SEC filings prior to the date of this Agreement.

(a) Each of the Company and the Company Subsidiaries holds, and is operating
in compliance with, all material Company Permits of the U.S. Food and Drug
Administration (the " _FDA_ ") and comparable foreign Governmental Entities
required for the conduct of its respective business as currently conducted
(collectively, the " _FDA Permits_ "), including, but not limited to, pre-

applications approved in accordance with 21 U.S.C. § 360(e) (" _PMA s_"), and
all such FDA Permits are in full force and effect. All of the 510(k)s and
PMAs for the Company Products are exclusively owned by the Company or one of
the Company Subsidiaries, and to the Companys knowledge, the FDA has not
threatened in writing to suspend or revoke any such 510(k)s or PMAs, or
change the marketing classification or labeling of any such products. To the
knowledge of the Company, the manufacture, distribution, and marketing of
Company Products (including components thereof) is in compliance with all FDA
Permits, except where the failure to comply would not reasonably be expected
to be material to the Company and the Company Subsidiaries (taken as a whole).

been no false or misleading information or significant omission in any

in a material debarment or exclusion (i) under 21 U.S.C. Section 335a, or (ii)
any similar Law. As of the date of this Agreement, no claims, actions,
proceedings or investigations that would reasonably be expected to result in
such a material debarment or exclusion are pending or, to the knowledge of the
Company, threatened against the Company, any of the Company Subsidiaries or

negligent design of product, negligent provision of services or any other
allegation of liability, including or arising from the materials, design,
testing, manufacture, packaging, labeling (including instructions for use), or
sale of its products or from the provision of services, in each case that

the Company or any Company Subsidiary in writing, or to the knowledge of the
Company, otherwise, that it intends to terminate or change the pricing or
other terms of its business in any material respect adverse to the Company or
the Company Subsidiaries. Since January 3, 2015, there has been no termination
of the business relationship of the Company or its Subsidiaries with any Top
Supplier.

 



 

3.29 _No Rights Plan_. There is no shareholder rights plan, "poison pill"
anti-takeover plan or other similar device in effect to which the Company is a

first filed with the SEC, amended or supplemented or first published,
distributed or disseminated to the Companys shareholders and at the time of

 **ARTICLE 4 
REPRESENTATIONS AND WARRANTIES OF PARENT AND MERGER SUB**

 



 

Except as set forth in the disclosure schedule delivered by Parent and Merger
Sub to the Company prior to the execution of this Agreement (the " _Parent
Disclosure Schedule_ ") (with each exception set forth in the Parent
Disclosure Schedule being identified by reference to, or grouped under a
heading referring to, a specific individual section or subsection of this
Agreement and relating only to such section or subsection; _provided_ ,
_however_ , that a matter disclosed with respect to one representation or
warranty shall also be deemed to be disclosed with respect to each other
representation and warranty to which the relevance of such information is
readily apparent on its face), Parent and Merger Sub hereby represent and
warrant to the Company as follows:

 



 

4.1 _Organization and Qualification_. Parent is a corporation duly organized,
validly existing and in good standing under the Laws of the State of Delaware.
Merger Sub is a corporation duly organized, validly existing and in good
standing under the Laws of the State of California. Parent has all requisite
corporate power and authority, and Merger Sub has all requisite corporate
power and authority, to own, lease and operate their respective properties and
assets and to carry on their respective businesses as they are now being
conducted. Each of Parent and Merger Sub is duly qualified to do business in
each jurisdiction where the ownership, leasing or operation of its properties
or assets or the conduct of its business requires such qualification, except
where the failure to be so qualified or in good standing (or similar concept
under applicable Law), individually or in the aggregate, would not reasonably
be expected to have a Parent Material Adverse Effect.

 



 

4.2 _Authority_. Each of Parent and Merger Sub has all necessary corporate
power and authority to execute and deliver this Agreement, to perform its
obligations hereunder and to consummate the transactions contemplated hereby,
including the Merger. The execution and delivery of this Agreement by each of
Parent and Merger Sub, as applicable, and the consummation by Parent and
Merger Sub of the transactions contemplated hereby, including the Merger, have
been duly authorized by all necessary corporate action, and no other corporate
proceedings on the part of Parent or Merger Sub and no shareholder votes are
necessary to authorize this Agreement or to consummate the transactions
contemplated hereby, other than the approval of this Agreement and the Merger
by Parent as the sole shareholder of Merger Sub. This Agreement has been duly
and validly executed and delivered by Parent and Merger Sub, and assuming due
authorization, execution and delivery by the Company, constitutes the valid
and binding obligation of Parent and Merger Sub, enforceable against Parent
and Merger Sub in accordance with its terms, except that (i) such enforcement
may be subject to applicable bankruptcy, insolvency or other similar Laws, now
or hereafter in effect, affecting creditors rights generally and (ii) the
remedy of specific performance and injunctive and other forms of equitable
relief may be subject to equitable defenses and to the discretion of the court
before which any Proceeding therefor may be brought.

 



 

4.3 _No Conflict_. None of the execution, delivery or performance of this
Agreement by Parent or Merger Sub, the consummation by Parent or Merger Sub of
the Merger or any other transaction contemplated by this Agreement, or

conflict with or violate any provision of the certificate of incorporation or
by-laws or similar organizational and governing documents of Parent or Merger
Sub; (b) assuming that all consents, approvals, authorizations and permits
described in _Section 4.4_ have been obtained and all filings and
notifications described in _Section 4.4_ have been made and any waiting
periods thereunder have terminated or expired, conflict with or violate any

 



      
 

 



 

Law applicable to Parent or Merger Sub or any other Subsidiary of Parent (each
a " _Parent Subsidiary_ " and, collectively, the " _Parent Subsidiaries_ ") or
any of their respective properties or assets; or (c) assuming that all
consents, approvals, authorizations and permits described in _Section 4.4_
have been obtained and all filings and notifications described in _Section
4.4_ have been made and any waiting periods thereunder have terminated or
expired, require any consent or approval under, violate, conflict with, result
in any breach of or any loss of any benefit under, or constitute a default
under, or result in termination or give to others any right of termination,
amendment, acceleration or cancellation of, or result in the creation of a
Lien upon any of the respective properties or assets of Parent, Merger Sub or
any Parent Subsidiary pursuant to any Contract to which Parent, Merger Sub or
any Parent Subsidiary is a party, except, with respect to clauses (b) and (c),
for any such conflicts, violations, consents, breaches, losses, defaults,
other occurrences or Liens which, individually or in the aggregate, would not
reasonably be expected to have a Parent Material Adverse Effect.

 



 

4.4 _Required Filings and Consents_. None of the execution, delivery or
performance of this Agreement by Parent and Merger Sub, the consummation by
Parent and Merger Sub of the Merger or any other transaction contemplated by
this Agreement, or compliance by Parent or Merger Sub with any of the
provisions of this Agreement will require (with or without notice or lapse of
time, or both) any consent, approval, authorization or permit of, or filing or
registration with or notification to, any Governmental Entity, other than (a)
the filing and recordation of the Agreement of Merger as required by the CGCL,

applicable foreign or state securities or Blue Sky Laws, (f) filings with the
SEC as may be required by Parent or Merger Sub in connection with this
Agreement and the transactions contemplated hereby, (g) such filings as may be
required under the rules and regulations of NASDAQ, (h) consents required
pursuant to the Debt Financing, and (i) where the failure to obtain such
consents, approvals, authorizations or permits of, or to make such filings,
registrations with or notifications to any Governmental Entity, individually
or in the aggregate, would not reasonably be expected to have a Parent
Material Adverse Effect.

 



 

4.5 _Litigation_.

 



 

(a) There is no Proceeding pending or, to the knowledge of Parent, threatened
against Parent or Merger Sub that, individually or in the aggregate, would
reasonably be expected to have a Parent Material Adverse Effect or challenges
the validity of the Merger.

 



 

(b) Neither Parent nor Merger Sub is subject to any outstanding Order that,
individually or in the aggregate, has had or would reasonably be expected to
have a Parent Material Adverse Effect.

 



 

4.6 _Ownership of Shares_. Neither Parent nor any of its Subsidiaries owns
(beneficially or otherwise) any Shares or other Equity Interests in the
Company or any options, warrants or other rights to acquire Shares or other
Equity Interests in the Company (or any other economic interest through
derivative securities or otherwise in the Company).

 



 

4.7 _Financial Capability_. At the Closing, Parent and Merger Sub will have
sufficient cash, available lines of credit or other sources of immediately
available funds to consummate the Merger and to perform their respective
obligations under this Agreement. Ultimate Parent has delivered to the Company
a true and complete copy of the executed Debt Commitment Letter. The Debt
Commitment Letter has not been amended or modified in any manner prior to the
date of this Agreement. Neither Parent nor any of its Affiliates has entered
into any agreement, side letter or other commitment or

 



      
 

 



 

arrangement relating to the financing of the transactions contemplated by the
Debt Commitment Letter, other than as set forth in the Debt Commitment Letter
and the fee letters related thereto, in each case that would impose
additional, or make more burdensome any existing, conditions precedent related
to the funding of the full amount of the Debt Financing other than the
Financing Conditions. The proceeds of the Debt Financing (both before and
after giving effect to the exercise of any or all "market flex" provisions
related thereto) will be loaned by Ultimate Parent to Parent, and, together
with other financial resources of Ultimate Parent, Parent and Merger Sub
(including cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities of Ultimate
Parent, Parent, Merger Sub, the Company and the Companys Subsidiaries on the
Closing Date), will be sufficient to consummate the transactions contemplated
hereby, including the payment of the aggregate Merger Consideration, Option
Payments and RSU Payments to which holders of Shares, Company Options and
Company RSUs, respectively, will be entitled at the Effective Time pursuant to
this Agreement. As of the date of this Agreement, the commitments contained in
the Debt Commitment Letter have not been withdrawn or rescinded in any
respect. As of the date of this Agreement, the Debt Commitment Letter is in
full force and effect and represents a valid, binding and enforceable
obligation of Ultimate Parent and, to the knowledge of Parent, each other
party thereto (except to the extent that enforceability may be limited by the
applicable bankruptcy, insolvency, moratorium, reorganization or similar Laws
affecting the enforcement of creditors rights generally or by general
principles of equity), and provides for the financing contemplated thereby
subject only to the satisfaction or waiver of the Financing Conditions.
Ultimate Parent has fully paid (or caused to be paid) any and all commitment
fees and other amounts that are due and payable on or prior to the date of
this Agreement in connection with the Debt Financing. As of the date of this
Agreement, to the knowledge of Parent, no event has occurred which, with or
without notice, lapse of time or both, would constitute a breach or default on
the part of Ultimate Parent or any other party thereto under any term of the
Debt Commitment Letter. As of the date of this Agreement, subject to the
satisfaction of the conditions contained in _Sections 6.1_ and _6.2_ and
assuming the accuracy of the Companys representations and warranties set
forth in _Article 3_, Parent has no reason to believe that Ultimate Parent or
any other party thereto will be unable to satisfy on a timely basis any term
of the Debt Commitment Letter to be satisfied by it. There are no conditions
precedent related to the funding of the full amount of the Debt Financing,
other than the Financing Conditions. The only conditions precedent or other
contingencies related to the funding of the Debt Financing on the Closing Date
that will be included in the Debt Financing Documents shall be the Financing
Conditions contained in the Debt Commitment Letter. Parent understands and
acknowledges that under the terms of this Agreement, the obligations of Parent
and Merger Sub to consummate the Merger are not in any way contingent upon or
otherwise subject to the consummation by Parent, Ultimate Parent or Merger Sub
of any financing arrangements, the obtaining by Parent, Ultimate Parent or
Merger Sub of any financing (other than financing to be obtained by Parent
from Ultimate Parent and by Merger Sub from Parent) or the availability,
grant, provision or extension of any financing to Parent, Ultimate Parent or
Merger Sub.

(a) Merger Sub was formed solely for the purpose of engaging in the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement.

Agreement, Merger Sub has not and will not prior to the Closing Date have
incurred, directly or indirectly, through any Subsidiary or affiliate, any
obligations or liabilities or engaged in any business activities of any type
or kind whatsoever or entered into any agreements or arrangements with any
Person.

 



 

4.9 _Brokers_. Except for Ultimate Parents obligations to Merrill Lynch,
Pierce, Fenner and Smith Incorporated, neither Parent, Merger Sub nor any of
their respective shareholders,

 



      
 

 



 

directors, officers, employees or affiliates, has incurred or will incur on
behalf of Parent, Merger Sub or any Parent Subsidiary, any brokerage,
finders, advisory or similar fee in connection with the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement, including the Merger.

 



 

4.10 _Certain Information_. The information supplied by Parent or Merger Sub
for inclusion or incorporation by reference in the Proxy Statement will not,
at the time it is first published, distributed or disseminated to the
Companys shareholders, contain any untrue statement of a material fact or
omit to state any material fact required to be stated therein or necessary to
make the statements therein, in light of the circumstances under which they
are made, not misleading. Notwithstanding the foregoing, neither Parent nor
Merger Sub makes any representation or warranty with respect to statements
included or incorporated by reference in the Proxy Statement by the Company.

 



 

4.11 _No Other Representations or Warranties_. Except for the representations
and warranties contained in _Article 3_ and _Section 5.9(c)_ of this
Agreement, and the representations and warranties of the Company shareholders
set forth in the Voting Agreement, Parent and Merger Sub acknowledge that
neither the Company nor any of its Subsidiaries nor any Representative of the
Company or any of its Subsidiaries makes, and Parent and Merger Sub
acknowledge that they have not relied upon or otherwise been induced by, any
other express or implied representation or warranty by or on behalf of the

the Company or any Company Subsidiaries in connection with the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement, including any information, documents,
projections, forecasts or other material made available to Parent, Merger Sub
or their respective Representatives in certain "data rooms" or management
presentations in expectation of the transactions contemplated by this

(y) make a material change in the standard warranty policies for products sold
by the Company;

 



 

(z) enter into, renew, or amend any distribution agreements not terminable by
the Company or the Companys Subsidiaries on 90 days notice without penalty;

 



 

(aa) enter into any Affiliate Transaction; or

 



      
 

 



 

(bb) authorize or enter into any Contract or otherwise make any commitment,
resolve or agree, in each case, to do any of the foregoing in clauses (a)
through (aa).

 



 

5.2 _Access to Information; Confidentiality_.

 



 

(a) (A) Except as required pursuant to any confidentiality agreement or
similar agreement or arrangement to which the Company or any Company
Subsidiary is a party, and (B) except as would result in the loss or waiver of
any attorney-client, work product or other applicable privilege or would
result in the violation of applicable Law, from the date of this Agreement to
the Effective Time, the Company will, and will cause each Company Subsidiary
and each of its and their respective directors, officers, employees,
investment bankers, accountants, consultants, legal counsel, financial
advisors, other advisors, agents and other representatives, (collectively, "
_Representatives_ " and, with respect to the Company and the Company
Subsidiaries, the " _Company Representatives_ ") to: (i) provide to Parent and
Merger Sub and their respective Representatives (the " _Parent
Representatives_ ") reasonable access at reasonable times during normal
operating hours upon prior notice to the officers, employees, agents,
properties, offices and other facilities of such party and its Subsidiaries
and to the books and records thereof; (ii) furnish promptly such information
concerning the business, properties, Contracts, assets, liabilities, Taxes
(including Tax Returns), personnel and other aspects of such party and its
Subsidiaries as Parent or the Parent Representatives may reasonably request,
including responding to reasonable requests for information, including
requests for information on any change, condition, or event that renders or
would reasonably be expected to render any representation or warranty of the
Company set forth in this Agreement (disregarding any materiality
qualification contained therein) to be untrue or inaccurate in any material
respect; _provided_ , that no investigation pursuant to this _Section 5.2_
shall affect or be deemed to modify any representation or warranty made by the
Company herein or any of the conditions to the obligations of the parties
hereto under this Agreement; _provided_ , _further_ , that any investigation
pursuant to this _Section 5.2_ shall be conducted in such manner as not to
interfere unreasonably with the conduct of the Company (including the
activities of the Company pursuant to _Section 5.3(a)_). The information
referred to in the previous sentence shall be subject to the Confidentiality
Agreement, dated June 18, 2015, by and between the Company and the Ultimate
Parent (the " _Confidentiality Agreement_ "); _provided_ , _however_ , that
the exception in subclause (A) shall only apply prior to the No-Shop Period
Start Date (or if there is an Excluded Party that remains active at such date,
prior to the Excluded Party Cutoff Date).

 



 

(b) Nothing contained in this Agreement will give Parent or Merger Sub,
directly or indirectly, the right to control or direct the operations of the
Company prior to the Effective Time. Prior to the Effective Time, the Company
will exercise, consistent with the terms and conditions of this Agreement,
complete control and supervision over its operations.

 



 

5.3 _Go-Shop; Acquisition Proposals_.

 



 

(a) Notwithstanding any other provision of this Agreement to the contrary,
during the period beginning on the date of this Agreement and continuing until
11:59 p.m. (New York City time) on August 20, 2015, the Company and the
Company Representatives will be permitted to, directly and indirectly: (i)
take any action to solicit, initiate, seek, encourage or facilitate (whether
publicly or otherwise) any inquiry, expression of interest, proposal or offer
with respect to, or that may reasonably be expected to lead to, an Acquisition
Proposal, including by way of providing access to non-public information but
only pursuant to one or more Acceptable Confidentiality Agreements and (ii)
enter into, participate in, maintain or continue any discussions or
negotiations relating to, or that may reasonably be expected to lead to, any
Acquisition Proposal; _provided_ , that the Company will (A) provide Parent a
copy (with the name and other identifying information of the third party
redacted) of each confidentiality agreement the Company has executed in
accordance with this _Section 5.3(a)_and (B)

 



      
 

 



 

promptly (and in any event within 24 hours) provide to Parent any non-public
information concerning the Company and the Company Subsidiaries that is
provided to any Person given such access which was not previously provided to
Parent or the Parent Representatives.

 



 

(b) Except as otherwise permitted by this _Section 5.3_, the Company will,
and it will cause the Company Representatives to:

 



 

i. from 12:00 a.m. (New York City time) on August 21, 2015 (the " _No-Shop
Period Start Date_ "), (A) immediately cease and cause to be terminated any
solicitation, encouragement, discussions or negotiations with any Persons
(other than any Excluded Party) that may be ongoing with respect to any
Acquisition Proposal and immediately terminate all physical and electronic
data room access previously granted to any such Person, (B) take the necessary
steps to promptly inform such Persons of the obligations set forth in this
_Section 5.3(b)_, (C) promptly instruct each Person that has received non-
public information in connection with such Persons consideration of an
Acquisition Proposal (other than any Excluded Party) to return to the Company
or destroy any non-public information previously furnished to such Person or
to any Persons Representatives by or on behalf of the Company or any Company
Subsidiary and (D) except as provided below and in the definition of
"Acceptable Confidentiality Agreement" with respect to the Confidentiality
Agreement, not terminate, waive, amend, release or modify any provision of any
confidentiality or standstill agreement to which it or any of its Affiliates
or Representatives is a party with respect to any Acquisition Proposal or
potential Acquisition Proposal, and shall enforce the provisions of any such
agreement, which shall include seeking any injunctive relief available to
enforce such agreement ( _provided_ , that the Company shall be permitted to
grant waivers of, and not enforce, any standstill agreement solely to the
extent that the Company Board has determined in good faith, after consultation
with its outside counsel, that failure to take such action (1) would prohibit
the counterparty from making an unsolicited Acquisition Proposal to the
Company Board in compliance with this _Section 5.3_ and (2) would reasonably
be expected to be inconsistent with its fiduciary duties to the shareholders
of the Company under applicable Law; and _provided_ , _further_ , that if the
Company terminates, waives, amends, releases or modifies any provision of any
such confidentiality or standstill agreement, the Confidentiality Agreement
shall automatically, without any further action on behalf of Ultimate Parent
or the Company, concurrently with such action, be terminated, waived, amended,
released or modified to the same degree as such third-party confidentiality or
standstill agreement); and

 



 

ii. from the No-Shop Period Start Date until the Effective Time or, if
earlier, the termination of this Agreement in accordance with _Article 7_,
not, directly or indirectly: (A) solicit, initiate, endorse, seek or knowingly
encourage or facilitate or take any action to solicit, initiate, endorse or
seek or knowingly encourage or facilitate any inquiry, expression of interest,
proposal or offer with respect to or that constitutes or would reasonably be
expected to lead to an Acquisition Proposal, (B) enter into, participate in,
maintain or continue any discussions or negotiations relating to, any
Acquisition Proposal with any Person other than Ultimate Parent, Parent or
Merger Sub, (C) furnish to any Person other than Ultimate Parent, Parent or
Merger Sub any non-public information that the Company believes or should
reasonably expect would be used for the purposes of formulating any
Acquisition Proposal, (D) enter into any agreement, letter of intent,
memorandum of understanding, agreement in principle or Contract providing for
or otherwise relating to, or which is intended to or is reasonably likely to
lead to, any Acquisition Proposal (other than an Acceptable Confidentiality
Agreement in accordance with the terms of this Agreement) (each, an "
_Alternative Acquisition Agreement_ "), (E) submit any Acquisition Proposal or
any matter related thereto to the vote of the shareholders of the Company or
(F) resolve or agree to do any of the foregoing.

 



 

iii. Notwithstanding the commencement of the obligations of the Company under
this _Section 5.3(b)_ on the No-Shop Period Start Date, on and after the No-
Shop Period

 



      
 

 



 

Start Date and until 11:59 p.m. (New York City Time) on September 9, 2015 (the
" _Excluded Party Cutoff Date_ "), the parties hereto agree that the Company
may continue to engage in the activities described in subclauses (i) and (ii)
of this _Section 5.3(b)_ with respect to each Excluded Party (including, for
the avoidance of doubt, with respect to any amended or new Acquisition
Proposal submitted by any Excluded Party on and after the No-Shop Period Start
Date and prior to the Excluded Party Cutoff Date); _provided_ , that the
provisions of _Section 5.3(e)_ and _Section 5.3(f)_ will apply with respect
to any Excluded Party and its Acquisition Proposal, whether made prior to or
following the No-Shop Period Start Date. Notwithstanding anything to the
contrary in this _Section 5.3_, an Excluded Party shall cease to be an
Excluded Party for all purposes under this Agreement immediately at the
earlier of (x) the No-Shop Period Start Date, if, on the date immediately
preceding the No-Shop Period Start Date, there does not exist a bona fide
written Acquisition Proposal submitted by such Excluded Party that has not
expired or been withdrawn as of such date, that the Company Board has
determined, in good faith, after consultation with its independent financial
advisers and outside legal counsel, constitutes, or would reasonably be
expected to lead to, a Superior Proposal, and (y) the Excluded Party Cutoff
Date. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained herein, on and after
the Excluded Party Cutoff Date until the Company Shareholder Approval or, if
earlier, the termination of this Agreement in accordance with _Article 7_,
with respect to any Person who was an Excluded Party, (A) the provisions of
_Section 5.3(b)(i)_ will apply, (B) none of the activities described in
_Section 5.3(b)(ii)_ may continue, (C) the provisions of _Section
5.3(b)(ii)_ will apply with respect to any further or continuing Acquisition
Proposal by such Person, (D) the Full Breakup Fee shall apply to any
termination of this Agreement effected pursuant to _Section 7.1(c)_ or
_Section 7.1(d)_ in connection with an Acquisition Proposal by such Person
and (E) there shall be no limitations to the number of Parents Match Events,
in each case as if such Person had never been an Excluded Party.

 



 

(c) No later than 24 hours after the No-Shop Period Start Date, the Company
shall notify Parent in writing of the identity of any Excluded Party as of
such time. At any time on or after the No-Shop Period Start Date until the
earlier of the Effective Time and the termination of this Agreement in
accordance with its terms, the Company will promptly (and in any event within
24 hours of the Companys knowledge of such event) provide Parent with a
written description of (i) any inquiry or request for information, discussion
or negotiation that is reasonably likely to lead to or that contemplates an
Acquisition Proposal or (ii) any proposal or offer relating to an Acquisition
Proposal, in each case from any Person after the No-Shop Period Start Date
(other than from Parent and Merger Sub or any Excluded Party), including a
description of the material terms and conditions of and facts surrounding any
such inquiry, request, proposal or offer, the identity of the Person making
any such inquiry, request, proposal or offer, and a copy of any written
proposal, offer or draft agreement provided by such Person. The Company shall
keep Parent informed (and in any event within 24 hours of the occurrence of
such event) in all material respects on a timely basis of the status and
details of any such request, inquiry, proposal or offer, including any
amendments, modifications, or developments thereto and furnishing copies of
any inquiries, correspondence and draft documentation. Without limiting any of
the foregoing, the Company shall promptly (and in any event within 24 hours)
notify Parent if it determines to begin providing information or to engage in
discussions or negotiations concerning an Acquisition Proposal (other than any
Acquisition Proposal submitted by an Excluded Party) pursuant to _Section
5.3(d) _and, subject to _Section 5.3(d)_, shall in no event begin providing
such information or engaging in such discussions or negotiations prior to
providing such notice. After the No-Shop Period Start Date, the Company shall
provide Parent with at least 24 hours prior notice (or such shorter notice as
may be provided to the Company Board) of a meeting of the Company Board at
which the Company Board is reasonably expected to consider an Acquisition
Proposal.

 



 

(d) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in _Section 5.3(b)_,
if at any time on or after the No-Shop Period Start Date until the earlier of
the Company Shareholder Approval and the termination of this Agreement in
accordance with its terms, (i) the Company has received a bona

 



      
 

 



 

fide written Acquisition Proposal from a third party, (ii) such Acquisition
Proposal was not solicited, initiated, encouraged or facilitated in breach of
the provisions of this Agreement, (iii) the Company Board determines in good
faith, after consultation with its financial advisors and outside counsel,
that such Acquisition Proposal constitutes or is reasonably likely to lead to
a Superior Proposal and (iv) after consultation with its outside counsel, the
Company Board determines in good faith that the failure to take the actions
referred to in clause (A) and/or (B) below would reasonably be expected to be
inconsistent with its fiduciary duties to the shareholders of the Company
under applicable Law, then the Company may take the following actions: (A)
furnish information with respect to the Company and any Company Subsidiary to
the Person making such Acquisition Proposal but only pursuant to one or more
Acceptable Confidentiality Agreements and/or (B) participate in discussions or
negotiations with the Person making such Acquisition Proposal regarding such
Acquisition Proposal; _provided_ , that the Company will promptly (and in any
case within 24 hours) provide to Parent any non-public information concerning
the Company or any Company Subsidiary provided to such other Person which was
not previously provided to Parent or the Parent Representatives. For the
avoidance of doubt, the provisions of this _Section 5.3(d)_ shall not be
construed in any way to restrict the Companys activities pursuant to _Section
5.3(b)(iii)_ with respect to any Excluded Party.

 



 

(e) Subject to _Section 5.3(f)_ and _Section 5.3(g)_, from the date of this
Agreement until the earlier of the Effective Time and the termination of this
Agreement in accordance with its terms, neither the Company Board nor any
committee thereof will (i) withhold, withdraw or qualify (or modify in a
manner adverse to Parent or Merger Sub) (or publicly propose to withhold,
withdraw, qualify or so modify) the approval, recommendation or declaration of
advisability by the Company Board or any such committee of this Agreement, the
Merger or any of the other transactions contemplated hereby, (ii) approve,
recommend, or otherwise declare advisable the approval by the Companys
shareholders of (or publicly propose to approve, recommend or otherwise
declare advisable) any Acquisition Proposal, (iii) submit any Acquisition
Proposal or any matter related thereto to the vote of the shareholders of the
Company or (iv) authorize, commit, resolve or agree to take any such actions
(each such action set forth in clauses (i) through (iv) being referred to as a
" _Change of Board Recommendation_ ").

 



 

(f) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this _Article 5_,
if, at any time prior to the Company Shareholder Approval, (i) the Company has
received a bona fide written Acquisition Proposal from a third party that was
not solicited, initiated, encouraged or facilitated in, and did not otherwise
result from, a material breach (in the case of an Acquisition Proposal
submitted by an Excluded Party; _provided_ , that for purposes of this
_Section 5.3(f)(i)_, a material breach shall include, but not be limited to,
(x) a failure to give Parent complete and timely information in respect of an
Acquisition Proposal by such Excluded Party when required in accordance with
the terms of this Agreement and (y) a breach that would have the effect of
reducing or impairing the exercise of Parents match rights in connection with
any such Acquisition Proposal) or any breach (in the case of any other
Acquisition Proposal) of the provisions of this Agreement, and that the
Company Board determines in good faith, after consultation with outside
counsel and its financial advisors, constitutes a Superior Proposal, after
giving effect to all of the adjustments to the terms and conditions of this
Agreement and the Debt Commitment Letter that have been delivered to the
Company by Parent in writing during the Notice Period provided pursuant to
this _Section 5.3(f)_, that are binding for acceptance during the Notice
Period and have been committed to by Parent in writing and (ii) the Company
Board determines in good faith, after consultation with its financial advisors
and its outside counsel, that a failure to make a Change of Board
Recommendation and/or cause the Company to enter into such Alternative
Acquisition Agreement with respect to such Superior Proposal would reasonably
be expected to be inconsistent with the fiduciary duties owed by the Company
Board to the shareholders of the Company under applicable Law, then, prior to
(but not after) the time the Company Shareholder Approval is obtained, the
Company Board may take the following actions: (y) effect a Change of Board
Recommendation with respect to such Superior Proposal or (z) terminate this
Agreement in accordance with _Section 7.1(d)_ and promptly thereafter (and

 



      
 

 



 

in any event within 24 hours) enter into a binding Alternative Acquisition
Agreement with respect to such Superior Proposal; _provided_ , _however_ ,
that the Company may not terminate this Agreement pursuant to the foregoing
clause (z), and any purported termination pursuant to the foregoing clause (z)
will be void and of no force or effect, unless in advance of or concurrently
with such termination the Company pays the Breakup Fee in accordance with
_Section 7.2(b)_; and _provided_ , _further_ , that the Company Board may not
effect a Change of Board Recommendation pursuant to the foregoing clause (y)
or terminate this Agreement pursuant to the foregoing clause (z) unless:

 



 

i. the Company has provided prior written notice to Parent, at least four
Business Days in advance (the " _Notice Period_ "), of the Companys intention
to take such action with respect to such Superior Proposal (it being
understood that the delivery of such notice and any amendment or update
thereto and the determination to so deliver such notice, update or amendment
will not, by itself, constitute a Change of Board Recommendation or otherwise
give rise to a Triggering Event), which notice will specify the terms and
conditions of such Superior Proposal (including the identity of the party
making such Superior Proposal), and the Company has contemporaneously provided
to Parent a copy of the relevant proposed transaction agreements with the
party making such Superior Proposal, including any definitive agreement with
respect to such Superior Proposal;

 



 

ii. prior to effecting such Change of Board Recommendation or terminating this
Agreement to enter into an Alternative Acquisition Agreement with respect to
such Superior Proposal, the Company will, and will cause the Company
Representatives to, during the Notice Period, negotiate with Parent in good
faith (to the extent Parent desires to negotiate) to make such adjustments in
the terms and conditions of this Agreement and the Debt Commitment Letter so
that such Acquisition Proposal ceases to constitute a Superior Proposal; and

 



 

iii. after the expiration of the Notice Period, the Company Board, after
taking into consideration any adjusted terms and conditions of this Agreement
and the Debt Commitment Letter as committed to in writing by Parent that is
binding for acceptance during the Notice Period, continues to determine in
good faith (after consultation with outside counsel and its financial advisor)
that such Acquisition Proposal continues to be a Superior Proposal and that
the failure to make a Change of Board Recommendation or terminate this
Agreement to enter into an Alternative Acquisition Agreement, as applicable,
would reasonably be expected to be inconsistent with its fiduciary duties to
the shareholders of the Company under applicable Law;

 



 

 _provided_ , that in the event of any material revisions to the terms of an
Acquisition Proposal, the Company will be required to deliver a new written
notice to Parent and to comply with the requirements of this _Section 5.3(f)_
with respect to such new written notice; _provided_ , that the Notice Period
for any subsequent notice will be shortened from four Business Days to two
Business Days.

 



 

To the extent Parent makes or commits to make an adjustment to the terms and
conditions of this Agreement and Debt Commitment Letter pursuant to _Section
5.3(f)iii_, and the Company Board, after taking into consideration the
adjusted terms and conditions of this Agreement and Debt Commitment Letter as
proposed by Parent, determines in good faith (after consultation with outside
counsel and its financial advisor) that such Superior Proposal no longer
continues to be a Superior Proposal, such process will be deemed to be one "
_Match Event_." The Company shall only have the obligation to provide two
Match Events to Parent with respect to any Excluded Party, as long as such
Person remains an Excluded Party pursuant to this Agreement. For the avoidance
of doubt, there shall be no limitations to the number of Parents Match Events
pursuant to this _Section 5.3_ with respect to any Persons who are not
Excluded Parties or with respect to any Excluded Party on or after the
Excluded Party Cutoff Date.

 



      
 

 



 

(g) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained herein, prior to (but
not after) the time the Company Shareholder Approval is obtained, the Company
Board may make a Change of Board Recommendation for a reason unrelated to an
Acquisition Proposal (it being understood and agreed that any Change of Board
Recommendation proposed to be made in relation to an Acquisition Proposal may
only be made pursuant to and in accordance with the terms of _Section
5.3(f)_) if the Company Board has determined in good faith, after consultation
with its outside legal counsel, that, in light of a material event or
circumstance that was not known or reasonably foreseeable to the Company Board
prior to the date of this Agreement (or if known, the consequences of which
were not known or reasonably foreseeable), which event or circumstance, or any
material consequence thereof, becomes known to the Company Board prior to the
time the Company Shareholder Approval is obtained that does not relate to (A)
Parent or its Subsidiaries (including any Parent Material Adverse Effect as it
relates to Parent or its Subsidiaries), (B) any action taken pursuant to this
Agreement or (C) any changes in the price of Parent Shares (an " _Intervening
Event_ ") and taking into account the results of any negotiations with Parent
as contemplated by subsection (ii) below and any offer from Parent
contemplated by subsection (iii) below, that the failure to take such action
would reasonably be expected to be inconsistent with the fiduciary duties owed
by the Company Board to the shareholders of the Company under applicable Law;
_provided_ , _however_ , that the Company Board may not withdraw, modify or
amend the Company Board Recommendation in a manner adverse to Parent pursuant
to the foregoing unless:

 



 

i. the Company shall have provided prior written notice to Parent, at least
five Business Days in advance (the " _Intervening Event Notice Period_ "), of
the Companys intention to make a Change of Board Recommendation (it being
understood that the delivery of such notice and any amendment or update
thereto and the determination to so deliver such notice, update or amendment
shall not, by itself, constitute a Change of Board Recommendation or otherwise
give rise to a Triggering Event), which notice shall specify the Company
Boards reason for proposing to effect such Change of Board Recommendation
(including a description of such Intervening Event in reasonable detail);

 



 

ii. prior to effecting such Change of Board Recommendation, the Company shall,
and shall cause the Company Representatives to, during the Intervening Event
Notice Period negotiate with Parent in good faith (to the extent Parent
desires to negotiate) to make such adjustments in the terms and conditions of
this Agreement and the Debt Commitment Letter in such a manner that would
obviate the need for the Company Board to effect such Change of Board
Recommendation; and

 



 

iii. after the expiration of the Intervening Event Notice Period, the Company
Board, after taking into consideration the adjusted terms and conditions of
this Agreement and the Debt Commitment Letter as made in writing by Parent
that is binding for acceptance during the Intervening Event Notice Period,
continues to determine in good faith (after consultation with outside counsel
and its financial advisor) that the failure to make such Change of Board
Recommendation would reasonably be expected to be inconsistent with its
fiduciary duties to the shareholders of the Company under applicable Law.

 



 

(h) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary herein, neither the Company nor
any of its Subsidiaries shall enter into any Alternative Acquisition Agreement
unless this Agreement has been or is substantially concurrently terminated in
accordance with its terms (including the payment of the Breakup Fee pursuant
to _Section 7.2(b)_, if applicable).

 



 

(i) The Company agrees that any violation of the restrictions set forth in
this _Section 5.3_ by any Representative of the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries, whether or not such Person is purporting to act on behalf of the
Company or any of its Subsidiaries or otherwise, shall be deemed to be a
breach of this Agreement by the Company.

 



      
 

 



 

(j) Nothing contained in this Agreement shall prohibit the Company (i) from
taking and disclosing to the shareholders of the Company a position
contemplated by Rule 14e-2(a) promulgated under the Exchange Act or complying
with the provisions of Rule 14d-9 promulgated under the Exchange Act or (ii)
making any disclosure to the shareholders of the Company that the Company
Board determines to make in good faith (after consultation with its outside
counsel) in order to fulfill its fiduciary duties under, or in order to
otherwise comply with, applicable Law, in each case, so long as (A) any such
disclosure includes the Company Board Recommendation, without any modification
thereof, (B) does not contain a Change of Board Recommendation and (C)
expressly rejects any applicable Acquisition Proposal.

 



 

5.4 _Shareholder Approval; Preparing of Proxy Statement_.

 



 

(a) The Company shall use its reasonable best efforts to cause a meeting of
its shareholders (the " _Company Shareholder Meeting_ ") to be duly called and
held as soon as reasonably practicable and in any event will use reasonable
best efforts to cause the meeting to be held no later than 35 calendar days
after (i) the tenth calendar day after the preliminary Proxy Statement
therefor has been filed with the SEC if by such date the SEC has not informed
the Company that it intends to review the Proxy Statement or (ii) if the SEC
has by such date informed the Company that it intends to review the Proxy
Statement, the date on which the SEC confirms that it has no further comments
on the Proxy Statement (the " _Proxy Statement Clearance Date_ ") for the
purpose of voting on the approval of this Agreement and the Merger. The
Company shall not, without the consent of Parent, adjourn or postpone the
Company Shareholder Meeting; _provided_ , that the Company may, without the
consent of Parent, adjourn or postpone the Company Shareholder Meeting (A) if
as of the time for which the Company Shareholder Meeting is originally
scheduled (as set forth in the Proxy Statement) there are insufficient Shares
represented (either in person or by proxy) to constitute a quorum necessary to
conduct the business of the Company Shareholder Meeting, (B) if the failure to
adjourn or postpone the Company Shareholder Meeting would reasonably be
expected to be a violation of applicable Law or for the distribution of any
legally required supplement or amendment to the Proxy Statement or (C) to
solicit additional proxies if the Company reasonably determines that it is
advisable or necessary to do so in order to obtain the Company Shareholder
Approval. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Company shall, at the request of
Parent, to the extent permitted by Law, adjourn the Company Shareholder
Meeting to a date specified by Parent for the absence of a quorum or if the
Company has not received proxies representing a sufficient number of Shares
for the Company Shareholder Approval; _provided_ , that the Company shall not
be required to adjourn the Company Shareholder Meeting more than one time
pursuant to this sentence, and no such adjournment pursuant to this sentence
shall be required to be for a period exceeding 10 Business Days. Except in the
case of a Change of Board Recommendation specifically permitted by _Section
5.3(f)_ or _Section 5.3(g)_, the Company, through the Company Board, shall
include the Company Board Recommendation in the Proxy Statement. Without
limiting the generality of the foregoing and subject to the right to terminate
this Agreement pursuant to _Section 7.1_, the Company agrees that its
obligations pursuant to this _Section 5.4_ shall not be affected by the
commencement, public proposal, public disclosure or communication to the
Company or any other Person of any Acquisition Proposal or Change of Board
Recommendation.

 



 

(b) The Company shall use its reasonable best efforts to (i) prepare and file
with the SEC a Proxy Statement in preliminary form relating to the Company
Shareholder Meeting as soon as reasonably practicable after the date of this
Agreement (and in any event will file the Proxy Statement no later than five
calendar days after the No-Shop Period Start Date (or if there is an Excluded
Party that remains active at such date, on the Excluded Party Cutoff Date)),
(ii) cause the Proxy Statement and any amendments or supplements thereto, when
filed, to comply in all material respects with all legal requirements
applicable thereto, (iii) respond as promptly as reasonably practicable to and
resolve all comments received from the SEC or its staff concerning the Proxy
Statement and all other proxy

 



      
 

 



 

materials and promptly notify Parent upon the receipt of any such comments,
(iv) cause the Proxy Statement to be mailed to its shareholders as promptly as
reasonably practicable after the Proxy Statement Clearance Date and (v) in
consultation with Parent, set a preliminary record date for the Company
Shareholder Meeting and commence, as soon as practicable after the date of
this Agreement (and in any event no later than three calendar days after the
date of this Agreement), a broker search pursuant to Section 14a-13 of the
Exchange Act. Parent shall promptly provide such information regarding Parent
and Merger Sub that the Company may reasonably request for inclusion in the
Proxy Statement. Subject to _Section 5.3(f)_ and _Section 5.3(g)_, the
Company Board shall use its reasonable best efforts to obtain the Company
Shareholder Approval. If at any time prior to obtaining the Company
Shareholder Approval, any information relating to the Merger, the Company,
Parent, Merger Sub or any of their respective Affiliates, directors or
officers should be discovered by the Company or Parent that should be set
forth in an amendment or supplement to the Proxy Statement so that such
document would not contain any misstatement of a material fact or omit to
state any material fact necessary to make the statements therein, in light of
the circumstances under which they were made, not misleading, the party that
discovers such information shall promptly notify the other parties hereto and
the Company shall promptly file with the SEC an appropriate amendment or
supplement describing such information and, to the extent required by
applicable Law, disseminate such amendment or supplement to the shareholders
of the Company. Notwithstanding the foregoing, prior to filing or mailing the
Proxy Statement (or any amendment or supplement thereto) or responding to any
comments of the SEC with respect thereto, the Company shall give Parent,
Merger Sub and their counsel a reasonable opportunity to review and comment on
such document or response and shall give due consideration to all reasonable
additions, deletions or changes suggested thereto by Parent, Merger Sub and
their counsel.

 



 

5.5 _Appropriate Action; Consents; Filings_.

 



 

(a) Subject to the terms of this Agreement, the Company and Parent will use
their respective reasonable best efforts to (i) take, or cause to be taken,
all appropriate action and do, or cause to be done, all things necessary,
proper or advisable under applicable Law or otherwise to consummate and make
effective the transactions contemplated by this Agreement as promptly as
practicable and (ii) obtain from any Governmental Entities any consents,
licenses, permits, waivers, approvals, authorizations or orders required to be
obtained by Parent or the Company or any of their respective Subsidiaries, or
to avoid any Proceeding by any Governmental Entity (including, without
limitation, those in connection with the HSR Act), in connection with the
authorization, execution and delivery of this Agreement and the consummation
of the transactions contemplated herein, including the Merger; _provided_ ,
that the Company and Parent will cooperate with each other in connection with
(A) determining whether any action by or in respect of, or filing with, any
Governmental Entity is required, in connection with the consummation of the
Merger and (B) seeking any such actions, consents, approvals or waivers or
making any such filings. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Company shall not
commit to the payment of any material fee, penalty or other consideration or
make any other material concession, waiver or amendment under any Contract in
connection with obtaining any consents, licenses, permits, waivers, approvals,
authorizations or orders without the prior written consent of Parent. The
Company and Parent will furnish to each other all information required for any
application or other filing under the rules and regulations of any applicable
Law in connection with the transactions contemplated by this Agreement. The
Company and Parent, as the case may be, will give (or will cause their
respective Subsidiaries to give) any notices to third parties, and use, and
cause their respective Subsidiaries to use, their commercially reasonable
efforts to obtain all required consents, approvals or waivers from third
parties, including as required under any Company Material Contract, including
any of the foregoing which are (x) necessary, proper or advisable to
consummate the transactions contemplated by this Agreement or (y) required to
be disclosed in the Company Disclosure Schedule or the Parent Disclosure
Schedule, as applicable.

 



      
 

 



 

(b) In furtherance and not in limitation of _Section 5.5(a)_, each party
hereto agrees to make any appropriate filings, if necessary or advisable,
pursuant to the HSR Act or other applicable Competition Laws with respect to
the Merger as promptly as practicable and in any event within five Business
Days of the date of this Agreement (unless otherwise mutually agreed between
the parties). Each of Parent, Merger Sub and the Company will (i) cooperate
and coordinate with the other in the making of any filings or submissions that
are required to be made under any applicable Competition Laws or requested to
be made by any Governmental Entity in connection with the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement, (ii) supply the other or its outside counsel
with any information that may be required or requested by any Governmental

any such filings or submissions are made under any applicable Competition Laws
as promptly as practicable, and (iv) use their reasonable best efforts to
cause the expiration or termination of the applicable waiting periods under
any applicable Competition Laws as soon as reasonably practicable. Without
limiting the generality of the foregoing, Parent will not, and will not permit
any of its Subsidiaries to, enter into or publicly announce an agreement to
form a joint venture, strategic alliance or strategic partnership or to
acquire any assets, business or company if such agreement, individually or in
the aggregate, would reasonably be expected to cause any condition to the
Merger in _Article 6_ not to be satisfied or would reasonably be expected to
have the effect of preventing, materially impairing, materially delaying or
otherwise materially and adversely affecting the consummation of the Merger.

 



 

(c) Notwithstanding any other provision of this Agreement to the contrary, in
no event shall Parent or Merger Sub be required to: (i) agree or proffer to
divest or hold separate (in a trust or otherwise), or take any other action
with respect to, any of the assets or businesses of Ultimate Parent, Parent,
Merger Sub or, assuming the consummation of the Merger, the Surviving
Corporation or any of its Affiliates; (ii) agree or proffer to limit in any
manner whatsoever or not to exercise any rights of ownership of any securities
(including the Shares); or (iii) enter into any agreement that in any way
limits the ownership or operation of any business of Ultimate Parent, Parent,
the Company, the Surviving Corporation or any of their respective Affiliates,
in each case if such action would be material to the business and financial
condition of Parent and its Subsidiaries (taken as a whole) or to the value of
the Company and its Subsidiaries (taken as a whole) to Parent after
consummation of the Merger (any such action contemplated by clauses (i), (ii)
or (iii) referred to as, a " _Material Structural Remedy_ ").

 



 

(d) Without limiting the generality of anything contained in this _Section
5.5_, each party hereto will: (i) give the other parties prompt notice of the
making or commencement or receipt of any request, inquiry, investigation,
action or legal proceeding by or before any Governmental Entity with respect
to the Merger or any of the other transactions contemplated by this Agreement;
(ii) keep the other parties informed as to the status of any such request,
inquiry, investigation, action or legal proceeding; and (iii) promptly inform
the other parties of any communication to or from the Federal Trade
Commission, the Department of Justice or any other Governmental Entity
regarding the Merger. Each party hereto will consult and cooperate with the
other parties and will consider in good faith the views of the other parties
in connection with any filing, analysis, appearance, presentation, memorandum,
brief, argument, opinion or proposal made or submitted in connection with the
Merger or any of the other transactions contemplated by this Agreement. In
addition, except as may be prohibited by any Governmental Entity or by any
Law, in connection with any such request, inquiry, investigation, action or
legal proceeding, each party hereto will permit authorized Representatives of
the other parties to be present at each meeting or conference relating to such
request, inquiry, investigation, action or legal proceeding and to have access
to and be consulted in connection with any document, opinion or proposal made
or submitted to any Governmental Entity in connection with such request,
inquiry, investigation, action or legal proceeding.

 



       
 

 



 

5.6 _Certain Notices_. From and after the date of this Agreement until the
Effective Time, each party hereto will promptly notify the other party hereto
of (a) the occurrence, or non-occurrence, of any event that would be likely to
cause any condition to the obligations of any party to effect the Merger or
any other transaction contemplated by this Agreement not to be satisfied, (b)
the failure of such party to comply with or satisfy in any material respect
any covenant, condition or agreement to be complied with or satisfied by it
pursuant to this Agreement (c) any notice or other communication received by
such party from any Governmental Entity alleging that the consent of such
Person is or may be required in connection with the transactions contemplated
hereby, or (d) any Proceeding commenced or, to such partys knowledge,
threatened against, relating to or involving or otherwise affecting such party
or any of its Subsidiaries which relate to the transactions contemplated
hereby; _provided_ , _however_ , that the delivery of any notice pursuant to
this _Section 5.6_ will not cure any breach of any representation, warranty,
covenant or agreement contained in this Agreement (other than failure to give
such notice) or otherwise limit or affect the rights of any party hereto or
the remedies available hereunder to the party receiving such notice.

 



 

5.7 _Public Announcements_. Each of Parent and Merger Sub, on the one hand,
and the Company, on the other hand, shall, to the extent reasonably
practicable, consult with each other before issuing, and shall give each other
a reasonable opportunity to review and comment upon, any public release,
public statement or other public announcement concerning this Agreement or the
transactions contemplated hereby and shall not issue any such public release,
public statement or other public announcement prior to such consultation and
review, except as such release, statement or announcement may be required by
applicable Law or the rules or regulations of any applicable United States
securities exchange or Governmental Entity to which the relevant party is
subject, in which case the party required to make the release or announcement
will use its commercially reasonable efforts to allow each other party
reasonable time to comment on such release or announcement in advance of such
issuance; _provided_ , that the Company shall not be obligated to consult with
Parent and Merger Sub prior to issuing any public release, public statement or
other public announcement (subject to compliance with _Section 5.3_)
regarding any Acquisition Proposal submitted by any third party prior to the
No-Shop Period Start Date. The Company, Parent and Merger Sub agree that the
press release announcing the execution and delivery of this Agreement will be
a joint release of, and will not be issued prior to the approval of each of,
the Company and Parent.

 



 

5.8 _Employee Benefit Matters_.

 



 

(a) As of and following the Effective Time until the first (1st) anniversary
of the Closing Date, to the extent permitted by applicable Law and the terms
of the applicable employee benefit plans, programs and policies, Ultimate
Parent will (i) provide, or will cause to be provided, to those employees of
the Company who continue to be employed by Ultimate Parent and any other
Subsidiary of Ultimate Parent (each an "Ultimate _Parent Subsidiary_ " and,
collectively, the " _Ultimate Parent Subsidiaries_ ") (individually, "
_Company Employee_ " and collectively, " _Company Employees_ ") cash
compensation, including base salary rate and commission and target bonus
opportunity, on terms that are substantially similar in the aggregate to the
total cash compensation provided to similarly situated employees of Ultimate
Parent, and (ii) permit the Company Employees and, as applicable, their
eligible dependents, to participate in the employee benefit plans, programs or
policies (including without limitation any plan intended to qualify within the
meaning of Section 401(a) of the Code and any vacation, sick, or personal time
off plans or programs) of Ultimate Parent to the extent such Company Employees
do not continue to participate in the Company Benefit Plans, so that each
Company Employee shall have benefits that are substantially similar in the
aggregate to the benefits provided to similarly situated employees of Ultimate
Parent. To the extent Ultimate Parent elects to have Company Employees and
their eligible dependents participate in its employee benefit plans, program
or policies following the Effective Time, Ultimate Parent shall, and shall
cause the Surviving Corporation to, treat, and cause the

 



      
 

 



 

applicable benefit plans in which Company Employees are entitled to
participate to treat, the service of Company Employees with the Company or any
Company Subsidiary or any of their predecessors to the extent previously
recognized by the Company as of the date of this Agreement attributable to any
period before the Effective Time as service rendered to Ultimate Parent, the
Surviving Corporation, any Subsidiary of Ultimate Parent solely for purposes
of eligibility to participate, vesting and applicability of minimum waiting
periods for participation, and not for purposes of benefit accrual (including
minimum pension amount), equity incentive plans and eligibility for early
retirement under any benefit plan of Ultimate Parent or eligibility for
retiree welfare benefit plans or as would otherwise result in a duplication of
benefits. Without limiting the foregoing, Ultimate Parent shall cause any pre-
existing conditions or actively at work or similar limitations, eligibility
waiting periods, evidence of insurability requirements or required physical
examinations under any health or similar plan of Ultimate Parent to be waived
with respect to Company Employees and their eligible dependents; _provided_ ,
_however_ , that with respect to preexisting conditions, such conditions shall
be waived to the extent waived under the corresponding plan in which Company
Employees participated immediately prior to the date Company Employees and
their eligible dependents are transitioned to Ultimate Parents health or
similar plans. Ultimate Parent shall also use commercially reasonable efforts
to cause any deductibles paid by Company Employees under any of the Companys
or the Company Subsidiaries health plans in the plan year in which Company
Employees and their eligible dependents are transitioned to Ultimate Parents
health or similar plans to be credited towards deductibles under the health
plans of Ultimate Parent or any Subsidiary of Ultimate Parent.

 



 

(b) Parent shall cause the Company or the Surviving Corporation, as
applicable, to honor, in accordance with their terms, the employment,
severance and change in control agreements and arrangements that are listed on
_Section 5.8(b)_ of the Company Disclosure Schedule.

 



 

(c) If so instructed by Ultimate Parent in writing at least ten (10) Business
Days prior to the Effective Time, the Company shall terminate, effective as of
the day immediately preceding the Closing Date, any and all 401(k) plans
maintained by the Company or any of its Subsidiaries and the Companys
Nonqualified Deferred Compensation Plan, as amended and restated on December
6, 2011, in each case, as applicable, pursuant to resolutions of the Company
Board or the board of directors of its Subsidiaries, as applicable, which
forms of such resolutions shall be presented to Ultimate Parent at least five
(5) days prior to being executed for review and comment.

 



 

(d) Nothing in this Agreement will require the continued employment of any
Person, and except as expressly set forth in this _Section 5.8_ and as set
forth on _Section 5.8_ of the Company Disclosure Schedule, no provision of
this Agreement will prevent Ultimate Parent, Parent or the Surviving
Corporation from amending or terminating any Company Benefit Plan or benefit
plans of any Ultimate Parent or Ultimate Parent Subsidiaries.

 



 

(e) The Company, Ultimate Parent and Parent acknowledge and agree that all
provisions contained in this _Section 5.8_ with respect to employees are
included for the sole benefit of the respective parties and will not create
any right in any other Person, including any employees, former employees, any
participant in any Company Benefit Plan or any beneficiary thereof, nor will
require the Company to continue or amend any particular benefit plan after the
consummation of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement for any
employee or former employee of the Company, and any such plan may be amended
or terminated in accordance with its terms and Applicable Law.

 



 

5.9 _Indemnification of Directors and Officers_.

 



 

(a) For a period of six years from and after the Effective Time, the Surviving
Corporation will indemnify and hold harmless all past and present directors,
officers and employees of the Company to the same extent such Persons are
indemnified as of the date of this Agreement by the

 



      
 

 



 

Company pursuant to applicable Law, the Company Articles, the Company Bylaws
and indemnification agreements as in effect on the date of this Agreement and
previously made available to Parent with any directors and officers of the
Company arising out of acts or omissions in their capacity as directors or
officers of the Company or any Company Subsidiary occurring at or prior to the
Effective Time. To the extent applicable, the Surviving Corporation will
advance expenses (including reasonable legal fees and expenses) incurred in
the defense of any Proceedings with respect to the matters subject to
indemnification pursuant to this _Section 5.9(a)_ in accordance with the
procedures set forth in the Company Bylaws and indemnification agreements as
in effect on the date of this Agreement and in the form previously made
available to Parent.

 



 

(b) For a period of six years from and after the Effective Time, Parent will
cause the articles of incorporation and bylaws of the Surviving Corporation to
contain provisions no less favorable with respect to exculpation and
indemnification of directors and officers of the Company for periods at or
prior to the Effective Time than are currently set forth in the Company
Articles and the Company Bylaws. Parent acknowledges that the indemnification
agreements in existence on the date of this Agreement with any of the
directors, officers or employees of the Company continue in full force and
effect in accordance with their terms following the Effective Time as
obligations of the Surviving Corporation.

 



 

(c) For six years from and after the Effective Time, Parent will cause the
Surviving Corporation to maintain for the benefit of the Companys directors
and officers, as of the date of this Agreement and as of the Effective Time,
an insurance and indemnification policy that provides coverage for events
occurring prior to the Effective Time (the " _D andO Insurance_") that is
substantially equivalent to and in any event not less favorable in the
aggregate than the Companys existing policy (accurate and complete copies of
which have been previously provided to Parent) or, if substantially equivalent
insurance coverage is unavailable, the best available coverage; _provided_ ,
_however_ , that the Surviving Corporation will not be required to pay an
annual premium for the DandO Insurance in excess of 250% of the last annual
premium paid prior to the date of this Agreement (which annual premium is
hereby represented and warranted by the Company to be as set forth in _Section
5.9(c)_ of the Company Disclosure Schedule). The provisions of the immediately
preceding sentence will be deemed to have been satisfied if the Company has
obtained, prior to the Effective Time, prepaid policies, which policies
provide such directors and officers with coverage for an aggregate period of
six years with respect to claims arising from facts or events that occurred on
or before the Effective Time, including, without limitation, in respect of the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement. If such prepaid policies have
been obtained prior to the Effective Time, Parent will cause the Surviving
Corporation to maintain such policies in full force and effect, continue to
honor the obligations thereunder, and not take any action to terminate such
policies.

 



 

(d) In the event the Surviving Corporation (i) consolidates with or merges
into any other Person and will not be the continuing or surviving corporation
or entity of such consolidation or merger or (ii) transfers all or
substantially all of its properties and assets to any Person, then proper
provision will be made so that such continuing or surviving corporation or
entity or transferee of such assets, as the case may be, will assume the
obligations set forth in this _Section 5.9_.

 



 

(e) The obligations under this _Section 5.9_ will (i) continue,
notwithstanding any six-year limitation referred to above, until the final
disposition of any Proceeding or investigation brought or commenced during
such six year period and (ii) not be terminated or modified in such a manner
as to adversely affect any indemnitee to whom this _Section 5.9_ applies
without the consent of such affected indemnitee (it being expressly agreed
that the indemnitees to whom this _Section 5.9_ applies will be third-party
beneficiaries of this _Section 5.9_).

 



      
 

 



 

5.10 _State Takeover Laws_. The Company and the Company Board shall (a) take
no action to cause any "control share acquisition," "fair price," "business
combination" or other anti-takeover Law to become applicable to this
Agreement, the Merger, the acquisition of Shares pursuant thereto, the Voting
Agreement or any of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement and (b) if
any "control share acquisition," "fair price," "business combination" or other
anti-takeover Laws becomes or is deemed to be applicable to the Company,
Parent or Merger Sub, in each case, in connection with this Agreement, the
Merger, the acquisition of Shares pursuant thereto, the Voting Agreement or
any of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, take all action
necessary to minimize the effect of such Law or to render such Law
inapplicable to the foregoing and to ensure that the foregoing may be
consummated as promptly as practicable on the terms contemplated by this
Agreement.

 



 

5.11 _Parent Agreement Concerning Merger Sub_. Parent agrees to cause Merger
Sub to comply with its obligations under this Agreement.

 



 

5.12 _Section 16 Matters_. Prior to the Effective Time, the Company Board, or
an appropriate committee of non-employee directors thereof, will adopt a
resolution consistent with the interpretive guidance of the SEC so that the
disposition by any officer or director of the Company who is a covered Person
of the Company for purposes of Section 16 of the Exchange Act (" _Section
16_") of Shares, Company RSUs or Company Options pursuant to this Agreement
and the Merger will be an exempt transaction for purposes of Section 16.

 



 

5.13 _Stock Exchange Delisting; Deregistration_. Prior to the Closing Date,
the Company and Parent will cooperate and use their respective reasonable best
efforts to cause the delisting of the Shares from NASDAQ and the
deregistration of such Shares as promptly as practicable following the
Effective Time in compliance with applicable Law, and in any event no more
than ten days after the Closing Date.

 



 

5.14 _Shareholder Litigation_. The Company will promptly provide Parent with
any pleadings and correspondence relating to any Proceedings involving the
Company or any of its officers or directors relating to this Agreement or the
transactions contemplated hereby and will keep Parent reasonably informed
regarding the status of any such Proceedings. The Company will cooperate with,
and to the extent reasonably practicable, give Parent the opportunity to
consult and participate with respect to the defense or settlement of any such
Proceeding, and no such settlement will be agreed to without the prior written
consent of Parent (such consent not to be unreasonably withheld, delayed or
conditioned).

 



 

5.15 _Financing_. Ultimate Parent shall take, or cause to be taken, all
actions and do, or cause to be done, all things necessary or advisable to
arrange the Debt Financing on the terms and conditions described in the Debt
Commitment Letter and to consummate the Debt Financing on the Closing Date.
Such actions shall include, but not be limited to, the following: (i)
maintaining in effect the Debt Commitment Letter; (ii) participation by senior
management of Ultimate Parent in, and assistance with, the preparation of
rating agency presentations and meetings with rating agencies; (iii)
satisfying on a timely basis all Financing Conditions applicable to Ultimate
Parent in the Debt Commitment Letter that are within its control; (iv)
negotiating, executing and delivering Debt Financing Documents that reflect
the terms contained in the Debt Commitment Letter (to the extent required to
consummate the transactions contemplated hereunder) (including any "market
flex" provisions related thereto) or on such other terms acceptable to
Ultimate Parent and its financings sources; and (v) in the event that the
conditions set forth in _Section 6.1_ and _Section 6.2_ and the Financing
Conditions have been satisfied or, upon funding, would be satisfied, cause the
financing providers to fund the full amount of the Debt Financing to the
extent the proceeds thereof are needed to fund transactions contemplated
hereunder. Ultimate Parent shall give the Company reasonably prompt notice of
any breach, repudiation

 



      
 

 



 

or threatened (in writing) breach or repudiation by any party to the Debt
Commitment Letter of which Ultimate Parent or its Affiliates becomes aware.
Without limiting Ultimate Parents other obligations under this _Section
5.15_, if a Financing Failure Event occurs, Ultimate Parent shall (A) promptly
notify the Company of such Financing Failure Event and the reasons therefor,
(B) use commercially reasonable efforts to obtain alternative financing from
alternative financing sources (on terms not materially less favorable to
Ultimate Parent (as determined in the reasonable judgment of Ultimate Parent,
taking into account any "market flex" provisions related to the Debt
Commitment Letter) than those contained in the Debt Commitment Letter), in an
amount sufficient, together with other financial resources of Ultimate Parent,
Parent and Merger Sub, to pay the aggregate Merger Consideration, Option
Payments and RSU Payments pursuant to this Agreement and consummate the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement, as promptly as practicable
following the occurrence of such event, and (C) if and when obtained, provide
the Company with a true and complete copy of a new financing commitment that
provides for such alternative financing. Ultimate Parent shall have the right
from time to time to amend, modify, supplement, restate, assign, substitute or
replace any of the Debt Commitment Letter or any Debt Financing Document from
the same and/or an alternative Financing Source; _provided_ , that any such
amendment, modification, supplement, restatement, assignment, substitution or
replacement shall not, without the prior written consent of the Company (such
consent not to be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed) (1) add any
conditions precedent or other contingencies related to the funding of the Debt
Financing on the Closing Date (beyond the Financing Conditions) that would
result in the conditions to such funding being materially less likely to be
satisfied or (2) be reasonably expected to impede or delay in any material
respect the consummation of the Merger and the other transactions contemplated
by this Agreement. For purposes of this _Section 5.15_ and _Section 5.16_
below, references to "Debt Financing" shall include the financing contemplated
by the Debt Commitment Letter as permitted to be amended, modified,
supplemented, restated, assigned, substituted or replaced by this _Section
5.15_ (including in the event of a Financing Failure Event) and references to
"Debt Financing Documents" or "Debt Commitment Letter" shall include such
documents as permitted to be amended, modified, supplemented, restated,
assigned, substituted or replaced by this _Section 5.15_ (including in the
event of a Financing Failure Event). Ultimate Parent shall be permitted to
reduce the amount of Debt Financing under the Debt Commitment Letter in its
reasonable discretion, _provided_ , that Ultimate Parent shall not reduce the
Debt Financing to an amount committed below the amount that is required,
together with other financial resources of Ultimate Parent, Parent and Merger
Sub including cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities of Ultimate
Parent, Parent, Merger Sub, the Company and the Companys Subsidiaries on the
Closing Date, to consummate the Merger on the terms contemplated by this
Agreement, and _provided_ , _further_ , that such reduction shall not (I) add
any conditions precedent or other contingencies related to the funding of the
Debt Financing on the Closing Date (beyond the Financing Conditions) that
would result in the conditions to such funding being materially less likely to
be satisfied or (II) be reasonably expected to impede or delay in any material
respect the consummation of the Merger and the other transactions contemplated
by this Agreement. For the avoidance of doubt, the syndication of the Debt
Financing to the extent permitted by the Debt Commitment Letter and subject to
the conditions contained therein shall not be deemed to violate Ultimate
Parents or Parents obligations under this Agreement. Ultimate Parent shall
consult with and keep the Company informed in reasonable detail of the status
of Ultimate Parents efforts to arrange the Debt Financing.

 



 

5.16 _Financing Cooperation_. The Company shall, and shall cause the Company
Subsidiaries to, use commercially reasonable efforts (including using
commercially reasonable efforts to cause its and their respective
Representatives) to provide to Ultimate Parent, Parent and Merger Sub all
cooperation reasonably requested by Ultimate Parent, Parent and/or the
Financing Sources in connection with the Debt Financing, including using
commercially reasonable efforts to (a) cooperate with customary due diligence
review of the Company and the Company Subsidiaries by prospective Financing
Sources and with the marketing efforts of Ultimate Parent, Parent and Merger
Sub and their Financing Sources, in each case in connection with all or any
portion of the Debt Financing, (b) assist with the preparation of a

 



      
 

 



 

pro forma consolidated balance sheet and related pro forma consolidated
statement of income of Ultimate Parent, prepared after giving effect to the
Merger as if the Merger had occurred as of such date (in the case of such
balance sheet) or at the beginning of such period (in the case of the income
statement), (c) obtain accountants comfort letters and consents to the use of
accountants audit reports relating to financial information included in the
Company SEC Documents that is used in any prospectus or other offering
document for the Debt Financing and (d) obtain a payoff letter for the Credit
Agreement and taking all actions necessary for the termination of the Credit
Agreement effective as of the Closing Date. The Company hereby consents to the
use of the Companys and the Company Subsidiaries logos in connection with
the Debt Financing; _provided_ , that in no event shall the any failure by the
Company to comply with this _Section 5.16_ constitute material breach of this
Agreement or provide Parent with any right to terminate this Agreement in
accordance with its terms.

 



 

5.17 _Resignation of Directors_. The Company shall use its best efforts to
obtain and deliver to Parent on or prior to the Effective Time the resignation
of the Companys directors.

part of Parent, Merger Sub or the Company or their respective Subsidiaries,

_Section 7.2_, _Section 8.2_ (Fees and Expenses), _Section 8.3_ (Notices),
_Section 8.7_ (Severability), _Section 8.8_ (Entire Agreement), _Section
8.9_ (Parties in Interest), _Section 8.10_ (Assignment; Successors), _Section
8.11_ (Mutual Drafting; Interpretation) and _Section 8.12_ (Governing Law;
Consent to Jurisdiction; Waiver of Trial by Jury) shall survive the
termination hereof and (ii) with respect to any liabilities or damages
incurred or suffered by a party as a result of the willful and material breach
by another party of any of its representations, warranties, covenants or other
agreements set forth in this Agreement (which the parties acknowledge and
agree will not be limited to reimbursement of expenses or out-of-pocket
costs). Notwithstanding the foregoing, in no event shall any party be liable
for punitive damages.

 



 

(b) In the event that this Agreement is terminated pursuant to _Section
7.1(c)_ or _Section 7.1(d)_, then the Company will pay to Parent prior to or
concurrent with such termination, in the case of a termination by the Company,
or within two Business Days thereafter, in the case of a termination by
Parent, the Breakup Fee.

 



 

(c) In the event that (i) this Agreement is terminated pursuant to _Section
7.1(e)_, _Section 7.1(f)_ (with respect to a breach of any covenant or an
intentional misrepresentation under this

 



      
 

 



 

Agreement by the Company) or _Section 7.1(h)_, (ii) prior to the date of the
Company Shareholder Meeting (or prior to the termination of this Agreement if
there has been no Company Shareholder Meeting) an Acquisition Proposal or
intention to make an Acquisition Proposal will have been publicly announced
and not publicly withdrawn without qualification (A) on or prior to the fifth
Business Day prior to the date of the Company Shareholder Meeting, with
respect to termination pursuant to _Section 7.1(h)_, (B) on or prior to the
45th calendar day preceding the Outside Date, with respect to any termination

recommends or submits an Acquisition Proposal to its shareholders for
adoption, or a transaction in respect of any Acquisition Proposal is

that was made, disclosed or communicated prior to termination, then, on the
earliest of the execution of a definitive agreement with respect to,
submission to the shareholders of, or consummation of such Acquisition
Proposal, the Company will pay to Parent the Breakup Fee ( _provided_ , that
for purposes of this _Section 7.2(c)_, the term " _Acquisition Proposal_ "

references to "20%" will be deemed to be references to "50.1%").

 



 

(d) All payments under this _Section 7.2_ will be made by wire transfer of

7.2_ are an integral part of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement,
(ii) without these agreements, Parent, Merger Sub and the Company would not
enter into this Agreement and (iii) the Breakup Fee is not a penalty, but
rather is liquidated damages in a reasonable amount that will compensate
Parent and Merger Sub in the circumstances in which such Breakup Fee is
payable. Accordingly, if the Company fails promptly to pay any amounts due
pursuant to this _Section 7.2_, and, in order to obtain such payment, Parent
commences a suit that results in a final non-appealable judgment against the
Company for the amounts set forth in this _Section 7.2_, the Company shall
pay to Parent its reasonable out-of-pocket costs and expenses (including
reasonable out-of-pocket attorneys fees and expenses) in connection with such
suit, together with interest on the amounts due pursuant to this _Section
7.2_ from the date such payment was required to be made until the date of
payment at the prime lending rate as published in The Wall Street Journal in
effect on the date such payment was required to be made.

 



 

(e) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement, no Financing
Source Party shall have any liability for any obligation or liability to the
Company, any of its Affiliates or any of its or their direct or indirect
shareholders for any claim for any loss suffered as a result of any breach of
this Agreement or the Debt Commitment Letter (including any willful and
material breach), or the failure of the Merger or any other transaction
contemplated hereby or thereby (including, without limitation, any Debt
Financing) to be consummated, or in respect of any oral representation made or
alleged to have been made in connection herewith or therewith, whether in
equity or at law, in contract, in tort or otherwise.

 



 

(f) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement, the payment by
the Company of the Breakup Fee pursuant to this _Section 7.2_ shall not
relieve the Company from any liability or damage resulting from a willful and
material breach of any of its covenants or agreements set forth in this
Agreement or fraud; _provided_ , _however_ , that notwithstanding the
foregoing, if Parent accepts payment from the Company of the Breakup Fee in
connection with a termination of this Agreement pursuant to (i) _Section
7.1(c)_ pursuant to subclause (f) of the definition of "Triggering Event" or
(ii) _Section 7.1(d)_, _provided_ that the Company did not commit a willful
and material breach of any of its covenants or agreements in _Section 5.3_,
whether discovered by Parent prior to or following the acceptance of the
Breakup Fee, such payment shall be the sole and exclusive remedy of Ultimate
Parent,

 



       
 

 



 

Parent and Merger Sub against the Company, the Company Subsidiaries and the
Company Representatives for any losses or damages arising from or relating to
this Agreement, any breach of any representation, warranty, covenant or
agreement in this Agreement or the failure of the Merger to be consummated,
and none of the Company, the Company Subsidiaries and the Company
Representatives shall have any further liability or obligation relating to or
arising out of this Agreement or the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement; _provided_ , _further_ , that any Breakup Fee paid by the Company
to Parent pursuant to this _Section 7.2_ shall be offset against any award
for damages awarded to Parent pursuant to any claim based on a willful and
material breach of this Agreement or fraud.

 



 

7.3 _Amendment_. This Agreement may be amended by the Company, Parent and
Merger Sub by action taken by or on behalf of their respective Boards of
Directors at any time prior to the Effective Time, whether before or after
approval of this Agreement and the Merger by the shareholders of the Company
or of Merger Sub; _provided_ , _however_ , that, after approval of this
Agreement and the Merger by such shareholders, no amendment may be made which,
by Law or in accordance with the rules of any relevant stock exchange,
requires further approval by such shareholders without obtaining such further
approval. This Agreement may not be amended except by an instrument in writing
signed by the parties hereto. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary
contained herein, _Sections 7.2(e)_ , _7.3_ , _8.9_ and _8.12_ (and any
provision of this Agreement to the extent a modification, waiver or
termination of such provision would modify the substance of _Sections 7.2(e)_
, _7.3_ , _8.9_ and _8.12_ ) may not be modified, waived or terminated in a
manner that impacts or is adverse in any respect to the Financing Source
Parties without the prior written consent of the Financing Sources.

 



 

7.4 _Waiver_. At any time prior to the Effective Time, Parent and Merger Sub,
on the one hand, and the Company, on the other hand, may (a) extend the time
for the performance of any of the obligations or other acts of the other, (b)
waive any Uncured Inaccuracies in the representations and warranties of the
other contained herein or in any document delivered pursuant hereto and (c)
waive compliance by the other with any of the agreements or conditions
contained herein. Any such extension or waiver will be valid only if set forth
in an instrument in writing signed by the party or parties to be bound
thereby, but such extension or waiver or failure to insist on strict
compliance with an obligation, covenant, agreement or condition will not
operate as a waiver of, or estoppel with respect to, any subsequent or other
failure.

contained in this Agreement or in any Exhibit are for reference purposes only
and will not affect in any way the meaning or interpretation of this
Agreement.

 



 

8.7 _Severability_. If any term or other provision of this Agreement is
determined to be invalid, illegal or incapable of being enforced by reason of
any rule of Law or public policy, all other conditions and provisions of this
Agreement will nevertheless remain in full force and effect so long as the
economic or legal substance of the transactions contemplated hereby is not
affected in any manner materially adverse to any party hereto and such
determination shall be strictly construed and shall not affect the validity or
effect of any other provision hereof, as long as the remaining provisions,
taken together, are sufficient to carry out the overall intentions of the
parties as evidenced hereby. Upon such determination that any term or other
provision is invalid, illegal or incapable of being enforced, the parties
hereto will negotiate in good faith to modify this Agreement so as to effect
the original intent of the parties hereto as closely as possible in an
acceptable manner to the end that transactions contemplated hereby are
fulfilled to the extent possible.

 



 

8.8 _Entire Agreement_. This Agreement (together with the Exhibits, Parent
Disclosure Schedule and Company Disclosure Schedule and the other documents
delivered pursuant hereto) and the Confidentiality Agreement constitute the
entire agreement of the parties hereto and supersede all prior agreements and
undertakings, both written and oral, among the parties hereto, or any of them,
with respect to the subject matter hereof.

 



 

8.9 _Parties in Interest_.

 



 

(a) This Agreement will be binding upon and inure solely to the benefit of
each party hereto and their respective successors and assigns, and nothing in
this Agreement, express or implied, is intended to or will confer upon any
other Person any right, benefit or remedy of any nature whatsoever under or by
reason of this Agreement except for (i) the individuals referenced in _Section
5.9_, which are express beneficiaries of _Section 5.9_, and (ii) the
Financing Source Parties, which are express third-party beneficiaries of
_Sections 7.2(e)_, _7.3_ , _8.9_ and _8.12_ and entitled to enforce such
provisions against each of the parties hereto.

 



 

(b) The representations and warranties in this Agreement are the product of
negotiations among the parties hereto and are for the sole benefit of the
parties hereto. Any inaccuracies in such representations and warranties are
subject to waiver by the parties hereto in accordance with _Section 7.4_
without notice or liability to any other Person. In some instances, the
representations and warranties in this Agreement may represent an allocation
among the parties hereto of risks associated with particular matters
regardless of the knowledge of any of the parties hereto. Consequently,
Persons (other than the parties hereto) may not rely upon the representations
and warranties in this Agreement as characterizations of actual facts or
circumstances as of the date of this Agreement or as of any other date.

 



      
 

 



 

8.10 _Assignment; Successors_. This Agreement will not be assigned by any
party hereto by operation of Law or otherwise without the prior written
consent of the other parties hereto, and any such assignment without such
prior written consent shall be null and void; _provided_ , that each of Parent
and Merger Sub may assign, in their sole discretion, any of their respective
rights and obligations to (a) Ultimate Parent, Parent or any of their
Affiliates at any time, in which case all references herein to Parent or
Merger Sub shall be deemed references to such other Affiliate, except that all
representations and warranties made herein with respect to Parent or Merger
Sub as of the date of this Agreement shall be deemed to be representations and
warranties made with respect to such other Affiliate as of the date of such
assignment or (b) after the Effective Time, to any Person; _provided_ , that
no such assignment shall relieve Ultimate Parent, Parent or Merger Sub of its
obligations hereunder or enlarge, alter or change any obligation of any other
party hereto. Subject to the preceding sentence, this Agreement will be
binding upon, inure to the benefit of, and be enforceable by, the parties and
their respective successors and assigns.

 



 

8.11 _Mutual Drafting; Interpretation_. Each party hereto has participated in
the drafting of this Agreement, which each party acknowledges is the result of
extensive negotiations between the parties. If an ambiguity or question of
intent or interpretation arises, this Agreement will be construed as if
drafted jointly by the parties, and no presumption or burden of proof will
arise favoring or disfavoring any party by virtue of the authorship of any
provision. For purposes of this Agreement, whenever the context requires: the
singular number will include the plural, and vice versa; the masculine gender
will include the feminine and neuter genders; the feminine gender will include
the masculine and neuter genders; and the neuter gender will include masculine
and feminine genders. Any capitalized terms used in any Exhibit or Schedule
but not otherwise defined therein shall have the meaning as defined in this
Agreement. As used in this Agreement, the words "include" and "including," and

of limitation, but rather will be deemed to be followed by the words "without
limitation." Except as otherwise indicated, all references in this Agreement
