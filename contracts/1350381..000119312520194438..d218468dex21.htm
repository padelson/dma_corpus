ARTICLE I

THE MERGER

Section 1.01 _The_ _Merger_. Upon the terms and subject to the conditions
of this Agreement, and in accordance with the DGCL, at the Effective Time, Sub
shall be merged with and into the Company, whereupon the separate existence of
Sub shall cease, and the Company shall continue as the surviving
corporation (the " _Surviving Corporation_ ") and shall succeed to and assume
all the rights and obligations of Sub and the Company in accordance with
Section 259 of the DGCL.

 

Section 1.02 _Closing_. The closing of the Merger (the " _Closing_ ")
will take place remotely by the exchange of documents and signatures
(electronic or otherwise) or at the offices of Sidley Austin LLP, One South
Dearborn, Chicago, Illinois 60603, or at another place agreed to in writing by
the parties, on the fifth (5th) Business Day following the satisfaction or
(to the extent permitted by Law) waiver by the party or parties entitled to
the benefits thereof of the conditions set forth in _Article_ __ _ VI_ (other
than those conditions that by their nature are to be satisfied at the
Closing, but subject to the satisfaction or (to the extent permitted by Law)
waiver of those conditions at the Closing), or at such other place, time and
date as shall be agreed in writing between the Company and Parent. The date
on which the Closing actually occurs is referred to herein as the " _Closing
Date_ ".

 

Section 1.03 _Effective Time_. Concurrently with the Closing, the Company
shall file a certificate of merger with respect to the Merger (the "
_Certificate of Merger_ ") with the Secretary of State of the State of
Delaware in such form as required by, and executed in accordance with, the
applicable provisions of the DGCL. The Merger shall become effective on the
date and time at which the Certificate of Merger has been duly filed with the
Secretary of State of the State of Delaware or at such other date and time as
is agreed between the parties and specified in the Certificate of Merger
(such date and time, the " _Effective Time_ ").

 

Section 1.04 _Organizational Documents, Directors and Officers of the
Surviving Corporation_.

(a) _Organizational Documents_. At the Effective Time (i) the Company
Charter, as in effect immediately prior to the Effective Time, shall be
amended and restated to read in its entirety as set forth in _Exhibit_ __ _
A_, and as so amended and restated shall be the certificate of incorporation
of the Surviving Corporation, and (ii) the Company Bylaws shall be amended
and restated in their entirety to read as the bylaws of Sub, as in effect
immediately prior to the Effective Time, and as so amended and restated, shall
be the bylaws of the Surviving Corporation (except that references

 



2

    

 to the name of Sub shall be replaced by references to the name of the
Surviving Corporation), in each case until thereafter amended in accordance
with applicable Law and the applicable provisions of the certificate of
incorporation and bylaws of the Surviving Corporation.

(b) _Directors_. Subject to applicable Law, the board of directors of the
Surviving Corporation effective as of, and immediately following, the
Effective Time shall consist of the members of the board of directors of Sub
immediately prior to the Effective Time, each to hold office in accordance
with the certificate of incorporation and bylaws of the Surviving Corporation.

 

(c) _Officers_. From and after the Effective Time, the officers of the
Company at the Effective Time shall be the officers of the Surviving
Corporation, each to hold office in accordance with the certificate of
incorporation and bylaws of the Surviving Corporation.

 

ARTICLE II

EFFECT OF THE MERGER ON CAPITAL STOCK

Section 2.01 _Conversion of Securities_.

 

(a) At the Effective Time, by virtue of the Merger and without any action
on the part of Parent, Sub, the Company or the holders of any capital stock
of the Company or Sub:

(i) _Conversion of Company Common Stock_. Each share of common stock, par
value $0.0001 per share, of the Company (the " _Company Common Stock_ ")
including each outstanding award of Shares subject to forfeiture restrictions
or other restrictions (" _Restricted Stock_ ") (each, a " _Share_ " and
collectively, the " _Shares_ "), issued and outstanding immediately prior to
the Effective Time, other than Shares to be cancelled in accordance with
_Section_ __ _ 2.01(a)(ii)_ and other than Dissenting Shares, shall
automatically be converted at the Effective Time into the right to receive
$3.00 in cash, without interest (the " _Merger Consideration_ "), and all of
such Shares shall cease to be outstanding, shall be cancelled and shall cease
to exist, and each certificate representing a Share (a " _Certificate_ ") or
non-certificated Share represented by book-entry (" _Book-Entry Shares_ ")
that formerly represented any of the Shares (other than Shares to be cancelled
in accordance with _Section_ __ _ 2.01(a)(ii)_ and other than Dissenting
Shares) shall thereafter be cancelled and cease to have any rights with
respect thereto, except the right to receive the Merger Consideration without
interest thereon, subject to _Section_ __ _ 2.05_.

 

(ii) _Cancellation of Company-Owned Shares and Parent-Owned Shares_. All
Shares that are held in the treasury of the Company or owned of record by any
wholly owned Company Subsidiary and all Shares owned of record by Parent, Sub
or any of their respective wholly owned Subsidiaries (in each case, other than
those held on behalf of any third party) shall be cancelled and shall cease
to exist, with no payment being made with respect thereto.

(iii) _Capital Stock of Sub_. Each issued and outstanding share of
capital stock of Sub shall be automatically converted into and become one
validly issued, fully paid and nonassessable share of common stock, par value
$0.001 per share, of the Surviving Corporation and shall constitute the only
outstanding shares of capital stock of the Surviving Corporation as of
immediately after the Effective Time.

 



3

    

(b) _Merger Consideration Adjustment_. Notwithstanding anything in this
Agreement to the contrary, if, from the date of this Agreement until the
Effective Time, the number of outstanding Shares shall have been changed into
a different number of Shares or a different class by reason of any
reclassification, stock split (including a reverse stock split),
recapitalization, split-up, combination, exchange of shares, readjustment or
other similar transaction, or a stock dividend or stock distribution thereon
shall be declared with a record date within said period, the Merger
Consideration shall be appropriately adjusted to provide the holders of Shares
the same economic effect as contemplated by this Agreement prior to such
event; _provided_ , that nothing in this _Section_ __ _ 2.01(b)_ shall be
deemed to permit or authorize the Company to effect any such change that it is
not authorized or permitted to undertake pursuant to this Agreement.

 

Section 2.02 _Exchange of Certificates; Payment for Shares_.

 

(a) _Paying Agent_. Prior to the Effective Time, Parent shall designate a
U.S.-based nationally recognized financial institution reasonably acceptable
to the Company to act as agent (the " _Paying Agent_ ") for the holders of
Shares (other than Shares of Restricted Stock) to receive the funds to which
such holders shall become entitled pursuant to this Agreement and, without
limiting the generality of _Section_ __ _ 5.02(b)_, deposit or caused to be
deposited, prior to or concurrently with the Effective Time, with the Paying
Agent, in immediately available funds, a cash amount equal to the Aggregate
Common Stock Consideration (the " _Exchange Fund_ "). The Exchange Fund shall
be held in trust by the Paying Agent for the benefit of the holders of Shares
(other than Shares of Restricted Stock) that are entitled to receive the
Merger Consideration. In the event the Exchange Fund shall be insufficient to
make the payments contemplated by this _Section_ __ _ 2.02_, Parent shall
promptly deposit, or cause to be deposited, additional funds with the Paying
Agent in an amount sufficient to make such payments. Funds made available to
the Paying Agent shall, if Parent so elects, be invested by the Paying Agent,
as directed by Parent, in short-term obligations of, or short-term
obligations fully guaranteed as to principal and interest by, the United
States of America with maturities of no more than thirty (30) days or in
commercial paper obligations rated A-1 or P1 or better by Moodys Investors
Service, Inc. or Standard and Poors Corporation, pending payment thereof by the
Paying Agent to the holders of Shares (other than Shares of Restricted Stock)
pursuant to this  _Section_ __ _ 2.02_; _provided_ , that no investment of
such deposited funds shall relieve Parent, the Surviving Corporation or the
Paying Agent from promptly making the payments required by this  _Article_ __
_ II_, and following any losses from any such investment, Parent shall
promptly provide or cause to be provided additional funds to the Paying Agent,
to be held in trust by the Paying Agent for the benefit of the holders of
Shares (other than Shares of Restricted Stock), in the amount of such losses,
which additional funds will be held and disbursed in the same manner as funds
initially deposited with the Paying Agent to make the payments contemplated
by this _Section_ __ _ 2.02_. Any interest or income produced by such
investments will be payable to Sub or Parent, as Parent directs. Parent shall
direct the Paying Agent to hold the Exchange Fund for the benefit of the
former holders of Shares (other than Shares of Restricted Stock) and to make
payments from the Exchange Fund in accordance with this _Section_ __ _ 2.02_.
The Exchange Fund shall not be used for any purpose other than to fund
payments pursuant to this _Section_ __ _ 2.02_, except as expressly provided
for in this Agreement.

 

(b) _Procedures for Surrender_. As promptly as practicable after the
Closing and in any event not later than the second (2nd) Business Day
thereafter, Parent shall cause the Paying Agent to mail to each holder of
record of a Certificate whose Shares (other than Shares of Restricted

 



4

    

 Stock) were converted into the right to receive the Merger Consideration
pursuant to this Agreement: (i) a letter of transmittal in customary form,
which shall specify that delivery shall be effected, and risk of loss and
title to the Certificates shall pass, only upon delivery of the Certificate
(or affidavit of loss in lieu thereof in accordance with _Section_ __ _
2.02(e)_) to the Paying Agent, and shall otherwise be in such form and have
such other provisions as Parent may reasonably specify, subject to the
reasonable consent of the Company; and (ii) instructions for effecting the
surrender of the Certificates in exchange for payment of the
Merger Consideration. Upon surrender of a Certificate (or affidavit of loss
in lieu thereof in accordance with _Section_ __ _ 2.02(e)_) for cancellation
to the Paying Agent, and upon delivery of a letter of transmittal, duly
executed and in proper form, with respect to such Certificate and such other
documents as may be customarily required by the Paying Agent, the holder of
such Certificate shall be entitled to receive in exchange therefor the portion
of the Aggregate Common Stock Consideration into which the Shares formerly
represented by such Certificate were converted pursuant to _Section_ __ _
2.01(a)(i)_ (less any required Tax withholdings as provided in _Section_ __ _
2.05_), and the Certificate so surrendered shall forthwith be cancelled. In
the event of a transfer of ownership of Shares that is not registered in the
transfer records of the Company, payment may be made and Merger Consideration
may be issued to a person other than the person in whose name the Certificate
so surrendered is registered, if such Certificate shall be properly endorsed
or shall otherwise be in proper form for transfer and the person requesting
such payment shall pay to the Paying Agent any transfer and other similar
Taxes required by reason of the payment of the Merger Consideration to a
person other than the registered holder of the Certificate so surrendered or
shall establish to the reasonable satisfaction of the Paying Agent that such
Taxes either have been paid or are not required to be paid. Each registered
holder of a Book-Entry Share shall automatically upon the Effective Time be
entitled to receive the Merger Consideration, and Parent shall cause payment
of the Merger Consideration with respect to Book-Entry Shares (less any
required Tax withholdings as provided in _Section_ __ _ 2.05_) to be made to
the person in whose name such Book-Entry Shares are registered promptly
following the Effective Time (but in no event more than two (2) Business Days
thereafter) without any action on the part of the person in whose name such
Book-Entry Shares are registered. No interest shall be paid or accrue on any
portion of the Merger Consideration payable upon surrender of any Certificate
(or affidavit of loss in lieu thereof in accordance with _Section_ __ _
2.02(e)_) or in respect of any Book-Entry Share.

(c) _Transfer Books; No Further Ownership Rights in Shares_. As of the
Effective Time, the stock transfer books of the Company shall be closed, and
thereafter there shall be no further registration of transfers of Shares on
the records of the Company. The Merger Consideration paid in accordance with
the terms of this  _Article_ __ _ II_ shall be deemed to have been paid in
full satisfaction of all rights pertaining to any Shares. From and after the
Effective Time, the holders of Shares outstanding immediately prior to the
Effective Time shall cease to have any rights with respect to such Shares
except as otherwise provided for in this Agreement or by applicable Law. If,
after the Effective Time, Certificates are presented to the Surviving
Corporation for any reason, they shall be cancelled and exchanged as provided
in this Agreement.

(d) _Termination of Exchange Fund; Abandoned Property; No Liability_. At
any time following the first anniversary of the Effective Time, the Surviving
Corporation shall be entitled to require the Paying Agent to deliver to it any
portion of the Exchange Fund (including any interest received with
respect thereto) not disbursed to holders of Shares, and thereafter such
holders shall be entitled to look only to the Surviving Corporation (subject
to abandoned property,

 



5

    

 escheat or other similar Laws) with respect to the Merger Consideration
payable upon due surrender of their Shares and compliance with the procedures
set forth in  _Section_ __ _ 2.02(b)_, without interest. Notwithstanding the
foregoing, none of Parent, the Surviving Corporation or the Paying Agent shall
be liable to any person for any portion of the Exchange Fund or the holder of
a Share for Merger Consideration delivered to a public official pursuant to
any applicable abandoned property, escheat or similar Law.

 

(e) _Lost, Stolen or Destroyed Certificates_. If any Certificate shall
have been lost, stolen or destroyed, upon the making of an affidavit (in form
and substance reasonably acceptable to Parent) of that fact by the person
claiming such Certificate to be lost, stolen or destroyed, the Paying Agent or
the Surviving Corporation, as applicable, shall issue in exchange for such
lost, stolen or destroyed Certificate the portion of the Aggregate Common
Stock Consideration into which the Shares formerly represented by such
Certificate were converted pursuant to _Section_ __ _ 2.01(a)(i)_; 
_provided_ , _however_ , that the owner of such lost, stolen or destroyed
Certificate may be required, as a condition precedent to the payment of such
Merger Consideration, to provide a bond in a customary amount if so required
by Parent, as indemnity against any claim that may be made against Parent,
the Paying Agent or the Surviving Corporation.

 

Section 2.03 _Treatment of Company Options, Company SARs, RSUs, Restricted
Stock, Company Stock Plans and Warrant_.

(a) _Treatment of Options_. Prior to the Effective Time, the
Companys board of directors (or, if appropriate, any committee thereof)
shall adopt resolutions that provide that, immediately prior to the Effective
Time, each option to purchase Shares granted pursuant to a Company Stock Plan
that is outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time (the " _Company
Options_ ") shall be fully vested and cancelled by virtue of the Merger and
without any action on the part of the holder thereof and, in exchange
therefor, each holder of any such cancelled Company Option shall be entitled
to receive, in consideration of the cancellation of such Company Option and in
settlement therefor, a payment in cash of an amount equal to the product of
(i) the total number of Shares subject to such cancelled Company Option,
multiplied by (ii) the excess, if any, of (A) the Merger Consideration over
(B) the exercise price per Share subject to such cancelled Company Option,
without interest (such amounts payable hereunder, the " _Option Payments_ ")
(less any required Tax withholdings as provided in _Section_ __ _ 2.05_);
_provided_ , _however_ , that any such Company Option with respect to which
the exercise price per Share subject thereto is equal to or greater than the
Merger Consideration shall be cancelled in exchange for no consideration. From
and after the Effective Time, no Company Option shall be outstanding or
exercisable, and each Company Option holder shall be entitled only to the
payment provided for in this _Section_ __ _ 2.03(a)_.

(b) _Treatment of Stock Appreciation Rights_. Prior to the Effective
Time, the Companys board of directors (or, if appropriate, any committee
thereof) shall adopt resolutions that provide that, immediately prior to the
Effective Time, each stock appreciation right in respect of Shares granted
pursuant to a Company Stock Plan that is outstanding immediately prior to the
Effective Time (the " _Company SARs_ ") shall be fully vested and cancelled by

Shares earned or deemed earned with respect to such RSU Award as provided
herein, without interest (such amounts payable hereunder, the " _RSU Payments_
") (less any required Tax withholdings as provided in _Section_ __ _ 2.05_).
From and after the Effective Time, no RSU Award shall be outstanding, and each
RSU Award holder shall be entitled only to the payment provided for in this 
_Section_ __ _ 2.03(c)_.

(d) _Treatment of Restricted Stock_. Prior to the Effective Time, the

7

    

 with written notice of the Merger, together with such reasonable information
as the Warrant Holder may request in connection therewith, and which is to be
delivered to the Warrant Holder not less than ten (10) days prior to the
Closing), unless the Company receives a notice in writing from the Warrant
Holder that it elects to have the unexercised portion of the Warrant expire,
the unexercised portion of the Warrant shall be deemed to be automatically
exercised pursuant to Section 1.3 of the Warrant immediately prior to the
Effective Time without any action on the part of the Warrant Holder and, in
exchange therefor (in lieu of Shares), the Warrant Holder shall be entitled
to receive, in consideration thereof and in settlement therefor, a payment in

Section 2.04 _Dissenting Shares_. Notwithstanding anything in this

(a " _Dissenting Stockholder_ ") who is entitled to appraisal rights under
Section 262 of the DGCL and has complied with all the provisions of the DGCL
concerning the right of holders of Shares to require appraisal of such Shares
(" _Dissenting Shares_ ") shall not be converted into the right to receive the
Merger Consideration as described in _Section_ __ _ 2.01(a)(i)_, but
shall become the right to receive the fair value of such Shares pursuant to
the procedures set forth in Section 262 of the DGCL. If such Dissenting
Stockholder withdraws such Dissenting Stockholders demand for appraisal or
fails to perfect or otherwise loses such Dissenting Stockholders right of
appraisal with respect to such Shares, in any case pursuant to the DGCL, such
Shares shall be deemed to be converted as of the Effective Time into the right
to receive the Merger Consideration for each such Share, without interest,
upon surrender of the Certificate formerly representing such Share, and
subject to _Section_ __ _ 2.05_. The Company shall give Parent prompt written
notice of any demands for appraisal of Shares received by the Company,
withdrawals or attempted withdrawals of such demands and any other
instruments, notices or demands served on the Company pursuant to Section 262
of the DGCL and Parent shall have the right to participate in all
negotiations and proceedings with respect to such demands. The Company shall
not, without the prior written consent of Parent, make any payment with
respect to, or settle or offer to settle, any such demands, waive any failure
to timely deliver a written demand for appraisal under the DGCL, approve any
withdrawal of any such demands or propose or agree to do or commit to do any
of the foregoing.

 

Section 2.05 _Withholding Rights_. Each of the Surviving Corporation,
Parent, the Paying Agent or any other applicable withholding agent shall be
entitled to deduct and withhold from the consideration otherwise payable
pursuant to this Agreement, including in respect of the Shares, Company
Options, Company SARs, RSU Awards or Warrant vested, cancelled or exercised
in the

 



8

    

 Merger, such amounts as it is required to deduct and withhold with respect
to the making of such payment, or the vesting, waiver of restrictions or other
actions provided for in this Agreement, under the Code or any other
applicable state, local or foreign Tax Law. To the extent that amounts are so
withheld by the Surviving Corporation, Parent, the Paying Agent or other
withholding agent, as the case may be, such withheld amounts (a) shall be
remitted by the Surviving Corporation, Parent, the Paying Agent or other
withholding agent, as applicable, to the applicable Governmental Entity, and
(b) shall be treated for all purposes of this Agreement as having been
paid to the person in respect of which such deduction and withholding was
made by the Surviving Corporation, Parent, the Paying Agent or other

reasonable assurance that (x) material information required to be disclosed

communicated to the Companys management, as appropriate, to allow timely
decisions regarding required disclosure and to make the certifications of the

other employees of the Company who have a significant role in the Companys
internal control over financial reporting or (iii) any written claim or

Contract in respect of a Competing Proposal that requires or causes the
Company to abandon, terminate or fail to consummate the Transactions
(except for an Acceptable Confidentiality Agreement or other agreement in
accordance with _Section_ __ _ 5.03(b)_), (iv) following the public
announcement by a third party of a bona fide Competing Proposal by such third
party, fail to reaffirm publicly the Company Recommendation by the earlier to
occur of at least five (5) Business Day prior to the date of the Company
Stockholders Meeting (as such date may have been adjourned or postponed) and

shorter period as may exist between the date of the Competing Proposal and the
date of the Company Stockholders Meeting), (v) make any recommendation or

referred to as an " _Change of Company Recommendation_ ").

 

(d) _Notice of Competing Proposals_. Reasonably promptly (but in no event
more than twenty-four (24) hours) following the Companys receipt of any
Inquiry, Competing Proposal or request for non-public information in
connection with a Competing Proposal (or that could reasonably be expected to
result in a Competing Proposal), from and after the execution of this
Agreement, the Company shall notify Parent in writing of the receipt of such
Inquiry, Competing Proposal or request, and the terms and conditions of such
Inquiry, Competing Proposal or request (including, in each case, the identity
of the person making any such Competing Proposal, Inquiry or request), and the
Company shall provide to Parent together with such notification: (i) a copy of
such Inquiry, Competing Proposal or request, if in writing (including copies

the material terms of such Inquiry, Competing Proposal or request, if oral (or
not otherwise made in writing), and in each case copies (in writing) or
summaries (if not in writing) of any responses thereto with respect to the
terms and conditions of such Inquiry or Competing Proposal; _provided_ ,
_however_ , that the foregoing notice obligation with respect to requests for
non-public information shall only require the Company to provide Parent notice
of the initial request from any person or its representatives with respect to
an Inquiry or Competing Proposal (subject to compliance with _Section_ __ _
5.03(a)_). In addition, the Company shall (A) keep Parent reasonably informed
in all material respects on a reasonably current basis, or upon Parents

thereafter), of the status and material terms of (including material
amendments or revisions or proposed material amendments or revisions to) such
Competing Proposal and (B) provide to Parent on a prompt basis (and in any
event within twenty-four (24) hours) after receipt or delivery thereof copies

Proposal,

 



43

    

 copies of all draft agreements to be entered into between the Company and
the person making such Competing Proposal, and drafts of all agreements
received by the Company to finance such Competing Proposal and copies of any
other written document (or summaries, if not in writing) which provide for the
terms and conditions of such Competing Proposal.

 

(e) _Change of Company Recommendation with respect to Superior Proposal_.
Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this Agreement, at any
time prior to the prior to (but not after) obtaining the Company Stockholder
Approval, the Companys board of directors (or a committee thereof) may, if
(A) a _bona fide_ Competing Proposal (that did not result from a breach of
_Section_ __ _ 5.03(a)_) (other than any breach that is immaterial and
unintentional) is made to the Company by a third person that is not withdrawn
and (B) the Companys board of directors (or a duly authorized committee
thereof) determines in good faith, after consultation with the Companys
financial advisor and outside legal counsel, that such Competing Proposal
constitutes a Superior Proposal, make a Change of Company Recommendation and
if it so chooses, cause the Company to terminate this Agreement pursuant to
_Section_ __ _ 7.01(f)_ (including with respect to the simultaneous payment
of the Company Termination Fee) to enter into an Alternative Acquisition
Agreement with respect to a Competing Proposal that constitutes a Superior
Proposal simultaneously with the termination of this Agreement, in each case
only if:

 

(i) the Companys board of directors (or a duly authorized committee
thereof) determines in good faith, after consultation with the Companys
outside legal counsel, that the failure to take such action would be
inconsistent with the directors exercise of their fiduciary duties under
applicable Law;

 

(ii) the Company has provided Parent prior written notice of the Companys
intention to make a Change of Company Recommendation (a " _Notice of Superior
Proposal Change of Recommendation_ "), which Notice of Superior Proposal
Change of Recommendation shall (A) advise Parent that the Company has received
a Competing Proposal and that the Companys board of directors has concluded
in good faith (after consultation with the Companys financial and outside
legal counsel) that such Competing Proposal constitutes a Superior Proposal,
and absent any revision to the terms and conditions of this Agreement, the
Company intends to make a Change of Company Recommendation or terminate this
Agreement pursuant to _Section_ __ _ 7.01(f),_ (B) specify the terms and
conditions of such Superior Proposal (including copies of all relevant
documents that provide for the terms and conditions of such Competing Proposal
and the proposed commitments or agreements to finance such Competing Proposal)
and (C) identify the person making such Superior Proposal (it being agreed
that neither the delivery of the Notice of Superior Proposal Change of
Recommendation by the Company to Parent nor the public announcement that the
Company has delivered such Notice of Superior Proposal Change of
Recommendation (but for the avoidance of doubt, not the entry into an
Alternative Acquisition Agreement) shall in and of itself constitute a Change
of Company Recommendation unless within two (2) Business Days after the end of
the period contemplated by clause (iii) the board of directors of the Company
(or a duly authorized committee thereof) fails to reaffirm the Company
Recommendation);

 

(iii) the Company and its Representatives have negotiated in good faith
with Parent, to the extent Parent requests to negotiate, with respect to any
changes to the terms of this Agreement proposed by Parent for at least five
(5) Business Days following receipt by Parent of such Notice of Superior
Proposal Change of Recommendation (it being understood and agreed

 



44

    

 that any amendment to any of the financial terms (including the form, amount
and timing of payment of consideration) or any other material term of such
Superior Proposal shall require a new Notice of Superior Proposal Change of
Recommendation and the Company and its Representatives shall be required to
comply with the requirements of this _Section_ __ _ 5.03(e)_ anew with
respect to such Notice of Superior Proposal Change of Recommendation except
that the five (5) Business Day period referred to above shall instead be an
additional three (3) Business Day period from the date of such notice); and

 

(iv) following the period(s) referred to in _Section_ __ _ 5.03(e)(iii)_
(including any subsequent period following the delivery of a subsequent
Notice of Superior Proposal Change of Recommendation), giving due
consideration to any changes to the terms of this Agreement proposed by Parent
to the Company, the Companys board of directors (or a duly authorized
committee thereof) has determined in good faith, after (A) consultation with
the Companys financial advisor and outside legal counsel, that such Competing
Proposal would nevertheless continue to constitute a Superior Proposal if
such changes offered in writing by Parent were to be given effect and (B)
consultation with the Companys outside legal counsel, that failure to take
such action would be inconsistent with the Companys board of directors
exercise of their fiduciary duties under applicable Law.

(f) _Change of Company Recommendation With Respect to Intervening Event_.
Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, at any time prior to the
prior to (but not after) obtaining the Company Stockholder Approval and other
than with respect to a Superior Proposal (which is addressed in _Section_ __
_ 5.03(e)_), the Companys board of directors (or a duly authorized committee
thereof) may make a Change of Company Recommendation in response to an event,
occurrence, change, effect, condition, development or state of facts or
circumstances (other than related to a Competing Proposal or Superior
Proposal) which materially improves the business, assets, operations or
prospects of the Company and its Subsidiaries, arising after the date of this
Agreement, that was neither known to, nor reasonably foreseeable by, the
Companys board of directors prior to the date of this Agreement but becomes
known to the Companys board of directors after the date of this Agreement
(an " _Intervening Event_ "), only if the Companys board of directors (or a
duly authorized committee thereof) has (i) determined in good faith (after
consultation with the Companys outside legal counsel) that the failure to
take such action would be inconsistent with the Companys board of directors
fiduciary duties under applicable Law and (ii) at or following the end of at
least five (5) Business Days with respect to the relevant notice
of Intervening Event as set out in the remainder of this paragraph, and after
taking into account (after consultation with the Companys outside legal
counsel and financial advisor) any changes to the terms and conditions of this
Agreement timely proposed by Parent in response to a notice of Intervening
Event, the Companys board of directors (or a duly authorized committee
thereof) shall have determined in good faith (after consultation with the
Companys outside legal counsel) that the failure to make an Change of
Company Recommendation in response to such Intervening Event would continue to
be inconsistent with the Companys board of directors fiduciary duties under
applicable Law; _provided_ ,  _however_ , that no Change of Company
Recommendation may be made until the conclusion of the five (5) Business Days
following Parents receipt of a written notice from the Company (" _Notice of
Change of Recommendation_ ") advising Parent that absent any revision to the
terms and conditions of this Agreement, the Companys board of directors (or a
duly constituted committee thereof) intends to make Change of Company
Recommendation due to an Intervening Event and specifying in reasonable
detail the Intervening Event and the reasons

 



45

    

 for such Change of Company Recommendation. During such five (5) Business Day
period, the Company shall, and shall cause its Representatives to negotiate
with Parent and its Representatives in good faith (to the extent Parent
requests to negotiate) to make such adjustments in the terms and conditions of
this Agreement so that the Companys board of directors (or a duly authorized
committee thereof) no longer determines (after consultation with its outside
legal counsel) that the failure to make a Change of Company Recommendation in
response to such Intervening Event would be inconsistent with the Companys
board of directors exercise of their fiduciary duties under applicable Law.
In determining whether the failure to make a Change of Company Recommendation
in response to an Intervening Event pursuant to this _Section_ __ _ 5.03(f)_
would be inconsistent with the Companys board of directors exercise of
their fiduciary duties under applicable Law, the Companys board of directors
(or a duly authorized committee thereof) shall take into account any changes
to the terms and conditions of this Agreement timely proposed by Parent in
response to such Notice of Change of Recommendation with respect to such
Intervening Event.

 

(g) Nothing contained in this _Section_ __ _ 5.03_ shall prohibit the
Companys board of directors from complying with its disclosure obligations
under U.S. federal or state Law with regard to a Competing Proposal, including
by (i) disclosing to the stockholders of the Company a position contemplated
by Rule 14e-2(a), Rule 14d-9 or Item 1012(a) of Regulation M-A promulgated
under the Exchange Act or (ii) making any " _stop, look and listen_ "
communication to the stockholders of the Company pursuant to Rule 14d-9(f)
under the Exchange Act if the Companys board of directors determines in good
faith, after consultation with outside legal counsel, that the failure to do
so would be inconsistent with its fiduciary duties under applicable Law to the
stockholders of the Company; _provided_ , that the Companys board of
directors expressly publicly reaffirms the Company Recommendation in any such
stop, look and listen disclosure. This _Section_ __ _ 5.03(g)_ shall not be
deemed to permit the Companys board of directors to take any of the actions
in  _Section_ __ _ 5.03(c)_ and, for the avoidance of doubt, if any
disclosure or other action taken pursuant to this _Section_ __ _ 5.03(g)_
includes a Change of Company Recommendation, such disclosure or other action
shall be deemed to be a Change of Company Recommendation for all purposes
under this Agreement.

(h) The Company agrees that any breach of this _Section_ __ _ 5.03_ by
any of the Company Subsidiaries or the Company Representatives shall be deemed
to be a breach of this Agreement by the Company.

 

Section 5.04 _Access to Information_. From the date of this Agreement to
the Effective Time, and subject to _Section_ __ _ 5.15(e)_, the Company
shall, and shall cause each Company Subsidiary to: (a) provide to Parent and
Sub and their respective Representatives reasonable access during normal
business hours in such a manner as not to unreasonably interfere with the
operation of any business conducted by the Company or any Company Subsidiary,
upon prior written notice to the Company, to the officers, employees,
properties, offices and other facilities of the Company and the Company
Subsidiaries and to the books and records; and (b) furnish promptly such
information concerning the business, properties, Contracts, assets and
liabilities of the Company and Company Subsidiaries as Parent or
its Representatives may reasonably request; _provided_ , _however_ , that the
Company shall not be required to (or to cause any Company Subsidiary to)
afford such access or furnish such information to the extent that the Company
believes in good faith that doing so would: (i) result in the loss of
attorney-client privilege ( _provided_ that the

 



46

    

 Company shall use its reasonable best efforts to allow for such access or
disclosure in a manner that does not result in a loss of attorney-client
privilege); (ii) violate any confidentiality obligations of the Company or
any Company Subsidiary to any third person or otherwise breach, contravene or
violate any then effective Contract to which the Company or any Company
Subsidiary is party (provided that the Company shall use its reasonable
efforts to obtain the required consent of such third party to such access or
disclosure and implement appropriate procedures to enable the disclosure of
such information) or otherwise result in the Company taking any
action inconsistent with _Section_ __ _ 5.03_; (iii) result in a competitor
of the Company or any Company Subsidiary receiving information that is
competitively sensitive; (iv) breach, contravene or violate any applicable
Law (including the HSR Act or any other Antitrust Law); or (v) jeopardize the
health and safety of any employee of the Company or the Company Subsidiaries,
in light of COVID-19 or any COVID-19 Measures ( _provided_ , that the Company
shall use its reasonable best efforts to allow for such access or disclosure
in a manner that does not jeopardize such health and safety). During any visit
to the business or property sites of the Company or any of the Company
Subsidiaries, each of Parent and Sub shall, and shall cause their respective
representatives accessing such properties to, comply with all applicable Laws
and all of the Companys and the Company Subsidiaries safety and security
procedures. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this
_Section_ __ _ 5.04_, from the date of this Agreement to the Effective Time,
none of Parent, Sub or any of their respective affiliates shall conduct,
without the prior written consent of the Company, any environmental
investigation at any real property owned or leased by the Company, and in no
event may any environmental investigation include any sampling or other
intrusive investigation of air, surface water, groundwater, soil or anything
else at or in connection with any of such real property. Parent shall, and
shall cause each of its Subsidiaries, its and their respective
representatives and any Lender Related Parties to, hold all information
provided or furnished pursuant to this _Section_ __ _ 5.04_ confidential in
accordance with the terms of the Confidentiality Agreement.

 

Section 5.05 _Appropriate Action; Consents; Filings_.

 

(a) Subject to _Section_ __ _ 5.03_, each of HH Finance, Parent, Sub and
the Company shall use its reasonable best efforts to consummate the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement and to cause the conditions set
forth in _Article_ __ _ VI_ to be satisfied. Without limiting the generality
of the foregoing, Parent, Sub and the Company shall (and Parent, HH Finance
and Sub shall cause their Subsidiaries to) use their respective reasonable
best efforts to (i) promptly obtain all actions or nonactions, consents,
Permits (including Environmental Permits), waivers, approvals, authorizations
and orders from Governmental Entities or other persons necessary or advisable
in connection with the consummation of the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement, (ii) as promptly as practicable, and in any event within ten (10)

or their " _ultimate parent entities_ " under the HSR Act, (iii) as promptly
as practicable, and in any event within 20 Business Days after the date of

where applicable) with any foreign Governmental Entities under any other
Antitrust Law, and promptly make any further filings pursuant thereto that
may 

 



47

    

 be necessary or advisable, (iv) defend all lawsuits or other legal,
regulatory, administrative or other Proceedings to which it or any of its
affiliates is a party challenging or affecting this Agreement or the
consummation of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, in each case
until the issuance of a final, non-appealable order with respect to each such
lawsuit or other Proceeding, (v) seek to have lifted or rescinded any
injunction or restraining order which may adversely affect the ability of the
parties to consummate the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, in each
case until the issuance of a final, non-appealable order with respect thereto,
(vi) seek to resolve any objection or assertion by any Governmental Entity
challenging this Agreement or the transactions, and (vii) execute and deliver
any additional instruments necessary or advisable to consummate the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement; _provided_ , that in the event
that the FTC, Antitrust Division or any foreign Governmental Entities under
any other Antitrust Law is closed or not accepting filings as required under
subclauses (ii) and (iii) hereto, (a " _Governmental Closure_ "), then the
periods provided under subclauses (ii) and (iii), as applicable, shall be
extended day-for-day, for each Business Day the Governmental Closure is in
effect.

 

(b) In furtherance of the obligations set forth in _Section_ __ _
5.05(a)_, (i) Parent and Sub shall promptly take (and shall cause each of its
Subsidiaries to take) any and all actions necessary or advisable in order to
avoid or eliminate each and every impediment to the consummation of the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement and obtain all approvals and
consents under any Antitrust Laws that may be required by any foreign or U.S.
federal, state or local Governmental Entity, in each case with competent
jurisdiction, so as to enable the parties to consummate the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement as promptly as practicable, including accepting
operational restrictions or limitations on, and committing to or effecting, by
consent decree, hold separate orders, trust or otherwise, the sale,
license, disposition or holding separate of, such assets or businesses of
Parent, Sub, the Company, the Surviving Corporation or any of their respective
controlled affiliates (and the entry into agreements with, and submission to
decrees, judgments, injunctions or orders of the relevant Governmental
Entity) as may be required or advisable to obtain such approvals or consents
of such Governmental Entities or to avoid the entry of, or to effect the
dissolution of or vacate or lift, any decrees, judgments, injunctions or
orders that would otherwise have the effect of preventing or materially
delaying the consummation of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement
and (ii) the Company may make, subject to the condition that the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement actually occur, any undertakings (including
undertakings to accept operational restrictions or limitations or to make
sales or other dispositions, _provided_ that such restrictions, limitations,
sales or other dispositions are conditioned upon the consummation of the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement) as are required to obtain such
approvals or consents of such Governmental Entities or to avoid the entry of,
or to effect the dissolution of or vacate or lift, any decrees, judgments,
injunctions or orders that would otherwise have the effect of preventing or
materially delaying the consummation of the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement (the matters described in this sentence, individually or
collectively, " _Remedy Actions_ "). Notwithstanding anything to the contrary
set forth in this _Agreement_ , in no event shall anything in this Agreement
(including this  _Section_ __ _ 5.05)_ require, or be construed to require,
Parent or its affiliates or Subsidiaries to take, or propose or agree to take,
any Remedy Actions that, individually or in the aggregate with all other
Remedy Actions, would, or would be reasonably expected to, have a material
adverse effect on the business, results of operations, assets or financial
condition of the Parent and its Subsidiaries (including the Company and its
Subsidiaries) after taking effect of the Merger (but for this purpose
measuring the business, results of operations, assets and financial condition
of Parent and its Subsidiaries (including the

 



48

    

 Company and its Subsidiaries) as though they were the same size and amounts
as those of just the Company and the Company Subsidiaries, taken as a whole).
The Company shall not take, or agree to take, any Remedy Actions, without the
prior written consent of Parent. Neither Parent nor Sub, directly or
indirectly, through one or more of their respective controlled affiliates,
shall take any action, including acquiring or making any investment in any
person or any division or assets thereof, that would reasonably be expected to
prevent the satisfaction of the conditions contained in _Article_ __ _ VI_ or
the consummation of the Transactions.

 

(c) Without limiting the generality of anything contained in this _Section_
__ _ 5.05_, each party hereto shall: (i) give the other parties prompt
notice of the making or commencement of any request, inquiry, investigation or
legal Proceeding by or before any Governmental Entity with respect to the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement; (ii) keep the other parties
informed as to the status of any such request, inquiry, investigation or legal
Proceeding; and (iii) promptly inform the other parties of any substantive
communication to or from the FTC, the Antitrust Division or any other
Governmental Entity regarding the transactions contemplated by this Agreement.
Each party hereto will consult and cooperate with the other parties and will
consider in good faith the views of the other parties in connection with any
filing, analysis, appearance, presentation, memorandum, brief, argument,
opinion or proposal made or submitted to any Governmental Entity in connection
with the transactions contemplated by this Agreement; _provided_ ,  _however_
, that the parties shall not be required to provide the other with copies of
their Notification and Report Form under the HSR Act. In addition, except as
may be prohibited by any Governmental Entity or by any Law, in connection
with any such request, inquiry, investigation or legal Proceeding, each party
hereto will permit authorized representatives of the other parties to be
present at each substantive meeting or conference relating to such request,
inquiry, investigation or legal Proceeding and to have access to and be
consulted in connection with any substantive document, opinion or proposal
made or submitted to any Governmental Entity in connection with such request,
inquiry, investigation or legal Proceeding. Notwithstanding anything to the
contrary in this _Section_ __ _ 5.05_, (x) no party hereto shall be in
violation of this Agreement by virtue of providing information that is
competitively sensitive to one another on an "outside counsel only" or other
basis designed to ensure compliance with applicable Law (including the HSR Act
or any other Antitrust Law) and (y) materials provided to the other party
pursuant to this  _Section_ __ _ 5.05_ may be redacted (A) to remove
references concerning the valuation of Parent, the Company or any of their
Subsidiaries, (B) as necessary to comply with contractual arrangements, and
(C) as necessary to address privilege or confidentiality concerns.

(d) The parties hereby acknowledge that all obligations of Parent, Sub and
the Company relating to obtaining regulatory approvals (including, but not
limited to, the expiration or termination of any applicable HSR Act waiting
period or similar waiting period pursuant to any other Antitrust Law) shall
be governed exclusively by this _Section_ __ _ 5.05_. For the avoidance of
doubt, the immediately preceding sentence does not limit the remedies
otherwise expressly available to a party pursuant to the terms of
Agreement with respect to another partys breach of this _Section_ __ _
5.05_ (including remedies described in _Article_ __ _ VII_ or _Article_ __ _
VIII_), subject to in each case to the terms and conditions of this Agreement
with respect to any such remedies, including the other subsections of this
_Section_ __ _ 5.05_ and the limitations set forth in _Article_ __ _ VII_
and  _Article_ __ _ III_.

Section 5.06 _Public Announcements_. The initial press release issued by
Parent and the Company concerning this Agreement and the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement shall

 



49

    

 be a joint press release in a form reasonably agreed to by the parties
hereto, and thereafter, except with respect to any public statement by the
Company with respect to any Change of Company Recommendation or a Competing
Proposal (in accordance with, and subject to the terms of, this Agreement),
Parent and the Company shall consult with each other before issuing or
otherwise making, and give each other the opportunity to review and comment
upon, any press release or other public statements with respect to the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement and shall not issue any such press
release or make any such public statement prior to such consultation, except
as may be required by applicable Law or by obligations pursuant to any
listing agreement with any national securities exchange. Notwithstanding the
foregoing, Parent and its affiliates may, without consultation or consent,
make ordinary course disclosures and communications to existing or
prospective general and limited partners, equity holders, members, managers
and investors of such person or any affiliates of such person, in each case
who are subject to customary confidentiality restrictions, and on such
persons website in the ordinary course of business.

 

Section 5.07 _Directors_ __ _ and Officers Indemnification and Insurance_.

(a) _Indemnification_. From and after the Effective Time, Parent shall,
and shall cause the Surviving Corporation to, to the fullest extent permitted
by applicable Law, indemnify, defend and hold harmless each current or former
director, officer or employee of the Company or any of the Company
Subsidiaries, each fiduciary under benefit plans of the Company or any of the
Company Subsidiaries and each such person who performed services at the
request of the Company or any of the Company Subsidiaries (each an "
_Indemnified Party_ " and collectively, the " _Indemnified Parties_ "),
against (i) all losses, expenses (including reasonable attorneys fees and
expenses), judgments, fines, claims, damages or liabilities or, subject to the
proviso of the next succeeding sentence, amounts paid in settlement, arising
out of actions or omissions occurring at or prior to the Effective Time (and
whether asserted or claimed prior to, at or after the Effective Time) to the
extent that they are based on or arise out of the fact that such person is or
was a director, officer, employee or fiduciary under benefit plans or
performed services at the request of the Company or any of the Company
Subsidiaries (the " _Indemnified Liabilities_ "), and (ii) all Indemnified
Liabilities to the extent they are based on or arise out of or pertain to the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement, whether asserted or claimed prior
to, at or after the Effective Time, and including any reasonable and
documented expenses incurred in enforcing such persons rights under this
_Section_ __ _ 5.07_. In the event of any such loss, expense, claim, damage
or liability (whether or not asserted before the Effective Time), the
Surviving Corporation shall pay the reasonable fees and expenses of counsel
selected by the Indemnified Parties promptly after statements therefor are
received and otherwise advance to such Indemnified Party upon request,
reimbursement of documented expenses reasonably incurred in each case to the
extent provided in the organizational documents and any indemnification or
other similar agreements of the Company as in effect on the date of this
Agreement ( _provided_ that the person to whom expenses are advanced provides
an undertaking to repay such advance if it is determined by a final and non-
appealable judgment of a court of competent jurisdiction that such person is
not legally entitled to indemnification under Law).

(b) _Insurance_. The Company shall be permitted to, prior to the Effective
Time, and if the Company fails to do so, Parent shall cause the Surviving
Corporation to obtain and fully pay the premium for an insurance and
indemnification policy that provides coverage for a period of six (6) years
from and after the Effective Time for events occurring prior to the Effective
Time

 



50

    

 (the " _D andO Insurance_") that is substantially equivalent to and in any
event not less favorable in the aggregate to the intended beneficiaries
thereof than the Companys existing directors and officers liability
insurance policy; _provided_ , that in no event shall the premium of the DandO
Insurance exceed 300% of the then current aggregate annual premium of the
Companys existing policy in place at the time of Closing. If the Company and
the Surviving Corporation for any reason fail to obtain such "tail" insurance
policy as of the Effective Time, the Surviving Corporation shall, and Parent
shall cause the Surviving Corporation to, continue to maintain in effect for
a period of at least six (6) years from and after the Effective Time (and for
so long thereafter as any claims brought before the end of such six-
year period thereunder are being adjudicated) the DandO Insurance in place as
of the date of this Agreement with terms, conditions, retentions and limits of
liability that are at least as favorable as provided in the Companys existing
policies as of the date of this Agreement, or the Surviving Corporation
shall, and Parent shall cause the Surviving Corporation to, purchase
comparable DandO Insurance for such six-year period (and for so long thereafter
as any claims brought before the end of such six-year period thereunder are
being adjudicated) with terms, conditions, retentions and limits of liability
that are at least as favorable as provided in the Companys existing policies
as of the date of this Agreement.

(c) _Successors_. In the event the Surviving Corporation, Parent or any
of their respective successors or assigns (i) consolidates with or merges into
any other person and shall not be the continuing or surviving corporation or
entity of such consolidation or merger or (ii) transfers all or substantially
all of its properties and assets to any person, then and in either such case,
proper provisions shall be made so that the successors, assigns or transferees
of the Surviving Corporation or Parent shall assume the obligations set forth
in this _Section_ __ _ 5.07_.

(d) _Continuation_. For not less than six (6) years from and after the
Effective Time, the certificate of incorporation and bylaws (or other similar
documents) of the Surviving Corporation shall contain provisions no less
favorable with respect to exculpation, indemnification and advancement of
expenses for periods at or prior to the Effective Time than are currently set
forth in the Company Charter and the Company Bylaws. The contractual
indemnification rights, if any, in existence on the date of this Agreement
with any of the directors, officers or employees of the Company that have
been made available to Parent prior to the date hereof shall be assumed by the

Section 5.09 _Employee Benefit Matters_.

 

(a) From and after the Effective Time and for the nine (9) month period
following the Effective Time (or, if earlier, until the termination of
employment of the relevant employee) (the " _Benefit Protection Period_ "),
Parent shall provide or cause its Subsidiaries, including the Surviving
Corporation, to provide to each individual who was an employee of the Company
or a Company Subsidiary immediately prior to the Closing and who continues to
be employed by the Company or any of its affiliates (including Parent and any
of its Subsidiaries) following the Effective Time (each, a " _Company
Employee_ ") (i) base salary or base wages and target annual cash bonus
opportunities that are no less favorable, in the aggregate, than those
provided to such Company Employee immediately prior to the Effective
Time (excluding, for the avoidance of doubt, any one-time retention or change
in control bonus arrangements), (ii) severance benefits that are no less
favorable than the severance benefits provided under any severance plan,
policy or agreement set forth on _Section_ __ _ 5.09(a)_ of the Company
Disclosure Letter and (iii) other compensation and benefits (including paid-
time off, but excluding defined benefit pension, nonqualified deferred
compensation, equity or equity-based and post-termination or retiree health or
retiree welfare benefits) to the Company Employees in each jurisdiction as a
group that are substantially comparable, in the aggregate, to the other
compensation and benefits (excluding defined benefit pension, nonqualified
deferred compensation, equity or equity-based and post-termination or retiree
health or retiree welfare benefits) provided to such group of Company
Employees immediately prior to the Effective Time. Notwithstanding anything
in this Agreement to the contrary, the terms and conditions of employment for

Law until such agreement expires pursuant to its terms or is modified by the
parties thereto.

 

(b) Without limiting the generality of _Section_ __ _ 5.09(a)_, from and
after the Effective Time, Parent shall, or shall cause its Subsidiaries,
including the Surviving Corporation, to, assume, honor and continue all of the
Companys and the Company Subsidiaries employment, severance, retention, cash
incentive compensation and termination plans, policies, programs, agreements
and arrangements (including any change in control or severance agreement
between the Company or any Company Subsidiary and any Company Employee), in
each case, in accordance with their terms as in effect immediately prior to
the Effective Time, including with respect to any payments, benefits or rights
arising as a result of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement (either
alone or in combination with any other event).

 



52

    

(c) Parent shall, or shall cause its Subsidiaries, including the Surviving
Corporation, to, provide (i) each Company Employee who participates in the
Companys annual cash incentive program for the 2019 calendar year a payment
(if unpaid prior to the Effective Time) no less than that due with respect
to such Company Employees annual bonus under such program in an aggregate
amount not greater than the amount set forth on _Section_ __ _ 5.09(c)(i)_ of
the Company Disclosure Letter and (ii) each Company Employee who participates
in the Companys annual cash incentive program set forth on _Section_ __ _
5.09(c)(ii) _a payment on the terms set forth in _Section_ __ _ 5.09(c)(ii)_
of the Company Disclosure Letter.

 

(d) For purposes of determining eligibility to participate and vesting, and
solely for purposes of determining the level of paid time off and severance
benefits (but excluding benefit accruals under any defined benefit pension
plan or any retiree or post-retirement welfare benefits or for any purposes
under any equity or equity-based plan or arrangement) under any " _employee
benefit plan_ " (as such term is defined in Section 3(3) of ERISA, but without
regard to whether the applicable plan is subject to ERISA) and any other
employee benefit plan, program, policy or arrangement maintained by Parent or
any of its Subsidiaries, including the Surviving Corporation, including any
vacation, paid time off and severance plans, for the benefit of the Company
Employees, each Company Employees service with or otherwise credited by the
Company or any Company Subsidiary shall be treated as service with Parent or
any of its Subsidiaries, including the Surviving Corporation, to the same
extent and for the same purposes as recognized under the analogous Company
Benefit Plan, _provided_ , _however_ , that such service need not be
recognized to the extent that such recognition would result in any duplication
of benefits or compensation for the same period of service.

 

(e) In the plan year in which the Closing occurs, Parent shall, or shall
cause its Subsidiaries, including the Surviving Corporation, to use
commercially reasonable efforts to (i) waive, or cause to be waived, any pre-
existing condition limitations, exclusions, actively-at-work requirements and
waiting periods under any group health benefit plan ( _i.e._ , health, vision
and dental) maintained by Parent or any of its Subsidiaries, including the
Surviving Corporation, in which Company Employees (and their eligible
dependents) will be eligible to participate from and after the Effective Time,
except to the extent that such pre-existing condition
limitations, exclusions, actively-at-work requirements and waiting periods
would not have been satisfied or waived under the comparable Company Benefit
Plan immediately prior to the Effective Time and (ii) recognize, or cause to
be recognized, the dollar amount of all co-payments, deductibles and similar
expenses incurred by each Company Employee (and his or her eligible,
covered dependents) during the calendar year in which the Effective Time
occurs for purposes of satisfying such years deductible and co-payment
limitations under the relevant group health benefit plans ( _i.e._ , health,
vision and dental) in which such Company Employee (and dependents) will be
eligible to participate from and after the Effective Time to the extent
recognized under the analogous Company Benefit Plan in effect immediately
prior to the Effective Time.

(f) At the written request of Parent provided no later than 10 Business
Days prior to the Closing Date, the Company shall, or shall cause the
relevant Company Subsidiary to, at least one (1) day prior to the Closing
Date, cease contributions to, and adopt written resolutions (or take other
necessary and appropriate action) to terminate, each Company Benefit Plan or
any other benefit plan that includes a qualified cash or deferred arrangement
within the meaning of Section 401(k) of the Code (the " _Company 401(k) Plan_
") and to one hundred percent (100%) vest

 



53

    

 all participants under the Company 401(k) Plan, such termination and vesting
to be effective no later than the day preceding the Closing Date; _provided_ ,
_however_ , that the foregoing may be made contingent upon the Closing. In
the event Parent requests that the Company 401(k) Plan be terminated, Parent
or the Company, as applicable, shall take any and all actions as may be
required, including amendments to the Company 401(k) Plan or Parents
applicable 401(k) plan (the " _Parent 401(k) Plan_ "), to (i) make, prior to
the termination of the Company 401(k) Plan, discretionary company matching
contributions (A) for the 2019 plan year equal to the amount accrued by the
Company in the Company Financial Statements (as of the date hereof in the
ordinary course of business) and (B) for the 2020 plan year, equal to 50% of
the first 5% of eligible compensation deferred by each Company Employee
(subject to a cap of $6,000), (ii) provide that Company Employees shall be
eligible to participate in the Parent 401(k) Plan, effective as soon as
reasonably practicable following the Effective Time, and (iii) permit the
Company Employees who are then actively employed to make rollover
contributions of "eligible rollover distributions" (within the meaning of
Section 402(c)(4) of the Code) in the form of cash, but including notes (in
the case of loans) from the Company 401(k) Plan to the Parent 401(k) Plan.

(g) Notwithstanding the foregoing, nothing contained in this Agreement
shall (i) be treated as an establishment, termination or amendment of any
Company Benefit Plan or any other benefit or compensation plan, policy,
program, Contract, agreement or arrangement, (ii) give any employee or
former employee or any other individual associated therewith or any employee
benefit plan or trustee thereof or any other third person any right to enforce
the provisions of this _Section_ __ _ 5.09_, or any person (other than the
parties to this Agreement) any rights or remedies, including any third party
beneficiary rights, by reason of this _Section_ __ _ 5.09_, (iii) limit the
ability of Parent or any of its Subsidiaries (including, following the
Closing, the Surviving Corporation) from (a) establishing, amending or
terminating any Company Benefit Plan or any other compensation or benefit
plan, program, policy, Contract, agreement or arrangement, or (b) terminating
the employment or service of any person at any time for any or no reason,
(iv) create any right in any person to any continued employment or service
with Parent or any of its affiliates or any particular term or condition of
employment or service, or (v) obligate Parent, the Surviving Corporation or

plan, policy, program, Contract, agreement or arrangement, or (B) retain the

that identifies by employee name or ID number and location all employees
involuntarily terminated (other than for cause), laid off for a period that
exceeds six months, or whose hours were reduced by more than 50% for each
month of a six-month period, within the ninety (90) days preceding the Closing
Date.

 

Section 5.10 _Expenses_. Except as otherwise provided in this Agreement,
all costs and expenses incurred in connection with this Agreement and the

54

    

Section 5.11 _Rule_ __ _ 16b-3 Matters_. Notwithstanding anything to the
contrary contained in this Agreement, the Company shall take all actions as

exempt under Rule 16b-3 promulgated under the Exchange Act to the fullest
extent permitted by Law.

Company shall give Parent the opportunity to participate in the defense or

1.02_, on the terms and conditions (including, to the extent applicable, the "
_flex_ " provisions) described in the Financing Commitments (for purposes of
this  _Section_ __ _ 5.15_, the Financing Commitments and the Debt
Commitment Letter shall include any Fee Letter), including using reasonable
best efforts to (i) either (A) amend and restate HH Existing Credit Agreement
referenced in the Debt Commitment Letter to incorporate the terms and

manner that would not have a Funds Certainty Effect) and any further
amendments or modifications that would not have a Funds Certainty Effect or

Commitment Letter (collectively, the documentation in clauses (A) and (B),
the " _Definitive Debt Financing Agreements_ "), __ (ii) satisfy (or, at the

55

HH Finance, Sub nor any of their Subsidiaries party thereto shall agree to any
amendments or modifications to, or grant any waivers of, any condition or
other provision under the Financing Commitments or the definitive agreements
relating to the Financing (including for the avoidance of doubt, the Credit
Agreement Financing Documents) without the prior written consent of the
Company to the extent that such amendments, modification or waivers would have
or would reasonably be expected to have a Funds Certainty Effect; _provided_
, the foregoing shall not restrict any amendment of the Debt Commitment
Letter, the Credit Agreement Financing Documents or the Definitive Debt
Financing Agreements to (A) add lenders, lead arrangers, bookrunners,
syndication agents or any person with similar roles or titles who had not
executed the Debt Commitment Letter as of the date hereof if the addition of
such additional parties, individually or in the aggregate, would not have a
Funds Certainty Effect, (B) any amendment, modification, or amendment and
restatement of HH Existing Credit Agreement to incorporate the terms and
conditions of the Debt Commitment Letter and the Credit Agreement Financing
Documents (as such terms and conditions may be modified or adjusted in a
manner that would not have a Funds Certainty Effect) and any other terms and
conditions (and any termination of the Debt Commitment Letter if such
commitment has been replaced thereby) so long as any such amendment,
modification or amendment and restatement, individually or in the aggregate,
would not have, or would not reasonably be expected to have, a Funds Certainty
Effect or (C) in accordance with  _Section_ __ _ 5.15(c)_ below. Parent, HH
Finance and Sub shall use their reasonable best efforts to maintain in effect
the Financing Commitments, the Credit Agreement Financing Documents and, once
executed, the Definitive Debt Financing Agreements until the Transactions are
consummated (provided that the foregoing shall not limit the Parents, HH
Finances or Subs right to amend, restate, modify or waive the terms of the
Debt Commitment Letter, the Credit Agreement Financing Documents and the
Definitive Debt Financing Agreements in accordance with the immediately
preceding sentence and/or _Section_ __ _ 5.15(c)_). Prior to the Effective
Time, none of Parent, HH Finance nor Sub shall release or consent to the
termination of the obligations of the Lenders under the Debt Commitment Letter
or the Definitive Debt Financing Agreements in each case to the extent that
results or would be reasonably expected to result in the aggregate Financing
available at Closing being insufficient to fund the Financing Uses and, in
each case, subject to _clause (c)_ below, without the prior written consent
of the Company.

 

(b) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this Agreement,
in no event shall Parent or any of its affiliates (which for purposes of this
Agreement shall be deemed to include each direct or indirect investor or
potential investor in Parent or any of Parents or any such investors
financing sources or potential financing sources or other representatives
acting at the direction of or on behalf of Parent or such investor) engage any
bank, investment bank or other potential provider of debt or equity financing
on an exclusive basis or otherwise on terms that 

 



56

    

 prohibit or are designed to prevent such provider from providing or seeking
to provide such services or financing to any person in connection with a
transaction relating to the Company or the Company Subsidiaries in connection
with the Transactions (including in connection with the making of any
Competing Proposal).

 

(c) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this Agreement,
Parent, HH Finance and Sub shall be permitted to terminate the then in effect
Debt Commitment Letter and/or Credit Agreement Financing Documents so long as
Parent, HH Finance and/or Sub have arranged and obtained prior to or
simultaneously with such termination substitute financing commitments in
respect of other financing from the same and/or alternative bona fide third
party financing sources (which alternative providers shall be reasonably
acceptable to the Company as to financial ability to provide the commitments),
which substitute financing shall be in an amount sufficient to fund, when
taken together with the Equity Financing to discharge and pay the full amount
needed for the Financing Uses and so long as such substitution (and any
substituted financing) would not have, or would be reasonably expected to
have, a Funds Certainty Effect (the " _Alternative Financing_ "). If any
portion of the Debt Financing expires or is terminated or any portion becomes
unavailable on the terms and conditions (including any " _flex_ " provisions)
contemplated in the Debt Commitment Letter or the Credit Agreement Financing
Documents with the result that the aggregate Financing available at Closing is
or is reasonably expected to be insufficient to fund the Financing Uses,
Parent, HH Finance and Sub shall use their reasonable best efforts to, as
promptly as practical following the occurrence of such event but in any event
no later than the fifth (5th) Business Day preceding the Outside Date,
take, or cause to be taken, all actions and to do, or cause to be done, all
things necessary or advisable to arrange and obtain from the same sources or
alternative sources of financing debt financing substitute commitments for
financing in an amount sufficient, together with any remaining Financing
available to the Parent and/or Sub, to satisfy the Financing Uses, which
financing shall be funded at or prior to the Effective Time and so long as
such alternative financing would constitute an Alternative Financing. Any new
debt commitment letter and related fee letter or other principal documents
evidencing such committed debt financing arrangements entered into in
connection with any Alternative Financing are referred to, respectively, as a
" _New Debt Commitment Letter_ ," a " _New Fee Letter_ ", " _New Credit
Agreement Financing Documents_ " or " _New Definitive Debt Financing
Agreements_ ", as applicable. In the event Parent, HH Finance or Sub enter
into any such New Debt Commitment Letter, New Credit Agreement Financing
Documents or New Definitive Debt Financing Agreements (or any amendment or
modification of the Financing Commitments, the Credit Agreement
Financing Documents and/or the Definitive Debt Financing Agreements in
accordance with the terms of _Section_ __ _ 5.15(a)_), (i) Parent and Sub
shall promptly provide the Company with true, correct and complete copies
thereof (which may have customary economic terms redacted so long as such
redacted terms would not have or would not reasonably be expected to have a
Funds Certainty Effect), (ii) any reference in this Agreement to the " _Debt
Financing_ " shall mean the debt financing contemplated by the Debt
Commitment Letter as modified pursuant to _clause_ __ _ (iii)_ below, and
(iii) any reference in this Agreement to the " _Debt Commitment Letter_ " (and
any definition incorporating the term " _Debt Commitment Letter_ ," including
the definition of Credit Agreement Financing Documents or Definitive Debt
Financing Agreements) shall be deemed to include the Debt Commitment Letter
and any Fee Letter and any Credit Agreement Financing Documents or Definitive
Debt Financing Agreements to the extent not superseded by a New Debt
Commitment Letter, New Fee Letter or New Definitive Debt Financing Agreements,
as the case may be, at the time in question and any New Debt Commitment
Letter, New Fee Letter, New Credit Agreement Financing Documents or New
Definitive Debt Financing Agreements to the extent then in effect.

 



57

    

(d) Parent and Sub shall, and shall cause their representatives to, keep
the Company informed as promptly as practicable in reasonable detail of any
material developments in their efforts to arrange the Financing and, at the
Companys reasonable request shall, substantially concurrently provide copies
of all substantially final drafts of the Definitive Debt Financing Documents
(which may have customary economic terms redacted so long as such redacted
terms would not have or would not reasonably be expected to have a Funds
Certainty Effect). Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, Parent
and/or Sub shall (i) furnish prior notice to the Company of its intent to
substitute the Debt Financing and/or the Credit Agreement Financing Documents
with Alternative Financing, (ii) furnish the Company complete, correct and
executed copies of any amendments to the Financing Commitments and/or the
Credit Agreement Financing Documents promptly upon their execution (with any
commercially sensitive items redacted so long as such redacted terms would
not have or would not reasonably be expected to have a Funds Certainty Effect)
and (iii) give the Company prompt written notice (A) of any default or breach
(or any event that, with or without notice, lapse of time or both, would (or
could reasonably be expected to) give rise to any default or breach) by any
party under any of the Financing Commitments or the definitive agreements
relating to the Financing (including, without limitation, a Major Event
of Default under and as defined in the Debt Commitment Letter and/or the
Definitive Debt Financing Agreements, as applicable) of which Parent or Sub
becomes aware if such breach or default would reasonably be expected to have a
Funds Certainty Effect, (B) of any termination of either of the Financing
Commitments, the Credit Agreement Financing Documents and/or the Definitive
Debt Financing Agreements, (C) of the receipt of any written notice or other
communication from any person with respect to any (1) actual or potential
default, breach, termination or repudiation of any Financing Commitment
(including any Major Event of Default under and as defined in the Debt
Commitment Letter and/or the Definitive Debt Financing Agreements, as
applicable), any definitive agreement relating to the Financing or any
provision of the Financing Commitments or the definitive agreements relating
to the Financing, in each case by any party thereto, or (2) material dispute
or disagreement between or among any parties to any Financing Commitment or
the definitive agreements relating to the Financing, in each case, only to the
extent that such default, breach, termination, repudiation, dispute,
disagreement or any other cause of the unavailability of any Financing has or
would be reasonably expected to have a Funds Certainty Effect and (D) if for
any reason Parent, HH Finance or Sub believe in good faith that they will not
be able to obtain all or any portion of the Financing on the terms, in the
manner or from the sources contemplated by the Financing Commitments or the
definitive agreements relating to the Financing, as the case may be.

 

(e) Prior to the Closing, at Parents sole expense, the Company shall, and
shall cause the Company Subsidiaries and instruct the Company Representatives
to, in each case, use their reasonable best efforts to provide to Parent, HH
Finance and Sub all customary cooperation reasonably requested by Parent or HH
Finance that is reasonably necessary in connection with the Debt Financing,
including reasonable best efforts to:

(i) cause management of the Company to participate in a reasonable number
of meetings, presentations, sessions with rating agencies and due diligence
sessions, in each case, with appropriate seniority and expertise;

 



58

    

(ii) provide reasonable and customary assistance with the preparation of
materials for rating agency presentations and bank information memoranda and

avoidance of doubt, payoff letters which contain each of the following shall

expenses, prepayment penalties or payments and other amounts payable in
respect thereof other than with respect to contingent obligations for which
no claims have been made) (the " _Payoff Amounts_ "), (2) such lenders
agreement that, if the Payoff Amount is paid to such lender on the Closing
Date, such payment will result in the full repayment, satisfaction,

the Liens related thereto and (3) wire instructions for payment of the Payoff
Amount) reasonably requested by Parent or its Debt Financing sources, in each
case, relating to the repayment of the existing Indebtedness as set forth in

the Company Subsidiaries (other than with respect to any Indebtedness that is
cash collateralized or otherwise backstopped, in each case, in a manner
reasonably satisfactory to Sub and the Lender Related Parties or with respect
to contingent obligations for which no claims have been made) (collectively,
the " _Payoff Letters_ ") and (y) UCC termination statements and other
documentation to evidence and/or effectuate the release of (1) any Liens

existing letters of credit, as applicable) with respect to the indebtedness
covered by the Payoff Letters and/or (2) any Liens for any Indebtedness is not
expressly permitted to remain outstanding hereunder (other than any cash that

_provided_ ,  _however_ , that notwithstanding anything in this _Section_ __
_ 5.15_ or elsewhere in this Agreement to the contrary, (1) in no event shall
this _Section_ __ _ 5.15(e)_ be deemed or construed to require such persons
to, and such persons shall not be required to, provide such cooperation to the

 extent it would (A) interfere unreasonably with the business or operations
of the Company or any of the Company Subsidiaries or jeopardize the health and
safety of any employee of the Company or the Company Subsidiaries, in light

manner that does not jeopardize such health and safety) or (B) require the

joinders, certificates (but, for the avoidance of doubt, no solvency
certificate), resolutions, incumbencies or other instruments, which shall not
be effective prior to the Effective Time (it being understood and agreed that
the refusal of any such employees to execute such agreements, certificates and
instruments shall not be deemed a breach of this Agreement), (5) in no event
shall the Company be in breach of this Agreement because of the failure of any
financial or other information to be delivered that is not currently readily
available to the Company on the date hereof or is not otherwise prepared in
the ordinary course of business of the Company at the time requested by
Parent, Sub or any Financing Source, (6) neither the Company nor any of the

statements required to be provided in accordance with the Debt Commitment
Letter or any Definitive Debt Financing Agreement, (7) neither the Company nor
any Company Subsidiaries shall be required to pay any commitment or other
similar fee or make any other payment (other than for reasonable out-of-
pocket costs or expenses that are reimbursed by Parent as provided below in
this _Section_ __ _ 5.15(e)_) or incur any other liability or provide or
agree to provide any indemnity in connection with the Financing or any of the
foregoing prior to the Effective Time and (8) nothing contained in this
_Section_ __ _ 5.15(e)_ or otherwise shall require the Company or any
Company Subsidiary, prior to the Effective Time, to be an issuer or other
obligor with respect to the Debt Financing. The Company hereby consents to the
use of its and the Company Subsidiaries logos in connection with the Debt
Financing so long as such logos are used solely in a manner that is not
intended or reasonably likely to harm, disparage or otherwise adversely affect
the Company or any of the Company Subsidiaries or the reputation or goodwill
of the Company or any of the Company Subsidiaries. Parent shall, promptly
upon request by the Company, reimburse the Company for all documented and
reasonable out-of-pocket costs and expenses incurred by the Company or any of
the Company Subsidiaries in connection with such cooperation. Parent shall
indemnify and

 



60

    

 hold harmless the Company, the Company Subsidiaries and the Company
Representatives (in the case of the Company and the Company Subsidiaries,
prior to the Effective Time) from and against any and all liabilities,
losses, damages, claims, costs, expenses, interest, awards, judgments and
penalties suffered or incurred by them in connection with the Financing
(including any action taken in accordance with this  _Section_ __ _
5.15(e)_) and any information utilized in connection therewith (other than
historical information provided in writing by the Company or the Company
Subsidiaries specifically for use in connection therewith). Notwithstanding
anything to the contrary, the condition set forth in _Section_ __ _ 6.02(b)_,
as it applies to the Companys obligations under _Section_ __ _ 5.15(e)_,
shall be deemed satisfied unless the Financing has not been obtained as a
result of the Companys or any Company Subsidiarys Willful and Material
Breach of its obligations under this _Section_ __ _ 5.15(e)_.

 

(f) The Company shall deliver, or cause to be delivered, to Parent, Sub and
the Financing Sources the executed Payoff Letters in respect of each of (i)
the Loan and Security Agreement, dated as of July 16, 2019, by and among,
_inter alia_ , the Company, as borrower, the guarantors from time to time
party thereto, the financial institutions from time to time party thereto as
lenders and TCW Asset Management Company LLC, as agent (as amended, restated,
amended and restated, modified, supplemented or otherwise replaced or
refinanced prior to the Effective Time in accordance with  _Section_ __ _
5.01_) and (ii) the Loan and Security Agreement, dated as of July 15, 2019, by
and among _inter alia_ , the Company and Eyelevel, Inc., as US Borrowers
(under and as defined therein), InnerWorkings Europe Limited and Professional
Packaging Services Ltd., as UK Borrowers (under and as defined therein), the
other guarantors from time to time party thereto, the financial institutions
from time to time party thereto as lenders and Bank of America, Inc., as
agent (as amended, restated, amended and restated, modified, supplemented or
otherwise replaced or refinanced prior to the Effective Time in accordance
with _Section_ __ _ 5.01_) at least one (1) Business Day prior to the
Closing Date (or such later date as acceptable to Parent in its reasonable
discretion and Parent and Sub shall cooperate with the Company with respect to
obtaining such Payoff Letters).

 

(g) Each of Parent and Sub acknowledge and agrees that neither the
obtaining of the Financing, the Credit Agreement Financing Documents or any
Alternative Financing is a condition to the occurrence of the Closing, and
reaffirms its obligation to consummate the Transactions irrespective and
independently of the availability of the Financing or any
alternative financing, subject to the applicable conditions set forth in
_Section_ __ _ 6.01_ and _Section_ __ _ 6.02_ and subject to _Section_ __ _
8.10_.

 

(h) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary herein, Parent, HH Finance and
Sub shall, and shall cause their Subsidiaries to, comply in all respects with
the representations and covenants of the HH Existing Credit Agreement (as
amended by the Amendment and Waiver Letter and/or as amended, restated,
amended and restated or otherwise modified or supplemented in accordance with
_Section_ __ _ 5.15(a)_ and/or _Section_ __ _ 5.15(c)_) that are within
their control to the extent any breach or inaccuracy of or failure to perform
any such representations and covenants would constitute a Major Event of
Default in the Credit Agreement Financing Documents and/or the Definitive Debt
Financing Agreements and that could reasonably be expected to have a Funds
Certainty Effect with respect to the Debt Financing. Parent and HH Finance
shall ensure that no Change of Control (as defined in the Credit Agreement
Financing Documents or the Debt Commitment Letter) occurs provided Parent, Sub
and HH Finance shall not be in breach of this _Section_ __ _ 5.15(h)_ as a
result of a

 



61

    

 Change of Control if they have, at or substantially simultaneously with the
execution of any definitive agreement to effect or documentation that would
result in such Change of Control, substituted the Credit Agreement Financing
Documents and/or the Debt Commitment Letter with Alternative Financing, as
applicable or have obtained a waiver of such Change of Control from the
relevant lenders.

 

(i) Neither Parent nor HH Finance shall sell, encumber or otherwise dispose
of any properties or assets, in each case, the principal purpose of which is
to avoid its obligations under this Agreement.

Exchange Act at the Effective Time.

to cause to be delivered to Parent resignations executed by each director of
the Company in office as of immediately prior to the Effective Time, effective
upon the Effective Time.

Meeting_.

 

(a) As promptly as practicable following the date of this Agreement, the
Company shall prepare and cause to be filed with the SEC a proxy statement to
be sent to the Companys stockholders relating to the Company Stockholders
Meeting (together with any amendments or supplements thereto, the " _Proxy
Statement_ "). Unless the board of directors (or a duly authorized committee
thereof) has made a Change of Company Recommendation in accordance with the
provisions of this Agreement, the Proxy Statement shall include the Company
Recommendation. Parent, Sub and the Company will cooperate with each other
with respect to the preparation of the Proxy Statement, and Parent and Sub
shall furnish all information concerning it and its affiliates required under
the Exchange Act to be included in the Proxy Statement. The Company shall
promptly notify Parent upon the receipt of any comments from the SEC or any
request from the SEC for amendments or supplements to the Proxy Statement and
shall provide Parent with copies of all non-routine correspondence between
the Company or its Representatives, on the one hand, and the SEC or its staff,
on the other hand, related to the Proxy Statement. The Company shall use its
reasonable best efforts to respond as promptly as practicable to,
and resolve, any comments from the SEC with respect to the Proxy Statement,
and Parent will cooperate in connection therewith. Notwithstanding the
foregoing, prior to filing or mailing the Proxy Statement (including any
preliminary proxy statement and any amendment or supplement thereto) or any
other documents related to the Company Stockholders Meeting, or responding to
any comments of the SEC with respect thereto, the Company (i) shall provide
Parent a reasonable opportunity to review and comment on the Proxy Statement
(and any amendment or supplement thereto), any other documents related to the
Company Stockholders Meeting or response (including the proposed final version
of the Proxy Statement or response) and (ii) shall consider in good faith all
comments reasonably proposed by Parent.

 



62

    

(b) If at any time prior to the Company Stockholders Meeting
any information relating to the Company or Parent, or any of their respective
Subsidiaries, should be discovered by a party hereto, which information should
be set forth in an amendment or supplement to the Proxy Statement, the party
hereto that discovers such information shall promptly notify the other
parties hereto and the Company shall prepare (with the assistance of Parent)
and mail to its stockholders such an amendment or supplement, in each case, to
the extent required by applicable Law. Each of the Company, Parent and Sub
agrees to promptly (i) correct any information provided by it specifically for
use in the Proxy Statement if and to the extent that such information shall
have become false or misleading in any material respect and (ii) supplement
the information provided by it specifically for use in the Proxy Statement to
include any information that shall become necessary in order to make the
statements in the Proxy Statement, in light of the circumstances under which
they were made, not misleading. The Company further agrees to cause the Proxy
Statement as so corrected or supplemented promptly to be filed with the SEC
and to be disseminated to the Companys stockholders, in each case as and
to the extent required by applicable Law. Nothing in this _Section_ __ _
5.18(b)_ shall limit the obligations of any party under _Section_ __ _
5.18(a)_.

 

(c) Unless this Agreement has been terminated, the Company shall promptly
conduct a "broker search" in accordance with Rule 14a-13 of the Exchange Act
and shall take, in accordance with applicable Law and its certificate of
incorporation and by-laws, all action necessary to establish a record date
for, duly call, give notice of, convene and hold the Company Stockholders
Meeting as promptly as practicable after the SEC Clearance Date, for the
purpose of seeking the Company Stockholder Approval (which
Company Stockholders Meeting shall in no event be initially set for later
than the thirtieth (30th) calendar day immediately following the date of the
first mailing of the Proxy Statement (and if such day is not a Business Day,
on the first Business Day subsequent to such day)). Without the prior written
consent of Parent (which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld,
conditioned or delayed), the foregoing shall be the only matter (other than
procedure matters and executive compensation matters related to the
Transactions) which the Company shall propose to be acted on by the holders of
Company Common Stock at the Company Stockholders Meeting. In connection with
the foregoing, the Company shall (i) file the definitive Proxy Statement with
the SEC and cause the definitive Proxy Statement to be mailed to the Companys
stockholders as of the record date established for the Company Stockholders
Meeting as promptly as practicable (and in any event shall use reasonable
best efforts to do so within five (5) Business Days) after the date on which
the Company is informed that the SEC has no further comments on the Proxy
Statement (the " _SEC Clearance Date_ "; provided that if the SEC has failed
to affirmatively notify the Company within ten (10) calendar days after the
initial filing of the Proxy Statement with the SEC that it will or will not be
reviewing the Proxy Statement, then such date shall be the " _SEC
Clearance Date_ "); and (ii) unless the board of directors of the Company (or
a duly authorized committee thereof) has made a Change of Company
Recommendation in accordance with _Section_ __ _ 5.03(e)_ or _ Section_ __ _
5.03(f)_, use reasonable best efforts to solicit the Company Stockholder
Approval. The Company shall, through the Companys board of directors, make
the Company Recommendation and shall include such recommendation in the Proxy
Statement, in each case, unless the board of directors (or a duly authorized
committee thereof) has made a Change of Company Recommendation in accordance
with _Section_ __ _ 5.03(e)_ or  _Section_ __ _ 5.03(f)_. Notwithstanding
anything to the contrary in this Agreement, the Company may postpone or
adjourn the Company Stockholders Meeting only (and shall postpone or adjourn

the consent of Parent and Sub, (B) for the absence of a quorum, (C) to allow
reasonable additional time for any supplemental or amended disclosure which
the Company has determined in good faith is necessary under applicable Law and
for such supplemental or amended disclosure to be disseminated and reviewed by
the Companys stockholders prior to the Company Stockholders Meeting or
following an order or request from the SEC or (D) to allow additional
solicitation of votes in order to obtain the Company Stockholder Approval. In
the event that the date of the Company Stockholders Meeting as originally
called is for any reason adjourned or postponed or otherwise delayed, the
Company agrees that unless Parent shall have otherwise approved in writing, it
shall use reasonable best efforts to implement such adjournment or
postponement or other delay in such a way that the Company does not establish
a new record date for the Company Stockholders Meeting, as so adjourned,
postponed or delayed, except as required by applicable Law. Unless this
Agreement is validly terminated in accordance with _Section_ __ _ 7.01_
prior to the Company Stockholders Meeting, the Company shall submit this
Agreement and the Merger to its stockholders at the Company Stockholders
Meeting, even if the Companys board of directors (or a committee thereof)

with Parent regarding the date to be used as the record date and the timing of
any "broker search" required under Rule 14a-13 of the Exchange Act.

Proposal, then the Company shall pay to Parent or its designee, on the date
of the consummation of such Competing Proposal, the Company Termination Fee;
_provided_ , that for purposes of this _Section_ __ _ 7.02(b)(ii)_, the term
" _Competing Proposal_ " shall have the meaning assigned to such term, except
that all percentages therein shall be changed to "50%"; provided, further,
that to the extent this Agreement is terminated by Parent pursuant to 
_Section_ __ _ 7.01(g)_ in respect of a Willful and Material Breach of
_Section_ __ _ 5.03_, _clause (B)_ shall not be required in order to trigger
the payment of the Company Termination Fee (as long as the conditions set
forth in _clause (C)_ are satisfied).

(c) _Parent Payment_. If this Agreement is terminated (i) by the Company
pursuant to _Section_ __ _ 7.01(h)_ or _Section_ __ _ 7.01(i)_ or (ii) by
Parent pursuant to _Section_ __ _ 7.01(b)_ at a time when the Company could
have terminated under _Section_ __ _ 7.01(i)_ (without giving effect to the
requirement in _Section_ __ _ 7.01(i)_), then Parent shall promptly pay the
Parent Termination Fee to the Company or its designee, within two (2)
Business Days following the date of such termination.

(d) The parties acknowledge and agree that each of the Company Termination
Fee or Parent Termination Fee, as the case may be, if, as and when required to
be paid pursuant to this _Section 7.02_, shall not constitute a penalty but
is a reasonable amount that is intended to compensate the party receiving
such amount in the circumstances in which it is payable for the efforts and
resources expended and opportunities foregone while negotiating this Agreement
and in reliance on this Agreement and the Transactions, subject to the
payment of any Damages for Willful and Material Breach also payable in such
circumstances to the extent recovered hereunder (in accordance with _Section
7.02(a)_ and subject to the limitations set forth in _Section 7.02(f))_.

 

(e) Subject to Parents right to seek specific performance pursuant to
_Section_ __ _ 8.10_, the parties hereby acknowledge and agree that in the
event that the Company Termination Fee is paid or payable by the Company
pursuant to _Section_ __ _ 7.02(b)_, except as otherwise provided in 
_Section_ __ _ 7.02(a)_, the Company Termination Fee shall be the sole and
exclusive monetary remedy available to the Parent Related Parties for any and
all losses or damages suffered or incurred by the Parent Related Parties
in connection with this Agreement (and the termination of this Agreement),
the transactions contemplated by this Agreement (and the abandonment thereof)
or any matter forming the basis for such termination, and upon payment of such
amounts in such circumstances, none of the Company, the Company Subsidiaries
or any of their Representatives shall have any further liability or obligation
relating to or arising out of this Agreement or the Transactions. The Company,
Parent, HH Finance and Sub acknowledge that (i) the agreements contained in
this _Section_ __ _ 7.02_ are an integral part of the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement and (ii) without these agreements, Parent, HH
Finance, Sub and the Company would not enter into this Agreement. In no event
shall the Company be required to pay to Parent more than one Company
Termination Fee.

 

(f) Subject to the Companys right to seek specific performance pursuant to
_Section_ __ _ 8.10_ or the Equity Commitment Letter (in accordance with the
terms thereof), the parties hereby acknowledge and agree that in the event
that the Parent Termination Fee is paid or payable

 



69

    

 by Parent pursuant to _Section_ __ _ 7.02(b)_, except as otherwise provided
in _Section_ __ _ 7.02(a)_, the Parent Termination Fee shall be the sole
and exclusive remedy available to the Company, the Company Subsidiaries and
any of their respective former, current or future stockholders, managers,
members, directors, officers, employees, agents, advisors, other
representatives, successors or assignees of any of the foregoing
(collectively, the " _Company Related Parties_ ") for any and all losses or
damages suffered or incurred by the Company Related Parties in connection with
this Agreement (and the termination of this Agreement), the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement (and the abandonment thereof) or any matter
forming the basis for such termination, and upon payment of such amount, none
of the Parent Related Parties shall have any further liability or obligation
relating to or arising out of this Agreement or the Transactions. Without
limiting the foregoing, and notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this
Agreement, the parties hereby acknowledge and agree that if Parent, HH Finance
or Sub breaches this Agreement (whether willfully (including a Willful and
Material Breach) intentionally, unintentionally or otherwise) or fails to
perform hereunder (whether willfully (including a Willful and Material
Breach), intentionally, unintentionally or otherwise), then, except for the
right to seek specific performance in accordance with and subject to the terms
and conditions of _Section_ __ _ 8.10_ or under the Equity Commitment Letter
(in accordance with the terms thereof), the sole and exclusive remedies
(whether at law, in equity, in contract, in tort or otherwise) against Parent,
HH Finance, Sub, the Equity Financing Source, any other equity financing
source, and their respective affiliates and Subsidiaries, or any of their or
their affiliates respective direct or indirect, former, current or future
general or limited partners, stockholders, equityholders, managers, members
directors, officers, employees, agents, advisors, other representatives or
successors or assignees of any of the foregoing (excluding Parent, HH Finance
and Sub, the " _Parent Related Parties_ ") or the Lender Related Parties for
any breach, loss, damage or failure to perform under, this Agreement or any
certificate or other document delivered in connection herewith or otherwise or
in respect of any oral representation made or alleged to have been made in
connection herewith or therewith, or any termination of this Agreement
or failure of the Transactions to occur, or any matter forming the basis
thereof, shall be for the Company to (x) terminate this Agreement pursuant to
_Section_ __ _ 7.01(h)_ or _Section_ __ _ 7.01(i)_ and receive payment of
the Parent Termination Fee (and, solely in the event of a Willful and Material
Breach by Parent, HH Finance or Sub prior to such termination, additionally
seek to recover monetary damages in an amount, when taken together with
the Parent Termination Fee, not to exceed the Parent Willful Breach Cap) or
(y) seek to recover monetary damages from Parent, subject to _Section_ __ _
7.02(a)_, in connection with any termination of this Agreement
in circumstances in which the Parent Termination Fee is not actually payable;
_provided_ , that in no event shall Parent be subject to monetary damages
(including the amount of the Parent Termination Fee paid or payable) in excess
of the amount of the Parent Willful Breach Cap; _provided_ , _further_ ,
that in no event will the Company be entitled to both the Parent Termination
Fee (or any monetary damages in connection with this Agreement) and specific
performance of this Agreement to consummate the Closing (it being understood
and agreed that the Company may obtain both specific performance to cause
Parent, Sub or HH Finance to perform its other obligations under this
Agreement (including to obtain the Financing or to make (or cause to be made)
the filings required under _Section_ __ _ 5.05_, but not to consummate the
Merger or the Transactions or specific performance pursuant to the Equity
Commitment Letter) and, solely to the extent the Company has not obtained
specific performance of the Agreement to consummate the Closing (or specific
performance under the Equity Commitment Letter) and is no longer seeking any
such specific performance, the Parent Termination Fee and/or other monetary
damages, in the aggregate in an

 



70

    

 amount not in excess of the Parent Willful Breach Cap, solely to the extent
such amounts are payable in accordance with the terms of this Agreement,
including this  _Section_ __ _ 7.02(f)_). Notwithstanding anything to the
contrary set forth herein, in no circumstances will Parent be required to pay
or be subject to any monetary damages (when taken together with any portion of
the Parent Termination Fee which has been paid) in excess of the amount of
the Parent Willful Breach Cap. The Company, Parent, HH Finance and Sub
acknowledge that (i) the agreements contained in this _Section_ __ _ 7.02_
are an integral part of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement and
(ii) without these agreements, Parent, Sub and the Company would not enter
into this Agreement. In no event shall Parent be required to pay to the
Company more than one Parent Termination Fee. For the avoidance of doubt, and
in any event subject to the other provisions of this _Section_ __ _ 7.02(f)_,
in the event of a Willful and Material Breach by Parent, HH Finance or Sub,
the Company shall be permitted to seek to recover Damages against Parent and
its Subsidiaries in respect of such Willful and Material Breach in an amount
not to exceed the Parent Willful Breach Cap (taking into account any payment
of the Parent Termination Fee). " _Parent Willful Breach Cap_ " means an
amount equal to $30,000,000, provided that if the Parent Termination Fee has
been paid to the Company by or on behalf of Parent, the Parent Willful Breach
Cap shall be reduced by the amount of the Parent Termination Fee that has
been paid to the Company by or on behalf of Parent.

(g) This Agreement may only be enforced against, and any claims or causes
of action that may be based upon or under, arise out of or relate to this
Agreement, or the negotiation, execution or performance of this Agreement, may

Letter, the parties thereto). No Parent Related Party or Lender Related Party

of, the Transactions contemplated by this Agreement or in respect of any
oral representations made or alleged to be made in connection herewith.

against, or seek to recovery monetary damages for breach of this Agreement or
otherwise in connection with the Transactions from, any Parent Related Party
(other than Parent, HH Finance and its Subsidiaries) or any Lender Related
Party. For the avoidance of doubt, the foregoing shall not limit the right of
the Company to specific performance against Parent, HH Finance or Sub pursuant
to _Section_ __ _ 8.10_ (in accordance with the terms thereof) or against
Equity Financing Sources pursuant to the Equity Commitment Letter (in
accordance with the terms thereof). No Company Related Party (other than the

damages for breach of this Agreement or otherwise in connection with the
Transactions from, any Company Related Party (other than the Company and the
Company Subsidiaries).

the other contained in this Agreement or in any document delivered pursuant
hereto and (c) waive compliance by the other with any of the covenants or
conditions contained in this Agreement. No extension or waiver, or termination
of this Agreement, by the Company shall require the approval of the Companys
stockholders unless such approval is required by Law. Any such extension or
waiver shall be valid only if set forth in an instrument in writing signed by
the party or parties to be bound thereby, but such extension or waiver or
failure to insist on strict compliance with an obligation, covenant, agreement
or condition shall not operate as a waiver of, or estoppel with respect to,
any subsequent or other failure.

shall be void.

which shall be for the benefit of any person entitled to payment thereunder,

Business Day, the period in question shall end on the next succeeding Business
Day. References to documents being "provided", "made available" or "delivered"

accordance with, the Laws of the State of Delaware, without giving effect to
the principles of conflicts of Law thereof.

(b) Each of the parties irrevocably agrees that any legal Proceeding
arising out of or relating to this Agreement brought by any other party or its

Chancery and any state appellate court therefrom within the State of Delaware
(unless the Delaware Court of Chancery shall decline to accept jurisdiction
over a particular matter, in which case, in any Delaware state or federal
court within the State of Delaware), and each of the parties hereby
irrevocably submits to the exclusive jurisdiction of the aforesaid courts for
itself and with respect to its property, generally and unconditionally, with
regard to any such Proceeding arising out of or relating to this Agreement or
the transactions contemplated by this Agreement. Each of the parties agrees
not to commence any Proceeding relating thereto except in the courts described
above in Delaware, other than actions in any court of competent jurisdiction
to enforce any judgment, decree or award rendered by any such court in
Delaware as described in this Agreement. Each of the parties further agrees
that notice as provided in this Agreement shall constitute sufficient service
of process, and the parties further waive any argument that such service is
insufficient. Each of the parties hereby irrevocably and unconditionally
waives, and agrees not to assert, by way of motion or as a defense,
counterclaim

 



75

    

 or otherwise, in any Proceeding arising out of or relating to this Agreement
or the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, (i) any claim that it is
not personally subject to the jurisdiction of the courts in Delaware as
described in this Agreement for any reason, (ii) that it or its property is
exempt or immune from jurisdiction of any such court or from any legal process
commenced in such courts (whether through service of notice, attachment prior
to judgment, attachment in aid of execution of judgment, execution of judgment
or otherwise) and (iii) that (A) the Proceeding in any such court is brought
in an inconvenient forum, (B) the venue of such Proceeding is improper or (C)
this Agreement, or the subject matter of this Agreement, may not be enforced
in or by such courts.

 

(c) EACH PARTY ACKNOWLEDGES AND AGREES THAT ANY CONTROVERSY WHICH MAY ARISE

MAY HAVE TO A TRIAL BY JURY IN RESPECT OF ANY LITIGATION DIRECTLY OR
INDIRECTLY ARISING OUT OF OR RELATING TO THIS AGREEMENT OR ANY OF
THE TRANSACTIONS CONTEMPLATED BY THIS AGREEMENT. EACH PARTY CERTIFIES AND
ACKNOWLEDGES THAT (I) NO REPRESENTATIVE, AGENT OR ATTORNEY OF ANY OTHER PARTY
HAS REPRESENTED, EXPRESSLY OR OTHERWISE, THAT SUCH OTHER PARTY WOULD NOT, IN
THE EVENT OF LITIGATION, SEEK TO ENFORCE THE FOREGOING WAIVER, (II) IT
UNDERSTANDS AND HAS CONSIDERED THE IMPLICATIONS OF THE FOREGOING WAIVER, (III)
IT MAKES THE FOREGOING WAIVER VOLUNTARILY, AND (IV) IT HAS BEEN INDUCED TO
ENTER INTO THIS AGREEMENT BY, AMONG OTHER THINGS, THE MUTUAL WAIVERS AND
CERTIFICATIONS IN THIS _SECTION_ __ _ 8.08(C)_.

 

Section 8.09 _Counterparts_. This Agreement may be executed in two or more
counterparts, and by the different parties hereto in separate counterparts,
each of which when executed shall be deemed to be an original but all of which
taken together shall constitute one and the same agreement. The exchange of a
fully executed Agreement (in counterparts or otherwise) by electronic
delivery in .pdf format shall be sufficient to bind the parties to the terms
and conditions of this Agreement.

 

Section 8.10 _Specific Performance_.

 

(a) The parties agree that irreparable damage would occur in the event that
any of the provisions of this Agreement were not performed, or were
threatened to be not performed, in accordance with their specific terms or
were otherwise breached. Accordingly, the parties acknowledge and agree that,
subject in all respects to the terms and conditions of this Section 8.10, the
parties shall be entitled to an injunction, specific performance and other
equitable relief to prevent breaches or threatened breaches of this Agreement
and to enforce specifically the terms and provisions of this Agreement, this
being in addition to any other remedy to which they are entitled at law or in
equity, without proof of damages or otherwise. The parties agree that,
notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, the Company shall be entitled
to injunctive relief, specific performance or other equitable relief to cause
the Equity Financing to be consummated (whether under this Agreement or the
Equity Commitment Letter, but in each case in accordance with the terms hereof
or thereof) and to cause Parent and Sub to consummate the Merger and to

 



76

    

 effect the Closing (including to deposit with the Paying Agent funds equal
to the Aggregate Common Stock Consideration as required by _Section_ __ _
2.02_ and to deposit with the Surviving Corporation the funds contemplated by
_Section_ __ _ 2.03(g)_) in accordance with _Section_ __ _ 1.02_ and
_Article_ __ _ II_ on the terms and subject to the conditions in
this Agreement, if, and only if: (i) all of the conditions set forth in
_Section_ __ _ 6.01_ and _Section_ __ _ 6.02_ have been satisfied as of the
date on which the Closing would otherwise be required to occur (other than
those conditions that, by their nature, are to be satisfied at the Closing
(each of which is capable of being satisfied at the Closing) but subject to
the satisfaction or waiver of such conditions), (ii) Parent and Sub are
required to consummate the Closing in accordance with _Section_ __ _ 1.02_
and fail to complete the Closing by the date the Closing would otherwise be
required to have occurred pursuant to _Section_ __ _ 1.02,_ (iii) the
Debt Financing (including any alternative financing in accordance with
_Section_ __ _ 5.15(c)_) has been or will be funded at the Effective Time if
the Equity Financing is consummated and (iv) the Company has irrevocably
confirmed in writing to Parent that if specific performance is granted and
the Financing (including any alternative financing in accordance with
_Section_ __ _ 5.15(c)_) is funded, then the Company will, subject to
conditions in  _Article_ __ _ VI_, cause the Closing to occur in accordance
with this Agreement. Notwithstanding anything else to the contrary in this
Agreement, while the Company may concurrently seek specific performance
subject in all respects to this _Section_ __ _ 8.10_ and payment of the
Parent Termination Fee or monetary damages (if, as and when required pursuant
to this Agreement), under no circumstances shall the Company be permitted or
entitled to receive both an injunction, grant of specific performance or
other equitable relief providing for the consummation of the Equity Financing
or the Merger pursuant to this _Section_ __ _ 8.10_ and the payment of the
Parent Termination Fee or any monetary damages (subject in any case to the
limitations set forth in _Section_ __ _ 7.02(f)_).

 

(b) Each of the parties agrees that, (i) the seeking of remedies pursuant
to this  _Section_ __ _ 8.10_ shall not in any way constitute a waiver by
any party seeking such remedies of its right to seek any other form of relief
that may be available to it under this Agreement, including under  _Section_
__ _ 7.02_, in the event that this Agreement has been terminated or in the
event that the remedies provided for in this _Section_ __ _ 8.10_ are not
available or otherwise are not granted, (ii) nothing set forth in this
Agreement shall require a party to institute any Proceeding for (or limit a
partys right to institute any Proceeding for) specific performance under this
_Section_ __ _ 8.10_ prior, or as a condition, to exercising any termination
right under _Article_ __ _ VII_ (and pursuing damages after such
termination), nor shall the commencement of any Proceeding seeking remedies
pursuant to this  _Section_ __ _ 8.10_ or anything set forth in this
_Section_ __ _ 8.10_ restrict or limit a partys right to terminate this
Agreement in accordance with the terms of _Article_ __ _ VII_ or pursue any
other remedies under this Agreement that may be available then or thereafter,
(iii) no party shall require the other to post any bond or other security as a
condition to institute any Proceeding for specific performance under this 
_Section_ __ _ 8.10_, (iv) the right of specific performance is an integral
part of the Transactions and without that right, none of the parties would
have entered into this Agreement and (v) each of the parties agrees that
it will not oppose the granting of an injunction, specific performance and
other equitable relief on the basis that the other parties (on behalf of
themselves or any third party beneficiary to this Agreement) have an adequate
remedy at law or an award of specific performance is not an appropriate

_Exhibit A _

 

THIRD AMENDED AND RESTATED

 

CERTIFICATE OF INCORPORATION

OF 

INNERWORKINGS, INC.

 

ARTICLE I

The name of the Corporation is InnerWorkings, Inc. (hereinafter the "
_Corporation_ ").

ARTICLE II

 

The address of the registered office of the Corporation in the State of
Delaware is 1209 Orange Street in the City of Wilmington, County of New
Castle, 19801. The name of its registered agent at that address is The
Corporation Trust Company.

ARTICLE III

 

The purpose of the Corporation is to engage in any lawful act or activity for
which a corporation may be organized under the General Corporation Law of the
State of Delaware as set forth in Title 8 of the Delaware Code (the " _DGCL_
").

ARTICLE IV 

_Section 1_. The total number of shares of stock which the Corporation shall
have authority to issue is 1,000 shares of common stock, each having a par
value of $0.001 (the " _Common Stock_ ").

_Section 2_. Shares of the Common Stock may be issued from time to time as
the board of directors of the Corporation (the " _Board of Directors_ ") shall
determine and on such terms and for such consideration as shall be fixed by
the Board. The amount of the authorized Common Stock of the Corporation may
be increased or decreased by the affirmative vote of the holders of a majority
of the outstanding Common Stock of the Corporation entitled to vote.

 

ARTICLE V

The business and affairs of the Corporation shall be managed by or under the
direction of the Board of Directors. Elections of directors need not be by
written ballot unless required by the Bylaws of the Corporation. Any director
may be removed from office either with or without cause at any time by the
affirmative vote of the holders of a majority of the outstanding Common Stock
of the Corporation entitled to vote, given at a meeting of the stockholders
called for that purpose, or by the consent of the holders of a majority of
the outstanding Common Stock of the Corporation entitled to vote, given in
accordance with DGCL Section 228\. The number of directors of the Corporation
shall be as from time to time fixed by, or in the manner provided in, the
Bylaws

 



A-1

    

 of the Corporation. Except to the extent prohibited by law, the Board of
Directors shall have the right (which, to the extent exercised, shall be
exclusive) to establish the rights, powers, duties, rules and procedures that
from time to time shall govern the Board of Directors and each of its members,
including, without limitation, the vote required for any action by the Board
of Directors, and that from time to time shall affect the directors power to
manage the business and affairs of the Corporation.

ARTICLE VI

 

In furtherance and not in limitation of the powers conferred upon the Board of
Directors by law, the Board of Directors shall have the power to make, adopt,
alter, amend and repeal from time to time the Bylaws of the Corporation
subject to the right of the stockholders entitled to vote with respect thereto
to alter, amend and repeal Bylaws made by the Board.

 

ARTICLE VII

 

 _Section_ __ _ 1_. Each person who is or was a director or officer of the
Corporation shall be indemnified by the Corporation to the fullest extent
permitted from time to time by the DGCL as the same exists or may hereafter be
amended (but, if permitted by applicable law, in the case of any such
amendment, only to the extent that such amendment permits the Corporation to
provide broader indemnification rights than said law permitted the Corporation
to provide prior to such amendment) or any other applicable laws as presently
or hereafter in effect. The Corporation may, by action of the Board
of Directors, provide indemnification to employees and agents (other than a
director or officer) of the Corporation, to directors, officers, employees or
agents of a subsidiary, and to each person serving as a director, officer,
partner, member, employee or agent of another corporation, partnership,
limited liability company, joint venture, trust or other enterprise, at the
request of the Corporation, with the same scope and effect as the foregoing
indemnification of directors and officers of the Corporation. The Corporation
shall be required to indemnify any person seeking indemnification in
connection with a proceeding (or part thereof) initiated by such person only
if such proceeding (or part thereof) was authorized by the Board of Directors
or is a proceeding to enforce such persons claim to indemnification pursuant
to the rights granted by this Certificate of Incorporation (this "
_Certificate_ ") or otherwise by the Corporation. Without limiting
the generality or the effect of the foregoing, the Corporation may enter into
one or more agreements with any person which provide for indemnification
greater or different than that provided in this Certificate. Any amendment or
repeal of this Certificate shall not adversely affect any right or protection
existing hereunder in respect of any act or omission occurring prior to such
amendment or repeal.

 

 _Section_ __ _ 2_. By action of its Board of Directors, notwithstanding any
interest of the directors in the action, the Corporation may purchase and
maintain insurance, in such amounts as the Board of Directors deems
appropriate, to protect any director, officer, employee and agent of the
Corporation, any director, officer, employee or agent of a subsidiary, and
any person serving as a director, officer, partner, member, employee or agent
of another corporation, partnership, limited liability company, joint venture,
trust or other enterprise (including, without limitation, any employee benefit
plan) against any liability asserted against such person or incurred by such
person in any such capacity or arising out of the persons status as such
(including, without limitation, expenses, judgments, fines and amounts paid in
settlement) to the fullest extent permitted by the DGCL as it exists on the
date hereof or as it may hereafter be amended, and whether or not the

 



A-2

    

 Corporation would have the power or would be required to indemnify any such
person under the terms of any agreement or by-law or the DGCL. For purposes
of this _Article VII_ , "fines" shall include any excise taxes assessed on a
person with respect to any employee benefit plan.

 

 _Section_ __ _ 3_. If this Certificate or any portion hereof shall be
invalidated on any ground by any court of competent jurisdiction, then the
Corporation shall nevertheless indemnify each person entitled to
indemnification under the first paragraph of this _Article VII_ as to all
expense, liability and loss (including attorneys fees and
related disbursements, judgments, fines, ERISA excise taxes and penalties,
penalties and amounts paid or to be paid in settlement) actually and
reasonably incurred or suffered by such person and for which indemnification
is available to such person pursuant to this Certificate to the full extent
permitted by any applicable portion of this Certificate that shall not have
been invalidated and to the full extent permitted by applicable law.

 

 _Section_ __ _ 4_. Any repeal or modification of the foregoing paragraph by
the stockholders of the Corporation shall not adversely affect any right or
protection of a director, officer or employee of the Corporation existing at
the time of such repeal or modification.

 

ARTICLE VIII

A director of the Corporation shall not be personally liable to the
Corporation or its stockholders for monetary damages for breach of fiduciary
duty as a director, except for liability (1) for any breach of the directors
duty of loyalty to the Corporation or its stockholders, (2) for acts or
omissions not in good faith or which involve intentional misconduct or a
knowing violation of law, (3) under Section 174 of the DGCL, or (4) for any
transaction from which the director derived an improper personal benefit. Any
amendment or repeal of this _Article VIII_ shall not adversely affect any
right or protection of a director of the Corporation existing hereunder in
respect of any act or omission occurring prior to such amendment or repeal.
If the DGCL shall be amended to authorize corporation action further
eliminating or limiting the liability of directors, then a director of the
Corporation, in addition to the circumstances in which he is not liable
immediately prior to such amendment, shall be free of liability to the fullest
extent permitted by the DGCL, as so amended.

 

ARTICLE IX

Meetings of stockholders may be held within or without the State of Delaware,
as the By-Laws may provide. The books of the Corporation may be kept (subject
to any provision contained in the DGCL) outside the State of Delaware at such
place or places as may be designated from time to time by the Board of
Directors or in the Bylaws of the Corporation.

 

ARTICLE X

The Corporation reserves the right to amend, alter, change or repeal any
provision contained in this Certificate, in the manner now or hereafter
prescribed by statute, and all rights conferred upon stockholders herein are
granted subject to this reservation.
