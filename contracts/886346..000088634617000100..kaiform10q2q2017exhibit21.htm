agreement identified in Section 6.12(f) of the Disclosure Schedules.

(c) Allocation of Aggregate Purchase Price Among Buyers. The aggregate
purchase price for the Shares and VFR Assets (the "Aggregate Purchase Price")
consists of an amount equal to the sum of: (i) the Transaction Price, plus
(ii) the amount of Closing Cash, minus (c) the amount of Closing Indebtedness,
minus (d) the amount (if any) by which Closing Net Working Capital is less
than Target Net Working Capital, plus (e) the amount (if any) by which Closing
Net Working Capital is greater than Target Net Working Capital. The Parties
acknowledge and agree that the Aggregate Purchase Price, as adjusted pursuant
to this Agreement, and the Buyers' purchase of the Shares and the VFR Patent
Assets from the Sellers pursuant to this Agreement shall be allocated among
the Buyers in the manner set forth in a written notice delivered by the Buyers

of Section 9.8(g) with respect to the allocations of the Aggregate Purchase
Price in respect of the Shares among the relevant assets.

(d) Withholding. The Buyers will be entitled to deduct and withhold from any

timely remitted by the Buyers to the appropriate Governmental Authority and

Person in respect of which such deduction and withholding was made. The Buyers
shall notify the Sellers of any such withholdings at least three Business Days
prior to the Closing Date and shall, reasonably and in good faith, consider
any comments from the Sellers relating to such withholdings. Notwithstanding
the foregoing, no Buyer shall be entitled to deduct and withhold from any
payment any Taxes that would not be required to be deducted and withheld if
such Buyer were a U.S. person except to the extent such withholding is
required as a result of a breach by the Sellers of their representations and
warranties in Section 6.15.

(e) Company Group Transaction Expenses. Prior to the Closing, the Sellers
shall cause the Company Group and its Subsidiaries to make accruals in
connection with all Company Group Transaction Expenses that shall not be paid

cause the Company Group and its Subsidiaries pay all such Company Group
Transaction Expenses through the normal payroll processing systems of the
Company Group and its Subsidiaries, where applicable, or otherwise; provided,
however, that the Sellers shall provide invoices or other appropriate details
in connection therewith at least five Business Days prior to the Closing Date;
provided further that to the extent that the contractual arrangements in
connection with any such payment entitles the payor thereof to a release and
discharge, the making of such payment pursuant to this Section 2.2(e) shall be
subject to the receipt by the Company Group or one of its Subsidiaries of a
release and discharge by the payee, in a form reasonably acceptable to the
Buyers, or a written undertaking by the payee, in a form reasonably acceptable
to the Buyers, to provide such a release and discharge upon receipt of such
payment; provided further that in connection with any such payment to Douglas
B. Jeffrey or Simo Jutila that is to be calculated as a percentage of the
aggregate purchase price for the Shares and VFR Assets, the making of such
payment pursuant to this Section 2.2(e) and the releases by such individuals
shall be subject to (i) the receipt by the Buyers of a written undertaking by
such individual, in a form reasonably acceptable to the Buyers, to repay to
the Company Group the amount of any overpayment in connection therewith
promptly after giving effect to any adjustment to such purchase price
following the Closing in accordance with the terms and conditions of this
Agreement and (ii) a commitment by the relevant Company Group entity that it
will pay to such individuals any additional amount that may be due upon any
positive adjustment to such purchase price or upon release to the Sellers from
the Purchase Price Escrow Amount or the Indemnity Escrow Amount. The Buyers
acknowledge that the Senior Executive Bonus Amount will have been accrued as

the Indemnity Escrow Amount will be released to the Sellers; to the extent any
portion of such amounts are released to the Buyers, the Buyers shall promptly
remit to the Sellers, as an additional payment of purchase price, the related
portion of the sales transaction bonuses not payable to the individuals in

2.3 Closing Cash Proceeds Adjustment.

(a) At least seven Business Days prior to the Closing Date, the Sellers shall
prepare and deliver to the Buyers a good faith estimate of the Closing Cash
Proceeds, including each of the components thereof (except Closing Net Working
Capital) (such estimate, as approved by the Buyers, which such approval shall
not be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed) (the "Estimated Closing
Cash Proceeds") based on the books and records of the Company Group and its
Subsidiaries and other information then available, it being understood that
the Estimated Cash Proceeds shall assume that, for




 

--- 
| | 

|


the purpose of such estimate only, Closing Net Working Capital and Target Net
Working Capital are equal.

(b) As promptly as practicable after the Closing, but in no event later than
90 days after the Closing Date, the Buyers shall prepare and deliver to the
Sellers a statement setting forth the Buyers' calculation of the Closing Cash
Proceeds, including each of the components thereof (the "Closing Statement"),
and a consolidated balance sheet of the Company Group and its Subsidiaries as
of 11:59 p.m. in the applicable time zone on the calendar day immediately
prior to the Closing Date (the "Closing Balance Sheet").

(c) The Estimated Closing Cash Proceeds, the Closing Statement and the Closing
Balance Sheet shall (i) be prepared, and each component thereof shall be
determined, in accordance with (1) the accounting methods, policies,
practices, procedures, conventions, categorizations, definitions, principles,
judgments, assumptions, techniques or estimation methods with respect to
financial statements, their classification or presentation or otherwise
(including with respect to the nature of accounts, level of reserves or level
of accruals) that are consistent with the calculation of the Target Net
Working Capital as set forth on Schedule III, (2) to the extent not
inconsistent with the immediately foregoing clause (1), accounting methods,
policies, practices, procedures, conventions, categorizations, definitions,
principles, judgments, assumptions, techniques or estimation methods with
respect to financial statements, their classification or presentation or
otherwise (including with respect to the nature of accounts, level of reserves
or level of accruals) adopted in connection with the Latest Balance Sheet so
long as consistent with GAAP as in effect as of the preparation of the Latest
Balance Sheet consistently applied, and (3) to the extent not inconsistent
with the immediately foregoing clauses (1) or (2), GAAP as in effect on the
Closing Date consistently applied and (ii) not include any changes in assets
or liabilities as a result of purchase accounting adjustments or other changes
arising from or resulting as a consequence of the transactions contemplated
hereby (the immediately foregoing clauses (i) and (ii) collectively, the
"Accounting Methods").

(d) The post-Closing adjustment procedures as set forth in this Section 2.3
are not intended to permit the introduction of different or additional
accounting methods, policies, practices, procedures, conventions,
categorizations, definitions, principles, judgments, assumptions, techniques
or estimation methods with respect to the financial statements, their
classification or presentation or otherwise (including with respect to the
nature of accounts, level of reserves or level of accruals) from the
Accounting Methods, it being the intent of the Parties that the Closing Net
Working Capital be calculated consistently with the Target Net Working Capital
in order to allow a meaningful comparison of the Closing Net Working Capital
to the Target Net Working Capital.

(e) The Buyers shall, and shall cause the Company Group and its Subsidiaries
to, provide reasonable assistance to the Sellers and their representatives in
the review of the Closing Statement and the Closing Balance Sheet (including
by furnishing on a timely basis all information reasonably necessary or useful
in connection with such review or providing customary certifications to the
Sellers or, if requested, to the Sellers' auditors or the Accounting Firm) and
shall provide the Sellers and their representatives reasonable access during
normal business hours to the books, records (including work papers, schedules,
memoranda and other documents), supporting data, facilities and relevant
personnel of the Company Group, its Subsidiaries and the Buyers (including
personnel responsible for accounting and finance, senior management and
accountants and advisors) for purposes of their review of the Closing
Statement and the Closing Balance Sheet, so long as such access does not
disrupt the operation of the Company Group's businesses. If the Sellers
disagree with any part of the Buyers' calculation of the Closing Cash Proceeds
as set forth on the Closing Statement or the Closing Balance Sheet, the
Sellers shall, within 45 days after the Sellers' receipt of the Closing
Statement and the Closing Balance Sheet, notify the Buyers in writing of such
disagreement by setting forth the Sellers' calculation of the Closing Cash
Proceeds, including each of the components thereof, and describing in
reasonable detail the basis for




 

--- 
| | 

|


such disagreement (an "Objection Notice"). If the Sellers do not deliver an
Objection Notice within the time period specified above, then the Buyers
determination of Closing Cash Proceeds, as set forth in its Closing Statement,
will be deemed to have been accepted by the Sellers and shall be final and
binding on all Parties. If an Objection Notice is delivered to the Buyers,
then the Buyers and the Sellers shall negotiate in good faith to resolve their
disagreements with respect to the computation of the Closing Cash Proceeds. In
the event that the Buyers and the Sellers are unable to resolve all such
disagreements within 45 days after the Buyers' receipt of such Objection
Notice (or such longer period as the Buyers and the Sellers may agree in
writing), the Buyers and the Sellers shall submit such remaining disagreements
to PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP (or, if PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP is unable or
unwilling to act, Deloitte LLP (the "Accounting Firm"), or, if the Accounting
Firm is unwilling to serve, another nationally-recognized accounting firm that
is mutually acceptable to the Buyers and the Sellers (such other accounting
firm selected to serve shall also be deemed the Accounting Firm for all
relevant purposes).

(f) The Accounting Firm shall make a final and binding determination with
respect to the computation of the Closing Cash Proceeds, including each of the
components thereof, to the extent such amounts are in dispute, in accordance
with the guidelines and procedures set forth in this Agreement and on Exhibit
C. The Buyers and the Sellers shall cooperate with the Accounting Firm during
the term of its engagement and shall use reasonable best efforts to cause the
Accounting Firm to resolve all remaining disagreements with respect to the
computation of the Closing Cash Proceeds, including each of the components
thereof, as soon as practicable. The Accounting Firm shall consider only those
items and amounts in the Buyers' and the Sellers' respective calculations of
the Closing Cash Proceeds as set forth in Buyers' Closing Statement and in
Sellers' Objection Notice, including each of the components thereof, that are
identified as being items and amounts to which the Buyers and the Sellers have
been unable to agree. In resolving any disputed item, the Accounting Firm may
not assign a value to any item greater than the greatest value for such item
claimed by either Party or less than the smallest value for such item claimed
by either Party, in each case as set forth in Buyers' Closing Statement and in
Sellers' Objection Notice, as applicable. The Accounting Firm's determination
of the Closing Cash Proceeds, including each of the components thereof, shall
be based solely on written materials submitted by the Buyers and the Sellers
(i.e., not on independent review) and on the definitions, terms and conditions
included herein. The determination of the Accounting Firm shall be conclusive
and binding upon the Parties and shall not be subject to appeal or further
review.

(g) The costs and expenses of the Accounting Firm in determining the Closing
Cash Proceeds, including each of the components thereof, shall be borne by the
Buyers, on the one hand, and the Sellers, on the other hand, based upon the
percentage that the portion of the contested amount not awarded to each Party
bears to the amount actually contested by such Party. For example, if the
Buyers claim the Closing Cash Proceeds are $1,000 less than the Estimated
Closing Cash Proceeds, and the Sellers contest only $500 of the amount claimed
by the Buyers, and if the Accounting Firm ultimately resolves the dispute by
awarding the Buyers $300 of the $500 contested, then the costs and expenses of
the Accounting Firm will be allocated 60% (i.e., 300 ÷ 500) to the Sellers and
40% (i.e., 200 ÷ 500) to the Buyers. Prior to the Accounting Firm's
determination of Closing Cash Proceeds, (i) the Buyers, on the one hand, and
the Sellers, on the other hand, will each pay 50% of any retainer paid to the
Accounting Firm; and (ii) during the engagement of the Accounting Firm, the
Accounting Firm will bill 50% of the total charges to each of the Buyers, on
the one hand, and the Sellers, on the other hand. In connection with the
Accounting Firm's determination of the Closing Cash Proceeds, the Accounting
Firm shall also determine, pursuant to the terms of the first and second
sentences of this Section 2.3(g), and taking into account all fees and
expenses already paid by each of the Buyers, on the one hand, and the Sellers,
on the other hand, as of the date of such determination, the allocation of its
fees and expenses between the Buyers and the Sellers, which such determination
shall be conclusive and binding upon the Parties.

(h) Within five Business Days after the Closing Cash Proceeds, including each
of the components thereof, are finally determined pursuant to this Section
2.3:

(i) If the Closing Cash Proceeds are greater than the Estimated Closing Cash
Proceeds, the Buyers shall promptly (but in any event within five Business
Days after the determination thereof) deliver to the Sellers the amount of
such excess by wire transfer of immediately available funds to an account or
accounts designated by the Sellers. Immediately following payment of any
amounts determined pursuant to this Section 2.3(h)(i) to be owing to the
Sellers, the Sellers and the Buyers shall deliver joint instructions to the
Escrow Agent instructing the Escrow Agent to pay to the Sellers all remaining
funds in the Purchase Price Escrow Account, in accordance with the terms of
the Escrow Agreement.

(ii) If the Closing Cash Proceeds are less than the Estimated Closing Cash
Proceeds (such shortfall, the "Purchase Price Shortfall"), the Sellers and the
Buyers shall promptly (but in any event within five Business Days after the
determination of the Closing Cash Proceeds) deliver joint instructions to the
Escrow Agent instructing the Escrow Agent to pay from the Purchase Price
Escrow Account to an account or accounts designated by the Buyers an amount
equal to the Purchase Price Shortfall by wire transfer of immediately
available funds. Immediately following payment of any amounts determined
pursuant to this Section 2.3(h)(ii) to be owing to the Buyers, the Sellers and
the Buyers shall, if applicable, deliver joint instructions to the Escrow
Agent instructing the Escrow Agent to pay to the Sellers all remaining funds
in the Purchase Price Escrow Account, in accordance with the terms of the
Escrow Agreement. In the event the Purchase Price Shortfall amount is greater
than the amounts in the Purchase Price Escrow Account (such amount, the
"Purchase Price Escrow Deficiency Amount"), in addition to issuing the
instructions contemplated above for payment out of the Purchase Price Escrow
Account, Sellers shall within five Business Days after the determination of
the Closing Cash Proceeds pay to the Buyers the amount of the Purchase Price
Escrow Deficiency Amount by wire transfer of immediately available funds to an
account or accounts designated by the Buyers.

(iii) For purposes of determining whether the Closing Cash Proceeds are
greater or less than the Estimated Closing Cash Proceeds under this Section
2.3(h), amounts in currencies other than dollars (including with respect to
Closing Net Working Capital) shall be converted into dollars at the applicable
exchange rate as of the close of the Business Day on the day on which the
Closing Cash Proceeds are finally determined pursuant to this Section 2.3.

(i) All payments or adjustments pursuant to Section 2.2(b)(iii) and this
Section 2.3, other than payments of stated interest, shall be treated by all
Parties for Tax purposes as adjustments to the Aggregate Purchase Price.

amounts required to pay their respective debts (including a reasonable
estimate of the amount of all contingent Liabilities), and (b) the assets of
each of the Buyers, the Company Group and each of its Subsidiaries, in each
case at a fair valuation, will exceed its respective debts (including the
probable amount of all contingent Liabilities). Immediately after giving
effect to the transactions contemplated by this Agreement (including the
financings to be undertaken in connection therewith), and assuming the

state securities Laws. Buyers have been advised and understands that the
Shares have not been registered under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended
(the "Securities Act"), on the grounds that no distribution or public offering
of the Shares is to be effected, and that in this connection, Sellers are
relying in part on the representations of the Buyers set forth in this
Agreement. Buyers has been further advised and understands that no public
market now exists for the Shares or any of the other securities issued by the
Company Group or its Subsidiaries and that a public market may never exist for
the Shares. Each Buyer is an "Accredited Investor" (as such term is defined in
Rule 501 of Regulation D of the Securities Act). Buyers acknowledge and agree
that the Shares acquired hereunder may not be sold, transferred, offered for
sale, pledged, hypothecated or otherwise disposed of without registration
under applicable securities Laws, except pursuant to an exemption from such
registration. The Buyers (either alone or together with its advisors) have
sufficient knowledge and experience in financial and business matters so as to
be capable of evaluating the merits and risks of its investment in the Shares
and is capable of bearing the economic risks of such investment.

(c) by the Sellers, if there has been a material misrepresentation or a
material breach of warranty or a material breach of a covenant by the Buyers
in the representations and warranties or covenants set forth in this Agreement
(which in the case of any breach which is curable has not been cured within 20
Business Days after written notification thereof by the Sellers to the
Buyers), such that the conditions set forth in Article III would not be
satisfied; provided that the Sellers shall not be entitled to terminate this
Agreement pursuant to this Section 8.1(c) if either Seller is then in material
breach of this Agreement;

(d) by the Buyers, upon ten Business Days' prior written notice if the Closing
shall not have occurred by August 31, 2017 (the "End Date"); provided that the

on the part of any Party, (i) other than Liabilities and obligations under the
Confidentiality Agreement and (ii) except that no such termination shall
relieve the Parties from any Liability for Losses resulting from any knowing
and intentional breach of this Agreement. For purposes of clarification, the
Parties agree that if all of the Closing conditions set forth in Article III
have been satisfied or, if for the benefit of the Sellers, waived by the
Sellers (other than those conditions that by their nature are to be satisfied
at the Closing) but the Buyers fail to complete the Closing within three
Business Days following the date the Closing should have occurred pursuant to
Section 2.2(a), such failure or refusal to close shall be deemed to be a
knowing and intentional breach of this Agreement by the Buyers.

(b) For the avoidance of doubt and without limiting the rights of the Sellers
under this Section 8.2, for all purposes of this Agreement, the failure of the
Buyers or Sellers to consummate the Closing when required shall be a breach of
this Agreement by that Party that is knowing and intentional, that is not
capable of being cured, that has prevented consummation of the Closing and the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement (including, for the avoidance of
doubt, if such failure results from the Buyers being unable to obtain all or
any portion of the financing required) and that gives rise to the a Party's
termination right pursuant to Section 8.1.

have been required to have been disclosed pursuant to Section 5.4, Section

advisable to obtain such consents, approvals and waivers. The foregoing is not
intended to expand or modify the provisions of Section 2.2(a) regarding
deliverables at the Closing or of Article III regarding conditions precedent
to the Closing.

9.8 Tax Matters.

(a) Pre-Closing Tax Refunds or Prepayments. Any refunds of Taxes (net of any
Taxes payable by a Buyer Indemnified Party in respect of such refunds or that
would have been payable in the absence of use of a loss or credit from a tax
period that is not a Pre-Closing Tax Period) with respect to any Pre-Closing
Tax Period that are received by the Company Group or its Subsidiaries after
the Closing Date, to the extent such refunds did not arise as a result of
carry back of a loss or credit from a tax period that is not a Pre-Closing Tax
Period, or any use of prepayments of Taxes made prior to the Closing to reduce
or offset Taxes payable with respect to tax periods that begin after the
Closing or Taxes in respect of a Straddle Period that pursuant to Section
9.8(b)(ii) are allocated to the Buyers (any such refund or reduction, a "Pre-
Closing Tax Refund"), shall be for the account of the Sellers, and the Buyers
shall pay over to the Sellers any such Pre-Closing Tax Refund within 15 days
after receipt or application thereof, less any costs and expenses incurred by
the Buyers, the Company Group and their Affiliates in connection with
obtaining and receiving or applying any such Pre-Closing Tax Refund. Any
amounts paid pursuant to this Section 9.8(a) shall be treated by all Parties
for Tax purposes as adjustments to the Transaction Price. The Buyers
reasonably shall cooperate with the Sellers in obtaining such refunds or using
such prepayments to reduce Taxes.

(b) Preparation and Filing of Tax Returns.

(i) The Sellers shall cause the Company Group to prepare and timely file all
Tax Returns of the Company Group or any of its Subsidiaries required to be
filed (taking into account extensions) prior to the Closing Date. The Sellers
shall prepare, or cause to be prepared, any and all income Tax Returns of the
Company Group and its Subsidiaries, filed or required to be filed after the

Closing Date ("Pre-Closing Income Tax Returns"). The Sellers shall promptly
pay over to the Buyers any Taxes shown as owing on such Pre-Closing Income Tax
Return. The Buyers shall cooperate with the Sellers to effect the filing of
each such Pre-Closing Income Tax Return on a timely basis and will cause the
Company Group or applicable Subsidiary, as the case may be, to timely remit
any Taxes shown as owing on such Pre-Closing




 

--- 
| | 

|


Income Tax Return upon receipt by the Buyers of the amount of such remittance
pursuant to the immediately preceding sentence. The Sellers shall (A) prepare
such Pre-Closing Income Tax Returns in a manner consistent with the past
practices of the Company Group and its Subsidiaries to the maximum extent
allowable under Law, provided that the Transaction Tax Deductions shall be
allocated to the taxable period ending on the Closing Date to the maximum
extent allowable by Law, (B) deliver a draft of any such Pre-Closing Income
Tax Return, no later than 30 days prior to the due date for filing such Pre-
Closing Income Tax Return, to the Buyers for its review and comment, and
reasonably and in good faith consider the comments of the Buyers in the course
of finalizing such Pre-Closing Income Tax Returns. The Sellers shall not file
such Pre-Closing Tax Return without the prior written consent of the Buyers,
which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld, delayed or conditioned. The
Buyers shall prepare and timely file, or cause to be prepared and timely
filed, any and all Tax Returns of the Company Group and its Subsidiaries,
including Tax Returns for Straddle Periods, filed or required to be filed
after the Closing Date other than the Pre-Closing Income Tax Returns;
provided, however, that with respect to any such Tax Returns relating to a
Pre-Closing Tax Period: (x) the Buyers shall prepare such Tax Returns in a
manner consistent with the past practices of the Company Group to the maximum
extent allowable under Law, (y) the Buyers shall deliver a draft of any such
Tax Return, no later than 15 days prior to the due date for filing such Tax
Return to the Sellers for its review and comment, and (z) the Buyers shall not
file such Tax Returns without the prior written consent of the Sellers, which
consent shall not be unreasonably withheld, delayed or conditioned. The
Sellers shall promptly pay over to the Buyers any Taxes shown as owing on such
Tax Returns for Straddle Periods in connection with the Pre-Closing Tax Period
(as determined in accordance with the Straddle Period allocation principles
set forth in Section 9.8(b)(ii)) within 15 days after the finalization of such
Tax Returns. None of the Buyers or any of their Affiliates shall (or shall
cause or permit any other Person to) (A) except as otherwise provided in this
Section 9.8, amend, re file or otherwise modify any Tax Return relating in
whole or in part to the Company Group or any of its Subsidiaries with respect
to any Pre-Closing Tax Period (or portion thereof); (B) make any Tax election
that has retroactive effect to any Pre-Closing Tax Period (or portion
thereof); (C) file any ruling or request with any taxing authority that
relates to Taxes or Tax Returns of the Company Group or any of its
Subsidiaries for a Pre-Closing Tax Period (or portion thereof); or (D) enter
into or initiate any voluntary disclosure agreement or procedure with any
taxing authority regarding any Tax or Tax Returns of the Company Group or any
of its Subsidiaries for a Pre-Closing Tax Period, in each case, without the
prior written consent of the Sellers, not to be unreasonably withheld,
conditioned or delayed.

(ii) To the extent it is necessary for purposes of this Agreement to determine
the allocation of Taxes among any Straddle Period, the amount of any Taxes
other than property or similar ad valorem Taxes for the Pre-Closing Tax Period
shall be determined based on an interim closing of the books as of the close
of business on the Closing Date and the amount of property or similar ad
valorem Taxes for a Straddle Period which relates to the Pre-Closing Tax
Period shall be deemed to be the amount of such Tax for the entire taxable
period multiplied by a fraction the numerator of which is the number of days
in the taxable period ending on the Closing Date and the denominator of which
is the number of days in such Straddle Period.

(c) Cooperation. Each of the Buyers and the Sellers shall cooperate, as
reasonably requested by any other such party, in connection with the filing of
Tax Returns and any audit, litigation or other proceeding with respect to
Taxes. Such cooperation shall include the retention and (upon another Party's
request) the provision of records and information that are reasonably relevant
to any such audit, litigation or other proceeding and making employees
available on a mutually convenient basis to provide additional information and
explanation of any material provided hereunder. The Buyers shall cause the
Company Group to furnish any Tax information requested by the Sellers for
inclusion in the Sellers' consolidated, combined or similar income Tax Returns
for a Pre-Closing Tax Period, to the extent such information is reasonably
relevant to the preparation and filing of such Tax Returns.

|


(d) Tax Sharing Agreements. All Tax sharing agreements or similar arrangements
with respect to or involving the Company Group or its Subsidiaries (other than
any agreement entered into in the Ordinary Course of Business and not
primarily concerning Taxes) shall be terminated prior to the Closing Date and,
after the Closing Date, neither the Company Group nor any of its Subsidiaries
shall be bound thereby or have any Liability thereunder for amounts due in
respect of periods ending on or before the Closing Date.

(e) Certain Post-Closing Actions. The Buyers agrees to indemnify the Sellers
for any additional Tax owed by the Sellers (or any consolidated, combined, or
similar group of which the Sellers is a member), including by virtue of any
indemnification obligation hereunder, resulting from any transaction engaged
in by the Company Group or its Subsidiaries not in the Ordinary Course of
Business occurring on the Closing Date after the Closing.

(f) Transfer Taxes. All transfer, documentary, sales, use, value added, goods
and services, stamp, registration, and similar Taxes arising in connection
with or as a result of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement
("Transfer Taxes") shall be borne and paid one-half by Buyers and one-half by
Seller, except that (i) the GST/HST and value added taxes, to the extent
recoverable, shall be paid by the Buyers, and (ii) the Buyers shall be liable
for any Transfer Taxes that arise if the Buyers use a Finnish entity to
acquire the VKOY Shares. The Party required to do so under Law shall properly
prepare and timely file all Tax Returns with respect to such Taxes. Any
obligation to reimburse a Party for a share of Transfer Taxes to be borne by a
reimbursing Party shall be paid promptly on demand. For greater certainty,
neither IPCo nor Kadant US is registered for GST/HST purposes and since Kadant
US is a non-resident of Canada for purposes of the Excise Tax Act (Canada),
IPCo will not charge any amount on account of GST/HST to Kadant US on the sale
of the VFR Patent Assets.

(g) Allocation. The Parties hereby confirm that 100% of the Aggregate Purchase
Price, as adjusted under this Agreement, constitutes consideration for the
purchase and sale of the Shares and the VFR Patent Asses hereunder. The
Parties acknowledge and agree that the Buyers' purchase of the NMC Shares and
the VKNA Shares from NII pursuant to this Agreement shall, in accordance with
Treasury Regulations Section 1.1361-5(b)(3), Example 9, be treated for U.S.
federal and applicable state income Tax purposes as a sale by NII of the
assets of NMC and VKNA to the applicable Buyer, followed by a transfer of such
assets by the Buyers to a new corporation. Accordingly, the portion of the
Aggregate Purchase Price allocable to the NMC Shares and the VKNA Shares (the
"QSub Price") shall be allocated among the respective assets of NMC and VKNA
in accordance with Section 1060 of the Code and the principles set forth in
Section 9.8 of the Disclosure Schedules (the "Allocation Principles"). Within
90 days after the Closing Date, the Buyers shall prepare and deliver to the
Sellers a written allocation (the "Tax Allocation Statement") of the QSub
Price (as determined for U.S. federal income tax purposes) among the assets of
NMC and VKNA in accordance with Section 1060 of the Code. If the Sellers
disagree with the Tax Allocation Statement, the Sellers shall notify the
Buyers in writing of such disagreement within 30 days after delivery by the
Buyers to the Sellers of the Tax Allocation Statement. The Buyers and the
Sellers shall negotiate in good faith to resolve any dispute regarding the Tax
Allocation Statement and any such resolution agreed to in writing by the
Buyers and the Sellers shall be final and binding upon the Parties for
purposes of this Section 9.8(g). If the Buyers and the Sellers are unable to
resolve any dispute regarding the Tax Allocation Statement, then each of the
Buyers and the Sellers may file applicable Tax Returns in whichever manner
that each decides with respect to the allocation referred to in the Tax
Allocation Statement. In the event that, pursuant to the tax allocation
process set forth in this Section 9.8(g), the Buyers allocate more than
$500,000 of the Aggregate Purchase Price to any non-compete, non-solicitation
or similar covenants, the Buyers shall indemnify the Sellers for any
incremental Tax costs that are incurred by the Sellers or their direct or
indirect shareholders, on a grossed up basis, as a result of such allocation
in excess of $500,000. Any such indemnity shall be treated for Tax purposes as
an adjustment to the Aggregate Purchase Price.

(h) Tax Elections.

(i) At the request of any Party and to the extent permitted by the Income Tax
Act (Canada), the applicable Parties shall make and file any election or
amended election in prescribed form (or such other form as may be reasonably
requested) and within the prescribed time limits pursuant to section 56.4 of
the Income Tax Act (Canada) and any analogous provision of provincial or
territorial Tax legislation.

(ii) At the request of a Seller but not otherwise, NML shall make an election
pursuant to subsection 256(9) of the Income Tax Act (Canada) in respect of the
taxation year of NML ending immediately prior to the acquisition of control of
NML by Kadant Canada; provided that NML shall not be required to make such
election where NML has entered into any transaction not in the Ordinary Course
of Business on the Closing Date prior to the Closing.

9.9 Confidentiality.

(a) From and after the Closing Date, the Sellers will not and will cause their
respective Affiliates not to, directly or indirectly, disclose, reveal,
divulge or communicate to any Person other than authorized officers, directors
and employees of the Buyers or the Company Group or any of its Subsidiaries or
use or otherwise exploit for its own benefit or for the benefit of anyone
other than the Company Group or the Buyers any Confidential Information,
provided that the foregoing shall not be deemed to prevent the Sellers from
using the Confidential Information to enforce its rights hereunder. The
Sellers and their respective Affiliates will not have any obligation to keep
confidential any Confidential Information if and to the extent disclosure
thereof is specifically required by Law; provided that in the event disclosure
is required by Law, the Sellers will provide the Company Group with prompt
notice of such requirement prior to making any disclosure so that the Company
Group may seek an appropriate protective order. "Confidential Information"
means any information with respect to the Company Group and its Subsidiaries,
including methods of operation, customers, customer lists, products, prices,
fees, costs, technology, inventions, Trade Secrets, know-how, software,
marketing methods, plans, personnel, suppliers, competitors, markets, or other
specialized information or proprietary matters. Confidential Information does
not include, and there will be no obligation hereunder with respect to,
information that (i) is generally available to the public on the date of this
Agreement or (ii) becomes generally available to the public other than as a
result of a disclosure not otherwise permissible hereunder.

(b) The covenants and undertakings contained in this Section 9.9 relate to
matters that are of a special, unique, and extraordinary character and a
violation of which will cause irreparable injury to the Buyers and the Company
Group and its Subsidiaries, the amount of which will be impossible to estimate
or determine and that cannot be adequately compensated. Accordingly, the
remedy at law for any breach of this Section 9.9 will be inadequate.
Therefore, in addition to seeking damages, Buyers will be entitled to an
injunction, restraining order, or other equitable relief from any court of
competent jurisdiction in the event of any breach of this Section 9.9. The
rights and remedies provided by this Section 9.9 are cumulative and in
addition to any other rights and remedies that Buyers, the Company Group or
its Subsidiaries may have under this Agreement or at law or in equity.

9.10 Kadant Parent Guarantee. Kadant Parent hereby irrevocably, absolutely and
unconditionally guarantees payment and performance by the Buyers of their

nonperformance, protest, notice of protest or notice of dishonor to Kadant

other defense of the Buyers or any other Person (other than defenses available
to the Buyers under this Agreement), (ii) any lack of authority of the Buyers
or any Person acting or purporting to act on behalf of the Buyers, or (iii)
any amendment, modification, extension or termination of this Agreement,
including the time of payment or other terms of the obligations of the Buyers.
Kadant Parent has duly executed this Agreement and acknowledges that the
Sellers are relying upon the guarantee contained in this Section 9.10 in
connection with this Agreement. This Section 9.10 will continue in full force
and effect until the satisfaction of all of Buyers' obligations under this
Agreement that are guaranteed by Kadant Parent, and will be binding on any
successor or assignee of Kadant Parent, and may be enforced by Sellers against
Kadant Parent notwithstanding the transfer or other disposition of the Buyers.



9.11 Seller Guarantors Guarantee. Each Seller Guarantor hereby irrevocably,
absolutely and unconditionally guarantees payment and performance by the
Sellers of their obligations under this Agreement in accordance with the terms
and conditions hereof. This is a guarantee of payment and not collection. Each
Seller Guarantor waives (a) any rights it may have to require that the Buyers
(i) pursue any remedy against the Sellers, any Person or any security, (ii)
make any presentment or demand to it for performance, or give any notice of
nonperformance, protest, notice of protest or notice of dishonor to it, or
(iii) provide any information it may have relating to the financial condition
of the Sellers, and (b) any defense to its guarantee obligations arising by
reason of (i) any disability or other defense of the Sellers or any other
Person (other than defenses available to the Sellers under this Agreement),
(ii) any lack of authority of the Sellers or any Person acting or purporting
to act on behalf of the Sellers, or (iii) any amendment, modification,
extension or termination of this Agreement, including the time of payment or
other terms of the obligations of the Sellers. Each Seller Guarantor has duly
executed this Agreement and acknowledges that the Buyers are relying upon the
guarantee contained in this Section 9.11 in connection with this Agreement.
This Section 9.11 will continue in full force and effect until the
satisfaction of all of Sellers' obligations under this Agreement that are
guaranteed by the Seller Guarantors, and will be binding on any successor or
assignee of either Seller Guarantor, and may be enforced by Buyers against
each Seller Guarantor notwithstanding the transfer or other disposition of the
Sellers.

9.12 Use of "Nicholson" Name. From and after the Closing, the Sellers covenant
and agree that they shall cause Nicholson Machine and Technology Co. not use the
name "Nicholson" for commercial purposes in connection with forest products.

9.13 Cooperation. From and after the Closing, the Sellers shall, and shall
cause their Affiliates to, use commercially reasonable efforts to cooperate
with the Buyers and Kadant Parent and their advisors, KPMG LLP and Duff and
Phelps Corp., in the preparation of the audited consolidated financial
statements of the Company Group and its Subsidiaries for the year ended
September 30, 2016 (and, if required by the Buyers, for the year ended
September 30, 2015) and the valuation report prepared in connection therewith.

10.1 Indemnification of the Buyer Indemnified Parties.

(a) From and after the Closing, subject to, and in accordance with, the
provisions of this Article X, the Sellers shall, on a joint and several basis,
indemnify the Buyers and their Affiliates and the Buyers' and their
Affiliates' respective officers, directors, employees or agents (collectively,
the "Buyer Indemnified Parties") against, and hold them harmless from, any and
all losses, Liabilities, Taxes, fines, interest, penalties, judgments,
deficiencies, awards, assessments, amounts paid in settlement, damages, costs
or expenses (in each case, including costs of investigation and defense and
reasonable legal and accountants' fees and expenses) ("Losses") actually
suffered or incurred by any of the Buyer Indemnified

|


Parties to the extent arising from (i) any breach of, or any misrepresentation
with respect to, any representations and warranties of the Sellers set forth
in Article V; (ii) any breach of, or any misrepresentation with respect to,
any representations and warranties of the Sellers set forth in Article VI;
(iii) any breach or violation of any covenant or agreement of the Sellers
contained in this Agreement (to the extent such covenant or agreement is to be
performed prior to the Closing); (iv) any breach or violation of any covenant
or agreement of the Sellers (to the extent such covenant or agreement is to be
performed after Closing and is independent of the indemnification obligations
of this Section 10.1(a)); (v) any claim or demand made by any Person related
to any matter, circumstance or default existing at or prior to the Closing
Date in respect of the VFR Patent Assets; (vi) any Taxes of the Company Group
or any of its Subsidiaries for any Pre-Closing Tax Period and the pre-closing
portion of any Straddle Period, to the extent the Liability for any such Tax
is in excess of amounts pre-paid prior to the Closing for such Tax; (vii) the
sale of all the shares in the limited liability housing company Lohjan
Valontalo (Fi.: As Oy Lohjan Valontalo) executed based on the agreement
entered into between VKOY as seller and Mr. Ari Lemberg and Mr. Jari Linden as
buyers on January 12, 2017; (viii) any Tax Liabilities with respect to NI or
any of its Affiliates for any open Tax period prior to NI being classified as
an S corporation; or (ix) any Tax costs (net of any corresponding Tax credits
or deductions) in connection with the payment or settlement by the Buyers, the
Company Group or any of its Subsidiaries of any and all Indebtedness,
receivables, payables and other amounts owing between or among entities that
are part of the Company Group and its Subsidiaries that were not paid or
settled prior to the Closing pursuant to Section 3.2(m) and that are paid or
settled with the 90 days after the Closing Date, to the extent that such
payment or settlement is effected in a manner that is consistent with the past
practice of the Company Group and its Subsidiaries and otherwise in a way that
reasonably endeavors to limit additional Tax costs; provided that the Buyer
Indemnified Parties' right to assert claims pursuant to this Section 10.1(a)
shall be subject to the limitations set forth in in Section 10.1(b) and
Section 10.7 and provided further that "Losses" shall not include, and the
Buyer Indemnified Parties shall not be entitled to seek or recover from the
Sellers under any theory of Liability, any special or punitive losses,
Liabilities or damages, except to the extent recoverable from the Buyer
Indemnified Parties pursuant to a Third Party Claim.

(b) The Buyer Indemnified Parties' right to assert claims pursuant to this
Section 10.1 (other than in respect of Section 10.1(a)(iv), Section
10.1(a)(vi), Section 10.1(a)(vii), Section 10.1(a)(viii) or Section
10.1(a)(ix)) shall, except as provided at Section 10.1(c), be subject to the
following limitations:

(i) the Buyer Indemnified Parties shall not be entitled to recover under
Section 10.1(a) for an individual claim or group of substantially related
claims with respect to any Losses unless and until the amount of Losses that
the Buyer Indemnified Parties would otherwise recover pursuant to Section
10.1(a) with respect to such claim or group of substantially related claims
exceeds $15,000 (the "Per Claim Threshold"), at which point the Buyer
Indemnified Parties shall be entitled to recover for the full amounts of such
claims, including amounts below the Per Claim Threshold;

(ii) the Buyer Indemnified Parties shall not be entitled to recover under
Section 10.1(a) until the total amount which the Buyer Indemnified Parties
would otherwise recover pursuant to Section 10.1(a) (but for this Section
10.1(b)(ii)) exceeds on a cumulative basis an amount equal to $800,000 (the
"Deductible"), and then the Buyer Indemnified Parties shall be entitled to
recover only for the excess over the Deductible, it being understood that the
portion of the amount of any individual claims or group of related claims less
than the Per Claim Threshold shall be ignored in determining whether the
Deductible has been exceeded;

(iii) the Buyer Indemnified Parties shall not be entitled to recover under
Section 10.1(a) an aggregate amount in excess of $13,125,000 (the "Cap");

(iv) in the event of any breach, violation or misrepresentation giving rise to
an indemnification obligation under this Section 10.1 or otherwise in
connection with the transactions




 

--- 
| | 

|


contemplated hereby, to the extent required by Law, the Buyers and the
Indemnified Party(ies) shall take, and shall cause their respective
Subsidiaries to take, reasonable measures to mitigate the Losses arising from
such breach, violation or misrepresentation (including taking steps to prevent
any contingent Liability from becoming an actual Liability). If such
mitigation takes effect after the Indemnifying Party has paid the Indemnified
Party under any indemnification provision of this Agreement in respect of that
Loss, the Indemnified Party must notify the Indemnifying Party and pay to the
Indemnifying Party the extent of the value of the benefit to the Indemnified
Party of that mitigation (less the Indemnified Party's reasonable costs of
mitigation) within 10 Business Days after the benefit is received;

(v) for the avoidance of doubt, except to the extent constituting fraud, no
breach of any representation, warranty, covenant or agreement contained herein
shall give rise to any right on the part of the Buyers, after the Closing, to
rescind this Agreement or any of the transactions contemplated hereby; and

(vi) solely for purposes of determining the amount of Losses arising out of or
resulting from a breach or inaccuracy of any representation or warranty in
this Agreement, all qualifications or exceptions in any representation or
warranty referring to the terms "material," "materially," "in all material
respects," or "Material Adverse Effect" shall be disregarded; provided that
the materiality qualifiers in the defined term "Material Adverse Effect" and
"Material Contracts" will not be disregarded.

(c) The limitations set forth in Sections 10.1(b)(i), (ii), and (iii) will not
apply to a breach or inaccuracy of the Fundamental Representations, to Section
5.6, Section 5.7 or Section 6.15 or to Losses arising out of fraud in
connection with the transactions contemplated by this Agreement; provided,
however, that the Buyer Indemnified Parties shall not be entitled to recover
for a breach or inaccuracy of the Fundamental Representations or Section 5.6,
Section 5.7 or Section 6.15 or pursuant to Section 10.1(a)(vi), Section
10.1(a)(viii) or Section 10.1(a)(ix) that, when combined with any other
recoveries in respect of Sections 10.1(a)(i), (ii) and (iii), is in an
aggregate amount in excess of the Transaction Price.

10.2 Exclusive Remedy. From and after the Closing, the Buyer Indemnified
Parties' sole and exclusive remedy in respect of monetary damages against the
Sellers and their Related Parties, whether in any individual, corporate or any
other capacity, with respect to any and all claims (other than proven claims
for fraud) relating (directly or indirectly) to this Agreement or the
transactions contemplated hereby, regardless of the legal theory under which
such Liability or obligation may be sought to be imposed, whether sounding in
contract or tort, or whether at law or in equity, or otherwise, shall be
pursuant to the provisions of this Article X, provided that the foregoing
shall not limit the recourse of the Buyer Indemnified Parties pursuant to
Section 9.9(a) or in respect of the Non-Competition and Non-Solicitation
Agreements. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this
Agreement, in order to avoid double-counting, the Buyer Indemnified Parties
shall have no right to indemnification under Section 10.1 with respect to any
Loss or alleged Loss to the extent such Loss or alleged Loss is included in
the Company Group Transaction Expenses paid at the Closing or the calculation
of Closing Indebtedness or Closing Net Working Capital or is properly accrued,
reserved or otherwise reflected on the Latest Balance Sheet. The provisions in
this Agreement relating to indemnification, and the limits imposed on the
Buyer Indemnified Parties' remedies with respect to this Agreement and the
transactions contemplated hereby (including Section 10.1 and this Section
10.2), were specifically bargained for between sophisticated parties and were
specifically taken into account in the determination of the amounts to be paid
to the Sellers hereunder. No Buyer Indemnified Party may avoid the limitations
on Liability set forth in this Article X by seeking damages for breach of
contract, tort or pursuant to any other theory of Liability. Nothing in this
Section 10.2 shall limit the rights of the Sellers or the Buyers to obtain
specific performance of the other Parties' obligations hereunder in accordance
with Section 11.13 or its recourse in respect of fraud.

10.3 Indemnification of the Seller Indemnified Parties. From and after the
Closing, subject to, and in accordance with, the provisions of this Article X,
the Buyers shall, on a joint and several basis, indemnify the Sellers and
their Affiliates and the Sellers' and their Affiliates' respective officers,
directors, employees or agents (collectively, the "Seller Indemnified
Parties"), against, and hold them harmless from, any and all Losses actually
suffered or incurred by any of the Seller Indemnified Parties to the extent
arising from (a) any breach of, or any misrepresentation with respect to, any
representations and warranties of the Buyers set forth in Article VII (to the
extent related to any covenant or agreement of the Buyers to be performed
after the Closing); or (b) any breach or violation of any covenant or
agreement of the Buyers contained in this Agreement, in each case, to the
extent such covenant or agreement is to be performed after the Closing.

10.4 Termination of Indemnification. The obligations to indemnify and hold
harmless a Person in respect of a breach of representation or warranty or
covenant shall terminate when the applicable representation or warranty or
covenant terminates pursuant to Section 10.7; provided, however, that such
obligations to indemnify and hold harmless shall not terminate with respect to
any item as to which an Indemnified Party shall have, prior to the expiration
of the applicable period, previously made a claim by delivering a written
notice (stating in reasonable detail, to the extent known, the nature of, and
factual and legal basis for, any such claim for indemnification, the amount
thereof (if known and quantifiable) and the provisions of this Agreement upon
which such claim for indemnification is made) to the Indemnifying Party. In
order to determine the validity or the amount of any applicable claim for
indemnification hereunder, each Party shall, and shall cause its Subsidiaries
to, provide to the other Parties and their respective representatives
reasonable access, upon the reasonable prior written request any such other
Party, to (a) all books, records and other documents (including work papers,
memoranda, financial statements, Tax Returns, Tax schedules and work papers,
Tax rulings and other determinations) relating to or containing information
relevant to such claim, and (b) such first Party's and its Subsidiaries'
employees and accountants (including making the chief financial officer and
accountants available to respond to reasonable written or oral inquiries of
such other Parties and their respective representatives), subject in each case
to the following conditions: (i) such access shall be at such other Parties'
cost and expense, (ii) such access shall be during normal business hours and
in a manner which will not disrupt the operation of the businesses of the
first Party and its Subsidiaries and (iii) no access shall be provided to
attorney-client privileged communications or attorney work product.

10.5 Procedures Relating to Indemnification.

(a) In order for a Person (the "Indemnified Party") to be entitled to any
indemnification provided for under this Agreement in respect of a claim or
demand made by any Person against the Indemnified Party (a "Third Party
Claim"), such Indemnified Party must notify the party against whom indemnity
is to be sought (the "Indemnifying Party") in writing, and in reasonable
detail (including a description of the claim, the amount thereof (if known and
quantifiable) and the basis thereof and the provisions of this Agreement upon
which such claim for indemnification is made), of the Third Party Claim as
promptly as reasonably possible after receipt, but in no event later than 30
Business Days after receipt, by such Indemnified Party of notice of the Third
Party Claim; provided that failure to give such notification on a timely basis
shall not affect the indemnification provided hereunder except to the extent
the Indemnifying Party shall have been actually prejudiced as a result of such
failure. Thereafter, the Indemnified Party shall deliver to the Indemnifying
Party, within 20 Business Days after the Indemnified Party's receipt thereof,
copies of all notices and documents (including court papers) received by the
Indemnified Party relating to the Third Party Claim.

(b) If a Third Party Claim is made against an Indemnified Party, the
Indemnifying Party shall be entitled to, at such Indemnifying Party's expense,
participate in the defense thereof and, if it so chooses, to assume the
defense thereof with counsel selected by the Indemnifying Party, acting
reasonably, except as otherwise provided below, so long as: (i) the Third
Party Claim involves principally




 

--- 
| | 

|


money damages and does not seek an injunction or other equitable relief
against the Indemnified Party that is likely to have a material adverse
effect, (ii) the Indemnified Party has not been advised in writing by counsel
that representation of both the Indemnifying Party and the Indemnified Party
by the same counsel in connection with the defense of the Third Party Claim
would be inappropriate due to actual or potential differing interests between
them (such as the availability of different defenses), (iii) the Third Party
Claim does not relate to or otherwise arise in connection with any criminal or
enforcement Action and (iv) the Indemnifying Party conducts the defense of the
Third Party Claim actively and diligently. To exercise such right, the
Indemnifying Party must give notice to the Indemnified Party of its election
to assume the defense of the Third Party Claim within 20 Business Day of
receipt from the Indemnified Party of notice of the Third Party Claim. Should
an Indemnifying Party so elect to assume the defense of a Third Party Claim,
(A) the Indemnifying Party shall reimburse the Indemnified Party for
reasonable legal and other out-of-pocket expenses incurred by the Indemnified
Party in connection with the defense thereof prior to the time the
Indemnifying Party assumed control and (B) the Indemnifying Party shall not be
liable to the Indemnified Party for legal expenses subsequently incurred by
the Indemnified Party in connection with the defense thereof. If the
Indemnifying Party assumes such defense, the Indemnified Party shall have the
right to participate in the defense thereof and to employ counsel, at its own
expense, separate from the counsel employed by the Indemnifying Party, it
being understood, however, that the Indemnifying Party shall control such
defense. If the Indemnifying Party chooses to defend any Third Party Claim,
all the Parties shall reasonably cooperate in the defense or prosecution of
such Third Party Claim. Such cooperation shall include the retention and (upon
the Indemnifying Party's request) the provision to the Indemnifying Party of
records, information and testimony and attending such conferences, discovery
proceedings, hearings, trials or appeals, which are reasonably requested in
connection with such Third Party Claim, and making employees and other
representatives and advisors available on a mutually convenient basis to
provide additional information and explanation of any material provided
hereunder. If the Indemnifying Party shall control the defense of any Third
Party Claim then the Indemnifying Party shall be entitled to settle such Third
Party Claim; provided that the Indemnifying Party shall obtain the prior
written consent of the Indemnified Party (which consent shall not be
unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed) before entering into any
settlement of a claim or ceasing to defend such claim if, pursuant to or as a
result of such settlement or cessation, injunctive or other equitable relief
will be imposed against the Indemnified Party (or Affiliates thereof) or if
such settlement does not expressly and unconditionally release the Indemnified
Party from all Liabilities and obligations with respect to such claim, without
prejudice or such Indemnified Party shall have to pay a portion of the
settlement.

(c) If the Indemnifying Party, having assumed control of a Third Party Claim
in accordance with Section 10.5(b), thereafter fails to defend the Third Party
Claim actively and diligently, the Indemnified Party shall be entitled to
assume such control and the Indemnifying Party shall be bound by the results
obtained by the Indemnified Party with respect to the Third Party Claim
(including the consenting by the Indemnified Party to the entry of any
judgment or the entering into by the Indemnified Party of any settlement or
compromise in connection therewith). If any of the other conditions listed in
Section 10.5(b) are not satisfied, the Indemnified Party shall be entitled to
control the applicable Third Party Claim from its outset, and if the
Indemnifying Party is entitled to control the applicable Third Party Claim in
accordance with Section 10.5(b) and conducts the defense of such Third Party
Claim actively and diligently but any of the other conditions listed in
Section 10.5(b) becomes unsatisfied, the Indemnified Party shall be entitled
to assume control of such Third Party Claim, and, in each case, the
Indemnifying Party shall pay for the reasonable fees and disbursements of
counsel of, and other reasonable fees and expenses of, the Indemnified Party,
and the Indemnifying Party shall be bound by the results obtained by the
Indemnified Party with respect to such Third Party Claim (including the
consenting by the Indemnified Party to the entry of any judgment or the
entering into by the Indemnified Party of any settlement or compromise in
connection therewith); provided, however, that the Indemnifying Party shall
not be bound by the entry of any such judgment consented to, or any such




 

--- 
| | 

|


compromise or settlement effected, without its prior written consent (which
consent shall not be unreasonably withheld or delayed). The Indemnified Party
and the Indemnifying Party agree to make available to each other, their
respective counsel and other respective representatives all information and
documents available to them which relate to a Third Party Claim.

(d) If any Third Party Claim is of a nature such that the Indemnified Party is
required by Law to incur Losses or make a payment to any Person that is not a
Party (a "Third Party") with respect to the Third Party Claim before the
completion of settlement negotiations or related Actions, the Indemnified
Party may incur such Losses or make such payment and the Indemnifying Party
shall, forthwith after demand by the Indemnified Party, reimburse the
Indemnified Party for such Losses or payment. If the amount of any Liability
of the Indemnified Party under such Third Party Claim, as finally determined,
is less than the amount that was paid by the Indemnifying Party to the
Indemnified Party, the Indemnified Party shall, forthwith after the receipt of
the difference from the Third Party, pay the amount of such difference,
together with any interest thereon paid by the Third Party to the Indemnified
Party, to the Indemnifying Party. In addition, the Indemnifying Party shall
post all security required by any court, regulatory body or other authority
having jurisdiction, including for purposes of enabling the Indemnifying Party
to contest any Third Party Claim.

10.6 Losses Net of Tax Benefits and Insurance. The amount of any and all
Losses under this Article X shall be determined net of (a) any Tax Benefits
actually realized by any Person seeking indemnification hereunder arising from
the deductibility or creditability against Taxes of any such Losses, to the
extent that such benefit is received by such Person as a direct consequence of
the accrual, incurrence or payment of any such Losses, (b) any Tax cost
incurred by any Person seeking indemnification hereunder as a result of the
matter giving rise to such Loss and (c) any amounts recovered by the
Indemnified Party under insurance policies or in respect of rights against
third parties for contribution or indemnification with respect to such Losses
(net of any deductibles or self-insured or co-insurance payments made by the
Indemnified Party or its Affiliates and net of any retrospective premium
adjustments or any anticipated experience-based premium adjustments). If,
after an indemnification payment was made, the Indemnified Party receives a
Tax Benefit for the year that the Loss is incurred that was not taken into
account at the time the indemnification payment was made, the relevant Party
shall promptly pay to the other Party the amount of such Tax Benefit. The
Indemnified Party shall seek full recovery under all insurance policies
covering any Loss and any source of recovery from third parties. In the event
that an insurance or other recovery is made by any Indemnified Party with
respect to any Loss for which any such Person has been indemnified hereunder,
then a refund equal to the aggregate amount of the recovery shall be promptly
made to the applicable Indemnifying Party. Each Party waives, to the extent
permitted under its applicable insurance policies, any subrogation rights that
its insurer may have with respect to any indemnifiable Losses. Any indemnity
payment under this Agreement shall be treated as an adjustment to the
Aggregate Purchase Price for Tax purposes.

10.7 Survival. (a) The representations and warranties herein (other than the
Fundamental Representations, Section 5.6, Section 5.7, Section 5.8, Section
6.15 and Sections 7.1 and 7.2) shall survive the Closing solely for purposes
of Section 10.1 and Section 10.3 and shall terminate on the close of business
on the date that is 18 months after the Closing Date; (b) the Fundamental
Representations, Section 5.6 and Sections 7.1 and 7.2 shall survive the
Closing solely for purposes of Section 10.1 and Section 10.3 and shall
terminate on the close of business on the date that is 10 years after the
Closing Date; (c) the representations and warranties contained in Section 5.7
and Section 6.15 shall survive the Closing solely for purposes of Section 10.1
and Section 10.3 and shall terminate on the close of business on the date that
is 60 days following the expiration of the underlying statute of limitations;
and (d) the representations and warranties contained in Section 6.11 shall
survive the Closing solely for purposes of Section 10.1 and Section 10.3 and
shall terminate on the close of business on the date that is 36 months after
the Closing Date, and no claims may be brought with respect to any such
representations and




 

--- 
| | 

|


warranties after five Business Days after the end of the applicable survival
period (which claims must have arisen prior to the end of the applicable
survival period and not during the five Business Day period thereafter). All
covenants contained in this Agreement which are to be performed prior to the
Closing and the ability to make indemnification claims pursuant to Section
10.1(a)(iii) shall terminate on the date that is 18 months following the
Closing Date. The covenants contained in this Agreement which are to be
performed at or after the Closing shall terminate once such covenants are
fully performed. No claim for indemnification hereunder for breach of any
representations, warranties, covenants, agreements and other provisions may be
made after the expiration of the applicable survival period set forth in this
Section 10.7. If a claim is made in accordance with the provisions of this
Agreement prior to the end of the relevant period to bring a claim, such
representation, warranty, covenant, agreement or other provision shall, as to
the matter specifically the subject of such claim, survive until resolved.

10.8 Manner of Payment. Subject to, and in accordance with, the provisions of
this Article X:

(a) Any indemnification of the Seller Indemnified Parties pursuant to this
Article X shall be delivered by the Buyers to the Sellers by wire transfer of
immediately available funds to an account designated by the Sellers within
five days after the determination thereof.

(b) Any indemnification of the Buyer Indemnified Parties pursuant to this
Article X (except in connection with any amounts to be paid over by the
Sellers to the Buyers pursuant to Section 9.8(b)(i) in connection with (x)
Pre-Closing Income Tax Returns or (y) Tax Returns for Straddle Periods in
connection with the Pre-Closing Tax Period and except in connection with
amounts payable by the Sellers to the Buyers pursuant to Section 10.1(a)(ix),
each of which shall be paid by the Sellers to the Buyers by wire transfer of
immediately available funds to an account designated by the Buyers) shall be
(i) first paid to the Buyers from amounts available in the Indemnity Escrow
Account and the Sellers and the Buyers shall execute and deliver a joint
written instruction to the Escrow Agent instructing the Escrow Agent to
release such amount to the Buyers by wire transfer of immediately available
funds to an account designated by Buyers in accordance with the terms of the
Escrow Agreement, and (ii) second, for any remaining amounts in excess of the
amounts available in the Indemnity Escrow Account, subject to the Cap (except
for such amounts in respect of the Fundamental Representations or Section 5.6,

11.5 Successors and Assigns. This Agreement and all of the provisions hereof
shall be binding upon and inure to the benefit of the Parties and their
respective successors and permitted assigns, except that neither this
Agreement nor any of the rights, interests or obligations hereunder may be
assigned or delegated by any Party without the prior written consent of the
Buyers and the Sellers; provided, however, that the Buyers may assign this
Agreement or any of the rights, interests or obligations hereunder to (a)
their Affiliates, (b) to any purchaser of the Company Group or any of its
Subsidiaries or the Buyers after the Closing Date and (c) to lenders of the
Buyers or their Affiliates as collateral security for borrowings, provided
that no such assignment shall serve to release the Buyers from Liability for
performance of the Buyers' obligations under this Agreement.

11.6 Non-Recourse. This Agreement may only be enforced against, and any claim
or cause of action based upon, arising out of or related to this Agreement may
only be brought against, the Persons that are expressly named as Parties to
this Agreement. Except to the extent named as a Party to this Agreement, and
then only to the extent of the specific obligations of such Parties set forth
in this Agreement, no past, present or future shareholder, member, partner,
manager, director, officer, employee, Affiliate, agent or representative of
any Party or the Company Group or any of its Subsidiaries will have any
obligation or Liability (whether in contract, tort, equity or otherwise) for
any of the representations, warranties, covenants, agreements or other
obligations or Liabilities of any of the Parties or for any claim based upon,
arising out of or related to this Agreement. Nothing in the foregoing is
however intended to restrict or limit recourse in the event of fraud.

11.7 Severability. Whenever possible, each provision of this Agreement shall
be interpreted in such manner as to be effective and valid under Law, but if
any provision of this Agreement is held to be prohibited by or invalid under
Law, such provision shall be ineffective only to the extent of such
prohibition or invalidity, without invalidating the remainder of such
provision or the remaining provisions of this Agreement, so long as the
economic or legal substance of the transactions contemplated hereby is not
affected in any manner materially adverse to any Party, and upon such a
holding, the Parties shall negotiate in good faith to modify this Agreement so
as to effect the original intent of the Parties as closely as possible in an
acceptable manner in order that the transactions contemplated hereby be
consummated as originally contemplated to the fullest extent possible.

11.8 Construction. The language used in this Agreement shall be deemed to be
the language

| | 

|


chosen by the Parties to express their mutual intent, and no rule of strict
construction shall be applied against any Person. The headings of the sections
and paragraphs of this Agreement have been inserted for convenience of
reference only and shall in no way restrict or otherwise modify any of the
terms or provisions hereof. In the event a subject matter is addressed in more
than one representation and warranty in Article IV or Article V, the Buyers
shall be entitled to rely only on the most specific representation and
warranty addressing such matter. The information contained in this Agreement,
in the Disclosure Schedules and in the exhibits hereto is disclosed solely for
purposes of this Agreement, and no information contained herein or therein
shall be deemed to be an admission or agreement by any Party to any third
party of any matter whatsoever (including any violation of Law or breach of
contract). Prior to the Closing, the Sellers and the Company Group shall have
the right, from time to time, to supplement, modify or update the Disclosure
Schedules with respect to (x) matters that arise after the date of this
Agreement and as to which the Company Group has no knowledge of as of the date
of this Agreement and which did not arise as a result of acts or omissions of
the Sellers, the Company Group or its Subsidiaries in violation of the
provisions of this Agreement or (y) Sections 6.7(a) and 6.27(b) of the
Disclosure Schedules for new Contracts entered into, and new guarantees
provided, by the Company Group after the date of this Agreement, so long as
such new Contracts or guarantees were entered into in compliance with the
covenants of Article IV. Such supplement, modification or update shall be
deemed to have supplemented, modified or updated the Disclosure Schedules, and
thus modified the representations and warranties of the Sellers or the Company
Group, as applicable, (i) except as provided in the next sentence, for
purposes determination of the satisfaction of the Closing conditions in
Article III and (ii) for purposes of indemnification under Article X. If such
supplement, modification or update discloses a matter that could reasonably
likely result in Losses by the Buyer Indemnified Parties following the Closing
in excess of $800,000 (or, if (x) the Buyers deliver a Closing Date Extension
Notice to the Sellers and (y) the Closing does not occur on or prior to July
5, 2017, if such supplement, modification or update discloses a Material
Adverse Effect), the Buyers shall have the right to terminate this Agreement
by giving Sellers written notice to that effect prior to the date Closing is
then anticipated to take place, based on the status of fulfillment of all
conditions to Closing other than those involving deliveries at Closing. If the
Buyers do not exercise such termination right and proceed to the Closing, then
the Buyers shall have no right to indemnification under Article X with respect
to such matter. From and after the Closing, references to the Disclosure
Schedules shall be references to the Disclosure Schedules as so supplemented,
modified, or updated.

11.9 No Third-Party Beneficiaries. The provisions of this Agreement are
intended for the benefit of, and shall be enforceable by the Parties and the
Parties shall have the right, but not the obligation, to enforce any
obligations of the other Parties under this Agreement. Section 9.4 and Section
11.5 shall be enforceable by each of the current and former officers,
directors or similar functionaries of the Company Group and its Subsidiaries
and his or her heirs and representatives. Except as provided in Article X and
as otherwise expressly provided herein (for avoidance of doubt, included as
provided in Section 11.15), nothing expressed or referred to in this Agreement
will be construed to give any Person other than the Parties to this Agreement,
and, for purposes of Section 9.4, each of the current and former officers,
directors or similar functionaries of the Company Group and its Subsidiaries
and his or her heirs and representatives, any legal or equitable right,
remedy, or claim under or with respect to this Agreement or any provision of
this Agreement. The representations and warranties in this Agreement are the
product of negotiations among the Parties and are for the sole benefit of the
Parties. Any inaccuracies in such representations and warranties are subject
to waiver by the Parties in accordance with this Agreement without notice or
Liability to any other Person. In some instances, the representations and
warranties in this Agreement may represent an allocation among the Parties of
risks associated with particular matters regardless of the knowledge of any of
the Parties. Consequently, Persons other than the Parties may not rely upon
the representations and warranties in this Agreement as characterizations of
actual facts or circumstances as of the date of this Agreement or as of any
other date.

11.10 Complete Agreement. This Agreement, together with the Confidentiality
Agreement, contains the complete agreement among the Parties and supersede any
prior understandings, agreements or representations by or among the Parties,
written or oral, which may have related to the subject matter hereof in any
way.

11.11 Electronic Delivery; Counterparts. This Agreement and any signed
agreement or instrument entered into in connection with this Agreement, and
any amendments hereto or thereto, may be executed in one or more counterparts,
all of which shall constitute one and the same instrument. Any such
counterpart, to the extent delivered by means of a facsimile machine or by
.pdf, .tif, .gif, .jpeg or similar attachment to electronic mail (any such
delivery, an "Electronic Delivery") shall be treated in all manner and
respects as an original executed counterpart and shall be considered to have
the same binding legal effect as if it were the original signed version
thereof delivered in person. At the reasonable request of any Party, each
other Party or thereto shall re-execute the original form of this Agreement
and deliver such form to all other Parties. No Party shall raise the use of
Electronic Delivery to deliver a signature or the fact that any signature or
agreement or instrument was transmitted or communicated through the use of
Electronic Delivery as a defense to the formation of a contract, and each such
Party forever waives any such defense, except to the extent such defense
relates to lack of authenticity.

11.12 Governing Law; WAIVER OF JURY TRIAL. All issues and questions concerning
the construction, validity, interpretation and enforceability of this
Agreement and the exhibits and schedules hereto, and all Actions arising
hereunder or thereunder or in connection herewith or therewith, whether
purporting to be sound in contract or tort, or at law or in equity, shall be
governed by, and construed in accordance with, the Laws of the state of
Washington, without giving effect to any choice of law or conflict of law
rules or provisions (whether of the state of Washington or any other
jurisdiction) that would cause the application of the Laws of any jurisdiction
other than the state of Washington. The Parties hereby agree and consent to be
subject to the exclusive jurisdiction of the any federal court or state court
located in King County, Washington (and in each case of the appropriate
appellate courts therefrom), and hereby waive the right to assert the lack of
personal or subject matter jurisdiction or improper venue in connection with
any such Action. In furtherance of the foregoing, each of the Parties (a)
waives the defense of inconvenient forum, (b) agrees not to commence any
Action arising out of this Agreement or any transactions contemplated hereby
other than in any such court and (c) agrees that a final judgment in any such
Action shall be conclusive and may be enforced in other jurisdictions by suit
or judgment or in any other manner provided by Law. Process in any such Action
may be served on any Party anywhere in the world, whether within or without
the jurisdiction of any such court. Without limiting the foregoing, each Party
agrees that service of process on such Party as provided in Section 11.4 shall
be deemed effective service of process on such Party. EACH PARTY HEREBY
KNOWINGLY, INTENTIONALLY AND VOLUNTARILY AND WITH AND UPON THE ADVICE OF
COMPETENT COUNSEL IRREVOCABLY WAIVES ALL RIGHT TO TRIAL BY JURY IN ANY ACTION,
CROSS‑CLAIM OR COUNTERCLAIM IN ANY COURT (WHETHER BASED ON CONTRACT, TORT, OR
OTHERWISE) ARISING OUT OF, RELATING TO OR IN CONNECTION WITH (i) THIS
AGREEMENT OR THE VALIDITY, PERFORMANCE, INTERPRETATION, COLLECTION OR
ENFORCEMENT HEREOF, (ii) THE TRANSACTIONS CONTEMPLATED HEREBY OR (iii) THE
ACTIONS OF SUCH PARTY IN THE NEGOTIATION, AUTHORIZATION, EXECUTION, DELIVERY,
ADMINISTRATION, PERFORMANCE OR ENFORCEMENT HEREOF. EACH PARTY (1) CERTIFIES
THAT NO REPRESENTATIVE, AGENT OR ATTORNEY OF ANY OTHER PARTY HAS REPRESENTED,
EXPRESSLY OR OTHERWISE, THAT SUCH OTHER PARTY WOULD NOT, IN THE EVENT OF
LITIGATION, SEEK TO ENFORCE THE FOREGOING WAIVER AND (2) ACKNOWLEDGES THAT IT
AND THE OTHER PARTIES HAVE BEEN INDUCED TO ENTER INTO THIS AGREEMENT BY, AMONG
OTHER THINGS, THE MUTUAL WAIVERS AND CERTIFICATIONS IN THIS SECTION.

11.13 Specific Performance. The Parties agree that irreparable damage would
occur in the event that any of the provisions of this Agreement were not
performed in accordance with their specific terms or were otherwise breached,
and that money damages or legal remedies would not be an adequate remedy for
any such damages. Therefore, it is accordingly agreed that each Party shall be
entitled to enforce specifically the terms and provisions of this Agreement,
or to enforce compliance with, the covenants and obligations of any other
Party, in any court of competent jurisdiction, and appropriate injunctive
relief shall be granted in connection therewith. Any Party seeking an
injunction, a decree or order of specific performance shall not be required to
provide any bond or other security in connection therewith and any such remedy
shall be in addition to and not in substitution for any other remedy to which
such Party is entitled at law or in equity.

11.14 Prevailing Party. Unless otherwise expressly provided herein, if there
shall occur any dispute or proceeding between any of the Parties relating to
this Agreement or the transactions contemplated hereby, the non-prevailing
Party shall pay all reasonable costs and fees (including reasonable attorneys'
fees and expenses) of the prevailing Party.

11.15 Acknowledgement. Following the Closing, in any dispute or proceeding
arising under or in connection with, or any other matter related to, this
Agreement, the Sellers and their Affiliates shall have the right, at their
respective election, to retain KandL Gates LLP and its Affiliates (collectively,
the "Law Firm") to represent it in such matter, and the Buyers hereby
irrevocably waive and consent to (and will cause their Subsidiaries
(including, after the Closing, the Company Group and its Subsidiaries) to
waive and consent to), any such representation in any such matter and the
communication by such counsel to the Sellers or any of their Affiliates in
connection with any such representation of any fact known to such counsel
arising by reason of such counsel's prior representation of the Company Group
and its Subsidiaries. The Buyers irrevocably acknowledge and agree that all
Attorney-Client Communications would not be subject to disclosure to the
Buyers and their Affiliates in connection with any process relating to a
dispute arising under or in connection with, this Agreement or otherwise,
shall continue after the Closing and for all purposes be deemed to be
privileged communications between the Law Firm and the Sellers, and none of
the Buyers or their Affiliates (including, after Closing, the Company Group
and its Subsidiaries) nor any Person purporting to act on behalf of or through
any of the foregoing shall (a) seek to obtain the same by any process on the
grounds that the privilege attaching to such communications belongs to the
Company Group and its Subsidiaries and not to the Sellers or (b) take any
action which could cause any Attorney-Client Communication to cease being a
confidential communication or to otherwise lose protection under the attorney-
client privilege or any other evidentiary privilege, including waiving such
protection in any dispute with a Person that is not the Sellers or an
Affiliate thereof.

11.16 No Right of Set-Off. Each Party, for itself and its successors and
permitted assigns, hereby unconditionally and irrevocably waives any rights of
set-off, netting, offset, recoupment, or similar rights that such Party or any
of its successors and permitted assigns has or may have with respect to any
payments to be made by such Party pursuant to this Agreement or any other
document or instrument delivered by such Party in connection herewith.

11.17 Relationship of the Parties. Nothing in this Agreement shall be deemed
to constitute the Parties as joint venturers, alter egos, partners or
participants in an unincorporated business or other separate entity, nor,
except as specifically set forth herein, in any manner create any principal
agent, fiduciary or other special relationship among the Parties. No Party
shall have any duties (including fiduciary duties) towards any other Party
except as specifically set forth herein.

references in this Agreement to the Underlying Agreement are solely for the
convenience of Purchasers and Sellers and (iii) Escrow Agent shall have no
implied duties beyond the express duties set forth in this Agreement.

NOW, THEREFORE, for good and valuable consideration, the receipt and

If, at any time, (a) there shall exist any dispute with respect to the holding or disposition of all or any portion of the Escrow Funds or any other obligations of Escrow Agent hereunder, (b) Escrow Agent is unable to determine, to Escrow Agent's sole satisfaction, the proper disposition of
all or any portion of the Escrow Funds or Escrow Agent's proper actions with
respect to its obligations hereunder, or (c) the Representatives have not,
within ten (10) days after the furnishing by Escrow Agent of a notice of
resignation, appointed a successor Escrow Agent to act hereunder, then Escrow
Agent may, in its sole discretion, take either or both of the following
actions:

(i) suspend the performance of any of its obligations (including without
limitation any disbursement obligations) under this Agreement until such
dispute or uncertainty shall be resolved to the sole satisfaction of Escrow
Agent or until a successor Escrow Agent shall have been appointed; or

(ii) petition (by means of an interpleader action or any other appropriate
method) any court of competent jurisdiction, in any venue convenient to Escrow
Agent, for instructions with respect to such dispute or uncertainty and, to
the extent required or permitted by law, pay into such court, for holding and
disposition in accordance with the instructions of such court, all Escrow
Funds, after deduction and payment to Escrow Agent of all fees and expenses
(including court costs and attorneys' fees) payable to, incurred by, or
expected to be incurred by Escrow Agent in connection with the performance of
its duties and the exercise of its rights hereunder.

Escrow Agent shall have no liability to Purchasers, Sellers or the
Representatives, their respective owners, shareholders or members or any other
person with respect to any such suspension of performance or disbursement into
court, specifically including any liability or claimed liability that may
arise, or be alleged to have arisen, out of or as a result of any delay in the
disbursement of the Escrow Funds or any delay in or with respect to any other
action required or requested of Escrow Agent.

8. Resolutions and Disbursement of Claims. If during the Escrow Period any Purchaser elects to make a claim for indemnity against Sellers, then the procedures for administering and resolving such claims shall be as follows: 

(a) If any Purchaser elects to assert a claim for indemnity (an "Indemnity
Claim"), it must (i) give written notice of such claim (a "Claim Notice") to
Escrow Agent and Sellers Representative prior to the expiration of the Escrow
Period. Such Claim Notice shall include a description of the claim and the
basis therefor and the amount, if known, asserted by such Purchaser for such
claim (including, if appropriate, an estimate of all costs and expenses
reasonably expected to be incurred by such Purchaser by reason of such claim).
Within thirty (30) days after the date upon which such Claim Notice is
delivered to Escrow Agent (the "Claim Notice Delivery Date"), Sellers
Representative may advise Purchasers Representative and Escrow Agent in
writing whether Sellers Representative objects to some or all of the Indemnity
Claim described in the Claim Notice.

(b) Escrow Agent shall pay an Indemnity Claim to the applicable Purchaser
from the Escrow Funds in the amount of the Claim Notice (i) if Escrow Agent
has not received from Sellers Representative a written objection (a "Claim
Response") to any or all (the "Contested Amount") of the Claim Notice amount within thirty (30) days after the Claim
Notice Delivery Date and Purchasers Representative has provided a written
statement to Escrow Agent stating that Purchasers Representative has delivered
the Claim Notice to Sellers Representative in accordance with the notice
provisions hereof, and that Sellers Representative have failed to object to
the Indemnity Claim; or (ii) pursuant to a Joint Written Direction.

(c) If, within thirty (30) days after the Claim Notice Delivery Date, Escrow
Agent receives from Sellers Representative a Claim Response to the Claim
Notice, Escrow Agent shall pay from the Escrow Funds to the applicable
Purchaser all of the Claim Notice amount except for the Contested Amount.
Thereafter, Escrow Agent shall release the Contested Amount only pursuant to
(i) a Joint Written Direction or (ii) a Final Order.

(d) Escrow Agent shall have no responsibility to determine the validity or
sufficiency of any Claim Notice or Claim Response or whether any Claim Notice
or Claim Response has been received by, or to provide a copy of any Claim
Notice or Claim Response to, any of Purchasers, Sellers or their respective
Representatives. Escrow Agent may conclusively presume that any Claim Notice
or Claim Response delivered to it has been simultaneously delivered to Sellers
Representative or Purchasers Representative, as the case may be.

9. Investment of Funds. Based upon Sellers' prior review of investment alternatives, in the absence of further specific written direction to the contrary, Escrow Agent is directed to initially invest and reinvest the Escrow Funds in the investment indicated on Schedule B hereto. Sellers acknowledge receipt from Escrow Agent of a current copy of the prospectus for the investment authorized in Schedule B hereto. Sellers Representative may provide written direction changing the investment of the Escrow Funds to Escrow Agent, upon which direction Escrow Agent shall conclusively rely without inquiry or investigation; provided, however, that Sellers warrant that no investment or reinvestment direction shall be given except in the following: (a) direct obligations of the United States of America or obligations the principal of and the interest on which are unconditionally guaranteed by the United States of America; (b) U.S. dollar denominated deposit accounts and certificates of deposit issued by any bank, bank and trust company, or national banking association (including Escrow Agent and its affiliates), which are either (i) insured by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation ("FDIC") up to FDIC limits, or (ii) with domestic commercial banks which have a rating on their short-term certificates of deposit on the date of purchase of "A-1" or "A-l+" by SandP or "P-1" by Moody's and maturing no more than 360 days after the date of purchase (ratings on holding companies are not considered as the rating of the bank); (c) repurchase agreements with any bank, trust company, or national banking association (including Escrow Agent and its affiliates); or (d) institutional money market funds, including funds managed by Escrow Agent or any of its affiliates; provided further, however, that Escrow Agent will not be directed to invest in investments that Escrow Agent determines are not consistent with Escrow Agent's policies or practices. Purchasers and Sellers recognize and agree that Escrow Agent will not provide supervision, recommendations or advice relating to either the investment of Escrow Funds or the purchase, sale, retention or other disposition of any investment described herein. Escrow Agent has no responsibility whatsoever to determine the market or other value of any investment and makes no representation or warranty, express or implied, as to the accuracy of any such valuations or that any values necessarily reflect the proceeds that may be
received on the sale of an investment. If Escrow Agent has not received a
written investment instruction from Sellers Representative at any time that an
investment decision must be made, Escrow Agent is directed to invest the
Escrow Funds, or such portion thereof as to which no written investment
instruction has been received, in the investment indicated on Schedule B
hereto. All investments shall be made in the name of Escrow Agent.
Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained herein, Escrow Agent may,
without notice to Purchasers and Sellers, sell or liquidate any of the
foregoing investments at any time for any disbursement of Escrow Funds
permitted or required hereunder. All investment earnings shall become part of
the Escrow Funds and investment losses shall be charged against the Escrow
Funds. Escrow Agent shall not be liable or responsible for loss in the value
of any investment made pursuant to this Agreement, or for any loss, cost or
penalty resulting from any sale or liquidation of any such investment. With
respect to any Escrow Funds or investment instruction received by Escrow Agent
after 11:00 a.m., Central Time, Escrow Agent shall not be required to invest
such funds or to effect any investment instruction until the next day upon
which Escrow Agent is open to conduct its regular banking business. Receipt of
the Escrow Funds and investment and reinvestment of the Escrow Funds shall be
confirmed by Escrow Agent by an account statement, and Purchasers or Sellers
may inform Escrow Agent in writing of any error, omission or inaccuracy in any
such account statement. Failure to inform Escrow Agent in writing of any
error, omission or inaccuracy in any such account statement within ninety (90)
days after receipt shall conclusively be deemed confirmation and approval by
Purchasers and Sellers of such account statement in its entirety, which shall
thereafter not provide any basis for a claim against or liability of Escrow
Agent.

10. Resignation or Removal of Escrow Agent. Escrow Agent may resign and be discharged from the performance of its duties hereunder at any time by giving ten (10) days' prior written notice to Purchasers and Sellers specifying a date when such resignation shall take effect and, after the date of such resignation notice, notwithstanding any other provision of this Agreement, Escrow Agent's sole obligation will be to hold the Escrow Funds pending appointment of a successor Escrow Agent. Similarly, Escrow Agent may be removed at any time by Purchasers Representative and Sellers Representative giving at least thirty (30) days' prior written notice to Escrow Agent specifying the date when such removal shall take effect. Purchasers Representative and Sellers Representative jointly shall appoint a successor Escrow Agent hereunder prior to the effective date of such resignation or removal. If Purchasers Representative and Sellers Representative fail to appoint a successor Escrow Agent within such time, Escrow Agent shall have the right to petition a court of competent jurisdiction to appoint a successor escrow agent, and the costs and expenses (including without limitation attorneys' fees) related to such petition shall be paid jointly and severally by Purchasers and Sellers. The retiring Escrow Agent shall transmit all records pertaining to the Escrow Funds and shall pay all Escrow Funds to the successor Escrow Agent, after making copies of such records as the retiring Escrow Agent deems advisable and after deduction and payment to the retiring Escrow Agent of all fees and expenses (including court costs and attorneys' fees) payable to, incurred by, or expected to be incurred by the retiring Escrow Agent in connection with the performance of its duties and the exercise of its rights hereunder. After any retiring Escrow Agent's resignation or removal, the provisions of this Agreement shall inure to its benefit as to any actions taken or omitted to be taken by it while it was Escrow Agent under this Agreement. 11. Liability of Escrow Agent. Escrow Agent undertakes to perform only such duties as are expressly set forth herein and no duties shall be implied. Escrow Agent has no fiduciary or discretionary duties of any kind. Escrow Agent's permissive rights shall not be construed as duties. Escrow Agent shall have no liability under and no duty to inquire as to the provisions of any agreement other than this Agreement, including without limitation any other agreement between any or all of the parties hereto or any other persons even though reference thereto may be made herein and whether or not a copy of such agreement has been provided to Escrow Agent. Escrow Agent shall not be liable for any action taken or omitted by it in good faith except to the extent that a court of competent jurisdiction determines, which determination is not subject to appeal, that Escrow Agent's gross negligence or willful misconduct in connection with its material breach of this Agreement was the sole cause of any loss to Purchasers or Sellers. Escrow Agent may retain and act hereunder through agents, and shall not be responsible for or have any liability with respect to the acts of any such agent retained by Escrow Agent in good faith. Escrow Agent's sole responsibility shall be for the safekeeping of the Escrow Funds in accordance with Escrow Agent's customary practices and disbursement thereof in accordance with the terms of this Agreement. Escrow Agent shall not be responsible for or have any duty to make any calculations under this Agreement, or to determine when any calculation required under the provisions of this Agreement should be made, how it should be made or what it should be, or to confirm or verify any such calculation. Escrow Agent shall not be charged with knowledge or notice of any fact or circumstance not specifically set forth herein. Escrow Agent may rely upon any notice, instruction, request or other instrument, not only as to its due execution, validity and effectiveness, but also as to the truth and accuracy of any information contained therein, which Escrow Agent believes to be genuine and to have been signed or presented by the person or parties purporting to sign the same. In no event shall Escrow Agent be liable for (a) acting in accordance with or conclusively relying upon any instruction, notice, demand, certificate or document believed by Escrow Agent to have been created by or on behalf of Purchasers or Sellers, (b) incidental, indirect, special, consequential or punitive damages or penalties of any kind (including, but not limited to, lost profits), even if Escrow Agent has been advised of the likelihood of such damages or penalty and regardless of the form of action, or (c) any amount greater than the value of the Escrow Funds as valued upon deposit with Escrow Agent. Escrow Agent shall not be responsible for delays or failures in performance resulting from acts beyond its control, including without limitation acts of God, strikes, lockouts, riots, acts of war or terror, epidemics, governmental regulations, fire, communication line failures, computer viruses, attacks or intrusions, power failures, earthquakes or other disasters. Escrow Agent shall not be obligated to take any legal action or commence any proceeding in connection with the Escrow Funds, any account in which Escrow Funds are deposited, this Agreement or the Underlying Agreement or to appear in, prosecute or defend any such legal action or proceeding or to take any other action that in Escrow Agent's sole judgment may expose it to potential expense or liability. Escrow Agent may consult legal counsel selected by it in the event of any dispute or question as to the construction of any of the provisions hereof or of any other agreement or of its duties hereunder, or relating to any dispute involving any party hereto, and shall incur no liability and shall be fully indemnified from any liability whatsoever in acting in accordance with the advice of such counsel. Purchasers and Sellers, jointly and severally, further agree to each promptly pay, upon demand, the reasonable fees and expenses of any such counsel. Purchasers and Sellers agree to perform or procure the performance of all
further acts and things, and execute and deliver such further documents, as
may be required by law or as Escrow Agent may reasonably request in connection
with its duties hereunder.

Escrow Agent is authorized, in its sole discretion, to comply with orders
issued or process entered by any court with respect to the Escrow Funds,
without determination by Escrow Agent of such court's jurisdiction in the
matter. If any portion of the Escrow Funds is at any time attached, garnished
or levied upon under any court order, or in case the payment, assignment,
transfer, conveyance or delivery of any such property shall be stayed or
enjoined by any court order, or in case any order, judgment or decree shall be
made or entered by any court affecting such property or any part thereof, then
and in any such event, Escrow Agent is authorized, in its sole discretion, to
rely upon and comply with any such order, writ, judgment or decree which it is
advised by legal counsel selected by it is binding upon it, without the need
for appeal or other action; and if Escrow Agent complies with any such order,
writ, judgment or decree, it shall not be liable to any of the parties hereto
or to any other person or entity by reason of such compliance even though such
order, writ, judgment or decree may be subsequently reversed, modified,
annulled, set aside or vacated.

12. Indemnification of Escrow Agent. Purchasers and Sellers, jointly and severally, shall, to the fullest extent permitted by law, indemnify and hold harmless Escrow Agent and each director, officer, employee, attorney, agent and affiliate of Escrow Agent (each, an "Indemnified Party") upon demand against any and all actions, claims (whether or not valid), losses, damages, liabilities, penalties, costs and expenses of any kind or nature (including without limitation reasonable attorneys' fees, costs and expenses) incurred by or asserted against any of the Indemnified Parties, whether direct, indirect or consequential, as a result of or arising from or in any way relating to any claim, demand, suit, action or proceeding (including any inquiry or investigation) threatened, asserted or initiated by any person or entity, including without limitation Purchasers, Sellers and the Representatives, arising from or in connection with this Agreement or any transactions contemplated herein, whether or not any such Indemnified Party is a party to any such suit, action or proceeding or the target of any such inquiry or investigation; provided, however, that no Indemnified Party shall have the right to be indemnified hereunder for any liability finally determined by a court of competent jurisdiction, which determination is not subject to appeal, to have been directly caused solely by the gross negligence or willful misconduct of such Indemnified Party or in connection with Escrow Agent's material breach of this Agreement. Purchasers and Sellers, jointly and severally, further agree to indemnify each Indemnified Party for all costs, including without limitation reasonable attorney's fees, incurred by such Indemnified Party in connection with the enforcement of Purchasers' and Sellers' obligations hereunder. Each Indemnified Party shall, in its sole discretion, have the right to select and employ separate counsel with respect to any action or claim brought or asserted against it, and the reasonable fees of such counsel shall be paid upon demand by Purchasers and Sellers jointly and severally. The obligations of Purchasers and Sellers under this Section shall survive any termination of this Agreement and the resignation or removal of Escrow Agent.

Purchasers and Sellers agree that neither the payment by Purchasers or Sellers
of any claim by Escrow Agent for indemnification hereunder nor the
disbursement of any amounts to Escrow Agent from the Escrow Funds in respect of a claim by Escrow Agent for
indemnification shall impair, limit, modify or affect, as between Purchasers
and Sellers, the respective rights and obligations of Purchasers and Sellers
under the Underlying Agreement.

13. Compensation of Escrow Agent.

(a) Fees and Expenses. Purchasers and Sellers, jointly and severally, shall
compensate Escrow Agent upon demand for its services hereunder in accordance
with Schedule A hereto. The obligations of Purchasers and Sellers under this
Section shall survive any termination of this Agreement and the resignation or
removal of Escrow Agent.

(b) Disbursements from Escrow Funds to Pay Escrow Agent. Escrow Agent is
authorized to, and may disburse to itself from the Escrow Funds, from time to
time, the amount of any compensation and reimbursement of expenses due and
payable hereunder (including any amount to which Escrow Agent or any
Indemnified Party is entitled to seek indemnification hereunder). Escrow Agent
shall notify Purchasers and Sellers of any disbursement from the Escrow Funds
to itself or any Indemnified Party in respect of any compensation or
reimbursement hereunder and shall furnish Purchasers and Sellers copies of
related invoices and other statements.

(c) Security and Offset. Purchasers and Sellers hereby grant to Escrow Agent
and the Indemnified Parties a first priority security interest in, lien upon
and right of offset against the Escrow Funds with respect to any compensation
or reimbursement due any of them hereunder (including any claim for
indemnification hereunder). If for any reason the Escrow Funds are
insufficient to cover such compensation and reimbursement, Purchasers and
Sellers, jointly and severally, shall promptly pay such amounts to Escrow
Agent or any Indemnified Party upon receipt of an itemized invoice.

(d) Allocation. Without limiting their joint and several obligations to Escrow
Agent, Purchasers and Sellers agree, solely as among themselves, that all
amounts payable to Escrow Agent pursuant to this Agreement shall be paid 50%
by Purchasers and 50% by Sellers.

14. Representations and Warranties. Each Purchaser and each Seller makes the following representations and warranties to Escrow Agent with respect to itself:

(a) it has full power and authority to execute and deliver this Agreement and
to perform its obligations hereunder; and this Agreement has been duly
approved by all necessary action and constitutes its valid and binding
agreement enforceable in accordance with its terms;

(b) each of the applicable persons designated on Schedule C hereto has been
duly appointed to act as its authorized representative hereunder and
individually has full power and authority on its behalf to execute and deliver
any Joint Written Direction, to amend, modify or waive any provision of this
Agreement and to take any and all other actions as its authorized
representative under this Agreement, all without further consent or direction
from, or notice to, it or any other person; and (c) no change in designation of such authorized representatives shall be
effective until written notice of such change is delivered to each other party
to this Agreement pursuant to Section 16 and Escrow Agent has had reasonable
time to act upon it.

15. Identifying Information. To help the government fight the funding of terrorism and money laundering activities, federal law requires all financial institutions to obtain, verify and record information that identifies each person who opens an account. For a non-individual person such as a business entity, a charity, a trust or other legal entity, Escrow Agent requires documentation to verify its formation and existence as a legal entity. Escrow Agent may require financial statements, licenses or identification and authorization documents from individuals claiming authority to represent the entity or other relevant documentation. Purchasers and Sellers agree to provide all information requested by Escrow Agent in connection with any legislation or regulation to which Escrow Agent is subject, in a timely manner.

16. Notices. All notices, approvals, consents, requests and other communications hereunder shall be in writing (provided that any communication sent to Escrow Agent hereunder must be in the form of a manually signed document or electronic copy thereof), in English, and shall be delivered (a) by personal delivery, (b) by national overnight courier service, (c) by certified or registered mail, return receipt requested, (d) via facsimile transmission, with confirmed receipt or (e) via email by way of a PDF attachment thereto. Notice shall be effective upon receipt except for notice via email, which shall be effective only when the recipient, by return email or notice delivered by other method provided for in this Section, acknowledges having received that email (with an automatic "read receipt" or similar notice not constituting an acknowledgement of an email receipt for purposes of this Section). Such notices shall be sent to the applicable party or parties at the address specified below:

or to such other address as each party may designate for itself by like notice
and unless otherwise provided herein shall be deemed to have been given on the date received.
Purchasers and Sellers agree to assume all risks arising out of the use of
electronic methods to submit instructions and directions to Escrow Agent,
including without limitation the risk of Escrow Agent acting on unauthorized
instructions, and the risk of interception and misuse by third parties.

17\. Optional Security Procedures. In the event instructions, including funds
transfer instructions, address change or change in contact information are
given to Escrow Agent (other than in writing at the time of execution of this
Agreement), whether in writing, by facsimile or otherwise, Escrow Agent is
authorized but shall not be required to seek confirmation of such instructions
by telephone call-back to the person or persons designated on Schedule C
hereto, and Escrow Agent may rely upon the confirmation of anyone purporting
to be the person or persons so designated. The persons and telephone numbers
for call-backs may be changed only in writing actually received and
acknowledged by Escrow Agent and shall be effective only after Escrow Agent
has a reasonable opportunity to act on such changes. If Escrow Agent is unable
to contact any of the designated representatives identified in Schedule C
hereto, Escrow Agent is hereby authorized but shall be under no duty to seek
confirmation of such instructions by telephone call-back to any one or more of
Purchasers' or Sellers' executive officers ("Executive Officers"), as the case
may be, which shall include the titles of Chief Executive Officer, President
and Vice President, as Escrow Agent may select. Such Executive Officer shall
deliver to Escrow Agent a fully executed incumbency certificate, and Escrow
Agent may rely upon the confirmation of anyone purporting to be any such
officer. Purchasers and Sellers agree that Escrow Agent may at its option
record any telephone calls made pursuant to this Section. Escrow Agent in any
funds transfer may rely solely upon any account numbers or similar identifying
numbers provided by Purchasers or Sellers to identify (a) the beneficiary, (b)
the beneficiary's bank or (c) an intermediary bank. Escrow Agent may apply any
of the Escrow Funds for any payment order it executes using any such
identifying number, even when its use may result in a person other than the
beneficiary being paid, or the transfer of funds to a bank other than the
beneficiary's bank or an intermediary bank so designated. Purchasers and
Sellers acknowledge that these optional security procedures are commercially
reasonable.

18. Binding Effect; Successors. This Agreement shall be binding upon the respective parties hereto and their respective successors and permitted assigns. If Escrow Agent consolidates, merges or converts into, or transfers all or substantially all of its corporate trust business (including the escrow contemplated by this Agreement) to, another entity, the successor or transferee entity without any further act shall be the successor Escrow Agent.

19. Amendment, Waiver and Assignment. None of the terms or conditions of this Agreement may be changed, waived, modified, discharged, terminated or varied in any manner whatsoever unless in writing duly signed by each party to this Agreement. No course of conduct shall constitute a waiver of any of the terms and conditions of this Agreement, unless such waiver is specified in writing, and then only to the extent so specified. A waiver of any of the terms and conditions of this Agreement on one occasion shall not constitute a waiver of the other terms of this Agreement, or of such terms and conditions on any other occasion. Except as otherwise expressly provided herein, this Agreement may not be assigned by any party hereto without the written consent of the other parties hereto. 20. Severability. To the extent any provision of this Agreement is prohibited by or invalid under applicable law, such provision shall be ineffective to the extent of such prohibition or invalidity, without invalidating the remainder of such provision or the remaining provisions of this Agreement.

21. Governing Law. This Agreement shall be construed and interpreted in accordance with the internal laws of the State of Washington without giving effect to the conflict of laws principles thereof that would require the application of any other laws.

22. Consent to Jurisdiction and Venue. Each of the parties hereto irrevocably (a) consents to the exclusive jurisdiction and venue of the state and federal courts in the State of Washington in connection with any matter based upon or arising out of this Agreement, (b) waives any objection to such jurisdiction or venue, (c) agrees not to commence any legal proceedings related hereto except in such courts and (d) consents to and agrees to accept service of process to vest personal jurisdiction over them in any such courts made in the manner provided by for the giving of notice in Section 16. 

23. Entire Agreement, No Third Party Beneficiaries. This Agreement constitutes the entire agreement among the signatory parties hereto relating to the holding, investment and disbursement of the Escrow Funds and sets forth in their entirety the obligations and duties of Escrow Agent with respect to the Escrow Funds. Nothing in this Agreement, express or implied, is intended to or shall confer upon any person other than the signatory parties hereto and the Indemnified Parties any right, benefit or remedy of any nature whatsoever under or by reason of this Agreement.

24. Execution in Counterparts, Facsimiles. This Agreement and any Joint Written Direction may be executed in two or more counterparts, which when so executed shall constitute one and the same agreement or direction. The delivery of copies of this Agreement and any Joint Written Direction and their respective signature pages as a PDF attachment to an email or by facsimile transmission in accordance with Section 16 shall constitute effective execution and delivery as to the parties hereto and may be used in lieu of originals for all purposes. 

25. Termination. This Agreement shall terminate upon the distribution of all the Escrow Funds pursuant to any applicable provision of this Agreement, and Escrow Agent shall thereafter have no further obligation or liability whatsoever with respect to this Agreement or the Escrow Funds.

26. Dealings. Escrow Agent and any stockholder, director, officer or employee of Escrow Agent may buy, sell and deal in any of the securities of any other party hereto and become pecuniarily interested in any transaction in which any other party hereto may be interested, and contract and lend money to any other party hereto and otherwise act as fully and freely as though it were not Escrow Agent under this Agreement. Nothing herein shall preclude Escrow Agent from acting in any other capacity for any other party hereto or for any other person or entity. 27. Brokerage Confirmation Waiver. Purchasers and Sellers acknowledge that to the extent regulations of the Comptroller of the Currency or other applicable regulatory entity grant either the right to receive brokerage confirmations for certain security transactions as they occur, Purchasers and Sellers specifically waive receipt of such confirmations to the extent permitted by law. Escrow Agent will furnish Purchasers and Sellers periodic cash transaction statements that include detail for all investment transactions made by Escrow Agent.

28. Tax Reporting. Escrow Agent shall have no responsibility for the tax consequences of this Agreement and Purchasers and Sellers shall consult with independent counsel concerning any and all tax matters. Purchasers and Sellers shall provide Escrow Agent a properly completed IRS Form W-9 or Form W-8, as applicable, for each payee. If requested tax documentation is not so provided, Escrow Agent is authorized to withhold taxes as required by the United States Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended and related regulations (the "Code"). Purchasers and Sellers have determined that any interest or income on Escrow Funds shall be reported on an accrual basis and deemed to be for the account of Sellers. Within 30 days following the end of each calendar quarter, Escrow Agent shall distribute to Sellers Representative an amount equal to 40% of the cumulative amount of taxable income earned from investment of the Escrow Funds during such calendar quarter. Purchasers and Sellers shall prepare and file all required tax filings with the IRS and any other applicable taxing authority; provided that the parties further agree that:

(a) Escrow Agent IRS Reporting. Purchasers and Sellers shall accurately
provide Escrow Agent with all information requested by Escrow Agent in
connection with the preparation and filing with the IRS of all applicable Form
1099 and Form 1042-S documents with respect to all distributions as well as in
the performance of Escrow Agent's reporting obligations under the Foreign
Account Tax Compliance Act and Foreign Investment in Real Property Tax Act or
other applicable U.S. federal law or regulation.

(b) Withholding Requests and Indemnification. Purchasers and Sellers, jointly
and severally, agree to (i) assume all obligations imposed now or hereafter by
any applicable tax law or regulation with respect to payments or performance
under this Agreement, (ii) request Escrow Agent in writing with respect to
withholding and other taxes, assessments or other governmental charges, and
advise Escrow Agent in writing with respect to any certifications and
governmental reporting that may be required under any applicable laws or
regulations, and (iii) indemnify and hold Escrow Agent harmless from any
liability or obligation on account of taxes, assessments, additions for late
payment, interest, penalties, expenses and other governmental charges that may
be assessed or asserted against Escrow Agent. The indemnification provided by
this Section is in addition to any other indemnification provision of this

IMPORTANT INFORMATION ABOUT PROCEDURES FOR OPENING A NEW ACCOUNT:

To help the government fight the funding of terrorism and money laundering
activities, Federal law requires all financial institutions to obtain, verify
and record information that identifies each person who opens an account.

For a non-individual person such as a business entity, a charity, a Trust or
other legal entity we will ask for documentation to verify its formation and
existence as a legal entity. We may also ask to see financial statements,
licenses, identification and authorization documents from individuals claiming
authority to represent the entity or other relevant documentation.

Confidentiality 

(1) The Covenantor covenants and agrees that the Covenantor will, and will
cause each Seller Affiliate to, keep secret and confidential and the
Covenantor will not, and will cause each Seller Affiliate not to, directly or
indirectly, in any manner whatsoever, divulge, communicate, diffuse, sell,
transfer, reproduce, give, circulate, distribute or otherwise disclose to any
Person, or otherwise make public, or use for his or its benefit or for the
benefit of any Person, any Confidential Information.

(2) All devices, disks, tapes or electronic, digital or other media and all
documentation, drawings, blueprints, notes, memoranda, specifications,
documents or any other tangible embodiments of any Confidential Information,
will, as of the Closing, be the sole property of the Company Group and its
Subsidiaries and if such items are possessed by the Covenantor or a Seller
Affiliate, the Covenantor will promptly deliver such items, or will cause such
items to be delivered, to the Company Group and its Subsidiaries, subject to a
right to retain to the extent reasonably necessary to provide services under
the Transition Services Agreement during the term of such agreement.

(3) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this Agreement, if
the Covenantor or any Seller Affiliate is required to disclose any
Confidential Information under Law or by a Governmental Authority, the
Covenantor will, or will cause each such Seller Affiliate to, provide to the
Buyers written notice of any such requirement (and the terms and conditions
thereof) so that the Buyers or the Company Group may seek a protective order
or other appropriate remedy or waive compliance with the terms of this
Agreement. In the event that such protective order or other remedy is not
obtained, or that the Buyers or the Company Group elect(s) to waive compliance
with the terms of this Agreement, the Covenantor or a Seller Affiliate, as
applicable, may disclose only that portion of the Confidential Information
which is, in the opinion of counsel to the Buyers, legally required to be
disclosed; provided, however, that the Covenantor will, or will cause such
Seller Affiliate to, as applicable, give to the Buyers written notice of the
Confidential Information to be so disclosed as far in advance of its
disclosure as is practicable and will obtain assurances that confidential
treatment will be awarded to the Confidential Information to be disclosed.

(4) The foregoing shall not be deemed to prevent the Covenantor from retaining
and using Confidential Information, and providing such Confidential
Information to [his] 

[its] counsel, accountants and financial advisers, to the extent reasonably
necessary in connection with the exercise by Seller Affiliates of their rights
under Sections 2.3 (Closing Cash Proceeds Adjustment) and in connection with
the preparation of Tax Returns pursuant to Section 9.8 (Tax Matters) of the
Stock and Asset Purchase Agreement

| 
---|--- 

10.

|

Remedy 

The Covenantor acknowledges that any breach of any of the covenants set forth
in Sections 5, 6, 7 or 9 may result in irreparable injury to the Buyers and
the Company Group and its Subsidiaries, the exact amount of which may be
difficult to ascertain, and that remedies at law for any such breach may not
be reasonable or adequate compensation to the Buyers and the Company Group and
its Subsidiaries for such a breach. Accordingly, the parties hereto agree that
nothing in this Agreement will limit the Buyers' right, on behalf of
themselves or of the Company Group and its Subsidiaries (a) to benefit from
all recourses in equity, including any temporary or permanent injunctive
relief or other remedy to have any breach of this Agreement cease for the
future, and (b) to seek specific performance of the obligations contained in
this Agreement.

| 
---|--- 

11.

|

Enforceability and Severability 

(1) The Covenantor acknowledges that this Agreement is an integral part of the
Transaction and that the Buyers would not have entered into the Stock and
Asset Purchase Agreement had the Covenantor not provided the restrictive
covenants contained in this Agreement. The Covenantor has carefully considered
the nature and extent of the restrictive covenants set forth in this Agreement
and agrees that the same are just and reasonable, including with respect to
duration, geographical area and scope of activity, and necessary to protect
the Company Group and its Subsidiaries' legitimate interests. The Covenantor
hereby expressly covenants to the granting of such remedies, including
injunctive relief, in favour of the Buyers, the Company Group and its
Subsidiaries as may be applicable in the circumstances in the event of any
breach or threatened breach of any of the covenants set forth in Sections 5,
6, 7 or 9.

(2) Without limiting the foregoing paragraphs of this Section 11, whenever
possible, each provision of this Agreement will be interpreted in such manner
as to be effective and valid under Law, but if any provision of this Agreement
is held to be prohibited by or invalid under Law, such provision will be
ineffective only to the extent of such prohibition or invalidity, without
invalidating the remainder of such provision or the remaining provisions of
this Agreement, so long as the economic or legal substance of the transactions
contemplated hereby is not affected in any manner materially adverse to any
party hereto, and upon such a holding, the parties hereto will negotiate in
good faith to modify this Agreement so as to effect the original intent of the
parties hereto as closely as possible in an acceptable manner in order that
the transactions contemplated hereby be consummated as originally contemplated
to the fullest extent possible.

| 
---|--- 

12.

|

Further Assurances 

From time to time, as and when requested by any party hereto and at such 

party's expense, any other party hereto will execute and deliver, or cause to
be executed and delivered, all such documents and instruments and will take,
or cause to be taken, all such further or other actions as such requesting
party may reasonably deem necessary or desirable to evidence or effectuate the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement.

| 
---|--- 

13.

|

Complete Agreement 

This Agreement contains the complete agreement among the parties hereto and
supersede any prior understandings, agreements or representations by or among
the parties hereto, written or oral, which may have related to the subject
matter hereof in any way.

| 
---|--- 

14.

|

Amendment and Waivers 

This Agreement may be amended, supplemented or changed and any provision of
this Agreement may be waived only in a writing signed by the parties hereto.
No waiver of any provision hereunder or any breach or default thereof will
operate or be construed as a further or continuing waiver of such breach or
default or as a waiver of any other or subsequent breach or default. No
failure on the part of any party hereto to exercise, and no delay in
exercising, any right, power or remedy hereunder will operate as a waiver
thereof, or will any single or partial exercise of such right, power or remedy
by such party preclude any other or further exercise thereof or the exercise
of any other right, power or remedy.

contemplated hereby other than in any such court and (c) agrees that a final
judgment in any such Action will be conclusive and may be enforced in other

PARTY HERETO HEREBY KNOWINGLY, INTENTIONALLY AND VOLUNTARILY AND WITH AND UPON
THE ADVICE OF COMPETENT COUNSEL IRREVOCABLY WAIVES ALL RIGHT TO TRIAL BY JURY

(I) THIS AGREEMENT OR THE VALIDITY, PERFORMANCE, INTERPRETATION, COLLECTION OR
ENFORCEMENT HEREOF, (II) THE TRANSACTIONS CONTEMPLATED HEREBY OR (III) THE
ACTIONS OF SUCH PARTY IN THE NEGOTIATION, AUTHORIZATION, EXECUTION, DELIVERY,
ADMINISTRATION, PERFORMANCE OR ENFORCEMENT HEREOF. EACH PARTY HERETO (1)
CERTIFIES THAT NO REPRESENTATIVE, AGENT OR ATTORNEY OF ANY OTHER PARTY HERETO

NOT, IN THE EVENT OF LITIGATION, SEEK TO ENFORCE THE FOREGOING WAIVER AND (2)

Exhibit C

Rules of Engagement for Accounting Firm

If an Accounting Firm is engaged pursuant to Section 2.3(e), the Buyers and
the Sellers will instruct the Accounting Firm to analyze and resolve the
Parties' dispute in accordance with the following guidelines (which guidelines
and relevant portions of this Agreement the Accounting Firm will be required
to review and commit to acting in accordance with):

Timetable

The timetable for these proceedings will be governed by the following
procedures:

| 
---|--- 

•

|

Within 14 days after retaining the Accounting Firm, the Buyers and the Sellers
shall submit to the Accounting Firm five copies of a memorandum (which may
include supporting exhibits) setting forth their respective positions of all
unresolved disputed items in accordance with Section 2.3(e) (the "Initial
Report"). 

| 
---|--- 

•

|

Within one Business Day after receipt of both the Buyers' and the Sellers'
Initial Reports, the Accounting Firm will distribute a copy of each Initial
Report to the other party. 

| 
---|--- 

•

|

Within 14 days after receiving the other party's Initial Report from the
Accounting Firm, each of the Buyers and the Sellers shall submit to the
Accounting Firm either (a) five copies of a memorandum responding to the
Initial Report submitted to the Accounting Firm by the other party (the
"Rebuttal Report") or (b) written notice waiving the right to file such
report. The Rebuttal Report is to be responsive solely to the arguments
raised, and information submitted, by the other party in its Initial Report
and no party may introduce new arguments or rely on new information in the
Rebuttal Report that was not part of such party's Initial Report or which are
not directly responsive to an argument raised by the other party's Initial
Report, except to the extent such new arguments or new information are used in
direct response to arguments raised and information submitted by the other
party in its Initial Report. 

| 
---|--- 

•

|

Within one Business Day after receipt of both the Buyers' and the Sellers'
Rebuttal Reports, the Accounting Firm will distribute a copy of each Rebuttal
Report to the other party. 

| 
---|--- 

•

|

At any time before or within 14 days after the submission of the Initial
Reports or any Rebuttal Reports by the Buyers and the Sellers, the Accounting
Firm may submit written questions to either party following the procedures set
forth below in the Section titled "Submission of Questions by the Accounting
Firm." 

| 
---|--- 

•

|

Upon receipt of the Rebuttal Report or notice waiving the right to file such
report from both the Buyers and the Sellers and receipt of all responses to
any written questions submitted by the Accounting Firm (and responses
thereto), the Accounting Firm will endeavor to issue a report containing its
findings within 14 days after the later of (a) receiving both the Buyers' and
the Sellers' Rebuttal Reports or notice waiving the right to file such report,
as applicable, or (b) any responses (if any) to any written questions
submitted by the Accounting Firm to either party following the procedures set
forth below in the Section titled "Submission of Questions by the Accounting
Firm." 

| 
---|--- 

•

|

Unless requested by the Accounting Firm in writing pursuant to the terms of
the Section titled "Submission of Questions by the Accounting Firm", neither
the Buyers nor the Sellers may present any additional information or arguments
to the Accounting Firm, either orally or in writing. 

| 
---|--- 

•

|

The Accounting Firm shall render its decision without conducting a hearing. 

Submission of Questions by the Accounting Firm

After receiving both Initial Reports and Rebuttal Reports, if any, the
Accounting Firm may submit written questions to the Parties for written
responses or may direct requests for additional information, calculations, or
supporting documentation to the Parties reasonably needed by the Accounting
Firm in order to clarify or understand any position or argument made by a
Party in its written submission, in which case the Parties agree to cooperate
with such requests (including by ensuring that the Accounting Firm is provided
copies of all relevant books and records of the Company Group and its
Subsidiaries) in the manner and procedural timing described in this paragraph.
If any such questions are addressed to only one Party, the Accounting Firm
shall submit the questions to that Party, with a copy to the other Parties.
Once received, the Party to whom the questions are addressed shall have five
Business Days to answer the Accounting Firm's questions, and shall provide a
copy of its written answers to the other Party at the time they are provided
to the Accounting Firm. In response thereto, the other Party may, within five
Business Days, submit a response to such answer(s) to the Accounting Firm and
shall provide a copy of a response to the other Party at the time it is
provided to the Accounting Firm. If any such questions are addressed to both
Parties, each Party shall have five Business Days from the date of receipt to
respond to the Accounting Firm and shall provide a copy of its written answers
to the other Party at the time they are provided to the Accounting Firm. In
response thereto, each Party may, within five Business Days, submit a response
to the other Party's answer(s) to the Accounting Firm and shall provide a copy
to the other Party at the time it is provided to the Accounting Firm.

Adjustment of Time Periods

If the due date for any written submissions to be submitted to the Accounting
Firm falls on a day that is not a Business Day, the written submission shall
take place on the next Business Day.

Communication between the Accounting Firm and the Parties

The Parties agree not to engage in any ex parte communication with the
Accounting Firm.

The Accounting Firm will be required to include a representation in its
engagement letter that it has not discussed the disputed matter with either
Party prior to its joint retention by the Parties, and to include a covenant
in its engagement letter not to engage in ex parte communications with either
Party throughout the course of the engagement.

The engagement letter will specifically require the Accounting Firm to review
Section 2.3 as well as any other provisions of this Agreement deemed relevant
by any of the Buyers, the Sellers or the Accounting Firm.

Nature of Review by Accounting Firm

The Accounting Firm will make its determination in an objective, impartial
manner based on inquiry, investigation, and other procedures as it, in its
sole discretion may deem necessary, but in all cases consistent with the terms
of this Agreement and this Exhibit C.

The Accounting Firm shall agree that between the time the Sellers delivered
the Objection Notice to the Buyers and the date hereof, the Buyers and the
Sellers may have exchanged certain proposals relating to the disputed items
that were intended solely for purposes of facilitating settlement discussions
and such proposals were confidential and were provided solely on the condition
and understanding that such proposals would not be permitted to be disclosed
in any court or arbitration hearing, including with respect to the Accounting
Firm's engagement in the dispute. The Accounting Firm will be instructed to
disregard any evidence of such settlement proposals and negotiations in its
consideration of the disputed matter. 

Confidentiality

With respect to any information supplied in connection with the Accounting
Firm's engagement and designated by either Party as confidential, or which
either Party should reasonably believe is confidential based on the subject
matter or the circumstances of its disclosure, the other Party agrees to
protect such confidential information in a reasonable and appropriate manner,
and use such confidential information only to perform its obligations under
this Agreement and for no other purpose. This will not apply to information
which is: (a) publicly known, (b) already known to the recipient without
breach by the recipient of any obligation of confidentiality, (c) lawfully
disclosed by a third party, (d) independently developed without use or
referring to any confidential information or (e) disclosed pursuant to legal
requirement or order (it being understood that any confidential information
that must be disclosed pursuant to legal requirement or order shall remain,
and shall continue to be treated as, confidential information).
Notwithstanding the foregoing, no information (whether or not designated as
confidential) may be provided to the Accounting Firm without being made
available to all Parties in accordance with the requirements of this Agreement
and this Exhibit C. The Accounting Firm shall not publicly disclose that it
has been retained to resolve any dispute relating to this Agreement or that
the Parties are involved in the dispute, or any information relating to the
dispute, including any Party's or the Accounting Firm's determination of the
computation of the Closing Cash Proceeds, including each component thereof.

At the conclusion of the engagement contemplated hereby, any confidential
information made available hereunder, including copies thereof, shall be
returned or destroyed upon request by the disclosing Party.

Other Procedural Matters

Procedural matters for the conduct of the dispute resolution, other than as
specified herein, will be determined by the Accounting Firm in consultation
with the Buyers and the Sellers; provided, however, that any such procedural
matters shall in all cases be consistent with the terms of this Agreement and
this Exhibit C. 

Exhibit D

See attached.

transactions contemplated in the Stock and Asset Purchase Agreement on the
date of this Release (the "Release Date"), in [his/its] capacity as a direct
or indirect shareholder, director, officer, employee or creditor of the

written or oral contracts, agreements or other commitments, or otherwise, and
any and all claims in respect of moneys advanced, fees (including directors'

profit or earnings participation, stock options, appreciation rights, vacation
pay, commissions or similar compensation or other expenses or claims under any
applicable corporate, securities or other laws or under written or oral
contracts, agreements or other commitments, or otherwise, provided that the
foregoing shall not serve to release: (i) any rights of the Releaser to
indemnification or reimbursement from the Company Group or any of its
Subsidiaries, whether pursuant to its certificate or articles of
incorporation, by‑laws or other organizational documents, in respect of the
Releaser's service as director or officer in accordance with the terms and
conditions of Section 9.4 of the Stock and Asset Purchase Agreement, or (ii)
rights of the Releaser under the Stock and Asset Purchase Agreement, the
Transition Services Agreement, the Escrow Agreement or the Non-Competition and
Non-Solicitation Agreement.1

The Releaser agrees not to join, assist, aid or act in concert in any manner
whatsoever with any other person in the making of claims or demands or in the
bringing of suits, proceedings or actions in any manner whatsoever against any
of the Released Parties and not to make claims or demands nor bring suits,
proceedings or actions in any manner whatsoever against any person who might

Guarantors will contain references to the agreements listed in clause (ii) to
which they are actually a party. 

from, in respect of or in connection with any of the maters released and
discharged by this Release.

condition to the obligation of the Buyers to consummate the transactions
contemplated by the Stock and Asset Purchase Agreement and the Buyers are
relying on this Release in consummating the transactions contemplated by the
Stock and Asset Purchase Agreement.

It is the intention of the Releaser that this Release be effective as a full
and final accord and satisfaction and as a bar to all of the Releaser's
claims, actions, causes of action, suits, proceedings and demands against any
of the Released Parties, of whatsoever nature, character or kind, known or
unknown, suspected or unsuspected, as of the Release Date, arising from, in
respect of or in connection with any of the matters released and discharged by
this Release. The Releaser is aware that [he/it] may hereafter discover claims
or facts in addition to or different from those which [he/it] knows or
believes to exist with respect to the subject matter of this Release, but it
is the Releaser's intention to hereby fully, finally and forever settle,
release and discharge each of the Released Parties from all matters arising
prior to the Release Date arising from, in respect of or in connection with

contemplated hereby is not affected in any manner materially adverse to any
party hereto, and upon such a holding, the parties hereto will negotiate in
good faith to modify this Release so as to effect the original intent of the
parties hereto as closely as possible in an acceptable manner in order that
the transactions contemplated hereby be consummated as originally contemplated
to the fullest extent possible.

and enforceability of this Release, and all Actions arising hereunder or
thereunder or in connection herewith or therewith, whether purporting to be
sound in contract or tort, or at law or in equity, will be governed by, and

exclusive jurisdiction of the any federal court or state court located in King
County, Washington (and in each case of the appropriate appellate courts
therefrom), and hereby waive the right to assert the lack of personal or
subject matter jurisdiction or improper venue in connection with any such
Action. In furtherance of the foregoing, the parties hereto (a) waive the
defense of inconvenient forum, (b) agree not to commence any Action arising

ENFORCEMENT HEREOF, (B) THE TRANSACTIONS CONTEMPLATED HEREBY OR (C) THE

U.S. LLC, Kadant Canada Corp., Kadant UK Co. Ltd., Kadant Johnson Europe B.V.
(collectively, the "Buyers"), NII FPG Company, Nicholson Intellectual
Property, Inc., Cascade Natural Resources, Inc., the Customer and the Service
Provider, the Buyers are acquiring on the date hereof the Shares and Kadant
Northern U.S. LLC is acquiring on the date hereof the VFR Patent Assets.

WHEREAS the Buyers are direct or indirect wholly owned subsidiaries of the
Customer and the Customer is the guarantor of the payment and performance by
the Buyers of their obligations under the Stock and Asset Purchase Agreement
as provided therein;

WHEREAS the entry into this Agreement by the Service Provider constitutes a
material inducement to the Buyers to consummate, and a condition precedent to
the Buyers' obligation to consummate, the Transaction. The Service Provider's
obligations pursuant to this Agreement are an integral part of the
Transaction.

NOW, THEREFORE, in consideration of the covenants and agreements herein
contained, the parties hereto hereby agree as follows:

| 
---|--- 

1.

|

Adoption of Recitals 

The parties hereto adopt the foregoing recitals and agree and affirm that
construction of this Agreement will be guided thereby.

| 
---|--- 

2.

|

Definitions 

Capitalized terms not defined herein will have the respective meanings
ascribed to such terms in the Stock and Asset Purchase Agreement.

| 
---|--- 

3.

|

Headings 

The division of this Agreement into Articles and Sections and the insertion of
headings are for convenience of reference only and do not affect the
construction or interpretation of this Agreement. The terms "hereof",
"hereunder", "herein", "hereto" and similar expressions refer to this
Agreement and not to any particular Article, Section or other portion hereof.
Unless something in the subject matter or context is inconsistent therewith,
references herein to Articles and Sections are to Articles and Sections of
this Agreement.

Services 

(1) Pursuant to this Agreement, the Service Provider hereby agrees (i) during
the Accounting Services Term, to provide to the Customer the accounting
services listed and described in Schedule A hereto (collectively, the
"Accounting Services") and (ii) during the IT Services Term, to provide to the
Customer the IT services listed and described in Schedule B hereto
(collectively, the "IT Services", and, collectively with the Accounting
Services, the "Services"), the whole so as to facilitate the transfer and
continued operation of certain activities following the Closing.

(2) The Service Provider will provide (i) the Accounting Services to the
Customer as of the date hereof until the end of the Accounting Services Term
and (ii) the IT Services to the Customer as of the date hereof until the end
of the IT Services Term, unless this Agreement is earlier terminated by the
Customer in accordance with Section 10.

| 
---|--- 

5.

|

Manner and Use of Services 

The standard of care for the provision of the Services by the Service Provider
hereunder will be no less than the level of care, skill, quality, timeliness
and cost-effectiveness substantially similar as the Service Provider provided
such Services in relation to the Business prior to the date hereof and as may
be reasonably directed by the Customer from time to time, subject to the
provisions of the next paragraph in this Section 5. The Service Provider
agrees to assign sufficient resources and qualified personnel as are
reasonably required to perform the Services in accordance with the standards
set forth in the preceding sentence, subject to the Force Majeure provisions
of this Agreement. In the event that the Customer elects to transition the
Services to another location, the Services Provider will provide assistance to
the Customer in such transition. The parties hereto will use good faith
efforts to cooperate with each other in all matters relating to the provision
and receipt of the Services.

It is anticipated that the quantity and level of services provided during the
Term will be essentially the same as provided by the Service Provider to the
Business prior to the date hereof. If the Customer or its Affiliates make
additional requests or inquiries or otherwise seeks an additional quantity or
level of service, Customer acknowledges that Service Provider may not have the
resources to respond to such requests or inquiries or provide such additional
quantity or level of service and if it does, the Service Fees will need to be
appropriately adjusted. In addition, if as a result of a Customer request,
Service Provider personnel is required to travel or Service Provider is
required to incur out-of-pocket costs that it would not have incurred in
providing the same quantity or level of services prior to the date hereof,
Customer shall reimburse Service Provider for such travel or out-of-pocket
costs.

| 
---|--- 

6.

|

Term 

Unless terminated as provided for in Section 10, the Service Provider will
provide (i) the Accounting Services commencing as of the date hereof and
continuing thereafter up to and including the date that is 8 months after the
date hereof (the "Accounting Services 

Term") and (ii) the IT Services commencing as of the date hereof and
continuing thereafter up to and including the date that is 4 months after the
date hereof (the "IT Services Term", and, collectively with the Accounting
Services Term, the "Term").

| 
---|--- 

7.

|

Compensation 

The Service Provider will provide the Services to the Customer during the
applicable Term on a flat rate basis as set forth in Schedule C hereto (the
"Service Fees"). Such amounts will be prorated on a daily basis for the first
and last months during which this Agreement is in effect. The rates set forth
in Schedule C shall be subject to appropriate adjustment pursuant to the
provisions of Section 5 or in the event Service Provider's costs are increased
by reason of normal pay adjustments for its personnel (Service Provider's pay
is adjusted each July 1 and Service Provider anticipates a 3% increase at that
time) and for increases imposed by third parties on cost inputs for the
Services (for example, increases in property taxes or utility charges).

| 
---|--- 

8.

|

Payment Terms 

The Service Provider will render an invoice for the Service Fees following the
end of the month in which the applicable Services were provided (each, a
"Statement"). The Customer will pay all amounts indicated as due and payable
on each Statement no later than 10 days after receipt of each invoice.

| 
---|--- 

9.

|

Taxes 

The Customer will pay to the Service Provider all applicable sales and
Washington BandO taxes payable with respect to the provision of the Services by
the Service Provider, and the Service Provider will be responsible for
remitting such amount to the appropriate Governmental Authority.

| 
---|--- 

10.

|

Termination 

(1) This Agreement will terminate on the earlier to occur of (i) the last day
of the Accounting Services Term and the IT Services Term, or (ii) the date on
which this Agreement is terminated pursuant to any of the following
paragraphs:

| 
---|--- 

(a)

|

this Agreement may be terminated upon the written mutual consent of the
Customer and the Service Provider; 

| 
---|--- 

(b)

|

the Customer may terminate this Agreement by sending a 30-day prior written
notice to the Service Provider; 

| 
---|--- 

(c)

|

each party hereto may terminate this Agreement in the event of a material
default by the other party hereto in the performance of its obligations
hereunder, which material default remains uncured for a period of 30 days
following notice to that effect from the other party hereto; or 

| 
---|--- 

(d)

|

this Agreement will terminate without notice or other action required of
either of the parties hereto if an order of a court is made or a petition is
filed in court for the winding-up, dissolution or liquidation of either of the
parties hereto, or if either of the parties hereto becomes insolvent, files a
petition in bankruptcy or if any execution, distress, sequestration or any
other court process becomes enforceable against any of the parties hereto, or
if either process involving seizure and sale is levied upon the property of
either of the parties hereto 

(2) The Customer will have the right, in its sole discretion, to terminate the
Accounting Services or the IT Services by sending a 30-day prior written
notice to the Service Provider. The parties may also reduce any of the
Accounting Services or any of the IT Services and the applicable Service Fees
by mutual agreement.

| 
---|--- 

11.

|

Indemnity; Limitations on Liability; Force Majeure 

Each party hereto (the "Indemnifying Party") will indemnify, defend and hold
harmless the other party hereto and its directors, officers, employees and
agents (individually, an "Indemnified Party") from and against any claims,
demands, actions, causes of action, judgments, damages (excluding special,
indirect, incidental or consequential damages), losses, liabilities, costs or
expenses (including, without limitation, interest, penalties and reasonable
attorneys' and experts' fees and disbursements) which may be made against any
Indemnified Party or which any Indemnified Party may suffer or incur as a
result of, arising out of, or relating to, any breach of this Agreement by the
Indemnifying Party.

Under no circumstances shall either party be liable to the other for special,
indirect, incidental or consequential damages. Except with respect to damages
due to Service Provider's intentional misconduct or gross negligence, Service
Provider shall not be liable to the Customer under or in connection with this
Agreement, whether pursuant to the first part of this Section 11 or otherwise,
for any amount in excess of the fees paid by Customer to Service Provider
pursuant to this Agreement plus the amount of insurance available to the
Service Provider in respect of such damages.

Service Provider shall not be deemed in breach of this Agreement in the event
it is prevented from providing Services by reason of Act of God or any other
event beyond its reasonable control that customarily constitutes a Force
Majeure event. For these purposes, a Force Majeure event shall include a loss
of personnel providing IT Services for reasons outside of the Service
Provider's control, such as recruitment by a third party. Customer
acknowledges that in Service Provider's circumstances, it would be
impracticable to replace such lost personnel; provided, however, that the
Service Provider shall cooperate with Customer's efforts to obtain outsourced
support to replace or compensate for in full or in part such loss of personnel
or to transfer such functions to the Customer. Service Provider shall give to
the Customer prompt notice of any event constituting a Force Majeure event. 

| 
---|--- 

12.

|

Severability 

Whenever possible, each provision of this Agreement will be interpreted in
such manner as to be effective and valid under Law, but if any provision of
this Agreement is held to be prohibited by or invalid under Law, such
provision will be ineffective only to the extent of such prohibition or
invalidity, without invalidating the remainder of such provision or the
remaining provisions of this Agreement, so long as the economic or legal
substance of the transactions contemplated hereby is not affected in any
manner materially adverse to either party hereto, and upon such a holding, the
parties hereto will negotiate in good faith to modify this Agreement so as to
effect the original intent of the parties hereto as closely as possible in an
acceptable manner in order that the transactions contemplated hereby be
consummated as originally contemplated to the fullest extent possible.

| 
---|--- 

13.

|

Further Assurances 

From time to time, as and when requested by either party hereto and at such
party's expense, any other party hereto will execute and deliver, or cause to
be executed and delivered, all such documents and instruments and will take,
or cause to be taken, all such further or other actions as such requesting
party may reasonably deem necessary or desirable to evidence or effectuate the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement.

| 
---|--- 

14.

|

Complete Agreement 

This Agreement contains the complete agreement between the parties hereto and
supersede any prior understandings, agreements or representations by or
between the parties hereto, written or oral, which may have related to the
subject matter hereof in any way.

15.

|

Amendment and Waivers 

This Agreement may be amended, supplemented or changed and any provision of
this Agreement may be waived only in a writing signed by the parties hereto.
No waiver of any provision hereunder or any breach or default thereof will
operate or be construed as a further or continuing waiver of such breach or
default or as a waiver of any other or subsequent breach or default. No
failure on the part of any party to exercise, and no delay in exercising, any
right, power or remedy hereunder will operate as a waiver thereof, or will any
single or partial exercise of such right, power or remedy by such party
preclude any other or further exercise thereof or the exercise of any other
right, power or remedy.

Governing Law; Waiver of Jury Trial 

All issues and questions concerning the construction, validity, interpretation
and enforceability of this Agreement and the exhibits and schedules hereto,
and all Actions arising hereunder or thereunder or in connection herewith or
therewith, whether purporting to be sound in contract or tort, or at law or in
equity, will be governed by, and construed in accordance with, the Laws of the
state of Washington, without giving effect to any choice of law or conflict of
law rules or provisions (whether of the state of Washington or any other
jurisdiction) that would cause the application of the Laws of any jurisdiction
other than the state of Washington. The parties hereto hereby agree and
consent to be subject to the exclusive jurisdiction of the any federal court
or state court located in King County, Washington (and in each case of the
appropriate appellate courts therefrom), and hereby waive the right to assert
the lack of personal or subject matter jurisdiction or improper venue in
connection with any such Action. In furtherance of the foregoing, each of the
parties hereto (a) waives the defense of inconvenient forum, (b) agrees not to
commence any Action arising out of this Agreement or any transactions
contemplated hereby other than in any such court and (c) agrees that a final
judgment in any such Action will be conclusive and may be enforced in other

Process in any such Action may be served on either party hereto anywhere in
the world, whether within or without the jurisdiction of any such court. EACH
PARTY HERETO HEREBY KNOWINGLY, INTENTIONALLY AND VOLUNTARILY AND WITH AND UPON
THE ADVICE OF COMPETENT COUNSEL IRREVOCABLY WAIVES ALL RIGHT TO TRIAL BY JURY
IN ANY ACTION, CROSS‑CLAIM OR COUNTERCLAIM IN ANY COURT (WHETHER BASED ON

(I) THIS AGREEMENT OR THE VALIDITY, PERFORMANCE, INTERPRETATION, COLLECTION OR
ENFORCEMENT HEREOF, (II) THE TRANSACTIONS CONTEMPLATED HEREBY OR (III) THE
ACTIONS OF SUCH PARTY IN THE NEGOTIATION, AUTHORIZATION, EXECUTION, DELIVERY,
ADMINISTRATION, 

PERFORMANCE OR ENFORCEMENT HEREOF. EACH PARTY HERETO (1) CERTIFIES THAT NO
REPRESENTATIVE, AGENT OR ATTORNEY OF THE OTHER PARTY HERETO HAS REPRESENTED,
EXPRESSLY OR OTHERWISE, THAT SUCH OTHER PARTY WOULD NOT, IN THE EVENT OF
LITIGATION, SEEK TO ENFORCE THE FOREGOING WAIVER AND (2) ACKNOWLEDGES THAT IT
AND THE OTHER PARTY HERETO HAVE BEEN INDUCED TO ENTER INTO THIS AGREEMENT BY,
AMONG OTHER THINGS, THE MUTUAL WAIVERS AND CERTIFICATIONS IN THIS SECTION.

Electronic Delivery; Counterparts 

This Agreement and any signed agreement or instrument entered into in
connection with this Agreement, and any amendments hereto or thereto, may be
executed in one or more counterparts, all of which will constitute one and the
same instrument. Any such counterpart, to the extent delivered by means of a
facsimile machine or by .pdf, .tif, .gif, .jpeg or similar attachment to
electronic mail (any such delivery, an "Electronic Delivery") will be treated
in all manner and respects as an original executed counterpart and will be
considered to have the same binding legal effect as if it were the original
signed version thereof delivered in person. At the reasonable request of
either party hereto, the other party hereto or thereto will re-execute the
original form of this Agreement and deliver such form to the other party
hereto. Neither party hereto will raise the use of Electronic Delivery to

was transmitted or communicated through the use of Electronic Delivery as a
defense to the formation of a contract, and each such party forever waives any
such defense, except to the extent such defense relates to lack of
authenticity.

THIS CONSENT TO ASSIGNMENT AND AMENDMENT TO LEASE (this "Consent"), dated as
of May 24, 2017, is entered into by and among SWN PELL CITY, LLC, a Washington
limited liability company ("Landlord") and NICHOLSON MANUFACTURING
CORPORATION, a Washington corporation ("Tenant").

W I T N E S S E T H

WHEREAS, Landlord and Tenant are parties to that certain Month-to-Month
Industrial Lease with Option to Renew for a Term of Years dated October 1,
2016 (the "Lease") with respect to certain premises (as more particularly
described in the Lease, the "Premises");

WHEREAS, Tenant intends to consummate a transaction in which 100% of its stock
will be acquired by Kadant Northern U.S. LLC and is therefore considered a
Change in Control (as defined in the Lease) for which Tenant must obtain
Landlord's prior written consent;

WHEREAS, Landlord is willing to consent to such Change in Control on the terms
and conditions hereinafter set forth; and

WHEREAS, effective as of the 100% sale of Tenant's stock (the "Amendment
Effective Date"), Landlord and Tenant wish to amend the Lease as hereinafter
set forth.

NOW, THEREFORE, in consideration of the covenants herein reserved and
contained, and other good and valuable consideration, the receipt and
sufficiency of which are hereby acknowledged and agreed, Landlord and Tenant
hereby agree as follows:

| 
---|--- 

1.

|

Recitals; Capitalized Terms. The foregoing recitals are hereby incorporated by
reference. All capitalized terms not otherwise defined herein shall have the

the following: 

"7.3.2 Certificates of Insurance. Tenant shall deliver to Landlord
certificates of insurance for all insurance required to be maintained by
Tenant no later than seven (7) days prior to possession of the Premises.
Tenant shall, at least ten (10) days prior to expiration of the policy,

|

Section 11 of the Lease is hereby deleted in its entirety and replaced with
the following: 

"11\. ENVIRONMENTAL MATTERS.

11.1 Hazardous Materials.

Tenant shall not cause nor permit, nor allow any of Tenant's employees,
agents, customers, visitors, invitees, licensees, contractors, service
providers, assignees or subtenants (collectively, "Tenant's Parties") to cause
or permit, any Hazardous Materials to be manufactured, recycled, treated,
disposed, discharged, released or used on, under or about Premises, the
Building, except for those Hazardous Materials used in Tenant's business and
those used that are for routine office and janitorial supplies in usual and
customary quantities stored, used and disposed of in accordance with all
applicable Environmental Laws. Furthermore, Tenant shall not cause nor permit
nor allow any of the Tenant Parties to cause or permit Hazardous Materials to
be brought upon, stored, generated, blended or handled on, under or about the
Premises, or the Building, except in accordance with all applicable
Environmental Laws and all other rules and regulations, including, but not
limited to, all local, state and federal laws, rules and regulations. As used
herein, "Hazardous Materials" means any chemical, substance, material,
controlled substance, object, condition, waste, living organism or combination
thereof which is or may be hazardous to human health or safety or to the
environment due to its radioactivity, ignitability, corrosivity, reactivity,
explosivity, toxicity, carcinogenicity, mutagenicity, phytotoxicity,
infectiousness or other harmful or potentially harmful properties or effects,
including, without limitation, petroleum and petroleum products, asbestos,
radon, polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs) and all of those chemicals,
substances, materials, controlled substances, objects, conditions, wastes,
living organisms or combinations thereof which are now or become in the future
listed, defined or regulated in any manner by any Environmental Law based
upon, directly or indirectly, such properties or effects. As used herein,
"Environmental Laws" means any and all federal, state or local environmental,
health and/or safety-related laws, regulations, standards, decisions of
courts, ordinances, rules, codes, orders, decrees, directives, guidelines,
permits or permit conditions, currently existing and as amended, enacted,
issued or adopted in the future which are or become applicable to Tenant, the
Premises, the Building, the Common Area. Tenant and Tenant's Parties shall
comply with all Environmental Laws and promptly notify Landlord of the
violation of any Environmental Law or presence of any Hazardous Materials,
other than those Hazardous Materials used in Tenant's business and office and
janitorial supplies as permitted above, on the Premises. Landlord shall have
the right to enter upon and inspect the Premises and to conduct tests,
monitoring and investigations. If such tests indicate the presence of any
environmental condition which occurred after the Amendment Effective Date but
prior to the termination of this Lease (and such condition was not caused by
Landlord or a third-party who does not qualify as a Tenant Party), Tenant
shall reimburse Landlord for the cost of conducting such tests. The phrase
"environmental condition" shall mean any adverse condition relating to any
Hazardous Materials or the environment that is unlawful under applicable
Environmental Laws. In the event of any such environmental condition which
occurred after the Amendment Effective Date but prior to the termination of

Schedule III

See attached. 

Schedule III

Target Net Working Capital and Accounting Methods

Determination of Target Net Working Capital

Capitalized terms used but not defined in this Schedule shall have the
respective meanings ascribed thereto in the Agreement. "Target Net Working
Capital" shall be determined as follows:

| 
---|--- 

(a)

|

Target Net Working Capital shall be the average of the Net Working Capital on
the final day of each month during the 12-month period ending on March 31,
2017, with the determination of Net Working Capital being made in the six
currencies used by the Company Group and its Subsidiaries (namely U.S.
Dollars, Canadian Dollars, Euros, Swedish Kroner, Russian Rubles and Singapore
Dollars), as further illustrated on Exhibit III.A to this Schedule. Exhibit
III.A to this Schedule sets forth a calculation of the Net Working Capital for
the nine-month period ending on December 31, 2016 by applicable currency, as
agreed upon by the Parties. Net Working Capital as of the final day of each of
January, February and March 2017 shall be determined using the same accounts
and the same methodology as used in determining Net Working Capital for the
9-month period ending on December 31, 2016 on Exhibit III.A, in each case by
applicable currency. The Net Working Capital as so determined for the 3-month
period ending on March 31, 2017 and the 9-month period ending on December 31,
2016 shall then be averaged over the total 12-month period ending on March 31,
2017 by relevant applicable currency, yielding Target Net Working Capital in
each relevant applicable currency. 

| 
---|--- 

(b)

|

The Sellers shall provide to the Buyers in writing by June 12, 2017 their
calculation of Net Working Capital for the 3-month period ending on March 31,
2017 by applicable currency, and their determination of Target Net Working
Capital by applicable currency (the "Seller Target Proposal"). The Buyers
shall have 9 Business Days after receipt by the Buyers of the Seller Target
Proposal to review the Seller Target Proposal. For the purposes of this
review, the Sellers shall cause the Company Group and its Subsidiaries to
provide reasonable assistance to the Buyers and their representatives in their
review of the Seller Target Proposal (including by furnishing on a timely
basis all information reasonably necessary or useful in connection with such
review) and shall provide the Buyers and their representatives reasonable
access during normal business hours to the books, records (including work
papers, schedules, memoranda and other documents), supporting data and
relevant personnel of the Company Group and its Subsidiaries for purposes of
their review of the Seller Target Proposal. If the Buyers disagree with the
Seller Target Proposal, the Buyers shall by the end of such 9-Business-Day
period notify the Sellers in writing of such disagreement by setting forth the
Buyers' specific bases for objection to the Seller Target Proposal and the
Buyers' calculation of Target Net Working Capital (a "Target Objection
Notice"). If the Buyers do not deliver a Target Objection Notice within the
time period specified above, then the Sellers' determination of Target Net
Working Capital, as set forth in the Seller Target Proposal, shall be deemed
to have been accepted by the Buyers and shall be final and binding on all
Parties. If a Target Objection Notice is delivered to the Sellers, then the
Buyers and the Sellers shall negotiate in good faith to resolve their
disagreements with respect to the computation of Target Net Working Capital.
In the event that the Buyers and the Sellers are 

unable to resolve such disagreements within 10 days after the Sellers' receipt
of such Target Objection Notice (or such longer period as the Buyers and the
Sellers may agree in writing), the Buyers and the Sellers shall submit such
disagreements to the Accounting Firm.

| 
---|--- 

(c)

|

The Accounting Firm shall make a final and binding determination with respect
to the computation of Target Net Working Capital. The Accounting Firm shall be
directed to make its determination within fifteen Business Days after
submission of the matter to them and to the extent not inconsistent with the
foregoing and other provisions of this Schedule III, in accordance with the
guidelines and procedures set forth on Exhibit C to the Agreement, mutatis
mutandis. The Buyers and the Sellers shall cooperate with the Accounting Firm
during the term of its engagement and shall use reasonable best efforts to
cause the Accounting Firm to resolve all remaining disagreements with respect
to the computation of Target Net Working Capital. The Accounting Firm shall
consider only those items and amounts in the Sellers' and the Buyers'
respective calculations of Target Net Working Capital as set forth in the
Seller Target Proposal and in the Target Objection Notice, including each of
the components thereof, that are identified as being items and amounts to
which the Buyers and the Sellers have been unable to agree. In resolving any
disputed item, the Accounting Firm may not assign a value to any item greater
than the greatest value for such item claimed by either Party or less than the
smallest value for such item claimed by either Party, in each case as set
forth in the Seller Target Proposal and in the Target Objection Notice, as
applicable. The Accounting Firm's determination of Target Net Working Capital,
including each of the components thereof, shall be based solely on written
materials submitted by the Buyers and the Sellers (i.e., not on independent
review) and on the definitions, terms and conditions included in this Schedule
and in the Agreement. The determination of the Accounting Firm shall be
conclusive and binding upon the Parties and shall not be subject to appeal or
further review. The cost and expenses of the Accounting Firm in determining
Target Net Working Capital shall be borne by the Buyers, on the one hand, and
the Sellers, on the other hand on a 50-50 basis. 

Net Working Capital Principles

The current assets and current liabilities used in determining Net Working
Capital shall be those reflected in the accounts set forth Exhibit III.A to
this Schedule. Net Working Capital shall be determined eliminating all inter-
company transactions and in accordance with the other provisions of Exhibit
III.A to this Schedule and otherwise in accordance with the Accounting
Methods. Target Net Working Capital shall determined without taking into
account (a) any Company Group Transaction Expenses or (b) any fees or expenses
of the Sellers, the Seller Guarantors or any of their Affiliates which are not
the Company Group or any of its Subsidiaries or (c) to the extent not already
included in the immediately preceding clause (a), any of the sale transaction
or retention bonuses contemplated by the agreements identified in Section
6.12(f) of the Disclosure Schedules. In determining Closing Net Working
Capital, (i) the sale transaction bonuses contemplated by the two agreements
with Douglas B. Jeffrey and Simo Jutila identified in Section 6.12(f) of the
Disclosure Schedules and the related employer and other employment-related
Taxes and benefits in connection therewith, as further provided for in the
Agreement, and (ii) all other Company Group Transaction Expenses shall, in
each case, be accrued and treated as current liabilities, it being understood,
for the avoidance of doubt, that the retention bonuses contemplated by the
agreements with Douglas B. Jeffrey and Simo Jutila identified in Section
6.12(f) of the Disclosure 

Schedules shall not be accrued or treated as current liabilities in
determining Closing Net Working Capital and shall be and remain a
responsibility of the Company Group in accordance with the terms and
conditions of such retention bonuses included in such agreements (for
avoidance of doubt, the sales and retention bonus payable to Stephen D. Smith
shall, as a result of the release contemplated by the Agreement as a condition
to Closing, not be accrued or treated as a current liability in determining
Closing Net Working Capital and shall not otherwise be treated as a Company
Group Transaction Expense). 

Schedule III.A

Target Net Working Capital and Closing Net Working Capital shall factor in the
following adjustments:

| 
---|--- 

•

|

Exclude all cash, external Indebtedness, intercompany receivables/payables,
related party receivable/payables and income tax prepaid/accruals 

| 
---|--- 

•

|

Ensure cash balances have been reduced for any checks outstanding 

| 
---|--- 

•

|

Exclude aged accrued payables at Nicholson Manufacturing Co. related to Madill
royalty payments and EandY consulting fees 

| 
---|--- 

•

|

Exclude energy savings investment credit current liability at Valon Kone 

| 
---|--- 

•

|

Exclude auto loans and dividend payable at VN Services NV 

| 
---|--- 

•

|

Exclude accrued bonus, however the sale transaction bonuses contemplated by
the two agreements with Douglas B. Jeffrey and Simo Jutila shall be included
in the Closing Net Working Capital calculation
