the Surviving Corporation and the Stockholders Representative pursuant

payments made with respect to Company Options or Restricted Stock, to pay)

immediately available funds to such Escrow Equity Holders; or

 



12\. (ii) if the Estimated Cash Merger Consideration exceeds the Final Cash
Merger Consideration, the Escrow Agent shall, pursuant to the terms of the
Escrow Agreement, pay or cause to be paid such excess by wire transfer of
immediately available funds to a bank account designated in writing by Parent

Fund, the aggregate amount payable to Parent shall not be less than such
excess of the Estimated Cash Merger Consideration over the Final Cash Merger
Consideration).

reflect any changes to the amounts reflected thereon resulting from changes

1.11 Stock Options.

 

(a) Treatment of Options. All unvested Company Options will accelerate and
become fully vested prior to the Effective Time. Company Options will not be
continued, assumed or substituted for by the Company or Parent as part of the
Merger. At the Effective Time, each then-outstanding Company Option shall be
cancelled as follows: (i) in the case of a Company In the Money Option, such
Company In the Money Option shall be cancelled in exchange for the right to
receive from the Surviving Corporation for each share of Company Common Stock
subject to such Company In the Money Option immediately prior to
the Effective Time an amount (subject to any applicable withholding Tax) in
cash equal to the sum of (A) the product of (X) the number of shares of
Company Common Stock subject to such Company In the Money Option immediately
prior to the Effective Time and (Y) the amount by which the Per Common Share
Closing Merger Consideration exceeds the per share exercise price of such
Company In the Money Option plus (B) an allocable portion of any Post-Closing
Merger Consideration or (ii) in the case of a Company Option that is not a
Company In the Money Option, such Company Option shall be cancelled without
the payment of cash or issuance of other securities in respect thereof. The
cancellation of a Company Option as provided in the immediately preceding
sentence shall be deemed a release of any and all rights the holder thereof
had or may have had in respect of such Company Option. The aggregate amount
paid or payable in respect of the cancellation of the Company Options as set
forth in this Section 1.11(a) (including payments made pursuant to Section 1.7
and Section 1.9(f)(i)) is referred to herein as the " _Option Consideration_
_._ "

 

(b) Termination of the Company Option Plan. The Company Option Plan shall
terminate as of the Effective Time and the provisions in any other plan,
program or arrangement providing for the issuance or grant of any other
interest in respect of the Company Common Stock (or any capital stock of any
Subsidiary of the Company) shall be cancelled as of the Effective Time.
The Company shall ensure that following the Effective Time, no participant in
the Company Option Plan or other plans, programs or arrangements shall have
any right thereunder to acquire any equity securities of the Company, the
Surviving Corporation or any Subsidiary thereof.

(c) Option Consent Letter. Prior to the Effective Time, the Company shall
deliver to the holders of Company Options a letter in the form mutually
agreed upon by Parent and the Company (the " _Option Consent Letter_ "). Each
holder of Company Options shall be entitled to receive, when and if payable as
contemplated in this Agreement (subject to the Escrow Share and SR Expense
Fund Share, as applicable), the Option Consideration upon delivery by such
holder to the Payments Administrator of a duly executed and completed Option
Consent Letter, in accordance with the instructions thereto and all other
documents, instruments or certificates required by Parent and the Company to
be delivered by such holder of Company Options to give effect to the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement.

 



15\. (d) Other Actions. The Company shall take all actions that may be necessary or
that Parent reasonably and in good faith requests the Company to take in
order (under the Company Option Plan or otherwise) to effectuate the
provisions of this Section 1.11 and to ensure that, from and after the
Effective Time, holders of Company Options have no rights with respect to
such Company Options.

(e) Payment of Option Consideration. Any payment of Option Consideration
required to be made to a holder of Company Options pursuant to this Agreement
shall be paid by Parent first to the Surviving Corporation for payment to such
holder, subject to Section 1.18, as follows: (x) that portion of the Option
Consideration payable in respect of Employee Options to the holders of such
Employee Options through the Surviving Corporations payroll system, and (y)
that portion of the Option Consideration then payable in respect of Non-
Employee Options to the holders of such Non-Employee Options to the Surviving
Corporation through its accounts payable.

 

1.12 Company Warrants. The Company shall cause all Company Warrants that are
outstanding and unexercised as of immediately prior to the Effective Time to
be cancelled at the Effective Time. In exchange and settlement for the
cancellation of any Company Warrant and the delivery of a completed warrant
cancellation agreement, in a form mutually agreed upon by Parent and
the Company, the Company Warrantholder thereof shall have the right to
receive, in respect of each share of Company Common Stock underlying the
Company Warrant, the (A) Per Warrant Share Closing Merger Consideration,
payable in the form of (i) a pro rata number of shares of Parent Preferred
Stock (determined based on the quotient of 650,000 shares of Parent Preferred
Stock and the total number of shares of Company Common Stock underlying the
Company Warrant), (ii) a pro rata number of shares of Parent Common Stock
(determined based on the quotient of 11,500,000 shares of Parent Common Stock
(reduced by the number of shares of Parent Common Stock issuable in respect of
the shares of Company Common Stock pursuant to Section 1.10(a(iii)(2)) and
the total number of shares of Company Common Stock underlying the Company
Warrants), and (iii) a pro rata share (based on the total number of shares of
Company Common Stock underlying the Company Warrants) of the amount of Cash
Merger Consideration remaining after making the aggregate payments of the Per
Common Share Closing Merger Consideration pursuant to Section 1.10 and the
aggregate Option Consideration pursuant to Section 1.11, each in accordance
with the Payout Spreadsheet, plus (B) an allocable portion of any Post-Closing
Merger Consideration. For the avoidance of doubt, after the Effective Time, no
Company Warrant shall be exercisable by any Company Warrantholder
for, otherwise entitle such Company Warrantholder to receive, shares of
Company Stock (or any other equity security or other consideration), but shall
only entitle such Company Warrantholder to the consideration (if any)
described in this Section 1.12. The aggregate amount paid or payable in
respect of the cancellation of the Company Warrants as set forth in this
Section 1.12 is referred to herein as the " _Warrant Consideration_." Parent
will deliver to each Company Warrantholder a stock certificate representing
the shares of Parent Preferred Stock issuable to such Company Warrantholder.
The shares of Parent Common Stock issuable to each Company Warrantholder will
be in uncertificated book-entry form.

1.13 Closing of the Companys Transfer Books. At the Effective Time, holders
of certificates representing shares of Company Stock (the " _Company Stock
Certificates_ ") or uncertificated book-entry shares representing shares of
the Company Stock (a " _Book-Entry Share_ ") that were outstanding immediately
prior to the Effective Time shall cease to have any rights as stockholders of
the Company, and the stock transfer books of the Company shall be closed with
respect to all shares of such capital stock outstanding immediately prior to
the Effective Time. No further transfer of any such shares of the Company
Stock shall be made on such stock transfer books after the Effective Time. If,
after the Effective Time, a valid Company Stock Certificate or Book-Entry
Share is presented to the Payments Administrator, Surviving Corporation or
Parent, such Company Stock Certificate or Book-Entry Share shall be cancelled
and shall be exchanged as provided in Section 1.14.

 



16\. 1.14 Payment of Consideration; Surrender of Certificates.

 

(a) Payments Administrator. As soon as reasonably practicable following the
date hereof, Parent and the Company acting in good faith shall mutually agree
on the payments administrator (the " _Payments Administrator_ ") for the
Merger, other than with respect to the Option Consideration. The Surviving
Corporation shall serve as the paying agent for the Option Consideration,
which shall be paid as provided in Section 1.11(e).

(b) Parent to Provide Consideration. At or prior to the Effective Time,
Parent shall make available in the form of immediately available funds to (i)
the Payments Administrator for exchange in accordance with this Section 1.14,
the cash payable at the Effective Time to the stockholders pursuant to
Section 1.10 hereof in exchange for outstanding shares of Company Stock (other
than Restricted Stock), (ii) the Surviving Corporation, the Option
Consideration payable at the Effective Time to the holder of any
Company Option pursuant to Section 1.11(a) hereof and the cash payable at the
effective time with respect to Restricted Stock (to pay each holder of
Restricted Stock such payment on or before the first administratively
practicable payroll date of the Surviving Corporation after the Effective
Time, subject to the provisions in this Section 1.14), and (iii) the Company
Warrantholders, the cash payable to them and the Parent Preferred Stock and
the Parent Common Stock issuable to them at the Effective Time pursuant to
Section 1.12.

(c) Exchange Procedures. As soon as reasonably practicable following the date
hereof and the execution of the agreement with the Payments Administrator,
Parent shall (or shall cause the Payments Administrator to) mail a letter of
transmittal substantially in the form of _Exhibit D_ (the " _Letter
of Transmittal_ ") to each Effective Time Common Holder and Effective Time
Preferred Holder at the address of record set forth opposite each such
Effective Time Common Holders and Effective Time Preferred Holders name on
the Payout Spreadsheet. After receipt of such Letter of Transmittal, the
Effective Time Preferred Holders will surrender the Company Stock Certificates
and the Effective Time Common Holders will surrender Book-Entry Shares to the
Payments Administrator for cancellation, and each Effective Time Common
Holder and Effective Time Preferred Holder shall deliver a duly completed and
validly executed Letter of Transmittal. Upon surrender of a Company Stock
Certificate (with respect to Effective Time Preferred Holders) or Book-Entry
Shares (with respect to Effective Time Common Holders) for cancellation to the
Payments Administrator, together with a Letter of Transmittal, duly and
properly completed and validly executed in accordance with the instructions
thereto, subject to the terms of Section 1.14(e) hereof, the holder of such
Company Stock Certificate and the holders of such Book-Entry Shares shall be
entitled to receive from the Payments Administrator in exchange therefor,
the Closing Merger Consideration to which such holder is entitled pursuant to
Section 1.10(a) hereof (less the amount to be deposited into the Escrow Fund
and the SR Expense Fund, if applicable), and the Company Stock Certificates
and Book-Entry Shares so surrendered shall be cancelled. Until so
surrendered, each Company Stock Certificate and Book-Entry Share outstanding
after the Effective Time will be deemed, for all corporate purposes
thereafter, to evidence only the right to receive the applicable portion of
the Closing Merger Consideration pursuant to Section 1.10 hereof in exchange
for shares of Company Stock (without interest) into which such shares of
Company Stock shall have been so converted. No portion of the Closing Merger
Consideration will be paid to the holder of any

 



17\.  unsurrendered Company Stock Certificate or Book-Entry Share with respect to
shares of Company Stock formerly represented thereby until the holder of
record of such Company Stock Certificate or Book-Entry Share shall surrender
such Company Stock Certificate or Book-Entry Share pursuant hereto. In
connection with the mailing of the Letter of Transmittal, the Parent shall (or
shall cause the Payments Administrator to) mail a registration rights
agreement, in substantially the form attached hereto as _Exhibit G_ (the "
_Registration Rights Agreement_ "), to each Effective Time Common Holder and
each Company Warrantholder as of the Effective Time who has not previously
executed the Registration Rights Agreement. Each Effective Time Common Holder
and Company Warrantholder who has delivered to Parent a completed Investor
Questionnaire in respect of such Effective Time Common Holder confirming
that such Effective Time Common Holder is an "accredited investor" for the
purposes of, and within the meaning of Rule 501(a) of, Regulation D under the
Securities Act in accordance with Section 1.20 shall have the opportunity to
become a party to the Registration Rights Agreement with respect to the
shares of Parent Common Stock issued to such Effective Time Common Holder or
Company Warrantholder by delivering a duly executed counterpart signature page
to the Registration Rights Agreement to Parent.

(d) Transfers of Ownership. If any cash amounts are to be disbursed pursuant
to Section 1.10 hereof to a Person other than the Person whose name is
reflected on the Company Stock Certificate or Book-Entry Share surrendered in
exchange therefor, it will be a condition of the delivery thereof that the
Company Stock Certificate so surrendered will be properly endorsed and
otherwise in proper form for transfer and that the Person requesting such
exchange will have paid to Parent or any agent designated by it any transfer
or other Taxes required by reason of the disbursement of such cash amounts to
a Person other than the registered holder of the certificate surrendered, or
established to the satisfaction of Parent or any agent designated by it that
such Tax has been paid or is not payable.

 

(e) Lost, Stolen or Destroyed Certificates. Notwithstanding Section 1.14(c),
if any certificate representing shares of Company Stock shall have been lost,
stolen or destroyed, upon the making of an affidavit of that fact by the
Person claiming such certificate to be lost, stolen or destroyed, such
affidavit to be in such form reasonably agreed to in writing by Parent,
delivered to the Payments Administrator together with the Letter of
Transmittal, such Person shall be entitled to receive, in each case, when and
if payable as contemplated in this Agreement, the amounts set forth in Section
1.10(a) for each share of Company Stock owned by such Person immediately
prior to the Effective Time and represented by such lost, stolen or destroyed
certificate.

 

(f) Payments Administrator to Return Merger Consideration. At any time
following the last day of the nine (9) month period following the Effective
Time, Parent shall be entitled to require the Payments Administrator to
deliver to Parent or its designated successor or assign all cash amounts that
have been deposited with the Payments Administrator pursuant to this Section
1.14, and any income or proceeds thereof, not disbursed to the holders of
Company Stock Certificates or Book-Entry Shares pursuant to Section 1.14(c)
hereof, and thereafter the holders of Company Stock Certificates or Book-
Entry Shares shall be entitled to look only to Parent (subject to the terms
of Section 1.14(g) hereof) only as general creditors thereof with respect to
any and all amounts that may be payable to such holders of Company Stock
Certificates or Book-Entry Shares pursuant to Section 1.10 hereof upon the
due surrender of such Company Stock Certificates or Book-Entry Shares in the
manner set forth in Section 1.14(c) hereof.

 

(g) No Liability. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Section
1.14, neither the Payments Administrator, the Surviving Corporation, nor any
party hereto shall be liable to a holder of shares of Company Stock for any
amount properly paid to a public official pursuant to any applicable abandoned
property, escheat or similar Legal Requirement.

 



18\. 1.15 No Further Ownership Rights in Company Stock. The Closing Merger
Consideration paid in respect of the surrender for exchange of shares of
Company Stock in accordance with the terms hereof shall be deemed to be full
satisfaction of all rights pertaining to such shares of Company Stock, and
there shall be no further registration of transfers on the records of the
Surviving Corporation of shares of Company Stock which were outstanding
immediately prior to the Effective Time. If, after the Effective Time, Company
Stock Certificates or Book-Entry Shares are presented to the Surviving
Corporation for any reason, they shall be cancelled and exchanged as provided
in Section 1.14 hereof.

1.16 Dissenting Shares.

(a) Notwithstanding any other provision of this Agreement to the contrary,
shares of Company Stock that are outstanding immediately prior to the
Effective Time and that are held by stockholders of the Company who shall have
not voted in favor of the Merger or consented thereto in writing (or who shall
have not otherwise contractually waived their rights to appraisal) and who
shall have properly demanded appraisal for such shares in accordance with
Section 262 of the DGCL (collectively, the " _Dissenting Shares_ ") shall not
be converted into or represent the right to receive a portion of the
Estimated Cash Merger Consideration or Post-Closing Merger Consideration. Such
stockholders instead shall be entitled to receive payment from the Company of
the appraised value of such shares of Company Stock held by them in accordance
with the provisions of Section 262 of the DGCL.

(b) Notwithstanding the provisions of Section 1.16(a), if any holder of
Dissenting Shares shall effectively withdraw or lose (through failure to
perfect or otherwise) his or her appraisal rights, then, as of the later of
the Effective Time and the occurrence of such event, such holders shares of
Company Stock shall automatically be converted into and represent only the
right to receive the consideration for Company Stock to which such stockholder
would otherwise be entitled under Section 1.10, without interest thereon, upon
surrender of the certificate representing such shares.

(c) The Surviving Corporation shall give the Stockholders Representative and
Parent prompt written notice of any demand for appraisal received by the
Surviving Corporation pursuant to the DGCL. After the Closing Date, the
Surviving Corporation shall have the exclusive authority to assume the control
of the defense of any proceeding with respect thereto, including the
employment of counsel reasonably satisfactory to the Stockholders
Representative, and the Stockholders Representative shall cooperate fully
with the Surviving Corporation and make available all pertinent information
under its control in connection therewith.

1.17 Further Action. If, at any time after the Effective Time, any
further action is determined by Parent to be necessary or desirable to carry
out the purposes of this Agreement or to vest the Surviving Corporation or
Parent with full right, title and possession of and to all rights and property
of Merger Sub and the Company, the officers and directors of the Surviving
Corporation and Parent shall be fully authorized (in the name of Merger Sub,
in the name of the Company and otherwise) to take such action.

 



19\. 1.18 Withholding. Each of Parent, the Company, the Surviving Corporation, the
Payments Administrator and the Escrow Agent will be entitled to deduct and
withhold from any consideration payable or otherwise deliverable to any Person
pursuant to this Agreement such amounts as Parent, the Company, the Surviving
Corporation, the Payments Administrator and the Escrow Agent may be required
to deduct or withhold therefrom under applicable Legal Requirements. All such
amounts deducted and withheld will be treated for all purposes under this
Agreement as having been paid to the Person to whom such amounts would
otherwise have been paid. To the extent that Parent is required to deduct and
withhold any amounts in connection with any Parent Common Stock Merger
Consideration, Parent shall, at its discretion, (a) be entitled to retain a
portion of the Parent Common Stock equal in value to such required deduction,
(b) offset the amounts required to be deducted and withheld against cash
payments required to be made by Parent to the recipient of the Parent Common
Stock Merger Consideration, or (c) require the recipient of the Parent Common
Stock Merger Consideration to pay an amount equal to the amount required to be
deducted and withheld from the Parent Common Stock Merger Consideration to
Parent.

of such Parent Common Stock (which shall have the effect of reducing the
amount of cash payable to the Common Holders and Company Warrantholders who
will receive a portion of the consideration in Parent Common Stock
Merger Consideration).

 



21\. SECTION 2. REPRESENTATIONS AND WARRANTIES OF THE COMPANY

their respective Subsidiaries had been distributed out of the Company in their
entirety immediately prior to the date hereof. The Disclosure Schedule shall
be arranged in numbered sections corresponding to the sections contained in
this Section 2 and any information disclosed therein under any section of the
Disclosure Schedule shall be deemed disclosed and incorporated into any other
section of the Disclosure Schedule to the extent that it is reasonably
apparent from its face to be applicable to such other representations and
warranties.

 

2.1 Existence and Power. The Company is a corporation duly organized, validly
existing and in good standing under the Legal Requirements of its
jurisdiction of incorporation. The Company is duly qualified to do business as
a foreign corporation and is in good standing in each jurisdiction where the
character of the property owned or leased by it or the nature of its
activities makes such qualification necessary, except such jurisdictions
where the failure to be so qualified or licensed or in good standing would not
reasonably be expected to have a material and adverse effect on the Company.
The Company has heretofore delivered to Parent true and complete copies of
the Company Charter, its bylaws and its other organizational documents as
currently in effect, and no amendments thereto are pending. The Company has
the corporate power and authority to own and operate its assets and
properties and to conduct its business as it is now being conducted.

2.2 Corporate Authorization.

 

(a) The execution, delivery and performance by the Company of this Agreement
and the consummation by the Company of the Transactions are within the
Companys corporate powers and, except for the required approval of the
Company Stockholders in connection with the consummation of the Merger, have
been duly authorized by all necessary corporate action on the part of the
Company. This Agreement constitutes a valid and binding obligation of the
Company, enforceable against the Company in accordance with its terms, subject
to bankruptcy, reorganization, insolvency and other similar laws affecting the

standing under the Legal Requirements of its jurisdiction of formation. Each
Subsidiary of the Company is duly qualified or licensed to do business and is
in good standing as a foreign corporation in each jurisdiction in which
the conduct of its business or the ownership, leasing, holding or use of its
properties makes such qualification necessary, except such jurisdictions where
the failure to be so qualified or licensed or in good standing would not
reasonably be expected to have a Material Adverse Effect. Each Subsidiary of
the Company has the corporate (or equivalent) power and authority to own and
operate its assets and properties and to conduct its business as it is now
being conducted. The Company has made available a true and correct copy of
each such Subsidiarys certificate of incorporation and bylaws (or other
comparable organizational documents), each as amended to date and in full
force and effect on the date hereof, to Parent and no amendments thereto are
pending. Each such Subsidiary is solvent and is not the subject of any
supervision, conservation, rehabilitation, liquidation, receivership,
insolvency or other similar action or proceeding, nor has any such action
or proceeding been threatened in writing.

(b) Except as set forth in Section 2.3 of the Disclosure Schedule, all of the
outstanding capital stock of, or other ownership interests in, each Subsidiary
of the Company is owned by the Company, directly or indirectly, free and clear
of any Lien other than Permitted Liens. Except as set forth in Section 2.3 of

Companys Subsidiaries (the items in clauses (i) and (ii) being referred to
collectively as the " _Subsidiary Securities_ "). There are no outstanding
obligations of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries to repurchase, redeem or
otherwise acquire any outstanding Subsidiary Securities.

 

(c) Except as set forth in Section 2.3(c) of the Disclosure Schedule, the

or federal securities laws; and (e) any actions or filings the absence of

Parent to perform its obligations under this Agreement or to timely consummate
the Transactions.

 

3.4 Non-Contravention. Subject to filing the Parent Charter Amendment prior to
Closing, the execution, delivery and performance by Parent and Merger Sub of
this Agreement and the consummation of the Transactions do not and will not
(a) contravene, conflict with, or result in any violation or breach of any
provision of the respective organizational documents of Parent and Merger
Sub, (b) contravene, conflict with or result in a violation or breach of any
provision of any Legal Requirement, or (c) require any consent or other action
by any Person under, constitute a default, or an event that, with or without
notice or lapse of time or both, would constitute a default, under, any
provision of any Contract or other instrument binding upon Parent or Merger
Sub or any license, franchise, permit, certificate, approval or other similar
authorization affecting, or relating in any way to, the assets or business of
Parent or Merger Sub; except, in each case as set forth in clauses (b) through
(c), where the violation, conflict, or default, or failure to obtain a
consent would not, in each such case, reasonably be expected to have a
material adverse effect on the ability of Parent and Merger Sub to consummate
the transactions contemplated by this Agreement.

 



42\. 3.5 Banker Fees. Other than Wells Fargo, there is no investment banker,
broker, finder or other intermediary that has been retained by or is
authorized to act on behalf of Parent or Merger Sub who might be entitled to
any fee or commission from any Effective Time Holder (or, if the Closing does
not occur, the Company) upon consummation of the Transactions.

3.6 Financing.

 

(a) Parent has delivered to the Company complete and correct copies of a fully
executed commitment letter from Wells Fargo Bank, National Association and
Wells Fargo Securities, LLC (the " _Commitment Letter_ ") and one or more
fully executed fee letters among Parent and Wells Fargo Bank, National
Association and Wells Fargo Securities, LLC (with only fee amounts, economic
terms (including pricing flex), other sensitive numbers and syndication levels
redacted) (collectively, the " _Fee Letter_ "), pursuant to which Wells Fargo
Bank, National Association has committed, upon the terms and subject only to
the conditions set forth therein, to provide the debt financing in the amounts
described therein in connection with the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement. The financing contemplated pursuant to the Commitment Letter
collectively is hereinafter referred to as the " _Financing_."

(b) As of the date hereof, the Commitment Letter is in full force and effect
and is the valid (assuming due authorization, execution and delivery by the
other parties thereto) and binding obligation of Parent and, to the Knowledge
of Parent, the other parties thereto, except as enforceability may be limited
by bankruptcy, insolvency, fraudulent transfer, reorganization, moratorium or
other similar Legal Requirements relating to or affecting the rights of
creditors generally and by equitable principles, including those limiting the
availability of specific performance, injunctive relief and other equitable
remedies and those providing for equitable defenses; and no event has occurred
which, with or without notice, lapse of time or both, would constitute a
material breach or default by Parent thereunder. As of the date hereof, to
the Knowledge of Parent, the commitment contained in the Commitment Letter has
not been withdrawn or rescinded in any respect (and no party thereto has
indicated an intent to so withdraw or rescind) or otherwise amended or
modified in any respect. All commitment fees required to be paid under the
Commitment Letter have been paid in full or, if not yet due, will be duly paid
in full when due. The consummation of the Financing is subject to no
conditions precedent other than those set forth in the Commitment Letter and
the unredacted portions of the Fee Letter delivered to the Company (or as set
forth in any such documents as amended, or in documents replacing such
documents, in each case after the date hereof and not in violation of the
provisions hereof). Assuming the accuracy of the Companys representations and
warranties in this Agreement and the performance by the Company of its
obligations hereunder, the satisfaction of the conditions set forth in
Sections 6.1 and 6.2 and the completion of the Marketing Period, (i) as of the
date of this Agreement, Parent does not have reason to believe that any of the
conditions to the Financing that are in the Parents control will not be
satisfied or the Financing will not be consummated as contemplated by the
Commitment Letter and (ii) the aggregate proceeds of the Financing available
on the Closing Date, together with cash on hand, will be sufficient if funded
in accordance with the Commitment Letter to enable Parent to pay or cause to
be paid in cash all amounts required to be paid by it in cash at Closing in
connection with the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, including
the Cash Merger Consideration and all payments, fees and expenses (each due
and payable on the Closing Date) of Parent related to or arising out of the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement (assuming that all rights to flex
the terms of the Financing are exercised to their maximum extent).

 



43\. 3.7 FCC Qualifications. Subject to the Regulatory Divestitures, (i) Parent
is legally, technically, financially and otherwise qualified under the
Communications Laws as in effect on the date hereof to acquire control of, and
to own and operate, the Stations and (ii) to Parents knowledge, there are no
facts or circumstances pertaining to Parent or any Affiliate of Parent which,
under the Communications Laws, would (x) reasonably be expected to result in
the FCCs refusal to grant the FCC Consent or (y) materially delay obtaining
the FCC Consent. Other than as contemplated by the FCC Consent and subject to
the Regulatory Divestitures, no waiver of, or exemption from, any provision of
the Communications Laws is necessary to obtain the FCC Consent. To the
Knowledge of Parent, there is no fact or circumstance relating to the Parent
or any Affiliate of the Parent that could reasonably be expected to prevent
the FCC from granting the FCC Applications.

 

3.8 No Parent Vote Required. No vote or other action of the stockholders of
Parent is required by applicable Legal Requirements, the NYSE rules or
requirements, the restated articles of incorporation, as amended, or bylaws of
Parent or otherwise in order for Parent and Merger Sub to consummate the
Merger and the transactions contemplated hereby.

 

3.9 SEC Reports and Financial Statements.

 

From December 31, 2016, Parent has timely (including following any extensions
of time for filing provided by Rule 12b-25 promulgated under the Exchange Act)
filed or furnished all forms, documents and reports required to be filed or
furnished by it with the SEC under the Securities Act or the Exchange Act
prior to the date hereof (such forms, documents and reports the " _Parent SEC
Documents_ "). As of their respective filing dates, or, if amended prior to
the date hereof, as of the date of (and giving effect to) the last such
amendment made prior to the date hereof, the Parent SEC Documents complied as
to form in all material respects with the requirements of the Securities Act
and the Exchange Act, as the case may be, and the applicable rules and
regulations promulgated thereunder and the listing and corporate governance
rules and regulations of the NYSE, and none of the Parent SEC Documents
contained (or, with respect to Parent SEC Documents filed after the date
hereof, will contain) any untrue statement of a material fact or omitted to
state any material fact required to be stated therein or necessary to make the
statements therein, in light of the circumstances under which they were made,
not misleading.

 

Each of the consolidated financial statements contained or incorporated by
reference in the Parent SEC Documents (as amended, supplemented or restated,
if applicable), including the related notes and schedules, was prepared
(except as indicated in the notes thereto including, in the case of interim
financial statements, for normal and recurring year-end adjustments and as
may be permitted by the SEC on Form 10-Q or Form 8-K under the Exchange Act
and absence of all notes thereto) in accordance with GAAP applied on a
consistent basis throughout the periods indicated, and each such consolidated
financial statement presented fairly, in all material respects, the
consolidated financial position, results of operations, stockholders equity
and cash flows of Parent and its consolidated Subsidiaries as of the
respective dates thereof and for the respective periods indicated therein
(subject, in the case of unaudited quarterly financial statements, to
the absence of footnotes and year-end adjustments).

3.10 Parent Stock. The issuance, sale and delivery of the shares of Parent
Stock issuable pursuant to Section 1.10 have been duly authorized by all

accordance with the provisions of this Agreement, will be duly authorized,
validly issued, fully paid and non-assessable and not subject to or issued in
violation of any purchase option, call 

 



44\.  option, right of first refusal, preemptive right, subscription right or any
similar right. Assuming the accuracy and completeness of representations made
by all of the Common Holders and Company Warrantholders in their Investor
Questionnaires, the offer, issuance, sale and delivery of the shares of Parent
Stock pursuant to the terms of this Agreement are and will be in compliance
with all applicable state and federal securities Legal Requirements, exempt
from the registration requirements of the Securities Act and exempt from all
applicable state securities law registration and qualification requirements.

 

3.11 Solvency. Assuming (a) the conditions to the obligations of Parent and
Merger Sub to consummate the Transactions have been satisfied or waived, (b)
the representations and warranties set forth in Article 2 are true and correct
in all material respects, and (c) the financial projections or forecasts
provided by the Company to Parent prior to the date hereof have been prepared
in good faith on assumptions that were and continue to be reasonable, then at
and immediately following the Effective Time and after giving effect to the
Transactions, including the Financing, immediately after giving effect to the
Transactions, each of Parent and its Subsidiaries, including the Surviving
Corporation, shall be solvent and shall: (a) be able to pay its debts as they
become due; (b) own property that has a fair saleable value greater than the
amounts required to pay its debts (including a reasonable estimate of the
amount of all contingent liabilities); and (c) have adequate capital to carry
on its business. No transfer of property is being made and no obligation is
being incurred in connection with the Transactions with the intent to hinder,
delay or defraud either present or future creditors of any of Parent and its
Subsidiaries, including the Surviving Corporation. In connection with the
Transactions, neither Parent nor any of its Subsidiaries has incurred, nor
plans to incur, debts beyond its ability to pay as they become absolute and
matured.

 

3.12 Litigation. Except as disclosed in the Parent SEC Documents, there is no
Legal Proceeding pending (or to Parents Knowledge, threatened) against or
affecting Parent or any of its Subsidiaries that would be reasonably expected
to have a Parent Material Adverse Effect. There is no Governmental Order of
any kind outstanding against Parent or any of its Subsidiaries that would
materially impair the ability of Parent to timely consummate the Transactions.

3.13 Independent Investigation. Parent has conducted its own independent
investigation, review and analysis of the business, results of operations,
prospects, condition (financial or otherwise) or assets of the Company and its
Subsidiaries, and acknowledges that it has been provided adequate access to
the personnel, properties, assets, premises, books and records, and other
documents and data of the Company and its Subsidiaries for such purpose.
Parent acknowledges and agrees that: (a) in making its decision to enter into
this Agreement and to consummate the Transactions, Parent has relied solely
upon its own investigation and the express representations and warranties of
the Company set forth in Section 2 of this Agreement (including the related
portions of the Disclosure Schedules); and (b) none of the Company, any of the
Companys Subsidiaries or any other Person has made any representation or
warranty as to the Company, any Companys Subsidiary or this Agreement,
except as expressly set forth in Section 2 of this Agreement (including the
related portions of the Disclosure Schedules).

of the other Transactions. In addition, each of the Company, Parent and Merger
Sub shall use their reasonable best efforts to lift any injunction
prohibiting, or any other legal bar to, the Merger or any of the other
Transactions. Nothing in this Agreement shall be construed as an attempt or an
agreement by the Company or any of its Subsidiaries to assign or cause the
assignment of any Contract or Permit which is by Legal Requirement non-
assignable without the consent of the other party or parties thereto, unless
such consent shall have been given.

 

(b) Prior to the Closing Date, the Company shall use commercially reasonable
efforts to obtain written consents to the change of control provisions in
and/or the assignment of, and to provide the notices required under the change
of control provisions in (or obtain written waivers thereto), the Contracts in
Section 4.4 of the Disclosure Schedule, and in each case shall provide
evidence of the same to Parent.

(c) Notwithstanding any other provision hereof, no party to this
Agreement (other than the Stockholders Representative) will knowingly take,
or knowingly omit to take, any action that is reasonably likely to result in
any of the conditions to the Merger set forth in Section 6 not being satisfied
in a timely manner, or any action that is reasonably likely to materially
impair its ability to perform its obligations under this Agreement or to
consummate the transactions contemplated hereby, except as required by
applicable Legal Requirements.

 

4.5 Company Stockholder Approval.

 

(a) Stockholder Written Consent. Immediately following the execution of this
Agreement (and in any event within one (1) day), the Company shall deliver to

following the execution of this Agreement the Company shall use commercially
reasonable efforts to obtain the approval of any Company Stockholder who has
not approved this Agreement.

(b) Notice to Stockholders and Dissenters Rights. To the extent required by
the DGCL, the Company shall promptly deliver to any stockholder of the Company

written consent in accordance with the DGCL and advising them that they may be
entitled to assert appraisal rights under Delaware law (the " _Stockholder
Dissent Notice_ "), and include in such Stockholder Dissent Notice
all disclosure information reasonably required by applicable Legal
Requirements, including a disclosure and information statement (the "
_Disclosure and Information Statement_ "). The Company shall have taken all
action reasonably necessary prior to Closing to prepare the Stockholder
Dissent Notice, which shall comply with the requirements of Section 262 of the
DGCL. A Company Stockholder shall be permitted to distribute the Disclosure

Information Statement transmitted to the Company Stockholders in connection

substance reasonably satisfactory to Parent and Merger Sub and their counsel
and will not contain any untrue statement of a material fact or omit to state
a material fact required to be stated therein.

4.6 Execution of Additional Documents. Prior to Closing, from time to time,
as and when requested by a party hereto, each party hereto shall execute and
deliver, or cause to be executed and delivered, all such documents and
instruments and shall take, or cause to be taken, all such further or other
actions as such other party may reasonably deem necessary to consummate the
Transactions.

4.7 Publicity. No public release or announcement concerning the Transactions
shall be issued by any party hereto or such partys Affiliates or
Representatives without the prior consent of the other parties hereto, except
as follows: (a) the Company may make such disclosure to its owners and
employees as it deems necessary or desirable; and (b) any release or
announcement required by applicable Legal Requirements, provided the party
required to make the release or announcement allows the other
party reasonable time to comment on such release or announcement in advance
of such issuance. The foregoing restrictions in the Section 4.7 shall not
apply to: (x) any disclosure contained in Parents periodic or other reports
filed with the SEC; (y) any statements or disclosures by Parent on an
earnings call or in similar discussions with financial media, analysts,
stockholders or other members of the investment community; and (z) any public

limiting the foregoing, comply with their respective obligations under

(b) The Company and Parent shall jointly coordinate (i) the scheduling of, and
strategic planning for, any meeting with any Governmental Body in connection
with the HSR Act and Communications Laws, (ii) the making of any filings,
including the initial filings under the HSR Act and the FCC Applications,
(iii) the process for the receipt of any necessary approvals and (iv) the

 



53\.  resolution of any investigation or other inquiry of any such Governmental

Laws, and (C) to the extent reasonably practicable, coordinate with the other

(c) Unless prohibited by applicable Legal Requirement or by the applicable

prohibited by applicable Legal Requirement or by the applicable Governmental
Body from participating or attending any such meeting or engaging in any such

with respect thereto.

 

(d) Subject to the terms of Schedule 4.8, if any objections are raised or
asserted by a Governmental Body with respect to the Transactions under any
Legal Requirement, if any Legal Proceeding is instituted (or threatened to be
instituted) by a Governmental Body, or if Regulatory Action is taken or
imposed by the Federal Trade Commission, the Division or any other applicable
Governmental Body, that, in the case of each of the foregoing, challenge the
Transactions as being in violation of any applicable Legal Requirement or
would otherwise prevent or materially impede or delay the consummation of
the Transactions, Parent, Merger Sub and the Company will use their
reasonable best efforts to resolve any such objections or Legal Proceedings or
satisfy such Regulatory Action so as to permit consummation of the
Transactions as soon as reasonably practicable. Parent, Merger Sub and the
Company expressly agree that, if necessary to obtain approval of the
Transactions under the HSR Act, Parent, Merger Sub and the Company will
contest and resist any such Legal Proceeding or Regulatory Action and seek to
have vacated, lifted, reversed or overturned any Governmental Order or
Regulatory Action that is in effect that prohibits, prevents or restricts the
consummation of the Transactions. Notwithstanding anything herein to the
contrary, nothing set forth in this Section 4.8 or Schedule 4.8 shall (i)
require, or be construed to require, Merger Sub, the Company or Parent or any
of their respective Subsidiaries to take, or agree to take, any Regulatory
Action or make any Regulatory Divestiture unless the Regulatory Action or the
Regulatory Divestiture shall be conditioned upon the consummation of the
Merger and the transactions contemplated hereby or (ii) require, or be
construed to require, Merger Sub, the Company, Parent or any of their
respective Subsidiaries to take, or agree to take, any Regulatory Action other
than the Regulatory Divestitures set forth on Schedule 4.8 or as otherwise set
forth on Schedule 4.8.

 

(e) For purposes of Section 4.8(d), " _Regulatory Action_ " means any
obligation, condition or other requirement imposed by a Governmental Body in
connection with this Agreement or the transactions contemplated hereby.

 



54\. (f) Without limiting the generality of Section 4.8(a), but subject to Section
4.8(d):

(i) Within ten (10) Business Days of the date of this Agreement, Parent and
the Company shall jointly file an application or applications with the FCC
requesting the grant of its consent (the " _FCC Consent_ ") to the transfer of
control of the Company to Parent and the continuation of existing satellite
waivers of the Company (collectively, the " _FCC Application_ "). The Company
and Parent shall use reasonable best efforts to obtain the FCC Consent as
promptly as practicable. The Company and Parent shall each pay 50% of the FCC
filing fees relating to the transactions contemplated hereby required by the
Communications Laws to be paid by the Company, Parent or any of their
respective Subsidiaries, irrespective of whether the transactions contemplated
by this Agreement are consummated.

 

(ii) As promptly as practicable following the date of this Agreement, the
Company and Parent shall, and/or shall cause their respective ultimate parent
entities to file Notification and Report Forms with the Federal Trade
Commission and the United States Department of Justice pursuant to the HSR
Act, with respect to the transactions contemplated hereby, and shall
thereafter promptly respond to all requests received from such agencies for
additional information or documentation. The Company and Parent shall each pay
50% of the filing fees payable under the HSR Act by Merger Sub, the Company,
and Parent relating to the transactions contemplated hereby, irrespective of
whether the transactions contemplated by this Agreement are consummated.
Neither Company nor Parent shall agree to (i) extend any waiting period under
the HSR Act or (ii) enter into any agreement with the Federal Trade
Commission or United States Department of Justice to delay or not consummate
the Transactions, except, in each case, with the prior written consent of the
other party, not to be unreasonably withheld with respect to any extension or
agreement to delay.

(iii) The Company and Parent acknowledge that, to the extent reasonably
necessary to expedite the grant by the FCC of any application for renewal of
any FCC License with respect to any Station and thereby to facilitate the
grant of the FCC Consent with respect to such Station, each of the Company,
Parent and their applicable Subsidiaries shall be permitted to enter into
tolling agreements with the FCC to extend the statute of limitations for the
FCC to determine or impose a forfeiture penalty against such Station in
connection with (i) any pending complaints that such Station aired
programming that contained obscene, indecent or profane material or (ii) any
other enforcement matters against such Station with respect to which the FCC
may permit the Company or Parent (or any of their respective Subsidiaries) to
enter into a tolling agreement.

(iv) If the Closing shall not have occurred for any reason within the original
effective periods of the FCC Consent, and neither party shall have terminated
this Agreement pursuant to the terms hereof, the Company and Parent shall use
their reasonable best efforts to obtain one or more extensions of the
effective period of the FCC Consent to permit consummation of the
transactions hereunder. Upon receipt of the FCC Consent, Parent and the
Company shall use their respective reasonable best efforts to maintain in
effect the FCC Consent to permit consummation of the transactions hereunder.
No extension of the FCC Consent shall limit the right of the Company and
Parent to terminate this Agreement pursuant to the terms hereof.

 



55\. 4.9 Financing Commitment.

 

(a) Parent shall use its reasonable best efforts to obtain the Financing on
the terms and conditions set forth in the Commitment Letter (including, as
necessary, any "flex" provisions of the Fee Letter), including by using its
reasonable best efforts to (i) maintain in effect the Commitment Letter and
negotiate a definitive agreement (the " _Financing Agreement_ ") with respect
to the Commitment Letter on the terms and conditions set forth in the
Commitment Letter, (ii) subject to compliance by the Company with its
covenants and agreements hereunder, cause Merger Subs compliance with all
covenants and agreements of Merger Sub set forth in the Commitment Letter and
the Financing Agreement, (iii) satisfy, or cause to be satisfied, on a timely
basis all conditions applicable to Merger Sub set forth in the Commitment
Letter and the Financing Agreement that are within its control ( _provided_ ,
that Parents obligations to cause the satisfaction of the conditions set
forth herein shall be governed solely by the terms of this Agreement),
(iv) assuming the satisfaction of the conditions set forth in Sections 6.1
and 6.2, the completion of the Marketing Period and the satisfaction of the
other conditions set forth in the Commitment Letter, consummate the Financing
on the terms set forth in the Commitment Letter at the Closing and (v) upon
the satisfaction of the conditions set forth in Sections 6.1 and 6.2, the
completion of the Marketing Period and the satisfaction of the other
conditions set forth in the Commitment Letter, fully enforce its rights;
provided, that, Parent may amend or amend and restate the Commitment Letter
and/or Fee Letter or enter into additional commitment documents with the
Financing Sources under the Commitment Letter so long as such amendment
or amendment and restatement does not reduce the amount under the Commitment
Letter or add any conditionality to the terms and conditions of the Commitment
Letter.

 

(b) Parent shall keep the Company reasonably informed concerning material
developments relating to the Financing and shall give the Company prompt
notice of any material adverse change with respect to the Financing. Without
limiting the foregoing, Parent agrees to notify the Company promptly if at any
time prior to the Closing Date (i) the Commitment Letter expires or
is terminated for any reason, (ii) any Financing Source refuses in writing to
provide the portion of the Financing contemplated by the Commitment Letter on
the terms set forth therein or (iii) Parent no longer believes in good faith
that it will be able to obtain all or any portion of the Financing on or
prior to the Outside Date on the terms and conditions of the Commitment Letter
with respect to such Financing Source after giving effect to any applicable
"flex" provisions of the Fee Letter (other than as a result of the failure of
the conditions set forth in Sections 6.1 and 6.2 to be satisfied or the
Marketing Period to be completed); _provided_ that in no event shall Parent be
required to disclose any information the disclosure of which in the
reasonable good faith opinion of legal counsel to the Parent, is prohibited by
applicable law or court order or that is subject to attorney-client or similar
privilege if Parent shall have used its commercially reasonable efforts to
disclose such information in a way that would not waive such privilege.

(c) If all or any portion of the Financing becomes unavailable on the terms
(including any "market flex" terms) and conditions contemplated in the
Commitment Letter or the Financing Agreement (other than a breach by the
Company of this Agreement which prevents or renders impracticable the
consummation of the Financing), Parent shall use its reasonable best efforts
to arrange to promptly obtain such Financing from alternative sources on terms
and conditions no less favorable in the aggregate to Merger Sub than the
terms and conditions in the Commitment Letter (including any "market flex"
provisions in the Fee Letter) and in an amount sufficient, when added to the
portion of the Financing that is otherwise available, to pay in cash all
amounts required to be paid by it in cash in connection with the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement, including the amounts to be paid pursuant to
Section 1.8(c) and all payments, fees and expenses of Parent related to
or arising out of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement (an "
_Alternative Financing_ ") and to obtain one or more new financing commitment
letters (each, an " _Alternative Commitment Letter_ ") and one or more new
definitive agreements (each, an " _Alternative Financing_

 



56\.   _Agreement_ ") providing therefor. In such event, the term " _Financing_ "
as used in this Agreement shall be deemed to include any Alternative
Financing, the term " _Commitment Letter_ " as used in this Agreement shall
be deemed to include any Alternative Commitment Letter, the term " _Financing
Agreement_ " as used in this Agreement shall be deemed to include
any Alternative Financing Agreement, and the term " _Financing Sources_ " as
used in this Agreement shall be deemed to include the lending institution(s)
under any Alternative Commitment Letter or Alternative Financing
Agreement. Parent will furnish correct and complete copies of any Alternative
Commitment Letter or Alternative Financing Agreement to the Company promptly
upon its execution.

 

(d) Prior to the Closing, the Company shall, and shall cause its Subsidiaries
to, and shall use its reasonable best efforts to cause its and their
respective Representatives to, provide to Parent all timely cooperation
reasonably requested by Parent in causing the conditions and covenants related
to any Financing to be satisfied and such cooperation as is otherwise

at or before the Closing (including consummation of the Transactions) or (b) a
run off (i.e., " _tail_ ") policy or endorsement with respect to the current
policy of directors and officers liability insurance covering claims
asserted within six (6) years after the Closing arising from facts or events
that occurred at or before the Closing (including consummation of the
Transactions); provided that in no event shall Parent or the Surviving
Corporation expend or be required to expend, on an annual basis, an amount in
excess of 300% of the last annual premium paid as of the date hereof by the
Company for any such insurance (the " _Premium Cap_ "); provided, further,
that if any such annual expense at any time would exceed the Premium Cap, then
the Surviving Corporation will cause to be maintained policies of insurance
which provide the maximum coverage available at an annual premium equal to
the Premium Cap. Parent and the Surviving Corporation shall be responsible for
all costs associated with such policies or endorsements. Such policies or
endorsements shall name as insureds thereunder all present and
former directors and officers of the Company, the Surviving Corporation and
the Companys Subsidiaries. The Company shall purchase a tail policy for
directors and officers liability insurance on the terms described in this
Section 5.4 (including subject to the Premium Cap) and Parent shall either
fully pay or reimburse the Company for such policy prior to the Effective
Time. From and following the Closing Date, Parent shall cause the Surviving
Corporation to abide by and honor each of the Surviving Corporations and its
Subsidiaries contractual obligations, if any, to provide directors and
officers liability insurance to any other Person, to the extent of such
contractual obligation.

Person has any nondisclosure obligation with respect to such information; or
(3) is independently developed by Parent or Merger Sub without the use of the
Stockholder Confidential Information, or (4) is disclosed with the prior
written approval of the Stockholders Representative; provided that to the
extent that Parent or its Affiliates or Representatives may become legally

Parent or its Affiliates or Representatives may disclose such
information (after consulting with the Stockholders Representative prior to
making such disclosure); and provided, further, that this Section 5.5(a) shall
not prohibit or restrict or otherwise limit the use or disclosure by Parent
and its Affiliates and Representatives of any Company Confidential
Information.

(b) From and after the Closing Date, the Stockholders Representative shall

that (1) is in or enters the public domain without breach of this Agreement,
including in accordance with Section 4.7; (2) the Stockholders
Representative lawfully receives from any other Person without restriction on

by the Stockholders Representative without the use of Company Confidential
Information. Notwithstanding the foregoing or anything in this Agreement to
the contrary, following Closing, the Stockholders Representative shall be
permitted to disclose information as required by law or to employees, advisors
or consultants of the Stockholders Representative and to the Effective Time
Holders, in each case who have a need to know such information, provided that
such persons are themselves obligated to keep such information confidential.

 

(c) From and after the date hereof, the Company shall (and shall use their
commercially reasonable efforts to cause their Representatives to) keep
confidential the terms of this Agreement and any and all information
concerning the Transactions or Parent and Merger Sub (collectively, " _Parent
Confidential Information_ "); provided that, for the purposes of this Section
5.5, Parent Confidential Information shall not include information that (1) is
in or enters the public domain without breach of this Agreement, including in
accordance with Section 4.7; (2) Company lawfully receives from any other
Person without restriction on disclosure, provided that the Company knows and

Representatives may disclose such information.

 



62\. (d) From the date hereof until the Closing, the Existing NDA shall remain in
full force and effect, but it shall expire and be of no further force or
effect at Closing (and the Existing NDA is hereby deemed amended accordingly).

 

5.6 Tax Matters.

 

(a) Parent will prepare and file, or cause to be prepared and filed, all Tax
Returns of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries to be filed for any Pre-
Closing Tax Period that are required to be filed after the Closing Date (such
Tax Returns, " _Parent Prepared Returns_ "). Parent shall prepare, or cause to
be prepared, any such Parent Prepared Returns consistent with the past
practices of the Company unless otherwise required by applicable Legal
Requirements. Parent will provide or make available to the Stockholders
Representative copies of all Parent Prepared Returns at least thirty 30 days
prior to the due date for filing such Parent Prepared Return (or, if such due
date is within 60 days following the Closing Date, as promptly as practicable
following the Closing Date). Parent shall consider in good faith any timely-
received, reasonable comments made by the Stockholders Representative to
Parent Prepared Returns.

 

(b) Parent, the Surviving Corporation and the Stockholders Representative
will cooperate fully, as and to the extent reasonably requested by another
party, in connection with the filing of Tax Returns pursuant to this Agreement
and any audit, examination or other proceeding with respect to Taxes. Such
cooperation will include the retention and (upon another partys request) the
provision of records and information which are reasonably relevant to any such
action or other proceeding and making employees available on a mutually
convenient basis to provide additional information and explanation of any
material provided hereunder.

(c) Taxes for any Straddle Period will be allocable between the Pre-Closing
Tax Period and the Post-Closing Tax Period as follows: (i) in the case of any
Taxes other than property and other ad valorem Taxes, Taxes allocable to
the Pre-Closing Tax Period will be determined based on an interim closing of
the books as of the close of business on the Closing Date (and in the case of
any Taxes attributable to the ownership of any equity interest in any
partnership or other "flowthrough" entity or "controlled foreign corporation"
(within the meaning of Section 957(a) of the Code or any comparable state,
local or foreign Legal Requirement), as if the taxable period of such
partnership or other "flowthrough" entity or "controlled foreign corporation"
ended as of the end of the Closing Date), except that exemptions, allowances
or deductions that are calculated on an annual basis (including depreciation
and amortization deductions, other than with respect to property placed in
service after the Closing), shall be allocated on a per diem basis, and (ii)
the amount of any property and other ad valorem Taxes allocable to the Pre-
Closing Tax Period will be deemed to be the amount of such Tax for the entire
taxable period multiplied by a fraction, the numerator of which is the number
of days from (and including) the first day of such taxable period through
(and including) the Closing Date, and the denominator of which is the total
number of days in such Straddle Period.



 



63\. (d) With respect to any audit, examination or similar proceeding with respect
to Taxes of the Company and its Subsidiaries (each a " _Tax Claim_ ") that
relates to Taxes that could form the basis for a claim of indemnification
pursuant to Section 8.3 or otherwise, Parent shall have the right to control
such Tax Claim, including the defense and settlement thereof, at the sole
cost and expense of the Escrow Equity Holders; provided that Parent (i) will
keep the Stockholders Representative reasonably informed concerning the
progress of such Tax Claim, (ii) will provide the Stockholders
Representative with copies of all material correspondence and other documents
relevant to the Tax Claim, and (iii) will not settle such Tax Claim without
the consent of the Stockholders Representative, which consent will not be
unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed; provided further, however, that
(A) the consent of the Stockholders Representative with respect to any
settlement of any such Tax Claim shall be deemed to have been given unless
the Stockholders Representative shall have objected within 20 days after a
written request for such consent by Parent, and (B) the obligation of the
Escrow Equity Holders to pay any costs or expenses relating to such Tax Claim
shall be funded solely from any available Escrow Funds. Notwithstanding
anything to the contrary contained in this Agreement, to the extent the
procedures set forth in this Section 5.6(d) conflict with the procedures set
forth in Section 8.5 with respect to the conduct of a Tax Claim, the
procedures set forth in this Section 5.6(d) shall control.

 

(e) All Transfer Taxes will be paid 50% by Parent and 50% by the Escrow Equity
Holders when due, and the person(s) required to do so by applicable law will
file all necessary Tax Returns and other documentation with respect to all
such Transfer Taxes, with expenses resulting from such filing or documentation
paid 50% by Parent and 50% by the Escrow Equity Holders. The portion of
any Transfer Taxes payable by the Escrow Equity Holders shall be paid by an
appropriate adjustment to the Final Cash Merger Consideration in connection
with the calculation of the Estimated Cash Merger Consideration at the Closing
or the Final Cash Merger Consideration after the Closing or, if the amount
cannot be determined at such time, by an appropriate payment from the Escrow
Fund.

 

5.7 Employee Benefit Arrangements.

 

(a) Each employee who remains employed by the Company Group immediately prior
to the Closing (whether actively or inactively), and actually commences
employment with Parent (or its Affiliates) in accordance with this Section 5.7
are referred to collectively herein as the " _Transferred Employees_ ".

 

(b) Parent shall permit Transferred Employees (and their spouses and
dependents) to participate in its "employee welfare benefit plans" as defined
under ERISA (including without limitation health insurance plans) in which
similarly situated employees of Parent are generally eligible to participate,
with coverage effective immediately on the Closing Date (and
without exclusion from coverage on account of any pre-existing condition
except to the extent such persons were subject to such pre-existing condition
limitations under the Companys group health plan). Transferred Employees
service with the Company (and any predecessors of the Company) will be deemed
as service with Parent for purposes of eligibility, waiting periods, vesting
periods and benefits based on length of service, and calculation of vacation
and severance benefits, if applicable (other than benefit accrual under a
defined benefit pension plan and except that solely with respect to the
Parents discretionary contributions to the 401(k) plan, service time for
Transferred Employees will be measured on and after the Closing Date), and
with any credit under any welfare plan for any deductibles or co-insurance
paid for the current plan year under any plan maintained by the Company.



 



64\. (c) Effective no later than one (1) Business Day prior to the Closing Date,
the Company shall terminate any and all Company Employee Plans intended to
qualify as a qualified cash or deferred arrangement under Section 401(k) of
the Code (" _Company DC Plans_ "), and effective no later than the day
prior to the Closing Date no Transferred Employee or other Person shall have
any right thereafter to contribute any amounts to any Company DC Plan. At the
request of Parent, the Company shall provide Parent with evidence that each
such Company DC Plan has been terminated effective no later than the day
prior to the Closing Date pursuant to resolutions duly adopted by the board of
directors of the Company or such other applicable governing body or committee
thereof of the Company or its Subsidiaries. Parent shall use reasonable
efforts to allow the Transferred Employee to make eligible rollover
contributions to the Parents defined contribution plan of their account
balances, including loans, under the Company DC Plans following the Closing.

(d) This Section 5.7 will operate exclusively for the benefit of the parties
to this Agreement and no provision of this Agreement shall create any third-
party beneficiary rights of any employee or former employee (including any
beneficiary or dependent thereof) of the Company with respect to continued
employment (or resumed employment) with Parent or the Company or in respect
of any other matter.

(e) (i) At least five Business Days prior to the Closing Date, the Company
shall submit for approval by its stockholders, in conformance with Section
280G of the Code and the regulations thereunder (the " _280G Stockholder Vote_
"), any payments that could constitute a "parachute payment" pursuant
to Section 280G of the Code (each, a " _Parachute Payment_ ") on behalf of
each "disqualified individual" (as defined in Section 280G of the Code and the
regulations promulgated thereunder), (ii) at least seven Business Days prior
to the Closing Date, the Company shall have taken commercially reasonable
efforts to obtain an irrevocable waiver of the right to any Parachute Payment
from each of the applicable "disqualified individuals" (as defined under
Section 280G of the Code and the regulations promulgated thereunder) and (iii)
the Company shall have delivered to Parent true and complete copies of all
disclosure and other related documents that will be provided to the Companys
shareholders in connection with the 280G Stockholder Vote in a manner
providing Parent with sufficient time to review and comment thereon, and shall
reflect all reasonable comments of Parent thereon. Prior to the Closing Date,
the Company shall deliver to Parent evidence reasonably satisfactory to
Parent that a vote of the Company Stockholders was solicited in accordance
with the foregoing provisions of this Section 5.7(e) and that either (i) the
requisite number of votes of the Company Stockholders was obtained with
respect to any Parachute Payment (the " _280G Approval_ ") or (ii) the 280G
Approval was not obtained, and, as a consequence, any waived Parachute
Payments shall not be made or provided.

(a) by Parent at any time prior to the Effective Time, if a breach of any
representation or warranty or failure to perform any covenant or obligation
contained in this Agreement on the part of the Company shall have occurred
that (i) would cause a failure of the conditions in Section 6.2(a) or Section
6.2(b) to exist and (ii) cannot be cured by the Company by the Outside Date;
provided, however, that Parent shall not have the right to terminate this
Agreement pursuant to this Section 7.1(a) if either Parent or Merger Sub is

other agreement hereunder that would result in the conditions to Closing set
forth in Section 6.3(a) or Section 6.3(b) not being satisfied;

 

(b) by the Company at any time prior to the Effective Time, if a breach of any
representation or warranty or failure to perform any covenant or obligation
contained in this Agreement on the part of Parent or Merger Sub shall have
occurred that (i) would cause a failure of the conditions in Section 6.3(a) or
Section 6.3(b) to exist and (ii) cannot be cured by Parent or Merger Sub by

been satisfied (other than those that, by their nature, are to be satisfied

any obligation or Liability arising from any prior breach by such party of

SECTION 8. INDEMNIFICATION, ETC.

 

8.1 Effectiveness. The provisions of this Section 8 shall apply and become
effective only if the Merger is consummated.

  



68\. 8.2 Survival. The representations and warranties contained in this Agreement
and in any certificate delivered at the Closing pursuant to this Agreement
shall survive the Closing until the 12 month anniversary of the Closing (the "
_Cut-Off Date_"). No claim for indemnification pursuant to Section 8.3 may be
brought after the Cut-Off Date, except for claims of which the Stockholders
Representative has been notified in writing with reasonable specificity
by Parent prior to the Cut-Off Date. The post-Closing covenants contained in
this Agreement shall survive in accordance with their respective terms.

 

8.3 Indemnification of the Parent Indemnitees. Subject to the terms contained
in this Section 8, the Parent Indemnitees shall be entitled to
indemnification from the Escrow Equity Holders, severally (and not jointly),
pro rata based upon each such Escrow Equity Holders Pro Rata Share, with
respect to (a) Damages incurred by any of the Parent Indemnitees arising
out of or as a result of: (i) any inaccuracy in or breach of any of the
representations or warranties of the Company contained in Section 2 as of the
date of this Agreement or at Closing (or, in the case of any representation or
warranty made as of a specific date, as of such date); (ii) the failure of
the Company to perform any of its covenants or agreements contained herein
required to be performed prior to the Closing; (iii) any Dissenting Shares; or

Company Warrants or Company Options; and (b) Damages incurred by any of the
Parent Indemnitees as a result of any claim related to the matters set forth
on Section 8.3 of the Disclosure Schedule.

8.4 Procedure Relative to Indemnification.

 

(a) In the event that any Parent Indemnitee shall claim that it is entitled to
be indemnified, defended or held harmless pursuant to the terms of this
Section 8 (each, a " _Claim_ "), such party (the " _Claiming Party_ ") shall
promptly notify the Stockholders Representative (the " _Indemnifying Party_
") in writing (a " _Claim Notice_ ") of such Claim promptly after the
Claiming Party receives notice of any action, Legal Proceeding, demand or
assessment or otherwise has received notice of any claim of a third party
(a " _Third-Party Claim_ ") that may reasonably be expected to result in a
Claim by the Claiming Party against the Indemnifying Party; provided that the
failure to promptly provide such notice shall not affect the rights of
the Claiming Party to indemnification hereunder unless the Indemnifying Party
is actually and materially prejudiced by such failure. The Claim Notice shall
specify the basis for the Claim and the Damages incurred by, or imposed upon,
the Claiming Party on account thereof. If such Damages are liquidated in
amount, the Claim Notice shall so state and such amount shall be deemed the
amount of the Claim of the Claiming Party. If the amount is not liquidated,
the Claim Notice shall so state and in such event a Claim shall be deemed
asserted against the Indemnifying Party on behalf of the Claiming Party, but
no payment shall be made on account thereof until the amount of such claim is
liquidated and the Claim is finally determined.

 

(b) The following provisions shall apply to Claims of the Claiming Party which
are based upon a Third-Party Claim (including any form of Legal Proceeding
filed or instituted by any Governmental Body):

(i) The Indemnifying Party shall have the right, upon receipt of the Claim
Notice and at its expense, to defend such Third-Party Claim in its own name
or, if necessary, in the name of the Claiming Party; _provided_ that any
Claiming Party shall be (1) entitled to participate in any such defense
with counsel of its own choice at its own expense and (2) shall be entitled
to participate in any such defense with counsel of its own choice at the
expense of the

 



69\.  Indemnifying Party if representation of both parties by the same counsel
creates a conflict of interest under applicable standards of professional
conduct. The Claiming Party shall cooperate with and make available to the
Indemnifying Party such assistance and materials as may be reasonably
requested of the Claiming Party, and the Claiming Party shall have the right,
at the Claiming Partys expense, to participate in the defense.
The Indemnifying Party shall have the right to settle and compromise such
Third-Party Claim only with the consent of the Claiming Party (which consent
shall not be unreasonably withheld or delayed) unless there is no finding or
admission of any violation of Legal Requirements, any violation of the rights
of any Person, any admission of wrongdoing and no effect on any other Claims
that may be made against the Claiming Party, the terms of the settlement or
compromise will remain confidential except as otherwise may be required by
applicable Legal Requirements and the sole relief provided is monetary damages
that are paid in full by the Indemnifying Party.

 

(ii) If the Indemnifying Party fails to take reasonable steps necessary to
defend diligently the action or proceeding within thirty (30) days after
receiving a Claim Notice with respect to the Third-Party Claim, or shall
notify the Claiming Party that the Indemnifying Party does not assume the
defense of the Third-Party Claim, then the Claiming Party shall have the right
to conduct a defense against such Third-Party Claim, the fees and expenses of
its counsel will be covered by the indemnity provided for in this Section 8
and the Claiming Party shall have the right to settle and compromise such
Third-Party Claim if it acts reasonably and in good faith upon ten (10) days
notice to, but without having to first obtain the consent of, the Indemnifying
Party.

 

(iii) Notwithstanding the foregoing, if (i) a Claiming Party determines in
good faith that it is reasonably likely that a Third-Party Claim may
materially adversely affect it other than solely as a result of monetary
damages for which it could be entitled to indemnification under this
Agreement, or (ii) a Third-Party Claim is based on an investigation, inquiry,
or other proceeding by a Governmental Body, the Claiming Party may, by notice
to the Indemnifying Party, assume the exclusive right to defend, compromise or
settle such Third-Party Claim at the Indemnifying Partys expense; _provided_
that no compromise, discharge or settlement of, or admission of liability in
connection with, such claims may be effected by the Claiming Party without the
Indemnifying Partys written consent (which shall not be unreasonably
withheld, conditioned or delayed).

(iv) The Indemnifying Party shall take reasonable steps to ensure that the
Claiming Party is kept duly and timely informed with respect to the status of
the Third-Party Claim and the defense thereof, shall respond to any reasonable
queries from the Claiming Party with respect to the same, and shall, in
conducting the defense and investigation of a Third-Party Claim, take into
account any reasonable requests of the Claiming Party.

(c) Upon receipt of a Claim Notice that does not involve a Third-Party Claim,
the Indemnifying Party shall have thirty (30) days from the receipt of such
Claim Notice to notify the Claiming Party that the Indemnifying Party disputes
such Claim. If the Indemnifying Party does not timely notify the Claiming
Party of such dispute, then the amount of such Claim shall be deemed,
conclusively, a Liability of the Indemnifying Party hereunder. If the
Indemnifying Party does timely notify the Claiming Party of such dispute, then
the Claiming Party shall have thirty (30) days to respond in a written
statement to the objection of the Indemnifying Party. If after such thirty
(30)-day period there remains a dispute as to any such Claim, then
the Claiming Party and the Indemnifying Party shall attempt in good faith for
a period not to exceed thirty (30) additional days to agree upon the rights of
the respective parties with respect to such Claim. If the parties should so
agree, a memorandum setting forth such agreement shall be prepared and signed
by the Parent and the Stockholders Representative. If the parties do not
agree within such additional thirty (30)-day period, then the Claiming Party
may pursue any and all other remedies available to it hereunder.

 



70\. (d) Each party shall bear its own costs in defending or disputing the Claim by
the Claiming Party under this Section 8\.

(e) For purposes of this Section 8, all references to the Indemnifying Party
shall be deemed (except for provisions relating to an obligation to make or a
right to receive any payments) to refer to the Stockholders Representative
acting on behalf of the Escrow Equity Holders.

 

8.5 Limits on Indemnification.

 

(a) Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, for the purpose of
determining the amount of Damages that are subject to a claim for
indemnification under Section 8.3, each representation and warranty in this
Agreement (including any referenced Disclosure Schedule), shall be read
without giving effect to the term "material" or "Material Adverse Effect" (as
if such word(s) were deleted therefrom).

(b) Deductible. Notwithstanding anything contained in the Transaction
Documents to the contrary, the Escrow Equity Holders shall not be obligated to
indemnify, defend or hold harmless any Parent Indemnitee with respect to any
Damages from any Claim or Claims under Section 8.3(a) until the
aggregate Damages from all Claims exceed $13,500,000 and then only with
respect to the amount of Damages in excess of that amount.

(c) Escrow as Liability Cap and Exclusive Remedy. The aggregate maximum
liability (and the aggregate maximum amount of all payments paid or to be
payable by any Escrow Equity Holder) of any such Escrow Equity Holder for
Damages pursuant to Section 8.3 shall not exceed in the aggregate, such
Escrow Equity Holders Pro Rata Share of the Escrow Fund (as to each such
Escrow Equity Holder, the " _Liability Cap_ "). The Escrow Fund shall be the
sole source of recovery with respect to any amounts owed for Damages pursuant
to Section 8.3. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the parties acknowledge that
separate coverage may be available under the RandW Policy. In respect of any
Claim pursuant to Section 8.3(a)(i) for which the insurers are liable under
the RandW Policy (taking into account the applicable retention and exclusions
under the RandW Policy), the Parent Indemnitees must first proceed with a claim
under the RandW Policy before bringing a claim against the Escrow Funds under
this Section 8, provided that the Parent Indemnitees may also provide the
Stockholders Representative with notice of a Claim hereunder for purposes of
tolling the expiration of rights to indemnification under Section 8.3. In the
event the Closing occurs after June 23, 2019, the Company shall cooperate with
Parent in good faith (e.g., by updating the Disclosure Schedule and related
diligence to the extent requested by the insurance companies under the RandW
Policy) if Parent requests in connection with Parents undertaking to obtain
coverage under the RandW Policy for the accuracy of the Companys
representations and warranties in Section 2 as of the Closing, it being
understood that Parent will bear the cost of any additional premiums, fees or
other costs to obtain such coverage.



 



71\. (d) Liability For Known Claims. The right of a Parent Indemnitee to
indemnification or to assert or recover on any Claim shall not be affected by
any investigation conducted with respect to, or any knowledge acquired at any
time, whether before or after the execution and delivery of this Agreement or
the Closing Date.

 

(e) Cut-Off Date. Any Claim, except as expressly provided in Section 8.2,
not submitted in writing to the Indemnifying Party prior to the Cut-Off Date
shall be deemed to have been waived and shall be absolutely and forever barred
and unenforceable, null and void, and of no force or effect whatsoever and
the indemnifying party shall have no further liability with respect thereto.

(f) Treatment of Insurance. With respect to each Claim, the Claiming Party
(or in the case of a Claim by any Parent Indemnitee after Closing, the
Surviving Corporation and its Subsidiaries) shall use reasonable efforts to
assert all claims under all applicable insurance policies, and any Damages
that may be recovered by the Claiming Party with respect to such Claim shall
be net of any insurance proceeds received with respect thereto. To the extent
that insurance proceeds are collected after a Claim has been settled, the
Claiming Party shall restore the Indemnifying Party to the same economic
position as would have existed had such insurance proceeds been collected
prior to the settlement of such Claim.

 

(g) Right of Subrogation. If any of the Damages for which an Indemnifying
Party is responsible or allegedly responsible under this Section 8 are
recoverable or reasonably likely to be recoverable against any third party at
the time that payment is due hereunder, the Claiming Party shall assign any
and all rights that it may have to recover such Damages to the Indemnifying
Party or, if such rights are not assignable for any reason, the Claiming Party
shall attempt in good faith to collect any and all such Damages on account
thereof from such third party for the benefit of the Indemnifying Party.
The Claiming Party shall reimburse the Indemnifying Party for any and all
Damages paid by the Indemnifying Party to the Claiming Party pursuant to this
Agreement to the extent such amount is subsequently paid to the Claiming Party
by any Person other than the Indemnifying Party.

(h) No Duplication of Recovery. Notwithstanding anything contained in the
Transaction Documents to the contrary, no Parent Indemnitee may recover
duplicative Damages in respect of a single set of facts or circumstances under
more than one representation or warranty in the Transaction Documents
regardless of whether such facts or circumstances would give rise to a breach
of more than one representation or warranty in this Agreement.

(i) Duty to Mitigate. Parent shall take and shall cause its Affiliates to
take all commercially reasonable steps to mitigate any Damages upon becoming
aware of any event which would reasonably be expected to, or does, give rise
thereto, including incurring costs only to the minimum extent necessary to
remedy the breach which gives rise to the Damages.

8.6 Exclusive Remedies. Subject to the following sentence and Section 8.7
below, but notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained elsewhere in
this Agreement, recourse to the Escrow Fund pursuant to a Claim made pursuant
to (and subject to the limitations and conditions of) this Section 8 shall be
the Parent Indemnitees sole and exclusive remedy following the Closing in
respect of any and all claims, causes of action, or other Damages or
Liabilities arising out of or relating to the Merger and the
Transactions (irrespective of the cause of action, whether in contract, in
tort, by way of strict liability or otherwise). Except as otherwise provided
herein, no current or former member, director, officer, employee, affiliate or
advisor of the Company Group shall have any personal or individual liability
of any nature, before or after the Closing, to Parent, Merger Sub

 



72\.  or any other Parent Indemnitees with respect to any breach of any
representation, warranty, covenant or obligation set forth in, or any other
breach of, this Agreement or otherwise arising out of or relating to the
Transactions. In the event that the foregoing waiver is not effective for any
reason, then Parent and Merger Sub agree that all of the limitations of
liability contained in this Section 8, including, without limitation,
those regarding survival, thresholds, caps and deductibles, as well as the
procedural steps set forth in this Section 8, shall apply to any monetary
remedy available to Parent and Merger Sub.

 

8.7 No Limitation on Common Law Fraud Claims. Nothing in this Agreement shall
(i) prevent a party from bringing a common law action for actual fraud with
intent to deceive against any Person whose own such fraud has caused such
party to incur Damages or (ii) limit the Damages recoverable by a party in
such common law fraud action; provided, however, that no such party shall be
entitled to recover more than once for the same Damages.

8.8 Treatment of Indemnification Payments. For the avoidance of doubt, all
indemnification and similar payments made pursuant to this Agreement shall be
treated as an adjustment to the Final Cash Merger Consideration for all
purposes, including U.S. federal income tax purposes, unless otherwise
required by applicable Legal Requirements.

SECTION 9. INDEMNIFICATION PAYMENTS AND INDEMNIFICATION ESCROW.

9.1 Claims for Damages specified in any Claim Notice to which an Indemnifying
Party has not objected in writing within thirty (30) days of receipt of such
Claim Notice pursuant to Section 8.5(a) or Section 8.5(c), as applicable,
claims for Damages covered by a memorandum of agreement of the nature
described in Section 8.5(c), and claims for Damages the validity and amount
of which have been the subject of judicial determination or settlement
pursuant to Section 8.5(b) are hereinafter referred to, collectively, as the "
_Agreed Claims_ ". Within ten (10) Business Days of the determination of the
amount of any Agreed Claim (or at such other time as the Claiming Party and
the Indemnifying Party shall agree), the Indemnifying Party shall pay to the
Claiming Party an amount equal to the Agreed Claim by wire transfer in
immediately available funds to the bank account designated by the Claiming
Party in a notice to the Indemnifying Party within three (3) Business Days
prior to such payment.

 

9.2 On the Cut-Off Date, the Stockholders Representative shall deliver to
Parent in writing the Stockholders Representatives determination of the
portion of the remaining amount of the Escrow Fund, _minus_ the amount, if
any, of the Unresolved Claims as of the Cut-Off Date (the " _Escrow
Remainder_ ") payable to each Escrow Equity Holder pursuant to this Agreement
based on such Escrow Equity Holders Pro Rata Share, and Parent and the
Stockholders Representative shall jointly instruct the Escrow Agent to pay
each such Escrow Equity Holder entitled to receive a portion of such amount,
within three (3) Business Days of delivery of such joint instruction, the
amount set forth in the Stockholders Representatives notice to Parent
(provided that the aggregate amount payable to all such Escrow Equity Holders
pursuant to this Section 9.2 shall not exceed the Escrow Remainder, and Parent
and the Stockholders Representative shall jointly instruct the Escrow Agent
to remit such funds to the Surviving Corporation, the receipt of such funds
being a condition to this obligation).



 



73\. 9.3 Upon final resolution of any Unresolved Claim in respect of which an
amount (" _Resolved Claim Amount_ ") had been retained (to the extent not
utilized to satisfy valid claims for indemnification pursuant to Section 8.3),
the Stockholders Representative shall deliver to Parent in writing
the Stockholders Representatives determination of the portion of such
Resolved Claim Amount payable to each Escrow Equity Holder pursuant to this
Agreement based on such Escrow Equity Holders Pro Rata Share, and Parent and
the Stockholders Representative shall jointly instruct the Escrow Agent to
pay each such Escrow Equity Holder entitled to receive a portion of such
amount, within three (3) Business Days of delivery of such joint instruction,
the amount set forth in the Stockholders Representatives notice to Parent
(provided that the aggregate amount payable to all such Escrow Equity Holders
pursuant to this Section 9.3 shall not exceed the Resolved Claim Amount).

 

SECTION 10. MISCELLANEOUS PROVISIONS

 

10.1 Stockholders Representative.

 

(a) Appointment. By virtue of the adoption of this Agreement, by voting in
favor of the adoption of this Agreement, by the approval of the principal
terms of the Merger, and/or by the consummation of the Merger or participating
in the Merger and receiving the benefits thereof, including the right to
receive the consideration payable in connection with the Merger, each of the
Effective Time Holders shall be deemed to have hereby irrevocably nominated,
constituted and appointed the Stockholders Representative as the
representative, agent and true and lawful attorney-in-fact of each of the
Effective Time Holders, with full power of substitution, to act in the name,
place and stead of each of the Effective Time Holders for purposes of
executing, delivering, acknowledging, certifying and filing any documents,
agreements and instruments and taking any actions that the Stockholders
Representative may, in its sole discretion, determine to be necessary,
desirable or appropriate in connection with this Agreement and the
Transaction Documents.

(b) Authority. The Effective Time Holders hereby grant to the
Stockholders Representative full authority to execute, deliver, acknowledge,
certify and file on behalf of the Effective Time Holders (in the name of any
or all of the Effective Time Holders or otherwise) any and all documents,
agreements and instruments that the Stockholders Representative may, in its
sole discretion, determine to be necessary, desirable or appropriate, in such
forms and containing such provisions as the Stockholders Representative may,
in its sole discretion, determine to be appropriate, in performing its duties
as contemplated by Section 10.1(a). In furtherance of the foregoing, and
without any limitation thereof, the Effective Time Holders hereby grant to the
Stockholders Representative full authority over any decisions in respect of
(1) the calculations of the Payout Spreadsheet pursuant to this Agreement, (2)
the negotiation, execution and delivery of the Escrow Agreement, (3) any
amendment to this Agreement or the Escrow Agreement or any other Transaction
Document, (4) adjustments of and distributions from the Escrow Fund and SR
Expense Fund and (5) the prosecution, defense and settlement, as applicable,
of any Claims for indemnification pursuant to Section 8\. Notwithstanding
anything to the contrary contained in this Agreement or in any other agreement
executed in connection with the Transactions, after the Closing: (i) each
Parent Indemnitee shall be entitled to deal exclusively with the
Stockholders Representative on all matters relating to Section 1.9 or
relating to any claim for indemnification, compensation or reimbursement under
Section 8 or under the Escrow Agreement; and (ii) each Parent Indemnitee
shall be entitled to rely conclusively (without further evidence of any kind
whatsoever) on any document executed or purported to be executed on behalf of
any Effective Time Holder by the Stockholders Representative, and on
any other action taken or purported to be taken on behalf of any Effective
Time Holder by the Stockholders Representative, as fully binding upon such
Effective Time Holder.

 



74\. (c) Power of Attorney. The Effective Time Holders recognize and intend that
the power of attorney granted in Section 10.1(a): (i) is coupled with an
interest and is irrevocable; (ii) may be delegated by the Stockholders
Representative; and (iii) shall survive the death or incapacity of any
Effective Time Holder.

(d) Replacement. If the Stockholders Representative shall die, resign, become
disabled or otherwise be unable to fulfill its responsibilities hereunder,
the Effective Time Holders shall (by consent of those Persons entitled to at
least a majority of the Company Common Aggregate Merger Consideration), within
thirty (30) days after such death, disability or inability, appoint a
successor to the Stockholders Representative (who shall be reasonably
satisfactory to Parent) and immediately thereafter notify Parent of the
identity of such successor. Any such successor shall succeed
the Stockholders Representative as the " _Stockholders  Representative_"
hereunder. If for any reason there is no Stockholders Representative at any
time, all references herein to the Stockholders Representative shall be
deemed to refer to the Escrow Equity Holders entitled to at least a majority
of the Company Common Aggregate Merger Consideration.

 

(e) SR Expense Fund. The SR Expense Fund will be used to pay costs, fees and
expenses incurred by or for the benefit of the Effective Time Holders on or
after the Closing Date. The Effective Time Holders will not receive any
interest or earnings on the SR Expense Fund. The Stockholders Representative
will hold the SR Expense Fund separate from its corporate funds, will not use
such funds for its operating expenses or any other corporate purposes and will
not make these funds available to its creditors in the event of bankruptcy. As
soon as practicable following the completion of the
Stockholders Representatives responsibilities, the Stockholders
Representative will deliver the remaining balance of the SR Expense Fund to
the Payments Administrator for further distribution to the Escrow Equity
Holders based on their respective SR Expense Fund Shares. For tax purposes,
the SR Expense Fund will be treated as having been received and voluntarily
set aside by the Escrow Equity Holders at the time of Closing. Any amounts
required to be withheld with respect to the SR Expense Fund allocable to an
Effective Time Holder shall reduce the Cash Merger Consideration otherwise
payable to such Effective Time Holder in connection with the Closing and shall
not reduce the SR Expense Fund.

 

(f) Exculpation; Indemnification. The Stockholders Representative will incur
no liability of any kind with respect to any action or omission by the
Stockholders Representative in connection with the Stockholders
Representatives services pursuant to this Agreement or the Transaction
Documents, except in the event of liability directly resulting from the
Stockholders Representatives gross negligence or willful misconduct. The
Effective Time Holders will indemnify, defend and hold harmless the
Stockholders Representative from and against any and all losses, liabilities,
damages, claims, penalties, fines, forfeitures, actions, fees, costs and
expenses (including the fees and expenses of counsel and experts and their
staffs and all expense of document location, duplication and shipment)
(collectively, " _Representative Losses_ ") arising out of or in connection
with the Stockholders Representatives execution and performance of this
Agreement and the Transaction Documents, in each case as such Representative
Loss is suffered or incurred; provided that, in the event that any such
Representative Loss is finally adjudicated to have been directly caused by the
gross negligence or willful misconduct of the Stockholders Representative,
the Stockholders Representative will reimburse the Effective Time Holders
the amount of such indemnified Representative Loss to the extent attributable
to such gross negligence or willful misconduct. If not paid directly to the
Stockholders Representative by the Effective Time Holders, any such
Representative Losses may be recovered by the Stockholders Representative
from the Escrow Fund and SR Expense Fund at such time as remaining amounts
would otherwise be 

 



75\.  distributable to the Escrow Equity Holders; provided that, while this
section allows the Stockholders Representative to be paid from the Escrow
Fund and SR Expense Fund, this does not relieve the Effective Time Holders
from their obligation to promptly pay such Representative Losses as they are
suffered or incurred, nor does it prevent the Stockholders Representative
from seeking any remedies available to it at law or otherwise. In no event
will the Stockholders Representative be required to advance its own funds on
behalf of the Effective Time Holders or otherwise. Notwithstanding anything in
this Agreement to the contrary, any restrictions or limitations on indemnity
set forth elsewhere in this Agreement are not intended to be applicable to the
indemnities provided to the Stockholders Representative in this Section
10.1(e). The Effective Time Holders acknowledge and agree that the foregoing
indemnities will survive the resignation or removal of the Stockholders
Representative or the termination of this Agreement.

 

10.2 Amendment; Waiver.

 

(a) This Agreement (and/or any provision hereof) may be amended or waived if,
but only if: (i) at any time prior to the consummation of the Closing, such
amendment or waiver is in writing and is signed by Parent and the Company
(provided, however, that, after obtaining the approval of this Agreement by
the Companys stockholders and prior to the Closing, there shall not be made
any amendment or waiver that by any Legal Requirement requires the further
approval of the Companys stockholders without the further approval of such
shareholders); and (ii) if the Closing occurs, at any time after
the consummation of the Closing, such amendment or waiver is in writing and
is signed by Parent and the Stockholders Representative (it being
acknowledged and agreed that, after the Closing, the Stockholders
Representative may amend this Agreement and waive matters on behalf of the
Company Stockholders, all as contemplated by Section 10.1). To the extent any
amendment or waiver to this Section 10.2(a), Section 10.7, Section 10.8,
Section 10.11 or Section 10.12 is sought which is materially adverse to the
rights of the Financing Source, the prior written consent of the Financing
Source shall be required before such amendment or waiver is rendered
effective.

 

(b) No party shall be deemed to have waived any claim arising out of this
Agreement, or any power, right, privilege or remedy under this Agreement,
unless the waiver of such claim, power, right, privilege or remedy is
expressly set forth in a written instrument duly executed and delivered on
behalf of such party; and any such waiver shall not be applicable or have any
effect except in the specific instance in which it is given.

(c) No failure on the part of any party to exercise any power, right,
privilege or remedy under this Agreement, and no delay on the part of any
party in exercising any power, right, privilege or remedy under this
Agreement, shall operate as a waiver of such power, right, privilege or
remedy; and no single or partial exercise of any such power, right, privilege
or remedy shall preclude any other or further exercise thereof or of any other
power, right, privilege or remedy.

 

10.3 Fees and Expenses. Except as otherwise provided herein or in any
Transaction Document, each party to this Agreement shall bear and pay all
fees, costs and expenses (including legal fees and accounting fees) that have
been incurred or that are incurred by such party in connection with the
Transactions, including all fees, costs and expenses incurred by such party in
connection with or by virtue of: (a) the investigation and review conducted
by Parent and its Representatives with respect to the Companys business (and
the furnishing of information to Parent and its Representatives in connection
with such investigation and review), (b) the negotiation, preparation and
review of this Agreement (including the Disclosure Schedule) and all
agreements,

 



76\.  certificates, opinions and other instruments and documents delivered or to
be delivered in connection with the Transactions, (c) the preparation and
submission of any filing or notice required to be made or given in connection
with any of the Transactions, and the obtaining of any consent required to be
obtained in connection with any of such transactions, and (d) the consummation
of the Merger. In the case of the Company, all Company Transaction Expenses
shall be deducted from the amount otherwise payable as the Estimated Cash
Merger Consideration or Post-Closing Merger Consideration under this
Agreement.

 

10.4 Notices. Any notice or other communication required or permitted to be
delivered to any party under this Agreement shall be in writing and shall be
deemed properly delivered, given and received (a) when delivered by hand, by
registered mail, by courier or express delivery service or (b) upon
confirmation of receipt (other than an automatically-generated confirmation)
when sent by electronic mail to the address or email address, as applicable,
set forth beneath the name of such party below (or to such other address or
email address, as applicable, as such party shall have specified in a
written notice given to the other parties hereto):

convenience of reference only, shall not be deemed to be a part of this
Agreement and shall not be referred to in connection with the construction or
interpretation of this Agreement.

 

10.6 Counterparts. This Agreement may be executed in several counterparts,
each of which shall constitute an original and all of which, when taken
together, shall constitute one agreement.

10.7 Governing Law; Jurisdiction and Venue; Waiver of Jury Trial.
This Agreement and all claims and causes of action arising hereunder, whether
in contract or tort or otherwise, shall be construed in accordance with, and
governed in all respects by, the internal laws of the State of Delaware
(without giving effect to principles of conflicts of laws). Except as
required by applicable Legal Requirements (including Communications Laws),
with respect to any Legal Proceeding resulting from, relating to or arising
out of this Agreement, each of the parties hereto irrevocably and
unconditionally submits to the exclusive jurisdiction of the Court of Chancery
of the State of Delaware or, if such court will not accept jurisdiction, the
Superior Court of the State of Delaware or any other court of competent
civil jurisdiction sitting in Delaware. In any such Legal Proceeding, each of
the parties hereto irrevocably and unconditionally waives and agrees not to
assert by way of motion, as a defense or otherwise (a) any claim that it is
not subject to the jurisdiction of the above courts, (b) that its property is
exempt or immune from attachment or execution, (c) that such Legal Proceeding
is brought in an inconvenient forum, (d) that the venue of such Legal
Proceeding is improper, and (e) that such Legal Proceeding should be
transferred or removed to any court other than one of the above-named courts,
or should be stayed by reason of the pendency of some other Legal Proceeding
in any other court other than one of the above-named courts, or that this
Agreement or the subject matter hereof may not be enforced in or by such
courts. Each of the parties hereto hereby agrees not to commence any Legal
Proceeding other than before one of the above-named courts. Each of the
parties hereto also hereby agrees that any final and unappealable judgment
against a party in connection with any such Legal Proceeding shall be
conclusive and binding on such party and that such judgment may be enforced in
any court of competent jurisdiction, either within or outside of the United
States. Each of the parties to this Agreement irrevocably agrees that, except
as specifically set forth in the Commitment Letter, all claims or causes of
action, whether at

 



78\.  law or in equity, whether in contract, in tort or otherwise, against the
Financing Source under the Commitment Letter in any way relating to this
Agreement or any of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement,
including, but not limited to, any dispute arising out of or relating in any
way to the Commitment Letter or the performance thereof, shall be exclusively
governed by, and construed in accordance with, the internal laws of the State
of New York, without giving effect to the principles or rules or conflict of
laws to the extent such principles or rules would require or permit the
applicable of laws of another jurisdiction. Each of the parties to this
Agreement hereto agrees that it will not bring or support any action, cause
of action, claim, cross claim or third party claim of any kind or description,
whether in law or in equity, whether in contract or in tort or otherwise,
against the Financing Source under the Commitment Letter in any way relating
to this Agreement or any of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement,
including, but not limited to, any dispute arising out of or relating in any
way to the Commitment Letter or the performance thereof, in any forum other
than any state or federal court sitting in the State of New York. Each party
hereby waives its rights to a jury trial of any claim or cause of action based
upon or arising out of this Agreement or the subject matter hereof, including
but not limited to any dispute against the Financing Source arising out of or
relating to the Commitment Letter or performance thereunder. The scope of this
waiver is intended to be all-encompassing of any and all disputes that may be
filed in any court and that relate to the subject matter of this transaction,
including, without limitation, contract claims, tort claims
(including negligence), breach of duty claims, and all other common law and
statutory claims. This section has been fully discussed by each of the parties
hereto and these provisions will not be subject to any exceptions.
Notwithstanding anything to the foregoing, the effects of the Merger shall be
governed by and construed in accordance with the laws of the State of Delaware
(including the DGCL).

 

10.8 Successors and Assigns. This Agreement shall be binding upon: the Company
and its successors and assigns (if any); Parent and its successors and
assigns (if any); Merger Sub and its successors and assigns (if any); and the
Stockholders Representative and its successors and assigns (if any). This
Agreement shall inure to the benefit of the parties, the Indemnitees and
the respective successors and assigns (if any) of the foregoing. Neither this
Agreement nor any of the rights, interests or obligations under it may be
assigned by any of the parties (whether by operation of law or otherwise)
without the prior written consent of the other parties, and any attempted or
purported assignment in violation of this Section 10.8 will be null and void;
_provided_ that this Agreement (including the rights, interests and
obligations under this Agreement) may be assigned by Parent (i) to any
Affiliate of it, (ii) by operation of any consolidation, merger or similar
transaction of Parent or any permitted assignee of it, it being understood and
agreed that no such assignment will relieve Parent or any successor of any of
its obligations hereunder unless the Company (or, if after the Effective Time,
the Stockholders Representative) consents to such assignment and expressly
consents in writing to such relief of Parent from its obligations, or (iii)
as collateral for the purpose of securing the obligations under any financing
arrangement, including the Financing.

 

10.9 Remedies Cumulative; Specific Performance.

 

(a) Except as provided by Section 8.6, the rights and remedies of the parties
hereto shall be cumulative (and not alternative). The parties to this
Agreement agree that, in the event of any breach or threatened breach by any
party to this Agreement of any covenant, obligation or other provision set
forth in this Agreement for the benefit of any other party to this
Agreement, such other party shall be entitled (in addition to any other
remedy that may be available to it) to: (a) a decree or order of specific
performance or mandamus to enforce the observance and performance of such
covenant, obligation or other provision, and (b) an injunction restraining
such breach or threatened breach.



 



79\. (b) Each party agrees not to raise any objections to the availability of the
equitable remedy of specific performance (other than on the basis that such
remedy is not available pursuant to the terms of this Agreement) to prevent or
restrain breaches of this Agreement by such party, and to specifically enforce
the terms and provisions of this Agreement, in each case when available
pursuant to the terms of this Agreement, to prevent breaches or threatened
breaches of, or to enforce compliance with, the covenants and obligations of
such party under this Agreement all in accordance with the terms of this
Section 10.9. Any party seeking an injunction or injunctions to prevent
breaches of this Agreement and to enforce specifically the terms and
provisions of this Agreement, in each case when available pursuant to the
terms of this Agreement, shall not be required to provide any bond or other
security in connection with such order or injunction all in accordance with
the terms of this Section 10.9.

 

10.10 Severability. Any term or provision of this Agreement that is invalid or
unenforceable in any situation in any jurisdiction shall not affect the
validity or enforceability of the remaining terms and provisions hereof or the
validity or enforceability of the offending term or provision in any other
