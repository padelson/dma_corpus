The Parties acknowledge and agree that each Party would be irreparably damaged if any of the provisions of this Agreement are not performed in accordance with their specific terms and that any breach of this Agreement by any Party could not be

specific performance and temporary, preliminary, and permanent injunctive relief to prevent breaches or threatened breaches of any of the provisions of this Agreement, without posting any bond or other undertaking. In the event that any action shall
be brought by a Party in equity to enforce the provisions of the Agreement, no other Party shall allege or assert, and each Party hereby waives the defense, that there is an adequate remedy at law or that the award of specific performance is not an
appropriate remedy for any reason of law or equity. If, by the End Date, any Party hereto brings any action to enforce specifically the performance of the terms and provisions hereof by any other Party, the End Date shall automatically be extended
