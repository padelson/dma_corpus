iii AGREEMENT AND PLAN OF MERGER

 

THIS AGREEMENT AND PLAN OF MERGER (this " _Agreement_ ") is made and entered
into as of December 12, 2016, by and among: Patterson-UTI Energy, Inc., a
Delaware corporation (" _Parent_ "); Pyramid Merger Sub, Inc., a Delaware
corporation and a direct wholly owned subsidiary of Parent (" _Merger Sub_ ");
and Seventy Seven Energy Inc., a Delaware corporation (the " _Company_ ").
Certain capitalized terms used in this Agreement are defined in _Section_ __ _
8.16_.

 

RECITALS

WHEREAS, Parent, Merger Sub, and the Company intend to effect a merger of
Merger Sub with and into the Company (the " _Merger_ ") in accordance with
this Agreement and the Delaware General Corporation Law (" _DGCL_ ").
Upon consummation of the Merger, Merger Sub will cease to exist and the
Company will become a wholly owned subsidiary of Parent;

WHEREAS, for U.S. federal income tax purposes, (a) it is intended that the
Merger qualify as a "reorganization" within the meaning of Section 368(a) of
the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the " _Code_ "), and (b)
this Agreement is intended to be and is hereby adopted as a "plan of
reorganization" for the Merger within the meaning of Treasury Regulations §§
1.368-2(g) and 1.368-3(a);

WHEREAS, the respective boards of directors of Parent, Merger Sub and the
Company have approved this Agreement and approved the Merger; and

WHEREAS, as an inducement to Parent to enter into this Agreement,
certain stockholders of the Company (the " _Voting Agreement Stockholders_ ")
have entered voting agreements and have executed the Company Holder Consent
dated as of the date of this Agreement.

 

NOW, THEREFORE, in consideration of the foregoing and the representations,
warranties, covenants and agreements herein contained, the parties to this
Agreement, intending to be legally bound, agree as follows:

ARTICLE 1

 

THE MERGER

1.1 _Merger of Merger Sub Into the Company_. Upon the terms and subject to
the conditions set forth in this Agreement, at the Effective Time, Merger Sub
shall be merged with and into the Company and the separate existence of Merger
Sub shall cease. Following the Effective Time, the Company shall continue as
the surviving corporation of the Merger (the " _Surviving Corporation_ ").

 

1.2 _Effect of the Merger_. The Merger shall have the effects set forth in
this Agreement and in the applicable provisions of the DGCL. 

 



1 1.3 _Closing; Effective Time_. The closing of the transactions contemplated by
this Agreement (the " _Closing_ ") shall take place at the offices of Vinson
and Elkins LLP, 1001 Fannin, Suite 2500, Houston, Texas 77002, at 9:00 a.m.
local time on the third Business Day after the satisfaction or waiver of the
last to be satisfied or waived of the conditions set forth in Article 6
(other than those conditions that by their nature are to be satisfied at the
Closing, but subject to the satisfaction or waiver of those conditions at the
Closing) or at such other time and date as may be mutually agreed by Parent
and the Company (such date, the " _Closing Date_ "). Subject to the provisions
of this Agreement, a certificate of merger satisfying the applicable
requirements of the DGCL (the " _Certificate of Merger_ ") shall be duly
executed by the Company and, as soon as practicable following the Closing,
filed with the Secretary of State of the State of Delaware (the " _Secretary
of State_ "). The Merger shall become effective upon the later of: (a) the
date and time of the filing of the Certificate of Merger with the Secretary of
State, or (b) such later date and time as may be specified in the Certificate
of Merger as agreed to by the Parties. The time that the Merger becomes
effective is referred to in this Agreement as the " _Effective Time_ _._ "

1.4  _Certificate of Incorporation and Bylaws of the Surviving Corporation;
Directors and Officers of the Surviving Corporation_. At the Effective Time:

 

(a) the certificate of incorporation of the Company shall be amended and
restated to read in its entirety as set forth in _Exhibit A_ and, as so
amended and restated, shall be the certificate of incorporation of the
Surviving Corporation;

(b) the bylaws of the Company shall be amended and restated to conform to the
bylaws of Merger Sub as in effect immediately prior to the Effective Time,
except that the name of the Surviving Corporation shall be "Seventy Seven
Energy Inc.," and, as so amended and restated , shall be the bylaws of the
Surviving Corporation; and

(c) the directors and officers of the Surviving Corporation immediately after
the Effective Time shall be the respective individuals who are directors and
officers of Merger Sub immediately prior to the Effective Time.

 

ARTICLE 2

 

CONVERSION OF SHARES AND EXCHANGE PROCEDURES

 

2.1 _Conversion of Shares_.

 

(a) At the Effective Time, by virtue of the Merger and without any further
action on the part of Parent, Merger Sub, the Company, or any holder of any
of their securities:

(i) any shares of Company Common Stock then owned by the Company or any wholly
owned Subsidiary of the Company (or held in the Companys treasury) shall be
canceled and retired and shall cease to exist, and no consideration shall be
delivered in exchange therefor;

 

(ii) any shares of Company Common Stock then owned by Parent or Merger Sub
shall be canceled and retired and shall cease to exist, and no consideration
shall be delivered in exchange therefor;

 



2 (iii) except as provided in clauses (i) and (ii) of _Section 2.1(a)_
and subject to _Sections 2.1(b)_ and _2.1(c)_ , each share of Company Common
Stock then outstanding (other than any Appraisal Shares) shall be converted
into the right to receive a number of shares of Parent Common Stock equal to
the Exchange Ratio; and

(iv) each share of the common stock, $0.01 par value per share, of Merger Sub
then outstanding shall be converted into one share of common stock of the
Surviving Corporation.

(b) If, between the date of this Agreement and the Effective Time,
the outstanding shares of Company Common Stock or Parent Common Stock are
changed into a different number or class of shares by reason of any stock
split, stock dividend, reverse stock split, reclassification,
recapitalization, or other similar transaction or event, or there occurs a
record date with respect to any of the foregoing, then the Exchange Ratio
shall be appropriately adjusted.

 

(c) No fractional shares of Parent Common Stock shall be issued in connection
with the Merger, and no certificates or scrip for any such fractional shares
shall be issued. Any holder of Company Common Stock who would otherwise be
entitled to receive a fraction of a share of Parent Common Stock (after
aggregating all fractional shares of Parent Common Stock issuable to such
holder), in lieu of such fraction of a share and, upon surrender of such
holders Company Stock Certificate or Book Entry Shares, shall receive a cash
payment, without interest, representing such holders proportionate interest,
if any, in the proceeds from the sale by the Exchange Agent (reduced by
reasonable and customary fees of the Exchange Agent attributable to such sale)
(as so reduced, the " _Share Proceeds_ ") in one or more transactions of a
number of shares of Parent Common Stock, such number equal to the excess of
(i) the aggregate number of shares of Parent Common Stock to be delivered to
the Exchange Agent by Parent pursuant to _Section 2.5(a)_ over (ii) the
aggregate number of whole shares of Parent Common Stock to be distributed to
the former holders of Company Common Stock pursuant to _Section 2.5(b)_ (such
excess being, the " _Excess Shares_ "). As soon as practicable after the
Effective Time, the Exchange Agent, as agent for the holders of shares of
Parent Common Stock that would otherwise receive fractional shares, shall sell
the Excess Shares at then-prevailing prices on the Nasdaq in the manner
provided in this  _Section 2.1(c)_ and such transactions shall be executed
in round lots to the extent practicable. Until the Share Proceeds of such sale
or sales have been distributed to the former holders of Company Common Stock,
or the Exchange Fund is terminated, the Exchange Agent shall hold such Share
Proceeds in trust for the benefit of the holders of such shares of Parent
Common Stock (the " _Fractional Share Proceeds_ "). The Exchange Agent shall
determine the portion of the Fractional Share Proceeds to which each such
former holder of Company Common Stock shall be entitled, if any, by
multiplying the amount of the aggregate Share Proceeds comprising the
Fractional Share Proceeds by a fraction, the numerator of which is the amount
of the fractional share interest to which such holder of such shares of Parent
Common Stock would otherwise be entitled and the denominator of which is the
aggregate amount of fractional share interests to which all holders of such
shares of Parent Common Stock would otherwise be entitled. As promptly as
practicable after the determination of the amount of cash, if any, to be paid
to holders of fractional interests, the Surviving Corporation will instruct
the Exchange Agent to forward payments to such holders of fractional
interests subject to and in accordance with the terms hereof.

 



3 2.2 _Appraisal Rights_. Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the
contrary, shares of Company Common Stock issued and outstanding immediately
prior to the Effective Time that are held by any record holder who is entitled
to demand and properly demands appraisal of such shares pursuant to, and who
complies in all respects with, the provisions of Section 262 of the DGCL (the
" _Appraisal Shares_ ") shall not be converted into the right to receive the
Merger Consideration payable pursuant to _Section_ __ _ 2.1_, but instead at
the Effective Time shall become the right to payment of the fair value of
such shares in accordance with the provisions of Section 262 of the DGCL, and
at the Effective Time all Appraisal Shares shall no longer be outstanding and
shall automatically be canceled and cease to exist. Notwithstanding the
foregoing, if any such holder shall fail to perfect or otherwise shall waive,
withdraw or lose the right to appraisal under Section 262 of the DGCL or a
court of competent jurisdiction shall determine that such holder is not
entitled to the relief provided by Section 262 of the DGCL, then (i) such
shares of Company Common Stock shall thereupon cease to constitute Appraisal
Shares and (ii) the right of such holder to be paid the fair value of such
holders Appraisal Shares under Section 262 of the DGCL shall be forfeited and
cease and if such forfeiture shall occur following the Effective Time, each
such Appraisal Share shall thereafter be deemed to have been converted into
and to have become, as of the Effective Time, the right to receive, without
interest thereon, the Merger Consideration. The Company shall deliver prompt
notice to Parent of any demands for appraisal of any shares of Company Common
Stock and the Company shall provide Parent with the opportunity to participate
in all negotiations and proceedings with respect to demands for appraisal
under the DGCL. Prior to the Effective Time, the Company shall not, without
the prior written consent of Parent, make any payment with respect to, or
settle or offer to settle, any such demands, or agree to do any of the
foregoing.

 

2.3 _Treatment of Company Warrants; Treatment of Company Equity Awards_.

 

(a) Company Warrants shall be treated in accordance with the terms of the
Warrant Agreement. At least 15 days prior to the Effective Time, the Company
shall deliver notice of the Merger to the holders of Company Warrants in
accordance with the terms of the Warrant Agreement. At the Effective Time,
each Company Warrant that is not exercised immediately prior to the Effective
Time shall expire unexercised pursuant to the terms of such Company Warrant
without any action on the part of the holder thereof and all rights of the
holder of such Company Warrants shall cease.

 

(b) In accordance with the Companys 2016 Omnibus Incentive Plan (the "
_Company 2016 Plan_ ") and the applicable award agreements governing equity-
based awards granted thereunder which are outstanding as of the Closing (the "
_Company Equity Awards_ "), the following treatment shall apply with respect
to the Company Equity Awards:

 

(i) Immediately prior to the Effective Time, all Single Trigger RSU Awards
that are outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time
shall immediately vest, and any forfeiture restrictions applicable to all
such awards shall immediately lapse. The Single Trigger RSU Awards shall,
immediately prior to the Effective Time, by virtue of the Merger and without
any action on the part of the holder thereof, be deemed settled and shares of
Company Common Stock subject to the Single Trigger RSU Awards shall be treated
as shares of Company Common Stock (less the number of shares of Company Common
Stock required to satisfy the applicable tax withholding requirements under
such award) for all purposes of this Agreement, including the right to receive
shares of Parent Common Stock pursuant to _Section 2.1(a)(iii)_, calculated
by applying the Exchange Ratio in accordance with  _Section 2.1(a)(iii)_.

 



4 (ii) At the Effective Time, all Retention RSU Awards shall, automatically and
without any required action on the part of any holder or beneficiary thereof,
be assumed by Parent and converted into an award of Parent restricted stock
units (an " _Adjusted RSU Award_ ") with respect to a number of whole shares
of Parent Common Stock (rounded to the nearest whole share) equal to the
product obtained by multiplying (A) the number of shares of Company Common
Stock subject to such Retention RSU Award as of immediately prior to the
Effective Time by (B) the Exchange Ratio. Except as otherwise provided in
this _Section 2.3(b)(ii)_, following the Effective Time, each Retention RSU
Award assumed and converted into an Adjusted RSU Award pursuant to this
_Section 2.3(b)(ii)_ shall continue to have, and shall be subject to, the
same terms and conditions as applied immediately prior to the Effective Time.

(iii) Prior to the Effective Time, the Company shall adopt applicable
resolutions and take all other appropriate actions to effectuate the
provisions of this _Section 2.3(b)_. At the Effective Time, Parent shall
assume the Company 2016 Plan and any other equity incentive plan maintained
by the Company (the " _Company Equity Plans_ "); _provided_ that all
references to "Company" in the applicable Company Equity Plan and the
documents governing the Adjusted RSU Awards following the Effective Time will
be deemed to be references to Parent, and the number of shares of Parent
Common Stock available for awards under the Company Equity Plans shall be
determined by adjusting the number of shares of Company Stock available
for awards under the Company Equity Plans immediately prior to the Effective
Time in accordance with the Exchange Ratio. Parent shall file with the SEC, no
later than the first Business Day following Closing Date, a post-effective
amendment to the Form S-4 Registration Statement or a registration statement
on Form S-8 (or any successor form), to the extent such form is available,
registering a number of shares of Parent Common Stock necessary to fulfill
Parents obligations under this _Section 2.3(b)_. If requested by Parent, the
Company and its counsel shall reasonably cooperate with and assist Parent in
the preparation of such registration statement. 

2.4 _Closing of the Company s Transfer Books_. At the Effective Time: (a) all
holders of shares of Company Common Stock that were outstanding immediately
prior to the Effective Time shall cease to have any rights as stockholders of
the Company other than the right to receive shares of Parent Common Stock (and
cash in lieu of any fractional share of Parent Common Stock) as contemplated
by _Section_ __ _ 2.1_ and any dividends or other distributions payable
pursuant to _Section_ __ _ 2.5(c)_; and (b) the stock transfer books of the
Company shall be closed with respect to all shares of Company Common Stock
outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time. No further transfer of
any such shares of Company Common Stock shall be made on such stock transfer
books after the Effective Time. If, after the Effective Time, any shares of
Company Common Stock are presented to the Exchange Agent or to the Surviving
Corporation or Parent, such shares of Company Common Stock shall be cancelled
and shall be exchanged as provided in  _Section_ __ _ 2.5_.

 



5 2.5 _Exchange of Certificates_.

 

(a) On or prior to the Effective Time, Parent shall select a bank or trust
company reasonably acceptable to the Company to act as exchange agent in the
Merger (the " _Exchange Agent_ "). Parent shall make available to the Exchange
Agent (by instruction to Parents transfer agent) promptly after the Effective
Time, certificates representing the shares of Parent Common Stock issuable
pursuant to _Section 2.1_ (or make appropriate alternative arrangements if
uncertificated shares of Parent Common Stock represented by a book entry will
be issued). The shares of Parent Common Stock and cash Share
Proceeds obtained by the Exchange Agent for use as payment for any fractional
shares in accordance with _Section 2.1(c)_ deposited with the Exchange Agent
are referred to collectively as the " _Exchange Fund_."

 

(b) Promptly after the Effective Time and in any event no later than three
Business Days after the Closing Date, the Surviving Corporation shall cause
the Exchange Agent to mail to the record holders of Company Common Stock (i) a
letter of transmittal in customary form and containing such provisions as
Parent and the Company reasonably agree prior to the Effective Time
(including a provision confirming that delivery shall be effected, and risk
of loss and title shall pass, only upon proper delivery of the Company Stock
Certificates to the Exchange Agent or, in the case of Book Entry Shares, upon
adherence to the procedures set forth in the letter of transmittal), and (ii)
instructions for use in effecting the surrender of such holders Company Stock
Certificates and Book Entry Shares in exchange for certificates representing
Parent Common Stock (or appropriate alternative arrangements if
uncertificated shares of Parent Common Stock represented by a book entry will
be issued). Exchange of any Book Entry Shares shall be effected in accordance
with the Exchange Agents customary procedures with respect to securities
represented by book entry. Upon surrender of a Company Stock Certificate or
Book Entry Share to the Exchange Agent for exchange, together with a duly
executed letter of transmittal and such other documents as may be reasonably
required by the Exchange Agent or Parent, the holder of such Company Stock
Certificate or Book Entry Share shall be entitled to receive in exchange
therefor a certificate representing the number of whole shares of Parent
Common Stock (or uncertificated shares of Parent Common Stock represented by
a book entry) that such holder has the right to receive pursuant to the
provisions of _Section 2.1_ (and cash in lieu of any fractional share of
Parent Common Stock). The Company Stock Certificate or Book Entry Share so
surrendered shall be canceled. Until surrendered as contemplated by this
_Section 2.5_, each Company Stock Certificate or Book Entry Share shall be
deemed, from and after the Effective Time, to represent only the right to
receive shares of Parent Common Stock (and cash in lieu of any fractional
share of Parent Common Stock) as contemplated by _Section 2.1_. If any
Company Stock Certificate shall have been lost, stolen, or destroyed, Parent
or the Exchange Agent may, in its discretion and as a condition precedent to
the issuance of any certificate representing Parent Common Stock, require the
owner of such lost, stolen, or destroyed Company Stock Certificate to provide
an appropriate affidavit and to deliver a bond (in such sum as Parent or the
Exchange Agent may reasonably direct) as indemnity against any claim that may
be made against the Exchange Agent, Parent, or the Surviving Corporation with
respect to such Company Stock Certificate.

 



6 (c) No dividends or other distributions declared or made with respect to
Parent Common Stock with a record date after the Effective Time shall be paid
to the holder of any unsurrendered Company Stock Certificate or Book Entry
Share with respect to the shares of Parent Common Stock that such holder has
the right to receive in the Merger until such holder surrenders such Company
Stock Certificate or Book Entry Shares in accordance with this _Section 2.5_
(at which time such holder shall be entitled, subject to the effect of
applicable escheat law or similar Legal Requirement, to receive all such
dividends and distributions, without interest).

(d) Any portion of the Exchange Fund that remains undistributed to holders of
Company Stock Certificates or Book Entry Shares as of the date 180 days after
the Effective Time shall be delivered to Parent upon demand, and any holders
of Company Stock Certificates or Book Entry Shares who have not
theretofore surrendered their Company Stock Certificates or Book Entry Shares
in accordance with this _Section 2.5_ shall thereafter look only to Parent
for satisfaction of their claims for Parent Common Stock, cash in lieu of
fractional shares of Parent Common Stock, and any dividends or distributions
with respect to Parent Common Stock, in each case without interest thereon.

(e) Each of the Exchange Agent, Parent, and the Surviving Corporation shall
be entitled to deduct and withhold from any consideration payable or otherwise

REPRESENTATIONS AND WARRANTIES OF PARENT AND MERGER SUB

 

Except as set forth in (i) any Parent SEC Report filed by Parent with the SEC
since December 31, 2015 and publicly available prior to the date of this
Agreement (excluding any disclosures set forth in any such Parent SEC Report
in any risk factor section, any forward-looking disclosure in any section
relating to forward-looking statements or any other statements that are non-
specific, cautionary, predictive or forward-looking in nature, other than
historical facts included therein), to the extent that the relevance of the
information as an exception to (or disclosure for purposes of) a particular
representation is reasonably apparent on the face of such disclosure, or (ii)
the Parent Disclosure Schedule, Parent represents and warrants to the Company
as follows:

 

4.1 _Organization and Good Standing_.

 

(a) Parent and each of its Subsidiaries are corporations or other entities
duly organized, validly existing, and in good standing under the laws of
their respective jurisdictions of incorporation or organization, with full
corporate or other entity power and authority to conduct their respective
businesses as now being conducted, to own or use the properties and assets
that they purport to own or use, except where the failure to have such power
or authority (i) has not had and would not reasonably be expected to have,
individually or in the aggregate, a Parent Material Adverse Effect or (ii)
does not prevent and would not reasonably be expected to prevent the ability
of Parent and its Subsidiaries to consummate the Contemplated Transactions by
the End Date. Parent and each of its Subsidiaries are duly qualified to do
business and are in good standing (with respect to jurisdictions that
recognize such concept) under the laws of each state or other jurisdiction in
which either the ownership or use of the properties owned or used by them, or
the nature of the activities conducted by them, requires such qualification,
except where the failure to be so qualified, would not reasonably be expected
to have, individually or in the aggregate, a Parent Material Adverse Effect or
would not reasonably be expected to prevent the ability of Parent and
its Subsidiaries to consummate the Contemplated Transactions by the End Date.

 



30 (b) Merger Sub is a direct, wholly owned subsidiary of Parent that was formed
solely for the purpose of engaging in the Contemplated Transactions. Since

hereunder, and matters ancillary thereto.

(c) Parent has made available to the Company prior to the date of this
Agreement copies of the Organizational Documents of Parent and Merger Sub, as
currently in effect.

4.2 _Authority; No Conflict_.

authority to execute and deliver this Agreement and to perform its
obligations hereunder. The execution and delivery of this Agreement by Parent
and Merger Sub and the consummation of the Contemplated Transactions by Parent
and Merger Sub have been duly and validly authorized by all
necessary corporate action, and no other corporate proceedings on the part of
Parent or Merger Sub are necessary to authorize this Agreement or to
consummate the Contemplated Transactions (other than, with respect to the
issuance of the Parent Common Stock issued pursuant to the terms of this
Agreement, the approval of such issuance by the holders of a majority of the
shares of Parent Common Stock voting on such issuance in person or represented
by proxy at a stockholders meeting of Parent (the  _"Required Parent
Stockholder Vote_ ")). The Required Parent Stockholder Vote is the only vote
or approval of the holders of any class or series of Parent capital stock
necessary to adopt or approve this Agreement and the
Contemplated Transactions. The Parent Board, at a meeting duly called and
held has (i) unanimously approved this Agreement and the Contemplated
Transactions, (ii) declared this Agreement and the Contemplated Transactions
to be advisable and fair to and in the best interests of Parents

Contemplated Transactions to consider the issuance of Parent Common Stock to
be issued pursuant to the terms of this Agreement and (iii) resolved to
recommend to the stockholders of Parent that they vote in favor of
the issuance of the Parent Common Stock to be issued pursuant to the terms of
this Agreement. This Agreement has been duly and validly executed and
delivered by Parent and Merger Sub and, assuming the due and valid execution
of this Agreement by the Company, constitutes the legal, valid, and binding
obligation of Parent and Merger Sub, enforceable against Parent and Merger Sub
in accordance with its terms, except as such enforcement may be limited by the
Bankruptcy and Equity Exception.

 

(b) Neither the execution and delivery of this Agreement nor the consummation
by Parent or Merger Sub of any of the Contemplated Transactions do or will

with, or result in a violation of any provision of the Organizational
Documents of Parent or Merger Sub or any of their respective
Subsidiaries; (ii) assuming compliance with the matters referred to in
_Section 4.2(c)_, contravene,

 



31  conflict with, or result in a violation of any Legal Requirement or any
Order to which Parent or any of its Subsidiaries, or any of the assets owned
or used by Parent or any of its Subsidiaries, is subject; (iii) assuming
compliance with the matters referred to in _Section 4.2(c)_, contravene,
conflict with, or result in a violation of any of the terms or requirements
of, or give any Governmental Body the right to revoke, withdraw, suspend,
cancel, terminate, or modify, any Governmental Authorization that is held by
Parent or any of its Subsidiaries; (iv) contravene, conflict with, or result
in a violation or breach of any provision of, result in the loss of

assets are bound, exercise any change in control or similar put rights with
respect to, or to require a greater rate of interest on, any debt obligations
of Parent or any of its Subsidiaries; or (v) exercise any change in control or
similar put rights with respect to, or result in the imposition or creation of
any Encumbrance (other than a Permitted Lien) upon or with respect to any of
the assets owned or used by Parent or any of its Subsidiaries, except, in the
case of clauses (ii), (iii), (iv) and (v), for any such contraventions,
conflicts, violations, breaches, defaults, or other occurrences that would
not reasonably be expected to have, individually or in the aggregate, a Parent
Material Adverse Effect or would not reasonably be expected to prevent the
ability of Parent and its Subsidiaries to consummate the
Contemplated Transactions by the End Date.

(c) The execution and delivery of this Agreement by Parent and Merger Sub do
not, and the performance of this Agreement and the consummation of the
Contemplated Transactions by Parent and Merger Sub will not, require Parent to
obtain the Consent of, or make any filing with, any Governmental Body, except
(i) for (A) applicable requirements, if any, of the Exchange Act, the
Securities Act, and Blue Sky Laws, (B) applicable requirements of the HSR Act,
and (C) filings pursuant to the DGCL and (ii) where failure to obtain such
Consents, or to make such filings or notifications would not reasonably be
expected to have, individually or in the aggregate, a Parent Material Adverse
Effect or would not reasonably be expected to prevent the ability of Parent
and its Subsidiaries to consummate the Contemplated Transactions by the End
Date.

respective Representatives shall not have violated any of the restrictions set
forth in this _Section 5.5(a)_, (2) the Company Board concludes in good

with, such Person, the Company gives Parent written notice of the identity of
such Person and of the Companys intention to furnish nonpublic information

Parent). Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, the Company

any Company Designated Representative takes any action that, if taken by the
Company, would violate the restrictions set forth in the preceding sentence,

by the Company. In furtherance of its obligations hereunder, to the extent
that the Company has Knowledge that any of its Representatives has taken an
action that, if taken by the Company, would violate the restrictions set
forth in this _Section 5.5_, then the Company shall immediately instruct such
Representative to cease such action.

Subsidiaries with respect to a Company Acquisition Proposal, or any request
for discussions or negotiations are sought to be initiated or continued with,
the Company in respect of any Company Acquisition Proposal (including the
identity of the Person making or submitting such Company Acquisition
Proposal, inquiry, indication of interest or request and the material terms
thereof) that is made or submitted by any Person during the Pre-Closing
Period. The Company shall promptly (and in no event later than 24 hours after
receipt thereof) provide Parent with copies of any draft agreements relating
to, or written proposals containing any material term of, such

 



48  Company Acquisition Proposal, inquiry or indication of interest received
from or on behalf of such Person. The Company shall keep Parent fully informed
with respect to the status and material terms of any such Company Acquisition
Proposal, inquiry, indication of interest, or request and any modification or

from, or to waive or permit the waiver of any provision of, any

consideration of a possible Company Acquisition Transaction or
equity investment, to return all confidential information heretofore
furnished to such Person by or on behalf of the Company or any of its

contemplated by Rule 14e-2(a) under the Exchange Act or complying with the
provisions of Rule 14d-9 promulgated under the Exchange Act;  _provided_ that
this _Section 5.5(d)_ shall not be deemed to permit the Company Board to make
a Company Change in Recommendation or take any of the actions referred to in
Section 5.8(b), except to the extent permitted by  _Section 5.8(c)(i)_ or
_Section 5.8(c)(ii)_.

fide_ Parent Acquisition Proposal that is, or is reasonably likely to result

if (1) Parent, its Subsidiaries or their respective Representatives shall not

written and oral information furnished to such Person by or on behalf of
Parent on terms no less favorable to Parent in the aggregate than the terms of
the Confidentiality Agreement, and (4) prior to furnishing any such nonpublic
information to such Person, Parent furnishes such nonpublic information to the

furnished by Parent to the Company). Without limiting the generality of the
foregoing, Parent acknowledges and agrees that if any of its directors,
executive officers or any Parent Designated Representative takes an action
that, if taken by Parent, would violate the restrictions set forth in the
preceding sentence, then such action shall be deemed to constitute a breach
of such restriction by Parent. In furtherance of its obligations hereunder, to
the extent that Parent has Knowledge that any of its Representative has taken
an action that, if taken by Parent, would violate any of the restrictions set
forth in this Section 5.6, then Parent shall immediately instruct such
Representative to cease such action.

to the issuance of Parent Common Stock in the Merger and cause it to be filed
with the SEC. The Company and Parent shall each furnish all information
concerning it and the holders of its capital stock as the other may reasonably
request in connection with the preparation of the Form S-4 Registration
Statement and the Joint Proxy Statement and any amendment thereto. Parent and
the Company shall each use commercially reasonable efforts to cause the Form
S-4 Registration Statement and the Joint Proxy Statement to comply with the
rules and regulations promulgated by the SEC, to respond promptly to any
comments of the SEC or its staff, and to have the Form S-4 Registration

amendment of the Joint Proxy Statement or Form S-4 Registration Statement or
comments thereon or responses thereto, or the suspension of the qualification
of the shares of Parent Common Stock to be issued pursuant to Article 2

14a-21(c) under the Exchange Act), without the prior written Consent of
Parent. The Company (in consultation with Parent) shall set a single record
date for persons entitled to notice of, and to vote at, the Company
Stockholders Meeting and shall not change such record date (whether
in connection with the Company Stockholders Meeting or any adjournment or
postponement thereof) without the prior written Consent of Parent. The Company
Stockholders Meeting shall be

 



51  held (on a date jointly selected by Parent and the Company) as promptly as

Registration Statement is declared effective under the Securities Act. Subject

thereof shall: (i) withdraw or modify the Company Board Recommendation in a
manner adverse to Parent, or adopt or propose a resolution to withdraw or
modify the Company Board Recommendation in a manner adverse to Parent; (ii)
fail to reaffirm, without qualification, the Company Board Recommendation,
within 10 Business Days after Parent requests in writing that such action be
taken; (iii) fail to announce publicly, within 10 Business Days after a tender
offer or exchange offer relating to securities of the Company shall have been
commenced, that the Company Board recommends rejection of such tender or
exchange offer (it being understood that the Company Board or any committee
thereof may make or cause the Company to make a customary "stop, look and
listen" communication or may elect to take no position with respect to a
Company Acquisition Proposal until the close of business on the tenth Business
Day after the commencement of such Company Acquisition Proposal pursuant to
Rule 14e-2 under the Exchange Act without such action in and of itself being
considered a Company Change in Recommendation); (iv) approve, endorse, or
recommend any Acquisition Proposal; or (v) publicly resolve or propose to
take any action described in clauses (i) through (iv) of this sentence (each
of the foregoing actions described in clauses (i) through (v) of this sentence
being referred to as a " _Company Change in Recommendation_ ").

(c) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in _Section 5.8(b)_,
at any time prior to the adoption of this Agreement by the Required Company
Stockholder Vote, the Company Board may effect, or cause the Company to
effect, as the case may be, a Company Change in Recommendation:

 

(i) if: (A) after the date of this Agreement, a Company Acquisition Proposal
is made to the Company and is not withdrawn; (B) such Company Acquisition
Proposal was not obtained or made as a direct or indirect result of a breach
of this Agreement or the Confidentiality Agreement; (C) the Company Board
determines in good faith, after consultation with an independent financial
advisor of nationally recognized reputation and outside legal counsel, that
such Company Acquisition Proposal constitutes a Superior Company Proposal; (D)
the Company Board does not effect, or cause the Company to effect, a
Company Change in Recommendation at any time within five Business Days after
Parent receives written notice from the Company confirming that the Company
Board has determined that such Company Acquisition Proposal is a Superior
Company Proposal; (E) during such five-Business Day period, if requested by
Parent, the Company engages in good faith negotiations with Parent to amend
this Agreement in such a manner that the Company Acquisition Proposal that was
determined to constitute a Superior Company Proposal no longer constitutes a
Superior Company Proposal; (F) at the end of such five-Business Day period,
such Company Acquisition Proposal has not been withdrawn

 



52  and continues to constitute a Superior Company Proposal (taking into account
any changes to the terms of this Agreement irrevocably agreed by Parent as a
result of the negotiations required by clause (E) or otherwise); and (G) the
Company Board determines in good faith, after consultation with outside legal
counsel, that, in light of such Superior Company Proposal, the failure to make
a Company Change in Recommendation would be inconsistent with its fiduciary
obligations to the Companys stockholders under applicable Legal Requirements
(it being understood that in the event of any revisions to the terms of a
Superior Company Proposal, the provisions of this  _Section 5.8(c)(i)_ shall
apply to such revised Company Acquisition Proposal as if it were a new Company
Acquisition Proposal hereunder, except that to the extent such revisions are
proposed during such five Business Day period, the five Business Day period
shall instead be the greater of the remaining time of such initial five
Business Day Period related to such Company Acquisition Proposal and three
Business Days); or

 

(ii) if: (A) a Company Intervening Event occurs or arises after the date of
this Agreement; (B) the Company Board does not effect, or cause the Company
to effect, a Company Change in Recommendation at any time within five Business
Days after Parent receives written notice from the Company confirming that the
Company Board has determined that, in light of such Company Intervening
Event, the Company Board intends to effect a Company Change in Recommendation;
(C) during such five Business Day period, if requested by Parent, the Company
engages in good-faith negotiations with Parent to amend this Agreement in
a manner that obviates the need for the Company Board to effect, or cause the
Company to effect, a Company Change in Recommendation as a result of such
Company Intervening Event; and (D) at the end of such five Business Day
period, the Company Board determines in good faith, after consultation with
outside legal counsel, that, in light of such Company Intervening Event, the
failure to make a Company Change in Recommendation would be inconsistent with
its fiduciary obligations to the Companys stockholders under applicable
Legal Requirements.

5.9 _Parent Stockholders Meeting_.

 

(a) Parent shall take all action necessary under all applicable Legal

holders at the Parent Stockholders Meeting. Parent (in consultation with the
Company) shall set a single record date for persons entitled to notice of, and

solicited in compliance with all applicable Legal Requirements.

 



53 (b) Subject to _Section 5.9(c)_, neither the Parent Board nor any committee
thereof shall: (i) withdraw or modify the Parent Board Recommendation in a

modify the Parent Board Recommendation in a manner adverse to the Company;
(ii) fail to reaffirm, without qualification, the Parent Board Recommendation
within 10 Business Days after the Company requests in writing that such action
be taken; (iii) fail to announce publicly, within 10 Business Days after a
tender offer or exchange offer relating to securities of Parent shall have
been commenced, that the Parent Board recommends rejection of such tender or
exchange offer (it being understood that the Parent Board or any committee
thereof may make or cause Parent to make a customary "stop, look and listen"
communication or may elect to take no position with respect to a Parent
Acquisition Proposal until the close of business on the tenth Business Day
after the commencement of such Parent Acquisition Proposal pursuant to Rule
14e-2 under the Exchange Act without such action in and of itself being
considered a Parent Change in Recommendation); (iv) approve, endorse or

5.9(b)_, at any time prior to the approval of the issuance of Parent Common
Stock issued pursuant to the terms of this Agreement by the Required Parent
Stockholder Vote, the Parent Board may effect, or cause Parent to effect, as
the case may be, a Parent Change in Recommendation:

made to Parent and is not withdrawn; (B) such Parent Acquisition Proposal was
not obtained or made as a direct or indirect result of a breach of this
Agreement or the Confidentiality Agreement; (C) the Parent Board determines in
good faith, after consultation with an independent financial advisor of
nationally recognized reputation and outside legal counsel, that such Parent
Acquisition Proposal constitutes a Superior Parent Proposal; (D) the Parent
Board does not effect, or cause Parent to effect, a Parent Change in
Recommendation at any time within five Business Days after the Company
receives written notice from Parent confirming that the Parent Board has
determined that such Parent Acquisition Proposal is a Superior Parent
Proposal; (E) during such five Business Day period, if requested by the
Company, Parent engages in good faith negotiations with the Company to amend
this Agreement in such a manner that the Parent Acquisition Proposal that was
determined to constitute a Superior Parent Proposal no longer constitutes a
Superior Parent Proposal; (F) at the end of such five Business Day period,
such Parent Acquisition Proposal has not been withdrawn and continues to
constitute a Superior Parent Proposal (taking into account any changes to the
terms of this Agreement irrevocably agreed by the Company as a result of the
negotiations required by clause (E) or otherwise); and (G) the Parent Board
determines in good faith, after consultation with outside legal counsel,
that, in light of such Superior Parent Proposal, the failure to make a Parent
Change in Recommendation would be inconsistent with its fiduciary obligations
to Parents stockholders under applicable Legal Requirements (it being
understood that in the event of any revisions to the terms of a Superior
Parent Proposal, the provisions of this _Section 5.9(c)(i)_ shall apply to
such revised Parent Acquisition Proposal as if it were a new Parent
Acquisition Proposal hereunder, except that to the extent such revisions are
proposed during such five Business Day period, the five Business Day period
shall instead be the greater of the remaining time of such initial five
Business Day Period related to such Parent Acquisition Proposal and three
Business Days);

 



54 (ii) if (A) a Parent Intervening Event occurs or arises after the date of this
Agreement; (B) the Parent Board does not effect, or cause Parent to effect, a
Parent Change in Recommendation at any time within five Business Days after

the Company, Parent engages in good-faith negotiations with the Company to
amend this Agreement in a manner that obviates the need for the Parent Board
to effect, or cause Parent to effect, a Parent Change in Recommendation as a
result of such Parent Intervening Event; and (D) at the end of such five
Business Day period, the Parent Board determines in good faith, after
consultation with outside legal counsel, that, in light of such Parent
Intervening Event, the failure to make a Parent Change in Recommendation would
be inconsistent with its fiduciary obligations to Parents stockholders under
applicable Legal Requirements.

Governmental Body or by any Legal Requirement, the Company and Parent will
consult and cooperate with one another, and will consider in good

 



55  faith the views of one another, in connection with any analysis, appearance,
presentation, memorandum, brief, argument, opinion, or proposal made or
submitted in connection with any Legal Proceeding under or relating to the
HSR Act or any other Antitrust Law. Subject to the foregoing, Parent shall be
principally responsible for and in control of the process of dealing with any
Governmental Body concerning the effect of applicable Antitrust Laws on the
Contemplated Transactions. In addition, except as may be prohibited by any
Governmental Body or by any Legal Requirement, in connection with any Legal
Proceeding under or relating to the HSR Act Parent and the Company
will permit authorized Representatives of the other Party to be present at
each meeting or conference relating to any such Legal Proceeding and to have
access to and be consulted in connection with any document, opinion, or
proposal made or submitted to any Governmental Body in connection with any
such Legal Proceeding.

(c) At the request of Parent, the Company shall agree to divest,
sell, dispose of, hold separate, or otherwise take or commit to take any
action that limits its freedom of action with respect to its or its
Subsidiaries ability to retain any of the businesses, product lines, or
assets of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries; _provided_ that any such
action is conditioned upon the consummation of the Merger.

(d) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this Agreement,
unless immaterial relative to the Company and its Subsidiaries taken as a
whole, Parent shall not have any obligation under this Agreement to (and the
Company shall not, unless requested to do so by Parent): (i) dispose of,
transfer, or hold separate, or cause any of its Subsidiaries to dispose of,
transfer, or hold separate any assets or operations, or commit or cause the
Company or any of its Subsidiaries to dispose of, transfer, or hold separate
any assets; (ii) discontinue or cause any of its Subsidiaries to discontinue
offering any product or service, or commit to cause the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries to discontinue offering any product or service or (iii) make or
cause any of its Subsidiaries to make any commitment (to any Governmental
Body or otherwise) regarding its future operations or the future operations of
the Company or any of its Subsidiaries.

 

5.11 _Disclosure_. Except with respect to any Company Change in Recommendation
or Parent Change in Recommendation made in accordance with the terms of this
Agreement, Parent and the Company shall consult with each other before issuing
any press release or otherwise making any public statement or disclosure with
respect to the Merger or any of the other Contemplated Transactions
and neither shall issue any press release or make any public statement or
disclosure regarding the Merger or any of the other Contemplated Transactions
without the prior approval of the other (which approval shall not be
unreasonably withheld, conditioned, or delayed), except as may be required by
applicable Legal Requirements or by obligations pursuant to any listing
agreement with any national securities exchange, in which case the Party
proposing to issue such press release or make such public statement or
disclosure shall first, to the extent practicable, consult with the other
Party about, and allow the other Party reasonable time to comment in advance
on, such press release, public announcement, or disclosure.

 

5.12 _Tax Matters_. Each of Parent and the Company will use its reasonable
best efforts to cause the Merger to qualify, and will not take (and will use
its reasonable best efforts to prevent any Affiliate of such party from
taking) any actions that would reasonably be expected to prevent the Merger
from qualifying, as a reorganization under the provisions of Section 368(a) of
the Code. Parent and the Company will cooperate with one another and use
their respective

 



56  commercially reasonable efforts to obtain the opinions of counsel referred
to in _Sections_ __ _ 6.2(d)_ and _6.3(d)_. In connection therewith, (a)
Parent shall deliver to such counsel a duly executed certificate containing
such representations, warranties and covenants as shall be reasonably
necessary or appropriate to enable such counsel to render the opinions
described in  _Sections_ __ _ 6.2(d)_ and _6.3(d)_ , as applicable (the "
_Parent Tax Certificate_ ") and (b) the Company shall deliver to such counsel
a duly executed certificate containing such representations, warranties and
covenants as shall be reasonably necessary or appropriate to enable such
counsel to render the opinions described in _Sections_ __ _ 6.2(d)_ and
_6.3(d)_ , as applicable (the " _Company Tax Certificate_ "), in each case
dated as of the Closing Date (and, if requested, dated as of the date on which
the Registration Statement is declared effective by the SEC), and Parent and
the Company shall provide such other information as reasonably requested by
counsel for purposes of rendering the opinions described in _Sections_ __ _
6.2(d)_ and _6.3(d)_.

5.13 _Resignation of Directors_. The Company shall use commercially
reasonable efforts to obtain and deliver to Parent prior to the Closing Date
(to be effective as of the Effective Time) the resignation of each director of
the Company (in each case, in their capacities as directors, and not as
employees) as Parent shall request in writing not less than five days prior to
the Closing Date.

5.14  _Listing_. Parent shall use commercially reasonable efforts to cause
the shares of Parent Common Stock to be issued in the Merger pursuant to this
Agreement to be approved for listing (subject to official notice of issuance)
on the Nasdaq.

 

5.15 _Rule 16b-3_. Parent, Merger Sub, and the Company shall take all such
steps as may be required to cause the transactions contemplated by Article 1
and any other dispositions of equity securities of the Company (including
derivative securities) or acquisitions of equity securities of Parent in
connection with this Agreement by each individual who (a) is a director or
officer of the Company subject to Section 16 of the Exchange Act, or (b) at
the Effective Time is or will become a director or officer of Parent subject
to Section 16 of the Exchange Act, to be exempt under Rule 16b-3 promulgated
under the Exchange Act.

5.16 _Employee Benefits_. 

(a) Following the Effective Time, and for at least six months thereafter, the
Surviving Corporation shall provide or cause to be provided to each
individual employed by the Surviving Corporation immediately after the
Effective Time (each, a " _Continuing Employee_ ") an annual base salary or
wage level, as applicable, annual cash incentive opportunities, and
employee benefits (excluding equity-based compensation) that, in the
aggregate, are substantially comparable to either (i) such compensation and
employee benefits provided to such Continuing Employee by the Company on the
date of this Agreement or (ii) such compensation and employee benefits
provided by the Parent to similarly situated employees of Parent and its
Affiliates; _provided_ , _however_ , that nothing in this _Section 5.16_ or
elsewhere in this Agreement shall limit the right of Parent or the Surviving
Corporation to amend or terminate the employment of any individual or to amend
or terminate any employee benefit plan, program, or arrangement. Nothing in
this Section 5.16 shall be interpreted to require Parent to provide for the
participation of any Continuing Employee in any benefit plan of Parent or its
Affiliates (the " _Parent Benefit Plans_ "). This Section is not intended, and
shall not be deemed, to confer any rights or remedies

 



57  upon any Person other than the parties to this Agreement and their
respective successors and permitted assigns, to create any agreement of
employment with any Person or otherwise to create any third-party beneficiary
hereunder, or to be interpreted as an amendment to any plan of Parent or any
affiliate of Parent. Furthermore, nothing in this Agreement shall be construed
to create a right in any Continuing Employee to employment with Parent, the
Surviving Corporation, or any other Subsidiary of Parent and, subject to any
agreement between a Continuing Employee and Parent, the Surviving Corporation
or any other Subsidiary of Parent, the employment of each Continuing
Employee shall be "at will" employment.

(b) For purposes of vesting, eligibility to participate and level of benefits
under the employee benefit plans of Parent and the Parent Subsidiaries
providing benefits to any Continuing Employees after the Effective Time (the "
_New Plans_ "), each Continuing Employee shall be credited with his or her
years of service with the Company and its Subsidiaries and their respective
predecessors before the Effective Time, to the same extent as such Continuing
Employee was entitled, before the Effective Time, to credit for such service
under any similar Company Benefit Plan in which such Continuing Employee
participated or was eligible to participate immediately prior to the Effective
Time; _provided_ , that the foregoing shall not apply to the extent (i) that
its application would result in a duplication of benefits, (ii) of any
benefit accrual under any New Plan that is a defined benefit plan, or (iii)
the similar Company Benefit Plans method or formula of service crediting is
not consistent with the method or formula of service crediting under the New
Plan in which case, such Continuing Employee shall be credited with his or her
years of service with the Company and its Subsidiaries and their respective
predecessors before the Effective Time in accordance with the method or
formula of service crediting under the New Plan. In addition and without
limiting the generality of the foregoing, Parent shall, or shall cause the New
Plans to, use commercially reasonable efforts to cause (A) each Continuing
Employee to be immediately eligible to participate, without any waiting time,
in any and all New Plans to the extent that coverage under such New Plan is
comparable to a Company Benefit Plan in which such Continuing Employee
participated immediately before the Effective Time (such plans, collectively,
the " _Old Plans_ ") and (B) for purposes of each New Plan providing medical,
dental, pharmaceutical and/or vision benefits to any Continuing Employee,
all pre-existing condition exclusions and actively-at-work requirements of
such New Plan to be waived for such employee and his or her covered
dependents, unless such conditions would not have been waived under the
comparable plans of the Company or its Subsidiaries in which such employee
participated immediately prior to the Effective Time, and any eligible
expenses incurred by such employee and his or her covered dependents during
the portion of the plan year of the Old Plans ending on the date such
employees participation in the corresponding New Plan begins to be taken into
account under such New Plan for purposes of satisfying all deductible,
coinsurance and maximum out-of-pocket requirements applicable to such employee
and his or her covered dependents for the applicable plan year as if such
amounts had been paid in accordance with such New Plan.

5.17 _Indemnification of Officers and Directors_.

(a) From the Effective Time and until the six year anniversary of the
Effective Time, the Surviving Corporation shall, and Parent shall cause the
Surviving Corporation to, (i) indemnify and hold harmless, to the fullest
extent permitted by applicable Legal Requirements, each present and former
director, officer and employee of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries 

 



58  and each Person who served as a director, officer, member, trustee or
fiduciary of another corporation, partnership, joint venture, trust, pension
or other employee benefit plan or enterprise if such service was at the
request of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries (collectively, and together
with such Persons heirs, executors or administrators, the " _Indemnified
Persons_ "), against any costs or expenses, including attorneys fees
(including the advancement of such costs and expenses), judgments, fines,
losses, claims, damages, liabilities or settlements incurred in connection
with any claim, action, suit, proceeding or investigation, whether
civil, criminal, administrative or investigative, arising out of or related
to such Indemnified Persons service as a director, officer or employee of the
Company or its Subsidiaries or services performed by such Persons at the
request of the Company or its Subsidiaries at or prior to the Effective Time,
whether asserted or claimed prior to, at or after the Effective Time,
including actions to enforce this provision or any other indemnification or
advancement right of any Indemnified Person. 

(b) All rights to indemnification, advancement of expenses and exculpation
from liabilities for acts or omissions under the Companys certificate of
formation, bylaws, or indemnification Contracts or undertakings existing in
favor of those Persons who are, or were, directors and officers of the Company
at or prior to the date of this Agreement shall survive the Merger and shall
be assumed by the Surviving Corporation in the Merger without any further
action. Without limiting the foregoing, Parent, from and after the Effective
Time, shall cause, unless otherwise required by applicable Legal
Requirements, the certificate of incorporation and bylaws of the Surviving
Corporation to contain provisions no less favorable to the Indemnified Persons
with respect to limitation of liabilities of directors and officers and
indemnification than are set forth as of the date of this Agreement in the
certificate of incorporation and bylaws of the Company, which provisions shall
not be amended, repealed or otherwise modified in a manner that would
adversely affect the rights thereunder of the Indemnified Persons. In
addition, from the Effective Time, Parent shall, and shall cause the Surviving
Corporation to, without requiring a preliminary determination of entitlement
to indemnification, advance any expenses (including attorneys fees) of
any Indemnified Person under this _Section 5.17_ (including in connection
with enforcing the indemnity and other obligations referred to in this
_Section 5.17_) as incurred to the fullest extent permitted under applicable
Legal Requirements for a period of six years from the Effective Time;
_provided_ that any person to whom expenses are advanced provides an
undertaking to repay such advances if it is ultimately determined by final
adjudication that such Person is not entitled to indemnification.

(c) Parent shall purchase, or shall cause the Surviving Corporation to
purchase, on or prior to the Effective Time, and the Surviving Corporation
shall maintain, tail insurance policies for the extension of the current
directors and officers liability insurance and fiduciary liability insurance
maintained on the date of this Agreement by the Company, which tail policies
shall be from one or more insurance carriers with the same or better credit
rating as the Companys insurance carrier with respect to directors and
officers liability insurance and fiduciary liability insurance and shall be
effective from the Effective Time through and including the date six years
after the Closing Date (the " _Tail Period_ ") with respect to claims arising
from facts or events that existed or occurred prior to or at the Effective
Time, with terms, conditions, retentions and limits of liability that are at
least as favorable to the insureds as the Companys existing director and
officer policies disclosed in _Section 3.16_ of the Company Disclosure
Schedule with respect to claims arising from facts, events, acts or omissions
that occurred on or prior to the

 



59  Effective Time. If Parent or the Surviving Corporation for any reason fails
to obtain such tail insurance policies as of the Effective Time, the Surviving
Corporation shall, and Parent shall cause the Surviving Corporation to, (i)
continue to maintain in effect for the Tail Period the directors and
officers liability insurance and fiduciary liability insurance maintained as
of the date of this Agreement, or (ii) purchase comparable directors and
officers liability insurance and fiduciary liability insurance for the Tail
Period, in each case with terms, conditions, retentions and limits of
liability that are at least as favorable as those provided in the Companys
existing director and officer policies disclosed in _Section 3.16_ of the
Company Disclosure Schedule. Notwithstanding the foregoing, if the coverage
described above cannot be obtained, or can only be obtained by paying
aggregate premiums in excess of 250% of the annual amount currently paid by
the Company for such coverage, the Surviving Corporation shall obtain policies
with the greatest coverage available for aggregate premiums equal to 250% of
the aggregate annual amount currently paid by the Company for directors and
officers liability insurance and fiduciary liability insurance.

 

(d) If Parent or the Surviving Corporation or any of its respective successors
or assigns (i) shall consolidate with or merge into any other corporation or
entity and shall not be the continuing or surviving corporation or entity of
such consolidation or merger or (ii) shall transfer all or substantially all
of its properties and assets to any individual, corporation or other entity
then, and in each such case, proper provisions shall be made so that the
successors and assigns of Parent or the Surviving Corporation, respectively,
shall assume all of the obligations set forth in this _Section 5.17._ Nothing
in this Agreement is intended to, shall be construed to or shall release,
waive or impair any rights to directors and officers insurance claims under
any policy that is or has been in existence with respect to the Company or any
of its Subsidiaries or their respective officers, directors and employees, it
being understood and agreed that the indemnification provided for in this
_Section 5.17_ is not prior to, or in substation for, any claims under any
such policies.

 

(e) This _Section 5.17_ shall survive the consummation of the Merger and
continue in full force and effect and is intended to benefit, and shall be
enforceable by each Indemnified Person as a third-party beneficiary. The
rights of the Indemnified Persons under this Section 5.17 are in addition to
any rights such Indemnified Persons may have under the certificate
of incorporation, bylaws or comparable governing documents of the Company or
any of its Subsidiaries, or under any applicable Contracts or Legal
Requirements.

 

5.18 _Transaction Litigation_. The Company shall give Parent the opportunity
to participate in the defense or settlement of any securityholder litigation
against the Company and/or its directors relating to the Merger and the other
Contemplated Transactions, and no such settlement shall be agreed to without
the prior written consent of Parent. The Company and Parent shall cooperate,
shall cause their respective Subsidiaries to cooperate and shall use their
reasonable best efforts to cause their respective Representatives to
cooperate, in the defense against such litigation.

 



60 5.19 _Financing_.

 

(a) At any time, and from time to time, prior to Closing, the Company shall,
and shall cause its Subsidiaries to and use reasonable best efforts to cause
its Representatives to, cooperate in connection with any Financing as Parent
may reasonably request, including any offering of debt or equity securities,
requested repayment or refinancing of Indebtedness of the Company or any
of its Subsidiaries and any filing with any Governmental Body to be made by
Parent related thereto, including, as applicable, by: (i) causing management
teams of the Company or its Subsidiaries, with appropriate seniority and
expertise, to participate in meetings, due diligence and drafting sessions,
rating agency presentations and road shows, if any, related to the Financing;
(ii) providing information with respect to the Company and its Subsidiaries
reasonably requested by Parent or the Financing Sources to facilitate the
Financing; (iii) using reasonable best efforts to prepare and furnish to
Parent the Required Information; (iv) assisting in the preparation of SEC

memoranda, prospectuses, bank confidential information memoranda, rating
agency presentations and similar documents (" _Offering Documents_ "); (v) (A)
using reasonable best efforts to cause PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP or other
relevant accountants of the Company and its respective Subsidiaries to
cooperate with Parent, including by participating in drafting sessions and
accounting due diligence sessions, to obtain the consent of, and customary
comfort letters from, PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP (including by providing
customary management letters and requesting legal letters to obtain such
consent) in connection with any Financing by Parent and (B) cooperating
with Parents legal counsel in connection with any legal opinions that such
counsel may be required to deliver in connection with the Financing; (vi)
cooperating with any due diligence, to the extent customary and reasonable;
(vii) in connection with any such Financing, provide customary authorization
letters authorizing the distribution of information to prospective lenders and
containing customary representations that such information does not contain a
material misstatement or omission; (viii) furnishing promptly all
documentation and other information required by any Governmental Authority or
as reasonably requested by any financing source under applicable "know your
customer," anti-bribery and anti-money laundering rules and regulations,
including the PATRIOT Act, the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act of 1977, as
amended, 15 U.S.C. §§ 78dd 1 _et seq._ , and economic sanctions administered
by the Office of Foreign Assets Control of the U.S. Treasury Department; (ix)
in connection with the Financing, executing and delivering any definitive
financing documents, including any necessary pledge and security documents, as
reasonably requested by Parent and otherwise facilitating the pledging of
collateral in connection with the Financing, including taking reasonable
actions necessary to permit the Financing Sources to evaluate the Companys
and its Subsidiaries assets, inventory, cash management and
accounting systems, policies and procedures relating thereto for the purpose
of establishing collateral arrangements (including establishing bank and other
accounts and blocked account and control agreements in connection with the
foregoing); (x) causing the taking of any corporate, limited liability
company or partnership actions, as applicable, by the Company or its
Subsidiaries reasonably necessary to permit the completion of the Financing,
subject to the occurrence of the Closing; and (xi) using reasonable best
efforts to obtain customary payoff letters, lien terminations and releases and
instruments of discharge to be delivered at Closing providing for the payoff,
discharge and termination on the Closing Date of all indebtedness and release
of liens contemplated by any repayment or refinancing of such indebtedness to
be paid off, discharged and terminated on the Closing Date; _provided_ that
the documents in respect of such arrangements contemplated by this clause
(xi) shall not need to be effective until the Closing Date.

 



61 (b) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this _Section 5.19(a)_ , no
action shall be required of the Company or its Subsidiaries if any such
action shall: (i) unreasonably disrupt or interfere with the business or
ongoing operations of Company and its Subsidiaries; (ii) cause any
representation or warranty or covenant contained in this Agreement to be
breached unless waived by Parent; (iii) involve the entry by the Company or
any Subsidiary into any agreement with respect to the Financing that is

authorization letters; (v) require the Company or any Subsidiary to pay any
commitment or other fee prior to the Closing Date; (vi) require the Company
or any of its Subsidiaries or their respective Representatives to prepare pro
forma financial information or projections, which shall be the responsibility

(iii); or (vii) cause any director, officer, or employee of Company or any of
its Subsidiaries to execute any agreement or certificate in his or her
individual, rather than official, capacity.

 

(c) Promptly upon the Companys request, all reasonable and documented out-
of-pocket fees and expenses incurred by the Company and its Subsidiaries in
connection with assisting in the Financing shall be paid or reimbursed by
Parent, and, in the event the Closing shall not occur, Parent shall indemnify
and hold harmless Company, its Subsidiaries and its and their Representatives
from and against any and all losses actually suffered or incurred by them in
connection with the arrangement or consummation of the Financing, except to
the extent such losses arise from the information provided by the Company or
its Subsidiaries for use in the Offering Documents or otherwise in connection
with the Financing.

71 (b) The exchange of signed copies of this Agreement or of any other document

(a) The Company Disclosure Schedule and the Parent Disclosure Schedule are
arranged in separate parts corresponding to the numbered and lettered
Sections contained in Articles 3 and 4, respectively. The information
disclosed in any numbered or lettered Section shall be deemed to relate to and
to qualify any other Section to the extent that the relevance of 

 



72  such item is reasonably apparent. Where the terms of a Contract or other
disclosure item have been referenced, summarized or described, such reference,
summary or description does not purport to be a complete statement of the
material terms of such Contract or disclosure item and such disclosures are
qualified in their entirety by the specific details of such Contract or
disclosure item.

 

(b) The inclusion of any information in the Company Disclosure Schedule or the
Parent Disclosure Schedule, as the case may be, shall not be deemed an
admission or acknowledgment, in and of itself and solely by virtue of the
inclusion of such information in the Company Disclosure Schedule or the Parent
Disclosure Schedule, that such information is required to be listed in the
Company Disclosure Schedule or the Parent Disclosure Schedule or that such
items are material to the Company or Parent, as the case may be. No disclosure
in the Company Disclosure Schedule or Parent Disclosure Schedule relating to
any possible or alleged breach or violation of Legal Requirements or Contract
shall be construed as an admission or indication that any such breach or
violation exists or has actually occurred, or as an admission against any
interest of any Party or any of its Subsidiaries or its or their respective
directors or officers. In disclosing information in the Company Disclosure
Schedule or Parent Disclosure Schedule, the disclosing Party expressly does
not waive any attorney-client privilege associated with such information or
any protection afforded by the work-product doctrine with respect to any of
the matters disclosed or discussed therein. The headings, if any, of the
individual sections of each of the Company Disclosure Schedule and the
Parent Disclosure Schedule are inserted for convenience only and shall not be
deemed to constitute a part thereof or a part of this Agreement. The Company
Disclosure Schedule and the Parent Disclosure Schedule are qualified in their
entireties by reference to specific provisions of the Merger Agreement, and
are not intended to constitute, and shall not be construed as constituting,
representations or warranties of the Company or Parent or Merger Sub, as
applicable, except as and to the extent provided in the Merger Agreement.

(c) The specification of any dollar amount in the representations and
warranties or otherwise in this Agreement or in the Company Disclosure
Schedule or the Parent Disclosure Schedule, as applicable, is not intended and
shall not be deemed to be an admission or acknowledgment of the materiality of
such amounts or items, nor shall the same be used in any dispute or
controversy between the parties to determine whether any obligation, item or
matter (whether or not described herein or included in any schedule) is or is
not material for purposes of this Agreement.

 

8.10 _Assignments and Successors_. No Party may assign any of its rights or
delegate any of its obligations under this Agreement without the prior
written Consent of the other Parties. Any attempted assignment of this
Agreement or of any such rights or delegation of obligations without such
consent shall be void and of no effect. This Agreement will be binding upon,
and shall be enforceable by and inure solely to the benefit of, the parties
hereto and their respective successors and permitted assigns.

8.11 _No Third-Party Rights_. Nothing in this Agreement, express or implied,
