iii STOCK PURCHASE AGREEMENT

 

THIS STOCK PURCHASE AGREEMENT (this " _Agreement_ ") is entered into effective
as of April 28, 2017, by and among Apogee Enterprises, Inc., a Minnesota
corporation (" _Buyer_ "), EFCO Corporation, a Missouri corporation (the "
_Company_ "), and Pella Corporation, an Iowa corporation (" _Seller_ "). 
_Section_ __ _ 10.3_ contains certain interpretations and constructions.
_Article_ __ _ 11_ contains definitions of certain capitalized terms.

 

 _Recitals_

 

A. Seller owns all of the outstanding shares of the capital stock of
the Company (such outstanding shares are the " _Shares_ ").

 

B. The Company is engaged in the business of manufacturing, selling,
and installing aluminum extrusions, windows, window and curtain walls and
storefront and entry systems for non-residential or multi-family structures
(the " _Business_ ").

 

C. Seller intends to sell to Buyer, and Buyer intends to purchase from
Seller, all of the Shares, upon and subject to the terms of this Agreement.

_Agreement_

 

In consideration of the foregoing and the representations, warranties,
covenants and agreements in this Agreement, each Party hereby agrees as
follows:

_ARTICLE 1 - SALE AND PURCHASE OF SHARES_

 

Upon and subject to the terms herein, at Closing: (a) Seller will sell, assign
and transfer to Buyer all of the Shares, free and clear of all Encumbrances
(other than restrictions imposed by securities laws applicable to securities
generally); and (b) Buyer will purchase from Seller all of the Shares.

 

 _ARTICLE 2 - PURCHASE PRICE AND ADJUSTMENT_

 

2.1 _Purchase Price_. Upon and subject to the terms herein, Buyer
will pay to Seller the aggregate amount of $195,000,000, as such amount is
adjusted pursuant to the terms herein, including that the Purchase Price
automatically will be increased or decreased (as applicable) by the amount
that the Closing Purchase Price is increased or decreased, respectively,
pursuant to _Section 2.4(e)_ (such amount, as so adjusted, is the " _Purchase
Price_ "), as follows:

 

(a) At Closing in the manner stated in _Section 2.3_, Buyer will
pay to Seller the amount of $187,500,000 (the " _Initial Closing Purchase
Price_ "), as such amount is adjusted pursuant to the terms herein (such
amount, as so adjusted, is the " _Closing Purchase Price_ ").

 

(b) Additionally, by wire transfer of immediately available funds to
the account that Seller designates in writing, (1) on or before the date that
is one year after the Closing Date, Buyer will pay to Seller the amount of
$2,500,000, (2) on or before the date that is two years after the Closing
Date, Buyer will pay to Seller the amount of $2,500,000 and (3) on or before
the date that is three years after the Closing Date, Buyer will pay to Seller
the amount of $2,500,000. Notwithstanding any other term herein, and without
implying any contingency not expressly stated herein for any other payment
hereunder, regardless of any dispute that may exist with respect to any of the
Parties, Buyer acknowledges and agrees: (A) such payments under this 
_Section_ __ _ 2.1(b)_ are non-contingent and Buyer will make such payments
in full as and when due as stated above; and (B) in furtherance of the
foregoing, such payments under this  _Section_ __ _ 2.1(b)_ are not subject
to any adjustment, offset, set off right or other reduction by or on behalf of
Buyer or any of Buyers Other Indemnified Persons. 2.2 _Calculation of Estimated Closing Purchase Price for Closing_.
At least three (3) Business Days prior to Closing, Seller will deliver to
Buyer a written statement in reasonable detail (and with reasonable supporting
detail) containing Sellers good faith estimate of (1) Closing Cash, (2) Net
Working Capital and (3) the Closing Purchase Price. Such estimate of the
Closing Purchase Price, for Closing, will be the sum of (A) Closing Cash 
_plus_ (B) the amount resulting from the applicable clause (a), (b) or (c)
immediately below:

 

(a) the Initial Closing Purchase Price _plus_ any amount by which
such estimated Net Working Capital exceeds Target Net Working Capital;

(b) the Initial Closing Purchase Price _minus_ any amount by which
such estimated Net Working Capital is less than Target Net Working Capital; or

 

(c) the Initial Closing Purchase Price, if such estimated Net Working
Capital  _equals_ Target Net Working Capital.

The amount of such estimated Closing Purchase Price actually used for Closing
is the " _Estimated_ __ _Closing Purchase_ __ _Price_."

 

2.3 _Payment of Estimated Closing Purchase Price at Closing_
_and Related_ _Payments_. Upon and subject to the terms herein, at Closing,
Buyer will pay the Estimated Closing Purchase Price as follows:

 

(a) Buyer, on the Companys behalf, will pay the payoff amount, if
any, stated in each Payoff/Release Letter (if any) directly to each
applicable third party, as stated in such Payoff/Release Letter (however,
Seller will properly identify all Indebtedness of the Company for Closing, and
the foregoing will not limit Sellers obligations with respect to
Indebtedness of the Company hereunder);

 

(b) Buyer, on the Companys behalf, will pay all Closing
Transaction Expenses, by wire transfer of immediately available funds
directly to the accounts that Seller designates in writing on or before the
Closing Date, including that the following will occur with respect to any
payments to Company employees that are Closing Transaction Expenses that are
not paid before Closing: (1) Buyer will deposit with the Company (without
duplication) (A) the net amount to be so paid to each such employee, (B) the
Tax amount required to be withheld by the Company under Applicable Law in
connection with such payments under clause (b)(1)(A) above and (C) the
employers portion of the Taxes required by Applicable Law in connection with
such payments under clause (b)(1)(A) above; and (2) Buyer and the Company
will cause such deposited amounts to be promptly paid (but no later than when
due) to the applicable employee or Governmental Authority (however, Seller
will properly identify all Closing Transaction Expenses for Closing, and the
foregoing will not limit Sellers obligations with respect to Transaction
Expenses hereunder); and

 

(c) Buyer will pay to Seller, by wire transfer of immediately available
funds to the account that Seller designates in writing on or before the
Closing Date, the remaining balance (after reducing for the payments in the
preceding clauses of this _Section_ __ _ 2.3_) of the Estimated Closing
Purchase Price. 

2.4 _Purchase Price Adjustment_. Seller and Buyer will cooperate
with each other and each others representatives in all reasonable respects in
connection with the matters in this _Article_ __ _ 2_, including giving each
other and such representatives reasonable access at reasonable times to the
applicable personnel, properties, books and records of the Company for such
matters. The final determination of Net Working Capital pursuant to this
_Section_ __ _ 2.4_ is " _Final_ __ _ Net_ __ _Working_ __ _Capital_ ," and
the final determination of Closing Cash pursuant to this _Section_ __ _ 2.4_
is referred to as " _Final Closing Cash_."

 

(a) Buyers Preparation of the Statement. Within 90 days after the
Closing Date, Buyer will prepare and deliver to Seller a statement (the "
_Statement_ ") stating, in reasonable detail (and with reasonable supporting
detail), Buyers determination of Closing Cash and Net Working Capital.

 



2 (b) Sellers Response to the Statement. The Closing Cash and Net
Working Capital in the Statement will become final and binding upon the
Parties (and become Final Closing Cash and Final Net Working Capital,
respectively) (1) 45 days after Buyer gives the Statement to Seller, unless
Seller gives written notice, in reasonable detail (and with reasonable
supporting detail), of disagreement therewith to Buyer at or before the end of
such 45-day period (a " _Notice_ __ _of_ __ _Disagreement_ ") or (2) upon
Seller notifying Buyer that Seller will not give a Notice of Disagreement. If
Seller gives a Notice of Disagreement at or before the end of such 45-day
period, then Closing Cash or Net Working Capital or both (as finally
determined under the following clause (b)(x) or (b)(y)) will become final and
binding on the Parties upon the earlier of (x) the date Seller and Buyer
resolve in writing the differences they have with respect to the determination
of the Closing Cash or the Net Working Capital or (y) the date such
differences are finally resolved in writing by the Arbitrator pursuant to 
_Section_ __ _ 2.4(c)_.

(c) Resolving Matters in Disagreement. During the 30-day period after
a Notice of Disagreement is given, Seller and Buyer will attempt to resolve in
writing any differences they have regarding the determination of Closing Cash
or Net Working Capital. If, at the end of such 30-day period, Seller and Buyer
have not reached agreement on all such differences, then either Seller or
Buyer may require that the items that remain in dispute be promptly submitted
to an arbitrator (the " _Arbitrator_ ") for review and resolution. The
Arbitrator will be a regionally or nationally recognized public accounting
firm agreed upon by Seller and Buyer in writing; provided that the Arbitrator
will not be an accounting firm used by any Party (or any Affiliate of any
Party) within the preceding two years for valuation or audit purposes. If
Seller and Buyer cannot agree upon an Arbitrator within 20 Business
Days after first attempting to do so, then the Arbitrator will be selected by
lot from a list of four so qualified, potential Arbitrators remaining after
Seller nominates three, Buyer nominates three, and Seller and Buyer each
eliminates one potential Arbitrator from the others nominations (if Seller
and Buyer are unable to engage such proposed Arbitrator within a reasonable
period thereafter, including if such proposed Arbitrator is unwilling to agree
to such engagement, then the forgoing will repeat until an Arbitrator is so
engaged). The Arbitrator will determine procedures for such arbitration,
subject to the terms hereof. The Arbitrator will only consider the items that
remain in dispute. The Arbitrator will render a decision resolving such items
in dispute within 30 days after completion of submissions to the Arbitrator.
The Arbitrator will determine Final Closing Cash or Final Net Working Capital,
as applicable, solely based on submissions made by Seller and Buyer that are
consistent with the terms hereof (and not by independent review). The
Arbitrator will not assign a value to any item that is greater than the
greater value for such item claimed by Seller or Buyer or less than the lesser
value for such item claimed by Seller or Buyer.

(d) Allocation of Fees and Expenses. The Non-Prevailing Party in such
arbitration will pay its own and its Affiliates fees and expenses with
respect to such arbitration and will also pay a fraction of the fees
and expenses of the Arbitrator determined as follows: (A) its numerator will
be an amount equal to the difference between the Non-Prevailing Partys
determination of the items in dispute (in the aggregate and as submitted to
the Arbitrator) and the Arbitrators determination of such items; and (B) its
denominator will be an amount equal to the difference between Sellers and
Buyers respective determinations of such items (in the aggregate and as
submitted to the Arbitrator). The Prevailing Party will pay the remainder of
the fees and expenses of the Arbitrator and its own and its Affiliates fees
and expenses. Notwithstanding the foregoing, if the Arbitrators
determination of such items in dispute is exactly midway between Sellers and
Buyers determination of such items, then Seller and Buyer each will pay (A)
one-half of the fees and expenses of the Arbitrator and (B) its own and its
Affiliates fees and expenses. Seller or Buyer is the " _Prevailing_ __
_Party_ " if the Arbitrators determination of such items is closer to
such Partys determination of such items than it is to the other Partys
determination of such items (in each case in the aggregate and as submitted to
the Arbitrator). Seller or Buyer is the " _Non_ _-_ _Prevailing_ __ _Party_ "
if the other is the Prevailing Party.

 



3 (e) Adjustment to Closing Purchase Price Based on Final Closing Cash
and Final Net Working Capital. The Closing Purchase Price will be, and
automatically will be adjusted to be, the Initial Closing Purchase Price:

 

(1) (A) increased by the amount, if any, by which Final Closing Cash
_exceeds_ zero ($0) or (B) decreased by the amount, if any, by which Final
Closing Cash _is less than_ zero ($0) (however, if Final Closing Cash _equals_
zero ($0), then the Closing Purchase Price will not be adjusted under this
clause (e)(1)); and

 

(2) (A) increased by the amount, if any, by which Final Net Working
Capital _exceeds_ Target Net Working Capital or (B) decreased by the amount,
if any, by which Final Net Working Capital _is less than_ Target Net Working
Capital (however, if Final Net Working Capital _equals_ Target Net Working
Capital, then the Closing Purchase Price will not be adjusted under this
clause (e)(2)).

However, if no such adjustment is required pursuant to such clause (e)(1) and
(e)(2) above, or such adjustments exactly offset each other, then the Closing
Purchase Price will _equal_ the Initial Closing Purchase Price.

 

(f) Reconciliation Payment. Within five Business Days after both of
the Final Closing Cash and the Final Net Working Capital become final and
binding on the Parties, the following will occur (with the payments in this
Section below being made by wire transfer of immediately available funds,
without interest):

(1) if the Estimated Closing Purchase Price (as paid at Closing) _is
less than_ the Closing Purchase Price (as adjusted, if at all, under _Section_
__ _ 2.4(e)_), then Buyer will pay to Seller the amount of such difference;

 

(2) if the Estimated Closing Purchase Price (as paid at Closing)
_exceeds_ the Closing Purchase Price (as adjusted, if at all, under _Section_
__ _ 2.4(e)_), then Seller will pay to Buyer the amount of such excess; or

 

(3) if the Estimated Closing Purchase Price (as paid at Closing)
_equals_ the Closing Purchase Price (as adjusted, if at all, under _Section
2.4(e)_ ), then no payment will be made by Seller or Buyer.

 

(g) Target Net Working Capital Defined. " _Target_ __ _Net_ __
_Working_ __ _Capital_ " means the amount of $31,900,000, which will not be
subject to adjustment on account of the definition of, or
methodologies, adjustments or exceptions with respect to the calculation of,
Net Working Capital.

 

(h) Closing Cash and Net Working Capital Defined. " _Closing Cash_ "
means Cash, determined as of the Effective Time, and " _Cash_ " means cash,
restricted cash, and marketable securities, in each case determined in
accordance with GAAP (and, for the avoidance of doubt, Cash will
be calculated net of issued but uncleared checks and drafts for which the
Company is obligated, but will include checks, other wire transfers and drafts
deposited or available for deposit for the account of the Company). " _Net_ __
_ Working_ __ _Capital_ " means an amount equal to (1) current assets of the
Company (excluding Cash) _minus_ (2) current liabilities of the Company
(excluding Closing Transaction Expenses and any Indebtedness that will be
paid at Closing), in each case determined as of the Effective Time and in
accordance with the following, in decreasing order of precedence: (A) any
methodology, adjustment or exception stated in _Exhibit 2.4(h)_ (such
Exhibit, with such methodologies, adjustments or exceptions, is the " _Net
Working Capital Exhibit_ "); (B) to the extent not inconsistent with the
foregoing, the determination of Target Net Working Capital; (C) to the extent
not inconsistent with the foregoing, GAAP; and (D) to the extent not
inconsistent with the foregoing the Companys past practices.

 



4 2.5 _Allocation of Purchase Price_ ___After_ _Closing_. Each
Party will allocate the Purchase Price in accordance with _Exhibit_ __ _
2.5_. The Parties will, and will cause their respective Affiliates to, make
consistent use of such allocation, as adjusted to reflect any, if any,
adjustments needed to remain consistent with Final Net Working Capital and the
resulting adjustment to the Purchase Price, for all Tax purposes. With
respect to such allocation, as so adjusted, each Party will (a) be bound by
such allocation, (b) act in accordance with such allocation in the preparation
and the filing of all Tax Returns and in the course of any Tax audit,
Tax review or other Tax Proceeding relating thereto and (c) take no position
and cause its Affiliates to take no position inconsistent with such allocation
for Tax purposes (including in connection with any Proceeding), unless in each
case otherwise required pursuant to a "determination" within the meaning of
section 1313(a) of the Code.

_ARTICLE 3 - REPRESENTATIONS AND WARRANTIES OF SELLER _

Seller hereby represents and warrants to Buyer as follows in this  _Article
3_ :

3.1 _Organization and Good Standing_. Seller is a duly organized
and validly existing corporation in good standing under the laws of the State
of Iowa. Seller is duly qualified and in good standing to do business as a
foreign corporation in each jurisdiction in which the ownership or leasing of
its properties or assets or the conduct of its business requires such
qualification. Seller has full corporate power and authority to own and lease
its properties and assets and conduct its business. 

3.2 _Authority and Authorization; Conflicts_.

 

(a) Authority and Authorization. This Agreement and each Transaction
Document of Seller or any of its Affiliates (other than the Company) is the
legal, valid and binding obligation of Seller and each such applicable
Affiliate, enforceable against Seller and each such applicable Affiliate in
accordance with its terms, except to the extent enforceability may be limited
by any Enforcement Limitation. Seller and each such applicable Affiliate has
all corporate power and authority to enter into this Agreement and each
Transaction Document to be executed and delivered by Seller or such
applicable Affiliate and to consummate the transactions contemplated herein
and therein.

 

(b) Conflicts. Neither the execution nor delivery by Seller of this
Agreement or by Seller or any Affiliate of Seller (other than the Company) of
any Transaction Document nor consummation by Seller or any such Affiliate of
Seller of the transactions contemplated herein or therein does or will (with
or without the passage of time or giving notice): (1) constitute a breach of,
violate, conflict with or give rise to or create any right or Liability under
any Organizational Document of Seller; or (2) violate any Applicable Law or
Order with respect to Seller, except that Seller makes no representation or
warranty in this Section or otherwise with respect to any of the Transition
Services.

 

3.3 _Ownership of Shares_. Seller has good and valid title to all of
the Shares, free and clear of any Encumbrance (other than restrictions imposed
by securities laws applicable to securities generally) and, immediately upon
Buyers purchase of the Shares at Closing, Buyer will hold all outstanding

Items.

__ _ 6.1_, in preparation for Closing and also to the extent not accomplished
at Closing then additionally as soon after Closing as is reasonably
practical, at Buyers expense (regardless of whether before, at or after

following, as applicable based on the form of any item of Seller Collateral,
and Seller will use commercially reasonable efforts to cooperate with Buyer
with respect to the same:

 

(1) secure the unconditional release of Seller and each
applicable Affiliate of Seller with respect to all Seller Collateral; and

 

(2) return to Seller all such Seller Collateral (in each case including
Buyer arranging, and bearing the cost of, the placement of any backstop or

policy, bond or similar instrument or other Contract, or Buyer arranging, and

other guarantee).

 

(b) Reimbursement for Continued Items after Closing. After Closing,
Buyer will reimburse Seller (or such an Affiliate of Seller) for each cost or

Seller) or with respect to which Seller (or any Affiliate of Seller) is
obligated, in each case if with respect to any existing or contingent
obligation of the Company.

to), cause any guaranty by the Company of any obligation of Seller or any of
its Affiliates to be terminated, extinguished, discharged, or replaced, in a
manner reasonably satisfactory to Buyer.

 



28 6.3 _Certain Insurance Matters_.

(a) Claims Made Insurance. Prior to the Closing, Seller and the
Company will cooperate with Buyer in all reasonable respects in Buyers
attempts to purchase, at Buyers expense and having terms and conditions
reasonably acceptable to Buyer, a tail policy in the Companys name for each
of the insurance policies identified on _Schedule 6.3(a)_, with the cost of
the premiums for such policies to be split evenly between Seller and Buyer,
except that Sellers portion of such cost of such premiums will not exceed
$75,000.

(b) Pursuit of Certain Coverage. After Closing, if Buyer reasonably
believes that (x) any actual or potential Loss of the Company is then covered,
in whole or in part, by any liability (including without limitation fiduciary,
crime or employment practices liability) or property insurance policy of
Seller or any Affiliate of Seller (" _Seller Liability Insurance_ ") and (y)
such Loss is not entirely covered by any insurance policy of the Company or
any Affiliate of the Company (or such insurance policy in this clause (b)(y)
has any so-called "other insurance clause" that gives the right of
contribution from any Seller Liability Insurance), then Buyer in its sole
discretion may (in addition to any other remedies that may be available to
Buyer, including, without limitation, indemnification under _Article 9_
hereof, if applicable) give a notice to Seller that states such belief and
describes such Loss in reasonable detail (to the extent known to Buyer). If
Buyer gives such a notice, then the following terms of this _Section 6.3(b)_
will apply:

 

(1) The Parties promptly will cooperate in all reasonable respects,
at Buyers (or, at Buyers direction, the Companys) expense, to determine if
there is a reasonable likelihood that the conditions in clauses 6.3(b)(x) and
6.3(b)(y) above are satisfied.

 

(2) If such a reasonable likelihood under clause (b)(1) above
exists, then, at Buyers (or, at Buyers direction, the Companys) expense
(including that Buyer or the Company will pay any deductible, retention, self-
insurance amount or increase in insurance premium), Seller will, and will
cause its applicable Affiliates to, file a claim and otherwise use
commercially reasonable efforts to obtain the related insurance proceeds from
the insurer under such Seller Liability Insurance, except that Seller will
have no obligation to initiate or conduct any Proceeding to obtain any such
proceeds or coverage.

 

(3) To the extent Seller or any Affiliate of Seller actually recovers
any such insurance proceeds under clause (b)(2) above, then Seller will pay
(or cause such Affiliate to pay) to Buyer an amount equal to the _difference
of_ (A) such amount of such recovered proceeds (but not to exceed the amount
of such associated Loss of the Company) _minus_ (2) the reasonable costs and
expenses (including any Tax or increase in insurance premium) of Seller or any
Affiliate of Seller incurred in connection with the foregoing (to the extent
not already reimbursed by Buyer or the Company).

(4) In the event Buyer seeks recovery under the Seller Liability
Insurance pursuant to this _Section 6.3(b)_, the applicable survival period
for any claim of any breach of any covenant, representation or warranty based
on such facts or circumstances under  _Section_ __ _ 9.4_ shall not expire
as a result of seeking such recovery if Buyer also has properly and timely
made such claim for indemnification therefor as required pursuant to _Article_
__ _ 9_.

 

(c) Certain Insurance Arrangements, Fronting Arrangements and
Reimbursements. 

(1) After Closing, if Seller or any Affiliate of Seller is obligated to
reimburse or otherwise incur or pay any amount (including deductible,
retention, self-insurance or fronting

 



29  reimbursement) with respect to any Liability Insurer with respect to any
amount that such Liability Insurer paid or is obligated to pay to any third
party with respect to any obligation of the Company or any Affiliate of the
Company, then (A) Seller will notify Buyer of such obligation of Seller (or
such Affiliate of Seller) and (B) the Company will, and Buyer will cause the
Company to, promptly pre-pay to such Liability Insurer or reimburse Seller (or
such Affiliate of Seller), as applicable, the amount of such obligation of
Seller (or such Affiliate of Seller) (unless and to the extent such
amounts fall within the definition of Losses that are the subject of a
pending indemnification claim by Buyer or an Other Buyer Indemnified Party
pursuant to _Section_ __ _ 9.1_, in which event Seller or an Affiliate of
Seller will pay such amounts, subject to reimbursement from Buyer in the
event that such amounts are ultimately determined not to be recoverable by

6.5 _Access to Information_.

 

(a) Pre-Closing Access for Buyer. From the date hereof through Closing,
subject to Applicable Law, the terms of the Confidentiality Agreement and
Sellers reasonable confidentiality precautions, including those based on the
confidential nature of this Agreement and the transactions contemplated
herein, the Company will cause Buyer and Buyers representatives to have
reasonable access during normal business hours and upon reasonable notice from
Buyer, to the facilities, officers, books and records of the Company for the
opportunity to prepare for the transition to Buyer of the Business and
ownership of the Company. Buyer and Buyers representatives will conduct such
preparation in a manner that does not unreasonably interfere with the
operations of the Company, will not have access to any business of Seller or
any of its Affiliates other than the Business and will not have access to any
personnel other than such officers without the written consent of Seller
(which consent will not be unreasonably withheld, conditioned, or delayed).
Without limiting any right or obligation under the Confidentiality Agreement,
Buyer will keep confidential, and Buyer will cause its representatives to keep
confidential, all confidential information that Buyer or any of Buyers
representatives receives from or on behalf of the Company or any of its
Affiliates in the course of the actions contemplated in this Section, and
Buyer will not, and Buyer will cause its representatives not to, use any of
such confidential information except in connection with this Agreement.

 

(b) Post-Closing Access for Seller. Throughout the seven-year period
after Closing, subject to Buyers reasonable confidentiality precautions,
during normal business hours and upon reasonable notice from Seller, Buyer
will: (A) cause Seller and Sellers representatives to have reasonable access
to the applicable books and records of the Company, and to the personnel
responsible for maintaining such books and records, in each case to the extent
necessary or reasonably desirable to defend or pursue any Proceeding, prepare
or file any Tax Return or address any other Tax, accounting, or legal matter,
or respond to any investigation or other inquiry by or under the control of
any Governmental Authority; and (B) permit Seller and Sellers representatives
to make copies of such books and records for such purposes, at Sellers
expense. If requested by Buyer, Seller first will demonstrate that such access
is for such a purpose.

 

(c) Post-Closing Retention of Information by Seller. At and after
Closing, Seller may retain in Sellers (or any of its Affiliates) possession,
subject to Buyers reasonable confidentiality precautions, any copies of any
books or records of such types described in _Section_ __ _ 6.5(b)_ that at
Closing already are in Sellers possession or control (or the possession or
control of any of its Affiliates, other than the Company), in each case for
any purpose described in  _Section_ __ _ 6.5(b)_; provided, however, that
copies of any books and records described in this _Section 6.5(c)_ are also
provided to Buyer or the Company.

 



32 6.6 _Further Assurances_. If after Closing any further action is
necessary or reasonably desirable to carry out any purpose of this Agreement,
then each Party will take such further action (including the execution and
delivery of further documents) as another Party reasonably requests to carry
out such purpose. The foregoing will be at the expense of such requesting
Party, except to the extent such requesting Party is entitled to
indemnification therefor or to the extent this Agreement otherwise allocates
such expense or obligation to any other Party.

6.7 _Confidentiality_ _and Publicity_.

(a) Confidentiality Agreement and Pre-Closing Contacts. The
Confidentiality Agreement between Buyer and the Company, dated October 4, 2016
(the " _Confidentiality Agreement_ "), will remain in full force and
effect pursuant to its terms upon and following the date hereof, except that
the Confidentiality Agreement is hereby automatically terminated, effective as
of the Effective Time (but subject to the conclusion of Closing occurring).
From the date hereof until the Effective Time, at the request of Buyer, but
subject to the prior consent of Seller in each instance (not to be
unreasonably withheld, conditioned, or delayed), Buyer and its Affiliates and
representatives will be entitled to contact or communicate with insurers,
customers, suppliers, distributors, landlords, lenders or other Contract
parties of the Company with respect to any of the transactions contemplated
herein, the Company and the Business.

 

(b) Publicity; Filings Required by Applicable Law.

 

(1) Except as stated in this _Section_ __ _ 6.7(b)_, each Party
will not, and each Party will cause each of its Affiliates not to, make any
public release or announcement regarding this Agreement or any of the
transactions contemplated herein without the prior written consent of each
Party.

 

(2) Buyer and Seller will cooperate with the other in issuing, promptly
after Closing a joint press release (with mutually agreed upon text) that
announces transactions contemplated herein generally. Additionally, Buyer will
file, promptly following the execution of this Agreement and within the time
period required by Applicable Law, a Form 8-K relating to the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement, which will include as exhibits the
aforementioned press release and a copy of this Agreement (but not any
Schedule), and which will subsequently be amended by Buyer within 75 days
from Closing to reflect certain pro forma and historical financial statements
of the Buyer as required by Applicable Law.

 

(c) Confidential Information of the Company. Throughout the five-year
period after Closing, Seller will, and will cause its Affiliates to, keep
confidential, not disclose and not use any Confidential Information.

 

(d) Confidentiality of this Agreement. At all times, each Party will,
and will cause its Affiliates to, not disclose any of the specifics terms of
this Agreement.

 



33 (e) Certain Permitted Disclosures. Notwithstanding the foregoing,
nothing in _Section_ __ _ 6.5_ or this _Section_ __ _ 6.7_ prohibits any of
the following:

 

(1) a Party or any of its Affiliates disclosing any information to
the extent required under Applicable Law; provided, however, that if a Party
or any of such Partys Affiliates is so required to so disclose any
information that otherwise would be prohibited in the absence of this clause
(e)(1), then (A) such Party first will provide to each other Party prompt
written notice thereof and cooperate (and cause such Affiliate to cooperate)
with each such other Party, to the extent such other Party reasonably and
promptly requests, so that such other Party may seek a protective order or
other appropriate remedy or waive compliance with the terms of this Agreement
(subject, in each case, to legal requirements to the contrary) and (B) if such
protective order or other remedy is not obtained, or if such other Party
waives compliance with the terms of this Agreement, then such Party will (and
will cause such Affiliate, as applicable, to) disclose only the portion of
such information that is required to be so disclosed, and such Party will
(and will cause such Affiliate, as applicable, to) use its commercially
reasonable efforts, at the expense of such Party, to obtain reasonable
assurance that confidential treatment will be given to such information;

 

(2) a Party or any of its Affiliates communicating to its direct
or indirect owners in a non-public manner;

 

(3) a Party or any of its Affiliates making a statement or
disclosure (A) as part of its or any of its Affiliates financial statements
or, notwithstanding clause (e)(1) above, Tax Returns, or (B) to the extent
reasonably necessary to enforce or comply with this Agreement;

 

(4) a Party making a statement or disclosure to (A) such Partys (or any
of its Affiliates) paid legal, accounting or financial advisers to the extent
reasonably necessary for any such adviser to perform its paid legal,
accounting or financial services, respectively, for such Party (or such
Affiliate) or (B) any lender, acquirer, or investor or prospective lender,
acquirer, or investor of such Party (or such Affiliate) to the extent
reasonably required as part of such lending or investing relationship;
provided, however, that such Party will cause each Person to whom such
statement or disclosure is made under this clause (e)(4) to keep confidential
and not disclose to any other Person any information in such statement or
disclosure; or

 

(5) a Party from taking any action contemplated in _Article 9_
or defending any claim by any Party, and using any related information in
doing so.

 

6.8 _Employee Matters_.

 

(a) Employee Benefits. Throughout the one-year period after Closing,
Buyer will, or will cause one or more of Buyers Affiliates to, provide to
each employee of the Company (and their dependents) cash compensation and
employee benefits that as a whole are at least as favorable to such employees
(and dependents) in all material respects as the employee benefits received by
such employees (and their dependents) immediately before Closing; provided,
however, that health benefits are not covered by the foregoing obligation.
For purposes of the foregoing determination (and, as stated above, without
regard to any health benefits), post-Closing cash compensation and employee
benefits of employees (and their dependents) who were transferred from Seller
to the Company prior to the date hereof (the " _Transferred Employees_ ") will
be at least as favorable to such employees (and dependents) in all material
respects as the cash compensation and employee benefits of such employees
(and their dependents) offered to them by the Company (rather than Seller)
prior to the Closing. Without limiting any obligation already existing, to the
maximum extent permitted by Applicable Laws and applicable plan terms,
for purposes of eligibility, vesting and entitlement to vacation, sick leave,
paid time off, severance and similar benefits, Buyer will cause each employee
of the Company to be given or retain (as applicable) full credit under the
employee benefits of Buyer and its Affiliates after Closing for such
employees

 



34  service with Seller or its Affiliates before Closing (including the full
carryover to such benefits or retention, as applicable, of any earned, but
unused, time or pay with respect to the foregoing). To the maximum extent
permitted by Applicable Laws and applicable plan terms, each such employee
(and such dependent) will be allowed to participate in such employee benefits
without regard to preexisting conditions, waiting periods, evidence of
insurability or other exclusions or limitations not imposed on such individual
by, or which were otherwise satisfied under, the Companys and its Affiliates
employee benefits before Closing. To the maximum extent permitted
by Applicable Laws and applicable plan terms, Buyer will apply or credit (or
cause to be applied or credited) toward any deductible requirements under its
Welfare Plans all amounts paid by employees, under Company Plans that are
Welfare Plans, during the Company Plans plan year in which the Closing Date
occurs.

 

(b) Certain COBRA Obligations. At all times from and after the Effective
Time, Buyer will, or will cause an Affiliate of Buyer to, make available all
COBRA Coverage, with respect to (1) all employees of the Company or their
dependents who experience a qualifying event after the Effective Time, and (2)
to the extent required by Treas. Reg. Section 54.4980B-9, all "MandA Qualified
Beneficiaries" as such term is defined therein. " _COBRA_ __ _ Coverage_"
means the continuation of health coverage requirements of Part 6 of Subtitle
B of Title I of ERISA as added by COBRA and subsequent amendments.

 

(c) No Amendment of Benefits nor Third-Party Beneficiary. Without
limiting _Section_ __ _ 10.4_, (1) no Plan or other employee benefit is or
will be deemed to be amended by any term hereof and (2) no Person, including
any employee (or dependent thereof) of the Company, is a third party
beneficiary of any term of this _Section_ __ _ 6.8_.

 

6.9 _Exculpation and Indemnification of Directors and
Officers_. Throughout the six-year period after Closing, Buyer will prevent
the amendment, repeal or modification of any provision in any Organizational
Document of the Company relating to exculpation or indemnification, it being
the intent of the Parties that such officers or directors (or similar
executives) will continue to be entitled to such exculpation and
indemnification for such acts or omissions to the greatest extent permitted
under Applicable Law. Additionally, following the Closing, Seller will
maintain a directors and officers liability policy, with a coverage period
of at least six years, covering acts or omissions occurring before the
Effective Time of such officers or directors (or similar executives) on terms
no less favorable than those of the current directors and officers liability
insurance maintained by Seller (which currently covers the Company and its
Affiliates with respect to pre-Closing matters). Buyers obligations under
this Section will not be terminated or modified in a manner that adversely
affects any Person to whom this Section relates with respect to pre-Effective
Time acts or omissions without the consent of such affected Person (it being
expressly agreed that each such Person to whom this Section relates will be a
third party beneficiary of this Section).

 

6.10 _Certain Tax Matters_.

 

(a) Payment of Taxes. Seller will satisfy (or cause to be satisfied) in
full when due all Taxes with respect to (1) the Company with respect to any
Pre-Closing Tax Period, (2) any member of an affiliated, consolidated,
combined or unitary group of which the Company (or any predecessor thereto)
is or was a member before Closing to which one or more entities other than the
Company is or was also a member, including Taxes pursuant to Treasury
Regulation 1.1502-6 or any similar Applicable Law, and (3) any Person (other
than the Company) imposed on the Company for any period as a transferee or
successor with respect to a transaction occurring on or before the Closing
Date, by Applicable Law, Contract or otherwise (all of such Taxes being the "
_Pre_ _-Closing Taxes_"). Buyer will satisfy (or cause to be satisfied) in
full when due all Tax Liabilities with respect to any period that is not a
Pre-Closing Tax Period. If Buyer is required under _Section_ __ _ 6.10(b)_ to
file a Tax Return that involves Pre-Closing Taxes, then no later than five
Business Days before the filing of any such Tax Return, Seller will pay to
Buyer an amount equal to the amount of Taxes shown due on such Tax Return for
which Seller is obligated with respect to such Tax Return.

 



35 (b) Filing Responsibility. Seller will include all items of income,
gain, deduction, loss and credit of the Company in Sellers Tax Returns,
including any applicable consolidated, combined and unitary income and
franchise Tax Returns for tax periods ending on or before the Closing Date
and will be liable for all Taxes with respect to such Tax Returns (each a "
_Seller Tax Return_ "). Seller will prepare or cause to be prepared and timely
file or cause to be timely filed all Tax Returns for the Company for the Pre-
Closing Tax Period (each a " _Pre-Closing Tax Return_"). Buyer will prepare
and timely file (or cause to be prepared and timely filed) all Tax Returns
required to be filed by the Company that Seller is not obligated to prepare
and timely file (or cause to be prepared and timely filed) pursuant to this
_Section_ __ _ 6.10(b)_. If any such Tax Return (whether original
or amended) prepared (or caused to be prepared) by Buyer relates to any Pre-
Closing Tax Period or if any such Tax Return (whether original or amended)
prepared (or caused to be prepared) by Seller relates to any period that is
not a Pre-Closing Tax Period, then such Tax Return will be prepared in
accordance with the past practice of the Company (except to the extent
otherwise required by Applicable Law) and the preparing Party will give to
the other Parties a copy of such Tax Return as soon as practicable after the
preparation thereof, but not less than fifteen (15) days prior to the due date
for the filing of such Tax Return, for such others review and comment. Such
preparing Party will consider in good faith any changes to such Tax Return
that are reasonably requested.

 

(c) Cooperation. Each Party will, and each Party will cause its
applicable Affiliates to, cooperate in all reasonable respects with respect
to Tax matters and provide one another with such information as is reasonably
requested to enable the requesting Party to complete and file all Tax Returns
it may be required to file (or cause to be filed) with respect to the
Company, to respond to Tax audits, inquiries or other Tax Proceedings and to
otherwise satisfy Tax requirements. Such cooperation also will include
promptly forwarding copies (to the extent related thereto) of (1) relevant
Tax notices, forms or other communications received from or sent to any
Governmental Authority and (2) reasonably requested copies of all relevant Tax
Returns together with accompanying schedules and related work
papers, documents relating to rulings, audits or other Tax determinations by
any Governmental Authority and records concerning the ownership and Tax basis
of property.

 

(d) Refunds. Seller will be entitled to any refund or credit with respect
to any Tax for which Seller is obligated under this Agreement (plus any
interest received, by payment or credit, with respect thereto), and for which
Buyer has not reimbursed Seller, and Buyer will file (or cause to be filed)
any claims for any such refund or credit reasonably requested by Seller.
Except to the extent stated in this _Section 6.10(d)_ , Buyer will be entitled
to any refund or credit with respect to any Tax attributable to the Company
(plus any interest received, by payment or credit, with respect thereto).
Each Party will promptly forward to the proper Party, or reimburse the proper
Party for, any refund or credit due such proper Party after receipt thereof.
Refunds or credits for a Straddle Period will be allocated consistent with
the allocations in _Section_ __ _ 6.10(e)_.

 

(e) Straddle Periods. For purposes of this Agreement, the portion of Tax
with respect to the income, property or operations of the Company that is
attributable to any Straddle Period will be apportioned between the portion of
the Straddle Period that extends before the Closing Date through the Closing
Date (the " _Pre_ _-Closing_ __ _ Straddle_ __ _ Period_") and the portion
of the Straddle Period that extends from the day after the Closing Date to the
end of the Straddle Period in accordance with this _Section_ __ _ 6.10(e)_.
The portion of such Tax attributable to the Pre-Closing Straddle Period will
(1) in the case of any Tax other than Income Taxes, sales or use Taxes,
value-added Taxes, employment Taxes or similar withholding Taxes, be deemed to
be the amount of such Tax for the entire Taxable period multiplied by a
fraction, the numerator of which is the number of days in the Pre-Closing
Straddle Period and denominator of which is the number of days in the Straddle
Period, and (2) in the case of any Income Taxes, sales or use Taxes, value-
added Taxes, employment Taxes or withholding Taxes, be deemed equal to the
amount that would be payable if the Straddle Period ended on and included the
Closing Date. To the extent that any Tax for a Straddle Period is based on the
greater of a Tax on net income, on the one hand, and a Tax measured by net
worth or some other basis not otherwise measured by income, on the other hand,
the portion of such Tax related to the Pre-Closing Straddle Period will be
determined based on the foregoing and based on the manner in which the actual
Tax liability for the entire Straddle Period is determined.

 



36 (f) Transfer Taxes. Notwithstanding  _Section_ __ _ 6.10(a)_, Buyer
will pay all Transfer Taxes, and Seller and Buyer will cooperate in timely
making all filings, returns, reports and forms as may be required to comply
with the provisions of Applicable Law relating thereto.

(g) Tax-Sharing Agreements. Seller will terminate all Tax-sharing
agreements and similar arrangements with respect to the Company before or as
of the Closing Date to the extent required to cause the Company not to
be bound therefor or have any Liability thereunder after the Effective Time.

 

(h) Amended Returns and Related Matters. Without the prior written
consent of Seller, Buyer will not, and will cause the Company to not, (1)
file, amend or modify any Tax Return relating to any Pre-Closing Tax Period,
(2) extend or waive, or cause to be extended or waived, any statute of
limitations or other period for the assessment of any Tax or deficiency
related to a Pre-Closing Tax Period, (3) make or change any Tax election or
accounting method that has retroactive effect to any Pre-Closing Tax Period,
(4) self-assess any Tax with respect to a Pre-Closing Tax Period, (5) engage
in any voluntary disclosure or discussion with any Governmental Authority
regarding any Tax or Tax Return relating to a Pre-Closing Tax Period or (6)
file any private letter ruling or similar request with respect to any Tax or
Tax Return relating to a Pre-Closing Tax Period.

6.11 _Intercompany Services_. Without limiting the terms of the Supply
Agreement or the Transition Services Agreement or any of Sellers obligations
or Buyer or the Companys rights thereunder, each Party acknowledges and
agrees that, as of Closing, Seller and its Affiliates (other than the
Company), will cease providing to the Company any Intercompany Services,
except for any service prescribed by the Supply Agreement or the Transition
Services Agreement (but only to the extent provided therein), and the Company
shall have no payment or other obligations with respect to any such
discontinued Intercompany Services (except to the extent stated herein or
therein). " _Intercompany_ __ _ Services_" means services provided or
received by Seller or of any of its Affiliates to or from the Company prior to
the Closing, including the following services or activities provided by Seller
to the Company (in each case currently provided at Sellers expense to
varying degrees): (a) human resources and employee benefits processing and
administration; (b) participation by Company executives and Company key
management employees in any of the Pella Corporation Long-Term Incentive Plan,
Pella Corporation Key Management Share Purchase Plan, Pella Corporation Key
Management Supplemental Retirement Deferred Compensation Plan, Sellers
executive physical program or Sellers financial services program; (c)
participation by Company employees in Sellers employee assistance plan; (d)

program; (f) workers compensation matters, including shared broker services;
(g) payroll processing and administration; (h) financial auditing; (i) tax

Company); (l) information technology and software services and licenses,
including regarding or for Office 365 (including email and file storage), non-

related equipment, facsimile systems, onsite staffing of one individual
provided by Ricoh (which individuals actions include assistance in monthly
billing, copy center services, toner replacement, printer replacement and
printer and copier maintenance) and, for many of the foregoing, software and
equipment maintenance; (m) third party lending, cash management and credit
facilities; (n) market share analyses and marketing expenses; and (o)
services performed for the Company at Sellers West Chicago, Illinois
location.

 



37 6.12 _Transition Services_.

 

(a) Pre-Closing Transition Services. Commencing as of the date of this
Agreement, Seller and the Company will use commercially reasonable efforts to
perform the actions set forth on _Schedule 6.12(a)_ until the earlier of (i)
completion, (ii) the Closing, or (iii) the applicable date specified on
_Schedule 6.12(a)_. Buyer will cooperate in all reasonable respects with the
foregoing, and Buyer will reimburse Seller for the actual, documented costs
and expenses of Seller and its applicable Affiliates with respect to such
actions, including all associated costs and expenses imposed by any applicable
third party. Subject to Buyer and the Company each performing its obligations
under the Transition Services Agreement (and subject to Buyer performing
its obligations to so cooperate), such obligations on _Schedule 6.12(a)
_will be performed by Seller in good faith, in the manner described on
_Schedule 6.12(a)_, and, if applicable, in a manner and at a level (including
the level of care, skill, resources, prudence, timeliness and diligence) that
in all material respects is at or better than the level of quality, diligence
and responsiveness that Seller provided such services prior to the date
hereof. To the extent that any of the actions set forth on _Schedule

such services will be deemed "Transition Services" pursuant to the Transition
Services Agreement and will be completed in accordance with the applicable
terms thereof.

(b) Transition Services Agreement. Seller and the Company will enter
into a Transition Services Agreement, in the form attached hereto as
_Schedule_ __ _ 6.12(b)_ (the " _Transition_ __ _ Services_ __ _

Seller (or any Affiliate of Seller) under the Transition Services Agreement,
which are defined in the Transition Services Agreement as the Services.

 

6.13 _R andW Insurance_. On the date hereof and effective as of the date
hereof, contemporaneous with Buyer entering into this Agreement, at Buyers
expense (except that Seller will reimburse Buyer for 50% of the amount of the
premium for the RandW Insurance promptly following Buyers request, but such
reimbursement by Seller will not exceed $500,000), Buyer will enter into a
binder agreement with respect to the issuance of the RandW Insurance, such
binder agreement and the associated RandW Insurance being in the form previously
approved by Seller. At Buyers expense (except as provided in the preceding
sentence), Buyer will use its commercially reasonable efforts to comply with
all terms of such binder agreement to cause the proper issuance of the RandW
Insurance and Buyer will use its commercially reasonable efforts to, and
cause its applicable insurance broker to, take all actions necessary for the
RandW Insurance to be issued to Buyer as soon as practicable after Closing.
Buyer will not permit the RandW Insurance to be amended, waived or otherwise
modified in a manner that would allow the insurer thereunder or any other
Person to subrogate or otherwise make or bring any Proceeding against Seller
arising out of this Agreement, or the negotiation, exception, or performance
of this Agreement, except in the case of fraud (provided that such fraud is a
type of which an element is intent). " _R andW_ __ _ Insurance_" means a

(a) After Closing, each Party will, and will cause its Affiliates
to, promptly deliver to the proper Party any item (including mail or other
communications, monies, checks or other instruments of payment) received by
such Party or any of its Affiliates that belong to such other Party (or any of
its Affiliates) or to which such other Party (or any of its Affiliates) is
entitled.

(b) Notwithstanding  _Section 6.14(a)_ and without limiting the
representations and warranties in _Section 4.4(b)_, _4.9(c)_ or _4.18_ , each
Party acknowledges and agrees that: (1) certain specific aspects of the
business and operations of Seller and its Affiliates (other than the Company)
are of a similar type to portions of the business and operations of the
Company; (2) such businesses and operations in clause (b)(1) above include
manufacturing and selling certain windows (including curtain walls), doors
and other entry systems for certain structures; and (3) none of Seller, the
Company or any Affiliate of either of

 



38  them has or will have any right, title or interest in or to any asset of any
other of them, except to the extent of any license of Intellectual Property
under the Supply Agreement or Transition Services Agreement. For clarity,
such aspects of the business and operations of Seller and its Affiliates, and
the assets of Seller and its Affiliates relating thereto, are subject in all
respects to the restrictions and related exceptions set forth in _Section_ __
_ 6.17_.

6.15 _No Shop_. Throughout the period that begins on the date hereof and
ends upon the earliest of the Effective Time, termination of this Agreement
pursuant to _Section_ __ _ 7.4_ or the Final Date, Seller will not, and
Seller will cause each Affiliate of Seller and each other representative or
agent of Seller or such an Affiliate not to, directly or indirectly, solicit,
initiate, seek or encourage any inquiry, proposal or offer from, furnish any
information to or participate in any discussion or negotiation with any
Person (other than Buyer or any Person on Buyers behalf) regarding any
acquisition of the Companys capital stock, assets or business, in whole or in
part (by purchase, merger, tender offer, statutory share exchange,
joint venture or otherwise), except sales of inventory in the Ordinary Course
of Business of the Company. As of the date of this Agreement, Seller and its
Affiliates have discontinued, and have caused each of their respective
representatives to discontinue, any discussions relating to, or that could
reasonably be expected to lead to, directly or indirectly, any of the
aforementioned transactions with any Person other than Buyer. From and after
the date of this Agreement, Seller will within two (2) Business Days of
receipt notify Buyer (in writing and setting forth in reasonable details the
material terms thereof) of any offer or communication received from a Person
other than Buyer that would be subject to the first sentence of this
_Section_ __ _ 6.15_ if solicited by Seller.

6.16 _Waiver of Conflicts; Attorney_ __ _ Client Privilege Matters_.

 

(a) Buyer and the Company each hereby waives and agrees to not assert any
conflict of interest with respect to any post-Closing legal representation of
Seller or any Affiliate of Seller (any such Person, a " _Designated_ __ _
Person_" and such representation being the " _Post_ _-Closing_ __ _
Representation_") in any matter with respect to the Company or any of its
Affiliates, including this Agreement or any of the transactions contemplated
hereby, by any legal counsel previously or currently representing the Company
or any of its Affiliates (the " _Current_ __ _ Representation_").

 

(b) Buyer and the Company each hereby waives and agrees to not assert
after Closing in connection with any Post-Closing Representation any
attorney-client privilege with respect to any communication between any legal
counsel and any Designated Person occurring during the Current Representation
and specifically relating to this Agreement, the other Transaction Documents,
or the consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby or thereby,
including in connection with a dispute among any of Seller, Buyer and the
Company, it being the intention of the Parties that all such rights to such
attorney-client privilege and to control such attorney-client privilege will
be retained by Seller. Any post-Closing access by Buyer or the Company to any
such privileged communications (including through the Companys servers, email
systems or physical documents) will not be a waiver of such privilege by
Seller, nor will it adversely affect any rights of Seller with respect to such
privilege.

 

6.17 _Noncompetition and_ _Nonsolicitation_.

 

(a) Scope of Restrictions. Subject to _Section_ __ _ 6.17(b)_, for the
period of three (3) years from and after the Closing Date (the " _Restricted_
__ _ Period_"), Seller agrees that, as additional consideration for Buyers
performance hereunder, Seller shall not, and shall cause its Affiliates not
to, directly or indirectly, (1) invest in, own, manage, operate, finance,
control, advise in any material manner, render material services to or
guarantee the obligations of any Restricted Business in the
Restricted Territory; or (2) hire, retain or attempt to hire or retain any
employee of the Company (including any former employee) if such Person was an
employee of the Company within the twelve (12) month period prior to such
hiring, retention or attempt to hire or retain) or in any way interfere with
the relationship between the Company and such employees. " _Restricted_ __ _
Business_" means the business of manufacturing windows, curtain walls or
storefront entry systems, (i) for projects that are primarily

 



39  either non-residential or multi-family residential, and (ii) where a
substantial portion of the products used in the project are made (other than
the glass portion) primarily of aluminum; provided, however, that no action
with respect to any single-family residence will be included in the definition
of Restricted Business or otherwise restricted under this _Section_ __ _
6.17_ and, for the avoidance of doubt, no aluminum-clad product will be
considered made (or primarily made) of aluminum for purposes of the definition
of Restricted Business or any restriction under this _Section_ __ _ 6.17_. "
_Restricted_ __ _ Territory_" means the geographical area of the United
States of America.

 

(b) Exceptions. Notwithstanding _Section_ __ _ 6.17(a)_, nothing in
this Agreement prohibits or otherwise restricts Seller or any of its
Affiliates from performing, permitting or otherwise being involved in,
directly or indirectly, any of the following:

 

(1) investing in, owning, managing, operating, financing,
controlling, advising, rendering services to or guarantying the obligations
of any business (a " _Permitted_ __ _ Business_") if the portion of all such
Permitted Businesses (in the aggregate) engaged in the Restricted Business in
the Restricted Territory generated less than $30,000,000 in revenue of Seller
and all of its Affiliates (in the aggregate), from Persons not an Affiliate of
Seller, during any consecutive 12-month period during the Restricted Period;

 

(2) owning or holding less than 5% of the outstanding shares of any
class of security that is regularly traded on a recognized domestic or
foreign securities exchange or over-the-counter market;

 

(3) advertising, marketing or otherwise promoting any good or service
of Seller or any of its Affiliates, provided such advertising, marketing,
promotion or other communication does not directly compare, by use of any
company or brand name of the Company or any of its Affiliates, any particular
good or service in the Restricted Business of Seller or any of its Affiliates
to any particular good or service in the Restricted Business of the Company or
any of its Affiliates; or

 

(4) (A) general solicitation for employment or services (including
in any newspaper or magazine, over the internet or by any search or
employment agency) if not specifically directed towards any employee or
independent contractor of the Company, or (B) hiring, retaining or attempting
to hire or retain an individual where the initial contact with such
individual regarding such hiring or retention primarily arose from (x) any
such general solicitation or (y) initial contact by such individual that was
unsolicited by Seller or any Affiliate of Seller.

(c) Audit of Permitted Businesses. From time to time during the
Restricted Period and the six-month period thereafter (but not more frequently
than once in any 18-month period and not more than twice in the aggregate),
at Buyers expense and following reasonable advance notice to Seller, Buyer
may engage a regionally or nationally recognized public accounting firm to
conduct an audit to confirm Sellers proper usage of the exception in 
_Section_ __ _ 6.17(b)(1)_ to Sellers obligations under _Section_ __ _
6.17(a)(1)_. Such accounting firm will not be an accounting firm used by Buyer
or any of Buyers Affiliates within the preceding two years for any purpose,
other than a prior engagement under this _Section 6.17(c)_. Before any such
audit begins, Buyer will ensure that such accounting firm enters into a
customary (but tailored to the situation) confidentiality agreement with
Seller. Each such audit will be conducted during Sellers normal business
hours at Sellers facilities, and Seller will and will cause each of its
Affiliates to cooperate in all reasonable respects therewith, expect
that such accounting firm will not be permitted to make or obtain (regardless
of whether in physical or electronic form or otherwise) any copy of any
documentation. Such accounting firm will not disclose (and as part of such
engagement and such confidentiality agreement will be under an obligation to
Seller not to disclose or use) any information regarding Seller or any of its
Affiliates, to Buyer or any other Person, except whether or not Seller is
properly complying with the exception in  _Section_ __ _ 6.17(b)(1)_ to
Sellers obligations under

 



40   _Section_ __ _ 6.17(a)(1)_ and neither Buyer nor any of its Affiliates
will have any access to any such information; except that if such accounting
firm determines that Seller is not so complying with such exception, then (1)
such accounting firm will inform Seller of such determination and provide to
Seller a reasonable opportunity (including a 45-day period) to review
and comment regarding such accounting firms findings and (2) if after the
actions in clause (c)(1) above such accounting firm still determines that
Seller is not so complying with such exception, then such accounting firm may
disclose to Buyer its determination and the basis for such determination. In
the event that the accounting firm determines, in compliance with the
preceding sentence, that Seller is not complying with such exception, Seller
will promptly reimburse Buyer for all out-of-pocket costs and expenses
incurred by Buyer or its Affiliates (including without limitation, the fees
and expenses of the accounting firm) in connection with the audit in question
(without such reimbursement constituting an election of remedies on the part
of Buyer or otherwise limiting the rights of Buyer hereunder with respect to
such non-compliance or indemnification for legal fees or expenses associated
therewith).

(d) Modification of Covenant. If a final judgment of a court of
competent jurisdiction determines that any term or provision contained in
_Section_ __ _ 6.17_ is invalid or unenforceable, then the Parties agree that
the court will have the power to reduce the scope, duration or geographic
area of the term or provision, to delete specific words or phrases or to
replace any invalid or unenforceable term or provision with a term or
provision that is valid and enforceable and that comes closest to expressing
the intention of the invalid or unenforceable term or provision. This
_Section_ __ _ 6.17_ will be enforceable as so modified after the expiration
of the time within which the judgment may be appealed. Seller acknowledges
this _Section_ __ _ 6.17_ is reasonable and necessary to protect and preserve
Buyers and its Affiliates legitimate business interests.

 

(e) Enforcement of Covenant. The Parties agree that the remedy of damages
at law for the breach of any of the covenants contained in this _Section_ __
_ 6.17_ may be an inadequate remedy and that neither Seller nor its
Affiliates will challenge the enforceability or reasonableness of the
covenants set forth in this _Section_ __ _ 6.17_. In recognition of the
irreparable harm that a violation by Seller or its Affiliates of any of the
covenants, agreements or obligations arising under this _Section_ __ _ 6.17_
may cause Buyer and its Affiliates, Seller agrees that in addition to any
other remedies or relief afforded by law, an injunction against an actual or
threatened violation or violations may be issued against Seller or its
Affiliates without posting a bond or other security.

6.18 _Seller Release_.

 

(a) Release of Claims. Subject to the occurrence of and effective as of
the Effective Time, Seller, on behalf of itself and its Affiliates,

for (i) rights and claims arising from or in connection with this Agreement or
any of the subject matter hereof (including the indemnification rights
described in _Article 9_ hereof, rights with respect to the RandW Insurance,
and the Supply Agreement and the Transition Services Agreement), and (ii)
claims of fraud (provided that such fraud is a type of which an element is
intent).

behalf of itself and the Buyer Releasing Parties, acknowledges that there is
a possibility that subsequent to the execution of this Agreement, Buyer, the
Company or the Buyer Releasing Parties will discover facts or incur or suffer

Parties at that time may have materially affected their decision to execute

of the Closing Date as though made on and as of the Closing Date (but, in each
case, if any such representation and warranty is expressly stated to have
been made as of a specific date, then instead, for such representation and

Seller a certificate of a duly authorized officer of Buyer, dated the Closing

thereof, under the HSR Act will have expired or been duly terminated.

(e) No Legal Actions. No Governmental Authority of competent
jurisdiction and authority will have instituted any Proceeding to restrain,
prohibit or otherwise challenge the legality or validity of the transactions
contemplated herein that has not been dismissed or otherwise resolved in a
manner that does not materially and adversely affect the transactions
contemplated herein, and no injunction, order or decree of any such
Governmental Authority will be in effect that restrains or prohibits the

and Warranties. __Subject to the other terms of this _Article_ __ _ 9_,
Seller will not have any obligation under _Section_ __ _ 9.1(a)_ or _9.1(b)_

obligated thereunder exceeds $975,000 (the " _Deductible_ "), and then only
for the amount of such Losses in excess of the Deductible.

 

(b) Cap on Sellers Obligations for Certain Representations and
Warranties. Subject to the other terms of this _Article 9_ , Sellers
obligations under _Section_ __ _ 9.1(a)_ or _Section 9.1(b)_ , in the

(c) Deductible on Buyers Obligations for Certain Representations
and Warranties. __Subject to the other terms of this _Article_ __ _ 9_,

until the aggregate amount of Losses for which Buyer is obligated thereunder
exceeds the Deductible, and then only for the amount of such Losses in excess
of the Deductible.

 

(d) Cap on Buyers Obligations for Certain Representations and
Warranties. Subject to the other terms of this _Article_ __ _ 9_, Buyers
obligations under _Section_ __ _ 9.2(a)_, in the aggregate, will not exceed
an amount equal to the Cap.

 

(e) Exceptions for Fundamental Representations. Notwithstanding the
foregoing terms of this _Section_ __ _ 9.3_: (1) _ Section_ __ _ 9.3(a)_,
_9.3(b)_ , _9.3(c)_ or _9.3(d)_ will not limit any obligation with respect to
any Fundamental Representation; and (2) the amount of Losses indemnified
hereunder with respect to any Fundamental Representation will not be used in
determining if the Deductible or Cap has been reached or exceeded. "
_Fundamental_ __ _ Representation_" means any representation or warranty:
(A) in _Section_ __ _ 3.2(a)_, _3.3_ , _4.2_ , _4.3(a)_ , _4.4(f)_ , _4.5_ ,
_4.12_ , _4.27_ , _5.2(a)_ , _5.4_ , _5.5_ and _5.7_ ; or (B) that

(f) Sole and Exclusive Remedies. Notwithstanding any other term herein,
other than with respect to the use of an arbitrator under _Section_ __ _
2.4_ (which, for the avoidance of doubt does not preclude any remedy under
this _Article_ __ _ 9_ for any breach hereof) and other than in
connection with fraud

 



47  (provided that such fraud is a type of which an element is intent), the sole
and exclusive remedies of the Parties arising out of, relating to or resulting
from this Agreement or any Ancillary Document (including any breach of any
representation, warranty, covenant or agreement herein or therein) will be
limited to those contained in this _Article_ __ _ 9_, together with the RandW
Insurance.

 

(g) Specific Performance. Each Party acknowledges and agrees that
each other Party may be damaged irreparably, and monetary damages may be

or otherwise is breached or threatened to be breached and that a Party will be
entitled to seek an injunction and other equitable relief (without posting
any bond or other security) to prevent or stop breaches hereof and to enforce
specifically this Agreement and its terms in addition to any other remedy to
which such Party may be entitled.

(h) Effect of Materiality Qualifiers. For the sole purpose of
calculating the amount of Losses for which Buyer or Seller or their respective
Other Indemnified Persons may be entitled to indemnification hereunder, the

Effect" in _Articles 3_ , _4_ , or _5_ will be disregarded.

__ _ 9.4(b)_, each representation or warranty herein or in any Ancillary
Document will survive the execution and delivery of this Agreement and remain
in full force and effect until the date that is 12 months after the Closing
Date, at which time such representation or warranty will expire and terminate
and no indemnification, defend or hold harmless obligation will be associated
therewith or based thereon, except that each Fundamental Representation will
survive until (and then so expire and terminate) the earlier of (1) the date
that is thirty (30) days after the date that all liability relating thereto is
barred by all applicable statutes of limitation, or (2) the fourth
anniversary of the Closing Date, except the date under this clause (a)(2) will
be the third anniversary of the Closing Date for any representation or
warranty in _Section_ __ _ 4.12_;  _provided_ , _however_ , that the
representations and warranties set forth in _Section 4.5(l)_ will survive
until the date that is thirty (30) days after the date that all liability
relating thereto is barred by all applicable statutes of limitation.

(b) Survival of Representations and Warranties Until
Final Determination. Notwithstanding _Section_ __ _ 9.4(a)_, for each claim
for indemnification, defense or to be held harmless hereunder regarding a
representation or warranty that is validly made before expiration of
such representation or warranty, such claim and associated right to
indemnification, defense and to be held harmless (including any right to
pursue such matters, including via any Proceeding) will not expire or
terminate before final determination and satisfaction of such claim, subject
to any applicable limitation stated herein.

 

(c) Survival of Covenants and Agreements. Each covenant and
agreement herein or in any Ancillary Document, and all associated rights to
indemnification, defense or to be held harmless (including any right to pursue
such matters, including via any Proceeding), will survive Closing and will
continue in full force thereafter until all liability hereunder relating
thereto is barred by all applicable statutes of limitation, subject to any
applicable limitation stated herein.

 

9.5 _Notice of Claims and Procedures_.

 

(a) Notice of Claims. A Party entitled to indemnification, defense or
to be held harmless hereunder (the " _Claiming_ __ _ Party_") will give the
Party obligated to provide such indemnification, defense and hold harmless
(the " _Indemnifying_ __ _ Party_") prompt notice of any claim, specifying
the factual basis of such claim in reasonable detail to the extent known by
such Claiming Party, for which such 

 



48  Claiming Party proposes to demand indemnification, defense or to be held
harmless, (1) by a Person that is not a Party nor an Other Indemnified Person
(such a claim, including any Tax Claim, being a " _Third_ __ _ Party_ __ _
Claim_" and such notice of such Third Party Claim being the " _Initial_ __ _
Claim_ __ _ Notice_") or (2) that does not involve a Third Party Claim, in
each case specifying the amount and nature of such claim (to the extent
known). Thereafter, the Claiming Party will give the Indemnifying Party,
promptly after the Claiming Partys (or any of its applicable Other
Indemnified Persons) delivery or receipt thereof, copies of all material
documents (including court papers) of or received by the Claiming Party (or of
or by any such Other Indemnified Person) relating to any such Third
Party Claim. The failure to promptly give such notice or to promptly give
such copies will not relieve the Indemnifying Party of any Liability
hereunder, except if the Indemnifying Party was prejudiced thereby, but only
to the extent of such prejudice. 

(b) Access and Cooperation. Each Party will, and will cause its Other
Indemnified Persons to, cooperate and assist in all reasonable respects
regarding such Third Party Claim, including by promptly making available to
such other Party (and its legal counsel and other professional advisers with a
reasonable need to know) books and records of such Person relating to such
Third Party Claim, subject to reasonable confidentiality precautions.

 

(c) Defense and Participation Regarding Non-Tax Matters. This
_Section_ __ _ 9.5(c)_ relates only to Third Party Claims that are not a Tax
Claim.

 

(1) Election to Conduct Defense. Promptly after receiving an Initial
Claim Notice under _Section_ __ _ 9.5(a)_, the Indemnifying Party will have
the option to conduct the Defense of such Third Party Claim, at the expense of
the Indemnifying Party, except if (A) the aggregate amount of the potential
obligations of the Claiming Party (or its Other Indemnified Persons) regarding
such Third Party Claim exceeds the maximum obligations of the Indemnifying
Party under this Agreement regarding such Third Party Claim, (B) such Third
Party Claim seeks equitable or other non-monetary damages, (C) such Third
Party Claim alleges criminal conduct or would reasonably be expected to result
in criminal charges, penalties, or sanctions, (D) it is reasonably likely
that such Third Party Claim will otherwise adversely affect the Claiming Party
(or any of its Other Indemnified Persons), other than for money damages, or
(E) the Indemnifying Party fails to provide the Claiming Party with evidence
reasonably satisfactory to the Claiming Party that the Indemnifying Party has
the financial resources to actively and diligently conduct the Defense of such
Third Party Claim and fulfill the Indemnifying Partys indemnification,
defend and hold harmless obligations hereunder with respect thereto. To elect
to conduct such Defense, the Indemnifying Party must give written notice of
such election to the Claiming Party within 20 days (or within the shorter
period under Applicable Law, if any, during which a Defense must be commenced
for the preservation of rights) after the Claiming Party gives the
corresponding Initial Claim Notice to the Indemnifying Party (otherwise, such
right to conduct such Defense will be deemed waived). If the Indemnifying
Party validly makes such election, it will lose such right to conduct such
Defense if it fails to actively and diligently conduct such Defense.

 

(2) Conduct of Defense, Participation and Settlement. If the
Indemnifying Party conducts the Defense of such Third Party Claim, then (A)
the Claiming Party may participate, at its own expense, in such Defense
(including any Proceeding regarding such Third Party Claim) and will have the
right to receive copies of all notices, pleadings or other similar documents
regarding such Defense, (B) each Party will keep each other Party reasonably
informed of all matters material to such Defense and Third Party Claim at all
stages thereof and (C) no Party will (and each Party will cause its Other
Indemnified Persons not to) admit Liability with respect to, or compromise or
settle, such Third Party Claim without each other Partys prior written
consent (which consent will not be unreasonably withheld, conditioned, or
delayed).

 

(3) Indemnifying Party Does Not Conduct Defense. If the Indemnifying
Party does not conduct the Defense of such Third Party Claim, then the
Claiming Party may conduct the Defense of such Third Party Claim in any manner
that the Claiming Party reasonably deems appropriate, at the expense of the
Indemnifying Party (subject to the other limitations of this _Article_ __ _
9_ and to the extent that the Indemnifying Party is obligated therefor),
except that no Party will (and each Party will cause its Other Indemnified
Persons not to) admit Liability with respect to, or compromise or settle, such
Third Party Claim without each other Partys prior written consent (which
consent will not be unreasonably withheld, conditioned, or delayed).

 



49 (d) Procedures for Tax Claims. This _Section_ __ _ 9.5(d)_ only
relates to claims for indemnification, defense or to be held harmless that
involve a Tax Claim (and then only to such Tax Claim itself).

 

(1) Certain Procedures. The Indemnifying Party will control (at its
own expense) all Proceedings in connection with any Tax Claim and, without
limiting the foregoing, may take actions (including with any of its applicable
Other Indemnified Persons) that are consistent with this Agreement, including
to pursue or forego any hearing, conference or other Proceeding with any
applicable Governmental Authority with respect thereto, pay the Tax claimed,
sue for a refund (where Applicable Law permits such a refund suit) or contest
such Tax Claim (including any combination of the foregoing), except that the
Indemnifying Party and the Claiming Party will jointly control any Proceeding
in connection with any Tax Claim relating to any Tax with respect to the
Company with respect to a Straddle Period.

(2) Certain Limitations on Resolution of Tax Claims. Notwithstanding
_Section_ __ _ 9.5(d)(1)_, no Party will (and each Party will cause its Other
Indemnified Persons not to) admit Liability with respect to, or compromise or
settle, such Tax Claim without each other Partys prior written consent
(which consent will not be unreasonably withheld, conditioned, or delayed).

 

9.6 _Mitigation_ _; R andW Insurance_. Each Party will use its
commercially reasonable efforts to mitigate (including by causing its Other
Indemnified Persons to use commercially reasonable efforts to mitigate) each
Loss for which such Party is or may become entitled to be indemnified,
defended or held harmless hereunder, including (a) first diligently pursuing
and attempting to obtain all available insurance proceeds, including with
respect to RandW Insurance, (b) refraining from encouraging or soliciting any
Third Party Claim, and (c) otherwise taking such actions to mitigate such
Losses as may be required by applicable contract law principles.

 

9.7 _Reduction for Insurance, Taxes and Other Offsets_. The
obligations of each Indemnifying Party hereunder regarding any Loss will be
reduced, including retroactively, by the amount of any insurance proceeds or
benefit regarding Taxes (a " _Tax_ __ _ Benefit_") actually received by the
Claiming Party (or any of its Other Indemnified Persons) regarding such Loss
(except this _Section_ __ _ 9.7_ will not limit the subrogation rights of
the insurer under the express terms of the RandW Insurance). Without limiting
the generality of the foregoing, if (a) the Claiming Party (or such Other
Indemnified Person) receives from or on behalf of an Indemnifying Party, or an
Indemnifying Party pays on behalf of the Claiming Party (or such Other
Indemnified Person), a payment regarding a Loss, and (b) the Claiming Party
(or such Other Indemnified Person) receives any insurance proceeds or Tax
Benefit regarding such Loss, then such Claiming Party (for itself or on
behalf of such Other Indemnified Person, as applicable) will promptly pay to
the Indemnifying Party the amount of such insurance proceeds or Tax Benefit,
or if less, the amount of such payment. The amount of insurance proceeds or
the Tax Benefit actually received will be net of any reasonable costs and
expenses incurred by the Claiming Party (or such Other Indemnified Person) in
procuring the same and after giving effect to the identified impact of
such recovery on insurance premiums or other costs of insurance.

 



50 9.8 _Knowledge and Investigation_. The right of Buyer or Seller or
their respective Other Indemnified Persons to indemnification, defense or to
be held harmless pursuant to this _Article 9_ will not be affected by any
investigation conducted or knowledge acquired (or capable of being acquired)
at any time, whether before or after the execution and delivery of this
Agreement or the Closing, with respect to the accuracy of any representation
or warranty, or performance of or compliance with any covenant or agreement
under this Agreement.

 

9.9 _Subrogation_.

 

(a) Each Party hereby waives (and agrees to cause its applicable Other
Indemnified Persons to waive), to the extent permitted under its (and their)
insurance policies, any subrogation rights that its (or their) applicable
insurers may have against the Indemnifying Party with respect to any Loss.

 

(b) If an Indemnifying Party makes an indemnification payment to a
Claiming Party (or to any of its Other Indemnified Persons) with respect to
any Loss, then such Indemnifying Party will be subrogated, to the extent of
such payment, to all related rights and remedies of such Claiming Party (or,
if applicable, of such Other Indemnified Person) under any insurance policy
or otherwise against or with respect to such Loss, except with respect to
amounts that already have been netted against such Loss for purposes of
determining the indemnifiable amount of such Loss.

 

9.10 _Certain Disclaimers_. Notwithstanding any other term herein
and without limiting any other limitation herein, other than as expressly
made by Seller in _Article_ __ _ 3_ or the Company in _Article_ __ _ 4_,
neither Seller nor the Company has made (and no Person on behalf of any of
them has made) any representation or warranty or similar assurance (whether
direct or indirect, written or oral, or statutory, express or implied,
including any express or implied warranties of merchantability or of fitness
for an intended purpose), including in each case regarding (a) any
information or document given or made available to Buyer or any Person on
Buyers behalf regarding the Company, (b) the effect of any of the
transactions contemplated herein on the business of Buyer or the Company or
the reaction thereto of any Person or (c) any Forward-Looking Statement
(including any underlying assumption).

written or oral, or statutory, express or implied) of any Party regarding such

by a court of competent jurisdiction to be invalid, illegal or incapable of
being enforced, then all other terms of this Agreement will remain in full

valid, legal and enforceable to the maximum extent permitted by Applicable

10.10 _Disclosure Schedules_. Certain information may be contained in
the Schedules solely for informational purposes, may not be required to be
