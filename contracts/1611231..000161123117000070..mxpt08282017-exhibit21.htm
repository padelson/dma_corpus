2. The Offer. 

2.1 The Offer.

(a) Provided, that this Agreement shall not have terminated in accordance with
its terms and subject to there being no order, decree, judgment, injunction or
ruling of a Governmental Authority of competent jurisdiction enjoining,
restraining or otherwise prohibiting the commencement of the Offer and no Law
having been enacted, entered, enforced, promulgated, amended, issued or deemed
applicable to Parent, the Company or any subsidiary or affiliate thereof
having such effect, Purchaser shall (and Parent shall cause Purchaser to)
commence (within the meaning of Rule 14d-2 under the Exchange Act) the Offer
no later than ten (10) business days, after the date of this Agreement.
Following such launch, each of Parent and Purchaser shall use its reasonable
best efforts to consummate the Offer, subject to the terms and conditions
hereof.

(b) The obligation of Purchaser to accept for payment, purchase and pay for
any Company Shares validly tendered pursuant to the Offer (and not validly
withdrawn) shall be subject to the satisfaction or waiver pursuant to the
terms hereof of (x) the condition (the "Minimum Condition") that at least that
number of Company Shares validly tendered and not withdrawn and received by
the depositary of the Offer prior to the Expiration Time of the Offer (other
than Company Shares tendered by guaranteed delivery that have not yet been
"received," within the meaning of Section 251(h) of the DGCL, by the
depositary of the Offer), when added to any Company Shares already owned by
Parent or any of its controlled subsidiaries, if any, equal a majority of the
outstanding Company Shares as of the Expiration Time; and (y) the other
conditions set forth in Annex A hereto (the conditions described in clauses
(x) and (y) are collectively referred to as the "Tender Offer Conditions").
Purchaser expressly reserves the right (but shall not be obligated) at any
time or from time to time, in its sole discretion, to amend or waive any such
condition (other than the Minimum Condition which may not be amended or
waived), to increase the Per Share Amount payable in the Offer, and to make
any other changes in the terms and conditions of the Offer; provided, that
without the prior written consent of the Company no change may be made that
(i) decreases the Per Share Amount (except as provided in Section 2.1(i)),
(ii) changes the form of consideration payable in the Offer, (iii) imposes
conditions to the Offer in addition to the Tender Offer Conditions, (iv)
decreases the number of Company Shares sought to be purchased in the Offer,
(v) extends the Offer other than in a manner pursuant to and in accordance
with the terms of Section 2.1(d), or (vi) modifies or amends any condition to
the Offer in any manner that broadens such conditions, makes such conditions
more onerous or is adverse to the holders of Company Shares.

(c) Subject to the terms and conditions thereof, the Offer shall remain open
until one minute after 11:59 p.m., New York City time (the "Expiration Time"),
at the end of the twentieth (20th) business day beginning with (and including)
the date that the Offer is commenced (determined in accordance with Rule
14d-1(g)(3) and Rule 14e-1(a) under the Exchange Act) (the "Expiration Date"),
unless the period of time for which the Offer is open shall have been extended
pursuant to, and in accordance with, the provisions of Section 2.1(d) or as
required by applicable Laws or the interpretations of the SEC (in which event
the term "Expiration Time" shall mean the latest time, and the term
"Expiration Date" shall mean the latest date, as the Offer, as so extended,
may expire). 

(d) Notwithstanding the foregoing or anything to the contrary set forth in
this Agreement, unless this Agreement shall have been terminated in accordance
with Section 9.1, (i) Purchaser shall extend the Offer for any period required
by any rule, regulation, interpretation or position of the SEC or its staff or
the Nasdaq Stock Market that is applicable to the Offer; (ii) if, at the
initial Expiration Time or any subsequent time as of which the Offer is
scheduled to expire, any Tender Offer Condition is not satisfied and has not
been waived, then Purchaser shall extend (and re-extend) the Offer and its
expiration date beyond the initial Expiration Date or such subsequent date for
successive extension periods of up to ten (10) business days each; and (iii)
Purchaser may, upon written notice to the Company, extend the Offer for one or
more periods of not more than ten (10) business days each if, at any then
scheduled Expiration Date, (x) the Marketing Period has not expired or (y) the
full amount of proceeds of the Debt Financing have not been, or would not be,
received by Parent or Purchaser as of such Expiration Date (each such
extension period, an "Additional Offer Period"); provided, however, that
notwithstanding the foregoing clauses (i), (ii) and (iii) of this Section
2.1(d), (A) if, at the initial Expiration Time or the end of any Additional
Offer Period, all of the Tender Offer Conditions, except for the Minimum
Condition, are satisfied or have been waived, Purchaser shall only be required
to extend the Offer and its expiration date beyond the initial Expiration Date
or such subsequent date upon the request of the Company for one or more
additional periods of ten (10) business days each, not to exceed an aggregate
of thirty (30) business days, to permit the Minimum Condition to be satisfied,
(B) in no event shall Purchaser extend the Offer beyond the Outside Date and
(C) Purchaser shall not extend the Offer pursuant to clause (iii)(x) of this
Section 2.1(d) for more than one (1) business day after the date of expiration
of the Marketing Period; provided further, that this Section 2.1(d) shall not
be deemed to impair, limit or otherwise restrict in any manner the right of
Parent to terminate this Agreement pursuant to Section 9.1.

(e) Purchaser shall not terminate the Offer prior to any scheduled Expiration
Date without the prior written consent of the Company except in the event that
this Agreement is terminated pursuant to Section 9.1. Notwithstanding anything
to the contrary set forth in this Agreement, Purchaser shall not (and Parent
shall cause Purchaser not to) commence any "subsequent offering period" after
the Acceptance Date if the Merger can be effected pursuant to Section 251(h)
of the DGCL.

(f) In the event that this Agreement is terminated pursuant to Section 9.1,
Purchaser shall (and Parent shall cause Purchaser to) promptly (and in any
event within one (1) business day of such termination), irrevocably and
unconditionally terminate the Offer.

(g) The Per Share Amount shall, subject to applicable withholding of taxes, be
net to the applicable seller in cash without interest, upon the terms and
subject to the conditions of the Offer. Subject to the terms and conditions of
this Agreement, Purchaser or Parent on Purchaser's behalf shall accept for
payment no later than one (1) business day following the expiration of the
Offer (the time of the acceptance for payment, the "Acceptance Time", and the
date of the acceptance for payment, the "Acceptance Date") and pay for all
Company Shares validly tendered and not withdrawn promptly (and in no event
later than three (3) business days) following the expiration of the Offer;
provided, however, that without the prior written consent of the Company,
Purchaser shall not accept for payment or pay for any Company Shares if, as a
result, Purchaser 

would acquire less than the number of Company Shares necessary to satisfy the
Minimum Condition. If payment of the Per Share Amount is to be made to a
person other than the person in whose name the surrendered certificate
formerly evidencing Company Shares is registered on the stock transfer books
of the Company, it shall be a condition of payment that the certificate so
surrendered shall be endorsed properly or otherwise be in proper form for
transfer and that the person requesting such payment shall have paid all
transfer and other similar taxes required by reason of the payment of the Per
Share Amount to a person other than the registered holder of the certificate
surrendered, or shall have established to the satisfaction of Purchaser that
such taxes either have been paid or are not applicable.

(h) As promptly as reasonably practicable on the date of commencement of the
Offer, Purchaser shall file with the SEC a Tender Offer Statement on Schedule
TO (together with all amendments and supplements thereto, the "Schedule TO")
with respect to the Offer. The Schedule TO shall contain or shall incorporate
by reference an offer to purchase (the "Offer to Purchase") and form of the
related letter of transmittal and any other ancillary documents pursuant to
which the Offer will be made (the Schedule TO, the Offer to Purchase and such
other documents, together with all exhibits, supplements and amendments
thereto, being referred to herein collectively as the "Offer Documents").
Purchaser shall use its reasonable best efforts to cause the Offer Documents
to be disseminated to holders of Company Shares in all material respects to
the extent required by applicable federal securities laws. Parent and
Purchaser shall use their respective reasonable best efforts to cause the
Offer Documents to comply in all material respects with the applicable
requirements of federal securities laws. Parent, Purchaser and the Company
agree to correct promptly any information provided by any of them for use in
the Offer Documents that shall have become false or misleading in any material
respect, and Parent and Purchaser further agree to use reasonable best efforts
to cause the Schedule TO, as so corrected, to be filed with the SEC, and the
other Offer Documents, as so corrected, to be disseminated to holders of
Company Shares, in each case in all material respects as required by
applicable federal securities laws. The Company shall promptly furnish to
Purchaser or Parent all information concerning the Company that is required or
reasonably requested by Purchaser or Parent in connection with their
obligations relating to the Offer Documents or any action contemplated by this
Section 2.1(h). Parent and Purchaser shall give the Company and its counsel a
reasonable opportunity to review and comment on the Schedule TO before it is
filed with the SEC, and Parent and Purchaser shall give reasonable and good
faith consideration to any comments made by Company and its counsel. In
addition, Parent and Purchaser agree to (i) provide the Company and its
counsel in writing with any written comments Parent, Purchaser or their
counsel may receive from time to time from the SEC or its staff with respect
to the Offer Documents promptly after the receipt of such comments, (ii) use
reasonable best efforts to provide a reasonably detailed description of any
oral comments Parent, Purchaser or their counsel may receive from time to time
from the SEC or its staff with respect to the Offer Documents promptly after
the receipt of such comments, and (iii) unless there has been a Change in
Recommendation, provide the Company and its counsel reasonable opportunity to
review and comment on any written or oral response to such comments or any
proposed amendment to the Offer Documents prior to the filing thereof with the
SEC.

(i) If, between the date of this Agreement and the Acceptance Date, the
outstanding Company Shares are changed into a different number or class of
shares by reason of 

any stock split, division or subdivision of shares, stock dividend, reverse
stock split, consolidation of shares, reclassification, recapitalization or
similar transaction, then the Per Share Amount applicable to such Company
Share shall be adjusted to the extent appropriate to give the holders of
Company Shares the same economic effect as contemplated by this Agreement;
provided that nothing in this Section 2.1(i) shall be construed to permit the
Company to take any action with respect to the Company Shares that is
prohibited by this Agreement.

2.2 Company Action.

(a) The Company hereby consents to and approves the Offer pursuant to the
terms of this Agreement. The Company hereby further consents to the inclusion
in the Offer Documents of the Company Board Recommendation. The Company shall
not withdraw or modify such recommendation in any manner adverse to Purchaser
or Parent except as provided in Section 7.2(b).

(b) Promptly following the filing of the Schedule TO by Purchaser, the Company
shall file with the SEC a Solicitation/Recommendation Statement on Schedule
14D-9 (together with all amendments and supplements thereto, the "Schedule
14D-9") containing the recommendation of the Company Board described in
Section 4.4(b) (unless there has been a Change in Recommendation as permitted
by and in accordance with Section 7.2(b)). The Company shall cause the
Schedule 14D-9 to be filed with the SEC on the same day as the Schedule TO
shall be filed with the SEC. The Company shall promptly mail the Schedule
14D-9 to the holders of Company Shares together with the Offer Documents and
shall use its reasonable best efforts to cause the Offer Documents to be
disseminated in all material respects as required by applicable federal
securities laws. The Company shall use its reasonable best efforts to cause
the Schedule 14D-9 to comply in all material respects with the applicable
requirements of federal securities laws. The Company, Parent and Purchaser
agree to correct promptly any information provided by any of them for use in
the Schedule 14D-9 that shall have become false or misleading in any material
respect, and the Company further agrees to use its reasonable best efforts to
cause the Schedule 14D-9, as so corrected, to be filed with the SEC and
disseminated to holders of Company Shares, in each case in all material
respects as required by applicable U.S. federal securities laws. Parent or
Purchaser shall promptly furnish to the Company all information concerning
Parent and Purchaser that is required or reasonably requested by the Company
in connection with its obligations relating to the Schedule 14D-9. The Company
shall give Parent, Purchaser and their counsel a reasonable opportunity to
review and comment on the Schedule 14D-9 before it is filed with the SEC. In
addition, the Company agrees to (i) provide Parent, Purchaser and their
counsel in writing with any written comments the Company or its counsel may
receive from time to time from the SEC or its staff with respect to the
Schedule 14D-9 promptly after the receipt of such comments, (ii) use
reasonable best efforts to provide Parent, Purchaser and their counsel a
reasonably detailed description of any oral comments the Company or its
counsel may receive from time to time from the SEC or its staff with respect
to the Schedule 14D-9 promptly after the receipt of such comments, and (iii)
unless there has been a Change in Recommendation, provide Parent, Purchaser
and their counsel reasonable opportunity to review and comment on any written
or oral response to such comments or any proposed amendment to the Schedule
14D-9 prior to the filing thereof with the SEC. 

(c) In connection with the Offer, the Company shall promptly furnish or cause
to be furnished (including by instructing its transfer agent to promptly
furnish) to Purchaser such information as Purchaser may reasonably request in
order to disseminate or otherwise communicate the Offer to the record and
beneficial holders of Company Shares, including mailing labels containing the
names and addresses of all record holders of Company Shares and with security
position listings of Company Shares held in stock depositories, each as of a
recent date, together with all other available listings and computer files
containing names, addresses and security position listings of record holders
and non-objecting beneficial owners of Company Shares. The Company shall use
its reasonable best efforts to promptly furnish or cause to be furnished to
Purchaser such additional information, including updated listings and computer
files of stockholders, mailing labels and security position listings, and such
other assistance in disseminating the Offer Documents to holders of Company
Shares as Parent or Purchaser may reasonably request. Subject to the
requirements of Law, including applicable stock exchange rules, and except for
such steps as are necessary to disseminate the Offer Documents and any other
documents necessary to consummate the Offer or the Merger, Parent and
Purchaser shall hold in confidence the information contained in such labels,
listings and files and shall use such information only in connection with the
Transactions. If the Offer is terminated or if this Agreement shall be
terminated, Purchaser and Parent will promptly deliver to the Company, or
destroy, and cause their Representatives to deliver to the Company, or
destroy, all copies, summaries and extracts of such information then in their
possession or control in accordance with the Confidentiality Agreement.

being the "Effective Time"). 

3.3 Effect of the Merger. At the Effective Time, the effect of the Merger

Incorporation of Purchaser, as in effect immediately prior to the Effective
Time, until thereafter amended as provided by law and such certificate of
incorporation; provided, that such certificate of incorporation shall contain
such provisions as are necessary to give full effect to the exculpation and
indemnification provided for in Section 7.4 hereof.

(b) Unless otherwise determined by Parent prior to the Effective Time, the
bylaws of the Surviving Corporation shall be amended and restated at the
Effective Time to conform to the bylaws of Purchaser as in effect immediately
prior to the Effective Time, until thereafter amended as provided by Law, the
Certificate of Incorporation of the Surviving Corporation and such bylaws.

3.5 Directors and Officers. The directors of Purchaser immediately prior to
the Effective Time shall be the initial directors of the Surviving
Corporation, each to hold office in accordance with the certificate of
incorporation and bylaws of the Surviving Corporation, and, except as
determined by Parent or Purchaser prior to the Effective Time, the officers of
the Company immediately prior to the Effective Time shall be the initial
officers of the Surviving Corporation, in each case until their respective
successors are duly elected or appointed and qualified or until their earlier
death, resignation or removal.

3.6 Conversion of Securities. At the Effective Time, by virtue of the Merger
and without any action on the part of Purchaser, the Company or the holders of
any of the following securities:

(a) Each Company Share issued and outstanding immediately prior to the
Effective Time (other than any Company Shares to be canceled pursuant to
Section 3.6(b) and any Dissenting Company Shares) shall be canceled and shall
be converted automatically into the right to receive an amount in cash,
without interest, equal to the Per Share Amount (the "Merger Consideration")
payable to the holder of such Company Share, upon surrender, in the manner
provided in Section 3.9. If, between the date of this Agreement and the
Effective Time, the outstanding shares of Company Common Stock are changed
into a different number or class of shares by reason of any stock split,
division or subdivision of shares, stock dividend, reverse stock split,
consolidation of shares, reclassification, recapitalization or other similar
transaction, then the Merger Consideration shall be adjusted to the extent
appropriate to give the holders of Company Shares the same economic effect as
contemplated by this Agreement (taking into account any prior 

adjustments pursuant to Section 2.1(i)) for all purposes of this Article 3;
provided that nothing in this Section 3.6(a) shall be construed to permit the
Company to take any action with respect to the Company Shares that is
prohibited by this Agreement.

(b) Each Company Share held in the treasury of the Company and each Company
Share owned by Purchaser, Parent or any direct or indirect wholly owned
subsidiary of Parent immediately prior to the Effective Time shall be canceled
and retired without any conversion thereof, and no payment or distribution
shall be made and no consideration of any kind shall be delivered with respect
thereto.

(c) Each share of common stock of Purchaser issued and outstanding immediately
prior to the Effective Time shall be converted into and exchanged for one
validly issued, fully paid and non-assessable share of common stock of the
Surviving Corporation.

3.7 Company Stock Awards; ESPP.

(a) Effective immediately prior to the Effective Time, vesting acceleration
will apply to the following Company Stock Awards: (1) each unvested Company
Stock Option and Company RSU outstanding as of immediately prior to the
Effective Time that would have vested on or prior to December 31, 2017 in the
ordinary course, pursuant to its terms in effect as of the date hereof, will,
as of the Effective Time vest in full; and (2) each Company Stock Award held
by an employee who is not a Continuing Employee and who qualifies for vesting
acceleration under the Company Change in Control Policy will accelerate
pursuant to the terms of the Company Change in Control Policy (in each case as
of no later than as of immediately prior to the Effective Time).

(b) By virtue of the Merger and without any action on the part of Parent,
Purchaser, or the holders of Company Stock Options: (1) each outstanding
Company Stock Option (or any portion thereof), that is vested and outstanding
as of immediately prior to the Effective Time (after giving effect to any
applicable accelerated vesting of Company Stock Options pursuant to Section
3.7(a) above) shall be cancelled at the Effective Time and converted
automatically into the right to receive, as soon as reasonably practicable
after the Effective Time but no later than the second payroll date after the
Effective Time, an amount in cash determined by multiplying (x) the excess, if
any, of the Per Share Amount over the applicable exercise price of such option
by (y) the number of Company Shares subject to such vested Company Stock
Option, less all applicable deductions and withholdings required by law to be
withheld in respect of such payment; provided, however, that if the per share
exercise price of any such vested Company Stock Option is equal to or greater
than the Per Share Amount, such Company Stock Option shall be cancelled and
terminated as of the Effective Time without any cash payment being made in
respect thereof; and (2) each outstanding Company Stock Option (or any portion
thereof), that is unvested and outstanding as of immediately prior to the
Effective Time shall be cancelled and terminated as of the Effective Time
without any cash payment being made in respect thereof. Payments of the Merger
Consideration for vested Company Stock Options to employees and former
employees of the Company shall be remitted through the payroll system of the
Company or Parent (at Parent's election). Payments of the Merger Consideration
for Company Stock Options to non-employees shall be remitted through 

the Company's or Parent's accounts payable or (with the consent of the Paying
Agent) through the Paying Agent.

(c) By virtue of the Merger and without any action on the part of the Parent,
Purchaser, or the holders of Company RSUs, (1) each Company RSU (or any
portion thereof) that is vested and outstanding immediately prior to the
Effective Time (after giving effect to any applicable accelerated vesting of
Company RSUs pursuant to Section 3.7(a) above) shall be cancelled at the
Effective Time and converted automatically into the right to receive, as soon
as reasonably practicable after the Effective Time but no later than the
second payroll date after the Effective Time, (or, to the extent required in
order to avoid the holder becoming subject to any tax, penalty or interest
under Section 409A of the Code, the earliest payment date provided for in the
terms and conditions of the Company RSU) an amount in cash (without interest)
equal to (A) the Per Share Amount multiplied by (B) the number of shares of
Company Common Stock subject to each such vested Company RSU, less all
applicable deductions and withholdings required by Law to be withheld in
respect of such payment, and (2) each outstanding Company RSU (or any portion
thereof), that is unvested and outstanding as of immediately prior to the
Effective Time shall be cancelled and terminated as of the Effective Time
without any cash payment being made in respect thereof. If the payment for any
vested Company RSU cannot be made as soon as practicable after the Effective
Time without triggering any tax, penalty or interest under Section 409A of the
Code, the Company shall provide prior to the Effective Time the Parent with a
written schedule specifically identifying the applicable payment date for each
such vested Company RSU that complies with the payment rules under Section
409A of the Code. Payments of the Merger Consideration for vested Company RSUs
to employees and former employees of the Company shall be remitted through the
payroll system of the Company or Parent (at Parent's election). Payments of
the Merger Consideration for vested Company RSUs to non-employees shall be
remitted through the Company's or Parent's accounts payable or (with the
consent of the Paying Agent) through the Paying Agent.

(d) ESPP. Promptly following the date of this Agreement, the Company Board (or
if applicable, any committee thereof administering the ESPP) shall adopt such
resolutions or take such other necessary actions to provide that, (i) with
respect to any outstanding "Offering Period" (as defined in Section 15(l) of
the ESPP) under the ESPP as of the date of this Agreement (A) no participant
in the ESPP may increase the amount of his or her payroll deduction election
from that in effect on the date of this Agreement; (B) no new participants may
participate in the ESPP from those currently participating on the date of this
Agreement; (ii) no new Offering Period shall be commenced under the ESPP prior
to the Effective Time; (iii) immediately prior to the Effective Time, any
Offering Periods under the ESPP that do not end prior to the Effective Time
shall terminate, and, a new Purchase Date (as defined in Section 15(q) of the
ESPP) for each such Offering Period will be set immediately prior to the
Effective Time; and (iv) immediately prior to, and subject to the occurrence
of the Effective Time, the ESPP shall terminate.

(e) Prior to the Effective Time, the Company shall to the extent and in the
manner required by the applicable Company Stock Plan provide notice (in a form
reasonably satisfactory to Parent) to each holder of an outstanding Company
Stock Award granted pursuant to any Company Stock Plan describing the
treatment of such award in accordance with this Section 3.7. Prior to the
Effective Time, the Company shall take (or cause there to be taken, as the
case may 

be) such actions, shall obtain such consents, adopt (or cause there to be
adopted) any amendments of any Company Stock Plan and any awards thereunder,
in each case as may be necessary to effect the transactions contemplated by
this Section 3.7.

3.8 Dissenting Shares.

(a) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary set forth in this Agreement, all
Company Shares that are issued and outstanding immediately prior to the
Effective Time and held by the stockholders of the Company who shall have
neither voted in favor of the Merger nor consented thereto in writing and who
shall have properly and validly perfected their statutory rights of appraisal
in respect of such Company Shares in accordance with Section 262 of the DGCL
(collectively, "Dissenting Company Shares") shall not be converted into, or
represent the right to receive, the Merger Consideration and shall instead
only be entitled to such rights as are granted to a holder of Dissenting
Company Shares by the DGCL. All Dissenting Company Shares held by the
stockholders of the Company who shall have failed to perfect or who shall have
effectively withdrawn or lost their rights to appraisal of such Dissenting
Company Shares under such Section 262 of the DGCL shall no longer be
considered to be Dissenting Company Shares and shall thereupon be deemed to
have been converted into, and to have become exchangeable for, as of the
Effective Time, the right to receive the Merger Consideration, without
interest thereon, upon surrender of the certificate or certificates that
formerly evidenced such Company Shares in the manner provided in Section 3.9.

(b) The Company shall give Parent (A) prompt notice of any demands for
appraisal received by the Company, withdrawals of such demands, and any other
instruments served pursuant to Delaware Law and received by the Company in
respect of Dissenting Company Shares and (B) the opportunity to direct all
negotiations and proceedings with respect to demands for appraisal under
Delaware Law in respect of Dissenting Company Shares. The Company shall not,
except with the prior written consent of Parent, make any payment with respect
to any demands for appraisal, or settle or offer to settle any such demands
for payment, in respect of Dissenting Company Shares.

3.9 Surrender of Company Shares; Stock Transfer Books.

(a) Prior to the Effective Time, Parent shall enter into an agreement with
such person as may be designated by Parent and reasonably acceptable to the
Company (the "Paying Agent"), which shall provide for the payment by the
Paying Agent of the amounts payable under Section 3.6(a) in accordance with
the terms of this Section 3.9. Promptly after the Effective Time, Parent or
Purchaser shall deposit, or cause to be deposited, with the Paying Agent the
aggregate amount payable pursuant to Section 3.6(a) (the "Exchange Fund"). The
Exchange Fund shall not be used for any other purpose. The Exchange Fund
shall, pending its disbursement to holders of shares of Company Common Stock,
be invested by the Paying Agent as directed by Parent. No investment of the
Exchange Fund shall relieve Parent, the Surviving Corporation or the Paying
Agent from making the payments required by this Article 3, and to the extent
that there are net losses with respect to any such investment, Parent shall
promptly provide additional funds to the Paying Agent for the benefit of the
applicable holders of Company Common Stock immediately prior to the Effective
Time in the amount of such net losses, which additional funds shall be deemed 

to be part of the Exchange Fund. No investment of the Exchange Fund shall have
maturities that could prevent or delay payments to be made pursuant to this
Agreement. Any net profit resulting from, or interest or income produced by,
such amounts on deposit with the Paying Agent will be payable to Parent. The
Surviving Corporation shall bear and pay all charges and expenses, including
those of the Paying Agent, incurred in connection with the payment of funds to
holders of Company Shares.

(b) Promptly after the Effective Time, Parent and the Surviving Corporation
shall cause the Paying Agent to mail to each holder of record of certificates
representing shares of Company Common Stock (the "Certificates") and to each
holder of record of book-entry shares representing shares of Company Common
Stock (the "Book-Entry Shares"), in each case whose shares were converted into
the right to receive the Merger Consideration pursuant to Section 3.6(a), (i)
a letter of transmittal which shall specify that delivery shall be effected,
and risk of loss and title to the Certificates shall pass, only upon proper
delivery of the Certificates to the Paying Agent and which shall be in such
form and have such other provisions as Parent may reasonably specify and (ii)
instructions for use in surrendering the Certificates or Book-Entry Shares in
exchange for the Merger Consideration payable with respect thereto. Upon
surrender to the Paying Agent of a Certificate for cancellation, together with
a duly completed and validly executed letter of transmittal or receipt of an
"agent's message" by the Paying Agent (or such other evidence, if any, of
transfer as the Paying Agent may reasonably request) in the case of Book-Entry
Shares, the holder of such Certificate or Book-Entry Shares shall receive in
exchange therefor the amount of cash which the shares of Company Common Stock
theretofore represented by such Certificate or book-entry entitle such holder
to receive pursuant to the provisions of this Article 3 and the Certificate or
Book-Entry Shares so surrendered shall forthwith be canceled. Until so
surrendered or transferred, as the case may be, each such Certificate or Book-
Entry Share shall represent after the Effective Time for all purposes only the
right to receive the Merger Consideration. No interest shall be paid or shall
accrue on any cash payable to holders of Certificates or Book-Entry Shares
pursuant to the provisions of this Article 3. In the event of a transfer of
ownership of Company Common Stock that is not registered in the transfer
records of the Company, payment may be made to a person other than the person
in whose name the Certificate or Book-Entry Shares so surrendered are
registered if such Certificate shall be properly endorsed or otherwise be in
proper form for transfer or such Book-Entry Shares shall be properly
transferred and the person requesting such issuance shall pay any transfer or
other Taxes required by reason of the payment to a person other than the
registered holder of such Certificate or Book-Entry Shares or establish to the
satisfaction of Parent that such Tax has been paid or is not applicable.

(c) The Merger Consideration paid upon the surrender for exchange of
Certificates and Book-Entry Shares in accordance with the terms of this
Article 3 shall be deemed to have been paid in full satisfaction of all rights
pertaining to the shares of Company Common Stock theretofore represented by
such Certificates or book entries, and, after the Effective Time, there shall
be no further registration of transfers on the stock transfer books of the
Company of the shares of Company Common Stock which were outstanding
immediately prior to the Effective Time. If, after the Effective Time,
Certificates or Book-Entry Shares are presented to the Surviving Corporation
or the Paying Agent for any reason, they shall be canceled and exchanged as
provided in this Article 3, except as otherwise provided by applicable law. 

(d) Any portion of the Exchange Fund which remains undistributed to the
holders of Certificates or Book-Entry Shares for six (6) months after the
Effective Time shall be delivered to Parent or one of its affiliates, upon
demand, and any holders of Certificates or Book-Entry Shares who have not
theretofore complied with this Article 3 shall thereafter look only to the
Surviving Corporation and Parent (subject to abandoned property, escheat or
similar laws, and solely as general creditors thereof) for payment of their
claim for Merger Consideration, without any interest thereon.

(e) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary, none of Parent, Purchaser, the
Company, the Surviving Corporation or the Paying Agent shall be liable to any
person in respect of any amount paid to a public official pursuant to any
applicable abandoned property, escheat or similar law. If any Certificate or
Book-Entry Share shall not have been surrendered prior to the earlier of (i)
two years after the Effective Time and (ii) immediately prior to the date on
which the Merger Consideration payable with respect to the shares of Company
Common Stock represented by such Certificate or book entry pursuant to this
Article 3 would otherwise escheat to or become the property of any
Governmental Authority, then any such Merger Consideration shall, to the
extent permitted by applicable law, become the property of the Surviving
Corporation, free and clear of all claims or interest of any person previously
entitled thereto.

(f) If any Certificate shall have been lost, stolen or destroyed, upon the
making of an affidavit of that fact by the person claiming such Certificate to
be lost, stolen or destroyed and, if required by Parent, the posting by such
person of a bond in such reasonable amount as Paying Agent may direct
(consistent with its historical practices) as indemnity against any claim that
may be made against it with respect to such Certificate, the Paying Agent
shall, subject to such person's compliance with the exchange procedures set
forth in Section 3.9(b) (other than the surrender of a Certificate), issue in
exchange for such lost, stolen or destroyed Certificate the Merger
Consideration payable with respect to the shares of Company Common Stock
represented by such Certificate in accordance with this Article 3.

3.10 Withholding Rights. Each of Purchaser, Parent, the Surviving Corporation
or the Paying Agent shall be entitled to deduct and withhold from the
consideration otherwise payable pursuant to Article 2 or 3 of, or any other
payments made in connection with this Agreement to any holder of Company
Shares, Company Stock Options and Company RSUs or any other recipient pursuant
to this Agreement such amounts as are required to be deducted and withheld
with respect to the making of such payment under the Internal Revenue Code of
1986, as amended (the "Code") and the Treasury regulations promulgated
thereunder (the "Treasury Regulations"), or any provision of state, local or
foreign Tax law. To the extent that amounts are so deducted and withheld, and
timely paid over to the appropriate Governmental Authority, such withheld
amounts shall be treated for all purposes of this Agreement as having been
paid to person in respect of which such deduction and withholding was made.

3.11 Additional Actions. If, at any time after the Effective Time, the
Surviving Corporation shall consider or be advised that any further deeds,
assignments or assurances in law or any other acts are necessary or desirable
to (i) vest, perfect or confirm, of record or otherwise, in the Surviving
Corporation its right, title or interest in, to or under any of the rights,
properties or 

assets of the Company or (ii) otherwise carry out the provisions of this
Agreement, the Company and its officers and directors shall be deemed to have
granted to the Surviving Corporation an irrevocable power of attorney to
execute and deliver all such deeds, assignments or assurances in law and to
take all acts necessary, proper or desirable to vest, perfect or confirm title
to and possession of such rights, properties or assets in the Surviving
Corporation and otherwise to carry out the provisions of this Agreement, and
the officers and directors of the Surviving Corporation are authorized in the
name of the Company or otherwise to take any and all such action.

4. Representations and Warranties of the Company.

Except as disclosed in the disclosure schedule of even date herewith delivered
by the Company to Parent and Purchaser prior to the execution and delivery of
this Agreement and referring by section or sub-section number to the
representations and warranties in this Agreement (the "Disclosure Schedule"),

disclosed for each other Section of this Agreement to the extent the relevance
of such disclosure to such other section of this Agreement is reasonably
apparent from the text of such disclosure) and except as disclosed in the SEC
Reports filed by the Company with, or furnished by the Company to, the SEC and
publicly available at least one (1) business day prior to the date of this

reasonably expected to have, a Material Adverse Effect. The Company is duly
qualified and/or licensed as a foreign corporation to do business, and is in
good standing, in each jurisdiction where the character of the properties and
assets owned, leased or operated by it or the nature of its business makes

being conducted and is duly qualified and/or licensed as a foreign corporation
to do business in each jurisdiction where the character of the properties and

now being conducted makes such qualification and/or licensing necessary,

standing, individually or in the aggregate, has 

not had, and would not be reasonably expected to have, a Material Adverse
Effect. There are no agreements requiring the Company or any Company
Subsidiary to make contributions to the capital of, or lend or advance funds
to, any Company Subsidiary.

(c) Except as set forth on Section 4.1(a) of the Disclosure Schedule, the

party or by which it is bound. The Company is not a party to any Contract that
obligates it to repurchase, redeem or otherwise acquire any Company
Securities. As of the date of this Agreement, there are no accrued and unpaid
dividends with respect to any outstanding shares of Company capital stock.

(d) All Company Shares subject to issuance, upon issuance on the terms and
conditions specified in the instruments pursuant to which they are issuable,
will be duly authorized, validly issued, fully paid and non-assessable and
free of any preemptive rights created by the Certificate of Incorporation or

There are no voting trusts or other Contracts to which the Company or any
Company Subsidiary is a party with respect to the voting of any capital stock

(e) As of the date of this Agreement, there are no outstanding contractual

exercise price settlements upon the exercise of Company Stock Options or

nonassessable and was issued free of any preemptive rights created by the
organizational documents of such Company Subsidiary or any Contract to which
such Company Subsidiary is a party or is otherwise bound, and each such share
is owned by the Company or another Company Subsidiary free and clear of all
Liens (other than Permitted Liens) or Contracts or other limitations on the
Company's or any Company Subsidiary's voting rights. Since the Measurement
Date, other than with respect to the Company Securities described in Section
4.3(b) of the Disclosure Schedule, neither the Company nor any Company
Subsidiary has authorized the creation or issuance of, or issued, or
authorized or effected any split-up or any other recapitalization of, any of
its capital stock, or directly or indirectly redeemed, purchased or otherwise
acquired any Company Securities. Except for equity interests in the Company
Subsidiaries, the Company does not own, directly or indirectly, any capital
stock and/or other ownership interest in any person. Each Company Stock
Option, Company RSU, and any other Company Stock Award that is unvested as of

Plan and all other applicable Law. The Company has made available to Parent or

(including all Company Stock Plans) (and any agreements that vary from such
forms).

4.4 Authority Relative to this Agreement.

(a) The Company has all necessary corporate power and authority to enter into
and deliver this Agreement and all other certificates, agreements and
documents expressly referred to herein (each a "Transaction Document") to
which it is a party, to perform its obligations hereunder and thereunder and
to consummate the Transactions. The execution, delivery and performance of
this Agreement and the Transaction Documents to which it is a party, by the
Company and the consummation by the Company of the Transactions have been duly
and validly authorized by all necessary corporate action, and no other
corporate proceedings on the part of the Company 

are necessary to authorize this Agreement or to consummate the Transactions
(other than, with respect to the Merger, the filing and recordation of an
appropriate certificate of merger as required by the DGCL). This Agreement has
been duly and validly executed and delivered by the Company and, assuming the
due authorization, execution and delivery by Parent and Purchaser, constitutes
a legal, valid and binding obligation of the Company, enforceable against the
Company in accordance with its terms, subject to (i) applicable bankruptcy,
insolvency, reorganization, moratorium or other similar laws, now or hereafter
in effect, affecting creditors' rights generally and (ii) general principles
of equity governing the availability of equitable remedies. For clarity,
notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, the term "Transaction
Document" shall in no event include the restrictive covenant agreements in the
form attached as Annex C.

(b) The Company Board, at a meeting duly called and held on August 26, 2017,
which has not been rescinded or modified, at which all of the directors of the
Company were present (i) determined that this Agreement and the Transaction
Documents to which it is a party and the transactions contemplated hereby and
thereby, including each of the Offer and the Merger (collectively, the
"Transactions"), are advisable, fair to, and in the best interests of the
Company and holders of Company Shares, (ii) based on written representations
and warranties made by Parent and Purchaser, determined that neither Parent
nor Purchaser is an "interested stockholder" as defined in Section 203(c) of
the DGCL, (iii) approved the execution, delivery and performance of this
Agreement and the Transaction Documents to which it is a party and the
Transactions (including that this Agreement and the Merger shall be governed
by and effected under Section 251(h) of the DGCL), and (iv) recommended that
the holders of Company Shares accept the Offer and tender Company Shares to
Purchaser pursuant to the Offer (clauses (i) to (iv), the "Company Board
Recommendation").

(c) The Company has taken all action necessary to ensure that all payments to
be made and benefits to be granted to any Company employee in connection with
the Transactions pursuant to any employment, compensation, severance,
retention or other employee benefit arrangements created by the Company or any
Company Subsidiary as of the date of this Agreement have been approved as
contemplated by Rule 14d-10 of the Exchange Act for the purpose of satisfying
the requirements of the non-exclusive safe harbor set forth in paragraph (d)
of such rule.

(d) A majority of the outstanding Company Shares equals at least such
percentage of the Company Shares that (absent Section 251(h) of the DGCL)

acceleration, or cancellation of, or result in the creation of a Lien on any
property or asset owned by the Company or any Company Subsidiary pursuant to
the terms, conditions or provisions of, or result in the loss of a material
benefit under any Company Material Contract, Lease or material Permit, to
which the Company or any Company Subsidiary is a party or under and by which
the Company or any Company Subsidiary is bound, except, with respect to
clauses (ii) and (iii), for any such conflicts, violations, breaches, defaults

reasonably be expected to prevent or materially delay beyond the Outside Date
the consummation of the Offer or the Merger and (y) has not had, and would not
be reasonably expected to have, a Material Adverse Effect.

(b) The execution and delivery of this Agreement and the Transaction Documents
to which it is a party by the Company does not, and the performance of this
Agreement and the Transaction Documents to which it is a party by the Company

any, of the Exchange Act and state securities or "blue sky" laws ("Blue Sky
Laws"), (x) any required pre-merger notification under the Hart-Scott-Rodino

and any associated consents, approvals, authorizations, waiting period
terminations, or permits, and (y) filing of an appropriate certificate of
merger as required by the DGCL, and (z) applicable requirements of the rules
of the Nasdaq Stock Market LLC (collectively, the "Company Required
Approvals") and (ii) where the failure to obtain such consents, approvals,
waiting period expirations or terminations, authorizations or permits, or to
make such filings or notifications, individually or in the aggregate, (x)
would not reasonably be expected to prevent or materially delay beyond the
Outside Date the consummation of the Offer or the Merger and (y) has not had,
and would not be reasonably expected to have, a Material Adverse Effect.

4.6 Permits; Compliance. Each of the Company and the Company Subsidiaries has
all requisite power and authority under and is in possession of all
franchises, grants, authorizations, licenses, permits, easements, variances,
exceptions, consents, certificates, certifications, approvals and orders of
any Governmental Authority of competent jurisdiction, as required under
applicable Law, including with respect to any Environmental Laws, necessary
for each of the Company or the Company Subsidiaries to own, lease and operate
its properties and assets or to carry on its business as it is now being
conducted (the "Permits"), except where the failure to have, or the suspension
or cancellation of, any of the Permits, individually or in the aggregate, (x)
would not reasonably be expected to prevent or delay beyond the Outside Date
the 

consummation of the Offer or the Merger and (y) has not had, and would not be
reasonably expected to have, a Material Adverse Effect. Since January 1, 2014,
there has been no suspension or cancellation of any of the Permits and to the
knowledge of the Company, there is no such suspension or cancellation
threatened in writing, and there have occurred no defaults under, violations
of, or events giving rise to a right of revocation, withdrawal, suspension,
termination, amendment or cancellation of any such Permits (with or without

effect, in each case, except as, individually or in the aggregate, (x) would
not reasonably be expected to prevent or delay beyond the Outside Date the
consummation of the Offer or the Merger and (y) has not had, and would not be
reasonably expected to have, a Material Adverse Effect. Neither the Company
nor any Company Subsidiary is, and, since January 31, 2014, neither the
Company nor any Company Subsidiary has been, in conflict with, or in default,
breach or violation of, any Law applicable to the Company or any Company
Subsidiary or by which any property or asset of the Company or any Company
Subsidiary is bound or affected, or any Permit to which the Company or any
Company Subsidiary is a party or by which the Company or any Company
Subsidiary or any property or asset of the Company or any Company Subsidiary
is bound, except for any such conflicts, defaults, breaches or violations
that, individually or in the aggregate, (x) would not reasonably be expected
to prevent or delay beyond the Outside Date the consummation of the Offer or
the Merger and (y) has not been, and would not be reasonably expected to be,
material to the Company and Company Subsidiaries, taken as a whole. As of the
date of this Agreement, neither the Company nor any of the Company
Subsidiaries has received any written notice from any Governmental Authority
of competent jurisdiction alleging any violation, investigation or that it is
not in compliance with any Law, except where such non-compliance, individually
or in the aggregate, (x) would not reasonably be expected to prevent or delay
beyond the Outside Date the consummation of the Offer or the Merger and (y)
has not been and is not reasonably expected to be material to the Company and
the Company Subsidiaries, taken as a whole. For clarity, notwithstanding the
foregoing, for all purposes of this Agreement, the Company does not make any
representation or warranty (pursuant to this Section 4.6 or elsewhere in this
Agreement) regarding the effect of the applicable antitrust, merger control,
competition, or fair trade laws on its ability to execute, deliver, or perform
its obligations under the Agreement or to consummate the transactions
described in this Agreement as a result of the enactment, promulgation,
application, or threatened or actual judicial or administrative investigation
or litigation under, or enforcement of, any antitrust, merger control,
competition, or fair trade law with respect to the consummation of the
Transactions.

(a) The Company has filed with the SEC all forms, reports, schedules,
registration statements, definitive proxy statements and other documents
required to be filed or furnished by it with the SEC since the IPO Date (such

SEC subsequent to the date of this Agreement, if any, including any amendments
and exhibits thereof, the "SEC Reports"). Each SEC Report (x) complied, or if

be, and the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 ("SOX") and the applicable rules and
regulations promulgated thereunder, and (y) did not, at the time it was filed 

(or, if amended prior to the date hereof, as of the date of such amendment),
contain, or if filed after the date hereof at the time of the filing will not
contain, any untrue statement of a material fact or omitted to state any
material fact required to be stated therein or necessary in order to make the

any form, report or other document with the SEC.

(b) (i) Each of the audited consolidated financial statements contained in the
SEC Reports (including, in each case, any related notes and schedules thereto)

all material respects with applicable accounting requirements and published
rules and regulations of the SEC with respect thereto, (C) was, or will be, as
the case may be, prepared in accordance with U.S. generally accepted
accounting principles ("GAAP") applied on a consistent basis throughout the

respective dates thereof and for the respective periods indicated therein.
(ii) The unaudited financial information contained in the SEC Reports (such

accordance with and accurately reflect the books and records of the Company
and its consolidated Company Subsidiaries in all material respects, (B) was

Act), and (C) fairly presents, in all material respects the consolidated
financial position and results of operations of the Company and its
consolidated Company Subsidiaries as at the respective dates thereof and for
the respective periods indicated therein (subject to normal and recurring
year-end adjustments).

(c) Except as and to the extent set forth on the consolidated balance sheet of
the Company and its consolidated Company Subsidiaries as of June 30, 2017,
including the notes thereto (the "Company Balance Sheet"), neither the Company
nor any Company Subsidiary has any liability or obligation of a nature
required by GAAP to be disclosed on a consolidated balance sheet of the
Company, except for liabilities and obligations (x) incurred since the date of
the Company Balance Sheet in the ordinary course of business consistent with
past practice, (y) that have not had , and would not reasonably be expected to

and the principal financial officer of the Company (and each former principal
executive officer of the Company and each former principal financial officer
of the Company, as applicable) has made all certifications required by Rule
13a-14 or 15d-14 under the Exchange Act or Sections 302 and 906 of SOX and any
related rules and regulations promulgated by the SEC, and 

the statements contained in such certifications are complete, true and
correct. For purposes of this Section 4.7(d), "principal executive officer"
and "principal financial officer" shall have the meanings given to such terms
in SOX. Neither the Company nor any of the Company Subsidiaries has
outstanding, or has arranged any outstanding, "extensions of credit" to
directors or executive officers within the meaning of Section 402 of SOX. The
Company is in compliance in all material respects with SOX.

(e) Neither the Company nor any of the Company Subsidiaries is a party to, or
has any commitment to become a party to, any joint venture, off-balance sheet
partnership or any similar contract or arrangement (including any contract or
arrangement relating to any transaction or relationship between or among the
Company and any of the Company Subsidiaries, on the one hand, and any
unconsolidated affiliate of any of them, including any structured finance,
special purpose or limited purpose entity or person, on the other hand, or any
"off-balance sheet arrangements" (as defined in Item 303(a) of Regulation S-K
of the Exchange Act)), where the result, purpose or effect of such contract or
arrangement is to avoid disclosure of any material transaction involving, or
material liabilities of, the Company or any of the Company Subsidiaries in the
Company's or such Company Subsidiary's published financial statements or other
SEC Reports.

(f) The Company maintains a system of internal controls over financial
reporting (as defined in Rules 13a-15(f) and 15d-15(f) under the Exchange
Act), which is sufficient in all material respects to provide reasonable
assurances regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the
preparation of financial statements for external purposes, including to
provide reasonable assurance that: (i) transactions are executed in accordance
with management's general or specific authorizations; (ii) transactions are
recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in
conformity with GAAP and to maintain asset accountability; (iii) access to,
acquisition, use or disposition of assets that could have a material effect on
the Company's financial statements is permitted only in accordance with
management's general or specific authorization; and (iv) the recorded
accountability for assets is compared with the existing assets at reasonable
intervals and appropriate action is taken with respect to any differences.

(g) The Company has in place "disclosure controls and procedures" (as defined
in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) of the Exchange Act) that are designed to
ensure that all information that is required to be disclosed by the Company in
the reports that it files or submits under the Exchange Act is recorded,
processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in the
SEC's rules and forms and is accumulated and communicated to its principal
executive officer and principal financial officer as appropriate to allow
timely decisions regarding required disclosure and to make the certifications
of the principal executive officer and principal financial officer of the
Company required under the Exchange Act with respect to such reports.

(h) The Company has made available to Parent copies of all comment letters
received by the Company from the SEC since the IPO Date to the date of this
Agreement, relating to the Company's SEC Reports and all responses of the
Company thereto. As of the date of this Agreement, there are no outstanding or
unresolved issues with respect to the Company or the SEC Reports noted in
comment letters or other correspondence received by the Company or its
attorneys from the SEC, and there are no pending (i) formal or, to the
knowledge of the Company, 

informal investigations of the Company or the SEC Reports by the SEC or (ii)
inspection of an audit of the Company's financial statements by the Public
Company Accounting Oversight Board.

(i) Except as set forth in Section 4.7(i) of the Disclosure Schedule, since
the IPO Date, there has been no material complaint, allegation, assertion or
claim that the Company or any Company Subsidiary has engaged in improper or
illegal accounting or auditing practices or maintains improper or inadequate
internal accounting controls. Since the IPO Date, the Company has not
identified (i) to the knowledge of the Company, any material weakness or
significant deficiencies in the design or operation of internal control over
financial reporting which is reasonably expected to adversely affect the
Company's ability to record, process, summarize and report financial
information or (ii) any fraud or allegation of fraud, whether or not material,
that involves management or other employees who have a significant role in the
Company's internal control over financial reporting. Since the IPO Date, no
current or former attorney representing the Company or any of the Company
Subsidiaries has reported evidence of a material violation of securities laws,
breach of fiduciary duty or similar violation by the Company or any of its
officers, directors, employees or agents to the Company Board or any committee
thereof or to any director or executive officer of the Company.

4.8 Absence of Material Adverse Effect and Certain Changes or Events.

(a) Since the date of the Company Balance Sheet to the date of this Agreement,
the Company and the Company Subsidiaries have conducted their businesses in
the ordinary course of business consistent with past practice in all material
respects.

(b) Since the date of the Company Balance Sheet to the date of this Agreement
(i) there has not been any Effect that has had, or that would reasonably be
expected to have, individually or in the aggregate, a Material Adverse Effect,
and (ii) none of the Company or any of the Company Subsidiaries has taken any
action that if taken between the date hereof and the Effective Time would be
prohibited by Section 6.1.

4.9 Absence of Litigation; Investigations. Except as set forth in Section 4.9
of the Disclosure Schedule, there is and since January 31, 2014 has been (i)
no Action pending, or to the knowledge of the Company, threatened, against the
Company or any Company Subsidiary, any property or asset of the Company or any
Company Subsidiary, or any of the Company's directors, officers or employees
in such capacity and (ii) no judgment of any Governmental Authority or
arbitrator outstanding against the Company, any of the Company Subsidiaries or
any of the Company's directors, officers or employees in such capacity, that
in each case, (A) would reasonably be expected to prevent or materially delay
beyond the Outside Date the consummation of the Transactions or (B) has had,
or would reasonably be expected to have, individually or in the aggregate, a
Material Adverse Effect. Since January 31, 2014 to the date of this Agreement,
neither the Company nor any Company Subsidiary, nor any property or asset of
the Company or any Company Subsidiary, nor any of the Company's directors,
officers or employees in such capacity has been subject to any consent decree,
settlement agreement or similar written agreement between the Company and any
Governmental Authority of competent jurisdiction, or any order, writ,
judgment, injunction, decree, determination or award of any Governmental
Authority of competent jurisdiction, in each case, individually or in the
aggregate, that (x) would reasonably be expected 

to prevent or materially delay beyond the Outside Date the consummation of the
Offer or the Merger or (y) has been, or would be reasonably expected to be,
material to the Company and Company Subsidiaries, taken as a whole.

4.10 Employee Benefit Plans.

(a) Section 4.10(a) of the Disclosure Schedule lists material Company Benefit
Plans as of the date of this Agreement; provided, however, that for purposes
of Schedule 4.10(a), the Company shall not be required to schedule any
standard offer letters for employment that are terminable at will and without
material cost or liability to the Company or the Company Subsidiaries with
respect to employees with annual compensation of less than $300,000. "Company
Benefit Plans" shall mean: (i) each employee benefit plan (as defined in
Section 3(3) of the Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974, as
amended ("ERISA") regardless of whether such plan is subject to ERISA) and
each other employee benefit plan, policy or agreement, including all bonus,
stock option, stock purchase, restricted stock, incentive, deferred
compensation, retiree medical or life insurance, supplemental retirement,
severance or other material benefit plans, programs or arrangements, and all
employment, termination or severance Contracts to which the Company or any
ERISA Affiliate is a party, with respect to which the Company or any ERISA
Affiliate has or could have any liability or obligation or that are
maintained, contributed to or sponsored by the Company or any ERISA Affiliate
for the benefit of any current or former employee, officer or director of the
Company or any ERISA Affiliate, (ii) each employee benefit plan for which the
Company or any Company Subsidiary could incur liability under Section 4069 of
ERISA in the event such plan has been or were to be terminated, and (iii) any
plan in respect of which the Company or any Company Subsidiary could incur
liability under Section 4212(c) of ERISA (all Company Benefit Plans, excluding
Company Benefit Plans not subject to U.S. Law, the "US Benefit Plans"). The
Company has made available to Purchaser a true and complete copy of each
Company Benefit Plan and has made available to Purchaser a true and complete
copy of each material document, if any, prepared in connection with each such
Company Benefit Plan (except for individual written Company Stock Option and
Company RSU agreements, in which case only forms of such agreements have been
made available, unless such individual agreements materially differ from such
forms), including as applicable (i) a copy of each trust or other funding
arrangement, (ii) the most recent summary plan description and summary of
material modifications, (iii) annual reports on Internal Revenue Service
("IRS") Form 5500 for the most recent two (2) plan years, (iv) the most
recently received IRS determination, opinion, notification or advisory letter
for each such Company Benefit Plan, (v) the most recently prepared actuarial
report and financial statement in connection with each such Company Benefit
Plan and (vi) copies of material notices, letters or other correspondence from
the Internal Revenue Service, Department of Labor, Pension Benefit Guaranty
Corporation or other Governmental Authority, addressing any matter involving
actual or potential material liability relating to a Company Benefit Plan.
Neither the Company nor any Company Subsidiary has any express or implied
commitment (i) to create, incur liability with respect to or cause to exist
any other material employee benefit plan, program or arrangement, (ii) to
enter into any Contract to provide compensation or benefits to any individual
other than in the ordinary course of business, or (iii) to modify, change or
terminate any Company Benefit Plan, other than with respect to a modification,
change or termination required by ERISA, the Code or other applicable law. 

(b) Neither the Company, any Company Subsidiary nor any ERISA Affiliate
sponsors, maintains, contributes to or has any liability, including any
contingent liability, with respect to, (i) a multiemployer plan (within the
meaning of Section 3(37) or 4001(a)(3) of ERISA) (a "Multiemployer Plan"),
(ii) a "multiple employer plan" (within the meaning of Section 413(c) of the
Code) (a "Multiple Employer Plan"), (iii) a "multiple employer welfare
arrangement" (within the meaning of Section 3(40) of ERISA) or, (iv), a plan
that is subject to Title IV of ERISA or Section 412 of the Code or Section 302
of ERISA.

(c) Except as set forth in Section 4.10(c) of the Disclosure Schedule, none of
the Company Benefit Plans (i) provides for the payment of separation,
severance, termination or similar-type benefits to any person, (ii) obligates
the Company or any Company Subsidiary to pay separation, severance,
termination or similar-type benefits solely or partially as a result of the
execution and delivery of this Agreement or consummation of any Transaction
(either alone or in conjunction with any other event) or (iii) obligates the
Company or any Company Subsidiary to make any payment or provide any benefit
in connection with a "change in ownership or effective control", within the
meaning of such term under Section 280G of the Code, or in connection with an
event directly or indirectly related to such a change. None of the Company
Benefit Plans provides for or promises post-employment medical, disability or
life insurance benefits to any current or former employee, officer or director
of the Company or any Company Subsidiary, except as required by Section 4980B
of the Code, Part 6 of Title I of ERISA or similar applicable state law. There
is no contract, plan or arrangement covering any current or former director,
employee, or consultant of the Company that, individually or collectively,
could give rise to any payment or benefit as a result of the execution and
delivery of this Agreement or the consummation of the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement (either alone or in conjunction with any other
event). Except as provided in this Agreement or as set forth in Section
4.10(c) of the Disclosure Schedule, the execution and delivery of this
Agreement and the consummation of the Transactions contemplated by this
Agreement (alone or together with any other event which, standing alone, would
not by itself trigger such entitlement or acceleration) will not (i) entitle
any person to any payment, forgiveness of indebtedness, vesting, distribution,
or increase, in each case, of benefits or compensation under or with respect
to any Company Benefit Plan or otherwise, (ii) trigger any acceleration (of
vesting or time of payment of compensation, benefits or otherwise) under or
with respect to any Company Benefit Plan or otherwise, (iii) trigger any
obligation to fund any Company Benefit Plan; or (iv) limit or restrict the
right of the Company or any Company Subsidiary to merge, amend or terminate
any Company Benefit Plan. No current or former director, employee, or
consultant of the Company is entitled to receive a gross-up payment,
reimbursement or similar payment from the Company with respect to any taxes
that may be imposed upon such individual pursuant to Section 409A of the Code,
Section 4999 of the Code (or any corresponding provisions of state or local
Law relating to Tax), or otherwise.

(d) Except as would not, individually or in the aggregate result in a
liability material to the Company and Company Subsidiaries, taken as a whole
(i) each Company Benefit Plan has been operated in all material respects in
accordance with its terms and the requirements of all applicable Laws
including ERISA and the Code, (ii) no event has occurred and, to the knowledge
of the Company, no condition exists, that has subjected, or would reasonably
be expected to subject, the Company or any Company Subsidiary to any material
tax, fine, lien, penalty 

or other liability imposed by ERISA, the Code or any other applicable Law,
either directly or by reason of the Company's affiliation with any ERISA
Affiliate,(iii) the Company and the Company Subsidiaries have performed all
material obligations required to be performed by them under and are not in
material default under or in material violation of, and, to the knowledge of
the Company, there is no material default or material violation by any party
to, any Company Benefit Plan, and (iv) as of the date of this Agreement, no
Action is pending or, to the knowledge of the Company, threatened with respect
to any Company Benefit Plan (other than routine claims for benefits in the
ordinary course of business).

(e) Each U.S. Benefit Plan that is intended to be qualified under Section
401(a) of the Code has timely received a favorable determination, opinion
letter for a prototype plan, notification or advisory letter from the IRS
covering all of the provisions applicable to such Company Benefit Plan for
which such letters are currently available that such Company Benefit Plan is
so qualified, has a remaining period of time under applicable Treasury
Regulations or IRS pronouncements in which to apply for such letter and to
make any amendments necessary to obtain a favorable determination, or may rely
upon an opinion letter for a prototype plan, and each trust established in
connection with any such Company Benefit Plan that is intended to be exempt
from federal income taxation under Section 501(a) of the Code has received a
letter from the IRS that it is so exempt, has a remaining period of time under
applicable Treasury Regulations or IRS pronouncements in which to apply for
such letter and to make any amendments necessary to obtain a favorable
determination, or may rely upon an opinion letter for a prototype plan and to
the knowledge of the Company, and nothing has occurred since the date of such
determination that could reasonably be expected to adversely affect the
qualification of such Company Benefit Plan. No Company capital stock is used
as a funding vehicle or otherwise permitted as an investment option with
respect to any Company Benefit Plan that is intended to be qualified under
Section 401(a) of the Code.

(f) There has not been any prohibited transaction (within the meaning of
Section 406 of ERISA or Section 4975 of the Code and not otherwise exempt
under Section 408 of ERISA) with respect to any US Benefit Plan. Neither the
Company nor any ERISA Affiliate has incurred any material liability under,
arising out of or by operation of Title IV of ERISA (other than liability for
premiums to the Pension Benefit Guaranty Corporation arising in the ordinary
course), including any material liability in connection with (i) the
termination or reorganization of any employee benefit plan subject to Title IV
of ERISA, or (ii) the withdrawal from any Multiemployer Plan or Multiple
Employer Plan, and, to the knowledge of the Company, no fact or event exists
that could give rise to any such liability. As of the date of this Agreement,
there are no audits, inquiries or proceedings pending or, to the knowledge of
the Company, threatened by the IRS, the United States Department of Labor, or
other Governmental Authority of competent jurisdiction with respect to any
Company Benefit Plan. All contributions, premiums or payments required to be
made with respect to any Company Benefit Plan have been made (or accrued if
not yet due) on or before their due dates, except as would not result in
material liability to the Company or the Company Subsidiaries.

(g) Each Company Benefit Plan that is a "nonqualified deferred compensation
plan" (as defined for purposes of Section 409A(d)(1) of the Code) subject to 

Section 409A of the Code (and not exempt from Section 409A of the Code) has
complied at all times with Section 409A of the Code with respect to its form
and operation.

(h) The parties acknowledge that certain payments have been made or are to be
made and certain benefits have been granted or are to be granted according to
employment compensation, severance and other employee benefit plans of the
Company and the Company Subsidiaries or pursuant to other arrangements with
the Company and the Company Subsidiaries, including the Company Benefit Plans,
to holders of Company Common Stock and other securities of the Company (the
"Covered Securityholders") (with all such plans and arrangements being
collectively referred to as the "Company Arrangements"). All such amounts
payable under the Company Arrangements (i) have been or are being paid or
granted as compensation for past services performed, future services to be
performed, or future services to be refrained from performing, by the Covered
Securityholders (and matters incidental thereto) and (ii) were not, and are
not, calculated based on the number of shares tendered or to be tendered into
the Offer by the applicable Covered Securityholder. The adoption, approval,
amendment or modification of each Company Arrangement has been approved as an
employment compensation, severance or other employee benefit arrangement
solely by independent directors of the Company in accordance with the
requirements of Rule 14d-10(d)(2) under the Exchange Act and the instructions
thereto and the "safe harbor" provided pursuant to Rule 14d-10(d)(2) is
otherwise applicable thereto as a result of the taking prior to the execution
of this Agreement of all necessary actions by the Company Board, the
Compensation Committee of the Company Board (the "Company Compensation
Committee") or its independent directors. A true and complete copy of any
resolutions of any committee of the Company Board reflecting any approvals and
actions referred to in the preceding sentence and taken prior to the date of
this Agreement has been made available to Parent prior to the execution of
this Agreement.

(i) With respect to each Company Benefit Plan that is mandated by a government
other than the United States or subject to the Laws of a jurisdiction outside
of the United States (each, a "Foreign Company Benefit Plan"), the fair market
value of the assets of each funded Foreign Company Benefit Plan, the liability
of each insurer for any Foreign Company Benefit Plan funded through insurance
or the book reserve established for any Foreign Company Benefit Plan, together
with any accrued contributions, is sufficient to procure or provide for the
accrued benefit obligations, as of the date of this Agreement, with respect to
all current and former participants in such Foreign Company Benefit Plan
according to the actuarial assumptions and valuations most recently used to
determine employer contributions to such Foreign Company Benefit Plan, and no
transaction contemplated by this Agreement shall cause such assets or
insurance obligations to be less than such benefit obligations. Each Foreign
Company Benefit Plan has been maintained and operated in all material respects
in accordance with the applicable plan document and all applicable Laws and
other requirements, and if intended to be registered or to qualify for special
tax treatment, satisfies all requirements for such registration or treatment. 

4.11 Labor and Employment Matters.

(a) The Company represents and warrants that:

(i) As of the date of this Agreement, there are no material Actions pending
or, to the knowledge of the Company, threatened between the Company or any
Company Subsidiary and any of their respective present or former employees or
independent contractors.

(ii) Neither the Company nor any Company Subsidiary is a party to nor bound by
any collective bargaining agreement, work council agreement, work force
agreement or any other labor union or labor organization Contract (each a

applicable Law of each relevant jurisdiction, taken reasonable steps

confidentiality obligations (other than former Trade Secrets the Company and
Company Subsidiaries intentionally publicly disclosed by or on behalf of the
Company or a Company Subsidiary without confidentiality obligations in its

2014, neither Company nor any Company Subsidiary has commenced any Action with
respect to infringement or misappropriation of any Owned Company Intellectual
Property or Intellectual Property exclusively licensed to Company or any
Company Subsidiary against any Third Party, and no such Action pending. Since
January 1, 2014, neither the Company nor any Company Subsidiary has (i)

moratorium or other laws relating to or affecting the rights and remedies of
creditors generally and general principles of equity governing the
availability of equitable remedies). The Company and each Company Subsidiary

made available to Parent.

(l) Subject to obtaining the consents that are listed in Section 4.5(b) of the
Disclosure Schedule, neither the execution, delivery and performance of this
Agreement, nor the consummation of the Transactions, will violate or result in
the breach, material modification, cancellation, termination or suspension of,
loss of any material rights or acceleration of any payments under the Company
Intellectual Property Agreements (or give rise to any right with respect to
any of the foregoing), except for any such breaches, modifications,
cancellations, terminations, suspensions, losses, or payment accelerations
that, individually or in the aggregate, (i) would not reasonably be expected
to prevent or materially delay beyond the Outside Date the consummation of the
Offer or the Merger and (ii) have not had and would not reasonably expected to
have a Material Adverse Effect. Immediately following the Effective Time, the
Surviving Corporation will have and be permitted to exercise all of the
Company's and the Company Subsidiaries' rights under the Company Intellectual
Property Agreements (and will have the same rights with respect to the
Intellectual Property of Third Parties under the Company Intellectual Property
Agreements) to the same extent that Company and the Company Subsidiaries would
have had, and been able to exercise, had this Agreement not been entered into,
and the Transactions not occurred, without the payment of any additional
amounts or consideration other than ongoing fees, royalties or payments which
Company and Company Subsidiaries would otherwise have been required to pay
anyway pursuant to the Company Intellectual Property Agreements. No Contract

any license, covenant not to sue, immunity or other right with respect to or
under any Intellectual Property of Parent or the Surviving Corporation; or
(ii) be obligated to pay any royalties or other amounts, or offer any
discounts, to any Third Party (except, in each of (i) and (ii), with respect

expected to be material to the Company and Company Subsidiaries, taken as a

charge.

(n) Section 4.14(n) of the Disclosure Schedule contains a complete and

Effective Time, on Parent or the Surviving Corporation) with respect to
licensing or granting of any rights included in the Owned Company Intellectual
Property.

(o) "Company Products" means all hardware, Software, Databases, products and

decrease the rate or materially alter the terms of, the business it conducts
with (or the Databases or data it provides for) the Company or any Company
Subsidiary, except in each of the foregoing as, individually or in the
aggregate, has not been and would not reasonably be expected to be material to
the Company and Company Subsidiaries, taken as a whole. Except as,
individually or in the aggregate, has not been and would not reasonably be
expected to be material to the Company and Company Subsidiaries, taken as a
whole, the Company and the Company Subsidiaries have conducted diligence on
all third parties that provide data (including personal data) to the Company

(b) Other than disputes or claims that have not had, and would not reasonably
be expected to have, individually or in the aggregate, a Material Adverse

respect to the Merger, the filing and recordation of an appropriate
certificate of merger as required by the DGCL). This Agreement has been duly
and validly executed and delivered by Parent and Purchaser and, assuming due
authorization, execution and delivery by the Company, constitutes a legal,
valid and binding obligation of each of Parent and Purchaser, enforceable
against each of Parent and Purchaser in accordance with its terms, subject to
(i) applicable bankruptcy, insolvency, reorganization, moratorium or other
similar laws, now or hereafter in effect, affecting creditors' rights
generally and (ii) general principles of equity governing the availability of
equitable remedies.

with, violate or breach the certificate of incorporation or bylaws or
equivalent organizational documents of either Parent or Purchaser, (ii)
subject to obtaining all consents, approvals, waiting period terminations or
expirations, authorizations and other actions described in Section 5.3(b) and

property or asset of either of them is bound or affected, (iii) result in any
violation, breach of or constitute a default (or an event that, with notice or
lapse of time or both, would become a default or breach) under, or give to
others any rights of termination, amendment, acceleration, right of purchase
under, or cancellation of, or result in the creation of a Lien on any property
or asset of Parent or Purchaser pursuant to, or result in the loss of a
material benefit under any Contract, permit, franchise or other instrument or
obligation to which Parent or Purchaser is a party or by which Parent or
Purchaser or any property or asset of either of them is bound or affected, or
(iv) result in the release, disclosure, or license of any source code or other
Trade Secret included in the Owned Company Intellectual Property, except, with
respect to clauses (ii) and (iii), for any such conflicts, violations,
breaches, defaults or other occurrences that, individually or in the
aggregate, would not prevent or materially delay consummation of the
Transactions beyond the Outside Date or otherwise prevent Parent and Purchaser
from performing any of their material obligations under this Agreement.

(b) The execution and delivery of this Agreement and each other Transaction
Document to which it is a party by Parent and Purchaser do not, and the
performance of this Agreement and each other Transaction Document to which it

requirements in foreign countries regarding antitrust or competition matters
and any associated consents, approvals, authorizations, waiting period
terminations, or permits, and (y) the filing and recordation of an appropriate
certificate of merger as required by the DGCL, and (ii) where the failure to
obtain such consents, approvals, waiting period expirations or terminations,
authorizations or permits, or to make such filings or notifications,
individually or in the aggregate, would not reasonably be expected to prevent
or materially delay consummation of the Transactions beyond the Outside Date
or otherwise prevent Parent or Purchaser from performing their material
obligations under this Agreement.

5.4 Financing.

(a) Parent has delivered to the Company true, accurate and complete copies of
(i) the executed debt commitment letter, dated as of the date of this
Agreement, by and among Parent and the Lenders, including all exhibits,
schedules, annexes and amendments thereto (as amended, restated, replaced,
substituted, supplemented, waived or otherwise modified in accordance with
Section 7.15(c) or, in the case of an Alternative Financing, in accordance
with Section 7.15(d), the "Debt Commitment Letter"), pursuant to which, and
subject to the terms and conditions of which, the Lenders party thereto have
committed to lend the amounts set forth therein to Parent for the purpose of
funding the Offer, the Merger and the other Transactions (such committed debt
financing, the "Debt Financing") and (ii) the fee letter referred to in the
Debt Commitment Letter (with only fee amounts, pricing caps and other economic
terms redacted (none of which would adversely affect the amount or
availability of the Debt Financing)) (as amended, restated, replaced,
substituted, supplemented, waived or otherwise modified in accordance with
Section 7.15(c) or, in the case of an Alternative Financing, in accordance
with Section 7.15(d), the "Debt Fee Letter").

(b) As of the date of this Agreement, (i) the Debt Commitment Letter is in
full force and effect and has not been withdrawn, rescinded or terminated, or
otherwise amended or modified in any respect and (ii) the Debt Commitment
Letter, in the form so delivered, constitutes a legal, valid and binding
obligation of Parent, and, to the knowledge of Parent, the other parties
thereto, enforceable against it or them, as the case may be, in accordance
with its terms except as enforceability may be affected by bankruptcy,
insolvency, fraudulent conveyance, reorganization, moratorium and other
similar Laws relating to or affecting creditors' rights generally, and general
equitable principles. Other than as expressly set forth in the Debt Commitment
Letter and the unredacted portion of the Debt Fee Letter, there are no other
agreements, side letters, or arrangements relating to the Debt Commitment
Letter that could affect the amount, availability or conditionality of the
Debt Financing.

(c) As of the date of this Agreement, no Lender party to the Debt Commitment
Letter has notified Parent or Purchaser of its intention to terminate any of
the commitments under the Debt Commitment Letter or not to provide the Debt
Financing. Assuming 

satisfaction of the Tender Offer Conditions and the conditions set forth in
Section 8.1, as of the date of this Agreement, each of Parent and Purchaser
has no reason to believe that any of the conditions in the Debt Commitment
Letter will fail to be satisfied on a timely basis.

(d) Parent or Purchaser, as applicable, has fully paid (or caused to be paid)
any and all commitment fees or other fees required by the Debt Commitment
Letter to be paid on or before the date of this Agreement. Assuming the
satisfaction of the Tender Offer Conditions and the conditions set forth in
Section 8.1, the aggregate proceeds from the Debt Financing (after netting out
applicable fees, expenses, original issue discount and similar premiums and
charges and after giving effect of the maximum amount of flex (including
original issue discount flex) provided under the Debt Fee Letter, as
applicable), together with other cash available to Parent, are sufficient in
amount for Parent or Purchaser, as applicable, to pay the Per Share Amount
payable in the Offer for all Company Shares tendered in the Offer, the Merger
Consideration, any other amounts required to be paid in connection with the
consummation of the Transactions (including any amounts payable in respect of
Company Stock Options and Company RSUs under this Agreement), in each case, to
the extent required to be paid on the Acceptance Date or the Merger Closing
Date (collectively, the "Required Amount"). The only conditions precedent
related to the obligations of the Lenders to fund the full amount of the Debt
Financing are those expressly set forth in the Debt Commitment Letter and the
Debt Fee Letter.

5.5 Absence of Litigation. As of the date of this Agreement, there is no
material Action pending or, to the knowledge of Parent or Purchaser,
threatened against Parent, any subsidiary of Parent, or any property or asset
of Parent or any subsidiary of Parent, before any Governmental Authority of
competent jurisdiction that is reasonably expected to prevent or delay beyond
the Outside Date the consummation of the Transactions or otherwise prevent or
delay beyond the Outside Date Parent or Purchaser from performing their
material obligations under this Agreement and each other Transaction Document
to which it is a party. As of the date of this Agreement, neither Parent nor
any subsidiary of Parent nor any property or asset of Parent or any subsidiary
of Parent is subject to any material continuing order of, consent decree,
settlement agreement or similar written agreement with, or, to the knowledge
of Parent or Purchaser, continuing investigation by, any Governmental
Authority of competent jurisdiction, or any order, writ, judgment, injunction,
decree, determination or award of any Governmental Authority of competent
jurisdiction that is reasonably expected to prevent consummation of the Offer
or the Merger or otherwise prevent Parent or Purchaser from performing their
material obligations under this Agreement.

5.6 Purchaser. All of the outstanding capital stock of Purchaser is owned
indirectly by Parent. Except for obligations or liabilities incurred in
connection with its incorporation or organization or the negotiation and
consummation of this Agreement, the Offer, the Merger and the Transactions,
Purchaser has not incurred any obligations or liabilities, and has not engaged
in any business or activities of any type or kind whatsoever or entered into
any Contracts or arrangements with any person or entity.

5.7 Ownership of Company Capital Stock. Neither Parent nor Purchaser is, nor
at any time during the last three (3) years ending on the date of this
Agreement has it been, an "interested stockholder" of the Company as defined
in Section 203(c) of the DGCL (other than as 

contemplated by this Agreement). Prior to the date hereof, neither Parent nor
Purchaser has taken, or authorized or permitted any Representatives of Parent
or Purchaser to take, any action that would reasonably be expected to cause,
Parent, Purchaser or any of their "affiliates" or "associates" to be deemed an
"interested stockholder" as defined in Section 203 of the DGCL or otherwise
render Section 251(h) of the DGCL inapplicable to the Merger. Neither Parent
nor Purchaser nor any of their affiliates own any Company Shares as of the
date of this Agreement.

5.8 Offer Documents; Schedule 14D-9. The Offer Documents shall not, at the
time the Offer Documents are filed with the SEC or are first published, sent
or given to holders of Company Shares, as the case may be, contain any untrue
statement of a material fact or omit to state any material fact required to be
stated therein or necessary in order to make the statements therein, in the
light of the circumstances under which they were made, not misleading. The
information supplied by Parent to the Company specifically for inclusion in
the Schedule 14D-9 shall not, at the date first mailed to stockholders of the
Company contain any untrue statement of a material fact, or omit to state any
material fact required to be stated therein or necessary in order to make the
statements therein, in light of the circumstances under which they were made,
not false or misleading, or necessary to correct any statement in any earlier
communication that shall have become false or misleading. Notwithstanding the
foregoing, Parent and Purchaser make no representation or warranty with
respect to any information supplied by the Company or any of its
representatives for inclusion in any of the foregoing documents or the Offer
Documents. The information supplied by Parent for inclusion in the Schedule
14D-9 and the Offer Documents shall comply in all material respects as to form
with the requirements of the Exchange Act and the rules and regulations
thereunder.

provided that such disclosure shall not be required to include any information
that is subject to a statutory non-disclosure or similar provision or
agreement with a Governmental Authority, prime contractor, higher-tier
subcontractor, distributor, or other third party for end-use by a Governmental
Authority (collectively, "Governmental Contracting Parties"), or that is
subject to an attorney-client privilege or other legal privilege, or that is
subject to a non-disclosure agreement with a third party. If requested by
Parent, the Company agrees to use its reasonable best efforts to secure the
consent of the appropriate Governmental Contracting Party or other third party
to permit disclosure of such protected information to Parent and Purchaser.

(b) All information obtained by Parent or Purchaser pursuant to this Section

contractual "standstill," confidentiality or similar obligation of any person

share acquisition," "business combination" or other similar anti-takeover
statute (including Section 203 of the DCGL) or any restrictive provision of
any applicable anti-takeover provision in the Company's organizational
documents, in each case inapplicable to any person (other than Parent,
Purchaser or any of their affiliates) or any Acquisition Proposal (and to the
extent permitted thereunder, the Company shall promptly take all steps
necessary to terminate any waiver that may have been heretofore granted to any
such person or Acquisition Proposal under any such provisions) or (E) have the
Company Board resolve or agree to do any of the foregoing. The Company shall,
and shall cause the Company Subsidiaries and its and their respective
Representatives to immediately cease and cause to be terminated, and shall not
authorize or permit any of its or their Representatives to continue, any and
all existing activities, discussions or negotiations with any Third Party with
respect to any Acquisition Proposal, shall immediately terminate any data room
access (if any) to any such Third Parties and shall immediately request and,

Company or any of the Company Subsidiaries that was furnished by or on behalf
of the Company and the Company Subsidiaries to return or destroy (and confirm
destruction of) all such information.

(ii) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary herein, if at any time following
the date hereof and prior to the Expiration Time, in response to a bona fide
written Acquisition Proposal that was made after the date hereof and that did
not result from a breach of Section 7.2(a)(i) that the Company Board
determines in good faith (after consultation with outside counsel and its
financial advisor) is, or would reasonably be expected to lead to, a Superior
Proposal, the Company may, subject to compliance with Section 7.2, (x) furnish
information regarding the Company and the Company Subsidiaries to the person
making such Acquisition Proposal (and its Representatives) pursuant to a
confidentiality agreement (which shall permit the Company to comply with the
terms of this Section 7.2 and containing terms not less favorable in the
aggregate to the 

Company than the Confidentiality Agreement; provided, that all such
information has previously been provided to Parent or is provided to Parent
prior to or promptly (and in any event within twenty-four (24 hours) following
the time it is provided to such person, and (y) participate in discussions or
negotiations with the person making such Acquisition Proposal (and its
Representatives) regarding such Acquisition Proposal, but only if and to the
extent that in connection with the foregoing clauses (x) and (y), the Company
Board determines in good faith (after consultation with outside legal counsel)
that failure to take such action would be inconsistent with its fiduciary
duties under applicable Law. In addition, notwithstanding the foregoing, prior
to the Expiration Time, the Company may, to the extent the Company Board
determines in good faith (after consultation with outside legal counsel) that
failure to take such action would be inconsistent with its fiduciary duties
under applicable Law, not enforce any "standstill" or similar agreement to
which the Company or any Company Subsidiary is a party for the sole purpose of
allowing the other party to such agreement to submit a private Acquisition
Proposal to the Company Board that will constitute, or would reasonably be
expected to lead to, a Superior Proposal, that did not, in each case, result
from a breach by the Company of Section 7.2(a).

(iii) For purposes of this Agreement, "Superior Proposal" means any bona fide
written Acquisition Proposal, which did not result from a breach of this
Section 7.2(a), made by a Third Party that, if consummated, would result in
such Third Party's (or its stockholders') owning, directly or indirectly,
greater than 70% of the equity securities of the Company (or of the shares of
the surviving entity in a merger or the direct or indirect parent of the
surviving entity in a merger) or greater than 70% of the assets of the Company
and Company Subsidiaries, taken as a whole (based on the fair market value
thereof, as reasonably determined by the Company Board after consultation with
its financial advisor) and that the Company Board determines in good faith
after consultation with its outside legal counsel and its financial advisor if
consummated, to be (a) more favorable, from a financial point of view, to the
Company's stockholders (in their capacities as stockholders) than the Offer
and the Merger and (b) reasonably capable of being consummated on the terms
proposed, in each case, taking into account all financial, legal, financing,
regulatory and other terms and conditions of such proposal and of this
Agreement (including any changes to the terms of this Agreement proposed by
Parent in response to such offer or otherwise).

(b) • Except as set forth in this Section 7.2, until the earlier of the
Acceptance Date and the termination of this Agreement in accordance with the
terms hereof, neither the Company Board nor any committee thereof shall: (x)
(A) fail to make pursuant to Section 2.2(b), or withdraw, modify, amend or
qualify or publicly propose to withdraw, modify, amend or qualify, in any
manner adverse to Parent or Purchaser, the Company Board Recommendation, (B)
fail to recommend against acceptance of any tender offer or exchange offer
other than the Offer for the Company Common Stock within ten (10) business
days of the commencement of such offer, (C) approve, endorse, adopt or
recommend, or publicly propose to approve, endorse, adopt or recommend, any
Acquisition Proposal, (D) fail to reconfirm the Company Board Recommendation
within ten (10) business days after the commencement of a tender or exchange
offer or public announcement or public notice of an Acquisition Proposal from
a Third Party after written request from Parent to do so, (E) fail to include
the Company Board Recommendation in the Schedule 14D-9 or to permit Parent to
include the Company Board Recommendation in the Offer Documents or (F) 

resolve or agree to take any of the foregoing actions (any of the foregoing in
clauses (A)-(F), a "Change in Recommendation"), or (y) approve, endorse, adopt
or recommend, or publicly propose to approve, endorse, adopt or recommend, or
allow the Company or any of the Company Subsidiaries to execute or enter into,
any letter of intent, memorandum of understanding, agreement in principle,
merger agreement, acquisition agreement, option agreement, joint venture
agreement, partnership agreement or other similar Contract constituting or
related to, any Acquisition Proposal (other than a confidentiality agreement
referred to in Section 7.1) (any of the foregoing, an "Acquisition
Agreement").

(i) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this Agreement, if
the Company Board determines in good faith (after consultation with its
outside legal counsel and financial advisor) that failure to take such action
would be inconsistent with its fiduciary duties under applicable Law, the
Company Board may at any time prior to the Expiration Time, if there is an
Intervening Event, take the actions described in clauses (x)(A), (E) or (F) of
the definition of Change in Recommendation (any such Change in Recommendation,
an "Intervening Event Change in Recommendation"); provided, however, that the
Company Board may not effect an Intervening Event Change in Recommendation due
to an Intervening Event unless (a) the Company shall have provided prior
written notice to Parent at least three (3) business days in advance of its
intention to take such action (which notice shall specify the Intervening
Event in reasonable detail), (b) prior to effecting such Intervening Event
Change in Recommendation, the Company shall, and shall cause its
Representatives to, during such three (3) business day period, negotiate with
Parent in good faith (to the extent that Parent desires to negotiate) to make
such adjustments to the terms and conditions of this Agreement so that the
Intervening Event Change in Recommendation is no longer necessary (and in the
event of any material change to the circumstances related to the Intervening
Event, the Company shall, in each case, deliver to Parent an additional notice
consistent with that described in this proviso and a renewed negotiation
period under this proviso shall commence (except that the three (3) business
day period shall instead be equal to two (2) business days)), and (c) at or
following the end of such notice period, the Company Board determines in good
faith (taking into account any proposed adjustments to the terms and
conditions of this Agreement and after consultation with outside counsel and
its financial advisor) that the failure to effect an Intervening Event Change
in Recommendation would be inconsistent with its fiduciary duties under
applicable Law; provided, further, that the Company Board shall not be
permitted to effect an Intervening Event Change in Recommendation pursuant to
this Section 7.2(b)(ii) with respect to or in connection with any Acquisition
Proposal (which shall be covered by and subject in all respects to Section
7.2(b)(iii)).

(ii) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this Agreement, at
any time prior to the Expiration Time, the Company Board may in response to an
Acquisition Proposal that the Company Board determines in good faith (after
consultation with outside legal counsel and its financial advisor) constitutes
a Superior Proposal and that was made after the date of this Agreement and
that did not result from a breach of Section 7.2(a), (A) make a Change in
Recommendation if the Company Board has concluded in good faith (after
consultation with its outside legal counsel and its financial advisor) that,
in light of the receipt of such Superior Proposal, that failure to make such
Change in Recommendation would be inconsistent with its fiduciary duties under
applicable Law, or (B) cause the Company to terminate this Agreement 

pursuant to Section 9.1(g) and concurrently with such termination enter into
an Acquisition Agreement if the Company Board has concluded in good faith,
after consultation with its outside legal counsel and its financial advisor,
that, in light of the receipt of such Superior Proposal, that failure to so
terminate this Agreement would be inconsistent with its fiduciary duties under
applicable Law; provided, however, that the Company Board may not effect a
Change in Recommendation or terminate this Agreement unless (a) the Company
shall have provided prior written notice to Parent at least four (4) business
days in advance of its intention to take such action, which notice shall
describe in reasonable detail the terms and conditions of any Superior
Proposal that is the basis of the proposed action by the Company Board (a
"Designated Superior Proposal") and attach the most current form or draft of
any written agreement relating to the transaction contemplated by such
Designated Superior Proposal, (b) prior to effecting such Change in
Recommendation or termination of this Agreement, the Company shall, and shall
cause its Representatives to, during such four (4) business day period,
negotiate with Parent in good faith (to the extent that Parent desires to
negotiate) to make such adjustments to the terms and conditions of this
Agreement so that the Change in Recommendation is no longer necessary and such
Superior Proposal no longer constitutes a Superior Proposal (and in the event
of any material change to any of the terms (including the form, amount and
timing of payment of consideration) of such Superior Proposal, the Company
shall, in each case, deliver to Parent an additional notice consistent with
that described in this proviso and a renewed negotiation period under this
proviso shall commence (except that the four (4) business day period shall
instead be equal to three (3) business days) and (c) at or following the end
of such notice period, the Company Board determines in good faith (taking into
account any proposed adjustments to the terms and conditions of this Agreement
and after consultation with outside counsel and its financial advisor) that
the failure to effect a Change in Recommendation would be inconsistent with
its fiduciary duties under applicable Law; provided further, that the Company
shall not be entitled to terminate this Agreement pursuant to the foregoing
clause (B), and any purported termination pursuant to the foregoing clause (B)
shall be void and of no force or effect, unless prior to or concurrently with
such termination the Company pays by wire transfer of immediately available
funds the Company Termination Fee in accordance with Section 9.1(g).

(c) The Company shall promptly (and in any event within twenty-four (24) hours
of learning of the relevant information) advise Parent orally and in writing
of the receipt of any Acquisition Proposal (including for the avoidance of
doubt any request for information or other inquiry which the Company would
reasonably expect to lead to an Acquisition Proposal), including the material
terms and conditions of such Acquisition Proposal (including any changes
thereto) and the identity of the person making such Acquisition Proposal and
attaching a copy of any documents relating to such written Acquisition
Proposal, or if such Acquisition Proposal is provided orally to the Company,
the Company shall summarize in writing the terms of such Acquisition Proposal
(including for the avoidance of doubt any such request or other inquiry). The
Company shall keep Parent informed on a reasonably prompt basis in all
material respects of the status and details (including any material change to
the terms thereof) of any Acquisition Proposal.

(d) Nothing contained in this Section 7.2 or elsewhere in this Agreement shall
prohibit the Company or the Company Board from taking and disclosing to its
stockholders a position required by Rule 14e-2(a) or Rule 14d-9 under the
Exchange Act or making a statement required under Rule 14d-9 under the
Exchange Act or under Item 1012(a) of Regulation M-A 

promulgated under the Exchange Act (including making any "stop-look-and-
listen" communication to the stockholders); provided, that this Section 7.2(d)
shall not be deemed to affect whether any such disclosure, other than a "stop,
look and listen" communication of the type contemplated by Section 14d-9(f) of
the Exchange Act, shall be deemed to be a Change in Recommendation. For
clarity, a factually accurate public statement that only describes the
Company's receipt of an Acquisition Proposal, that no position has been taken
by the Company Board as to the advisability or desirability of such
Acquisition Proposal and the operation of this Agreement with respect thereto
will not be deemed a Change in Recommendation.

7.3 Employee Benefits Matters.

(a) If so directed by Parent in writing at least ten (10) days prior to the
initial scheduled expiration of the Offer, the Company Board will adopt (and
will cause any other sponsor of the applicable Company Benefit Plan to adopt),
at least five (5) business days prior to the initial scheduled expiration of
the Offer, resolutions terminating any and all Company Benefit Plans intended
to qualify as a qualified cash or deferred arrangement under Section 401(k) of
the Code, effective no later than the day immediately preceding the date the
Company becomes a member of the same controlled group of corporations (as
defined in Section 414(b) of the Code) as Parent. The form and substance of
such resolutions shall be subject to the reasonable approval of Parent, and
the Company shall provide Parent evidence that such resolutions have been
adopted by the Company Board or the board of directors of the Company
Subsidiaries or any other applicable Company Benefit Plan sponsor, as
applicable. The Company shall take such other actions in furtherance of
terminating any such 401(k) plans as Parent may reasonably request.

(b) For the period beginning on the Merger Closing Date and ending on the
first anniversary of the Merger Closing Date (the "Continuation Period"), the
Parent shall, or shall cause the Company and Company Subsidiaries to provide
the Continuing Employees, who remain so employed with the Company or Company
Subsidiaries (i) with substantially comparable base salary and target annual
cash bonus opportunities (excluding the value attributable to equity-based
incentive awards) as was provided to the Continuing Employees prior to the
Effective Time and (ii) with severance benefits (other than severance benefits
provided to employees terminated for poor performance) that are substantially
similar to the severance benefits to which the Continuing Employees would have
been entitled with respect to such termination under the Company Benefit Plans
covering the Company employees as set forth on Section 7.3(b) of the
Disclosure Schedule and in effect immediately prior to the Merger Closing
Date, provided that this undertaking shall not obligate Parent to continue the
employment of such Continuing Employees for any period following the Effective
Time, and such Continuing Employees may be terminated by Parent at any time.

(c) During the Continuation Period, Parent shall, or shall cause the Company
and Company Subsidiaries to provide the Continuing Employees with
substantially comparable types and levels of employee benefits in the
aggregate (excluding long-term incentive opportunities, employer matching
contributions under any qualified defined contribution retirement plan, equity
based compensation or benefits, vacation benefits, retiree medical or life
insurance benefits and defined benefit plan benefits) as the aggregate
employee benefits (excluding long-term incentive opportunities, employer
matching contributions under any qualified defined contribution 

retirement plan, equity based compensation or benefits, vacation benefits,
retiree medical or life insurance benefits and defined benefit plan benefits)
provided to (i) such Continuing Employees immediately prior to the Merger
Closing Date under the Company Benefit Plans or (ii) similarly situated
employees of Parent and its Subsidiaries (other than the Company and Company
Subsidiaries) (it being understood that participation in Parent Plans (as
defined below) may commence at different times with respect to each Parent
Plan and with respect to each Continuing Employee).

(d) For purposes of vesting, eligibility to participate and with respect to
vacation and severance only, benefit accruals (but not benefit accrual under
any defined benefit plan or frozen benefit plan of Parent or vesting under any
equity incentive plan) under any employee benefit plans sponsored and
maintained by the Parent or any affiliate of Parent under which the Continuing
Employee is eligible to participate after the Merger Closing Date (the "Parent
Plans"), Parent will credit each Continuing Employee with his or her years of
service with the Company before the Effective Time, to the same extent as such
Continuing Employee was entitled, before the Effective Time, to credit for
such service under any corresponding Company Benefit Plan in which such
Continuing Employee participated or was eligible to participate immediately
prior to the Effective Time; provided that the foregoing will not apply to the
extent that its application would result in a duplication of benefits with
respect to the same period of service. In addition, Parent will use
commercially reasonable efforts, subject in each case to receipt of any
required consent of the applicable Parent Plan provider, to cause (i) each
Continuing Employee to be immediately eligible to participate, without any
waiting time, in any and all Parent Plans to the same extent that a waiting
time was not applicable under the corresponding Company Benefit Plan, (ii) for
purposes of each Parent Plan providing medical, dental, pharmaceutical and/or
vision benefits to any Continuing Employee, all pre-existing condition
exclusions and actively-at-work requirements of such Parent Plan to be waived
for such Continuing Employee and his or her covered dependents, to the extent
such conditions were inapplicable or waived under the comparable Company
Benefit Plans in which such Continuing Employee participated immediately prior
to the Effective Time, and (iii) for the plan year in which the Effective Time
occurs, the crediting of each Continuing Employee with any deductibles paid
prior to the Effective Time in satisfying any applicable deductible or out-of-
pocket requirements under any Parent Plan.

(e) Nothing in this Agreement shall (x) create any third-party beneficiary
rights in any employee or former employee (including any beneficiary or
dependent thereof) or service provider or former service provider (including
any beneficiary or dependent thereof) of the Parent, Company or any Company
Subsidiary in any respect, including in respect of continued employment (or
resumed employment), or create any such rights in any such persons in respect
of any benefits that may be provided, directly or indirectly, under any plan
or any employee or service provider program or arrangement of Parent, the
Company, and the Company Subsidiaries or any of their affiliates (including
any Company Benefit Plan), or (y) constitute or be construed to constitute an
amendment to any Company Benefit Plan or any other compensation or benefit
plans maintained for or provided to employees or other persons prior to or
following the Effective Time. Nothing in this Agreement shall constitute a
limitation on the rights to amend, modify or terminate any such plans or
arrangements of Parent or any of its subsidiaries (including any Company
Benefit Plan). 

(f) The Company shall take all actions necessary so that, prior to the
Expiration Time: (X) the adoption, approval, amendment or modification of each
such Company Arrangement shall be approved as an employment compensation,
severance or other employee benefit arrangement solely by independent
directors of the Company in accordance with the requirements of Rule
14d-10(d)(2) under the Exchange Act and the instructions thereto and (Y) the
"safe harbor" provided pursuant to Rule 14d-10(d)(2) is otherwise applicable
thereto as a result of the taking prior to the Expiration Time of all
necessary actions by the Company Board, the Company Compensation Committee or
its independent directors.

7.4 Directors' and Officers' Indemnification and Insurance.

(a) From and after the Effective Time, Parent shall cause the Surviving
Corporation to, fulfill and honor in all respects the obligations of the
Company pursuant to any indemnification, exculpation or advance of expense or
similar agreement by the Company or any Company Subsidiary in favor of any
Indemnified Person (the "Indemnification Agreements") (and all other
indemnification agreements of the Company that are on terms substantially
similar to the Indemnification Agreements) and any indemnification,
exculpation or advancement of expenses provisions under the Certificate of
Incorporation or Bylaws (or comparable organizational documents) as in effect
on the date of this Agreement; provided, that such obligations shall be
subject to any limitation imposed from time to time under applicable Law.

(b) Prior to the Effective Time, the Company shall, and for six (6) years
after the Effective Time, Parent shall cause the Surviving Corporation to,
provide officers' and directors' liability, fiduciary liability and similar
insurance (collectively, "DandO Insurance") in respect of acts or omissions
occurring prior to the Effective Time covering each Indemnified Person covered
as of the date of this Agreement by the Company's DandO Insurance policies on
terms with respect to coverage and amount no less favorable than those of such
policy in effect on the date of this Agreement; provided, that, in satisfying
its obligation under this Section 7.4(b), the Surviving Corporation shall not
be obligated to pay annual premiums in the aggregate in excess of 300% of the
amount per annum the Company paid in its last full fiscal year, which amount
the Company is set forth in Section 7.4(b) of the Disclosure Schedule
(provided, that if the annual premium of such insurance coverage exceeds such
amount, the Surviving Corporation shall be obligated to obtain the most
advantageous policies available for an annual premium equal to such amount).
Notwithstanding the foregoing, at any time Parent or the Surviving Corporation
may, and prior to the Acceptance Date, the Company may, with the prior written
consent of Parent (which shall not be unreasonably withheld, delayed or
conditioned), purchase a "tail" directors' and officers' liability insurance
policy, covering the same persons and providing the same terms with respect to
coverage and premium amount as aforesaid, and that by its terms shall provide
coverage until the sixth annual anniversary of the Effective Time, and, upon
the purchase of such insurance, Parent's and the Surviving Corporation's
obligations pursuant to the first sentence of this Section 7.4(b) shall be
deemed satisfied for so long as such insurance is in full force and effect and
covers the matters that would otherwise be covered pursuant to this Section
7.4(b).

(c) The rights of each Indemnified Person under this Section 7.4 shall survive
consummation of the Merger and are intended to benefit, and shall be
enforceable by, each 

Indemnified Person, his or her heirs and his or her representatives, and are
in addition to, and not in substitution for, any other rights to which each
Indemnified Person is entitled, whether pursuant to Law, Contract or
otherwise. The obligations of Parent and the Surviving Corporation under this
Section 7.4 shall not be terminated or modified in such a manner as to
adversely affect any Indemnified Person to whom this Section 7.4 applies
without the consent of such affected Indemnified Person. Parent shall pay all
reasonable expenses, including reasonable attorneys' fees, that may be
incurred by any Indemnified Person in enforcing the indemnity and other
obligations provided in this Section 7.4.

(d) If (1) Parent, the Surviving Corporation or any of its successors or
assigns (i) consolidates with or merges into any other person and shall not be
the continuing or the surviving corporation or entity of such consolidation or
merger, or (ii) transfers or conveys all or substantially all of its
properties and assets to any person or (2) Parent or any of its successors or
assigns dissolves the Surviving Corporation, then, and in each such case, to
the extent necessary, proper provision shall be made so that the successors
and assigns of the Surviving Corporation, as the case may be, shall assume the
obligations set forth in this Section 7.4.

7.5 Anti-Takeover Statutes. In the event that any state anti-takeover or other
similar Law is or becomes applicable to this Agreement or any of the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement, the Company and Company Board
shall grant such approval and take such action as necessary so that the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement may be consummated as promptly as
practicable on the terms and subject to the conditions set forth in this
Agreement and otherwise to minimize the effect of such Law on this Agreement
and the transactions contemplated hereby.

7.6 Notification of Certain Matters. The Company shall give prompt notice to
Parent and Purchaser in writing of: (i) any representation or warranty made by
the Company contained in this Agreement becoming untrue or inaccurate such
that the conditions set forth in clause (iii)(c) of Annex A would not be
satisfied or (x) any failure of the Company to comply with any covenant or
agreement to be complied with by it under this Agreement such that the
conditions set forth in clause (iii)(d) of Annex A would not be satisfied; and
(ii) the occurrence or existence of any Effect that, individually or in the
aggregate, has had, or would reasonably be expected to have, a Material
Adverse Effect. Parent shall give prompt notice to the Company in writing of
any representation or warranty made by Parent or Purchaser contained in this
Agreement becoming untrue or inaccurate, or any failure of Parent or Purchaser
to comply with any covenant or agreement to be complied with by it under this
Agreement, in each case, such that the failure to so comply or the becoming
untrue or incorrect would reasonably be expected to prevent or materially
delay consummation of the Transactions or otherwise prevent Parent or
Purchaser from performing their material obligations under this Agreement. For
clarity, unintentional failure to give notice under this Section 7.6 shall not
be deemed to be a breach of covenant under this Section 7.6 but shall not
affect whether a breach of the underlying representation, warranty, covenant
or agreement has occurred, as the case may be.

7.7 Litigation. Each party hereto shall promptly notify the other parties of
any action, suit, proceeding or investigation that shall be instituted or
threatened in writing against such 

party to restrain, prohibit or otherwise challenge the legality of or seek
damages in connection with this Agreement or any Transaction. Each party
hereto shall promptly notify the others of any new action, suit, proceeding or
investigation that is instituted or threatened in writing against the Company,
any of the Company Subsidiaries, Purchaser or Parent, as the case may be, that
would have been listed in Section 4.9 of the Disclosure Schedule or would
constitute an exception to Section 5.5, as the case may be, if such action,
suit, proceeding or investigation had arisen prior to the date hereof. The
Company shall give Parent the opportunity to participate at Parent's expense
in (but not control) the defense or settlement of any stockholder litigation
or claims against the Company or any of its directors relating to the Offer or
the Merger, in each case which seek to prohibit or restrain the transactions
contemplated hereby. The Company shall not settle or make an offer to settle
any litigation against the Company or any director by any stockholder relating
to this Agreement, the Offer or the Merger, without the prior written consent
of Parent (which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld, delayed or
conditioned).

7.8 Consents and Approvals.

(a) The parties hereto shall cooperate with each other and, subject to the
terms and conditions of this Agreement, each use its reasonable best efforts
to promptly (x) prepare and file all necessary documentation and (y) effect
all applications, notices, petitions and filings (including, to the extent
necessary, any notification required by the HSR Act and other antitrust laws,
as more specifically addressed in Section 7.9) and (z) obtain all permits,
consents, waiting period expiration or terminations, approvals and
authorizations of all third parties and Governmental Authorities that are
necessary or reasonably deemed advisable by both parties to consummate the
Transactions. The Company shall also use its commercially reasonable efforts
to obtain all consents required to be listed on Section 4.5(a) of the
Disclosure Schedule (for clarity, the Company will not be required to pay any
monies or make any other concessions to any third party in connection
therewith, except to the extent expressly required by the terms of any
Contract with such third party). The parties hereto shall consult with each
other with respect to the obtaining of all such permits, consents, approvals,
waiting period expiration or terminations and authorizations, and each party
will keep the other apprised of the status of matters relating to completion
of the Transactions. Parent and the Company shall each, subject to the terms
and conditions of this Agreement, use its reasonable best efforts to resolve
any objections that may be asserted by any Governmental Authority with respect
to this Agreement or the Transactions. Parent and the Company, with respect to
any threatened or pending preliminary or permanent injunction or other order,
decree or ruling or statute, rule, regulation or executive order that would
adversely affect the ability of the parties hereto to consummate the
transactions contemplated hereby, shall use reasonable best efforts to prevent
the entry, enactment or promulgation thereof, as the case may be. The Company
shall provide the holders of Warrants any notices required in accordance with
the terms thereof prior to the Closing.

(b) Parent and the Company shall promptly advise each other upon receiving any
communication from any Governmental Authority whose consent or approval is
required for consummation of any of the Transactions relating to any such
consent or approval.

(c) This Section 7.8 is subject to, in all respects, the provisions of Section
7.9 below. 

7.9 HSR Act Filing and International Antitrust Notifications.

(a) Within ten (10) business days after the date of this Agreement, if
required by any Law, each of Parent and the Company shall, or shall cause
their ultimate parent entity as that term is defined in the HSR Act and its
implementing regulations to, file with the Federal Trade Commission (the
"FTC") and the Antitrust Division of the U.S. Department of Justice (the
"Antitrust Division") a pre-merger notification in accordance with the HSR Act
with respect to the Offer and the Merger pursuant to this Agreement. As
promptly as possible after the date of this Agreement, Parent shall file an
antitrust notification in any other jurisdiction if advisable or required by
any Law. Each of Parent and the Company shall furnish promptly to the FTC, the
Antitrust Division and any other requesting Governmental Authority any
additional information or documentary material requested by any of them
pursuant to the HSR Act or any other antitrust or related Law in connection
with such filings. To the extent permitted by Law, each of Parent and the
Company shall consult in advance and cooperate with one another, and consider
in good faith the views of one another, in connection with any analyses,
appearances, presentations, memoranda, briefs, arguments, opinions and
proposals made or submitted by or on behalf of any party hereto in connection
with proceedings under or relating to the HSR Act or any foreign or other
antitrust Law. Parent and the Company shall cooperate fully with each other in
connection with the making of all such filings or responses. In addition,
except as may be prohibited by any Governmental Authority or by any applicable
law, each party hereto will permit authorized representatives of the other
parties to attend any substantive meeting, communication, or conference with
any Governmental Authority in connection with such proceedings under or
relating to the HSR Act or any foreign or other antitrust Law. Without
limiting the generality of the foregoing, each party shall provide to the
other (or the other's respective advisors) upon request copies of all
substantive correspondence between such party and any Governmental Authority
relating to the transactions contemplated by this Agreement. The parties may,
as they deem advisable and necessary, (i) redact materials: (1) to remove
references concerning the valuation of the Company and the Company
Subsidiaries; (2) as necessary to comply with contractual arrangements or
applicable Laws; and (3) as necessary to address reasonable attorney-client or
other privilege or confidentiality concerns; or (ii) designate any
competitively sensitive materials provided to the other under this Section 7.9
as "outside counsel only." Such "outside counsel only" materials and the
information contained therein shall be given only to outside counsel of the
recipient and will not be disclosed by such outside counsel to employees,
officers, or directors of the recipient without the advance written consent of
the party providing such materials.

(b) Subject to applicable confidentiality restrictions or restrictions
required by Law, Parent and Company will notify the other promptly upon the
receipt of (i) any comments, questions, or requests for information or
documents from any Governmental Authority in connection with any filings made
pursuant to Section 7.9(a) or the transactions contemplated by this Agreement
and (ii) any request by any Governmental Authority for amendments or
supplements to any filings made pursuant to any Laws relating to an
investigation of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement. Whenever any
event occurs that is required to be set forth in an amendment or supplement to
any filing made pursuant to this Section, or whenever a Governmental Authority
requests information or documents related to the transactions contemplated by
this Agreement, each party will promptly inform the other of such occurrence
or request and cooperate in filing or producing promptly with the applicable
Governmental Authority such amendment, supplement, 

information or documents. Without limiting the generality of the foregoing,
each party shall provide to the other (or the other's respective advisors)
upon request copies of all substantive correspondence between such party and
any Governmental Authority relating to the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement. The parties may, as they deem advisable and necessary, (i) redact
materials: (1) to remove references concerning the valuation of the Company
and the Company Subsidiaries; (2) as necessary to comply with contractual
arrangements or applicable Laws; and (3) as necessary to address reasonable
attorney-client or other privilege or confidentiality concerns; or (ii)
designate any competitively sensitive materials provided to the other under
this Section 7.9 as "outside counsel only." Such "outside counsel only"
materials and the information contained therein shall be given only to outside
counsel of the recipient and will not be disclosed by such outside counsel to
employees, officers, or directors of the recipient without the advance written
consent of the party providing such materials. In addition, to the extent
reasonably practicable, all discussions, telephone calls, and meetings with a
Governmental Authority regarding the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement shall include representatives of both parties. Subject to applicable
Law, the parties will consult and cooperate with each other in connection with
any analyses, appearances, presentations, memoranda, briefs, arguments, and
proposals made or submitted to any Governmental Authority regarding the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement by or on behalf of any party.

(c) Each of Parent and the Company shall use its reasonable best efforts to
resolve such objections, if any, as may be asserted by any Governmental
Authority with respect to the Transactions under any applicable antitrust
Laws. Except as the parties may agree after consultation, each of the Parent
and the Company shall use reasonable best efforts to promptly and
substantially comply with any request for request for additional information
and documentary material ("Second Request") issued by the FTC or Antitrust
Division.

(d) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained herein, neither Parent,
Purchaser nor their respective affiliates shall be required (and neither the
Company nor any Company Subsidiary shall agree to any of the following without
the express written consent of Parent or Purchaser): (i) to offer, agree or
consent to, sell, divest, lease, license, transfer, dispose of or otherwise
encumber or hold separate (before or after the Merger Closing) any assets,
licenses, operations, rights, product lines, businesses or interest therein of
the Parent, Purchaser, the Company or any of their respective subsidiaries;
(ii) to offer, agree or consent to any changes (including through a licensing
or other similar arrangement) to or restriction on (including any access or
other requirements), or other impairment of Parent's or Purchaser's ability to
own or operate, any such assets, licenses, operations, rights, product lines,
businesses or interests or Parent's ability to vote, transfer, receive
dividends or otherwise exercise full ownership rights with respect to the
equity securities or other ownership interests of Parent, Purchaser or the
Company; or (iii) to contest, defend or appeal any Action brought by a
Governmental Authority against such party which seeks to prohibit, prevent or
restrict the transactions contemplated by this Agreement.

7.10 Rule 16b-3. Prior to the Acceptance Date, the Company shall take such
actions as may be required to cause the transactions contemplated by Section
3.7 and any other dispositions of equity securities of the Company by each
individual who is a director or officer of the Company to be exempt under Rule
16b-3 promulgated under the Exchange Act. 

7.11 Delisting. Each party hereto agrees to cooperate with the other party in
taking, or causing to be taken, all actions necessary to (i) delist the
Company Common Stock from the Nasdaq Stock Market LLC and (ii) to terminate
the registration of the Company Common Stock under the Exchange Act; provided,
that such delisting or termination shall not be effective until after the
Effective Time.

7.12 Further Assurances. Subject to Section 7.9, each of the parties to this
Agreement shall use its reasonable best efforts to effect the Transactions and
each party hereto, at the reasonable request of another party hereto, shall
execute and deliver such other instruments and do and perform such other acts
and things as may be necessary or desirable for effecting the consummation of
this Agreement and the Transactions.

7.13 Public Announcements. No press release or public announcement, statement
or disclosure concerning the Offer, the Merger or any other Transaction shall
be issued by either party without the prior consent of the other party (which
consent shall not be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed), except
(x) as such release or announcement may be required by Law, including the
rules or regulations of any U.S. or non-U.S. securities exchange, in which
case the party required to make the release or announcement shall use its
reasonable efforts to allow the other party reasonable time to comment on such
release or announcement in advance of such issuance, and (y) that neither the
Parent or Purchaser, on the one hand, nor the Company, on the other hand,
shall be required to obtain such consent from the other party in connection
with the receipt and existence of an Acquisition Proposal and matters related
thereto or a Change in Recommendation or Intervening Event Change of
Recommendation and matters related thereto. In the case of the Company,
internal announcements, meetings and other group communications to employees
regarding or making reference to Parent or any of its affiliates, the Offer,
the Merger, the other transactions contemplated by this Agreement and/or
related matters, whether made in writing or orally, shall be deemed to be
public statements for purposes of this Section 7.13, except to the extent they
repeat information that has already been publicly disclosed in compliance with
the Agreement.

7.14 Obligations of Purchaser. Parent shall take all action necessary to cause
Purchaser and the Surviving Corporation to perform their respective
obligations under this Agreement and to consummate the Offer and the Merger on
the terms and conditions set forth in this Agreement and reaffirms its
obligation to consummate the Transactions irrespective and independently of
the availability of financing in connection with the Transactions.

7.15 Financing.

(a) Parent shall use, and shall cause its subsidiaries to use, their
respective reasonable best efforts to:

(i) comply with and maintain in effect the Debt Financing and the Debt
Commitment Letter; 

(ii) satisfy, or cause their respective Representatives to satisfy on a timely
basis all conditions to the Debt Financing contemplated by the Debt Commitment
Letter, the Debt Fee Letter and Debt Financing Agreements that are within its
control;

(iii) comply with their obligations under the Debt Commitment Letter to the
extent the failure to comply with such obligations would adversely impact the
amount or timing of the Debt Financing (taking into account the expected
timing of the Marketing Period) or the availability of the Debt Financing
prior to the Acceptance Date; and

(iv) enforce their rights under the Debt Commitment Letter to the extent that
the failure to enforce would adversely impact the amount or timing of the Debt
Financing (taking into account the expected timing of the Marketing Period) or
the availability of the Debt Financing at the Acceptance Date.

(b) Unless, and to the extent, Parent or Purchaser has sufficient funds from
other sources (including by reason of a capital markets or other financing
transaction) available to satisfy their obligations under this Agreement,
Parent shall use, and shall cause its subsidiaries to use, their respective
reasonable best efforts to obtain the proceeds of the Debt Financing on the
terms and conditions (including any "flex" provisions) described in the Debt
Commitment Letter and the Debt Fee Letter, including using their respective
reasonable best efforts to:

(i) negotiate and enter into definitive financing agreements with respect to
the Debt Financing on terms and conditions not less favorable, in the
aggregate, than those contained in the Debt Commitment Letter (including the
"flex" provisions contained in the Debt Fee Letter) (the "Debt Financing
Agreements"); and

(ii) in the event that all conditions to the Debt Financing have been
satisfied and Parent is required to consummate the Offer, cause the Lenders
and any other persons providing Debt Financing to fund the Debt Financing no
later than the Acceptance Date.

(c) Parent shall not agree to or permit any amendment, supplement,
termination, modification or replacement of, or grant any waiver of, any
condition, remedy or other provision under the Debt Commitment Letter or the
Debt Fee Letter without the prior written consent of the Company (not to be
unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed) if such amendment, supplement,
termination, modification, replacement or waiver would reasonably be expected
to (i) reduce the aggregate amount of the Debt Financing from that
contemplated by the Debt Commitment Letter delivered as of the date hereof to
an amount such that the Transactions could not be consummated, (ii) impose any
new or additional conditions or otherwise expand, amend or modify any of the
conditions to the receipt of the Debt Financing in a manner that would
reasonably be expected to materially delay or prevent the Offer or the
availability of the Debt Financing or (iii) adversely impact in any material
respect the ability of Parent to enforce its rights against the other parties
to the Debt Commitment Letter (it being understood and agreed that, in any
event, (x) any Alternative Financing permitted under Section 7.15(d) shall not
be deemed to be a replacement for the purposes of this sentence, (y) Parent
may amend the Debt Commitment Letter to add lenders, arrangers, bookrunners,
agents, managers or similar entities that have not executed the Debt
Commitment Letter as of the date of this Agreement and (z) no consent from the
Company is required 

for implementation or exercise of any "flex" provisions provided in the Debt
Fee Letter). Upon any amendment, supplement, modification or replacement of,
or waiver of, the Debt Commitment Letter or the Debt Fee Letter in accordance
with this Section 7.15(c) or Section 7.15(d), Parent shall promptly deliver a
true and complete copy thereof (subject to applicable redactions in the case
of the Debt Fee Letter) to the Company and references herein to "Debt
Commitment Letter" or the "Debt Fee Letter", as applicable, shall include and
mean such documents as amended, supplemented, modified, replaced or waived in
compliance with this Section 7.15(c) or Section 7.15(d), and references to
"Debt Financing" shall include and mean the financing contemplated by the Debt
Commitment Letter as amended, supplemented, modified, replaced or waived in
compliance with this Section 7.15(c) or Section 7.15(d), as applicable.

(d) Unless, and to the extent, Parent or Purchaser has sufficient cash from
other sources (including by reason of a capital markets or other financing
transaction) available to satisfy their obligations under this Agreement, in
the event that all or any portion of the Debt Financing becomes unavailable on
the terms and conditions (including any "flex" provisions) contemplated in the
Debt Commitment Letter for any reason or the Debt Commitment Letter shall be
withdrawn, terminated, repudiated or rescinded for any reason, (i) Parent
shall promptly notify the Company and (ii) Parent shall use its reasonable
best efforts to, on a timely basis (taking into account the expected timing of
the Marketing Period), arrange and obtain, and to negotiate and enter into
definitive agreements with respect to, alternative financing from the same or
alternative sources (the "Alternative Financing") in an amount sufficient to
pay the Required Amount (assuming the satisfaction of the Tender Offer
Conditions and the conditions set forth in Section 8.1 and when taken together
with other cash available to Parent and any remaining portion of the Debt
Financing available to Parent or Purchaser); provided that Parent shall not be
required to obtain Alternative Financing on terms and conditions that are
materially less favorable, taken as a whole, to Parent or Purchaser, as
applicable, than those in the Debt Commitment Letter (including any "flex"
provisions) that such Alternative Financing would replace. Notwithstanding the
foregoing, no Alternative Financing may impose any new or additional
conditions or otherwise expand, amend or modify any of the conditions set
forth in the Debt Commitment Letter as in effect on the date hereof in a
manner that would reasonably be expected to materially delay or prevent the
Offer. In the event that Parent obtains commitments to receive any Alternative
Financing in accordance with this Section 7.15(d), Parent or Purchaser, as
applicable, shall deliver true and complete copies of any new Debt Commitment
Letter and Debt Fee Letter (subject to applicable redactions).

(e) Parent or Purchaser, as applicable, shall keep the Company reasonably
informed of the status of its efforts to arrange the Debt Financing (including
any Alternative Financing). Without limiting the generality of the foregoing,
Parent and Purchaser, as applicable, shall give the Company prompt notice of
the receipt or delivery of any notice or other communication, in each case
from any Lender with respect to (x) any actual or potential default under or
breach of any provisions of the Debt Commitment Letter or Debt Financing
Agreements by Parent or any withdrawal, termination, repudiation or rescission
or threatened withdrawal, termination, repudiation or rescission thereof by
any party to any of the Debt Commitment Letter or Debt Financing Agreements or
(y) any material dispute or disagreement between or among parties to any of
the Debt Commitment Letter or Financing Agreements with respect to the
obligation to fund the Debt Financing or the amount of the Debt Financing to
be funded at the Acceptance Date 

in each case, that would reasonably be expected to result in any portion of
the Debt Financing reasonably required to fund the Required Amount being
unavailable or materially delay or prevent the availability of the Debt
Financing.

(f) Parent and Purchaser each acknowledges and agrees that the obtaining of
the Debt Financing (including any Alternative Financing) is not a Tender Offer
Condition or a condition to the Merger Closing, and reaffirms its obligation
to consummate the Transactions irrespective and independently of the
availability of the Debt Financing (including any Alternative Financing), or
the completion of any such issuance, subject to the applicable Tender Offer
Conditions set forth on Annex A, the conditions to the Merger set forth in
Article 8 and the provisions set forth in Section 10.6(c).

7.16 Financing Cooperation.

(a) The Company shall, and shall cause each Company Subsidiary to, use its
respective reasonable best efforts to provide (and cause their respective
Representatives to provide) such cooperation in connection with arranging,
obtaining and syndicating the Debt Financing as may be reasonably requested by
Parent or Purchaser, as applicable, as is customary in connection with the
Debt Financing; provided that such requested cooperation is consistent with
applicable Law and does not unreasonably interfere with the ongoing operations
of the Company or any Company Subsidiary. Such cooperation by the Company and
the Company Subsidiaries shall include, in each case at the reasonable request
of Parent:

(i) preparing and furnishing Parent and the Lenders, as promptly as

(v) reasonably cooperating with Parent's legal counsel in connection with
customary legal opinions required of Purchaser in connection with the Debt
Financing;

(vi) reasonably assisting Purchaser in obtaining any corporate credit and

Letter, 

including assisting Purchaser and the Lenders in the preparation of customary

(including delivery of original stock certificates and original stock powers
of the Company Subsidiaries on the Merger Closing Date in connection with the
Debt Financing to the extent available to the Company);

(ix) using reasonable best efforts to assist the Lenders in benefiting from
the existing lending relationships of the Company;

applicable, at least eight (8) calendar days prior to the Acceptance Time in
connection with the Debt Financing that relates to applicable "know your
customer" and anti-money laundering rules and regulations including without
limitation the USA PATRIOT Act; and

(xii) using reasonable best efforts to obtain customary payoff letters and
lien terminations, if applicable, to the extent necessary to allow for the
payoff, discharge and termination of any indebtedness (it being understood and
agreed that the Company's obligations to provide payoff letters in respect of
the Existing Loan Agreement are as set forth in Section 7.16(c) below).

(b) Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the contrary, (A) none of
the Company, any Company Subsidiary or any director, manager, officer or
employee thereof shall be required to pay any commitment or other similar fee
or enter into any binding agreement or commitment or incur any other actual or
potential liability or obligation in connection with the Debt Financing prior
to the Effective Time and that is not subject to the occurrence of the Merger
Closing (other than such management and representation letters included in the
Required Information), (B) none of the Company, any of the Company
Subsidiaries or any of their respective directors or officers shall be
obligated to adopt resolutions or execute consents to approve or authorize the
execution of the Debt Financing, provided that this clause (B) shall not
prohibit the adoption or execution of any resolutions or consents effective no
earlier than the Effective Time by any persons that shall remain or will
become officers or directors of the Company or any of the Company Subsidiaries
as of the Effective Time, and (C) neither the Company nor any Company 

Subsidiary shall be required to take any action that would reasonably be
expected, in the reasonable judgment of the Company, to conflict with, or
result in any violation or breach of, any applicable Law, any Material
Contract binding on the Company or the Company Subsidiaries on the date
hereof. The Company hereby consents to the use of the Company's and the
Company Subsidiaries' logos in connection with the Debt Financing on such
customary terms and conditions as the Company shall reasonably impose;
provided, however, that such logos are used solely in a manner that is not
intended, or reasonably likely, to harm, disparage or otherwise adversely
affect the Company or the reputation or goodwill of the Company.

(c) Parent or Purchaser, as applicable, shall, promptly upon request by the
Company, reimburse the Company for all reasonable and documented out-of-pocket
costs and expenses incurred by the Company, the Company Subsidiaries and its
and their respective Representatives in connection with their respective
obligations pursuant to Section 7.16(a). Parent and Purchaser shall jointly
and severally indemnify and hold harmless the Company, the Company
Subsidiaries and their respective Representatives, from and against any and
all claims, losses, liabilities, damages, judgments, inquiries, fines and
reasonable fees, costs and expenses, including attorneys' fees, fees and
expenses of the Company's accounting firms engaged to assist in connection
with the Debt Financing, and disbursements suffered or incurred by any of them
in connection with the Debt Financing (except to the extent suffered or
incurred as a result of (i) the gross negligence, willful misconduct or
material breach of this Agreement by the Company, any Company Subsidiary or
any Representative thereof, in each case as determined by a court of competent
jurisdiction, or (ii) any information used in connection with the Debt
Financing provided to Parent by the Company or any Company Subsidiary).

business days prior to the Acceptance Time, a payoff letter from the agent or

letter (and, if applicable, cash collateral with respect to letters of
credit), (x) the respective indebtedness incurred thereunder and related
instruments shall be terminated and (y) all Liens and guarantees, if any, in
connection therewith relating to the assets and properties of the Company or
any of the Company Subsidiaries securing such Indebtedness, shall be released
and terminated or (ii) prior to the Acceptance Time, a letter from the agent
or other authorized representative confirming that (x) the indebtedness
incurred thereunder and related instruments has been repaid in full (or if
applicable, cash collateralized) and terminated, and (y) all Liens and
guarantees, if any, in connection therewith relating to the assets and
properties of the Company or any of the Company Subsidiaries securing such
Indebtedness, have been released and terminated.

right to terminate this Agreement, has been the primary cause of, or resulted
in, the failure of such acceptance to occur on or before such date; or,

(ii) the Offer (as it may have been extended pursuant to Section 2.1) expires
without Purchaser having accepted the Offer as a result of the non-

Section 9.1(b)(ii) shall not be available to any party whose failure to

Company Shares were validly tendered and not withdrawn pursuant to the Offer);
provided, however, if such breach or inaccuracy is capable of being cured
prior to the earlier of (A) the Outside Date and (B) the date that is twenty
(20) business days from the date Parent is notified in writing by the Company
of such breach, the Company may not terminate the Agreement pursuant to this

date if such inaccuracy or breach is cured at or prior to such date;

(f) By the Company (by action of the Company Board), if all of the Tender
Offer Conditions have been satisfied or waived as of immediately prior to the

pursuant to Section 9.1, this Agreement shall forthwith become void, and there

Section 7.16(c) (Financing Cooperation), Section 9.3 (Fees), Article 10
(General Provisions) and this Section 9.2 shall remain in full force and
effect and survive any termination of this Agreement, and (b) subject to
Sections 9.3(d), 9.3(e) and 9.3(f), such termination shall not relieve any
party from liability for any willful and material breach of its
representations or warranties or covenants hereunder. A termination of this
Agreement shall not cause a termination of the Confidentiality Agreement or
any other agreement between the parties.

9.3 Fees.

(a) In the event that this Agreement is terminated:

(i) by Parent, Purchaser or the Company pursuant to Section 9.1(b)(i) or
Section 9.1(b)(ii), or by Parent or Purchaser pursuant to Section 9.1(c), and
(x) an Acquisition Proposal by a Third Party shall have been publicly
announced after the date of this Agreement and not withdrawn (publicly, in the
case of termination pursuant to Section 9.1(b)(ii) only) prior to such
termination and (y) within 12 months after such termination (A) the Company
enters into a definitive agreement with respect to an Acquisition Proposal or
(B) an Acquisition Proposal is consummated (with all references to "fifteen
percent (15%)" in the definition thereof being treated as references to "more
than 50%" for purposes of this Section 9.3(a));

(ii) by Parent or Purchaser pursuant to Section 9.1(d); or

(iii) by the Company pursuant to Section 9.1(g);

then, in any such event, the Company shall pay Parent the Company Termination
Fee, which amount shall be payable by wire transfer of immediately available
funds. The Company Termination Fee shall be paid (x) in the circumstances
described in clause (i) above, promptly on the earlier of (1) one (1) business
day following the date of the execution of such definitive agreement and (2)
the date of the consummation of such Acquisition Proposal, as applicable, (y)
in the circumstances described in clause (ii) above, within two (2) business
days of the termination, and (z) in the circumstances described in clause

(b) In the event that this Agreement is terminated (i) by the Company pursuant
to Section 9.1(f) or (ii) by Parent or Purchaser pursuant to Section
9.1(b)(i), and with respect to this clause (ii), at such time, all of the
Tender Offer Conditions have been satisfied or waived (other than those
conditions that by their nature are to be satisfied upon consummation of the
Offer but which conditions would be capable of being satisfied if the
consummation of the Offer were the time of such termination) and the Company
has given notice in writing representing that it stands ready, willing, and
able to consummate the Offer and the Merger Closing, and in each case of (i)
and (ii), Parent and Purchaser have failed to complete the Offer Closing or
the Merger Closing by the respective date the Offer Closing or the Merger
Closing is required to have occurred pursuant to this Agreement as a result of
the full amount of the Debt Financing failing to be funded or 

prospectively funded at the Offer Closing or the Merger Closing, then, in any
such event, Parent shall pay the Company $5,313,000 (the "Parent Termination
Fee"), which amount shall be payable by wire transfer of immediately available
funds, within three (3) business days of the termination to an account
designated in writing by the Company.

(c) All costs and expenses incurred in connection with this Agreement and the
Transactions shall be paid by the party incurring such expenses, whether or
not any Transaction is consummated.

(d) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement, each party
acknowledges and agrees on behalf of itself and its affiliates that:

(i) the Company Termination Fee is not a penalty, but rather is liquidated
damages in a reasonable amount that will compensate Parent and Purchaser in
the circumstances in which the Company Termination Fee is payable for the
efforts, expenses and resources expended and opportunity forgone while
negotiating this Agreement and in reliance on this Agreement and on the
expectation of the consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby, which
amount would otherwise be impossible to calculate with precision; each of
Parent and Purchaser acknowledges and hereby agrees that the provisions of
this Section 9.3 are an integral part of the Transactions, and that, without
such provisions, the Company would not have entered into this Agreement;

(ii) the Parent Termination Fee is not a penalty, but rather is liquidated
damages in a reasonable amount that will compensate the Company in the
circumstances in which the Parent Termination Fee is payable for the efforts,
expenses and resources expended and opportunity forgone while negotiating this
Agreement and in reliance on this Agreement and on the expectation of the
consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby, which amount would
otherwise be impossible to calculate with precision; the Company acknowledges
and hereby agrees that the provisions of this Section 9.3 are an integral part
of the Transactions, and that, without such provisions, Parent and Purchaser
would not have entered into this Agreement; and

(e) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary set forth in this Agreement, each
of the parties hereto expressly acknowledges and agrees that Parent's right to
receive payment of the Company Termination Fee plus, if applicable, the
Enforcement Costs, pursuant to this Section 9.3, in circumstances in which the
Company Termination Fee is payable, shall constitute the sole and exclusive
remedy (whether based in contract, tort or strict liability, by the
enforcement of any assessment, by any legal or equitable proceeding, by virtue
of any statute, regulation or applicable Law or otherwise) of Parent,
Purchaser and their respective affiliates and any of their and their
respective affiliates' former, current or future general or limited partners,
stockholders, members, managers, directors, trustees, officers, employees,
agents, controlling persons, representatives or affiliates, or any Lender
Related Party or any other source of financing, or any lead arranger,
arranger, agent or Representative of, or to, Parent or Purchaser (the "Parent
Related Parties") against the Company and the Company Subsidiaries and their
respective affiliates and any of their and their respective affiliates'
former, current or future general or limited partners, stockholders, members,
managers, directors, officers, employees, agents, controlling persons,
representatives or affiliates (collectively, the "Company Related Parties")
and any person who 

pays such amount on the Company's behalf for all any and all losses, claims,
damages, liabilities, costs, fees, expenses (including reasonable attorney's
fees and disbursements), judgments, inquiries and fines suffered in respect of
this Agreement or any contract or agreement executed in connection herewith
(including in respect of any breach, whether or not willful and intentional,
of any representation, warranty, covenant or agreement or the failure of the
Merger to be consummated) or the Transactions in such circumstances, and upon
payment of the amount of the Company Termination Fee plus, if applicable, the
Enforcement Costs, to Parent, none of the Company Related Parties shall have
any further liability or obligation to any of the Parent Related Parties
relating to or arising out of this Agreement or the Transactions. For the
avoidance of doubt, in no event shall the Company be required to pay the
Company Termination Fee on more than one occasion. No Parent Related Party
shall be entitled to bring or maintain any Action against the Company or any
other Company Related Party arising out of or in connection with this
Agreement, any contract or agreement executed in connection herewith or any of
the transactions contemplated hereby or thereby (or the abandonment or
termination thereof) or any matters forming the basis for such termination,
and Parent shall use its reasonable best efforts to cause any Action pending
in connection with this Agreement, any contract or agreement executed in
connection herewith or any of the transactions contemplated hereby or thereby,
to the extent maintained by Parent or any Parent Related Party against the
Company or any Company Related Party to be dismissed with prejudice promptly
following the payment of any such amounts. Any Company Related Party is an
express third party beneficiary of the provisions of this Section 9.3(e) and
may enforce this Section 9.3(e) directly.

(f) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary set forth in this Agreement, each
of the parties hereto expressly acknowledges and agrees that the Company's
right to receive payment of the Parent Termination Fee, plus, if applicable,
the Enforcement Costs pursuant to this Section 9.3 shall constitute the sole
and exclusive remedy (whether based in contract, tort or strict liability, by
the enforcement of any assessment, by any legal or equitable proceeding, by
virtue of any statute, regulation or applicable Law or otherwise) of the
Company Related Parties against the Parent Related Parties and any person who
pays such amount on Parent's behalf for all any and all losses, claims,
damages, liabilities, costs, fees, expenses (including reasonable attorney's
fees and disbursements), judgments, inquiries and fines suffered in respect of
this Agreement, any contract or agreement executed in connection herewith
(including with respect to the Debt Commitment Letter) and the transactions
contemplated hereby and thereby (including in respect of any breach, whether
or not willful or intentional, of any representation, warranty, covenant or
agreement or the failure of the Merger to be consummated) or the Transactions
in such circumstances, and upon payment of Parent Termination Fee plus, if
applicable, the Enforcement Costs, none of the Parent Related Parties shall
have any further liability or obligation to any of the Company Related Parties
relating to or arising out of this Agreement or the Transactions. For the
avoidance of doubt, in no event shall Parent be required to pay such amount on
more than one occasion. No Company Related Party shall be entitled to bring or
maintain any Action against Parent or any other Parent Related Party arising
out of or in connection with this Agreement, any contract or agreement
executed in connection herewith (including with respect to the Debt Commitment
Letter) or any of the transactions contemplated hereby or thereby (or the
abandonment or termination thereof) or any matters forming the basis for such
termination, and the Company shall use its reasonable best efforts to cause
any Action pending in connection with this Agreement, any contract or
agreement executed 

in connection herewith (including with respect to the Debt Commitment Letter)
or any of the transactions contemplated hereby or thereby, to the extent
maintained by the Company or any Company Related Party against Parent or any
Parent Related Party to be dismissed with prejudice promptly following the
payment of such amount. Any Parent Related Party is an express third party
beneficiary of the provisions of this Section 9.3(f) and may enforce this
Section 9.3(f) directly. Subject to Section 10.6, nothing in this Section
9.3(f) shall limit the right of a party to bring or maintain a legal
proceeding for an injunction, specific performance or other equitable relief
to the extent provided in Section 10.6, unless and until this Agreement has
been terminated (it being understood and agreed that the remedy of specific
performance shall in no event be deemed monetary damages covered by this
Section 9.3(f) even though such remedy will involve the payment of money);
provided, however, that while the Company may pursue an injunction, specific
performance or equitable relief to the extent provided in Section 10.6 and
monetary damages, under no circumstances will the Company be permitted or
entitled to receive (1) both a grant of an injunction, specific performance or
other equitable relief that results in the consummation of the Transactions
pursuant to Section 10.6, on the one hand, and monetary damages or the Parent
Termination Fee, on the other hand, or (2) both monetary damages on the one
hand, or the Parent Termination Fee, on the other hand.

(g) If (i) the Company fails to pay in a timely manner the Company Termination
Fee due pursuant to Section 9.3(a), and, in order to obtain such payment,
Parent makes a claim that results in a judgment for the Company Termination
Fee (or a portion thereof) set forth in Section 9.3(a), the Company shall pay
to Parent its reasonable costs and expenses (including reasonable attorneys'

the fullest extent possible.

10.4 Entire Agreement; Assignment; No Other Representations or Warranties.
This Agreement and the Confidentiality Agreement constitute the entire
agreement among the parties with respect to the subject matter hereof and
supersede all prior and 

contemporaneous agreements and undertakings, both written and oral, among the
parties, or any of them, with respect to the subject matter hereof. This
Agreement shall not be assigned (whether pursuant to a merger, by operation of
law or otherwise), except that (a) Parent and Purchaser may assign all or any
of their rights hereunder to any wholly owned subsidiary of Parent so long as
Parent and Purchaser remain liable for all of the obligations contemplated
under this Agreement and (b) Parent and Purchaser (and following the Merger
Closing Date, the Company) may at any time, and without the consent of any
other person or party, unilaterally grant a security interest in, and assign
for collateral security purposes, its rights and interests hereunder to the
Lenders (or their agent) providing Debt Financing under the Debt Commitment
Letter or the definitive documentation with respect thereto. Except for the
representations and warranties contained in Article 4, each of Parent and
Purchaser acknowledges that neither the Company nor any person on behalf of
the Company makes, and neither Parent nor Purchaser nor any person on their
behalf relies upon, any other express or implied representation or warranty
with respect to the Company or any of the Company Subsidiaries or with respect
to any other information made available to Parent or Purchaser in connection
with the Transactions. Each of Parent and Purchaser hereby acknowledge that
neither the Company nor any of the Company Subsidiaries, nor any of their
respective shareholders, directors, officers, employees, affiliates, advisors,
agents or representatives, nor any other person, has made or is making and
neither Parent nor Purchaser nor any person on their behalf relies upon, any
representation or warranty with respect to any estimates, projections,
forecasts, forward-looking information, business plans or cost-related plans
(including the reasonableness of the assumptions underlying such estimates,
projections, forecasts, forward-looking information, business plans or cost-
related plans), except as may be expressly set forth in Article 4 of this
Agreement.

10.5 Parties in Interest. This Agreement shall be binding upon and inure
solely to the benefit of each party hereto, and nothing in this Agreement,
express or implied, is intended to or shall confer upon any other person any
right, benefit or remedy of any nature whatsoever under or by reason of this
Agreement, other than, (i) following the Acceptance Date, the rights of
holders of Company Shares to receive payment for the Company Shares validly
tendered and accepted for payment in the Offer or converted into cash pursuant
to the Merger and the rights of holders of Company Stock Options and other
convertible securities to receive payment pursuant to Section 3.7, (ii) after
the Acceptance Date, Section 7.4 (which is intended to be for the benefit of
the persons covered thereby and may be enforced by such persons) and (iii) the
provisions of this Section 10.5, Section 9.3(f), Section 10.6(d), the proviso
in Section 10.7(a), the last sentence of Section 10.7(b), Section 10.8 and the
final sentence of Section 10.10 are intended to be for the benefit of, and
shall be enforceable by, the Lender Related Parties).

10.6 Specific Performance.

(a) Subject to Section 10.6(c), parties hereto agree that irreparable damage
would occur in the event any provision of this Agreement were not performed in
accordance with the terms hereof and that the parties shall be entitled to an
injunction or injunctions to prevent breaches of this Agreement and to enforce
specifically the terms hereof, in addition to any other remedy at law or
equity, and nothing herein shall be deemed a waiver by any party of any right
to injunctive relief or specific performance. Notwithstanding anything to the
contrary in this Agreement or otherwise, while a party's pursuit of specific
performance at any time shall not be deemed an 

election of remedies or waiver of the right to pursue any other right or
remedy to which such party may be entitled, under no circumstances shall the
Company, directly or indirectly, be permitted or entitled to receive both a
grant of specific performance that results in the Offer or Merger being
consummated, on the one hand, and any monetary damages whatsoever, on the
other hand.

(b) The right to specific enforcement hereunder shall include the right of the
Company to cause Parent and Purchaser to cause the Offer, the Merger and the
other Transactions to be consummated on the terms and subject to the
conditions set forth in this Agreement only in accordance with the express
terms of Section 10.6(c) below. Each of parties to this Agreement further
agrees that no other party or any other person shall be required to obtain,
furnish or post any bond or similar instrument in connection with or as a
condition to obtaining any remedy referred to in this Section 10.6, and each
of the parties to this Agreement irrevocably waives any right it may have to
require the obtaining, furnishing or posting of any such bond or similar
instrument. Each of the parties to this Agreement agree not to raise any
objections to (i) the granting of an injunction, specific performance or other
equitable relief to prevent or restrain breaches or threatened breaches of
this Agreement by the Company, on the one hand, or Parent and Purchaser, on
the other hand and (ii) the specific performance of the terms and provisions
of this Agreement to prevent breaches or threatened breaches of, or to enforce
compliance with, the covenants, obligations and agreements of Parent and
Purchaser pursuant to this Agreement, in each case, on the basis that (A)
either party has an adequate remedy at Law or (B) an award of specific
performance is not an appropriate remedy for any reason at equity or Law, or
any similar grounds.

(c) Notwithstanding the foregoing Section 10.6(a)-(b), it is explicitly agreed
that the right of the Company to obtain an injunction, specific performance or
other equitable remedies in connection with enforcing Parent's or Purchaser's
obligation to fund the Per Share Amount payable in the Offer and the Merger
Consideration and Parent's and Purchaser's obligations to cause the Acceptance
Date to occur and to effect the consummation of the Offer and the Merger
Closing (but not the right of the Company to obtain such injunctions, specific
performance or other equitable remedies for any other reason) shall be subject
to the requirements that (i) (A) with respect to the Offer, all of the Tender
Offer Conditions (other than those conditions that by their nature cannot be
satisfied until the consummation of the Offer, but each of which conditions
shall be capable of being satisfied upon the consummation of the Offer) have
been satisfied by the date the consummation of the Offer is required to have
occurred, or (B) with respect to the Merger, all of the conditions in Sections
8.1 (other than those conditions that by their nature cannot be satisfied
until the Merger Closing Date, but each of which conditions shall be capable
of being satisfied upon the Merger Closing Date) have been satisfied by the
date the Merger Closing is required to have occurred, (ii) Parent and
Purchaser are required to, but fail to, complete the Offer or consummate the
Merger by the date the Offer is required to have occurred or the Merger is
required to be consummated pursuant to this Agreement, (iii) the full amount
of Debt Financing provided for by the Debt Financing Commitment Letters has
been funded or will be funded at the Acceptance Time, and (iv) the Company has
irrevocably confirmed in a written notice delivered to the Parent and
Purchaser that if specific performance is granted and the Debt Financing is
funded, then the consummation of the Offer and the Merger will occur. 

(d) Without limiting the obligations of the Lenders under the Debt Commitment
Letter and the rights of Parent and Purchaser under the Debt Commitment
Letter, the Company acknowledges and agrees (on behalf of itself and the other
Company Related Parties) that no Lender Related Party shall have any liability
or obligation to any Company Related Party in connection with this Agreement
or any Transactions if such Lender Related Party breaches or fails to perform
(whether willfully, intentionally, unintentionally or otherwise) any of its
obligations under the Debt Commitment Letter and the Company (on behalf of
itself and the other Company Related Parties) hereby waives any rights or
claims against each Lender Related Party in connection with this Agreement and
the Debt Financing, whether at law or equity, in contract, in tort or
otherwise, and the Company (on behalf of itself and the other Company Related
Parties) agrees not to commence (and if commenced agrees to dismiss or
otherwise terminate) any action or proceeding against any Lender Related Party
in connection with this Agreement or any Transaction (including any action or
proceeding relating to the Debt Financing). In no event shall any Company
Related Party (or any of the Representatives of the Company) be entitled to
directly seek the remedy of specific performance of this Agreement against any
Lender Related Party, nor shall any Lender Related Party be subject to any
indirect, special, punitive or consequential damages.

10.7 Governing Law.

(a) This Agreement shall be governed and construed in accordance with the laws
of the State of Delaware without regard to any applicable conflicts of law;
provided that, notwithstanding the foregoing, any disputes involving the
Lender Related Parties will be governed by and construed in accordance with
the applicable Laws of the State of New York without giving regard to
conflicts or choice of law principles that would result in the application of
any Law other than the Law of the State of New York.

(b) All actions and proceedings arising out of or relating to this Agreement
shall be heard and determined in the Delaware Court of Chancery, or if no such
state court has proper jurisdiction, then the Federal courts located in the
State of Delaware (collectively, the "Delaware Courts"). The parties hereto
hereby (i) submit to the exclusive jurisdiction of the Delaware Courts for the
purpose of any Action arising out of or relating to this Agreement brought by
any party hereto, and (ii) irrevocably waive, and agree not to assert by way
of motion, defense, or otherwise, in any such Action, any claim that it is not
subject personally to the jurisdiction of the above-named courts, that its
property is exempt or immune from attachment or execution, that the Action is
brought in an inconvenient forum, that the venue of the Action is improper, or
that this Agreement or the Transactions may not be enforced in or by any of
the above-named courts. Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the
contrary, each of the parties agree that it will not bring, or support the
bringing of, any proceeding, claim or counterclaim, whether in law or in
equity, whether arising in contract, tort, equity or otherwise, against the
Lender Related Parties in any way relating to this Agreement or any of the
Transactions, including any dispute arising out of or relating in any way to
the Debt Commitment Letter or the performance thereof, in any forum other than
the Supreme Court of the State of New York, County of New York, or, to the
extent permitted by Law, the United States District Court for the Southern
District of New York in the County of New York (and appellate courts thereof). 

10.8 Waiver of Jury Trial. EACH OF THE PARTIES HERETO HEREBY WAIVES TO THE
FULLEST EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW ANY RIGHT IT MAY HAVE TO A TRIAL BY
JURY WITH RESPECT TO ANY LITIGATION DIRECTLY OR INDIRECTLY ARISING OUT OF,
UNDER OR IN CONNECTION WITH THIS AGREEMENT OR THE TRANSACTIONS (INCLUDING THE
DEBT FINANCING AND THE DEBT COMMITMENT LETTER AND ANY ACTION AGAINST ANY
LENDER RELATED PARTY). Each of the parties hereto (a) certifies that no
representative, agent or attorney of any other party has represented,
expressly or otherwise, that such other party would not, in the event of
litigation, seek to enforce that foregoing waiver and (b) acknowledges that it
and the other hereto have been induced to enter into this Agreement and the
Transactions, as applicable, by, among other things, the mutual waivers and
certifications in this Section 10.8.

10.9 General Interpretation.

(a) The descriptive headings contained in this Agreement are included for
convenience of reference only and shall not affect in any way the meaning or
interpretation of this Agreement.

(b) Unless otherwise indicated, all references herein to Sections, Articles,
Annexes, Exhibits or Schedules shall be deemed to refer to Sections, Articles,
Annexes, Exhibits or Schedules of or to this Agreement, as applicable.

(c) Unless otherwise indicated, the words "include," "includes" and
"including," when used herein, shall be deemed in each case to be followed by
the words "without limitation."

(d) The parties hereto agree that they have been represented by counsel during
the negotiation and execution of this Agreement and, therefore, waive the
application of any law, regulation, holding or rule of construction providing
that ambiguities in an agreement or other document will be construed against
the party drafting such agreement or document.

(e) The phrase "made available to Parent" when used herein, shall mean that
the subject documents were uploaded to the electronic data room maintained by
the Company one (1) business days prior to the execution of this Agreement or
were otherwise provided to Parent.

(f) The phrase "willful and material breach" shall mean a material breach that
is a consequence of an act, or failure to act, undertaken by the breaching
party with the knowledge that the taking of such act, or failure to act,
would, or would be reasonably expected to, result in a material breach of this
Agreement.

10.10 Amendment. This Agreement may be amended by the parties hereto by action
taken by or on behalf of their respective boards of directors at any time
prior to the Effective Time. This Agreement may not be amended except by an
instrument in writing signed by each of the parties hereto. Notwithstanding
anything to the contrary contained herein, no modification, waiver or
termination of Section 9.3(f), Section 10.5, Section 10.6(d), the proviso in
Section 10.7(a), the last sentence of Section 10.7(b), Section 10.8 and this
sentence of Section 10.10 (and any 

provision of this Agreement to the extent a modification, waiver or
termination of such provision would modify the substance of any of the
foregoing provisions) that is adverse to the interests of any Lender Related
Party will be effective against a Lender Related Party without the prior
written consent of such adversely affected Lender Related Party.

10.11 Waiver. At any time prior to the Effective Time, any party hereto may
(a) extend the time for the performance of any obligation or other act of any
other party hereto, (b) waive any inaccuracy in the representations and
warranties of any other party contained herein or in any document delivered
pursuant hereto and (c) waive compliance with any agreement of any other party
or any condition to its own obligations contained herein. Any such extension
or waiver shall be valid if set forth in an instrument in writing signed by
the party or parties to be bound thereby. Notwithstanding the foregoing, no
failure or delay by the Company, Purchaser or Parent in exercising any right
hereunder shall operate as a waiver of rights, nor shall any single or partial
exercise of such rights preclude any other or further exercise of such rights
or the exercise of any other right hereunder.

10.12 Counterparts. This Agreement may be executed and delivered (including by
facsimile or other form of electronic transmission) in one or more
counterparts, and by the different parties hereto in separate counterparts,
each of which when executed shall be deemed to be an original but all of which
taken together shall constitute one and the same agreement. 

IN WITNESS WHEREOF, Parent, Purchaser and the Company have caused this
Agreement to be executed as of the date first written above by their
respective officers thereunto duly authorized.

preliminary or permanent, that is then in effect and has the effect of
restraining, preventing or prohibiting consummation of the Offer or the
Merger;

(b) since the date of the Agreement, there shall have occurred any Effect that
has had, or would reasonably be expected to have, individually or in the
aggregate, a Material Adverse Effect;

(c) (A) the representations and warranties of the Company set forth in this
Agreement, other than 4.3(a) to (e), (f)(ii)(B), (C) and (E) and (g)
(Capitalization), 4.4 (Authority Relative to this Agreement), 4.8(b)(i)
(Absence of Material Adverse Effect and Certain Changes or Events) and 4.19
(Brokers and Expenses), shall not be true and correct (without giving effect
to any qualification as to "materiality" or "Material Adverse Effect" set
forth therein) as of the date of this Agreement and as of immediately prior to
the expiration of the Offer as though made at or as of such time (other than
those representations and warranties that address matters only as of a
particular date or only with respect to a specified period of time, which need
only be true and correct as of such date or with respect to such period),
except where the failure of such representations and warranties to be true and
correct, individually or in the aggregate, has not had and would not
reasonably be expected to have a Material Adverse Effect, (B) the
representations and warranties of the Company set forth in Sections 4.3(a) to
(e), (f)(ii)(B), (C) and (E) and (g) shall not be true and correct in any
respects (except for inaccuracies that would reasonably be expected to result

(d) the Company shall have failed to perform in all material respects the
covenants or agreements of the Company under this Agreement to be performed by
it as of such time and such failure shall not have been cured;

the date of determination signed on its behalf by any of the Company's

(f) the Marketing Period shall not have been completed; or

(g) the Agreement shall have been terminated in accordance with its terms or
the Offer shall have been terminated in accordance with the terms of the

in part at any time and from time to time prior to the expiration of the Offer
in their sole discretion, provided, that the Minimum Condition may not be
waived, in each case, subject to the terms of the Agreement and the rules and
regulations of the SEC. The failure by Parent or Purchaser at any time to
exercise any of the foregoing rights shall not be deemed a waiver of any such
right; the waiver of any such right with respect to particular facts and other
circumstances shall not be deemed a waiver with respect to any other facts and
circumstances; and each such right shall be deemed an ongoing right that may
be asserted at any time and from time to time.

The capitalized terms used in this Annex A shall have the meanings set forth
in the Agreement to which it is attached.
