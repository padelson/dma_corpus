as of October 31, 2006, among Banta Corporation, a Wisconsin corporation (the
" _Company_ "), R.R. Donnelley and Sons Company, a Delaware corporation ("
_Parent_ "), and Soda Acquisition, Inc., a Wisconsin corporation and a wholly
owned subsidiary of Parent (" _Merger Sub_ ," the Company and Merger Sub
sometimes being hereinafter collectively referred to as the " _Constituent
Corporations_ ").

RECITALS

WHEREAS, the respective boards of directors of each of Parent, Merger Sub and
the Company have approved the merger of Merger Sub with and into the Company
(the " _Merger_ ") upon the terms and subject to the conditions set forth in
this Agreement and have approved and declared advisable this Agreement;

WHEREAS, the board of directors of the Company has determined that the Merger
and the other transactions contemplated by this Agreement are in the
best interests of the Companys shareholders and other constituencies; and

WHEREAS, the Company, Parent and Merger Sub desire to make certain
representations, warranties, covenants and agreements in connection with this
Agreement.

NOW, THEREFORE, in consideration of the premises, and of the representations,
warranties, covenants and agreements contained herein, the parties hereto
agree as follows:

_The Merger; Closing; Effective Time_

1.1. _The Merger_. Upon the terms and subject to the conditions set forth in
this Agreement, at the Effective Time (as defined in Section 1.3), Merger Sub
shall be merged with and into the Company and the separate corporate
existence of Merger Sub shall thereupon cease. The Company shall be the
surviving corporation in the Merger (sometimes hereinafter referred to as the
" _Surviving Corporation_ "), and the separate corporate existence of the
Company, with all its rights, privileges, immunities, powers and franchises,
shall continue unaffected by the Merger, except as set forth in Article II.
The Merger shall have the effects specified in the Wisconsin Business
Corporation Law (the " _WBCL_ ").



 

-1- 1.2. _Closing_. Unless otherwise mutually agreed in writing between the
Company and Parent, the closing for the Merger (the " _Closing_ ") shall take
place at the offices of Sullivan and Cromwell LLP, 125 Broad Street, New York,
New York, at 9:00 A.M. on the third business day (the " _Closing Date_
") following the day on which the last to be satisfied or waived of the
conditions set forth in Article VII (other than those conditions that by their
nature are to be satisfied at the Closing, but subject to the fulfillment or
waiver of those conditions) shall be satisfied or waived in accordance with
this Agreement. For purposes of this Agreement, the term " _business day_ "
shall mean any day ending at 11:59 P.M. (Eastern Time) other than a Saturday
or Sunday or a day on which banks are required or authorized to close in the
City of New York.

1.3. _Effective Time_. On the Closing Date the Company and Parent will cause
Articles of Merger specifying that the effective time of the Merger is the
time the Articles of Merger are filed by the Wisconsin Department of Financial
Institutions (the " _Wisconsin Articles of Merger_ ") to be executed,
acknowledged and delivered for filing to the Wisconsin Department of Financial
Institutions as provided in Section 180.1105 of the WBCL. The Merger shall
become effective at the time when the Wisconsin Articles of Merger have
been filed by the Wisconsin Department of Financial Institutions or at such
later time as may be agreed by the parties in writing and specified in the
Wisconsin Articles of Merger (the " _Effective Time_ ").

ARTICLE II

_Articles of Incorporation and Bylaws_

_of the Surviving Corporation_

2.1. _The Articles of Incorporation_. The amended and restated articles of
incorporation of the Company as in effect immediately prior to the Effective
Time shall be the articles of incorporation of the Surviving Corporation (the
" _Charter_ "), until duly amended as provided therein or by applicable Law,
except that Article Fourth of the Charter shall be amended to read in its
entirety as follows: "The aggregate number of shares that this corporation
shall have the authority to issue is 1,000 shares of Common Stock, par value
$1.00 per share."

2.2. _The Bylaws_. The parties hereto shall take all actions necessary so
that the by-laws of the Company in effect immediately prior to the Effective
Time shall be the by-laws of the Surviving Corporation (the " _Bylaws_ "),
until thereafter amended (subject to 6.11(f) with respect to the period prior
to the Effective Time) as provided therein or by applicable Law.



 

-2- ARTICLE III

_Officers and Directors_

_of the Surviving Corporation_

3.1. _Directors_. The parties hereto shall take all actions necessary so that
the directors of Merger Sub at the Effective Time shall, from and after the
Effective Time, be the directors of the Surviving Corporation until their
successors have been duly elected or appointed and qualified or until their
earlier death, resignation or removal in accordance with the Charter and the
Bylaws. 

3.2. _Officers_. The parties hereto shall take all actions necessary so that
the officers of the Company at the Effective Time shall, from and after the
Effective Time, be the officers of the Surviving Corporation until their
successors shall have been duly elected or appointed and qualified or until
their earlier death, resignation or removal in accordance with the Charter
and the Bylaws.

ARTICLE IV

_Effect of the Merger on Capital Stock;_

_Exchange of Certificates_

4.1. _Effect on Capital Stock_. At the Effective Time, as a result of the
Merger and without any action on the part of the holder of any capital stock
of the Company or Merger Sub:

(a) _Merger Consideration_. Each share of the Common Stock, par value $0.10
per share, of the Company (a " _Share_ " or, collectively, the " _Shares_ ")
issued and outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time, other than
Shares owned by Parent, Merger Sub or any other direct or indirect wholly
owned subsidiary of Parent and Shares owned by the Company or any direct or
indirect wholly owned subsidiary of the Company, and in each case not held on
behalf of third parties (each, an " _Excluded Share_ " and collectively, "
_Excluded Shares_ "), shall be converted into the right to receive an amount
in cash equal to $52.50 per Share, _less_ the $16 per share authorized to be
paid by the Company to its shareholders pursuant to the special cash dividend
(the " _Special Dividend_ ") approved by the board of directors of the Company
on September 13, 2006 (the " _Per Share Merger Consideration_ "), _provided_ ,
that the foregoing specifically contemplates that the Effective Time shall
occur after the record date of the Special Dividend. At the Effective Time,
all of the Shares shall cease to be outstanding, shall be cancelled and shall
cease to exist, and each certificate (a " _Certificate_ ") formerly
representing any of the Shares (other than Excluded Shares) shall thereafter
represent only the right to receive the Per Share Merger Consideration,
without interest.

(b) _Cancellation of Shares_. Each Excluded Share referred to in Section
4.1(a) shall, by virtue of the Merger and without any action on the part of
the holder thereof, cease to be outstanding, shall be cancelled without
payment of any consideration therefor and shall cease to exist.



 

-3- (c) _Merger Sub_. At the Effective Time, each share of Common Stock, no par
value, of Merger Sub issued and outstanding immediately prior to the
Effective Time shall be converted into one share of common stock, par value
$1.00 per share, of the Surviving Corporation.

4.2. _Exchange of Certificates_.

(a)  _Paying Agent_. At or prior to the Effective Time, Parent shall deposit,
or shall cause to be deposited, with a paying agent selected by Parent with
the Companys prior approval (such approval not to be unreasonably withheld or
delayed) (the " _Paying Agent_ "), for the benefit of the holders of Shares,
a cash amount in immediately available funds necessary for the Paying Agent to
make payments under Section 4.1(a) (such cash being hereinafter referred to as
the " _Exchange Fund_ "). The Paying Agent shall invest the Exchange Fund as
directed by Parent, _provided_ that such investments shall be in obligations
of or guaranteed by the United States of America, in commercial paper
obligations rated A-1 or P-1 or better by Moodys Investors Service, Inc. or
Standard and Poors Corporation, respectively, or in certificates of deposit,
bank repurchase agreements or bankers acceptances of commercial banks with
capital exceeding $1 billion or in a mutual fund that invests only in such
permitted investments. Any interest and other income resulting from such
investment shall become a part of the Exchange Fund, and any amounts in excess
of the amounts payable under Section 4.1(a) shall be promptly returned to
Parent.

(b) _Exchange Procedures_. Promptly after the Effective Time (and in
any event within three business days), the Surviving Corporation shall cause
the Paying Agent to mail to each holder of record of Shares (other than
holders of Excluded Shares) (i) a letter of transmittal in customary form
specifying that delivery shall be effected, and risk of loss and title to the
Certificates shall pass, only upon delivery of the Certificates (or affidavits
of loss in lieu thereof as provided in Section 4.2(e)) to the Paying Agent,
such letter of transmittal to be in such form and have such other provisions
as Parent and the Company may reasonably agree, and (ii) instructions for use
in effecting the surrender of the Certificates (or affidavits of loss in lieu
thereof as provided in Section 4.2(e)) in exchange for the Per Share Merger
Consideration. Upon surrender of a Certificate (or affidavit of loss in lieu
thereof as provided in Section 4.2(e)) to the Paying Agent in accordance with
the terms of such letter of transmittal, duly executed, the holder of such
Certificate shall be entitled to receive in exchange therefor a cash amount in
immediately available funds (after giving effect to any required tax
withholdings as provided in Section 4.2(f)) equal to (x) the number of Shares
represented by such Certificate (or affidavit of loss in lieu thereof as
provided in Section 4.2(e)) multiplied by (y) the Per Share Merger
Consideration, and the Certificate so surrendered shall forthwith be
cancelled. No interest will be paid or accrued on any amount payable upon due
surrender of the Certificates. In the event of a transfer of ownership of
Shares that is not registered



 

-4- in the transfer records of the Company, a check for any cash to be exchanged
upon due surrender of the Certificate may be issued to such transferee if the
Certificate formerly representing such Shares is presented to the Paying
Agent, accompanied by all documents reasonably required to evidence and effect
such transfer and to evidence that any applicable stock transfer taxes have
been paid or are not applicable.

(c) _Transfers_. From and after the Effective Time, there shall be no
transfers on the stock transfer books of the Company of the Shares that were
outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time. If, after the Effective
Time, any Certificate is presented to the Surviving Corporation, Parent or the
Paying Agent for transfer, it shall be cancelled and exchanged for the cash
amount in immediately available funds to which the holder thereof is entitled
pursuant to this Article IV.

(d) _Termination of Exchange Fund_. Any portion of the Exchange Fund
(including the proceeds of any investments thereof) that remains unclaimed by
the shareholders of the Company for 180 days after the Effective Time shall
be delivered to the Surviving Corporation. Any holder of Shares (other than
Excluded Shares) who has not theretofore complied with this Article IV shall
thereafter look only to the Surviving Corporation for payment of the Per
Share Merger Consideration (after giving effect to any required tax
withholdings as provided in Section 4.2(f)) upon due surrender of its
Certificates (or affidavits of loss in lieu thereof), without any interest
thereon. Notwithstanding the foregoing, none of the Surviving Corporation,
Parent, the Paying Agent or any other Person shall be liable to any former
holder of Shares for any amount properly delivered to a public official
pursuant to applicable abandoned property, escheat or similar Laws. For the
purposes of this Agreement, the term " _Person_ " shall mean any individual,
corporation (including not-for-profit), general or limited partnership,
limited liability company, joint venture, estate, trust, association,
organization, Governmental Entity (as defined in Section 5.1(d)) or other
entity of any kind or nature.

(e) _Lost, Stolen or Destroyed Certificates_. In the event any Certificate
shall have been lost, stolen or destroyed, upon the making of an affidavit of
that fact by the Person claiming such Certificate to be lost, stolen or
destroyed and, if required by Parent, the posting by such Person of a bond in
customary amount and upon such terms as may be reasonably required by Parent
as indemnity against any claim that may be made against it or the Surviving
Corporation with respect to such Certificate, the Paying Agent will issue a
check in the amount (after giving effect to any required tax withholdings)
equal to the number of Shares represented by such lost, stolen or destroyed
Certificate multiplied by the Per Share Merger Consideration. 

(f) _Withholding Rights_. Each of Parent and the Surviving Corporation shall
be entitled to deduct and withhold from the consideration otherwise payable
pursuant to this Agreement to any holder of Shares such amounts as it is
required to deduct and withhold with respect to the making of such payment
under the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the " _Code_ "), or any
other applicable state, local or foreign Tax (as defined in Section 5.1(n))
Law. To the extent that amounts are so



 

-5- withheld by the Surviving Corporation or Parent, as the case may be, such
withheld amounts (i) shall be remitted by Parent or the Surviving
Corporation, as applicable, to the applicable Governmental Entity, and (ii)
shall be treated for all purposes of this Agreement as having been paid to the
holder of Shares in respect of which such deduction and withholding was made
by the Surviving Corporation or Parent, as the case may be.

4.3. _Treatment of Stock Plans_.

(a) _Treatment of Options_. At the Effective Time each outstanding option to
purchase Shares (a " _Company Option_ ") under the Stock Plans (as defined in
Section 5.1(b)), vested or unvested, shall be cancelled and shall only entitle
the holder thereof to receive, as soon as reasonably practicable after the
Effective Time (and in any event, within two business days after
the Effective Time), an amount in cash equal to the product of (x) the total
number of Shares subject to the Company Option times (y) the excess, if any,
of the value of the Per Share Merger Consideration over the exercise price per
Share under such Company Option, less applicable Taxes required to be
withheld with respect to such payment.

(b) _Treatment of Restricted Shares_. All awards granting restricted Shares
from Company that have not vested (collectively, " _Restricted Shares_ ")
heretofore granted under the Stock Plans shall, immediately prior to the
Effective Time, become fully vested and without further restrictions with
respect to ownership rights thereto, thereby causing all Restricted Shares to
become Shares that are converted into the right to receive the Per Share
Merger Consideration as provided in Section 4.1(a). 

(c) _Company Awards_. At the Effective Time, each right of any kind,
contingent or accrued, to acquire or receive Shares or benefits measured by
the value of Shares, and each award of any kind consisting of Shares that may
be held, awarded, outstanding, payable or reserved for issuance under the
Stock Plans and any other Benefit Plans, other than Company Options and
Restricted Shares (the " _Company Awards_ "), shall be cancelled and shall
only entitle the holder thereof to receive, an amount in cash equal to (x) the
number of Shares subject to such Company Award immediately prior to the
Effective Time times (y) the value of the Per Share Merger Consideration (or,
if the Company Award provides for payments to the extent the value of the
Shares exceed a specified reference price, the amount, if any, by which the
value of the Per Share Merger Consideration exceeds such reference price),
less applicable Taxes required to be withheld with respect to such payment.

(d) _Corporate Actions_. At or prior to the Effective Time, the Company, the
Companys board of directors and the compensation committee of the board of
directors of the Company, as applicable, shall, subject to Section 4.3(d) of
the Company Disclosure Letter, adopt any resolutions and take any actions
which are necessary to effectuate the provisions of Section 4.3(a), 4.3(b) and
4.3(c). Subject to Section 4.3(d) of the Company Disclosure Letter, the
Company shall take all actions



 

-6- necessary to ensure that from and after the Effective Time neither Parent nor
the Surviving Corporation will be required to deliver Shares or other capital
stock of the Company to any Person pursuant to or in settlement of Company
Options, Restricted Shares or Company Awards.

4.4. _Adjustments to Prevent Dilution_. Other than in respect of the Special
Dividend, in the event that, between the date of this Agreement and the
Effective Time, the Company changes the number of Shares or securities
convertible or exchangeable into or exercisable for Shares issued and
outstanding prior to the Effective Time as a result of a reclassification,
stock split (including a reverse stock split), stock dividend or
distribution, recapitalization, merger, issuer tender or exchange offer, or
other similar transaction, the Per Share Merger Consideration shall be
equitably adjusted to provide the holders of the Shares, the Company Options,
the Restricted Shares and the Company Awards with the same economic effect as
contemplated by this Agreement prior to such event. In addition, the parties
hereto agree that the exercise price of, and the number of Shares subject to,
the Company Options shall be adjusted in the manner set forth in the
resolutions of the compensation committee of the board of directors of the
Company adopted on September 13, 2006 to take into account the Special
Dividend.

ARTICLE V

_Representations and Warranties_

5.1. _Representations and Warranties of the Company_. Except as set forth on
the face of the Company Reports (excluding from such Company Reports any
"Risk Factors" or similar sections) filed or furnished after December 31, 2005
and prior to the date of this Agreement or in corresponding sections of the
disclosure letter delivered to Parent by the Company prior to entering
into this Agreement (the " _Company Disclosure Letter_ ") (which Company
Disclosure Letter sets forth, among other things, items the disclosure of
which is necessary or appropriate in response to an express disclosure
requirement contained in this Section 5.1, as an exception to one or more
representations or warranties contained in this Section 5.1 or in response to
one or more of the Companys covenants contained in this Agreement; _provided_
, _however_ , that notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this
Agreement, (x) disclosure of any item in any section of the Company Disclosure
Letter shall be deemed disclosure with respect to any other section to which
the relevance of such item is reasonably apparent, and (y) the mere inclusion
of an item in the Company Disclosure Letter as an exception to a
representation or warranty shall not be deemed an admission that such item
represents a material exception or a material fact, event or circumstance or
that such item has had or would reasonably be expected to have a Company
Material Adverse Effect), the Company hereby represents and warrants to Parent
and Merger Sub that:

(a) _Organization, Good Standing and Qualification_. Each of the Company and
its Subsidiaries is a legal entity duly organized, validly existing and in



 

-7- good standing under the Laws of its respective jurisdiction of organization
and has all requisite corporate or similar power and authority to own, lease
and operate its properties and assets and to carry on its business as
presently conducted and is qualified to do business and is in good standing as
a foreign corporation (or other applicable entity) in each jurisdiction where
the ownership, leasing or operation of its assets or properties or conduct of
its business requires such qualification, except where the failure to be so
organized, validly existing, qualified or in good standing, or to have
such power or authority, would not, individually or in the aggregate,
reasonably be expected to have a Company Material Adverse Effect. The Company
has made available to Parent complete and correct copies of the Companys and
its Significant Subsidiaries certificates of incorporation and by-laws or
comparable governing documents, each as amended to the date hereof, and each
as so delivered is in full force and effect. As used in this Agreement, the
term (i) " _Subsidiary_ " means, with respect to any Person, any other Person
of which at least a majority of the securities or ownership interests having
by their terms ordinary voting power to elect a majority of the board
of directors or other persons performing similar functions is directly or
indirectly owned or controlled by such Person _and_ / _or_ by one or more of
its Subsidiaries, (ii) " _Significant Subsidiary_ " is as defined in Rule
1.02(w) of Regulation S-X promulgated pursuant to the Securities Exchange Act
of 1934, as amended (the " _Exchange Act_ ") and (iii) " _Company Material
Adverse Effect_ " means a material adverse effect on the financial condition,
properties, assets, liabilities, business or results of operations of the
Company and its Subsidiaries taken as a whole; _provided_ , _however_ , that
to the extent any effect is caused by or results from any of the following it
shall not be taken into account in determining whether there has been a
Company Material Adverse Effect:

(A) changes in the political conditions, economies or financial markets
generally in the United States or other countries, including the commencement,
continuation or escalation of any war, armed hostilities or acts of terrorism;

(B) changes that are the result of factors generally affecting the industries
and geographic areas in which the Company or any of its Subsidiaries
operates;

(C) any loss of, or adverse change in, the relationship of the Company with
its customers, employees or suppliers that the Company establishes through
specific evidence was proximately caused by the pendency or the announcement
of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement;

(D) changes in the market price of raw materials, including paper, of the type
and grade customarily purchased by the Company and its Subsidiaries;

(E) changes in United States generally accepted accounting principles ("
_GAAP_ ") after the date hereof, in the rules or policies of the Public



 

-8- Company Accounting Oversight Board, in Laws of general applicability or in
interpretations thereof by courts or other Governmental Entities, in each
case, after the date hereof;

(F) any failure by the Company to meet any estimates of revenues or earnings
for any period ending on or after the date of this Agreement and prior to the
Closing, _provided_ that the exception in this clause shall not prevent or
otherwise affect a determination that any change, effect, circumstance or
development underlying such failure has resulted in, or contributed to, a
Company Material Adverse Effect; and

(G) a decline in the price of the Shares on the New York Stock Exchange (the "
_NYSE_ "), including any decline related to the Special Dividend, _provided_
that the exception in this clause shall not prevent or otherwise affect a
determination that any change, effect, circumstance or development underlying
such decline has resulted in, or contributed to, a Company Material Adverse
Effect;

_provided_ , _further_ , that, with respect to clauses (A), (B), (D) and (E),
such change, event, circumstance or development does not disproportionately
adversely affect the Company and its Subsidiaries in any material respect
compared to other companies of similar size operating in the industries in
which the Company and its Subsidiaries operate.

(b) _Capital Structure_.

(i) The authorized capital stock of the Company consists of 75,000,000
Shares, of which 24,340,155 Shares were outstanding as of the close of
business on October 27, 2006 and 300,000 shares of preferred stock, par value
$10.00 per share, of which no shares are outstanding. All of the
outstanding Shares have been duly authorized and are validly issued, fully
paid and nonassessable (except for any liability that may be imposed on
shareholders by former Section 180.0622(2)(b) of the WBCL, as judicially
interpreted, for debts incurred prior to June 14, 2006). Other than 3,150,723
Shares reserved for issuance under the Companys 2005 Equity Incentive Plan,
1991 Stock Option Plan and Equity Incentive Plan (the " _Stock Plans_ "),
Shares subject to issuance under the Rights Agreement and Shares subject to
issuance under the Banta Corporation Incentive Savings Plan and the Banta
Hourly 401(k) Plan (the " _401(k) Plans_ "), the Company has no Shares subject
to issuance. Section 5.1(b)(i) of the Company Disclosure Letter contains a
correct and complete list of options, restricted stock, restricted stock
units, stock appreciation rights and any other rights with respect to the
Shares under the Stock Plans, including the holder, number of Shares and,
where applicable, exercise price. Each of the outstanding shares of capital
stock or other equity securities of each of the Companys Subsidiaries is duly
authorized, validly issued, fully paid and nonassessable (except for any
liability that may be imposed on shareholders by



 

-9- former Section 180.0622(2)(b) of the WBCL, as judicially interpreted, for
debts incurred prior to June 14, 2006) and owned by the Company or by a
direct or indirect wholly owned Subsidiary of the Company, free and clear of
any lien, charge, pledge, security interest, claim or other encumbrance (each,
a " _Lien_ "). Except as set forth above, including Section 5.1(b)(i) of the
Company Disclosure Letter, and except for the rights (the " _Rights_ ") that
have been issued pursuant to the Rights Agreement, dated as of November 5,
2001, as amended, between the Company and American Stock Transfer and Trust
Company (the " _Rights Agreement_ "), there are no preemptive or other
outstanding rights, options, warrants, conversion rights, stock appreciation
rights, redemption rights, repurchase rights, agreements, arrangements,
calls, commitments or rights of any kind that obligate the Company or any of
its Subsidiaries to issue or sell any shares of capital stock or other equity
securities of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries or any securities or
obligations convertible or exchangeable into or exercisable for, or giving any
Person a right to subscribe for or acquire, any securities of the Company or
any of its Subsidiaries, and no securities or obligations evidencing such
rights are authorized, issued or outstanding. Upon any issuance of any Shares
in accordance with the terms of the Stock Plans, such Shares will be duly
authorized, validly issued, fully paid and nonassessable and free and clear
of any Liens imposed or created by the Company (except for any liability that
may be imposed on shareholders by former Section 180.0622(2)(b) of the WBCL,
as judicially interpreted, for debts incurred prior to June 14, 2006). The
Company does not have outstanding any bonds, debentures, notes or other
obligations the holders of which have the right to vote (or convertible into
or exercisable for securities having the right to vote) with the shareholders
of the Company on any matter. 

(ii) Section 5.1(b)(ii) of the Company Disclosure Letter sets forth (x) each
of the Companys Subsidiaries and the ownership interest of the Company in
each such Subsidiary, as well as the ownership interest of any other Person or
Persons in each such Subsidiary and (y) the Companys or its Subsidiaries
capital stock, equity interest or other direct or indirect ownership interest
in any other Person other than securities in a publicly traded company held
for investment by the Company or any of its Subsidiaries and consisting of
less than 1% of the outstanding capital stock of such company. The Company
does not own, directly or indirectly, any voting interest in any Person (not
taking into account any voting interest owned, directly or indirectly, by
Parent in any Person) that requires an additional filing by Parent under
the Hart-Scott-Rodino Antitrust Improvements Act of 1976, as amended (the "
_HSR Act_").

(iii) Each Company Option (A) was granted in compliance with all applicable
Laws and all of the terms and conditions of the Stock Plans pursuant to which
it was issued, (B) has an exercise price per Share equal to or greater than
the fair market value of a Share at the close of business on the date of such
grant, (C) has a grant date identical to the date on which the Companys board
of



 

-10- directors or compensation committee actually awarded such Company Option, and
(D) qualifies for the tax and accounting treatment afforded to such Company
Option in the Companys tax returns and the Companys financial statements,
respectively.

(c) _Corporate Authority; Approval and Fairness_.

(i) The Company has all requisite corporate power and authority and has taken
all corporate action necessary in order to execute, deliver and perform its
obligations under this Agreement and to consummate the Merger, subject only to
approval of this Agreement by the holders of two-thirds of the voting power
of the outstanding Shares entitled to vote on such matter at a shareholders
meeting duly called and held for such purpose (the " _Company Requisite Vote_
"). This Agreement has been duly executed and delivered by the Company and
constitutes a valid and binding agreement of the Company enforceable against
the Company in accordance with its terms, subject to bankruptcy, insolvency,
fraudulent transfer, reorganization, moratorium and similar Laws of general
applicability relating to or affecting creditors rights and to general equity
principles (the " _Bankruptcy and Equity Exception_ ").

(ii) The board of directors of the Company has (A) unanimously determined that
the Merger is fair to, and in the best interests of, the Company, its
shareholders and other constituencies, adopted and approved this Agreement and
the Merger and the other transactions contemplated hereby and resolved to
recommend approval of this Agreement to the holders of Shares (the " _Company
Recommendation_ "), (B) directed that this Agreement be submitted to the
holders of Shares for their approval and (C) received the opinion of its
financial advisor, UBS Securities LLC, to the effect that the consideration
to be received by the holders of the Shares in the Merger is fair, from a
financial point of view, as of the date of such opinion, to such holders
(other than Parent and its Affiliates or Subsidiaries).

(d) _Governmental Filings; No Violations; Certain Contracts_.

(i) Other than the filings and/or notices pursuant to Section 1.3 and under
the HSR Act, Council Regulation (EC) No. 139/2004 (the " _ECMR_ "), if
applicable, any other Antitrust Laws or the Exchange Act (the " _Company
Approvals_ "), no notices, reports or other filings are required to be made by
the Company with, nor are any consents, registrations, approvals, permits or
authorizations required to be obtained by the Company from, any domestic or
foreign governmental or regulatory authority, agency, commission, body, court
or other legislative, executive or judicial governmental entity (each a "
_Governmental Entity_ "), in connection with the execution, delivery and
performance of this Agreement by the Company and the consummation of the
Merger and the other transactions contemplated hereby, except those that the
failure to make or obtain



 

-11- would not, individually or in the aggregate, reasonably be expected to have a
Company Material Adverse Effect or prevent, materially delay or materially
impair the consummation of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement. As
used herein, " _Antitrust Laws_ " means the Sherman Act of 1890, the Clayton
Act of 1914, the HSR Act and all other Laws, and administrative and judicial
doctrines that are designed or intended to prohibit, restrict or regulate
actions having the purpose or effect of monopolization or restraint of trade.

(ii) The execution, delivery and performance of this Agreement by the Company
do not, and the consummation of the Merger and the other transactions
contemplated hereby will not, constitute or result in (A) a breach or
violation of, or a default under, the Charter or Bylaws of the Company or the
comparable governing instruments of any of its Subsidiaries, (B) with
or without notice, lapse of time or both, a breach or violation of, a
termination (or right of termination) or a default under, the creation or
acceleration of any obligations or the creation of a Lien on any of the assets
of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries pursuant to any agreement, lease,
license, contract, note, mortgage, indenture, arrangement or other obligation
(each, a " _Contract_ ") binding upon the Company or any of its Subsidiaries
or, assuming (solely with respect to performance of this Agreement and
consummation of the Merger and the other transactions contemplated hereby)
compliance with the matters referred to in Section 5.1(d)(i), under any Law to
which the Company or any of its Subsidiaries is subject, or (C) any change in
the rights or obligations of any party under any Contract binding on the
Company or any of its Subsidiaries, except, in the case of clause (B) or (C)
above, for any such breach, violation, termination, default, creation,
acceleration or change that, individually or in the aggregate, would not
reasonably be expected to have a Company Material Adverse Effect or prevent,
materially delay or materially impair the consummation of the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement. Section 5.1(d)(ii) of the
Company Disclosure Letter sets forth a correct and complete list of Material
Contracts (as defined in Section 5.1(j)(i)(L)) pursuant to which consents or
waivers are or may be required prior to consummation of the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement (whether or not subject to the exception set
forth with respect to clauses (B) and (C) above).

(iii) The Company and its Subsidiaries are not creditors or claimants with
respect to any debtors or debtor-in-possession subject to proceedings under
chapter 11 of title 11 of the United States Code with respect to claims that,
in the aggregate, constitute more than 25% of the gross assets of the Company
and its Subsidiaries taken as a whole (excluding cash and cash equivalents).

(e) _Company Reports; Financial Statements_.

(i) The Company has filed or furnished, as applicable, on a timely basis, all
forms, statements, certifications, reports and documents required to be filed
or furnished by it with the Securities and Exchange Commission (the " _SEC_ ")



 

-12- under the Exchange Act or the Securities Act of 1933, as amended (the "
_Securities Act_ ") since December 31, 2003 (the " _Applicable Date_ ") (the
forms, statements, reports and documents filed or furnished since the
Applicable Date and those filed or furnished subsequent to the date hereof,
including any amendments thereto, the " _Company Reports_ "). Each of the
Company Reports, at the time of its filing or being furnished complied or, if
not yet filed or furnished, will comply in all material respects with the
applicable requirements of the Securities Act, the Exchange Act and the
Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 (the " _Sarbanes-Oxley Act_ "), and any rules and
regulations promulgated thereunder applicable to the Company Reports. As of
their respective dates (or, if amended prior to the date hereof, as of the
date of such amendment), the Company Reports did not, and any Company Reports
filed or furnished with the SEC subsequent to the date hereof will not,
contain any untrue statement of a material fact or omit to state a material
fact required to be stated therein or necessary to make the statements made
therein, in light of the circumstances in which they were made, not
misleading, _provided_ , that the Company makes no representation or
warranty regarding any information provided in writing by Parent or any of
its Subsidiaries for inclusion in such Company Reports filed after the date
hereof.

(ii) The Company is in compliance in all material respects with the applicable
listing and corporate governance rules and regulations of the NYSE. For
purposes of this Agreement, the term " _Affiliate_ " when used with respect
to any party shall mean any Person who is an "affiliate" of that party within
the meaning of Rule 405 promulgated under the Securities Act.

(iii) The Company maintains disclosure controls and procedures required by
Rule 13a-15 or 15d-15 under the Exchange Act. The Company has evaluated the
effectiveness of the Companys disclosure controls and procedures and, to the
extent required by applicable Law, presented in any applicable Company Report
or any amendment thereto its conclusions about the effectiveness of the
disclosure controls and procedures as of the end of the period covered by such
Report or amendment based on such evaluation. The Company maintains internal
control over financial reporting (as defined in Rule 13a-15 or 15d-15, as
applicable, under the Exchange Act). The Company has evaluated the
effectiveness of the Companys internal control over financial reporting and,
to the extent required by applicable Law, presented in any applicable Company
Report or any amendment thereto its conclusions about the effectiveness of
the internal control over financial reporting as of the end of the period
covered by such Report or amendment based on such evaluation. The Company has
disclosed, based on the most recent evaluation of its chief executive officer
and its chief financial officer prior to the date hereof, to the Companys
auditors and the audit committee of the Companys board of directors (A) any
significant deficiencies in the design or operation of its internal controls
over financial reporting that are reasonably expected to adversely affect the
Companys ability to record, process, summarize and report financial
information and has identified



 

-13- for the Companys auditors and audit committee of the Companys board of
directors any material weaknesses in internal control over financial
reporting and (B) any fraud, whether or not material, that involves management
or other employees who have a significant role in the Companys internal
control over financial reporting. The Company has made available to Parent
(x) a summary of any such disclosure made by management to the Companys
auditors and audit committee since the Applicable Date and (y) any
communication since the Applicable Date made by management or the Companys
auditors to the audit committee required or contemplated by listing standards
of the NYSE, the audit committees charter or professional standards of the
Public Company Accounting Oversight Board. Since the Applicable Date, no
material complaints from any source regarding accounting, internal accounting
controls or auditing matters have been received by the Company. The Company
has made available to Parent a summary of all complaints or concerns relating
to other matters made since the Applicable Date through the Companys
whistleblower hot line or equivalent system for receipt of employee concerns
regarding possible violations of Law. No attorney representing the Company or
any of its Subsidiaries, whether or not employed by the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries, has reported evidence of a violation of securities Laws, breach
of fiduciary duty or similar violation by the Company or any of its officers,
directors, employees or agents to the Companys chief legal officer, audit
committee (or other committee designated for the purpose) of the board of
directors or the board of directors pursuant to the rules adopted pursuant to
Section 307 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act or any Company policy contemplating
such reporting, including in instances not required by those rules.

(iv) Each of the consolidated balance sheets included in or incorporated by
reference into the Company Reports (including the related notes and schedules)
fairly presents, or, in the case of Company Reports filed after the date
hereof, will fairly present in all material respects the consolidated
financial position of the Company and its consolidated Subsidiaries as of its
date and each of the consolidated statements of income, changes in
shareholders equity (deficit) and cash flows included in or incorporated by
reference into the Company Reports (including any related notes and schedules)
fairly presents, or in the case of Company Reports filed after the date
hereof, will fairly present in all material respects the results of
operations, retained earnings (loss) and changes in financial position, as
the case may be, of the Company and its consolidated Subsidiaries for the
periods set forth therein (subject, in the case of unaudited statements, to
notes and normal year-end audit adjustments that will not be material in
amount or effect), in each case in accordance with GAAP (except, in the case
of unaudited statements, as permitted by Form 10-Q) consistently applied
during the periods involved, except as may be noted therein.

(f) _Absence of Certain Changes_. Since December 31, 2005 until the date
hereof, the Company and its Subsidiaries have conducted their respective
businesses



 

-14- only in, and have not engaged in any material transaction other than according
to, the ordinary and usual course of such businesses consistent with past
practices in all material respects, and there has not been:

(i) any change in the financial condition, properties, assets, liabilities,
business or results of their operations or any circumstance, occurrence or
development (including any adverse change with respect to any circumstance,
occurrence or development existing on or prior to December 31, 2005) of which
management of the Company has knowledge which, individually or in the
aggregate, is reasonably expected to have a Company Material Adverse Effect;

(ii) any material damage, destruction or other casualty loss with respect to
any material asset or property owned, leased or otherwise used by the Company
or any of its Subsidiaries, whether or not covered by insurance;

(iii) other than regular quarterly dividends on Shares of $0.18 per Share and
the Special Dividend, any declaration, setting aside or payment of any
dividend or other distribution with respect to any shares of capital stock of
the Company or any of its Subsidiaries (except for dividends or other
distributions by any direct or indirect wholly owned Subsidiary to the Company
or to any wholly owned Subsidiary of the Company), or any repurchase,
redemption or other acquisition by the Company or any of its Subsidiaries of
any outstanding shares of capital stock or other securities of the Company or
any of its Subsidiaries;

(iv) any material change in any method of accounting or accounting practice
by the Company or any of its Subsidiaries, except as required by GAAP, the
rules or policies of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board or
applicable Law;

(v) (A) any increase in the compensation payable or to become payable to its
officers or employees (except for increases for employees or officers who are
not set forth on Schedule 5.1(f)(v)(A) of the Company Disclosure Letter in the
ordinary course of business and consistent with past practice) or (B) any
establishment, adoption, entry into or amendment of any collective
bargaining, employment, termination or severance agreement or any material
bonus, profit sharing, thrift, compensation or other plan, agreement, trust,
fund, policy or arrangement for the benefit of any director, officer or
employee, except to the extent required by applicable Laws; or

(vi) any agreement to do any of the foregoing.

As used in this Agreement, the term "knowledge" when used in the phrases "to
the knowledge of management of the Company," "of which management of the
Company has knowledge" or "the Company has no knowledge" or words of similar
import shall mean the actual knowledge of the Persons listed in Section 5.1(f)
of the Company Disclosure Letter, after reasonable inquiry.



 

-15- (g) _Litigation and Liabilities_. There are no (i) civil, criminal or
administrative actions, suits, claims, hearings, arbitrations, investigations
or other proceedings pending or, to the knowledge of management of the
Company, threatened against the Company or any of its Subsidiaries or (ii)
obligations or liabilities undisclosed as of the date hereof of the Company
or any of its Subsidiaries, whether or not accrued, contingent or otherwise
and whether or not required to be disclosed, or any other facts or
circumstances undisclosed as of the date hereof of which management of
the Company have knowledge that could reasonably be expected to result in any
claims against, or obligations or liabilities of, the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries, except for those that would not, individually or in the
aggregate, reasonably be expected to have a Company Material Adverse Effect
or prevent, materially delay or materially impair the consummation of the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement. Neither the Company nor any of
its Subsidiaries is a party to or subject to the provisions of any judgment,
order, writ, injunction, decree or award of any Governmental Entity which is,
individually or in the aggregate, reasonably expected to have a Company
Material Adverse Effect or prevent, materially delay or materially impair the
consummation of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement.

(h) _Employee Benefits_.

(i) All benefit and compensation plans, contracts, policies or arrangements
covering current or former employees of the Company and its subsidiaries (the
" _Employees_ ") and current or former directors of the Company, including,
but not limited to, "employee benefit plans" within the meaning of Section
3(3) of the Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974, as amended ("
_ERISA_ "), and deferred compensation, severance, stock option, stock
purchase, stock appreciation rights, stock based, incentive and bonus plans
(the " _Benefit Plans_ "), other than Benefit Plans maintained outside of the
United States primarily for the benefit of Employees working outside of the
United States (such plans hereinafter being referred to as " _Non-U.S. Benefit
Plans_ "), are listed on Schedule 5.1(h)(i) of the Company Disclosure Letter,
and each Benefit Plan which has received a favorable opinion letter from the
Internal Revenue Service National Office, including any master or prototype
plan, has been separately identified. True and complete copies of all Benefit
Plans listed on Schedule 5.1(h)(i) of the Company Disclosure Letter,
including, but not limited to, any trust instruments, insurance contracts and,
with respect to any employee stock ownership plan, loan agreements forming a
part of any Benefit Plans, and all amendments thereto have been provided or
made available to Parent.

(ii) All Benefit Plans, other than "multiemployer plans" within the meaning
of Section 3(37) of ERISA (each, a " _Multiemployer Plan_ ") and Non U.S.
Benefit Plans, (collectively, " _U.S. Benefit Plans_ ") are in
substantial compliance with ERISA, the Code and other applicable Laws. Each
U.S. Benefit Plan which is subject to ERISA (an " _ERISA Plan_ ") that is an
"employee pension benefit plan" within the meaning of Section 3(2) of ERISA
(a " _Pension Plan_ ") intended



 

-16- to be qualified under Section 401(a) of the Code, has received a favorable
determination letter from the Internal Revenue Service (the " _IRS_ ")
covering all tax law changes prior to the Economic Growth and Tax Relief
Reconciliation Act of 2001 or has applied to the IRS for such favorable
determination letter within the applicable remedial amendment period under
Section 401(b) of the Code, and the Company is not aware of any circumstances
likely to result in the loss of the qualification of such Plan under Section
401(a) of the Code. Neither the Company nor any of its Subsidiaries maintains
any voluntary employees beneficiary association within the meaning of Section
501(c)(9) of the Code. Neither the Company nor any of its Subsidiaries has
engaged in a transaction with respect to any ERISA Plan that, assuming the
taxable period of such transaction expired as of the date hereof, could
subject the Company or any Subsidiary to a tax or penalty imposed by either
Section 4975 of the Code or Section 502(i) of ERISA in an amount which would
be material. Neither the Company nor any of its Subsidiaries has incurred or
reasonably expects to incur a material tax or penalty imposed by Section 4980F
of the Code or Section 502 of ERISA or any material liability under Section
4071 of ERISA.

(iii) No liability under Subtitle C or D of Title IV of ERISA has been or is
expected to be incurred by the Company or any of its Subsidiaries with
respect to any ongoing, frozen or terminated "single-employer plan", within
the meaning of Section 4001(a)(15) of ERISA, currently or formerly maintained
by any of them, or the single-employer plan of any entity which is considered
one employer with the Company under Section 4001 of ERISA or Section 414 of
the Code (an " _ERISA Affiliate_ "). The Company and its Subsidiaries have not
incurred any withdrawal liability with respect to a Multiemployer Plan under
Subtitle E of Title IV of ERISA (regardless of whether based on contributions
of an ERISA Affiliate) that has not been fully paid, and do not expect to
incur any such liability in the foreseeable future. No notice of a
"reportable event", within the meaning of Section 4043 of ERISA for which the
reporting requirement has not been waived or extended, other than pursuant to
Pension Benefit Guaranty Corporation (" _PBGC_ ") Reg. Section 4043.33 or
4043.66, has been required to be filed for any Pension Plan or by any ERISA
Affiliate within the 12-month period ending on the date hereof or will be
required to be filed in connection with the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement. No notices have been required to be sent to participants and
beneficiaries or the PBGC under Section 302 or 4011 of ERISA or Section 412 of
the Code.

(iv) All contributions required to be made under each Benefit Plan, as of the
date hereof, have been timely made and all obligations in respect of each
Benefit Plan have been properly accrued and reflected in the most recent
consolidated balance sheet filed or incorporated by reference in the Company
Reports prior to the date hereof. Neither any Pension Plan nor any single-
employer plan of an ERISA Affiliate has an "accumulated funding deficiency"
(whether or not waived) within the meaning of Section 412 of the Code or



 

-17- Section 302 of ERISA and no ERISA Affiliate has an outstanding funding waiver.
Neither any Pension Plan nor any single-employer plan of an ERISA Affiliate
has been required to file information pursuant to Section 4010 of ERISA for
the current or most recently completed plan year. It is not reasonably
anticipated that required minimum contributions to any Pension Plan under
Section 412 of the Code will be materially increased by application of Section
412(l) of the Code. Neither the Company nor any of its Subsidiaries has
provided, or is required to provide, security to any Pension Plan or to any
single-employer plan of an ERISA Affiliate pursuant to Section 401(a)(29) of
the Code.

(v) Under each Pension Plan which is a single-employer plan, as of the last
day of the most recent plan year ended prior to the date hereof, the
actuarially determined present value of all "benefit liabilities", within the
meaning of Section 4001(a)(16) of ERISA (as determined on the basis of the
actuarial assumptions contained in such Pension Plans most recent actuarial
valuation), did not exceed the then current value of the assets of such
Pension Plan, and there has been no material change in the financial
condition, whether or not as a result of a change in funding method, of such
Pension Plan since the last day of the most recent plan year. The withdrawal
liability of the Company and its Subsidiaries under each Benefit Plan which
is a Multiemployer Plan to which the Company, any of its subsidiaries or an
ERISA Affiliate has contributed during the preceding 12 months, determined as
if a "complete withdrawal", within the meaning of Section 4203 of ERISA, had
occurred as of the date hereof, does not exceed $11,000,000 as of January 1,
2006.

(vi) As of the date hereof, there is no material pending or, to the knowledge
of the Company threatened, litigation relating to the Benefit Plans other than
Multiemployer Plans. To the knowledge of the management of the Company, the
Company has no material litigation in respect of the Multiemployer Plans.
Neither the Company nor any of its subsidiaries has any obligations for
retiree health and life benefits under any ERISA Plan or collective bargaining
agreement. The Company or its Subsidiaries may amend or terminate any such
plan at any time without incurring any liability thereunder other than in
respect of claims incurred prior to such amendment or termination.

(vii) There has been no amendment to, announcement by the Company or any of
its subsidiaries relating to, or change in employee participation or coverage
under, any Benefit Plan which would increase materially the expense of
maintaining such plan above the level of the expense incurred therefor for the
most recent fiscal year. Neither the execution of this Agreement, shareholder
adoption of this Agreement nor the consummation of the transactions
contemplated hereby will (w) entitle any employees of the Company or any of
its Subsidiaries to severance pay or any increase in severance pay upon any
termination of employment after the date hereof, (x) accelerate the time of
payment or vesting or result in any payment or funding (through a grantor
trust or



 

-18- otherwise) of compensation or benefits under, increase the amount payable or
result in any other material obligation pursuant to, any of the Benefit
Plans, (y) limit or restrict the right of the Company or, after the
consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby, Parent to merge, amend
or terminate any of the Benefit Plans or (z) result in payments under any of
the Benefit Plans which would not be deductible under Section 162(m) or
Section 280G of the Code.

(viii) All Non-U.S. Benefit Plans comply in all material respects with
applicable local Law. No later than two weeks following the date hereof, the
Company shall provide Parent with (a) a list of all Non-U.S. Benefit Plans
and (b) true and complete copies of all such Non-U.S. Benefit Plans,
including any trust instruments, insurance contracts and, with respect to any
employee stock ownership plan, loan agreements forming a part of any Benefit
Plans, and all amendments thereto. The Company and its Subsidiaries have no
material unfunded liabilities with respect to any such Non-U.S. Benefit Plan.
There is no pending or, to the knowledge of management of the Company,
threatened material litigation relating to Non-U.S. Benefit Plans.

(i) _Compliance with Laws; Licenses_. The businesses of each of the Company
and its Subsidiaries have not been, and are not being, conducted in violation
of any federal, state, local or foreign law, statute or ordinance, or any
rule, regulation, standard, judgment, order, writ, injunction, decree,
arbitration award, agency requirement, license or permit of any Governmental
Entity (collectively, " _Laws_ "), except for violations that, individually or
in the aggregate, would not reasonably be expected to have a Company Material
Adverse Effect or prevent, materially delay or materially impair the
consummation of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement. To the
knowledge of management of the Company, no investigation or review by any
Governmental Entity with respect to the Company or any of its Subsidiaries is
pending or threatened, nor has any Governmental Entity indicated an intention
to conduct the same, except for those the outcome of which would not,
individually or in the aggregate, reasonably be expected to have a Company
Material Adverse Effect or prevent, materially delay or materially impair the
consummation of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement. The Company
and its Subsidiaries each has obtained and is in compliance with all permits,
licenses, certifications, approvals, registrations, consents, authorizations,
franchises, variances, exemptions and orders issued or granted by a
Governmental Entity (" _Licenses_ ") necessary to conduct its business as
presently conducted, except where the failure to so possess or comply would
not, individually or in the aggregate, reasonably be expected to have a
Company Material Adverse Effect or prevent, materially delay or materially
impair the consummation of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement.

 

(j) _Material Contracts_.

Subsidiaries is a party to or bound by:

Significant Subsidiaries and (ii) any proposal or offer to acquire in any
manner, directly or indirectly, 15% or more of the total voting power or of
any class of equity securities of the Company or those of any of its
Significant Subsidiaries, or 15% or more of the consolidated total assets
(including equity securities of its Subsidiaries) of the Company, in each case
other than the transactions contemplated by this Agreement.

" _Superior Proposal_ " means an unsolicited bona fide Acquisition Proposal
involving all or substantially all of the assets (on a consolidated basis) or
total voting power of the equity securities of the Company that the board of
directors of the Company has determined in its good faith judgment is
reasonably expected to be consummated in accordance with its terms, taking
into account all legal, financial and regulatory aspects of the proposal, the
effect of the proposal on constituencies of the Company and the Person making
the proposal, and if consummated, would result in a transaction more
favorable to the Companys shareholders from a financial point of view (after
taking into account any revisions to the terms of the transaction contemplated
by Section 6.2(c) of this Agreement).



 

-33- (c) _No Change in Recommendation or Alternative Acquisition Agreement_. The
board of directors of the Company and each committee thereof shall not:

(i) withhold, withdraw, qualify or modify (or publicly propose or resolve to
withhold, withdraw, qualify or modify), in a manner adverse to Parent, the
Company Recommendation with respect to the Merger (it being understood that
publicly taking a neutral position or no position with respect to an
Acquisition Proposal at any time beyond 10 business days after the first
public announcement of such Acquisition Proposal shall not be considered an
adverse modification); or

(ii) except as expressly permitted by, and after compliance with, Section
8.3(a) hereof, cause or permit the Company to enter into any letter of intent,
memorandum of understanding, agreement in principle, acquisition agreement,
merger agreement or other agreement (other than a confidentiality agreement
referred to in Section 6.2(a) entered into in compliance with Section 6.2(a))
(an " _Alternative Acquisition Agreement_ ") relating to any Acquisition
Proposal.

Notwithstanding anything to the contrary set forth in this Agreement, prior to
the time, but not after, the Company Requisite Vote is obtained, the board of
directors of the Company may withhold, withdraw, qualify or modify the Company
Recommendation or approve, recommend or otherwise declare advisable any
Superior Proposal made after the date hereof that was not solicited,
initiated, encouraged or knowingly facilitated in breach of Section 6.2(a), if
the board of directors of the Company determines in good faith, after
consultation with outside counsel, that failure to take such action would be
inconsistent with the directors fiduciary duties under applicable Law (a "
_Change of Recommendation_ "); _provided_ , _however_ , that no Change of
Recommendation may be made until after at least 48 hours following Parents
receipt of written notice from the Company advising that management of the
Company currently intends to recommend to its board of directors that it take
such action and the basis therefor, including all necessary information under
Section 6.2(f). In determining whether to make a Change of Recommendation in
response to a Superior Proposal or otherwise, the Company board of directors
shall take into account any changes to the terms of this Agreement proposed
by Parent and any other information provided by Parent in response to such
notice. Any material amendment to any Acquisition Proposal will be deemed to
be a new Acquisition Proposal for purposes of this Section 6.2,
including with respect to the notice period referred to in this Section 6.2.

(d) _Certain Permitted Disclosure_. Nothing contained in this Section 6.2
shall be deemed to prohibit the Company from complying with its disclosure
obligations under U.S. federal or state Law with regard to an Acquisition
Proposal; _provided_ , _however_ , that if such disclosure has
the substantive effect of withdrawing or adversely modifying the Company
Recommendation, Parent, shall have the right to terminate this Agreement as
set forth in Section 8.4(a).

and cause to be terminated any existing activities, discussions or
negotiations with any parties conducted heretofore with respect to any
Acquisition Proposal. The Company agrees that it will take the necessary steps

and in the Confidentiality Agreement. The Company also agrees that it will
promptly request each Person that has heretofore executed a confidentiality
agreement in connection with its consideration of acquiring it or any of its
Subsidiaries to return or destroy all confidential information heretofore
furnished to such Person by or on behalf of it or any of its Subsidiaries.

(f) _Notice_. The Company agrees that it will promptly (and, in any event,
within 48 hours) notify Parent if any inquiries, proposals or offers with
respect to an Acquisition Proposal are received by, any such information is
requested from, or any such discussions or negotiation are sought to be
initiated or continued with, it or any of its Representatives indicating, in
connection with such notice, the name of such Person and the material terms
and conditions of any proposals or offers (including, if applicable, copies of
any written requests, proposals or offers, including proposed agreements)
and thereafter shall keep Parent informed, on a current basis, of the status
and terms of any such proposals or offers (including any amendments thereto)
and the status of any such discussions or negotiations, including any change
in the Companys intentions as previously notified.

as promptly as practicable after the date of this Agreement, and in any event
within 14 days after the date hereof, a proxy statement in preliminary form
relating to the Shareholders Meeting (as defined in Section 6.4) (such proxy
statement, including any amendment or supplement thereto, the " _Proxy
Statement_ "). The Company agrees, as to its and Subsidiaries, that (i) the
Proxy Statement will comply in all material respects with the applicable
provisions of the Exchange Act and the rules and regulations thereunder and
(ii) none of the information supplied by it or any of its Subsidiaries for
inclusion or incorporation by reference in the Proxy Statement will, at the
date of mailing to shareholders of the Company or at the time of the
Shareholders Meeting, contain any untrue statement of a material fact or omit
to state any material fact required to be stated therein or necessary in order
to make the statements therein, in light of the circumstances under which
they were made, not misleading. Parent shall cooperate in the preparation of
the Proxy Statement and shall promptly provide to the Company any information
regarding Parent that is necessary or reasonably appropriate to include in the
Proxy Statement. Parent agrees that none of the information supplied by
Parent or any of its Subsidiaries for inclusion or incorporation by reference
in the Proxy Statement will, at the date of mailing to shareholders of the
Company or at the time of the Shareholders Meeting, contain any untrue
statement of a material fact or omit to state any material fact required to be

applicable Law and its Charter and Bylaws and subject to the fiduciary duties
of its directors, all action necessary to convene a meeting of holders of

shareholders to consider and vote upon approval of this Agreement and the
Merger. Subject to Section 6.2(c) hereof, the board of directors of the

to the Proxy Statement. The Company and Parent shall each use its reasonable
best efforts to promptly provide responses to the SEC with respect to all
comments received on the Proxy Statement by the SEC and the Company shall
cause the definitive Proxy Statement to be mailed as promptly as possible
after the date the SEC staff advises that it has no further comments thereon
or that the Company may commence mailing the Proxy Statement.

Agreement, the Company and Parent shall cooperate with each other and use
(and shall cause their respective Subsidiaries to use) their respective
reasonable best efforts to take or cause to be taken all actions, and do or
cause to be done all things, reasonably necessary, proper or advisable on its
part under this Agreement and applicable Laws to consummate and make
effective the Merger and the other transactions contemplated by this Agreement
as soon as reasonably practicable, including preparing and filing as promptly
as practicable all documentation to effect all necessary notices, reports and
other filings and to obtain as promptly as practicable all consents,
registrations, approvals, permits and authorizations necessary or advisable to

consummate the Merger or any of the other transactions contemplated by this
Agreement; _provided_ , _however_ , that nothing in this Agreement, including
this Section 6.5 or the "reasonable best efforts" or other similar standard
generally, shall require, or be construed to require, Parent to proffer to, or
agree to, or to permit the Company to proffer to or agree to, with respect to
assets or businesses of Parent, the Company or their respective Subsidiaries,
sell, divest, lease, license, transfer, dispose of or otherwise encumber or
hold separate or agree to sell, divest, lease, license, transfer, dispose of
or otherwise encumber before or after the Effective Time, any assets,

disposition or other encumberment by the Company of any of its assets,
licenses, operations, rights, product lines, businesses or interest therein or
to any agreement by the Company to take any of the foregoing actions) or to

waiting period with respect to the Merger under the HSR Act. Subject to
applicable Laws relating to the exchange of information, Parent shall have the
right to direct all matters with any Governmental Entity consistent with its
obligations hereunder, _provided_ , that Parent and the Company shall have
the right to review in advance and, to the extent practicable, each will
consult with the other on and consider in good faith the views of the other in
connection with, all of the information relating to Parent or the Company, as
the case may be, and any of their respective Subsidiaries, that appears in any
filing made with, or written materials submitted to, any third party and/or
any Governmental Entity in connection with the Merger and the
other transactions contemplated by this Agreement (including the Proxy

Governmental Entity or Person, give each other the opportunity to attend and
participate in such meetings and conferences, in each case, regarding any of
the transactions contemplated hereby. The Company and Parent may, as each
determines is reasonably necessary, designate competitively sensitive material
provided to the other under this Section 6.5(b) as "Outside Counsel Only."
Such materials and the information contained therein shall be given only to
the outside legal counsel of the recipient and will not be disclosed by such
outside counsel to directors, officers or employees of the recipient unless
express permission is obtained in advance from the source of the materials
(the Company or Parent, as the case may be) or its legal counsel.
Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Section 6.5(b), materials
provided to the other party hereto or its counsel may be redacted to remove
references concerning the valuation of Company and its Subsidiaries.

(c) _Information_. Subject to applicable Law, the Company and Parent
each shall, upon request by the other, furnish the other with all information
concerning itself, its Subsidiaries, directors, officers and shareholders and
such other matters as may be reasonably necessary or advisable in connection

employees, properties, books, contracts and records and, during such period,
the Company shall (and shall cause its Subsidiaries to) furnish promptly to
Parent all information concerning its business, properties and personnel as
may reasonably be requested, _provided_ that no investigation



 

-38- pursuant to this Section 6.6 shall affect or be deemed to modify any
representation or warranty made by the Company herein, and _provided_ ,
_further_ , that the foregoing shall not require the Company (i) to permit any
inspection, or to disclose any information, that in the reasonable judgment of

parties or violate any of its obligations with respect to confidentiality if
the Company shall have used reasonable best efforts to obtain the consent of
such third party to such inspection or disclosure or (ii) to disclose any
privileged information of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries in a manner
that is reasonably expected to result in the loss of such privilege. All

its Subsidiaries to its similarly situated employees. With respect to any
bonus or long-term cash incentive awards calculated based on 2006 performance,
the Companys performance for calendar year 2006 shall be calculated without
taking into account any reasonable expenses or costs associated with or
arising as a result of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement or any
nonrecurring charges that would not reasonably be expected to have been
incurred had the transactions contemplated by the Agreement not
been proposed.



 

-39- (b) Prior to the Effective Time, if requested by Parent in writing, to the
extent permitted by applicable Law and the terms of the applicable plan or
arrangement, the Company shall (i) cause to be amended the employee benefit
plans and arrangements of it and its Subsidiaries to the extent necessary to
provide that no employees of Parent and its Subsidiaries shall commence
participation therein following the Effective Time unless the Surviving
Corporation or such Subsidiary explicitly authorizes such participation and
(ii) cause the Banta Corporation Incentive Savings Plan and the Banta Hourly
401(k) Plan to be terminated effective immediately prior to the Effective
Time. In addition, prior to the Effective Time, to the extent permitted by

legacy facility of Parent or a legacy facility of the Company. In addition,
following the Effective Time, decisions regarding promotions and retention of
employees shall be made by Parent on a fair and equitable basis, in light of
the circumstances and the objectives to be achieved, giving consideration to
previous work history, job experience, qualifications and business needs
without regard (except to the extent affecting relevant experience) to whether
employment prior to the Effective Time was with the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries or Parent or any of its Subsidiaries.

shall cause any employee benefit plans (including vacation, severance and
disability plans) covering employees of the Company and its Subsidiaries to
take into account for purposes of eligibility, benefits (excluding accruals
under a defined benefit plan) and vesting thereunder service by such employees
with the Company and its Subsidiaries as if such service were with Parent or
its Subsidiaries, to the same extent that such service was credited under a
comparable plan of the Company or its Subsidiaries, _provided_ , that no
credit shall be given under frozen benefit plans. For purposes of each



 

-40- employee benefit plan of Parent or its Subsidiaries providing medical, dental,
prescription drug, vision, life insurance or disability benefits to any
employee of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries, Parent shall cause its
employee benefit plans to (i) waive all pre-existing condition exclusions of
its employee benefit plans with respect to such employees and their
dependents to the same extent such exclusions were waived under a comparable
plan of the Company and (ii) take into account any eligible expenses incurred
by such employees and their dependents for purposes of satisfying all
deductible, coinsurance and maximum out-of-pocket requirements applicable to
such employees and their covered dependents under the applicable employee
benefit plan of Parent or its Subsidiaries.

the Company Disclosure Letter. Amounts awarded under the Retention Pool shall

Subsidiaries designated by the Chief Executive Officer of the Company in
accordance with the guidelines set forth in Section 6.9(g) of the

Subsidiaries who, at the Effective Time, is in a course of training covered in
part or in whole by a tuition reimbursement program of the Company or any of

training (not to exceed two years or $1,000,000 in the aggregate) (as opposed
to the current educational period).

deferred compensation plans covering any employees of the Company or any of
its Subsidiaries to be drafted and administered in a manner that complies

the Surviving Corporation and its Subsidiaries to make charitable
contributions in the communities that the Company and its Subsidiaries serve,
in such amounts (not to exceed $1.5 million in the aggregate), at such times
and in such manner as are generally consistent with the past practices of the
Company and its Subsidiaries.

(k) Nothing contained in this Section 6.9 or this Agreement shall (i) be
treated as an amendment of any particular Benefit Plan, (ii) give any third
party any right to enforce the provisions of this Section 6.9 or (iii)
obligate Parent, the Surviving Corporation or any of their Affiliates to (x)
maintain any particular Benefit Plan or (y) retain the employment of any

and expenses incurred in connection with this Agreement and the Merger and the
other transactions contemplated by this Agreement shall be paid by the party
incurring such expense.

6.11. _Indemnification; Directors  and Officers Insurance_.

(a) From and after the Effective Time, Parent shall or shall cause the
Surviving Corporation to indemnify and hold harmless each present and former
director and officer of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries (in each case,
when acting in such capacity), determined as of the Effective Time (the "
_Indemnified Parties_ "), against any costs or expenses (including reasonable
attorneys fees), judgments, fines, losses, claims, damages or liabilities
(collectively, " _Costs_ ") incurred in connection with any claim, action,
suit, proceeding or investigation, whether civil, criminal, administrative or
investigative, arising out of matters existing or occurring at or prior to
the Effective Time (including those in respect of the Merger and the other
transactions contemplated hereby), whether asserted or claimed prior to, at or
after the Effective Time, to the fullest extent that the Company would have
been permitted under Wisconsin law and its Charter or Bylaws in effect on the
date hereof to indemnify such Person (and Parent or the Surviving Corporation
shall also advance expenses as incurred to the fullest extent permitted under
applicable Law and the Companys Charter or Bylaws in effect on the date
hereof).

(b) Any Indemnified Party wishing to claim indemnification under paragraph
(a) of this Section 6.11, upon learning of any such claim, action, suit,
proceeding or investigation, shall promptly notify Parent or the Surviving
Corporation thereof, but the failure to so notify shall not relieve the
Surviving Corporation or Parent of any liability it may have to such
Indemnified Party except to the extent such failure materially prejudices the
indemnifying party. In the event of any such claim, action, suit, proceeding
or investigation (whether arising before or after the Effective Time), (i)
the Surviving Corporation shall have the right to assume the defense thereof
and Parent and the Surviving Corporation shall not be liable to such
Indemnified Parties for any legal expenses of other counsel or any other
expenses subsequently incurred by such Indemnified Parties in connection with
the defense thereof, except that if the Surviving Corporation elects not to
assume such defense or there are issues which raise conflicts of
interest between Parent or the Surviving Corporation and the Indemnified
Parties, the Indemnified Parties may retain counsel satisfactory to them, and
the Parent shall pay all reasonable fees and expenses of such counsel for the
Indemnified Parties promptly as statements therefor are received; _provided_
, _however_ , that the Surviving Corporation shall be obligated pursuant to
this paragraph (b) to pay for only one firm of counsel for all Indemnified
Parties in any jurisdiction unless the use of one counsel for such
Indemnified Parties would present such counsel with a conflict of interest,
_provided_ that the fewest



 

-42- number of counsels necessary to avoid conflicts of interest shall be used;
(ii) the Indemnified Parties will cooperate in the defense of any such
matter, and (iii) Parent and the Surviving Corporation shall not be liable for
any settlement effected without their prior written consent, which consent
shall not be unreasonably withheld or delayed (except that no such consent
shall be required as a condition to Parents or the Surviving Corporations
liability if Parent or the Surviving Corporation fails to assume, pay for or
actively participate in the defense of the underlying matter); and _provided_
, _further_ , that Parent and the Surviving Corporation shall not have any
obligation hereunder to any Indemnified Party if and when a court of competent
jurisdiction shall ultimately determine, and such determination shall have
become final and not subject to appeal, that the indemnification of such
Indemnified Party in the manner contemplated hereby is prohibited by
applicable Law and the Companys Charter and Bylaws as in effect on the date
hereof.

 

(c) Prior to the Effective Time, the Company shall and if the Company is
unable to, Parent shall cause the Surviving Corporation as of the
Effective Time to obtain and fully pay for "tail" insurance policies with a
claims period of at least six years from and after the Effective Time from an
insurance carrier with the same or better credit rating as the Companys
current insurance carrier with respect to directors and officers liability
insurance and fiduciary liability insurance (collectively, " _D andO
Insurance_") with benefits and levels of coverage at least as favorable as the
Companys existing policies with respect to matters existing or occurring at
or prior to the Effective Time (including in connection with this Agreement or
the transactions or actions contemplated hereby), _provided_ , _however_ ,
that in no event shall the Company expend for such policies a premium amount
in excess of the amount set forth in the Company Disclosure Letter. If the
Company and the Surviving Corporation for any reason fail to obtain such
"tail" insurance policies as of the Effective Time, the Surviving Corporation
shall, and Parent shall cause the Surviving Corporation to, continue to
maintain in effect in respect of the Companys current directors and officers,
for a period of at least six years from and after the Effective Time, the DandO
Insurance in place as of the date hereof with benefits and levels of coverage
at least as favorable as provided in the Companys existing policies as of the
date hereof, or the Surviving Corporation shall, and Parent shall cause the
Surviving Corporation to, use reasonable best efforts to purchase comparable
DandO Insurance for such six-year period with benefits and levels of coverage at
least as favorable as provided in the Companys existing policies as of the
date hereof, _provided_ , _however_ , that in no event shall Parent or the
Surviving Corporation be required to expend for such policies an annual
premium amount in excess of 250% of the annual premiums currently paid by the
Company for such insurance; and, _provided_ _further_ that if the annual
premiums of such insurance coverage exceed such amount, the Surviving
Corporation shall obtain a policy with the greatest coverage available for a
cost not exceeding such amount.

(d) If Parent or the Surviving Corporation or any of their respective
successors or assigns (i) shall consolidate with or merge into any other
corporation or entity and shall not be the continuing or surviving corporation
or entity of such



 

-43- consolidation or merger or (ii) shall transfer all or substantially all of its
properties and assets to any individual, corporation or other entity, then,
and in each such case, proper provisions shall be made so that the successors
and assigns of Parent or the Surviving Corporation shall assume all of the
obligations set forth in this Section 6.11. 

(e) The provisions of this Section 6.11 are intended to be for the benefit of,
and shall be enforceable by, each of the Indemnified Parties and their heirs
and representatives.

(f) The rights of the Indemnified Parties under this Section 6.11 shall be in
addition to any rights such Indemnified Parties may have under the
certificates of incorporation or by-laws of the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries, or under any applicable Contracts or Laws. Without limitation,
all rights to indemnification and exculpation from liabilities for acts or
omissions occurring at or prior to the Effective Time now existing in favor of
any current or former officers, directors or employees of the Company or any
of its Subsidiaries, as provided in the respective certificates or articles
of incorporation or bylaws (or comparable organizational documents) of the
Company or any of its Subsidiaries, and any existing indemnification
agreements, shall survive the Merger and shall continue in full force and
effect in accordance with their terms, and shall not be amended, repealed or
otherwise modified in any manner that would adversely affect the rights
thereunder of such individuals for acts or omissions occurring at or prior to
the Effective Time 

6.12. _Other Actions by the Company_.

(a) _Rights_. Prior to the Effective Time, the board of directors of the
Company shall take all necessary action to cause the Rights to cease to

the Rights Agreement, effective as of the Effective Time, without payment of
any consideration in respect thereof.

(b) _Takeover Statutes_. If any Takeover Statute is or may become applicable
to the Merger or the other transactions contemplated by this Agreement, the
Company and its board of directors shall grant such approvals and take such

paid pursuant to clause (iv) shall be paid as set forth in Section 8.3) and
shall promptly, but in no event later than two business days after being
notified in writing of such by Parent, pay all of the documented and
reasonable out-of-pocket expenses incurred by Parent or Merger Sub

payment. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement, the
parties hereby acknowledge that in the event that the Termination Fee becomes
payable and is paid by the Company pursuant to this Section 8.5(b), the
Termination Fee shall be Parents and Merger Subs sole and exclusive remedy

business or printing operations of a Person in a transaction that requires HSR
Approval, Parent shall pay the Company a termination fee of $17.1 million (the
" _Parent Fee_ "), payable by wire transfer of same day funds no later than
two business days after such termination. Parent acknowledges that the
agreements contained in this Section 8.5(c) are an integral part of the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement, and that, without these
agreements, the Company would not enter into this Agreement; accordingly, if
Parent fails to promptly pay the amount due pursuant to this Section 8.5(c),
and, in order to obtain such payment, the Company commences a suit that
results in a judgment against Parent for the fee set forth in this Section
8.5(c) or any portion of such fee, Parent shall pay to the Company its
reasonable out-of-pocket costs and expenses (including attorneys fees) in
connection with such suit, together with interest on the amount of the fee at
