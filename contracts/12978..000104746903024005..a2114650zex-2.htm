 _The Merger_

  

 SECTION 1.01. _ The Merger.__ Upon the terms and subject to the conditions set forth in this Agreement, and in accordance with the Ohio General Corporation Law (the " _OGCL_ "), Sub shall be merged with and into the Company at the Effective Time of the Merger.

 SECTION 1.02. _ Closing.__ Upon the terms and subject to the conditions of this Agreement, the closing of the Merger (the " _Closing_ ") shall take place at 9:00 a.m. (Chicago, Illinois time) on a date to be specified by the parties (the " _Closing Date_ "), which shall be no later than the second business day after satisfaction (or waiver) of the conditions set forth in Article VI (other than those conditions that by their nature are to be fulfilled at Closing, but subject to the fulfillment or waiver of such conditions), at the offices of Bell, Boyd and Lloyd LLC, 70 West Madison Street, Chicago, Illinois 60602, unless another time, date or place is agreed to in writing by the parties hereto.

The Merger shall become effective on such date as the Certificate of Merger is duly filed with the Ohio Secretary of State, or on such later date as the parties may agree and specify in the Certificate of Merger (the date the Merger becomes effective being the " _Effective Time of the Merger_ "). 

  

 SECTION 1.04. _ Effects of the Merger.__ The Merger shall have the effects set forth in Section 1701.82 of the OGCL. 

  

 SECTION 1.05. _ Articles of Incorporation and Code of Regulations.__ (a) The Articles of Incorporation of Sub, as in effect immediately prior to the Effective Time of the Merger, shall be the Articles of Incorporation of the Surviving Corporation until thereafter changed or amended as provided therein or by applicable law.

 SECTION 1.06. _ Directors of the Surviving Corporation.__ The individuals who are the directors of Sub immediately prior to the Effective Time of the Merger shall be the directors of the Surviving Corporation until thereafter they cease to be directors in accordance with the OGCL and the Articles of Incorporation and Code of Regulations of the Surviving Corporation.

ARTICLE II

  

 _Effect of the Merger on the Shares of the Constituent Corporations_

  

 SECTION 2.01. _ Merger Consideration.__ (a) Subject to the terms and conditions of this Agreement, at the Effective Time of the Merger, by virtue of the Merger and without any action on the part of Parent, Sub or any holder of shares of the Company: 

  

  

 (i) Subject to Sections 2.01(b) and (c) and to Section 2.05, each common share, without par value, of the Company (" _Company Common Shares_ ") issued and outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time of the Merger (other than Company Common Shares held directly or indirectly by the Company (" _Treasury Shares_ "), Dissenters\' Shares and Company Common Shares held directly by Parent) will be converted into the right to receive, at the election of each holder thereof, either: (A) a number of fully paid and nonassessable shares of common stock, par value $2.50 per share, of Parent (" _Parent Common Stock_ ") equal to the Exchange Ratio (as defined below), together with an equal number of Parent Rights (the " _Per Share Stock Consideration_ "), or (B) the Per Share Cash Consideration. " _Exchange Ratio_ " means $9.00 divided by the Parent Common Stock Value; _provided_ that (x) if the Parent Common Stock Value is less than $21.09, the Exchange Ratio will be 0.4268 for all purposes under this Agreement and (y) if the Parent Common Stock Value is greater than $25.77, the Exchange Ratio shall be 0.3492 for all purposes under this Agreement. " _Parent Common Stock Value_ " means the average closing sale prices for a share of Parent Common Stock on the New York Stock Exchange, Inc. (the " _NYSE_ ") Composite Transactions Tape (as reported by _The Wall Street Journal_ (Northeast edition), or, if not reported thereby, as reported by any other authoritative source) for each of the ten consecutive trading days ending with the second complete trading day prior to the Closing Date (not counting the Closing Date). The Exchange Ratio shall be calculated to the nearest one-ten thousandth of a share of Parent Common Stock and the Parent Common Stock Value shall be calculated to the nearest one-tenth of one cent. " _Consideration_ " means the Per Share Cash Consideration and the Per Share Stock Consideration. " _Per Share Cash Consideration_ " means $9.00 in cash; _provided_ that if Parent makes the Additional Cash Election (as defined below) and either (I) if the Parent Common Stock Value is greater than $25.77, then the Per Share Cash Consideration shall equal $9.00 in cash plus an amount in cash equal to the Additional Cash Percentage (as defined below) of the amount by which the Parent Common Stock Value multiplied by the Exchange Ratio is greater than $9.00 or (II) if the Parent Common Stock Value is less than $21.09, then the Per Share Cash Consideration shall equal $9.00 in cash less an amount in cash equal to the Additional Cash Percentage of the amount by which $9.00 is more than the Parent Common Stock Value multiplied by the Exchange Ratio. " _Additional Cash Percentage_ " means 14.286% if the Stock Percentage (as defined below) is 65%, 25.000% if the Stock Percentage is 60% and 33.333% if the Stock Percentage is 55%. 

  

 (ii) Each Company Common Share that, immediately prior to the Effective Time of the Merger, is a Treasury Share or is owned directly by Parent will be canceled and retired and will cease to exist, and no exchange or payment will be made therefor. 

  

    
  

 (iii) At the Effective Time of the Merger, each common share, without par value, of Sub issued and outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time of the Merger shall be converted into and become a number of fully paid and nonassessable common shares, without par value, of the Surviving Corporation (the " _Surviving Corporation Common Shares_ ") equal to (x) the number of Company Common Shares outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time of the Merger divided by (y) 1000; _provided_ , _however_ , that to the extent the aggregate number of Surviving Corporation Common Shares into which the common shares of Sub is to be converted pursuant to this Section 2.01(a)(iii) is not a whole number, such number shall be rounded up to the next higher whole number. 

  

  

 (b) Subject to the allocation procedures set forth in Section 2.01(c), each record holder of Company Common Shares will be entitled (i) to elect to receive shares of Parent Common Stock and Parent Rights for all of the Company Common Shares (" _Stock Election Shares_ ") held by such record holder, (ii) to elect to receive cash for all of the Company Common Shares (" _Cash Election Shares_ ") held by such record holder or (iii) to indicate that such holder makes no such election for all of the Company Common Shares (" _No-Election Shares_ ") held by such record holder, _provided_ , that notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the contrary, the number of Company Common Shares to be converted into the right to receive the Per Share Stock Consideration in the Merger (the " _Stock Number_ ") will equal as nearly as practicable the Stock Percentage of the total number of Company Common Shares outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time of the Merger. All such elections (each, an " _Election_ ") shall be made on a form designed for that purpose by Parent and reasonably acceptable to the Company (an " _Election Form_ "). Any Company Common Shares for which the record holder has not, as of the Election Deadline, properly submitted to the Exchange Agent a properly completed Election Form (excluding any Dissenters\' Shares) will be deemed No-Election Shares. All Dissenters\' Shares will be deemed Cash Election Shares. A record holder acting in different capacities or acting on behalf of other persons in any way will be entitled to submit an Election Form for each capacity in which such record holder so acts with respect to each person for which it so acts. The exchange agent (the " _Exchange Agent_ ") will be a bank or trust company in the United States selected by Parent and reasonably acceptable to the Company. " _Stock Percentage_ " means 70%; _provided_ that the Stock Percentage shall mean 65%, 60% or 55% if Parent so elects by written notice delivered to the Company specifying such new Stock Percentage and makes a public announcement of such election in each case not less than ten trading days prior to the date of the Company Shareholders Meeting (the " _Additional Cash Election_ "). 

  

 (c) The allocation among the holders of Company Common Shares of rights to receive the Per Share Stock Consideration or the Per Share Cash Consideration in the Merger will be made as follows: 

  

  

 (i) _Number of Stock Election Shares Less Than Stock Number._ If the number of Stock Election Shares (on the basis of Election Forms received as of the Election Deadline) is less than the Stock Number, then (A) each Stock Election Share will be, as of the Effective Time of the Merger, converted into the right to receive the Per Share Stock Consideration; (B) the Exchange Agent will allocate from among the No-Election Shares, pro rata to the holders of No-Election Shares in accordance with their respective numbers of No-Election Shares, a sufficient number of No-Election Shares so that the sum of such number and the number of Stock Election Shares equals as closely as practicable the Stock Number, and each such allocated No-Election Share (each, a " _Stock-Selected No-Election Share_ ") will be, as of the Effective Time of the Merger, converted into the right to receive the Per Share Stock Consideration, _provided_ that if the sum of all No-Election Shares and Stock Election Shares is equal to or less than the Stock Number, all No-Election Shares will be Stock-Selected No-Election Shares; (C) if the sum of Stock Election Shares and No-Election Shares is less than the Stock Number, the Exchange Agent will allocate from among the Cash Election Shares, pro rata to the holders of Cash Election Shares in accordance with their respective numbers of Cash Election Shares, a sufficient number of Cash 

  

    

Election Shares so that the sum of such number, the number of all Stock
Election Shares and the number of all No-Election Shares equals as closely as
practicable the Stock Number, and each such allocated Cash Election Share
(each, a " _Converted Cash Election Share_ ") will be, as of the Effective
Time of the Merger, converted into the right to receive the Per Share Stock
Consideration; and (D) each No-Election Share and Cash Election Share that is
not a Stock-Selected No-Election Share or a Converted Cash Election Share (as
the case may be) will be, as of the Effective Time of the Merger, converted
into the right to receive the Per Share Cash Consideration;

  

 (ii) _Number of Stock Election Shares Greater Than Stock Number._ If the number of Stock Election Shares (on the basis of Election Forms received by the Election Deadline) is greater than the Stock Number, then (A) each Cash Election Share and No-Election Share will be, as of the Effective Time of the Merger, converted into the right to receive the Per Share Cash Consideration; (B) the Exchange Agent will allocate from among the Stock Election Shares, pro rata to the holders of Stock Election Shares in accordance with their respective numbers of Stock Election Shares, a sufficient number of Stock Election Shares (" _Converted Stock Election Shares_ ") so that the difference of (x) the number of Stock Election Shares less (y) the number of the Converted Stock Election Shares equals as closely as practicable the Stock Number, and each Converted Stock Election Share will be, as of the Effective Time of the Merger, converted into the right to receive the Per Share Cash Consideration; and (C) each Stock Election Share that is not a Converted Stock Election Share will be, as of the Effective Time of the Merger, converted into the right to receive the Per Share Stock Consideration; or 

  

 (iii) _Number of Stock Election Shares Equals the Stock Number._ If the number of Stock Election Shares (on the basis of Election Forms received by the Election Deadline) equals the Stock Number, then (A) each Stock Election Share will be, as of the Effective Time of the Merger, converted into the right to receive the Per Share Stock Consideration and (B) each No-Election Share and Cash Election Share will be, as of the Effective Time of the Merger, converted into the right to receive the Per Share Cash Consideration. 

  

  

 SECTION 2.02. _ Rights as Shareholders; Share Transfers.__ At the Effective Time of the Merger, holders of Company Common Shares will cease to be, and will have no rights as, shareholders of the Company, other than the right to receive (a) any dividend or other distribution with respect to such Company Common Shares with a record date occurring prior to the Effective Time of the Merger, (b) pursuant to Section 2.03, any cash in lieu of any fractional share of Parent Common Stock and (c) the Consideration provided under this Article II; _provided_ that in the case of holders of Dissenters\' Shares, such shareholders shall have the rights described in Section 2.06 in lieu of any rights to the Consideration. After the Effective Time of the Merger, there will be no transfers of Company Common Shares on the share transfer books of the Company or the Surviving Corporation. If, after the Effective Time of the Merger, any certificates formerly representing Company Common Shares are presented to the Surviving Corporation or the Exchange Agent for any reason, they shall be canceled and exchanged as provided in this Article II. 

  

 SECTION 2.03. _ Fractional Shares.__ Notwithstanding any other provision in this Agreement, no fractional shares of Parent Common Stock or fractional Parent Rights, and no certificates or scrip therefor, or other evidence of ownership thereof, will be issued in the Merger. In lieu of such fractional share interests to which a holder of Company Common Shares would otherwise be entitled under Section 2.01, Parent shall pay to each such former holder of Company Common Shares otherwise entitled to receive Parent Common Stock under Section 2.01 an amount in cash equal to the product obtained by multiplying (A) the fractional share interest to which such former holder (after taking into account all Company Common Shares held at the Effective Time of the Merger by such holder) would otherwise be entitled by (B) the Parent Common Stock Value. 

     

 SECTION 2.04. _ Exchange Procedures.__ (a) At the time of mailing of the Joint Proxy Statement to holders of record of Company Common Shares entitled to vote at the Company Shareholders Meeting (including holders of Company Common Shares subject to a transfer restriction or a risk of forfeiture in favor of the Company (" _Restricted Shares_ ")), Parent will mail, or cause the Exchange Agent to mail, therewith an Election Form and a letter of transmittal (each in customary form) to each such holder. The Company will use its commercially reasonable best efforts to make the Election Form and the Joint Proxy Statement available to all persons who become record holders of Company Common Stock during the period between such record date and the Election Deadline. To be effective, an Election Form must be properly completed, signed and actually received by the Exchange Agent not later than 5:00 p.m., New York City time, on the business day that is two trading days prior to the Closing Date (which date shall be publicly announced by Parent as soon as practicable but in no event less than five trading days prior to the Closing Date) (the " _Election Deadline_ ") and accompanied by the certificates representing all the Company Common Shares (" _Old Certificates_ ") as to which such Election Form is being made, duly endorsed in blank or otherwise in form acceptable for transfer on the books of the Company (or accompanied by an appropriate guarantee of delivery by an eligible organization). The Exchange Agent shall make all computations contemplated by Section 2.01 hereof, and, after the concurrence of the Company (not to be unreasonably withheld), all such computations will be conclusive and binding on the former holders of Company Common Shares absent manifest error. Any Election Form may be revoked, by the holder who submitted such Election Form to the Exchange Agent, only by written notice received by the Exchange Agent prior to the Election Deadline. In addition, all Election Forms shall automatically be revoked if the Exchange Agent is notified in writing by Parent and the Company that the Merger has been abandoned. The Exchange Agent may, with the mutual agreement of Parent and the Company, make such rules as are consistent with this Section 2.04 for the implementation of the Elections provided for herein as shall be necessary or desirable fully to effect such Elections. Prior to the Effective Time of the Merger, Parent and Sub will enter into an exchange agent and nominee agreement with the Exchange Agent, in a form reasonably acceptable to the Company, setting forth the procedures to be used in accomplishing the deliveries and other actions contemplated by this Section 2.04. 

   

 (b) At or prior to the Effective Time of the Merger, Parent will deposit, or will cause to be deposited, with the Exchange Agent, for the benefit of holders of Company Common Shares, certificates representing shares of Parent Common Stock and Parent Rights (" _New Certificates_ ") and an amount of cash sufficient to deliver to the holders of Company Common Shares (other than Dissenters\' Shares) the aggregate Consideration to which such holders are entitled pursuant to Section 2.01, together with all cash and other property to which such holders may be entitled pursuant to Section 2.02 in respect of dividends and distributions (such New Certificates and cash, together with any dividends or distributions with a record date occurring after the Effective Time of the Merger with respect thereto, being hereinafter referred to as the " _Exchange Fund_ "). For the purposes of such deposit, Parent shall assume that there will not be any fractional shares of Parent Common Stock or fractional Parent Rights. In addition, from time to time as needed after the Effective Time of the Merger, Parent shall deposit or shall cause to be deposited with the Exchange Agent, for addition to the Exchange Fund, cash sufficient to pay cash in lieu of fractional shares in accordance with Section 2.03. At the time of such deposit, Parent will irrevocably instruct the Exchange Agent to deliver such Consideration and other cash and property out of the Exchange Fund after the Effective Time of the Merger to the holders of the Company Common Shares (other than Dissenters\' Shares) in accordance with this Article II. The Exchange Fund shall not be used for any other purpose. 

  

 (c) The holder of each Old Certificate, upon the later of the Effective Time of the Merger or the surrender by such holder to the Exchange Agent of such Old Certificate, together with the letter of transmittal duly executed by such holder, shall be entitled to receive in exchange for such Old Certificate the Consideration into which the Company Common Shares theretofore represented by such Old Certificate have been converted pursuant to Section 2.01 (together with any applicable cash in lieu 

     

of fractional shares and dividends or distributions in respect of such
Consideration), and such Old Certificate shall forthwith thereafter be
canceled. Until such time as a New Certificate representing Parent Common
Stock and Parent Rights is issued to or at the direction of a holder of an Old
Certificate entitled to receive Per Share Stock Consideration pursuant to
Section 2.01, such Parent Common Stock and Parent Rights shall be deemed not
outstanding, and such Parent Common Stock shall not be entitled to vote on any
matter. In the event of a transfer of ownership of Company Common Shares that
is not registered on the transfer records of the Company, a New Certificate
representing the appropriate number of shares of Parent Common Stock and
Parent Rights may be issued to a person other than the person in whose name
the Old Certificate so surrendered is registered, if such Old Certificate
shall be properly endorsed or otherwise be in proper form for transfer and
the person requesting such payment shall pay any transfer or other taxes
required by reason of the issuance of shares of Parent Common Stock and Parent
Rights to a person other than the registered holder of such Old Certificate
or shall establish to the satisfaction of Parent that such tax has been paid
or is not applicable. Each Old Certificate shall be deemed at any time after
the Effective Time of the Merger to represent only the right to receive, upon
exchange as contemplated in this Section 2.04(c), the Consideration into which
the Company Common Shares formerly represented by such Old Certificate are
converted in the Merger. No interest shall be paid or accrue on any cash
payable upon surrender of any Old Certificate.

   

 (d) Notwithstanding the foregoing, neither the Exchange Agent nor any party hereto will be liable to any former holder of Company Common Shares for any amount properly delivered to a public official pursuant to applicable abandoned property, escheat or similar laws. 

  

 (e) No dividends or other distributions with respect to Parent Common Stock with a record date after the Effective Time of the Merger shall be paid to the holder of any Old Certificate with respect to the shares of Parent Common Stock issuable in exchange therefor under this Article II, and no cash payment in lieu of fractional shares shall be paid to any such holder pursuant to Section 2.03, until the holder is entitled to receive, in exchange for such Old Certificate pursuant to Section 2.04(c), the Per Share Stock Consideration represented by such Old Certificate. Subject to applicable law, after the holder of any Old Certificate becomes so entitled to receive the Per Share Stock Consideration, there shall be paid to the holder of the New Certificate representing whole shares of Parent Common Stock and Parent Rights issued in exchange for such Old Certificate, without interest, (i) at the time of such exchange, the amount of any cash payable in lieu of a factional share of Parent Common Stock to which such holder is entitled pursuant to Section 2.03 and the amount of dividends or other distributions with a record date after the Effective Time of the Merger theretofore paid with respect to such whole shares of Parent Common Stock and (ii) at the appropriate payment date, the amount of dividends or other distributions with a record date after the Effective Time of the Merger but prior to the time of such exchange and a payment date subsequent to the time of such exchange payable with respect to such whole shares of Parent Common Stock. 

  

 (f) Any portion of the Exchange Fund that remains unclaimed by the holders of Old Certificates for twelve months after the Effective Time of the Merger will be returned to Parent. Any holders of Old Certificates who have not theretofore complied with this Article II thereafter shall look only to Parent for, and, subject to Section 2.04(d), Parent shall remain liable for, payment of their claim for Consideration, cash in lieu of any fractional share interests and unpaid dividends and distributions on shares of Parent Common Stock deliverable in respect of each Company Common Share represented by such Old Certificates such holder holds as determined pursuant to this Agreement, in each case without any interest thereon. 

     SECTION 2.05. _ Anti-Dilution Adjustments.__ Should Parent
change (or establish a record date for changing) the number of shares of
Parent Common Stock issued and outstanding prior to the Effective Time of the
Merger by way of a split, dividend, combination, recapitalization, exchange
of shares or similar transaction with respect to the outstanding Parent
Common Stock having a record date preceding the Effective Time of the Merger,
the Exchange Ratio will be adjusted appropriately to provide to the holders
of Company Common Shares the same economic effect as contemplated by this
Agreement prior to such split, dividend, combination, recapitalization,
exchange of shares or similar transaction. If any Distribution Date or
Business Combination (each as defined in the Company Rights Agreement) occurs
under the Company Rights Agreement, or any Distribution Date, Stock
Acquisition Date, Section 11(a)(ii) Event, Section 13 Event or Triggering
Event (each as defined in the Parent Rights Agreement) occurs under the Parent
Rights Agreement, in each case at any time during the period from the date of
this Agreement to the Effective Time of the Merger, the Company and Parent
shall make such adjustment to the Consideration as the Company and Parent
shall mutually agree so as to preserve the economic benefits that the Company
and Parent each reasonably expected on the date of this Agreement to receive
as a result of the consummation of the Merger and the other transactions
contemplated by this Agreement.

  

 SECTION 2.06. _ Dissenting Shareholders.__ Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the contrary, Company Common Shares that are outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time of the Merger and the holders of which shall have perfected and not withdrawn or lost their dissenters\' rights in accordance with Section 1701.85 of the OGCL (" _Dissenters\' Shares_ ") will be paid for by Parent in accordance with Section 1701.85 of the OGCL; _provided_ that if any such holder shall fail to perfect or otherwise shall waive, withdraw or lose the right to receive payment of the fair value of its Company Common Shares under Section 1701.85 of the OGCL, the right of such holder to be paid such fair value of its Company Common Shares shall cease and shall be deemed converted as of the Effective Time of the Merger into the right to receive the Consideration as provided in this Article II. The Company shall give Parent (a) prompt notice of any written demands for fair value received by the Company, withdrawals of such demands, and any other related instruments served pursuant to Section 1701.85 of the OGCL and received by the Company and (b) the opportunity to direct all negotiations and proceedings with respect to demands for fair value under the OGCL. The Company shall not, except with the prior written consent of Parent, voluntarily make any payment with respect to any demands for fair value for Dissenters\' Shares or offer to settle, or settle, any such demands.

Except as set forth above, as of the date of this Agreement there are not any options, warrants, calls, rights, commitments, agreements, arrangements or undertakings of any kind (collectively, " _Options_ ") to which the Company or any Company Subsidiary is a party or by which any of them is

The execution and delivery of this Agreement and the consummation of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement and compliance with the provisions of this Agreement will not conflict with, or result in any violation of, or default (with or without notice or lapse of time, or both) under, or give rise to a right of termination or acceleration of any obligation or to loss of any material rights under, or result in the creation of any Lien upon any of the properties or assets of the Company or any Company Subsidiary under, (i) the Second Amended and Restated Articles of Incorporation or Code of Regulations of the Company or the comparable organizational documents of any Company Subsidiary, (ii) any contract, permit, license, loan or credit agreement, note, bond, mortgage, indenture, lease or other property agreement, partnership or joint venture agreement or other legally binding agreement, whether oral or written (a " _Contract_ "), applicable to the Company or any Company Subsidiary or their respective properties or assets or (iii) subject to the governmental filings and the obtaining of the Company Shareholder Approval and other matters referred to in the following sentence, any judgment, order, decree, statute, law, ordinance, rule or regulation applicable to the Company or any Company Subsidiary or their respective properties or assets, other than, in the case of clauses (ii) and (iii), any such conflicts, violations, defaults, rights or Liens that individually or in the aggregate would not have a Company Material Adverse Effect. No consent, approval, order or authorization of, or registration or filing with, any Federal, state or local government or any court, administrative agency or commission or other governmental authority or agency, domestic or foreign (a " _Governmental Entity_ "), is required by or with respect to the Company or any Company Subsidiary in connection with the execution and delivery of this Agreement by the Company or the consummation by the Company of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, except for (i) the filing of a premerger notification and report form by the Company under the Hart-Scott-Rodino Antitrust Improvements Act of 1976, as amended (the " _HSR Act_ "), (ii) the filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission (the " _SEC_ ") of (A) a joint proxy statement relating to the Company Shareholders Meeting and the Parent Stockholders Meeting (as amended or supplemented from time to time, the " _Joint Proxy Statement_ ") and (B) such reports under Section 12 or 13(a) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the " _Exchange Act_ "), as may be required in

As of its date, each Company SEC Document complied in all material respects with the requirements of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended (the " _Securities Act_ ") or the Exchange Act, as the case may be, and the rules and regulations of the SEC promulgated thereunder applicable to such Company SEC Documents, and did not contain any untrue statement of a material fact or omit to state a material fact required to be stated therein or necessary in order to make the statements therein (other than in the case of registration statements of the Company filed under the Securities Act, in light of the circumstances under which they were made) not misleading, except to the extent that such Company SEC Document has been modified or superseded by a later filed Company SEC Document. The consolidated financial statements of the Company included in the Company\'s (i) annual report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended January 25, 2003 and (ii) quarterly report on Form 10-Q for the quarterly period ended April 26, 2003, complied at the time they were filed as to form in all material respects with applicable accounting requirements and the published rules and regulations of the SEC with respect thereto, have been prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the United States (" _GAAP_ ") (except, in the case of unaudited statements, as permitted by Form 10-Q of the SEC) applied on a consistent basis during the periods involved (except as may be indicated in the notes thereto) and each fairly presented in all material respects the consolidated financial position of the Company as of the dates thereof and the consolidated results of its operations and cash flows for the periods then ended (subject, in the case of unaudited statements, to normal year-end audit adjustments). Except for liabilities incurred in connection with the transactions contemplated by this Agreement or in the ordinary course of business since the date of the most recent balance sheet included in the Company SEC Documents, neither the Company nor any Company Subsidiary has any liabilities or obligations of any nature (whether accrued, absolute, contingent or otherwise) required by GAAP to be set forth on a consolidated balance sheet of the Company or the notes thereto which, individually or in the aggregate, would have a Company Material Adverse Effect.

material respects with the requirements of the Exchange Act and the rules and
regulations promulgated thereunder, except that no representation or warranty
is made by the Company with respect to statements made or incorporated by
reference therein based on information supplied by Parent or Sub for inclusion
or incorporation by reference in the Joint Proxy Statement.

" _Knowledge_ " of a party shall mean knowledge of its executive officers, after due inquiry. 

  

 (i) _Absence of Changes in Benefit Plans._ Since January 25, 2003, there has not been any adoption or amendment in any material respect by the Company or any Company Subsidiary of any collective bargaining agreement or any bonus, pension, profit sharing, deferred compensation, incentive compensation, share ownership, share purchase, share option, phantom share, retirement, vacation, severance, disability, death benefit, hospitalization, medical or other plan, arrangement or understanding (whether or not legally binding) providing benefits to any current or former officer or director of the Company or any Company Subsidiary.

including any such plan that is an "employee benefit plan" as defined in

_ERISA_ ") (collectively, " _Company Benefit Plans_ "), are in compliance with
all applicable requirements of law, including ERISA and the Internal Revenue

to Title IV of ERISA. The execution of, and performance of the transactions

plan, policy, arrangement or agreement or any trust or loan that will or may
result in any material payment (whether of severance pay or otherwise),
acceleration, forgiveness of indebtedness, vesting, distribution, increase in
benefits or obligation to fund benefits with respect to any employee. The only
material severance agreements or severance policies applicable to the Company
or the Company Subsidiaries are the agreements and policies specifically

All such Tax Returns are, or will be at the time of filing, true, complete and correct, other than such failures to be true, complete and correct that would not have a Company Material Adverse Effect.

 _Form of Affiliate Letter_

   

Dear Sirs:

  

 The undersigned, a holder of common shares, without par value (" _Company Common Shares_ "), of OfficeMax, Inc., an Ohio corporation (the " _Company_ "), acknowledges that the undersigned may be deemed an "affiliate" of the Company within the meaning of Rule 145 (" _Rule 145_") promulgated under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended (the " _Securities Act_ "), by the Securities and Exchange Commission (the " _SEC_ "), although nothing contained herein should be construed as an admission of such fact. Pursuant to the terms of the Agreement and Plan of Merger dated as of July 13, 2003 among Boise Cascade Corporation, a Delaware corporation (" _Parent_ "), Challis Corporation, an Ohio corporation and a direct, wholly owned subsidiary of Parent (" _Sub_ "), and the Company, Sub will be merged with and into the Company (the " _Merger_ "), and in connection with the Merger, the undersigned is entitled to receive shares of common stock of Parent (" _Parent Common Stock_ "). 

  

 If in fact the undersigned were an affiliate under the Securities Act, the undersigned\'s ability to sell, assign or transfer the shares of Parent Common Stock received by the undersigned in exchange for any Company Common Shares in connection with the Merger may be restricted unless such transaction is registered under the Securities Act or an exemption from such registration is available. The undersigned understands that such exemptions are limited and the undersigned has obtained or will obtain advice of counsel as to the nature and conditions of such exemptions, including information with respect to the applicability to the sale of such securities of Rules 144 and 145(d) promulgated under the Securities Act. The undersigned understands that Parent will not be required, except pursuant to the Registration Rights Agreement, to file or maintain the effectiveness of any registration statement under the Securities Act for the purposes of resale of Parent Common Stock by the undersigned. 

  

 The undersigned hereby represents to and covenants with Parent that the undersigned will not sell, assign or transfer any of the shares of Parent Common Stock received by the undersigned in exchange for Company Common Shares in connection with the Merger except (i) pursuant to an effective registration statement under the Securities Act, (ii) in conformity with the volume and other limitations of Rule 145 or (iii) in a transaction which, in the opinion of counsel to the undersigned, such counsel to be reasonably satisfactory to Parent and such opinion to be in form and substance reasonably satisfactory to Parent, or as described in a "no-action" or interpretive letter from the Staff of the SEC specifically issued with respect to a transaction to be engaged in by the undersigned, is not required to be registered under the Securities Act. 

   

 In the event of a sale or other disposition by the undersigned of the shares of Parent Common Stock pursuant to Rule 145, the undersigned will supply Parent with evidence of compliance with such Rule, in the form of a letter in the form of Annex I hereto or the opinion of counsel or no-action letter referred to above. The undersigned understands that Parent may instruct its transfer agent to withhold the transfer of any shares of Parent Common Stock disposed of by the undersigned, but that (provided such transfer is not prohibited by any other provision of this letter agreement) upon receipt of such evidence of compliance, Parent shall cause the transfer agent to effectuate the transfer of the shares of Parent Common Stock sold as indicated in such letter. 

  

 Parent covenants that it will comply with the informational requirements under the Rule 144(c), or any successor provision thereto, and will take all such other actions as may be reasonably available to it to permit the sale or other disposition of shares of Parent Common Stock by the undersigned under Rule 145 in accordance with the terms thereof. 

  

 The undersigned acknowledges that (i) the undersigned has carefully read this letter and understands the requirements hereof and the limitations imposed upon the distribution, sale, transfer   

or other disposition of Parent Common Stock and (ii) the receipt by Parent of
this letter is an inducement to Parent\'s obligations to consummate the
Merger.

  

     Very truly yours,
