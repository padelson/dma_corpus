<P><FONT SIZE=2>Dear
Sirs: </FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The
undersigned, a holder of common shares, without par value ("</FONT><FONT SIZE=2><I>Company Common Shares</I></FONT><FONT SIZE=2>"), of OfficeMax,&nbsp;Inc., an Ohio corporation
(the "</FONT><FONT SIZE=2><I>Company</I></FONT><FONT SIZE=2>"), acknowledges that the undersigned may be deemed an "affiliate" of the Company within the meaning of Rule&nbsp;145
("</FONT><FONT SIZE=2><I>Rule&nbsp;145</I></FONT><FONT SIZE=2>") promulgated under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended (the "</FONT><FONT SIZE=2><I>Securities Act</I></FONT><FONT SIZE=2>"), by
the Securities and Exchange Commission (the "</FONT><FONT SIZE=2><I>SEC</I></FONT><FONT SIZE=2>"), although nothing contained herein should be construed as an admission of such fact. Pursuant to the
terms of the Agreement and Plan of Merger dated as of July&nbsp;13, 2003 among Boise Cascade Corporation, a Delaware corporation ("</FONT><FONT SIZE=2><I>Parent</I></FONT><FONT SIZE=2>"), Challis

<P><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If
in fact the undersigned were an affiliate under the Securities Act, the undersigned's ability to sell, assign or transfer the shares of Parent Common Stock received by the undersigned
in exchange for any Company Common Shares in connection with the Merger may be restricted unless such transaction is registered under the Securities Act or an exemption from such registration is
available. The undersigned understands that such exemptions are limited and the undersigned has obtained or will obtain advice of counsel as to the nature and conditions of such exemptions, including
information with respect to the applicability to the sale of such securities of Rules&nbsp;144 and 145(d) promulgated under the Securities Act. The undersigned understands that Parent will not be
required, except pursuant to the Registration Rights Agreement, to file or maintain the effectiveness of any registration statement under the Securities Act for the purposes of resale of Parent Common
Stock by the undersigned. </FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The
undersigned hereby represents to and covenants with Parent that the undersigned will not sell, assign or transfer any of the shares of Parent Common Stock received by the undersigned
in exchange for Company Common Shares in connection with the Merger except (i)&nbsp;pursuant to an effective registration statement under the Securities Act, (ii)&nbsp;in conformity with the
volume and other limitations
of Rule&nbsp;145 or (iii)&nbsp;in a transaction which, in the opinion of counsel to the undersigned, such counsel to be reasonably satisfactory to Parent and such opinion to be in form and
substance reasonably satisfactory to Parent, or as described in a "no-action" or interpretive letter from the Staff of the SEC specifically issued with respect to a transaction to be
engaged in by the undersigned, is not required to be registered under the Securities Act. </FONT></P>


<P><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In
the event of a sale or other disposition by the undersigned of the shares of Parent Common Stock pursuant to Rule&nbsp;145, the undersigned will supply Parent with evidence of
compliance with such Rule, in the form of a letter in the form of Annex I hereto or the opinion of counsel or no-action letter referred to above. The undersigned understands that Parent
may instruct its transfer agent to withhold the transfer of any shares of Parent Common Stock disposed of by the undersigned, but that (provided such transfer is not prohibited by any other provision
of this letter agreement) upon receipt of such evidence of compliance, Parent shall cause the transfer agent to effectuate the transfer of the shares of Parent Common Stock sold as indicated in such
letter. </FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Parent
covenants that it will comply with the informational requirements under the Rule&nbsp;144(c), or any successor provision thereto, and will take all such other actions as may be
reasonably available to it to permit the sale or other disposition of shares of Parent Common Stock by the undersigned under Rule&nbsp;145 in accordance with the terms thereof. </FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The
undersigned acknowledges that (i)&nbsp;the undersigned has carefully read this letter and understands the requirements hereof and the limitations imposed upon the distribution,
sale, transfer </FONT></P>
