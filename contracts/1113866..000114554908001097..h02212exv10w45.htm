     1.  |   | INTRODUCTION  
---|---|--- 
      
    |   | The boards of directors of Unicom and Netcom refer to (1) the
Announcement on Deepening the Reform of the Structure of the
Telecommunications Sector dated 24 May 2008 jointly issued by the Ministry of
Industry and Information, the National Development and Reform Commission
and the Ministry of Finance of the PRC which states, among other things, that
the PRC government will deepen the reform of the structure of the
telecommunications sector, and encourage the formation of three market
competitors where each has nationwide network resources,
relatively comparable strength and scale, as well as full service operation
capabilities, that the allocation of telecommunications resources will be
further optimized and the competition structure will be improved, and that
three 3G licences will be granted once the contemplated restructuring is
completed, and (2) the announcements issued by Unicom and Netcom on 25
May 2008.  
      
    |   | The boards of directors of Unicom and Netcom jointly announce
that on 2 June 2008, Unicom formally presented the Proposals (as described in
the paragraphs headed "1. The Proposals", "2. Conditions of the Proposals and
the Scheme" and "3. Further Terms of the Proposals" in the text of this
Announcement) to the board of directors of Netcom and requested the board
to put forward the Proposals to the Netcom Shareholders to consider the
merger of Unicom and Netcom by way of a scheme of arrangement by Netcom under
Section 166 of the Hong Kong Companies Ordinance.  
      
  2.  |   | TERMS OF THE PROPOSALS  
      
    |   | Pursuant to the Share Proposal, the Scheme Shares (including
the Scheme Shares unconditionally issued or to be issued pursuant to the
valid exercise of the outstanding Netcom Options prior to the Scheme Record
Time) will be cancelled and, in consideration thereof, each Scheme
Shareholder will be entitled to receive:  
      
    |   | For every Scheme Share cancelled . . . . . . . . . 1.508 new
Unicom Shares  
      
    |   | Pursuant to the ADS Proposal, the Scheme Shares underlying the
Netcom ADSs will be cancelled and, in consideration thereof, each holder of
Netcom ADSs will be entitled to receive:  
      
    |   | For every Netcom ADS . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 3.016
new Unicom ADSs  
   

 

     ##### 

  

 

 

    

       |   | Each Netcom ADS represents 20 Netcom Shares while each
Unicom ADS represents 10 Unicom Shares. The consideration for the ADS
Proposal is equivalent to the consideration for the Share Proposal and is
calculated using the Share Exchange Ratio and taking into account the number
of Netcom Shares which each Netcom ADS represents and the number of Unicom
Shares which each Unicom ADS represents.  
---|---|--- 
      
    |   | Pursuant to the Option Proposal, Unicom will offer holders of
Netcom Options new Special Unicom Options in exchange for the outstanding
Netcom Options held by them at the Scheme Record Time (whether vested or
not). The number of new Special Unicom Options which will be granted to
each holder of Netcom Options and the exercise price of such new Special
Unicom Options will be determined in accordance with a formula which ensures
that the value of the new Special Unicom Options received by a holder of
Netcom Options is equivalent to the "see- through" price of that holders
outstanding Netcom Options (that is, the value determined by deducting the
exercise price of the relevant Netcom Option from the value of HK$27.87,
being the closing price of each Netcom Share of HK$27.05 on the Hong Kong
Stock Exchange on the Last Trading Date and a 3% premium, for each Scheme
Share pursuant to the Share Proposal). The new Special Unicom Options will be
granted by Unicom pursuant to the Special Purpose Unicom Share Option Scheme
which is proposed to be adopted by Unicom at the Unicom EGM.  
      
    |   | Implementation of the Proposals will be carried out in
accordance with Hong Kong laws, the Takeovers Code, US federal securities
laws and the requirements of the Hong Kong Stock Exchange and the New York
Stock Exchange.  
      
    |   | The directors of Unicom believe that the terms of the Proposals
are fair and reasonable and in the interests of the Unicom Shareholders as a
whole.  
      
    |   | The board of directors of Netcom has established the Netcom
IBC, comprising all of the independent non-executive directors of Netcom,
being Mr. Timpson Chung Shui Ming, Mr. John Lawson Thornton, Dr. Qian Yingyi
and Mr. Hou Ziqiang, to advise the Disinterested Netcom Shareholders and the
holders of Netcom ADSs and Netcom Options as to (a) whether the Proposals are,
or are not, fair and reasonable and (b) whether to vote in favour of the
Scheme at the Court Meeting and the Netcom EGM. The Netcom IBC has appointed
Rothschild as the independent financial adviser to the Netcom IBC in respect
of the Proposals. The Netcom IBC is evaluating the Proposals and the views
and recommendations of the Netcom IBC in respect of the Proposals will be set
out in the Scheme Document to be despatched to the Netcom Shareholders and
the holders of Netcom ADSs and Netcom Options.  
      
    |   | Holders of Unicom Shares, Unicom ADSs, Unicom Options, Netcom
Shares, Netcom ADSs and Netcom Options and potential investors in Unicom and
Netcom should be aware that the implementation of the Proposals (including
the Scheme) is subject to the conditions set out in this Announcement being
satisfied or waived, as applicable, and thus the Proposals (including the
Scheme) may or may not become effective. Holders of Unicom Shares, Unicom
ADSs, Unicom Options, Netcom Shares, Netcom ADSs and Netcom Options and
potential investors of Unicom and Netcom should therefore exercise caution
when dealing in Unicom Shares, Unicom ADSs, Unicom Options, Netcom
Shares, Netcom ADSs or Netcom Options or other securities of Unicom or
Netcom. Persons who are in doubt as to the action they should take should
consult their stockbroker, bank manager, solicitor or other professional
advisers.

    | (d)  |   | the sanction of the Scheme (with or without
modifications) and the confirmation of the reduction of the share capital of
Netcom by the High Court, under Sections 166 and 60, respectively, of the

Court that the new Unicom Shares will be issued by Unicom in reliance on the
exemption from the registration requirements of the US Securities Act provided
by Section 3(a)(10) thereof and applicable exemptions under US state
securities laws);  
      
    | (e)  |   | a copy of the order of the High Court sanctioning the

by Section 61 of the Hong Kong Companies Ordinance, being delivered to and
registered by the Registrar;  
   

 

   

    

      

  ##### 

  

   

     

 

 

    

       | (f)  |   | the Hong Kong Stock Exchange having granted its
approval for the listing of, and permission to deal in, the new Unicom Shares
to be issued pursuant to the Share Proposal and the ADS Proposal and the new
Unicom Shares to be issued upon the exercise of the Special Unicom Options;

    | (g)  |   | the New York Stock Exchange having granted its approval
for the listing of the new Unicom ADSs representing the new Unicom Shares to

    | (h)  |   | all applicable filings, notices and waivers required in
connection with the Proposals (including its implementation) from or with any
governmental or regulatory body having been made and, if applicable, any

    | (i)  |   | all necessary authorisations, consents and approvals
(including approval in-principle) of any governmental or regulatory body in

obtained and remaining in full force and effect pursuant to the provisions of
any laws or regulations in Hong Kong, the PRC, the United States and any
other relevant jurisdictions;  
      
    | (j)  |   | all necessary third party consents in relation to the
Proposals required pursuant to any agreement to which any member of the
Netcom Group is a party (where any failure to obtain a consent would have a
material adverse effect on the business of the Netcom Group taken as a whole)
having been obtained or waived by the relevant party(ies);  
      
    | (k)  |   | no relevant government, governmental, quasi-
governmental, statutory or regulatory body, court or agency having granted
any order or made any decision that would make the Proposals void,
unenforceable or illegal, or restrict or prohibit the implementation of, or
impose any additional material conditions or obligations with respect to, the
Proposals (other than such orders or decisions as would not have a material
adverse effect on the legal ability of Unicom to proceed with or consummate
the Proposals);  
      
    | (l)  |   | confirmation from OFTA that the Proposals will not
have, or be likely to have, the effect of substantially lessening competition
in a telecommunications market in Hong Kong as referred to in Section 7P of
the Telecommunications Ordinance, to the extent that such confirmation is
considered necessary by Unicom and Netcom, acting reasonably;  
      
    | (m)  |   | subject to Note 2 to Rule 30.1 of the Takeovers Code,
no event having occurred which would make the Proposals or the cancellation
of the Scheme Shares or any of the Netcom Options void, unenforceable or
illegal or which would prohibit the implementation of the Proposals or impose
any additional material conditions or obligations with respect to the
Proposals or any part thereof or on the cancellation of the Scheme Shares or
any of the Netcom Options;  
   

 

    

      

  ##### 

  

   

     

 

 

    

       | (n)  |   | subject to Note 2 to Rule 30.1 of the Takeovers
Code, since the date of this Announcement, there having been no material
adverse change in the business, financial or trading position of the Unicom
Group or the Netcom Group, each taken as a whole;  
---|---|---|--- 
      
    | (o)  |   | save in connection with the implementation of the
Proposals, the listing of the Unicom Shares and the Netcom Shares on the Hong
Kong Stock Exchange and the listing of the Unicom ADSs and the Netcom ADSs on
the New York Stock Exchange not having been withdrawn, and no indication
being received from the SFC and/or the Hong Kong Stock Exchange and/or the
SEC and/or the New York Stock Exchange, to the effect that the listing of the
Unicom Shares or the Netcom Shares on the Hong Kong Stock Exchange or
the listing of the Unicom ADSs or the Netcom ADSs on the New York Stock
Exchange is or is likely to be withdrawn; and  
      
    | (p)  |   | save for the payment of a final dividend of HK$0.592
for each Netcom Share as approved by the Netcom Shareholders at the annual
general meeting of Netcom held on 22 May 2008, since the date of this
Announcement and up to the Effective Date, Netcom not having declared, made
or paid any dividend or distribution of any kind, and not agreeing
or proposing to declare, make or pay any dividend or distribution of any
kind.  
   

  

       |   | Unicom reserves the right to waive all or any of the
conditions (except for the conditions referred to in paragraphs (a) to (m)
and paragraph (o) above) in whole or in part. Netcom does not have the right
to waive any of the conditions. All of the above conditions will have to be
satisfied or waived, as applicable, on or before 30 September 2008 (or such
other date as Unicom and Netcom may agree and the High Court may allow),
otherwise the Share Proposal and the Scheme will lapse.  
---|---|--- 
      
    |   | Assuming that the above conditions are satisfied or waived, as
applicable, it is expected that the Scheme will become effective on or before
31 October 2008.  
      
    |   | Each of the ADS Proposal and the Option Proposal will be
conditional upon the Scheme becoming effective.  
      
  4.  |   | WITHDRAWAL OF LISTING OF THE NETCOM SHARES AND THE NETCOM ADSs
   
      
    |   | Upon the Scheme becoming effective, all the Scheme Shares
(including the Scheme Shares underlying the Netcom ADSs) will be cancelled.
The share certificates for the Scheme Shares will thereafter cease to have
effect as documents or evidence of title. An application will be made by
Netcom to the Hong Kong Stock Exchange for the voluntary withdrawal of the
listing of the Netcom Shares from the Hong Kong Stock Exchange pursuant to
Rule 6.15 of the Listing Rules immediately following the Effective Date,
which is subject to the approval of the Listing Committee of the Hong Kong
Stock Exchange.  
   

 

   

     ##### 

  

 

 

    

       |   | Upon the Scheme becoming effective, Unicom intends to
cause Netcom to apply for delisting of the Netcom ADSs from the New York
Stock Exchange. Unicom may also seek to cause Netcom to terminate the Netcom
ADS Deposit Agreement. If the Scheme becomes effective, Unicom intends to
cause Netcom to file a Form 15 with the SEC to request that Netcoms reporting
obligations under the US Securities Exchange Act be terminated or suspended,
because the effectiveness of the Scheme will cause the number of holders of
Netcom Shares in the United States to fall below 300.  
---|---|--- 
      
    |   | The listing of the Netcom Shares on the Hong Kong Stock
Exchange and the Netcom ADSs on the New York Stock Exchange will not be
withdrawn if the Proposals are not approved, lapse or do not become
unconditional for any reason.  
      
  5.  |   | UNDERTAKINGS  
      
    |   | Netcom BVI has given an irrevocable undertaking to Unicom to
vote in favour of all resolutions to approve the Scheme and any related
matters necessary to implement the Scheme proposed at the Court Meeting and
the Netcom EGM in respect of its legal and beneficial shareholding in Netcom
of 4,647,449,014 Netcom Shares (representing approximately 69.37% of the
issued share capital of Netcom as at the Last Trading Date). Under the
irrevocable undertaking, Netcom Parent has undertaken to use its best
endeavours to procure the performance by Netcom BVI of its obligations under
the irrevocable undertaking.  
      
    |   | Netcom BVI has also received an irrevocable instruction to vote
in favour of all resolutions to approve the Scheme and any related matters
necessary to implement the Scheme proposed at the Court Meeting and the
Netcom EGM in respect of the 149,683,549 Netcom Shares (representing
approximately 2.23% of the issued share capital of Netcom as at the
Last Trading Date), which Netcom BVI holds as trustee on behalf of a state-
owned entity.  
      
    |   | In addition, Telefonica has given an irrevocable undertaking to
Unicom to vote in favour of all resolutions to approve the Scheme and any
related matters necessary to implement the Scheme proposed at the Court
Meeting and the Netcom EGM in respect of its shareholding in Netcom of
333,971,305 Netcom Shares (representing approximately 4.99% of the issued
share capital of Netcom as at the Last Trading Date).  
      
    |   | Under the terms of the irrevocable undertakings given by Netcom
BVI and Telefonica and the irrevocable instruction received by Netcom BVI,
the undertakings and the instruction will lapse (a) if this Announcement has
not been released by 30 June 2008, (b) if Unicom announces, with the consent
of the Executive and before the Scheme Document is posted, that it does
not intend to proceed with the Scheme, (c) if the Scheme lapses or is
withdrawn in accordance with its terms or (d) in the event of a higher
competing offer for Netcom made by a third party.  
      
    |   | In addition to conditions (a) to (d) above, the undertaking
given by Netcom BVI and the irrevocable instruction received by Netcom BVI
will lapse if the Scheme is not approved at the Court Meeting or the Netcom
EGM.  
   

 

     ##### 

  

 

 

    

       |   | In addition to conditions (a) to (d) above, the
undertaking given by Telefonica will lapse (e) if the Scheme is not approved
at the Court Meeting or the Netcom EGM by 30 November 2008, (f) if since the
date of the giving of the undertaking, there has been a material
adverse change in the business, financial or trading position of Unicom or
(g) in the event that the Netcom IFA appointed by the Netcom IBC does not
render an opinion that the Proposals are fair and reasonable.  
---|---|--- 
      
  6.  |   | POSSIBLE CONCERT PARTY AGREEMENT  
      
    |   | Each of Unicom and Netcom has been informed by Unicom BVI and
Netcom BVI, respectively, that they are not and have never been parties
acting in concert with each other or with or in respect of either Unicom or
Netcom. Each of Unicom and Netcom has further been informed that Unicom BVI
and Netcom BVI intend to enter into the Concert Party Agreement upon or
shortly after the last to occur of (i) the Proposals and the issue of new
Unicom Shares being duly approved by the requisite majority of the Unicom
Shareholders at the Unicom EGM, (ii) the Scheme being duly approved by the
requisite majority of the Disinterested Netcom Shareholders at the Court
Meeting and (iii) the special resolutions being duly passed with the
requisite majority of the Netcom Shareholders at the Netcom EGM. Pursuant to
the Concert Party Agreement, Unicom BVI and Netcom BVI will agree to
cooperate actively to obtain or consolidate control of Unicom following the
completion of the Scheme. Thus, Unicom BVI and Netcom BVI will become parties
acting in concert in respect of Unicom following the completion of the
Scheme. In addition, following the completion of the Scheme, Unicom BVI
and Netcom BVI will also be presumed to be acting in concert with each other
in respect of Unicom pursuant to class (1) of the definition of "acting in
concert" in the Takeovers Code.  
      
    |   | On 26 May 2008, the State-owned Assets Supervision and
Administration Commission notified each of Unicom Parent and Netcom Parent,
the respective ultimate parent companies of Unicom and Netcom, that, among
other things, it may, depending on the outcome of any proposed merger of
Unicom and Netcom, consider a merger of Unicom Parent and Netcom Parent. Each
of Unicom Parent and Netcom Parent has confirmed to Unicom and Netcom,
respectively, that it has not received any notice or other indication and
that it is not otherwise aware of the timing or any term of or condition to
such merger. On this basis, any merger of Unicom Parent and Netcom Parent
will not result in any change of control of Unicom or Netcom and will not
give rise to any implication under Rule 26 of the Takeovers Code.  
      
  7.  |   | POSSIBLE VERY SUBSTANTIAL ACQUISITION, ALLOTMENT AND ISSUE OF
NEW UNICOM SHARES AND ADOPTION OF SPECIAL PURPOSE UNICOM SHARE OPTION
SCHEME  
      
    |   | The implementation of the Proposals will result in Netcom
becoming a wholly-owned subsidiary of Unicom and as the highest of the
percentage ratios set out in Rule 14.07 of the Listing Rules in respect of
the implementation of the Proposals is more than 100%, the Proposals
will constitute a possible very substantial acquisition for Unicom under the
Listing Rules. The Proposals are therefore conditional upon the approval of
the Unicom Shareholders in general meeting.  
   

 

   

     ##### 

  

 

 

    

       |   | The allotment and issue of new Unicom Shares to the
Scheme Shareholders pursuant to the Share Proposal and to the Unicom
Depositary pursuant to the ADS Proposal is subject to the approval of the
Unicom Shareholders in general meeting pursuant to Rule 13.36(1)(a) of the
Listing Rules.  
---|---|--- 
      
    |   | The adoption of the Special Purpose Unicom Share Option Scheme
by Unicom is subject to the approval of the Unicom Shareholders in general
meeting pursuant to Rule 17.02(1)(a) of the Listing Rules.  
      
    |   | None of the Unicom Shareholders have a material interest in the
Very Substantial Acquisition, the allotment and issue of new Unicom Shares to
the Scheme Shareholders and the adoption of the Special Purpose Unicom Share
Option Scheme by Unicom. Accordingly, none of the Unicom Shareholders are
required to abstain from voting at the Unicom EGM. However,
notwithstanding the foregoing, an independent non-executive director of
Netcom who holds 6,000 Unicom Shares has undertaken to Netcom that he will
abstain from voting at the Unicom EGM.  
      
    |   | The resolutions relating to the Very Substantial Acquisition,
the allotment and issue of new Unicom Shares to the Scheme Shareholders and
the adoption of the Special Purpose Unicom Share Option Scheme will be
approved by way of a poll at the Unicom EGM.  
      
  8.  |   | DISPOSAL OF THE CDMA BUSINESS BY UNICOM  
      
    |   | On 2 June 2008, Unicom entered into a framework agreement with
CUCL, a wholly-owned subsidiary of Unicom, and China Telecom which sets out
the terms and conditions on which CUCL will dispose of its CDMA business
together with relevant assets and liabilities to China Telecom. Such disposal
will constitute a major transaction for Unicom and is subject to the approval
of the Unicom Shareholders. Details of the disposal and the relevant
transactions which are proposed to be entered into in connection with the
disposal are set out in a separate announcement issued by Unicom dated 2 June
2008\. Unicom expects that the disposal of the CDMA business by Unicom will
be completed before the Effective Date. The disposal of the CDMA business by
Unicom is a separate and independent transaction from the Proposals.  
      
  9.  |   | RESUMPTION OF TRADING  
      
    |   | At the request of Unicom, trading in the Unicom Shares on the
Hong Kong Stock Exchange was suspended from 12:26 p.m. on 23 May 2008 (Hong
Kong time) and trading in the Unicom ADSs on the New York Stock Exchange was
suspended from 9:30 a.m. on 23 May 2008 (New York time). An application has
been made by Unicom to the Hong Kong Stock Exchange for the resumption
of trading in the Unicom Shares from 9:30 a.m. on 3 June 2008 (Hong Kong
time). It is expected that trading in the Unicom ADSs on the New York Stock
Exchange will resume on either 2 June 2008, or 3 June 2008.  
   

 

     ##### 

  

 

 

    

       |   | At the request of Netcom, trading in the Netcom Shares on
the Hong Kong Stock Exchange was suspended from 12:26 p.m. on 23 May 2008
(Hong Kong time) and trading in the Netcom ADSs on the New York Stock
Exchange was suspended from 9:30 a.m. on 23 May 2008 (New York time). An
application has been made by Netcom to the Hong Kong Stock Exchange for
the resumption of trading in the Netcom Shares from 9:30 a.m. on 3 June 2008
(Hong Kong time). It is expected that trading in the Netcom ADSs on the New
York Stock Exchange will resume on either 2 June 2008 or 3 June 2008.

     1.  |   | THE PROPOSALS  
---|---|--- 
      
    |   | Introduction  
      
    |   | The boards of directors of Unicom and Netcom refer to (1) the
Announcement on Deepening the Reform of the Structure of the
Telecommunications Sector dated 24 May 2008 jointly issued by the Ministry of
Industry and Information, the National Development and Reform Commission
and the Ministry of Finance of the PRC which states, among other things, that
the PRC government will deepen the reform of the structure of the
telecommunications sector, and encourage the formation of three market
competitors where each has nationwide network resources,
relatively comparable strength and scale, as well as full service operation
capabilities, that the allocation of telecommunications resources will be
further optimized and the competition structure will be improved, and that
three 3G licences will be granted once the contemplated restructuring is
completed, and (2) the announcements issued by Unicom and Netcom on 25
May 2008.  
      
    |   | The boards of directors of Unicom and Netcom jointly announce
that on 2 June 2008, Unicom formally presented the Proposals (as described in
the paragraphs headed "1. The Proposals", "2. Conditions of the Proposals and
the Scheme" and "3. Further Terms of the Proposals" in the text of this
Announcement) to the board of directors of Netcom and requested the board
to put forward the Proposals to the Netcom Shareholders to consider the
merger of Unicom and Netcom by way of a scheme of arrangement by Netcom under
Section 166 of the Hong Kong Companies Ordinance.  
      
    |   | The Proposals involve the cancellation of all Scheme Shares
(including (1) the Scheme Shares unconditionally issued or to be issued
pursuant to the valid exercise of the outstanding Netcom Options prior to the
Scheme Record Time and (2) the Scheme Shares underlying the Netcom ADSs) and
all Netcom Options outstanding at the Scheme Record Time.  
      
    |   | If approved, the Scheme will be binding on all Netcom
Shareholders irrespective of whether they attended or voted at the Court
Meeting or the Netcom EGM.  
      
    |   | Implementation of the Proposals will be carried out in
accordance with Hong Kong laws, the Takeovers Code, US federal securities
laws and the requirements of the Hong Kong Stock Exchange and the New York
Stock Exchange.  
   

    ##### 

  

     

       |   | The Share Proposal  
---|---|--- 
      
    |   | Pursuant to the Share Proposal, the Scheme Shares (including
the Scheme Shares unconditionally issued or to be issued pursuant to the
valid exercise of the outstanding Netcom Options prior to the Scheme Record
Time) will be cancelled and, in consideration thereof, each Scheme
Shareholder will be entitled to receive:  
      
    |   | For every Scheme Share cancelled ...1.508 new Unicom Shares  
      
    |   | Under the Share Proposal, the share capital of Netcom will, on
the Effective Date, be reduced by cancelling and extinguishing the Scheme
Shares and immediately thereafter, the issued share capital of Netcom will be
increased to the amount prior to the cancellation of the Scheme Shares and
the reserve created as a result of such cancellation of the Scheme Shares will
be applied to pay up in full the issue of the New Netcom Shares to Unicom at
par, credited as fully paid.  
      
    |   | The exchange ratio of 1.508 Unicom Shares for every Scheme
Share cancelled (the "Share Exchange Ratio") was determined by Unicom on the
basis of the closing price of each Netcom Share of HK$27.05 on the Hong Kong
Stock Exchange on the Last Trading Date and a 3% premium, and the closing
price of each Unicom Share of HK$18.48 on the Hong Kong Stock Exchange on the
Last Trading Date.  
      
    |   | Based on the Share Exchange Ratio and 6,699,197,200 Netcom
Shares in issue as at the Last Trading Date (assuming that none of the
outstanding Netcom Options are exercised), the maximum number of new Unicom
Shares that Unicom will issue is 10,102,389,378. This represents
approximately 73.94% of the existing issued share capital of Unicom of
13,662,075,945 Unicom Shares as at the Last Trading Date, and approximately
42.51% of the enlarged issued share capital of Unicom of 23,764,465,323
Unicom Shares immediately following the issue of the new Unicom
Shares (assuming that none of the outstanding Unicom Options are exercised)
and approximately 42.11% of the enlarged issued share capital of Unicom of
23,993,094,923 Unicom Shares immediately following the issue of the new
Unicom Shares (assuming that all of the outstanding Unicom Options
are exercised).  
      
    |   | Based on the Share Exchange Ratio and 6,825,034,460 Netcom
Shares in issue as at the Last Trading Date (assuming that all of the
outstanding Netcom Options are exercised), the maximum number of new Unicom
Shares that Unicom will issue is 10,292,151,966. This represents
approximately 75.33% of the existing issued share capital of Unicom of
13,662,075,945 Unicom Shares as at the Last Trading Date, and approximately
42.97% of the enlarged issued share capital of Unicom of 23,954,227,911
Unicom Shares immediately following the issue of the new Unicom
Shares (assuming that none of the outstanding Unicom Options are exercised)
and approximately 42.56% of the enlarged issued share capital of Unicom of
24,182,857,511 Unicom Shares immediately following the issue of the new
Unicom Shares (assuming that all of the outstanding Unicom Options
are exercised).  
   

    ##### 

  

     

       |   | The ADS Proposal  
---|---|--- 
      
    |   | As the Netcom ADSs are governed by the Netcom ADS Deposit
Agreement and not Hong Kong law, implementation of the ADS Proposal will not
result in and of itself in the cancellation of the Netcom ADSs. Instead,
pursuant to the ADS Proposal, the Scheme Shares underlying the Netcom
ADSs will be cancelled along with all other Scheme Shares and, in
consideration thereof, each holder of Netcom ADSs will be entitled to
receive:  
      
    |   | For every Netcom ADS . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .
3.016 new Unicom ADSs  
      
    |   | As at the Last ADS Trading Date, there were 7,218,677 Netcom
ADSs outstanding. Each Netcom ADS represents 20 Netcom Shares while each
Unicom ADS represents 10 Unicom Shares.  
      
    |   | The consideration for the ADS Proposal is equivalent to the
consideration for the Share Proposal and is calculated using the Share
Exchange Ratio and taking into account the number of Netcom Shares which each
Netcom ADS represents and the number of Unicom Shares which each Unicom
ADS represents.  
      
    |   | The Option Proposal  
      
    |   | As at the Last Trading Date, there were 125,837,260 Netcom
Options outstanding. In the event that any Netcom Option is validly exercised
after the date of this Announcement but prior to the Scheme Record Time and
new Netcom Shares are issued pursuant to such exercise, such Netcom Shares as
at the Scheme Record Time shall constitute Scheme Shares and their holders
shall be eligible to receive the consideration under the Share Proposal and
their Scheme Shares will be cancelled under the Scheme.  
      
    |   | Pursuant to the Option Proposal, Unicom will offer holders of
Netcom Options new Special Unicom Options in exchange for the outstanding
Netcom Options held by them at the Scheme Record Time (whether vested or
not).  
      
    |   | The number of new Special Unicom Options which will be granted
to each holder of Netcom Options and the exercise price of such new Special
Unicom Options will be determined in the manner set out below.  
   

  

Number of new Special Unicom Options = A x B 

   

Exercise price of each new Special Unicom Option = C/A  

  

       |   | where:  
---|---|--- 
      
    |   | A is the Share Exchange Ratio;  
      
    |   | B is the number of outstanding Netcom Options held by the
relevant holder of Netcom Options at the Scheme Record Time; and  
   

  ##### 

  

   

     

  

       |   | C is the exercise price of the outstanding Netcom Options
held by the relevant holder of Netcom Options at the Scheme Record Time.  
---|---|--- 
      
    |   | The above formula ensures that the value of the new Special
Unicom Options received by a holder of Netcom Options is equivalent to the
"see-through" price of that holders outstanding Netcom Options (that is, the
value determined by deducting the exercise price of the relevant
Netcom Option from the value of HK$27.87, being the closing price of each
Netcom Share of HK$27.05 on the Hong Kong Stock Exchange on the Last Trading
Date and a 3% premium, for each Scheme Share pursuant to the Share Proposal)
(the "See-Through Price").  
      
    |   | The new Special Unicom Options will be granted by Unicom
pursuant to the Special Purpose Unicom Share Option Scheme which is proposed
to be adopted by Unicom at the Unicom EGM. The terms of the Special Purpose
Unicom Share Option Scheme will be identical to the Netcom Share Option
Scheme, except that:  
   

  

       | (a)  |   | the exercise price of the new Special Unicom
Options granted will be such price which will result in the value of the new
Special Unicom Options received by the holders of the outstanding Netcom
Options being equivalent to the See-Through Price; and  
---|---|---|--- 
      
    | (b)  |   | other than the new Special Unicom Options to be granted
pursuant to the Option Proposal, no further new Special Unicom Options will
be granted under the Special Purpose Unicom Share Option Scheme.  
   

  

       |   | Unicom has applied to the Hong Kong Stock Exchange for a
waiver from strict compliance with the requirement of Rule 17.03(9) of the
Listing Rules so that the exercise price of the new Special Unicom Options
granted under the Special Purpose Unicom Share Option Scheme is such price
as described above instead of a price determined by reference to the closing
price or the five day average closing price of the Unicom Shares prior to the
date of grant of the new Special Unicom Options as required by Rule 17.03(9)
of the Listing Rules. The reasons for the waiver application are that the
Option Proposal would ensure that the holders of Netcom Options will receive
a consideration for their outstanding Netcom Options which is comparable to
the consideration which the Scheme Shareholders will receive for the Scheme
Shares, the Option Proposal is a unique case and strict compliance with the
requirement of Rule 17.03(9) of the Listing Rules would be unfair and
impractical and the Option Proposal would also ensure that the holders of
Netcom Options are incentivised to remain in the employment of the enlarged
group following the completion of the Scheme.  
---|---|--- 
      
    |   | Save for the waiver from strict compliance with the requirement
of Rule 17.03(9) of the Listing Rules, the Special Purpose Unicom Share
Option Scheme will be in compliance with the requirements of Chapter 17 of
the Listing Rules. Further details of the Special Purpose Unicom Share
Option Scheme will be included in the circular to be despatched to the Unicom
Shareholders.  
      
    |   | Other than the Netcom Shares, the Netcom ADSs and the Netcom
Options, there are no other options, derivatives, warrants or other
securities convertible or exchangeable into Netcom Shares.

issued free from all liens, charges and encumbrances and together with all
rights attaching to them, including the right to receive all dividends and
other distributions, if any, declared, made or paid on or after the date of

Proposal and the ADS Proposal, including the new Unicom Shares underlying the
new Unicom ADSs, will be issued in reliance upon the exemption from the
registration requirements of the US Securities Act provided by Section
3(a)(10) thereof. As a consequence, the new Unicom Shares will not be
registered under the US Securities Act. Although the new Unicom Shares will
not be registered under the US Securities Act, the holders will not be
subject to any restrictions on resale of such new Unicom Shares and new  
   

   ##### 

  

  

       |   | Unicom ADSs under to US federal securities laws, except
that holders of new Unicom Shares or new Unicom ADSs who are deemed to be an
"affiliate" of Unicom within the meaning of US federal securities laws will
be subject to resale restrictions under US federal securities laws.  
---|---|--- 
      
    |   | An application will be made to the Hong Kong Stock Exchange for
the listing of, and permission to deal in, the new Unicom Shares to be issued
pursuant to the Share Proposal and the ADS Proposal and the new Unicom Shares
to be issued upon the exercise of the Special Unicom Options. In addition,

issued pursuant to the ADS Proposal.  
      
    |   | Overseas Shareholders  
      
    |   | The making of the Proposals to persons not resident in Hong
Kong may be subject to the laws of the relevant jurisdictions. Such persons

to satisfy themselves as to the full observance of the laws of the relevant
jurisdiction in connection therewith, including the obtaining of any
governmental, exchange control or other consents which may be required, or
the compliance with other necessary formalities and the payment of any issue,

ADSs  
      
    |   | Upon the Scheme becoming effective, all the Scheme Shares
(including the Scheme Shares underlying the Netcom ADSs) will be cancelled.
The share certificates for the Scheme Shares will thereafter cease to have
effect as documents or evidence of title. An application will be made by
Netcom to the Hong Kong Stock Exchange for the voluntary withdrawal of the
listing of the Netcom Shares from the Hong Kong Stock Exchange pursuant to
Rule 6.15 of the Listing Rules immediately following the Effective Date,
which is subject to the approval of the Listing Committee of the Hong Kong
Stock Exchange.  
      
    |   | Upon the Scheme becoming effective, Unicom intends to cause
Netcom to apply for delisting of the Netcom ADSs from the New York Stock
Exchange. Unicom may also seek to cause Netcom to terminate the Netcom ADS
Deposit Agreement. If the Scheme becomes effective, Unicom intends to cause
Netcom to file a Form 15 with the SEC to request that Netcoms reporting
obligations under the US Securities Exchange Act be terminated or suspended,
because the effectiveness of the Scheme will cause the number of holders of
Netcom Shares in the United States to fall below 300.  
      
    |   | The Netcom Shareholders and the holders of the Netcom ADSs will
be notified by way of a press announcement of the proposed withdrawal of
listing and the exact dates of the last day for dealing in the Netcom Shares
and the Netcom ADSs and on which dates the Scheme and the withdrawal of the
listing of the Netcom Shares on the Hong Kong Stock Exchange and
the delisting of the Netcom ADSs from the New York Stock Exchange will become
effective.  
      

  ##### 

  

   

     

  

       |   | The listing of the Netcom Shares on the Hong Kong Stock
Exchange and the Netcom ADSs on the New York Stock Exchange will not be
withdrawn if the Proposals are not approved, lapse or do not become
unconditional for any reason.

    ##### 

  

     

     6.  |   | POSSIBLE CONCERT PARTY AGREEMENT  
---|---|--- 
      
    |   | Each of Unicom and Netcom has been informed by Unicom BVI and
Netcom BVI, respectively, that they are not and have never been parties
acting in concert with each other or with or in respect of either Unicom or
Netcom. Each of Unicom and Netcom has further been informed that Unicom BVI
and Netcom BVI intend to enter into the Concert Party Agreement upon or
shortly after the last to occur of (i) the Proposals and the issue of new
Unicom Shares being duly approved by the requisite majority of the Unicom
Shareholders at the EGM, (ii) the Scheme being duly approved by the requisite
majority of the Disinterested Netcom Shareholders at the Court Meeting and
(iii) the special resolutions being duly passed with the requisite
majority of the Netcom Shareholders at the Netcom EGM. Pursuant to the
Concert Party Agreement, Unicom BVI and Netcom BVI will agree to cooperate
actively to obtain or consolidate control of Unicom following the completion
of the Scheme. Thus, Unicom BVI and Netcom BVI will become parties acting in
concert in respect of Unicom following the completion of the Scheme.
In addition, following the completion of the Scheme, Unicom BVI and Netcom
BVI will also be presumed to be acting in concert with each other in respect
of Unicom pursuant to class (1) of the definition of "acting in concert" in
the Takeovers Code.  
      
    |   | On 26 May 2008, the State-owned Assets Supervision and
Administration Commission notified each of Unicom Parent and Netcom Parent,
the respective ultimate parent companies of Unicom and Netcom, that, among
other things, it may, depending on the outcome of any proposed merger of
Unicom and Netcom, consider a merger of Unicom Parent and Netcom Parent. Each
of Unicom Parent and Netcom Parent has confirmed to Unicom and Netcom,
respectively, that it has not received any notice or other indication and
that it is not otherwise aware of the timing or any term of or condition to
such merger. On this basis, any merger of Unicom Parent and Netcom Parent
will not result in any change of control of Unicom or Netcom and will not
give rise to any implication under Rule 26 of the Takeovers Code.  
      
  7.  |   | REASONS FOR AND BENEFITS OF THE PROPOSALS  
      
    |   | The management teams of Unicom and Netcom believe that the
proposed merger represents an important transaction for both companies,
following the industry trend of convergence between fixed lines and wireless
businesses within China, allowing the two companies to leverage on increased
economies of scale, reinforce their market position of the enlarged group,
improve their overall competitiveness and lay the foundation for sustainable
long-term growth. It is anticipated that through effective integration,
synergies will occur in six key areas.  
   

  

       | (1)  |   | Clear strategic positioning  
---|---|---|--- 
      
    |   |   | The proposed merger, the potential disposal of the CDMA
business, and the expected issuance of 3G licences to be issued by the PRC
government is expected to optimise the enlarged groups business structure,
allowing it to provide a full spectrum and multi-tiered suite of wireless,
fixed, broadband and data value adding services to its subscribers. In the
wireless sector, the  
   

  ##### 

  

   

     

  

       |   |   | enlarged group intends to focus on GSM businesses
and promptly establish a leading edge over competitors based on 3G
technologies. Furthermore, the enlarged group intend to build up a market
leading professional service system, laying the foundation for its long-term
growth potential.  
---|---|---|--- 
      
    | (2)  |   | Improved market position  
      
    |   |   | The proposed merger is expected to result in the creation
of a significantly larger business in terms of total assets, revenue and
subscriber base, with enhanced scope for future financial strength and
profitability. The anticipated overall strengthening of the enlarged group
should help to consolidate and elevate the competitive position and market
influence of the enlarged group in the Chinese telecommunications market.  
      
    | (3)  |   | Combining resources and strengths to achieve economies
of scale and larger scope  
      
    |   |   | _Sales channels:_ By integrating the leading sales
channels of Unicom and Netcom in their respective sectors, the enlarged group
plans to establish a single national network of sales, distribution and
service, particularly in Chinas ten Northern provinces. The management plans
to further rationalise the network structure and enhance operation efficiency
going forward.  
      
    |   |   | _Subscriber base:_ The combination of Netcoms strength
in fixed line and broadband services with Unicoms strength in wireless
business is expected to result in a wider customer base through sharing
customer resources and focusing on customer retention. In
particular, Netcoms strength among corporate and business customers can be
leveraged to offer integrated full- service products.  
      
    |   |   | _Network coverage:_ The combination of the networks of
both companies is expected to improve network capacity and transmission
quality and to result in improved utilisation of current network and hardware
resources.  
      
    |   |   | _Marketing:_ The enlarged group is expected to be better
able to tailor its marketing programs and to cross-sell and bundle its
services and products to different subscribers, improving customer loyalty.
Meanwhile, the economies of scale offered by the integrated sales
and marketing capacity should allow the enlarged group to reduce churn and
enhance efficiency.  
      
    | (4)  |   | Technological and product innovation to suit the ever-
changing market trends  
      
    |   |   | By leveraging the technological expertise of Unicom and
Netcom in their respective sectors, their combined business is expected to
operate on a single research and development platform which allows for
development of telecommunication services and products integrating
the wireless, fixed lines, broadband and internet technologies. This should
enable the enlarged group to focus its resources on its key business
development areas and thus enhance the overall groups competency.  
   

   ##### 

  

  

       |   |   | _Fixed mobile convergence (FMC):_ The proposed
merger is expected to facilitate integration of fixed line telecommunications
products, mobile telecommunications products, terminals, network and
technologies.  
---|---|---|--- 
      
    |   |   | _Effective coverage services:_ It is expected that the
enlarged group will be able to provide effective coverage services by
leveraging a combination of indoor WiFi/broadband capabilities alongside
existing and anticipated outdoor coverage services (GSM/GPRS/3G), thereby
enhancing the development of fixed lines and mobile broadband business.  
      
    |   |   | _Bundled "all-in-one" services:_ The enlarged group is
expected to be better able to offer one- stop services for corporate and
business customers, as well as broadband and multimedia communication
services for family and personal customers.  
      
    |   |   | _Value-added services:_ The enlarged group is expected to
be better able to broaden the scope of value-added services and realise
resource sharing among different channels and terminals. It is anticipated
that the overall value-added services business will be strengthened
through better utilisation of the network resources and development of the
business potential.  
      
    | (5)  |   | Enhanced human capital and organisational structure  
      
    |   |   | The combined professional experience of both companies in
mobile telecommunications and fixed line telecommunications is expected to
create a pool of experienced and highly skilled professionals covering the
full range of business lines. Moreover, integration of the various businesses
and sharing of management expertise is expected to improve operating
efficiency.  
      
    | (6)  |   | Optimising capital structure and enhanced financial
capabilities  
      
    |   |   | The proposed merger of the two companies and the sale of
the CDMA business is expected to enhance the enlarged groups ability to
optimise its capital structure through adjusting leverage. Furthermore, it is
anticipated that the sharing of resources will contribute to reduce overall
capital expenditures and operating expenditures, which is expected to
increase financial resources and financing abilities available for the
further development of the core businesses.  
      
    |   |   | The directors of Unicom believe that the terms of the
Proposals are fair and reasonable and in the interests of the Unicom
Shareholders as a whole.  
      
    |   |   | The Netcom IBC, which comprises all the independent non-
executive directors of Netcom, has been appointed to advise the Disinterested
Netcom Shareholders and the holders of Netcom ADSs and Netcom Options in
respect of the Proposals. The Netcom IBC is yet to opine on the Proposals.
The views and recommendations of the Netcom IBC in respect of the Proposals
will be set out in the Scheme Document to be despatched to the Netcom
Shareholders and the holders of Netcom ADSs and Netcom Options.

       |   | Interests in Netcom Shares and Derivatives  
---|---|--- 
      
    |   | As at the date of this Announcement, save for an aggregate of
14,679,875 Netcom Shares 
 (representing approximately 0.22% of the issued share capital of Netcom as
at the Last Trading Date) held by the JP Morgan group (including its
affiliate, Bear Stearns), neither Unicom nor any of the parties acting in
concert with it owns, controls or directs any Netcom Shares or holds any
convertible securities, warrants or options (or other
outstanding derivatives) in respect of Netcom Shares.  
      
    |   | Unicom has not dealt for value in Netcom Shares or convertible
securities, warrants or options 
 (or other outstanding derivatives) in respect of Netcom Shares during the
six month period up to and including the date of this Announcement. Any
dealings in Netcom Shares and other Netcom securities by the parties acting
in concert with Unicom in relation to the Proposals during the six month
period up to and including the date of this Announcement will be disclosed in
the Scheme Document.  
   

  

     10.  |   | POSSIBLE VERY SUBSTANTIAL ACQUISITION, ALLOTMENT OF NEW
UNICOM SHARES AND ADOPTION OF SPECIAL PURPOSE UNICOM SHARE OPTION SCHEME  
---|---|--- 
   

  

       |   | The implementation of the Proposals will result in Netcom
becoming a wholly-owned subsidiary of Unicom and as the highest of the
percentage ratios set out in Rule 14.07 of the Listing Rules in respect of
the implementation of the Proposals is more than 100%, the Proposals
will constitute a possible very substantial acquisition for Unicom under the
Listing Rules. The Proposals are therefore conditional upon the approval of
the Unicom Shareholders in general meeting.  
---|---|--- 
      
    |   | The allotment and issue of new Unicom Shares to the Scheme
Shareholders pursuant to the Share Proposal and to the Unicom Depositary
pursuant to the ADS Proposal is subject to the approval of the Unicom
Shareholders in general meeting pursuant to Rule 13.36(1)(a) of the
Listing Rules.  
      
    |   | The adoption of the Special Purpose Unicom Share Option Scheme
by Unicom is subject to the approval of the Unicom Shareholders in general
meeting pursuant to Rule 17.02(1)(a) of the Listing Rules.  
      
    |   | None of the Unicom Shareholders have a material interest in the
Very Substantial Acquisition, the allotment and issue of new Unicom Shares to
the Scheme Shareholders and the adoption of the Special Purpose Unicom Share
Option Scheme by Unicom. Accordingly, none of the Unicom Shareholders are
required to abstain from voting at the Unicom EGM. However,
notwithstanding the foregoing, an independent non-executive director of
Netcom who holds 6,000 Unicom Shares has undertaken to Netcom that he will
abstain from voting at the Unicom EGM.  
      
    |   | The resolutions relating to the Very Substantial Acquisition,
the allotment and issue of new Unicom Shares to the Scheme Shareholders and
the adoption of the Special Purpose Unicom Share Option Scheme will be
approved by way of a poll at the Unicom EGM.  
    

  ##### 

  

   

     

  

       |   | To the best of the knowledge, information and belief of
the directors of Unicom, having made all reasonable enquiries, Netcom and its
substantial shareholders are third parties independent of Unicom and its
connected persons.  
---|---|--- 
      
    |   | To the best of the knowledge, information and belief of the
directors of Unicom, having made reasonable enquiries, none of the Netcom
Shareholders are connected persons of Unicom and accordingly, the Proposals
do not constitute a connected transaction for Unicom.  
   

  

     11.  |   | NETCOM IBC AND NETCOM IFA  
---|---|--- 
   

  

       |   | The board of directors of Netcom has established the
Netcom IBC, comprising all of the independent non-executive directors of
Netcom, being Mr. Timpson Chung Shui Ming, Mr. John Lawson Thornton, Dr. Qian
Yingyi and Mr. Hou Ziqiang, to advise the Disinterested Netcom Shareholders
and the holders of Netcom ADSs and Netcom Options as to (a) whether
the Proposals are, or are not, fair and reasonable and (b) whether to vote in
favour of the Scheme at the Court Meeting and the Netcom EGM.  
---|---|--- 
      
    |   | An independent non-executive director of Netcom holds 6,000
Unicom Shares and he has undertaken to Netcom that he will abstain from
voting at the Unicom EGM. As such interest is  _de minimis_ , such
independent non-executive director of Netcom is not considered to have
an interest in the Proposals. None of the members of the Netcom IBC has any
direct or indirect interest in the Proposals.  
      
    |   | The Netcom IBC has appointed Rothschild as the independent
financial adviser to the Netcom IBC in respect of the Proposals. The Netcom
IBC is evaluating the Proposals and the views and recommendations of the
Netcom IBC in respect of the Proposals will be set out in the Scheme Document
to be despatched to the Netcom Shareholders and holders of Netcom ADSs and
Netcom Options.  
   

  

     12.  |   | SCHEME DOCUMENT  
---|---|--- 
   

  

       |   | The Scheme Document containing, among other things,
details of the Proposals and the Scheme, the expected timetable, an
explanatory statement, the recommendations of the Netcom IBC in respect of
the Proposals, the letter of advice from the Netcom IFA to the Netcom IBC
and notices of the Court Meeting and the Netcom EGM and proxy forms will be
despatched to the Netcom Shareholders and holders of Netcom ADSs and Netcom
Options as soon as practicable and in compliance with the requirements of the
Takeovers Code.

     13.  |   | INFORMATION FOR HOLDERS OF NETCOM ADS  
---|---|--- 
   

  

       |   | As holders of Netcom ADSs are not holders of record of
Scheme Shares, they do not have the right to vote at the Court Meeting or the
Netcom EGM, but may instruct the Netcom Depositary to vote the Scheme Shares
underlying their Netcom ADSs in accordance with the terms of the Netcom ADS
Deposit Agreement. Holders of Netcom ADSs who wish to participate at the
Court Meeting or the Netcom EGM, or to participate at the hearing of the High
Court, would need to surrender their Netcom ADSs to the Netcom Depositary for
withdrawal of Scheme Shares underlying such Netcom ADSs in accordance with
the terms of the Netcom ADS Deposit Agreement prior to the relevant dates
that will be set forth in the Scheme Document. Netcom will make arrangements
with the Netcom Depositary to ensure that the Netcom Depositary will
provide holders of Netcom ADSs with the Scheme Document and other relevant
materials. Pursuant to the ADS Proposal, all holders of Netcom ADSs will
receive new Unicom ADSs rather than new Unicom Shares. As will be described
in detail in the Scheme Document, any holder of Netcom ADSs who would prefer
to receive new Unicom Shares rather than new Unicom ADSs, would need
to surrender their Netcom ADSs to the Netcom Depositary for withdrawal of
Scheme Shares underlying such Netcom ADSs in accordance with the terms of the
Netcom ADS Deposit Agreement such as to become holders of Scheme Shares not
later than the Scheme Record Time. Holders of Netcom ADSs seeking to become
holders of Scheme Shares are likely to incur cancellation fees and may incur
taxes and other charges in connection with the surrender and withdrawal
of Netcom ADSs. Holders of Netcom ADSs should refer to the Netcom ADS Deposit
Agreement for a complete description of their rights. Moreover, the Scheme
Document will contain important information for Netcom ADS holders.

     14.  |   | UNICOM EGM AND UNICOM CIRCULAR  
---|---|--- 
   

  

       |   | Unicom will convene an extraordinary general meeting to
approve the Proposals, the allotment and issue of the new Unicom Shares as
consideration under the Share Proposal and the ADS Proposal, the Very
Substantial Acquisition, the adoption of the Special Purpose Unicom
Share Option Scheme and all the transactions and matters contemplated or
required in connection with the Proposals.  
---|---|--- 
      
    |   | A circular containing, amongst others, further details of the
Proposals, the Very Substantial Acquisition and the Special Purpose Unicom
Share Option Scheme together with a notice of the Unicom EGM and proxy forms,
will be despatched to the Unicom Shareholders as soon as practicable and in
accordance with the requirements of the Listing Rules.

     15.  |   | FURTHER AGREEMENTS OR ARRANGEMENTS  
---|---|--- 
      
    |   | Unicom confirms that there are no other arrangements (whether
by way of option, indemnity or otherwise) in relation to the Unicom Shares or
the Netcom Shares and which might be material to the Proposals. Netcom
confirms that there are no other arrangements (whether by way of option,
indemnity or otherwise) in relation to the Unicom Shares or the Netcom Shares
and which might be material to the Proposals.  
      
    |   | Unicom confirms that there are no agreements or arrangements to
which it is a party which relate to the circumstances in which it may or may
not invoke or seek to invoke a pre-condition or a condition to the
Proposals.  
   

  

     16.  |   | DISPOSAL OF THE CDMA BUSINESS BY UNICOM  
---|---|--- 
   

  

       |   | On 2 June 2008, Unicom entered into a framework agreement
with CUCL, a wholly-owned subsidiary of Unicom, and China Telecom which sets
out the terms and conditions on which CUCL will dispose of its CDMA business
together with relevant assets and liabilities to China Telecom. Such disposal
will constitute a major transaction for Unicom and is subject to the approval
of the Unicom Shareholders. Details of the disposal and the relevant
transactions which are proposed to be entered into in connection with the
disposal are set out in a separate announcement issued by Unicom dated 2 June
2008\. Unicom expects that the disposal of the CDMA business by Unicom will
be completed before the Effective Date. The disposal of the CDMA business by
Unicom is a separate and independent transaction from the Proposals.

     17.  |   | RESUMPTION OF TRADING  
---|---|--- 
   

  

       |   | At the request of Unicom, trading in the Unicom Shares on
the Hong Kong Stock Exchange was suspended from 12:26 p.m. on 23 May 2008
(Hong Kong time) and trading in the Unicom ADSs on the New York Stock

An application has been made by Unicom to the Hong Kong Stock Exchange for
the resumption of trading in the Unicom Shares from 9:30 a.m. on 3 June 2008
(Hong Kong time). It is expected that trading in the Unicom ADSs on the New

been made by Netcom to the Hong Kong Stock Exchange for the resumption
of trading in the Netcom Shares from 9:30 a.m. on 3 June 2008 (Hong Kong

     18.  |   | IMPORTANT NOTE FOR US INVESTORS  
---|---|--- 
   

  

       |   | The Proposals relate to the securities of a corporation
incorporated under the laws of Hong Kong and will be subject to the procedure
and disclosure requirements of Hong Kong, which are different from those of
the United States. The financial information to be included in the Scheme
Document has not been, and will not be, prepared in accordance with US GAAP
and thus may not be comparable to financial information of US companies or
companies whose financial statements are prepared in accordance with US GAAP.
The Scheme is subject to disclosure and other procedural requirements, the
Scheme timetable, settlement procedures and timing of payments that are
different from those applicable under US domestic procedures and law.  
---|---|--- 
      
    |   | It may be difficult for US holders of Netcom Shares to enforce
their rights and any claim arising out of the US federal securities laws,
since Unicom is located outside of the United States, some or all of its
officers and directors are resident outside of the United States and a
substantial portion of its assets are located outside the United States. US
holders of Netcom Shares may not be able to sue a foreign company or its
officers or directors in a foreign court for violations of the US securities
laws. Further, it may be difficult to compel a foreign company and its
affiliates to subject themselves to a US courts judgment.  
      
    |   | All statements, other than statements of historical facts
included in this Announcement, are or may be forward-looking statements.
Forward-looking statements include, but are not limited to, those using words
such as "seek", "expect", "anticipate", "estimate", "believe", "intend",
"project", "plan", "strategy", "forecast" and similar expressions or future or
conditional verbs such as "will", "would", "should", "could", "may" and
"might". These statements reflect Unicoms or Netcoms (as the case may be)
current expectations, beliefs, hopes, intentions or strategies regarding the
future and assumptions in light of currently available information. Such
forward-looking statements are not guarantees of future performance or events
and involve known and unknown risks and uncertainties.  
      
    |   | Accordingly, actual results may differ materially from those
described in such forward-looking statements as a result of a number of
factors, including, without limitation, any changes in the regulatory regime
and significant policies for the PRC telecommunications industry, including
changes in the structure or functions of the primary industry regulator, the
Ministry of Industry and Information (which has assumed the regulatory
functions of the former Ministry of Information Industry), or any in the
regulatory policies of the Ministry of Industry and Information, the State-
owned Assets Supervision and Administration Commission and other relevant
government authorities of the PRC; any decisions by the PRC government in
relation to the technology standards and licenses of third generation
mobile telecommunication; the results of the ongoing restructuring of the PRC
telecommunications industry; any changes in the effects of competition on the
demand and price of the Unicoms and Netcoms telecommunications services;
the integration of Unicom and Netcom following the effectiveness of the
Scheme; any changes in telecommunications and related technologies
and applications based on such technologies; and any changes in political,

looking statements.

    |   | Holders of Unicom Shares, Unicom ADSs, Unicom Options, Netcom
Shares, Netcom ADSs and Netcom Options and potential investors in Unicom and
Netcom should be aware that the implementation of the Proposals (including
the Scheme) is subject to the conditions set out in this Announcement being
satisfied or waived, as applicable, and thus the Proposals (including
the Scheme) may or may not become effective. Holders of Unicom Shares, Unicom
ADSs, Unicom Options, Netcom Shares, Netcom ADSs and Netcom Options and
potential investors in Unicom and Netcom should therefore exercise caution
when dealing in Unicom Shares, Unicom ADSs, Unicom Options, Netcom Shares,

Persons who are in doubt as to the action they should take should consult
their stockbroker, bank manager, solicitor or other professional advisers.

In accordance with Rule 3.8 of the Takeovers Code, reproduced below is the
full text of Note 11 to Rule 22 of the Takeovers Code: 

  

 _"Stockbrokers, banks and others who deal in relevant securities on behalf of
clients have a general duty to ensure, so far as they are able, that those
clients are aware of the disclosure obligations attaching to associates and
other persons under Rule 22 and that those clients are willing to comply
with them. Principal traders and dealers who deal directly with
investors should, in appropriate cases, likewise draw attention to the
relevant Rules. However, this does not apply when the total value of
dealings (excluding stamp duty and commission) in any relevant security
undertaken for a client during any_ _ 7 day period is less than HK$1
million. This dispensation does not alter the obligation of principals,
associates and other persons themselves to initiate disclosure of their own
dealings, whatever total value is involved. Intermediaries are expected to
co-operate with the Executive in its dealings enquiries. Therefore, those who
deal in relevant securities should appreciate that stockbrokers and other
intermediaries will supply the Executive with relevant information as
to those dealings, including identities of clients, as part of that co-
operation."_
