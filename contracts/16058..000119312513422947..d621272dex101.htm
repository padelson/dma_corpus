iv AGREEMENT AND PLAN OF MERGER

 

THIS AGREEMENT AND PLAN OF MERGER (this " _Agreement_ "), dated as of October
8, 2013, is made by and among Six3 Systems Holdings II, Inc., a Delaware
corporation (the " _Company_ "), Six3 Systems Holdings, LLC, a Delaware
limited liability company, solely in its capacity as the representative of the
Equityholders (in such capacity, the " _Stockholder Representative_ "), CACI
International Inc, a Delaware corporation (the " _Parent_ "), CACI,
INC.-FEDERAL, a Delaware corporation and wholly owned subsidiary of Parent
(the " _Purchaser_ "), and CACI Acquisition II, Inc., a Delaware corporation
and wholly owned subsidiary of the Purchaser (the " _Merger Sub_ ").
Capitalized terms used and not otherwise defined herein have the meanings set
forth in _Article XII_ below.

 

WHEREAS, the Purchaser desires to acquire 100% of the issued and outstanding
capital stock of the Company in a reverse subsidiary merger pursuant to which
the Merger Sub will merge with and into the Company on the terms and subject
to the conditions set forth herein (the " _Merger_ "); and

 

WHEREAS, the respective boards of directors (or the equivalent governing
bodies) of the Purchaser, the Merger Sub and the Company have approved this
Agreement, the Merger and the related transactions contemplated hereby, upon
the terms and subject to the conditions set forth herein.

 

NOW, THEREFORE, in consideration of the mutual covenants contained herein and
other good and valuable consideration, the receipt and sufficiency of which
are hereby acknowledged, the parties hereto agree as follows:

ARTICLE I

 

THE MERGER

1.01 _The Merger_.

(a) Upon the terms and subject to the conditions set forth in this Agreement,
at the Effective Time, the Merger Sub shall merge with and into the Company
in accordance with the Delaware General Corporation Law (as amended, the "
_DGCL_ "), whereupon the separate existence of the Merger Sub shall cease and
the Company shall be the surviving corporation (the " _Surviving Corporation_
") and a wholly owned subsidiary of the Purchaser.

(b) At the Closing, the Company and the Merger Sub shall cause a certificate
of merger substantially in the form of _Exhibit A_ hereto (the " _Certificate
of Merger_ ") to be executed, acknowledged and filed with the Secretary of
State of the State of Delaware and shall make all other filings or recordings
required by DGCL in connection with the Merger. The Merger shall become
effective at such time (the " _Effective Time_ ") as the Certificate of Merger
is duly filed with the Secretary of State of the State of Delaware or at such
later time as the Purchaser and the Company mutually agree and specify in the
Certificate of Merger.

 



1 (c) From and after the Effective Time, the Surviving Corporation shall succeed
to all the assets, rights, privileges, powers and franchises and be subject
to all of the liabilities, restrictions, disabilities and duties of the
Company and the Merger Sub, all as provided under DGCL.

 

1.02 _Conversion of Shares_. At the Effective Time, by virtue of the Merger
and without any action on the part of any party:

 

(a) Each share of the Companys Senior Class F Common Stock, par value $0.01
per share (the " _Class F Stock_ "), issued and outstanding immediately prior
to the Effective Time shall be converted into the right to receive in cash at
the Closing, without interest, $122.0310790, which is the Class F Special
Liquidation Value (as defined in the Company Charter), which shall be payable
to the holder thereof in accordance with _Section 1.04_. The aggregate
consideration to which holders of the Class F Stock become entitled pursuant
to this _Section 1.02(a)_ is referred to herein as the " _Class F
Liquidation Amount_." For the avoidance of doubt, no holder of Class F Stock
shall be entitled to any Additional Merger Consideration as a result of
holding any Class F Stock prior to Closing.

 

(b) Each share of the Companys Class A Common Stock, par value $0.01 per
share (the " _Common Stock_ "), issued and outstanding immediately prior to
the Effective Time shall be converted into the right to receive (i) in cash at
Closing, without interest, an amount equal to the Per Share Portion multiplied
by the Closing Merger Consideration, which shall be payable to the holder
thereof in accordance with _Section 1.04_, and (ii) the Per Share Portion of
the Additional Merger Consideration, which shall be payable to the holder
thereof in accordance with  _Section 1.04_. The aggregate consideration to
which holders of Common Stock and Class F Stock become entitled to at Closing
pursuant to this _Section 1.02(b)_ and _Section 1.02(a)_ is collectively
referred to herein as the " _Closing Stock Merger Consideration_ " and,
together with any Additional Merger Consideration which becomes payable to
holders of Common Stock and Options, and with the Closing Option Merger
Consideration (as defined below), the " _Merger Consideration_." The Common
Stock, the Companys Senior Common Stock, par value, $0.01 per share (the "
_Senior Common Stock_ "), and the Class F Stock are sometimes referred to
herein collectively as the " _Company Stock_."

(c) Each share of Company Stock held immediately prior to the Effective Time
by the Company as treasury stock or by any Subsidiary of the Company or by
the Purchaser or the Merger Sub shall be canceled and no payment shall be made
with respect thereto. If required by the DGCL, but only to the extent required
thereby, each share of Company Stock issued and outstanding immediately prior
to the Effective Time that is a Dissenting Share shall be converted into the
right to receive payment from the Surviving Corporation with respect thereto
in accordance with the provisions of the DGCL (and notwithstanding anything
herein to the contrary, no payments with respect to such Dissenting Share
shall be made under this Agreement except in accordance with the provisions of
the DGCL).

 



2 (d) Each share of the Merger Subs common stock, par value $0.01 per
share, issued and outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time shall
be converted into and become one validly issued, fully paid and non-assessable
share of common stock, par value $0.01 per share, of the Surviving
Corporation.

 

1.03 _Merger Consideration_.

 

(a) At least two (2) but not more than five (5) Business Days prior to the
Closing Date, the Company shall prepare and deliver to the Purchaser its good
faith estimates of (i) Cash (the " _Estimated Cash_ "), (ii) Indebtedness (the
" _Estimated Indebtedness_ "), and (iii) Net Working Capital (the " _Estimated
Net Working Capital Amount_ "), together with a statement setting forth the
Transaction Expenses (the " _Transaction Expense Statement_ ") and a statement
listing the names of each employee of the Company and its Subsidiaries
who will be entitled to receive a bonus, change of control or similar payment
(other than a payment in respect of Options pursuant to this Agreement) from
the Company or its Subsidiaries upon the consummation of the transactions
contemplated hereby (the " _Closing Bonus Payments_ ") and setting forth
opposite to the names of such employees the Closing Bonus Payments to which
such employees are entitled (the " _Closing Bonus Payment Statement_ ").

 

(b) For purposes of this Agreement, the term " _Closing Merger Consideration_
" means (i) $820,000,000 (the " _Base Consideration_ "), _minus_ (ii) the
amount of the Estimated Indebtedness, _plus_ (iii) the amount, if any, by
which the Estimated Net Working Capital Amount exceeds the Target Net Working
Capital Amount,  _minus_ (iv) the amount, if any, by which the Target Net
Working Capital Amount exceeds the Estimated Net Working Capital Amount,
_plus_ (v) the amount of Estimated Cash, _minus_ (vi) the amount of the
Transaction Expenses, as set forth in the Transaction Expense Statement
_plus_ (vii) the aggregate exercise price of the Options (not including
Options which are terminated for no consideration hereunder), _minus_ (viii)
the Class F Liquidation Amount, _minus_ (ix) the Working Capital Escrow
Amount, _minus_ (x) the Indemnity Escrow Amount, _minus_ (xi) the
Representative Holdback Amount, _minus_ (xii) an amount equal to the Closing
Bonus Payments, as set forth on the Closing Bonus Payment Statement.

(c) For purposes of this Agreement, the term " _Final Merger Consideration_ "
means (i) the Base Consideration, _minus_ (ii) the amount of Indebtedness as
finally determined pursuant to _Article II_ , _plus_ (iii) the amount, if any,
by which the Final Net Working Capital Amount exceeds the Target Net Working
Capital Amount, _minus_ (iv) the amount, if any, by which the Target Net
Working Capital Amount exceeds the Final Net Working Capital Amount, _plus_
(v) the amount of Cash as finally determined pursuant to _Article II_ ,
_minus_ (vi) the amount of the Transaction Expenses, as set forth in the
Transaction Expense Statement, _plus_ (vii) the aggregate exercise price of
the Options (not including Options which are terminated for no consideration
hereunder), _minus_ (viii) the Class F Liquidation Amount, _minus_ (ix) the
Working Capital Escrow Amount, _minus_ (x) the Indemnity Escrow Amount,
_minus_ (xi) the Representative Holdback Amount, _minus_ (xii) an amount
equal to the Closing Bonus Payments, as set forth on the Closing Bonus Payment
Statement.

 



3 (d) For purposes of this Agreement, the term " _Per Share Portion_ " means a
fraction, the numerator of which is one, and the denominator of which is equal
to (i) the number of shares of Common Stock issued and outstanding immediately
prior to the Effective Time (other than Common Stock held by the Company
as treasury stock or held by the Purchaser or the Merger Sub), _plus_ (ii)
the number of shares of Common Stock issuable upon exercise of all Options
(not including Options which are terminated for no consideration hereunder).

 

(e) For purposes of this Agreement, the term " _Options_ " means all options
to acquire shares of Common Stock issued by the Company which are exercisable
(or will become exercisable as a result of the transactions contemplated
hereby (whether pursuant to the terms of such options or by action of the
Companys board of directors)) and outstanding as of immediately prior to the
Effective Time.

1.04 _Company Stock Exchange_. A bank or similar financial institution
mutually appointed by the Purchaser, the Company and the Stockholder
Representative (the " _Paying Agent_ ") will effect the exchange of cash for
shares of Company Stock which are entitled to payment pursuant to _Section
1.02_. Prior to the Closing Date, the Paying Agent, the Purchaser, the
Company and the Stockholder Representative shall enter into a Paying Agent
Agreement (the " _Paying Agent Agreement_ "), substantially in the form of
_Exhibit F_ attached hereto. In connection with such exchange, by no later
than ten Business Days prior to the Closing Date, the Paying Agent shall
provide the Stockholders with a Letter of Transmittal, substantially in the
form of _Exhibit B_ attached hereto (the " _Letter of Transmittal_ "). The
Paying Agent shall pay each holder of Company Stock (each, a " _Stockholder_
") who has surrendered his, her or its Company Stock pursuant to a duly
executed and completed Letter of Transmittal, the amount of cash to which
each such Stockholder is entitled at Closing under _Section 1.02_. Prior to
the Effective Time, the Purchaser shall transfer to the Paying Agent via wire
transfer of immediately available funds, cash in an amount equal to the
Closing Stock Merger Consideration. The Paying Agent shall hold such funds and
deliver them in accordance with the terms and conditions hereof and the terms
and conditions of the Paying Agent Agreement. Any Additional Merger
Consideration which is payable to such Stockholder in accordance with the
terms of this Agreement and/or the Escrow Agreement shall be paid by the
Purchaser, Escrow Agent or other applicable Person directly to such
Stockholder, rather than by the Paying Agent. Surrendered shares of Company
Stock shall forthwith be canceled. Until so surrendered and exchanged, each
such share of Company Stock shall from and after the Effective Time represent
solely the right to receive the portion of the Merger Consideration into
which it was converted pursuant to _Section 1.02_. Notwithstanding the
foregoing, if any certificate representing such share of Company Stock shall
have been lost, stolen or destroyed, then, upon the making of an affidavit of
such fact by the Person claiming such certificate to be lost, stolen or
destroyed, the Paying Agent shall (subject to such conditions as the Paying
Agent may reasonably impose) issue, in exchange for such lost, stolen or
destroyed certificate, the Merger Consideration to be paid in respect of the
shares of Company Stock represented by such certificate, as contemplated by
this _Article I_. The Paying Agent shall act as agent in effecting the
exchange of the applicable Merger Consideration in return for the Company
Stock. The Purchaser shall pay all fees and expenses of the Paying Agent.

 



4 1.05 _Options_.

 

(a) The Company shall cause all Options to be terminated or canceled as of the
Effective Time, at which time each holder of an Option (an " _Optionholder_
") shall be entitled to receive from the Purchaser, in exchange for such
termination or cancellation, (a) an amount in cash, at or promptly following
Closing, equal to the product of (i) the excess of the Per Share Portion of
the Closing Merger Consideration over the applicable exercise price per share
of Common Stock issuable under such Option multiplied by (ii) the number of
shares of Common Stock such holder could have purchased if such holder had
exercised such Option in full immediately prior to such time and (b) an amount
in cash equal to the product of (i) the Per Share Portion of the Additional
Merger Consideration multiplied by (ii) the number of shares of Common Stock
such holder could have purchased if such holder had exercised such Option in
full immediately prior to such time, in each case, less applicable withholding
Taxes. For any Options for which the exercise price of such Option is
greater than or equal to the Per Share Portion of the Closing Merger
Consideration allocable to such Option, such Option shall be terminated for no
consideration. The aggregate consideration to which Optionholders become
entitled pursuant at Closing to this  _Section 1.05(a)_ is collectively
referred to herein as the " _Closing Option Merger Consideration_." The
Purchaser shall pay or cause the Surviving Corporation to pay each
Optionholder the portion of the Closing Option Merger Consideration to which
such Optionholder is entitled under this _Section 1.05(a)_ (net of any
applicable withholding Taxes) through the Companys payroll system or by wire
transfer or check promptly after the Closing, and in any event within seven
days following the Closing.

(b) Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, any Additional Merger
Consideration which is payable to any Optionholder in accordance with the
terms of this Agreement and/or the Escrow Agreement (including any funds
released from the Representative Holdback Amount and the Escrow Account for
the benefit of the Optionholders) shall first be paid to the Stockholder
Representative, and the Stockholder Representative, after deducting applicable
Representative Expenses in accordance with _Section 13.01_, shall promptly
pay any such remaining Additional Merger Consideration to the Surviving
Corporation, and Purchaser shall cause the Surviving Corporation to pay (A)
each Employee Optionholder the portion of such Additional Merger Consideration
to which such Employee Optionholder is entitled (net of any applicable
withholding Taxes) through the Companys payroll system and (B) each
Optionholder who is not an Employee Optionholder the portion of such
Additional Merger Consideration to which such Optionholder is entitled by
wire transfer of immediately available funds to the account(s) as set forth on
the _Optionholder Schedule_ or by check to the address(es) set forth on the
_Optionholder Schedule_.

 

(c) After the Closing, the Purchaser shall cause the Surviving Corporation to
make timely payment to the appropriate taxing authority or authorities of any
amounts withheld from payment to the Employee Optionholders under this
_Section 1.05_.

 



5 1.06 _Organizational Documents of the Surviving Corporation_.

 

(a) At the Effective Time and without any further action on the part of the
Company or the Merger Sub, the certificate of incorporation of the Surviving

thereof and applicable Law.

Company or the Merger Sub, the by-laws of the Merger Sub, as in effect
immediately prior to the Effective Time (which shall include the
indemnification and exculpation provisions contained in the Companys bylaws
as of the date hereof), shall be the by-laws of the Surviving
Corporation (the " _Surviving Corporation By-Laws_ "), until thereafter
amended as provided therein or by law.

1.07 _Directors and Officers of the Surviving Corporation_.

1.08 _Stockholder Representative Holdback_. As contemplated by the calculation

amount, the " _Representative Holdback Amount_ ") shall be delivered to the
Stockholder Representative at the Closing, on behalf of the Equityholders, by
wire transfer of immediately available funds to a segregated account (the "
_Representative Account_ ") designated by the Stockholder Representative
(which account shall be used only to hold the Representative Holdback Amount
and to pay any fees, costs and expenses of the Stockholder Representative
payable out of the Representative Holdback Amount pursuant to the terms of
this Agreement). The portion of the Representative Holdback Amount delivered
to, and held by, the Stockholder Representative on behalf of each such
Equityholder shall be determined pro rata based upon each Equityholders
Residual Percentage. The Stockholder Representative is entitled to pay on
behalf of the Equityholders, and to the extent paid by the Stockholder
Representative from its own funds, obtain reimbursement for, any fees, costs
and expenses incurred by the Stockholder Representative in the performance of
its role hereunder (whether prior to or after the Closing) (" _Representative
Expenses_ ") from the Representative Holdback Amount, and the
Stockholder Representative shall not use any portion of the Representative
Holdback Amount for any other purpose.

the Surviving Corporation at the Closing, and the Purchaser shall cause the

promptly after the Closing and in any event within seven days following the
Closing. The Purchaser shall similarly promptly pay to applicable employees
any amounts it recovers under _Section 9.02(a)(iv)_ to the extent not already
paid.

 

ARTICLE II

MERGER CONSIDERATION ADJUSTMENT

2.01 _Final Closing Balance Sheet Calculation_. As promptly as possible, but
in any event within ninety (90) days after the Closing Date, the Purchaser
will deliver to the Stockholder Representative a consolidated balance sheet of
the Company and its Subsidiaries as of the open of business on the Closing
Date (the " _Closing Balance Sheet_ ") and a statement showing the
calculation of Cash, Indebtedness and Net Working Capital derived from the
Closing Balance Sheet (together with the Closing Balance Sheet, the "
_Preliminary Statement_ "). The Closing Balance Sheet shall be prepared and
Cash, Indebtedness and Net Working Capital shall be determined on a
consolidated basis in accordance with GAAP using the same accounting methods,
policies, principles, practices and procedures, with consistent
classifications, judgments and estimation methodology, as were used in the
preparation of the calculation of Net Working Capital as of June 30, 2013 set
forth on _Exhibit C_ and, to the extent not specified on  _Exhibit C_, in
the preparation of the Latest Balance Sheet and shall not include any changes
in assets or liabilities as a result of purchase accounting adjustments or
other changes arising from or resulting as a consequence of the transactions
contemplated hereby. The parties agree that the purpose of preparing the
Closing Balance Sheet and determining Cash, Indebtedness and Net Working
Capital and the related purchase price adjustment contemplated by this 
_Article II_ is to (i) measure the amount of Cash and Indebtedness and (ii)
measure changes in Net Working Capital against the Target Net Working Capital
Amount, and such processes are not intended to permit the introduction
of different judgments, accounting methods, policies, principles, practices,
procedures, classifications or estimation methodologies for the purpose of
preparing the Closing Balance Sheet or determining Cash, Indebtedness or Net
Working Capital. The Stockholder Representative and its accountants and other
representatives shall be permitted full access to review the Companys and its
Subsidiaries books and records and any work papers related to the preparation
of the Preliminary Statement and the adjustments contemplated thereby. The
Stockholder Representative and its accountants and other representatives may
make inquiries of the Purchaser, the Surviving Corporation and their
respective accountants regarding questions or disagreements, and the
Purchaser shall use its, and shall cause the Surviving Corporation and its
Subsidiaries to use their, commercially reasonable efforts to cause any such
accountants to cooperate with and respond to such inquiries. At the request
of the Stockholder Representative, the Surviving Corporation shall permit any
person who was employed by the Surviving Corporation or its Subsidiaries prior
to or at the Closing to advise and 

 



7  assist the Stockholder Representative in its review of the Preliminary
Statement and any objections or disputes with respect thereto. If the
Stockholder Representative has any objections to the Preliminary Statement,
the Stockholder Representative shall deliver to the Purchaser a statement
setting forth its objections thereto (an " _Objections Statement_ "). If an
Objections Statement is not delivered to the Purchaser within sixty (60) days
after delivery of the Preliminary Statement to the Stockholder Representative,
the Preliminary Statement shall be final, binding and non-appealable by the
parties hereto. The Stockholder Representative and the Purchaser shall
negotiate in good faith to resolve any such objections, but if they do not
reach a final resolution within thirty (30) days after the delivery of the
Objections Statement, the Stockholder Representative and the Purchaser shall
submit such dispute to the Valuation Firm. Any further submissions to the
Valuation Firm must be written and delivered to each party to the dispute. The
Valuation Firm shall make a final determination of Cash, Indebtedness and Net
Working Capital, and the resulting Final Merger Consideration calculated with
reference to such amounts to the extent such amounts are in dispute, in
accordance with the guidelines and procedures set forth in this Agreement
and on _Exhibit D_. The parties will cooperate with the Valuation Firm
during the term of its engagement. The determination of Cash, Indebtedness and
Net Working Capital, and the resulting Final Merger Consideration calculated
with reference thereto, shall become final and binding on the parties on the
date the Valuation Firm delivers its final resolution in writing to the
parties.

 

2.02 _Post-Closing Adjustment Payment_.

 

(a) Subject to Section _2.02(c)_ , if the Final Merger Consideration is
greater than the Closing Merger Consideration, the Purchaser shall promptly
(but in any event within five (5) Business Days) pay to the Equityholders on a
pro rata basis according to each Equityholders Residual Percentage the amount
of such excess, by wire transfer of immediately available funds to the
account or accounts designated in writing by the Stockholder Representative to
the Purchaser. If the Final Merger Consideration is less than the Closing
Merger Consideration, the Stockholder Representative and the Purchaser shall
promptly (but in any event within five (5) Business Days) jointly instruct the
Escrow Agent to pay on behalf of the Equityholders (on a pro rata basis
according to each Equityholders Residual Percentage) to the Purchaser (i)
_first_ from the Working Capital Escrow Amount and (ii) _second_ , to the
extent the funds available in the Working Capital Escrow Amount are
insufficient for such purpose, from the Indemnity Escrow Amount, the absolute
value of such difference by wire transfer of immediately available funds to
one or more accounts designated in writing by the Purchaser to the Stockholder
Representative. The Equityholders and the Stockholder Representative shall not
have any liability for any amounts due pursuant to this _Article II_, and
the Purchasers sole source of recourse and recovery for such amounts due
shall be the funds available in the Escrow Account, as set forth in the
immediately preceding sentence. 

(b) The Working Capital Escrow Amount may be distributed from the Escrow
Account solely and exclusively to the Purchaser and/or the Equityholders in
accordance with _Section 2.02(a)_ and shall not be available for any other
payment to Purchaser or any of its Affiliates. All title and all rights to the
Working Capital Escrow Amount shall automatically transfer to the
Equityholders (i) immediately after the payments made to Purchaser under
_Section 2.02(a)_, if the Final Merger Consideration is less than the

 



8  Closing Merger Consideration, or (ii) immediately upon the final
determination of the Final Merger Consideration, if the Final Merger
Consideration is greater than or equal to the Closing Merger Consideration,
in accordance with the terms of the Escrow Agreement.

(c) Pursuant to _Section 1.04_, any payments to the Stockholders under this
_Section 2.02_ shall be paid by the Escrow Agent and/or Purchaser, as
applicable, and any payments to the Optionholders under this _Section 2.02_
shall be paid by the Escrow Agent and/or Purchaser to the Stockholder
Representative, in accordance with _Section 1.05(b)_.

any costs claimed by the Company and its Subsidiaries in excess of $100,000 in
any annual incurred cost submission under any Government Contract, and to the
knowledge of the Company, there is no fact or occurrence that could be a
basis for disallowing any such costs in excess of such amount. Excluding any
changes in indirect rates resulting from the Merger or arising after the
Closing, the reserves established by the Company with respect to possible
adjustments to the indirect and direct costs incurred by the Company and its
Subsidiaries on any Government Contract are believed by the Company as of the
date hereof to be reasonable and materially sufficient to cover any potential
material adjustments resulting from audits of any such Government Contract.
The Company and its Subsidiaries are billing all indirect cost rates
materially consistent with the rates approved by DCAA or other cognizant
Governmental Entity or with provisional rate agreements, to the extent
applicable or required.

discussions or negotiations regarding, furnish any information with respect
to, assist or participate in, or facilitate in any other manner any effort or

required to be updated. Solely for purposes of _Section 4.01(a)_, no update
or revision to any part of the Disclosure Schedules pursuant to this _Section
7.07_ shall be deemed to cure any breach of any representation or warranty
that was untrue when made or subsequently has become untrue, unless the
Purchaser specifically agrees thereto in writing. For all other purposes
hereof (including Article IX), the delivery of any such updated Disclosure
Schedules will be deemed to have cured any misrepresentation or breach of
representation or warranty that otherwise might have existed hereunder if not
for such update, and the Purchaser Parties shall not have any claim (whether
for indemnification or otherwise) against the Escrow Amount, the Company, its
Subsidiaries or the Equityholder Parties for any such breach or
misrepresentation, in each case, except to the extent such representation or
warranty was untrue as of the date hereof as a result of circumstances
existing as of the date hereof or to the extent such representation or
warranty was known to be untrue by the Company as of the date hereof. Failure
to provide any such updated disclosure shall be deemed a breach of the
representation or warranty to which such variance relates hereunder and shall
in no event be deemed a breach of a covenant or agreement.

Company shall cause each of the agreements set forth on the _Terminated
Affiliated Transactions Schedule_ to be terminated in such a manner that
neither the Company nor any of its Subsidiaries shall have any further

(C) the Purchaser will not be required to provide to the Stockholder
Representative access to or copies of any records or files (including, but not
limited to, any personnel file of any employee of the Purchaser or any of its
Affiliates), the disclosure of which would reasonably be expected to subject
the Purchaser or any of its Affiliates to violation of applicable Law.

 

8.02 _Director and Officer Liability and Indemnification_.

 

(a) For a period of six (6) years after the Closing Date, the Purchaser shall
not, and shall not permit the Surviving Corporation or its Subsidiaries to
amend, repeal or otherwise modify any provision in the Surviving Corporations
or its Subsidiaries certificate of formation, certification of incorporation,
articles of incorporation, operating agreement, bylaws, or equivalent
governing documents relating to the exculpation or indemnification (including
fee advancement) of any officers and/or directors (unless required by Law), it
being the intent of the parties that the officers and directors of the
Company and its Subsidiaries shall continue to be entitled to such exculpation
and indemnification (including fee advancement) to the full extent of the Law.
Purchaser shall, and shall cause the Surviving Corporation and
its Subsidiaries to, honor and perform under all indemnification obligations
owed to any of the individuals who were officers and/or directors of the
Company or its Subsidiaries at or prior to the Closing Date.

 

(b) Prior to or at the Closing, the Purchaser shall, or shall cause the
Surviving Corporation (at the Purchasers expense) to, purchase a prepaid
insurance policy ( _i.e._ , "tail coverage") which policy provides liability
insurance coverage for the individuals who were officers and directors of the
Company and its Subsidiaries at or prior to the Closing Date on no less
favorable terms (including in amount and scope) as the policy or policies
maintained by the Company or its Subsidiaries immediately prior to the Closing
for the benefit of such individuals for an aggregate period of not less than

 



38  six (6) years with respect to claims arising from acts, events or omissions
that occurred at or prior to the Closing, including with respect to the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement; _provided_ , _however_ , that up
to a maximum amount of $250,000 (the " _Premium Cap_ ") (and solely to the
extent agreed to by the Stockholder Representative in writing in its sole
discretion, the Premium Cap may be increased), the premium for such "tail
coverage" insurance policy shall be treated as a Transaction Expense. Such
policy shall be from an insurance carrier with the same or better credit
rating as the Companys or its Subsidiaries current insurance carrier with
respect to directors and officers liability insurance.

(c) If the Surviving Corporation, its Subsidiaries or any of their respective
successors or assigns (i) is to consolidate with or merges into any other
Person and will not be the continuing or the Surviving Corporation or entity
of such consolidation or merger or (ii) is to transfer all or substantially
all of its properties and assets to any Person, then, and in each such case,
proper provisions shall be made so that the successors and assigns of the
Surviving Corporation and its Subsidiaries shall assume all of the
obligations set forth in this _Section 8.02_. The provisions of this _Section
8.02_ are intended for the benefit of, and will be enforceable by, each
current and former officer, director or similar functionary of the Company or
its Subsidiaries and his or her heirs and representatives, and are in addition
to, and not in substitution for, any other rights to indemnification or
contribution that any such person may have had by contract or otherwise.

(d) Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, if any claim, action,
suit, proceeding or investigation (whether arising before, at or after the
Closing Date) is made against any individuals who were officers and directors
of the Company and its Subsidiaries at or prior to the Closing Date or any
other party covered by directors and officers liability insurance, on or
prior to the sixth anniversary of the Closing Date, the provisions of this
_Section 8.02_ shall continue in effect until the final disposition of such
claim, action, suit, proceeding or investigation.

8.03 _Employment and Benefit Arrangements_. For at least twelve (12) months
following the Closing Date, the Purchaser shall cause the Surviving
Corporation to provide employees of the Surviving Corporation and its
Subsidiaries with compensation that is equivalent to the compensation provided
to such employees prior to the Closing and to either (i) maintain in effect
on behalf of employees of the Company and its Subsidiaries all employment,
severance, termination, consulting, retirement and other compensation and
benefit plans, programs, arrangements, agreements and policies (other than
any equity-based plans) of the Company or its Subsidiaries as in effect as of
the date hereof (the " _Company Plans_ ") or (ii) provide all employees of the
Company and its Subsidiaries with such compensation and benefit plans,
programs, arrangements, agreements and policies as are provided to similarly
situated employees of the Purchaser; _provided_ that such benefit plans,
programs, arrangements, agreements and policies provide a level of benefits
that in the aggregate is substantially equivalent to the aggregate level of
benefits provided under the Company Plans as of the Closing. The Purchaser
shall take all actions necessary so that employees of the Company and its
Subsidiaries shall receive service credit for all purposes (other than for
purposes of benefit accrual under a defined benefit pension plan) under any
compensation or benefit plans,

 



39  programs, arrangements, agreements and policies sponsored by the Purchaser
or any of its Affiliates, except to the extent duplication of benefits would
result. To the extent that the Purchaser modifies any welfare benefit
coverage or plan under which the employees of the Company and its Subsidiaries
participate, the Purchaser shall waive any applicable waiting periods, pre-
existing conditions or actively-at-work requirements and shall give such
employees credit under the new coverages or benefit plans for
deductibles, co-insurance and out-of-pocket payments that have been paid
during the year in which such welfare benefit coverage or plan modification
occurs. The Purchaser shall be solely responsible for any obligations arising
under Section 4980B of the Code with respect to all "MandA qualified
beneficiaries" as defined in Treasury Regulation §54.4980B-9. Nothing in this
_Section 8.03_ shall give any third party other than the parties to this
Agreement, including any employees of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries,
any right to enforce the provisions of this _Section 8.03_ as a third-party
beneficiary. To the extent that the loss of an officer position as
contemplated by _Section 1.07(b)_ or _Section 4.01(f)(vi)_ would constitute
grounds to resign with "good reason" under any Senior Management Agreement
(as defined on the _Affiliated Transaction Schedule_ ), any rights or
obligations to any employee party to any such Senior Management Agreement
(including any severance payments) which arise under any such Senior
Management Agreement as a result shall not be deemed a liability of the
Company or its Subsidiaries for purposes of Net Working Capital and shall be
the sole responsibility of the Purchaser.

 

8.04 _Regulatory Filings_. The Purchaser shall, within five (5) Business Days
after the date hereof, make or cause to be made all filings and submissions
required of the Purchaser under the HSR Act or any other applicable antitrust
or noncompetition Laws or regulations (" _Antitrust Laws_ ") or other Laws
applicable to the Purchaser for the consummation of the transactions
contemplated herein. The Purchaser shall promptly comply with any additional
requests for information, including requests for production of documents and
production of witnesses for interviews or depositions by any
Governmental Entities. In addition, the Purchaser shall cooperate in good
faith with the Governmental Entities and undertake promptly any and all action
required (including divestitures of its assets) to complete the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement expeditiously and lawfully. Without limiting
the generality of the foregoing, if a suit or other action is threatened or
instituted by any Governmental Entity or any other entity challenging the
validity or legality or seeking to restrain the consummation of the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement, the Purchaser shall use its best
efforts to avoid, resist, resolve or, if necessary, defend such suit or
action. In addition, Purchaser shall (1) give the Company prompt notice
of the commencement or threat of commencement of any suit, claim, action,
investigation or proceeding by or before any Governmental Entity with respect
to the transactions contemplated herein, (2) keep the Company informed as to
the status of any such suit, claim, action, investigation, proceeding or
threat, and (3) promptly inform the Company of any material communication
concerning the HSR Act or other Antitrust Laws to or from any Governmental
Entity regarding the transactions contemplated herein. Except as may be
prohibited by any Governmental Entity, the Purchaser will consult and
cooperate with the Company, and will consider in good faith the views of the
Company, in connection with any analysis, appearance, presentation,
memorandum, brief, argument, opinion or proposal made or submitted in
connection with any suit, claim, action, investigation or proceeding under or
relating to the HSR Act or any other Antitrust Law. The Purchaser will
permit authorized representatives of the Company to be present at each
meeting or conference relating to any such legal proceeding and to have access
to and be consulted in connection with any document,

 



40  opinion or proposal made or submitted to any Governmental Entity in
connection with any such legal proceeding. The Purchaser shall diligently
assist and cooperate with the Company in preparing and filing all documents
required to be submitted by the Company or its Affiliates to any Governmental
Entities in connection with the transactions contemplated hereby and in
obtaining any Governmental Entity, Governmental Customer or third
party consents, waivers, authorizations or approvals which may be required to
be obtained by the Company or its Affiliates in connection with the
transactions contemplated hereby (which assistance and cooperation shall
include timely furnishing to the Company all information concerning the
Purchaser and/or its Affiliates that counsel to the Company reasonably
determine is required to be included in such documents or would be helpful in
obtaining such required consent, waiver, authorization or approval). The
Purchaser shall be responsible for all filing fees under the HSR Act, other
Antitrust Laws and all other Laws or regulations applicable to the Purchaser.
The Purchaser shall cause the filings under the HSR Act to be considered
for grant of "early termination."

8.05 _Conditions_. The Purchaser and the Merger Sub shall use all commercially
reasonable efforts to cause the conditions set forth in _Section 4.02_ to be
satisfied as soon as practicable following the date hereof, to cause the
Closing to occur as expeditiously as possible following the execution of this
Agreement and to consummate the transactions contemplated herein as soon as
reasonably possible after the satisfaction of the conditions set forth in
_Article IV_ (other than those to be satisfied at the Closing itself).

 

8.06 _Contact with Employees, Customers and Suppliers_. Prior to the Closing,
the Purchaser and the Purchaser Parties may only contact and communicate with
the employees, customers, service providers, regulators and suppliers of the
Company and its Subsidiaries related to the transactions contemplated hereby
after prior consultation with and written approval of the Companys chief
executive officer or chief financial officer.

ARTICLE IX

 

INDEMNIFICATION

pursuant to this Agreement or in any certificate delivered pursuant to this
Agreement and the indemnities set forth in Section 11.03(a) and Sections
9.02(a)(iii) through 9.02(a)(vi), inclusive, (other than for the Extended
Indemnity Item), shall survive the execution and delivery of this Agreement
and the Closing for a period beginning on the Closing Date and ending on the
date that is fifteen (15) months after the Closing Date (the "Expiration
Date"), at which point they shall terminate. No claim for indemnification
hereunder for breaches of representations and warranties contained in or made
pursuant to this Agreement or in any certificate delivered pursuant to this
Agreement or for indemnification pursuant to Section 11.03(a) or Sections
9.02(a)(iii) through 9.02(a)(vi), inclusive (other than for the Extended
Indemnity Item) may be made after the Expiration Date. The indemnity for the
Extended Indemnity Item set forth in Section 9.02(a)(vi) only shall survive
the execution and delivery of this Agreement and the Closing for a period
beginning on the Closing Date and ending on the date that is thirty-six (36)
months after the Closing Date (the "Extended Expiration Date"), at which point
it shall terminate. No claim for indemnification pursuant to Section
9.02(a)(vi) for the Extended Indemnity Item may be made after the Extended 

 



41  Expiration Date. All covenants and agreements contained herein shall survive
the Closing for the applicable statute of limitations or for any shorter
period expressly specified in accordance with their terms; provided that no
claim may be brought hereunder in respect of any covenant or agreement to the
extent contemplating performance entirely before or at the Closing unless such
claim is brought prior to the date that is fifteen (15) months after the
Closing Date. Notwithstanding the preceding sentences, if notice of an
indemnification claim made in accordance with this Agreement shall have been
delivered before the aforementioned time period has elapsed with respect to
any breach of any such representation, warranty, covenant or agreement, such
representation, warranty, covenant or agreement shall survive with respect to
such claim until such claim is finally resolved.

 

9.02 _Indemnification for the Benefit of the Purchaser Parties_.

 

(a) From and after the Closing (but subject to the provisions of this _Article
IX_ and the Escrow Agreement) the Purchaser, on behalf of the Purchaser
Parties, shall be entitled to assert, as the Purchaser Parties sole and
exclusive remedy for any action relating (directly or indirectly) to this
Agreement and the transactions contemplated hereby, other than with respect
to claims for fraud in connection with the transactions occurring under this
Agreement (" _Transaction Fraud_ ") (in which case a claim for fraud may only
be asserted against the Person(s) that committed such fraud), and only in
accordance with the terms of this _Article IX_ and the Escrow Agreement,
claims against the Indemnity Escrow Amount then remaining and available in the
Escrow Account in respect of any Losses that the Purchaser Parties suffered
or incurred to the extent arising or resulting from:

(i) any breach of any representation or warranty by the Company set forth in
_Article V_ or the certificate delivered pursuant to _Section 4.01(f)(i)_
with respect to such a breach of a representation or warranty (it being
understood and agreed that the existence of any such breach of
any representation or warranty referred to in this clause (i) and any
resulting Losses under such representations and warranties (other than the
Company Fundamental Representations, _Section 5.05_, the first sentence of 
_Section 5.06_ and in any instances in which materiality and Material Adverse
Effect qualify the agreements or Plans to be set forth on a Schedule (for
example, under _Section 5.09(a)(xi)_) shall be determined without regard
to any qualification or exception contained therein relating to materiality
or Material Adverse Effect);

(ii) any nonfulfillment or breach of any covenant or agreement set forth
herein or the Escrow Agreement by the Company or the Stockholder
Representative (excluding in all cases any nonfulfillment or breach of the
Company or its Subsidiaries that occurs after the Closing);

(iii) any claim against the Company related to the transactions contemplated
hereby by any current or former holder of Options (but only to the extent
that such claim specifically arises out of or relates to such Persons Options
and status as a current or former holder of Options, and excluding claims for
payment of amounts that the Surviving Corporation or the Purchaser are
required

 



42  to pay under this Agreement); _provided_ , however, the Purchaser Parties
shall not be entitled to indemnification pursuant to this clause (iii) to the
extent that such claim arises under _Section 9.03_ or to the extent Losses
from such claim were taken into account in determining the Final Merger
Consideration;

 

(iv) any claim against the Company by an employee, officer or director of the
Company for a bonus, change of control or similar payment promised by the
Company that was triggered by the Closing of the transactions contemplated
hereby, excluding any such claim resulting from a failure by the Surviving
Corporation to make the Closing Bonus Payments contemplated by  _Section
1.09_, or to the extent Losses from such claim were taken into account in
determining the Final Merger Consideration;

 

(v) any Indebtedness of the Company or its Subsidiaries or any Transaction
Expenses, in each case, to the extent not taken into account in determining
the Final Merger Consideration; or

(vi) the items set forth on the _Specific Indemnity Schedule_.

Notwithstanding the foregoing, other than with respect to claims for
Transaction Fraud (in which case a claim for fraud may only be asserted
against the Person(s) that committed such fraud), no claims by the Purchaser
Parties arising from indemnification claims pursuant to _Section 9.02(a)(i)_
shall be asserted unless and until the aggregate amount of Losses that would
otherwise be payable hereunder with respect to indemnification claims made
pursuant to _Section 9.02(a)(i)_ exceeds, on a cumulative basis, an amount
equal to $4,000,000 (the " _Deductible_ "), and then only to the extent such
Losses exceed the Deductible; _provided_ , that, the Deductible shall not
apply to the following claims, and the following claims shall not count toward
the Deductible: any claims by the Purchaser on behalf of the
Purchaser Parties to the extent based upon or arising or resulting from any
breach of any of the Company Fundamental Representations or any representation
or warranty set forth in _Section 5.08_ (Tax Matters). In addition, other
than with respect to claims for Transaction Fraud (in which case a claim for
fraud may only be asserted against the Person(s) that committed such fraud),
no claim for indemnification made pursuant to _Section 9.02(a)(i)_ or
_Sections 9.02(a)(iii)_ through  _9.02(a)(v)_ with respect to a single course
of conduct or related set of circumstances, occurrences or events shall be so
asserted unless and until the aggregate amount of Losses that would be payable
pursuant to such claim exceeds an amount equal to $50,000 (the " _Mini-
Basket_ ") (it being understood that any such claim for an amount less than
the Mini-Basket shall be disregarded in determining whether the Deductible has
been exceeded and thereafter); _provided_  that the Mini-Basket shall not
apply to any claims by the Purchaser on behalf of the Purchaser Parties to the
extent based upon or arising or resulting from any breach of any of the
Company Fundamental Representations or any representation or warranty set
forth in _Section 5.08_ (Tax Matters). Notwithstanding the foregoing, other
than with respect to claims for Transaction Fraud (in which case a claim for
fraud may only be asserted against the Person(s) that committed such fraud),
no claims by the Purchaser Parties arising from indemnification claims made
arising out of the Special Tax Matter (including any claims arising under any
subsection of _Section_ _11.03(a)_  

 



43  or _Section 5.08_ or any other section of this Agreement, in each case to
the extent arising out of the Special Tax Matter) shall be asserted unless and
until the aggregate amount of Losses that would otherwise be payable
hereunder with respect to such indemnification claims exceeds, on a cumulative
basis, an amount equal to $1,400,000, and then only to the extent such Losses
exceed such amount. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Purchaser Parties
shall only be entitled to recover 80% of any Losses suffered by the Purchaser
Parties that would otherwise be indemnified under _Section 9.02(a)(vi)_ for
the Extended Indemnity Item, such that the Purchaser Parties shall bear 20%
of any such Losses. Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, (i) the
Deductible shall not apply to any claim for indemnification under Sections
_9.02(a)(ii)_ through _(vi)_ and _11.03(a)_ , (ii) the Mini-Basket shall not
apply to any claim for indemnification under _Section 9.02(a)(ii)_ or
_Section 9.02(a)(vi)_, and (iii) the Purchaser Parties shall only be entitled
to receive indemnification payments pursuant to this _Section 9.02_ with
respect to Losses that have actually been suffered or incurred by the
Purchaser Parties.

 

(b) From and after the Closing, except (i) in the case of Transaction Fraud
(in which case a claim for fraud may only be asserted against the Person(s)
that committed such fraud) and (ii) the right to specific performance or other
equitable relief in accordance with the terms of this Agreement, the Purchaser
Parties sole and exclusive remedies for any and all Losses or other claims
relating to or arising from this Agreement or in connection with the
transactions contemplated hereby, including in any Schedule or certificate
delivered hereunder, shall be limited to recovery against the Indemnity
Escrow Amount then remaining and available in the Escrow Account pursuant to
this _Section 9.02_ and the Escrow Agreement as their sole recourse. The
Purchaser, on behalf of itself and the other Purchaser Parties, agrees that
other than in the case of Transaction Fraud (in which case a claim for fraud
may only be asserted against the Person(s) that committed such fraud) or
indirectly through the payment of all or a portion of the Indemnity Escrow
Amount to the Purchaser Parties if and as required by the terms of this
Agreement and the Escrow Agreement, under no circumstances will the
Stockholder Representative, the Equityholders or any of their Affiliates, or
their respective officers, directors, partners, members, employees, agents,
representatives, successors and permitted assigns (collectively, the "
_Equityholder Parties_ ")) have any liability to Parent, the Purchaser or any
of their Affiliates (including the Surviving Corporation and the Companys
Subsidiaries after the Closing), or their respective officers, directors,
partners, members, employees, agents, representatives, successors and
permitted assigns (collectively, the " _Purchaser Parties_ ") relating to or
arising from this Agreement or in connection with the transactions
contemplated hereby, including in any Exhibit, Schedule or certificate
delivered hereunder.

 

(c) None of the Purchaser or the other Purchaser Parties may avoid the
limitations on liability set forth in this _Article IX_ by seeking damages
for breach of contract, tort or pursuant to any other theory of liability and,
except in the case of Transaction Fraud (in which case a claim for fraud may
only be asserted against the Person(s) that committed such fraud), the
Purchaser, for itself and the other Purchaser Parties, hereby waives, from and
after the Closing, to the fullest extent permitted under applicable Law, any
and all rights, claims and causes of action it may have against the 

 



44  Equityholder Parties relating (directly or indirectly) to the subject matter
of this Agreement arising under or based upon any Law or otherwise.
Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this Agreement, the
Purchaser shall have no right to indemnification hereunder with respect to any
Loss or alleged Loss to the extent such Loss or alleged Loss is included in
the determination of the Final Merger Consideration and in such case, solely
to the extent of such inclusion therein.

(d) Except for the Purchaser pursuant to _Sections 3.02(e)_ and  _3.02(f)_ ,
no Person (including any Equityholder Party) shall have any obligation to fund
the Escrow Account. All payments made from the Escrow Account shall be treated
by the parties as an adjustment to the proceeds received by the Equityholders
pursuant to _Article I_ hereof.

(e) Within five (5) Business Days after the date that is fifteen (15) months
after the Closing Date, the Stockholder Representative and the Purchaser
shall, in accordance with the Escrow Agreement, jointly instruct the Escrow
Agent to pay the Equityholders (on a pro rata basis according to
each Equityholders Residual Percentage) an amount from the Escrow Account,
if any, equal to (i) the balance of the Indemnity Escrow Amount then remaining
in the Escrow Account, _minus_ (ii) $5,000,000, _minus_ (iii) any amounts of
such balance which may be used to satisfy indemnification claims outstanding
on the date that is fifteen (15) months after the Closing Date (which amounts
in this clause (iii) shall remain in the Escrow Account until such matters
are finally resolved and shall then be released).

(f) Within five (5) Business Days after the date that is thirty-six (36)
months after the Closing Date, the Stockholder Representative and the
Purchaser shall, in accordance with the Escrow Agreement, jointly instruct the
Escrow Agent to pay the Equityholders (on a pro rata basis according to
each Equityholders Residual Percentage) an amount from the Escrow Account,
if any, equal to the balance of the Indemnity Escrow Amount then remaining in
the Escrow Account, _minus_ any amounts of such balance which may be used to
satisfy indemnification claims outstanding on the date that is thirty-six
(36) months after the Closing Date (which amounts shall remain in the Escrow
Account until such matters are finally resolved).

 

(g) Any payments to the Optionholders under _Section 9.02(e)_ shall be paid
in accordance with  _Section 1.05(b)_.

(h) The Purchaser Parties shall not be entitled to recover damages or obtain
payment, reimbursement, restitution or indemnity more than once in respect of
any one Loss or related group of Losses.

9.03 _Indemnification for the Benefit of the Equityholder Parties_. From and
after the Closing (but subject to the provisions of this Article IX), the
Stockholder Representative, on behalf of the Equityholder Parties, shall be
entitled to assert, as the Equityholder Parties sole and exclusive remedy
for any action relating (directly or indirectly) to this Agreement and the
transactions contemplated hereby, other than with respect to claims for
Transaction Fraud (in which case a claim for fraud may only be asserted
against the Person(s) that committed such fraud) or the right to specific
performance or other equitable relief in accordance with the terms

 



45  of this Agreement, and only in accordance with the terms of this Article IX,
claims in respect of any Losses that the Equityholder Parties suffered or
incurred to the extent arising or resulting from:

(a) any breach of any representation or warranty by Parent, the Purchaser or
the Merger Sub set forth in _Article VI_ or the certificate delivered
pursuant to _4.02(e)(i)_ with respect to such a breach of a representation or
warranty (it being understood and agreed that the existence of any such breach
of any representation or warranty referred to in this clause (a) and any
resulting Losses under such representations and warranties (other than the
Purchaser Fundamental Representations) shall be determined without regard to
any qualification or exception contained therein relating to materiality or
Material Adverse Effect);

(b) any nonfulfillment or breach of any covenant or agreement set forth herein
or in the Escrow Agreement by Parent, the Company, Surviving Corporation,
Purchaser or the Merger Sub (excluding in all cases any nonfulfillment or
breach of the Company or its Subsidiaries that occurs prior to the Closing);
or

 

(c) any claim or suit brought against any of the Equityholder Parties at any
time on or after the Closing Date relating to actions taken by the Purchaser,
the Surviving Corporation or their respective Subsidiaries on or after the
Closing Date other than any claim or action by the Purchaser pursuant to
_Section 9.02_.

 

If any Equityholder Party is entitled (pursuant only to an executed settlement
agreement between the Purchaser and the Stockholder Representative or
a judgment or decree entered by a court of competent jurisdiction in favor of
any Equityholder Party (a " _Final Determination_ ")) to payment of any amount
under this _Section 9.03_, such payment shall be delivered to the applicable
Equityholder Party by wire transfer of immediately available funds to the
account designated by the Stockholder Representative within fifteen (15) days
after the Final Determination thereof, and in accordance with  _Section
1.05(b)_ with respect to the Optionholders. Notwithstanding the foregoing,
other than with respect to claims for Transaction Fraud (in which case a claim
for fraud may only be asserted against the Person(s) that committed
such fraud), no claims by the Stockholder Representative on behalf of the
Equityholder Parties arising from indemnification claims made pursuant to
_Section 9.03(a)_ shall be asserted unless and until the aggregate amount of
Losses that would otherwise be payable hereunder by the Purchaser in respect
of its indemnification obligations under _Section 9.03(a)_ exceeds, on a
cumulative basis, an amount equal to the Deductible, and then only to the
extent such Losses exceed the Deductible; _provided_ , that the Deductible
shall not apply to the following claims, and the following claims shall not
count toward the Deductible: any claims by the Stockholder Representative on
behalf of the Equityholder Parties to the extent based upon or arising or
resulting from any breach of any of the Purchaser Fundamental Representations.
In addition, other than with respect to claims for Transaction Fraud (in which
case a claim for fraud may only be asserted against the Person(s) that
committed such fraud), (i) no claim for indemnification made pursuant to
_Section 9.03(a)_ with respect to a single course of conduct or related set
of circumstances, occurrences or events shall be so asserted unless and until
the aggregate amount of Losses that would be payable pursuant to such claim
exceeds an amount equal to the Mini-Basket (it being understood that any such
claim for an amount less than the Mini-Basket shall be disregarded in
determining whether

 



46  the Deductible has been exceeded and thereafter); _provided_ that the Mini-
Basket shall not apply to any claims by the Stockholder Representative on
behalf of the Equityholder Parties to the extent based upon or arising or
resulting from any breach of any of the Purchaser Fundamental Representations;
and (ii) the aggregate amount of all payments received by the Equityholder
Parties in satisfaction of claims for indemnification pursuant to this
_Section 9.03_ shall not exceed $35,000,000. For the avoidance of doubt, the
Equityholder Parties shall only be entitled to receive indemnification
payments pursuant to this _Section 9.03_ with respect to Losses that have
actually been suffered or incurred by the Equityholder Parties.

9.04 _Procedures_.

 

(a) Any Person making a claim for indemnification under this _Article IX_ or
under _Section 11.03(a)_ (an " _Indemnitee_ " it being understood and agreed
that only the Stockholder Representative shall have the right to make a claim
for indemnification under this _Article IX_ on behalf of the Equityholder
Parties (except for claims under _Section 8.02_ or _Section 13.19_) and
only the Purchaser shall have the right to make a claim for indemnification
under this _Article IX_ or _Section 11.03(a)_ on behalf of the Purchaser
Parties) shall notify the Purchaser (in the case of a claim by the
Stockholder Representative on behalf of the Equityholder Parties) or the
Stockholder Representative (in the case of a claim by the Purchaser on behalf
of the Purchaser Parties) (in such context, the Purchaser or the Stockholder
Representative being referred to herein as an " _Indemnitor_ ") of the claim
in writing promptly after receiving written notice of any pending or
threatened action, lawsuit, proceeding, investigation or other claim against
it (if by a third party) or discovering the liability, obligation, or facts
giving rise to such claim for indemnification, describing in reasonable detail
the claim, the amount thereof (if known and quantifiable) and the basis
thereof (it being understood that such Indemnitee may assert a claim for
indemnification hereunder by sending written notice to the Indemnitor pursuant
to the terms of this Agreement, and shall not be required to file an actual
claim for indemnification with a Governmental Entity in order to properly
deliver a notice of a claim hereunder); _provided_ that (i) subject to
_Section 9.01_, the failure to so notify the Indemnitor shall not relieve the
Indemnitor of its obligations hereunder except to the extent, and only to the
extent, the Indemnitor shall have been prejudiced as a result of such failure,
and (ii) references to payment obligations or similar references of the
Indemnitor when the Indemnitor is the Stockholder Representative shall only
be satisfied out of the Indemnity Escrow Amount then remaining and available
in the Escrow Account pursuant to _Section 9.02_ and the Escrow Agreement. In
that regard, if any action, lawsuit, proceeding, investigation, or other
claim shall be brought or asserted by any third party which, if adversely
determined, would entitle the Indemnitee to indemnity pursuant to this
_Article IX_ or under _Section 11.03(a)_, the Indemnitee shall promptly
notify the Indemnitor of the same in writing, specifying in detail the basis
of such claim and the facts pertaining thereto, but, subject to _Section
9.01_, failure to provide such notification shall not affect the rights of
the Indemnitee hereunder except to the extent set forth in clause (i) to the
proviso to the preceding sentence. Any Indemnitor shall be entitled to
participate in the defense of such action, lawsuit, proceeding, investigation
or other claim giving rise to an Indemnitees claim for indemnification at
such Indemnitors expense, and at its option shall be entitled to assume the
defense thereof with reputable counsel reasonably acceptable to
the Indemnitee; _provided_ that any

 



47  Indemnitor shall continue to be entitled to assert any limitation on any
claims contained herein; and _provided_ _further_ that, except with respect to
claims under or that relate to the subject matter of the indemnities set
forth in _Sections 9.02(a)(iii)_ through _9.02(a)(vi)_ (which the Stockholder
Representative shall have the right to control both the prosecution and
defense of, notwithstanding anything to the contrary set forth herein) the
Indemnitor shall not have the right to assume control of such defense and
shall pay the fees and expenses of reputable counsel retained by the
Indemnitee and reasonably acceptable to the Indemnitor, if the claim
which the Indemnitor seeks to control (t) seeks equitable or injunctive
relief, except where equitable or injunctive relief is incidental to a primary
claim or claims for monetary damages, (u) involves primarily criminal
allegations, (v) would reasonably be expected to result in greater liability
to the Indemnitee than the Indemnitor, taking into account the amounts
remaining in the Escrow Account (but not the Deductible and other limitations
on indemnification herein); (w) is one in which the Indemnitor is also a
party and, based on the advice of counsel, joint representation would be
inappropriate or there may be legal defenses available to the Indemnitee that
are different from or additional to those available to the Indemnitor, or (x)
involves a claim which, upon petition by the Indemnitee, the appropriate court
rules that the Indemnitor failed or is failing to vigorously prosecute or
defend (each of clauses (t) through (x), a " _Litigation Condition_ ").
Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement, if an Indemnitee
is otherwise permitted to make a claim for indemnification under _Article IX_
or _Section 11.03(a)_, it shall not be prohibited from making such claim
solely because it has not yet actually suffered or incurred a Loss in respect
of such potential claim. However, prior to bringing any such claim, in
addition to and not in limitation of the other provisions of _Article IX_ and
_Section 11.03_, (i) such Indemnitee must have determined in good faith that
it anticipates that such indemnifiable Loss may be suffered and (ii) in the
case of claims involving potential liabilities to third parties, there must
be a significant precipitating event from such third party (or from the
Purchaser or, after the Closing, by the Surviving Corporation or any of the
Companys Subsidiaries, as contemplated by Section 9.04(b)) of its own
initiative that gives rise to a threat of such Loss (such a precipitating
event would be in the nature of a lawsuit being filed against the Indemnitee,
a business dispute arising or, in the case of claims involving liabilities to
Governmental Authorities, a mandatory or voluntary disclosure by the Purchaser
or after the Closing by the Surviving Corporation or any of the Companys
Subsidiaries as contemplated by Section 9.04(b) or the
applicable Governmental Authority requiring that the Company or its
Subsidiaries make a payment in respect of such matter). Notwithstanding the
foregoing, the Purchaser shall comply with item 1(ii) of the _Specific
Indemnity Schedule_.

 

(b) For the purposes of this _Section 9.04_, any mandatory or voluntary
disclosure made in good faith by the Purchaser, or after the Closing by the
Surviving Corporation or any of the Companys Subsidiaries, to any
Governmental Entity of any matter (other than in respect of the Extended
Indemnity Item) that may result or has resulted in Losses being suffered or
incurred by the Purchasing Parties or any of them for which they or any of
them would be entitled to indemnity pursuant to _Sections 9.02_ or _11.03(a)_
shall be deemed to be an "action, lawsuit, proceeding, investigation or other
claim" brought or asserted against a Purchaser Party "by a third party" that,
if adversely determined, would entitle such Purchaser Party to indemnity
pursuant to _Sections 9.02_ or 

 



48   _11.03(a)_ , and the procedures set forth in this _Section 9.04_ shall
apply to any such matter as though it were an action, lawsuit, proceeding,
investigation or other claim brought or asserted by a third party; _provided_
that the Purchaser shall notify the Stockholder Representative of such matter
in writing promptly after discovering it (and, if reasonably practicable,
prior to such matter being disclosed to any Governmental Authority)
describing the matter, the basis for a claim for indemnification related
thereto and the amount thereof (if known and quantifiable); _provided_
_further_ that subject to _Section 9.01_, the failure to provide such
notification shall not relieve the Indemnitor of its obligations hereunder
except to the extent, and only to the extent, the Indemnitor shall have been
prejudiced as a result of such failure.

 

(c) If the Indemnitor is permitted to assume and control the defense and
elects to do so, the Indemnitee shall have the right to employ counsel
separate from counsel employed by the Indemnitor in any such action and to
participate in the defense thereof, but the fees and expenses of such counsel
employed by the Indemnitee that are incurred after the
Indemnitors assumption and control of the defense shall be at the expense of
the Indemnitee unless the employment thereof and payment therefor has been
specifically authorized by the Indemnitor in writing.

 

(d) If the Indemnitor shall control the defense of any such claim, then the
Indemnitor shall be entitled to settle such claim,  _provided_ that the
Indemnitor shall obtain the prior written consent of the Indemnitee (which
consent shall not be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed) before
entering into any settlement of a claim or ceasing to defend such claim if,
pursuant to or as a result of such settlement or cessation, injunctive or
other equitable relief will be imposed against the Indemnitee or if such
settlement does not expressly and unconditionally release the Indemnitee from
all liabilities and obligations with respect to such claim without prejudice.
If the Indemnitee shall control the defense of any such claim due to (i) the
Indemnitors election not to assume control of the defense of such claim or
(ii) the Indemnitors inability to assume control of the defense of such
claim due to the existence of one or more Litigation Conditions, the
Indemnitee shall not pay or settle any such claim without the prior written
consent of the Indemnitor, which consent may not be unreasonably withheld,
conditioned or delayed. If the Purchaser is asserting a claim for
indemnification under _Section 9.02_ or _Section 11.03(a)_ hereof, the
Stockholder Representative and/or Equityholders shall have the rights of the
Indemnitor hereunder and the reasonable and documented out-of-pocket expenses
of the Stockholder Representative and/or the Equityholders incurred in
defending a claim (or any participation in a claim that could result in a
disbursement to the Purchaser from the Escrow Account) shall be reimbursed,
when and as incurred, from the funds remaining in the Escrow Account.

 

(e) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this Agreement,
after the Closing, the Purchaser shall have the sole right to control and
make all decisions regarding interests in any Tax audit or administrative or
court proceeding relating to Taxes, including selection of counsel and
selection of a forum for such contest, _provided_ , _however_ , that in the
event such audit or proceeding relates to Taxes for which the Purchaser is
indemnified from the Indemnity Escrow Amount, (i) the Purchaser, the Company
(or, if applicable, a Subsidiary), and the Stockholder Representative shall 

 



49  cooperate in the conduct of any audit or proceeding relating to such period,
(ii) the Company shall bear any expenses relating to such audit, (iii) the
Stockholder Representative shall have the right (but not the obligation) to
fully participate in such audit or proceeding at the Stockholder
Representatives expense (including by reviewing and commenting on draft
submissions and attending any in person meetings or telephone conferences),
(iv) if the Stockholder Representative has not elected to control such audit
or proceeding, the Purchaser shall not enter into any agreement with the
relevant Tax authority pertaining to such Taxes without the written consent
of the Stockholder Representative, which consent shall not unreasonably be
delayed, conditioned or withheld, or, if the Stockholder Representative has
elected to control such audit or proceeding, the Stockholder Representative
shall not enter into any agreement with the relevant Tax authority pertaining
to such Taxes without the written consent of the Purchaser, which consent
shall not unreasonably be delayed, conditioned or withheld, and (v) the
Purchaser may, without the written consent of the Stockholder Representative,
enter into such an agreement, provided that Purchaser shall have agreed in
writing to accept responsibility and liability for the payment of such Taxes
and to forego any indemnification or other claim under this Agreement with
respect to such Taxes.

9.05 _Determination of Loss Amount_. The amount of any Loss subject to
indemnification under Section 9.02 or Section 9.03 shall be calculated net of
(i) any Tax benefit actually realized by the Indemnitee or its Affiliates on
account of such Loss on or before the second anniversary of the end of the
taxable year in which the Loss occurs and (ii) any insurance proceeds or any
indemnity, contribution or other similar payment actually recovered (net of
any deductible payable with respect to the applicable insurance policy,
indemnity contribution or similar payment borne and any related cost of
collection, in each case by a Purchaser Party or Equityholder Party) by the
Indemnitee from any third party with respect thereto (including pursuant to
any contractual rights to third party indemnification in favor of the Company
existing as of the Closing Date). A Tax benefit shall be realized upon the
receipt of a refund of Taxes paid (or credit in lieu of refund) or the filing
of a Tax Return, including an estimated Tax Return, showing a Tax benefit,
including any increase in Tax attributes (or, if earlier, the date when such
a Tax Return should have been timely filed, including properly obtained
extensions) calculated on a "with and without" basis with respect to Tax
benefits arising as a result of such Loss. In the event that an insurance,
Tax benefit or other recovery specified in the first or next sentence of this
Section 9.05 is made by any Indemnitee with respect to any Loss for which any
such Person has been indemnified hereunder, then a refund equal to the
aggregate amount of the recovery (less the cost of collection of such recovery
and any portion of the Loss paid by the Indemnitee or any Affiliate thereof
(and not indemnified hereunder) due to the limitation on liability provisions
(including the Deductible) that may be applicable to such recovery) shall be
made promptly to the Indemnitor. The Purchaser Parties shall use reasonable
best efforts to collect or recover from their subcontractors (including
by direct collection, withholding of other payments owed, seeking
indemnification and reimbursement or otherwise) with respect to any Losses
actually suffered by the Purchaser Parties arising out of the Special Tax
Matter, whether or not such Losses are indemnifiable hereunder. If the
Purchaser Parties recover or receive any proceeds (e.g., an award of damages
or amount paid in settlement) related to the matters set forth on the Specific
Indemnity Schedule, such proceeds shall belong to the Equityholders, and the
Purchaser shall promptly pay the amount of such proceeds to the Stockholder
Representative, for the benefit of the Equityholders, within fifteen (15) days
after such recovery or receipt, and the Stockholder Representative shall
distribute such proceeds in accordance with Section 1.05(b) with respect to
the Optionholders.

 



50 9.06 _Mitigation_. After the Closing, each Person entitled to indemnification
hereunder shall use its commercially reasonable efforts to mitigate all
Losses after becoming aware of any event which could reasonably be expected to
give rise to any Losses that are indemnifiable or recoverable hereunder or in
connection herewith.

 

9.07 _Acknowledgement of the Parent, Purchaser and Merger Sub_. Each of the
Parent, Purchaser and the Merger Sub acknowledges that it has conducted to
its satisfaction an independent investigation and verification of the
financial condition, results of operations, assets, liabilities, properties
and projected operations of the Company and its Subsidiaries and, in making
its determination to proceed with the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement, the Purchaser and the Merger Sub have relied on the results of
their own independent investigation and verification and the representations
and warranties of the Company expressly and specifically set forth in
_Article V_ , as qualified by the Disclosure Schedules, and have not relied on
anything else. The representations and warranties of the Company in _Article
V_ , as modified by the Disclosure Schedules, constitute the sole and
exclusive representations and warranties of the Company and the Non-Recourse
Parties to the Parent, Purchaser and the Merger Sub in connection with the
transactions contemplated hereby. THE PARENT, PURCHASER AND THE MERGER SUB
UNDERSTAND, ACKNOWLEDGE AND AGREE THAT ALL OTHER REPRESENTATIONS AND
WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND OR NATURE EXPRESSED OR IMPLIED (INCLUDING, BUT NOT
LIMITED TO, ANY RELATING TO THE FUTURE OR HISTORICAL FINANCIAL CONDITION,
RESULTS OF OPERATIONS, PROJECTIONS OR FORECASTS WITH RESPECT TO THE REVENUES,
ASSETS OR LIABILITIES OF THE COMPANY OR ANY OF ITS SUBSIDIARIES, OR THE
QUALITY, QUANTITY OR CONDITION OF THE COMPANYS OR ITS SUBSIDIARIES ASSETS OR
RELATING TO ANY OTHER INFORMATION PROVIDED TO PURCHASER) ARE SPECIFICALLY
DISCLAIMED BY THE COMPANY, ITS SUBSIDIARIES AND THE EQUITYHOLDER PARTIES, AND
THE PURCHASER PARTIES HAVE NOT AND WILL NOT RELY ON ANY SUCH OTHER
REPRESENTATIONS AND WARRANTIES, AND ANY SUCH OTHER REPRESENTATIONS AND
WARRANTIES SHALL NOT (EXCEPT AS OTHERWISE EXPRESSLY REPRESENTED AND WARRANTED
TO IN THIS AGREEMENT OR ANY OTHER TRANSACTION DOCUMENT) FORM THE BASIS OF ANY
CLAIM AGAINST THE COMPANY, ITS SUBSIDIARIES OR THE EQUITYHOLDER PARTIES, THE
STOCKHOLDER REPRESENTATIVE, OR ANY OF THEIR RESPECTIVE AFFILIATES OR
REPRESENTATIVES WITH RESPECT THERETO OR WITH RESPECT TO ANY RELATED MATTER.
Neither the Company nor any other Person will have or be subject to any
liability to Parent, Purchaser, the Merger Sub or any other Person resulting
from the distribution to Parent, Purchaser or the Merger Sub, or Parents,
Purchasers or the Merger Subs use of any information provided to the
Purchaser Parties (other than the express representations and warranties set
forth in the Transaction Agreements), including any information, documents,
projections, forecasts or other material made available to Parent, Purchaser,
the Merger Sub or its or their representatives in certain "data rooms," SCIF
facilities or management presentations or otherwise in expectation of the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement. NONE OF THE COMPANY, THE
STOCKHOLDER REPRESENTATIVE OR THE EQUITYHOLDERS MAKES OR PROVIDES, AND THE
PARENT, PURCHASER AND

 



51  THE MERGER SUB HEREBY WAIVE, ANY WARRANTY OR REPRESENTATION, EXPRESS OR
IMPLIED, AS TO THE QUALITY, MERCHANTABILITY, FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE,
CONFORMITY TO SAMPLES, OR CONDITION OF THE COMPANYS OR ITS SUBSIDIARIES
ASSETS OR ANY PART THEREOF, IN EACH CASE EXCEPT FOR THE REPRESENTATIONS AND
WARRANTIES EXPRESSLY SET FORTH. IN THIS AGREEMENT AND THE OTHER TRANSACTION
DOCUMENTS. With respect to any projection or forecast delivered by or on
behalf of the Company and its Subsidiaries to the Parent, Purchaser or the
Merger Sub, each of the Parent, Purchaser and the Merger Sub acknowledges that
(w) there are uncertainties inherent in attempting to make such projections
and other forecasts and plans, and that each of the Parent, Purchaser and the
Merger Sub is taking full responsibility for making its own evaluation of the
adequacy and accuracy of all estimates, projections and other forecasts and
plans so furnished to it, including the reasonableness of the assumptions
underlying such estimates, projections and forecasts, (x) the accuracy and
correctness of such projections and forecasts may be affected by information
which may become available through discovery or otherwise after the date of
such projections and forecasts, (y) it is familiar with each of the foregoing
and (z) none of the Company, the Equityholders or the Stockholder
Representative or the Equityholder Parties is making any representation or
warranty with respect to such projections or forecasts, including the
reasonableness of the assumptions underlying such projections or forecasts.

10.01 _Termination_. This Agreement may be terminated at any time prior to the
Closing:

 

(a) by the mutual written consent of the Purchaser and the Company;

 

(b) by the Purchaser, upon written notice to the other parties hereto, if
there has been a material violation or breach by the Company of any covenant,
representation or warranty contained in this Agreement that has prevented the
satisfaction of any condition to the obligations of the Purchaser or the
Merger Sub at the Closing and such violation or breach has not been waived by
the Purchaser or cured by the Company within thirty (30) days after receipt by
the Company of written notice thereof from the Purchaser or the Merger Sub;
_provided_ , _however_ , that the Purchaser is not then in material breach of
this Agreement so as to cause any conditions set forth in _Section 4.02_ not
to be satisfied;

(c) by the Company, upon written notice to the other parties hereto, if there
has been a material violation or breach by the Purchaser or the Merger Sub of
any covenant, representation or warranty contained in this Agreement that has
prevented the satisfaction of any condition to the obligations of the Company
at the Closing and such violation or breach has not been waived by the Company
or cured by the Purchaser or the Merger Sub within thirty (30) days after
receipt by the Purchaser of written notice thereof from the Company (provided
that none of (i) a breach by the Purchaser of _Section 6.07_ hereof, (ii) the
failure of the Closing to occur on the date specified in _Section 3.01_ or
(iii) the failure to deliver the Closing Stock Merger Consideration or the
Closing Option

 



52  Merger Consideration or the other payments contemplated by _Section 3.02_
at the Closing as required hereunder shall be subject to cure hereunder unless
otherwise agreed to in writing by the Company); _provided_ , _however_ , that
the Company is not then in material breach of this Agreement so as to cause
any conditions set forth in _Section 4.01_ not to be satisfied;

 

(d) by the Purchaser or the Company upon written notice to the other parties
hereto, if the transactions contemplated hereby have not been consummated on
or before December 31, 2013 (such date, the " _Outside Date_ "); _provided_
that if the satisfaction, or waiver by the appropriate party, of all of the
conditions contained in _Article IV_ hereof (other than those conditions that
by their terms or nature are to be satisfied at the Closing) occurs two
Business Days or less prior to the Outside Date, then neither the Purchaser
nor Company shall be permitted to terminate this Agreement pursuant to this
_Section 10.01(d)_ until the third Business Day after the Outside Date; or

(e) by the Purchaser or the Company, upon written notice to the other parties
hereto, if the Stockholder Approval shall not have been delivered within one
Business Day following the date hereof, provided that any such termination
must be made within three Business Days of the date hereof.

10.02 _Effect of Termination_. In the event this Agreement is terminated by
either the Purchaser or the Company, as provided in _Section 10.01_, the
provisions of this Agreement shall immediately become void and of no further
force and effect (other than this _Section 10.02_, _Section 11.05_,
_Article XII_ and _Article XIII_ hereof (other than _Section 13.20_), which
shall survive the termination of this Agreement), and there shall be no
liability on the part of the Purchaser or the Merger Sub, the Stockholder
Representative, the Company or the Equityholders to one another, except for
willful breaches of this Agreement prior to the time of such termination. For
purposes of clarification, the parties agree that if the Purchaser or the
Merger Sub does not close the transactions contemplated hereby in
circumstances in which all of the closing conditions set forth in _Section
4.01_ have been satisfied or waived, such event shall be deemed to be a
willful breach by such Person of this Agreement.

 

ARTICLE XI

ADDITIONAL COVENANTS

11.01 _Disclosure Generally_. All Disclosure Schedules attached hereto are
incorporated herein and expressly made a part of this Agreement as though
completely set forth herein. All references to this Agreement herein or in any
of the Disclosure Schedules shall be deemed to refer to this entire Agreement,
including all Disclosure Schedules.

 

11.02 _Provision Respecting Legal Representation_. It is acknowledged by each
of the parties hereto that each of the Stockholder Representative, the
Company, their Subsidiaries and GTCR LLC have retained KandE to act as its
counsel in connection with the transactions contemplated hereby and that KandE
has not acted as counsel for any other party hereto in connection with the
transactions contemplated hereby and that none of the other parties hereto has
the status of a client of KandE for conflict of interest or any other purposes
as a result thereof.

 



53  The Purchaser, the Merger Sub, the Stockholder Representative, the Company,
and their respective Subsidiaries hereby agree, on their own behalf and on
behalf of their respective directors, equityholders, members, partners,
officers, employees and affiliates, that, in the event that a dispute arises
after the Closing between the Purchaser, the Surviving Corporation, and/or its
Subsidiaries on the one hand, and the Stockholder Representative, GTCR LLC or
their respective Affiliates, on the other hand, KandE may represent the
Stockholder Representative, GTCR LLC and/or such Affiliates in such dispute
even though the interests of the Stockholder Representative, GTCR LLC and/or
such Affiliates may be directly adverse to the Purchaser, the Surviving
Corporation or its Subsidiaries, and even though KandE may have represented the
Company or its Subsidiaries in a matter substantially related to such dispute,
or may be handling ongoing matters for the Purchaser, the Surviving
Corporation or any of their Subsidiaries. The Purchaser and the Merger Sub
further agree that, as to all communications among KandE, the Company, its
Subsidiaries, the Stockholder Representative, GTCR LLC and/or any of their
respective Affiliates that relate in any way to the transactions contemplated
by this Agreement, the attorneyclient privilege and the expectation of client
confidence belongs to the Stockholder Representative and may be controlled by
the Stockholder Representative and shall not pass to or be claimed by the
Purchaser, the Surviving Corporation or any of their Subsidiaries.
Notwithstanding the foregoing, in the event that a dispute arises between the
Purchaser, the Surviving Corporation or any of their Subsidiaries and a third
party (other than a party to this Agreement or any of their respective
Affiliates) after the Closing, the Surviving Corporation and its Subsidiaries
may assert the attorneyclient privilege to prevent disclosure of
confidential communications by KandE to such third party; _provided_ , _however_
, that neither the Surviving Corporation nor its Subsidiaries may waive such
privilege without the prior written consent of the Stockholder Representative
and GTCR LLC.

11.03 _Tax Matters_.

 

(a) Subject to the provisions of _Article IX_ , the Purchaser and its
Affiliates shall be indemnified from the Indemnity Escrow Amount then
remaining and available in the Escrow Account from and against (i) all Taxes
(or the non-payment thereof) of the Company and its Subsidiaries for all
taxable periods or portions thereof ending on or before the Closing
Date, (ii) any and all Taxes of any member of an affiliated, consolidated,
combined, or unitary group of which the Company or any of its Subsidiaries (or
any predecessor of any of the foregoing) is or was a member on or prior to the
Closing, including pursuant to Treasury Regulations Section 1.1502-6 or any
analogous or similar state, local, or foreign law or regulation, and (iii) any
and all Taxes of any Person imposed on the Company or any of its Subsidiaries
as a transferee or successor, by contract (other than (x) any such customary
agreements with customers, vendors, lenders, lessors or the like entered into
in the Ordinary Course of Business, (y) property Taxes payable with respect to
leased property and (z) any other agreements for which Taxes are not the
principal subject matter), which Taxes are imposed on the Company or any of
its Subsidiaries as a result of an event or transaction occurring on or prior
to the Closing, but, in each case, excluding (1) any Taxes to the extent
taken into account in determining the Final Merger Consideration, (2) any
Taxes that are attributable to an election under Section 338 of the Code (or
any similar provision of state, local or foreign Law) by the Purchaser, the
Company or any of their Affiliates (other than any election under Section 338
made by the Company or any Affiliate prior to

 



54  the Closing Date, unless so made at the request of Purchaser or any of its
Affiliates), (3) any Taxes attributable to any events occurring after the
Closing on the Closing Date outside the Ordinary Course of Business and
undertaken by the Purchaser or its Affiliates, (4) any Taxes attributable to a
breach by the Purchaser (or, after the Closing, the Company and its
Subsidiaries) of any of the covenants made by such parties herein (5) any
Taxes for any Taxable period or portion thereof beginning after the Closing
Date, (6) any non-income Taxes (other than the Special Tax Matter), and (7)
any Taxes attributable to or arising or resulting from the matters set forth
on the _Specific Indemnity Schedule_ , which shall be covered exclusively by
_Section 9.02(a)(vi)_. For the avoidance of doubt, Taxes described in clause
(i) of the preceding sentence shall be determined in a manner reflecting the
provisions of _Section 11.03(e)_. In the case of any Taxes that are imposed
on a periodic basis and are payable for a Tax period that includes (but does
not end on) the Closing Date, the portion of such Tax related to the portion
of such Tax period ending on and including the Closing Date shall (x) in the
case of any property Taxes and similar ad valorem Taxes, be deemed to be the
amount of such Tax for the entire Tax period multiplied by a fraction,
the numerator of which is the number of days in the Tax period ending on and
including the Closing Date, and the denominator of which is the number of days
in the entire Tax period, and (y) in the case of any other Tax, be deemed
equal to the amount which would be payable if the relevant Tax period ended
on and included the Closing Date (and for such purpose, the Taxable period of
any partnership or other pass-through entity in which the Company or any
Subsidiary holds a beneficial interest shall be deemed to terminate at such
time).

(b) The Purchaser shall prepare or cause to be prepared and timely file or
cause to be filed all Tax Returns for the Company and its Subsidiaries for all
periods ending prior to or including the Closing Date the due date of which
(including extensions) is after the Closing Date. Each such Tax Return shall
be prepared and timely filed in a manner consistent with past practice,
except as otherwise required by applicable Law. The Purchaser shall bear the
cost of preparing such Tax Returns, except for the costs directly relating to
the preparation of any IRS Form 1139 or any state carryback returns relating
to a taxable period ending on or prior to the Closing Date, which cost shall
be borne by the Equityholders. The Purchaser shall use the same accounting
firm to prepare such Tax Returns as the Company used prior to the Closing,
which firm shall be directed to submit its invoices for preparing such Tax
Returns to the Company for payment. At least fifteen (15) calendar days prior
to the date on which any such income Tax Return is required to be filed, the
Purchaser shall submit such Tax Return to the Stockholder Representative for
the Stockholder Representatives review and comment. In the event of a dispute
between Purchaser and Stockholder Representative with respect to the proper
reporting of any item on such income Tax Return, the parties agree to select a
mutually acceptable accounting firm to resolve such dispute and agree that the
decision of such firm shall be binding on both parties, with the cost of
such firm shared equally between Purchaser and Stockholder Representative.
The Purchaser shall cause the Company and its Subsidiaries to timely file all
such Tax Returns prepared pursuant to this _Section 11.03(b)_. No income Tax
Return described in this _Section 11.03(b)_ shall be filed without the
written consent of the Stockholder Representative, which consent shall not be
unreasonably delayed, conditioned or withheld; _provided_ , _however_ , that
in the event of any dispute between the Purchaser and the Stockholder
Representative that is unable to

 



55  be resolved prior to the due date of any income Tax Return, Purchaser shall,
in all events, be permitted to file such Tax Return by its due date, provided
further that, upon the resolution of such dispute by the accounting firm
referred to herein, Purchaser shall promptly amend such income Tax Return (if
necessary) in a manner consistent with such resolution and shall not be
entitled to any indemnification with respect to items on such income Tax
Return until the filing of such amended return pursuant to such resolution.

(c) Without the prior written consent of the Stockholder Representative, the
Purchaser will not (i) file or amend or permit the Surviving Corporation or
its Subsidiaries to file or amend any Tax Return relating to any Pre-Closing
Tax Period, (ii) extend or waive, or cause to be extended or waived, or
permit the Surviving Corporation or its Subsidiaries to extend or waive, any
statute of limitations or other period for the assessment of any Tax or
deficiency related to a Pre-Closing Tax Period, or (iii) make or change any
Tax election or accounting method or practice that has retroactive effect to
any Pre-Closing Tax Period.

 

(d) All refunds of Taxes received by the Purchaser, the Surviving Corporation
or any of their Subsidiaries attributable to any Taxes of the Company or its
Subsidiaries for any Pre-Closing Tax Period (including any Tax refunds (or
credits in lieu of refunds) attributable to the carryback of items under
_Section 11.03(e)_ below) shall be for the account of the Equityholders, and
Purchaser and the Surviving Corporation shall pay such Tax refund (or credit
in lieu of refund) over to the Stockholder Representative (on behalf of the
Equityholders) within five (5) days after receipt of such refund (or
the filing of any Tax Return reflecting a credit in lieu of such refund).
After the Closing, the Purchaser shall cause the Surviving Corporation and its
Subsidiaries to work in good faith and diligently prosecute any Tax refund
claims and make any Tax elections in order to legally maximize and obtain any
such Tax refunds or credits. To the extent permitted by applicable Law, the
Purchaser shall cause the Company and its Subsidiaries to request a refund
(rather than a credit in lieu of refund) with respect to all Pre-Closing Tax
Periods. The Purchaser agrees to cooperate with the Stockholder Representative
with respect to the filing and pursuit of any refund claim for a Pre-Closing
Tax Period unless the Purchaser, in the reasonable exercise of its
discretion, determines that the filing and pursuit of any such refund claim
(other than a refund claim attributable to or in any way relating to the items
set forth on the _Tax Refunds Schedule_ , which Purchaser shall
diligently prosecute in any event) will adversely affect the Purchaser, the
Company, or any Subsidiary with respect to any Tax period ending after the
Closing Date. Subject to the provisions of Section 11.03(b), the Equityholders
shall bear any additional, reasonable costs of filing any amended returns and
pursuing any refund claims for a Pre-Closing Tax Period, including any costs
related to responding to any inquiries from any Governmental Entity related
thereto.

 

(e) In connection with the preparation of Tax Returns under _Section
11.03(b)_, (x) all Transaction Tax Deductions shall be treated as properly
allocable to the Pre-Closing Tax Period ending on the Closing Date to the
extent that such deductions are "more likely than not" deductible in such
period and such Tax Returns shall include all such Transaction Tax Deductions
as deductions in the Tax Returns of the Company or its Subsidiaries for the
Pre-Closing Tax Period that ends on the Closing Date, and (y) the

 



56  Company and its Subsidiaries shall elect to carry back any item of loss,
deduction or credit from the tax period ending on the Closing Date, including
any Transaction Tax Deductions, to prior taxable years to the fullest extent
permitted by law (using any available short-form or accelerated procedures
(including filing IRS Form 1139 and any corresponding form for applicable
state, local and foreign tax purposes) and filing amended Tax Returns to the
extent necessary) and to obtain any potential Tax refunds or claims related
thereto.

(f) The Purchaser and the Stockholder Representative shall cooperate fully,

arising under this Agreement and the Transaction Agreements, including all
obligations paid to or owed to the Company, the Equityholders or the

this guarantee is one of payment, not collection, and a separate action or
actions may be brought and prosecuted against the Parent to enforce this
guarantee, irrespective of whether any action is brought against the
Purchaser or the Merger Sub or whether the Purchaser or the Merger Sub is
joined in any such actions, and irrespective of whether the Purchaser or any
other Person was primarily responsible for causing the breach of the
Obligations of the Purchaser. If the Purchaser fails to perform any of the
Obligations requiring payment, in whole or in part, when such Obligation is
due, the Parent shall promptly pay such Obligation in lawful money of the
United States and in any event within five (5) Business Days of receipt of
written demand for payment from the Company. The Company and the Equityholders
may enforce Parents obligations under this _Section 11.05_ without first
suing Purchaser or Merger Sub or joining Purchaser or Merger Sub in any suit
against Parent, or enforcing any rights and remedies against Purchaser or
Merger Subsidiary, or otherwise pursuing or asserting any claims or rights
against Purchaser or Merger Sub or any other person or entity or any of its
or their property which may also be liable with respect to the matters for
which Parent is liable under this _Section 11.05_ whether Purchaser or any
other Person was primarily responsible for causing the breach of the
Obligations of Purchaser.

(b) The Parent agrees that its obligations hereunder shall not be released or
discharged, in whole or in part, or otherwise affected by (i) the existence of
any claim, set-off or other right which the Parent may have at any time
against the Purchaser, whether in connection with the Obligations
or otherwise; (ii) any insolvency, bankruptcy, reorganization or other
similar proceeding affecting the Purchaser; (iii) the failure of the Company
to assert any claim or demand or to enforce any right or remedy against the
Purchaser; (iv) any change in the corporate existence, structure or ownership
of the Purchaser; (v) the adequacy of any other means the Company may have of
obtaining payment of any of the Obligations; or (vi) any change in the time,
place or manner of payment of any of the Obligations or any rescission,
waiver, compromise, consolidation or other amendment or modification of any of
the terms or provisions of this Agreement. The Parent waives promptness,
diligence, notice of the acceptance of this guarantee and of the Obligations,
presentment, demand for payment, notice of non-performance, default, dishonor
and protest, notice of any Obligations incurred and all other notices of any
kind, any right to require the marshalling of assets of Purchaser, all
defenses which may be available by virtue of any valuation, stay, moratorium
law or other similar law now or hereafter in effect and all suretyship
defenses generally.

 



59 (c) The Parent hereby unconditionally and irrevocably agrees, unless and
until all of the Obligations shall have been irrevocably paid in full in
cash, not to exercise any rights that it may now have or hereafter acquire
against Purchaser that arise from the existence, payment, performance or
enforcement of the Parents obligations under or in respect of this guarantee
or any other agreement, including, without limitation, any right of
subrogation, reimbursement, exoneration, contribution or indemnification and
any right to participate in any claim or remedy of the Company or
Equityholders against Purchaser, whether or not such claim, remedy or right
arises in equity or under contract, statute or common law, including, without
limitation, the right to take or receive from Purchaser, directly or
indirectly, in cash or other property or by setoff or in any other manner,
payment or security on account of such claim, remedy or right. The Company and
the Equityholders shall not be obligated to file any claim relating to the
Obligations in the event that Purchaser becomes subject to a reorganization,
bankruptcy or similar proceeding, and the failure of the Company to so file
shall not affect the Parents obligations. In the event that any payment to
the Company in respect of an Obligation is rescinded or must otherwise be
returned, and is returned, to Purchaser in connection with any such
proceeding, the Parent shall remain liable hereunder with respect to its
Obligations as if such payment had not been made.

ARTICLE XIII

 

MISCELLANEOUS

13.01  _Stockholder Representative_.

(a) _Designation_. The Stockholder Representative is hereby designated by each
of the Equityholders to serve as the Stockholder Representative of the
Equityholders with respect to the matters expressly set forth in this
Agreement to be performed by the Stockholder Representative.

 

(b) _Authority_. By the approval of this Agreement pursuant to the DGCL, the
Equityholders hereby irrevocably constitute and appoint the Stockholder
Representative as the representative, agent, proxy, and attorney-in-fact for
each of the Equityholders for all purposes authorized under this Agreement,
including the full power and authority on the Equityholders behalf (i) to
consummate the transactions contemplated herein; (ii) to pay such
Equityholders expenses incurred in connection with the negotiation
and performance of this Agreement (whether incurred on or after the date
hereof), including by using funds from the Representative Holdback Amount;
(iii) to disburse any funds received hereunder to such Equityholder and each
other Equityholder; (iv) to endorse and

 



70  deliver any certificates or instruments representing the Common Stock and
execute such further instruments of assignment as Purchaser and the Merger Sub
shall reasonably request; (v) to execute and deliver on behalf of such
Equityholder any amendment or waiver hereto; (vi) (A) to dispute or refrain
from disputing, on behalf of such Equityholder relative to any amounts to be
received by such Equityholder under this Agreement or any agreements
contemplated hereby, any claim made by the Purchaser under this Agreement or
other agreements contemplated hereby, (B) to negotiate and compromise, on
behalf of such Equityholder, any dispute that may arise under, and exercise
or refrain from exercising any remedies available under, this Agreement or
any other agreement contemplated hereby, and (C) to execute, on behalf of such
Equityholder, any settlement agreement, release or other document with respect
to such dispute or remedy; (vii) to engage attorneys, accountants, agents or
consultants on behalf of the Equityholders in connection with this Agreement
or any other agreement contemplated hereby and paying any fees related thereto
(viii) to take all other actions to be taken by or on behalf of such
Equityholder in connection herewith; (ix) to retain the Representative
Holdback Amount and pay amounts therefrom in accordance with this Agreement;
and (x) to do each and every act and exercise any and all rights which such
Equityholder or the Equityholders collectively are permitted or required to do
or exercise under this Agreement. Each of the Equityholders agrees that such
agency and proxy are coupled with an interest, are therefore irrevocable
without the consent of the Stockholder Representative and shall survive the
death, incapacity, bankruptcy, dissolution or liquidation of any Equityholder.
If any Equityholder dies or becomes incapacitated, disabled or incompetent
(such deceased, incapacitated, disabled or incompetent Equityholder being a "
_Former Equityholder_ ") and, as a result, the agency and power of attorney
conferred by this _Section 13.01_ is revoked by operation of law, it shall
not be a breach by such Former Equityholder under this Agreement if the heirs,
beneficiaries, estate, administrator, executor, guardian, conservator or other
legal representative of such Former Equityholder (each a "
_Successor Equityholder_ ") confirms the appointment of the Stockholder
Representative as agent and attorney-in-fact for such Successor Equityholder.
In addition, if the agency and power of attorney conferred by this _Section
13.01_ is revoked by operation of law and thereafter not reconfirmed by the
Successor Equityholder prior to the Closing, such revocation shall not be
deemed a breach by the Successor Equityholder of any of the provisions of this
Agreement provided that the shares of Common Stock held by such Successor
Equityholder are delivered for transfer to the Purchaser at the Closing as
contemplated by _Section 1.04_, and further provided that such Successor
Equityholder executes and delivers such other certificates, documents or
instruments that would have been delivered on its behalf by the Stockholder
Representative had such Successor Equityholder reconfirmed the agency and
power of attorney conferred by this _Section 13.01_. All decisions and
actions by the Stockholder Representative (to the extent authorized by this
Agreement) shall be binding upon all of the Equityholders, and no Equityholder
shall have the right to object, dissent, protest or otherwise contest the
same. 

(c) _Authority; Indemnification_. Each Equityholder agrees that the Purchaser,
the Merger Sub and the Surviving Corporation shall be entitled to rely on any
action taken by the Stockholder Representative, on behalf of such
Equityholder, pursuant to _Section 13.01(b)_ above (an " _Authorized Action_
"), and that each Authorized Action shall be binding on each Equityholder as
fully as if such Equityholder had taken such

 



71  Authorized Action. The Purchaser and the Merger Sub agree that the
Stockholder Representative, as the Stockholder Representative, shall have no
liability to Purchaser and the Merger Sub for any Authorized Action, except
that the Stockholder Representative shall not be relieved of liability to the
extent that such Authorized Action is found by a final order of a court of
competent jurisdiction to have constituted fraud or willful misconduct by the
Stockholder Representative. Each Stockholder (based on such Stockholders
Residual Percentage) hereby severally, for itself only and not jointly and
severally, agrees to indemnify and hold harmless the Stockholder
Representative against all fees, costs, expenses (including reasonable
attorneys fees), judgments, fines and amounts paid in settlement actually and
reasonably incurred by the Stockholder Representative in connection with any
action, suit or proceeding to which the Stockholder Representative is made a
party by reason of the fact it is or was acting as the Stockholder
Representative pursuant to the terms of this Agreement.

 

(d) _Exculpation_. The Stockholder Representative shall not have by reason of
this Agreement a fiduciary relationship in respect of any Equityholder,
except in respect of amounts received on behalf of such Equityholder. The
Stockholder Representative shall not be liable to any Equityholder for any
action taken or omitted by it or any agent employed by it hereunder or under
any other document entered into in connection herewith, except that the
Stockholder Representative shall not be relieved of any liability imposed by
law for willful misconduct. The Stockholder Representative shall not be liable
to the Equityholders for any apportionment or distribution of payments made
by the Stockholder Representative in good faith, and if any such apportionment
or distribution is subsequently determined to have been made in error the sole
recourse of any Equityholder to whom payment was due, but not made, shall be
to recover from other Equityholders any payment in excess of the amount to
which they are determined to have been entitled. The Stockholder
Representative shall not be required to make any inquiry concerning either
the performance or observance of any of the terms, provisions or conditions of
this Agreement. Neither the Stockholder Representative nor any agent employed
by it shall incur any liability to any Equityholder by virtue of the failure
or refusal of the Stockholder Representative for any reason to consummate the
transactions contemplated hereby or relating to the performance of its other
duties hereunder, except for actions or omissions constituting fraud or bad
faith. 

(e) Upon resolution of the merger consideration adjustments as set forth in
_Article II_ , the Stockholder Representative will within five (5) business
days of such date obtain reimbursement for any outstanding Representative
Expenses for which it is due reimbursement under this Agreement and for which
it has not been reimbursed prior to such time and distribute any remaining
portion of the Representative Holdback Amount to the Equityholders on a pro
rata basis according to each Equityholders Residual Percentage, it being
understood and agreed that such distribution(s) shall be the responsibility
of the Stockholder Representative only and that neither the Purchaser nor the
Surviving Corporation shall have any obligation to ensure that such
distribution is, or distributions are, made. If there are open claims that
remain unresolved with respect to the purchase price adjustments as set forth
in _Article II_ on such distribution date, the Stockholder Representative will
within five (5) business days after the date of resolution of such claims
obtain reimbursement for any outstanding Representative Expenses for

 



72  which it is due reimbursement pursuant to this Agreement and for which it
has not been reimbursed prior to such time and distribute any remaining
portion of the Representative Holdback Amount to the Equityholders on a pro
rata basis according to each Equityholders Residual Percentage, it being
understood and agreed that such distribution(s) shall be the responsibility of
the Stockholder Representative only and that neither the Purchaser nor the
Surviving Corporation shall have any obligation to ensure that such
distribution is, or distributions are, made, and that such distributions will
be made in accordance with _Section 1.05(b)_ with respect to
the Optionholders. If the Representative Holdback Amount is insufficient to
reimburse the Stockholder Representative in full, the Stockholder
Representative may instruct the Purchaser or the Escrow Agent, as the case may
be, when making any payments to the Equityholders, to direct to the
Stockholder Representative sufficient funds from such payments to the
Equityholders to pay the amount of any such shortfall to the Stockholder
Representative. Such payment to the Stockholder Representative shall be
deducted from the funds otherwise being directed to the Equityholders, and
allocated among the Equityholders on a pro rata basis according to each
Equityholders Residual Percentage.

 

13.02 _Press Releases and Communications_. No press release or public
announcement related to this Agreement or the transactions contemplated
herein, or prior to the Closing any other announcement or communication to the
employees, customers or suppliers of the Company, shall be issued or made by
any party hereto (or any Affiliate to a party hereto) without the joint
approval of Purchaser and the Company, unless required by Law (in the
reasonable opinion of counsel) in which case Purchaser and the Company shall
have the right to review such press release, announcement or communication
prior to issuance, distribution or publication.

13.03 _Expenses_. Except as otherwise expressly provided herein, each of the
Company, Purchaser and Merger Sub shall pay all of their own fees and
expenses incurred in connection with this Agreement and the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement, including the fees and disbursements of
counsel, financial advisors and accountants; provided that (a) in the event
that the transactions contemplated by this Agreement are consummated,
Purchaser shall pay all the Transaction Expenses as provided in _Section
3.02(k)_, (b) Purchaser shall pay all filing fees under the HSR Act and under
any such other applicable Laws as provided in _Section 8.04_ and (c)
Purchaser shall pay all fees and expenses that it has agreed to pay pursuant
to this Agreement.

 

13.04 _Knowledge Defined_. For purposes of this Agreement, (a) "the Companys
knowledge" and "knowledge of the Company" as used herein shall mean the
actual knowledge of Robert Coleman, Jack Pearlstein, Tom Ladd, Mike
Zembrzuski, Mike Kushin and Paul Schauer, and (b) "the Parents knowledge,"
"the Purchasers knowledge" or "the Merger Subs knowledge" as used herein
shall mean the actual knowledge of Thomas A. Mutryn.

13.05  _Notices_. All notices, demands and other communications to be given
or delivered under or by reason of the provisions of this Agreement shall be
in writing and shall be deemed to have been given (a) when personally
delivered, (b) when transmitted via telecopy (or other facsimile device) to
the number set out below if the sender on the same day sends a confirming copy
of such notice by a recognized overnight delivery service (charges prepaid),

Schedule" or "Schedule" shall be deemed to refer to an article of this
Agreement, section of this Agreement, exhibit to this Agreement or a schedule
to this Agreement, as applicable. Capitalized terms used in the Disclosure
Schedules

 



75  and not otherwise defined therein have the meanings given to them in this
Agreement. The words "hereof," "herein" and "hereunder" and words of similar
import referring to this Agreement refer to this Agreement as a whole and not
to any particular provision of this Agreement. The word "including" or any
variation thereof means "including, without limitation" and shall not be
construed to limit any general statement that it follows to the specific or
similar items or matters immediately following it. Unless the context
otherwise clearly indicates, each defined term used in this Agreement shall
have a comparable meaning when used in its plural or singular form.

13.09 _Construction_. The language used in this Agreement shall be deemed to
be the language chosen by the parties hereto to express their mutual intent,
and no rule of strict construction shall be applied against any Person. Any
information set forth in any Schedule or incorporated in any Section of the
Agreement shall be considered to have been set forth in each other Schedule
and shall be deemed to modify the representations and warranties in _Article
V_ of the Agreement whether or not such representations and warranties refer
to such Schedule to the extent its relevance is reasonably apparent on its
face. In the event a subject matter is addressed in more than one
representation and warranty in _Article V_ , the Purchaser and the Merger Sub
shall be entitled to rely only on the most specific representation
and warranty addressing such matter. The specification of any dollar amount
or the inclusion of any item in the representations and warranties contained
in this Agreement or the Disclosure Schedules or Exhibits attached hereto is
not intended to imply that the amounts, or higher or lower amounts, or the
items so included, or other items, are or are not required to be disclosed
(including whether such amounts or items are required to be disclosed as
material or threatened) or are within or outside of the Ordinary Course of
Business, and no party shall use the fact of the setting of the amounts or the
fact of the inclusion of any item in this Agreement or the Disclosure
Schedules or Exhibits in any dispute or controversy between the parties as to
whether any obligation, item or matter not described or included in this
Agreement or in any Schedule or Exhibit is or is not required to be disclosed
(including whether the amount or items are required to be disclosed as
material or threatened) or is within or outside of the Ordinary Course of
Business. The information contained in this Agreement and in the Disclosure
Schedules and Exhibits hereto is disclosed solely for purposes of this
Agreement, and no information contained herein or therein shall be deemed to
be an admission by any party hereto to any third party of any matter
whatsoever (including any violation of Law or breach of contract). For
purposes of this Agreement, if the Company or a Person acting on its behalf
posts a document (other than a document required to be delivered pursuant to
_Section 4.01(f)_ hereof) to the online data room hosted on behalf of the
Company and located at http://www.intralinks.com or makes any document
available to Purchaser or its representatives for review at a SCIF facility,
such document shall be deemed to have been "delivered," "furnished" or "made
available" (or any phrase of similar import) to the Purchaser and Merger Sub
by the Company. Prior to the Closing, the Company shall use commercially
reasonable efforts to deliver to Purchaser one or more CD-ROMs, in PC readable
format, that contain readable, working Adobe or other (i.e., Microsoft Office)
portable document format files that set forth all of the documents available
to the Purchaser and Merger Sub as of five days prior to the Closing Date in
the online data room hosted on behalf of the Company and located at
http://www.intralinks.com.

 

13.10 _Amendment and Waiver_. Any provision of this Agreement or the
Disclosure Schedules or Exhibits hereto may be amended or waived only in a
writing signed by the

 



76  Purchaser, the Merger Sub, the Company and the Stockholder Representative.
No waiver of any provision hereunder or any breach or default thereof shall
extend to or affect in any way any other provision or prior or subsequent
breach or default.

13.11 _Complete Agreement_. This Agreement and the documents referred to
herein (including the Confidentiality Agreement) contain the complete
agreement between the parties hereto and supersede any prior understandings,
agreements or representations by or between the parties, written or oral,
which may have related to the subject matter hereof in any way.

13.12 _Third-Party Beneficiaries_. Except as otherwise expressly provided
herein, nothing expressed or referred to in this Agreement will be construed
to give any Person other than the parties to this Agreement and the
Stockholders any legal or equitable right, remedy, or claim under or with
respect to this Agreement or any provision of this Agreement. Notwithstanding
the foregoing, (i) _Section 8.02_ shall be enforceable by the current and
former officers, directors and similar functionaries of the Company and/or its
Subsidiaries and their heirs and representatives, and (ii) _Section 13.19_
is intended for the benefit of, and shall be enforceable by, each Non-Recourse
Party of a party to this Agreement. In addition, after the Closing, the
Stockholder Representative shall have the right, but not the obligation, to
enforce any rights of any of the Equityholders under this Agreement.

 

13.13 _Waiver of Trial by Jury_. EACH PARTY TO THIS AGREEMENT HEREBY WAIVES,
TO THE FULLEST EXTENT PERMITTED BY LAW, ANY RIGHT TO TRIAL BY JURY OF ANY
CLAIM, DEMAND, ACTION, OR CAUSE OF ACTION (A) ARISING UNDER THIS AGREEMENT OR
THE ESCROW AGREEMENT OR (B) IN ANY WAY CONNECTED WITH OR RELATED OR INCIDENTAL
TO THE DEALINGS OF THE PARTIES HERETO IN RESPECT OF THIS AGREEMENT OR ANY OF
THE TRANSACTIONS RELATED HERETO, IN EACH CASE WHETHER NOW EXISTING OR
HEREAFTER ARISING, AND WHETHER IN CONTRACT, TORT, EQUITY, OR OTHERWISE. EACH
PARTY TO THIS AGREEMENT HEREBY AGREES AND CONSENTS THAT ANY SUCH CLAIM,
DEMAND, ACTION, OR CAUSE OF ACTION SHALL BE DECIDED BY COURT TRIAL WITHOUT A
JURY, AND THAT THE PARTIES TO THIS AGREEMENT MAY FILE A COPY OF THIS AGREEMENT
WITH ANY COURT AS WRITTEN EVIDENCE OF THE CONSENT OF THE PARTIES HERETO TO THE
WAIVER OF THEIR RIGHT TO TRIAL BY JURY.

13.14 _Purchaser and the Merger Sub Deliveries_. Each of the Purchaser and the
Merger Sub agrees and acknowledges that all documents or other items
delivered or made available to the Purchaser Parties shall be deemed to be
delivered or made available, as the case may be, to the Purchaser and the
Merger Sub for all purposes hereunder.

 

13.15 _Delivery by Electronic Transmission_. This Agreement and any signed
agreement entered into in connection herewith or contemplated hereby, and any
amendments hereto or thereto, to the extent signed and delivered by means of a
facsimile machine or by .pdf, .tif, .gif, .jpeg or similar attachment to
electronic mail, shall be treated in all manner and respects as an original
contract and shall be considered to have the same binding legal effects as if
it were the original signed version thereof delivered in person. At the
request of any party hereto or to any such contract, each other party hereto
or thereto shall reexecute original forms thereof and

 



77  deliver them to all other parties. No party hereto or to any such contract
shall raise the use of a facsimile machine or by .pdf, .tif, .gif, .jpeg or
similar attachment to electronic mail to deliver a signature or the fact that
any signature or contract was transmitted or communicated through the use of
facsimile machine or by .pdf, .tif, .gif, .jpeg or similar attachment to
electronic mail as a defense to the formation of a contract and each such
party forever waives any such defense.

13.16 _Counterparts_. This Agreement may be executed in multiple
counterparts, any one of which need not contain the signature of more than
one party, but all such counterparts taken together shall constitute one and
the same instrument.

 

13.17 _Governing Law_. All issues and questions concerning the construction,
validity, interpretation and enforceability of this Agreement and the
Exhibits and Schedules hereto shall be governed by, and construed in
accordance with, the laws of the State of Delaware, without giving effect to
any choice of law or conflict of law rules or provisions (whether of the State
of Delaware or any other jurisdiction) that would cause the application of
the laws of any jurisdiction other than the State of Delaware.

 

13.18 _Jurisdiction_. Except as otherwise expressly provided in this
Agreement, any suit, action or proceeding seeking to enforce any provision
of, or based on any matter arising out of or in connection with, this
Agreement or the transactions contemplated hereby may be brought in the United
States District Court for the District of Delaware, the Delaware Court of
Chancery of the State of Delaware or any other court of the State of
Delaware, and each of the parties hereto hereby consents to the exclusive
jurisdiction of such courts (and of the appropriate appellate courts
therefrom) in any such suit, action or proceeding and irrevocably waives, to
the fullest extent permitted by law, any objection which it may now or
hereafter have to the laying of the venue of any such suit, action or
proceeding in any such court or that any such suit, action or proceeding which
is brought in any such court has been brought in an inconvenient forum.
Process in any such suit, action or proceeding may be served on any party
anywhere in the world, whether within or without the jurisdiction of any such
court. Without limiting the foregoing, each party agrees that service of
process on such party as provided in _Section 13.05_ shall be deemed
effective service of process on such party.

 

13.19 _No Recourse_. Notwithstanding any provision of this Agreement or
otherwise, the parties to this Agreement agree on their own behalf and on
behalf of their respective Subsidiaries and Affiliates that no Non-Recourse
Party of a party to this Agreement shall have any liability relating to this
Agreement or any of the transactions contemplated herein except to the
extent agreed to in writing by such Non-Recourse Party.

13.20 _Specific Performance_.

 

(a) Each of the parties hereto acknowledges that the rights of each party to
consummate the transactions contemplated hereby are unique and recognizes and
affirms that in the event of a breach of this Agreement by any party, money
damages may be inadequate and the non-breaching party may have no adequate
remedy at law. Accordingly, the parties agree that such non-breaching party
shall have the right, in addition to any other rights and remedies existing in
their favor at law or in equity, to enforce their rights and the
other partys obligations hereunder not only by an action or

 



78  actions for damages but also by an action or actions for specific
performance, injunctive and/or other equitable relief (without posting of bond
or other security), in each case other than pursuant to _Sections 9.02(a)_ ,
_9.03(a)_ or _11.03(a)_.

(b) To the extent any party hereto brings any action, claim, complaint or
other proceeding, in each case, before any Governmental Entity to enforce
specifically the performance of the terms and provisions of this Agreement
prior to the Closing, the Outside Date shall automatically be extended by (i)
the amount of time during which such action, claim, complaint or other
proceeding is pending, plus twenty (20) Business Days, or (ii) such other time
period established by the court presiding over such action, claim,
complaint or other proceeding.

13.21 _Prevailing Party_. Except as otherwise provided in _Exhibit D_ which
controls the allocation or the fees and expenses of the Valuation Firm, in
the event any litigation or other court action, arbitration or similar
adjudicatory proceeding (a " _Proceeding_ ") is commenced or threatened by any
party (the " _Claiming Party_ ") hereto to enforce its rights under this
Agreement against any other party (the " _Defending Party_ "), if the
Defending Party is the prevailing party in such Proceeding, all fees, costs
and expenses, including reasonable attorneys fees and court costs, incurred
by the Defending Party in such Proceeding shall be reimbursed by the Claiming
Party; provided, that if the Defending Party prevails in part, and loses in
part, in such Proceeding, the court, arbitrator or other adjudicator
presiding over such Proceeding shall award a reimbursement of the fees, costs
and expenses incurred by the Defending Party on an equitable basis. For
purposes hereof, and without limitation, the Defending Party shall be deemed
to have prevailed in any Proceeding described in the immediately preceding
sentence if the Claiming Party commences or threatens any such Proceeding and
(i) such underlying claim(s) are subsequently dropped or voluntarily
dismissed and/or (ii) the Defending Party defeats any such claim(s).
