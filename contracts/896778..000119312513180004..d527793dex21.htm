company (" _Parent_ "), Evelyn Acquisition Company, a Delaware corporation and
a wholly owned Subsidiary of Parent (" _Purchaser_ "), and Conceptus, Inc., a
Delaware corporation (the " _Company_ "). Each of Parent, Purchaser and the
Company are referred to herein as a " _Party_ " and together as the "
_Parties_ ". All capitalized terms used in this Agreement shall have the
meanings assigned to them in _Article IX_ or as otherwise defined elsewhere in
this Agreement unless the context clearly indicates otherwise.

 

WHEREAS, upon the terms and subject to the conditions of this Agreement,
Purchaser shall (and Parent shall cause Purchaser to) commence a tender offer
(such tender offer, as it may be extended, amended and supplemented from time
to time as permitted by this Agreement, the " _Offer_ ") to purchase all of
the outstanding shares of common stock of the Company, par value $0.003 per
share (" _Company Common Stock_ ") (which shares of Company Common Stock, are
hereinafter referred to as the " _Shares_ ") at a price of thirty-one dollars
($31.00) per Share, payable net to the holder thereof in cash, without
interest (such amount, or any different amount per Share that may be paid
pursuant to the Offer in accordance with the terms hereof, the " _Offer Price_
"), subject to any withholding of Taxes required by applicable Law; 

WHEREAS, following the consummation of the Offer, upon the terms and
conditions set forth in this Agreement, Purchaser will be merged with and
into the Company, with the Company as the surviving corporation in the merger
(the " _Merger_ "), and each issued and outstanding Share (other than Shares
to be cancelled pursuant to _Section 3.1(a)(ii)_ and other than Dissenting
Shares) will be converted into the right to receive the Offer Price, payable
net to the holder thereof in cash, without interest, subject to any
withholding of Taxes required by applicable Law;

 

WHEREAS, the respective boards of directors of Parent and Purchaser have each
unanimously (i) determined that it is in the best interests of their
respective stockholders for Parent to acquire the Company and (ii) approved
and declared advisable this Agreement and the transactions contemplated
hereby, including the Offer and the Merger, in each case on the terms
and subject to the conditions set forth in this Agreement; and

WHEREAS, the board of directors of the Company (the " _Company Board_ ") has
(i) (a) determined that each of this Agreement and the transactions
contemplated hereby, including the Offer and the Merger, is fair to, and in
the best interests of, the Company and the stockholders of the Company, (b)
approved and declared advisable this Agreement and the transactions
contemplated hereby, including the Offer and the Merger, on the terms and
subject to the conditions set forth herein, in accordance with the General
Corporation Law of the State of Delaware (the " _DGCL_ ") and (ii) resolved
to recommend that the holders of Shares (collectively, the " _Company
Stockholders_ ") accept the Offer, tender their Shares to Purchaser pursuant
to the Offer and, if required by the DGCL, adopt this Agreement on the terms
and subject to the conditions set forth herein. NOW, THEREFORE, in consideration of the foregoing and the respective
representations, warranties, covenants and agreements set forth in this
Agreement and intending to be legally bound hereby, the Parties hereby agree
as follows:

ARTICLE I

THE OFFER

 

Section 1.1 _The Offer_.

 

(a) _Commencement of the Offer_. Provided that this Agreement
shall not have been terminated pursuant to _Section 8.1 _or _Section 8.2_
hereof, and that none of the events set forth in clauses (A), (B), (D), (E),
(F) or (G) of _Annex A_ shall exist or have occurred and be continuing, as
promptly as practicable after the date hereof (but in no event more than ten
(10) Business Days thereafter) Purchaser shall, and Parent shall cause
Purchaser to, commence (within the meaning of Rule 14d-2 promulgated under
the Exchange Act) the Offer to purchase all of the outstanding Shares at a
price per Share equal to the Offer Price (as adjusted as provided in _Section
1.1(e)_, if applicable) and in compliance with Rule 14d-11 promulgated under
the Exchange Act and all other provisions of applicable securities Laws.

 

(b) _Terms and Conditions of the Offer_. The obligation of
Purchaser to accept for payment and to pay for any Shares tendered in the
Offer and not withdrawn (and the obligation of Parent to cause Purchaser to
accept for payment and to pay for any such Shares) shall be subject only to
the satisfaction or waiver of: 

(i) the condition that, prior to the then scheduled expiration time
of the Offer (the initial " _Expiration Date_ ", and any expiration
established pursuant to an extension of the Offer in accordance with _Section
1.1(c)_, also an " _Expiration Date_ ") there be validly tendered in
accordance with the terms of the Offer (without regard to Shares tendered
pursuant to guaranteed delivery procedures and not actually delivered prior to
the Expiration Date) and not withdrawn a number of Shares that, together with
the Shares then owned by Parent and each of the other Bayer Entities
(including Purchaser), represents at least a majority of the sum of (x) the
number of Shares then issued and outstanding plus (y) all Shares which the
Company may be required to issue upon the vesting (including vesting solely
as a result of the consummation of the Offer), conversion, settlement or
exercise of all then outstanding warrants, options, benefit plans, obligations
or securities convertible or exchangeable into Shares, or other rights to
acquire or be issued Shares (including all then outstanding Company Options,
Company Restricted Stock Units, Company Stock Appreciation Rights and Company
Convertible Notes (after giving effect to any Make-Whole Fundamental Change
(as defined in the Indenture), assuming the effectiveness thereof occurred on
the Expiration Date)) (the " _Minimum Condition_ "); and

 

(ii) the other conditions to acceptance for payment and payment for
any Shares tendered in the Offer set forth in _Annex A_ hereto.

 



2 The Minimum Condition and the other conditions to the Offer set forth in
_Annex A_  hereto are for the sole benefit of Parent and Purchaser and may be
asserted by Parent and Purchaser, regardless of the circumstances giving rise
to such condition, in whole or in part, at any time or from time to time, in
their sole discretion, and all such conditions (except for the Minimum
Condition, which may be waived by Parent and Purchaser only with the prior
written consent of the Company) may be waived by Parent and Purchaser, in
their sole discretion, in whole or in part at any time or from time to time,
in each case subject to the terms and conditions of this Agreement and the
applicable rules and regulations of the SEC. Parent and Purchaser expressly
reserve the right to increase the Offer Price or to waive or make any
other changes to the terms and conditions of the Offer; _provided_ ,
_however_ , that unless previously approved by the Company in writing, neither
Parent nor Purchaser may take any action or make any change to the terms or
conditions of the Offer that:

(A) decreases the Offer Price,

 

(B) changes the form of consideration to be paid in the Offer,

 

(C) reduces the maximum number of Shares sought to be purchased in the
Offer, 

(D) imposes conditions to the Offer in addition to the conditions to
the Offer set forth in _Annex A_ hereto or amends or modifies any of the
conditions set forth in such _Annex A_ in any manner adverse to the holders of
Shares,

 

(E) extends the Expiration Date other than in a manner pursuant to,
and in accordance with, _Section 1.1(c) _or

(F) amends or waives the Minimum Condition or amends any material
terms of the Offer other than those specified in clauses (A) through (E) of
this proviso in a manner materially adverse to the Company Stockholders as a
whole.

 

(c) _Expiration and Extension of the Offer_.

 

(i) Subject to the terms and conditions of this Agreement and
the Offer, the Offer shall initially be scheduled to expire at midnight, New
York City time, on the date that is twenty (20) Business Days (for this
purpose calculated in accordance with Rule 14d-1(g)(3) promulgated under the
Exchange Act) after the date the Offer is commenced (within the meaning of
Rule 14d-2 promulgated under the Exchange Act).

 



3 (ii) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in the foregoing clause
(i) of this _Section 1.1(c) _or elsewhere in this Agreement:

(A) Purchaser shall extend the Offer for the minimum period required by
any Law or any rule, regulation, interpretation or position of the SEC or its
staff or the Nasdaq that is applicable to the Offer; and

(B) in the event that the Minimum Condition or any of the other
conditions to acceptance for payment and payment for any Shares tendered in
the Offer set forth on _Annex A _hereto shall not have been satisfied as of
the latest scheduled Expiration Date (and such conditions have not been
waived by Parent and Purchaser in accordance with the terms hereof), Purchaser
shall extend the Offer for successive extension periods of up to ten (10)
Business Days each until the End Date, the length of such periods to be
determined by Parent.

(iii) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in the foregoing clauses
(i) and (ii) of this _Section 1.1(c) _or elsewhere in this Agreement, in no
event shall Purchaser be required to extend the Offer beyond the End Date.

 

(iv) Nothing in this _Section 1.1(c) _shall be deemed to impair, limit
or otherwise restrict in any manner the right of Parent or the Company to
terminate this Agreement pursuant to _Section 8.1_ or _Section 8.2_ hereof.
Purchaser shall not terminate the Offer prior to the End Date without
the prior written consent of the Company, except in the event that this
Agreement has been terminated by Parent or the Company in accordance with
_Section 8.1_ or _Section 8.2_ hereof. If the Agreement is terminated by
Parent or the Company in accordance with _Section 8.1_ or _Section 8.2_
hereof, Purchaser shall (and Parent shall cause Purchaser to) promptly (and in
any event within one Business Day of such termination) irrevocably and
unconditionally terminate the Offer.

(v) In accordance with  _Section 1.1(f)_ hereof, Purchaser may, in
its discretion (and without the consent of the Company or any other Person),
elect to provide for a subsequent offering period (and one or more consecutive
extensions thereof).

 

(vi) In the event that the Offer is terminated or withdrawn in
accordance with the terms of this Agreement, and Purchaser has not accepted
for payment the Shares tendered in the Offer, Purchaser shall, and shall cause
any depositary acting on behalf of Purchaser to, promptly return all Shares
deposited by or on behalf of Company Stockholders in compliance with Rule
14e-1(c) promulgated under the Exchange Act.

 



4 (d) _Payment for Tendered Shares_. Subject to the satisfaction of the
Minimum Condition and the satisfaction or waiver by Parent or Purchaser of the
other conditions set forth in _Annex A_ , Purchaser shall accept for payment
and pay for all Shares validly tendered and not withdrawn pursuant to the
Offer promptly after the Expiration Date (as it may be extended in accordance
with _Section 1.1(c)_ hereof) and in any event in compliance with Rule
14e-1(c) promulgated under the Exchange Act. The Offer Price payable in
respect of each Share validly tendered and not withdrawn pursuant to the Offer
or any subsequent offering period contemplated by _Section 1.1(f)_ hereof
shall be paid net to the holder thereof in cash or immediately available
funds. Parent shall provide, or cause to be provided to Purchaser, on a timely
basis, the funds necessary to pay for any Shares that Purchaser accepts or is
obligated to accept for payment pursuant to the Offer, and shall cause
Purchaser to fulfill all of its obligations under this Agreement.

 

(e) _Adjustments to Offer Price_. The Offer Price shall be
adjusted appropriately and proportionately to reflect the effect of any stock
split, reverse stock split, stock dividend (including any dividend or
distribution of securities convertible into Company Common Stock),
reorganization, recapitalization, reclassification, combination, exchange of
shares or other like change with respect to Company Common Stock occurring on
or after the date hereof and at or prior to the Acceptance Time, and such
adjustment to the Offer Price shall provide to the holders of Company Common
Stock the same economic effect as contemplated by this Agreement prior to such
action; _provided_ that nothing in this _Section 1.1(e)_ shall be construed
to permit the Company to take any action with respect to its securities that
is prohibited by the terms of this Agreement.

 

(f) _Subsequent Offering Period_. Purchaser may, and the
Offer Documents (as defined below) shall reserve the right of Purchaser to,
provide for a subsequent offering period (within the meaning of Rule 14d-11
promulgated under the Exchange Act) in compliance with Rule 14d-11 promulgated
under the Exchange Act and all other provisions of applicable securities Laws
(a " _Subsequent Offering Period_ ") of not less than three (3) nor more than
twenty (20) Business Days (for this purpose calculated in accordance with Rule
14d-1(g)(3) promulgated under the Exchange Act) immediately following the
Expiration Date. On the terms and subject to the conditions set forth in this
Agreement and the Offer, Parent shall cause Purchaser to, and Purchaser shall,
accept for payment and pay for all Shares validly tendered and not withdrawn
pursuant to the Offer as so extended by such Subsequent Offering Period
promptly after any such Shares are tendered during such Subsequent Offering
Period and in any event in compliance with Rule 14e-1(c) promulgated under
the Exchange Act.

(g) _Schedule TO; Offer Documents_. As soon as practicable on the
date the Offer is commenced (within the meaning of Rule 14d-2 promulgated
under the Exchange Act), Parent and Purchaser shall: (i) file with the SEC, in
accordance with Rule 14d-3 under the Exchange Act, a Tender Offer Statement
on Schedule TO

 



5  (together with all amendments and supplements thereto, and including all
exhibits thereto, the " _Schedule TO_ ") with respect to the Offer, which
shall contain as an exhibit or incorporate by reference an offer to purchase
(the " _Offer to Purchase_ "), and forms of the related letter of transmittal
and summary advertisement, if any, in respect of the Offer, and such other
ancillary documents and instruments pursuant to which the Offer will be made
or which are required to be filed in connection with the filing of the
Schedule TO (collectively, together with any supplements or amendments
thereto, the " _Offer Documents_ "); and (ii) cause the Offer Documents to be
disseminated to the Company Stockholders as and to the extent required by the
Exchange Act. The Company hereby consents to the inclusion in the Offer
Documents of the Company Board Recommendation to the extent that the Company
Board Recommendation has not been withheld, withdrawn, amended or modified in
accordance with _Section 6.2_ hereof. The Company shall promptly furnish to
Parent and Purchaser upon request all information concerning the Company that
may be required by applicable securities Laws or reasonably requested for
inclusion in the Schedule TO and the Offer Documents. Parent and Purchaser
shall cause the Schedule TO and the Offer Documents to comply in all
material respects with the Exchange Act and all other applicable Laws. Each
of Parent, Purchaser and the Company shall promptly correct any information
provided by it for use in the Schedule TO or the Offer Documents if and to the
extent that such information shall have become false or misleading in any
material respect. Parent and Purchaser shall take all steps necessary to cause
the Schedule TO and the Offer Documents, as so corrected, to be filed with the
SEC and the Offer Documents, as so corrected, to be disseminated to the
Company Stockholders, in each case as and to the extent required by applicable
Laws. Parent and Purchaser shall provide the Company and its counsel
reasonable opportunity to review and comment on the Schedule TO and the Offer
Documents and any amendments or supplements thereto, in any case prior to the
filing thereof with the SEC, and Parent and Purchaser shall give reasonable
and good faith consideration to any comment made by the Company or its
counsel. Parent and Purchaser shall provide to the Company and its counsel
any and all written comments (and summaries of all oral comments) that Parent,
Purchaser or their counsel may receive from the SEC or its staff with respect
to the Schedule TO and the Offer Documents promptly after receipt thereof,
and Parent and Purchaser shall provide the Company and its counsel a
reasonable opportunity to participate in the formulation of any response to
any such comments of the SEC or its staff and a reasonable opportunity to
participate in any discussions with the SEC or its staff concerning such
comments. Notwithstanding the foregoing, Parent and Purchaser shall not be
required to provide the Company the opportunity to review or comment on
(or include comments proposed by the Company in) or permit the Company to
participate in any discussions regarding the Schedule TO or the Offer
Documents, or any amendment or supplement thereto, or any comments thereon, to
the extent relating to any action that may be taken by the Company or the
Company Board pursuant to _Section 6.2_, any action that may be taken by
Parent or Purchaser in connection therewith, or the reasons for any such
actions.

the Schedule TO is first filed with the SEC, the Company shall (i) file with
the SEC a Solicitation/Recommendation Statement on Schedule 14D-9 (together
with all amendments and supplements thereto, and including all exhibits
thereto, the " _Schedule 14D-9_"); _provided_ , that the Company shall not
be required to file such Schedule 14D-9 prior to May 7, 2013, and (ii) cause
the Schedule 14D-9 to be disseminated to the Company Stockholders with
the Offer Documents as and to the extent required by the Exchange Act (and
the expense of such dissemination shall be borne by Parent in connection with
its dissemination of the Offer Documents). Except to the extent the Company
Board shall have effected a Company Adverse Recommendation Change in
compliance with _Section 6.2(d)_, the Schedule 14D-9 shall include the
Company Board Recommendation. Each of Parent and Purchaser shall promptly
furnish to the Company upon request all information concerning Parent and
Purchaser that may be required by applicable securities Laws or reasonably
requested for inclusion in the Schedule 14D-9. The Company shall cause the
Schedule 14D-9 to comply in all material respects with the Exchange Act and
all other applicable Laws. Each of the Company, Parent and Purchaser shall
promptly correct any information provided by it for use in the Schedule 14D-9
if and to the extent that such information shall have become false
or misleading in any material respect. The Company shall take all steps
necessary to cause the Schedule 14D-9, as so corrected, to be filed with the
SEC and disseminated to the Company Stockholders, in each case as and to the
extent required by applicable securities Laws. The Company shall provide
Parent, Purchaser and their counsel reasonable opportunity to review and
comment on the Schedule 14D-9 and any amendments or supplements thereto
required to be filed with the SEC pursuant to Rule 14D-9 promulgated under
the Exchange Act, in any case prior to the filing thereof with the SEC, and
the Company shall give reasonable and good faith consideration to any comment
made by Parent, Purchaser or their counsel. The Company shall provide to

thereof, and the Company shall provide Parent, Purchaser and their counsel a
reasonable opportunity to participate in the formulation of any response to
any such comments of the SEC or its staff and a reasonable opportunity to
participate in any discussions with the SEC or its staff concerning such
comments. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Company shall not be required to
provide Parent or Purchaser the opportunity to review or comment on (or
include comments proposed by Parent or Purchaser in) or permit Parent or
Purchaser to participate in any discussions regarding the Schedule 14D-9, or
any amendment or supplement thereto, or any comments thereon, to the extent
relating to any action that may be taken by the Company or the Company Board
permitted by _Section 6.2_, any action that may be taken by Parent or
Purchaser in connection therewith, or the reasons for any such actions.

 



7 (b) _Company Information_. In connection with the Offer, the Company
shall, or shall cause its transfer agent to, promptly following a request by
Parent, furnish Parent, at Parents cost and expense, with such information as
Parent or its Representatives may reasonably request in order to disseminate
and otherwise communicate the Offer to the record and beneficial holders of
Shares, including a list, as of the most recent practicable date, of the
Company Stockholders, mailing labels and any available listing or computer
files containing the names and addresses of all record and beneficial holders
of Shares, and lists of security positions of Shares held in stock
depositories (including updated lists of holders of Shares, mailing labels,
listings or files of securities positions). Subject to any and all applicable
Laws, and except for such steps as are necessary to disseminate the Offer
Documents and any other documents necessary to consummate the Offer and the
Merger, Parent and Purchaser shall (and shall cause their respective
Representatives to):

 

(i) hold in confidence the information contained in any such lists of
holders of Shares, mailing labels and listings or files of securities
positions on the terms and subject to the conditions set forth in the
Confidentiality Agreement;

 

(ii) use such information only in connection with the Offer and
the Merger; and

(iii) if (A) this Agreement shall be terminated pursuant to _Section
8.1 _or _Section 8.2_ hereof and/or (B) the Offer shall terminate without any
Shares having been accepted, deliver, and cause their Representatives to
deliver, to the Company (or destroy and certify such destruction in writing
to the Company) any and all copies and any extracts or summaries from such
information then in their possession or under their control.

Section 1.3 _Top-Up Option_.

(a) The Company grants to Purchaser an irrevocable option (the " _Top-
Up Option_ "), exercisable only upon the terms and conditions set forth
in this _Section 1.3_, to purchase from the Company at a price per Share
equal to the Offer Price up to the number of newly-issued Shares equal to the
lesser of (i) the number of Shares that, when added to the number of Shares
owned by Parent and each of the other Bayer Entities at the time of exercise
of the Top-Up Option, constitutes one Share more than 90% of the total Shares
then outstanding (determined on a fully-diluted basis (x) after giving effect
to the issuance of the Shares pursuant to the exercise of the Top-Up Option,
(y) including all Shares which the Company may be required to issue upon the
vesting (including vesting solely as a result of the consummation of the
Offer), conversion, settlement or exercise of all then outstanding warrants,
options, benefit plans, obligations or securities convertible or exchangeable
into Shares, or other rights to acquire or be issued Shares (including all
then outstanding Company Options, Company Restricted Stock Units, Company
Stock

 



8  Appreciation Rights and Company Convertible Notes (after giving effect to
any Make-Whole Fundamental Change (as defined in the Indenture), assuming the
effectiveness thereof occurred on the Expiration Date)), regardless of the
conversion or exercise price or other terms and conditions thereof and (z)
excluding from Parents and its Subsidiaries ownership, but not from the
number of outstanding Shares, Shares tendered pursuant to guaranteed delivery
procedures that have not yet then been delivered in settlement or satisfaction
of such guarantee), and (ii) the aggregate number of Shares that the Company
is authorized to issue under the Company Certificate of Incorporation but
that are not issued and outstanding or reserved for issuance upon the
conversion of the Company Convertible Notes at the time of exercise of the
Top-Up Option. The Top-Up Option shall expire upon the earlier to occur
of (i) the Effective Time and (ii) termination of this Agreement in
accordance with its terms.

 

(b) The Top-Up Option may be exercised by Purchaser on one or
more occasions at any time following the Acceptance Time and prior to the
earlier to occur of (x) the Effective Time and (y) the termination of this
Agreement pursuant to _Section 8.2_ hereof; _provided_ , _however_ , that
the Top-Up Option shall not be exercisable unless Purchaser reasonably
believes that immediately after such exercise and the issuance of Shares
pursuant thereto, the Short-Form Threshold shall be reached. Upon Parents
request, the Company shall cause its transfer agent to certify in writing to
Parent the number of Shares issued and outstanding as of immediately prior to
the exercise of the Top-Up Option and after giving effect to the issuance of
the Shares pursuant to the Top-Up Option. The aggregate purchase price
payable for the Shares being purchased by Purchaser pursuant to the Top-Up
Option shall be determined by multiplying the number of such Shares by the
Offer Price. Such purchase price may be paid by Purchaser, at its election,
either (i) entirely in cash, or (ii) in cash in an amount not less than the
aggregate par value of the Shares to be issued upon exercise of the Top-Up
Option plus a promissory note, with full recourse to Parent and
executed jointly by Parent and Purchaser, having a principal amount equal to
the balance of such purchase price, or any combination of the foregoing. Any
such promissory note shall be on the following terms and shall have no other
material terms: (i) the principal amount and any accrued but unpaid interest
under the promissory note shall be payable upon the demand of the Company,
(ii) the unpaid principal amount of the promissory note will accrue simple
interest at the per annum rate of three percent (3.0%) and (iii) the
promissory note may be prepaid in whole or in part at any time and from time
to time, without premium or penalty or prior notice.

 

(c) Each time Purchaser exercises the Top-Up Option, Parent or
Purchaser shall deliver to the Company a notice setting forth (i) the number
of Shares that Purchaser intends to purchase pursuant to the Top-Up Option,
(ii) the manner in which Purchaser intends to pay the applicable exercise
price and (iii) the place and time at which the closing of the purchase of
such Shares by Purchaser is to take place. At the closing of the purchase of
such Shares, Purchaser shall cause to be delivered to the Company the
consideration required to be delivered in exchange for such Shares in

 



9  a form provided in _Section 1.3(b)_, and the Company shall cause to be
issued to Purchaser a certificate representing such Shares (or, if the Company
does not then issue Shares in certificated form, the applicable number of
Shares in non-certificated book-entry form). Such certificates may include any
legends that are required by applicable Law. Parent and Purchaser acknowledge
that the Shares which Purchaser may acquire upon exercise of the Top-Up
Option shall not be registered under the Securities Act, and shall be issued
in reliance upon an exemption for transactions not involving a public
offering. Parent and Purchaser agree that the Top-Up Option, and the Shares
to be acquired upon exercise of the Top-Up Option, if any, are being and
shall be acquired by Purchaser for the purpose of investment and not with a
view to, or for resale in connection with, any distribution thereof (within
the meaning of the Securities Act).

Section 1.4 _Company Board and Company Board Committees_. 

(a) _Composition of Company Board and Board Committees_. Effective
upon the initial acceptance for payment by Purchaser of Shares tendered
pursuant to the Offer (the " _Acceptance Time_ ," the use of which term herein
shall not, unless the context otherwise requires, depend upon whether Parent
shall exercise its rights under this _Section 1.4(a)_) and from time to time
thereafter up to the Effective Time, subject to payment for such Shares,
Parent shall be entitled to designate such number of directors on the
Company Board equal to the product (rounded up to the next whole number)
obtained by multiplying (i) the number of directors on the Company Board
(giving effect to any increase in the number of directors pursuant to this
_Section 1.4(a)_) and (ii) a fraction, the numerator of which is the number
of Shares then beneficially owned by Parent and each of the other Bayer
Entities (after giving effect to the Shares purchased pursuant to the Offer
and, if the Top-Up Option is exercised, the Shares purchased upon the
exercise of the Top-Up Option), and the denominator of which is the total
number of then outstanding Shares, and Parent shall be entitled to have such
designees be elected or appointed to such classes of the Company Board so as
to be as evenly distributed as possible among the three classes of directors
on the Company Board. Promptly following a request by Parent, the Company and
the Company Board shall cause the individuals so designated by Parent to
be elected or appointed to the Company Board, including by filling vacancies,
by increasing the size of the Company Board (and amending the Company Bylaws
in order to promptly effect such increase), and by seeking and accepting or
otherwise securing the resignations of such number of then incumbent
directors as is necessary to enable the individuals so designated by Parent to
be elected or appointed to the Company Board (the date on which the majority
of the Companys directors are designees of Parent that have been effectively
elected or appointed to the Company Board in accordance herewith, the " _Board
Appointment Date_ "). From time to time after the Acceptance Time, subject to
_Section 1.4(c)_, following a request by Parent, the Company shall take all
action necessary to cause the individuals so designated by Parent to
constitute substantially the same percentage (rounding up) of the members of
each committee of the Company Board as the percentage that such designated
directors

 



10  represent of the Company Board, in each case to the fullest extent permitted
by all applicable Laws, including the rules of the Nasdaq. Solely for the
purposes of this _Section 1.4_, any and all members of the Company Board
immediately prior to such initial designations by Parent who remain on the
Company Board after the election or appointment of such directors designated
by Parent shall be referred to as " _Continuing Directors_." Prior to the
Effective Time, the Company Board shall always have at least three (3)
Continuing Directors, each of whom shall be an "independent director" within
the meaning of Listing Rule 5605(a)(2) of the Nasdaq Listing Rules and
eligible to serve on the Companys audit committee under the Exchange Act and
Nasdaq rules and, at least one of whom shall be an "audit committee financial
expert" as defined in Item 407(d)(5) of Regulation S-K and the instructions
thereto. If the number of directors who are Continuing Directors is reduced
below three (3) prior to the Effective Time, the remaining Continuing
Director(s) shall be entitled to designate an individual meeting
the foregoing criteria and who is not a current or former officer, director,
employee or consultant of Parent or any of its Subsidiaries (a " _Parent
Insider_ ") to fill each such vacancy and who shall be deemed a Continuing
Director for all purposes of this Agreement, and the Company shall cause such
designee to be appointed to the Company Board. If, notwithstanding compliance
with the foregoing provisions, the number of Continuing Directors is reduced
to zero (0), then the other directors on the Company Board shall designate
and appoint to the Company Board three (3) directors who meet the foregoing
criteria and who are not Parent Insiders who shall be deemed Continuing
Directors for all purposes of this Agreement. From and after the Acceptance
Time and for so long as any individual who is a member of the Company Board or
an officer of the Company prior to the Acceptance Time, remains a member of
the Company Board or an officer of the Company, respectively, following the
Acceptance Time, Parent shall ensure that each such director and officer of
the Company who is not then covered by the Companys directors and officers
liability insurance policies is covered by, and a beneficiary of, Parents
directors and officers liability insurance policies (or equivalent insurance
policies).

(b) _Required Approvals of Continuing Directors_. Notwithstanding
anything to the contrary set forth in this Agreement, in the event that
Parents designees are elected or appointed to the Company Board prior to the
Effective Time pursuant to _Section 1.4(a)_ hereof, the prior approval of a
majority of the Continuing Directors (or the approval of the sole Continuing
Director if there shall only be one (1) Continuing Director then in office)
shall be required in order to, prior to the Effective Time, (i) amend, modify
or terminate this Agreement, or agree or consent to any amendment,
modification or termination of this Agreement, in any case on behalf of the
Company, (ii) extend the time for performance of, or waive, any of the
obligations or other acts of Parent or Purchaser under this Agreement, (iii)
exercise or waive any of the Companys rights or remedies under this
Agreement, (iv) amend or otherwise modify the Company Certificate of
Incorporation or Company Bylaws, or (v) authorize or execute any Contract, or
any amendment or modification of any Contract, between the Company or any
Company Subsidiary, on the one hand, and

 



11  Parent, Purchaser or any of their Affiliates on the other hand, or the
termination of any such agreement then in effect by the Company or any such
Company Subsidiary. Following the election or appointment of Parents
designees pursuant to _Section 1.4(a)_, and prior to the Effective Time, any
actions with respect to the enforcement of this Agreement by the Company shall
be effected only by and at the direction of a majority of the Continuing
Directors (or the action of the sole Continuing Director if there shall only
be one (1) Continuing Director then in office), and any such authorization or
direction shall constitute the authorization and direction of the
full Company Board with respect thereto, and no other action on the part of
the Company, including any action by any other director of the Company, shall
be required to authorize, or for the Company to take, any such action. For
purposes of considering any matter set forth in this _Section 1.4(b)_, the
Continuing Directors shall be permitted to meet without the presence of the
other directors. The Continuing Directors shall have, and Parent shall cause
the Continuing Directors to have, the authority to retain such counsel (which
may include current counsel to the Company or the Company Board) and other
advisors at the expense of the Company as determined by the Continuing
Directors, and the authority, after the Acceptance Time but not on or after
the Effective Time, to institute any action on behalf of the Company to
enforce performance of this Agreement.

(c) _Continued Listing_. In the event that Parents designees are
elected or appointed to the Company Board pursuant to _Section 1.4(a)_, and
without limiting _Section 1.4(a)_, until the Effective Time, the Company
Board shall have at least such number of directors as may be required by the
rules of the Nasdaq or the federal securities Laws who are considered
independent directors within the meaning of such Laws (" _Independent
Directors_ "); _provided_ , _however_ , that after the Acceptance Time,
subject to payment by Purchaser for Shares tendered pursuant to the Offer, the
Company shall, upon Parents request, take all action necessary to elect to
be treated as a " _Controlled Company_ " for purposes of Listing Rule 5615(c)
of the Nasdaq rules (or any successor provision) and make all necessary
filings and disclosures associated with such status; _provided_ , _further_ ,
that in the event the number of Independent Directors shall be reduced below
the number of directors as may be required by such Laws for any reason
whatsoever, the remaining Independent Director(s) shall be entitled to
designate persons to fill such vacancies who shall be deemed to be Independent
Directors for purposes of this Agreement or, if no other Independent Director
then remains, the other directors shall designate such number of directors as
may be required by the rules of the Nasdaq or the federal securities Laws, to
fill such vacancies who shall not be Parent Insiders, and such Persons shall
be deemed to be Independent Directors for purposes of this Agreement. 

(d) _Section 14(f) of the Exchange Act_. The Companys obligation to
appoint Parents designees to the Company Board pursuant to _Section 1.4(a)_
hereof shall be subject to Section 14(f) of the Exchange Act and Rule 14f-1
promulgated thereunder. The Company shall promptly take all action required
pursuant to this _Section 1.4 _and Section 14(f) of the Exchange Act and Rule
14f-1 promulgated

 



12  thereunder in order to fulfill its obligations under this _Section 1.4_,
and shall include in the Schedule 14D-9 such information with respect to the
Company and its directors and officers as is required under Section 14(f) of
the Exchange Act and Rule 14f-1 promulgated thereunder in order to fulfill its
obligations under this _Section 1.4_. Parent shall, at least one (1) Business
Day prior to the commencement of the Offer, provide to the Company in
writing, and be responsible for, any information with respect to itself and
its nominees, directors, officers and Affiliates, required by Section 14(f) of
the Exchange Act and Rule 14f-1 promulgated thereunder. The provisions of
this _Section 1.4 _are in addition to, and shall not limit, any right that
Purchaser, Parent or any Affiliate of Purchaser or Parent may have (with
respect to the election of directors or otherwise) under applicable Laws as a
holder or beneficial owner of shares of Company Common Stock.

ARTICLE III

 

CONVERSION OF SECURITIES; EXCHANGE OF CERTIFICATES

Section 3.1 _Conversion of Securities_.

(a) At the Effective Time, by virtue of the Merger and without any
action on the part of Parent, Purchaser, the Company or their respective
stockholders: 

(i) _Conversion Generally_. Each Share issued and outstanding
immediately prior to the Effective Time (other than (i) any Shares to be
cancelled pursuant to _Section 3.1(a)(ii)_, and (ii) Dissenting Shares) shall
be converted, subject to _Section 3.1(b)_, into the right to receive an
amount in cash equal to the Offer Price (the " _Merger Consideration_ "),
payable to the holder thereof, without interest, subject to any withholding
Taxes required by applicable Law in accordance with  _Section 3.8_ upon
surrender of the Certificates in accordance with _Section 3.2(b)_. At the
Effective Time, all such Shares shall cease to be outstanding and shall
automatically be cancelled and retired and shall cease to exist, and each
Certificate which immediately prior to the Effective Time represented any such
Shares shall thereafter represent only the right to receive the Merger
Consideration therefor.

 

(ii) _Cancellation of Certain Shares_. Each Share held by Parent
or any of its Subsidiaries, including Purchaser, or in the treasury of the
Company immediately prior to the Effective Time shall be cancelled and
extinguished without any conversion thereof and no payment shall be made with
respect thereto.

  



14 (iii) _Purchaser_. Each share of common stock, par value $0.003 per
share, of Purchaser issued and outstanding immediately prior to the Effective
Time shall be cancelled and converted into one (1) newly and validly issued,
fully paid and nonassessable share of common stock of the Surviving
Corporation.

(b) _Change in Shares_. Without duplication of any adjustment made
pursuant to _Section 1.1(e)_, the Merger Consideration shall be adjusted
appropriately and proportionately to reflect the effect of any stock split,
reverse stock split, stock dividend (including any dividend or distribution
of securities convertible into Company Common Stock), reorganization,
recapitalization, reclassification, combination, exchange of shares or other
like change with respect to Company Common Stock, occurring or with a record
date, on or after the date hereof and prior to the Effective Time, and such
adjustment to the Merger Consideration shall provide to the holders of Company
Common Stock the same economic effect as contemplated by this Agreement prior
to such action.

Section 3.2 _Exchange of Certificates_.

 

(a) _Paying Agent_. At the Closing, Parent shall deposit, or
shall cause to be deposited, with a bank or trust company designated by
Parent and reasonably satisfactory to the Company (the " _Paying Agent_ "),
for the benefit of the holders of Shares, for exchange in accordance with this
_Article III_ , cash in U.S. dollars in an amount sufficient to pay the
aggregate amount of the Merger Consideration payable in connection with the
Merger (such cash, the " _Exchange Fund_ ") pursuant to _Section 3.1_ in
exchange for outstanding Shares. The Paying Agent shall, and Parent shall
cause the Paying Agent to, deliver the Merger Consideration contemplated to be
paid pursuant to _Section 3.1 _out of the Exchange Fund. The Exchange Fund
shall be invested by the Paying Agent as directed by Parent; _provided_ ,
_however_ , that: (i) no such investment or losses thereon shall affect the
Merger Consideration payable to the holders of Shares; and (ii) such
investments shall be in obligations of or guaranteed by the United States of
America or any agency or instrumentality thereof and backed by the full faith
and credit of the United States of America, in commercial paper obligations
rated A-1 or P-1 or better by Moodys Investors Service, Inc. or Standard and
Poors Corporation, respectively, or in certificates of deposit, bank
repurchase agreements or bankers acceptances of commercial banks with capital
exceeding $10 billion (based on the most recent financial statements of such
bank that are then publicly available). Any net profit resulting from, or
interest or income produced by, such investments shall be payable to Parent,
and any amounts in excess of the amounts payable pursuant to  _Section 3.1
_shall be promptly returned to Parent. In the event that the Exchange Fund
shall be insufficient to pay the aggregate Merger Consideration payable in
connection with the Merger, Parent shall promptly deposit or cause to
be deposited additional funds in the amount of such insufficiency. The
Exchange Fund shall not be used for any other purpose.

 



15 (b) _Exchange Procedures_. Promptly following the Effective Time (but
in no event later than three (3) Business Days following the Effective Time),
Parent shall cause the Paying Agent to mail to each holder of record of a
certificate or certificates which immediately prior to the Effective Time
represented outstanding Shares (the " _Certificates_ ," it being understood
that any references herein to " _Certificates_ " shall be deemed to include
references to book-entry account statements relating to the ownership of
Shares) and whose Shares have been converted into the right to receive Merger
Consideration pursuant to _Section 3.1_ (i) a letter of transmittal in
customary form (which shall specify that delivery shall be effected, and risk
of loss and title to the Certificates shall pass, only upon proper delivery of
the Certificates to the Paying Agent and which shall include customary
provisions with respect to delivery of an "agents message" with respect to
Shares held in book-entry form) and (ii) instructions for use in effecting the
surrender of the Certificates in exchange for the Merger Consideration. Upon
surrender of a Certificate for cancellation to the Paying Agent together with
such letter of transmittal, properly completed and duly executed, and such
other customary documents as may be reasonably required pursuant to such
instructions (or, if Shares are held in book-entry or other uncertificated
form, upon the entry through a book-entry transfer agent of the surrender of
such Shares on a book-entry account statement), the holder of such Certificate
shall be entitled to receive in exchange therefor the Merger Consideration
which such holder has the right to receive in respect of the Shares formerly
represented by such Certificate, and the Certificate so surrendered shall
forthwith be cancelled. No interest will be paid or accrued on any
Merger Consideration payable to holders of Certificates. In the event of a
transfer of ownership of Shares which is not registered in the transfer
records of the Company, the Merger Consideration may be issued to a transferee
if the Certificate representing such Shares is presented to the Paying Agent,
accompanied by all documents required to evidence and effect such transfer and
by evidence that any applicable stock transfer Taxes have been paid. Until
surrendered as contemplated by this  _Section 3.2_, and subject to _Section
3.4_, each Certificate shall be deemed at any time after the Effective Time to
represent only the right to receive upon such surrender the Merger
Consideration in cash as contemplated by this Agreement, without interest
thereon.

(c) _Lost Certificates_. If any Certificate shall have been lost,
stolen or destroyed, upon the making of an affidavit of that fact by the
Person claiming such Certificate to be lost, stolen or destroyed and, if
required by Parent, the posting by such Person of a bond, in such reasonable
and customary amount as Parent may direct, as indemnity against any claim that
may be made against it with respect to such lost, stolen or destroyed
Certificate, the Paying Agent will (subject to compliance with the exchange
procedures of _Section 3.2(b))_, and Parent shall cause the Paying Agent to,
issue in exchange for such lost, stolen or destroyed Certificate the Merger
Consideration, without any interest thereon.

 

(d) _Further Rights in Company Common Stock_. All
Merger Consideration paid in accordance with the terms hereof shall be deemed
to have been issued in full satisfaction of all rights pertaining to such
Shares.

 



16 (e) _No Further Dividends_. No dividends or other distributions with
respect to capital stock of the Surviving Corporation with a record date on or
after the Effective Time shall be paid to the holder of any unsurrendered
Certificates.

 

(f) _Termination of Exchange Fund_. Any portion of the Exchange
Fund which remains undistributed to the holders of Company Common Stock for
twelve (12) months after the Effective Time shall be delivered to Parent upon
demand, and any holders of Company Common Stock who have not theretofore
complied with this  _Article III_ shall thereafter look only to Parent for
the Merger Consideration without any interest thereon.

(g) _No Liability_. None of Parent, the Company or the Surviving
Corporation shall be liable to any holder of Shares for any cash from the
Exchange Fund delivered to a public official pursuant to any abandoned
property, escheat or similar Law.

 

Section 3.3 _Stock Transfer Books_. At the Effective Time, the stock
transfer books of the Company shall be closed (after giving effect to the
items contemplated by this _Article III_ ) and thereafter there shall be no
further registration of transfers of Shares outstanding immediately prior to
the Effective Time on the records of the Company. From and after the
Effective Time, the holders of Certificates shall cease to have any rights
with respect to such Shares except to receive the Merger Consideration
therefor and as otherwise provided herein or by Law. If, after the Effective
Time, any Certificate is presented to the Surviving Corporation, Parent or the
Paying Agent for transfer, it shall (subject to compliance with the exchange
procedures of _Section 3.2(b)_) be cancelled and exchanged for the
cash amount in immediately available funds to which the holder thereof is
entitled pursuant to this _Article III_.

 

Section 3.4 _Dissenting Shares_. Notwithstanding anything in this
Agreement to the contrary, any Shares that are issued and outstanding
immediately prior to the Effective Time and are held by a stockholder (each, a
" _Dissenting Stockholder_ ") who is entitled to exercise, and properly
exercises, appraisal rights with respect to such Shares pursuant to, and who
complies in all respects with, the provisions of Section 262 of the DGCL in
order to perfect such demand (collectively, the " _Dissenting Shares_ ") shall
not be converted into or exchangeable for or represent the right to receive
the Merger Consideration (except as provided in this _Section 3.4_) and shall
entitle such Dissenting Stockholder only to payment for such Dissenting Shares
in accordance with and to the extent provided by Section 262 of the DGCL,
unless and until such Dissenting Stockholder fails to perfect or otherwise
waives, withdraws or effectively loses the right to appraisal under Section
262 of the DGCL. If any Dissenting Stockholder fails to perfect or otherwise
waives, withdraws or effectively loses the right to appraisal under Section
262 of the DGCL, then as of the later of the Effective Time and the occurrence
of such event, the Dissenting Shares held by such Dissenting Stockholder
shall be cancelled and converted into and represent the right only to receive
the Merger Consideration, without interest, pursuant to _Section 3.1_. The
Company shall not, except with the prior written consent of Parent,
voluntarily make (or cause or permit to be made on its behalf) any payment
with respect to, or settle or offer to settle, or otherwise negotiate with,

 



17  any Dissenting Stockholder regarding its exercise of appraisal rights prior
to the Effective Time. The Company shall give Parent prompt notice of any such
demands prior to the Effective Time, and Parent shall have the right to
direct all negotiations and proceedings with respect to any exercise by any
Company Stockholder of appraisal rights. For the avoidance of doubt, it is
acknowledged and agreed that, for all purposes under Section 262 of the DGCL
and to the fullest extent permitted by applicable Law, the fair value of the
Dissenting Shares shall be determined without regard to the Top-Up Option,
including any Shares issued pursuant to the Top-Up Option, or any promissory
note or other consideration delivered by Parent or Purchaser to the Company in
payment for the Shares issued pursuant to the Top-Up Option.

Section 3.5 _Treatment of Equity Awards; Company Stock Plans_.

(a) _Company Options and Company Stock Appreciation Rights_. At the
Effective Time, each outstanding Company Option and Company Stock Appreciation

or forward-looking in nature that are contained therein) and (b) such
exceptions as are disclosed in the Company Disclosure Schedule delivered by
the Company to Parent prior to the execution and delivery of this Agreement,
the Company represents and warrants to Parent and Purchaser as follows:

Section 4.1 _Organization and Qualification_.

 

(a) The Company is a corporation duly organized, validly existing and
in good standing under the Laws of the State of Delaware. The Company has all
requisite corporate power and authority to own, lease and operate its
properties and assets and to carry on its business as presently conducted. The
Company is duly qualified or licensed to do business and, where such concept
is recognized, is in good standing, in each jurisdiction where the character
of the properties owned, leased or operated by it or the nature of its
business makes such qualification, licensing or good standing necessary.

(b) Each Subsidiary of the Company (each, a " _Company Subsidiary_ ")
is duly organized, is validly existing and, where such concept is recognized,
in good standing under the Laws of the jurisdiction of its incorporation or
organization, as the case may be, except to the extent the failure of any
such Company Subsidiary to be in good standing would not have a Company
Material Adverse Effect. _Section 4.1(b)_ of the Company Disclosure Schedule
contains a correct and complete list of all of the Company Subsidiaries, the
ownership interest of the Company in each Company Subsidiary and the ownership
interest of any other Person or Persons in each Company Subsidiary. Each
Company Subsidiary has the requisite corporate or similar power and
authority to own, lease and operate its properties and assets and to carry on
its business as presently conducted, except where the failure to have such
power or authority would not have a Company Material Adverse Effect. Each
Company Subsidiary is duly qualified or licensed to do business and, where
such concept is recognized, is in good standing, in each jurisdiction where
the character of the properties owned, leased or operated by it or the nature
of its business makes such qualification, licensing or good standing
necessary, except for such failures to be so qualified, licensed or in good
standing that would not have a Company Material Adverse Effect. The Company
has made available to Parent prior to the date hereof complete and correct
copies of the certificate of incorporation and bylaws (or similar

the Merger. The execution and delivery of this Agreement by the Company and
the consummation by the Company of the transactions contemplated hereby,
including the Offer and the Merger, have been duly and validly authorized by
all necessary corporate action on the part of the Company, and no other
corporate proceedings on the part of the Company are necessary to authorize
this Agreement or to consummate the transactions contemplated hereby, other
than, with respect to the Merger, (i) the Company Stockholder Approval and
(ii) the filing of the Certificate of Merger with the Secretary of State of
the State of Delaware in accordance with the DGCL. This Agreement has been
duly executed and delivered by the Company and, assuming this Agreement is a
valid and binding obligation of Parent and Purchaser, this Agreement
constitutes a valid and binding obligation of the Company, enforceable against
the Company in accordance with its terms, subject to the
Enforceability Exception.

(b) Assuming the accuracy of the representations and warranties of
Parent and Purchaser set forth in _Section 5.8_, the affirmative vote of
holders of a majority of shares of Company Common Stock outstanding on the
record date of the Company Stockholders Meeting, voting together as a single
class (the " _Company Stockholder Approval_ "), is the only vote of the
holders of any class or series of the Companys Equity Interests necessary to
adopt this Agreement.

and the transactions contemplated hereby, including the Offer and the Merger,
are fair to and in the best interests of the Company and the Company
Stockholders; (ii) approved and declared advisable this Agreement and the
transactions contemplated hereby, including the Offer and the Merger, on the
terms and subject to the conditions set forth herein, in accordance with the
requirements of the DGCL; and (iii) resolved to recommend that the holders of

modified in compliance with the terms of _Section 6.2_ hereof. The Company
Board has determined that the consideration for the Top-Up Option Shares
provided under  _Section 1.3_ is adequate in accordance with the DGCL and
otherwise taken all steps necessary such that, upon issuance and delivery in
accordance with _Section 1.3_, the Shares issued upon exercise of the Top-Up
Option shall be validly issued, fully paid and non-assessable.

(d) The Company has taken all appropriate actions so that the
restrictions on business combinations contained in Section 203 of the DGCL and
any other state anti-takeover statute or regulation (collectively, " _Takeover
Provisions_ ") will 

 



21  not apply with respect to or as a result of the execution of this Agreement
or the consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby, including the
Offer and the Merger, without any further action on the part of the Company
Stockholders or the Company Board.

 

(e) The Company Board has received from Goldman, Sachs and Co. (the "
_Company Financial Advisor_ ") its opinion, dated as of the date hereof, to
the effect that, as of such date and subject to the limitations,
qualifications and assumptions set forth therein, that the $31.00 per Share in

result in the creation of a Lien (other than a Permitted Encumbrance) on any

character of the properties owned, leased or operated by it or the nature of
its business makes such qualification, licensing or good standing necessary,

information and data, the Company has received from the Person so requesting
such information an executed Acceptable Confidentiality Agreement, _provided_

Acquisition Proposal either constitutes a Superior Proposal or could
reasonably be expected to result in a Superior Proposal, and (B) the Company

agree to take any such actions (each such action set forth in clauses (w)
through (z), a " _Company Adverse Recommendation Change_ "), it being
understood that, for the avoidance of doubt, neither the approval or delivery
of a Determination Notice or public disclosure thereof shall be deemed a
Company Adverse Recommendation Change; or 

(ii) cause or permit the Company or any Company Subsidiary to enter
into any Alternative Acquisition Agreement.

 

(d) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary set forth in this
Agreement, at any time prior to the Acceptance Time:

Proposal (which Acquisition Proposal was not solicited, initiated, encouraged
or facilitated in material breach of this Agreement) from any Person that has
not been withdrawn and that the Company Board determines in good faith (based
on the information then available and after consultation with its financial
advisor and outside legal counsel) constitutes a Superior Proposal, (x) the
Company Board may effect a Company Adverse Recommendation Change with respect
to such Superior Proposal, and (y) the Company may terminate this Agreement to
enter into an Alternative Acquisition Agreement with respect to such Superior
Proposal if and only if:

 

(A) the Company shall have provided prior written notice (a "
_Determination Notice_ "), received by Parent at least four (4) Business Days
in advance of taking of such action with respect to such Superior Proposal
(such period, the " _Notice Period_ "), to the effect that the Company Board
has received a _bona fide_ written Acquisition Proposal (which Acquisition
Proposal was not solicited, initiated, encouraged or facilitated in material
breach of this Agreement) that the Company Board has determined in good
faith (based on the information then available and after consultation with
its financial advisor and outside legal counsel) constitutes a Superior
Proposal and, absent any

 



51  revision to the terms and conditions of this Agreement, the Company Board
has determined to effect a Company Adverse Recommendation Change and/or to
terminate this Agreement pursuant to this  _Section 6.2(d)_, which
Determination Notice shall specify the identity of the Person or group of
Persons making the Acquisition Proposal and the material terms and conditions
thereof and shall enclose a copy of the proposed transaction agreements with
the Person or Persons making such Acquisition Proposal;

 

(B) prior to effecting such Company Adverse Recommendation Change
or termination, the Company shall, and shall cause its financial advisor and
legal counsel to, during the Notice Period, negotiate with Parent and the
Parent Representatives in good faith (to the extent Parent desires to
negotiate) regarding a possible amendment of this Agreement or the Offer, so
that such Acquisition Proposal would cease to constitute a Superior Proposal;

(C) after the expiration of the Notice Period, the Company Board
concludes in good faith, based on the information then available and after
consultation with its financial advisor and outside legal counsel, and taking
into account any revisions to this Agreement made or irrevocably committed to
in writing by Parent, that (x) such Acquisition Proposal constitutes a
Superior Proposal and (y) effecting a Company Adverse Recommendation Change
and/or causing the Company to terminate this Agreement to enter into such
Alternative Acquisition Agreement with respect to such Superior Proposal, as
applicable, is necessary in order for the members of the Company Board to
comply with their fiduciary duties to the Company Stockholders under
applicable Law; and

(D) in the case of any termination of this Agreement to enter into an
Alternative Acquisition Agreement with respect to such Superior Proposal
pursuant to clause (y) of this _Section 6.2(d)(i)_, such termination shall

and to comply with the requirements of this _Section 6.2(d)(i)_ with respect
to such Acquisition Proposal ( _provided_ , that the Notice Period for any
subsequent notice will be shortened from four (4) Business Days to two (2)

Notice, but only if such shortening would result in such Notice Period ending
subsequent to the end of the original Notice Period).

 



52 (ii) Other than in response to an Acquisition Proposal, the Company
Board may effect a Company Adverse Recommendation Change of the type described
in _Section 6.2(c)(i)(w) _(or in _Section 6.2(c)(i)(z)_ with respect to the
authorization, commitment, resolution or agreement to take any actions with
respect to an Acquisition Proposal of a type described in _Section

(A) an Intervening Event shall have occurred;

(B) the Company shall have provided a Determination Notice, received by
Parent a period of time in advance of effecting such a Company Adverse
Recommendation Change that is at least as long as the Notice Period, to the
effect that an Intervening Event has occurred and that absent any revision to
the terms and conditions of this Agreement, the Company Board has determined
to effect such a Company Adverse Recommendation Change, which Determination
Notice shall describe the Intervening Event and the basis for such
determination in reasonable detail;

(C) prior to effecting such a Company Adverse Recommendation Change, the

or the Offer; and

 

(D) at or following the end of such Notice Period, the Company
Board determines in good faith, based on the information then available and
after consultation with its financial advisor and outside legal counsel, and
taking into account such revisions to this Agreement made or irrevocably
committed to in writing by Parent, that effecting such a Company Adverse
Recommendation Change due to the Intervening Event is necessary in order for
the members of the Company Board to comply with their fiduciary duties to the
Company Stockholders under applicable Laws; 

_provided_ that, in the event of any material changes to the circumstances of
any Intervening Event, the Company will be required to deliver, prior to the
Acceptance Time, a new Determination Notice to Parent and to comply with the
requirements of this _Section 6.2(d)(ii)_ with respect to such Intervening
Event (provided that the Notice Period for any subsequent notice will be

of Parents receipt of such new Determination Notice, but only if such
shortening would result in such Notice Period ending subsequent to the end of
the original Notice Period).

 

(e) Nothing contained in this _Section 6.2_ shall be deemed
to prohibit the Company or the Company Board or any committee thereof from
(i) taking

 



53  and disclosing to its stockholders a position contemplated by Rule 14e-2(a)
promulgated under the Exchange Act, or (ii) making accurate disclosure to the
Company Stockholders of any factual information regarding the business,
financial condition or results of operations of the Company, Parent or
Purchaser or the fact that an Acquisition Proposal has been made, the identity
of the party making such Acquisition Proposal or the material terms of such
Acquisition Proposal (and no such disclosure shall, taken by itself, be deemed
to be a Company Adverse Recommendation Change), or (iii) making any
communication that is a limited to a "stop-look-and-listen" communication of
the type contemplated by Rule 14d-9(f) under the Exchange Act; _provided_ , in
the case of each of clause (i) and (ii), that any such disclosure (x)
reaffirms the Company Board Recommendation, without any modification
or qualification thereof and (y) does not contain either an express Company
Adverse Recommendation Change or any other statements by or on behalf of the
Company or the Company Board that would reasonably be expected to have the
same effect as a Company Adverse Recommendation Change.

(f) From the date of this Agreement until the earlier of the
Acceptance Time and the termination of this Agreement in accordance with
_Sections 8.1_ or _8.2_ hereof, the Company agrees that it shall promptly
(and, in any event, within 24 hours of the Companys Knowledge of any such
event) notify Parent if (i) any inquiries, expressions of interest, proposals
or offers (including any modification thereto) with respect to an Acquisition
Proposal are received by, (ii) in connection with any inquiry, expression of
interest, proposal or offer that constitutes or would reasonably be expected

the Company, any Company Subsidiary or any Company Representative, indicating,
in connection with such notice, the identity of the Person or group
of Persons making such communication and the material terms and conditions
thereof and thereafter shall keep Parent reasonably informed, on a
substantially current basis, of any material developments or modifications to
the terms of any such communication and the status of any such discussions or
negotiations. Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, the Company
shall (i) provide to Parent, as soon as practicable and in any event within 24
hours after the Companys dispatch thereof, or Knowledge of receipt thereof

may be, copies of all written communications and materials, including any
draft agreements, sent by or provided to the Company, any Company Subsidiary
or any Company Representative in connection with any Acquisition Proposal and
(ii) notify Parent as soon as practicable, and in any event within 24 hours,
if the Company determines to begin providing information or to engage in
discussions or negotiations concerning an Acquisition Proposal pursuant to
_Section 6.2(b)_.

Parent and the Company agree that any action inconsistent with the
restrictions set forth in this _Section 6.2_ by any Representative of the
Company will be deemed to be a breach of this  _Section 6.2_ by the Company.

 



54 Section 6.3 _Company Stockholders  Meeting; Proxy Statement_.

Agreement by the Company Stockholders is required under applicable Law in

of Incorporation and the Company Bylaws, establish a record date for, call,
give notice of, convene and hold a meeting of the Company Stockholders (the "
_Company Stockholders  Meeting_") for the purpose of voting upon the
adoption of this Agreement in accordance with the DGCL and shall not postpone
or adjourn the Company Stockholders Meeting unless the Company determines that
it is advisable to do so in order to solicit additional proxies in order to
obtain the Company Stockholder Approval or to comply with applicable Law.

all lawful action to solicit from the Company Stockholders proxies in favor of
the adoption of this Agreement in accordance with the DGCL.

 

(b) In connection with the Company Stockholders Meeting, if any, the
Company shall prepare and file with the SEC a proxy statement, letter to
stockholders, notice of meeting and form of proxy accompanying the proxy
statement that will be provided to the Company Stockholders in connection with
the solicitation of proxies for use at the Company Stockholders Meeting, and
any schedules required to be filed with the SEC in connection therewith

or Parties hereto, as the case may be, may reasonably request in connection
with the preparation and filing with the SEC of the Proxy Statement. Subject

constitute "proxy materials" or "solicitation materials" as those terms are
used in Rules 14a-1 through 14a-17 promulgated under the Exchange Act or (ii)
are otherwise used for the "solicitation" of "proxies" as those terms are
defined in Rule 14a-1 promulgated under the Exchange Act, in each case prior
to the filing thereof with the SEC or the dissemination thereof to Company
Stockholders. The Company shall advise Parent, promptly after it receives
notice thereof, of any request by the SEC or its staff for an amendment or
revisions to the Proxy Statement, or comments thereon and responses thereto,
or requests by the SEC or its staff for additional information in
connection therewith. If at any time prior to the Company Stockholders
Meeting, any information relating to the Company or Parent or Purchaser, or
any of their respective directors, officers or Affiliates, should be
discovered by the Company or Parent or Purchaser

 



55  which should be set forth in an amendment or supplement to the Proxy
Statement so that the Proxy Statement would not include any misstatement of a
material fact or omit to state any material fact necessary to make the
statements therein, in light of the circumstances under which they were made,
not misleading, the Party which discovers such information shall promptly
notify the other Party or Parties, as the case may be, and an
appropriate amendment or supplement to the Proxy Statement describing such
information shall be promptly prepared and filed by the Company with the SEC
and, to the extent required by applicable Law, disseminated by the Company to
the Company Stockholders. The Company shall cause the Proxy Statement to
comply as to form and substance in all material respects with all applicable
Law, including the requirements of the Exchange Act and the Nasdaq.

this Agreement in accordance with the DGCL at the Company Stockholders
Meeting, at any postponement or adjournment thereof, or otherwise.

_Section 6.3_ hereof, in the event that the Bayer Entities shall own in the
aggregate at least ninety percent (90%) of the issued and outstanding Shares
pursuant to the Offer or otherwise (including as a result of the exercise of
the Top-Up Option or pursuant to any Subsequent Offering Period) (the "
_Short-Form Threshold_ "), subject to satisfaction of the conditions set forth
in _Section 7.1(b)_ and  _Section 7.1(c)_, Parent and Purchaser shall take
all necessary and appropriate action to effect the Merger and to cause the
Effective Time to occur as promptly as reasonably practicable without a

Person not a party to, or otherwise covered by, the Confidentiality Agreement
or a similar agreement with the Company with respect to such information or
(B) provide access to or furnish any information if doing so would violate any
applicable Law or Contract, or where such access to information would involve
the waiver or loss of an attorney-client or work product privilege so long as
the Company has reasonably cooperated with Parent to permit such inspection
of, or to disclose such, information on a basis that does not compromise or
waive such privilege with respect thereto; _provided_ , _however_ , that such
access and information shall be disclosed or granted, as applicable, to
external counsel for Parent to the extent reasonably required for the purpose
of complying with applicable Antitrust Laws subject to prior execution of a

Party shall issue any such press release or make any such public
announcements prior to such consultation, except to the extent the disclosing

efforts to consult with the other Party before issuing or making any such

connection with any action by the Company or the Company Board contemplated

Section 6.10 _Employee Matters_.

 

(a) For the period of time commencing on the Acceptance Time and

respect to Continuing Employees who participate in a sales commission program,
ending no earlier than December 31, 2013, Parent shall, or shall cause the
Surviving Corporation to, provide each Continuing Employee with total cash
compensation opportunities at least as favorable in the aggregate as the total
cash compensation opportunities provided to the Continuing Employee by the
Company immediately prior to the Acceptance Time.

(b) Without limiting paragraph (a) of this _Section 6.10_, (i) Parent
shall explicitly assume and agrees to perform, or to cause to be performed,
the obligations of the Company in respect of any Continuing Employee under
those agreements set forth on  _Section 6.10(b)(i)_ of the Company
Disclosure Schedule and

 



60  (ii) for a period of one (1) year following the Acceptance Time, Parent and
the Company agree to take the actions set forth on _Section 6.10(b)(ii)_ of
the Company Disclosure Schedule. Except as otherwise required under
applicable Laws, Continuing Employees shall be considered to be employed by
Parent "at will" and nothing shall be construed to limit the ability of Parent
or the Surviving Corporation to terminate the employment of any such
Continuing Employee at any time.

 

(c) As of and following the Effective Time, Parent will either (i)
continue Company Plans with respect to Continuing Employees, (ii) permit
Continuing Employees and, as applicable, their eligible dependents, to
participate in the employee benefit plans, programs or policies (including
without limitation any plan intended to qualify within the meaning of Section
401(a) of the Code and any vacation, sick, per personal time off plans or
programs) of Parent, or (iii) a combination of clauses (i) and (ii), such that
such Continuing Employees and, as applicable, their eligible dependents,
shall continue to be covered by employee benefit plans, programs or policies
that are on terms substantially no less favorable in the aggregate than those
provided to similarly situated employees of Parent, including with respect to
geographical location. To the extent Parent elects to have Continuing
Employees and their eligible dependents participate in its employee benefit
plans, program or policies following the Effective Time, Parent shall, and
shall cause the Surviving Corporation to, treat, and cause the applicable
benefit plans in which Continuing Employees are entitled to participate to
treat, the service of Continuing Employees with the Company or any Company
Subsidiary or any of their predecessors to the extent previously recognized by
the Company as of the date hereof attributable to any period before the
Effective Time as service rendered to Parent, the Surviving Corporation, any
Subsidiary of Parent for purposes of eligibility to participate, vesting and
for other appropriate benefits including the applicability of minimum waiting
periods for participation, but excluding benefit accrual (including minimum
pension amount), equity incentive plans and eligibility for early retirement
under any benefit plan of Parent or eligibility for retiree welfare benefit
plans or as would otherwise result in a duplication of benefits. Without
limiting the foregoing, Parent shall use commercially reasonable efforts to
cause any pre-existing conditions or actively at work or similar limitations,
eligibility waiting periods, evidence of insurability requirements or required
physical examinations under any health or similar plan of Parent to be waived
with respect to Continuing Employees and their eligible dependents; provided,
however, that with respect to preexisting conditions, such conditions shall be
waived to the extent waived under the corresponding plan in which Continuing
Employees participated immediately prior to the date Continuing Employees and
their eligible dependents are transitioned to Parents health or similar
plans. Parent shall also use commercially reasonable efforts to cause
any deductibles paid by Continuing Employees under any of Companys or its
Subsidiaries health plans in the plan year in which Continuing Employees and
their eligible dependents are transitioned to Parents health or similar plans
to be credited towards deductibles under the health plans of Parent or any
Subsidiary of Parent.

 



61 (d) From and after the date of this Agreement until the Effective

matters that are affected by the transactions contemplated by this Agreement,
the Company shall provide Parent with a copy of the intended communication,
Parent shall have a reasonable period of time to review and comment on the
communication, and Parent and the Company shall cooperate in providing any
such mutually agreeable communication. Between the date of this Agreement and
the Effective Time, the Company shall use its reasonable best efforts to
assist Parent in entering into Parents standard documents relating
to compensation and benefits in respect of periods after the Effective Time
with each of the Continuing Employees.

(e) Notwithstanding anything in this _Section 6.10 _to the contrary
but consistent with this _Section 6.10_, nothing contained herein, whether
express or implied, shall be treated as an amendment or other modification of
any employee benefit plan of Parent or the Surviving Corporation or any of
their respective Subsidiaries or Affiliates, or shall limit the right of
Parent or the Surviving Corporation or any of their respective Subsidiaries
or Affiliates to amend, terminate or otherwise modify any employee benefit
plan of Parent or the Surviving Corporation or any of their respective
Subsidiaries or Affiliates following the Effective Time.

(f) The parties hereto acknowledge and agree that all provisions
contained in this _Section 6.10_ are included for the sole benefit of the
Parties hereto, and that nothing in this Agreement, whether express or
implied, shall create any third-party beneficiary or other rights (i) in any
other Person, including any employees or former employees of the Company or
any Affiliate of the Company, any Continuing Employee, or any dependent or
beneficiary thereof or (ii) to continued employment with Parent or any of
its Affiliates.

Section 6.11 _Indemnification of Directors and Officers_.

 

(a) Parent and Purchaser agree that all rights of
indemnification, advancement of expenses, exculpation and limitation of
liabilities existing in favor of the current or former directors and officers
of the Company and the Company Subsidiaries (the " _Indemnified Parties_ ") as

prior to the Effective Time, shall survive the Merger and continue in full
force and effect in accordance with their respective terms for a period of
six (6) years from and after the Effective Time. From and after the Effective
Time, Parent and the Surviving Corporation shall be jointly and severally
liable to pay and perform in a timely manner such obligations. For a period of
six (6) years after the Effective Time, Parent shall cause the certificate of
incorporation and bylaws of the Surviving

 



62  Corporation to contain provisions no less favorable with respect to
indemnification, exculpation and limitation of liabilities of the Indemnified
Parties and advancement of expenses than are set forth as of the date of this
Agreement in the Company Certificate of Incorporation and the Company Bylaws.

 

(b) Prior to the Effective Time the Company shall, to the fullest
extent permitted under applicable Laws, indemnify and hold harmless, and, for
a period of six (6) years from and after the Effective Time, Parent shall and
shall cause the Surviving Corporation to, to the fullest extent permitted
under applicable Laws, indemnify and hold harmless, each present and former
director or officer of Company and the Company Subsidiaries and each such
Person who served at the request of the Company or any Company Subsidiary as a

corporation, partnership, joint venture, trust, pension or other employee
benefit plan or enterprise, against all costs and expenses (including
reasonable attorneys fees), judgments, fines, losses, claims, damages,
liabilities and settlement amounts paid in connection with any claim, action,
suit, proceeding or investigation (whether arising before or after the
Effective Time), whether civil, administrative or investigative, arising out
of or pertaining to any action or omission in their capacities as officers or
directors or in serving at the request of the Company or any Company
Subsidiary, in each case occurring before the Effective Time (including the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement).

(c) In the event that Parent or the Surviving Corporation or any of
their respective successors or assigns (i) consolidates with or merges into
any other Person and is not the continuing or surviving corporation or entity
of such consolidation or merger or (ii) transfers or conveys all or
substantially all of its properties and assets to any Person, or if Parent
dissolves the Surviving Corporation, then, and in each such case, Parent shall
cause proper provision to be made so that the successors and assigns of
Parent or the Surviving Corporation assume the obligations set forth in this
_Section 6.11_.

 

(d) At or prior to the Acceptance Time, and in any event, prior to
the Effective Time, the Company shall or, if the Company is unable to, Parent
shall cause the Surviving Corporation as of the Effective Time to, obtain and
fully pay the premium for a non-cancellable extension (or "tail") of

premiums paid by the Company for such purpose, it being understood that Parent

coverage, with respect to each year during the Tail Period, as may be obtained
for such 250% annual amount; _provided_ , _further_ , that Parent or the

rating than the Companys current insurance carrier with respect to DandO
Insurance.

80   _Exchange of Certificates_ ) and _Section 6.11_ ( _Indemnification of
Directors and Officers_ ), and (b) those other covenants and agreements
contained herein that by their terms apply, or that are to be performed in
whole or in part, after the Effective Time, which shall survive the
consummation of the Merger until fully performed.

Section 10.2 _Amendment_. Subject to _Section 1.4(b)_, and to the extent
permitted by applicable Law, this Agreement may be amended by the Parties by
action taken by or on behalf of their respective Boards of Directors at any

shall any single or partial exercise of any right under this Agreement
preclude any other or further exercise of any rights hereunder.

permitted under, or otherwise in connection with this Agreement, shall be in

will be binding upon, inure to the benefit of and be enforceable by the
Parties and their respective successors and permitted assigns.

Section 10.6 _Severability_. In the event that any provision of this
Agreement, or the application thereof, becomes or is declared by a court of
competent jurisdiction to be illegal, void or unenforceable, the remainder of
this Agreement will continue in full force and effect and the application of
such provision to other persons or circumstances will be interpreted so as
reasonably to effect the intent of the Parties hereto. The Parties further
agree to replace such void or unenforceable provision of this Agreement with a
valid and enforceable provision that will achieve, to the extent possible, the
economic, business and other purposes of such void or unenforceable
provision.

 



82 Section 10.7 _Entire Agreement_. This Agreement (together with the
Exhibits, Annex, Parent Disclosure Schedule, Company Disclosure Schedule and
the other documents delivered pursuant hereto) and the Confidentiality
Agreement constitute the entire agreement of the Parties and supersede all
prior agreements and undertakings, both written and oral, among the Parties,
or any of them, with respect to the subject matter hereof and thereof.

Section 10.8 _Governing Law; Jurisdiction_.

(a) This Agreement and all claims or causes of action (whether in
contract, tort or otherwise) that may be based upon, arise out of or relate to
this Agreement or the negotiation, execution or performance of this Agreement
(including any claim or cause of action based upon, arising out of or related
to any representation or warranty made in or in connection with this Agreement
or as an inducement to enter into this Agreement), shall be construed,
performed and enforced in accordance with the Laws of the State of Delaware
without giving effect to its principles or rules of conflict of laws to the
extent such principles or rules would require or permit the application of
the Laws of another jurisdiction.

 

(b) Any Action between the Parties, arising out of or relating to this
Agreement or the transactions contemplated hereby shall be brought solely and
exclusively in the Court of Chancery of the State of Delaware, or in any
direct appellate court therefrom; _provided_ that if (and only after) such
courts determine that they lack subject matter jurisdiction over any such
legal Action, such legal Action shall be brought solely and exclusively in the
Federal courts of the United States located in the State of Delaware, or in
any direct appellate court therefrom. Each of the Parties hereto agrees that
a final judgment (subject to any appeals therefrom) in any such Action shall
be conclusive and may be enforced in other jurisdictions by suit on the
judgment or in any other manner provided by Law. Each Party
hereby irrevocably submits to the exclusive jurisdiction of such courts in
respect of any legal Action between the Parties arising out of or relating to
this Agreement or the transactions contemplated hereby, and hereby irrevocably
and unconditionally waives, to the fullest extent it may legally and
effectively do so, any objection which it may now or hereafter have to the
laying of venue of any Action between the Parties arising out of or relating
to this Agreement or the transactions contemplated hereby in any such court
in accordance with the provisions of this _Section 10.8_. Each of the Parties
hereto hereby irrevocably waives, to the fullest extent permitted by law, the
defense of an inconvenient forum to the maintenance of such Action in any
such court. Each of the Parties hereto hereby irrevocably and unconditionally
consents to service of process in the manner provided for notices in _Section
10.4_. Nothing in this Agreement will affect the right of any Party to this
Agreement to serve process in any other manner permitted by Law.

 

Section 10.9 _Waiver of Jury Trial_. EACH PARTY ACKNOWLEDGES AND AGREES
THAT ANY CONTROVERSY WHICH MAY ARISE UNDER THIS AGREEMENT IS LIKELY TO
INVOLVE COMPLICATED AND DIFFICULT ISSUES, AND THEREFORE EACH SUCH PARTY HEREBY
IRREVOCABLY AND

 



83  UNCONDITIONALLY WAIVES ANY RIGHT SUCH PARTY MAY HAVE TO A TRIAL BY JURY IN
RESPECT OF ANY LITIGATION DIRECTLY OR INDIRECTLY ARISING OUT OF OR RELATING TO
THIS AGREEMENT OR THE TRANSACTIONS CONTEMPLATED HEREBY. EACH PARTY CERTIFIES
AND ACKNOWLEDGES THAT (i) NO REPRESENTATIVE, AGENT OR ATTORNEY OF ANY OTHER
PARTY HAS REPRESENTED, EXPRESSLY OR OTHERWISE, THAT SUCH OTHER PARTY WOULD
NOT, IN THE EVENT OF LITIGATION, SEEK TO ENFORCE THE FOREGOING WAIVER, (ii)
EACH PARTY UNDERSTANDS AND HAS CONSIDERED THE IMPLICATIONS OF THIS WAIVER,
(iii) EACH PARTY MAKES THIS WAIVER VOLUNTARILY, AND (iv) EACH PARTY HAS BEEN
INDUCED TO ENTER INTO THIS AGREEMENT BY, AMONG OTHER THINGS, THE MUTUAL
WAIVERS AND CERTIFICATIONS IN THIS _SECTION 10.9_.

Section 10.10 _Remedies; Specific Performance_. Except as otherwise
provided herein, any and all remedies herein expressly conferred upon a Party
will be deemed cumulative with and not exclusive of any other remedy conferred
hereby, or by law or equity upon such Party, and the exercise by a Party of
any one remedy will not preclude the exercise of any other remedy. The Parties
agree that irreparable damage would occur if any provision of this Agreement
were not performed in accordance with the terms hereof, and, accordingly,
that the Parties shall be entitled to an injunction or injunctions to prevent
breaches of this Agreement or to enforce specifically the performance of the
terms and provisions hereof, in addition to any other remedy to which they
are entitled at law or in equity. The Parties hereto further agree to waive
any requirement for the securing or posting of any bond in connection with the
obtaining of any such injunctive or other equitable relief, this being in
addition to any other remedy to which they are entitled at Law or in equity.

Section 10.11 _No Third-Party Beneficiaries_. Except as provided in
_Section 6.11_, each of Parent and the Company hereby agrees that their
respective representations, warranties and covenants set forth herein are
solely for the benefit of the other Parties, in accordance with and subject
to the terms and conditions of this Agreement, and this Agreement is not
intended to, and does not, confer upon any Person other than the Parties
hereto any rights or remedies hereunder, including the right to rely upon the
representations and warranties set forth herein. The Parties further agree
that the rights of third-party beneficiaries under _Section 6.11_ shall not
arise unless and until the Effective Time occurs.

 

Section 10.12 _Obligations of Parent and of the Company_. Whenever this
Agreement requires a Subsidiary of Parent to take any action (including
Purchaser and the Surviving Corporation), such requirement shall be deemed to
include an undertaking on the part of Parent to cause such Subsidiary to take
such action.

 

Section 10.13 _Fees and Expenses_. The Surviving Corporation shall pay all
charges and expenses, including those of the Paying Agent, incurred in
connection with the transactions contemplated by _Article III_. The Company
and Parent shall cooperate in timely

 



84  making all filings, returns, reports and forms as necessary or appropriate
to comply with the provisions of all applicable Laws in connection with the
payment of any such amounts, and shall cooperate in good faith to minimize,
to the fullest extent possible under such Laws, any such amounts payable in
connection therewith. Except as otherwise expressly set forth in this
Agreement, all fees and expenses incurred in connection herewith and the
transactions contemplated hereby shall be paid by the Party incurring such
expenses, whether or not the Offer or the Merger are consummated.

Section 10.14 _Mutual Drafting_. Each Party has participated in the drafting
of this Agreement, which each Party acknowledges is the result of extensive
negotiations between the Parties; accordingly, in the event an ambiguity or
question of intent or interpretation arises, this Agreement shall be construed
as if drafted jointly by the Parties, and no presumption or burden of proof
shall arise favoring or disfavoring any Party by virtue of the authorship of
any provisions of this Agreement.

way the meaning or interpretation of this Agreement.

 

Section 10.16 _Counterparts; Delivery by Facsimile or Electronically_.

 

(a) This Agreement may be executed by original or facsimile signature
and in one or more counterparts, and by the different Parties in separate
counterparts, each of which when executed shall be deemed to be an original
but all of which taken together shall constitute one and the same agreement.

 

(b) This Agreement, and any amendments hereto, waivers hereof or
consents or notifications hereunder, to the extent signed and delivered by
means of a facsimile machine or by email with facsimile or scan attachment,
shall be treated in all manner and respects as an original contract and shall

original signed version thereof delivered in person. At the request of any
Party, each other Party shall re-execute original forms thereof and deliver
them to all other Parties. No Party shall raise the use of a facsimile
machine or email to deliver a signature or the fact that any signature or

85  transmitted or communicated through the use of facsimile machine or by email

and each such Party forever waives any such defense.

 ARTICLE I

_Stockholders_

Section 1.1. _Annual Meetings_. An annual meeting of stockholders shall be
held for the election of directors at such date, time and place either within
or without the State of Delaware as may be designated by the Board of
Directors from time to time. Any other proper business may be transacted at
the annual meeting.

Section 1.2. _Special Meetings_. Special meetings of stockholders may be
called at any time by the Chairman of the Board, if any, the Vice Chairman of
the Board, if any, the CEO, the President, the Secretary, the Board of
Directors, or the holders of record of not less than a majority of
outstanding shares of stock entitled to vote on a matter at the meeting, to be
held at such date, time and place either within or without the State of
Delaware as may be stated in the notice of the meeting. A special meeting of
stockholders shall be called by the Secretary upon the written request,
stating the purpose of the meeting, of stockholders who together own of record
a majority of the outstanding shares of each class of stock entitled to vote
at such meeting.

Section 1.3. _Notice of Meetings_. Whenever stockholders are required or
permitted to take any action at a meeting, a written notice of the meeting
shall be given which shall state the place, date and hour of the meeting, and,
in the case of a special meeting, the purpose or purposes for which the
meeting is called. Unless otherwise provided by law, the written notice of
any meeting shall be given not less than ten nor more than sixty days before
the date of the meeting to each stockholder entitled to vote at such meeting.
If mailed, such notice shall be deemed to be given when deposited in the
United States mail, postage prepaid, directed to the stockholder at such
stockholders address as it appears on the records of the Corporation.

 

Section 1.4. _Adjournments_. Any meeting of stockholders, annual or
special, may be adjourned from time to time, to reconvene at the same or some
other place, and notice need not be given of any such adjourned meeting if the
time and place thereof are announced at the meeting at which the adjournment
is taken. At the adjourned meeting the Corporation may transact any business
which might have been transacted at the original meeting. If the adjournment
is for more than thirty days, or if after the adjournment a new record date is
fixed for the adjourned meeting, a notice of the adjourned meeting shall be
given to each stockholder of record entitled to vote at the meeting.

 

Section 1.5. _Quorum_. At each meeting of stockholders, except where
otherwise provided by law or the certificate of incorporation or these
bylaws, the holders of a majority of the outstanding shares of stock entitled
to vote on a matter at the meeting, present in person or represented by proxy,
shall constitute a quorum. A quorum, once established, shall not be broken by
the withdrawal of enough votes to leave less than a quorum. In the absence of
a quorum of the holders of any class of stock entitled to vote on a matter,
the holders of such class so present or represented may, by majority vote,
adjourn the meeting of such class from time to time in the manner provided by
Section 1.4 of these bylaws until a quorum of such class shall be so present
or represented. Section 1.6. _Organization_. Meetings of stockholders shall be presided
over by the Chairman of the Board, if any, or in the absence of the Chairman
of the Board by the Vice Chairman of the Board, if any, or in the absence of
the Vice Chairman of the Board by the CEO, or in the absence of the CEO by
the President, or in the absence of the foregoing persons by a chairman
designated by the Board of Directors, or in the absence of such designation by
a chairman chosen at the meeting. The Secretary, or in the absence of the
Secretary an Assistant Secretary, shall act as secretary of the meeting, but
in the absence of the Secretary and any Assistant Secretary the chairman of
the meeting may appoint any person to act as secretary of the meeting. Except
to the extent inconsistent with such rules and regulations as adopted by the
Board of Directors, the chairman of any meeting of the stockholders shall have
the right and authority to prescribe such rules, regulations and procedures
and to do all such acts as, in the judgment of such chairman, are appropriate
for the proper conduct of the meeting. Such rules, regulations or procedures,
whether adopted by the Board of Directors or prescribed by the chairman of the
meeting, may include, without limitation, the following: (i) the
establishment of an agenda or order of business for the meeting; (ii) the
determination of when the polls shall open and close for any given matter to
be voted on at the meeting; (iii) rules and procedures for maintaining order
at the meeting and the safety of those present; (iv) limitations on attendance
at or participation in the meeting to stockholders of record of the
Corporation, their duly authorized and constituted proxies or such other
persons as the chairman of the meeting shall determine; (v) restrictions on
entry to the meeting after the time fixed for the commencement thereof; and
(vi) limitations on the time allocated to questions or comments by
participants.

 

Section 1.7. _Voting; Proxies_. Unless otherwise provided in the
certificate of incorporation, each stockholder entitled to vote at any
meeting of stockholders shall be entitled to one vote for each share of stock
held by such stockholder which has voting power upon the matter in question.
Each stockholder entitled to vote at a meeting of stockholders or to express
consent or dissent to corporate action in writing without a meeting may
authorize another person or persons to act for such stockholder by proxy, but
no such proxy shall be voted or acted upon after three years from its date,
unless the proxy provides for a longer period. A duly executed proxy shall be
irrevocable if it states that it is irrevocable and if, and only as long as,
it is coupled with an interest sufficient in law to support an irrevocable
power, regardless of whether the interest with which it is coupled is an
interest in the stock itself or an interest in the Corporation generally. A
stockholder may revoke any proxy which is not irrevocable by attending the
meeting and voting in person or by filing an instrument in writing revoking
the proxy or another duly executed proxy bearing a later date with the
Secretary of the Corporation. Voting at meetings of stockholders need not be
by written ballot and need not be conducted by inspectors unless the holders
of a majority of the outstanding shares of all classes of stock entitled to
vote thereon present in person or represented by proxy at such meeting shall
so determine. Directors shall be elected by a plurality of the votes of
the shares present in person or represented by proxy at the meeting and
entitled to vote on the election of directors. In all other matters, unless
otherwise provided by law or by the certificate of incorporation or these
bylaws, the affirmative vote of the holders of a majority of the shares
present in person or represented by proxy at the meeting and entitled to vote
on the subject matter shall be the act of the stockholders.

 



2  Section 1.8. _Fixing Date for Determination of Stockholders of Record_.

(a) In order that the Corporation may determine the stockholders entitled to
notice of or to vote at any meeting of stockholders or any adjournment
thereof, the Board of Directors may fix a record date, which record date shall
not precede the date upon which the resolution fixing the record date is
adopted by the Board of Directors, and which record date shall not be more
than sixty nor less than ten days before the date of such meeting. If no
record date is fixed by the Board of Directors, the record date for
determining stockholders entitled to notice of or to vote at a meeting of
stockholders shall be at the close of business on the day next preceding the
day on which notice is given, or, if notice is waived, at the close of
business on the day next preceding the day on which the meeting is held. A
determination of stockholders of record entitled to notice of or to vote at a
meeting of stockholders shall apply to any adjournment of the meeting;
provided, however, that the Board of Directors may fix a new record date for
the adjourned meeting.

 

(b) In order that the Corporation may determine the stockholders
entitled to consent to corporate action in writing without a meeting, the
Board of Directors may fix a record date, which record date shall not precede
the date upon which the resolution fixing the record date is adopted by the
Board of Directors, and which date shall not be more than ten days after the
date upon which the resolution fixing the record date is adopted by the Board
of Directors. If no record date has been fixed by the Board of Directors, the
record date for determining stockholders entitled to consent to corporate
action in writing without a meeting, when no prior action by the Board of
Directors is required by law, shall be the first date on which a signed
written consent setting forth the action taken or proposed to be taken is
delivered to the Corporation by delivery to its registered office in the
State of Delaware, its principal place of business, or an officer or agent of
the Corporation having custody of the book in which proceedings of meetings of
stockholders are recorded. Delivery made to the Corporations registered
office shall be by hand or by certified or registered mail, return receipt
requested. If no record date has been fixed by the Board of Directors and
prior action by the Board of Directors is required by law, the record date
for determining stockholders entitled to consent to corporate action in
writing without a meeting shall be at the close of business on the day on
which the Board of Directors adopts the resolution taking such prior action. 

(c) In order that the Corporation may determine the stockholders
entitled to receive payment of any dividend or other distribution or
allotment of any rights or the stockholders entitled to exercise any rights in
respect of any change, conversion or exchange of stock, or for the purpose of
any other lawful action, the Board of Directors may fix a record date, which
record date shall not precede the date upon which the resolution fixing the
record date is adopted, and which record date shall be not more than sixty
days prior to such action. If no record date is fixed, the record date for
determining stockholders for any such purpose shall be at the close of
business on the day on which the Board of Directors adopts the resolution
relating thereto.

 



3  Section 1.9. _List of Stockholders Entitled to Vote_. The Secretary, or
such other officer of the Corporation who has charge of the stock ledger of
the Corporation, shall prepare and make, at least ten days before every
meeting of stockholders, a complete list of the stockholders entitled to vote
at the meeting, arranged in alphabetical order, and showing the address of
each stockholder and the number of shares registered in the name of each
stockholder. Such list shall be open to the examination of any stockholder,
for any purpose germane to the meeting, for a period of at least ten days
prior to the meeting, either (i) on a reasonable accessible electronic
network, provided that the information required to gain access to such list is
provided with the notice of meeting or (ii) during ordinary course business
hours, at the principal place of business of the Corporation. The list shall
also be produced and kept at the time and place of the meeting during the
whole time thereof and may be inspected by any stockholder who is present.

Section 1.10. _Consent of Stockholders in Lieu of Meeting_. Unless
otherwise provided in the certificate of incorporation or by law, any action
required by law to be taken at any annual or special meeting of stockholders
of the Corporation, or any action which may be taken at any annual or special
meeting of such stockholders, may be taken without a meeting, without prior
notice and without a vote, if a consent or consents in writing, setting forth
the action so taken, shall be signed by the holders of outstanding
stock having not less than the minimum number of votes that would be
necessary to authorize or take such action at a meeting at which all shares
entitled to vote thereon were present and voted and shall be delivered to the
Corporation by delivery to (i) its registered office in the State of Delaware
by hand or by certified mail or registered mail, return receipt requested,
(ii) its principal place of business, or (iii) an officer or agent of the
Corporation having custody of the book in which proceedings of meetings of
stockholders are recorded. Every written consent shall bear the date of
signature of each stockholder who signs the consent and no written consent
shall be effective to take the corporate action referred to therein unless,
within sixty days of the earliest dated consent delivered in the manner
required by these bylaws, written consents signed by a sufficient number of
holders to take action are delivered to the Corporation by delivery to (i)
its registered office in the State of Delaware by hand or by certified or
registered mail, return receipt requested, (ii) its principal place of
business, or (iii) an officer or agent of the Corporation having custody of
the book in which proceedings of meetings of stockholders are recorded. Any
copy, facsimile or other reliable reproduction of a consent in writing may be
substituted or used in lieu of the original writing for any and all purposes
for which the original writing could be used, provided that such copy,
facsimile or other reproduction shall be a complete reproduction of the entire
original writing. Prompt notice of the taking of the corporate action without
a meeting by less than unanimous written consent shall be given to those
stockholders who have not consented in writing and who, if the action had been
taken at a meeting, would have been entitled to notice of the meeting if the
record date for such meeting had been the date that written consents signed
by a sufficient number of stockholders to take the action were delivered to
the Corporation as provided in this Section 1.10.

committee or subcommittee thereof, as the case may be, by means of conference
telephone or similar communications equipment by means of which all persons

rules for the conduct of its business. In the absence of a provision by the
Board or a provision in the rules of such committee to the contrary, a
majority of the entire authorized number of members of such committee shall
constitute a quorum for the transaction of business, the vote of a majority of
the members present at a meeting at the time of such vote if a quorum is then
present shall be the act of such committee, and in other respects each
committee shall conduct its business in the same manner as the Board conducts
its business pursuant to Article II of these bylaws.

ARTICLE IV

_Officers_

 

Section 4.1. _Officers; Election_. As soon as practicable after the annual

may also elect a President, one or more Vice Presidents, one or more
Assistant Vice Presidents, one or more Assistant Secretaries, a Treasurer and
one or more Assistant Treasurers and such other officers as the Board may deem

or the Secretary of the Corporation. Such resignation shall take effect at the

of such resignation shall be necessary to make it effective. The Board may
remove any officer with or without cause at any time. Any such removal shall
be without prejudice to the

 



7   contractual rights of such officer, if any, with the Corporation, but the
election of an officer shall not of itself create contractual rights. Any
vacancy occurring in any office of the Corporation by death, resignation,
removal or otherwise may be filled by the Board at any regular or special
meeting.

 

Section 4.3. _Powers and Duties_. The officers of the Corporation shall
have such powers and duties in the management of the Corporation as shall be
stated in these bylaws or in a resolution of the Board of Directors which is
not inconsistent with these bylaws and, to the extent not so stated, as
generally pertain to their respective offices, subject to the control of the
Board. The Secretary shall have the duty to record the proceedings of the
meetings of the stockholders, the Board of Directors and any committees in a
book to be kept for that purpose. The Board may require any officer, agent or
employee to give security for the faithful performance of his or her duties.

 

Section 4.4. _CEO_. The CEO shall, subject to the control of the Board of
Directors and, if there is one, the Chairman of the Board of Directors, have
general supervision of the business of the Corporation and shall see that all
orders and resolutions of the Board of Directors are carried into effect. The
CEO shall execute all bonds, mortgages, contracts and other instruments of
the Corporation requiring a seal, under the seal of the Corporation, except
where required or permitted by law to be otherwise signed and executed and
except that the other officers of the Corporation may sign and execute
documents when so authorized by these bylaws, the Board of Directors or the
CEO. In the absence or disability of the Chairman of the Board of Directors,
or if there is no Chairman of the Board of Directors, the CEO shall preside at
all meetings of the stockholders and, provided the CEO is also a director, at
the Board of Directors. The CEO shall also perform such other duties and may
exercise such other powers as may from time to time be assigned to such
officer by these bylaws or by the Board of Directors.

Section 4.5. _President_. At the request of the CEO or in the CEOs
absence or in the event of the CEOs inability or refusal to act (and if there
is no Chairman of the Board of Directors), the President shall perform the
duties of the CEO and, when so acting, shall have all the powers and be
subject to all the restrictions of the CEO. The President shall perform such
other duties and have such other powers as the Board of Directors from time to
time may prescribe. If there is no Chairman of the Board of Directors and no
President, the Board of Directors shall designate the officer of the
Corporation who, in the absence of the CEO or in the event of the inability or
refusal of the CEO to act, shall perform the duties of the CEO, and when so
acting, shall have all the powers of and be subject to all the restrictions
upon the CEO.

_Stock_

 

Section 5.1. _Stock Certificates and Uncertificated Shares_. The shares of
stock in the Corporation shall be represented by certificates, provided that
the Board of Directors may provide by resolution or resolutions that some or
all of any or all classes or series of the Corporations stock shall be
uncertificated shares. Any such resolution shall not apply to shares
represented by a certificate theretofore issued until such certificate is
surrendered to the Corporation. Notwithstanding the adoption of such a
resolution by the Board, every holder of stock represented by
certificates shall be entitled to have a certificate signed by or in the name
of the Corporation by the Chairman or Vice Chairman of the Board, if any, or
the President or a Vice President, and by the Treasurer or an Assistant
Treasurer, or the Secretary or an Assistant Secretary, of the Corporation,
representing the number of shares of stock registered in certificate form
owned by such holder. If such certificate is manually signed by one officer or
manually countersigned by a transfer agent or by a registrar, any other
signature on the certificate may be a facsimile. In case any officer, transfer
agent or registrar who has signed or whose facsimile signature has been placed
upon a certificate shall have ceased to be such officer, transfer agent or
registrar before such certificate is issued, it may be issued by the
Corporation with the same effect as if such person were such officer, transfer
agent or registrar at the date of issue.

 

Except as otherwise expressly provided by law, the rights and obligations of
the holders of uncertificated shares and the rights and obligations of the
holders of certificates representing stock of the same class and series shall
be identical.

 

Section 5.2. _Lost, Stolen or Destroyed Stock Certificates; Issuance of New
Certificates_. The Corporation may issue a new certificate of stock or
uncertificated shares in the place of any certificate theretofore issued by
it, alleged to have been lost, stolen or destroyed, and the Corporation may
require the owner of the lost, stolen or destroyed certificate, or such
owners legal representative, to give the Corporation a bond sufficient to

alleged loss, theft or destruction of any such certificate or the issuance of
such new certificate or uncertificated shares. Section

5.3. _Transfers_. Stock of the Corporation shall be transferable in the
manner prescribed by applicable law and in these bylaws. Transfers of stock
shall be made on the books of the Corporation only by the person named in the
certificate or by such persons attorney lawfully constituted in writing and
upon the surrender of the certificate therefore, properly endorsed for
transfer and payment of all necessary transfer taxes; provided, however, that
such surrender and endorsement or payment of taxes shall not be required in
any case in which the officers of the Corporation shall determine to waive
such requirement. Every certificate exchanged, returned, or surrendered to the
Corporation shall be marked "Cancelled," with the date of cancellation, by the
Secretary or Assistant Secretary of the Corporation or the transfer agent
thereof. No transfer of stock shall be valid as against the Corporation for
any purpose until it shall have been entered in the stock records of the
Corporation by an entry showing from and to whom transferred.
