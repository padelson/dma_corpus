Section 5.4 Right to Match

   (1)  | If the Corporation receives an Acquisition Proposal that
constitutes a Superior Proposal after the date of this Agreement, then the
Board may, subject to compliance with Article 7 and Section 8.2, enter into a
definitive written agreement with respect to such Superior Proposal, if and
only if:   
---|--- 
 



     | (a)  | the Person making the Superior Proposal was not restricted
from making such Superior Proposal pursuant to an existing confidentiality,
standstill, non-disclosure, use, business purpose or similar restriction;   
---|---|--- 
 



     | (b)  | the Corporation is not in breach of its obligations in any
material respect under this Article 5;   
---|---|--- 
 



     | (c)  | the Corporation has delivered to the Offeror a written
notice of the determination of the Board that such Acquisition Proposal
constitutes a Superior Proposal and of the intention of the Board to recommend
or approve such Superior Proposal and/or of the Corporation to enter into a
definitive agreement with respect thereto, together with a written notice from
the Board regarding the value that the Board, in consultation with its
financial advisors, has determined should be ascribed to any non-cash
consideration offered under such Acquisition Proposal (the " **Superior
Proposal Notice** ");   
---|---|--- 
 



     | (d)  | the Corporation has provided the Offeror a copy of the
definitive agreement for the Superior Proposal;   
---|---|--- 
 



     | (e)  | at least five Business Days (the " **Matching Period** ")
have elapsed from the date that is the later of (i) the date on which the
Offeror received the Superior Proposal Notice and (ii) the date on which the
Offeror received a copy of the definitive agreement for the Superior
Proposal;   
---|---|--- 
 



     | (f)  | during the Matching Period, the Offeror has had the
opportunity (but not the obligation), in accordance with Section 5.4(2), to
offer to amend in writing this Agreement and the Offer in order for such
Acquisition Proposal to cease to be a Superior Proposal;   
---|---|--- 
 



     | (g)  | after the Matching Period, the Board has determined in
good faith, after consultation with the Corporation's external legal counsel
and financial advisors, that such Acquisition Proposal continues to constitute
a Superior Proposal compared to the terms of the Offer as proposed to be
amended by the Offeror under Section 5.4(2) (if applicable); and   
---|---|--- 
 



     | (h)  | prior to or concurrently with entering into any such
definitive agreement the Corporation terminates this Agreement pursuant to
Section 7.2(1)(c)(ii), and pays or causes to be paid, the Termination Fee
pursuant to Section 8.2.   
---|---|--- 
 



   (2)  | During the Matching Period the Board shall review in good faith
any written offer made by the Offeror under Section 5.4(1)(f) to amend the
terms of this Agreement and the Offer in order to determine whether such
written offer would, upon acceptance, result in the Acquisition Proposal
previously constituting a Superior Proposal ceasing to be a Superior Proposal,
and the Corporation shall negotiate in good faith with the Offeror to make
such amendments to the terms of this Agreement and the Offer as would enable
the Offeror to proceed with the transactions contemplated by this Agreement on
such amended terms. If the Board determines that the Superior Proposal no
longer constitutes a Superior Proposal, the Corporation shall promptly advise
the Offeror, and the Corporation and the Offeror shall enter into an amendment
to this Agreement incorporating the amendments to this Agreement as set out in
the Offeror's written offer made under Section 5.4(1)(f) by the Offeror and
the Corporation will promptly reaffirm its recommendation of the Offer, as
amended, by the prompt issuance of a press release to that effect. The
Corporation shall provide the Offeror and its outside legal counsel with a
reasonable opportunity to review the form and content of any such press
release.   
---|--- 
  27

 

   (3)  | Each successive amendment to any Acquisition Proposal that
results in an increase in or modification of the consideration (or value of
such consideration) to be received by the Shareholders or other modification
to the material terms or conditions of the Acquisition Proposal shall
constitute a new Acquisition Proposal for the purposes of this Section 5.4,
and the Offeror shall be afforded a new five Business Day Matching Period from
the later of the date on which the Offeror received the Superior Proposal
Notice and the date on which the Offeror received all of the materials
contemplated in Section 5.4(1)(d).   
---|--- 
 



   (4)  | The Board shall promptly reaffirm its recommendation of the
Offer by press release after any Acquisition Proposal which is not determined
to be a Superior Proposal is publicly announced or the Board determines that a
proposed amendment to the terms of this Agreement as contemplated under
Section 5.4(2) would result in an Acquisition Proposal no longer being a
Superior Proposal. The Corporation shall provide the Offeror and its outside
legal counsel with a reasonable opportunity to review the form and content of
any such press release.   
---|--- 
 



  

Section 5.5 Breach by Subsidiaries and Representatives

  

Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, the Corporation shall advise
its Subsidiaries and Representatives of the prohibitions set out in this
Article 5 and any violation of the restrictions set forth in this Article 5 by
the Corporation, its Subsidiaries or Representatives is deemed to be a breach
of this Article 5 by the Corporation.

  

Section 5.6 Compliance with Disclosure Obligations

  

Nothing contained in this Agreement shall prohibit the Corporation from
responding through a directors' circular or otherwise (including calling a
meeting of Shareholders in response to a valid requisition under the BCBCA) as
required by Applicable Securities Laws to an Acquisition Proposal, provided
that the Corporation shall provide the Offeror and its legal counsel with a
reasonable opportunity to review the form and content of such circular or
other response before it is sent by the Corporation.

irrevocably waives any right that it may have to raise as a defence that any
such liquidated damages are excessive or punitive. Each Party agrees that the
payment of the Termination Fee or the Reverse Termination Amount, as
applicable, in the manner provided in this Section 8.2 is the sole monetary
remedy, subject to the provisions regarding willful breach set forth in
Section 7.3, of such Party in respect of the event giving rise to such
payment. The Parties shall also have the right to injunctive and other
equitable relief in accordance with Section 8.6 to prevent breaches or

Section 8.6 Injunctive Relief and Special Performance.

   (1)  | The Parties agree that irreparable damage would occur in the
event that any provision of this Agreement were not performed in accordance
with its specific terms or were otherwise breached, and that money damages or
other legal remedies would not be an adequate remedy for any such damages.
Accordingly, the Parties acknowledge and agree that in the event of any breach
or threatened breach by the Corporation, on the one hand, or Offeror, on the
other hand, of any of their respective covenants or obligations set forth in
this Agreement, the Corporation, on the one hand, and Offeror, on the other
hand, shall be entitled to an injunction or injunctions to prevent or restrain
breaches or threatened breaches of this Agreement by the other, and to
specifically enforce the terms and provisions of this Agreement to prevent
breaches or threatened breaches of, or to enforce compliance with, the
covenants and obligations of the other under this Agreement. Each of the
Parties agrees not to raise any objections to the availability of the
equitable remedy of specific performance to prevent or restrain breaches or
threatened breaches of this Agreement by it, and to specifically enforce the
terms and provisions of this Agreement to prevent breaches or threatened
breaches of, or to enforce compliance with, the covenants and obligations of
the other Party under this Agreement. The Parties hereto further agree that
(x) by seeking the remedies provided for in this Section 8.6, a Party shall
not in any respect waive its right to seek any other form of relief that may
be available to a Party under this Agreement in the event that this Agreement
has been terminated or in the event that the remedies provided for in this
Section 8.6 are not available or otherwise are not granted, and (y) nothing
set forth in this Section 8.6 shall require any Party hereto to institute any
proceeding for (or limit any Party's right to institute any proceeding for)
specific performance prior or as a condition to exercising any termination
right under Section 7.2 (and pursuing damages after such termination), nor
shall the commencement of any legal proceeding restrict or limit any Party's
right to terminate this Agreement in accordance with the terms of Section 7.2
or pursue any other remedies under this Agreement that may be available then
or thereafter.   
---|--- 
 



  

Section 8.7 Third Party Beneficiaries.

   (1)  | Except as provided in Section 4.7(4) and which, without
limiting their terms, are intended as stipulations for the benefit of the
Indemnified Persons, the Corporation and the Offeror intend that this
Agreement will not benefit or create any right or cause of action in favour of
any Person, other than the Parties and that no Person, other than the Parties,
shall be entitled to rely on the provisions of this Agreement in any action,
suit, proceeding, hearing or other forum.   
---|--- 
  35

 

   (2)  | Despite the foregoing, the Offeror acknowledges to each of the
Indemnified Persons their direct rights against it under Section 4.7(4),
respectively of this Agreement, which are intended for the benefit of, and
shall be enforceable by, each Indemnified Person, his or her heirs and his or
her legal representatives, and for such purpose, the Corporation confirms that
it is acting as trustee on their behalf, and agrees to enforce such provisions
on their behalf. The Parties reserve their right to vary or rescind the rights
granted by or under this Agreement to any Person who is not a Party, without
notice to or consent of that Person, including any Indemnified Person,
provided such variation or rescission occurs prior to the Effective Date.
