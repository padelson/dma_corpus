_Closing Statement_ "), together with reasonable supporting documentation,
setting forth (i) a good-faith estimate of (A) the Working Capital (such
estimate, the " _Estimated Working Capital_ "), (B) the Closing Cash Amounts
(such estimate, the " _Estimated Closing Cash Amounts_ ") and (C) the Closing
Indebtedness (such estimate, the " _Estimated Closing Indebtedness_ ") and
(ii) Sellers calculation of the Estimated Adjustment Amount. The Closing
Statement shall set forth the calculations of such amounts in accordance with
the Transaction Accounting Principles. Seller shall provide Purchaser with a
reasonable opportunity to review and to propose comments to the Closing
Statement, which Seller shall consider in good faith. The Estimated Working
Capital, the Estimated Adjustment Amount, the Estimated Closing Cash Amount
and the Estimated Closing Indebtedness (in each case as amended as applicable

_provided_ , that Seller shall have no obligation to accept any comments to
the Closing Statement proposed by Purchaser or to amend the Closing Statement
or any of the components thereof) shall be used to calculate the Closing

-28- 

    

(b) As promptly as reasonably practicable, and in any event within one hundred
and twenty (120) days, after the Closing Date, Purchaser shall prepare or
cause to be prepared, and will provide to Seller, a written statement (the "
_Post-Closing Statement_ "), setting forth the Working Capital, the Closing
Cash Amounts, the Closing Indebtedness and the Adjustment Amount. The Post-
Closing Statement shall set forth in reasonable detail the Purchasers
calculations of such amounts and shall be prepared in accordance with the
Transaction Accounting Principles. 

(c) Within forty-five (45) days following receipt by Seller of the Post-
Closing Statement, Seller shall deliver written notice to Purchaser of any
dispute Seller has with respect to the calculation, preparation or content of
the Post-Closing Statement (the " _Dispute Notice_ "); _provided_ , that if
Seller does not deliver any Dispute Notice to Purchaser within such forty-
five (45) day period, the Post-Closing Statement will be final, conclusive and
binding on the parties hereto. The Dispute Notice shall set forth in
reasonable detail (i) any item on the Post-Closing Statement that
Seller disputes and the grounds for such dispute, together with reasonable
supporting documentation, and (ii) Sellers estimate of the correct amount of
such item; _provided_ that Seller shall be deemed to have agreed with all
other items and amounts on the Post-Closing Statement. Upon receipt by
Purchaser of a Dispute Notice, Purchaser and Seller shall negotiate in good
faith to resolve any dispute set forth therein. If Purchaser and Seller fail
to resolve any such dispute within thirty (30) days after delivery of the
Dispute Notice (the " _Dispute Resolution Period_ "), then Purchaser and
Seller jointly shall engage, within ten (10) Business Days following the
expiration of the Dispute Resolution Period, KPMG LLP or, if KPMG LLP is
unavailable or conflicted, another nationally recognized major accounting firm
selected jointly by Seller and Purchaser (the " _Independent Accounting Firm_
") to resolve any such dispute;  _provided_ , that, if Seller and Purchaser
are unable to agree on the Independent Accounting Firm, then each of Seller
and Purchaser shall select a nationally recognized major accounting firm, and
the two (2) firms will mutually select a third nationally recognized major
accounting firm to serve as the Independent Accounting Firm. As promptly as
practicable, and in any event not more than fifteen (15) days following the
engagement of the Independent Accounting Firm, Purchaser and Seller shall
each prepare and submit a presentation detailing each partys complete
statement of proposed resolution of each item on the Dispute Notice still in
dispute to the Independent Accounting Firm. Purchaser and Seller shall
instruct the Independent Accounting Firm to, as soon as practicable after the
submission of the presentations described in the immediately preceding
sentence and in any event not more than twenty (20) days following such
presentations, make a final determination, binding on the parties to this
Agreement, of the appropriate amount of each of the line items that remain in
dispute as indicated in the Dispute Notice. The Independent Accounting Firm
shall make such final determination based solely on the terms and conditions
of this Agreement and the written submissions of Purchaser, on the one hand,
and Seller, on the other hand, regarding the appropriate amount of each of the
line items that remain in dispute as indicated in the Dispute Notice which
Seller and Purchaser have submitted to the Independent Accounting Firm. With
respect to each disputed line item, such determination, if not in accordance
with the position of either Seller or Purchaser, shall not be in excess of
the higher, nor less than the lower, of the amounts advocated by Seller or
Purchaser, as applicable, in their respective presentations to the Independent
Accounting Firm described

 



-29- 

    

 above. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the scope of the disputes to be
resolved by the Independent Accounting Firm shall be limited to the disputed
line items submitted to the Independent Accounting Firm by Purchaser and
Seller and whether any disputed determinations of the Working Capital, the
Adjustment Amount, the Closing Cash Amounts and the Closing Indebtedness were
properly calculated in accordance with the Transaction Accounting Principles
and the definitions in this Agreement. Absent fraud or manifest error, all
determinations made by the Independent Accounting Firm, and the Post-Closing
Statement, as modified by the Independent Accounting Firm, shall be
final, conclusive and binding on the parties hereto. The parties hereto agree
that any adjustment as determined pursuant to this _Section_ __ _ 2.9(c)_
shall be treated as an adjustment to the Purchase Price, except as otherwise
required by Law.

(d) All fees and expenses relating to the work, if any, to be performed by the
Independent Accounting Firm shall be borne by Seller and Purchaser in
proportion to the allocation of the dollar value of the amounts in dispute
between Seller and Purchaser resolved by the Independent Accounting Firm, such
that the Party prevailing on the greatest dollar value of such disputes pays
the lesser proportion of the fees. For example, should the items in dispute
total $1,000 and the Independent Accounting Firm awards $600 in favor of
Sellers position, then 60% of the costs of its review would be borne by
Purchaser and 40% of the costs of its review would be borne by Seller.

(e) For purposes of complying with the terms set forth in this  _Section_ __
_ 2.9_, each of Seller and Purchaser shall reasonably cooperate with and make
available to each other and their respective Representatives all information,
records, data and working papers, in each case to the extent relevant to
preparation of the Closing Statement or the Post-Closing Statement, as
applicable, and shall permit reasonable access during normal working hours to
the personnel that were involved in the preparation of the Closing Statement
or the Post-Closing Statement, as applicable, as may be reasonably required
in connection with the preparation and analysis of the Post-Closing Statement
and the resolution of any disputes thereunder.

 

(f) The " _Final Purchase Price_ " shall mean the Base Purchase Price, _plus_
(i) the Adjustment Amount (which may be a positive or negative number),
_plus_ (ii) the Closing Cash Amounts, _minus_ (iii) the Closing Indebtedness,
in each of cases (i), (ii) and (iii), as finally determined pursuant to
_Sections 2.9(b)_ and _2.9(c)_.

 

(g) If the Closing Purchase Price exceeds the Final Purchase Price, then
Seller shall pay or cause to be paid an amount in cash equal to such excess
to Purchaser by wire transfer of immediately available funds to an account or
accounts designated in writing by Purchaser to Seller; and if the Final
Purchase Price exceeds the Closing Purchase Price, then Purchaser shall pay or
cause to be paid an amount in cash equal to such excess to Seller by wire
transfer of immediately available funds to an account or accounts designated
in writing by Seller to Purchaser. Any payment required to be made pursuant to
this  _Section_ __ _ 2.9(g)_ shall be made within five (5) Business Days of
the date on which the Adjustment Amount, Closing Cash Amounts and Closing
Indebtedness are finally determined pursuant to this  _Section_ __ _ 2.9_.

 



-30- 

    

(h) No actions taken by Purchaser or any of its Affiliates on its own behalf
or on behalf of any Purchased Company on or following the Closing Date shall
be given effect for purposes of determining the Adjustment Amount (or any
other items contained in the Post-Closing Statement), and the determination of
the Final Purchase Price shall not take into account any developments or
events taking place after the Closing. Purchaser agrees that, following the
Closing through the date that the Post-Closing Statement becomes final,
conclusive and binding in accordance with this  _Section_ __ _ 2.9_, it will
not take or permit to be taken any actions with respect to any accounting
books, records, policies or procedures that would impede the final
determination of the Adjustment Amount, the Closing Cash Amounts or the
Closing Indebtedness or the preparation of any Dispute Notice.

Section 2.10 _Purchase Price Allocation_. Seller and Purchaser agree to
allocate and, as applicable, to cause their relevant Affiliates to allocate,
the Purchase Price (as finally determined pursuant to _Section_ __ _ 2.9_)
and any other items that are treated as additional consideration for Tax
purposes among the Purchased Assets (including among the assets of any
Purchased Company that is disregarded as separate from its owner for U.S.
federal income tax purposes) in accordance with the methodology set forth on 
_Exhibit E_ attached hereto (the " _Allocation Schedule_ ") for U.S. federal
income tax purposes. No later than one hundred and eighty (180) days after the
date on which the Purchase Price is finally determined pursuant to  _Section_
__ _ 2.9_, Purchaser shall deliver to Seller a proposed allocation of the
Purchase Price (as finally determined pursuant to _Section_ __ _ 2.9_) and
any other items that are treated as additional consideration for Tax purposes
as of the Closing Date determined in a manner consistent with the Allocation
Schedule, Section 1060 of the Code and the Treasury Regulations promulgated
thereunder (the " _Purchaser s Allocation_"). If Seller disagrees with
Purchasers Allocation, Seller may, within thirty (30) days after delivery of
Purchasers Allocation, deliver a written notice (the " _Seller s Allocation
Notice_") to Purchaser to such effect, specifying those items as to which
Seller disagrees and setting forth Sellers proposed allocation. If the
Sellers Allocation Notice is duly delivered, Seller and Purchaser shall,
during the twenty (20) days following such delivery, use commercially
reasonable efforts to reach agreement on the disputed items or amounts in
order to determine the allocation of the Purchase Price (as finally determined
pursuant to _Section_ __ _ 2.9_) and any other items that are treated as
additional consideration for Tax purposes. If Seller and Purchaser are unable
to reach such agreement, they shall promptly thereafter cause the Independent
Accounting Firm to resolve any remaining disputes. All fees and expenses
relating to the work, if any, to be performed by the Independent Accounting
Firm shall be borne equally by Seller and Purchaser. Any allocation of the
Purchase Price (as finally determined pursuant to  _Section_ __ _ 2.9_) and
any other items that are treated as additional consideration for Tax purposes
determined pursuant to the decision of the Independent Accounting Firm shall
incorporate, reflect and be consistent with the Allocation Schedule. The
allocation, as prepared by Purchaser if no Sellers Allocation Notice has been
given, as adjusted pursuant to any agreement between Seller and Purchaser or
as determined by the Independent Accounting Firm in accordance with the
immediately preceding sentence (the " _Allocation_ "), shall be conclusive and
binding on the Parties for U.S. federal, state and local income or franchise
tax purposes. Neither Seller nor Purchaser shall (and shall cause
their respective Affiliates not to) take any position inconsistent with the
Allocation on any U.S. federal, state and local income or franchise Tax
Return; _provided_ , that Seller, Purchaser (and their respective Affiliates)
may file an amended Tax Return that is inconsistent with the Allocation to
the extent required in connection with the resolution of an Internal Revenue
Service audit or other similar Tax Proceeding, in which case such Party shall
promptly notify the other Party in writing of the position reflected on such
amended Tax Return.

Section 2.11 _Non-Assignment_ _; Consents_. (a) Notwithstanding anything in
this Agreement to the contrary, this Agreement shall not constitute an
agreement to sell, assign, transfer or convey any Purchased Asset or Assumed
Liability if an attempted sale, assignment, transfer or conveyance thereof
would be prohibited by Law or would, without the approval, authorization or
consent of, filing with, notification to, or granting or issuance of any
license, order, waiver or permit by, any third party or Governmental Entity
(collectively, " _Approvals_ " and such assets, collectively, the " _Non-
Assignable Assets_"), (i) constitute a breach or other contravention thereof,
or result in any acceleration of obligations of any Seller Entities or the
exercise of rights or remedies by any counterparty, including rights of
recapture or termination (including in the case of any request for approval or
consent, in which case no such request shall be made without the agreement of
the Parties), or (ii) be ineffective, void or voidable or materially and
adversely affect the rights thereunder of the Seller Entities, the Purchased
Companies, Purchaser, or any of their respective Affiliates. It is understood
and agreed that the obtainment of any Non-Regulatory Approvals (as defined
below) is not a condition to the Closing and that, in the absence of
such Non-Regulatory Approvals, the Closing shall proceed in accordance with
this Agreement and Purchaser shall pay the full Closing Purchase Price at the
Closing without the sale, assignment, conveyance, transfer or delivery of any
resulting Non-Assignable Assets.

(b) Prior to the Closing and continuing for a period of eighteen (18) months
from and after the Closing Date, Seller and Purchaser shall use reasonable
best efforts to provide any notices and to obtain, or cause to be obtained,
any Approval (other than Regulatory Approvals, which shall be governed by
_Section_ __ _ 5.1_) (collectively, the " _Non-Regulatory Approvals_")
required to sell, assign or transfer any Purchased Asset and to obtain the
unconditional release of Seller and its Affiliates from all obligations
contemplated by _Section_ __ _ 2.11(c)_. If any Non-Assignable Asset cannot
or, pursuant to this  _Section_ __ _ 2.11_, is not required to, be assigned,
transferred or conveyed at Closing, until the earliest of (i) such time as
such applicable Approval or Approvals are obtained, (ii) such time as such
Approval or Approvals have been denied in writing, (iii) eighteen (18) months
after the Closing Date and (iv) with respect to a Purchased Asset that is a
Contract, the expiration of the term of such Contract in accordance with its
current term or the execution of a replacement Contract following the Closing
by Purchaser or its Affiliate, then Seller shall cooperate with Purchaser to
the extent permitted by such Contract and applicable Law, in any arrangement
reasonably acceptable to Purchaser and Seller intended to both (x) provide
Purchaser, to the fullest extent practicable, the claims, rights and benefits
of any such Non-Assignable Assets and (y) cause Purchaser to assume and bear
all Assumed Liabilities under such Non-Assignable Assets from and after the
Closing in accordance with this Agreement (including by means of any
subcontracting, sublicensing or subleasing arrangement). Seller shall
promptly pay (or cause to be paid) to Purchaser when received all monies
received by Seller or any of its Affiliates under any Non-Assignable Asset or
any claim or right or any benefit arising thereunder, except to the extent
the same represents an Excluded Asset.

(c) Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, neither Seller nor
Purchaser shall have any obligation under this Agreement or otherwise to pay
any consent, approval or waiver "fee," discount, rebate or any money or other
consideration beyond administrative costs and its attorneys fees to any
Person, agree to any modification or amendment of or any concession to any
counterparty to any Contract, or to initiate any claim or Proceeding against
any Person in order to obtain any Non-Regulatory Approvals.

 



-32- 

    

(d) Any Contract to which Seller or any of its Affiliates is a party that is
not exclusively related to the Business and that relates to both the Business
and any Other Seller Business (each, a " _Shared Contract_ ") shall be (x)
assigned, transferred and conveyed only with respect to (and preserving the
meaning of) those portions that relate exclusively to the Business, to either
a Purchased Company or Purchaser or one of its Affiliates, if so assignable,
transferable or conveyable, or (y) appropriately amended prior to, on or after
the Closing (and, if necessary or deemed reasonably advisable by Seller or
Purchaser, new Contracts with respect thereto shall be executed), so that the
applicable Purchased Company, Purchaser or one of its Affiliates shall be
entitled to the rights and benefit of those parts of the Shared Contract that
relate exclusively to the Business and shall assume the related portion of any
Assumed Liabilities contemplated by this Agreement. Unless otherwise agreed by
Purchaser (in its sole discretion) such amendments and new Contracts shall be
on pricing terms not materially less favorable (individually or in the
aggregate) to the terms applicable to the Business under the associated Shared
Contract and shall otherwise be on terms and conditions not materially
less favorable (individually or in the aggregate) to Purchaser than the terms
and conditions applicable to the Business under the associated Shared
Contract. Notwithstanding the foregoing, (i) in no event shall any Person be
required to assign (or amend), either in its entirety or in part, any Shared
Contract that is a Non-Assignable Asset and (ii) if any Shared Contract is a
Non-Assignable Asset and cannot be so partially assigned (or amended) at
Closing, until the earliest of (A) such time as the applicable Approval is
obtained or denied in writing, (B) eighteen (18) months after the Closing Date
and (C) the expiration of the term of such Shared Contract in accordance with
its current term or the execution of a replacement Contract following the
Closing by Purchaser or its Affiliate, then Seller will cooperate with
Purchaser to establish an agency type or other similar arrangement reasonably
satisfactory to Seller and Purchaser intended to both (x) provide Purchaser,
to the fullest extent practicable under such Shared Contract, the claims,
rights and benefits of those portions that relate exclusively to the Business
and (y) cause Purchaser to bear all Assumed Liabilities thereunder from and
after the Closing in accordance with this Agreement (including by means of any
subcontracting, sublicensing or subleasing arrangement). Seller shall
promptly pay (or cause to be paid) to Purchaser when received all monies
received by Seller or any of its Affiliates under any Shared Contract that is
a Non-Assignable Asset or any claim or right or any benefit
arising thereunder, except to the extent the same represents an Excluded
Asset.

(e) For so long as the Seller Entities hold any Purchased Assets or are
parties to any Shared Contracts and provide Purchaser any claims, rights and
benefits of any such Purchased Asset or Shared Contract pursuant to an
arrangement described in _Section_ __ _ 2.11(b)_ or  _Section_ __ _
2.11(d)_, Purchaser shall indemnify and hold harmless Seller, such Seller
Entities and their respective Affiliates from and against all Losses incurred
or asserted as a result of Sellers or any such Affiliates or their
respective Affiliates post-Closing direct or indirect ownership, management
or operation of any such Purchased Assets or Shared Contracts (only to the
extent that such Losses relate to the Business and are with respect to
Assumed Liabilities). Notwithstanding anything contained herein to the
contrary, any transfer or assignment to Purchaser of any Purchased Asset or
any part of a Shared Contract that shall require an Approval as described
above in this  _Section_ __ _ 2.11_ shall be made subject to such Approval
being obtained.

 



-33- 

    

Section 2.12 _Bulk Sales Waiver_. Purchaser and its Affiliates acknowledge
that the Seller Entities have not taken, and do not intend to take, any
actions required to comply with any applicable "bulk transfer law" or "bulk
sales law" (or similar) of any jurisdiction. Purchaser and its Affiliates
waive compliance by the Seller Entities with the provisions of any "bulk
transfer law" or "bulk sales law" (or any similar law) of any jurisdiction in
connection with the transactions contemplated by this Agreement.

information supplied by such party to, or correspondence with, a Governmental
Entity in connection with this Agreement, the Transaction and the other

to this Agreement and the Transaction or the other transactions contemplated
by this Agreement, and furnish the other party with such necessary information
and reasonable assistance as the other party may reasonably request
in connection with its preparation of filings or submissions of information
to any such Governmental Entity. Notwithstanding anything in this 
_Section_ __ _ 5.1(b)_ to the contrary, Purchaser and Seller may, as each
reasonably deems advisable and necessary, reasonably designate any
competitively sensitive material provided to the other under this _Section_ __

__ _ 5.1(b)_ may be redacted (i) to remove references concerning the

transactions contemplated hereby, including using reasonable best efforts to
take all such further action as may be necessary to resolve such objections,
if any, as any Governmental Entity or any other Person may assert under any
Antitrust Law with respect to the transactions contemplated hereby, so as to
enable the Closing to occur as soon as reasonably possible (and in any event
no later than the Outside Date). In furtherance (and not in limitation) of
the foregoing sentence, Purchaser shall proffer to, or agree to, sell, divest,
lease, license, transfer, dispose of or otherwise encumber or hold separate

divestiture, lease, license, transfer, disposition or other encumbering by
the Seller Entities of any of assets of the Business or to any agreement by
any of the Seller Entities to take any of the foregoing actions) and to agree
to make any material changes (including through a licensing arrangement)
or restriction on, or other impairment of Purchasers ability to own or
operate, of any such assets, licenses, product lines, businesses or interests
therein or Purchasers ability to vote, transfer, receive dividends, or
otherwise exercise full ownership rights with respect to ownership interests
in the Business or of Purchaser. To assist Purchaser in complying with its
obligations set forth in this _Section_ __ _ 5.1_, at the written request of
Purchaser, Seller shall, and shall cause its Subsidiaries to, enter into one
or more agreements requested by Purchaser to be entered into by any of them

any material respect with any press release or public statement previously
issued or made by either Party in accordance with this Section 5.5.

Section 5.6 _Intercompany Accounts and Intercompany Arrangements_. Prior to
the Closing all intercompany balances and accounts (other than the

associated with obtaining and exercising any rights under the Purchaser RandW
Insurance Policy, including the premium, broker fee, underwriting fee, due
diligence fee, carrier commissions, legal fees for counsel engaged by the

nothing in this Agreement is intended to, nor shall it have the effect of,
limiting or diminishing Purchasers (or its Affiliates and their respective

assignees) or any other Persons right to seek or obtain recovery under the

by _Section_ __ _ 5.8(a)(i)_ contingent on such Leave Recipients return to

period as may be required by applicable Law. When a Leave Recipient who has
accepted such offer and returns to active status pursuant to the terms hereof,
such Leave Recipient shall be considered a Transferred Business Employee or
Represented Transferred Business Employee, as applicable. For the avoidance of
doubt, until such time as a Leave Recipient becomes a Transferred Business
Employee or Represented Transferred Business Employee, as applicable, by
accepting Purchasers offer of employment and returning to active status
pursuant to the terms hereof, Purchaser shall not have any Liability with
respect to severance or any other amounts payable to such Leave Recipient and

result of a leave of absence becomes actively employed by Purchaser, Purchaser
shall not have any Liability with respect to severance or any other amounts
payable to such Leave Recipient and Seller, the Seller Entities and their

amounts based on target performance and paid by Seller as soon as practicable
after the Closing Date, and in any event within sixty (60) days after the
Closing Date. Purchaser shall provide each Transferred Business Employee who

of the Closing, which prorated portion shall equal: (A) the product of (1) the
number of shares of Seller common stock (" _Seller Shares_ ") underlying such
Seller Equity Award on the date of grant thereof, together with the total
number of Seller Shares underlying any dividend equivalent units credited with
respect to such Seller Equity Award, multiplied by (2) a fraction, the
numerator of which is the number of days between the grant date of such Seller
Equity Award and the Closing Date, and the denominator of which is the total
number of days in the vesting period applicable to such Seller Equity Award,
less (B) the number of Seller Shares underlying such Seller Equity Award,
including the Seller Shares underlying any dividend equivalent units credited
on such Seller Equity Award, that vested prior to the accelerated vesting
provided for in this _Section_ __ _ 5.8(k)_. The portion of each Seller

employees of Purchaser and its Affiliates, Purchaser will grant to each
Transferred Business Employee who held equity grants in Seller immediately
prior to Closing a one-time cash long-term incentive award with a value equal
to the applicable Transferred Business Employees grant factor (i.e., the
percentage of his or her base compensation as historically used by Seller to
determine his or her equity award value). Each such award will vest based on
terms and conditions as determined by Purchaser; _provided_ that such terms
are no less favorable than the terms and conditions applicable to long-term
incentive awards granted to similarly situated employees of Purchaser and its
Affiliates (other than the Transferred Business Employees) and which such
terms currently provide that (A) at least 30% of the award will vest based on
continued service in equal installments over three years and (B) not more than
70% of the award will vest based on continued service and performance-based
vesting. The offer of employment delivered to each such Transferred Business

for the benefit of the Parties and no current or former employee, director or
independent contractor or any other individual associated therewith shall be
regarded for any purpose as a third-party beneficiary of this Agreement, and

authority of Seller or Purchaser or any of their respective Affiliates to
amend or terminate any Benefit Plan or other employee benefit plan.

 

Section 5.9 _Financial Obligations_. At or prior to the Closing, Purchaser and

obligations to replace (or backstop in a manner satisfactory to Seller,
acting reasonably) the outstanding letters of credit, surety bonds, security
deposits, guarantees and other contractual obligations entered into by or on
behalf of Seller, any Seller Entity or any of their respective Affiliates
(other than the Purchased Companies) to the extent relating to the Business,
the Purchased Assets or the Assumed Liabilities listed on Section 5.9 of the
Seller Disclosure Schedules (together, the " _Guarantees_ ") or (b) to the
extent permitted by applicable Law and the terms thereof, cause Purchaser to
assume all obligations (solely to the extent relating to the Business) under
each Guarantee, and use reasonable best efforts to obtain from the creditor,
lessor or sublessor or other counterparty a full and irrevocable release (a "
_Release_ ") of Seller and its Affiliates that are liable, directly or
indirectly, for reimbursement to the creditor or fulfillment of other
Liabilities to a counterparty in connection with the Guarantees; _provided_
that Purchaser shall not be obligated to contribute any capital or pay any
consideration in any form. To the extent the beneficiary or counterparty under
any Guarantee does not accept any such substitute letter of credit, Purchaser
guarantee or other obligation proffered by Purchaser and Purchaser is not
permitted to assume or cause to be assumed any such Guarantee in accordance
with the foregoing clause (b), Purchaser shall indemnify and hold
harmless Seller and its Affiliates against, and reimburse Seller and its
Affiliates for, any and all related Losses actually paid by Seller or its
Affiliates under such Guarantee (in each case, solely to the extent relating
to the Business and except to the extent Seller is otherwise reimbursed or
indemnified by a third party for such Losses). Notwithstanding anything to the
contrary in this Agreement, the Parties acknowledge that that the failure to
obtain any Release or replacement Guarantee or other security shall not be a
breach of this Agreement or any other Transaction Document by Purchaser or any
of its Affiliates and that the obtaining of any such Release or replacement
Guarantee or other security shall in no event be a condition to Sellers
obligation to consummate the transactions contemplated by this Agreement and
the other Transaction Documents.

Closing Date (" _Exceptions_ "), or (ii) cause the title insurance company to

transferred or assumed by the applicable Local Transfer Agreement (which
transfers and assumptions shall, except as otherwise expressly set forth

Affiliates) hereunder in a manner consistent with the terms of this
Agreement. All such claims (except as referred to above) shall be brought in
accordance with, and be subject to the provisions, rights and limitations set

or obtain payment, reimbursement, restitution or indemnity under or pursuant
to any of the Local Transfer Agreements.

_Section_ __ _ 8.2(b)_;

 

(c) by Purchaser, if any of Sellers representations and warranties contained
in _Article_ __ _ III_ shall fail to be true and correct or Seller shall

breach would give rise to the failure of a condition set forth in  _Section_
__ _ 8.2(a)_ or _Section_ __ _ 8.2(b)_ and is not curable by the Outside
Date or has not been cured by the earlier of (i) the date that is thirty (30)

that the right to terminate this Agreement under this _Section_ __ _ 9.1(d)_
shall not be available to any party whose failure to perform any material
covenant or obligation under this Agreement has been the cause of, or resulted

Party from any Liability for fraud or Willful Breach by such party of the
terms and provisions of this Agreement.

or control of the Business or any of the Purchased Companies prior to the
Closing, any of their respective assets, or any actions or omissions at or
prior to the Closing, whether by the enforcement of any assessment or by any
legal or equitable proceeding, or by virtue of any statute, regulation or
other applicable Law. From and after the Closing, except for any rights or
obligations of Purchaser under this Agreement or any other Transaction
Document and other than in connection with any fraud or Willful Breach,
Purchaser (on behalf of the Purchaser Parties) hereby waives, to the fullest
extent permitted by Law, any and all rights, claims and causes of action
against, and shall have no recourse of any kind to, the Seller Parties under
any theory of law or equity, including under any control person liability
theory, in respect of any cause, matter or thing relating to any of the
Purchased Companies or the Business, or their respective Affiliates,
officers, directors, equityholders, managers, employees, agents, or
Representatives, or any actions taken or failed to be taken by any of the
Seller Parties in any capacity relating to the Business, the Purchased
Assets, the Assumed Liabilities or the Purchased Companies, in each case
occurring or arising prior to the Closing.

(c) Seller (on behalf of itself and each of the other Seller Parties) agrees
that, except as otherwise provided in _Section_ __ _ 10.1_ and other than in
connection with any fraud or Willful Breach, from and after the Closing, under
no circumstances will any of the Purchaser Parties have any liability to any
of the Seller Parties for any Losses relating to or arising from any actual
or alleged breach of any representation or warranty or any covenant or
agreement set forth in this Agreement to have been performed by its terms at
or prior to the Closing (or in any Exhibit, Schedule or certificate delivered
hereunder) or in connection with the Transaction, including by virtue of or

statute, regulation or other applicable Law. From and after the Closing,
except for any rights or obligations of Seller under this Agreement or any
other Transaction Document and other than in connection with any fraud or
Willful Breach, Seller (on behalf of the Seller Parties) hereby waives, to
the fullest extent permitted by Law, any and all rights, claims and causes of
action against, and shall have no recourse of any kind to, the Purchaser

liability theory, in respect of any cause, matter or thing relating to any of

Representatives, or any actions taken or failed to be taken by any of the
Purchaser Parties in any capacity relating to the Business, the Purchased
Assets, the Assumed Liabilities or the Purchased Companies, in each case
occurring or arising prior to the Closing.

 

(d) The Parties hereto agree that limits imposed on remedies with respect to
the Transaction, the other transactions contemplated hereby and this
Agreement in this _Section_ __ _ 10.2_ constitute an integral part of the

the " _Purchaser Indemnified Parties_ "), from and against any and all Losses
incurred or suffered by any of the Purchaser Indemnified Parties, to the
extent arising out of or resulting from (a) any breach of any covenants or
agreements of Seller contained in this Agreement and (b) any Excluded Asset or

Agreement and (b) any Purchased Asset or Assumed Liability.

 



-87- 

    

Section 10.5 _Procedures_.

 

(a) A Person that may be entitled to be indemnified under this Agreement (the
" _Indemnified Party_ ") shall promptly notify the party or parties liable
for such indemnification (the " _Indemnifying Party_ ") in writing of any
pending or threatened claim or demand that the Indemnified Party has
determined has given or would reasonably be expected to give rise to such
right of indemnification (including a pending or threatened claim or demand
asserted by a third party against the Indemnified Party, such claim being a "
_Third Party Claim_ "), describing in reasonable detail (taking into
account the information then available to the Indemnified Party) the facts
and circumstances with respect to the subject matter of such claim or demand;
_provided_ , that the failure to provide such notice shall not release the
Indemnifying Party from any of its obligations under this _Article_ __ _ X_
except to the extent that the Indemnifying Party is materially prejudiced by
such failure (as determined by a court of competent jurisdiction), it being
agreed that notices for claims in respect of a breach of a covenant or
agreement must be delivered prior to the expiration of any applicable survival
period specified in Section 10.1 for such covenant or agreement.

 

(b) Upon receipt of a notice of a Third Party Claim for indemnity from an
Indemnified Party pursuant to _Section_ __ _ 10.3_ or _Section_ __ _ 10.4_,
the Indemnifying Party will be entitled, by notice to the Indemnified Party
delivered within twenty (20) Business Days of the receipt of notice of such
Third Party Claim, to assume the defense and control of such Third Party
Claim (at the expense of such Indemnifying Party); _provided_ , that the
Indemnifying Party shall not be entitled to assume the defense and control of
such Third Party Claim if (i) the Indemnifying Party does not acknowledge
that it would have an indemnity obligation for the Losses resulting from such
Third Party Claim as provided under this Article X within thirty (30) days of
receipt of notice of such Third Party Claim, (ii) the Third Party
Claim relates to or arises in connection with any criminal Proceeding, (iii)
the Third Party Claim seeks an injunction or equitable relief against the
Indemnified Party or any of its Affiliates or (iv) the Indemnifying Party has
failed or is failing to prosecute or defend vigorously the Third Party Claim;
_provided_ , _further_ , that if the Indemnifying Party assumes the defense
and control of such Third Party Claim, the Indemnifying Party shall allow the
Indemnified Party a reasonable opportunity to participate in the defense of
such Third Party Claim with its own counsel and at its own expense; _provided_
, _further_ , that the Indemnified Party shall be entitled to participate in
any such defense with its own counsel at the expense of the Indemnifying
Party if (i) so requested by the Indemnifying Party to participate or (ii) the
Indemnifying Party reasonably believes that, based on the advice of counsel to
the Indemnified Party, a conflict or potential conflict exists between the
Indemnified Party and the Indemnifying Party that would make such separate
representation advisable. If the Indemnifying Party does not assume the
defense and control of any Third Party Claim pursuant to this  _Section_ __ _
10.5(b)_, the Indemnified Party shall be entitled to assume and control such
defense, but the Indemnifying Party may nonetheless participate in the defense
of such Third Party Claim with its own counsel and at its own expense.
Purchaser or Seller, as the case may be, shall, and shall cause each of its
Affiliates and Representatives to, reasonably cooperate with the Indemnifying
Party in the defense of any Third Party Claim, including by 

 



-88- 

    

 furnishing books and records, personnel and witnesses, as appropriate for
any defense of such Third Party Claim. If the Indemnifying Party has assumed
the defense and control of a Third Party Claim, it shall be authorized to
consent to a settlement or compromise of, or the entry of any Judgment arising
from, any Third Party Claim, in its sole discretion and without the consent of
any Indemnified Party; _provided_ , that such settlement or Judgment does not
involve any injunctive or other equitable relief with respect to any
Indemnified Party or finding or admission of any violation of Law or admission
of any wrongdoing by any Indemnified Party or any of its Affiliates and
expressly unconditionally releases the Indemnified Party and its Affiliates
from all Liabilities with respect to such Third Party Claim. No Indemnified
Party shall consent to the entry of any Judgment or enter into any settlement
or compromise with respect to a Third Party Claim without the prior written
consent of the Indemnifying Party, not to be unreasonably withheld,
conditioned or delayed.

 

(c) Upon receipt of a notice of a claim for indemnity from an Indemnified
Party pursuant to _Section_ __ _ 10.3_ or  _Section_ __ _ 10.4_ that does
not involve a Third Party Claim, if the Indemnifying Party does not notify the
Indemnified Party within 30 days following the receipt of such notice that the
Indemnifying Party disputes its indemnity obligation to the Indemnified Party
for any Losses with respect to such claim, such Losses shall be conclusively
deemed a Liability of the Indemnifying Party and the Indemnifying Party shall
promptly pay to the Indemnified Party any and all Losses arising out of or
resulting from such claim. If the Indemnifying Party has timely disputed its
indemnity obligation for any Losses with respect to such claim, the parties
shall proceed in good faith to negotiate a resolution of such dispute and,
if not resolved through negotiations, such dispute shall be resolved by
litigation in an appropriate court of jurisdiction determined pursuant to
_Section_ __ _ 11.7_.

 

(d) Notwithstanding any of the foregoing, each of Seller and Purchaser (each a
" _Relevant Party_ ") shall have the exclusive right to control in all
respects, and neither the other party (the " _Other Party_ ") nor any of its
Affiliates shall be entitled to participate in, any Tax Proceeding with
respect to any Tax Return of (i) the Relevant Party or any of its Affiliates
or (ii) a consolidated, combined or unitary group that includes the Relevant
Party or any of its Affiliates; _provided_ that solely for purposes of this
_Section_ __ _ 10.5(d)_ each Purchased Company shall not be considered an
Affiliate of the Purchaser with respect to any Tax Proceeding regarding a Tax
Return for a Pre-Closing Period.

 

Section 10.6 _Additional Indemnification Provisions_. With respect to each
indemnification obligation contained in this Agreement, all Losses shall be
(x) net of any (a) Tax benefits actually realized (within one (1) Tax year of
the incurrence of such Loss) by the Indemnified Party in respect of a
deduction for such Loss and (b) third-party insurance or indemnity,
contribution or similar proceeds that have been recovered by the Indemnified
Party in connection with the facts giving rise to the right of indemnification
(it being agreed that if third-party insurance or indemnification,
contribution or similar proceeds in respect of such facts are recovered by
the Indemnified Party subsequent to the Indemnifying Partys making of an
indemnification payment in satisfaction of its applicable indemnification
obligation, such proceeds (net of any expenses incurred to recover such
amounts and any resulting increase in premiums) shall be promptly remitted to
the Indemnifying Party to the extent of the indemnification payment made), and
the Indemnified Party shall use, and cause its Affiliates to use,
commercially reasonable efforts to seek full recovery under all insurance and
indemnity,

 



-89- 

    

 contribution or similar provisions covering such Loss to the same extent as
it would if such Loss were not subject to indemnification hereunder and (y)
increased by any Tax costs of the Indemnified Party resulting from such Loss
or the indemnification of such Loss. Upon making any payment to the
Indemnified Party for any indemnification claim pursuant to this _Article_ __
_ X_, the Indemnifying Party shall be subrogated, to the extent of such
payment, to any rights which the Indemnified Party may have against any third
party insurers with respect to the subject matter underlying such
indemnification claim, and the Indemnified Party shall assign any such rights
to the Indemnifying Party upon the written request of the Indemnifying Party.

Section 10.7 _Mitigation_. Each of the parties hereto agrees to use its
commercially reasonable efforts to mitigate its respective Losses upon and
after becoming aware of any event or condition that would reasonably be
expected to give rise to any Losses that are indemnifiable hereunder. 

Section 10.8 _Tax_ _Indemnification Matters_. Notwithstanding anything to the
contrary in this  _Article_ __ _ X_, the above provisions of this _Article_
__ _ X_ (other than _Sections_ _10.5_ _10.6_ , and _10.7_ ) shall not apply
to Tax indemnification matters, which shall instead be governed exclusively
by _Article_ __ _ VII_ and _Sections_ _10.5,_ _10.6_ , and _10.7_.

no event shall Purchaser grant or otherwise confer any subrogation rights to
any such insurer(s) or underwriter(s) against Seller, the Seller Entities or
their respective Affiliates or Representatives (except in the event of
fraud)); _provided_ , _further_ , that no such assignment referred to in

the other hand, may waive compliance by the other with any term or provision
of this Agreement that the other party was or is obligated to comply with or

or provision shall not operate as a waiver of, or estoppel with respect to,
any subsequent or other failure of compliance.

Section 11.6 _Specific Performance_. The parties hereto agree that irreparable
damage, for which monetary damages (even if available) would not be an
adequate remedy, would occur in the event that the parties hereto do not
perform any provision of this Agreement in accordance with its specified terms
or otherwise breach such provisions. Accordingly, the parties
hereto acknowledge and agree that the parties hereto shall be entitled to an
injunction, specific performance and other equitable relief to prevent
breaches of this Agreement and to enforce specifically the terms and
provisions hereof, in addition to any other remedy to which they are entitled
in Law or in equity. Each of the parties hereto agrees that it will not oppose
the granting of an injunction, specific performance or other equitable relief
on the basis that the other party has an adequate remedy at Law or that any
award of specific performance is not an appropriate remedy for any reason at
Law or in equity. Any party hereto seeking an injunction or injunctions to
prevent breaches of this Agreement and to enforce specifically the terms and
provisions of this Agreement shall not be required to provide any bond or
other security in connection with such order or injunction.

would cause the application of the Laws of any jurisdiction other than the
State of Delaware. In addition, each of the parties hereto (a) submits to the
exclusive personal jurisdiction of any state or federal court sitting in the
Court of Chancery of the State of Delaware (or, if the Chancery Court of the
State of Delaware declines to accept jurisdiction over a particular matter,
any state or federal court within the State of Delaware) (and, in the case of
appeals, appropriate appellate courts therefrom), in the event that any
dispute (whether in contract, tort or otherwise) arises out of or in
connection with the evaluation (including due diligence), negotiation,
execution or performance of this Agreement or the Transaction or the other
transactions contemplated hereby; (b) agrees that it will not attempt to deny
or defeat such personal jurisdiction by motion or other request for leave from
any such court; (c) agrees that it will not bring any Proceeding relating to
the evaluation (including due diligence), negotiation, execution
or performance of this Agreement or the Transaction or the other transactions
contemplated hereby in any court other than the above-named courts; and (d)
agrees that it will not seek to assert by way of motion, as a defense or
otherwise, that any such Proceeding (i) is brought in an inconvenient forum,
(ii) should be transferred or removed to any court other than one of the
above-named courts, (iii) should be stayed by reason of the pendency of some
other Proceeding in any court other than one of the above-named courts, or
(iv) that this Agreement or the subject matter hereof may not be enforced in
or by the above-named courts. Each party hereto agrees that service of process
upon such party in any such Proceeding shall be effective if notice is given
in accordance with _Section_ __ _ 11.5_.

Section 11.8 _Waiver of Jury Trial_. EACH PARTY TO THIS AGREEMENT WAIVES TRIAL
BY JURY IN ANY ACTION, PROCEEDING OR COUNTERCLAIM BROUGHT BY ANY OF THEM
AGAINST THE OTHER ARISING OUT OF OR IN ANY WAY CONNECTED WITH THE EVALUATION

AGREEMENT OR THE TRANSACTION OR THE OTHER TRANSACTIONS CONTEMPLATED HEREBY,
OR ANY OTHER AGREEMENTS EXECUTED IN CONNECTION HEREWITH OR THE ADMINISTRATION
THEREOF OR THE TRANSACTION OR ANY OF THE OTHER TRANSACTIONS CONTEMPLATED
HEREIN OR THEREIN. NO PARTY TO THIS AGREEMENT SHALL SEEK A JURY TRIAL IN ANY
LAWSUIT, PROCEEDING, COUNTERCLAIM OR ANY OTHER LITIGATION PROCEDURE BASED
UPON, OR ARISING OUT OF, THE EVALUATION (INCLUDING DUE DILIGENCE),
NEGOTIATION, EXECUTION OR PERFORMANCE OF THIS AGREEMENT OR THE TRANSACTION OR
THE OTHER TRANSACTIONS CONTEMPLATED HEREBY OR ANY RELATED INSTRUMENTS. NO
PARTY HERETO WILL SEEK TO CONSOLIDATE ANY SUCH ACTION IN WHICH A JURY TRIAL
HAS BEEN WAIVED WITH ANY OTHER ACTION IN WHICH A JURY TRIAL CANNOT BE OR HAS
NOT BEEN WAIVED. EACH PARTY TO THIS AGREEMENT CERTIFIES THAT IT HAS BEEN
INDUCED TO ENTER INTO THIS AGREEMENT OR INSTRUMENT BY, AMONG OTHER THINGS, THE
MUTUAL WAIVERS AND CERTIFICATIONS SET FORTH ABOVE IN THIS _SECTION_ __ _
11.8_. NO PARTY HERETO HAS IN ANY WAY AGREED WITH OR REPRESENTED TO ANY OTHER
PARTY THAT THE PROVISIONS OF THIS _SECTION_ __ _ 11.8_ WILL NOT BE FULLY
ENFORCED IN ALL INSTANCES.

 

Section 11.9 _Severability_. If any term, provision, covenant or restriction
of this Agreement is held by a court of competent jurisdiction or other
authority to be invalid, void or unenforceable, the remainder of the terms,
provisions, covenants and restrictions of this Agreement shall remain in full
force and effect and shall in no way be affected, impaired or invalidated so
long as the economic or legal substance of the transactions contemplated
hereby is not affected in any manner materially adverse to any party hereto.
Upon such a determination, the parties hereto shall negotiate in good faith to
modify this Agreement so as to effect the original intent of the parties
hereto as closely as possible in a mutually acceptable manner in order that
the Transaction and the other transactions contemplated hereby be consummated
as originally contemplated to the fullest extent possible.

Section 11.10 _Counterparts_. This Agreement may be executed in two (2) or
more counterparts, all of which shall be considered an original, with the
same effect as if the signatures thereto and hereto were upon the same
instrument, and shall become effective when one (1) or more such counterparts
have been signed by each party hereto and delivered (by facsimile, e-mail, or
otherwise) to the other party. Signatures to this Agreement transmitted by
facsimile transmission, by electronic mail in "portable document format" ("
_.pdf_ ") form, or by any other electronic means intended to preserve the
original graphic and pictorial appearance of a document, will have the same
effect as physical delivery of the paper document bearing the original
signatures. This Agreement has been executed in the English language. If this
Agreement is translated into another language, the English language text shall
in any event prevail.

Section 11.11 _Expenses_. Except as otherwise provided herein, whether or not
the Closing takes place, and except as set forth otherwise in this Agreement,
all costs and expenses incurred in connection with this Agreement, the
Transaction and the other transactions contemplated hereby shall be paid by
the party incurring such expense.

Section 11.12 _Waiver of Conflicts_ _Regarding Representation; Non-
Assertion of Attorney-Client Privilege_.

(a) Purchaser waives and will not assert, and agrees to cause its Affiliates,
including the Purchased Companies, to waive and not to assert, any conflict
of interest relating to or arising out of the representation, after the
Closing (the " _Post-Closing Representation_ "), of Seller, any of its
Affiliates or any shareholder, officer, member, manager, employee or director
of any Seller or any of its Affiliates (any such Person, a " _Designated
Person_ ") in any matter involving this Agreement, any other Transaction
Document or any other agreements or transactions contemplated hereby or
thereby, by any legal counsel currently representing any Seller or any of its
Affiliates in connection with this Agreement, the other Transaction Documents
or any other agreements or transactions contemplated hereby or thereby,
including Wachtell, Lipton, Rosen and Katz (the " _Current Representation_ ").

(b) Purchaser waives and will not assert, and agrees to cause its Affiliates,
including the Purchased Companies, to waive and not to assert, any attorney-
client or other applicable legal privilege or protection with respect to any
communication between any legal counsel and any Designated Person occurring
during the Current Representation in connection with any Post-Closing
Representation, including in connection with a dispute with Purchaser or any
of its Affiliates, and following the Closing, with any Purchased Company, it
being the intention of the Parties that all such rights to such attorney-
client and other applicable legal privilege or protection and to control such
attorney-client and other applicable legal privilege or protection shall be
retained by Seller and that Seller, and not Purchaser, Purchasers Affiliates
or the Purchased Companies, shall have the sole right to decide whether or not
to waive any attorney-client or other applicable legal privilege or
protection. Accordingly, from and after Closing, neither Purchaser nor any of
its Affiliates (including the Purchased Companies) shall have any access to
any such communications or to the files of the Current Representation, all of
which shall be and remain the property of Seller and not of Purchaser or any
of its Affiliates (including the Purchased Companies), or to internal counsel
relating to such engagement, and neither Purchaser nor any of its Affiliates
(including the Purchased Companies) or any Person acting or purporting to act
on their behalf shall seek to obtain the same by any process on the grounds
that the privilege and protection attaching to such communications and files
belongs to Seller.

 

Section 11.13 _Interpretation; Absence of Presumption_. It is understood and
agreed that the specification of any dollar amount in the representations and
warranties or covenants contained in this Agreement or the inclusion of any
specific item in the Seller Disclosure Schedules or Purchaser Disclosure
Schedules is not intended to imply that such amounts or higher or
lower amounts, or the items so included or other items, are or are not
material, and no party hereto shall use the fact of the setting of such
amounts or the fact of the inclusion of any such item in the Seller Disclosure
Schedules or Purchaser Disclosure Schedules in any dispute or controversy
between the parties hereto as to whether any obligation, item or matter not
described
