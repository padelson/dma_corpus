behalf of Buyer (but not by or on behalf of Seller) to the applicable Persons
pursuant to the terms of the Release Letters in accordance with the third
sentence of _Section 2.3(a)_;

 



 

(v) an amount equal to the Seller Transaction Expenses paid by or on behalf of
Buyer (but not by or on behalf of Seller) pursuant to _Section 2.3(b)_ or
payable by Buyer or any Acquired Company, if any;

 



 

(vi) the amount of all Asset Taxes allocable to Seller pursuant to _Section

_Section 2.2(b)_ shall be referred to as the " _Cash Purchase Price
Adjustment_." The Unadjusted Cash Purchase Price as adjusted by the Cash

accounts), as specified by Seller to Buyer in writing no later than two (2)
Business Days prior to the Closing Date, and such amounts paid by Buyer shall
reduce the Unadjusted Cash Purchase Price as set forth in _Section
2.2(b)(v)_.

 



 

(c) Buyer shall treat any amounts it pays relating to Seller Transaction
Expenses pursuant _Section 2.3(b)_ as part of the Unadjusted Purchase Price
for U.S. federal income and any other applicable Tax purposes (and therefore
included in the basis of the Company Assets acquired for such purposes) and

Amount to be directly funded by Buyer pursuant to _Section 2.3(a)_ and the

efforts to agree on the Closing Statement; _provided_ , that if Seller and
Buyer are not able to agree on the Closing Statement prior to Closing, Closing
shall not be delayed on account of such disagreement and the Closing Statement
delivered by Seller will be used to adjust the Unadjusted Purchase Price at
Closing absent manifest error. Any final adjustments, if necessary, will be
made pursuant to _Section 2.9_ of this Agreement.

 



      
 

 



 

 **2.5** **_Title Review_**.

 



 

(a) To allow Buyer to conduct due diligence with respect to the Company
Assets, Seller shall make the Records available in accordance with _Section
6.3_ to Buyer, and Buyers authorized Representatives, in a virtual data room
and/or at Sellers election, at Sellers applicable office(s), at mutually
agreeable times before Closing. With Sellers permission, Buyer may photocopy
the Records at its sole expense.

 



 

(b) _Preferential Rights and Consents to Assign_.

 



 

(i) _Notices to Holders_. If the conveyance of the Acquired Interests would
trigger any Third Party preferential purchase rights, rights of first refusal,
or similar rights (collectively, " _Preferential Rights_ "), or, other than
Customary Post-Closing Consents, any Third Party consents to assign or similar
rights (collectively, " _Consents_ ") that, in either case, would be triggered
by the consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby, then, as soon as
reasonably practical (and in any event, within ten (10) Business Days after
the date of this Agreement), Seller shall: (A) notify the holders of the
Preferential Rights and Consents identified on _Schedule 2.5(b)_ that it
intends to transfer the Company Assets to Buyer; (B) provide the holders of
such Preferential Rights and Consents with any information about the transfer
of the Company Assets to which they are entitled; (C) in the case of such
Preferential Rights, request the holders of such Preferential Rights to waive
their right to purchase the affected Company Asset; and (D) in the case of
such Consents, request the holders of such Consents to consent to the
assignment of the affected Company Asset to Buyer. Before Closing, Seller
shall notify Buyer whether: (1) any Preferential Rights are exercised or
waived; (2) any Consents are granted or denied or cannot be obtained before
Closing; or (3) the requisite time periods have elapsed and any Preferential
Rights are deemed waived or Consents deemed given by the lapse of such
requisite time periods under the applicable agreements. If any Preferential
Rights are exercised, the portion of the Company Assets burdened by the
exercised Preferential Right shall be assigned by the Acquired Companies back
to Seller and excluded from Closing, and the Unadjusted Cash Purchase Price
shall be reduced by the Allocated Value of the excluded portion of the Company
Assets.

 



 

(ii) _Remedies_. Before Closing, Buyer and Seller shall use commercially
reasonable efforts to obtain all Consents and waivers of all Preferential
Rights encumbering the conveyance of the Company Assets; _provided_ that
neither Party shall be required to incur any liability or pay any money to a
Third Party in order to obtain such Consents and waivers. If Seller is unable
to obtain a Required Consent or a waiver of a Preferential Right, then, any
Company Asset subject to such Preferential Right or Required Consent shall be
assigned by the Acquired Companies back to Seller and excluded from Closing,
and the Unadjusted Cash Purchase Price shall be reduced by the Allocated Value
of such Company Asset. After Closing, Seller shall attempt to obtain any un-
obtained Required Consents, including Required Consents alleged by Third
Parties or identified after Closing, and un-waived Preferential Rights, and
Buyer shall provide reasonable assistance to Seller. In the event after
Closing but before the Final Settlement Date Seller is able to obtain a
Required Consent or waiver of a Preferential Right affecting a Company Asset
which was excluded from Closing pursuant to this _Section 2.5(b)_, then
within ten (10) days of Buyers receipt of such Required Consent or wavier of
Preferential Right Seller shall convey the Company Asset affected by any such
Required Consent or Preferential Right pursuant to a form of assignment that
is mutually agreeable to Buyer and Seller, and Buyer shall pay Seller

 



      
 

 



 

the amount by which the Unadjusted Cash Purchase Price was reduced at Closing
for such Company Asset.

any title opinions, title abstracts, ownership reports, run sheets, deeds,
leases or other document, reports or

 



      
 

 



 

data, to the extent available to Buyer and used in connection with Buyers
assessment of such alleged Title Defect(s)); and (v) the alleged Title Defect
Value of the affected Company Oil and Gas Property and the computations and
information upon which Buyers belief is based. To give Seller an opportunity
to commence reviewing and curing Title Defects but without prejudice to
Buyers right to assert Title Defects, Buyer agrees to use commercially
reasonable efforts to give Seller, on or before the end of each calendar week
prior to the Title Claim Date, written notice of all alleged Title Defects
discovered by Buyer during the preceding calendar week, which notice may be
preliminary in nature and supplemented prior to the Title Claim Date;
_provided_ that the failure to provide any such preliminary notice shall not
be deemed to waive or prejudice Buyers right to assert Title Defects at any
time not later the Title Claim Date.

 



 

(B) If any Title Defect affecting any Company Oil and Gas Property is properly
asserted by Buyer in accordance with _Section 2.5(d)(i)(A)_ and not waived in
writing by Buyer or cured on or before Closing, Seller may, for a period of
ninety (90) days following the Closing Date (such period, the " _Cure Period_
"), elect to cure any such Title Defect that Seller in good faith believes can
be cured during the Cure Period. The election by Seller to seek to cure such
Title Defect must be made by written notice delivered to Buyer within three
(3) Business Days prior to the Closing Date. Any Company Oil and Gas
Properties for which Seller has elected to cure a Title Defect under this
paragraph shall be referred to as a " _Curable Property_ ".

 



 

(C) At the Closing, the Acquired Companies shall retain all right, title and
interest in and to the Curable Properties. The adjustments to the Unadjusted
Purchase Price under _Section 2.2(b)(iii)_ will include the Title Defect
Values for all Title Defects affecting the Curable Properties that have been
properly asserted by Buyer in accordance with _Section 2.5(d)(i)(A)_ and not
waived in writing by Buyer or cured on or before Closing and Buyer shall pay
an amount in cash equal to the Title Defect Value associated with such Curable
Properties to the Escrow Agent in accordance with _Section 2.8(d)_. If Seller
cures such Title Defect during the Cure Period, then Buyer and Seller shall
instruct the Escrow Agent to pay to Seller the amount that the Unadjusted
Purchase Price was adjusted under _Section 2.2(b)(iii)_ (subject to any
further adjustments under _Section 2.2_ in respect of the applicable Company
Oil and Gas Property) with respect to such Curable Property on account of such
Title Defect at the end of the Cure Period to the extent such Title Defect is
cured during the Cure Period. If a Title Defect burdening a Curable Property
is not cured on or before the end of the Cure Period, then subject to _Section
2.5(d)(i)(D)(5)_ and _Section 2.5(d)(ii)_, Buyer and Seller shall instruct
the Escrow Agent to pay to Buyer the amount that the Unadjusted Purchase Price
was adjusted under _Section 2.2(b)(iii)_ (subject to any further adjustments
under _Section 2.2_ in respect of the applicable Company Oil and Gas
Property) with respect to such

 



      
 

 



 

Curable Property which was not cured on or before the end of the Cure Period.

 



 

(D) The " _Title Defect Value_ " resulting from a Title Defect shall be
determined as follows:

 



 

(1) if Buyer and Seller agree on the Title Defect Value, that amount shall be
the Title Defect Value;

 



 

(2) if the Title Defect is a Lien which is undisputed and liquidated in
amount, then the Title Defect Value shall be the amount necessary to be paid
to remove the Title Defect from Sellers interest in the affected Company Oil
and Gas Property;

 



 

(3) if the Title Defect represents a discrepancy between the Acquired
Companies actual Net Revenue Interest for a Well and the Net Revenue Interest
set forth on _Exhibit A-2_ for such Well, then the Title Defect Value shall
be an amount equal to the product of (A) the Allocated Value of such Well and
(B) one (1), minus a fraction, the numerator of which is the Acquired
Companies actual Net Revenue Interest for such Well and the denominator of
which is the Net Revenue Interest set forth for such Well on _Exhibit A-2_;

 



 

(4) if the Title Defect represents a discrepancy between the Acquired
Companies actual Net Royalty Acres for a Property and the Net Royalty Acres
set forth in _Exhibit A-1_ for such Property, then the Title Defect Value
shall be an amount equal to the product of (A) the Allocated Value of such
Property and (B) one (1) minus a fraction, the numerator of which is the
Acquired Companies actual Net Royalty Acres in such Property and the
denominator of which is the Net Royalty Acres set forth on _Exhibit A-1_ for
such Property; and

 



 

(5) notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this _Section 2.5(d)_, Buyer
shall have no remedy hereunder for any Title Defect unless: (A) the Title
Defect Value for such Title Defect exceeds one hundred thousand Dollars
($100,000) net to the Acquired Companies interest in the relevant Company Oil
and Gas Property (the " _Title Defect Threshold_ "), in which event the value
of such defect will be taken into account from first Dollar; and (B) the sum
of the aggregate Title Defect Values for Title Defects with Title Defect
Values exceeding the Title Defect Threshold exceeds one percent (1%) of the
Unadjusted Purchase Price, and then only to the extent such amount exceeds one
percent (1%) of the Unadjusted Purchase Price (the " _Title Defect Deductible_
").

 



      
 

 



 

(E) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement, the aggregate
adjustments to the Unadjusted Purchase Price attributable to the effects of
all Title Defects, with respect to any Company Oil and Gas Property, shall not
exceed the Allocated Value of such affected Company Oil and Gas Property.

 



 

(ii) _Title Defect Disputes_.

 



 

(A) Seller and Buyer shall attempt to agree on all Title Defect Values (i) on
or prior to the Closing Date or (ii) with respect to disputes over the
adequacy of Sellers post-Closing Date curative work, the end of the Cure
Period. If a disputed Title Defect or Title Defect Value cannot be resolved
(i) on or prior to Closing or (ii) with respect to disputes over the adequacy
of Sellers post-Closing Date curative work, the end of the Cure Period, then
in each case, any Party may submit any such disputed Title Defects, cures and
Title Defect Values to the Title Consultant in accordance with the procedures
set forth in _Section 2.5(d)(ii)(C)_ by providing notice to the other Party
thereof (a " _Title Dispute Notice_ ") no later than thirty (30) days
following the Closing Date or the end of the Cure Period, as applicable (the "
_Title Dispute_ "). If a Party does not submit a Title Dispute Notice to the
other Party in accordance with this _Section 2.5(d)(ii)(A)_, such Party shall
be deemed to have waived all such disputed matters, which shall be deemed
conclusively resolved in accordance with the applicable Title Defect Notice or
subsequent correspondence between the Parties.

 



 

(B) If a disputed Title Defect or Title Defect Value cannot be resolved prior
to Closing, except as otherwise provided herein, the Acquired Companies shall
retain all right, title and interest in and to the Company Oil and Gas
Property affected by such Title Defect, Buyer shall pay an amount in cash
equal to the alleged Title Defect Value for such Company Oil and Gas Property
to the Escrow Agent in accordance with _Section 2.8(d)_ and the adjustments
to the Unadjusted Purchase Price under _Section 2.2(b)(iii)_ shall include
such Title Defect Value.

 



 

(C) If a Party validly submits a Title Dispute Notice under _Section
2.5(d)(ii)(A)_, then the Parties shall each submit such unresolved Title
Dispute to a title attorney (the " _Title Consultant_ "), pursuant to this
_Section 2.5(d)(ii)(C)_.

 



 

(1) The Parties hereby agree that: (i) Dick Watt shall serve as the Title
Consultant with respect to any Title Disputes that are required to be resolved
pursuant to this _Section 2.5(d)(ii)(C)(1)_; (ii) if Dick Watt is unable or
unwilling to serve as the Title Consultant, then Allen D. Cummings shall serve
as the Title Consultant with respect to any Title Disputes that are required
to be resolved pursuant to this _Section 2.5(d)(ii)(C)(1)_; _provided_ ,
_further_ , that if both Dick Watt and Allen D. Cummings are unable or

 



      
 

 



 

unwilling to serve as the Title Consultant, then Jeff Weems shall serve as the
Title Consultant with respect to any Title Disputes that are required to be
resolved pursuant to this _Section 2.5(d)(ii)(C)(1)_; or (iii) if Dick Watt,
Allen D. Cummings and Jeff Weems are unable or unwilling to serve as the Title
Consultant, then the provisions of _Section 2.5(d)(ii)(C)(2)_ applicable to
the selection of the Title Consultant shall apply _mutatis mutandis_ to the
selection of the Title Consultant.

 



 

(2) The Title Consultant shall be a neutral third party title attorney with at
least ten (10) years experience in oil and gas title opinions, as selected by
_Section 2.5(d)(ii)(C)(1)_. In the event that _Section
2.5(d)(ii)(C)(1)(iii)_ is applicable, the Parties shall each select a third
party title attorney and such title attorneys together shall select such Title
Consultant, and if any Party does not select a Title Consultant within ten
(10) days of written demand therefor by the other Party, then the title
attorney selected by the other Party shall be such Title Consultant. The Title
Consultant shall not have been employed by any Party or its Affiliates within
the ten (10) year period preceding the arbitration. The Title Consultant, once
appointed, shall have no ex parte communications with any of the Parties
concerning the determination required hereunder. All communications between
any Party or its Affiliates and the Title Consultant shall be conducted in
writing, with copies sent simultaneously to the other Party in the same
manner, or at a meeting or conference call to which the representatives of
both Seller and Buyer have been invited and of which such Parties have been
provided at least five (5) days notice. Within ten (10) days of appointment
of the Title Consultant, (x) each of Seller and Buyer shall present the Title
Consultant with its claim notice or its response, as applicable, and (y)
Seller shall present the Title Consultant with all other supporting
information that it desires, and Buyer shall present the Title Consultant with
all other supporting information that it desires that was contained in the
original Title Defect Notices, with a copy to the other Party. The Title
Consultant shall also be provided with a copy of this Agreement. Within thirty
(30) days after receipt of such materials and after receipt of any additional
information required by the Title Consultant, the Title Consultant shall make
its determination, which shall be final and binding upon all Parties, without
right of appeal, absent manifest error. In making his determination, the Title
Consultant shall be bound by the rules set forth in this _Section
2.5(d)(ii)_. The Title Consultant shall act as an expert for the limited
purpose of determining: (1) the existence of any timely asserted Title Defect
in dispute; (2) whether any disputed curative action has succeeded in curing a
Title Defect; and (3) specific disputed Title Defect Values submitted by
either Party. The Title Consultant may not award

 



      
 

 



 

damages, interest or penalties to either Party with respect to any matter.
Seller and Buyer shall each bear its own legal fees and other costs of
presenting its case. Seller shall bear one-half (1/2) and Buyer shall bear
one-half (1/2) of the costs and expenses of the Title Consultant.

 



 

(e) _Title Benefits_.

 



 

(i) If Seller discovers any Title Benefit on or before the Title Claim Date,
Seller may, as soon as practicable but in any case on or prior to the Title
Claim Date, deliver a notice to Buyer, which shall include: (i) a detailed
description of the alleged Title Benefit; (ii) the specific Company Oil and
Gas Property affected; (iii) the Allocated Value of the Company Oil and Gas
Property subject to the alleged Title Benefit; (iv) supporting documentation
reasonably necessary for Buyer to verify the existence of such Title Benefit
(including copies of any title opinions, title abstracts, ownership reports,
run sheets, deeds, leases or other document, reports or data, to the extent
used in connection with Sellers assessment of such alleged Title Benefit);
and (v) the alleged Title Benefit value of the affected Company Oil and Gas
Property and the computations and information upon which Sellers belief is
based. With respect to each Company Oil and Gas Property affected by a Title
Benefit reported hereunder, an amount (the " _Title Benefit Value_ ") equal to
the increase in the Allocated Value for such Company Oil and Gas Property
caused by such Title Benefit (calculated in a similar manner as the
determination of Title Defect Values in accordance with the terms of _Section
2.5(d)(i)(D)_, _mutatis mutandis_ ) will be determined and agreed to by the
Parties as soon as practicable. If, with respect to a Title Benefit, the
Parties have not agreed on the amount of the Title Benefit or have not
otherwise agreed on the validity of such Title Benefit, Buyer and Seller shall
have the right to elect to have such Title Benefit Value determined by a Title
Consultant pursuant to and in accordance with the provisions regarding a
disputed Title Defect set forth in _Section 2.5(d)(ii)(C)_. The Title Benefit
Value with respect to all Title Benefits shall be used solely to offset any
reductions to the Unadjusted Purchase Price as a result of the aggregate of
all Title Defect Values. For the avoidance of doubt, Title Benefit Value shall
in no event increase the Unadjusted Purchase Price.

 



 

(ii) If Buyer discovers any Title Benefit on or before the Title Claim Date,
Buyer shall, as soon as practicable but in any case on or prior to the Title
Claim Date, deliver to Seller a notice meeting the requirements of _Section
2.5(e)(i)_.

 



 

(f) In the event either Party notifies the other Party of the intention to
terminate this Agreement in accordance with _Section 8.1(e)_, Seller or Buyer
may, prior to giving effect to _Section 8.1(e)_, as applicable, elect to
submit all disputed Title Defects and Title Defect Values to the Title
Consultant in accordance with the procedures set forth in _Section
2.5(d)(ii)(C)_; _provided_ , that notwithstanding anything to the contrary in
Section 2.5(d)(ii)(C), such proceeding shall be solely to determine whether
the aggregate adjustments pursuant to _Section 2.2(b)(iii)_ in respect of any
disputed Title Defects and Title Defect Values asserted by Buyer in good faith
would, when taken together with all other adjustments pursuant to _Section
2.2(b)(iii)_ for finally determined Title Defect Values and all other
adjustments pursuant to _Section 2.2(b)(iii)_, trigger the termination right
under _Section 8.1(e)_. For the avoidance of doubt, if Seller or Buyer elect
to submit to the Title Consultant in accordance with this _Section 2.5(f)_,
neither Party may terminate this Agreement pursuant to _Section 8.1(e)_ until
final resolution of such arbitration unless the termination right

 



      
 

 



 

under _Section 8.1(e)_ would otherwise apply solely by virtue of any
undisputed Title Defect Values, together with the exclusion of any Company Oil
and Gas Property pursuant to _Section 2.5(b)_ or _Section 2.5(d)_.

 



 

(g) _Acceptance of Title Condition_. EXCEPT AS OTHERWISE SET FORTH IN THIS
AGREEMENT, BUYER REPRESENTS AND WARRANTS THAT IT HAS BEEN PROVIDED OPPORTUNITY
TO CONFIRM THE ACQUIRED COMPANIES DEFENSIBLE TITLE TO THE COMPANY OIL AND GAS
PROPERTIES AND UPON CLOSING, BUYER WILL ACCEPT THE COMPANY OIL AND GAS
PROPERTIES AT CLOSING IN THE PRESENT CONDITION, "AS IS AND WHERE IS AND WITH
ALL FAULTS." BUYER ACKNOWLEDGES AND AGREES THAT, EXCEPT AS OTHERWISE SET FORTH
IN THIS AGREEMENT, SELLER HAS MADE NO REPRESENTATIONS OR WARRANTIES OF ANY
KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, WRITTEN, ORAL OR OTHERWISE, AS TO THE ACCURACY OR
COMPLETENESS OF THE BACKGROUND MATERIALS OR ANY OTHER INFORMATION RELATING TO
THE CONVEYED ASSETS FURNISHED BY OR ON BEHALF OF SELLER OR TO BE FURNISHED TO
BUYER OR ITS REPRESENTATIVES, INCLUDING SELLERS INTERNAL APPRAISALS AND
INTERPRETIVE DATA.

 **2.7** **_Closing_**. Subject to _Section 8.1_, the closing of the sale and
transfer of the Acquired Interests to Buyer as contemplated by this Agreement
(the " _Closing_ ") shall take place at the offices of Kirkland and Ellis LLP,
609 Main Street, Suite 4500, Houston, Texas 77002, on the date that is the
later of (a) forty-five (45) days from the date of this Agreement and (b) the
third (3rd) Business

 



      
 

 



 

Day following the satisfaction or waiver of all conditions to the obligations

conditions that, by their terms, cannot be satisfied until the Closing, but
subject to satisfaction at the Closing), or such other date as Buyer and
Seller may mutually determine (the date on which the Closing occurs is
referred to herein as the " _Closing Date_ ").

 



 

 **2.8** **_Escrow_**.

 



 

(a) Within one (1) Business Day after the execution and delivery of this
Agreement, Buyer will pay to the Escrow Agent, by wire transfer of immediately
available funds, an earnest money deposit equal to ten percent (10%) of the
Unadjusted Cash Purchase Price (the " _Cash Escrow Amount_ ") to be deposited
in the General Escrow Account pursuant to the Escrow Agreement. At Closing,
the Cash Escrow Amount will be applied against the Unadjusted Cash Purchase
Price in accordance with _Section 2.6(a)_ and shall remain in escrow, in
accordance with _Section 9.5_. If Closing does not occur, then the Cash
Escrow Amount shall be otherwise distributed by the Escrow Agent in accordance
with _Section 8.3_.

 



 

(b) At Closing, Buyer will deposit into the General Escrow Account four
hundred thousand Common Units (the " _Indemnity Escrow Units_ ") pursuant to
the Escrow Agreement. The Indemnity Escrow Units to be deposited into the

whether in book-entry or certificated form.

 



 

(c) For the avoidance of doubt, the aggregate value of the Cash Escrow Amount
plus the value of the Indemnity Escrow Units at Closing shall equal ten
percent (10%) of the Unadjusted Purchase Price.

 



 

(d) At Closing, Buyer will deposit into the General Escrow Account any Title
Defect Value related to Curable Properties and disputed Title Defects or
disputed Title Defect Values, pursuant to the Escrow Agreement. No later than
five (5) Business Days following the resolution (including by resolution of
the Parties) of the cure of any Title Defects affecting the Curable Properties
pursuant to _Section 2.5(d)(i)(B)_, Buyer and Seller shall within three (3)
Business Days of such resolution execute a Joint Instruction Letter
instructing the Escrow Agent to release from the Cash Escrow Amount to Seller,
the Title Defect Value with respect to such Curable Properties to the extent
such Title Defect is cured during the Cure Period. No later than five (5)
Business Days following the resolution (including by resolution of the
Parties) of any disputed Title Defect or Title Defect Value pursuant to
_Section 2.5(d)(ii)(C)_, as applicable, Buyer and Seller shall within three
(3) Business Days of such resolution execute a Joint Instruction Letter
instructing the Escrow Agent to release from the Cash Escrow Amount the
amounts so determined to be owed to either Party with respect to such disputed
matter. Only upon final resolution of all matters for which funds were
deposited into the General Escrow Account as a result of Title Defects
asserted by Seller, and the release to Seller of all such amounts due to
Seller from the General Escrow Account, then, Seller and Buyer shall execute a
Joint Instruction Letter instructing the Escrow Agent to release from the
General Escrow Account the then-remaining Title Defect Value(s), including any
attributable to a Curable Property which was not cured on or prior to the end
of the Cure Period, if any, to Buyer.

 



      
 

 



 

(e) Releases of any portion of the General Escrow Balance shall be made only
in accordance with (i) written instructions that are jointly signed by Seller
and Buyer, which instructions shall be in a form that complies with the
requirements of the Escrow Agreement (a " _Joint Instruction Letter_ "), (ii)
requirements in the Escrow Agreement relating to a Final Determination (as
defined in the Escrow Agreement), and, in each case, _Article 9_, and shall
specify the amount of the General Escrow Balance to be released from the
General Escrow Account and the Person or Persons to whom such General Escrow
Balance shall be released.

 



 

(f) In the event of a conflict between the Escrow Agreement and this
Agreement, this Agreement shall govern. If any Party receives a release of any
General Escrow Balance pursuant to the Escrow Agreement to which it is not
entitled pursuant to the terms of this Agreement, such Party shall (i) if
another Party is entitled to such General Escrow Balance at that time,
transfer such General Escrow Balance to such other Party, or (ii) if no other
Party is entitled to such General Escrow Balance at that time, deposit such
General Escrow Balance with the Escrow Agent to be held and released pursuant
to the Escrow Agreement.

 



 

 **2.9** **Post-Closing Adjustment**.

 



 

(a) Revised Closing Statement. On or before the date that is ninety (90) days
after the Closing Date, Buyer shall prepare and deliver to Seller a revised
Closing Statement setting forth its assessment of (i) the final amounts
described in _Sections 2.2(a)(ii)_ , _2.2(a)(iii)_ , _2.2(b)(i)_ ,
_2.2(b)(ii)_ and _2.2(b)(iii)_ , the portion of the Payoff Amount directly
funded by Buyer and the amount of any Seller Transaction Expenses actually
funded by Buyer, in each case as of or on the Closing Date, as applicable,
(ii) the amount of all Asset Taxes allocable to Buyer pursuant to _Section
6.9(a)_ but paid or economically borne by Seller (if any), (iii) the amount of
all Asset Taxes allocable to Seller pursuant to _Section 6.9(a)_ but paid or
economically borne by Buyer (if any) and (iv) all Buyer Entitlements, Buyer
Obligations, Seller Entitlements and Seller Obligations then known to Buyer.
Buyer shall provide to Seller such data and information as Seller may
reasonably request supporting the amounts reflected on the revised Closing
Statement (and reasonable access to Buyers personnel, including internal
accountants, during normal business hours) to permit Seller to perform or
cause to be performed an audit of the revised Closing Statement, at Sellers
expense. The revised Closing Statement shall become final and binding upon the
Parties on the date (the " _Final Settlement Date_ ") that is thirty (30) days
following receipt thereof by Seller unless Seller gives Notice of its
disagreement (" _Notice of Disagreement_ ") to Buyer prior to the Final
Settlement Date, it being understood that the Notice of Disagreement shall not
include matters contemplated by _Section 2.5_. Any Notice of Disagreement
shall specify in reasonable detail the Dollar amount, nature, and basis of any
disagreement so asserted. If a Notice of Disagreement is received by Buyer by
the Final Settlement Date, then the Closing Statement (as revised in
accordance with _Section 2.9(b)_ below) shall become final and binding on the
Parties on, and the Final Settlement Date shall be, the earlier of (i) the
date upon which Seller and Buyer agree in writing with respect to all matters
specified in the Notice of Disagreement and (ii) the date upon which the
Independent Accountants Closing Statement (as hereinafter defined) is issued
by the Independent Accountant (as hereinafter defined).

 



 

(b) _Final Closing Statement_. During the thirty (30) days following the date
upon which Buyer receives a Notice of Disagreement, Seller and Buyer shall use
commercially reasonable efforts to attempt to resolve in writing any
differences that they may have with respect

 



      
 

 



 

to all matters specified in the Notice of Disagreement. If at the end of such
thirty (30) day period (or earlier by mutual agreement), Buyer and Seller have
not reached agreement on such matters, the matters that remain in dispute (and
only such matters) shall promptly be submitted to BDO USA, LLP (the "
_Independent Accountant_ ") for review and final and binding resolution. If
BDO USA, LLP is unable or unwilling to serve as an arbitrator hereunder, then
Seller and Buyer shall, in good faith, mutually agree upon an independent
national accounting firm who has not represented either Party in any material
matter at any time during the two-year period of time immediately preceding
its designation hereunder, to serve as the Independent Accountant. Buyer and
Seller shall, not later than seven (7) days prior to the hearing date set by
the Independent Accountant, each submit a written brief to the Independent
Accountant (and a copy thereof to the other Party on the same day) with
proposed Dollar figures for settlement of the disputes as to the amount of the
Cash Purchase Price Adjustment (together with a proposed Closing Statement
that reflects such figures) consistent with their respective calculations
delivered pursuant to _Section 2.9(a)_. The hearing shall be conducted on a
confidential basis. The Independent Accountant shall consider only those items
or amounts in the Closing Statement which were identified in the Notice of
Disagreement and such written briefs and which remain in dispute and the
Independent Accountants decision resolving the matters in dispute shall be
based upon and be consistent with the terms and conditions in this Agreement.
In deciding any matter, the Independent Accountant (i) shall be bound by the
provisions of this _Section 2.9_ and the related definitions and (ii) may not
assign a value to any disputed item greater than the greatest value for such
item claimed by either Seller or Buyer or less than the smallest value for
such item claimed by Seller or Buyer in their respective calculations
delivered pursuant to _Section 2.9(a)_. The Independent Accountant shall
render a decision resolving the matters in dispute (which decision shall
include a written statement of findings and conclusions) promptly after the
conclusion of the hearing, unless the Parties reach agreement prior thereto
and withdraw the dispute from arbitration. The Independent Accountant shall
provide to the Parties explanations in writing of the reasons for its
decisions regarding the Cash Purchase Price Adjustment and shall issue the
Final Closing Statement (as defined below) reflecting such decision, which
shall set forth the Cash Purchase Price Adjustment and the Adjusted Cash
Purchase Price as determined by the Independent Accountant pursuant to this
_Section 2.9_. The decision of the Independent Accountant shall be (i) final
and binding on the Parties and (ii) final and non-appealable for all purposes
hereunder; _provided_ , _however_ , that such decision may be reviewed,
corrected or set aside by a court of competent jurisdiction, but only if and
to the extent that the Independent Accountant is found by such court of
competent jurisdiction to have made mathematical errors with respect to its
decision or to have manifestly violated the express terms of this _Section
2.9 _(including the related defined terms set forth in _Section 1.1_). The
cost of any arbitration (including the fees and expenses of the Independent
Accountant) under this _Section 2.9(b)_ shall be borne entirely by the Party
awarded the smaller percentage of the disputed amount by the Independent
Accountant. The fees and disbursements of Buyers independent auditors and
other costs and expenses incurred in connection with the services performed
with respect to the Closing Statement shall be borne by Buyer and the fees and
disbursements of Sellers independent auditors and other costs and expenses
incurred in connection with their preparation of the Notice of Disagreement
shall be borne by Seller. As used in this Agreement, the term " _Final Closing
Statement_ " shall mean the revised Closing Statement described in _Section
2.9(a)_, as prepared by Buyer and as may be subsequently adjusted to reflect
any subsequent written agreement between the Parties with respect thereto, or
if submitted to the Independent Accountant,

 



      
 

 



 

the Independent Accountants Closing Statement (" _Independent Accountant s
Closing Statement_") as described in this _Section 2.9(b)_.

 



 

(c) _Final Settlement_. If the Adjusted Cash Purchase Price set forth on the
Closing Statement delivered pursuant to _Section 2.4_ exceeds the Adjusted
Cash Purchase Price set forth on the Final Closing Statement or the
Independent Accountants Closing Statement, as applicable, then Seller shall
pay Buyer such excess amount, together with interest thereon, from the Closing
Date to (but not including) the date on which such payment is paid, at the
rate of three percent per annum calculated and payable in accordance with

applicable, exceeds the Adjusted Cash Purchase Price set forth on the Closing
Statement delivered pursuant to _Section 2.4_, then Buyer shall pay Seller
such excess amount, together with interest thereon, from the Closing Date to
(but not including) the date on which such payment is paid, at the rate of

rate on the basis of a year of 365 days, in each case for the actual number of
days (including the first day, but excluding the last day) occurring in the
period for which such interest is payable. Whenever any payment under this
Agreement will be due on a day other than a Business Day, such payment shall
be made on the next succeeding Business Day, and such extension of time shall
be included in the computation of payment of interest.

 



 

 **2.10** **_Purchase Price Allocation; Tax Treatment_**.

 



 

(a) Seller shall prepare and deliver to Buyer, within sixty (60) days after
the Final Settlement Date, an allocation of the Unadjusted Purchase Price, the
assumed obligations and any other items that are treated as consideration for
U.S. federal Income Tax purposes among the Company Assets in accordance with
Section 1060 of the Code and the Treasury Regulations promulgated thereunder
(the " _Allocation_ "). Buyer shall have twenty (20) days from the receipt of
the Allocation or any update thereto to review and comment on the Allocation.
If Buyer disputes any items in the proposed Allocation, Seller and Buyer shall
use commercially reasonable efforts to agree on such Allocation within twenty
(20) days after receipt of any written changes proposed by Buyer. If Seller
and Buyer are unable to agree upon such Allocation within such twenty-day
period, then any disputed items in such Allocation shall be resolved under the
procedures described in _Section 2.9(b)_. Once Buyer and Seller agree to the
Allocation or the Allocation is determined by the Independent Accountant, as
applicable, Seller and Buyer shall report consistently with such Allocation
(as revised to take into account subsequent adjustments to the Unadjusted
Purchase Price) in all Tax Returns, including IRS Form 8594, which Seller and
Buyer shall timely file with the IRS, and neither Seller nor Buyer shall take
any position in any return that is inconsistent with the Allocation, as
adjusted, in each case, unless required to do so by a final determination as
defined in Section 1313 of the Code.

 



      
 

 



 

(b) Except as the Parties may agree otherwise, cooperating in good faith, for
U.S. federal Income Tax purposes (and for purposes of state and local Income
Taxes which incorporate the federal Income Tax provisions referenced in this
_Section 2.10(b)_), each of Seller and Buyer agree that Seller shall be
treated as transferring the Company Assets to Buyer in exchange for the Common
Units and the Unadjusted Cash Purchase Price, which shall be treated (a) as a
contribution described in Section 721 of the Code as to the Common Units and
any other consideration that the Buyer and Seller mutually determine in good
faith qualifies for exceptions to the "disguised sale" rules under Section 707
of the Code and its implement regulations (the " _Contribution_ ") and (b)
otherwise, as a taxable sale under Section 707(a) of the Code and its
implementing Treasury Regulations. Except as otherwise required by applicable
Law, each of Seller and Buyer shall, and shall cause each of its Affiliates to
(y) report, act, and file all Tax Returns in all respects and for all purposes
consistent with the foregoing treatment, and (z) not take any position for Tax
purposes (whether in audits, Tax Returns or otherwise) that is inconsistent
with the foregoing treatment, unless required to do so by a final
determination as defined in Section 1313 of the Code.

 



 

(c) Differences between the fair market value and the basis of the Company
Assets allocable to the Contributions shall be taken into account in the
manner required by Section 704(c) of the Code. The method to be used under
Treas. Reg. 1.704-3 shall be determined by the Parties in the manner
consistent with _Section 6.17(a)_, provided that if the Election is not made
in 2018, the Buyer will elect the remedial method of Treas. Reg. 1.704-3(d) as
to the Company Assets. All other determinations regarding the application of
Section 704(c), the determination and maintenance of capital accounts and
other tax matters relating to the Contribution and the assets allocable
thereto shall be made in the discretion of the Buyer in a manner consistent
with the Partnership Agreement.

(a) Buyer shall be entitled to all revenues, income, proceeds, receipts and
credits attributable to production from the Company Assets from and after the
Effective Time (collectively, the " _Buyer Entitlements_ "), and shall be
responsible for (and entitled to any refunds with respect to) all audit,

 **5.8** **_Financial Statements_**. Buyer has timely filed or furnished with
the Securities and Exchange Commission (the " _Commission_ ") all reports,
schedules, forms, statements, and other documents (including exhibits and
other information incorporated therein) required to be filed or furnished by
it since February 7, 2017 under the Securities Act or the Exchange Act (all
such documents, collectively, the " _SEC Documents_ "). The SEC Documents,
including any audited or unaudited financial statements and any notes thereto
or schedules included therein (the " _Buyer Financial Statements_ "), at the
time filed or furnished (except to the extent amended or superseded by a
subsequently filed or furnished SEC Document filed or furnished prior to the
date of this Agreement) (a) did not contain any untrue statement of a material
fact or omit to state a material fact required to be stated therein or
necessary in order to make the statements therein (in the light of the
circumstances under which they were made) not misleading, (b) complied in all
material respects with the applicable requirements of the Exchange Act and the
Securities Act, as applicable and (c) complied as to form in all material
respects with applicable accounting requirements and with the published rules
and regulations of the Commission with respect thereto. The Buyer Financial
Statements were prepared from the books and records of Buyer in accordance
with GAAP applied on a consistent basis during the periods covered thereby
(except as may be indicated in the notes thereto or the omission of notes to
the extent permitted by Regulation S-K or, in the case of unaudited
statements, as permitted by Form 10-Q of the Commission) and subject, in the
case of interim financial statements, to normal year-end adjustments, and
present fairly in accordance with GAAP, in all material respects, the
financial position and the results of operations of Buyer as of, and for the
periods ended on, such applicable dates. The other financial information of
Buyer, including non-GAAP financial measures, if any, contained or
incorporated by reference in the SEC Documents has been derived from the
accounting records of Buyer, and fairly presents

 



      
 

 



 

in all material respects the information purported to be shown thereby.
Nothing has come to the attention of Buyer that has caused it to believe that
the statistical and market-related data included in the SEC Documents is not
based on or derived from sources that are reliable and accurate in all
material respects as of the date on which the applicable SEC Documents were
filed. Based on an annual evaluation of disclosure controls and procedures,
Buyer is not aware of (i) any significant deficiency or material weakness in
the design or operation of internal controls over financial reporting that are
likely to adversely affect its ability to record, process, summarize and
report financial data or (ii) any fraud, whether or not material, that
involves management or other employees who have a significant role in the
internal controls over financial reporting of Buyer. Buyer does not have any
liabilities of any kind, whether accrued, contingent, absolute, determined,
determinable or otherwise, that would be required to be reflected on a balance
sheet prepared in accordance with GAAP, other than: (A) liabilities adequately
provided for, reflected or reserved on the Buyer Financial Statements, (B)
liabilities that have arisen after March 31, 2018 in the Ordinary Course or
(C) liabilities that, individually or in the aggregate, have not had, or would
not reasonably be expected to have, a Buyer Material Adverse Effect.

 



 

 **5.9** **_Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm_**. Grant Thornton
LLP, which has audited the financial statements of Buyer and its consolidated
subsidiaries and delivered its report with respect to the audited consolidated
financial statements contained or incorporated by reference in the SEC
Documents, is an independent registered public accounting firm with respect to
Buyer within the meaning of the Securities Act and the applicable rules and
regulations thereunder adopted by the Commission and the Public Company
Accounting Oversight Board (United States). Grant Thornton LLP has not
resigned or been dismissed as independent registered public accountants of
Buyer as a result of or in connection with any disagreement with Buyer on any
matter of accounting principles or practices, financial statement disclosure
or auditing scope or procedures.

specified by the Commission and that such information is communicated to
Buyers management.

(a) Buyer has, through a combination of cash on hand and capital commitments
and pursuant to commitments for other sources of financing (which commitments
are subject to the terms and conditions set forth in the agreements containing
such commitments in effect on the date hereof), funds sufficient to fund the
consummation of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement and to satisfy
the related costs and expenses arising in connection with the consummation
thereof. Buyer expressly acknowledges that the failure to have sufficient
funds shall in no event be a condition to the performance of its obligations
hereunder, and in no event shall Buyers failure to perform its obligations
hereunder be excused by failure to receive funds from any source.

 



 

(b) Buyer has delivered to Seller true, complete and correct copies of the
executed Debt Commitment Letter, together with each related Fee Letter (with
customary redactions only with respect to fee amounts, pricing caps and the
economic terms of the "market

 



      
 

 



 

flex" provisions, none of which would reasonably be expected to adversely
affect the amount, conditionality or availability of the Debt Financing) and
engagement letter, each in effect as of the date of this Agreement from the

 **6.3** **_Access; Confidentiality_**.

 



 

(a) To the extent related to the Acquired Companies, from and after the date
hereof until the Closing Date (or earlier termination of this Agreement), but
subject to the other provisions of this _Section 6.3_ and obtaining any
required consents of Third Parties (which consents Seller shall use
commercially reasonable efforts to obtain; _provided_ , that Seller shall not
be required to make any payments therefor), Seller shall provide Buyer and
Buyers Representatives access to the Records that are in Sellers or its
Affiliates possession or control at such time (the " _Assessment_ ");
_provided, however_ , such access shall not materially interfere with the
Acquired Companies ownership of the Company Assets in the Ordinary Course.
Any Assessment conducted by Buyer or on behalf of Buyer hereunder shall be
conducted at Buyers sole cost, risk and expense and any conclusions resulting
from any such Assessment shall be deemed to result

 



      
 

 



 

solely from Buyers own independent review and judgment. Subject to the
express representations and warranties contained in _Article 4_, Seller shall
not be deemed by Buyers receipt of the Records in connection with any
Assessment to have made any representation or warranty, express, implied or
statutory, as to the Company Assets or the accuracy of such Records or the
information contained therein.

 



 

(b) All information obtained by and access granted to Buyer and its
representatives under this _Section 6.3_ shall be subject to the terms of
_Section 6.10_ and the Confidentiality Agreement (whichever is more

Representatives shall contact and communicate with the business relations of
the Acquired Companies and their Affiliates in connection with the

to the extent such consent is granted, Seller shall use commercially
reasonable efforts to facilitate communications between Buyer and the
employees, customers, suppliers and other business relations of the Acquired
Companies.

 



 

 **6.4** **_Books and Records_**. No later than thirty (30) days after
Closing, Seller shall deliver to Buyer all Records that are in possession of
Seller, except for the Excluded Records. From and after the Closing Date,

retain a copy of any or all of the Due Diligence Information and all other
books and records relating to the business or operations of the Acquired
Companies on or before the Closing Date that are required by Seller to comply
with legal obligations or that relate to the Excluded Assets.

 



 

 **6.5** **_Insurance_**. Buyer acknowledges and agrees that, effective upon
the Closing, the insurance policies of Seller and its Affiliates related to
the Acquired Companies shall be terminated or modified to exclude coverage of
the Acquired Companies, and, as a result, it shall be the obligation of Buyer
to obtain at its sole cost and expense replacement insurance effective from
and after the Closing. Seller shall pursue, and shall cause its Affiliates to
pursue, on behalf of and for the benefit of the Acquired Companies, any
recovery under any such insurance policy with respect to any event or

recovery upon receipt thereof by Seller or one of its Affiliates.

 



 

 **6.6** **_Further Assurances_**. Subject to the terms and conditions of this
Agreement, each Party will use its reasonable best efforts to take, or cause

agreements and other writings and to take such other actions as may be
necessary in order to consummate or implement expeditiously the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement in accordance with the terms hereof.

 



 

 **6.7** **_Publicity_**. All press releases or other public communications of
any nature whatsoever relating to the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement, and the method of the release for publication thereof, shall be
subject to the prior written consent of Buyer and Seller;

 



      
 

 



 

 _provided_ , _however_ , that nothing herein shall prevent a Party from
publishing such press releases or other public communications as is necessary
to satisfy such Partys obligations under applicable securities or other Laws
or under the rules of any stock or commodities exchange after consultation
with the other Party; _provided_ , _further_ , that nothing in this _Section
6.7_ will preclude (a) any Party, their Affiliates or their Representatives
from making any "tombstone" or similar advertisement that does not state the
Unadjusted Purchase Price or Adjusted Cash Purchase Price, any component
thereof, or the manner of its determination with the prior written consent of
Buyer or Seller, which consent will not be unreasonably conditioned, delayed,
or withheld, (b) any Party from discussing (on a confidential basis) the
return on any underlying investment with respect to the Acquired Companies and
the acquisition or disposition of the Acquired Companies in connection with
legitimate fundraising activities or fund performance reporting to current or
prospective investors, lenders, or partners post-Closing, (c) any Party from
communicating with its employees on a confidential basis.

 



 

 **6.8** **_Fees and Expenses; Transfer Taxes_**.

otherwise in connection with the transactions contemplated hereunder shall be
timely filed by the Party responsible for such filing under applicable law.
Buyer and Seller shall reasonably cooperate to reduce or eliminate any
Transfer Taxes to the extent permitted by applicable Law.

 



 

(c) To the extent that the transactions contemplated under this Agreement are
determined to involve a transfer of tangible personal property, Buyer and
Seller acknowledge and agree that such transactions constitute a sale of an
identifiable segment of a business for purposes of Section 151.304 of the
Texas Tax Code.

 



 

 **6.9** **_Taxes_**.

 



 

(a) Each Party shall be responsible for and bear its own Income Taxes. Seller
shall retain responsibility for, and shall bear, all Asset Taxes for (i) any
period ending prior to the Effective Time and (ii) the portion of any Straddle
Period ending immediately prior to the Effective Time. All Asset Taxes arising
on or after the Effective Time (including the portion of any Straddle Period
beginning at the Effective Time) shall be allocated to and borne by Buyer. For
purposes of allocation between the Parties of Asset Taxes for any Straddle
Period, (A) Asset Taxes that are attributable to the severance or production
of Hydrocarbons shall be allocated based on severance or production occurring
before the Effective Time (which shall be Sellers responsibility) and from

 



       
 

 



 

and after the Effective Time (which shall be Buyers responsibility); (B)
Asset Taxes that are based upon or related to sales or receipts or imposed on
a transactional basis (other than such Asset Taxes described in clause (A))
shall be allocated based on transactions giving rise to such Asset Taxes
occurring before the Effective Time (which shall be Sellers responsibility)
and from and after the Effective Time (which shall be Buyers responsibility);
and (C) Asset Taxes that are ad valorem, property or other Asset Taxes imposed
on a periodic basis shall be allocated _pro rata_ per day between the portion
of the Straddle Period ending on and including the day immediately prior to
the day on which the Effective Time occurs (which shall be Sellers
responsibility) and the portion of the Straddle Period beginning on the day on
which the Effective Time occurs (which shall be Buyers responsibility). For
purposes of the preceding sentence, any exemption, deduction, credit or other
item that is calculated on an annual basis shall be allocated _pro rata_ per
day between the portion of the Straddle Period ending on and including the day
immediately prior to the day on which the Effective Time occurs and the
portion of the Straddle Period beginning on the day on which the Effective
Time occurs. To the extent the actual amount of any Asset Taxes described in
this _Section 6.9(a)_ is not determinable on the Closing Date or the Final
Settlement Date, Buyer and Seller shall utilize the most recent information
available in estimating the amount of such Asset Taxes for purposes of
_Section 2.9_. Upon determination of the actual amount of such Asset Taxes,
timely payments will be made from one Party to the other to the extent
necessary to cause each Party to bear the amount of such Asset Tax that is
allocable to such Party under this _Section 6.9(a)_.

 



 

(b) Except as required by applicable Law, Seller shall prepare and file or
cause to be prepared and filed all Tax Returns with respect to Asset Taxes,
and shall pay or cause to be paid all Asset Taxes with respect to such Tax
Returns, for all Tax periods that end before the Effective Time (regardless of
when due) and any Straddle Period (to the extent such Tax Returns are required
to be filed before the Closing Date). Buyer shall prepare and file or cause to
be prepared and filed all Tax Returns with respect to Asset Taxes, and shall
pay or cause to be paid all Asset Taxes with respect to such Tax Returns, for
any Straddle Period (to the extent such Tax Returns are required to be filed
on or after the Closing Date). Each Party shall indemnify and hold the other
Parties harmless for any failure to file such Tax Returns and to make such
payments. Each Party shall prepare all such Tax Returns relating to any
Straddle Period on a basis consistent with past practice except to the extent
otherwise required by applicable Law. Each Party shall provide the other Party
with a copy of any Tax Return relating to any Straddle Period for such other
Partys review at least ten (10) days prior to the due date for the filing of
such Tax Return (or within a commercially reasonable period after the end of
the relevant taxable period, if such Tax Return is required to be filed less
than ten (10) days after the close of such taxable period), and the filing
Party shall incorporate all reasonable comments of such other Party provided
to such filing Party in advance of the due date for the filing of such Tax
Return. The Parties agree that (x) this _Section 6.9(b)_ is intended to
solely address the timing and manner in which certain Tax Returns relating to
Asset Taxes are filed and the Asset Taxes with respect thereto are paid to the
applicable Governmental Authority, and (y) nothing in this _Section 6.9(b)_
shall be interpreted as altering the manner in which Asset Taxes are allocated
to and economically borne by the Parties in accordance with _Section 6.9(a)_.

 



 

(c) Buyer and Seller agree to furnish or cause to be furnished to the other,
upon request, as promptly as practicable, such information and assistance
relating to the Company Assets, including access to books and records, as is
reasonably necessary for the filing of all Tax

 



      
 

 



 

Returns by Buyer or Seller, the making of any election relating to Taxes, the
preparation for any audit by any taxing authority and the prosecution or
defense of any claim, suit or proceeding relating to any Tax. The Parties
agree to retain all books and records with respect to Tax matters pertinent to
the Company Assets relating to any Tax period beginning before the Closing
Date until sixty (60) days after the expiration of the statute of limitations
of the respective Tax periods (taking into account any extensions thereof) and
to abide by all record retention agreements entered into with any taxing
authority.

 



 

(d) Seller shall be entitled to any and all refunds of Asset Taxes allocated
to Seller pursuant to _Section 6.9(a)_, and Buyer shall be entitled to any
and all refunds of Asset Taxes allocated to Buyer pursuant to _Section
6.9(a)_. If a Party receives a refund of Asset Taxes to which the other Party
is entitled pursuant to this _Section 6.9(d)_, the first Party shall promptly
pay such amount to the other Party, net of any reasonable costs or expenses
incurred by the first Party in procuring such refund.

 



 

(e) Each of Seller and Buyer shall have the right at any time prior to Closing
to assign all or a portion of its rights under this Agreement to a Qualified
Intermediary (as that term is defined in Section 1.1031(k)-1(g)(4)(iii) of the
Treasury Regulations) or an Exchange Accommodation Titleholder (as that term
is defined in Rev. Proc. 2000-37, 2000-2 C.B. 308) in order to accomplish the
transaction in a manner that will comply, either in whole or in part, with the
requirements of a like-kind exchange pursuant to Section 1031 of the Code;
_provided_ , that (i) the Closing shall not be delayed or affected by reason
of such like-kind exchange or any actions taken by either Seller or Buyer in
connection with this _Section 6.9(e)_, (ii) an assignment under this _Section
6.9(e)_ shall not release any Party from its liabilities and obligations under
this Agreement nor shall the consummation or accomplishment of such like-kind
exchange be a condition to the Parties obligations under this Agreement;
(iii) the non-assigning Partys rights under this Agreement shall not be
altered or diminished in any manner; (iv) the assigning Party shall indemnify,
defend, and hold the Party that is not assigning harmless from all claims,
damages, liabilities, costs and expenses (including, but not limited to
reasonable legal fees and any additional Taxes, including Transfer Taxes) in
connection with such like-kind exchange; and (v) neither Party represents to
the other that any particular tax treatment will be given to either Party as a
result of any such assignment. In the event either Party assigns its rights
under this Agreement pursuant to this _Section 6.9(e)_, such Party agrees to
notify the other Party in writing of such assignment at or before Closing. If
Seller assigns its rights under this Agreement for this purpose, Buyer agrees
to (A) consent to Sellers assignment of its rights in this Agreement in the
form reasonably requested by the Qualified Intermediary, and (B) pay all or a
portion of the Adjusted Cash Purchase Price and any adjustments thereto into a
qualified escrow or qualified trust account at Closing as directed in writing.
If Buyer assigns its rights under this Agreement for this purpose, Seller
agrees to (I) consent to Buyers assignment of its rights in this Agreement in
the form reasonably requested by Buyers Qualified Intermediary or Exchange
Accommodation Titleholder (but in no event will Seller be required to transfer
the Company Assets in any form other than through a transfer of the Acquired
Interests and in no event will Seller be required to transfer the Acquired
Interests to more than one transferee (i.e., all of the Acquired Interests
will be transferred to a single transferee)), (II) accept all or a portion of
the payments payable under this Agreement from the account designated by
Buyers Qualified Intermediary or Exchange Accommodation Titleholder at
Closing, and (III) at Closing, subject to the limitations otherwise set forth
herein, convey and assign directly to Buyers Qualified Intermediary or
Buyers Exchange Accommodation Titleholder (as

 



      
 

 



 

directed in writing) the Acquired Interests which are the subject of this
Agreement upon satisfaction of the other conditions to Closing and other terms
and conditions hereof.

 



 

(f) Buyer shall use its reasonable best efforts to, after Closing, notify each
operator of each Well associated with the Company Assets of the change of the

as set forth in _Section 6.3_, Buyer will become privy to confidential and
other information of Seller and that such confidential information shall be
held confidential by Buyer and Buyers Representatives in accordance with the
terms of the Confidentiality Agreement and this _Section 6.10_.
Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement, upon Closing, all
obligations of Buyer under the terms of the Confidentiality Agreement shall
terminate as it relates to the Acquired Interests.

 



 

(b) Subject to _Section 6.7_, for a period of one (1) year from and after the
Closing Date, Seller shall, and shall cause its Affiliates to, not make
disclosure to Third Parties of any confidential or proprietary information
relating to Buyer or the Acquired Companies, except with the prior written
consent of Buyer or as required by, or requested pursuant to, applicable Law,
regulation or legal, judicial or administrative process (including an audit or
examination by a regulatory authority or self-regulatory organization), except
to the extent that such information (i) is generally available to the public
through no fault of Seller or any of its Affiliates committed following
Closing or (ii) is lawfully acquired by Seller or any of its Affiliates from
and after the Closing from sources which are not known to Seller to be
prohibited from disclosing such information by a legal, contractual or
fiduciary obligation to Buyer or the Acquired Companies; _provided_ ,
_however_ , that (x) nothing shall prohibit Seller or its Affiliates from
using their knowledge or mental impressions of such information or their
general knowledge of the industry or geographic area in the conduct of their
respective businesses following the Closing, (y) Seller and its Affiliates may
discuss (on a confidential basis) the underlying investment with respect to
the Acquired Companies and the acquisition or disposition of the Acquired
Companies in connection with legitimate fundraising activities or fund
performance reporting with current or prospective investors, lenders, or
partners.

 **6.12** **_Company Indebtedness_**. In connection with the Closing, Seller
shall obtain a release of Liens in respect of the Company Assets under the
Credit Agreement and a release of the Acquired Companies as borrowers
thereunder (the " _Release Letters_ "). The Release Letters shall (a) indicate

prepayment premiums, penalties, breakage costs or similar obligations (other
than Ordinary Course and contingent indemnification obligations) related to
the Company Indebtedness (the " _Payoff Amount_ "), (b) state that all Liens
in connection therewith relating to the Company Assets shall be,

satisfied until the Closing Date, but each of which in the case of (C) shall
be capable of being satisfied on the Closing Date) have been satisfied,
consummating the Debt Financing at or prior to Closing, (v) drawing the full
amount of the Debt Financing contemplated by the Debt Commitment Letter in the
event that the Financing Conditions in the Debt Commitment Letter (other than
(A) the availability or funding of any Equity Financing, (B) any conditions in
the Debt Commitment Letter that are within the control of Buyer and (C) those
conditions in the Debt Commitment Letter that by their terms cannot be
satisfied until the Closing Date, but each of which in the case of (C) shall
be capable of being satisfied on the Closing Date) have been satisfied, (vi)
enforcing its rights under the Debt Commitment Letter, including through
litigation against the Financing Sources pursued in good faith in the event of
breach or purported breach thereof. Subject to the terms and conditions of
this Agreement and the applicable terms and conditions of the Preferred Unit
Purchase Agreement, Buyer shall use reasonable best efforts to take (or cause
to be taken) all actions and do (or cause to be done) all things necessary,
proper or advisable to (x) obtain the Equity Financing contemplated by the
Preferred Unit Purchase Agreement simultaneously with the receipt of the Debt
Financing, (y) maintain in effect the Preferred Unit Purchase Agreement,

 



      
 

 



 

(z) satisfy (or obtain a waiver of) on a timely basis all conditions
applicable to Buyer as set forth in the Preferred Unit Purchase Agreement that
are within its control and (vii) consummating the Equity Financing
contemplated by the Preferred Unit Purchase Agreement at or prior to Closing.

 



 

(b) Except with the prior written consent of Seller, Buyer shall not agree to
any amendment, modification or waiver of the Debt Commitment Letter that (i)
reduces the amount of aggregate cash proceeds available from the Debt
Financing below the amount necessary to finance the transactions to be
consummated on the Closing Date (including by changing the amount of fees to
be paid or original issue discount to be charged), (ii) imposes new or
additional conditions, or expands, amends or modifies any existing conditions,
to the receipt of the Debt Financing in a manner that would reasonably be
expected to delay or prevent the Closing (it being understood and agreed that
Buyer may, without the consent of Seller, (A) amend or otherwise modify the
Debt Commitment Letter to add lenders, lead arrangers, bookrunners,
syndication agents or similar entities that have not executed the Debt
Commitment Letter as of the date of this Agreement or (B) amend or modify the
Debt Commitment Letter to implement the flex provisions set forth in the Fee
Letter), or (iii) amends or modifies any other term in a manner reasonably
likely to delay, prevent or impair the ability of the Buyer to consummate the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement or adversely impact the ability of
the Buyer to enforce its rights against the other parties to the Debt
Commitment Letter. Except with the prior written consent of Seller, Buyer
shall not agree to any amendment, modification or waiver of the Preferred Unit
Purchase Agreement that (A) reduces the amount of aggregate cash proceeds
available from the Equity Financing below the amount necessary to finance the
transactions to be consummated on the Closing Date, (B) imposes new or
additional conditions, or expands, amends or modifies any existing conditions,
to the receipt of the Equity Financing in a manner that would reasonably be
expected to delay or prevent the Closing, or (C) amends or modifies any other
term in a manner reasonably likely to delay, prevent or impair the ability of
the Buyer to consummate the transactions contemplated by this Agreement or
adversely impact the ability of the Buyer to enforce its rights against the
other parties to the Preferred Unit Purchase Agreement.

 



 

(c) If any portion of the Debt Financing becomes unavailable on the terms and
conditions (including the flex provisions set forth in the Fee Letter)
contemplated in the Debt Commitment Letter (other than due to the breach by
Seller of any representation, warranty or covenant contained herein or as a
result of the failure of a condition contained herein to be satisfied by
Seller), Buyer shall use its reasonable best efforts to arrange to obtain
alternative financing from alternative sources in an amount sufficient, when
taken together with any then-available Financing, to consummate the
transactions contemplated hereunder (" _Alternate Financing_ ") and, if
obtained, will provide Seller with a correct and complete copy of, new
financing commitment or commitments that provide for an amount sufficient,
when taken together with any then-available Financing, to consummate the
transactions contemplated hereunder and subject to the same (or no less
favorable to Seller) Financing Conditions (taken as a whole) as the prior Debt
Commitment Letter (the " _New Debt Commitment Letter_ "). In the event an
Alternate Financing is obtained (i) in full and a New Debt Commitment Letter
is entered into, references in this Agreement to the Debt Commitment Letter
shall be deemed to refer to the New Debt Commitment Letter or (ii) in part and
a New Debt Commitment Letter is entered into, references in this Agreement to
the Debt Commitment Letter shall be deemed to include the New Debt Commitment
Letter and the then-existing Debt Commitment Letter.

 



      
 

 



 

(d) Buyer shall use reasonable best efforts to keep Seller reasonably informed
with respect to material activity concerning the status of the Financing.
Without limiting the foregoing, Buyer agrees to notify Seller promptly after
obtaining knowledge thereof, if at any time (i) any Debt Commitment Letter or
Preferred Unit Purchase Agreement shall expire or be terminated for any reason
or (ii) any Financing Source breaches, repudiates or threatens in writing to
breach or repudiation of any Debt Commitment Letter or the Preferred Unit
Purchase Agreement or notifies Buyer in writing that such Financing Source no
longer intends to provide financing to Buyer on the terms set forth therein
(or on terms not materially less favorable to Buyer, taken as a whole, except
as agreed to by Seller) (including, to the extent the same are exercised, the
flex provisions set forth in the Fee Letter), or (iii) for any reason Buyer no
longer believes in good faith that it will be able to obtain all or any
portion of the Financing in an amount sufficient to consummate the
transactions contemplated hereunder. Buyer shall not, without the prior
written consent of Seller, take or fail to take any action or enter into any
transaction that would reasonably be expected to result in a failure of any
conditions to obtaining the Financing in an amount sufficient to consummate
the transactions contemplated hereunder.

 



 

(e) Without limiting the generality of _Section 6.14(a)_, from and after the
date of this Agreement and until the Closing Date, Seller shall, and shall
cause Services and its officers and employees to, use reasonable best efforts
to direct their consultants, accountants, reserve engineers, agents and
representatives to, during customary business hours and provided that such
efforts do not unreasonably interfere with the business operations of Seller
and its the Acquired Companies, cooperate with Buyer, independent auditors
chosen by Buyer (" _Buyer s Auditor_") or any Financing Source in connection
with any audit by Buyers Auditor of any financial statements of the Acquired
Companies or reserve reports with respect to the Company Oil and Gas
Properties or other actions that Buyer or any of its Affiliates or any
Financing Source reasonably require to comply with the requirements under
state and federal securities Laws or to consummate the Financing ( _provided_
, that such requested cooperation does not unreasonably interfere with the
ongoing business of Seller). Such cooperation will include (i) reasonable
access to Sellers and the Acquired Companies officers, managers, employees,
consultants, agents and representatives who were responsible for preparing or
maintaining the financial records and work papers and other supporting
documents used in the preparation of such financial statements as may be
required by Buyers Auditor to perform an audit or conduct a review in
accordance with generally accepted auditing standards or to otherwise verify
such financial statements, (ii) using commercially reasonable efforts to
obtain the consent of the independent auditor(s) and reserve engineer(s) of
Seller or the Acquired Companies (as applicable) that conducted any audit of
such financial statements or prepared any reserve reports to be named as an
expert in (A) any filings that may be made by Buyer under the Securities Act
or required by the Commission under securities Laws applicable to Buyer or any
report required to be filed by Buyer under the Exchange Act in connection with
the transactions contemplated by this Agreement or (B) any offering memorandum
for any equity or debt financing of Buyer, (iii) providing information in
connection with Buyers preparation of responses to any inquiries by
regulatory authorities relating to the foregoing financial statements and/or
reserve reports, (iv) furnishing information to Buyer or any Financing Source
with respect to the Acquired Companies or Seller (as applicable) as may be
reasonably requested by Buyer or such Financing Source in order to arrange,
market or consummate any such Financing, (v) providing customary access to
information for any Financing Source to perform its due diligence in
connection with any such Financing, and causing senior management of Seller to
participate in reasonably scheduled diligence meetings in connection with

 



      
 

 



 

such Financing, (vi) providing information with respect to property
descriptions of the Company Assets necessary to execute and record a deed of
trust for any such Financing, (vii) assisting with the preparation of
materials for rating agency presentations, bank information memoranda and
similar documents required in connection with any such Financing, (viii)
causing the Acquired Companies to execute and deliver and pledge and security
documents, definitive financing documents or other certificates or documents
or otherwise facilitate the pledging of collateral for delivery at the
consummation of the Financing on and as of Closing, as reasonably requested by
Buyer, (ix) using reasonable best efforts to provide, at least ten (10)
Business Days prior to the Closing, all documentation and other information
about the Acquired Companies as is reasonably requested by Buyer which relates
to applicable "know your customer" and anti-money laundering rules and
regulations including without limitation the USA PATRIOT ACT, (x) delivery of
one or more customary representation letters from Seller or the Acquired
Companies (as applicable) to the auditor of the Audited Financial Statements
that are reasonably requested by Buyer to allow such auditors to complete an
audit (or review of any financial statements) and to issue an opinion with
respect to an audit of those financial statements required pursuant to this
_Section 6.14(e)_ and (xi) using commercially reasonable efforts to cause the
independent auditor(s) or reserve engineer(s) of Seller or the Acquired
Companies (as applicable) that conducted any audit of such financial
statements to provide customary "comfort letters" to any underwriter or
purchaser in connection with any equity or debt financing of Buyer.
Notwithstanding the foregoing, (x) nothing herein shall expand Sellers
representations, warranties, covenants or agreements set forth in this
Agreement or give Buyer, its Affiliates, or any third Person any rights to
which it is not entitled hereunder, (y) nothing in this _Section 6.14(e)_
shall require travel or the obligation to incur any out-of-pocket costs by any
of the subject Persons in order to comply with the terms of this _Section
6.14(e)_ and (z) Buyer will make reasonable efforts to minimize any disruption
associated with the cooperation contemplated by such Persons hereby. In each
case, such cooperation by Seller pursuant to this _Section 6.14(e)_ shall be
at Buyers written request with reasonable prior notice to Seller, and no such
cooperation by Seller shall be required to the extent it could cause any
representation or warranty in this Agreement to be breached, cause any
condition to the Closing set forth in _Article 7_ to fail to be satisfied or
otherwise cause any breach of this Agreement. Sellers agreement under this
_Section 6.14(e)_ is an accommodation by Seller to Buyer and is not a
condition to Buyers obligations under this Agreement. For the avoidance of
doubt, nothing in this _Section 6.14_ or any action or inaction taken
hereunder, shall excuse or waive Buyers obligations to consummate the
transactions in accordance with this Agreement. Seller shall not have any
liability or responsibility to (1) any Financing Source or (2) Buyer with
respect to the accuracy or completeness of any information delivered pursuant
to this _Section 6.14(e)_.

 



 

(f) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary herein, it is understood and
agreed that: (i) the condition precedent set forth in _Section 7.1(b)_, as
applied to Sellers obligations under this _Section 6.14_, shall be deemed to
be satisfied unless the Financing contemplated by the Debt Commitment Letter
has not been obtained as a direct result of Sellers willful breach of its
obligations under this _Section 6.14_; (ii) such assistance shall not require
Seller or any of its Affiliates to agree to any contractual obligation
relating to the Financing that is not conditioned upon the Closing, that does
not terminate without liability to Seller or any of its Affiliates upon the
termination of this Agreement or that would subject Seller or its Affiliates
to any liability; (iii) in each case, Sellers cooperation pursuant to the
provisions of this _Section 6.14_ shall be at Buyers sole cost and expense,
and on the Closing Date or following the termination of this Agreement, Buyer
shall promptly reimburse Seller for all reasonable and documented out-of-
pocket costs and

 



      
 

 



 

expenses incurred by Seller or its Affiliates in connection with such
cooperation; (iv) Buyer shall indemnify and hold harmless Seller and its
Affiliates and their respective directors, officers, employees and agents from
and against any and all Losses by any such Persons suffered or incurred in
connection with the Financing or any assistance or activities provided in
connection therewith other than to the extent such Losses arise from gross
negligence, willful misconduct or bad faith of Seller, its Affiliates and
their respective directors, officers, employees and agents; (v) Seller shall
have the right (prior to Closing) to review any presentations or other
material written information prepared by Buyer or its Affiliates prior to the
dissemination of such materials to potential investors, lenders or other
counterparties to any proposed financing transaction (or filing with any
Governmental Authority); (vi) except to the extent disclosed to potential
investors and lenders in connection with the Financing (who shall hold such
confidential information confidential), all non-public or otherwise
confidential information regarding Seller or the Company Assets obtained by
Buyer or its representatives shall be kept confidential in accordance with the
Confidentiality Agreement; (vii) Seller shall not be required to deliver or
cause the delivery of any legal opinions or accountants comfort letters or
reliance letters or make any representations in connection with the Financing;
(viii) the assistance described in this _Section 6.14_ shall not require
Seller to take any action that Seller reasonably believes could result in a
violation of any material agreement or any confidentiality arrangement or the
loss of any legal or other applicable privilege; and (ix) Seller shall not be
required to provide any information to Buyer or any Financing Source that is
not then in Sellers or its Affiliates possession.

 



 

 **6.15** **_No Shop_**. Until the earlier of the occurrence of Closing or the
termination of this Agreement pursuant to _Article 8_:

 



 

(a) Seller and its Affiliates shall, and shall direct each of their
Representatives to, immediately cease any discussions or negotiations with any
Persons with respect to any Third Party Acquisition or any proposal reasonably
likely to lead to a Third Party Acquisition. From the date of this Agreement
until the Closing, Seller shall not, and shall not authorize or permit any of
its Affiliates or any of their respective Representatives to, and shall not
resolve or propose to, directly or indirectly, encourage, solicit, participate
in or initiate discussions, negotiations, inquiries, proposals or offers
(including any proposal or offer to their shareholders) with or from or
provide any non-public information to any Person or group of Persons
concerning any Third Party Acquisition or any inquiry, proposal or offer
reasonably likely to lead to a Third Party Acquisition.

 



 

(b) Seller shall not, and shall cause its subsidiaries not to, enter into any
agreement, letter of intent, memorandum of understanding, agreement in
principle, acquisition agreement, merger agreement, option agreement, joint
venture agreement, partnership agreement or other agreement constituting or
directly related to, or which is reasonably likely to lead to, a Third Party
Acquisition or any proposal for a Third Party Acquisition.

 



 

(c) For the purposes of this Agreement, " _Third Party Acquisition_ " shall
mean the occurrence of any acquisition, directly or indirectly, in one or a
series of related transactions, whether by sale, merger or otherwise, of all
or any part of the Acquired Interests or any portion of the Company Assets.

 



      
 

 



 

 **6.16** **_Lock-Up_**. During the period beginning on the Closing Date and
ending on the one hundred eightieth (180th) day after the Closing Date
(excluding the Closing Date for purposes of calculating such date) (the "
_Lock-Up Period_ "), Seller will not lend, offer, pledge, sell, contract to
sell, sell any option or contract to purchase, purchase any option or contract
to sell, grant any option, right, or warrant to purchase, or otherwise
transfer or dispose of, directly or indirectly, any Common Units, whether any
such transaction is to be settled by delivery of Common Units or other
securities, in cash, or otherwise. In the interest of clarity, nothing in this
_Section 6.16_ shall restrict Seller from (x) utilizing customary hedging
strategies that may involve the pledge of Common Units as collateral until
such time as the Common Units are ultimately disposed on or after expiration
of the Lock-Up Period or (y) filing a registration statement with respect to
the Common Units in accordance with the Registration Rights Agreement and in
compliance with the Securities Act. Nothing in this _Section 6.16_ shall
prohibit or limit the ability of Seller or any Seller Holder to effect any
transfer of Common Units (a) as a bona fide gift or gifts or any other similar
transfer or distribution that does not involve a sale or other disposition for
value, (b) to any such Persons limited partners, members or stockholders as
part of a distribution, (c) to any corporation, partnership or other entity
that is an Affiliate of such Person, in each case of the forgoing clauses (a)
through (c), so long as (x) such transfer does not occur prior to the
consummation of the Election and (y) the transferee agrees in writing to be
bound by all the terms of this _Section 6.16_, (d) pursuant to a bona fide
third party tender offer, merger, consolidation or other similar transaction
made to all holders of Common Units or (e) pursuant to an order of a court or
regulatory agency.

 



 

 **6.17** **_Election; Voting Agreements_**.

 



 

(a) As soon as reasonably practicable following the Closing Date, Buyer shall,
in consultation with Seller, prepare and file an information statement (the "
_Information Statement_ ") with the SEC in connection with the taking of
action by written authorization or consent of unitholders with respect to (i)
a proposal to change Buyers U.S. federal Income Tax status from a partnership
to an entity taxable as a corporation for U.S. federal Income Tax purposes by
means of a "check-the-box" election, "up-C" structure, a combination thereof
or otherwise, as well as to approve an amendment to Buyers limited
partnership agreement in connection therewith (collectively, the " _Election_
") and (ii) an amendment to the Kimbell Royalty GP, LLC 2017 Long-Term
Incentive Plan (the " _LTIP_ ") to appropriately reflect the Election and to
increase the number of units eligible for issuance thereunder solely to the
extent set forth in this _Section 6.17_. Buyer shall use its reasonable best
efforts to resolve all SEC comments with respect to the Information Statement
as promptly as reasonably practicable after receipt thereof and to have the
Information Statement cleared by the SEC (or the staff of the SEC) as promptly
as reasonably practicable after such filing. Buyer shall, as soon as
reasonably practicable following confirmation by the SEC (or the staff of the
SEC) that it has no further comments on the Information Statement, take all
action necessary to set a record date for the taking of action by written
authorization or consent with respect to the matters described in this
_Section 6.17_. From the Execution Date until the date the Information
Statement is filed, each Party shall, and shall cause its Representatives to,
consult and cooperate in good faith with the other Party and its
Representatives to agree on a tax-efficient structure to effectuate the
Election, taking into account (x) the retention of a commercially reasonable
tax shield for the benefit of Buyer and its existing Common Unit holders, (y)
structuring options that maximize tax efficiency for the Seller Holders
(including taking into account the availability of future deductions to the
taxable income of Buyer) receiving Common Units pursuant

 



      
 

 



 

to this Agreement, which options may include the use of an "up-C" structure
and an associated restructuring of the issuance of Common Units issued
pursuant to this Agreement and (z) any amendments to the LTIP and any of the
other agreements contemplated by this Agreement reasonably necessary or
advisable in connection with the Election; _provided_ , however, that (for the
avoidance of doubt and assuming the Parties compliance with the covenants
contained in this _Section 6.17(a)_) failure by the Parties to agree on such
a structure shall not by itself constitute a breach of either Partys covenant
in this _Section 6.17(a)_ to consult and cooperate in good faith with the
other Party and its Representatives.

 



 

(b) Prior to the date that is one hundred eighty (180) days after the Closing
Date (excluding the Closing Date for purposes of calculating such date),
Seller, in its capacity as a unitholder of Buyer, irrevocably and
unconditionally agrees that, so long as Buyer has complied with its covenants
in _Section 6.17(a)_, at any meeting of unitholders of Buyer (whether annual
or special and whether or not such meeting is adjourned or postponed), however
called, including any adjournment or postponement thereof, or in connection
with any written authorization or consent of unitholders of Buyer, Seller
shall, and shall cause any holder of record of any Common Units beneficially
owned by Seller (such Common Units beneficially owned by Seller at such time,
the " _Covered Units_ ") to (i) when a meeting is held, appear at such meeting
or otherwise cause such Covered Units to be counted as present thereat for the
purpose of establishing a quorum, and, when a record date is set for an action
by written consent, respond to each request by Buyer for written consent, if
any, and (ii) vote (or consent), or cause to be voted at such meeting (or
validly execute and return and cause such consent to be granted within the
time period requested by Buyer with respect to), all such Covered Units
beneficially owned by Seller as of the record date for the unitholder meeting
or action by written consent in favor of:

 



 

(i) the Election; and

 



 

(ii) the proposal by Buyer to reflect any revisions as may be necessary or
appropriate to reflect the Election and to amend the LTIP to proportionately
increase the number of Common Units eligible for issuance under the LTIP after
taking into account the aggregate number of Common Units (the " _Additional
Common Units_ ") (A) to be issued under this Agreement and the HR Purchase
Agreement, (B) issuable upon conversion of any Series A Preferred Units of
Buyer that are issued on the Closing Date pursuant to the Preferred Equity
Purchase Agreement and the HR Purchase Agreement, assuming such Series A
Preferred Units converted on the Closing Date (which amount for this purpose
shall not exceed 5,945,946 Common Units); and (C) an additional 4,054,054
Common Units. The aggregate Additional Common Units shall not exceed
20,000,000 Common Units, and the aggregate number of Common Units eligible for
issuance under the LTIP shall not exceed twelve and a half percent (12.5%) of
the sum of (I) the aggregate Common Units of Buyer outstanding at such time
(which shall include the number of Common Units issued under this Agreement
and the HR Purchase Agreement and issuable upon conversion of any Series A
Preferred Units of Buyer that are issued on the Closing Date pursuant to the
Preferred Equity Purchase Agreement assuming such Series A Preferred Units
converted on the Closing Date (which amount for this purpose shall not exceed
5,945,946 Common Units), but without regard to any Common Units that were
issued under the LTIP) and (II) the aggregate number of Common Units eligible
for issuance under the LTIP. For illustrative purposes only, a sample
calculation of the Additional Common Units and the total

 



       
 

 



 

proportionate increase in number of Common Units eligible for issuance under
the LTIP after taking into account the Additional Common Units is set forth on
_Schedule 6.17_.

 



 

 **6.18** **_Additional Listing Application_**. As promptly as practicable
after the date of this Agreement, but in any event after taking into
consideration the rules and regulations of the New York Stock Exchange with
respect to the timing of the Additional Listing Application (as hereinafter
defined) and the supporting documents required to accompany the Additional
Listing Application, Buyer shall submit to the New York Stock Exchange an
additional listing application relating to the Unadjusted Common Unit
Consideration (the " _Additional Listing Application_ ") and shall use its
commercially reasonable efforts to secure the New York Stock Exchanges
approval of the Additional Listing Application, subject to official notice of
issuance.

 



 

 **6.19** **_Delivery of Interim Financial Statements_**. As soon as
reasonably practicable following the Execution Date (and in any event within
thirty (30) days of the Execution Date), Seller shall use its commercially
reasonable efforts to deliver to Buyer unaudited balance sheets of the
Acquired Companies as of, and for the three (3) months ended, March 31, 2018
and 2017, together with the related unaudited statements of income, changes in
owners equity, and cash flow for the periods then ended. To the extent such
financial statements are not delivered prior to the Closing, the preparation
and delivery thereof shall be made pursuant to the terms of the Transition
Services Agreement. All costs and expenses associated with Sellers compliance
with this _Section 6.19_ shall be the responsibility of Buyer.

 



 

 **6.20** **_Transition Services Agreement_**. At the Closing, Services and

Cash Escrow Amount to Seller, or (ii) in lieu of terminating this Agreement,
seek all remedies available at Law or in equity, including specific

of the Acquired Interests and to sell, transfer, encumber or otherwise dispose
of the Acquired Interests to any Person without any restriction under this
Agreement. The Parties agree that the foregoing described liquidated damages
in clause (i) of this _Section 8.3(a)_ are reasonable considering all of the
circumstances existing as of the date of this Agreement and constitute the
Parties good faith estimate of the actual damages reasonably expected to
result from such termination of this Agreement by Seller. Buyer waives any
requirement for the posting of a bond, or showing of irreparable injury, in
connection with any equitable relief hereunder in favor of Seller and Buyer

8.1(c)_, then Buyer shall be entitled to (i) terminate this Agreement, receive
return of the Cash Escrow Amount from the Escrow Agent, in which case the

Buyer, and may pursue a claim for actual damages against Seller in an amount
up to the amount of the Cash Escrow Amount, or (ii) in lieu of terminating
this Agreement, seek all remedies available at Law or in equity, including
specific performance.

 



      
 

 



 

In the event Buyer seeks specific performance in accordance with the preceding
sentence and specific performance is not granted, Buyer shall have the right
to terminate this Agreement, receive return of the Cash Escrow Amount from the
Escrow Agent, in which case the Parties shall cause the Escrow Agent to
release the Cash Escrow Amount to Buyer, and may pursue a claim for actual
damages against Seller in an amount up to the amount of the Cash Escrow
Amount. Seller waives any requirement for the posting of a bond, or showing of
irreparable injury, in connection with any equitable relief hereunder in favor
of Buyer and Seller agrees not to challenge any such equitable relief sought
in accordance with this _Section 8.3(b)_.

 



 

(c) If Seller has the right to terminate this Agreement pursuant to _Section
8.1(g)_, Buyer shall promptly pay to Seller an amount in cash equal to ten
percent (10%) of the Unadjusted Cash Purchase Price.

 



 

(d) If this Agreement terminates for reasons other than those set forth in
_Sections 8.3(a)_, _8.3(b)_ or _8.3(c)_ , then (i) the Parties shall have no
liability or obligation hereunder as a result of such termination, (ii) each
of the Parties shall, within five (5) Business Days of the date this Agreement
is terminated, execute and deliver written instructions to the Escrow Agent
instructing the Escrow Agent to return the Cash Escrow Amount to Buyer free
and clear of any claims thereon by Seller, and (iii) Seller shall be free
immediately to enjoy all rights of ownership of the Acquired Interests and to
sell, transfer, encumber or otherwise dispose of the Acquired Interests to any
Person without any restriction under this Agreement.

 



 

(e) Upon termination of this Agreement, (i) each Party shall return to the
other Party or destroy (at the receiving Partys option and expense) all
confidential information furnished by or on behalf of a Party in connection
with its due diligence investigation of the Acquired Interests and Company
Assets or Buyer (as applicable) and (ii) an officer of the receiving Party
shall promptly certify the receiving Partys compliance with preceding clause
(i) to the disclosing Party in writing.

Closing, if performance is solely required prior to or concurrently with the
Closing and (b) upon the expiration by their terms of the obligations of the

in the period from and after the Closing; _provided_ , that the covenants
contained in _Section 6.1_ and _Section 6.2_ shall survive the Closing until
the date that is 180 days after the Closing Date. Representations, warranties,
covenants and agreements shall terminate and be of no further force and effect
after the respective date of their expiration, after which time no claim may
be asserted thereunder by any Person, provided, that notwithstanding the

specific claim for indemnification hereunder delivered to the applicable Party

advisors, representatives and agents (collectively, the " _Buyer Indemnified
Parties_ "), from, against and in respect of any and all Losses suffered or
incurred by any of the Buyer Indemnified Parties or to which any of the Buyer

of this _Section 9.2_, (i) an inaccuracy or breach of a representation or
warranty (other than _Sections 4.5(d)_ or _4.6_ or any reference to
"Material" in the term "Seller Material Contract") shall be deemed to exist
either if such representation or warranty is actually inaccurate or breached
or would have been inaccurate or breached if such representation or warranty
had not contained any limitation or qualification as to materiality or Company
Material Adverse Effect (which instead will be read as any adverse effect or
change), and (ii) the amount of Losses in respect of any breach of a
representation or warranty (including any deemed breach resulting from the
application of clause (i) but excluding _Section 4.6(a)_ and any reference to
"Material" in the term "Seller Material

 



      
 

 



 

Contract") shall be determined without regard to any limitation or
qualification as to materiality or Company Material Adverse Effect (which
instead will be read as any adverse effect or change) set forth in such
representation or warranty.

 



 

 **9.3** **_Indemnification Obligations of Buyer_**.

 



 

(a) Subject to the other terms of this _Article 9_, from and after the
Closing Date, Buyer shall indemnify, defend and hold harmless Seller, its
Affiliates, and its and their respective officers, directors, employees,
consultants, advisors, representatives and agents (collectively, the " _Seller

 **9.4** **_Indemnification Procedure_**.

 



 

(a) Promptly after receipt by a Buyer Indemnified Party or a Seller
Indemnified Party (hereinafter collectively referred to as an " _Indemnified
Party_ ") of notice by a Third Party (including any Governmental Authority) of
any claim for Losses or the commencement of a Proceeding or audit with respect
to which such Indemnified Party may be entitled to receive payment hereunder
for any Buyer Losses or any Seller Losses (as the case may be), such
Indemnified Party will notify Buyer or Seller, as the case may be (in such
capacity, Buyer or Seller

 



      
 

 



 

is hereinafter referred to as an " _Indemnifying Party_ ") of such claim,
Proceeding or audit; _provided_ , _however_ , that the failure to so notify
the Indemnifying Party will not relieve the Indemnifying Party from liability
under this Agreement except to the extent, and only to the extent, that such
failure materially prejudices the Indemnifying Party. The Indemnifying Party
will have the right, at its sole expense, upon written notice delivered to the
Indemnified Party within fifteen (15) days after receiving such notice, to
assume the defense of such Proceeding with counsel selected by the
Indemnifying Party and reasonably satisfactory to the Indemnified Party. In
the event, however, that the Indemnifying Party declines or fails to (i)
assume the defense of the Proceeding on the terms provided above or to
prosecute such defense in good faith or (ii) employ counsel reasonably
satisfactory to the Indemnified Party, in any case within such fifteen (15)
day period, then such Indemnified Party may employ counsel to represent or
defend it in any such Proceeding and the Indemnifying Party will (subject to
the other terms and provisions of this Agreement) pay the reasonable fees and
disbursements of such counsel as incurred. In any Proceeding with respect to
which indemnification is being sought hereunder, the Indemnified Party or the
Indemnifying Party, whichever is not assuming the defense of such Proceeding,
will have the right to participate in such matter and to retain its own
counsel at such Partys own expense. The Indemnifying Party or the Indemnified
Party, as the case may be, will at all times use reasonable best efforts to
(x) diligently conduct the defense of any Proceeding for which it is
maintaining the defense, (y) keep the Indemnified Party or the Indemnifying
Party, as the case may be, reasonably apprised of the status of the defense of
any Proceeding the defense of which they are maintaining and (z) cooperate in
good faith with each other with respect to the defense of any such Proceeding;
provided, that the Indemnified Party shall not be required to bring counter-
claims or cross-claims against any Person.

 



 

(b) No Indemnified Party may settle or compromise any claim or Proceeding or
consent to the entry of any judgment with respect to which indemnification is
being sought hereunder without the prior written consent of the Indemnifying
Party, unless such settlement, compromise or consent (i) includes an
unconditional release of the Indemnifying Party from all liability arising out
of such Proceeding, (ii) does not contain any admission or statement of any
wrongdoing or liability on behalf of the Indemnifying Party and (iii) does not
contain any equitable order, judgment or term that in any manner affects,
restrains or interferes with the business of the Indemnifying Party or any of
the Indemnifying Partys Affiliates. An Indemnifying Party may not, without
the prior written consent of the Indemnified Party, settle or compromise any
Proceeding or consent to the entry of any judgment with respect to which
indemnification is being sought hereunder that (A) does not result in a final,
non-appealable, resolution of the Indemnified Partys liability with respect
to the Proceeding (including, in the case of a settlement, an unconditional
written release of the Indemnified Party from all further liability in respect
of such Proceeding) or (B) may adversely affect the Indemnified Party (other
than as a result of money damages covered by the indemnity), which consent
shall not be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed.

 



 

(c) A claim for indemnification by an Indemnified Party for any matter not
involving a Proceeding by a Third Party may be asserted by Buyer (on behalf of
the Buyer Indemnified Parties) or Seller (on behalf of the Seller Indemnified
Parties), as applicable, by written notice to the Indemnifying Party from whom
indemnification is sought. Such notice will specify with reasonable
specificity the basis for such claim. The Indemnifying Party shall have thirty
(30) days from its receipt of the notice to (i) cure the Losses complained of,
(ii) admit its liability for such Losses or (iii) dispute the claim for such
Losses. If the Indemnifying Party does

 



      
 

 



 

not notify the Indemnified Party within such thirty (30) day period that it
has cured the Losses or that it disputes the claim for such Losses, the amount
of such Losses shall conclusively be deemed disputed by the Indemnifying Party
hereunder. If the Indemnifying Party notifies the Indemnified Party within
such thirty (30) day period that it disputes the claim for such Losses, then
the Indemnified Party may continue to seek remedies available to it on the
terms and subject to the provisions of this Agreement.

 



 

 **9.5** **_Calculation, Timing, Manner and Characterization of
Indemnification Payments; Escrow_**.

 



 

(a) Payments of all amounts owing by an Indemnifying Party as a result of a
Third-Party Claim shall be made as and when Losses with respect thereto are
incurred by the Indemnified Party and within fifteen (15) Business Days after
the Indemnified Party makes demand therefor to the Indemnifying Party.
Payments of all amounts owing by an Indemnifying Party other than as a result
of a Third-Party Claim shall be made within fifteen (15) Business Days after
the later of (i) the date the Indemnifying Party is deemed liable therefor
pursuant to this _Article 9_ (whether because the Indemnifying Party admits
or acknowledges liability or otherwise) or (ii) if disputed, the date of a
Final Determination of the Indemnifying Partys liability to the Indemnified
Party under this Agreement.

 



 

(b) Once a payment is owed and payable as set forth in _Section 9.5(a)_, in
circumstances where amounts are owing to any Buyer Indemnified Party from
Seller in accordance with this Agreement, then Buyer and Seller shall execute
a Joint Instruction Letter to instruct the Escrow Agent to pay such amount to
the Buyer Indemnified Party through a combination of Indemnity Escrow Units
and Cash Escrow Amount with a total value equal to the amount to be so
disbursed (valuing such Indemnity Escrow Units at the Per Unit Value), in
portions of Indemnity Escrow Units and Cash Escrow Amounts determined by
Seller in its sole discretion, with the number of Indemnity Escrow Units
elected by Seller to be disbursed valued at the Per Unit Value.
Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, no fractional Common Units
shall be disbursed from the General Escrow Account, and, to the extent that
any such fractional units would be required to be so disbursed but for this
sentence, such fractional units shall be rounded up or down to the nearest
whole number of the applicable Common Units.

 



 

(c) _Escrow Release_.

 



 

(i) On the date that is 180 days after the Closing Date (such date, the "
_General Escrow First Release Date_ "), an amount equal to one-half (1/2) of
the balance of the General Escrow Balance, minus the aggregate amount, if any,
which any Buyer Indemnified Party has claimed under this _Article 9_ to the
extent such amount exceeds that amount of the General Escrow Balance to be
released pursuant to this _Section 9.5(c)(i)_ (to the extent such claims, if
any, remain unresolved), shall be released to the Seller Holders. Seller and
Buyer shall promptly (but in any event within five (5) Business Days of the
General Escrow First Release Date) execute a Joint Instruction Letter to
instruct the Escrow Agent to transfer to Seller and each Seller Holder, as
applicable, such amount to be released under this _Section 9.5(c)(i)_ through
a combination of Indemnity Escrow Units and Cash Escrow Amount with a total
value equal to the amount to be so released (valuing such Indemnity Escrow
Units at the Per Unit Value), in portions of Indemnity Escrow Units and Cash
Escrow Amounts determined by Seller in its sole discretion, with the

 



       
 

 



 

number of Indemnity Escrow Units elected by Seller to be released valued at
the Per Unit Value, to an account or accounts designated by Seller pursuant to
the Joint Instruction Letter.

 



 

(ii) On the one (1) year anniversary of the Closing Date (such date, the "
_General Escrow Second Release Date_ "), an amount equal to the balance of the
General Escrow Balance, minus the aggregate amount, if any, which any Buyer
Indemnified Party has claimed under this _Article 9_ (to the extent such
claims, if any, remain unresolved) shall be released to the Seller Holders.
Seller and Buyer shall promptly (but in any event within five (5) Business
Days of the General Escrow First Release Date) execute a Joint Instruction
Letter to instruct the Escrow Agent to transfer to Seller and each Seller
Holder, as applicable such amount to be released under this _Section
9.5(c)(ii)_ through a combination of Indemnity Escrow Units and Cash Escrow
Amount with a total value equal to the amount to be so released (valuing such
Indemnity Escrow Units at the Per Unit Value), in portions of Indemnity Escrow
Units and Cash Escrow Amounts determined by Seller in its sole discretion,
with the number of Indemnity Escrow Units elected by Seller to be released
valued at the Per Unit Value, to an account or accounts designated by Seller
pursuant to the Joint Instruction Letter.

 



 

(iii) Upon the resolution of all such outstanding claims described in the
first sentence of _Section 9.5(c)(ii)_, Seller and Buyer shall promptly (but
in any event within five (5) Business Days of such resolution) execute a Joint
Instruction Letter to instruct the Escrow Agent to pay to the Seller Holders
all amounts then contained in the General Escrow Account by wire transfer of
immediately available funds to an account or accounts designated by Seller
pursuant to the Joint Instruction Letter

 



 

 **9.6** **_Limits of Liability_**.

 



 

(a) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary set forth herein, Buyer
Indemnified Parties shall not be entitled to recover on a claim for
indemnification under _Section 9.2(a)(i)_, or for any individual Buyer Loss

of related Buyer Losses that meet the requirements of the preceding clause (i)
in the aggregate (x) exceed the Indemnity Deductible and (y) do not exceed the
Seller Cap in the aggregate; _provided_ , _however_ , that the foregoing
limitation shall not apply to any claim for indemnification with respect to
any inaccuracy or breach (or deemed inaccuracy or breach) of the Seller
Fundamental Representations, the applicable Tax Representations or the Special
Warranty of Title. In no event shall Seller be liable for any Buyer Losses
(when taken together with all other Buyer Losses indemnifiable in accordance
with the terms of this _Section 9.6_) in excess of the Unadjusted Purchase
Price.

 



 

(b) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary set forth herein, Seller
Indemnified Parties shall not be entitled to recover on a claim for
indemnification under _Section 9.3(a)(i)_, or for any individual Seller Loss
or series of related Seller Losses (i) unless the amount of each such Seller
Loss or series of related Seller Losses exceeds one hundred thousand Dollars
($100,000) (ii) then only to the extent that all such Seller Losses or series
of related Seller Losses that meet the requirements of the preceding clause
(i) in the aggregate (x) exceed the Indemnity Deductible and (y) do not exceed
the Buyer Cap in the aggregate; _provided_ , _however_ , that the foregoing
limitation shall not apply to any claim for indemnification with respect to

be liable for any Seller Losses (when taken together with all other Seller
Losses indemnifiable in accordance with the terms of this _Section 9.6_) in
excess of the Unadjusted Purchase Price.

 



 

 **9.7** **_Sole and Exclusive Remedy_**.

 



 

(a) From and after the Closing, the remedies set forth in this _Article 9_
shall, in the absence of Fraud, provide the sole and exclusive remedies
arising out of, in connection with, relating to or arising under this
Agreement, any certificate (including the certificates delivered at Closing by
Buyer and Seller pursuant to _Section 2.6(b)(iii)_ and _Section 2.6(c)(i)_,
respectively) or instrument delivered pursuant hereto, including any and all
liabilities or obligations related to environmental matters or liabilities or
violations of Environmental Laws or releases of any Constituents of Concern,
whether based on contract, tort, strict liability, other laws or otherwise,
including any breach or alleged breach of any representation, warranty,
covenant or agreement made herein. The Parties acknowledge and agree that, in
the absence of Fraud, from and after the Closing the remedies available in
this _Article 9_ supersede (and each Party waives and releases) any other
remedies available at Law or in equity against the other Parties including
rights of rescission, rights of contribution and claims arising under
applicable statutes.

 



 

(b) Buyer, on behalf of itself and all other Buyer Indemnified Parties,
further acknowledges and agrees that, after the Closing, in the absence of
Fraud or as otherwise contemplated in _Section 9.6(a)_, the General Escrow
Balance then held in the General Escrow Account pursuant to the Escrow

claims by or on behalf of any Buyer Indemnified Party arising under this
_Article 9_.

 



 

 **9.8** **_Compliance with Express Negligence Rule_**. ALL RELEASES,
LIMITATIONS ON LIABILITY AND INDEMNITIES CONTAINED IN THIS AGREEMENT,

 **9.9** **_Insurance Proceeds_**. The Buyer Losses and Seller Losses giving
rise to any claim hereunder shall be reduced by any insurance proceeds or
other payments actually received by the Indemnified Party (less the amount of
any deductible paid or costs incurred by such Indemnified Party in connection
therewith) in satisfaction of any Losses giving rise to the claim. Buyer shall
use its commercially reasonable efforts to recover under insurance policies or
under other rights of recovery for Losses; _provided_ , _however_ , that Buyer
shall be entitled to seek payment (including indemnification) under this
Agreement pending resolution of any such recovery efforts.

 



 

 **9.10** **_Tax Treatment of Indemnity Payments_**. For U.S. federal Income
Tax purposes, the Parties agree to treat (and shall cause each of their

an adjustment to the Unadjusted Purchase Price unless a final and non-
appealable determination by an appropriate Governmental Authority (which shall
include the execution of an IRS Form 870-AD or successor form) provides
otherwise.

 



      
 

 



 

 **9.11** **_Damages Waiver_**. No Indemnifying Party shall have any liability
under this _Article 9_ to any Indemnified Party for indirect, consequential,

 **10.2** **_Assignment_**. Neither Party shall assign this Agreement or any
part hereof without the prior written consent of the other Party. Subject to
the foregoing, this Agreement shall be binding upon and inure to the benefit
of the Parties and their respective permitted successors and assigns.

 



 

 **10.3** **_Rights of Third Parties_**. Subject to _Sections 9.2_ , _9.3_ ,
_10.10_ and _10.12_ and, nothing expressed or implied in this Agreement is
intended or shall be construed to confer upon or give any Person, other than
the Parties, any right or remedies under or by reason of this Agreement.

 



 

 **10.4** **_Counterparts_**. This Agreement may be executed in two or more
counterparts, each of which shall be deemed an original, but all of which
together shall constitute one and the same instrument. Any facsimile
electronic transmittal (PDF) copies hereof or signature hereon shall, for all
purposes, be deemed originals.

 



 

 **10.5** **_Entire Agreement_**. This Agreement (together with the Disclosure
Schedules, the Transaction Documents and exhibits to this Agreement) and the
Confidentiality Agreement constitute the entire agreement among the Parties
and supersede any other agreements, whether written or oral, that may have
been made or entered into by or among any of the Parties or any of their
respective Affiliates relating to the transactions contemplated hereby. In the
event any provision of any other Transaction Document shall in any way
conflict with the provisions of this Agreement (except where a provision
therein expressly provides that it is intended to take precedence over this
Agreement), this Agreement shall control.

 



 

 **10.6** **_Disclosure Schedules_**. Unless the context otherwise requires,
all capitalized terms used in the Disclosure Schedules shall have the
respective meanings assigned in this Agreement. No reference to or disclosure
of any item or other matter in the Disclosure Schedules shall be construed as
an admission or indication that such item or other matter is material or that
such item

 



      
 

 



 

or other matter is required to be referred to or disclosed in the Disclosure
Schedules. No disclosure in the Disclosure Schedules relating to any possible
breach or violation of any agreement or Law shall be construed as an admission
or indication that any such breach or violation exists or has actually
occurred. The inclusion of any information in the Disclosure Schedules shall
not be deemed to be an admission or acknowledgment by Seller or Buyer, as
applicable, in and of itself, that such information is material to or outside
the Ordinary Course of any Person or required to be disclosed on the
Disclosure Schedules. Each disclosure in the Disclosure Schedules shall be
deemed to qualify the particular sections or subsections of the
representations and warranties expressly referenced, and each other section or
subsection of the representations and warranties where the relevance of such
disclosure is reasonably apparent.

 



 

 **10.7** **_Amendments_**. Subject to _Section 10.10_, this Agreement may be
amended or modified in whole or in part, and terms and conditions may be
waived, only by a duly authorized agreement in writing which makes reference
to this Agreement executed by each Party.

 



 

 **10.8** **_Severability_**. If any provision of this Agreement is held
invalid or unenforceable by any court of competent jurisdiction, the other
provisions of this Agreement shall remain in full force and effect. The
Parties further agree that if any provision contained herein is, to any
extent, held invalid or unenforceable in any respect under the Laws governing
this Agreement, they shall take any actions necessary to render the remaining
provisions of this Agreement valid and enforceable to the fullest extent
permitted by Law and, to the extent necessary, shall amend or otherwise modify
this Agreement to replace any provision contained herein that is held invalid
or unenforceable with a valid and enforceable provision giving effect to the
intent of the Parties to the greatest extent legally permissible.

 



 

 **10.9** **_Specific Performance_**. The Parties acknowledge and agree (a)
that each Party would be irreparably harmed by a breach by the other Party of
any of such other Partys obligations under this Agreement and that the
Parties would not have any adequate remedy at law if any of the provisions of
this Agreement were not performed in accordance with their specific terms or
were otherwise breached and (b) that the non-breaching Party shall be entitled
to injunctive relief, specific performance, and other equitable remedies
against the breaching Party to enforce the performance by the breaching Party
of its obligations under this Agreement (this being in addition to any other
remedy to which the non-breaching Party may be entitled at law or in equity),
and the Parties hereby consent and agree to such injunctive relief, specific
performance, and other equitable remedies. Accordingly, each Party waives (i)
any defenses in any action for specific performance pursuant to this Agreement
that a remedy at law would be adequate and (ii) any requirement under any Law
to post a bond or other security as a prerequisite to obtaining equitable
relief.

 



 

 **10.10** **_No Recourse to Financing Sources_**. NOTWITHSTANDING ANYTHING
HEREIN TO THE CONTRARY, SELLER AGREES THAT NEITHER IT, NOR ANY OF ITS FORMER,
CURRENT OR FUTURE OFFICERS, DIRECTORS, MANAGERS, EMPLOYEES, MEMBERS, PARTNERS,
AGENTS OR OTHER REPRESENTATIVES AND AFFILIATES (COLLECTIVELY, " _SELLER
RELATED PARTIES_ "), SHALL HAVE ANY CLAIM AGAINST ANY FINANCING SOURCE, ANY
LENDER OR EQUITY PURCHASER OR OTHER PROVIDER OF EQUITY CAPITAL, INCLUDING, IN
EACH CASE, APOLLO CAPITAL MANAGEMENT, L.P., PARTICIPATING IN THE FINANCING OR
ANY OF

 



      
 

 



 

THEIR RESPECTIVE FORMER, CURRENT OR FUTURE GENERAL OR LIMITED PARTNERS,
STOCKHOLDERS, MANAGERS, MEMBERS, AGENTS, REPRESENTATIVES, AFFILIATES,
SUCCESSORS OR ASSIGNS (COLLECTIVELY, " _FINANCE RELATED PARTIES_ "), NOR SHALL
ANY FINANCE RELATED PARTY HAVE ANY LIABILITY WHATSOEVER TO SELLER RELATED
PARTY, IN CONNECTION WITH THE FINANCING CONTEMPLATED BY _SECTION 6.14_ OR IN
ANY WAY RELATING TO THIS AGREEMENT OR ANY OF THE TRANSACTIONS CONTEMPLATED
HEREBY, WHETHER AT LAW, IN EQUITY, IN CONTRACT, IN TORT OR OTHERWISE, IN EACH
CASE, WHETHER ARISING, IN WHOLE OR IN PART, OUT OF COMPARATIVE, CONTRIBUTORY
OR SOLE NEGLIGENCE BY ANY FINANCE RELATED PARTY; PROVIDED, HOWEVER, THAT THIS
_SECTION 10.10_ SHALL NOT LIMIT ANY LIABILITY OF BUYER IN CONNECTION WITH
THIS AGREEMENT OR ANY OF THE TRANSACTIONS CONTEMPLATED HEREBY. Notwithstanding
anything to the contrary in this Agreement, each Financing Source and Finance
Related Party shall be an express third party beneficiary of, and shall have
the right to enforce, this _Section 10.10_. Each of the Parties hereto agrees
that, _Section 10.11_ notwithstanding, this provision shall be interpreted,
and any action relating to this provision, shall be governed by the laws of
the State of New York. This _Section 10.10_ is intended to benefit and may be
enforced by any Financing Source and the Finance Related Parties. In no event
will Seller or any of its Affiliates have any liability of any kind or nature
to any Financing Source or any Finance Related Party arising or resulting from
any cooperation or assistance provided pursuant to _Section 6.14_.
Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement, this _Section
10.10_ may not be amended or modified in a manner that adversely impacts in
any respect any Financing Source or Finance Related Party without the prior
written consent of the applicable Financing Source.

 



 

 **10.11** **_Governing Law; Jurisdiction_**.

 



 

(a) _Law_. This Agreement (other than _Section 10.10_) shall be governed and
construed in accordance with the Laws of the State of Delaware, without regard
to the Laws that might be applicable under conflicts of laws principles that
would require the application of the Laws of another jurisdiction.

 



 

(b) _Forum_. The Parties agree that the appropriate, exclusive and convenient
forum for any disputes between any of the Parties hereto arising out of this
Agreement or the transactions contemplated hereby shall be in any state or
federal court in Harris County, Texas, and each of the Parties hereto
irrevocably submits to the jurisdiction of such courts in respect of any legal
proceeding arising out of or related to this Agreement. The Parties further
agree that the Parties shall not bring suit with respect to any disputes
arising out of this Agreement or the transactions contemplated hereby in any
court or jurisdiction other than the above-specified courts. The Parties
further agree, to the extent permitted by Law, that a final and non-appealable
judgment against a Party in any action or proceeding contemplated above shall
be conclusive and may be enforced in any other jurisdiction within or outside
the United States by suit on the judgment, a certified or exemplified copy of
which shall be conclusive evidence of the fact and amount of such judgment.

 



 

(c) _Jurisdiction_. To the extent that any Party hereto has or hereafter may
acquire any immunity from jurisdiction of any court or from any legal process
(whether through service

 



      
 

 



 

or notice, attachment prior to judgment, attachment in aid of execution,
execution or otherwise) with respect to itself or its property, each such
Party hereby irrevocably (i) waives such immunity in respect of its
obligations with respect to this Agreement, and (ii) submits to the personal
jurisdiction of any court described in _Section 10.11(b)_.

 



 

(d) _JURY WAIVER_. EACH OF THE PARTIES HERETO HEREBY IRREVOCABLY WAIVES ANY
AND ALL RIGHT TO TRIAL BY JURY IN ANY ACTION, LEGAL PROCEEDING OR CLAIM
(WHETHER BASED ON CONTRACT, TORT OR OTHERWISE) ARISING OUT OF OR IN ANY WAY
RELATING TO THIS AGREEMENT.

 



 

 **10.12** **_No Recourse_**. This Agreement may only be enforced against, and
any claims or causes of action that may be based upon, arise out of or relate
to this Agreement, or the negotiation, execution or performance of this
Agreement may only be made against the entities that are expressly identified
as Parties hereto in their capacities as such and, except to the extent
otherwise provided herein, no former, current or future equity holders,
controlling Persons, directors, officers, employees, agents or Affiliates of
any Party hereto or any former, current or future, direct or indirect, equity
holder, controlling Person, director, officer, employee, general or limited
partner, member, manager, agent or Affiliate of any of the foregoing (each, a
" _Non-Recourse Party_ ") shall have any liability for any obligations or
liabilities of the Parties to this Agreement or for any claim (whether in
tort, contract or otherwise) based on, in respect of, or by reason of, the
transactions contemplated hereby or in respect of any representations made or
alleged to be made in connection herewith. Without limiting the rights of any
Party against the other Parties hereto, in no event shall any Party or any of
its Affiliates seek to enforce this Agreement against, make any claims for
breach of this Agreement against, or seek to recover monetary damages from,
any Non-Recourse Party.

 



 

 **10.13** **_No Joint Obligations_**. It is acknowledged that Buyer is
entering into a securities purchase agreement with Haymaker Resources, LP (the
" _HR Purchase Agreement_ ") substantially concurrently with the execution of
this Agreement. In addition to, and without any limitation of, the provisions
of _Section 10.12_, it is expressly acknowledged and agreed that:

 



 

(a) none of Seller or any of its Non-Recourse Parties shall have any liability
for any obligations or liabilities arising under the HR Purchase Agreement,
and in no event shall any Buyer Indemnified Party seek to enforce the HR
Purchase Agreement against, make any claims for breach of the HR Purchase
Agreement against, or seek to recover monetary damages from, Seller or any of
its Non-Recourse Parties under the HR Purchase Agreement;

 



 

(b) none of "Seller" (as defined in the HR Purchase Agreement) or any of its
"Non-Recourse Parties" (as defined in the HR Purchase Agreement) shall have
any liability for any obligations or liabilities arising under this Agreement,
and in no event shall any Buyer Indemnified Party seek to enforce this
Agreement against, make any claims for breach of this Agreement against, or
seek to recover monetary damages from, such Persons under this Agreement;

 



 

(c) the obligations and liabilities of Seller under this Agreement are
several, and are not, and shall not be claimed by any Buyer Indemnified Party
to be, joint and several with "Seller" (as defined in the HR Purchase
Agreement); and

 



      
 

 



 

(d) the obligations and liabilities of "Seller" (as defined in the HR Purchase
Agreement) under the HR Purchase Agreement are several, and are not, and shall
not be claimed by any Buyer Indemnified Party to be, joint and several with
Seller.

 



 

 **10.14** **_Legal Representation_**. Following the Closing, DLA Piper LLP
(US) (" _DLA LLP_ ") may serve as counsel to Seller and its Non-Recourse
Parties, in connection with any litigation, claim or obligation arising out of
or relating to this Agreement, notwithstanding such representation or any
continued representation of any other Person, and each of the Parties (on
behalf of itself and each of its Non-Recourse Parties) consents thereto and
waives any conflict of interest arising therefrom. The decision to represent
Seller and its Non-Recourse Parties shall be solely that of DLA LLP. Any
privilege attaching as a result of DLA LLP representing Seller or any of its
Affiliates (including the Acquired Companies) in connection with this
Agreement shall survive the Closing and shall remain in effect; _provided_ ,
that such privilege from and after the Closing shall be assigned to and
controlled by Seller; _provided_ , _further_ , that in the event that any
dispute arises after the Closing between Buyer or the Acquired Companies, on
the one hand, and any party other than the Parties or any of their respective
Non-Recourse Parties, on the other hand, then Buyer and the Acquired Companies
may assert such privilege to prevent the disclosure of any Privileged
Communications by DLA LLP to such third party. In furtherance of the
foregoing, each of the Parties agrees to take the steps necessary to ensure
that any privilege attaching as a result of DLA LLP representing the Acquired
Companies in connection with this Agreement shall survive the Closing, remain
in effect and be assigned to and controlled by Seller. As to any privileged
attorney client communications between DLA LLP and the Acquired Companies
prior to the Closing Date (collectively, the " _Privileged Communications_ "),
Buyer, together with any of its Affiliates (including after Closing, the
Acquired Companies), successors or assigns, agree that no such party may use
or rely on any of the Privileged Communications in any action or claim against
or involving any of the Parties or any of their respective Non-Recourse
Parties after the Closing. Notwithstanding the foregoing, nothing herein shall
be construed as a waiver by the Acquired Companies of the attorney-client
privilege of the obligations of confidentiality owed by DLA LLP to the
Acquired Companies with respect to matters not regarding this Agreement.

and between Haymaker Minerals and Royalties, LLC, a Delaware limited liability
company (" _Assignor_ "), and Kimbell Royalty Partners, LP, a Delaware limited
partnership (" _Assignee_ "). Assignor and Assignee are sometimes referred to
herein as a " _Party_ " or the " _Parties_." Capitalized terms used but not
defined herein shall have the meaning assigned to such term in the Purchase
Agreement (as defined below).

 



 

 **W I T N E S S E T H:**

 



 

WHEREAS, Assignor owns all of the issued and outstanding membership interests
(the " _Acquired Interests_ ") of Haymaker Holding Company, LLC, a Delaware
limited liability company (" _Haymaker Holding_ "), and Haymaker Greenfield,
LLC, a Delaware limited liability company (" _Haymaker Greenfield_ " and,
together with Haymaker Holding, the " _Acquired Companies_ ");

 



 

WHEREAS, pursuant to the Securities Purchase Agreement, dated as of May 28,
2018 (the " _Purchase Agreement_ "), among Assignor, Haymaker Services, LLC
(solely for purposes of Section 6.20 of the Purchase Agreement) and Assignee,
Assignor desires to sell to Assignee, and Assignee desires to acquire from
Assignor, all of the Acquired Interests, on and subject to the terms and
conditions contained in the Purchase Agreement; and

 



 

WHEREAS, Assignor desires to effect the sale, transfer, assignment, conveyance
and delivery of all of the Acquired Interests to Assignee as set forth above.

 



 

NOW, THEREFORE, in consideration of the promises, agreements and covenants
contained in the Purchase Agreement, and other good and valuable
consideration, the receipt and sufficiency of which are hereby and thereby
acknowledged, the Parties agree as follows:

 



 

1. _Assignment_. Assignor irrevocably and forever SELLS, TRANSFERS, ASSIGNS, CONVEYS AND DELIVERS to Assignee, its successors and assigns, and Assignee PURCHASES, ASSUMES AND ACCEPTS, Assignors entire right, title and interest in and to the Acquired Interests, free and clear of all Liens (other than generally applicable restrictions on transfer arising under state and federal securities Laws).

 



 

2. _Substitution as Member_. From and after the Closing, Assignee shall be substituted for Assignor as a member of the Acquired Companies with respect to the Acquired Interests and Assignor does withdraw from the Acquired Companies as a member, cease to be a member of the Acquired Companies and cease to have or exercise any right or power as a member of the Acquired Companies or in any regard with respect to the Acquired Interests. The Parties agree that the assignment of the Acquired Interests, the admission of Assignee as a member, and the cessation of Assignor as a member of the Acquired Companies shall not dissolve the Acquired Companies, and the business of the Acquired Companies shall continue.

      
 

 



 

3. _General Provisions_.

 



 

(a) _Further Assurances_. Assignor shall promptly execute and deliver to
Assignee any additional instrument or other document which Assignee reasonably
requests to evidence or better effect the assignment contained herein.

 



 

(b) _Governing Law; Jurisdiction_. The provisions of Section 10.11 to the
Purchase Agreement (Governing Law; Jurisdiction) are hereby incorporated into
this Assignment by reference, _mutatis mutandis_.

 



 

(c) _Counterparts_. This Assignment may be executed in two or more
counterparts, each of which shall be deemed an original, but all of which
together shall constitute one and the same instrument. A signed copy of this
Assignment delivered by facsimile, e-mail or other means of electronic
transmission shall be deemed to have the same legal effect as delivery of an
original signed copy of this Assignment.

 



 

(d) _Assignment_. Neither Party shall assign this Assignment or any part
hereof without the prior written consent of the other Party. Subject to the
foregoing, this Assignment shall be binding upon and inure to the benefit of
the Parties and their respective permitted successors and assigns.

 



 

(e) _Conflict_. This Assignment is made pursuant to, and is subject to the
terms of, the Purchase Agreement. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary
contained in this Assignment, nothing contained herein is intended to or shall
be deemed to limit, restrict, modify, alter, amend or otherwise change in any
manner the rights and obligations of the parties to the Purchase Agreement
under the Purchase Agreement, and in the event of any conflict between the
terms and provisions hereof and the terms and the provisions of the Purchase
Agreement, the terms and provisions of the Purchase Agreement shall control.

 



 

(f) _Amendment or Supplement_. This Assignment may be amended or modified in
whole or in part, and terms and conditions may be waived, only by a duly
authorized agreement in writing which makes reference to this Assignment
executed by each Party to this Assignment.

 



 

(g) _Severability_. If any term or provision of this Assignment is invalid,
illegal or unenforceable in any jurisdiction, such invalidity, illegality or
unenforceability shall not affect any other term or provision of this
Assignment or invalidate or render unenforceable such term or provision in any
other jurisdiction. Upon such determination that any term or other provision
is invalid, illegal or unenforceable, the Parties hereto shall negotiate in
good faith to modify this Assignment so as to effect the original intent of
the Parties as closely as possible in a mutually acceptable manner in order
that the transactions contemplated hereby be consummated as originally
contemplated to the greatest extent possible.

 **ARTICLE II**

 



 

 **REGISTRATION RIGHTS**

 



 

 **2.1** **_Shelf Registration_** **.**

 



 

(a) The Partnership will prepare, file (to the extent not previously filed)
and use its reasonable best efforts to cause to become effective no later than
the 160th day following the date of this Agreement (the " _Effective Date_ "),
a Shelf Registration Statement (which Shelf Registration Statement shall be an
Automatic Shelf Registration

 



      
 

 



 

Statement if the Partnership is then eligible to file an Automatic Shelf
Registration Statement), registering for resale the Registrable Securities
under the Securities Act. The plan of distribution indicated in the Shelf
Registration Statement will include all such methods of sale as any Holder may
reasonably request in writing at least five Business Days prior to the filing
of the Shelf Registration Statement and that can be included in the Shelf
Registration Statement under the rules and regulations of the SEC. Until all
Registrable Securities cease to be Registrable Securities, the Partnership
shall use its reasonable best efforts to keep current and effective such Shelf
Registration Statement and file such supplements or amendments to such Shelf
Registration Statement (or file a new Shelf Registration Statement (which
Shelf Registration Statement shall be an Automatic Shelf Registration
Statement if the Partnership is then eligible to file an Automatic Shelf
Registration Statement) when such preceding Shelf Registration Statement
expires pursuant to the rules of the SEC) as may be necessary or appropriate
in order to keep such Shelf Registration Statement continuously effective and
useable for the resale of all Registrable Securities under the Securities Act.
Any Shelf Registration Statement when declared effective (including the
documents incorporated therein by reference) will comply in all material
respects as to form with all applicable requirements of the Securities Act and
the Exchange Act and will not contain an untrue statement of a material fact
or omit to state a material fact required to be stated therein or necessary to
make the statements therein not misleading.

 



 

(b) If a Shelf Registration Statement required by _Section 2.1(a)_ is not
declared effective prior to the 180th day following the date of this
Agreement, with respect to each Holder other than Apollo (the " _First Target
Effective Date_ ") (or, with respect to Apollo, the Target Apollo Effective
Date), then each applicable Holder shall be entitled to a payment (with
respect to the Registrable Securities held by such applicable Holder), as
liquidated damages and not as a penalty, of 0.25% of the Liquidated Damages
Multiplier per 30-day period, that shall accrue daily, for the first 60 days
following the First Target Effective Date or Target Apollo Effective Date, as
applicable, increasing by an additional 0.25% of the Liquidated Damages
Multiplier per 30-day period, that shall accrue daily, for each subsequent 60
days (i.e., 0.5% for 61-120 days, 0.75% for 121-180 days and 1.0% thereafter),
up to a maximum of 1.00% of the Liquidated Damages Multiplier per 30-day
period (the " _Liquidated Damages_ "). The Liquidated Damages payable pursuant
to the immediately preceding sentence shall be payable within 10 Business Days
after the end of each such 30-day period. Any Liquidated Damages shall be paid
to each such applicable Holder in immediately available funds. The accrual of
Liquidated Damages shall cease (a " _LD Termination Date_ " and, each such
period beginning on the First Target Effective Date or Target Apollo Effective
Date, as applicable, and ending on a LD Termination Date being, a " _LD
Period_ ") at the earlier of (i) such Shelf Registration Statement becoming
effective and (ii) when such Holder no longer holds Registrable Securities.
Any amount of Liquidated Damages shall be prorated for any period of less than
30 calendar days accruing during a LD Period. If the Partnership is unable to
cause a Shelf Registration Statement to go effective by the First Target
Effective Date or Target Apollo Effective Date, as applicable, as a result of
an acquisition, merger, reorganization, disposition or other similar
transaction, then the Partnership may request a waiver of the Liquidated
Damages, and the applicable Holders may grant or withhold their consent to

 



      
 

 



 

such request in their discretion. For the avoidance of doubt, nothing in this
_Section 2.1(b)_ shall relieve the Partnership from its obligations under
_Section 2.1(a)_.

 



 

(c) Any one or more Holders of Registrable Securities may request to sell all
or any portion of their Registrable Securities in an underwritten offering
that is registered pursuant to the Shelf Registration Statement (each, an "
_Underwritten Shelf Takedown_ "); _provided_ , _however_ , that in the case
of each such Underwritten Shelf Takedown, such Holder or Holders will be
entitled to make such demand only if the gross proceeds from the sale of
Registrable Securities in the Underwritten Shelf Takedown (before the
deduction of underwriting expenses and discounts) is reasonably expected to
exceed, in the aggregate, $50 million. At the request of such Holders, the
plan of distribution for an Underwritten Shelf Takedown may include a
customary "road show" (including an "electronic road show") or other
substantial marketing effort by the Partnership and the underwriters . Subject
to the other limitations contained in this Agreement, the Partnership will not
be obligated hereunder to effect an Underwritten Shelf Takedown within 90 days
after the closing of an Underwritten Shelf Takedown and the Holders shall be
entitled to have no more than three Underwritten Shelf Takedowns per calendar
year.

 



 

(d) All requests (a " _Demand Request_ ") for Underwritten Shelf Takedowns
shall be made by the Holder or Holders making such request (the " _Requesting
Holder_ ") by giving written notice to the Partnership. Each Demand Request
shall specify the approximate number of Registrable Securities to be sold in
the Underwritten Shelf Takedown and the expected price range of securities to
be sold in such Underwritten Shelf Takedown. Within five Business Days after
receipt of any Demand Request, the Partnership shall send written notice of
such requested Underwritten Shelf Takedown to all other Holders of Registrable
Securities (the " _Partnership Notice_ ") and shall include in such
Underwritten Shelf Takedown all Registrable Securities with respect to which
the Partnership has received written requests for inclusion therein within
five Business Days after sending the Partnership Notice. Any Holder shall have
the right to withdraw such Holders request for inclusion of such Holders
Registrable Securities in the Underwritten Shelf Takedown pursuant to this
_Section 2.1(d)_ by giving written notice to the Partnership of such
withdrawal until the earlier of (i) the issuance of a press release by the
Partnership with respect to such Underwritten Shelf Takedown or (ii) the
filing of any prospectus or prospectus supplement relating to such
Underwritten Shelf Takedown.

 



 

(e) The Participating Majority shall select one or more nationally prominent
firms of investment bankers reasonably acceptable to the Partnership to act as
the managing underwriter or underwriters in connection with such Underwritten
Shelf Takedown. The " _Participating Majority_ " shall mean, with respect to
any particular Underwritten Shelf Takedown, the Holder(s) of a majority of the
Registrable Securities requested to be included in such Underwritten Shelf
Takedown. All Holders proposing to distribute their securities through such
underwriting shall enter into an underwriting agreement with such underwriter
or underwriters in accordance with _Section 2.1(h)_. The Partnership will
use its reasonable best efforts to cause members of senior management to
cooperate with the underwriter(s) in connection with the Underwritten Shelf
Takedown and make themselves reasonably available to participate in the
marketing process in

 



      
 

 



 

connection with the Underwritten Shelf Takedown as required by the managing
underwriter(s) and providing such additional information reasonably requested
by the managing underwriter(s) (in addition to the minimum information
required by law, rule or regulation) in any prospectus relating to the
Underwritten Shelf Takedown.

 



 

(f) If the managing underwriter(s) for such Underwritten Shelf Takedown advise
the Partnership and the participating Holders that the inclusion of the amount
of securities (including Registrable Securities) requested to be included in
the Registration Statement will materially and adversely affect the pricing of
the offering (a " _Material Adverse Effect_ "), then the Partnership shall so
advise all Holders of Registrable Securities and the Existing Holders which
would otherwise be underwritten pursuant hereto, and the amount of securities
that may be included in the underwriting shall be allocated among the
participating Holders and participating Existing Holders, (i) _first_ , among
the participating Holders as nearly as possible on a pro rata basis based on
the total amount of Registrable Securities requested by such Holders to be
included in such underwriting and (ii) _second_ , to the extent all
Registrable Securities requested to be included in such underwriting by the
participating Holders have been included, to any participating Existing
Holders and other Persons pursuant to contractual registration rights as
nearly as possible on a pro rata basis based on the total amount of
Registrable Securities (as defined in the Existing Registration Rights
Agreement and other contractual registration rights) requested by such
Existing Holders and other Persons to be included in such underwriting. The
Partnership shall prepare preliminary and final prospectus supplements for use
in connection with the Underwritten Shelf Takedown, containing such additional
information as may be reasonably requested by the underwriter(s).

 



 

(g) Upon written notice to the Holders of Registrable Securities, the
Partnership shall be entitled to suspend, for a period of time not to exceed
the periods specified in _Section 2.4(s)_ (each, a " _Suspension Period_ "),
the use of any Registration Statement or Prospectus and shall not be required
to amend or supplement the Registration Statement, any related Prospectus or
any document incorporated therein by reference if (i) the Partnership receives
any request by the SEC or any other federal or state governmental authority
for amendments or supplements to such Registration Statement or Prospectus or
for additional information that pertains to such Holders as sellers of
Registrable Securities; (ii) the SEC issues any stop order suspending the
effectiveness of the Registration Statement covering any or all of the
Registrable Securities or the initiation of any proceedings for that purpose;
(iii) the Partnership receives any notification with respect to the suspension
of the qualification or exemption from qualification of any of the Registrable
Securities for sale in any jurisdiction, or the initiation or threatening of
any proceeding for such purpose; and (iv) the board of directors, chief
executive officer or chief financial officer of the General Partner determines
in its or his or her reasonable good faith judgment that the Registration
Statement or any Prospectus may contain an untrue statement of a material fact
or may omit any fact necessary to make the statements in the Registration
Statement or Prospectus not misleading; _provided_ , that the Partnership
shall use its good faith efforts to amend the Registration Statement or
Prospectus to correct such untrue statement or omission as promptly as
reasonably practicable, unless the Partnership determines in

 



      
 

 



 

good faith that such amendment would reasonably be expected to have a
materially detrimental effect on the Partnership.

 



 

(h) If requested by the managing underwriter(s) for an Underwritten Shelf
Takedown, the Partnership shall enter into an underwriting agreement with the
underwriters for such offering, such agreement to be in form and substance
(including with respect to representations and warranties by the Partnership)
as is customarily given by the Partnership to underwriters in an underwritten
public offering, and to contain indemnities generally to the effect and to the
extent provided in _Section 2.7_. No Holders of Registrable Securities may
participate in the Underwritten Shelf Takedown unless such Holder (i) agrees
to sell such Holders Registrable Securities on the basis provided in any
underwriting arrangements approved by the Partnership and (ii) completes and
executes all questionnaires, powers of attorney, indemnities, underwriting
agreements and other documents, each in customary form, reasonably required
under the terms of such underwriting arrangements; provided, however, that no
such Holder shall be required to (A) make any representations or warranties in
connection with any such registration other than representations and
warranties as to (1) such Holders ownership of his or its Registrable
Securities to be sold or transferred free and clear of all liens, claims and
encumbrances, (2) such Holders power and authority to effect such transfer
and (3) such matters pertaining to compliance with securities laws as may be
reasonably requested or (B) undertake any indemnification obligations to the
Partnership or the underwriters with respect thereto except as otherwise
provided in _Section 2.7_.

 



 

(i) Each of the Holders hereby agrees (a) to cooperate with the Partnership
and to furnish to the Partnership all such information regarding such Holder,
its ownership of Registrable Securities and the disposition of such securities
in connection with the preparation of the Registration Statement and any
filings with any state securities commission as the Partnership may reasonably
request, (b) to the extent required by the Securities Act, to deliver or cause
delivery of the Prospectus contained in the Registration Statement, any
amendment or supplement thereto, to any purchaser of Registrable Securities
covered by the Registration Statement from the Holder and (c) if requested by
the Partnership, to notify the Partnership of any sale of Registrable
Securities by such Holder.

 



 

 **2.2** **_Piggyback Registrations_** **.**

 



 

(a) Each time the Partnership proposes to register any of its equity
securities (other than pursuant to an Excluded Registration) under the
Securities Act for sale to the public (whether for the account of the
Partnership or the account of any Existing Holder) and the form of
registration statement to be used (including a Shelf Registration Statement)
permits the registration of Registrable Securities, the Partnership shall give
prompt written notice (a " _Piggyback Registration Notice_ ") to each Holder
of Registrable Securities (which notice shall be given not less than (i) five
Business Days prior to the anticipated filing date or (ii) three Business Days
in the case of an Overnight Underwritten Offering, Same-Day Offering or
similar "bought deal"), which notice shall offer each such Holder the
opportunity to include any or all of its or his Registrable Securities in such
registration statement, subject to the limitations contained

 



       
 

 



 

in _Section 2.2(b)_ hereof. Each Holder who desires to have its or his
Registrable Securities included in such registration statement shall so advise
the Partnership in writing (stating the number of Registrable Securities
desired to be registered) within three Business Days (or one Business Day in
the case of an Overnight Underwritten Offering, Same-Day Offering or similar
"bought deal") after the date of such notice from the Partnership. Any Holder
shall have the right to withdraw such Holders request for inclusion of such
Holders Registrable Securities in any registration statement pursuant to this
_Section 2.2(a)_ by giving written notice to the Partnership of such
withdrawal. Subject to _Section 2.2(b)_ below, the Partnership shall include
in such registration statement all such Registrable Securities so requested to
be included therein; _provided_ , _however_ , that the Partnership may at
any time withdraw or cease proceeding with any such registration if it shall
at the same time withdraw or cease proceeding with the registration of all
other equity securities originally proposed to be registered. For the
avoidance of doubt, any registration or offering pursuant to this _Section
2.2_ shall not be considered an Underwritten Shelf Takedown for purposes of
_Section 2.1_ of this Agreement.

 



 

(b) With respect to any registration pursuant to _Section 2.2(a)_, if the
managing underwriter(s) advise the Partnership that the inclusion of the
amount of securities (including Registrable Securities) requested to be
included in the Registration Statement will have a Material Adverse Effect,
the Partnership shall so advise all Holders of Registrable Securities and the
Existing Holders which would otherwise be underwritten pursuant hereto, and
the amount of securities that may be included in the Registration Statement
shall be allocated: (i) in the case of a registration for the account of the
Partnership, (a) _first_ , to include the securities the Partnership proposes
to register, (b) _second_ , among the participating Holders and participating
Existing Holders as nearly as possible on a pro rata basis based on the total
amount of Registrable Securities requested by such Holders and Registrable
Securities (as defined in the Existing Registration Rights Agreement)
requested by such Existing Holders to be included in such underwriting and (c)
_third_ , among any other Persons pursuant to contractual registration rights
on as nearly as possible on a pro rata basis, and (ii) in the case of a
registration for the account of the Existing Holders or any other Persons
pursuant to contractual registration rights, (a) _first_ , among the
participating Existing Holders as nearly as possible on a pro rata basis based
on the total amount of Registrable Securities (as defined in the Existing
Registration Rights Agreement) requested by such Existing Holders to be
included in such underwriting, (b) _second_ , among the participating Holders
as nearly as possible on a pro rata basis based on the total amount of
Registrable Securities requested by such Holders to be included in such
underwriting (c) _third_ , to include the securities the Partnership proposes
to register, if at all, and (d) _fourth_ , among any such other Persons
pursuant to contractual registration rights as nearly as possible on a pro
rata basis. If, as a result of the provisions of this _Section 2.2(b)_, any
Holder shall not be entitled to include all Registrable Securities in a
registration that such Holder has requested to be so included, such Holder may
withdraw such Holders request to include Registrable Securities in such
Registration Statement. No Person may participate in any Registration
Statement pursuant to _Section 2.2(a)_ unless such Person (i) agrees to sell
such persons Registrable Securities on the basis provided in any underwriting
arrangements approved by the Partnership and (ii) completes and executes all
questionnaires, powers of attorney, indemnities, underwriting agreements and
other documents, each in customary form,

 



      
 

 



 

reasonably required under the terms of such underwriting arrangements;
_provided_ , _however_ , that no such Person shall be required to (A) make
any representations or warranties in connection with any such registration
other than representations and warranties as to (1) such Persons ownership of
his or its Registrable Securities to be sold or transferred free and clear of
all liens, claims and encumbrances, (2) such Persons power and authority to
effect such transfer and (3) such matters pertaining to compliance with
securities laws as may be reasonably requested or (B) undertake any
indemnification obligations to the Partnership or the underwriters with
respect thereto except as otherwise provided in _Section 2.7_.

 



 

(c) Any Holder of Registrable Securities may deliver written notice (an "
_Opt-Out Notice_ ") to the Partnership requesting that such Holder of
Registrable Securities not receive from the Partnership any Piggyback
Registration Notice; provided, however, that such Holder of Registrable
Securities may later revoke any such Opt-Out Notice in writing. Following
receipt of an Opt-Out Notice from a holder of Registrable Securities (unless
subsequently revoked), the Partnership shall not deliver any notice to such
Holder of Registrable Securities pursuant to _Section 2.2(a)_ and such Holder
of Registrable Securities shall no longer be entitled to participate in any
registration or offering pursuant to _Section 2.2(a)_.

 



 

 **2.3** **_Holdback Agreement_** **.** Upon the request of the Partnership,
by electing to include Registrable Securities in a Partnership registration
statement pursuant to _Section 2.1_ or _Section 2.2_, the Holder shall agree
not to effect any sale or distribution of securities of the Partnership of the
same or similar class or classes of the securities included in the Partnership
registration statement or any securities convertible into or exchangeable or
exercisable for such securities, including a sale pursuant to Rule 144, during
such periods as reasonably requested (but in no event for a period longer than
45 days following the date of the applicable Prospectus; _provided_ each of
the executive officers and directors of the Partnership that hold Common Units
of the Partnership or securities convertible into or exchangeable or
exercisable for Common Units of the Partnership are subject to the same
restriction for the entire time period required of the Holders hereunder) by
the representatives of the underwriters, if an underwritten offering by the
Partnership (a " _Partnership Underwritten Offering_ "); provided further, for
the avoidance of doubt, that such restrictions shall only apply if the Holders
are able to sell Registrable Securities in such a Partnership Underwritten
Offering. ** ** The provisions of this _Section 2.3_ will no longer apply to
a Holder once such Holder ceases to hold at least 1% of the Registrable
Securities acquired as a result of the transactions contemplated in the
Purchase Agreements. The provisions of this _Section 2.3_ shall not apply to
(i) any transfer of Registrable Securities by a Holder to (a) any stockholder,
member, managing member, general or limited partner of any Holder, or (b) any
investment fund managed by any of such persons or (c) any other Affiliate of
any Holder, or to any other Affiliate of a Holder, so long as such transfer is
not for value and any such person agrees to and remains to be bound hereby,
(ii) the entry by any Holder of a bona fide pledge of any Registrable
Securities (and any foreclosure on any such pledge) and (iii) any hedging
transaction with respect to an index or basket of securities where the equity
securities of the Partnership constitute a de minimis amount.

 



 

 **2.4** **_Registration Procedures_** **.** In connection with the
registration and sale of Registrable Securities pursuant to this Agreement,
the Partnership will use its reasonable best

 



      
 

 



 

efforts to effect the registration and the sale of such Registrable Securities
in accordance with the intended method of disposition thereof, and pursuant
thereto the Partnership will:

 



 

(a) if the Registration Statement is not automatically effective upon filing,
use reasonable best efforts to cause such Registration Statement to become

selling Holder of any request by the SEC that the Partnership amend or

be reasonably necessary to keep the Registration Statement effective during

respect to the disposition of all Registrable Securities covered by the
Registration Statement for the period required to effect the distribution of
the Registrable Securities as set forth in _Section 2 _hereof;

 



 

(e) furnish to the selling Holders such numbers of copies of such Registration

to facilitate the disposition of the Registrable Securities;

 



 

(f) use its reasonable best efforts to register and qualify the Registrable
Securities under such other securities or blue-sky laws of such jurisdictions
as shall be reasonably requested by the Holders and any underwriter(s) and do
any and all other acts and things that may be reasonably necessary or
advisable to enable the Holders and any underwriter(s) to consummate the
disposition of the Registrable Securities in such jurisdictions; _provided_ ,
_however_ , that the Partnership shall not be required in connection therewith
or as a condition thereto to qualify to do business in or to file a general
consent to service of process in any jurisdiction, unless the Partnership is
already subject to service in such jurisdiction and except as may be required
by the Securities Act, or subject itself to taxation in any such jurisdiction,
unless the Partnership is already subject to taxation in such jurisdiction;

 



 

(g) use its reasonable best efforts to cause all such Registrable Securities
to be listed on a national securities exchange or trading system and each
securities exchange and trading system (if any) on which similar equity
securities issued by the Partnership are then listed;

 



      
 

 



 

(h) provide a transfer agent and registrar for the Registrable Securities and
provide a CUSIP number for all such Registrable Securities, in each case not

such registration, in form and substance as is customarily given to
underwriters by the Partnership in an underwritten public offering, addressed
to the underwriters, (ii) a letter dated as of such date, from the independent
public accountants of the Partnership, in form and substance as is customarily

Partnership, in form and substance as is customarily given by independent
petroleum engineers to underwriters in an underwritten public offering,
addressed to the underwriters;

 



 

(j) if requested by the Holders, cooperate with the Holders and the managing
underwriter(s) (if any) to facilitate the timely preparation and delivery of
certificates (which shall not bear any restrictive legends unless required
under applicable law) representing securities sold under the Registration
Statement, and enable such securities to be in such denominations and
registered in such names as such Holders or the managing underwriter (if any)
may request and keep available and make available to the Partnerships
transfer agent prior to the effectiveness of such Registration Statement a
supply of such certificates;

 



 

(k) in the event of any underwritten public offering, enter into and perform
its obligations under an underwriting agreement, in form and substance as is
customarily given by the Partnership to underwriters in an underwritten public
offering, with the underwriter(s) of such offering;

 



 

(l) upon execution of confidentiality agreements in form and substance
reasonably satisfactory to the Partnership, promptly make available for
inspection by the selling Holders, any underwriter(s) participating in any
disposition pursuant to such Registration Statement, and any attorney or
accountant or other agent retained by any such underwriter or selected by the
selling Holders, all financial and other records, pertinent corporate
documents, and properties of the Partnership reasonably requested
(collectively, " _Records_ "), and use reasonable best efforts to cause the
Partnerships officers, directors, employees, and independent accountants to
supply all information reasonably requested by any such seller, underwriter,
attorney, accountant, or agent, in each case, as necessary or advisable to
verify the accuracy of the information in such Registration Statement and to
conduct appropriate due diligence in connection therewith; _provided_ , that
Records that the Partnership determines, in good faith, to be confidential and
that it notifies the selling Holders are confidential shall not be disclosed
by the selling Holders unless the release of such Records is ordered pursuant
to a subpoena or other order from a court of competent jurisdiction or is
otherwise required by applicable law. Each Holder agrees that information
obtained by it as a result of such

 



      
 

 



 

inspections shall be deemed confidential and shall not be used by it or its
affiliates (other than with respect to such Holders due diligence) unless and
until such information is made generally available to the public, and further
agrees that, upon learning that disclosure of such Records is sought in a
court of competent jurisdiction, to the extent permitted and to the extent
practicable it shall give notice to the Partnership and allow the Partnership
to undertake appropriate action to prevent disclosure of the Records deemed
confidential;

 



 

(m) promptly notify the selling Holders and any underwriter(s) of the
notification to the Partnership by the SEC of its initiation of any proceeding
with respect to the issuance by the SEC of any stop order suspending the
effectiveness of the Registration Statement, and in the event of the issuance
of any stop order suspending the effectiveness of such Registration Statement,
or of any order suspending or preventing the use of any related Prospectus or
suspending the qualification of any Registrable Securities included in such
Registration Statement for sale in any jurisdiction, use its reasonable best
efforts to obtain promptly the withdrawal of such order;

 



 

(n) promptly notify the selling Holders and any underwriter(s) at any time
when a Prospectus relating thereto is required to be delivered under the
Securities Act of the occurrence of any event as a result of which the
Prospectus included in the Registration Statement, as then in effect, includes
an untrue statement of a material fact or omits to state any material fact
required to be stated therein or necessary to make the statements therein not
misleading in light of the circumstances under which they were made, and at
the request of any Holder promptly prepare and furnish to such Holder a
reasonable number of copies of a supplement to or an amendment of such
Prospectus, or a revised Prospectus, as may be necessary so that, as
thereafter delivered to the purchasers of such securities, such Prospectus
shall not include an untrue statement of a material fact or omit to state a
material fact required to be stated therein or necessary to make the
statements therein not misleading in light of the circumstances under which
they were made (following receipt of any supplement or amendment to any
Prospectus, the selling Holders shall deliver such amended, supplemental or
revised Prospectus in connection with any offers or sales of Registrable
Securities, and shall not deliver or use any Prospectus not so supplemented,
amended or revised);

 



 

(o) promptly notify the selling Holders and any underwriter(s) of the receipt
by the Partnership of any notification with respect to the suspension of the
qualification of any Registrable Securities for sale under the applicable
securities or blue sky laws of any jurisdiction;

 



 

(p) make available to each Holder (i) promptly after the same is prepared and
publicly distributed, filed with the SEC, or received by the Partnership, one
copy of each Registration Statement and any amendment thereto, each
preliminary Prospectus and Prospectus and each amendment or supplement
thereto, each letter written by or on behalf of the Partnership to the SEC or
the staff of the SEC (or other governmental agency or self-regulatory body or
other body

 



      
 

 



 

having jurisdiction, including any domestic or foreign securities exchange),
and each item of correspondence from the SEC or the staff of the SEC (or other
governmental agency or self-regulatory body or other body having jurisdiction,
including any domestic or foreign securities exchange), in each case relating
to such Registration Statement, and (ii) such number of copies of each
Prospectus, including a preliminary Prospectus, and all amendments and
supplements thereto and such other documents as any Holder or any underwriter
may reasonably request in order to facilitate the disposition of the
Registrable Securities. The Partnership will promptly notify the Holders of
the effectiveness of each Registration Statement or any post-effective
amendment or the filing of any supplement or amendment to such Registration
Statement or of any Prospectus supplement. The Partnership will promptly
respond to any and all comments received from the SEC, with a view towards
causing each Registration Statement or any amendment thereto to be declared
effective by the SEC as soon as practicable and shall file an acceleration
request, if necessary, as soon as practicable following the resolution or
clearance of all SEC comments or, if applicable, following notification by the
SEC that any such Registration Statement or any amendment thereto will not be
subject to review;

 



 

(q) take no direct or indirect action prohibited by Regulation M under the
Exchange Act; _provided_ , that, to the extent that any prohibition is
applicable to the Partnership, the Partnership will take all reasonable action
to make any such prohibition inapplicable;

 



 

(r) take such other actions as are reasonably necessary in order to facilitate
the disposition of such Registrable Securities; and

 



 

(s) notwithstanding any other provision of this Agreement, the Partnership
shall not be required to file a Registration Statement (or any amendment
thereto) or effect a requested Underwritten Shelf Takedown (or, if the
Partnership has filed a Shelf Registration Statement and has included
Registrable Securities therein, the Partnership shall be entitled to suspend
the offer and sale of Registrable Securities pursuant to such Registration
Statement) for a period of up to 60 days if (i) the board of directors of the
General Partner determines that a postponement is in the best interest of the
Partnership and its unitholders generally due to a proposed transaction
involving the Partnership and determines in good faith that the Partnerships
ability to pursue or consummate such a transaction would be materially and
adversely affected by any required disclosure of such transaction in the Shelf
Registration Statement, (ii) the board of directors of the General Partner
determines such registration would render the Partnership unable to comply
with applicable securities laws or (iii) the board of directors of the General
Partner determines such registration would require disclosure of material
information that the Partnership has a bona fide business purpose for
preserving as confidential (any such period, a " _Blackout Period_ ");
_provided_ , _however_ , that in no event shall any Blackout Period and/or
Suspension Period collectively exceed an aggregate of 90 days in any 12-month
period.

 



 

 **2.5** **_Suspension of Dispositions_** **.**

 



 

(a) Each Holder agrees by acquisition of any Registrable Securities that, upon
receipt of any notice (a " _Suspension Notice_ ") from the Partnership of the
occurrence of any event of the kind described in _Section 2.1(g)_, _Section
2.4(n)_ or _Section 2.4(s)_, such Holder will forthwith discontinue
disposition of Registrable Securities pursuant to the

 



      
 

 



 

Registration Statement until such Holders receipt of the copies of the
supplemented or amended Prospectus, or until it is advised in writing (the "
_Advice_ ") by the Partnership that the use of the Prospectus may be resumed,
and has received copies of any additional or supplemental filings which are
incorporated by reference in the Prospectus. ** ** The Partnership shall
extend the period of time during which the Partnership is required to maintain
the Registration Statement effective pursuant to this Agreement by the number
of days during the period from and including the date of the giving of such
Suspension Notice to and including the date such Holder either receives the
supplemented or amended Prospectus or receives the Advice. ** ** If so
directed by the Partnership, such Holder will deliver to the Partnership all
copies, other than permanent file copies then in such Holders possession, of
the Prospectus covering such Registrable Securities current at the time of
receipt of such notice. ** ** The Partnership shall use its reasonable best
efforts and take such actions as are reasonably necessary to render the Advice
as promptly as practicable. Any Underwritten Shelf Takedown which is suspended
because of a Suspension Notice shall not be deemed to be a Demand Request for
purposes of _Section 2.1(c)_ unless and until a suspension pursuant to this
_Section 2.5_ is concluded and such Underwritten Shelf Offering is completed.

 



 

(b) If (i) any of the Holders shall be prohibited from selling their
Registrable Securities under a Shelf Registration Statement or other
registration statement contemplated by this Agreement as a result of a
suspension pursuant to the immediately preceding paragraph in excess of the
periods permitted therein or (ii) a Shelf Registration Statement or other
registration statement contemplated by this Agreement is filed and declared
effective but, during the period from which such Shelf Registration Statement
is first declared or becomes effective until all Registrable Securities cease
to be Registrable Securities, shall thereafter cease to be effective or fail
to be usable for its intended purpose without being succeeded within 10
Business Days by a post-effective amendment thereto, a supplement to the
prospectus or a report filed with the SEC pursuant to Section 13(a), 13(c), 14
or l5(d) of the Exchange Act, then, until the suspension is lifted or a post-
effective amendment, supplement or report is filed with the SEC, but not
including any day on which a suspension is lifted or such amendment,
supplement or report is filed and declared effective, if applicable, the
Partnership shall pay each such Holder an amount equal to the Liquidated
Damages, following the earlier of (x) the date on which the suspension period
exceeded the permitted period and (y) the 11th Business Day after such Shelf
Registration Statement or other registration statement contemplated by this
Agreement ceased to be effective or failed to be useable for its intended
purposes, as liquidated damages and not as a penalty (for purposes of
calculating Liquidated Damages, the date in (x) or (y) above shall be deemed
the First Target Effective Date or, with respect to Apollo, the Target Apollo
Effective Date, as used in the definition of Liquidated Damages). For purposes
of this paragraph, a suspension shall be deemed lifted with respect to each
such Holder on the date that notice that the suspension has been terminated is
delivered to such Holder. Liquidated Damages shall cease to accrue pursuant to
this paragraph upon the earlier of (i) a suspension being deemed lifted and
(ii) when such Holder no longer holds Registrable Securities included in such
Shelf Registration Statement.

 



      
 

 



 

 **2.6** **_Registration Expenses_** **.** All Registration Expenses shall be
borne by the Partnership. ** ** In addition, for the avoidance of doubt, the
Partnership shall pay its internal expenses in connection with the performance
of or compliance with this Agreement (including, without limitation, all
salaries and expenses of its officers and employees performing legal or
accounting duties), the expense of any annual audit or quarterly review, the
expense of any liability insurance and the expenses and fees for listing the
securities to be registered on each securities exchange on which they are to
be listed. ** ** All Selling Expenses relating to Registrable Securities
registered shall be borne by the Holders of such Registrable Securities pro
rata on the basis of the number of Registrable Securities sold.

 



 

 **2.7** **_Indemnification_** **.**

 



 

(a) The Partnership agrees to indemnify and reimburse, to the fullest extent
permitted by law, each Holder that is a seller of Registrable Securities, and
each of its employees, advisors, agents, representatives, partners, officers,
and directors and each Person who controls such Holder (within the meaning of
the Securities Act or the Exchange Act) (collectively, the " _Seller
Affiliates_ ") (i) against any and all losses, claims, damages, liabilities
and expenses, joint or several (including, without limitation, attorneys fees
and disbursements except as limited by _Section 2.7(c)_) based upon, arising
out of, related to or resulting from any untrue or alleged untrue statement of
a material fact contained in any Registration Statement or Prospectus, any
Written Testing-the-Waters Communication, or any amendment thereof or
supplement thereto, or any omission or alleged omission of a material fact
required to be stated therein or necessary to make the statements therein not
misleading, (ii) against any and all losses, liabilities, claims, damages and
expenses whatsoever, as incurred, to the extent of the aggregate amount paid
in settlement of any litigation or investigation or proceeding by any
governmental agency or body, commenced or threatened, or of any claim
whatsoever based upon, arising out of, related to or resulting from any such
untrue statement or omission or alleged untrue statement or omission, and
(iii) against any and all costs and expenses (including reasonable fees,
charges and disbursements of counsel) as may be reasonably incurred in
investigating, preparing or defending against any litigation, investigation or
proceeding by any governmental agency or body, commenced or threatened, or any
claim whatsoever based upon, arising out of, related to or resulting from any
such untrue statement or omission or alleged untrue statement or omission, or
such violation of the Securities Act or Exchange Act, to the extent that any
such expense or cost is not paid under subparagraph (i) or (ii) above; except
insofar as any such statements are made in reliance upon information furnished
to the Partnership in writing by such seller or any Seller Affiliate expressly
for use therein. The reimbursements required by this _Section 2.7(a)_ will
be made by periodic payments during the course of the investigation or
defense, as and when bills are received or expenses incurred.

 



 

(b) In connection with any Registration Statement in which a Holder that is a
seller of Registrable Securities is participating, each such Holder will
furnish to the Partnership such information and affidavits as the Partnership
reasonably requests for use in connection with any such Registration Statement
or Prospectus or any Written Testing-the Waters Communication and, to the
fullest extent permitted by law, each such seller will indemnify the
Partnership and its directors and officers and each Person who

 



      
 

 



 

controls the Partnership (within the meaning of the Securities Act or the
Exchange Act) against any and all losses, claims, damages, liabilities and
expenses (including, without limitation, reasonable attorneys fees and
disbursements except as limited by _Section 2.7(c)_) resulting from any
untrue statement or alleged untrue statement of a material fact contained in
the Registration Statement, Prospectus or any amendment thereof or supplement
thereto or any omission or alleged omission of a material fact required to be
stated therein or necessary to make the statements therein not misleading, but
only to the extent that such untrue statement or alleged untrue statement or
omission or alleged omission is contained in any information or affidavit so
furnished by such seller or any of its Seller Affiliates in writing
specifically for inclusion in the Registration Statement; _provided_ that
the obligation to indemnify will be several, not joint and several, among such
sellers of Registrable Securities, and the liability of each such seller of
Registrable Securities will be in proportion to the amount of Registrable
Securities sold by them, and, _provided_ , _further_ , that such liability
will be limited to the net amount received by such seller from the applicable
sale of Registrable Securities.

 



 

(c) Any Person entitled to indemnification hereunder will (i) give prompt
written notice to the indemnifying party of any claim with respect to which it
seeks indemnification ( _provided_ that the failure to give such notice shall
not limit the rights of such Person) and (ii) unless in such indemnified
partys reasonable judgment a conflict of interest between such indemnified
and indemnifying parties may exist with respect to such claim, permit such
indemnifying party to assume the defense of such claim with counsel reasonably
satisfactory to the indemnified party; _provided_ , _however_ , that any
Person entitled to indemnification hereunder shall have the right to employ
separate counsel and to participate in the defense of such claim, but the fees
and expenses of such counsel shall be at the expense of such Person unless (A)
the indemnifying party has agreed to pay such fees or expenses or (B) the
indemnifying party shall have failed to assume the defense of such claim and
employ counsel reasonably satisfactory to such Person. ** ** If such defense
is not assumed by the indemnifying party as permitted hereunder, the
indemnifying party will not be subject to any liability for any settlement
made by the indemnified party without its consent (but such consent will not
be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed). If such defense is assumed
by the indemnifying party pursuant to the provisions hereof, such indemnifying
party shall not settle or otherwise compromise the applicable claim unless (i)
such settlement or compromise contains a full and unconditional release of the
indemnified party or (ii) the indemnified party otherwise consents in writing
(which consent will not be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed). An
indemnifying party who is not entitled to, or elects not to, assume the
defense of a claim will not be obligated to pay the fees and expenses of more
than one counsel for all parties indemnified (which shall be chosen by the
Holders of a majority of Registrable Securities so indemnified) by such
indemnifying party with respect to such claim, unless in the reasonable
judgment of any indemnified party, a conflict of interest may exist between
such indemnified party and any other of such indemnified parties with respect
to such claim, in which event the indemnifying party shall be obligated to pay
the reasonable fees and disbursements of such additional counsel or counsels.

 



 

(d) Each party hereto agrees that, if for any reason the indemnification
provisions contemplated by _Section 2.7(a)_ or _Section 2.7(b)_ are
unavailable to or

 



      
 

 



 

insufficient to hold harmless an indemnified party in respect of any losses,
claims, damages, liabilities or expenses (or actions in respect thereof)
referred to therein, then each indemnifying party shall contribute to the
amount paid or payable by such indemnified party as a result of such losses,
claims, liabilities or expenses (or actions in respect thereof) in such
proportion as is appropriate to reflect the relative fault of the indemnifying
party and the indemnified party in connection with the actions which resulted
in the losses, claims, damages, liabilities or expenses as well as any other
relevant equitable considerations. The relative fault of such indemnifying
party and indemnified party shall be determined by reference to, among other
things, whether the untrue or alleged untrue statement of a material fact or
omission or alleged omission to state a material fact relates to information
supplied by such indemnifying party or indemnified party, and the parties
relative intent, knowledge, access to information and opportunity to correct
or prevent such statement or omission. The parties hereto agree that it would
not be just and equitable if contribution pursuant to this _Section 2.7(d)_
were determined by pro rata allocation (even if the Holders or any
underwriters or all of them were treated as one entity for such purpose) or by
any other method of allocation which does not take account of the equitable
considerations referred to in this _Section 2.7(d)_ **.** The amount paid or
payable by an indemnified party as a result of the losses, claims, damages,
liabilities or expenses (or actions in respect thereof) referred to above
shall be deemed to include any legal or other fees or expenses reasonably
incurred by such indemnified party in connection with investigating or, except
as provided in _Section 2.7(c)_, defending any such action or claim.
Notwithstanding the provisions of this _Section 2.7(d)_, no Holder shall be
required to contribute an amount greater than the dollar amount by which the
net proceeds received by such Holder with respect to the sale of any
Registrable Securities exceeds the amount of damages which such Holder has
otherwise been required to pay by reason of any and all untrue or alleged
untrue statements of material fact or omissions or alleged omissions of
material fact made in any Registration Statement or Prospectus or any
amendment thereof or supplement thereto related to such sale of Registrable
Securities. No person guilty of fraudulent misrepresentation (within the
meaning of Section 11(f) of the Securities Act) shall be entitled to
contribution from any person who was not guilty of such fraudulent
misrepresentation. The Holders obligations in this _Section 2.7(d)_ to
contribute shall be several in proportion to the amount of Registrable
Securities registered by them and not joint.

 



 

If indemnification is available under this _Section 2.7_, the indemnifying
parties shall indemnify each indemnified party to the full extent provided in
_Section 2.7(a)_ and _Section 2.7(b)_ without regard to the relative fault
of said indemnifying party or indemnified party or any other equitable
consideration provided for in this _Section 2.7(d)_ subject, in the case of
the Holders, to the limited dollar amounts set forth in _Section 2.7(b)_.

 



 

(e) No indemnifying party shall be liable for any settlement effected without
its written consent (which consent may not be unreasonably delayed or
withheld). Each indemnifying party agrees that it will not, without the
indemnified partys prior written consent, consent to entry of any judgment or
settle or compromise any pending or threatened claim, action or proceeding in
respect to which indemnification or contribution

 



       
 

 



 

may be sought hereunder unless the foregoing contains and unconditional
release, in form and substance reasonably satisfactory to the indemnified
parties, of the indemnified parties from all liability and obligation arising
therefrom.

 



 

(f) The indemnification and contribution provided for under this Agreement
will remain in full force and effect regardless of any investigation made by
or on behalf of the indemnified party or any officer, director or controlling
Person of such indemnified party and will survive the transfer of securities.

 



 

 **2.8** **_Transfer of Registration Rights_** **.** The registration rights
of a Holder under this Agreement with respect to any Registrable Securities
may be transferred or assigned to any purchaser or transferee of Registrable
Securities; _provided_ , _however_ , that (i) such Holder shall give the
Partnership written notice prior to the time of such transfer stating the name
and address of the transferee and identifying the securities with respect to
which the rights under this Agreement are being transferred; (ii) such
transferee shall agree in writing, in form and substance reasonably
satisfactory to the Partnership, to be bound as a Holder by the provisions of
this Agreement; and (iii) immediately following such transfer the further
disposition of such securities by such transferee shall be restricted to the
extent set forth under applicable law.

 



 

 **2.9** **_Current Public Information_** **.** With a view to making
available to the Holders of Registrable Securities the benefits of Rule 144
and Rule 144A promulgated under the Securities Act and other rules and
regulations of the SEC that may at any time permit a Holder of Registrable
Securities to sell securities of the Partnership to the public without
registration, the Partnership covenants that it will (i) for as long as the
Common Units are registered pursuant to Section 12(b), Section 12(g) or
Section 15(d) of the Exchange Act, use its reasonable best efforts to file in
a timely manner all reports and other documents required, if any, to be filed
by it under the Securities Act and the Exchange Act and the rules and
regulations adopted thereunder, (ii) if it is not required to file such
reports, make available information necessary to comply with Rule 144 and Rule
144A, if available with respect to resales of the Registrable Securities under
the Securities Act, at all times, and (iii) take such further action as any
holder or holders of Registrable Securities may reasonably request, all to the
extent required from time to time to enable such Holder to sell Registrable
Securities without registration under the Securities Act within the limitation
of the exemptions provided by (x) Rule 144 and Rule 144A promulgated under the
Securities Act (if available with respect to resales of the Registrable
Securities), as such rules may be amended from time to time or (y) any other
rules or regulations now existing or hereafter adopted by the SEC.

 



 

 **2.10** **_Partnership Obligations Regarding Transfers_** **.** In
connection with any sale or transfer of Registrable Securities by any Holder,
including any sale or transfer pursuant to Rule 144 and Rule 144A promulgated
under the Securities Act and other rules and regulations of the SEC that may
at any time permit a Holder of Registrable Securities to sell securities of
the Partnership to the public without registration, the Partnership shall, to
the extent allowed by law, take any and all action necessary or reasonably
requested by such Holder in order to permit or facilitate such sale or
transfer, including, without limitation, at the sole expense of the
Partnership, by (i) issuing such directions to any transfer agent, registrar
or depositary, as applicable, (ii) delivering such opinions to the transfer
agent, registrar or depositary as are customary for the transaction of this
type and are reasonably requested by the same, and

 



      
 

 



 

(iii) taking or causing to be taken such other actions as are reasonably
necessary (in each case on a timely basis) in order to cause any legends,
notations or similar designations restricting transferability of the
Registrable Securities held by such Holder to be removed and to rescind any
transfer restrictions (other than as may apply pursuant to _Section 2.3)_
with respect to such Registrable Securities; _provided_ , _however_ , that
such Holder shall deliver to the Partnership, in form and substance reasonably
satisfactory to the Partnership, representation letters regarding such
Holders compliance with Rule 144 or Rule 144A, as may be applicable.

 



 

 **2.11** **_No Conflict of Rights_** **.** The Partnership represents and
warrants that except for the Existing Registration Rights Agreement, it has
not granted, and is not subject to, any registration rights that are superior
to, inconsistent with or that in any way violate or subordinate the rights
granted to the Holders hereby. ** ** The Partnership shall not, prior to the
termination of this Agreement, grant any registration rights that are superior
to, inconsistent with or that in any way violate or subordinate the rights
granted to the Holders hereby.

 



 

 **2.12** **_Free Writing Prospectuses_** **.** The Partnership shall not
permit any officer, director, underwriter, broker or any other person acting
on behalf of the Partnership to use any free writing prospectus (as defined in
Rule 405 under the Securities Act) in connection with any registration
statement covering Registrable Securities, without the prior written consent
of each participating Holder and any underwriter. No Holder shall, or permit
any officer, manager, underwriter, broker or any other person acting on behalf
of such Holder to use any free-writing prospectus in connection with any
registration statement covering Registrable Securities, without the prior
written consent of the Partnership.

 



 

 **2.13** **_Election Amendment_** **.** If, in the opinion of the Required
Holders (including Apollo), an amendment to this Agreement is necessary to
provide the Holders with the same registration rights with respect to
Registrable Securities as contemplated under this Agreement, the Partnership
and the Holders shall prepare and deliver, simultaneously with the effective
date of the Election, the Election Amendment to reflect the final structure of
the Election and any related amendment to the Partnerships agreement of
limited partnership. If applicable in connection with the Election, the
Election Amendment shall provide for the registration, on the same terms and
conditions of the Agreement, of any securities the Registrable Securities will
be convertible into as a result of the Election.

 



 

 **2.14** **_Section 2(a)(11) Underwriter_** **.** The Partnership will not
name a Holder as an underwriter as defined in Section 2(a)(11) of the
Securities Act in any Shelf Registration Statement without such Holders
consent. If the staff of the SEC requires the Partnership to name any Holder
as an underwriter as defined in Section 2(a)(11) of the Securities Act, and
such Holder does not consent thereto, then such Holders Registrable
Securities shall not be included on such Shelf Registration Statement, such
Holder shall no longer be entitled to receive Liquidated Damages under this
Agreement with respect to such Holders Registrable Securities and the
Partnership shall have no further obligations hereunder with respect to
Registrable Securities held by such Holder, unless such Holder has not had an
opportunity to conduct customary underwriters due diligence (including
receipt of comfort letters and opinions of counsel) with respect to the
Partnership at the time such Holders consent is sought.

(a) This Agreement shall be constructed, interpreted and enforced in
accordance with, and the respective rights and obligations of the parties

principles of conflicts of law that would require the application of the laws
of another jurisdiction.

trial by jury in any legal proceeding arising out of or related to this
Agreement.

 



 

 **4.3** **_No Third-Party Beneficiaries_** **.** This Agreement is for the
sole benefit of the parties hereto and their respective successors and
permitted assigns and nothing herein, express or implied, is intended to or
shall confer upon any other Person any legal or equitable right, benefit or

the obligations of the parties hereto set forth in _Section 2.7_.

 



 

 **4.4** **_Successors and Assigns_** **.** Except as otherwise expressly
provided herein, this Agreement shall be binding upon and benefit the
Partnership, each Holder and their respective successors and assigns. ** **
The Partnership shall not, directly or indirectly, enter into any merger,

consolidation or reorganization, agree in writing to assume the obligations of
the Partnership under this Agreement, and for that purpose references
hereunder to "Registrable Securities" shall be deemed to include the common
equity interests or other securities, if any, which the Holders would be
entitled to receive in exchange for Registrable Securities under any such
merger, consolidation or reorganization, _provided_ that, to the extent the

as are issued or issuable upon conversion of said convertible securities shall
be included within the definition of "Registrable Securities."

 



 

 **4.5** **_Counterparts_** **.** This Agreement may be executed by the
parties in separate counterparts (including by means of executed counterparts

impaired thereby.

 



 

 **4.7** **_No Waivers; Amendments_** **.**

 



 

(a) No failure or delay on the part of the Partnership or any Holder in
exercising any right, power or remedy hereunder shall operate as a waiver
thereof, nor shall any single or partial exercise of any such right, power or
remedy preclude any other or further exercise thereof or the exercise of any
other right, power or remedy. The remedies provided for herein are cumulative
and are not exclusive of any remedies that may be available to the Partnership
or any Holder at law or in equity or otherwise.

referred to herein or therein or delivered pursuant hereto or thereto, contain
the entire agreement between the Holders and the Partnership with respect to
the subject matter hereof and supersede all prior and contemporaneous
arrangements or understandings with respect thereto.

 



 

 **4.9** **_Remedies; Specific Performance_** **.**

 



 

(a) Each Holder shall have all rights and remedies reserved for such Holder
pursuant to this Agreement and all rights and remedies which such Holder has
been granted at any time under any other agreement or contract and all of the
rights which such Holder has under any law or equity. ** ** Any Person having
any rights under any provision of this Agreement will be entitled to enforce
such rights specifically, to recover damages by reason of any breach of any
provision of this Agreement and to exercise all other rights granted by law or
equity.

 



 

(b) The parties hereto recognize and agree that money damages may be
insufficient to compensate the Holders of any Registrable Securities for

terms hereof will be available in the event of any such breach, without the
necessity of posting bonds or other security. ** ** If any action should be
brought in equity to enforce any of the provisions of this Agreement, none of
the parties hereto shall raise the defense that there is an adequate remedy at
law.

 



 

 **4.10** **_Negotiated Agreement_** **.** This Agreement was negotiated by

nothing herein shall require Service Provider to perform any services or
operations of any kind other than as set forth herein.

(a) Except as expressly provided in _Schedule A_ or _Schedule B_ , (i) Service

of Service Provider or to which Service Provider is subject relating to
business conduct and ethical practices.

 



 

(b) Buyer acknowledges and agrees, on its behalf and on behalf of the Acquired
Operating Companies, that Service Provider and those providing such Services
on its behalf have, and will have, responsibilities with respect to the other
businesses of Service Provider and its Affiliates and may not be dedicated

performing such Services (including agents, temporary employees, Third Parties

(a) Service Provider shall use its reasonable best efforts to ensure that the
Services to be provided hereunder (including any Services provided by a Third
Party) shall be performed with the degree of care, diligence and skill as a
reasonably prudent Person involved in the acquisition, development and
management of mineral and royalty interests in oil and natural gas properties
comparable to those of the Serviced Properties would exercise (the " **
_Standard of Care_** ").

 



      
 

 



 

(b) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary set forth in this Agreement,
Service Provider does not represent or warrant the outcome or result with
respect to the Services, except as expressly set forth herein.

 



 

(c) BUYER ACKNOWLEDGES THAT SERVICE PROVIDER IS NOT IN THE BUSINESS OF
PROVIDING THE SERVICES AND THAT SERVICE PROVIDER IS PROVIDING THE SERVICES AS
AN ACCOMMODATION TO BUYER FOLLOWING THE CONSUMMATION OF THE TRANSACTIONS
CONTEMPLATED IN THE PURCHASE AGREEMENTS. THE SERVICES TO BE PROVIDED UNDER
THIS AGREEMENT ARE FURNISHED WITHOUT WARRANTY OF MERCHANTABILITY OR FITNESS
FOR ANY PARTICULAR PURPOSE.

 



 

2.4. _Service Coordinator_. Buyer and Service Provider shall nominate in
writing a representative to act as the primary contact with respect to the
provision of the Services and the resolution of disputes under this Agreement
(each such person, a " ** _Service Coordinator_** "). The initial Service
Coordinators shall be [*] for Buyer and [*] for Service Provider (or their
designated delegates). Unless Service Provider and Buyer otherwise agree in
writing, Service Provider and Buyer agree that all notices and communications
relating to this Agreement other than those day-to-day communications and
billings relating to the actual provision of the Services shall be delivered
to the Service Coordinators in accordance with _Section 7.3_ hereof. The
Service Coordinators shall use their commercially reasonable efforts to meet
as expeditiously as possible to resolve any dispute hereunder.

 



 

2.5. _Cooperation_. The Parties shall cooperate with one another and provide
such further assistance as the other Party may reasonably request in
connection with the provision of Services hereunder. During the term of this
Agreement and for so long as any Services are being provided with respect to
the Serviced Properties by Service Provider, Service Provider and Buyer shall
provide the other Party and its authorized representatives reasonable access,
during regular business hours upon reasonable notice, to it and its employees,
representatives, facilities and books and records to the extent reasonably
necessary in order to perform the Services. Buyer hereby acknowledges that the
cooperation of Buyer and the Acquired Operating Companies is essential to
Service Providers provision of the Services hereunder and agrees that, to the
extent that Service Providers failure to perform the Services in accordance
with the terms of this Agreement, including the Standard of Care, is caused by
the failure of Buyer and the Acquired Operating Companies to cooperate in
provision of the Services, such failure shall be deemed waived by Buyer.

 



 

2.6. _Remittance of Amounts Collected_. To the extent Service Provider shall
have charge or possession of any of Buyers assets in connection with the
provision of the Services pursuant to this Agreement, Service Provider shall
(a) hold such assets in the name and for the benefit of Buyer (or its
designated Affiliates) and (b) separately maintain, and not commingle, such
assets with any assets of Service Provider, Sellers or any other Person.
Within [*] Business Days of the Effective Date, Service Provider shall use its
reasonable best efforts to transfer access and title to all lockbox accounts
and other bank or deposit accounts used in connection with the Serviced
Properties to Buyer, such that Buyer has exclusive control over and access to
all such accounts; _provided_ , that to the extent that Wells Fargo Bank,
National Association does not permit the transfer of access or

 



      
 

 



 

title of such accounts, Service Provider shall use its reasonable best efforts
to work with Wells Fargo Bank, National Association to attempt to find a
solution. For the avoidance of doubt, the accounts described in the preceding
sentence shall include, but shall not be limited to, the accounts described on
_Schedule_ C to this Agreement.

 



 

2.7. _Termination of Services_. The obligations of Service Provider under this
Agreement to provide (a) the Full Term Services shall terminate on the End
Date and (b) the Short Term Services shall terminate on the date that is
ninety (90) days after the Effective Date (each of (a) and (b), a " **
_Services Term_** ").

 



 

 **ARTICLE III 
FEES AND EXPENSES**

 



 

3.1. _Services Fees_ _; Signing Fee_.

 



 

(a) During the applicable Services Term, Buyer shall pay to Service Provider a
monthly fee with respect to each Service equal to the amount set forth next to
such Service on _Schedule A_ and _Schedule B_ (each such fee, a " ** _Services
Fee_** " and, collectively, the " ** _Services Fees_** "). Buyer shall remit
payment to Service Provider for the applicable Services Fees for such month
within five (5) days of the beginning of each month; _provided_ , _however_ ,
that if the Effective Date is other than the first day of a calendar month,
then the applicable Services Fees for such month shall be remitted to Service
Provider within five (5) days of the Effective Date. If the Effective Date is
other than the first day of a calendar month, or if the term of this Agreement
ends on any day other than the last day of a calendar month, the amount of the
Services Fees that Buyer shall owe for any such month shall be prorated on a
daily basis

 



 

(b) Within ten (10) days of the Effective Date, Buyer shall remit a one-time
payment of $600,000 to Service Provider (the " ** _Signing Fee_** ") to be
used by Service Provider in the retention of employees, consultants and
contractors engaged by Service Provider in the provision of the Services.

 



 

3.2. _Third Party Fees_. Buyer shall reimburse Service Provider for documented
out-of-pocket costs and expenses reasonably incurred by Service Provider and
paid to any Third Party solely as a result of providing the Services hereunder
(and not otherwise reimbursed to Service Provider, including under the
Services Fees) (the " ** _Third Party Expenses_** "); _provided, however_ ,
that Service Provider shall not incur Third Party Expenses in excess of
$25,000 during any month without the prior written consent of Buyer, and Buyer
shall have no obligation to reimburse Service Provider for any such Third
Party Expenses for which Buyer did not provide its prior written consent.

 



 

3.3. _Invoicing for Third Party Fees_. As soon as reasonably practicable after
the end of each month, Service Provider shall provide Buyer with an invoice
(each, an " ** _Invoice_** ") for the preceding month reflecting (a) the Third
Party Expenses incurred during such month and (b) the amount due for Taxes
pursuant to _Section 3.7_ (collectively, the " ** _Fees_** "). Buyer shall
remit to Service Provider the Fees billed to it within fifteen (15) days of
receipt of the applicable Invoice. By way of example, the first such Fees
shall be due and payable

 



      
 

 



 

on or before the fifteenth (15th) day after the first Invoice is received by
Buyer and (ii) the last Invoice shall be due and payable on or before the
fifteenth (15th) day after the last Invoice is received by Buyer. Each Invoice
shall be directed to Buyers Service Coordinator or such other person
designated in writing from time to time by such Service Coordinator. The
Invoice shall set forth the Fees due in reasonable detail for the period
covered by such Invoice. Upon written request, Service Provider shall promptly
provide to Buyer reasonable support documentation to permit Buyer to verify
the accuracy of an Invoice.

 



 

3.4. _Objection_. Except to the extent such expense or cost was previously
approved by Buyer in writing (including via email), Buyer may object to any
expense or cost included on an Invoice, including on the ground that the same
was not a reasonable or appropriate cost incurred by Service Provider in
connection with the Services; _provided that_ such objection is made in
writing to Service Provider within fifteen (15) days following the date of
Buyers receipt of the disputed Invoice.

 



 

3.5. _Dispute Resolution_. In the event of an invoicing or payment dispute not
otherwise resolved between the Service Coordinators, Buyer shall promptly
notify Service Provider in writing of such disputed item and the reasons for
the dispute. The Parties shall, during the fifteen (15) days after such
notice, use their commercially reasonable efforts to reach agreement on the
disputed items or amounts. If the Parties are unable to reach agreement within
such period, they shall promptly thereafter cause a nationally recognized
accounting firm agreeable to the Parties (the " ** _Accounting Referee_** ")
to review this Agreement and the disputed items or amounts. The Accounting
Referee shall deliver to the Parties as promptly as practicable (but in any
event no later than thirty (30) days from the date of engagement of the
Accounting Referee), a report setting forth the Accounting Referees
determination of the appropriate resolution of the disputed items or amounts.
Such determination shall be final and binding upon the Parties absent manifest
error. The cost of such review and report shall be borne equally by each Party
involved in the dispute.

 



 

3.6. _Error Correction_. Each Party shall make adjustments to charges as
required to reflect the discovery of undisputed errors or omissions in
charges; _provided, however_ , that any errors or omissions the correction of
which would result in additional or increased charges or fees for Services
must be corrected within three (3) months after the date of payment of the
applicable Services Fees or the related Invoice, as applicable.

 



 

3.7. _Taxes._ All transfer taxes, excises, fees or other charges (including
value added, sales, use or receipts taxes, but not including a tax on or
measured by the income, net or gross revenues, business activity or capital of
Service Provider), or any increase therein, now or hereafter imposed directly
or indirectly by Law, which Service Provider is required to pay or incur in
connection with the provision of Services hereunder (" ** _Tax_** "), shall be
passed on to Buyer as an explicit surcharge and shall be paid by Buyer in
addition to any payment to cover expenses and costs related to the Services
provided. If Buyer submits to Service Provider a timely and valid resale or
other exemption certificate reasonably acceptable to Service Provider and
sufficient to support the exemption from any applicable Tax, then such Tax
shall not be added to the Fees pursuant to _Section 3.3_, _provided, however_
, that if Service Provider is ever required to pay such Tax, Buyer shall
promptly reimburse Service Provider for such Tax, including any interest,

 



      
 

 



 

penalties and attorneys fees related thereto. The Parties shall cooperate to
minimize the imposition of any Taxes.

(a) BUYER SHALL ASSUME ALL LIABILITY FOR AND SHALL RELEASE, INDEMNIFY, DEFEND

LOSSES, RELATED TO, ARISING OUT OF, OR IN CONNECTION WITH (I) ANY MATERIAL
BREACH BY BUYER OF THIS AGREEMENT OR (II) THE PERSONAL INJURY, DEATH, DAMAGE
TO PROPERTY OF OR LIABILITY OF BUYER OR ITS AFFILIATES (INCLUDING THE ACQUIRED
OPERATING COMPANIES), ANY THIRD PARTY OR ANY OF THEIR RESPECTIVE EMPLOYEES,
OFFICERS, DIRECTORS AND AGENTS AND ARISING FROM, CONNECTED WITH OR UNDER THIS
AGREEMENT. FOR THE AVOIDANCE OF DOUBT, BUYERS ONLY REMEDY FOR BREACH OF THIS
AGREEMENT OR GROSS NEGLIGENCE, WILLFUL MISCONDUCT OR ANY OTHER FAULT OF
SERVICE PROVIDER PURSUANT TO THIS AGREEMENT SHALL BE TERMINATION OF THIS
AGREEMENT PURSUANT TO _SECTION 5.2_.

 



 

(b) Buyer will have the right to control the defense of any claim for which a
Service Provider Indemnified Party has a right to indemnification hereunder
and shall reimburse each Service Provider Indemnified Party for all reasonable
costs and expenses (including reasonable attorneys fees and expenses of one
counsel for all such Service Provider Indemnified Parties (and any required
local counsel, each to be selected by Service Provider) and any other
litigation-related expenses) as they are incurred in connection with
investigating, preparing, pursuing, defending or assisting in the defense of
any action, claim, suit, investigation or proceeding for which such Service
Provider Indemnified Party would be entitled to indemnification under the
terms of the previous sentence, whether or not such Service Provider
Indemnified Party is a party thereto; _provided_ that the payment of such
costs and expenses shall be made only upon delivery to Buyer of a written
affirmation by such Service Provider Indemnified Party of such Persons good
faith belief that such Person has met the requirements necessary for
indemnification under _Section 4.1(a)_ and a written undertaking, by or on
behalf of such Person, to repay all amounts so advanced if it shall ultimately
be determined that such Service Provider Indemnified Party is not entitled to
be indemnified under _Section 4.1(a)_. Buyer agrees that it will not, without
the prior written consent of the applicable Service Provider Indemnified Party
(such consent not to be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed),
settle, compromise or consent to the entry of any judgment in any pending or
threatened claim, action or proceeding subject to indemnification pursuant to
_Section 4.1(a)_ (and to which such Service Provider Indemnified Party is a
party) unless such settlement, compromise or consent includes an unconditional
release of such Service Provider Indemnified Party from all liability arising
out of such claim, action or proceeding, and does not contain an admission of
guilt or liability on the part of such Service Provider Indemnified Party.

 



      
 

 



 

(c) The rights of indemnification hereunder will be in addition to any other
rights and remedies any Person may have under any other agreement or
instrument to which such Person is or becomes a party or is, or otherwise
becomes, a beneficiary, or under any applicable Law.

 



 

(d) THE FOREGOING INDEMNITIES ARE INTENDED TO BE ENFORCEABLE AGAINST BUYER IN
ACCORDANCE WITH THE EXPRESS TERMS AND SCOPE THEREOF NOTWITHSTANDING ANY
EXPRESS NEGLIGENCE RULE OR ANY SIMILAR DIRECTIVE THAT WOULD PROHIBIT OR
OTHERWISE LIMIT INDEMNITIES BECAUSE OF THE SOLE, CONCURRENT, ACTIVE OR PASSIVE
NEGLIGENCE, STRICT LIABILITY OR FAULT OF ANY OF THE SERVICE PROVIDER
INDEMNIFIED PARTIES.

the Purchase Agreement. The following terms, when used in this Agreement,

with such specified Person through one or more intermediaries or otherwise.
For the purposes of this definition, "control" means, where used with respect
to any Person, the possession, directly or indirectly, of the power to direct
or cause the direction of the management and policies of such Person, whether
through the ownership of voting securities, by contract or otherwise, and the
terms "controlling" and "controlled" have correlative meanings.

 



 

" ** _beneficially own_** " has the meaning assigned to such term in Rule
13d-3 and Rule 13d-5 under the Exchange Act, except that in calculating the
beneficial ownership of any particular "person" (as that term is used in
Section 13(d)(3) of the Exchange Act), such "person" will be deemed to have
beneficial ownership of all securities that such "person" has the right to
acquire by

 



      
 

 



 

conversion or exercise of other securities, whether such right is currently
exercisable or is exercisable only after the passage of time.

Period_** "), the Seller Holders will not lend, offer, pledge, sell, contract
to sell, sell any option or contract to purchase, purchase any option or
contract to sell, grant any option, right, or warrant to purchase or otherwise
transfer or dispose of, directly or indirectly, any Common Units, whether any
such transaction is to be settled by delivery of Common Units or other
securities, in cash, or otherwise. In the interest of clarity, nothing in this
_Section 2.1_ shall restrict the Seller Holders from utilizing customary
hedging strategies that may involve the pledge of Common Units as collateral
until such time as the Common Units are ultimately disposed of on or after
expiration of the Lock-Up Period. Further, nothing in this _Section 2.1_
shall prohibit or limit the ability of any Seller Holder to effect any
transfer of Common Units (a) as a bona fide gift or gifts or any other similar
transfer or distribution that does not involve a sale or other disposition for
value, (b) to any such Persons limited partners, members or stockholders as
part of a distribution, (c) to any corporation, partnership or other entity
that is an Affiliate of such Person, in each case of the forgoing clauses (a)
through (c), so long as (i) such transfer does not occur prior to the
consummation of the Election and (ii) the transferee agrees in writing to be
bound by all the terms of this _Section 2.1_, (d) pursuant to a bona fide
third party tender offer,

 



      
 

 



 

merger, consolidation or other similar transaction made to all holders of
Common Units or (e) pursuant to an order of a court or regulatory agency.

 



 

Section 2.2 **_Voting of Covered Units_**. Provided that Buyer has complied
with its covenants in Section 6.17(a) of the Purchase Agreement, during the
period prior to the Termination Date, the Seller Holders irrevocably and
unconditionally agree that at any meeting of unitholders of Buyer (whether
annual or special and whether or not such meeting is adjourned or postponed),
however called, including any adjournment or postponement thereof, or in
connection with any written authorization or consent of unitholders of Buyer,
each Seller Holder shall, and shall cause any holder of record of any Common
Units beneficially owned by such Seller Holder, to:

 



 

(a) when a meeting is held, appear at such meeting or otherwise cause such
Covered Units to be counted as present thereat for the purpose of establishing
a quorum, and, when a record date is set for an action by written consent,
respond to each request by Buyer for written consent, if any; and

 



 

(b) vote (or consent), or cause to be voted at such meeting (or validly
execute and return and cause such consent to be granted within the time period
requested by Buyer with respect to), all such Covered Units beneficially owned
by such Seller Holder; as of the record date for the unitholder meeting or
action by written consent in favor of:

 



 

(i) the Election; and

 



 

(ii) the proposal by Buyer to reflect any revisions as may be necessary or
appropriate to reflect the Election and to amend the LTIP to proportionately
increase the number of Common Units eligible for issuance under the LTIP after
taking into account the Additional Common Units; _provided_ , _however_ , that
Seller Holders shall not be required to, and shall not be required to cause
any holder of record of any Common Units beneficially owned by Seller Holders,
to vote (or consent) to such action if the aggregate Additional Common Units
exceed 20,000,000 Common Units or the aggregate number of Common Units
eligible for issuance under the LTIP exceeds twelve and a half percent (12.5%)
of the sum of (A) the aggregate Common Units of Buyer outstanding at such time
(which shall include the number of Common Units issued under the Purchase
Agreement and the [HM Purchase Agreement // HR Purchase Agreement] and
issuable upon conversion of any Series A Preferred Units of Buyer that are
issued on the Closing Date pursuant to the Preferred Equity Purchase Agreement
assuming such Series A Preferred Units converted on the Closing Date (which
amount for this purpose shall not exceed 5,945,946 Common Units), but without
regard to any Common Units that were issued under the LTIP) and (B) the
aggregate number of Common Units eligible for issuance under the LTIP.

 



 

(c) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained herein, the Seller
Holders are entering into this Agreement solely in their capacity as
beneficial owners of the Covered Units, and nothing herein is intended to or
shall limit, affect or restrict any manager, general partner, director or
officer of Seller Holders (including any appointee or representative of the
Seller Holders) to the extent acting solely either in his or her capacity as a
manager, general partner, director or officer of any member of Seller Holders
(including voting on matters put to

 



      
 

 



 

any board of directors, board of managers, general partner or any committee
thereof, influencing officers, employees, agents, management or the other
directors of Seller Holders and taking any action or making any statement at
any meeting of such board of directors, board of managers, general partner or
any committee thereof) or in the exercise of his or her fiduciary duties as a
manager, general partner, director or officer of the Seller Holders.

and will not enter into at any time prior to the Termination Date, any voting
agreement or voting trust with respect to any Covered Units that is
inconsistent with its obligations under this Agreement, (ii) has not granted,
and will not grant at any time prior to the Termination Date, a proxy, consent
or power of attorney with respect to the Covered Units that is inconsistent

satisfying, its obligations under this Agreement.
