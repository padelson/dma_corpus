Parent_**.

 



 

(i) Parent Stock Options. As of the Effective Time, each Parent Stock Option

" **Parent Replacement Option** ") to acquire the same number of shares of
Holdco Common Stock as the number of shares of Parent Common Stock subject to
such Parent Stock Option as of immediately prior to the Effective Time, at the
same exercise price per share of Holdco Common Stock as the exercise price per
share of Parent Common Stock of such Parent Stock Option as of immediately
prior to the Effective Time; _provided, that_ the exercise price and the
number of shares of Holdco Common Stock subject to the Parent Replacement
Option shall be determined in a manner consistent with the requirements of
Section 409A of the Code. Each Parent Replacement Option shall have, and shall
be subject to, substantially the same terms and conditions as applied to the
corresponding Parent Stock Option immediately prior to the Effective Time

Stock Option shall become vested solely by reason of the execution of this
Agreement or the consummation of the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement.

Parent Common Stock (or, if applicable, cash or a combination thereof),
subject to time-based vesting, settlement or other applicable restrictions
(each, a " **Parent RSU** "), that is outstanding as of immediately prior to
the Effective Time shall, by virtue of the Parent Merger and without any
action on the part of the holder thereof, be automatically assumed by Holdco
and shall be converted at the Effective Time into a restricted stock unit of
Holdco (each, a **"Parent Replacement RSU** ") covering the same number of
shares of Holdco Common Stock as the number of shares of Parent Common Stock
covered by such Parent RSU as of immediately prior to the Effective Time. Each
such Parent Replacement RSU shall have, and be subject to, substantially the
same terms and conditions that were applicable to the corresponding Parent RSU
immediately before the Effective Time (including, vesting, repurchase or other
applicable restrictions and any accrued dividend or dividend equivalent
rights). No Parent RSU shall become vested solely by reason of the execution
of this Agreement or the consummation of the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement.

 



 

(iii) Parent PSUs. As of the Effective Time, each performance stock unit
granted under any Parent Stock Plan representing the right of the holder
thereof to receive one share of Parent Common Stock (or, if applicable, cash
or a combination thereof), subject to performance-based vesting, performance-
based settlement or other applicable performance-based restrictions (each, a "
**Parent PSU** "), that is outstanding as of immediately prior to the
Effective Time shall, by virtue of the Parent Merger and without any action on
the part of the holder thereof, be automatically assumed by Holdco and shall
be converted at the Effective Time into a performance stock unit of Holdco
(each, a **"Parent Replacement PSU** ") covering the same number of shares of
Holdco Common Stock as the number of shares of Parent Common Stock covered by
such Parent PSU as of immediately prior to the Effective Time. Each such
Parent Replacement PSU shall have, and be subject to, substantially the same
terms and conditions that were applicable to the corresponding Parent PSU

transactions contemplated by this Agreement.

Common Stock granted under any Parent Stock Plan subject to vesting,
repurchase or other applicable restrictions (each, a " **Parent Restricted
Share**") that is outstanding as of immediately prior to the Effective Time
shall, by virtue of the Parent Merger and without any action on the part of
the holder thereof, be assumed by Holdco and shall be converted at the
Effective Time into one share of restricted Holdco Common Stock (each, a "
**Parent Replacement Restricted Share** "). Each such Parent Replacement
Restricted Share shall have, and be subject to, substantially the same terms
and conditions as were applicable to the corresponding Parent Restricted Share
immediately before the Effective Time (including, vesting, repurchase or other
applicable restrictions and any accrued dividend or dividend equivalent
rights). No Parent Restricted Share shall become vested solely by reason of
the execution of this Agreement or the consummation of the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement.

 



 

(v) Resolutions and Other Parent Actions. At or prior to the Effective Time,
Parent, the Parent Board, and the compensation committee of the Parent Board
shall adopt all resolutions and take all actions (including obtaining any

shares of Company Common Stock granted under the Company Stock Plan (each, a "
**Company Stock Option** ") that is outstanding as of immediately prior to the
Effective Time, whether or not then vested or exercisable, shall, by virtue of
the Rooster Merger and without any action on the part of the holder thereof,
be automatically assumed by Holdco and shall be converted at the Effective
Time into a fully vested and immediately exercisable option (each, a "
**Company Replacement Option** ") to acquire that number of whole shares of
Holdco Common Stock equal to the product (rounded down to the nearest whole
share) of (i) the number of shares of Company Common Stock subject to such
Company Stock Option as of immediately prior to the Effective Time and (ii)
the Common Exchange Ratio, at an exercise price per share of Holdco Common
Stock (rounded up to the nearest whole cent) equal to the quotient obtained by
dividing (A) the exercise price per share of Company Common Stock of such
Company Stock Option as of immediately prior to the Effective Time by (B) the
Common Exchange Ratio; _provided, that_ the exercise price and the number of
shares of Holdco Common Stock subject to the Company Replacement Option shall
be determined in a manner consistent with the requirements of Section 409A of
the Code. Each Replacement Option shall have, and shall be subject to, the
same terms and conditions as applied to the corresponding Company Stock Option
immediately prior to the Effective Time (including repurchase or other
applicable restrictions), with such revisions as Holdco in its good faith
discretion determines are necessary to reflect (i) the conversion of the
applicable Company Stock Option into a Company Replacement Option, (ii) the
fact that such Company Replacement Option is exercisable for shares of Holdco
Common Stock and (iii) the Rooster Merger.

 



 

(ii) Company RSUs. As of the Effective Time, each restricted stock unit
granted under the Company Stock Plan representing the right of the holder
thereof to receive one share of Company Common Stock (or, if applicable, cash

restricted stock unit of Holdco (each, a " **Company Replacement RSU** ")
covering that number of whole shares of Holdco Common Stock equal to the
product (rounded to the nearest whole number) of (i) one (1) and (ii) the
Common Exchange Ratio. Each such Replacement RSU shall have, and be subject
to, the same terms and conditions that were applicable to the corresponding
Company RSU immediately before the Effective Time (including, vesting,
repurchase or other applicable restrictions), with such revisions as Parent in
its good faith discretion determines are necessary to reflect (i) the
conversion of the applicable Company RSU into a Company Replacement RSU and
(ii) the Rooster Merger. No Company RSU shall become vested solely by reason
of the execution of this Agreement or the consummation of the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement.

Holdco Board, and the compensation committee of the Holdco Board, as
applicable, shall adopt all resolutions and take all actions (including
obtaining any consents and reserving for future issuance a number of shares of
Holdco Common Stock at least equal to the number of shares of Holdco Common
Stock that will be subject to

 



     

 

 



 

Replacement Awards as a result of the actions contemplated by the provisions

may be necessary to adopt one or more equity-based compensation plans of
Holdco pursuant to which the Replacement Awards may be granted as contemplated
by this _Section 2.03_. As soon as practicable after the Effective Time, if
and to the extent necessary to cause a sufficient number of shares of Holdco
Common Stock to be registered and issuable with respect to the Replacement
Awards, Holdco shall prepare and file with the SEC a registration statement on
Form S-8 (or any successor or other appropriate form) as soon as reasonably
practicable following the Closing with respect to the shares of Holdco Common
Stock subject to the Replacement Awards.

with both a record and payment date after the Effective Time and prior to the

Holdco Common Stock. Such cash and shares of Holdco Common Stock, together
with any dividends or other distributions deposited with the Exchange Agent

 _Section 2.05(a)_, are referred to collectively in this Agreement as the "
**Exchange Fund**." Holdco shall (and Parent shall cause Holdco to) instruct
the Exchange Agent to pay the Merger Consideration and the Parent Merger
Consideration out of the Exchange Fund in accordance with the terms of this
Agreement, and the Exchange Fund shall not be used for any purpose other than
a purpose expressly provided for in this Agreement. Holdco shall (and Parent
shall cause Holdco to) take all actions necessary to ensure that the Exchange
Fund includes at all times shares of Parent Common Stock and cash sufficient
to satisfy Parents obligation under this _Article II_.

 



 

(b) **_Procedures for Surrender; No Interest_**. As promptly as reasonable
practicable (but in no event more than ten (10) Business Days) following the
Effective Time, Holdco shall send, or shall cause the Exchange Agent to send,
to each record holder of shares of Company Common Stock, Company Series A
Preferred Stock or Parent Common Stock at the Effective Time, whose Company
Common Stock, Company Series A Preferred Stock or Parent Common Stock was

applicable, into the right to receive the Common Merger Consideration, the
Preferred Merger Consideration or the Parent Merger Consideration, as
applicable, (i) a notice advising such holders of the effectiveness of the
Mergers such other notice as may be required by the DGCL and (ii) a letter of
transmittal and instructions (which shall specify that the delivery shall be
effected, and risk of loss and title shall pass, only upon proper delivery of
the Certificates or transfer of the Book-Entry Shares to the Exchange Agent,
and which letter of transmittal will be in customary form approved by the
Company and have such other provisions as Holdco and the Surviving
Corporations may reasonably specify) for use in such exchange. Each holder of
shares of Company Common Stock, Company Series A Preferred Stock or Parent
Common Stock that have been converted into the right to receive the Common
Merger Consideration, the Preferred Merger Consideration or Parent Merger
Consideration, as applicable shall be entitled to receive as promptly as
practicable the Common Merger Consideration, Preferred Merger Consideration or
the Parent Merger Consideration, as applicable into which such shares of
Company Common Stock, Company Series A Preferred Stock or Parent Common Stock
have been converted pursuant to _Section 2.01(b)(ii)_ or _Section
2.01(a)(ii)_ in respect of the shares of Company Capital Stock or Parent
Common Stock represented by a Certificate, Book-Entry Share, Parent
Certificate or Parent Book-Entry Share, any cash in lieu of fractional shares
which the holder has the right to receive pursuant to _Section 2.01(b)(v)_,
and any dividends or other distributions pursuant to _Section 2.05(g)_ upon:
(i) surrender to the Exchange Agent of a Certificate or Parent Certificate, as
applicable; or (ii) receipt of an "agents message" by the Exchange Agent (or
such other evidence, if any, of transfer as the Exchange Agent may reasonably
request) in the case of Book-Entry Shares or Parent Book-Entry Shares, as
applicable; in each case, together with a duly completed and validly executed
letter of transmittal and such other documents as may reasonably be requested
by the Exchange Agent. No interest shall be paid or accrued upon the surrender
or transfer of any Certificate, Parent Certificate, Book-Entry Share or Parent
Book Entry Share. Upon payment of the Merger Consideration and the Parent
Merger Consideration pursuant to the provisions of this _Article II_, each
Certificate, Parent Certificate, Book-Entry Share or Parent Book-Entry Share
so surrendered or transferred, as the case may be, shall immediately be
cancelled by the Exchange Agent.

 



 

(c) **_Investment of Exchange Fund_**. Until disbursed in accordance with the
terms and conditions of this Agreement, the cash in the Exchange Fund will be
invested by the Exchange Agent, as directed by Holdco or the Surviving
Corporations. No losses with respect to any investments of the Exchange Fund
will affect the amounts payable to the holders of Certificates or Book-Entry
Shares. Any income from investment of the Exchange Fund will be payable to
Holdco or the Surviving Corporations, as Holdco directs. Any interest and
other income resulting from such deposit may become part of the Exchange Fund,
and any amounts in excess of the amounts payable pursuant to this Agreement
shall be promptly returned to Holdco.

 



     

 

 



 

(d) **_Payments to Non-Registered Holders_**. If any portion of the Merger
Consideration is to be paid to a Person other than the Person in whose name
the surrendered Certificate or Parent Certificate or the transferred Book-
Entry Share or Parent Book-Entry Share, as applicable, is registered, it shall
be a condition to such payment that: (i) such Certificate or Parent
Certificate shall be properly endorsed or shall otherwise be in proper form
for transfer or such Book-Entry Share or Parent Book-Entry Share shall be
properly transferred; and (ii) the Person requesting such payment shall pay to
the Exchange Agent any transfer or other Tax required as a result of such
payment to a Person other than the registered holder of such Certificate,
Parent Certificate, Book-Entry Share or Parent Book-Entry Share, as
applicable, or establish to the reasonable satisfaction of the Exchange Agent
that such Tax has been paid or is not payable.

 



 

(e) **_Full Satisfaction_**. All Merger Consideration and Parent Merger
Consideration, together with any cash in lieu of fractional shares payable
pursuant to _Section 2.01_(b)(v) and any dividends or other distributions
payable in accordance with _Section 2.05(g)_, paid upon the surrender of
Certificates or Parent Certificates or transfer of Book-Entry Shares or Parent
Book-Entry Shares in accordance with the terms hereof shall be deemed to have
been paid in full satisfaction of all rights pertaining to the shares of
Company Common Stock, Company Series A Preferred Stock or Parent Common Stock
formerly represented by such Certificates, Parent Certificates, Book-Entry
Shares or Parent Book-Entry Shares, and from and after the Effective Time,
there shall be no further registration of transfers of shares of Company
Common Stock, Company Series A Preferred Stock or Parent Common Stock on the

Entry Shares are presented to the Rooster Surviving Corporation or the Parent
Surviving Corporation, as applicable, they shall be cancelled and exchanged as
provided in this _Article II_.

 



 

(f) **_Termination of Exchange Fund_**. Any portion of the Exchange Fund that
remains undistributed to the holders of shares of Company Capital Stock or
Parent Common Stock for six (6) months after the Effective Time shall be
returned to Holdco, upon demand, and any such holder who has not exchanged
shares of Company Common Stock, Company Series A Preferred Stock or Parent
Common Stock for the Common Merger Consideration, Preferred Merger
Consideration or Parent Merger Consideration, as applicable, in accordance
with this _Section 2.05(f)_ prior to that time shall thereafter look only to
Holdco (subject to abandoned property, escheat, or other similar Laws), as
general creditors thereof, and Holdco shall remain liable for, payment of the
Merger Consideration and Parent Merger Consideration without any interest.
Notwithstanding the foregoing, neither Holdco, the Rooster Surviving
Corporation nor the Parent Surviving Corporation shall be liable to any Person
for any amounts paid to a public official pursuant to applicable abandoned
property, escheat, or similar Laws. Any amounts remaining unclaimed by Company
Common Stockholders, holders of Company Series A Preferred Stock or
stockholders of Parent as of immediately prior to such time when such amounts
would otherwise escheat to or become property of any Governmental Entity,
shall become, to the extent permitted by applicable Law, the property of
Holdco, free and clear of any claims or interest of any Person previously
entitled thereto.

 



 

(g) **_Distributions with Respect to Unsurrendered Shares of Company Capital
Stock_**. All shares of Holdco Common Stock to be issued pursuant to the
Mergers shall be deemed issued and outstanding in uncertificated, book-entry
form as of the Effective Time and whenever a dividend or other distribution is
declared by Holdco in respect of the Holdco Common Stock, the record date for
which is after the Effective Time, that declaration shall include dividends or
other distributions in respect of all shares issuable pursuant to this
Agreement. No dividends or other distributions in respect of the Holdco Common
Stock issued in the Mergers shall be paid to any holder of any unsurrendered
share of Company Capital Stock or Parent Common Stock until the Certificate or
Parent Certificate (or affidavit of loss in lieu of the Certificate or Parent
Certificate as provided in _Section 2.09)_ or Book-Entry Share or Parent
Book-Entry Share is surrendered for exchange in accordance with this _Section
2.05(g)_. Subject to the effect of applicable Laws, following such surrender,
there shall be issued or paid to the holder of record of the whole

 



     

 

 



 

shares of Holdco Common Stock issued in exchange for shares of Company Capital
Stock or Parent Common Stock in accordance with this _Section 2.05(g)_,
without interest: (i) at the time of such surrender, the dividends or other
distributions with a record date after the Effective Time theretofore payable
with respect to such whole shares of Holdco Common Stock and not paid; and
(ii) at the appropriate payment date, the dividends or other distributions
payable with respect to such whole shares of Holdco Common Stock with a record
date after the Effective Time but with a payment date subsequent to surrender.

 



 

 **Section 2.06.** **Appraisal Rights.** Notwithstanding any provision of
this Agreement to the contrary, including _Section 2.01_, shares of Company
Series A Preferred Stock issued and outstanding immediately prior to the
Effective Time (other than shares of Company Series A Preferred Stock
cancelled in accordance with _Section 2.01(b)(i)(2)_) and held by a holder
who is entitled to demand and has properly exercised appraisal rights of such
shares in accordance with Section 262 of the DGCL (such shares of Company
Series A Preferred Stock being referred to collectively as the "Dissenting
Shares" until such time as such holder fails to perfect or otherwise waives,
withdraws, or loses such holders appraisal rights under the DGCL with respect
to such shares) shall not be converted into a right to receive the Preferred
Merger Consideration, but instead shall be entitled to only such rights as are
granted by Section 262 of the DGCL; _provided, however,_ that if, after the
Effective Time, such holder fails to perfect, waives, withdraws, or loses such
holders right to appraisal pursuant to Section 262 of the DGCL or if a court
of competent jurisdiction shall determine that such holder is not entitled to
the relief provided by Section 262 of the DGCL, such shares of Company Series
A Preferred Stock shall be treated as if they had been converted as of the
Effective Time into the right to receive the Preferred Merger Consideration in
accordance with _Section 2.01(b)(ii)(2)_, without interest thereon, upon
surrender of such Certificate formerly representing such share or transfer of
such Book-Entry Share, as the case may be. The Company shall provide Parent
and Holdco prompt written notice of any demands received by the Company for
appraisal of shares of Company Series A Preferred Stock, any waiver or
withdrawal of any such demand, and any other demand, notice, or instrument
delivered to the Company prior to the Effective Time that relates to such
demand, and Parent and Holdco shall have the opportunity and right to direct
all negotiations and proceedings with respect to such demands. Except with the
prior written consent of Parent and Holdco, the Company shall not make any
payment with respect to, or settle, or offer to settle, any such demands.

 



 

 **Section 2.07.** **Adjustments**. Without limiting the other provisions of
this Agreement, if at any time during the period between the date of this
Agreement and the Effective Time, any change in the outstanding shares of
Company Capital Stock or any capital stock of Parent shall occur (specifically
excluding the issuance of additional shares of capital stock of the Company or
Parent as permitted by this Agreement, including _Section 5.02(c)_) by reason
of any reclassification, recapitalization, stock split (including a reverse
stock split), or combination, exchange, readjustment of shares, or similar
transaction, or any stock dividend or distribution paid in stock, the Common
Merger Consideration, the Preferred Merger Consideration and any other amounts
payable pursuant to this Agreement shall be appropriately adjusted to reflect
such change; _provided_ , _however_ , that this sentence shall not be
construed to permit Parent, Holdco or the Company to take any action with
respect to its securities that is prohibited by the terms of this Agreement.

 



 

 **Section 2.08.** **Withholding Rights**. Each of the Exchange Agent,
Parent, Holdco, Rooster Merger Sub, Parent Merger Sub, the Rooster Surviving
Corporation and the Parent Surviving Corporation shall be entitled to deduct
and withhold from the consideration otherwise payable to any Person pursuant
to this Agreement such amounts as may be required to be deducted and withheld
with respect to the making of such payment under any Tax Laws. To the extent
that amounts are so deducted and withheld by the Exchange Agent, Parent,
Holdco, Rooster Merger Sub, Parent Merger Sub, the Rooster Surviving
Corporation or the Parent Surviving Corporation, as the case may be, such
amounts shall be treated for all purposes of this Agreement as having been
paid to the Person in respect of which the Exchange Agent,

 



     

 

 



 

Parent, Holdco, Rooster Merger Sub, Parent Merger Sub, the Rooster Surviving
Corporation or the Parent Surviving Corporation, as the case may be, made such
deduction and withholding.

 



 

 **Section 2.09.** **Lost Certificates**. If any Certificate or Parent
Certificate shall have been lost, stolen, or destroyed, upon the making of an
affidavit of that fact by the Person claiming such Certificate or Parent
Certificate to be lost, stolen, or destroyed and, if required by Holdco, the
posting by such Person of a bond, in such reasonable amount as Holdco may
direct, as indemnity against any claim that may be made against it with
respect to such Certificate, the Exchange Agent will issue, in exchange for
such lost, stolen, or destroyed Certificate or Parent Certificate, the Merger
Consideration or Parent Merger Consideration, as applicable, to be paid in
respect of the shares of Company Common Stock, Company Series A Preferred
Stock or Parent Common Stock formerly represented by such Certificate as
contemplated under this _Article II_.

the other transactions contemplated by this Agreement; or

 



 

(h) agree, authorize or commit to do any of the foregoing.

 



 

 **Section 5.03.** **Access to Information; Confidentiality**.

 



 

(a) From the date of this Agreement until the earlier to occur of the
Effective Time or the termination of this Agreement in accordance with the
terms set forth in _Article VII_, the Company shall, and shall cause its
Subsidiaries and its Representatives to, afford to Parent and its
Representatives reasonable access, at reasonable times, upon reasonable
advance notice to all of its officers, employees, accountants, agents,
properties, offices, and other facilities and to all books, records,
contracts, and other assets, and the Company shall, and shall cause its
Subsidiaries and its Representatives to, furnish promptly to Parent such other
information concerning its business and properties as Parent may reasonably
request from time to time. No investigation shall affect the Companys
representations, warranties, covenants, or agreements contained herein, or
limit or otherwise affect the remedies available to Parent or Merger Sub
pursuant to this Agreement.

 



 

(b) Parent and the Company shall comply with, and shall cause their respective
Representatives to comply with, all of their respective obligations under the
Confidentiality Agreement, dated March 21, 2019, between Parent and the
Company (the " **Rooster Confidentiality Agreement** ") and the
Confidentiality Agreement, dated March 25, 2019, between Parent and the
Company (the " **Parent Confidentiality Agreement** " and, together with the
Rooster Confidentiality Agreement, the " **Confidentiality Agreements** "),
which shall survive the termination of this Agreement in accordance with the
terms set forth therein.

 



 

(c) This _Section 5.03_ shall not require the Company to permit any access,
or to disclose any information, that in the reasonable, good faith judgment
(after consultation with outside counsel) of the Company would reasonably be
expected to result in (i) any violation of any Law to which the Company or its
Subsidiaries is subject or cause any privilege (including attorney-client
privilege) which the Company or any of its Subsidiaries would be entitled to
assert to be undermined with respect to such information and such undermining
of such privilege could in the Companys good faith judgment (after
consultation with outside counsel) adversely affect in any material respect
the Companys position in any pending or, what the Company believes in good
faith (after consultation with outside counsel) would reasonably be expected
to be, a future Legal Action or (ii) if the Company and its Subsidiaries, on
the one hand, and Parent or any of its Subsidiaries, on the other hand, are
adverse parties in a Legal Action, such

 



     

 

 



 

information being reasonably pertinent thereto; _provided_ that the parties
shall use their reasonable best efforts to find a way to allow disclosure of
such information to the extent doing so (A) would not (in the good faith
belief of the Company (after consultation with outside counsel)) reasonably be
likely to result in the violation of any such Law or reasonably be likely to
cause such privilege to be undermined with respect to such information or (B)
would reasonably (in the good faith belief of the Company (after consultation
with outside counsel)) be managed through the use of customary " _clean-room_
" arrangements pursuant to which non-employee Representatives of Parent shall
be provided access to such information; _provided_ , _further_ , that the
Company shall (1) notify Parent that such disclosures are reasonably likely to
violate its or its Subsidiaries obligations under any such Law or are
reasonably likely to cause such privilege to be undermined, and (2)
communicate to Parent in reasonable detail the facts giving rise to such
notification and the subject matter of such information (to the extent it is
able to do so in accordance with the first proviso in this _Section
5.03(c)_).

 



 

 **Section 5.04.** **No Solicitation or Change in Recommendation.**

 



 

(a) Neither the Company, on the one hand, nor Parent, on the other hand,
shall, and each shall cause its Subsidiaries not to, and shall not authorize
or permit its or its Subsidiaries directors, officers, employees, investment
bankers, attorneys, accountants, consultants, or other agents or advisors
(with respect to any Person, the foregoing Persons are referred to herein as
such Persons " **Representatives** ") to, directly or indirectly, solicit,
initiate, or knowingly take any action to facilitate or encourage the
submission of any Takeover Proposal or the making of any proposal that would
reasonably be expected to lead to any Takeover Proposal, or, except in
accordance with this _Section 5.04_: (i) conduct or engage in any discussions
or negotiations with, disclose any non-public information relating to the
Company or Parent or any of their respective Subsidiaries to, afford access to
the business, properties, assets, books, or records of the Company or Parent
or any of their respective Subsidiaries to, or knowingly assist, participate
in, facilitate, or encourage any effort by, any third party that is seeking to
make, or has made, any Takeover Proposal; (ii) (A) except where the Company
Board or Parent Board, as applicable, makes a good faith determination, after
consultation with outside legal counsel, that the failure to do so would be
inconsistent with its fiduciary duties, amend or grant any waiver or release
under any standstill or similar agreement with respect to any class of equity
securities of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries, or (B) approve any
transaction under, or any third party becoming an "interested stockholder"
under, Section 203 of the DGCL; or (iii) enter into an Acquisition Agreement.
The Company, on the one hand, and Parent, on the other hand, shall and shall
cause their respective Subsidiaries to cease immediately and cause to be
terminated, and shall not authorize or knowingly permit any of its or their
Representatives to continue, any and all existing activities, discussions, or
negotiations, if any, with any third party conducted prior to the date of this
Agreement with respect to any Takeover Proposal and shall use its reasonable
best efforts to cause any such third party (or its agents or advisors) in
possession of non-public information in respect of the Company or Parent and
any of their respective Subsidiaries that was furnished by or on behalf the
Company or Parent, as applicable, or their respective Subsidiaries to return
or destroy (and confirm destruction of) all such information.

 



 

(b) Notwithstanding _Section 5.04(a)_, prior to the receipt of the Requisite
Company Vote, the Company Board, on the one hand, and prior to the receipt of
the Requisite Parent Vote, the Parent Board, on the other hand, directly or
indirectly through any Representative, may, subject to _Section 5.04(c)_: (i)
participate in negotiations or discussions with any third party that has made
(and not withdrawn) a bona fide, unsolicited Takeover Proposal in writing that
the Company Board or Parent Board, as applicable, believes in good faith,
after consultation with outside legal counsel and the Company Financial
Advisor or Parents financial advisor, as applicable, constitutes or would
reasonably be expected to result in a Superior Proposal; (ii) thereafter
furnish to such third party non-public information relating to such party or
any of its respective Subsidiaries pursuant to an executed confidentiality
agreement that constitutes an Acceptable Confidentiality Agreement (a copy of
which shall be provided for informational purposes to the other

 



     

 

 



 

party); (iii) following receipt of and on account of a Superior Proposal, make
a Company Adverse Recommendation Change or Parent Adverse Recommendation
Change, as applicable; or (iv) take any action that any court of competent
jurisdiction orders such party to take (which order remains unstayed), but in
each case referred to in the foregoing clauses (i) through (iv), only if the
Company Board or Parent Board, as applicable, determines in good faith, after
consultation with outside legal counsel, that the failure to take such action
would reasonably be expected to cause it to be in breach of its fiduciary
duties under applicable Law. Nothing contained herein shall prevent the
Company Board or Parent Board, as applicable, from disclosing to its
stockholders a position contemplated by Rule 14d-9 and Rule 14e-2(a)
promulgated under the Exchange Act with regard to a Takeover Proposal, if the
party determines, after consultation with outside legal counsel, that failure
to disclose such position would constitute a violation of applicable Law.

 



 

(c) The Company Board, on the one hand, and the Parent Board, on the other
hand, shall not take any of the actions referred to in clauses (i) through
(iv) of _Section 5.04(b)_ unless such party shall have delivered to the other
party a prior written notice advising the other party that it intends to take
such action. The Company, on the one hand, and Parent, on the other hand,
shall notify the other party promptly (but in no event later than twenty-four
(24) hours) after it obtains Knowledge of the receipt by such party (or any of
its Representatives) of any Takeover Proposal, any inquiry that would
reasonably be expected to lead to a Takeover Proposal, any request for non-
public information in contemplation of a Takeover Proposal relating to such
party or any of its Subsidiaries. In such notice, such party shall identify
the third party making, and details of the material terms and conditions of,
any such Takeover Proposal, indication or request. Such party shall thereafter
keep the other party fully informed, on a current basis (and, in any event,
within twenty-four (24) hours), of the status and material terms of any such
Takeover Proposal, indication or request, including any material amendments or
proposed amendments as to price and other material terms thereof. Such party
shall promptly provide the other party with copies of any non-public
information concerning the disclosing partys or any of its Subsidiaries
business, present or future performance, financial condition, or results of
operations, provided to any third party, and, to the extent such information
has not been previously provided to such party.

 



 

(d) Except as expressly permitted by this _Section 5.04_, neither the Company
Board shall effect a Company Adverse Recommendation Change, nor shall the
Parent Board effect a Parent Adverse Recommendation Change; or, in either
case, enter into (or permit any of its Subsidiaries to enter into) an
Acquisition Agreement. Notwithstanding the foregoing, at any time prior to the
receipt of: (i) the Requisite Company Vote, the Company Board may effect a
Company Adverse Recommendation Change or enter into (or permit any Subsidiary
to enter into) an Acquisition Agreement; and (ii) the Requisite Parent Vote,
the Parent Board may effect a Parent Adverse Recommendation Change or enter
into (or permit any Subsidiary to enter into) an Acquisition Agreement, if (A)
such party promptly notifies the other party, in writing, at least four (4)
Business Days (the " **Superior Proposal Notice Period** ") before making a
Company Adverse Recommendation Change or Parent Adverse Recommendation Change,
as applicable, or entering into (or causing one of its Subsidiaries to enter
into) an Acquisition Agreement, of its intention to take such action with
respect to a Superior Proposal, which notice shall state expressly that such
party has received a Takeover Proposal that such partys board of directors
(or a committee thereof) intends to declare a Superior Proposal and that it
intends to effect a Company Adverse Recommendation Change or Parent Adverse
Recommendation Change, as applicable, and/or such party intends to enter into
an Acquisition Agreement, (B) such party attaches to such notice the most
current version of the proposed agreement (which version shall be updated on a
prompt basis) and the identity of the third party making such Superior
Proposal, (C) such party shall, and shall cause its Representatives to, during
the Superior Proposal Notice Period, negotiate with the other party in good
faith to make such adjustments in the terms and conditions of this Agreement
so that such Takeover Proposal ceases to constitute a Superior Proposal, if
the other party, in its discretion, proposes to make such adjustments (it
being agreed that in the event that, after commencement of the Superior
Proposal Notice Period, there is any material revision to the terms of a
Superior Proposal, including, any revision in price, the Superior Proposal
Notice Period shall be extended,

 



     

 

 



 

if applicable, to ensure that at least two (2) Business Day remains in the
Superior Proposal Notice Period subsequent to the time such party notifies the
other party of any such material revision (it being understood that there may
be multiple extensions)), and (D) such partys board of directors (or a
committee thereof) determines in good faith, after consulting with outside
legal counsel and its financial advisor, that such Takeover Proposal continues
to constitute a Superior Proposal after taking into account any adjustments
made by the other party during the Superior Proposal Notice Period in the
terms and conditions of this Agreement.

 



 

(e) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in the foregoing, in response to
an Intervening Event that has occurred after the date of this Agreement: (i)
but, in the case of the Company, prior to the receipt of the Requisite Company
Vote, the Company Board may effect a Company Adverse Recommendation Change;
and (ii) but, in the case of Parent, prior to the receipt of the Requisite
Parent Vote, Parent may effect a Parent Adverse Recommendation Change; in each
case, if (A) prior to effecting the Company Adverse Recommendation Change or
Parent Adverse Recommendation Change, as applicable, such party promptly
notifies the other party, in writing, at least four (4) Business Days (the "
**Intervening Event Notice Period** ") before taking such action of its intent
to consider such action (which notice shall not, by itself, constitute a
Company Adverse Recommendation Change or Parent Adverse Recommendation Change,
as applicable), and which notice shall include a reasonably detailed
description of the underlying facts giving rise to, and the reasons for
taking, such action, (B) such party shall, and shall cause its Representatives
to, during the Intervening Event Notice Period, negotiate with the other party
in good faith to make such adjustments in the terms and conditions of this
Agreement so that the underlying facts giving rise to, and the reasons for
taking such action, ceases to constitute an Intervening Event, if the other
party, in its discretion, proposes to make such adjustments (it being agreed
that in the event that, after commencement of the Intervening Event Notice
Period, there is any material development in an Intervening Event, the
Intervening Event Notice Period shall be extended, if applicable, to ensure
that at least four (4) Business Days remains in the Intervening Event Notice
Period subsequent to the time such party notifies the other party of any such
material development (it being understood that there may be multiple
extensions)), and (C) such partys board of directors (or a committee thereof)
determines in good faith, after consulting with outside legal counsel, that
the failure to effect such Company Adverse Recommendation Change or Parent
Adverse Recommendation Change, as applicable, after taking into account any
adjustments made by the other party during the Intervening Event Notice
Period, would continue to constitute a breach of its fiduciary duties under
applicable Law. The parties acknowledge and hereby agree that (1) any Company
Adverse Recommendation Change or Parent Adverse Recommendation Change effected
(or proposed to be effected) in response to or in connection with any Takeover
Proposal may be made solely and exclusively pursuant to _Section 5.04(d)_
only, and may not be made pursuant to this _Section 5.04(e)_, and (2) any
Company Adverse Recommendation Change or Parent Adverse Recommendation Change,
as applicable, may only be made pursuant to this _Section 5.04_ and no other
provisions of this Agreement.

 



 

 **Section 5.05.** **Preparation of Joint Proxy Statement and Form S-4.**

 



 

(a) In connection with the Company Stockholders Meeting and Parent
Stockholders Meeting, as soon as reasonably practicable following the date of
this Agreement, the Company and Parent shall prepare and file with the SEC the
Joint Proxy Statement and Parent shall prepare and file with the SEC the Form
S-4 (which shall include the Joint Proxy Statement as a prospectus). The
Company and Parent shall each use its reasonable best efforts to: (i) cause
the Form S-4 to be declared effective under the Securities Act as promptly as
practicable after its filing; (ii) ensure that the Form S-4 complies in all
material respects with the applicable provisions of the Securities Act and the
Exchange Act; and (iii) keep the Form S-4 effective for so long as necessary
to complete the Mergers. Parent shall notify the Company promptly of the time
when the Form S-4 has become effective or any supplement or amendment to the
Form S-4 has been filed, and of the issuance of any stop order or suspension
of the qualification of the shares of Parent

 



     

 

 



 

Common Stock issuable in connection with the Mergers for offering or sale in
any jurisdiction. Each of Parent and the Company shall use its reasonable best
efforts to: (A) cause the Joint Proxy Statement to be mailed to the Company
Common Stockholders and holders of Parent Common Stock as promptly as
practicable after the Form S-4 is declared effective under the Securities Act,
and (B) ensure that the Joint Proxy Statement complies in all material
respects with the applicable provisions of the Securities Act and Exchange
Act. Parent shall also take any other action (other than qualifying to do
business in any jurisdiction in which it is not now so qualified) required to
be taken under the Securities Act, the Exchange Act, any applicable foreign or
state securities or "blue sky" Laws, and the rules and regulations thereunder
in connection with the Holdco Stock Issuance in the Mergers, and the Company
shall furnish to Parent all information concerning the Company as may be
reasonably requested in connection with any such actions.

 



 

(b) Parent and the Company shall furnish to the other party all information
concerning such Person and its Affiliates required by the Securities Act or
the Exchange Act to be set forth in the Form S-4 or the Joint Proxy Statement.
Each of Parent and the Company shall promptly correct any information provided
by it for use in the Form S-4 or the Joint Proxy Statement if and to the
extent that such information shall have become false or misleading in any
material respect, and the party which discovers such information shall
promptly notify the other party describing such false or misleading
information. Each of Parent and the Company shall take all steps necessary to
amend or supplement the Form S-4 or the Joint Proxy Statement, as applicable,
and to cause the Form S-4 or Joint Proxy Statement, as so amended or
supplemented, to be filed with the SEC and disseminated to the Company Common
Stockholders or holders of Parent Common Stock, in each case as and to the
extent required by applicable Law. The Company shall cooperate with Parent in
good faith to update the historical financial information of the Company and
its Subsidiaries to comply with Accounting Standards Codification 606 (Revenue
from Contracts with Customers) and Accounting Standards Codification 842
(Leases), as necessary, for inclusion in the Form S-4 or any other SEC filings
required to be made by Parent, and shall provide Parent with reasonable access
to all books and records of the Company and its Subsidiaries reasonably
necessary to make such updates.

 



 

(c) Parent and the Company shall promptly provide the other party and their
counsel with any comments or other communications, whether written or oral,
that Parent or the Company, or their counsel may receive from the SEC or its
staff with respect to the Form S-4 or the Joint Proxy Statement promptly after
the receipt of such comments. The parties shall supply each other with copies
of all correspondence between it or any of its Representatives, on the one
hand, and the SEC or its staff, on the other hand, with respect to the Form
S-4 or the Joint Proxy Statement. Prior to the filing of the Form S-4 or the
Joint Proxy Statement with the SEC (including in each case any amendment or
supplement thereto, except with respect to any amendments filed in connection
with a Company Adverse Recommendation Change or Parent Adverse Recommendation
Change or in connection with any disclosures made in compliance with _Section
5.04_) or the dissemination thereof to the Company Common Stockholders or
holders of Parent Common Stock, or responding to any comments of the SEC with
respect to the Form S-4 or Joint Proxy Statement, each of Parent and the
Company shall provide the other party and their counsel a reasonable
opportunity to review and comment on such Form S-4, Joint Proxy Statement, or
response (including the proposed final version thereof), and each of Parent
and the Company shall give reasonable and good faith consideration to any
comments made by the other party or their counsel.

 



 

 **Section 5.06.** **Company Stockholders Meeting**. The Company shall take
all action necessary in accordance with its Governing Documents and applicable
Law to duly call, give notice of, convene, and hold the Company Stockholders
Meeting as soon as reasonably practicable after the Form S-4 is declared
effective, and, in connection therewith, the Company shall mail the Joint
Proxy Statement to the Company Common Stockholders in advance of such meeting.
Except to the extent that the Company Board shall have effected a Company
Adverse Recommendation Change in accordance with _Section 5.04_ hereof, the
Joint Proxy Statement shall include the Company Board Recommendation. Subject
to _Section 5.04_ hereof, the Company shall use its reasonable best efforts
to: (a) solicit from the Company Common Stockholders

 



     

 

 



 

proxies in favor of the adoption of this Agreement and approval of the Merger;
and (b) secure the vote or consent of the Company Common Stockholders required
by NYSE, the DGCL or other applicable Law to obtain such approval. The Company
shall keep Parent reasonably updated with respect to proxy solicitation
results as reasonably requested by Parent. Once the Company Stockholders
Meeting has been called and noticed, the Company shall not postpone or adjourn
the Company Stockholders Meeting without the consent of Parent (other than:
(i) in order to obtain a quorum of its stockholders present or represented by
a proxy at the Company Stockholders Meeting; or (ii) as reasonably determined
by the Company to comply with applicable Law). The Company shall use its
reasonable best efforts to cooperate with Parent to hold the Company
Stockholders Meeting on the same day and at the same time as the Parent
Stockholders Meeting as soon as reasonably practicable after the date of this
Agreement, and to set the same record date for each such meeting. If the
Company Board makes a Company Adverse Recommendation Change, it will not alter
the obligation of the Company to submit the adoption of this Agreement to the
Company Common Stockholders at the Company Stockholders Meeting to consider
and vote upon, unless this Agreement shall have been terminated in accordance
with the terms set forth in _Article VII_ prior to the Company Stockholders
Meeting.

Stockholder of Holdco; Approval by the Sole Stockholder of Rooster Merger Sub
and Parent Merger Sub.**

 



 

(a) Parent shall take all action necessary in accordance with its Governing
Documents and applicable Law to duly call, give notice of, convene, and hold
the Parent Stockholders Meeting as soon as reasonably practicable after the
Form S-4 is declared effective, and, in connection therewith, Parent shall
mail the Joint Proxy Statement to the holders of Parent Common Stock in
advance of the Parent Stockholders Meeting. Except to the extent that the
Parent Board shall have effected a Parent Adverse Recommendation Change in
accordance with _Section 5.04_ hereof, the Joint Proxy Statement shall
include the Parent Board Recommendation. Subject to _Section 5.04_ hereof,
Parent shall use reasonable best efforts to: (i) solicit from the holders of
Parent Common Stock proxies in favor of the approval of the Parent Merger,
Holdco Stock Issuance and the Holdco Charter Amendment; and (ii) secure the
vote or consent of the holders of Parent Common Stock required by Nasdaq, the
DGCL or other applicable Law to obtain such approvals. Parent shall keep the
Company reasonably updated with respect to proxy solicitation results as
reasonably requested by the Company. Once the Parent Stockholders Meeting has
been called and noticed, Parent shall not postpone or adjourn the Parent

retiree welfare plans or programs maintained by Parent or any of its
Subsidiaries, any defined benefit retirement plans or programs maintained by
Parent or any of its Subsidiaries, and any equity or equity-based compensation

(i) such crediting would result in a duplication of benefits; or (ii) such
service was not credited under the corresponding Company Employee Plan.

 



 

(c) Effective no later than the day immediately preceding the Closing Date,

(d) This _Section 5.09_ shall be binding upon and inure solely to the benefit
of each of the parties to this Agreement, and nothing in this _Section 5.09_,
express or implied, shall confer upon any Company Employee, any Company

 **Section 5.10.** **Directors  and Officers Indemnification and
Insurance.**

 



 

(a) Parent, Holdco, Rooster Merger Sub and Parent Merger Sub agree that all
rights to indemnification, advancement of expenses, and exculpation by the
Company now existing in favor of each Person who is now, or has been at any
time prior to the date of this Agreement or who becomes prior to the Effective
Time an officer or director of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries (each an
" **Indemnified Party** ") as provided in the Governing Documents of the
Company, in each case as in effect on the date of this Agreement, or pursuant
to any other Contracts in effect on the date of this Agreement and disclosed
in

 



     

 

 



 

 _Section 5.10_ of the Company Disclosure Letter, including provisions
relating to the advancement of expenses incurred in the defense of any Legal
Action, shall be assumed by the Rooster Surviving Corporation in the Rooster
Merger, without further action, at the Effective Time and shall survive the
Rooster Mergers and shall remain in full force and effect in accordance with
their terms. For a period of six (6) years from the Effective Time, the
Rooster Surviving Corporation shall, and Holdco and the Parent Surviving
Corporation shall cause the Rooster Surviving Corporation to, maintain in
effect the exculpation, indemnification, and advancement of expenses
equivalent to the provisions of the Governing Documents of the Company as in
effect immediately prior to the Effective Time with respect to acts or
omissions by any Indemnified Party occurring prior to the Effective Time, and
shall not amend, repeal, or otherwise modify any such provisions in any manner
that would adversely affect the rights thereunder of any Indemnified Party;
_provided_ that all rights to indemnification in respect of any claim made for
indemnification within such period shall continue until the disposition of
such action or resolution of such claim. During such period, Holdco shall
guarantee the obligations of the Rooster Surviving Corporation with respect to
any and all amounts payable under this _Section 5.10_.

 



 

(b) The Rooster Surviving Corporation shall, and Holdco and the Parent
Surviving Corporation shall each cause the Rooster Surviving Corporation to
obtain as of the Effective Time "tail" officers and directors insurance
policies, which by its terms shall survive the Mergers and shall provide each
Indemnified Party with coverage for not less than six (6) years from the
Effective Time with at least the same coverage and amounts and containing
terms and conditions that are not less advantageous to the Indemnified Parties
than the terms of the directors and officers liability insurance policy
currently maintained by the Company, in each case with respect to claims
arising out of or relating to events which occurred before or at the Effective
Time (including in connection with the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement); _provided_ , _however_ , that in no event will the Rooster
Surviving Corporation be required to expend an annual premium for such
coverage in excess of three hundred percent (300%) of the last annual premium
paid by the Company or any of its Subsidiaries for such insurance prior to the
date of this Agreement, which amount is set forth in _Section 5.10(b)_ of the
Company Disclosure Letter (the " **Maximum Premium** "). If such insurance
coverage cannot be obtained at an annual premium equal to or less than the
Maximum Premium, the Rooster Surviving Corporation will obtain, and Holdco and
the Parent Surviving Corporation shall each cause the Rooster Surviving
Corporation to obtain, the greatest coverage available for a cost not
exceeding an annual premium equal to the Maximum Premium.

 



 

(c) The obligations of Parent, Holdco, Rooster Merger Sub, Parent Merger Sub,
the Rooster Surviving Corporation and the Parent Surviving Corporation under
this _Section 5.10_ shall survive the consummation of the Mergers and shall
not be terminated or modified in such a manner as to adversely affect any
Indemnified Party to whom this _Section 5.10_ applies without the consent of
such affected Indemnified Party (it being expressly agreed that the
Indemnified Parties to whom this _Section 5.10_ applies shall be third party
beneficiaries of this _Section 5.10_, each of whom may enforce the provisions
of this _Section 5.10_).

 



 

(d) In the event Holdco, Parent, the Rooster Surviving Corporation, or any of
their respective successors or assigns: (i) consolidates with or merges into
any other Person and shall not be the continuing or surviving corporation or
entity in such consolidation or merger; or (ii) transfers all or substantially
all of its properties and assets to any Person, then, and in either such case,
proper provision shall be made so that the successors and assigns of Holdco,
Parent or the Rooster Surviving Corporation, as the case may be, shall assume
all of the obligations set forth in this Section 5.10. The agreements and
covenants contained herein shall not be deemed to be exclusive of any other
rights to which any Indemnified Party is entitled, whether pursuant to Law,
Contract, or otherwise. Nothing in this Agreement is intended to, shall be
construed to, or shall release, waive, or impair any rights to directors and
officers insurance claims under any policy that is or has been in existence
with respect to the Company or its officers, directors,

 



     

 

 



 

and employees, it being understood and agreed that the indemnification
provided for in this _Section 5.10_ is not prior to, or in substitution for,
any such claims under any such policies.

 



 

 **Section 5.11.** **Reasonable Best Efforts.**

 



 

(a) Upon the terms and subject to the conditions and limitations set forth in
this Agreement (including those contained in this _Section 5.11_), each of
the parties hereto shall, and shall cause its Subsidiaries to, use its
reasonable best efforts to take, or cause to be taken, all actions, and to do,
or cause to be done, and to assist and cooperate with the other parties in
doing, all things necessary, proper, or advisable to consummate and make
effective, and to satisfy all conditions to, in the most expeditious manner
practicable, the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, including: (i)
the obtaining of all necessary Permits, waivers, and actions or nonactions
from Governmental Entities and the making of all necessary registrations and
filings (including filings with Governmental Entities) and the taking of all
steps as may be necessary to obtain an approval or waiver from, or to avoid an
action or proceeding by, any Governmental Entities; (ii) the obtaining of all
necessary consents or waivers from third parties; and (iii) the execution and
delivery of any additional instruments necessary to consummate the Mergers and
to fully carry out the purposes of this Agreement. The Company and Parent
shall, subject to applicable Law, promptly: (A) cooperate and coordinate with
the other in the taking of the actions contemplated by clauses (i), (ii),
(iii) and (iv) immediately above; and (B) supply the other with any
information that may be reasonably required in order to effectuate the taking
of such actions. Each party hereto shall promptly inform the other party or
parties hereto, as the case may be, of any communication from any Governmental
Entity regarding any of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement. If
the Company, on the one hand, or Parent, Holdco, Rooster Merger Sub or Parent
Merger Sub, on the other hand, receives a request for additional information
or documentary material from any Governmental Entity with respect to the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement, then it shall make, or cause to
be made, as soon as reasonably practicable and after consultation with the
other party (including considering the other partys comments in good faith),
an appropriate response in compliance with such request, and, if permitted by
applicable Law, provide the other partys counsel with advance notice and the
opportunity to attend and participate in any meeting with any Governmental
Entity in respect of any filing made thereto in connection with the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement. Notwithstanding the foregoing,
each party has the right to redact or otherwise exclude the other party from
receiving any confidential competitively sensitive information required to be
shared under this _Section 5.11_; _provided_ that such other partys external
counsel shall be entitled to receive such confidential competitively sensitive
information on an external counsel basis only. Neither Parent nor the Company
shall commit to or agree (or permit any of their respective Subsidiaries to
commit to or agree) with any Governmental Entity to stay, toll, or extend any
applicable waiting period under the HSR Act or other applicable Antitrust
Laws, without the prior written consent of the other (such consent not to be
unreasonably withheld, conditioned, or delayed).

 



 

(b) Without limiting the generality of the undertakings pursuant to _Section
5.11(a)_ hereof, the parties hereto shall: (i) provide or cause to be provided
as promptly as reasonably practicable to Governmental Entities with
jurisdiction over the Antitrust Laws information and documents requested by
any such Governmental Entity as necessary, proper, or advisable to permit
consummation of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, including
preparing and filing any notification and report form and related material
required under the HSR Act and any additional consents and filings under any
other Antitrust Laws as promptly as practicable following the date of this
Agreement ( _provided_ , that in the case of the filing under the HSR Act,
such filing shall be made within ten (10) Business Days of the date of this
Agreement) and thereafter to respond as promptly as practicable to any request
for additional information or documentary material that may be made under the
HSR Act or any other applicable Antitrust Laws; and (ii) subject to the terms
set forth in _Section 5.11(b)_ hereof, take such actions as are necessary or
advisable to obtain prompt approval of the consummation of the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement by any Governmental Entity or expiration of
applicable waiting periods.

 



     

 

 



 

(c) In the event that any administrative or judicial action or proceeding is
instituted (or threatened to be instituted) by a Governmental Entity or
private party challenging the Mergers, the Holdco Stock Issuance, the Holdco
Charter Amendment or any other transaction contemplated by this Agreement, or
any other agreement contemplated hereby, or any other temporary or permanent
injunction which could delay or prevent the Closing, the parties shall use
their reasonable best efforts to resist, at their respective cost and expense,
any such action or proceeding and to have vacated, lifted, reversed, or
overturned any Order, whether temporary, preliminary, or permanent, that is in
effect and that prohibits, prevents, delays or restricts consummation of the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement. Notwithstanding the foregoing,
Parent shall have the sole right to devise and implement the strategy for
obtaining any necessary clearance or approval, for responding to any request,
inquiry, or investigation, for defending any lawsuit challenging the Mergers,
the Holdco Stock Issuance, the Holdco Charter Amendment or any other
transaction contemplated by this Agreement, and for leading all meetings and
communications with any Governmental Entity that has authority to enforce the
Antitrust Laws; _provided, however_ , that Parent shall consult with the
Company and consider in good faith views expressed by the Company and its
Representatives concerning the foregoing.

 



 

(d) Without limiting the generality of Parents undertakings pursuant to this
_Section 5.11_, but subject to _Section 5.11(e)_, Parent agrees to use its
reasonable best efforts including by taking any and all steps necessary to
avoid or eliminate each and every impediment under any Antitrust Law that may
be asserted by any Governmental Entity or any other Person so as to enable the
parties to consummate the transactions contemplated by this Agreement as
promptly as possible, including proposing, negotiating, committing to and
effecting, by consent decree, order, hold separate orders, or otherwise the
sale, divestiture or disposition of any of its assets, properties or
businesses or of the assets, properties or businesses to be acquired by it
pursuant to this Agreement as are required to be divested in order to avoid
the entry of, or to effect the dissolution of, any injunction, temporary
restraining order or other Order in any suit or proceeding, which would
otherwise have the effect of materially delaying or preventing the
consummation of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement. In addition,
Parent shall use its reasonable best efforts including by defending through
Legal Action on the merits any claim asserted in any Governmental Entity by
any party in order to avoid entry of, or to have vacated or terminated, any
Order (whether temporary, preliminary or permanent) that would prevent the
consummation of the Closing.

 



 

(e) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this Agreement,
including _Section 5.11(d)_, nothing in this Agreement shall require Parent
to take any action that will require, or be deemed to require, Parent or the
Company to take any action that would reasonably be expected to have or result
in a "Material Adverse Impact," including but not limited to any Material
Adverse Impact that would result from (i) disposing or transferring any asset,
including those of Parent or the Company; (ii) licensing or otherwise making
available to any Person, any technology or other Intellectual Property of
Parent or the Company; (iii) holding separate any assets or operations (either
before or after the Closing Date) of Parent or the Company; or (iv) changing
or modifying any course of conduct or otherwise making any commitment (to any
Governmental Entity or otherwise) regarding future operations of Parent or the
Companys business to obtain any approval or clearance from any Governmental
Entity or to prevent the initiation of any Legal Action by any Governmental
Entity under any Antitrust Law or to prevent the entry of any decree,
judgment, injunction (preliminary or permanent), or any order that would
otherwise make the Agreement, Merger, or any contingent agreements unlawful. "
** _Material Adverse Impact_** " means any material reduction in the value
(including any reasonably anticipated economic benefit to be received by
Holdco and its Subsidiaries, taken as a whole), measured either individually
or in the aggregate of Parent, the Company and the combined business, expected
from the Mergers.

 



 

 **Section 5.12.** **Public Announcements**. The initial press release with
respect to this Agreement and the transactions contemplated hereby shall be a
release mutually agreed to by the Company and Parent. Thereafter, each of the
Company, Parent, Holdco, Rooster Merger Sub and Parent Merger Sub agrees that

 



     

 

 



 

no public release or announcement concerning the transactions contemplated
hereby shall be issued by any party without the prior written consent of the
Company and Parent (which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld,
conditioned, or delayed), except as may be required by applicable Law or the
rules or regulations of any applicable United States securities exchange or
other Governmental Entity to which the relevant party is subject or submits,
in which case the party required to make the release or announcement shall use
its reasonable best efforts to allow the other party reasonable time to
comment on such release or announcement in advance of such issuance.
Notwithstanding the foregoing, the restrictions set forth in this _Section
5.12_ shall not apply to any release or announcement made or proposed to be
made in connection with and related to: (a) a Company Adverse Recommendation
Change, (b) a Parent Adverse Recommendation Change; or (c) any disclosures
made in compliance with _Section 5.04_.

 



 

 **Section 5.13.** **Anti-Takeover Statutes**. If any "control share
acquisition," "fair price," "moratorium," or other anti-takeover Law becomes
or is deemed to be applicable to Parent, Holdco, the Rooster Merger Sub,
Parent Merger Sub, the Company, the Mergers, or any other transaction
contemplated by this Agreement, then each of the Company and the Company Board
on the one hand, and each of Parent, Holdco, the Parent Board and the Holdco
Board on the other hand, shall grant such approvals and take such actions as
are necessary so that the transactions contemplated hereby may be consummated
as promptly as practicable on the terms contemplated hereby and otherwise act
to render such anti-takeover Law inapplicable to the foregoing.

 



 

 **Section 5.14.** **Section 16 Matters**. Prior to the Effective Time, the
Company, Parent, Holdco, Rooster Merger Sub and Parent Merger Sub shall each
take all such steps as may be required to cause to be exempt under Rule 16b-3
promulgated under the Exchange Act:

 



 

(a) any dispositions of shares of Company Capital Stock (including derivative
securities with respect to such shares) and Parent Common Stock (including
derivative securities with respect to such shares) that are treated as
dispositions under such rule and result from the transactions contemplated by
this Agreement by each director (including any Person that may be deemed a
director by deputization) or officer of the Company who is subject to the
reporting requirements of Section 16(a) of the Exchange Act with respect to
the Company or Parent, as applicable, immediately prior to the Effective Time;
and

 



 

(b) any acquisitions of Holdco Common Stock (including derivative securities

immediately after the Effective Time.

 



 

 **Section 5.15.** **Stock Exchange Matters**.

 



 

(a) Holdco, Parent and the Company shall use their reasonable best efforts to
take, or cause to be taken, all actions, and do or cause to be done all
things, necessary to cause the shares of Holdco Common Stock to be issued in
connection with the Mergers (including shares of Holdco Common Stock to be
reserved for issuance upon exercise of Holdco Stock Options or Warrants to be
issued pursuant to _Section 2.03(a)_ and _Section 2.04_, respectively) to be
listed on Nasdaq (or such other stock exchange as may be mutually agreed upon
by the Company and Parent), subject to official notice of issuance, prior to
the Effective Time.

 



 

(b) To the extent requested by Parent, prior to the Effective Time, the
Company shall cooperate with Parent and use its reasonable best efforts to
take, or cause to be taken, all actions, and do or cause to be done all
things, reasonably necessary, proper or advisable on its part under applicable
Laws and

 



     

 

 



 

the rules and policies of the NYSE to enable the delisting by the Rooster
Surviving Corporation of the shares of Company Common Stock from the NYSE, the
delisting by the Rooster Surviving Corporation of the Warrants from the NYSE
and the deregistration of the shares of Company Common Stock under the
Exchange Act as promptly as practicable after the Effective Time, and in any
event no more than ten (10) days after the Effective Time.

 



 

 **Section 5.16.** **Certain Tax Matters**. The parties to this Agreement
shall cooperate and use their respective reasonable best efforts to obtain the
Parent Tax Opinion, the Company Tax Opinion and any Tax opinions required to
be filed with the SEC in connection with the filing of the Form S-4 or any
other filings with the SEC, including (a) delivering to the applicable counsel
representation letters necessary or appropriate to enable applicable counsel

 **Section 5.17.** **Financing Matters.**

 



 

(a) Parent will use its reasonable best efforts to arrange and obtain the Debt
Financing, if necessary, at or prior to the Closing on the terms and
conditions described in the Debt Commitment Letter, and, without the Companys
prior written consent, will not permit any amendment or modification to be
made to, or any waiver of any provision or remedy under, the Debt Commitment
Letter if such amendment, modification or waiver would (i) reduce the
aggregate amount of the Debt Financing as provided in the Debt Commitment
Letter below the Required Amount, or (ii) impose new or additional conditions,
or otherwise amend, modify or expand any conditions, in each case, to the
receipt by Parent at or prior to the closing of the Debt Financing; _provided_
, _however_ , that Parent, Holdco, Rooster Merger Sub and Parent Merger Sub
may (x) amend the Debt Commitment Letter to add creditworthy lenders, lead
arrangers, bookrunners, syndication agents or similar entities who had not
executed the Debt Commitment Letter as of the date of this Agreement if the
addition of such parties, individually or in the aggregate, would not
reasonably be expected to delay or prevent the consummation of the Debt
Financing or the Closing or (y) otherwise amend or replace the Debt Commitment
Letter so long as (A) such amendment does not impose terms or conditions that
would reasonably be expected to delay or prevent the Closing, (B) the terms do
not reduce the aggregate amount of the Debt Financing as provided in the Debt
Commitment Letter below the Required Amount and (C) with respect to
replacements, the replacement debt commitments otherwise satisfy the terms and
conditions of Alternative Financing set forth below. In the event of such
amendment or replacement of the Debt Commitment Letter as permitted by the
proviso to the immediately preceding sentence, the financing under such
amended or replaced Debt Commitment Letter will be deemed to be "Debt
Financing" as such term is used in this Agreement. Parent shall promptly
notify the Company if, at any time prior to the Closing Date, (i) the Debt
Commitment Letter shall expire or be terminated for any reason, (ii) any
Financing Source that is a party to the Debt Commitment Letter notifies Parent
that such source no longer intends to provide financing to Parent or that
Parent is in breach thereof or (iii) for any reason Parent no longer believes
in good faith that it will be able to obtain an aggregate amount of the Debt
Financing as provided in the Debt Commitment Letter of at least the Required
Amount. Parent will use its reasonable best efforts to (i) maintain in effect
the Debt Commitment Letter (including any definitive agreements entered into
in connection therewith), (ii) satisfy when required by the Debt Commitment
Letter as in effect on the date of this Agreement all conditions in the Debt
Commitment Letter applicable to Parent, Holdco, Rooster Merger Sub and Parent
Merger Sub to obtaining the Debt Financing at or prior to the Closing, (iii)
negotiate and enter into definitive agreements with respect to the Debt
Commitment Letter on terms and conditions consistent in all material respects
with the Debt Commitment Letter (as such terms and conditions may be modified
or adjusted in accordance with the terms hereof and thereof and within the

 



     

 

 



 

limits of the "market flex" provisions set forth in the Fee Letters) at or
prior to the Closing (such definitive agreements, together with the Debt
Commitment Letter, the " **Financing Agreements** "), (iv) upon satisfaction
of the conditions contained in the Debt Commitment Letter, consummate the Debt
Financing at or prior to the Closing and (v) in the event of a failure to fund
by Financing Sources in accordance with the Debt Commitment Letter that
prevents, impedes or delays Closing, enforce its rights under the Debt
Commitment Letter with respect thereto. Upon the reasonable request of the
Company, Parent will keep the Company reasonably informed on a reasonably
timely basis of any material developments in the status of Parents and Merger
Subs efforts to arrange the Debt Financing.

 



 

(b) If the Debt Commitment Letter shall expire or terminate for any reason, or
if any portion of the amount of the Debt Financing necessary to fund the
Required Amount becomes reasonably likely to be unavailable on the Closing
Date, (i) Parent will promptly notify the Company and (ii) Parent will use its
reasonable best efforts to arrange and obtain, as promptly as practicable
following the occurrence of such event, a new debt financing commitment that
provides for a debt financing, the net cash proceeds of which, when added to
the portion of the Debt Financing that is available, cash and cash equivalents
and equity issuances (prior to the Closing Date) of Parent, Holdco, Rooster
Merger Sub, Parent Merger Sub and their respective Subsidiaries, will be
sufficient to fund the Required Amount, in each case, with conditions not
materially less favorable, taken as a whole, to Parent, Merger Sub and the
Company than the conditions set forth in the Debt Commitment Letter as in

with Accounting Standards Codification 606 (Revenue from Contracts with
Customers) and Accounting Standards Codification 842 (Leases)) and customary
authorization and representation letters, and (v) assistance with the
negotiation, execution and delivery of definitive financing documents in
respect of the Debt Financing, including credit agreements, guarantee and
collateral documents, customary closing certificates, perfection certificates,
a customary solvency certificate (in the form of the solvency certificate
attached as Schedule I to Annex B of the Debt Commitment Letter) and any
schedules thereto as may be required by the financing sources or as may be
necessary to facilitate the creation, perfection or enforcement of liens
securing the Debt Financing to the extent required, (vi) taking corporate
actions, subject to the occurrence of the Closing, reasonably requested by
Parent to permit the consummation of the Debt Financing, and (vii) promptly
after obtaining Knowledge thereof, supplementing the written information
provided pursuant to this _Section 5.17_ to the extent that any such
information contains any untrue statement of a material fact or omits to state
a material fact necessary in order to make the statements contained therein,
taken as a whole, not materially misleading in light of the circumstances
under which such statements were made. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the
Company and its Subsidiaries and their respective Representatives shall not be
required to enter into any Contract, letter, certificate, document, agreement
or other instrument (other than customary authorization and representation
letters) that will be effective prior to the Effective Time and nothing in
this _Section 5.17_ shall require (w) such cooperation to the extent it
would disrupt or unreasonably interfere with the business or operations of the
Company or any of its Subsidiaries or cause any condition to the Closing set
forth in _Article VI_ to not be satisfied or otherwise cause any breach of,
or require any waiver or amendment of, this Agreement or require any of them
to take any actions that would reasonably be expected to violate, in the
opinion of the Company, after consultation with its outside counsel,
applicable Law (x) the Company Board or the board of directors or similar
governing body of any Subsidiary of the Company (or any committee of any such
governing body) to adopt resolutions, approve any Contract, letter,
certificate, document, agreement or other instrument (other than customary
authorization and representation letters to the extent necessary) or otherwise
take any action that would be effective prior to the Closing, or (y) the
Company or any of its Subsidiaries, or any Representative thereof, to pay any
fee or other amount, or to incur any Liability (including due to any act or
omission by the Company or any of its Subsidiaries or any of their respective
Representatives) prior to the Closing, for which it has not received prior
reimbursement or is not otherwise indemnified by or on behalf of Parent. It is
understood and agreed that a failure to consummate the Debt Financing shall
not, in and of itself, constitute a failure by the Company to satisfy its
obligations under this _Section 5.17_. Parent acknowledges and agrees that
any access or information contemplated to be provided by the Company or any of
its Subsidiaries pursuant to this _Section 5.17_ shall, to the extent such
information constitutes material non-public information of the Company, only
be provided to other Persons (including any actual or potential lender,
investor, arranger, bookrunner, administrative agent, collateral agent or
Person otherwise involved in the provision or the arrangements of the Debt
Financing), if such other Person affirmatively agrees to maintain the
confidentiality of such information pursuant to a customary confidentiality
agreement and to comply with all federal and state securities Laws applicable
to such information (it being understood that the acknowledgment and
acceptance by any actual or potential lender, investor, arranger, bookrunner,
administrative agent, collateral agent or Person otherwise involved in the
provision or the arrangements of the Debt Financing that such information is
being disseminated on a confidential material, non-public information basis,
in accordance with the standard syndication processes of the Financing Sources
or customary market standards for dissemination of such type of information,
shall be deemed to satisfy the requirements of this sentence).

 



 

(d) If requested by Parent, but subject to the limitations set forth in
_Section 5.17(c)_, the Company shall, and shall cause its Subsidiaries to,
use reasonable best efforts to, to cooperate with Parent in arranging for, at
the Closing, an amendment or amendments to any of the Company Credit Facility
or pursuing any approach reasonably chosen by Parent for the assumption,
defeasance, satisfaction and discharge, constructive satisfaction and
discharge, refinancing, repayment, repurchase, redemption, termination,
amendment, guarantee, purchase, unwinding or other treatment of, the Company
Credit

 



     

 

 



 

Facility and the indebtedness incurred pursuant thereto (any such transaction,
a " **Debt Transaction** "). Subject to the limitations set forth _Section
5.17(c)_, the Company shall use reasonable best efforts to, and shall cause
its Subsidiaries to use reasonable best efforts to, cause its and their
respective Representatives to provide cooperation and assistance reasonably
requested by Parent in connection with the Debt Transactions; _provided_ ,
that the effectiveness of any documents in connection with such Debt
Transaction or, in the case of a notice of prepayment or redemption, such
prepayment or redemption, shall be expressly conditioned on the Closing. It is
understood and agreed that a failure to effectuate any Debt Transaction shall
not constitute a failure by the Company to satisfy its obligations under this
_Section 5.17_.

 



 

(e) The Company shall, and shall cause its Subsidiaries to, after (and not
prior to) the receipt of a written request from Parent to do so in furtherance
of the Debt Financing, deliver all notices and take all other actions to
facilitate the termination at the Effective Time of all commitments in respect
of each of the Company Credit Facility and any other indebtedness of the
Company or its Subsidiaries for borrowed money and other indebtedness for
which delivery of a payoff letter would be customary to be paid off,
discharged and terminated on the Closing Date as specifically requested by
Parent in writing, and the release on the Closing Date of any Liens securing
such indebtedness and guarantees in connection therewith. In furtherance and
not in limitation of the foregoing, if requested by Parent in furtherance of
the Debt Financing, the Company and its Subsidiaries shall use reasonable best
efforts to deliver to Parent (i) at least five (5) days prior to the Closing
Date (or such short period as agreed by Parent), a draft payoff letter with
respect to each of the Company Credit Facility and (to the extent requested by
the Parent to the Company in writing) any other indebtedness (including
mortgages) of the Company or its Subsidiaries to be paid off, discharged and
terminated on the Closing Date and (ii) on or at least one Business Day
Closing Date, an executed payoff letter with respect to each of the Company
Credit Facility and such other indebtedness (including mortgages) of the
Company or its Subsidiaries to be paid off, discharged and terminated on the
Closing Date, in each case in form and substance customary for transactions of
this type, from the Persons (or the applicable agent on behalf of the Persons)
to whom such indebtedness is owed.

 



 

(f) Parent shall indemnify, defend and hold harmless the Company, its
Subsidiaries and its and their respective Representatives from and against any
and all Liability, losses, damages, Legal Action, fees and expenses (including
fees and expenses of outside legal counsel, accountants, investment bankers,
experts, consultants and other advisors, and the costs of all filing fees and
printing costs) actually suffered or incurred by them in connection with any
action taken in accordance with this _Section 5.17_ and any information
utilized in connection therewith (other than information related to the
Company and its Subsidiaries provided in writing by the Company or its
Subsidiaries in connection with this _Section 5.17_), in any case, except to
the extent suffered or incurred as a result of the gross negligence, willful
misconduct or fraud by or of the Company or its Subsidiaries or their
respective Representatives. In addition, Parent shall, promptly upon written
request by the Company, reimburse the Company for all reasonable, documented
out-of-pocket Expenses (including the reasonable, documented out-of-pocket
fees and expenses of outside legal counsel, accountants, investment bankers,
experts, consultants and other advisors, and the costs of all filing fees and
printing costs) incurred by the Company or its Subsidiaries in connection with
the performance of the Companys obligations under this _Section 5.17_.

 



 

(g) Parent, Holdco, Rooster Merger Sub and Parent Merger Sub acknowledge and
agree that the obtaining of the Debt Financing is not a condition to the
Closing. For the avoidance of doubt, if the Debt Financing has not been
obtained, Parent, Holdco, Rooster Merger Sub and Parent Merger Sub shall
continue to be obligated, subject to the fulfillment or waiver of the
conditions set forth in Article VI, to consummate the Mergers, the Holdco
Common Stock Issuance and the other transactions contemplated hereby.

 



     

 

 



 

 **Section 5.18.** **Obligations of Holdco, Rooster Merger Sub and Parent
Merger Sub**. Parent shall take all action necessary to cause each of Holdco,
Rooster Merger Sub and Parent Merger Sub to perform its obligations under this
Agreement and to consummate the Mergers on the terms and conditions set forth
in this Agreement.

Surviving Corporation shall be authorized to execute and deliver, in the name

only, do not constitute part of this Agreement and shall not be deemed to
limit or otherwise affect any of the provisions hereof. Where a reference in
this Agreement is made to a Section, Exhibit, Article, or Schedule, such
reference shall be to a Section of, Exhibit to, Article of, or Schedule of
this Agreement unless the context otherwise requires. Unless the context
otherwise requires, references herein: (i) to a Contract, agreement,
instrument, or other document means such agreement, instrument, or other
document as amended, supplemented, and modified from time to time to the
extent permitted by the provisions thereof; and (ii) to a statute means such

thereto and any regulations promulgated thereunder. Whenever the words
"include," "includes," or "including" are used in this Agreement, they shall
be deemed to be followed by the words "without limitation," and the word "or"
is not exclusive and is deemed to have the meaning "and/or". The word "extent"
in the phrase "to the extent" means the degree to which a subject or other
thing extends, and does not simply mean "if." A reference in this Agreement to
$ or dollars is to U.S. dollars. Unless the context otherwise requires, (A)
the definitions of terms herein shall apply equally to the singular and plural
forms of the terms defined, and (B) where a date or time period is specified,
it will be deemed inclusive of the last day in such period or the date
specified, as the case may be. The words "hereof," "herein," "hereby,"

arising out of or relating to this Agreement or the actions of any of the

hereof, shall be governed by and construed in accordance with the laws of the
State of Delaware without giving effect to any choice or conflict of law
provision or rule (whether of the State of State of Delaware or any other
jurisdiction) that would cause the application of Laws of any jurisdiction
other than those of the State of Delaware.

defense, counterclaim, or otherwise, in any Legal Action with respect to this
Agreement and the rights and obligations arising hereunder, or for recognition

 **Section 8.08.** **Entire Agreement**. This Agreement (including the
Exhibits to this Agreement), the Company Disclosure Letter, the Parent
Disclosure Letter, and the Confidentiality Agreements constitute the entire
agreement among the parties with respect to the subject matter of this
Agreement and supersede all other prior agreements and understandings, both
written and oral, among the parties to this Agreement with respect to the
subject matter of this Agreement. In the event of any inconsistency between
the statements in the body of this Agreement, the Confidentiality Agreements,
the Parent Disclosure Letter, and the Company Disclosure Letter (other than an
exception expressly set forth as such in the Parent Disclosure Letter or
Company Disclosure Letter), the statements in the body of this Agreement will
control.

 



 

 **Section 8.09.** **No Third-Party Beneficiaries**. Except as provided in
_Section 5.10(c)_ and _Section 8.15_ hereof (which shall be to the benefit
of the parties referred to in such section), this Agreement is for the sole
benefit of the parties hereto and their permitted assigns and respective
successors and nothing herein, express or implied, is intended to or shall
confer upon any other Person or entity any legal or equitable right, benefit,
or remedy of any nature whatsoever under or by reason of this Agreement.

 



     

 

 



 

 **Section 8.10.** **Severability**. The provisions of this Agreement shall
be deemed severable and if any term or provision of this Agreement is invalid,
illegal, or unenforceable in any jurisdiction, such invalidity, illegality, or
unenforceability shall not affect any other term or provision of this
Agreement or invalidate or render unenforceable such term or provision in any
other jurisdiction. Upon such determination that any term or other provision
is invalid, illegal, or unenforceable, the parties hereto shall negotiate in
good faith to modify this Agreement so as to effect the original intent of the
parties as closely as possible in a mutually acceptable manner in order that
the transactions contemplated hereby be consummated as originally contemplated
to the greatest extent possible.

 



 

 **Section 8.11.** **Assignment**. This Agreement shall be binding upon and
shall inure to the benefit of the parties hereto and their respective
successors and permitted assigns. Neither Parent, Holdco, Rooster Merger Sub
or Parent Merger Sub, on the one hand, nor the Company, on the other hand, may
assign its rights or obligations hereunder (other than a customary collateral
assignment as security in favor of an agent for certain of the Financing
Sources) without the prior written consent of the other parties, which consent
shall not be unreasonably withheld, conditioned, or delayed. No assignment
shall relieve the assigning party of any of its obligations hereunder.

 



 

 **Section 8.12.** **Remedies**. Except as otherwise provided in this
Agreement, any and all remedies expressly conferred upon a party to this
Agreement will be cumulative with, and not exclusive of, any other remedy
contained in this Agreement, at Law, or in equity. The exercise by a party to
this Agreement of any one remedy will not preclude the exercise by it of any
other remedy.

 



 

 **Section 8.13.** **Specific Performance**. The parties hereto agree that
the rights of each party to consummate the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement, including the Mergers, are special, unique and of extraordinary
character and that irreparable damage would occur if any provision of this
Agreement are not performed in accordance with the terms hereof or are
otherwise breached, and that the parties shall be entitled to an injunction or
injunctions to prevent breaches or threatened breaches of this Agreement or to
enforce specifically the performance of the terms and provisions hereof in the
Court of Chancery of the State of Delaware (or in the event (but only in the
event) that such court does not have subject matter jurisdiction over such
Legal Action, in the United States District Court for the District of
Delaware) without necessity of posting a bond or other form of security. In
the event that any action or proceeding should be brought in equity to enforce
the provisions of this Agreement, no party shall allege, and each party hereby
waives the defense, that there is an adequate remedy at Law.

 



 

 **Section 8.14.** **Counterparts; Effectiveness**. This Agreement may be
executed in any number of counterparts, all of which will be one and the same
agreement. This Agreement will become effective when each party to this
Agreement shall have received counterparts signed by all of the other parties.

 



 

 **Section 8.15.** **Financing Sources**.

 



 

(a) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary herein, none of the Company, its
Subsidiaries, their respective stockholders, partners, members, Affiliates,
directors, officers, employees, controlling persons or agents (collectively,
the " **Seller Related Parties** ") shall have any rights or claims against
any Financing Source in connection with this Agreement, any Debt Financing or
the transactions contemplated hereby or thereby, whether at law or equity, in
contract, in tort or otherwise, nor shall any of the Financing Sources have
any obligations or liabilities to the Seller Related Parties, all of which are
hereby waived; provided that, notwithstanding the foregoing, nothing in this
_Section 8.15_ shall in any way limit or modify the rights and obligations of
Parent under this Agreement or any Financing Sources obligations to Parent
under the Debt Commitment Letter or, solely upon and if entered into, the
respective rights and obligations of the Persons party to any definitive
documentation in respect of the Debt Financing.

 



     

 

 



 

(b) Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, and without limiting
Section 8.15(a) above, each of the Seller Related Parties agrees (i) that any
action of any kind or nature, whether at law or equity, in contract, in tort
or otherwise, brought by it in respect of a Financing Source in connection
with this Agreement, any Debt Financing, the transactions contemplated hereby
or the performance of the Financing Sources with respect to the foregoing
shall be brought exclusively in the state or federal courts sitting in the
county of New York, State of New York and each of the Seller Related Parties
hereby submits for itself and its property with respect to any such action to
the exclusive jurisdiction of such courts, (ii) not to bring or support any
such action in any other court, (iii) that service of process, summons, notice
or document by registered mail addressed to it at its address provided in
Section 8.07 shall be effective service of process against it for any such
action brought in any such court, (iv) to waive and hereby irrevocably waives,
to the fullest extent permitted by law, any objection which it may now or
hereafter have to the laying of venue of, and the defense of an inconvenient
forum to the maintenance of, any such action in any such court, (v) any such
action shall be governed by the laws of the State of New York and (vi) to
irrevocably waive and hereby waives any right to a trial by jury in any such
action to the same extent such rights are waived pursuant to _Section 8.06_,
as in effect on the date hereof.

 



 

(c) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained herein, Section 5.17,
_Section 8.11_ and this _Section 8.15_ (and any provision of this Agreement
to the extent such modification, waiver or termination of such provision would
modify the substance of such Sections) may not be modified, waived or
terminated in a manner that is adverse in any respect to the Financing Sources
without the prior written consent of the Financing Sources then party to the
Debt Commitment Letter.

 



 

(d) The Financing Sources shall be express third party beneficiaries of
Section 5.17, _Section 8.11_ and this _Section 8.15_, and shall be entitled
to rely on and enforce this such Sections.

Such director or officer shall have the right to be paid by the Corporation for expenses incurred in defending any such Proceeding in advance of its final disposition; provided, however, that the payment of such expenses in advance of the final disposition of any such Proceeding shall be made

 



     

 

 



 

only upon receipt by the Corporation of an undertaking by or on behalf of such
director or officer to repay all amounts so advanced if it should be
determined ultimately that he is not entitled to be indemnified under this
Article SEVENTH, Section 1 or otherwise. No amendment to or repeal of this
Article SEVENTH, Section 1 shall apply to or have any effect on any right to
indemnification provided hereunder with respect to any acts or omissions
occurring prior to such amendment or repeal.

 



 

2. If a claim for indemnity under Article SEVENTH, Section 1 is not paid in full by the Corporation within ninety (90) days after a written claim has been received by the Corporation, the director or officer may at any time thereafter bring suit against the Corporation to recover the unpaid amount of the claim, together with interest thereon, and if successful in whole or in part, such director or officer shall also be entitled to be paid the expense of prosecuting such claim, including reasonable attorneys fees incurred in connection therewith. It shall be a defense to any such action (other than an action brought to enforce a claim for expenses incurred in defending any Proceeding in advance of its final disposition where the required undertaking has been tendered to the Corporation) that such director or officer has not met the standards of conduct which make it permissible under the GCL for the Corporation to indemnify him for the amount claimed, but the burden of proving such a defense shall be on the Corporation. Neither the failure of the Corporation (or of its full Board of Directors, its directors who are not parties to the Proceeding with respect to which indemnification is claimed, its stockholders, or independent legal counsel) to have made a determination prior to the commencement of an action pursuant to this Article SEVENTH, Section 2 that indemnification of the director or officer is proper in the circumstances because he has met the applicable standard of conduct set forth in the GCL, nor an actual determination by any such person or persons that such director or officer has not met such applicable standard of conduct, shall be a defense to such action or create a presumption that such director or officer has not met the applicable standard of conduct.

 



 

3. No director of the Corporation shall be personally liable to the Corporation or its stockholders for monetary damages for any breach of fiduciary duty by such a director as a director. Notwithstanding the foregoing sentence, a director shall be liable to the extent provided by applicable law (i) for any breach of the directors duty of loyalty to the Corporation or is stockholders, (ii) for acts or omissions not in good faith or which involve intentional misconduct or a knowing violation of law, (iii) pursuant to Section 174 of the GCL, or (iv) for any transaction from which such director derived an improper personal benefit. No amendment to or repeal of this Article SEVENTH, Section 3 shall apply to or have any effect on the liability or alleged liability of any director of the Corporation for or with respect to any acts or omissions of such director occurring prior to such amendment or repeal. If the GCL is amended hereafter to further eliminate or limit the personal liability of directors, the liability of a director of this corporation shall be limited or eliminated to the fullest extent permitted by the GCL, as amended.

 



 

4. In furtherance and not in limitation of the powers conferred by statute:

 



 

(a) the Corporation may purchase and maintain insurance on behalf of any
person who is or was a director, officer, employee or agent of the
Corporation, or is serving at the request of the Corporation as a director,
officer, employee or agent of another corporation, partnership, joint venture,
trust or other enterprise against any liability asserted against him and
incurred by him in any such capacity, or arising out of his status as such,
whether or not the

 



     

 

 



 

Corporation would have the power to indemnify him against such liability under
the provisions of law; and

 



 

(b) the Corporation may create a trust fund, grant a security interest and/or
use other means (including, without limitation, letters of credit, surety
bonds and/or other similar arrangements), as well as enter into contracts
providing indemnification to the full extent authorized or permitted by law
and including as part thereof provisions with respect to any or all of the
foregoing to ensure the payment of such amounts as may become necessary to
effect indemnification as provided therein, or elsewhere.

 



 

5. _Rights Not Exclusive_. The rights conferred by this Article SEVENTH shall not be exclusive of any other right which the director or officer may have or hereafter acquire under the GCL or any other statute, or any provision contained in the Corporations Certificate of Incorporation or Bylaws, or any agreement, or pursuant to a vote of stockholders or disinterested directors, or otherwise.

2. Restrictions on Ownership of Shares by Non-U.S. Citizens. Non-U.S. Citizens shall not be permitted to beneficially own in the aggregate, more than the Permitted Percentage of each class or series of the capital stock of the Corporation. To help ensure that at no time Non-U.S. Citizens, in the aggregate, become the beneficial owners of more than the Permitted Percentage of the issued and outstanding shares of any class or series of capital stock of the Corporation, and to enable the Corporation to comply with any requirement that it be, and submit any proof that it is, a U.S. Citizen under any applicable law or under any contract with the United States government (or any agency thereof), the Corporation shall have the power to take the actions prescribed in Article EIGHTH, Section 3 through Article EIGHTH, Section 8\. The provisions of this Article EIGHTH are intended to ensure that the Corporation continues to qualify as a U.S. Citizen under the U.S. Maritime Laws so that the Corporation does not cease to be qualified: (a) under the U.S. Maritime Laws to own and operate vessels in the U.S. Coastwise Trade; (b) to operate vessels under an agreement with the United States government (or any agency thereof) that requires the Corporation to qualify as a U.S. Citizen; or (c) to participate in or receive the benefits of any statutory program that requires the Corporation to qualify as a U.S. Citizen. The

 



     

 

 



 

Board of Directors is specifically authorized to make all determinations and
to adopt and effect all policies and measures necessary or desirable, in
accordance with applicable law and this Amended and Restated Certificate, to
fulfill the purposes or implement the provisions of this Article EIGHTH;
provided, however, that determinations with respect to redemptions of any
Excess Shares shall be made only by the Board of Directors.

 



 

3. Dual Share System.

 



 

(a) To implement the requirements set forth in Article EIGHTH, Section 2, the
Corporation may, but is not required to, institute a dual share system such
that: (i) each certificate and/or book entry (in the case of uncertificated
shares) representing shares of each class or series of capital stock of the
Corporation that are beneficially owned by a U.S. Citizen shall be marked
"U.S. Citizen" and each certificate and/or book entry (in the case of
uncertificated shares) representing shares of each class or series of capital
stock of the Corporation that are beneficially owned by a Non-U.S. Citizen
shall be marked "Non-U.S. Citizen", but with all such certificates and/or book
entries (in the case of uncertificated shares) to be identical in all other
respects and to comply with all provisions of the laws of the State of
Delaware; (ii) an application to transfer shares shall be set forth on the
back of each certificate or made available by the Corporation (in the case of
book entry shares) in which a proposed transferee of title to shares shall
apply to the Corporation to transfer the number of shares indicated therein
and shall certify as to the citizenship of such proposed transferee; (iii) a
certification shall be submitted by such proposed transferee (which may
include as part thereof a form of affidavit), upon which the Corporation and
its transfer agent (if any) shall be entitled (but not obligated) to rely
conclusively, stating whether such proposed transferee is a U.S. Citizen; and
(iv) the stock transfer records of the Corporation may be maintained in such
manner as to enable the percentages of the shares of each class or series of
the Corporations capital stock that are beneficially owned by U.S. Citizens
and by Non-U.S. Citizens to be confirmed. The Board of Directors is authorized
to take such other ministerial actions or make such interpretations of this
Amended and Restated Certificate as it may deem necessary or advisable in
order to implement a dual share system consistent with the requirements set
forth in Article EIGHTH, Section 2 and to ensure compliance with such system
and such requirements.

 



 

(b) A conspicuous statement shall be set forth on the face or back of each
certificate and/or on each book entry (in the case of uncertificated shares)
representing shares of each class or series of capital stock of the
Corporation to the effect that: (i) such shares and the beneficial ownership
thereof are subject to restrictions on transfer set forth in this Amended and
Restated Certificate; and (ii) the Corporation will furnish, without charge,
to each stockholder of the Corporation who so requests a copy of this Amended
and Restated Certificate.

 



 

4. Restrictions on Transfers.

 



 

(a) No shares of any class or series of the capital stock of the Corporation
may be transferred to a Non-U.S. Citizen or to a holder of record that will
hold such shares for or on behalf of a Non-U.S. Citizen if, upon completion of
such transfer, the number of shares of such class or series beneficially owned
by Non-U.S. Citizens in the aggregate would exceed the Permitted Percentage
for such class or series. Any transfer or purported transfer of beneficial
ownership of any shares of any class or series of capital stock of the
Corporation, the

 



     

 

 



 

effect of which would be to cause Non-U.S. Citizens in the aggregate to
beneficially own shares of any class or series of capital stock of the
Corporation in excess of the Permitted Percentage for such class or series,
shall, to the fullest extent permitted by law, be void ab initio and
ineffective, and, to the extent that the Corporation or its transfer agent (if
any) knows that such transfer or purported transfer would, if completed, be in
violation of the restrictions on transfers to Non-U.S. Citizens set forth in
this Article EIGHTH, neither the Corporation nor its transfer agent (if any)
shall register such transfer or purported transfer on the stock transfer
records of the Corporation and neither the Corporation nor its transfer agent
(if any) shall recognize the transferee or purported transferee thereof as a
stockholder of the Corporation with respect to such shares for any purpose
whatsoever (including for purposes of voting, dividends and other
distributions) except to the extent necessary to effect any remedy available
to the Corporation under this Article EIGHTH. In no event shall any such
registration or recognition make such transfer or purported transfer effective
unless the Board of Directors shall have expressly and specifically authorized
the same.

 



 

(b) In connection with any proposed or purported transfer of shares of any
class or series of the capital stock of the Corporation, any transferee or
proposed or purported transferee of shares may be required by the Corporation
or its transfer agent (if any) to deliver (i) a certification by such
transferee or proposed or purported transferee (which may include as part
thereof an affidavit) upon which the Corporation and its transfer agent (if
any) shall be entitled (but not obligated) to rely conclusively, stating
whether such transferee or proposed or purported transferee is a U.S. Citizen,
and (ii) such other documentation and information concerning the citizenship
of such transferee or proposed or purported transferee (as applicable) under
Article EIGHTH, Section 8 as the Corporation may request in its sole
discretion. Registration and recognition of any transfer of shares may be
denied by the Corporation upon refusal or failure to furnish any of the
foregoing Citizenship Statements. Each proposed or purported transferor of
such shares shall reasonably cooperate with any requests from the Corporation
to facilitate the transmission of requests for such Citizenship Statements to
the proposed or purported transferee and such proposed or purported
transferees responses thereto.

 



 

(c) Notwithstanding any of the provisions of this Article EIGHTH, the
Corporation shall be entitled (but not obligated) to rely, without limitation,
on the stock transfer and other stockholder records of the Corporation (and
its transfer agent, if any) for the purposes of preparing lists of
stockholders entitled to vote at meetings, determining the validity and
authority of proxies, and otherwise conducting votes of stockholders.

 



 

5. Excess Shares. If on any date, including, without limitation, any record date (each, an "Excess Share Date"), the number of shares of any class or series of capital stock of the Corporation beneficially owned by Non-U.S. Citizens in the aggregate exceeds the Permitted Percentage with respect to such class or series of capital stock, irrespective of the date on which such event becomes known to the Corporation (such shares in excess of the Permitted Percentage, the "Excess Shares"), then the shares of such class or series of capital stock of the Corporation that constitute Excess Shares for purposes of this Article EIGHTH shall be (x) those shares that have been acquired by or become beneficially owned by Non-U.S. Citizens, starting with the most recent acquisition of beneficial ownership of such shares by a Non-U.S. Citizen and including, in reverse chronological order of acquisition, all other acquisitions of beneficial ownership of such shares by Non-U.S. Citizens from and after the acquisition of beneficial ownership of such shares by a Non-U.S. Citizen that first caused such Permitted Percentage to be exceeded, or (y) those

 



     

 

 



 

shares beneficially owned by Non-U.S. Citizens that exceed the Permitted
Percentage as the result of any repurchase or redemption by the Corporation of
shares of its capital stock, starting with the most recent acquisition of
beneficial ownership of such shares by a Non-U.S. Citizen and going in reverse
chronological order of acquisition; provided, however, that: (a) the
Corporation shall have the sole power to determine, in the exercise of its
reasonable judgment, those shares of such class or series that constitute
Excess Shares in accordance with the provisions of this Article EIGHTH; (b)
the Corporation may in its reasonable discretion rely on any reasonable
documentation provided by Non-U.S. Citizens with respect to the date and time
of their acquisition of beneficial ownership of Excess Shares; (c) if the
acquisition of beneficial ownership of more than one Excess Share occurs on
the same date and the time of acquisition is not definitively established,
then the order in which such acquisitions shall be deemed to have occurred on
such date shall be determined by lot or by such other method as the
Corporation may, in its reasonable discretion, deem appropriate; (d) Excess
Shares that result from a determination that a beneficial owner has ceased to
be a U.S. Citizen shall be deemed to have been acquired, for purposes of this
Article EIGHTH, as of the date that such beneficial owner ceased to be a U.S.
Citizen; and (e) the Corporation may adjust upward to the nearest whole share
the number of shares of such class or series deemed to be Excess Shares. Any
determination made by the Corporation pursuant to this Article EIGHTH, Section
5 as to which any shares of any class or series of the Corporations capital
stock constitute Excess Shares of such class or series shall be conclusive and
shall be deemed effective as of the applicable Excess Share Date for such
class or series.

 



 

6. Redemption.

 



 

(a) In the event that (i) the provisions of Article EIGHTH, Section 4(a) would
not be effective for any reason to prevent the transfer of beneficial
ownership of any Excess Share of any class or series of the capital stock of
the Corporation to a Non-U.S. Citizen (including by reason of the
applicability of Article EIGHTH, Section 10), (ii) a change in the status of a
Person from a U.S. Citizen to a Non-U.S. Citizen causes a share of any class
or series of capital stock of the Corporation of which such Person is the
beneficial owner to constitute an Excess Share, (iii) any repurchase or
redemption by the Corporation of shares of its capital stock causes any share
of any class or series of capital stock of the Corporation beneficially owned
by Non-U.S. Citizens in the aggregate to exceed the Permitted Percentage and
thereby constitute an Excess Share, or (iv) a beneficial owner of a share of
any class or series of capital stock of the Corporation has been determined to
be or to be treated as a Non-U.S. Citizen pursuant to Article EIGHTH, Section
7 or Article EIGHTH, Section 8, respectively, and the beneficial ownership of
such share by such Non-U.S. Citizen results in such share constituting an
Excess Share, then, the Corporation, by action of the Board of Directors (or
any duly authorized committee thereof), in its sole discretion, pursuant to
applicable provisions of the GCL is authorized to redeem such Excess Share in
accordance with this Article EIGHTH, Section 6, unless the Corporation does
not have sufficient lawfully available funds to permit such redemption or such
redemption is not otherwise permitted under the GCL or other provisions of
applicable law; provided, however, that the Corporation shall not have any
obligation under this Article EIGHTH, Section 6 to redeem any one or more
Excess Shares.

 



 

(b) Until such time as any Excess Shares subject to redemption by the
Corporation pursuant to this Article EIGHTH, Section 6 are so redeemed by the
Corporation at its option and beginning on the first Excess Share Date for the
classes or series of the Corporations

 



      

 

 



 

capital stock of which such Excess Shares are a part, to the fullest extent
permitted by applicable law:

 



 

(i) the holders of such Excess Shares subject to redemption shall (so long as
such shares constitute Excess Shares) not be entitled to any voting rights
with respect to such Excess Shares; and

 



 

(ii) the Corporation shall (so long as such shares constitute Excess Shares)
pay into a segregated account dividends and any other distributions (upon
liquidation or otherwise) in respect of such Excess Shares.

 



 

Full voting rights shall be restored to any shares of a class or series of
capital stock of the Corporation that were previously deemed to be Excess
Shares, and any dividends or distributions with respect thereto that have been
previously paid into a segregated account shall be due and paid solely to the
holders of record of such shares, promptly after such time as, and to the
extent that, such shares have ceased to be Excess Shares (including as a
result of the sale of such shares to a U.S. Citizen prior to the issuance of a
Redemption Notice pursuant to Article EIGHTH, Section 6(c)(iii)); provided,
however, that such shares have not been already redeemed by the Corporation at
its option pursuant to this Article EIGHTH, Section 6.

 



 

(c) The terms and conditions of redemptions by the Corporation of Excess
Shares of any class or series of the Corporations capital stock under this
Article EIGHTH, Section 6 shall be as follows:

 



 

(i) the per share redemption price (the "Redemption Price") for each Excess
Share shall be paid by the issuance of one Redemption Warrant (or such higher
number of Redemption Warrants or a fraction of a Redemption Warrant, as the
case may be, then exercisable for one share of Common Stock) for each Excess
Share; provided, however, that if the Corporation determines that a Redemption
Warrant would be treated as capital stock under the U.S. Maritime Laws or that
the Corporation may not issue Redemption Warrants for any reason, then the
Redemption Price shall be paid, as determined by the Board of Directors (or
any duly authorized committee thereof) in its sole discretion, (A) in cash (by
wire transfer or bank or cashiers check), (B) by the issuance of Redemption
Notes, (C) by any combination of cash and Redemption Notes (it being
understood that all Excess Shares being redeemed in the same transaction or
any series of related transactions shall be redeemed for the same amount and
form of consideration), or (D) by any other means authorized or permitted
under the GCL;

 



 

(ii) with respect to the portion of the Redemption Price being paid in whole
or in part by cash and/or by the issuance of Redemption Notes, such portion of
the Redemption Price shall be an amount equal to, in the case of cash, or a
principal amount equal to, in the case of Redemption Notes, the sum of (A) the
Fair Market Value of such Excess Share as of the date of redemption of such
Excess Share plus (B) an amount equal to the amount of any dividend or any
other distribution (upon liquidation or otherwise) declared in respect of
record of such Excess Share prior to the date on which such Excess Share is
called for redemption and which amount has been paid into a segregated account
by the Corporation pursuant to Article EIGHTH, Section 6(b) (which shall be in
full satisfaction of any

 



     

 

 



 

right of the holder to any amount(s) in such segregated account to the extent
relating to such Excess Share);

 



 

(iii) written notice of the redemption of the Excess Shares containing the
information set forth in Article EIGHTH, Section 6(c)(v), together with a
letter of transmittal to accompany certificates, if any, representing the
Excess Shares that have been called for redemption, shall be given either by
hand delivery or by overnight courier service or by first-class mail, postage
prepaid, to each holder of record of the Excess Shares to be redeemed, at such
holders last known address as the same appears on the stock register of the
Corporation (the "Redemption Notice"), unless such notice is waived in writing
by any such holder(s);

 



 

(iv) the date on which the Excess Shares shall be redeemed (the "Redemption

Article EIGHTH, Section 6(c)(iv)); (B) the number and the class or series of
shares of capital stock to be redeemed from such holder as Excess Shares (and
to the extent such Excess Shares are certificated, the certificate number(s)
representing such Excess Shares), (C) the Redemption Price and the manner of
payment thereof, (D) the place where certificates for such Excess Shares (if
such Excess Shares are certificated) are to be surrendered for cancellation,
(E) any instructions as to the endorsement or assignment for transfer of such
certificates (if any) and the completion of the accompanying letter of

(vii) upon surrender of the certificates (if any) for any Excess Shares so
redeemed in accordance with the requirements of the Redemption Notice and the

other distributions (upon liquidation or otherwise) with respect to the Excess
Shares selected for redemption were paid into a segregated account in
accordance with Article EIGHTH, Section 6(b)(ii), then to the fullest extent
permitted by applicable law, such amounts shall be released to the Corporation
upon the completion of such redemption.

 



 

(d) Nothing in this Article EIGHTH, Section 6 shall prevent the recipient of a
Redemption Notice from transferring its shares before the Redemption Date if
such transfer is otherwise permitted under this Amended and Restated

provides notice of such proposed or purported transfer to the Corporation
along with the documentation and information required under Article EIGHTH,
Section 4(b) and Article EIGHTH, Section 8 establishing that the proposed or
purported transferee is a U.S. Citizen to the satisfaction of the Corporation
in its reasonable discretion. If such conditions are met, the Board of
Directors (or any duly authorized committee thereof) shall withdraw the
Redemption Notice related to such shares, but otherwise the redemption thereof
shall proceed on the Redemption Date in accordance with this Section and the
Redemption Notice.

In making such determinations, the Corporation may rely (a) on the stock transfer records of the Corporation and Citizenship Statements and (b) on any reasonable or accepted ownership presumption or fair inference rule, to establish the citizenship of such beneficial owners, transferees or proposed or purported transferees.
