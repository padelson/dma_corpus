for in this Section is hereinafter referred to as the "Purchase Price
Adjustment."

(b) The Purchaser shall have twenty (20) days from the Delivery Date to
deliver a written notice of disagreement to the Seller regarding the Purchase
Price Adjustment (a "Notice of Disagreement"). During such period and for so
long thereafter that the Closing Date Net Working Capital has not been finally
determined pursuant to this Section 2.3, the Seller shall make its accounting
personnel reasonably available to the Purchaser. Any such Notice of
Disagreement shall specify in reasonable detail the nature of any
disagreement, and the basis therefor. If no Notice of Disagreement is delivered within such thirty (30)
day period, the Closing Date Net Working Capital amount shall become final and
binding upon the Parties for purposes of this Section 2.3. Following delivery
of a Notice of Disagreement, the Parties shall use reasonable efforts in good
faith to resolve any differences which they may have with respect to any
matter specified in the Notice of Disagreement. If the Parties fail to reach a
written agreement with respect to all such matters within thirty (30) days of
the Notice of Disagreement, then all such matters as specified in the Notice
of Disagreement as to which such written agreement has not been reached (the
"Disputed Matters") shall be submitted to and reviewed by Grant Thornton, or
such other internationally recognized independent accounting firm mutually
agreeable to Seller and the Purchaser (the "Arbitrator"). The Parties shall
select and engage the Arbitrator within fifteen (15) days after the end of
such thirty (30) day period. Any amounts related to matters that are not
Disputed Matters shall be paid as if no Notice of Disagreement was delivered
within five (5) days of the earlier to occur of (i) delivery of a Notice of
Disagreement by the Seller, and (ii) the Closing Date Net Working Capital
amount becoming final and binding on the Parties in accordance with this
Section 2.3(b). Promptly, and no later than twenty (20) days after the
Arbitrator is engaged, the Seller and the Purchaser shall each submit to the
Arbitrator a written statement setting forth their respective computations of
the Closing Date Net Working Capital and specific information, evidence and
support for their respective positions as to all items in dispute, with a copy
submitted to the other party simultaneously. Unless requested by the
Arbitrator, no party hereto may present any additional information to the
Arbitrator, either orally or in writing. Neither the Seller nor the Purchaser
shall have or conduct any communication, either written or oral, with the
Arbitrator without the other Party either being present or receiving a
concurrent copy of any written communication. The Seller and the Purchaser,
and their respective Representatives, shall cooperate fully with the
Arbitrator during its engagement and respond on a timely basis to all requests
for information or access to documents or personnel made by the Arbitrator,
all with the intent to fairly and in good faith resolve all disputes relating
to the Closing Date Net Working Capital as promptly as reasonably practicable.
The Arbitrator shall conduct its review, resolve all disputes and, to the
extent necessary, compute the Closing Date Net Working Capital in accordance
with the Accounting Principles and based solely on the information submitted
by the Seller and the Purchaser (not by independent review). The findings and
determinations of the Arbitrator as set forth in his or her written report
shall be deemed final, conclusive and binding upon the Parties for purposes of
this Section 2.3. In resolving any disputed item, the Arbitrator may not
assign a value to any particular item greater than the greatest value for such
item claimed by either the Seller or the Purchaser, or less than the lowest
value for such item claimed by either the Seller or the Purchaser, in their
respective determinations of the Closing Date Net Working Capital. The fees
and expenses of the Arbitrator incurred in resolving the Disputed Matters
shall be borne: (i) by the Seller in that proportion that the amount the
Seller is not awarded bears to the aggregate amount contested by the Seller
and (ii) by the Purchaser in that proportion that the amount the Seller is
awarded bears to the aggregate amount contested and the Arbitrator shall make
an allocation of its fees and expenses consistent with the foregoing. For
example, if the Purchaser submits a Disputed Matter to the Arbitrator with a
value of $100,000 and the Arbitrator awards $75,000 to the Seller, the Seller
shall bear 25% of the Arbitrator\'s fees and expenses and the Purchaser shall
bear 75% of the Arbitrator\'s fees and expenses. The Parties shall be entitled
to have a judgment entered on such report in any court of competent
jurisdiction. All payments made pursuant to this Section 2.3 shall be treated by all Parties as an
adjustment to the Purchase Price.

Group Return filed by the Seller for each such year;

(ii) all examination reports (or relevant portions thereof) issued by any

periods for which the Company Group has either directly filed Tax Returns

or collect Taxes in such jurisdiction, other than with respect to Taxes and
Tax Returns of a type that the Company Group has filed in the most recently
ended taxable period for which such Tax Returns were due as shown on Section
3.17(g) of the Disclosure Schedule. The Company Group has not conducted activities or transacted business in any jurisdiction that will
require it to pay Taxes or file Tax Returns of a type that had not been paid
or filed by, or with respect to it, in such jurisdiction for the most recently
ended preceding taxable period for which a Tax or a Tax Return of such type
was due.

(h) Neither the Company nor Parent is, or has ever been, a United States real
property holding corporation within the meaning of Section 897 of the Code.

(i) The Company and Parent are members of an "affiliated group" (as that term

parent corporation, and will be included in a federal consolidated income Tax
Return filed by the Seller for its taxable year that includes the Closing
Date.

(j) Since January 31, 2006, neither the Company nor the Parent, except with
respect to Seller's affiliated group, has ever been a member of an "affiliated
group" (within the meaning of Section 1504 of the Code) filing a Group Return.
Since January 31, 2006, the Company Group has not had any liability for Taxes
of any other Person (i) under Treasury Regulation Section 1.1502-6 (or any
similar provision of Law) other than for other members of the affiliated group
of which the Seller is the common parent corporation, (ii) either by
assumption by Contract or operation of Law as transferee or successor, (iii)
or under any Tax Sharing Agreement. Section 3.17(j) of the Disclosure Schedule
sets forth a list of (w) any Person that has ever merged with or into the
Parent or the Company, (x) any Person a majority of whose capital stock (or
similar outstanding ownership interests) has ever been acquired by the Company

acquired by the Company Group, in either case, since January 31, 2006.

(k) The Company Group has not taken any action not in accordance with past
practice that would have the effect of deferring a measure of Tax from a
period (or portion thereof) ending on or before the Closing Date to a period
(or portion thereof) beginning after the Closing Date. Except to the extent
adequately reserved for on its Most Recent Balance Sheet or incurred after the
Most Recent Balance Sheet Date in the Ordinary Course of Business, the Company
Group has no deferred income or Tax Liability arising out of any transaction,
including from any (i) disposition of any property in a transaction accounted
for under the installment method pursuant to Section 453 of the Code, (ii)

contract method of accounting, or (vi) receipt of any prepaid amount on or
before the Closing Date.

(l) Except as set forth in Section 3.17(l) of the Disclosure Schedule, the
Company Group has not requested to make or agreed to make, nor is required to
make, any change in method of accounting that would require the Company Group
to make an adjustment to its income pursuant to Section 481(a) of the Code on
any Tax Return for any taxable period for which the Company Group has not yet filed a Tax Return, and no Taxing
Authority has proposed to require a change in method of accounting that would
require such an adjustment.

(m) The Company Group (i) is not a party to any joint venture, partnership or
other agreement or arrangement that is treated (or required to be treated) as
a partnership for federal income Tax purposes, and (ii) does not own any
interest in an entity that either is treated or required to be treated as an
entity disregarded as separate from its owner for federal income Tax purposes,
or is an entity as to which an election pursuant to Treasury Regulations
Section 301.7701-3 has been made.

(n) Neither the Company nor the Parent has constituted either a "distributing
corporation" or a "controlled corporation" within the meaning of Section
355(a)(1)(A) of the Code in a distribution qualifying (or intended to qualify)
under Section 355 of the Code (or so much of Section 356 as relates to Section
355).

(o) Neither the Company nor the Parent is subject to Tax in any jurisdiction
other than its country of incorporation, organization or formation by virtue
of having employees, a permanent establishment or any other place of business
in such jurisdiction.

(p) To the extent that the Company Group has applied for, received and used
aid granted by a Governmental Entity, in whatever form, in the nature of Tax
incentives or benefits that are not generally available to all similarly
situated taxpayers without specific application or approval, such aid was
availed of only in accordance with applicable Laws and in compliance with all
regulatory orders, conditions and impositions. No such aid will have to be
unwound, repaid or discontinued as a result of the consummation of the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement or any other existing
circumstance.

3.18 Property, Casualty and Liability Insurance. Section 3.18 of the
Disclosure Schedule contains a list of all property, casualty and liability
insurance policies owned or maintained by the Company, copies of which have
been made available to the Purchaser. All such insurance policies are in full
force and effect as of the date of this Agreement. All premiums under any such
insurance policy have been paid, and the Company has not received any notice
of cancellation or termination in respect of any such policy and is not in
default under any such policy. Except as set forth in Section 3.18 of the
Disclosure Schedule, no material outstanding claims exist under any insurance
policy set forth in Section 3.18 of the Disclosure Schedule that to the
Seller's Knowledge are reasonably likely to exhaust the applicable limitation
of liability. For the avoidance of doubt, Section 3.18 of the Disclosure
Schedule does not list any property, casualty and liability insurance policies
maintained by the Parent or the Seller for the benefit of the Company as part
of the Shared Services and Assets and all coverage for the Company under such
policies maintained by the Parent or the Seller will be discontinued as of the
Closing.

3.19 Benefit Plans.

(a) Section 3.19(a)(1) of the Disclosure Schedule contains a list of all
Benefit Plans sponsored, maintained or contributed to by or on behalf of the
Parent or the Company (collectively, the "Company Benefit Plans"). Section 3.19(a)(2) of the
Disclosure Schedule contains a description of each unwritten Benefit Plan and
a list of each Benefit Plan sponsored by the Seller or any ERISA Affiliate
other than the Parent or the Company (collectively, the "Non-Company Benefit
Plans"). The Company has made available to the Purchaser true and complete
copies of: (i) each Benefit Plan (including amendments since the most recent
restatement); (ii) the annual report (Form 5500) filed with the IRS or the
Department of Labor with respect to each Benefit Plan (if any such report was
required) for the three most recent plan years; (iii) the most recent
determination letter issued to, or opinion letter issued with respect to, each
Pension Plan that is intended to be qualified under Section 401(a) of the Code
and any pending applications for a determination letter for such plans; (iv)
the most recent summary plan description (and any summary of material
modifications since the most recent summary plan description) for each Benefit
Plan for which such a summary plan description is required and any summaries
or other material communications distributed to participants for each Benefit
Plan whether or not required to provide a summary plan description; (v) all
material personnel, payroll, and employment manuals and policies covering
employees of the Company; (vi) each trust agreement, insurance or annuity
contract, recordkeeping or other third-party agreement and group annuity
Contract relating to any Benefit Plan sponsored by the Parent or the Company;
(vii) all notices that were given in the last three years by the Company or
any Benefit Plan sponsored by the Company to the IRS, the Pension Benefit
Guaranty Corporation, the Department of Labor, the SEC, the Equal Employment
Opportunity Commission, or any other Governmental Entity relating to a Benefit
Plan; and (viii) all notices that were given in the last three years by the
IRS, the Pension Benefit Guaranty Corporation, the Department of Labor, the
SEC, the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission, or any other Governmental
Entity to the Company or relating to any Benefit Plan. Neither the Parent nor
the Company has agreed or committed to institute any plan, program,
arrangement or agreement for the benefit of current or former employees,
directors or independent contractors, other than the Benefit Plans, or to
amend any of the Benefit Plans, except as may be required by applicable Law.

(b) Each Benefit Plan has been operated and administered in all material
respects in accordance with its terms and complies in form and has been
operated and administered in all material respects in accordance with
applicable Laws, including, but not limited to, ERISA and the Code. Each
Company Benefit Plan that is intended to comply with Section 401(a) of the
Code has received a current, favorable determination letter issued by the IRS
or is maintained under a prototype or volume submitter plan and may rely upon
a current, favorable opinion or advisory letter issued by the IRS with respect
to such prototype or volume submitter plan. To the Seller's Knowledge, no
event has occurred with respect to any Company Benefit Plan which will or
could reasonably be expected to give rise to disqualification of such plan,
the loss of intended Tax consequences under the Code or any material Tax or
liability or penalty. There is no pending or, to the Seller's Knowledge,
threatened action in or by any court or Governmental Entity with respect to
any Benefit Plan (other than routine claims for benefits), nor, to the
Seller's Knowledge is there any basis for such an action, except to the extent
it would not reasonably be expected to result in a material liability of the
Parent or the Company.

(c) Except as set forth in Section 3.19(c) of the Disclosure Schedule, neither
the Parent nor the Company provides, is required to provide or has offered to
provide health or life insurance coverage to any individual, or to the family members of any
individual, for any period extending beyond the termination of the
individual\'s employment by the Parent or the Company except to the extent
required by the health care continuation (also known as "COBRA") provisions of
ERISA and the Code or similar benefit continuation Laws. Each Benefit Plan
that is a group health plan, as such term is defined in Section 5000(b)(1) of
the Code, complies in all material respects with Sections 601 et seq. and 701
et seq. of ERISA and Section 4980B and Subtitle K of the Code.

notice of a plant closing or a mass layoff under the WARN Act.

connection with which it could be subject either to a civil penalty assessed
pursuant to Section 502(i) of ERISA or a Tax imposed by Section 4975 of the
Code.

(f) Except as set forth in Section 3.19(f) of the Disclosure Schedule, each
Benefit Plan maintained by the Parent or the Company may be unilaterally
amended or terminated by the Parent or the Company (with respect to Parent and
Company employees), without material liability or penalty, subject to the
vested rights of existing participants under the Benefit Plans (with respect
to employees of the Parent and the Company).

(g) Except as set forth on Section 3.19(g) of the Disclosure Schedule, neither
the Parent nor the Company has any Benefit Plan or any other agreement or
arrangement under which the Parent or the Company has any liability with
respect to a "nonqualified deferred compensation plan" within the meaning of
Section 409A of the Code and applicable Treasury guidance thereunder (the
"409A Plans") which does not comply in all material respects (in form and
operation) with the requirements of Section 409A of the Code and the
applicable guidance thereunder. Neither the Parent nor the Company is
obligated to gross up or otherwise reimburse any service provider for any
Taxes that may be incurred under Section 409A of the Code.

(h) Except as set forth on Section 3.19(h) of the Disclosure Schedule, all
material contributions to, and material payments from, each Benefit Plan that
may have been required to be made in accordance with the terms of such Benefit
Plan, and, where applicable, the laws of the jurisdiction that govern such
Benefit Plan, through the date hereof have been made in a timely manner,
except to the extent that any failure relates to a Non-Company Benefit Plan
and the failure would not reasonably be expected to result in a liability of
the Parent or the Company. There are no unfunded benefit obligations under any
Benefit Plan which have not been accounted for by reserves, or otherwise fully
accrued on the Most Recent Balance Sheet.

(i) There is not now and, to the Seller\'s Knowledge, there are no existing
circumstances that could give rise to, any requirement for the posting of
security with respect to a Benefit Plan or the imposition of any Lien on the
assets of the Parent or the Company under ERISA or the Code.

(j) There does not now exist and, to the Seller\'s Knowledge, there are no
existing circumstances that could result in, any Controlled Group Liability
that would be a liability of the Company following the Closing. Without limiting the
generality of the foregoing, the Company has not engaged in any transaction
described in Section 4069 of ERISA or any transaction that constitutes a
withdrawal under Section 4201 et seq. of ERISA.

(k) Neither the execution and delivery of this Agreement or any Transaction
Document or the consummation of any of the transactions contemplated hereby or
thereby (either individually or together with the occurrence of any other
event) will (i) result in the payment by the Parent or the Company of any
amount or benefit to any "disqualified individual" with respect to the Parent
or the Company (as such term is defined in Treasury Regulation Section
1.280G-1) that could, individually or in combination with any other payment,
constitute an "excess parachute payment" as defined in Section 280G(b)(1) of
the Code and neither the Parent nor the Company is obligated to gross-up or
otherwise reimburse any person for any Taxes that may be incurred under
Section 4999 of the Code or, (ii) except as set forth in Section 3.19(k) of
the Disclosure Schedule, (A) result in any payment or benefit becoming due
under any Benefit Plan, (B) increase any compensation or benefits (including

with respect to any Non-Company Benefit Plan following the Closing.

are no pending employment charges or claims (and for the last twelve (12)
months there have been no such charges or claims) against the Company or any
current or former employees of the Company before any court, arbitral forum,
the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission or any other Governmental Entity
responsible for the prevention of unlawful employment practices nor, to the
Seller\'s Knowledge, does any basis exist therefor. The Company has not

express or implied, shall confer upon any other Person any rights or remedies
of any nature whatsoever under or by reason of this Section 5.4. The Parties
acknowledge and agree that the terms set forth in this Section 5.4 shall not
create any right in any employee of the Company or any other Person to any

under which performance is then active (and use its commercially reasonable
efforts to provide written notice of its legal name changes to the
counterparties to its other contracts under which performance is then active);
provided that, for avoidance of doubt, (x) the Company may continue to use the
word "Kforce" or "KGS" in its name (to the extent part of its current or
former name) (i) with respect to any Contracts to which it is, or becomes, a
party (and in related documents or correspondence) until the requisite change

of this Agreement in accordance with Article X, except with the prior written
consent of the Purchaser, the Company shall comply with its obligations in the
TFX Contribution Agreement and shall not amend or otherwise modify, or waive
any provision of, the TFX Contribution Agreement.

(c) In the event of the sale or other transfer of all or a significant portion
of the TFX Business or the TFX Excluded Assets by the Seller or any of its
Subsidiaries to one or more acquirors in one or a series of related
transactions, the Seller shall obtain, as a condition to such sale or other
transfer, a written undertaking from such acquirors (legally binding on them)
to refrain from, directly or indirectly, asserting or commencing, instituting
or causing to be commenced, any claim against the Company, the Purchaser or
any of their Affiliates, or any current or former directors, officers or
employees of any of the foregoing, in respect of the TraumaFX Business or the TFX Excluded Assets, with such undertaking (a true,
correct and complete copy of which shall be delivered by the Seller to the
Purchaser promptly following the execution thereof) providing that the
Company, the Purchaser, such Affiliates, and such current or former directors,
officers and employees are express third-party beneficiaries of such
undertaking and shall each be entitled to enforce such undertaking against
such acquirors (and provided that no such undertaking shall relieve the Seller
of its obligations hereunder).

5.9 Access to Information. During the period from the date of this Agreement
to the earlier of the termination of this Agreement in accordance with Article
X or the Closing Date, upon reasonable prior notice, the Parent and the Seller
shall, and shall cause the Company to, afford the Purchaser and its authorized
Representatives reasonable access during normal business hours to (i) the
personnel of the Company and (ii) books, records or Contracts to the extent
relating to the Company; provided, however, that any such access or furnishing
of information shall be conducted at the Purchaser's expense without
reimbursement from the Parent, the Seller, the Company or their respective
Affiliates, under the supervision of the Company's personnel and in such a
manner as to not unreasonably interfere with the normal operations of the
Company. For the avoidance of doubt, any information furnished or made
available by the Parent, the Seller or the Company to the Purchaser pursuant
to this Section 5.9 shall be treated as Confidential Information (as defined
in the Confidentiality Agreement, dated as of October 22, 2018, by and between
the Seller and the Purchaser (the "Confidentiality Agreement")) and shall be
treated in accordance with the Confidentiality Agreement. Notwithstanding
anything to the contrary in this Agreement, the Parent, the Seller and the
Company shall not be required to disclose any information to the Purchaser or
its Representatives if such disclosure would (x) jeopardize any attorney-
client or other legal privilege, or (y) contravene any applicable Laws
(including applicable privacy or data protection Laws) or binding agreement
entered into prior to the date hereof, and Seller may withhold any information
otherwise included in any income Tax Return or related work papers concerning
the Company or the Parent that relates to any other Affiliate of the Seller
(other than a predecessor of the Company or Parent).

5.10 Notice; Effect of Notice. From the date hereof until the earlier of the
Closing Date and the date on which this Agreement is terminated in accordance
with Article X, the Seller shall notify the Purchaser, and the Purchaser shall
notify the Seller, in writing, promptly after becoming aware of any event,
transaction or circumstance that causes or would reasonably be expected to
cause or constitute a breach in any material respect of any representation,
warranty, covenant or agreement of such notifying party (or any Affiliate
thereof) in this Agreement; provided, however, that no such notice shall have
any adverse effect on the ability of the notified party to assert the failure
of any conditions to its obligation to close set forth in Article VI or to
assert a breach of any representation, warranty, covenant or agreement of
another Party in this Agreement.

5.11 RandW Policy. The Purchaser will obtain and bind, at the equal cost and
expense of the Purchaser and the Seller, the RandW Policy at or before Closing.
The RandW Policy shall provide that the insurer will waive and not pursue any
subrogation rights against the Seller with respect to any Losses covered
thereunder, unless such Losses were caused by any fraud by the Seller. The
Purchaser agrees that neither it nor its Affiliates shall consent to any
amendment to the insurer\'s subrogation rights against the Seller in the RandW Policy,
without the written consent of the Seller. Seller will, and will cause the
Company to reasonably cooperate with Purchaser's efforts to obtain and bind
the RandW Policy. Purchaser shall not agree or consent to any amendment,
restatement or other modification or waiver of the RandW Policy or any term
thereof in any manner that would reasonably be expected to materially
adversely impact the Seller, except, in each case, with the prior written
consent of the Seller.

cause all Liabilities of the Company and the Parent to the Seller or any of
its Affiliates, including under any Contracts between the Company or the
Parent, on the one hand, and one or more of its Affiliates, on the other hand,
to be terminated in full, without any Liability surviving or arising therefrom
for the Purchaser, the Parent, the Company or any of their respective
Affiliates following the Closing; provided that the Seller, the Parent and the
Company will not terminate any of the Transaction Documents, any ongoing
obligations or Liabilities set forth in the TFX Contribution Agreement or any
Contracts or Liabilities set forth on Schedule 5.12.

Company: (a) shall provide adequate assurances to the Purchaser that the
Company and Parent provided timely pre-signing and pre-Closing notices to the
Defense Security Service (DSS), and any other Governmental Entity responsible
for the maintenance of the Company's security clearances, and (b) shall take
and shall continue to take any and all requisite steps to cause the Company
and Parent to retain, as required by the Purchaser, and to assist the
Purchaser (and its officers, directors, employees and agents) in obtaining,
the requisite security clearances for the Purchaser to own and operate the
Company (and any successor thereto) and its business as currently conducted
without delay or interruption.

5.14 No Solicitation of Competing Transaction. From the date hereof until the
earlier of the Closing Date and the date on which this Agreement is terminated
in accordance with Article X, neither the Seller, nor the Parent nor the
Company shall (and each of them shall cause their respective Representatives
not to) solicit or encourage the initiation or submission of interest, offers,
inquiries or proposals (or consider or entertain any of the foregoing) from
any Person (including by way of providing any non-public information
concerning the Company, its business or assets to any Person or otherwise),
initiate or participate in any negotiations or discussions, or enter into,
accept or authorize any agreement or agreement in principle, or announce any
intention to do any of the foregoing, with respect to any expression of
interest, offer, proposal to acquire, purchase, license, or lease (i) all or a
substantial portion of the Company's or the Parent's business or assets, or
(ii) the Company's or the Parent's capital stock or other securities, in each
case whether by stock purchase, merger, consolidation, combination,
reorganization, recapitalization, purchase of assets, tender offer, lease,
license or otherwise (any of the foregoing, a "Competing Transaction"). Each
of the Seller, the Parent and the Company shall, and each of them shall cause
their respective Representatives to, immediately discontinue any ongoing
discussions or negotiations (other than any ongoing discussions with
Purchaser) relating to a possible Competing Transaction, and shall, to the
extent permitted under any confidentiality or non-disclosure agreement
existing as of the date hereof, promptly provide the Purchaser with notice of
any written expression of interest, proposal or offer relating to a possible Competing Transaction that is received by such Party or any of its
Representatives, which notice shall include copies of any such notice, inquiry
or proposal, if in writing. The Seller represents and warrants to the
Purchaser that (i) this Section does not and will not conflict with or violate
any agreement, understanding or arrangement, whether written or oral, to which
the Seller, the Parent or the Company, or any of their Affiliates are
currently bound, and (ii) no breach or violation of the exclusivity provision
of the Letter of Intent has occurred or is continuing. Purchaser acknowledges
that a Competing Transaction does not include the potential divestiture of TFX
and that nothing in this Section 5.14 will limit any right for Seller to
negotiate or enter into any agreements with respect to the potential
divestiture of TFX (so long as the Purchaser, the Parent, the Company and
their post-Closing Affiliates are fully indemnified by the Seller with respect
thereto).

Party, arising from, relating to or otherwise in connection with the following

respective officers, directors, employees, stockholders, agents and
Representatives (each a "Seller Indemnified Party") against and hold each
Seller Indemnified Party harmless from any and all Losses suffered or incurred
by any such Seller Indemnified Party arising from, relating to or otherwise in
connection with:

(a) any breach of any representation or warranty of the Purchaser contained in
Article IV of this Agreement or in any other agreement, certificate or
instrument executed and delivered by the Purchaser pursuant to this Agreement;
or

(b) any breach or failure to perform any covenant or agreement of the
Purchaser contained in this Agreement or in any other agreement or instrument

8.4 Indemnification Procedure for Third Party Claims.

(a) In order for an Indemnified Party to be entitled to any indemnification
provided for under Section 8.2 or 8.3 in respect of, arising out of or
involving a Third Party Claim, such Indemnified Party must notify the
Indemnifying Party in writing of the Third Party Claim within twenty (20) days after receipt by such Indemnified Party of
notice of the Third Party Claim; provided, however, that failure to give such
notification shall not affect the indemnification provided under Section 8.2
or 8.3, except to the extent the Indemnifying Party has been actually and
materially prejudiced as a result of such failure. Thereafter, the Indemnified
Party shall deliver to the Indemnifying Party, within ten (10) days after the
Indemnified Party\'s receipt thereof, copies of all notices and documents
(including court papers) received by the Indemnified Party relating to the
Third Party Claim; provided, however, that failure to deliver such notices and
documents shall not affect the indemnification provided under Section 8.2 or
8.3, except to the extent the Indemnifying Party has been actually and
materially prejudiced as a result of such failure. The Indemnifying Party
shall have the right upon written notice to the Indemnified Party (the
"Defense Notice"), within thirty (30) days after receipt from the Indemnified
Party of notice of such Third Party Claim, to conduct, at its expense, the
defense against such Third Party Claim; provided, that, notwithstanding the
foregoing, the Indemnifying Party will not be entitled to control, and the
Indemnified Party will be entitled to have control over, the defense or
settlement of any Third Party Claim (and the cost of such defense and any
Losses with respect to such Third Party Claim shall constitute an amount for
which the Indemnified Party is entitled to indemnification hereunder) if (1)
the Third Party Claim involves a criminal proceeding, action, indictment,
allegation or investigation; (2) if the Third Party Claim seeks injunctive
relief; (3) the Third Party Claim could result in suspension or debarment of
the Purchaser or the Company by a Governmental Entity; (4) Losses are
reasonably expected by Purchaser to exceed the unreserved or unclaimed amount
remaining in the Escrow Account under the Escrow Agreement; (5) any insurer,
including the insurer under the RandW Policy, requires, as a condition to an
Indemnified Party's eligibility to recover insurance proceeds on account of
such Third Party Claim, that such carrier control the matter; (6) Purchaser
intends to pursue a claim under the RandW Policy; (7) the Third Party Claim
involves a customer or material business relationship of the Purchaser or the
Company; (8) the Third Party Claim involves a Tax matter (other than a Tax
matter that is an income Tax matter controlled by Seller pursuant to Article
IX); (9) the Third Party Claim is made by a Governmental Entity (other than a
Third Party Claim involving the IRS for a Tax matter as set forth in
subsection (8)); (10) the Third Party Claim involves any of the matters set
forth on Schedule 8.2 hereof; (11) the Indemnifying Party is not reasonably,
diligently or in good faith conducting a defense of the Third Party Claim (and
the Indemnifying Party is provided written notice thereof by the Purchaser and
the Indemnifying Party does not cure such action or inaction within ten (10)
Business Days); or (12) the Indemnified Party has been advised in writing by
legal counsel that a conflict of interest exists which, under applicable
principles of legal ethics, would prohibit a single legal counsel from
representing both the Indemnified Party and the Indemnifying Party in such
Third Party Claim.

(b) If the Indemnifying Party assumes control of the defense and settlement of
a Third Party Claim in accordance with this Section 8.4, (i) the Indemnifying
Party shall acknowledge in writing that the Third Party Claim is within the
scope of its obligations hereunder and shall hold the Indemnified Party
harmless from and against the full amount of any Losses resulting therefrom
(subject to the limitations and other terms and conditions of this Agreement),
(ii) the Indemnifying Party shall select counsel reasonably satisfactory to
the Indemnified Party, and (iii) the Indemnifying Party will not compromise or
settle any such Third Party Claim (other than, after consultation with
Indemnified Party, an action, suit, proceeding, claim or demand to be settled solely by the payment of money damages and/or
the granting of releases, provided that no such settlement or release shall
acknowledge the Indemnified Party's liability for future acts) without the
prior written consent of the Indemnified Party, which consent shall not be
unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed.

(c) In the event that the Indemnifying Party does not elect to conduct the
defense of the subject Third Party Claim, or ceases to continue the defense in
good faith following written notice thereof by the Indemnified Party and the
Indemnifying Party does not cure such action or inaction within ten (10)
Business Days, or the Indemnified Party has the right to assume the defense
and settlement of the Third Party Claim hereunder, then the Indemnified Party
may conduct the defense and settlement of the subject Third Party Claim and
the Indemnifying Party will cooperate with and make available to the
Indemnified Party such assistance and materials as may be reasonably requested
by the Indemnified Party. With respect to any such Third Party Claim, if the
Indemnifying Party has acknowledged that the Third Party Claim is within the
scope of its obligations hereunder and shall hold the Indemnified Party
harmless from and against the full amount of any Losses resulting therefrom,
subject to the limitations and other terms and conditions of this Agreement,
the Indemnified Party will not compromise or settle such Third Party Claim
without the prior written consent of the Indemnifying Party, which consent
shall not be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed.

(d) In the event that the Indemnifying Party conducts the defense and
settlement of the subject Third Party Claim, the Indemnified Party will
cooperate with and make available to the Indemnifying Party such assistance
and materials as may be reasonably requested by it, and the Indemnified Party
shall have the right, at its expense, to participate in the defense assisted
by counsel of its own choosing; provided that the Indemnified Party shall have
the right to compromise and settle the Third Party Claim only with the prior
written consent of the Indemnifying Party, which consent shall not be
unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed.

(e) Notwithstanding the foregoing, Seller shall not be entitled to conduct any
Tax Proceeding relating to the Company Group except as provided by Section 9.

8.5 No Double Recovery; Use of Insurance; Tax Effect.

(a) The amount of any Losses payable under this Article VIII by the
Indemnifying Party shall be net of any amounts actually recovered by the
Indemnified Party under applicable insurance policies (including the RandW
Policy) or from any other Person responsible therefor, and shall be increased
or reduced by the amount of any Tax benefits actually realized or Tax costs
actually incurred by the Indemnified Party, either by reason of the incurrence
of the Loss for which indemnification is payable or receipt of any
indemnification payment under this Agreement, so that the amount payable as
indemnification for such Loss fairly reflects that actual economic loss to the
Indemnified Party. If the Indemnified Party receives any amounts under
applicable insurance policies, or from any other Person responsible for any
Losses, subsequent to an indemnification payment by the Indemnifying Party,
then such Indemnified Party shall promptly reimburse the Indemnifying Party
for any payment made or expense incurred by such Indemnifying Party in
connection with providing such indemnification payment up to the amount
received by the Indemnified Party, net of any direct, out-of-pocket expenses reasonably incurred by such Indemnified Party in collecting such
amount. The Purchaser Indemnified Parties' right to indemnification pursuant
to Section 8.2(a) shall be satisfied as follows: (i) first, subject to the
Indemnification Deductible if applicable, during the period for which the
Escrow Agreement remains in effect, satisfied by payment from the Indemnity
Escrow Deposit pursuant to the Escrow Agreement (to the extent available);
(ii) second, satisfied by payment from the RandW Policy up to an amount equal to
the applicable policy limit under the RandW Policy (to the extent available);
and then (iii) third, subject to this Agreement, including the applicable
limitations set forth in this Article VIII, satisfied by payment from the
Seller.

(b) Notwithstanding any other provision of this Agreement to the contrary, the
Indemnifying Party shall not be liable under this Article VIII for any (i)
Losses relating to any matter to the extent that (A) the Indemnified Party
shall have otherwise been compensated for such matter pursuant to the Purchase
Price adjustment under Section 2.3 hereof; or (B) the Indemnified Party shall
have otherwise been compensated for such matter pursuant to, or the Loss was
already paid to the Indemnified Party under, any other provision of this
Agreement, so as to avoid duplication or "double counting" of the same Loss;
or (ii) Losses that are for punitive damages or multiplier of profits,
earnings or cash flow including earnings before interest (except to the extent
that such damages are paid to a third party pursuant to a settlement or
Judgment in accordance with Section 8.4).

(c) The Indemnified Parties shall take, and shall cause their respective
Affiliates to take, all reasonable steps to mitigate and otherwise minimize
their Losses to the maximum extent required by law upon and after becoming
aware of any event which would reasonably be expected to give rise to any
Losses; provided, that no Indemnified Party shall be required to initiate or
pursue any claim (i) in any Legal Proceeding or (ii) against any insurer
(other than the RandW Policy Provider with respect to the RandW Policy) if the
Indemnified Party believes in good faith that its insurance premiums would
materially increase as a direct result of a successful claim.

8.6 Limitation on Indemnification.

(a) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary set forth in this Agreement, the
Seller shall not be liable hereunder to the Purchaser Indemnified Parties
pursuant to Section 8.2(a) as a result of any breach of any of the
representations or warranties of the Seller as set forth in Article III (other
than the Fundamental Representations) until the Losses incurred by the
Purchaser Indemnified Parties as a result of such breaches shall exceed in the
aggregate Five Hundred Seventy-Five Thousand Dollars ($575,000) (the
"Indemnification Deductible"), and then only to the extent of such excess;
provided that the foregoing limitation in this Section 8.6(a) shall not apply
to claims based on fraud or breaches of Fundamental Representations, with
respect to which, in each case, all Losses in connection therewith shall be
recoverable from the first dollar.

(b) The aggregate amount of Losses required to be paid by the Seller pursuant
to Section 8.2(a) as a result of any breach of any of the representations and
warranties of the Seller as set forth in Article III, or in any certificate
delivered by the Seller pursuant to Section 8.2(a), shall not exceed in the aggregate $1,150,000 (the "Cap Amount");
provided that no provision herein will prohibit any Purchaser Indemnified
Party from recovery of amounts under the RandW Policy and provided that the
foregoing limitation in this Section 8.6(b) shall not apply to claims based on
fraud or breaches of Fundamental Representations, with respect to which, in
each case, no Losses shall count towards the Cap Amount for any purpose under
this Agreement. After the payment by the Seller of Losses that equal the Cap
Amount, any and all claims for indemnification under Section 8.2(a) shall be
satisfied solely by recovery under the RandW Policy; provided that Seller shall
remain liable for claims based on fraud or breaches of Fundamental
Representations.

(c) Regardless of the limitations set forth in Sections 8.6(a) and 8.6(b), the
aggregate amount of Losses required to be paid by the Seller pursuant to
Section 8.2(a) shall not exceed the Purchase Price; provided that the
foregoing limitation in this Section 8.6(c) shall not apply to claims based on
fraud.

(d) For purposes of determining the existence of any breach of any
representation or warranty, and for calculating the amount of any Losses
arising from any breach of any representations or warranty, all
representations and warranties shall be treated as if the words "material,"
"materially," "in all material respects," "Material Adverse Change" or similar
words or phrases containing such words were omitted from such representations
and warranties.

(e) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this Agreement, the
representations, warranties, covenants and agreements contained herein, and
any Person's right to indemnification or other remedies with respect thereto,
shall not be affected or deemed waived by reason of (a) any investigation made
by or on behalf of such Person or any of its Affiliates or the directors,
officers, employees, consultants, financial advisors, counsel, accountants and
other agents of such Person or any of its Affiliates or the fact that such
Person or any of its Affiliates or the directors, officers, employees,
consultants, financial advisors, counsel, accountants and other agents of such
Person or any of its Affiliates knew or should have known at any time that any
such representation or warranty is, was or might be inaccurate, or that any
such covenant or agreement was, or may have been breached, in each case, at
any time, whether before or after the execution and delivery of this Agreement
or the Closing, or (b) such Person's waiver of any condition to the Closing or
participation in the Closing.

(f) Effective upon the Closing, the Seller waives, and acknowledges and agrees
that the Seller shall not have, and shall not exercise or assert (or attempt
to exercise or assert), any right of contribution, right of indemnity or other
similar right or remedy against the Parent or the Company or the Purchaser in
connection with any actual or alleged breach by the Parent or the Company of
any representation, warranty or obligation set forth in this Agreement. Except
as expressly set forth in this Agreement or any other Transaction Document,
the Seller, for itself and its Affiliates, hereby irrevocably waives, releases
and discharges the Company, the Parent, the Purchaser and their respective
Affiliates, directors, officers and employees from any and all Liabilities and
obligations to the Seller of any kind or nature whatsoever arising on or prior
to the Closing Date. (g) The Purchaser may make claims under this Article VIII for potential or
contingent damages or Losses, and from time to time, the Purchaser may amend
any timely filed indemnification claim to reflect additional Losses with
respect to such claim.

8.7 Exclusive Remedy. The Parties agree that, from and after the Closing Date,
the indemnification or reimbursement obligations of the Parties set forth in
this Article VIII shall constitute the sole and exclusive remedies of the
Parties for any Losses based upon, arising out of or otherwise in respect of
breaches of the provisions set forth in this Agreement, the TFX Contribution
Agreement or any certificate executed and delivered by a Party pursuant to
this Agreement (except to the extent other remedies are otherwise expressly
provided for in the TFX Contribution Agreement or any such certificate);
provided, that the provisions of this Section 8.7 will not, subject to
Sections 8.1, 8.2 and 8.6, prevent or limit any claims or rights under the RandW
Policy or a cause of action or other remedy (a) on account of intentional (and
not constructive) fraud, intentional misrepresentation, and criminal matters,
(b) under Section 2.3 to enforce any decision or determination of the
Arbitrator, or (c) under Section 11.17 to obtain equitable remedies, including
an injunction or injunctions to prevent breaches of any covenants set forth in
this Agreement and to enforce specifically the terms and provisions hereof.
For the avoidance of doubt, this Section 8.7 shall not apply to the Escrow
Agreement, the Transition Services Agreement, the TFX Transition Services
Agreement or the Noncompetition, Nonsolicitation Agreement.

8.8 Tax Treatment of Indemnification Payments. Except as otherwise required by
applicable Law, the Parties shall treat any indemnification payment made
hereunder as an adjustment to the purchase price for income Tax purposes.

8.9 Attorneys' Fees. To the extent an Indemnifying Party is required to pay
for any Losses under this Article VIII or is subject to equitable relief, the
Parties agree that the Indemnifying Party shall indemnify the Indemnified
Party against and hold the Indemnified Party harmless from and against any and
all Losses arising from any action, suit or proceeding commenced by the
Indemnified Party for the purpose of enforcing any of its rights under this
Article VIII (including any of the Indemnified Party's reasonable expenses of
attorneys).

ARTICLE IX

TAX MATTERS

The following provisions shall govern the allocation of responsibility as
between the Purchaser and the Seller for certain Tax matters:

9.1 Taxable Periods Ending on or Before the Closing Date.

(a) The Seller, at its expense, shall properly prepare or cause to be prepared
all Tax Returns required to be filed by or with respect to the Company Group
for all taxable periods ending on or prior to the Closing Date ("Seller
Prepared Returns"), which for the avoidance of doubt shall include all income
Tax Returns (or separate company pro-forma drafts) with respect to taxable
periods of the Company Group for which a consolidated, unitary or combined Tax Return of the Seller will include the operations of the Company
Group ("Seller Group Returns"). Seller Prepared Returns shall be reviewed and
finalized for filing under the procedures described in Section 9.1(b). The
Seller shall cause all Seller Prepared Returns to be timely filed, and shall
timely pay or cause to be paid any Taxes due with respect to all Seller
Prepared Returns. Unless consented to by the Purchaser (such consent not to be
unreasonably withheld), such Seller Prepared Returns shall include no
elections that were not made in the last similar Tax Return and shall be
prepared in a manner consistent with the last previous similar Tax Return
filed by or with respect to the Company Group and in compliance with Law,
except for changes in the Law or applicable regulations.

(b) The Seller shall provide a draft copy of each Seller Prepared Return that
is not an income Tax Return to the Purchaser at least fifteen (15) days prior
to the filing deadline of such Tax Return for the Purchaser\'s review and
reasonable comment. With respect to income Tax Returns, not later sixty (60)
days before the filing of any Seller Prepared Returns that are income Tax
Returns, the Seller shall deliver to the Purchaser (i) a pro-forma federal
income Tax Return for each of the Company and the Parent that reflects the
separate income of Company Group as it will be determined for purposes of a
Seller Group Return that includes the ending date of such pro-forma Tax
Return, along with a copy of all Tax elections proposed to be made by Seller
with respect to the Company Group in such Seller Group Return, and (ii) all
draft income Tax Returns for the Company Group that are required to be filed
separately by the Company Group. The Purchaser shall provide the Seller with
any comments on Seller Prepared Returns within ten (10) days after the
Purchaser\'s receipt of each Seller Prepared Return, except that in the case
of income Tax Returns, such review period shall be thirty (30) days.

(c) If no comments are received by the Seller from the Purchaser within the
permitted review period, or otherwise upon resolution of any disagreement
regarding such Seller Prepared Return, the Seller will provide a copy of such
Tax Return (other than Seller Group Returns) to the Purchaser suitable for
execution by an authorized officer of the Company Group. If the Purchaser
provides comments on a Seller Prepared Return, the Purchaser and the Seller
will negotiate in good faith to resolve any disagreement regarding such Tax
Return. If the Purchaser and the Seller are unable to resolve any such
disagreements at least ten (10) days before the due date for filing of the
relevant Tax Return, such dispute shall be resolved by the Arbitrator in
accordance with the procedures set forth in Section 2.3(b). If the Arbitrator
has not resolved any such dispute before the due date of any Seller Prepared
Return subject to an unresolved disagreement, (i) in the case of a Seller
Prepared Return other than a Seller Group Return, the Purchaser shall be
entitled to cause to Company Group to file such Seller Prepared Return
reflecting the Purchaser's position, and shall cause the Company Group file an
amendment to such Tax Return if the Arbitrator determines that such amendment
is appropriate, and (ii) in the case of a Seller Group Return that is an
income Tax Return, the Seller shall be entitled to file such Seller Group
Return reflecting the Seller's position and shall file an amendment to such
Tax Return if the Arbitrator determines that such amendment is appropriate.
Not later than five (5) days prior to the due date for payment of Taxes with
respect to the taxable period covered by each Seller Prepared Return other
than a Seller Group Return, the Seller shall pay to the Purchaser the amount
of any Taxes required to be paid by the Company Group in connection with such
Tax Return (as shown by such Tax Return or, if such payment is due before such Tax Return is prepared and agreed between the Parties, as reasonably
estimated by the Purchaser to be due). A refund of Tax paid in connection with
a Seller Prepared Return shall be paid to Seller as provided in Section 9.4.
The Seller and the Purchaser shall reasonably and in good faith cooperate
regarding the contents and filing of all Seller Prepared Tax Returns. Where
the filing of any such Tax Returns will be extended, if the Seller or its Tax
Return preparer is unable to execute and file an extension, or if any Taxes
are due with such extension, the Seller will provide a completed extension
request to the Purchaser at least five (5) days prior to the filing deadline
for such request and will pay to the Purchaser any amount reasonably estimated
to be due with such request at the same time.

9.2 Tax Periods Beginning Before and Ending After the Closing Date; Straddle
Period Taxes. The Purchaser shall properly prepare or cause to be prepared and
file or cause to be filed any Tax Returns of the Company Group for taxable
periods that begin on or before the Closing Date and end after the Closing
Date (a "Straddle Period," and a Tax Return for such period a "Straddle Period
Return"). The Purchaser will provide a copy to the Seller at least fifteen
(15) days prior to filing of each Straddle Period Return, along with a
statement of the portion of the Tax shown as due on such Tax Return that is a
Company Tax required to be indemnified by Seller pursuant to Section 8.2. The
Seller shall provide the Purchaser with any comments on all such Tax Returns
within ten (10) days after the Seller\'s receipt of the same; provided that if
no comments are received by the Purchaser from the Seller within this
timeframe, the Seller agrees that the Purchaser may assume that the Seller has
no comments. Such Tax Returns shall be prepared on a basis that is consistent
with the last previous similar Tax Return and in compliance with Law, except
for changes in the Law or applicable regulations. The Seller and the Purchaser
shall reasonably and in good faith cooperate regarding the contents and filing
of all Straddle Period Returns. Not later than five (5) days prior to the due
date for payment of Taxes with respect to any Tax Return for a Straddle
Period, the Seller shall pay to the Purchaser the amount of any Company Taxes
with respect to such Tax Return. A refund of Tax paid in connection with a
Straddle Period Return that is attributable to the portion of the Straddle
Period ending on the Closing Date shall be paid to Seller as provided in
Section 9.4.

9.3 Straddle Period Taxes. The Parties agree that taxable periods of the
Company Group shall be treated as ending as of the close of the Closing Date
to the extent permitted by applicable Law. The Parties acknowledge that for
federal income Tax purposes, the taxable year of the Company Group shall close
at the end of the Closing Date pursuant to Treasury Regulations Section
1.1502-76(b)(1)(ii)(A)(1), and thereafter the Company Group shall be a member
of the federal income tax consolidated group (within the meaning if Treasury
Regulations Section 1.1502-1(h)) of which the Purchaser is a member. For
purposes of preparing the federal income Tax Returns of the Company Group for
its taxable year ending on the Closing Date and the first taxable year ending
thereafter, the Parties agree that no ratable allocations shall be made
pursuant to Treasury Regulations Section 1.1502-76(b)(2), unless consented to
by both the Seller and the Purchaser. In the case of Taxes that are payable
with respect to any Straddle Period, the portion of any such Taxes that is
attributable to the portion of the Straddle Period ending on the Closing Date (a) in the case of Taxes that are either (i) based upon or related to income
or receipts, or (ii) imposed in connection with any sale or other transfer or
assignment of property (real or personal, tangible or intangible) or other
specifically identifiable payment or event, deemed equal to the amount that
would be payable if the Tax period of the Seller ended with (and included) the
Closing Date; provided that exemptions, allowances or deductions that are
calculated on an annual basis (including depreciation and amortization
deductions), other than with respect to property placed in service after the
Closing, shall be allocated between the period ending on and including the
Closing Date and the period beginning after the Closing Date in proportion to
the number of days in each period; and

(b) in the case of Taxes that are imposed on a periodic basis with respect to
the assets or capital of the Seller and other Taxes not reasonably allocable
to specific income, receipts, transfers or other payments or events described
in Section 9.3(a)(i), deemed to be the amount of such Taxes for the entire
Straddle Period (or, in the case of such Taxes determined on an arrears basis,
the amount of such Taxes for the immediately preceding period), multiplied by
a fraction the numerator of which is the number of calendar days in the
portion of the period ending on and including the Closing Date and the
denominator of which is the number of calendar days in the entire period.

9.4 Tax Refunds. If any determination of Tax liability of the Company Group by
a Taxing Authority results in a refund or credit of an overpayment of any
Company Taxes (other than as a result of a carryback of a Tax attribute from a
taxable period (or a portion of a Straddle Period) beginning after the Closing
Date), which Company Taxes either (a) were paid by any the Company Group or
the Seller before the Closing Date and such overpayment was not included as an
asset (or was an offset to Tax liabilities that did not reduce liabilities) in
computing the Closing Date Net Working Capital or (b) were previously borne by
the Seller pursuant to an indemnification obligation under this Agreement, the
Purchaser shall pay to the Seller an amount equal to such Tax overpayment and
interest received thereon minus any Tax payable by the Purchaser or its
Affiliates with respect to the receipt or crediting or such Tax overpayment or
interest thereon, and all costs reasonably incurred by the Purchaser and its
Affiliates in obtaining a refund or credit of such overpayment.

9.5 Cooperation on Tax Matters.

(a) The Purchaser, the Company, the Parent and the Seller shall cooperate
fully, as and to the extent reasonably requested by the other Party, in
connection with the filing of Tax Returns pursuant to this Article IX and any
audit, litigation or other Legal Proceeding with respect to Taxes of the
Company Group. Such cooperation shall include the retention and (upon the

relating to Tax Returns or Tax liabilities of the Company Group for a taxable
period beginning before the Closing Date (a "Tax Proceeding"), such Party
shall promptly notify the other Parties of such Tax Proceeding within fifteen
(15) Business Days after its receipt of such notice provided, however, that
failure to deliver such notices and documents shall not affect the
indemnification provided under Section 8.2 or 8.3, except to the extent the
Party entitled to such notice been actually and materially prejudiced as a
result of such failure. The Parties agree to consult with and to keep the
other Parties hereto informed regarding the conduct and status of any Tax

Proceeding"). The Seller shall conduct and control all Seller Consolidated Tax
Proceedings and may elect to conduct any Company Income Tax Proceeding,
pursuant to the provisions of Section 8.4. The Seller shall keep the Purchaser
informed of all matters arising in any Seller Tax Proceeding conducted by the
Seller that relates to the Company Group or the Business and may reasonably
affect any Purchaser Indemnified Party (without regard to whether such effect
would give rise to indemnification liability under Section 8.2), and shall
consult with the Purchaser regarding the conduct of such Seller Tax Proceeding
to the extent relevant to the Tax attributes or Tax obligations of the Company
Group.

(c) The Purchaser shall have the right, at its own expense, to participate
through counsel of its choice in any Company Income Tax Proceeding being
conducted by the Seller and shall be entitled to control the disposition of any issue involved
in any such Tax Proceeding that does not affect a potential Tax liability of
the Seller (including indemnity liability under Section 8.2). The Seller shall
have the right at its own expense to participate through counsel of its choice
in any Tax Proceeding relating to a Straddle Period being conducted by the
Purchaser.

(d) Neither the Seller nor the Purchaser shall agree to any settlement or
concession with respect to any Tax Proceeding if such settlement or concession
would reasonably affect any Tax liability of the other Party or its
Affiliates.

(e) Except as provided otherwise in this Section 9.6, the provisions of
Section 8.4 shall govern the manner in which Tax Proceedings are conducted or
resolved.

9.7 Certain Taxes. Each Party shall be responsible for the payment of any
transfer, documentary, sales, use, stamp, registration and other Taxes
incurred by it in connection with the sale of the Shares contemplated by this
Agreement.

9.8 Tax Sharing Agreements. All Tax Sharing Agreements involving the Company
Group shall be terminated as of the Closing Date and, after the Closing Date,
the Company Group shall not be bound thereby or have any liability thereunder.

prior to the Closing Date without the Seller's prior written consent, not to
be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed.

election under Code section 338. If Purchaser elects any such election with
respect to the transactions contemplated hereby, notwithstanding any other
provision of this Agreement, all costs of such election, including any Tax
liability incurred by the Parent or the Company, shall be at the expense of
Purchaser, and Purchaser shall indemnify Seller for any Loss incurred by
Seller as a result of such an election.

other remedies that may be available, at law or in equity, by reason of such
