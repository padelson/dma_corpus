 _W I T N E S S E T H_ : 

   

 WHEREAS, the respective Boards of Directors of Parent, Sub and the Company have approved the acquisition of the Company by Parent on the terms and subject to the conditions set forth in this Agreement; and 

  

 WHEREAS, the respective Boards of Directors of Parent, Sub and the Company have approved a merger (the " _Merger_ ") of Sub with and into the Company, upon the terms and subject to the conditions set forth in this Agreement and have declared the Merger advisable; 

  

 NOW, THEREFORE, in consideration of the foregoing premises and the representations, warranties and agreements contained herein the parties hereto agree as follows: 

  

ARTICLE I 

   

THE MERGER 

   

 Section 1.1 _The Merger_. Upon the terms and subject to the conditions hereof, and in accordance with the Delaware General Corporation Law (" _DGCL_ "), at the Effective Time (as hereinafter defined), Sub shall be merged with and into the Company and the separate existence of Sub shall thereupon cease, and the Company, as the corporation surviving the Merger (the " _Surviving Corporation_ "), shall by virtue of the Merger continue its corporate existence under the laws of the State of Delaware. 

  

 Section 1.2 _Effective Time of the Merger_. The Merger shall become effective at the date and time (the " _Effective Time_ ") when a Certificate of Merger meeting the requirements of Section 251 of the DGCL shall have been duly executed and filed in accordance with such Section, or at such other time as is specified in the Certificate of Merger in accordance with the DGCL, which Certificate of Merger shall be filed as soon as practicable following the satisfaction or waiver, if permissible, of the conditions set forth in Article VII hereof. 

   ##### 

  

  

 Section 1.3 _Certificate of Incorporation_. The certificate of incorporation of Sub as in effect immediately prior to the Effective Time shall be the certificate of incorporation of the Surviving Corporation, until thereafter changed or amended in accordance with its terms and as provided by law and this Agreement. 

  

 Section 1.4 _By-laws_. The By-laws of Sub in effect immediately prior to the Effective Time shall be the By-laws of the Surviving Corporation, until thereafter changed or amended in accordance with their terms and as provided by law and this Agreement. 

  

 Section 1.5 _Board of Directors and Officers_. The directors of Sub immediately prior to the Effective Time shall, from and after the Effective Time, be the directors of the Surviving Corporation, until their respective successors have been duly elected or appointed and qualified or until their earlier death, resignation or removal, in accordance with the Surviving Corporations Certificate of Incorporation and By-laws. The persons designated by Parent prior to the Closing Date shall be the officers of the Surviving Corporation, until the earlier of their death, disability, resignation or removal, or until their respective successors are duly elected and qualified. 

  

 Section 1.6 _Effects of Merger_. The Merger shall have the effects set forth in Section 259 of the DGCL. 

  

ARTICLE II 

   

CONVERSION OF SHARES 

   

 Section 2.1 _Conversion of Shares_. As of the Effective Time, by virtue of the Merger and without any action on the part of Parent, Sub, the Company or any holders of the Companys shares: 

  

 (a) Each share of common stock, par value $.01 per share (the " _Common Stock_ "), of the Company that is held in the treasury of the Company and any shares of Common Stock owned by Parent, Sub or any other wholly owned Subsidiary (as defined in Section 9.12) of Parent or the Company shall be canceled and no consideration shall be delivered in exchange therefor. 

  

 (b) Each share of Common Stock issued and outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time (other than shares of Common Stock to be canceled in accordance with Section 2.1(a) and other than Dissenting Company Shares (as defined in Section 2.3)) shall be converted into the right to receive from the Surviving Corporation an amount in cash, without interest, equal to $36.50 (the " _Merger Consideration_ "). All such shares of Common Stock, when so converted, shall no longer be outstanding and shall automatically be canceled and retired and each holder of shares of outstanding Common Stock not represented by certificates (the " _Book Entry Shares_ "), and each 

   ##### 

  

   

holder of a certificate or certificates (the " _Certificates_ ") representing
any such shares of Common Stock shall cease to have any rights with respect
thereto, except the right to receive the Merger Consideration, without
interest. 

  

 (c) Each share of common stock (each a " _Sub Share_ ") of Sub, issued and outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time shall, by virtue of the Merger and without any action on the part of the holder thereof, be converted into and become at the Effective Time one fully paid and nonassessable share of common stock, par value $0.01 per share, of the Surviving Corporation, which share of common stock shall constitute the only outstanding common stock of the Surviving Corporation. 

  

 (d) If at any time between the date of this Agreement and the Effective Time, the outstanding shares of Common Stock shall have been changed into a different number of shares or a different class, by reason of any stock dividend, subdivision, reclassification, recapitalization, split, combination or exchange of shares or any similar event, the Merger Consideration shall be correspondingly adjusted to the extent appropriate to reflect such stock dividend, subdivision, reclassification, recapitalization, split, combination or exchange of shares or similar event 

  

 Section 2.2 _Exchange of Certificates and Book Entry Shares_. (a) _Paying Agent_. Prior to the Effective Time, Parent shall appoint a commercial bank or trust company reasonably acceptable to the Company to act as paying agent hereunder (the " _Paying Agent_ ") for the payment of the Merger Consideration upon surrender of the Certificates. Parent will enter into a paying agent agreement in form and substance reasonably acceptable to the Company prior to the Effective Time. 

  

 (b) _Surviving Corporation to Provide Funds_. Prior to the filing of the Certificate of Merger with the Secretary of State of the State of Delaware, Parent or Sub shall deposit with the Paying Agent cash in an aggregate amount sufficient to pay the Merger Consideration for all shares of Common Stock (determined as though there are no Dissenting Company Shares) (such amounts, the " _Exchange Fund_ "). The Paying Agent shall cause the Exchange Fund to be (i) held for the benefit of the holders of shares of Common Stock and (ii) promptly applied to making the payments provided for in Section 2.1. The Exchange Fund shall not be used for any purpose that is not provided for herein. The Paying Agent shall invest any cash included in the Exchange Fund, as directed by Parent, in direct obligations of the United States of America, obligations for which the full faith and credit of the United States of America is pledged to provide for the payment of all principal and interest, commercial paper obligations receiving the highest rating from either Moodys Investors Service, Inc. or Standard and Poors or in certificates of deposit, bank repurchase agreements or bankers acceptances of commercial banks with capital exceeding $1 billion (based on the most recent financial statements of such bank which are then publicly available), or a combination thereof, _provided_ _that_ , in any such case, no such instrument shall have a maturity exceeding three months. Any interest and 

   ##### 

  

   

other income resulting from such investments shall be kept in the Exchange
Fund. To the extent that there are losses with respect to such investments,
or the Exchange Fund diminishes for other reasons below the level required to
make prompt payments of the Merger Consideration as contemplated hereby,
Parent shall promptly replace or restore the portion of the Exchange Fund
lost through investments or other events so as to ensure that the Exchange
Fund is, at all times, maintained at a level sufficient to make such
payments. Any portion of the Exchange Fund (including the proceeds of any
interest and other income received by the Paying Agent in respect of such
funds) that remains undistributed to the holders of shares of Common Stock six
months after the Effective Time of the Merger shall be delivered to Parent at
such time. Thereafter, holders of shares of Common Stock shall look only to
Parent (subject to the terms of this Agreement) as a general creditor for
payment of the Merger Consideration, without interest, upon the surrender
of any Certificates held by them. 

  

 (c) _Exchange Procedures_. As soon as practicable after the Effective Time, Parent shall cause the Paying Agent to mail to each holder of record of a Certificate or Book Entry Share, other than shares to be canceled pursuant to Section 2.1(a), (i) a letter of transmittal (which shall specify that delivery shall be effected, and risk of loss and title to the Certificates or Book Entry Shares, as applicable, shall pass, only upon actual delivery of the Certificates or Book Entry Shares to the Paying Agent and shall be in a form and have such other provisions as Parent may reasonably specify) and (ii) instructions for use in effecting the surrender of the Certificates or Book Entry Shares, as applicable, in exchange for the Merger Consideration. Upon surrender of a Certificate or Book Entry Shares (or delivery of such customary affidavits and indemnities with respect to a lost certificate which the Paying Agent and/or the Companys transfer agent may reasonably require) for cancellation to the Paying Agent or to such other agent or agents as may be appointed by Parent, together with such letter of transmittal, duly executed, and such other documents as may reasonably be required by the Paying Agent, the holder of such Certificate or Book Entry Shares shall be entitled to receive in exchange therefor the amount of cash into which the shares of Common Stock theretofore represented by such Certificate or Book Entry Shares shall have been converted pursuant to Section 2.1(b), and the Certificates or Book Entry Shares so surrendered shall forthwith be canceled. No interest will be paid or will accrue on the cash payable upon the surrender of any Certificate or Book Entry Shares. In the event of a transfer of ownership of Common Stock that is not registered in the transfer records of the Company, payment may be made to a Person other than the Person in whose name the Certificate so surrendered is registered, if such Certificate shall be properly endorsed or otherwise be in proper form for transfer and the Person requesting such payment shall pay any transfer or other Taxes required by reason of such Certificate or establish to the satisfaction of Parent that such Tax has been paid or is not applicable. Until surrendered as contemplated by this Section 2.2, each Certificate (other than Certificates representing Dissenting Company Shares and Certificates representing any shares of Common Stock to be canceled pursuant to Section 2.1(a)) shall be deemed at any time after the Effective Time 

   ##### 

  

   

to represent only the right to receive upon such surrender the amount of
cash, without interest, into which the shares theretofore represented by such
Certificate shall have been converted pursuant to Section 2.1. If
any Certificate or Book Entry Share shall not have been surrendered prior to
six years after the Effective Time (or immediately prior to such time on
which any payment in respect hereof would otherwise escheat or become the
property of any governmental unit or agency), the payment in respect of such
Certificate or Book Entry Share shall, to the extent permitted by applicable
law, become the property of the Surviving Corporation, free and clear of all
claims or interest of any Person previously entitled thereto. Notwithstanding
the foregoing, none of the Paying Agent, Parent, the Company, Sub or the
Surviving Corporation or any party hereto shall be liable to any former
stockholder of the Company for any cash or interest delivered to a public
official pursuant to applicable abandoned property, escheat or similar laws.
Each of the Paying Agent, Parent and the Surviving Corporation shall be
entitled to deduct and withhold from the consideration otherwise payable
pursuant to this Agreement to any holder of shares of Common Stock (or
Certificates) such amounts as it is require to deduct and withhold with
respect to the payment of such consideration under all applicable Tax laws
(as hereinafter defined) and pay such withholding amount over to
the appropriate taxing authority. To the extent that amounts are so properly
withheld, such withheld amounts shall be treated for all purposes of this
Agreement as having been paid to the holder of a Certificate or Book Entry
Share formerly representing shares of Common Stock. 

  

 Section 2.3 _Dissenting Company Shares_. Notwithstanding any provision of this Agreement to the contrary, if required by the DGCL but only to the extent required thereby, shares of Common Stock which are issued and outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time and which are held by holders who have properly exercised appraisal rights with respect thereto in accordance with Section 262 of the DGCL (the " _Dissenting Company Shares_ ") will not be exchangeable for the right to receive the Merger Consideration, and holders of such shares will be entitled to receive payment of the appraised value of such shares in accordance with the provisions of such Section 262 unless and until such holders fail to perfect or effectively withdraw or lose their rights to appraisal and payment under the DGCL. If, after the Effective Time, any such holder fails to perfect or effectively withdraws or loses such right, such shares will thereupon be treated as if they had been converted into and have become exchangeable for, at the Effective Time, the right to receive the Merger Consideration, without any interest thereon. Upon the Companys receipt of any notice of election to dissent in accordance with the provisions of such Section 262, the Company shall as promptly as reasonably practicable provide Parent with a copy of such notice of election to dissent and provide Parent, at Parents expense, the opportunity to direct all negotiations and proceedings with respect to demands for appraisal under the DGCL so long as Parent does not create obligations for the Company effective prior to the Effective Time. The Company shall not, except with the prior written consent of Parent, make any payment with respect to any such election to dissent or offer to settle or settle any such election to dissent. 

   ##### 

  

  

 Section 2.4 _No Further Ownership Rights in the Shares_. From and after the Effective Time, the holders of shares of Common Stock which were outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time shall cease to have any rights with respect to such shares except as otherwise provided in this Agreement or by applicable law. All cash paid upon the surrender of Certificates or Book Entry Shares in accordance with the terms hereof shall be deemed to have been issued in full satisfaction of all rights pertaining to the shares of Common Stock. 

  

 Section 2.5 _Closing of Company Transfer Books_. At the Effective Time, the stock transfer books of the Company shall be closed and no transfer of shares of Common Stock outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time shall thereafter be made. If, after the Effective Time, Certificates representing shares of Common Stock outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time are presented to the Surviving Corporation or the Paying Agent for any reason, they shall be canceled and exchanged as provided in this Article II. 

  

 Section 2.6 _Stock Options, Restricted Stock Units_. 

  

 (a) Except as provided in Section 2.6(c), at the Effective Time, each outstanding option to purchase shares of Common Stock (an " _Option_ ") under any Company stock option plan (" _Company Stock Plan_ "), whether or not then exercisable, shall be assumed by Parent and converted into an option to purchase shares of Parents common stock (" _Parent Stock_ "). Each Option so assumed by Parent (an " _Assumed Option_ ") shall continue to have, and be subject to, the same terms and conditions set forth in the Company Stock Plan and as provided in the respective option agreements governing such Assumed Option immediately prior to the Effective Time, except that (i) each Assumed Option shall be exercisable for a number of shares of Parent Stock determined by multiplying the number of shares of Common Stock subject to such Option as of the Effective Time by the Equity Exchange Number (as that term is defined below), rounded to the nearest whole number, and (ii) the per share exercise price of each Assumed Option shall be determined by dividing the exercise price for one share of Common Stock under the Option by the Equity Exchange Number, rounded to the nearest whole cent. The " _Equity Exchange Number_ " shall equal the Merger Consideration divided by the average of the closing price of a share of Parent Stock for the five trading days immediately preceding the Effective Time on the New York Stock Exchange. The assumption by Parent of the Options shall be made in accordance with the Final Regulations under Section 409A of the Code so as not to be deemed the grant of a new stock right or a change in the form of payment for purposes of Section 409A of the Code. For purposes of clarification, no vesting schedule for any Assumed Option shall be accelerated or otherwise modified as a result of the transactions contemplated hereby, other than any acceleration required by the terms of any agreement or Employee Benefit Plan in force as of the date of this Agreement as set forth in Section 3.11(f) of the Disclosure Schedule. 

   ##### 

  

  

 (b) Except as provided in Section 2.6(c), at the Effective Time, each outstanding restricted stock unit granted by the Company (individually, a " _Restricted Stock Unit_ ") under any Company Stock Plan shall be assumed by Parent (" _Assumed RSU_ ") and converted into the right for the holder thereof to receive shares of Parent Stock (or cash in lieu of fractional shares). Each Assumed RSU shall continue to have, and be subject to, the same terms and conditions set forth in the Company Stock Plan and as provided in the respective restricted stock unit agreements governing such Assumed RSU immediately prior to the Effective Time, except that the number of shares of Parent Stock under each Assumed RSU shall equal the number determined by multiplying the number of shares of Common Stock subject to the Restricted Stock Unit immediately prior to the Effective Time by the Equity Exchange Number. For purposes of clarification, no vesting schedule for any Restricted Stock Unit assumed by Parent shall be accelerated or otherwise modified as a result of the transactions contemplated hereby, other than any acceleration required by the terms of any agreement or Employee Benefit Plan in force as of the date of this Agreement as set forth in Section 3.11(f) of the Disclosure Schedule. 

  

 (c) Notwithstanding the provisions of Sections 2.6(a) and 2.6(b), all Options and Restricted Stock Units granted to the executive officers listed on Section 6.6(c) of the Disclosure Schedule and to the members of the Board of Directors of the Company who are not also employees of the Company, which are outstanding at the Effective Time, whether or not then exercisable, shall be canceled at the Effective Time, and (i) each such holder of an Option shall be entitled to receive from the Surviving Corporation, for each share of Common Stock subject to such Option, an amount in cash equal to the excess, if any, of the Merger Consideration over the per share exercise price of such Option, without interest, and (ii) each such holder of a Restricted Stock Unit shall be entitled to receive from the Surviving Corporation for each share of Common Stock allocable to such Restricted Stock Unit an amount in cash, without interest, equal to the Merger Consideration. The Company shall use its reasonable best efforts to take all actions necessary to effectuate the foregoing, including seeking to obtain any necessary consents of the holders of Options and Restricted Stock Units that are the subject of this Section 2.6(c). 

  

 (d) All amounts payable pursuant to this Section 2.6 shall be subject to all applicable withholding of taxes and shall be paid promptly following the Effective Time. 

  

 Section 2.7 _Closing_. The closing of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement (the " _Closing_ ") shall take place at the offices of Fried, Frank, Harris, Shriver and Jacobson, One New York Plaza, New York, New York 10004, at 9:00 a.m. local time on the third business day after the day on which the last of the conditions set forth in Article VII (other than those that can only be fulfilled at the Effective Time) is fulfilled or 

   ##### 

  

   

waived or at such other time and place as Parent and the Company shall agree
in writing. The actual date and time at which the Closing occurs is referred
to as the " _Closing Date_."

those regulatory consents, approvals and waivers set forth in the Disclosure

failure of which to be obtained or made would not, individually or in the
aggregate, have a Material Adverse Effect, materially impair the ability of
the Company to perform its obligations hereunder or prevent or materially
delay the consummation of any of the material transactions
contemplated hereby. 

  

 Section 3.5 _SEC Documents_. (a) Since December 31, 2005, the Company has filed or furnished all documents with the SEC required to be filed by the Company under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended (the "Securities Act") or the Exchange Act (the " _Company SEC Documents_ "). As of their respective dates, the Company SEC Documents complied in all material respects with the requirements of the Securities Act or the Exchange Act, as the case may be, and as of their respective dates and except as amended or supplemented prior to the date hereof, none of the Company SEC Documents contained any untrue statement of a material fact or omitted to state a material fact required to be stated therein or necessary in order to make the statements therein, in light of the circumstances under which they were made, not misleading, except that no representation is made by the Company with respect to information supplied by Parent, Sub or their respective Subsidiaries for inclusion in the Company SEC Documents. Each of the financial statements of the Company, including the related notes

accounting requirements and the published rules and regulations of the SEC
with respect thereto, have been prepared in accordance with U.S. generally
accepted accounting principles (" _U.S. GAAP_ ") (except, in the case
of unaudited statements, as permitted by Form 10-Q of the SEC) applied on a
consistent basis during the periods involved (except as may be indicated
therein or in the notes thereto) and fairly present in all material respects
the financial position of the Company and its Subsidiaries as at the dates
thereof and the results of their operations, cash flows and changes in
financial position for the periods then ended (subject, in the case of
unaudited statements, to normal year-end audit adjustments that in the
aggregate would not be material and, with respect to Company SEC
Documents filed prior to the date hereof, to any other adjustments set forth

The Company has established and maintains disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Rule 13a-15 under the Exchange Act) designed to ensure, and the Company has no reasonable basis to believe such controls and procedures are not effective to ensure, that material information relating to the Company, including its consolidated Subsidiaries, is made known on a timely basis to the individuals responsible for the preparation of the Companys filings with the SEC and other public disclosure documents. Except as would not, individually or in the aggregate, have a Material Adverse Effect, the Company has established and maintains a system of internal accounting controls and financial reporting sufficient to comply with all legal and accounting requirements applicable to the Company that (i) was effective as of December 31, 2005 and (ii) with respect to subsequent periods, has been designed by 

   ##### 

  

   

the Company to be, and the Company has no reason to believe it will not be,
effective, in each case, to provide reasonable assurances regarding the
reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial
statements in accordance with U.S. GAAP. The Company has disclosed, based on
its most recent evaluation of internal controls, to the Companys auditors
and its audit committee (A) any significant deficiencies and material

its internal accounting controls which are reasonably likely to adversely
affect the Companys ability to record, process, summarize and report
financial information, and (B) any fraud, whether or not material, known to
the Company that involves management or other employees who have a
significant role in internal controls. To the best knowledge of the Company,

Committee of the Companys Board of Directors. The Company has provided
to Parent a summary of any disclosure made by management to the Companys
auditors and audit committee since December 31, 2004 regarding significant
deficiencies, material weaknesses and fraud. As used in this Agreement, "best
knowledge" means with respect to the Company or its Subsidiaries, the actual
knowledge of the Chief Executive Officer, Chief Financial Officer, General

The Proxy Statement shall comply as to form in all material respects with the requirements of the Exchange Act. 

  

 Section 3.7 _Absence of Certain Events_. Since December 31, 2006, the Company and each of its Subsidiaries has operated its respective business in all material respects in the ordinary course consistent with past practice (except with respect to the Companys exploration of strategic options, including discussions with third parties regarding transactions involving the Company, its Subsidiaries or their equity securities, 

   ##### 

  

   

providing information to such third parties and related matters) and since

Effect; (ii) any entry into any commitment or transaction that, individually
or in the aggregate, has had or would reasonably be expected to have a
Material Adverse Effect; (iii) any material change by the Company or any of
its Subsidiaries in its accounting methods, principles or practices; (iv) any

Effect. Neither the Company nor any of its Subsidiaries has granted any
sublicense or similar right with respect to any License-In Agreement, except

foregoing (or any other) representation is limited by the qualifier "as of
the date hereof" (or words having similar effect), the effect of items
arising or occurring after the date hereof that would make such
representation untrue as of the Closing Date as interpreted under Section
7.2(a) if such representation were not so qualified may be considered for
purposes of Sections 3.7(i) and 7.2(c). 

  

 (b) Each Material Contract, and each new Contract entered into or amended after the date hereof that if in effect on such terms as of the date hereof would have been a Material Contract (each, a " _New Contract_ "), is a valid and binding obligation of the Company or its relevant Subsidiary party thereto enforceable against the Company or such Subsidiary in accordance with its terms and, to the best knowledge of the Company, each other party thereto, and is in full force and effect, and the Company or such Subsidiary has performed in all material respects all obligations required to be performed by it to the date hereof under each Material Contract or New Contract and, to the best knowledge of the Company, each other party to each Material Contract or New Contract has performed in all material respects all obligations required to be performed by it under such Material Contract or New Contract, except in each case as, individually or in the aggregate, would not reasonably be expected to have a Material Adverse Effect.

   ##### 

  

   

assets is bound and, to its best knowledge, no other party is in violation
of, or in default of any obligation under, such Material Contracts or New

Company has made available to the Parent true and complete copies of all
Material Contracts (with pricing and similar information redacted except

REPRESENTATIONS AND WARRANTIES OF PARENT AND SUB  

  

 Parent and Sub, jointly and severally, represent and warrant to the Company as follows: 

  

 Section 4.1 _Organization, Standing and Power_. Each of Parent and Sub is duly organized, validly existing and in good standing under the laws of its state of incorporation and has all requisite power and authority to own, lease and operate its assets and carry on its business as now being conducted. Each of Parent and Sub is duly qualified to do business and in good standing as a foreign corporation authorized to do business in each jurisdiction in which the properties owned, leased or operated by it or the nature of business conducted by it makes such qualification necessary, except where the failure to be so qualified would, individually or in the aggregate, not reasonably be expected to prevent or delay materially the consummation of the Merger. 

  

 Section 4.2 _Sub_. Since the date of its incorporation, Sub has not carried on any business or conducted any operations, and will not do so, other than the execution of this Agreement, the performance of its obligations hereunder and matters ancillary

Merger and the other transactions contemplated by this Agreement. All of the
outstanding shares of capital stock of Sub have been validly issued, are

The execution, delivery and performance of this Agreement by each of Parent and Sub and the consummation by Parent and Sub of the Merger and the other transactions contemplated by this Agreement have been duly authorized by all necessary corporate action on the part of each of Parent and Sub. This Agreement has been duly executed and delivered by each of Parent and Sub and (assuming the valid authorization, execution and delivery of this Agreement by the Company) constitutes a valid and binding obligation of Parent and Sub enforceable against Parent and Sub in accordance with its terms, except as the enforceability thereof may be limited by bankruptcy, insolvency, moratorium or other similar laws affecting or relating to enforcement of creditors rights generally or by general principles of equity. The execution and delivery of this Agreement does not, and the consummation of the Merger and the other transactions contemplated hereby and compliance with the provisions hereof will not, conflict with, or result in any violation of, or default (with or without notice or lapse of time, or both) under, or trigger or change any rights or obligations (including any increase in payments owed) or require the consent of any Person under, or give rise to a right of termination, cancellation or acceleration of any obligation or to the loss of a material benefit under, or result in the creation of any Lien upon any of the properties or assets of Parent or any of its Subsidiaries under, any provision of (i) the charter, by-laws or other organizational documents of Parent or any of its Subsidiaries, (ii) any Contract to which Parent or any of its Subsidiaries is a party or by which any of their respective properties or assets are bound or affected, or (iii) any judgment, order, decree, statute, law, ordinance, rule, listing standard, arbitration award or regulation applicable to Parent or any of its Subsidiaries or any of their respective properties or assets, other than, in the case of clause (ii) or (iii), any such conflicts, violations, defaults, rights, or Liens that, individually or in the aggregate, would not reasonably be expected to materially impair the ability of Parent and Sub to perform their obligations hereunder or prevent the consummation of the Merger or any of the other material transactions contemplated hereby. No Consents of, or Registrations with, any Governmental Entity is required by or with respect to Parent or any of its Subsidiaries in connection with the execution and delivery of this Agreement by Parent or Sub or the consummation by Parent or any of its Subsidiaries of the Merger and the other transactions contemplated hereby, except for (i) compliance with and filings under the HSR Act, (ii) compliance with the provisions of the Exchange Act and the rules of any national securities exchange, (iii) the filing of the 

   ##### 

  

   

Certificate of Merger with the Secretary of State of the State of Delaware
and appropriate documents with the relevant authorities of other states in
which the Company is qualified to do business, (iv) foreign and supranational
laws relating to antitrust and anticompetition clearances, filings or
notices, (v) those Registrations and Consents set forth in Section 4.3(b) of
the Disclosure Schedule, (vi) as may be required in connection with the
Taxes described in Section 6.10, and (vii) such other Consents or
Registrations the failure of which to be obtained or made would not,
individually or in the aggregate, materially impair the ability of Parent and
Sub to perform their obligations hereunder or prevent or materially delay
the consummation of the Merger or any of the material transactions
contemplated hereby. 

  

 Section 4.4 _Proxy Statement_. None of the information supplied or to be supplied by Parent or Sub for inclusion or incorporation by reference in the Proxy Statement at the time of the mailing of the Proxy Statement and any amendments or supplements thereto and at the time of the Stockholder Meeting, will contain any untrue statement of a material fact or omit to state any material fact required to be stated therein or necessary in order to make the statements therein, in light of the circumstances under which they are made, not misleading, except that no representation is made by Parent or Sub with respect to information supplied by the Company for inclusion or incorporation by reference therein. 

  

 Section 4.5 _Financing_. Parent will have available sufficient funds to enable it and Sub to consummate the Merger and the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, including without limitation, to pay the aggregate Merger Consideration to be paid to the holders of shares of Common Stock and the aggregate consideration to be paid to holders of Options and Restricted Stock Units as a result of the Merger. 

  

 Section 4.6 _Litigation_. Except for matters which would not, individually or in the aggregate, reasonably be expected to prevent or materially delay the ability of Parent or Sub to consummate the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, there are no civil, criminal, administrative or regulatory actions, suits, claims, hearings, investigations or proceedings pending or, to the knowledge of Parent, threatened against Parent or any of its Subsidiaries or any of their respective officers or directors in his or her capacity as such, nor is there any order, judgment, decree or injunction of any Governmental Entity outstanding against Parent or any of its Subsidiaries or any of their respective officers or directors in his or her capacity as such which, individually or in the aggregate, would reasonably be expected to prevent or materially delay the ability of Parent or Sub to consummate the transactions contemplated by this Agreement. 

  

 Section 4.7 _Brokers_. No broker, investment banker or other Person, other than Banc of America Securities LLC and Bear, Stearns and Co. Inc., the fees and expenses of which will be paid by Parent, is entitled to any brokers, finders or other similar fee or 

   ##### 

  

   

commission in connection with the Merger and the transactions contemplated by
this Agreement based upon arrangements made by or on behalf of the Parent or
Sub. 

  

 Section 4.8 _Ownership of Shares_. Neither Parent nor Sub or any of their Subsidiaries beneficially owns any shares of Common Stock as of the date hereof. 

  

 Section 4.9 _Solvency_. As of the Effective Time, assuming satisfaction of the conditions to Parents and Subs obligations to consummate the Merger, or waiver of such conditions, and after giving effect to all of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, including financing therefor and the payment of the aggregate Merger Consideration, payment of the aggregate consideration to be paid to holders of Options and Restricted Stock Units in the Merger, any repayment or refinancing of debt contemplated by Parents relevant financing commitments (including the repurchase of the Companys 5.39% Senior Guaranteed Notes due September 30, 2012 in accordance with Section 8.3 of the related Note Purchase Agreement dated September 30, 2005), payment of all related fees and expenses, and assuming that the Company is Solvent immediately prior to the Effective Time (giving effect to any obligations which may be accelerated as a result of the consummation of the Merger and the other transactions contemplated hereby), each of Parent and the Surviving Corporation will be Solvent. For the purposes of this Section 4.9 the term " _Solvent_ " when used with respect to any Person, means that, as of any date of determination, (a) the amount of the "fair saleable value" of the assets of such Person will, as of such date, exceed (i) the value of all "liabilities of such Person, including contingent and other liabilities" as of such date, as such quoted terms are generally determined in accordance with applicable federal laws governing determinations of the insolvency of debtors, and (ii) the amount that will be required to pay the probable liabilities of such Person on its existing debts (including contingent liabilities) as such debts become absolute and matured, (b) such Person will not have, as of such date, an unreasonably small amount of capital for the operation of the businesses in which it is engaged or proposed to be engaged following such date, and (c) such Person will be able to pay its liabilities, including contingent and other liabilities, as they mature. For purposes of this definition, "not have an unreasonably small amount of capital for the operation of the businesses in which it is engaged or proposed to be engaged" and "able to pay its liabilities, including contingent and other liabilities, as they mature" means that such Person will be able to generate enough cash from operations, asset dispositions or refinancings, or a combination thereof, to meet its obligations as they become due. 

  

 Section 4.10 _No Other Representations_. Except for the representations and warranties contained in this Article IV of this Agreement or in any certificate delivered pursuant hereto, the Company acknowledges that neither Parent, Sub nor any other Person on behalf of Parent or Sub makes any other express or implied representation or warranty with respect to Parent or Sub with respect to any other information provided to the Company.

 Section 6.2 _Directors  and Officers Indemnification_. (a) For a period of six years after the Effective Time, Parent shall cause the Surviving Corporation (and its successors) to establish and maintain provisions in its Certificate of Incorporation and By-laws concerning the indemnification and exoneration of the Companys former and current officers, directors, employees, and agents that are no less favorable to those persons than the provisions of the Certificate of Incorporation and By-laws of the Company as in effect as of the date hereof. Parent shall guaranty the payment and performance by the Surviving Corporation of, and shall cause the Surviving Corporation to honor its obligations under, this Section 6.2 without limit as to time. 

   ##### 

  

  

 (b) The Surviving Corporation shall indemnify and hold harmless, to the fullest extent a Delaware corporation is permitted to indemnify its directors and officers under applicable law, each present and former director and officer of the Company (each such director or officer, together with such persons heirs, executors or administrators, an " _Indemnified Party_ " and collectively, the " _Indemnified Parties_ ") against any costs or expenses (including attorneys fees), judgments, fines, losses, claims, damages, liabilities and amounts paid in settlement actually and reasonably incurred in connection with any actual or threatened claim, action, suit, proceeding or investigation, whether civil, criminal, administrative or investigative, arising out of, relating to or in connection with (i) any acts or omissions occurring or alleged to occur prior to the Effective Time in their capacities as officers or directors of the Company or in their capacity as an officer, director or other fiduciary in any other entity (including as trustee of any Employee Benefit Plan) if such service was at the request of the Company or (ii) the adoption and approval of this Agreement, the Merger or the other transactions contemplated by this Agreement or arising out of or pertaining to the transactions contemplated by this Agreement in their capacities as officers or directors of the Company. 

  

 (c) For a period of six years after the Effective Time, Parent shall cause to be maintained in effect, without any lapse in coverage, the current policies of directors and officers liability insurance and fiduciary liability insurance maintained by the Company and its Subsidiaries ( _provided_ _that_ Parent may substitute therefor policies of at least the same coverage and amounts containing terms and conditions that are substantially equivalent to those in effect under the current policies) with respect to matters arising on or before the Effective Time; _provided_ , _however_ , that (i) in lieu of the purchase of such insurance by Parent, the Company shall, at Parents option and if reasonably available, prior to the Effective Time, purchase a six-year extended reporting period endorsement under its existing directors and officers liability insurance coverage, and (ii) during this period, Parent shall not be required to procure any coverage in excess of the amount that can be obtained for the remainder of the period for an annual premium of 250% of the current annual premium paid by the Company for its existing coverage. Notwithstanding the foregoing, Parent may elect in lieu of the foregoing insurance, prior to the Effective Time, to require the Company to obtain, if reasonably available, and fully pay for a policy (providing coverage for the Indemnified Parties and such officers) with a claims period of at least six (6) years from the Effective Time from an insurance carrier with the same or better credit rating as the Companys current insurance carrier with respect to directors and officers liability insurance in an amount and scope no less favorable than the Companys existing policies with respect to matters existing or occurring at or prior to the Effective Time. If such "tail" policy has been obtained by the Company prior to the Effective Time, Parent and the Surviving Corporation shall maintain such policy in full force and effect for its full term and shall continue to honor the Companys obligations thereunder. 

   ##### 

  

  

 (d) In the event of any breach by the Surviving Corporation or Parent of this Section 6.2, the Surviving Corporation and Parent shall pay all reasonable expenses, including reasonable attorneys fees, that may be incurred by any Indemnified Party in enforcing the indemnity and other obligations provided in this Section 6.2. 

  

 (e) The rights of each Indemnified Party hereunder shall be in addition to, and not in limitation of, any other rights such Indemnified Party may have under the Certificate of Incorporation or By-laws of the Company, any other indemnification arrangement, the DGCL or otherwise. The provisions of this Section 6.2 shall survive the consummation of the Merger and expressly are intended to benefit each of the Indemnified Parties and the Indemnified Parties shall be entitled to enforce the covenants contained in this Section 6.2. 

  

 (f) In the event that Parent or the Surviving Corporation (i) consolidates with or merges into any other Person or entity and shall not be the continuing or surviving entity of such consolidation or merger or (ii) transfers or conveys all or substantially all its properties and assets to any Person or entity, then, and in each such case, proper provision shall be made so that such continuing or surviving entity or transferee, as the case may be, assumes the obligations of Parent or the Surviving Corporation, as applicable, set forth in this Section 6.2. 

  

 Section 6.3 _No Solicitation_. (a) After the date hereof and prior to the Effective Time, the Company agrees that the Company and its Subsidiaries shall not, and that it shall use its reasonable best efforts (including providing express instructions) to cause the officers, directors, employees, investment bankers, attorneys and other advisors or representatives (collectively " _Representatives_ ") of the Company or its Subsidiaries, not to, directly or indirectly, (i) solicit, initiate, knowingly encourage or knowingly facilitate any inquiry, proposal or offer which constitutes or could reasonably be expected to lead to an Acquisition Proposal (as used herein, such term shall mean any proposal or offer relating to a merger, acquisition, consolidation, tender offer, exchange offer or similar transaction involving, or any proposal or offer to purchase or acquire in any manner (A) assets representing 15% or more of the assets of the Company and its Subsidiaries, taken as a whole, or (B) an equity interest in 15% or more of the voting securities of the Company or of any of its Subsidiaries if such Subsidiaries own directly or indirectly 15% or more of the assets referred to in clause (A) (other than the transactions contemplated by this Agreement), (ii) enter into, participate, continue or otherwise engage in discussions or negotiations with, or provide any information to any Person (other than Parent, Sub and their representatives) with respect to any inquiries regarding, or the making of, an Acquisition Proposal, or (iii) approve or permit the Company or any of its Subsidiaries to enter into any letter of intent, agreement in principle, acquisition agreement or other preliminary or definitive agreement relating to an Acquisition Proposal (other than a confidentiality agreement with a party to whom the Company is permitted to provide information in accordance with Section 6.3(b)). In response to any 

   ##### 

  

   

inquiry regarding an Acquisition Proposal, the Company may
respond substantially to the effect that it is subject to a "no solicitation"
covenant and refer the requesting Person to Company SEC Documents. Without
limiting the foregoing, it is understood that any action taken by any
Representative of the Company or any Subsidiary that would be a violation of
this Section 6.3(a) if taken by the Company shall be deemed a breach by the
Company. The Company shall not release any third party from, or waive any
provision of, any confidentiality or standstill agreement to which it is a
party (other than to the extent required by the existing terms as of the date
hereof of any such confidentiality or standstill agreement) and shall
request the return or destruction of any confidential information provided to
any third party prior to the date hereof in connection with a possible
Acquisition Proposal to the extent permitted by any such confidentiality or
standstill agreement. 

  

 (b) Notwithstanding the provisions of paragraph (a) above or any other provision of this Agreement, prior to the receipt of the Stockholder Approval, (i) the Company may, in response to an unsolicited bona fide Acquisition Proposal from a corporation, partnership, Person or other entity or group which is received on after the execution and delivery of this Agreement by the Company, whether or not from a participant in the Companys publicly announced process of exploring strategic options (a " _Potential Acquiror_ ") which the Companys Board of Directors determines, in good faith and after consultation with its independent financial advisor and outside legal counsel, is reasonably likely to lead to a Superior Proposal, (x) furnish information to such Potential Acquiror, its representatives, advisors, sources of debt or equity financing and not more than one Person identified in the Acquisition Proposal as a potential buyer of any of the Companys assets or businesses from such Potential Acquiror pursuant to an executed confidentiality agreement containing terms and provisions no less favorable to the Company than those contained in the Confidentiality Agreement, provided that all such information, if written, has previously been provided to Parent or is provided to Parent prior to or substantially concurrently with the time it is provided to such Person, and, if oral and material, has previously been provided to Parent or is provided to Parent reasonably promptly (but in no event later than one business day) after such information is provided to such Person, and (y) engage in discussions and negotiate with, such Potential Acquiror, its representatives, advisors and sources of debt or equity financing;  _provided_ , that in each case of the foregoing clauses (x) and (y), both (1) the Board of Directors of the Company has concluded, in good faith and after consultation with its outside legal counsel, that taking such action is required to comply with its fiduciary duties under applicable law and (2) the Company has provided Parent with notice of its intent to take any such action prior to taking such action and has complied with Section 6.3(d). As used herein, a " _Superior Proposal_ " means a bona fide written Acquisition Proposal (provided that for purposes of this definition, the references to "15% or more" in the definition of Acquisition Proposal shall be deemed replaced with references to "more than 50%," and the reference in clause (B) to the acquisition or purchase of an equity interest in any Subsidiaries of the Company shall be deleted) obtained without violation 

   ##### 

  

   

of this Agreement that (A) the Board of Directors of the Company determines
in good faith, after consultation with its independent financial advisor,
would result in a transaction that would be more favorable, from a financial
point of view, to the holders of Company Common Stock than the Merger (taking
into account the likelihood of consummation, the Person making the proposal
or offer, the form and amount of consideration offered and all other terms of
the proposal or offer, as well as any alterations to this Agreement proposed
by Parent in response thereto and any other factors deemed relevant by the
Board of Directors of the Company) and (B) is not subject to a financing
contingency. 

  

 (c) The Company shall notify Parent orally and in writing within one business day after receipt of any Acquisition Proposal or any inquiry or contact with respect to an Acquisition Proposal. The written notice shall include the material terms of the Acquisition Proposal or the inquiry or contact and, if in writing, shall include a copy of such Acquisition Proposal or related inquiry or contact. The Company shall keep Parent reasonably informed of the status of and any material changes with respect to such Acquisition Proposal, inquiry or contact and will provide Parent as soon as reasonably practicable (but in no event later than one business day) after receipt thereof copies of all correspondence and other written material sent or provided to the Company from any third party in connection therewith. The Company shall promptly notify Parent upon determination by the Board of Directors of the Company that an Acquisition Proposal is a Superior Proposal (except as set forth below). The Company shall not exercise its right to terminate this Agreement pursuant to Section 8.1(f) hereof until after the third business day following Parents receipt of written notice from the Company advising Parent that the Board of Directors of the Company has received a Superior Proposal, specifying the terms and conditions of the Superior Proposal and stating that the Board of Directors of the Company intends to exercise its right to terminate this Agreement pursuant to Section 8.1(f) (it being agreed and acknowledged that the Company shall not be required to provide Parent with more than 24 hours notice of any changes with respect to the terms of an Acquisition Proposal which the Company has advised Parent constitutes a Superior Proposal and any changes to the terms thereof shall not delay the Companys right to terminate this Agreement by more than 24 hours after the provision of notice to Parent). 

  

 (d) Subject to Parents rights under Section 8.1(d),nothing contained in this Section 6.3 shall prohibit the Company or its Board of Directors from taking and disclosing to the Companys stockholders a position with respect to a tender offer by a third party pursuant to Rules 14d-9 and 14e-2(a) promulgated under the Exchange Act or from making such disclosure to the Companys stockholders which, in the judgment of the Board of Directors of the Company after receiving advice of outside counsel, may be required under applicable law (it being agreed that the issuance by the Company or the Companys Board of Directors of a "stop, look and listen" statement pending disclosure of its position, as contemplated by Rules 14d-9 and 14e-2(a) promulgated under the Exchange Act shall not give rise to any termination right of Parent) . No change, 

   ##### 

  

   

withdrawal or modification in the recommendation of the Companys Board of
Directors to the Companys stockholders with respect to this Agreement or the
Merger shall change the approval of the Board of Directors of the Company for
purposes of causing any state takeover law (including Section 203 of the
DGCL) or other state law to be inapplicable to the Merger and the other
transactions contemplated by this Agreement. 

  

 Section 6.4 _Access to Information; Confidentiality_. Subject to restrictions of applicable law (including antitrust laws), the Company shall, and shall cause each of its Subsidiaries to, afford to Parent and to Parents Subsidiaries and their respective officers, employees, accountants, counsel, financial advisors, financing sources and other representatives (collectively, the " _Representatives_ "), upon reasonable notice, reasonable access during normal business hours during the period prior to the Effective Time to all their respective properties, facilities, agents, personnel, books, contracts, commitments and records and, during such period, the Company shall, and shall cause each of its Subsidiaries to, furnish reasonably promptly to Parent (a) a copy of each report, schedule, registration statement and other document filed or furnished by it during such period pursuant to the requirements of Federal or state securities laws and (b) all other information concerning its business, properties and personnel as Parent may reasonably request;  _provided_ , _however_ , that the Company may withhold the portions of such documents and information to the extent that the failure to so withhold such information would reasonably be expected to eliminate or waive the rights of such party to assert an attorney-client or attorney work product privilege with respect thereto or would violate the terms of a confidentiality agreement or obligation of non-disclosure in any agreement, contract or understanding with a third party in effect on the date of this Agreement ( _provided_ , that the Company shall use reasonable best efforts to obtain a waiver thereof if Parent so requests) or applicable laws, rules or regulations; and _provided_ _further_ that such investigation or access shall not unreasonably disrupt the Companys operations. No investigation made pursuant to this Section shall affect any representation or warranty in this Agreement or any condition to the obligations of the parties hereto to consummate the Merger. All information exchanged pursuant to this Section 6.4 shall be subject to the confidentiality agreement between the Company and Parent, dated May 9, 2007. In connection with the continuing operation of the business of the Company and the Companys Subsidiaries between the date hereof and the Effective Time, the Company shall consult in good faith on a regular and frequent basis with the Representatives of Parent and its Subsidiaries with regard to material operational developments and the general status of ongoing operations pursuant to procedures reasonably requested by Parent, its Subsidiaries or such Representatives, provided that such procedures are not unreasonably disruptive to the operations of the Company and shall not require disclosure of information not required to be disclosed by the preceding provisions of this Section.

 Section 6.5 _Reasonable Best Efforts; Notification_. 

  

 (a) Upon the terms and subject to the conditions set forth in this Agreement, each of the parties shall use its reasonable best efforts to take, or cause to be taken, all reasonable actions, and to do, or cause to be done, and to assist and cooperate with the other parties in doing, all things reasonably necessary, proper or advisable to consummate and make effective, in the most expeditious manner practicable, the Merger, including (i) the identification and obtaining of all necessary actions or nonactions, waivers, consents and approvals from Governmental Entities and the making of all necessary Registrations (including filings with Governmental Entities, if any) and the taking of all reasonable steps as may be necessary to obtain an approval or waiver from, or to avoid an action or proceeding by, any Governmental Entity, (ii) the obtaining of all necessary consents, approvals or waivers from third parties, including those set forth in Section 3.4(b) of the Disclosure Schedule, with each party bearing its costs for obtaining the waivers, approvals and consents referred to in clauses (i) and (ii) of this sentence, (iii) subject to Section 6.13, the defending of any lawsuits or other legal proceedings, whether judicial or administrative, challenging this Agreement or the consummation of the Merger, including, when reasonable, seeking to have any stay or temporary restraining order entered by any court or other Governmental Entity vacated or reversed, and (iv) the execution and delivery of any additional instruments necessary to consummate the Merger and to fully carry out the purposes of this Agreement; _provided_ , _however_ , that the obligations set forth in this sentence shall not be deemed to have been breached as a result of actions by the Company expressly permitted under Section 6.3. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Company and its Subsidiaries shall not be obligated to prepay or redeem debt (or notes), amend or waive the provisions of any Contract, or to pay any consent or similar fees or payments, or divest any assets or enter into commitments regarding the conduct of its business or licensing of technology or know-how, in each case unless such action is conditioned upon the consummation of the Merger. Without limitation of the foregoing, each of Parent and the Company undertakes and agrees (x) to file as soon as practicable, and in any event prior to 10 business days after the date hereof, a Notification and Report Form under the HSR Act with the United States Federal Trade Commission (the " _FTC_ ") and the Antitrust Division of the United States Department of Justice (the " _Antitrust Division_ ") and (y) promptly make all necessary registrations and filings, and thereafter make any other required submissions, with respect to this Agreement and the Merger required under (1) any applicable Federal or state securities laws, (2) any applicable competition, antitrust or investment laws of jurisdictions other than the United States and (3) any other applicable law; _provided_ , _however_ , that, subject to appropriate confidentiality protections, the Company and Parent will cooperate with each other in connection with the making of all such filings, including providing copies of all such filings and all attachments thereto to the non-filing party and its outside counsel. Each of Parent and the Company shall (i) respond as promptly as practicable to any inquiries received from the FTC or the Antitrust Division for additional information or documentation and to all inquiries and requests received from any State Attorney General 

   ##### 

  

   

or other Governmental Entity in connection with antitrust matters, and (ii)
not extend any waiting period under the HSR Act or enter into any agreement
with the FTC or the Antitrust Division not to consummate the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement, except with the prior written consent of the
other parties hereto. Each party shall (i) promptly notify the other party of
any written communication to that party from the FTC, the Antitrust Division,
any State Attorney General or any other Governmental Entity and, subject
to applicable law, permit the other party and its outside counsel to review
in advance any proposed written communication to any of the foregoing; (ii)
not agree to participate in any substantive meeting or discussion with any
governmental authority in respect of any filings, investigation or inquiry
concerning this Agreement or the Merger unless it consults with the other
party in advance and, to the extent permitted by such governmental authority,
gives the other party the opportunity to attend and participate thereat, in
each case to the extent reasonably practicable; and (iii) furnish as promptly
as reasonably practicable the other party with copies of all
correspondence, filings, and written communications (and a reasonable
explanation of the substance of oral communications) between them and their
affiliates and their respective representatives on the one hand, and any
government or regulatory authority or members or their respective staffs on
the other hand, with respect to this Agreement and the Merger. Without
limiting the foregoing, if any objections are asserted with respect to the
transactions contemplated hereby under any antitrust law, or if any suit or
proceeding is instituted or threatened by any Governmental Entity or any
private party challenging any of the transactions contemplated hereby
as violative of any antitrust law, the parties shall use their reasonable
best efforts promptly to resolve any such objections. At the request of
Parent, the Company shall agree to divest, hold separate or otherwise take or
commit to take any action that limits its freedom of action with respect to,
or its ability to retain, any of the businesses, services or assets of the
Company or any of its Subsidiaries, _provided_ _that_ any such action may be
conditioned upon the consummation of the Merger and the other transactions
contemplated by this Agreement. However, notwithstanding any contrary
provision of this Agreement, Parent shall not be required to make any such
request, nor shall Parent be required to agree to any prohibition, condition,
limitation or other requirement that (A) prohibits or materially limits the
ownership, operation or control by the Company, the Companys Subsidiaries,
the Surviving Corporation or Parent or any of their Affiliates of any
material portion of the business, operations or assets of the Company,
the Companys Subsidiaries, the Surviving Corporation, Parent or any of their
Affiliates, or compels the Company, the Companys Subsidiaries, the Surviving
Corporation, Parent or any of their Affiliates to dispose of or hold separate
any material portion of their business or assets as a result of the Merger,
(B) seeks to impose limitations on the ability of Parent to acquire, hold,
or exercise full rights of direct or indirect ownership of the Surviving
Corporation or any of the Companys material Subsidiaries, including the
right to vote the capital stock of the Surviving Corporation on all matters
properly presented to the stockholders of the Surviving Corporation and to
declare or pay dividends on any capital stock of the Surviving Corporation and
the Companys Subsidiaries, (C) would, individually or in the aggregate,
reasonably be 

   ##### 

  

   

expected to be materially adverse to the business, financial condition,
assets, liabilities or results of operations of Parent and its Subsidiaries
(other than the Company and its Subsidiaries after the Effective Time), taken
as a whole, with materiality for purposes of the foregoing being measured in
relation to the size and scale of the operations of the Company and its
Subsidiaries taken as a whole or (D) would, individually or in the aggregate,
reasonably be expected to result in a material adverse effect on the
business, financial condition, assets, liabilities or results of operations of
the Company and its Subsidiaries, taken as a whole (each of (A) through (D),
a " _Substantial Burden_ "). 

  

 (b) Each of the Company, Parent and Sub shall give notice as promptly as reasonably practicable to the other parties of (i) the occurrence or non-occurrence of any event the occurrence or non-occurrence of which would be likely to cause (A) any representation or warranty contained in this Agreement made by it (and in the case of Parent, made by Sub) to be untrue or inaccurate in any material respect or (B) any covenant, condition or agreement contained in this Agreement not to be complied with or satisfied by it (and in the case of Parent, by Sub) in any material respect; (ii) any written notice or other communication from any Governmental Entity in connection with the Merger; and (iii) in the case of the Company, any change or development that is reasonably likely to have a Material Adverse Effect or materially impair or delay the ability of the Company and its Subsidiaries to consummate the Merger or, in the case of Parent and Sub, any change or development that is reasonably likely to materially impair or delay the ability of Parent or Sub to consummate the Merger; _provided_ , _however_ , that the delivery or non-delivery of any notice pursuant to this Section 6.5(b) shall not limit or otherwise affect the remedies available hereunder to the party receiving such notice. 

  

 Section 6.6 _Benefit Plans_. (a) For the period starting at the Effective Time through December 31, 2007, Parent agrees to cause the Surviving Corporation (i) to maintain (x) the base salary or base wages of the employees of the Company and its Subsidiaries and (y) the Employee Benefit Plans (other than equity-based plans) in effect on the date of this Agreement, (ii) to provide compensation and employee benefits (other than equity-based plans) to each current employee of the Company and its Subsidiaries that are not materially less favorable in the aggregate to such employees than those benefits in effect for such employees on the date of this Agreement or (iii) to provide to such employees compensation and employee benefits that, as determined by Parent, are not materially less favorable in the aggregate than those in effect for similarly situated employees of Parent and its subsidiaries. Nothing in this Agreement shall be construed to limit the ability of the applicable employer to terminate the employment of any employee at any time. 

  

 (b) From and after the Effective Time, Parent shall cause the Company or the Surviving Corporation, as applicable, to honor in accordance with their respective terms (as in effect on the date of this Agreement), all the Companys employment, severance, change in control, retention, transition and termination agreements, plans and 

   ##### 

  

   

policies disclosed in Section 3.11 of the Disclosure Schedule, including any
change in control provisions contained therein, subject to the right of
Parent and the Surviving Corporation to modify or terminate such agreements,
plans and policies in accordance with their terms. In addition, the Surviving
Corporation shall assume the obligations of the Company under all existing
indemnification agreements disclosed in Section 3.21(a)(viii) of the
Disclosure Schedule between the Company and its directors, officers
and employees that survive the Merger in accordance with their terms. 

  

 (c) Parent and the Company each hereby acknowledge and agree that (i) following the Effective Time, each of the executives listed in Section 6.6(c) of the Company Disclosure Schedule may terminate his or her employment with the Company and such termination will be deemed to have been following a "Change of Control" and for "Good Reason" (as such terms are defined in the executives change of control or employment agreements with the Company), (ii) that, upon such termination of employment, each such executive shall become entitled to receive the severance pay and other payments required by the contracts listed on Section 6.6(c) of the Disclosure Schedule upon a termination of employment following a "Change of Control" for "Good Reason", and (iii) any such severance pay and other payments to which such executives are entitled shall be paid in accordance with the terms of the relevant agreement. 

  

 (d) To the extent that employees of the Company and its Subsidiaries become eligible to participate in any employee benefit plan, program or arrangement maintained by Parent or any of its Subsidiaries (including any severance plan), then for purposes of eligibility to participate and vesting, service with the Company or any of its Subsidiaries (including credit for service with Deluxe Corporation or any of its Subsidiaries) prior to the Effective Time shall be treated as service with Parent or any of its Subsidiaries; _provided_ , _however_ , that such service need not be recognized to the extent that such recognition would result in any duplication of benefits or such service would not be counted under the terms of the applicable plan for similarly situated employees of Parent. In addition, all such plans which are welfare benefit plans shall waive any pre-existing conditions, actively-at-work exclusions and waiting periods with respect to participation by and coverage of such employees to the extent such conditions, exclusions and waiting periods were satisfied or waived under the applicable Company welfare benefit plan and shall provide that any expenses, co-payments, and deductibles paid or incurred during the applicable plan year on or before the Effective Time by or on behalf of any such employees shall be taken into account under applicable Parent benefit plans for purposes of satisfying applicable deductible, coinsurance and maximum out-of-pocket provisions. 

  

 (e) On and after the date hereof, no future offering periods will be commenced under the Companys Employee Stock Purchase Plan. The Company shall terminate the Employee Stock Purchase Plan immediately prior to the Effective Time. With respect to the offering period in progress as of the date hereof, no new participants 

   ##### 

  

   

shall be permitted to commence participation in the plan, no current
participant shall be permitted to increase his or her contributions to the
plan, and, at the earlier of the conclusion of the offering period and
immediately prior to the Effective Time, accumulated contributions will be
applied to the purchase of Common Stock in accordance with the plans terms
(and such Common Stock will be converted into the Merger Consideration in
accordance with Section 2.1). 

  

 (f) The provisions of this Section 6.6 are for the sole benefit of the parties to this Agreement and nothing herein, expressed or implied, is intended or shall be construed to confer upon or give to any Person (including for the avoidance of doubt any employees of the Company and its Subsidiaries), other than the parties hereto and their respective permitted successors and assigns, any legal or equitable or other rights or remedies, with respect to the matters provided for in this Section 6.6 under or by reason of any provision of this Agreement. This Section 6.6 shall not be considered, or deemed to be, an amendment to any Employee Benefit Plans or any other agreements 

  

 Section 6.7 _Fees and Expenses._ (a) All fees and expenses incurred in connection with the Merger and the other transactions contemplated by this Agreement shall be paid by the party incurring such fees or expenses, whether or not the Merger is consummated, except that those fees and expenses incurred in connection with printing and filing the Proxy Statement (but not the preparation thereof) shall be shared equally by Parent and the Company. 

  

 (b) Subject to Section 6.7(d), the Company agrees to pay Parent a fee equal to $55,000,000 and the Expenses (which Expenses in each case shall be payable on demand following the date of termination of this Agreement) if: 

  

 (i) this Agreement is terminated by Parent pursuant to Section 8.1(d) (in which case, the fee shall be payable within two business days after such termination); 

   

 (ii) this Agreement is terminated by the Company pursuant to Section 8.1(f) (in which case, the fee shall be payable at the time of termination); or 

   

 (iii) (x) this Agreement is terminated by Parent pursuant to Section 8.1(c) or by either Parent or the Company pursuant to Section 8.1(b)(i) or 8.1(b)(iii), and, in all such cases, the event giving rise to the right to terminate occurred at a time when an Acquisition Proposal (which, for purposes of this Section 6.7(b)(iii), shall have the meaning set forth in the definition of Acquisition Proposal contained in Section 6.3(a), except that the reference to 15% in Section 6.3(a)(i)(A) shall be deemed a reference to 30% and, in Section 6.3(a)(i)(B), the reference to 15% with respect to acquisitions of voting securities shall be deemed a reference to 50% and the reference to 15% with respect to the ownership of assets shall be deemed a reference to 30%) had been made (other than by Parent or its affiliates) and not withdrawn (in which case, the 

  ##### 

  

   

 Expenses shall be payable whether or not an event described in the following clause (y) occurs) and (y) within 12 months after such termination either the Company or a Subsidiary of the Company has entered into a definitive agreement relating to an Acquisition Proposal or a transaction contemplated by an Acquisition Proposal has been consummated (in which case, the fee shall be payable within two business days after such event). 

   

 (c) The fee and Expenses payable pursuant to Section 6.7(b) shall be made by wire transfer of same day funds. The Company acknowledges that the agreements contained in Section 6.7(b) are an integral part of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, and that, without these agreements, Parent and Sub would not enter into this Agreement; accordingly, if the Company fails to promptly pay the amount due pursuant to Section 6.7(b), and, in order to obtain such payment, Parent or Sub commences a suit which results in a binding nonappealable judgment rendered by a court of competent jurisdiction against the Company for the fee or Expenses set forth in this paragraph (b) the Company shall pay to Parent or Sub its costs and expenses (including attorneys fees) in connection with such suit. 

  

 (d) As used herein, " _Expenses_ " means Parents documented out-of-pocket expenses paid or payable to any third party in connection with this Agreement and the transactions contemplated hereby (including all attorneys, accountants and investment bankers fees and expenses), but not to exceed $5,000,000. 

  

 (e) Parent agrees that the payment provided for in Section 6.7(b) shall be the sole and exclusive remedy of Parent upon termination of this Agreement under circumstances giving rise to an obligation (or potential obligation) of the Company to pay the amounts set forth in Section 6.7(b) and such remedy shall be limited to the aggregate of the sums stipulated in such Section 6.7(b);  _provided_ , _however_ , that nothing herein shall relieve any party from liability for the willful breach of any of its representations, warranties, covenants or agreements set forth in this Agreement.

Further, subject, for the avoidance of doubt, to the last sentence of this Section 6.14, in connection with the Financing, the Company shall make any reasonable representations and warranties customary in commercial bank financings to, and enter into any reasonable covenants for the benefit of, third parties providing or arranging any Financing, in each case effective as of the Closing Date; _provided_ , _however_ , that in no event shall the Company, any of its Subsidiaries or any of their respective officers be required to make any representations or warranties or otherwise provide information which they in good faith determine is not accurate or is otherwise false or misleading.

 (ii) if any Governmental Entity issues an order, decree or ruling or takes any other action permanently enjoining, restraining or otherwise prohibiting the consummation of the Merger and such order, decree, ruling or other action shall have become final and nonappealable and would result in a failure to satisfy the condition set forth in Section 7.1(b) of this Agreement, _provided_   _that_ the right to terminate this Agreement pursuant to this Section 8.1(b)(ii) shall not be available to any party which has not used its commercially reasonable best efforts to cause such order, decree, or ruling to be lifted or otherwise taken action necessary to comply with Section 6.5; or

result of which a condition set forth in Section 7.2(a) or 7.2(b) would not
have been satisfied prior to or as of the Termination Date and, in any such
case, such breach (if curable) has not been cured within 30 days after notice

 Section 8.3 _Amendment_. This Agreement may be amended by the parties at any time before or after receipt of the Stockholder Approval; _provided_ , _however_ , that after receipt of the Stockholder Approval, there shall be made no amendment that by law requires further approval by the stockholders of the Company without the further approval of such stockholders; and  _provided_ , _further_ , that after this Agreement is adopted by the Companys stockholders, no such amendment or modification shall be made that reduces the amount or changes the form of Merger Consideration or otherwise materially and adversely affects the rights of the Companys stockholders hereunder, without the further approval of such stockholders.

Any agreement on the part of a party to any such extension or waiver shall be valid only if set forth in an instrument in writing signed on behalf of such party.

 Section 8.5 _Procedure for Termination, Amendment, Extension or Waiver_. A termination of this Agreement pursuant to Section 8.1, an amendment of this Agreement pursuant to Section 8.3 or an extension or waiver pursuant to Section 8.4 shall, in order to be effective, require in the case of Parent, Sub or the Company, action by its Board of Directors or the duly authorized designee of its Board of Directors.
