appoint a paying agent reasonably acceptable to the Company (the &#147;<B>Paying
Agent</B>&#148;) to act as the agent for the purpose of paying the Merger
Consideration for: (i) the Certificates; and (ii) Book-Entry Shares. In
connection therewith, the parties shall enter into an agreement with the Paying
Agent in a form reasonably acceptable to Parent and the Company. On or before
the Effective Time, Parent shall deposit, or cause Merger Sub to deposit, with
the Paying Agent, sufficient funds to pay the aggregate Merger Consideration
that is payable in respect of all of the Company Shares represented by the
Certificates and the Book-Entry Shares (other than: (A) shares to be cancelled

amounts to which holders of shares shall be entitled under Section 2.01(b),
Parent shall take all steps necessary to enable or cause the Surviving
Corporation promptly to deposit in trust additional cash with the Paying Agent
sufficient to make all payments required under this Agreement. The Payment Fund
shall not be used for any other purpose. The Surviving Corporation shall pay all
charges and expenses, including those of the Paying Agent, in connection with

<U>Procedures for Surrender; No Interest</U>. Each holder of Company Shares that
have been converted into the right to receive the Merger Consideration shall be
entitled to receive the Merger Consideration in respect of the Company Shares
represented by a Certificate or Book-Entry Share upon: (i) surrender to the
Paying Agent of a Certificate (or an affidavit of loss in lieu thereof pursuant
to Section 2.06), together with a duly completed and validly executed Letter of
Transmittal and such other documents as may reasonably be requested by the
Paying Agent; or (ii) receipt of an &#147;agent&#146;s message&#148; by the Paying Agent (or
such other evidence, if any, of transfer as the Paying Agent may reasonably
request) in the case of Book-Entry Shares. Until so surrendered or transferred,
as the case may be, and subject to the terms set forth in Section 2.03, each
such Certificate or Book-Entry Share, as applicable, shall represent after the
Effective Time for all purposes only the right to receive the Merger
Consideration payable in respect thereof. No interest shall be paid or accrued
on the Merger Consideration payable upon the surrender of any Certificate (or an
affidavit of loss in lieu thereof pursuant to Section 2.06) or transfer of any
Book-Entry Share. Upon payment of the Merger Consideration pursuant to the
provisions of this ARTICLE II, each Certificate or Certificates or Book-Entry
Share or Book-Entry Shares so surrendered or transferred, as the case may be,
shall immediately be cancelled. </P>

obligations of or fully guaranteed by the United States or any agency or
instrumentality thereof and backed by the full faith and credit of the United
States with a maturity of no more than 30 days; (ii) commercial paper
obligations rated A-1 or P-1 or better by Moody&#146;s Investors Service, Inc. or

deposit, bank repurchase agreements, or banker&#146;s acceptances of commercial banks
with capital exceeding $1,000,000,000 (based on the most recent financial
statements of such bank that are then publicly available). No losses with
respect to any investments of the Payment Fund will affect the amounts payable
to the holders of Certificates or Book-Entry Shares. Any income from investment
of the Payment Fund will be payable to Parent or the Surviving Corporation, as
Parent directs. </P>

shall be properly endorsed or shall otherwise be in proper form for transfer or
such Book-Entry Share shall be properly transferred; and (ii) the Person
requesting such payment shall pay to the Paying Agent any transfer or other Tax
required as a result of such payment to a Person other than the registered

pertaining to the Company Shares formerly represented by such Certificate or
Book-Entry Shares, and from and after the Effective Time, there shall be no
further registration of transfers of Company Shares on the stock transfer books
of the Surviving Corporation. If, after the Effective Time, Certificates or

cancelled and exchanged for the Merger Consideration provided for, and in

unclaimed by the holders of Company Shares nine (9) months after the Effective
Time shall be returned to Parent, upon demand, and any such holder who has not
exchanged Company Shares for the Merger Consideration in accordance with this
Section 2.02 prior to that time shall thereafter look only to Parent (subject to
abandoned property, escheat, or other similar Laws), as general creditors

the Merger Consideration in accordance with Section 2.01(b), without interest
thereon, upon surrender of such Certificate formerly representing such share or

Parent prompt written notice of any demands received by the Company for
appraisal of Company Shares, any waiver or withdrawal of any such demand, and
any other demand, notice, or instrument delivered to the Company prior to the
Effective Time that relates to such demand, and Parent shall have the

have entered into this Agreement. Each of the parties hereto acknowledges that
each of the Company Termination Fee and the Parent Termination Fee is not a
penalty, but is liquidated damages in a reasonable amount that will compensate
Parent or the Company, as applicable, in the circumstances in which such fee is
payable for the efforts and resources expended and opportunities foregone while
negotiating this Agreement and in reliance on this Agreement and on the
expectation of the consummation of the Transactions, which amount would
otherwise be impossible to calculate with precision. If the Company, on the one

amounts due pursuant to this Section 7.06, and, in order to obtain such payment,
the other party makes a claim against the non-paying party that results in a
judgment against the non-paying party for such amounts, the non-paying party
shall pay to the other party the reasonable costs and expenses (including its
reasonable attorneys&#146; fees and expenses) incurred or accrued in connection with
such suit, together with interest on the amounts set forth in this Section 7.06
at the prime lending rate prevailing during such period as published in <I>The

hereunder shall be calculated on a daily basis from the date such amounts were

<P align=center><B>Indemnification </B></P>
<P
align=justify>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A. <U>Nature of Indemnity</U>. Each person who was or is made a party or is
  threatened to be made a party to or is involved in any action, suit or
  proceeding, whether civil, criminal, administrative or investigative (a
  "<U>Proceeding</U>"), by reason of the fact that he or she (or a person of whom
  he or she is the legal representative), is or was a director or officer of the
  Corporation or is or was serving at the request of the Corporation as a
  director, officer, employee, fiduciary or agent of another corporation or of a
  partnership, joint venture, trust or other enterprise, including service with
  respect to employee benefit plans, whether the basis of such Proceeding is
  alleged action in an official capacity as a director, officer, employee,
  fiduciary or agent or in any other capacity while serving as a director,
  officer, employee, fiduciary or agent, shall be indemnified and held harmless by
  the Corporation to the fullest extent which it is empowered to do so by the
  General Corporation Law of the State of Delaware, as the same exists or may
  hereafter be amended (but, in the case of any such amendment, only to the extent
  that such amendment permits the Corporation to provide broader indemnification
  rights than said law permitted the Corporation to provide prior to such
  amendment) against all expense, liability and loss (including attorneys' fees
  actually and reasonably incurred by such person in connection with such
  Proceeding) and such indemnification shall inure to the benefit of his or her
  heirs, executors and administrators; <I>provided</I>, <I>however</I>, that
  except as provided in Section B of this Article VIII, the Corporation shall
  indemnify any such person seeking indemnification in connection with a
  Proceeding initiated by such person only if such Proceeding was authorized by
  the Board of Directors. The right to indemnification conferred in this Article
  VIII shall be a contract right and, subject to Sections B and E of this Article
  VIII, shall include the right to payment by the Corporation of the expenses
  incurred in defending any such Proceeding in advance of its final disposition.
  The Corporation may, by action of the Board of Directors, provide
  indemnification to employees and agent of the Corporation with the same scope
  and effect as the foregoing indemnification of directors and officers. </P>

<A name=page_EB3></A>
<P align=justify>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;B. <u>Procedure for Indemnification of Directors and Officers</u>. Any
  indemnification of a director or officer of the Corporation under Section A of
  this Article VIII or advancement of expenses under Section E of this Article VIII shall be made
  promptly, and in any event within thirty (30) days, upon the written request of
  the director or officer. If a determination by the Corporation that the director
  or officer is entitled to indemnification pursuant to this Article VIII is
  required, and the Corporation fails to respond within sixty (60) days to a
  written request for indemnity, the Corporation shall be deemed to have approved
  the request. If the Corporation denies a written request for indemnification or
  advancement of expenses, in whole or in part, or if payment in full pursuant to
  such request is not made within thirty (30) days, the right to indemnification
  or advancement of expenses as granted by this Article VIII shall be enforceable
  by the director or officer in any court of competent jurisdiction. Such person's
  costs and expenses incurred in connection with successfully establishing his or
  her right to indemnification, in whole or in part, in any such action shall also
  be indemnified by the Corporation. It shall be a defense to any such action
  (other than an action brought to enforce a claim for expenses incurred in
  defending any Proceeding in advance of its final disposition where the required
  undertaking, if any, has been tendered to the Corporation) that the claimant has
  not met the standards of conduct which make it permissible under the General
  Corporation Law of the State of Delaware for the Corporation to indemnify the
  claimant for the amount claimed, but the burden of such defense shall be on the
  Corporation. Neither the failure of the Corporation (including the Board of
  Directors, independent legal counsel or its stockholders) to have made a
  determination prior to the commencement of such action that indemnification of
  the claimant is proper in the circumstances because he or she has met the
  applicable standards of conduct set forth in the General Corporation Law of the
  State of Delaware, nor an actual determination by the Corporation (including the
  Board of Directors, independent legal counsel or its stockholders) that the
  claimant has not met such applicable standards of conduct, shall be a defense to
  the action or create a presumption that the claimant has not met the applicable
  standards of conduct. </P>
<P
align=justify>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;C. <U>Non-exclusivity of Article VIII</U>. The rights to indemnification and the
  payment of expenses incurred in defending a Proceeding in advance of its final
  disposition conferred in this Article VIII shall not be exclusive of any other
  right which any person may or hereafter acquire under any statute, provision of
  this Certificate of Incorporation, By-Law, agreement, vote of stockholders or
  disinterested directors or otherwise.</P>
<P
align=justify>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;D. <U>Insurance</U>. The Corporation may purchase and maintain insurance on its own
  behalf and on behalf of any person who is or was a director, officer, employee,
  fiduciary or agent of the Corporation or was serving at the request of the
  Corporation as a director, officer, employee, fiduciary or agent of another
  corporation, partnership, joint venture, trust or other enterprise against any
  liability asserted against him or her and incurred by him or her in any such
  capacity, whether or not the Corporation would have the power to indemnify such
  person against such liability under this Article VIII. </P>
<P
align=justify>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;E. <U>Expenses</U>. Expenses incurred by any person described in Section A of this
  Article VIII in defending a Proceeding shall be paid by the Corporation in
  advance of such Proceeding's final disposition unless otherwise determined by
  the Board of Directors in the specific case upon receipt of an undertaking by or
  on behalf of the director or officer to repay such amount if it shall ultimately
  be determined that he or she is not entitled to be indemnified by the
  Corporation. Such expenses incurred by other employees and agents may be so paid
  upon such terms and conditions, if any, as the Board of Directors deems
  appropriate. </P>

<P
align=justify>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;F. <U>Employees and Agents</U>. Persons who are not covered by the foregoing
  provisions of this Article VIII and who are or were employees or agents of the
  Corporation, or who are or were serving at the request of the Corporation as
  employees or agents of another corporation, partnership, joint venture, trust or
  other enterprise, may be indemnified to the extent authorized at any time or
  from time to time by the Board of Directors. </P>
<P align=center><B>ARTICLE IX </B></P>
<P align=center><B>Limitations on Directors' Liability </B></P>
<P
align=justify>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A
  director of the Corporation shall not be personally liable to the Corporation or
  its stockholders for monetary damages for breach of fiduciary duty as a
  director, except: (i) for any breach of the director's duty of loyalty to the
  Corporation or its stockholders, (ii) for acts or omissions that are not in good
  faith or that involve intentional misconduct or a knowing violation of law,
  (iii) under Section 174 of the General Corporation Law of the State of Delaware
  or (iv) for any transaction from which the director derived any improper
  personal benefit. If the General Corporation Law of the State of Delaware or
  other Delaware law is amended or enacted after the date of filing of this
  Certificate of Incorporation to further limit or eliminate the personal
  liability of directors, then the liability of a director of the Corporation
  shall be limited or eliminated to the fullest extent permitted by the General
  Corporation Law of the State of Delaware, as so amended, or such other Delaware
  law. Any repeal or modification of the foregoing paragraph by the stockholders
  of the Corporation shall not adversely affect any right or protection of a
  director of the Corporation existing at the time of such repeal or
  modification.</P>
