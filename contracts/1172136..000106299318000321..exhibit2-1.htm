any event, within three Business Days) after the satisfaction or, to the
extent permitted hereunder, waiver of all conditions to the Merger set forth

permitted hereunder, waiver of all such conditions), unless this Agreement

make all other filings or recordings required under the DGCL. The Merger will
become effective at such time as the Certificate of Merger has been duly
filed with the Secretary of State of the State of Delaware or at such
later date or time as may be agreed by the Company and Parent in writing and
specified in the Certificate of Merger in accordance with the DGCL (the
effective time of the Merger being hereinafter referred to as the "Effective
Time").

  Section 1.04 _Effects of the Merger_. The Merger shall
have the effects set forth herein and in the applicable provisions of the
DGCL. Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, and subject thereto,
from and after the Effective Time, all property, rights,
privileges, immunities, powers, franchises, licenses, and authority of the
Company and Merger Sub shall vest in the Surviving Corporation, and all
debts, liabilities, obligations, restrictions, and duties of each of the
Company and Merger Sub shall become the debts, liabilities, obligations,
restrictions, and duties of the Surviving Corporation.

  Section 1.05 _Certificate of Incorporation; Bylaws_. At
the Effective Time: (a) the certificate of incorporation of the Surviving
Corporation shall be amended and restated so as to read in its entirety as

amended in accordance with the terms thereof or as provided by applicable
Law; and (b) the bylaws of Merger Sub as in effect immediately prior to the
Effective Time shall be the bylaws of the Surviving Corporation, except that
references to Merger Subs name shall be replaced with references to
the Surviving Corporations name, until thereafter amended in accordance with
the terms thereof, the certificate of incorporation of the Surviving
Corporation, or as provided by applicable Law (and subject to Section 5.08) .

  Section 1.06 _Directors and Officers_.

 

 (a)  The directors of Merger Sub immediately prior to the Effective Time shall be the directors of the Surviving Corporation, as of and immediately following the Effective Time, until their respective successors are duly elected or appointed and qualified or their earlier death, resignation or removal in accordance with the certificate of incorporation and bylaws of the Surviving Corporation. 

 

 (b)  The officers of Merger Sub immediately prior to the Effective Time shall be the officers of the Surviving Corporation, as of and immediately following the Effective Time, until their respective successors are duly appointed and qualified or their earlier death, resignation or removal in accordance with the certificate of incorporation and bylaws of the Surviving Corporation. 

 

ARTICLE II

 

 _EFFECT OF THE MERGER ON CAPITAL STOCK_

  Section 2.01 _Effect of the Merger on Capital Stock_.
At the Effective Time, as a result of the Merger and without any action on
the part of Parent, Merger Sub, or the Company or the holder of any capital
stock of Parent, Merger Sub, or the Company:

  (a)   _Cancellation of Certain Company Shares; Treatment of Stock Held by Company_ _Subsidiaries_. Each Company Share that is owned by Parent, Merger Sub, or the Company (as treasury stock or otherwise) or any of their respective direct or indirect wholly-owned Subsidiaries as of immediately prior to the Effective Time will automatically be cancelled and retired and will cease to exist, and no consideration will be delivered in exchange therefor. Any Company Shares owned by any direct or indirect wholly-owned Subsidiary of the Company shall not represent the right to receive the Merger Consideration and shall be cancelled. 

 

 (b)   _Conversion of Company Shares_. Each Company Share issued and outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time (other than: (i) shares to be cancelled and retired in accordance with Section 2.01(a); and (ii) Dissenting Shares) will be automatically converted into the right to receive an amount in cash equal to the Offer Price (as defined herein), without interest (the "Merger Consideration"). 

 

 (c)   _Cancellation of Shares_. At the Effective Time, all Company Shares will no longer be outstanding and all Company Shares will be cancelled and retired and will cease to exist, and, subject to Section 2.03, each holder of: (i) a certificate formerly representing any Company Shares (each, a "Certificate"); or (ii) any book-entry shares which immediately prior to the Effective Time represented Company Shares (each, a "Book-Entry Share") will cease to have any rights with respect thereto, except the right to receive the Merger Consideration in accordance with Section 2.02 hereof (or in the case of any Dissenting Shares, as otherwise provided in Section 2.03) . 

 

 (d)   _Conversion of Merger Sub Capital Stock_. Each issued and outstanding share of capital stock of Merger Sub shall be converted into and become one validly issued, fully paid and non-assessable share of common stock, par value $0.001 per share, of the Surviving Corporation with the same rights, powers, and privileges as the shares so converted and shall constitute the only outstanding shares of capital stock of the Surviving Corporation. From and after the Effective Time, all certificates representing shares of Merger Sub common stock shall be deemed for all purposes to represent the number of shares of common stock of the Surviving Corporation into which they were converted in accordance with the immediately preceding sentence.

  Section 2.02 _Surrender and Payment_. 

 

 (a)   _Paying Agent; Payment Fund_. Prior to the Effective Time, Parent shall appoint a paying agent reasonably acceptable to the Company (the "Paying Agent") to act as the agent for the purpose of paying the Merger Consideration for: (i) the Certificates; and (ii) Book-Entry Shares. In connection therewith, the parties shall enter into an agreement with the Paying Agent in a form reasonably acceptable to Parent and the Company. On or before the Effective Time, Parent shall deposit, or cause Merger Sub to deposit, with the Paying Agent, sufficient funds to pay the aggregate Merger Consideration that is payable in respect of all of the Company Shares represented by the Certificates and the Book-Entry Shares (other than: (A) shares to be cancelled and retired in accordance with Section 2.01(a); and (B) Dissenting Shares) (the "Payment Fund") in amounts and at the times necessary for such payments. If for any reason (including losses) the Payment Fund is inadequate to pay the amounts to which holders of shares shall be entitled under Section 2.01(b), Parent shall take all steps necessary to enable or cause the Surviving Corporation promptly to deposit in trust additional cash with the Paying Agent sufficient to make all payments required under this Agreement. The Payment Fund shall not be used for any other purpose. The Surviving Corporation shall pay all charges and expenses, including those of the Paying Agent, in connection with the exchange of Company Shares for the Merger Consideration. Promptly after the Effective Time (but in any event not later than three Business Days after the Effective Time), Parent shall send, or shall cause the Paying Agent to send, to each record holder of Company Shares at the Effective Time, a letter of transmittal and instructions (which shall specify that the delivery shall be effected, and risk of loss and title shall pass, only upon proper delivery of the Certificates (or affidavits of loss in lieu thereof pursuant to Section 2.06) or transfer of the Book-Entry Shares to the Paying Agent, and which letter of transmittal will be in customary form and have such other provisions as Parent and the Surviving Corporation may reasonably specify) for use in such exchange (the "Letter of Transmittal"). 

  (b)   _Procedures for Surrender; No Interest_. Each holder of Company Shares that have been converted into the right to receive the Merger Consideration shall be entitled to receive the Merger Consideration in respect of the Company Shares represented by a Certificate or Book-Entry Share upon: (i) surrender to the Paying Agent of a Certificate (or an affidavit of loss in lieu thereof pursuant to Section 2.06), together with a duly completed and validly executed Letter of Transmittal and such other documents as may reasonably be requested by the Paying Agent; or (ii) receipt of an "agents message" by the Paying Agent (or such other evidence, if any, of transfer as the Paying Agent may reasonably request) in the case of Book-Entry Shares. Until so surrendered or transferred, as the case may be, and subject to the terms set forth in Section 2.03, each such Certificate or Book-Entry Share, as applicable, shall represent after the Effective Time for all purposes only the right to receive the Merger Consideration payable in respect thereof. No interest shall be paid or accrued on the Merger Consideration payable upon the surrender of any Certificate (or an affidavit of loss in lieu thereof pursuant to Section 2.06) or transfer of any Book-Entry Share. Upon payment of the Merger Consideration pursuant to the provisions of this ARTICLE II, each Certificate or Certificates or Book-Entry Share or Book-Entry Shares so surrendered or transferred, as the case may be, shall immediately be cancelled. 

 

 (c)   _Investment of Payment Fund_. Until disbursed in accordance with the terms and conditions of this Agreement, the cash in the Payment Fund will be invested by the Paying Agent, as directed by Parent or the Surviving Corporation, in: (i) obligations of or fully guaranteed by the United States or any agency or instrumentality thereof and backed by the full faith and credit of the United States with a maturity of no more than 30 days; (ii) commercial paper obligations rated A-1 or P-1 or better by Moodys Investors Service, Inc. or Standard and Poors Corporation, respectively; or (iii) certificates of deposit, bank repurchase agreements, or bankers acceptances of commercial banks with capital exceeding $1,000,000,000 (based on the most recent financial statements of such bank that are then publicly available). No losses with respect to any investments of the Payment Fund will affect the amounts payable to the holders of Certificates or Book-Entry Shares. Any income from investment of the Payment Fund will be payable to Parent or the Surviving Corporation, as Parent directs. 

 

 (d)   _Payments to Non-Registered Holders_. If any portion of the Merger Consideration is to be paid to a Person other than the Person in whose name the surrendered Certificate or the transferred Book-Entry Share, as applicable, is registered, it shall be a condition to such payment that: (i) such Certificate shall be properly endorsed or shall otherwise be in proper form for transfer or such Book-Entry Share shall be properly transferred; and (ii) the Person requesting such payment shall pay to the Paying Agent any transfer or other Tax required as a result of such payment to a Person other than the registered holder of such Certificate or Book-Entry Share, as applicable, or establish to the reasonable satisfaction of the Paying Agent that such Tax has been paid or is not payable. 

 

 (e)   _Full Satisfaction_. All Merger Consideration paid upon the surrender of Certificates or transfer of Book-Entry Shares in accordance with the terms hereof shall be deemed to have been paid in full satisfaction of all rights pertaining to the Company Shares formerly represented by such Certificate or Book-Entry Shares, and from and after the Effective Time, there shall be no further registration of transfers of Company Shares on the stock transfer books of the Surviving Corporation. If, after the Effective Time, Certificates or Book-Entry Shares are presented to the Surviving Corporation, they shall be cancelled and exchanged for the Merger Consideration provided for, and in accordance with the procedures set forth, in this ARTICLE II. 

 

 (f)   _Termination of Payment Fund_. Any portion of the Payment Fund that remains unclaimed by the holders of Company Shares nine (9) months after the Effective Time shall be returned to Parent, upon demand, and any such holder who has not exchanged Company Shares for the Merger Consideration in accordance with this Section 2.02 prior to that time shall thereafter look only to Parent (subject to abandoned property, escheat, or other similar Laws), as general creditors thereof, for payment of the Merger Consideration without any interest. Notwithstanding the foregoing, Parent shall not be liable to any holder of Company Shares for any amounts paid to a public official pursuant to applicable abandoned property, escheat, or similar Laws.

  (g)   _Dissenting Shares Merger Consideration_. Any portion of the Merger Consideration made available to the Paying Agent in respect of any Dissenting Shares shall be returned to Parent, upon demand. 

  Section 2.03 _Dissenting Shares_. Notwithstanding any
provision of this Agreement to the contrary, including Section 2.01, Company
Shares issued and outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time (other
than shares cancelled in accordance with Section 2.01(a)) and held by a
holder who has not voted in favor of adoption of this Agreement or consented
thereto in writing and who is entitled to demand and has properly exercised
appraisal rights of such shares in accordance with Section 262 of the DGCL
(such Company Shares being referred to collectively as the
"Dissenting Shares" until such time as such holder fails to perfect or
otherwise waives, withdraws, or loses such holders appraisal rights under
the DGCL with respect to such shares) shall not be converted into a right to
receive the Merger Consideration, but instead shall be entitled to only such
rights as are granted by Section 262 of the DGCL; _provided, however_ , that
if, after the Effective Time, such holder fails to perfect, waives,
withdraws, or loses such holders right to appraisal pursuant to Section 262
of the DGCL or if a court of competent jurisdiction shall determine that such
holder is not entitled to the relief provided by Section 262 of the DGCL,
such Company Shares shall be treated as if they had been converted as of the
Effective Time into the right to receive the Merger Consideration in
accordance with Section 2.01(b), without interest thereon, upon surrender of
such Certificate formerly representing such share or transfer of such Book-
Entry Share, as the case may be. The Company shall provide Parent prompt
written notice of any demands received by the Company for appraisal of
Company Shares, any waiver or withdrawal of any such demand, and any other
demand, notice, or instrument delivered to the Company prior to the Effective
Time that relates to such demand, and Parent shall have the opportunity and
right to direct all negotiations and proceedings with respect to such
demands. Except with the prior written consent of Parent, the Company
shall not make any payment with respect to, or settle, or offer to settle,
any such demands.

  Section 2.04 _Adjustments_. Without limiting the other
provisions of this Agreement, if at any time during the period between the
date of this Agreement and the Effective Time, any change in the outstanding
shares of capital stock of the Company shall occur (other than the issuance
of additional shares of capital stock of the Company as permitted by this
Agreement), including by reason of any reclassification, recapitalization,
stock split (including reverse stock split), or combination, exchange,
readjustment of shares, or similar transaction, or any stock dividend or
distribution paid in stock, the Merger Consideration and any other
amounts payable pursuant to this Agreement shall be appropriately adjusted to
reflect such change; _provided, however_ , that this sentence shall not be
construed to permit the Company to take any action with respect to its
securities that is prohibited by the terms of this Agreement.

  Section 2.05 _Withholding Rights_. Each of the Paying
Agent, Parent, Merger Sub, and the Surviving Corporation shall be entitled to
deduct and withhold from the consideration otherwise payable to any Person
pursuant to this Agreement such amounts as may be required to be deducted and
withheld with respect to the making of such payment under any Tax Laws and to
require the delivery of necessary Tax forms and any other
required information. To the extent that amounts are so deducted and withheld
by the Paying Agent, Parent, Merger Sub, or the Surviving Corporation, as the
case may be, such amounts shall be treated for all purposes of this Agreement
as having been paid to the Person in respect of which the Paying Agent,
Parent, Merger Sub, or the Surviving Corporation, as the case may be, made
such deduction and withholding. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Parties
agree that no amounts shall be withheld from the consideration payable to any
Person pursuant to this Agreement under Section 1445 of the Code.

  Section 2.06 _Lost Certificates_. If any Certificate
shall have been lost, stolen, or destroyed, upon the making of an affidavit
of that fact by the Person claiming such Certificate to be lost, stolen, or
destroyed and, if required by Parent, the posting by such Person of a bond,
in such reasonable amount as Parent may direct, as indemnity against
any claim that may be made against it with respect to such Certificate, the
Paying Agent will issue, in exchange for such lost, stolen, or destroyed
Certificate, the Merger Consideration to be paid in respect of the Company
Shares formerly represented by such Certificate as contemplated under this
ARTICLE II.

  Section 2.07 _Treatment of Stock Options_.

  (a)  At or prior to the Effective Time, the Company shall take all actions necessary (including obtaining any necessary determinations and/or resolutions of the Company Board or a committee thereof and amending the Company Stock Plan) to: 

 

 (i)  terminate the Company Stock Plan; 

 

 (ii) provide that each outstanding option to purchase Company Shares granted under the Company Stock Plan (each, an "Option") that is outstanding and unexercised (without regard to the exercise price of such Option) as of immediately prior to the Effective Time, whether vested or unvested, shall become fully vested and exercisable immediately prior to and contingent on the Closing; and 

 

 (iii) cancel, as of the Effective Time, each Option that is outstanding and unexercised (without regard to the exercise price of such Option), as of immediately prior to the Effective Time (in each case, without the creation of additional liability to the Company or any of its Subsidiaries), subject, if applicable, to payment pursuant to Section 2.07(b) . 

 

 (b)  Each holder of an Option that is outstanding and unexercised as of immediately prior to the Effective Time and has an exercise price per share that is less than the per share Merger Consideration shall be entitled to receive as soon as reasonably practicable after the Effective Time, a cash amount equal to the Designated Consideration for each Company Share then subject to the Option (less all applicable Tax deductions and withholdings required by Law to be withheld in respect of such payment and without interest). Holders of Options listed on Section 2.07(b) of the Company Disclosure Schedule are required to execute and deliver an Option Holder Acknowledgement prior to and as a pre-condition to receiving the Designated Consideration. For purposes of this Agreement, "Designated Consideration" means, with respect to any Company Share issuable under a particular Option, an amount equal to the excess, if any, of (i) the Merger Consideration per Company Share over (ii) the exercise price payable in respect of such Company Share issuable under such Option.

 (d)  Assuming the accuracy of the representations and warranties set forth in Section 4.09, the affirmative vote of the holders of a majority of the outstanding Company Shares (the "Requisite Company Vote") is the only vote or approval of the holders of any Equity Security of the Company necessary to adopt this Agreement and approve and consummate the Transactions under applicable Law and the Company Charter Documents.

filing, declaration, registration or notice (each, a "Filing") with or to,
any Governmental Authority or any stock market or stock exchange on which
Company Shares are listed for trading are necessary for the execution and
delivery of this Agreement by the Company, the performance by the Company of
its obligations hereunder and the consummation by the Company of the
Transactions, except where the failure to obtain any Consent or make any
Filing is immaterial to the Company and its Subsidiaries (which, for the
avoidance of doubt, shall not include any Consents or Filings pursuant to the
foregoing subparts (i) through (v)).

  Section 3.05 _Company SEC Documents; Reporting Issuer;
Undisclosed Liabilities_.

 

 (a)  Since October 1, 2015, the Company has filed with or furnished to the United States Securities and Exchange Commission (the "SEC"), on a timely basis, all required registration statements, certifications, reports and proxy statements (collectively, and in each case including all exhibits and schedules thereto and documents incorporated by reference therein, the "Company SEC Documents"). As of their respective effective dates (in the case of Company SEC Documents that are registration statements filed pursuant to the requirements of the Securities Act) and as of their respective SEC filing dates (in the case of all other Company SEC Documents) (or if amended or superseded by a filing prior to the date of this Agreement, then on the date of such filing), the Company SEC Documents complied in all material respects with the applicable requirements of the Securities Act, the Exchange Act and the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 (as amended and including the rules and regulations promulgated thereunder, the "Sarbanes-Oxley Act"), as the case may be, applicable to such Company SEC Documents, and none of the Company SEC Documents as of such respective dates (or, if amended prior to the date of this Agreement, the date of the filing of such amendment, with respect to the disclosures that are amended) contained any untrue statement of a material fact or omitted to state a material fact required to be stated therein or necessary to make the statements therein, in light of the circumstances under which they were made, not misleading.

The Company has evaluated the effectiveness of the Companys internal control over financial reporting and presented in any applicable Company SEC Document its conclusions about the effectiveness of the internal control over financial reporting as of the end of the period covered by such Company SEC Document based on such evaluation. Since December 31, 2012, none of the Company, the Company Board or audit committee nor, to the Knowledge of the Company, the Company\'s auditors have been advised of, and the Company\'s principal executive officer and its principal financial officer have not disclosed, based on their evaluation of the Company\'s internal controls referred to above, to the Company\'s auditors or the Company Board or audit committee (i) any significant deficiencies or material weaknesses in the design or operation of internal controls over financial reporting which are reasonably likely to adversely affect the Company\'s ability to record, process, summarize and report financial information or (ii) any fraud, whether or not material, that involves management or other employees who have a significant role in the Company\'s internal control over financial reporting. 

 

 (v)  No executive officer of the Company has failed to make the certifications required of him or her under Section 302 or 906 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act. Neither the Company nor any of its executive officers has received notice from any Governmental Authority challenging or questioning the accuracy, completeness, form or manner of filing of such certifications. To the Companys Knowledge, there are no facts or circumstances that would prevent its principal executive officer and principal financial officer from giving the certifications and attestations required pursuant to the rules and regulations adopted pursuant to Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act, without qualification, when next due. 

 

 (vi)  Neither the Company nor any of its Subsidiaries has outstanding, "extensions of credit" to directors or executive officers of the Company within the meaning of Section 402 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002.

  Section 5.02 _Other Actions_. During the Pre-Closing
Period, the Company and Parent shall not, and shall not permit any of their

  Section 5.03 _Access to Information; Confidentiality_.

 

 (a)  During the Pre-Closing Period, the Company shall, and shall cause its Subsidiaries to, afford to Parent and Parents Representatives reasonable access, at reasonable times and in a manner as shall not unreasonably interfere with the business or operations of the Company or any Subsidiary thereof, to the Representatives, properties, offices, and other facilities and to all books, records, contracts, and other assets of the Company and its Subsidiaries, and the Company shall, and shall cause its Subsidiaries to, furnish promptly to Parent such additional financial, accounting, operating, environmental, technical, engineering, geological and other data and information concerning the business and properties of the Company and its Subsidiaries as Parent may reasonably request from time to time. Neither the Company nor any of its Subsidiaries shall be required to provide access to or disclose information where such access or disclosure would jeopardize the protection of attorney-client privilege or contravene any Law (it being agreed that the parties shall use their Commercially Reasonable Efforts to cause such information to be provided in a manner that would not result in such jeopardy or contravention). No investigation shall affect the Companys representations, warranties, covenants, or agreements contained herein, or limit or otherwise affect the remedies available to Parent or Merger Sub pursuant to this Agreement. 

 

 (b)  Parent and the Company shall comply with, and shall cause their respective Representatives to comply with, all of their respective obligations under the Non-Disclosure Agreement, dated October 30, 2017, between Parent and the Company (the "Confidentiality Agreement"), which shall survive the termination of this Agreement in accordance with the terms set forth therein, except for (i) Section 6 thereof, which shall terminate as of the Closing Date and (ii) Section 10 thereof, which shall terminate as of the date of this Agreement. 

  Section 5.04 _No Solicitation_.

  (a)  The Company shall not, and shall cause its Subsidiaries not to, and shall not authorize or permit its and its Subsidiaries Representatives to, and shall give written instructions to all such Representatives not to, directly or indirectly, solicit, initiate, seek or knowingly take any action to facilitate or encourage the making, submission or announcement of any Takeover Proposal, or any inquiry, discussion, request, offer or proposal that could reasonably be expected to lead to any Takeover Proposal, or, subject to Section 5.04(b): (i) conduct or engage in any discussions or negotiations with, disclose any non-public information relating to the Company or any of its Subsidiaries to, afford access to the business, properties, assets, books, or records of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries to, or knowingly assist, participate in, facilitate, or encourage any effort by, any Person in connection with or in response to, or that could reasonably be expected to lead to, any Takeover Proposal; (ii) except where the Company Board determines that the failure to do so would be inconsistent with its fiduciary duties, (A) amend or grant any waiver or release under any standstill or similar agreement with respect to any class of Equity Securities of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries, or (B) approve any transaction under, or any Person becoming an "interested stockholder" under, Section 203 of the DGCL (other than the Merger, the Transactions, Parent and Merger Sub); or (iii) adopt, approve or enter into any agreement in principle, letter of intent, term sheet, memorandum of understanding, acquisition agreement, merger agreement, option agreement, joint venture agreement, partnership agreement, or other Contract providing for or relating to any Takeover Proposal (each, a "Company Acquisition Agreement"). The Company shall, and shall cause its Subsidiaries to cease immediately and cause to be terminated, and shall not authorize or permit any of its or their Representatives to continue, and shall give written instructions to all such Representatives not to continue, any and all existing activities, discussions, negotiations or solicitations, if any, with any Person (other than Parent or Merger Sub) with respect to any Takeover Proposal and shall use its Commercially Reasonable Efforts to cause any such Person (other than Parent or Merger Sub) and its Representatives in possession of non-public information in respect of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries that was furnished by or on behalf of the Company and its Subsidiaries to return or destroy (and confirm destruction of) all such information and terminate the access of any such Person (other than Parent or Merger Sub) and its Representatives to any electronic data room maintained by or on behalf of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries. 

 

 (b)  Notwithstanding Section 5.04(a), prior to the receipt of the Requisite Company Vote, if the Company or any of its Subsidiaries receives any bona fide written unsolicited Takeover Proposal that did not result from a material breach of this Section 5.04, the Company Board, directly or indirectly through any Representative, may, subject to Section 5.04(c): (i) contact the Person who made such bona fide written unsolicited Takeover Proposal for the purpose of clarifying such Takeover Proposal and the material terms and conditions and likelihood of consummation thereof in order to determine whether such Takeover Proposal constitutes or would reasonably be expected to result in a Superior Proposal and (ii) if the Company Board determines in good faith, after consultation with its outside legal and financial advisors, that such Takeover Proposal constitutes or would reasonably be expected to result in a Superior Proposal, thereafter (A) furnish to such Person non-public information relating to the Company or any of its Subsidiaries pursuant to an executed confidentiality agreement that constitutes an Acceptable Confidentiality Agreement; (B) make a Company Adverse Recommendation Change and (C) take any action that any court of competent jurisdiction orders the Company to take (which order remains unstayed), but in each case referred to in the foregoing clauses (A) through (C), only if the Company Board determines in good faith, after consultation with its outside legal and financial advisors, that the failure to take such action would be inconsistent with its fiduciary duties under applicable Law. Nothing contained herein shall prevent the Company Board from disclosing to the Companys stockholders a position contemplated by Rule 14d-9 and Rule 14e-2(a) promulgated under the Exchange Act with regard to a Takeover Proposal, if the Company determines that failure to disclose such position would constitute a violation of applicable Law. 

 

 (c)  The Company Board shall not take any of the actions referred to in clauses (i) or (ii) of Section 5.04(b) unless the Company shall have delivered to Parent at least five Business Days prior written notice advising Parent that it intends to take such action and stating the factors taken into account by the Company Board in determining that any such Takeover Proposal constitutes or would reasonably be expected to result in a Superior Proposal. The Company shall notify Parent promptly (but in no event later than 24 hours after Knowledge of the Companys (or any of its Subsidiaries or any of its or their Representatives) receipt ) of any Takeover Proposal, any inquiry or request that could reasonably be expected to lead to a Takeover Proposal, any request for non-public information relating to the Company or any of its Subsidiaries or for access to the business, properties, assets, books, or records of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries by any Person (other than Parent or Merger Sub). In such notice, the Company shall identify the Person making, and details of the material terms and conditions of, any such Takeover Proposal, indication or request. The Company shall keep Parent reasonably informed, on a prompt basis, of the status and material terms of any such Takeover Proposal, indication or request, including any material amendments or proposed amendments as to price and other material terms thereof. The Company shall promptly provide Parent with a list of any non-public information concerning the Companys and any of its Subsidiarys business, present or future performance, financial condition, or results of operations, provided to any Person, and, to the extent such information has not been previously provided to Parent, copies of such information. The Company will not, and will not cause or permit any Subsidiary of the Company to, enter into any Contract with any Person, or otherwise take any action, that would prohibit or restrict in any way the Company or such Subsidiary from providing any information to Parent hereunder.

  (d)  Except as expressly permitted by this Section 5.04, the Company Board shall not effect a Company Adverse Recommendation Change or enter into (or permit any Subsidiary to enter into) a Company Acquisition Agreement. Notwithstanding the foregoing, at any time prior to the receipt of the Requisite Company Vote, the Company Board may effect a Company Adverse Recommendation Change or enter into (or permit any Subsidiary to enter into) a Company Acquisition Agreement, if: (i) the Company promptly notifies Parent, in writing, at least five Business Days (the "Superior Proposal Notice Period") before making a Company Adverse Recommendation Change or entering into (or causing a Subsidiary to enter into) a Company Acquisition Agreement, of its intention to take such action with respect to a Superior Proposal, which notice shall state expressly that the Company has received a Takeover Proposal, that the Company Board intends to declare a Superior Proposal and that the Company Board intends to effect a Company Adverse Recommendation Change and/or the Company intends to enter into (or permit any Subsidiary to enter into) a Company Acquisition Agreement; (ii) the Company attaches to such notice the most current version of the proposed agreement (which version shall be updated promptly after material amendment thereto) and the identity of the Person making such Superior Proposal; (iii) the Company shall, and shall cause its Representatives to, during the Superior Proposal Notice Period, negotiate with Parent in good faith to make such adjustments in the terms and conditions of this Agreement so that such Takeover Proposal ceases to constitute a Superior Proposal, if Parent, in its discretion, proposes to make such adjustments (it being agreed that in the event that, after commencement of the Superior Proposal Notice Period, there is any material revision to the terms of a Superior Proposal, including, any revision in price, the Superior Proposal Notice Period shall be extended, if applicable, to ensure that at least five Business Days remain in the Superior Proposal Notice Period subsequent to the time the Company notifies Parent of any such material revision); and (iv) the Company Board determines in good faith, after consultation with its outside legal and financial advisors, that such Takeover Proposal continues to constitute a Superior Proposal after taking into account any adjustments made by Parent during the Superior Proposal Notice Period in the terms and conditions of this Agreement and that failure to make a Company Adverse Recommendation Change or enter into (or permit any Subsidiary to enter into) a Company Acquisition Agreement would continue to be inconsistent with its fiduciary duties under applicable Law. 

 

 (e)  Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in the foregoing, in response to an Intervening Event that has occurred after the date of this Agreement but prior to the receipt of the Requisite Company Vote, the Company Board may effect a Company Adverse Recommendation Change if: (i) prior to effecting the Company Adverse Recommendation Change, the Company promptly notifies Parent, in writing, at least five Business Days (the "Intervening Event Notice Period") before taking such action of its intent to consider such action (which notice shall not, by itself, constitute a Company Adverse Recommendation Change), and which notice shall include a reasonably detailed description of the underlying facts giving rise to, and the reasons for taking, such action; (ii) the Company shall, and shall cause its Representatives to, during the Intervening Event Notice Period, negotiate with Parent in good faith to make such adjustments in the terms and conditions of this Agreement so that the underlying facts giving rise to, and the reasons for taking such action, ceases to constitute an Intervening Event, if Parent, in its discretion, proposes to make such adjustments (it being agreed that in the event that, after commencement of the Intervening Event Notice Period, there is any material development in an Intervening Event, the Intervening Event Notice Period shall be extended, if applicable, to ensure that at least five Business Days remain in the Intervening Event Notice Period subsequent to the time the Company notifies Parent of any such material development); and (iii) the Company Board determines in good faith, after consultation with its outside legal and financial advisors, that the failure to effect such Company Adverse Recommendation Change, after taking into account any adjustments made by Parent during the Intervening Event Notice Period, would continue to be inconsistent with its fiduciary duties under applicable Law. The Company acknowledges and hereby agrees that any Company Adverse Recommendation Change effected (or proposed to be effected) in response to or in connection with any Takeover Proposal may be made solely and exclusively pursuant to Section 5.04(d) only, and may not be made pursuant to this Section 5.04(e), and any Company Adverse Recommendation Change may only be made pursuant to this Section 5.04 and for no other reason. 

  Proxy Materials; Approval by Sole Stockholder of_ _Merger Sub._

 

 (a)  The Company shall take all action necessary in accordance with the Company Charter Documents to establish a record date and duly call, give notice of, convene, and hold the Company Stockholders Meeting as soon as reasonably practicable after the date of this Agreement, and, in connection therewith, the Company shall mail the Company Proxy Statement to the holders of Company Shares in advance of such meeting. Except to the extent that the Company Board shall have effected a Company Adverse Recommendation Change as permitted by Section 5.04 hereof, the Company Proxy Statement shall include the Company Board Recommendation. Subject to Section 5.04 hereof, the Company shall use Commercially Reasonable Efforts to: (i) solicit from the holders of Company Shares proxies in favor of the adoption of this Agreement and approval of the Merger; and (ii) take all other actions necessary or advisable to secure the vote or consent of the holders of Company Shares required by applicable Law to obtain such approval. The Company shall not submit any other proposals for approval at the Company Stockholders Meeting without the prior written consent of Parent. The Company shall keep Parent and Merger Sub updated with respect to proxy solicitation results as requested by Parent or Merger Sub. Once the Company Stockholders Meeting has been called and noticed, the Company shall not postpone or adjourn the Company Stockholders Meeting without the consent of Parent, which consent may not be unreasonably withheld, other than: (A) in order to obtain a quorum of its stockholders; (B) to allow reasonable additional time after the filing and mailing of any supplemental or amended disclosures to the Company Proxy Statement for compliance with applicable legal requirements, to the extent required by applicable Law; or (C) to allow reasonable additional time to solicit proxies to secure the approval of the Agreement. If the Company Board makes a Company Adverse Recommendation Change, it will not alter the obligation of the Company to submit the adoption of this Agreement and the approval of the Merger to the holders of Company Shares at the Company Stockholders Meeting to consider and vote upon, unless this Agreement shall have been terminated in accordance with its terms prior to the Company Stockholders Meeting. 

 

 (b)  In connection with the Company Stockholders Meeting, as soon as reasonably practicable following the date of this Agreement the Company shall prepare and file the Company Proxy Statement with the SEC. Parent, Merger Sub, and the Company will cooperate and consult with each other in the preparation of the Company Proxy Statement. Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, each of Parent and Merger Sub will furnish the Company the information relating to it as the Company may reasonably request, including such information that is required by the Exchange Act and the rules and regulations promulgated thereunder to be set forth in the Company Proxy Statement. The Company shall not file the Company Proxy Statement, or any amendment or supplement thereto, without providing Parent a reasonable opportunity to review and comment thereon (which comments shall be considered in good faith by the Company and incorporated in the Company Proxy Statement, to the extent reasonable). The Company shall use its Commercially Reasonable Efforts to cause the Company Proxy Statement at the date that it (and any amendment or supplement thereto) is first published, sent, or given to the stockholders of the Company and at the time of the Company Stockholders Meeting, to comply as to form in all material respects with the requirements of the Exchange Act and the rules and regulations promulgated thereunder. The Company shall use its Commercially Reasonable Efforts to resolve, and each party agrees to consult and cooperate with the other party in resolving, all SEC comments with respect to the Company Proxy Statement as promptly as practicable after receipt thereof and to cause the Company Proxy Statement in definitive form to be cleared by the SEC and mailed to the Companys stockholders as promptly as reasonably practicable following filing with the SEC. The Company agrees to consult with Parent prior to responding to SEC comments with respect to the preliminary Company Proxy Statement. Each of Parent, Merger Sub, and the Company agree to correct any information provided by it for use in the Company Proxy Statement which shall have become false or misleading and the Company shall promptly prepare and mail to its stockholders an amendment or supplement setting forth such correction. The Company shall as soon as reasonably practicable: (i) notify Parent of the receipt of any comments from the SEC with respect to the Company Proxy Statement and any request by the SEC for any amendment to the Company Proxy Statement or for additional information; and (ii) provide Parent with copies of all written correspondence between the Company and its Representatives, on the one hand, and the SEC, on the other hand, with respect to the Company Proxy Statement. 

  (c)  Immediately following the execution and delivery of this Agreement, Parent, as sole stockholder of Merger Sub, shall adopt this Agreement and approve the Merger, in accordance with the DGCL. 

  Section 5.06 _Notices of Certain Events_. The Company
shall notify Parent and Merger Sub, and Parent and Merger Sub shall notify
the Company, promptly of: (a) any notice or other communication from
any Person alleging that the Consent of such Person is or may be required
in connection with the Transactions; (b) any notice or other communication
from any Governmental Authority in connection with the Transactions; (c) any
Legal Actions commenced, or to such partys Knowledge, threatened, against
the Company or any of its Subsidiaries or Parent or its Subsidiaries, as
applicable, that are related to the Merger or the other Transactions; and (d)
any event, change, or effect between the date of this Agreement and the
Effective Time which causes or is reasonably likely to cause the failure of
the conditions set forth in Section 6.02(a), Section 6.02(b), or Section
6.02(c) of this Agreement (in the case of the Company and its Subsidiaries)
or Section 6.03(a) or Section 6.03(b) of this Agreement (in the case of
Parent and Merger Sub), to be satisfied. In no event shall: (i) the delivery
of any notice by a party pursuant to this Section 5.06 limit or otherwise
affect the respective rights, obligations, representations, warranties,
covenants, or agreements of the parties or the conditions to the obligations
of the parties under this Agreement; or (ii) disclosure by the Company or
Parent be deemed to amend or supplement the Company Disclosure Schedule or
constitute an exception to any representation or warranty.

  Section 5.07 _Employees; Benefit Plans_. 

 

 (a)  No later than forty-five (45) days prior to the date of the Company Stockholders Meeting, Parent (or its designee) shall offer employment to such employees of the Company or its Subsidiaries as Parent may determine in its sole discretion and such offers of employment shall be conditioned on the Closing. Parent shall provide, or shall cause to be provided, to each such employee who accepts an offer of employment (the "Continuing Employees") compensation and benefits that, taken as a whole, are at a level substantially similar to the compensation and benefits (other than severance benefits and Equity Securities) provided by the Company or its Subsidiaries to such Continuing Employees immediately prior to the Effective Time; _provided_ , _however_ , that nothing in this Agreement shall create any right to continued employment in any Continuing Employee or prohibit the Surviving Corporation from terminating the employment of any Continuing Employee or from amending, modifying or terminating any Company Plan. 

 

 (b)  For purposes of vesting, eligibility to participate and levels of benefits (but not accrual) under the employee benefit plans of Parent and its Subsidiaries providing benefits to any Continuing Employee after the Effective Time (including the Company Plans), Parent shall use Commercially Reasonable Efforts to provide that each Continuing Employee shall be credited with his or her years of service with the Company and its Subsidiaries and their respective predecessors before the Effective Time, to the same extent as such Continuing Employee was entitled, before the Effective Time, to credit for such service under any similar Company Plan in which such Continuing Employee participated or was eligible to participate immediately prior to the Effective Time, provided that the foregoing shall not apply to the extent that its application would result in a duplication of benefits with respect to the same period of service. In addition, and without limiting the generality of the foregoing, Parent shall use its Commercially Reasonable Efforts to cause (i) any applicable waiting period under any employee benefit plan of Parent and its Subsidiaries providing benefits to any Continuing Employee after the Effective Time to be waived with respect to each such Continuing Employee to the extent coverage under such plan is replacing comparable coverage under a Company Plan in which such Continuing Employee participated immediately before the Effective Time and (ii) for purposes of each such plan providing medical, dental, pharmaceutical and/or vision benefits to any Continuing Employee, all pre-existing condition exclusions and actively-at-work requirements of such plan to be waived for such Continuing Employee and his or her covered dependents, to the extent such conditions were inapplicable or waived under the comparable Company Plan of the Company or its Subsidiaries in which such Continuing Employee participated immediately prior to the Effective Time. Parent shall take Commercially Reasonable Efforts to cause any eligible expenses incurred by any Continuing Employee and his or her covered dependents during the portion of the plan year of the applicable Company Plan ending on the date such Continuing Employees participation in the corresponding employee benefit plan of Parent and its Subsidiaries begins to be taken into account under such plan for purposes of satisfying all deductible, coinsurance and maximum out-of-pocket requirements applicable to such Continuing Employee and his or her covered dependents for the applicable plan year as if such amounts had been paid in accordance with such plan. 

  (c)  The provisions of this Section 5.07 and Section 5.16(f) are solely for the benefit of the parties, and no provision of this Section 5.07 or Section 5.16(f) is intended to, or shall, constitute the establishment or adoption of or an amendment to any employee benefit plan for purposes of ERISA or otherwise and no current or former employee or independent contractor of the Company, the Surviving Corporation or any of their respective Subsidiaries, or any other individual associated therewith shall be regarded for any purpose as a third party beneficiary of this Section 5.07 or Section 5.16(f) or have the right to enforce the provisions hereof or thereof. 

 

 (d)  From time to time during the period between the date of this Agreement and the date referred to in Section 5.07(a), the Company shall, and shall cause its Subsidiaries to, make available to Parent and its Representatives reasonable access (subject to the provisions in the following sentence) to such of the officers and employees of the Company and its Subsidiaries as the Parent may from time to time reasonably request for purposes of: (x) evaluating which, if any, of those persons may be employed by Parent, Merger Sub or any of their Affiliates from and after the Effective Time; (y) discussing with any such persons the terms and conditions, if any, on which they may be employed by Parent, Merger Sub or any of their Affiliates from and after the Effective Time; and (z) making (or not making) offers of employment as provided in Section 5.07(a), notwithstanding any contrary provision of the Confidentiality Agreement. Such access will include the opportunity for individual or group meetings (either in person or through telephonic, video or other electronic communication media) with one or more such persons, or all employees, at offices, plants and other facilities of Seller and its Subsidiaries, or at off-site locations, in each case as reasonably requested by Parent, subject to the following limitations: 

 

 (i)  In the case of any access involving in-person meetings at offices, plants and other facilities of Seller and its Subsidiaries, such access will be on such dates and at times (either before, during or after normal business hours for the employees involved) mutually agreed by Parent and the Company, and subject to the normal safety and security restrictions at the location of such meetings. 

 

 (ii)  In each case, such access will not unreasonably interfere with the business and operations of the Company and its Subsidiaries and will be conducted in compliance with applicable Laws and Permits. 

  Section 5.08 _Directors  and Officers Indemnification
and Insurance_.

  (a)  From and after the Effective Time through the sixth anniversary of the date on which the Effective Time occurs, each of Parent and the Surviving Corporation and their respective applicable Subsidiaries shall, (i) indemnify and hold harmless each individual who at the Effective Time is, or at any time prior to the Effective Time was, a director or officer of the Company or of a Subsidiary of the Company (each, an " **Indemnitee** " and, collectively, the " **Indemnitees** ") with respect to all claims, liabilities, losses, damages, judgments, fines, penalties, costs (including amounts paid in settlement or compromise) and expenses (including fees and expenses of legal counsel) in connection with any claim, suit, action, proceeding or investigation (whether civil, criminal, administrative or investigative), whenever asserted, based on or arising out of, in whole or in part, (A) the fact that an Indemnitee was a director or officer of the Company or such Subsidiary or (B) acts or omissions by an Indemnitee in the Indemnitees capacity as a director, officer, employee or agent of the Company or such Subsidiary or taken at the request of the Company or such Subsidiary (including in connection with serving at the request of the Company or such Subsidiary as a director, officer, employee, agent, trustee or fiduciary of another Person (including any employee benefit plan)), in each case under (A) or (B), at, or at any time prior to, the Effective Time (including any claim, suit, action, proceeding or investigation relating in whole or in part to the Transactions), to the same extent such Indemnitees are entitled to indemnification as of the date of this Agreement by the Company or any of its Subsidiaries pursuant to applicable Law, the Company Charter Documents, the organizational documents of such Subsidiaries or any indemnification agreements in existence on the date of this Agreement and made available to Parent prior to the date hereof, and (ii) assume all obligations of the Company and such Subsidiaries to the Indemnitees in respect of indemnification and exculpation from liabilities for acts or omissions occurring at or prior to the Effective Time as provided in the Company Charter Documents and the organizational documents of such Subsidiaries as currently in effect; _provided, however_ , that if, at any time prior to the sixth anniversary of the Effective Time, any Indemnitee delivers to Parent or the Surviving Corporation a written notice asserting a claim for indemnification under this Section 5.08(a), then the claim asserted in such notice shall survive the sixth anniversary of the Effective Time until such time as such claim is fully and finally resolved. Without limiting the foregoing, Parent, from and after the Closing until six (6) years from the Effective Time, shall cause, unless otherwise required by Law, the certificate of incorporation and bylaws of the Surviving Corporation to contain provisions no less favorable to the Indemnitees with respect to limitation of liabilities of directors and officers and indemnification than are set forth as of the date of this Agreement in the Company Charter Documents, which provisions shall not be amended, repealed or otherwise modified or superseded in any manner that would adversely affect the rights thereunder of the Indemnitees. In addition, from the Closing until six (6) years from date on which the Effective Time occurs, Parent shall, and shall cause the Surviving Corporation to, advance any expenses (including the fees and expenses of legal counsel) of any Indemnitee under this Section 5.08 (including in connection with enforcing the indemnity and other obligations referred to in this Section 5.08) as incurred to the same extent such Indemnitees are entitled to advancement of expenses as of the date of this Agreement by the Company or any of its Subsidiaries pursuant to applicable Law, the Company Charter Documents, the organizational documents of such Subsidiaries or any indemnification agreements in existence on the date of this Agreement and made available to Parent prior to the date hereof,  _provided_ , _however_ , that the individual to whom expenses are advanced provides, if requested by Parent, an undertaking to repay such advances if it shall be determined that such individual is not entitled to be indemnified pursuant to this Section 5.08(a) . The Surviving Corporation shall reasonably cooperate in good faith in the defense of any such matters; _provided_ , that requests by Indemnitees or their Representatives to interview Representatives, examine the books and records or access the properties of the Surviving Corporation shall be made during normal business hours and upon reasonable notice and shall not significantly or materially impact the operations of the Surviving Corporation.

 

 (b)  Prior to the Effective Time, the Company may purchase, for an aggregate amount not to exceed 300% of the current aggregate annual premium (the "Maximum Premium"), a six-year prepaid "tail policy" ("Tail Policy") providing coverage for the Indemnitees on terms and conditions providing substantially equivalent benefits as the current policies of directors and officers liability insurance maintained by the Company and its Subsidiaries with respect to matters existing or occurring prior to the Effective Time, covering without limitation the Transactions; _provided_ , _however_ , that if the premium for such Tail Policy shall exceed the Maximum Premium, the Company shall provide or cause to be provided a Tail Policy for the applicable individuals with the best coverage as shall then be available at an annual premium equal to the Maximum Premium. After the Effective Time, the Surviving Corporation shall cause such policy to be maintained in full force and effect, for its full term, and to honor all of its obligations thereunder and neither Parent nor the Surviving Corporation shall have any further obligations under this Section 5.08(b).

 

 (c)  The provisions of this Section 5.08 are (i) intended to be for the benefit of, and shall be enforceable by, each Indemnitee, his or her heirs and his or her Representatives and (ii) in addition to, and not in substitution for, any other rights to indemnification or contribution that any such individual may have under the Company Charter Documents, by Contract or otherwise (it being expressly agreed that the Indemnitees to whom this Section 5.08 applies shall be third party beneficiaries of this Section 5.08). 

  (d)  In the event that Parent, the Surviving Corporation or any of their respective successors or assigns (i) consolidates with or merges into any other Person and is not the continuing or surviving corporation or entity of such consolidation or merger or (ii) transfers or conveys all or substantially all of its properties and assets to any Person, then, and in each such case, proper provision shall be made so that the successors and assigns of Parent or the Surviving Corporation shall assume all of the obligations thereof set forth in this Section 5.08. 

 

 (e)  Nothing in this Agreement is intended to, shall be construed to or shall release, waive or impair any rights to Indemnitees insurance claims under any policy that is or has been in existence with respect to the Company or any of its Subsidiaries for any of their respective directors, officers or other employees, it being understood and agreed that the indemnification provided for in this Section 5.08 is not prior to or in substitution for any such claims under such policies.

In connection with the foregoing and to the extent not prohibited by applicable Law, the Company will provide Parent, and Parent will provide the Company, with copies of any material correspondence, Filing or communication between such party or any of its Representatives, on the one hand, and any Governmental Entity, on the other hand, with respect to this Agreement and the Transactions, promptly after receipt or submission thereof, other than "Item 4(c) and 4(d) documents" submitted with a partys Notification and Report Form filing pursuant to the HSR Act; notwithstanding the foregoing, in no instance shall either party be required to provide valuation information to the other party or its Representatives.

The Company and Parent will each request early termination of the waiting period with respect to the Transactions under the HSR Act.

  (d)  Each of the parties shall use its Commercially Reasonable Efforts to (i) cooperate in all respects with each other in connection with any Filing with or to a Governmental Authority in connection with the Transactions and in connection with any investigation or other inquiry by or before a Governmental Authority relating to the Transactions, including any proceeding initiated by a private Person, and (ii) keep the other party informed in all material respects and on a reasonably timely basis of any material communication received by such party from, or given by such party to, the Federal Trade Commission, the Antitrust Division of the Department of Justice, FERC or any other Governmental Authority and of any material communication received or given in connection with any proceeding by a private Person, in each case regarding any of the Transactions. Subject to applicable Laws relating to the exchange of information and all privileges, including the attorney-client privilege, each of the parties shall have the right to review in advance, and to the extent practicable, each will consult, and consider in good faith the views of, the other on, all the information relating to the other parties and their respective Subsidiaries, as the case may be, that appears in any Filing made with, or written materials submitted to, any Governmental Authority or other Person in connection with the Transactions, other than "Item 4(c) and 4(d) documents" submitted with a partys Notification and Report Form filing pursuant to the HSR Act. To the extent permitted by applicable Law, each party shall provide the other parties (in the case of Parent and Merger Sub) or party (in the case of the Company) with the opportunity to attend any meetings with or other appearances before any Governmental Authority with respect to the Transactions. Any party may, as it deems advisable and necessary, reasonably designate any highly confidential or competitively sensitive material provided to another party under this Section 5.09 as "Outside Counsel Only." Such materials and the information contained therein shall be given only to the outside antitrust legal counsel of the recipient and will not be disclosed by such outside counsel to employees, officers, or directors of the recipient, unless express written permission is obtained in advance from the source of the materials. 

 

 (e)  Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Section 5.09, none of Parent, Merger Sub or the Company shall be required in order to resolve any objections asserted under Antitrust Laws by any Governmental Authority with respect to the Transactions to divest any of its businesses, product lines or assets, or to take or agree to take any other action or to agree to any limitation or restriction of any kind on its business, operations, properties or assets.

  Section 5.10 _Public Announcements_. The initial press
release with respect to this Agreement and the Transactions shall be a

Company, the Merger or any other Transaction and if any such anti-takeover
Law becomes or is deemed to be applicable to the Company, the Merger, or any
other Transaction, then each of the Company and the Company Board shall grant
such approvals and take such actions as are necessary so that
the Transactions may be consummated as promptly as practicable on the
terms contemplated hereby and otherwise act to minimize the effects of, or
render inapplicable to the Company, the Merger or any other Transaction,
such anti-takeover Law.

  Effective Time, the Company shall take all such steps as may be required to
cause to be exempt under Rule 16b-3 promulgated under the Exchange Act

respect to such Company Shares and Options) that result from the Transactions

requirements of Section 16(a) of the Exchange Act with respect to the Company
immediately prior to the Effective Time.

  Section 5.13 _Further Assurances_. At and after the

Company shall notify the other party promptly of the commencement of any
Legal Action that is a stockholder or derivative suit related to
this Agreement, the Merger or any other Transaction of which it has received

the defense or settlement of any such Legal Action against the Company or its
Affiliates or any of its or their respective directors or officers and (ii)
to review and comment upon filings and responses related thereto, which the

Parent with respect thereto.

   Section 5.16 _Change of Control Payments and Service
Bonus._

 

 (a)  Parent and Merger Sub hereby acknowledge that the Transactions contemplated by this Agreement shall constitute a "change in control," "change of control" or term or concept of similar import of the Company and its Subsidiaries under the terms of the items required to be disclosed in Section 3.11 of the Company Disclosure Schedule pursuant to Section 3.11(e)(i) (the "Severance Provisions"). Parent and Merger Sub acknowledge and agree that the Company and its Subsidiaries, from and after the Effective Time, shall honor all obligations and rights under the Severance Provisions in accordance with their terms, including, at the Effective Time, paying any amounts due under the Severance Provisions with respect to the occurrence of the Transactions. 

 

 (b)  Subject to the terms and conditions in this Section 5.16, the Company or the Surviving Corporation, as applicable, will pay to each of the persons listed in Section 5.16(b) of the Company Disclosure Schedule (the "Service Bonus Recipients") the respective amounts set forth opposite the name of each Service Bonus Recipient in Section 5.16(b) of the Company Disclosure Schedule, reduced by (i) any amounts required to be withheld under any applicable Laws, including for Taxes, and (ii) in the case of Service Bonus Recipients who are employees of U.S. Geothermal Guatemala, S.A., any severance, economic advantages or other compensation or benefits required to be paid to those persons under any applicable Laws (the "Service Bonus"). 

 

 (c)  The obligation of the Company or the Surviving Corporation, as applicable, to pay, and the right of any Service Bonus Recipient to receive, any Service Bonus will be subject to satisfaction (or waiver by Parent, in its sole discretion) of each of the following conditions: 

 

 (i)  The Closing must occur before or contemporaneously with payment of the Service Bonus, and no Service Bonus will be paid to any Service Bonus Recipient if this Agreement is terminated prior to the Closing. 

  (ii)  The Service Bonus Recipient must be continuously employed by the Company or one of its Subsidiaries during the period commencing on the date of this Agreement and ending on the date that is (x) except for those Service Bonus Recipients who are Transition Employees (as defined below), the Closing Date, or (y) in the case of any Service Bonus Recipient who is requested by Parent no later than forty-five (45) days prior to the date of the Company Stockholders Meeting to provide any transition services to the Surviving Corporation or any of its Subsidiaries of substantially similar time commitment and duties at the same location (the "Transition Services") for any limited period of time after the Closing Date that may be requested by Parent (excluding for the avoidance of doubt any Person who becomes a Continuing Employee pursuant to Section 5.07 providing ongoing services as employees of Parent or any of its Subsidiaries for an indefinite period of time after the Closing Date) (the "Transition Employees"), the date that is the last day of the period (the "Transition Service Period") commencing on the Closing Date and ending on the earliest of: 

 

(A) the last day of the period of service Parent requested that
Transition Employee to provide;

 

(B) the date prior to the day referred to in clause (A) above, if any,
on which the employment of that Transition Employee is terminated without
cause (as determined by Parent in its sole discretion); and

 

(C) the date of death or permanent disability of the Transition
Employee.

 

For the avoidance of doubt, any Service Bonus Recipient who is requested to
provide and declines or fails to provide any or all Transition Services
requested by Parent will be paid no Service Bonus.

 

 (iii)  Any Service Bonus Recipient who is a Transition Employee must provide during the Transition Service Period those Transition Services that have been requested by Parent with the same amount of skill, diligence, integrity, time and effort, in all material respects, as that Transition Employee used in providing comparable services to the Company or its Subsidiaries prior to the Closing. 

 

 (iv)  Each Service Bonus Recipient who is not a Transition Employee must, on or prior to the Closing Date, (x) execute and deliver to Parent and the Company a general release (in form and substance reasonably satisfactory to Parent and the Company) in favor of the Company, its Subsidiaries and their respective Representatives (and their respective successors, administrators, executors, heirs and assigns), against any and all claims relating to or arising out of the Service Bonus Recipients employment relationship with the Company and its Subsidiaries and the termination of that relationship and (y) not revoke such general release within the time provided by applicable Law (such general release which meets the requirements of subclauses (x) and (y) is hereinafter referred to as an "Effective General Release"). 

 

 (v)  Each Service Bonus Recipient who is a Transition Employee must, within twenty-one (21) days (forty-five (45) days in the case of a group termination) following the earliest of the dates specified in subclauses (A), (B) or (C) in Section 5.16(c)(iii), execute and deliver to Parent and the Surviving Corporation an Effective General Release. 

 

 (d)  Any Service Bonus payable in accordance with this Section 5.16 will be paid, in cash, though the normal payroll payment mechanism of the Company or the Surviving Corporation, as applicable, at the following times: 

 

 (i)  except for those Service Bonus Recipients who are Transition Employees, on the Closing Date, immediately prior to the Effective Time, and in any event no later than March 15th of the calendar year following the year in which such amount vests. 

  (ii)  for any Service Bonus Recipients who are Transition Employees, on the last day of his or her Transition Service Period, unless his or her Transition Service Period is longer than ninety (90) days after the Closing Date, in which case on the date that is ninety (90) days after the Closing Date, unless that is not a Business Day, in which case on the first Business Day following the date that is ninety (90) days after the Closing Date, and in any event no later than March 15th of the calendar year following the year in which such amount vests and in compliance with the requirements of Section 409A related to payments in connection with general release agreements. 

 

Notwithstanding the foregoing, Parent will have no obligation to pay, and no
Service Bonus Recipient will have the right to receive, any Service Bonus
until such time as such Service Bonus Recipient has executed and delivered an
Effective General Release.

 

 (e)  The arrangement to provide Service Bonuses set forth in this Section 5.16 and Section 5.16(b) of the Company Disclosure Schedule is intended to be exempt from Section 409A of the Code and the Treasury Regulations promulgated thereunder ("Section 409A"). Notwithstanding the foregoing, none of the Company, Parent or Merger Sub make any representation or covenant regarding the status of such program under Section 409A. 

 

 (f)  Unless otherwise agreed by Parent and any Transition Employee, Parent shall provide, or shall cause to be provided, to each Transition Employee during his or her Transition Service Period compensation and benefits that, taken as a whole, are at a level substantially similar to the compensation and benefits (other than severance benefits and Equity Securities) provided by the Company or its Subsidiaries to such Transition Employees immediately prior to the Effective Time for services comparable to the Transition Services provided by that Transition Employee. 

 

 (g)  Nothing in this Section 5.16 or Section 5.16(b) of the Company Disclosure Schedule shall create any right to continued employment for any Service Bonus Recipient.

  Following Termination_.

 

 (a)  If this Agreement is terminated by Parent pursuant to Section 7.03(a), Section 7.03(b), where the term "breach" is replaced with Knowing, Intentional Breach in each instance, or Section 7.03(c) or is terminated by the Company pursuant to Section 7.04(a), then the Company shall pay, or cause to be paid, to Parent the Company Termination Fee, by wire transfer of immediately available funds and, in the case of termination by Parent pursuant to Section 7.03(a) or by the Company pursuant to Section 7.04(a), concurrently with or prior to such termination.

 (c)  The parties acknowledge and hereby agree that the provisions of this Section 7.06 are an integral part of the Transactions contemplated by this Agreement (including the Merger), and that, without such provisions, the parties would not have entered into this Agreement. Each of the parties hereto acknowledges that each of the Company Termination Fee and the Parent Termination Fee is not a penalty, but is liquidated damages in a reasonable amount that will compensate Parent or the Company, as applicable, in the circumstances in which such fee is payable for the efforts and resources expended and opportunities foregone while negotiating this Agreement and in reliance on this Agreement and on the expectation of the consummation of the Transactions, which amount would otherwise be impossible to calculate with precision. If the Company, on the one hand, or Parent, on the other hand, shall fail to pay in a timely manner the amounts due pursuant to this Section 7.06, and, in order to obtain such payment, the other party makes a claim against the non-paying party that results in a judgment against the non-paying party for such amounts, the non-paying party shall pay to the other party the reasonable costs and expenses (including its reasonable attorneys fees and expenses) incurred or accrued in connection with such suit, together with interest on the amounts set forth in this Section 7.06 at the prime lending rate prevailing during such period as published in _The Wall Street Journal_ , plus two percent (2%) per annum. Any interest payable hereunder shall be calculated on a daily basis from the date such amounts were required to be paid until (but excluding) the date of actual payment, and on the basis of a 360-day year. Subject only to the last sentence of this Section 7.06(c), the Companys right to terminate this Agreement and receive payment of the Parent Termination Fee upon termination pursuant to Section 7.06(b) shall constitute the sole and exclusive remedy of the Company, its Subsidiaries and any of their respective former, current or future Representatives or assignees (the "Company Parties") against Parent, Merger Sub and their respective former, current or future Representatives or assignees (the "Parent Parties") for all losses or damages suffered as a result of the failure of the Transactions to be consummated, and, upon payment of such amount, none of the Parent Parties shall have any further Liability relating to or arising out of this Agreement or the Transactions. Subject only to the last sentence of this Section 7.06(c), Parents right to terminate this Agreement and receive payment of the Company Termination Fee upon termination pursuant to Section 7.06(a) shall constitute the sole and exclusive remedy of the Parent Parties against the Company Parties for all losses or damages suffered as a result of the failure of the Transactions to be consummated, and, upon payment of such amount, none of the Company Parties shall have any further Liability relating to or arising out of this Agreement or the Transactions. Notwithstanding the foregoing, prior to any valid termination of this Agreement by Parent or the Company in accordance with the terms hereof, any right to specific performance and other equitable relief provided by Section 8.13 shall be the sole and exclusive remedy of the parties to this Agreement.

 

 (d)  Except as expressly set forth in Section 7.06(c), all Expenses incurred in connection with this Agreement and the Transactions will be paid by the party incurring such Expenses at or prior to Closing; _provided, however_ , that Parent and the Company shall each be responsible for one half of the filing fees payable in connection with the filings under the HSR Act and any other applicable Antitrust Laws. 

  Effective Time, this Agreement may be amended or supplemented in any and all
respects by written agreement signed by each of the parties hereto. 

  Section 7.08 _Extension; Waiver_. At any time prior to
the Effective Time, Parent or Merger Sub, on the one hand, or the Company, on
the other hand, may: (a) extend the time for the performance of any of the
obligations of the other party(ies); (b) waive any inaccuracies in
the representations and warranties of the other party(ies) contained in
this Agreement or in any document delivered under this Agreement; or (c)
unless prohibited by applicable Law, waive compliance with any of the
covenants, agreements, or conditions contained in this Agreement. Any
agreement on the part of a party to any extension or waiver will be valid
only if set forth in an instrument in writing signed by such party. The
failure or delay of any party to assert any right, power or privilege under
this Agreement will not constitute a waiver thereof and any single or partial
exercise thereof will not preclude any other or further exercise thereof or
the exercise of any other right, power or privilege hereunder.

the performance of the terms and provisions hereof (including the other
respective parties obligations to consummate the Merger) in the Delaware
Courts. Each party hereby agrees it will not oppose the granting of an
injunction, specific performance and other equitable relief on the basis that
such other parties have an adequate remedy at Law or that any award of
specific performance is not an appropriate remedy for any reason at Law or in
equity. Any party seeking an injunction or other Order to prevent breaches of
this Agreement and to enforce specifically the terms and provisions hereof
shall not be required to post any bond or other security in connection
therewith.

for, the securing or posting of a bond in  connection with the other partys

Agreement may not be amended or supplemented, and no  provisions hereof may

ARTICLE VIII

 

Indemnification

  A. _Nature of Indemnity_. Each person who was or is made a party
or is  threatened to be made a party to or is involved in any action, suit
or  proceeding, whether civil, criminal, administrative or investigative (a 
" _Proceeding_ "), by reason of the fact that he or she (or a person of whom 
he or she is the legal representative), is or was a director or officer of
the  Corporation or is or was serving at the request of the Corporation as
a  director, officer, employee, fiduciary or agent of another corporation or
of a  partnership, joint venture, trust or other enterprise, including
service with  respect to employee benefit plans, whether the basis of such
Proceeding is  alleged action in an official capacity as a director, officer,
employee,  fiduciary or agent or in any other capacity while serving as a
director,  officer, employee, fiduciary or agent, shall be indemnified and
held harmless by  the Corporation to the fullest extent which it is empowered
to do so by the  General Corporation Law of the State of Delaware, as the
same exists or may  hereafter be amended (but, in the case of any such
amendment, only to the extent  that such amendment permits the Corporation to
provide broader indemnification  rights than said law permitted the
Corporation to provide prior to such  amendment) against all expense,
liability and loss (including attorneys\' fees  actually and reasonably
incurred by such person in connection with such  Proceeding) and such
indemnification shall inure to the benefit of his or her  heirs, executors
and administrators; _provided_ , _however_ , that  except as provided in
Section B of this Article VIII, the Corporation shall  indemnify any such
person seeking indemnification in connection with a  Proceeding initiated by
such person only if such Proceeding was authorized by  the Board of
Directors. The right to indemnification conferred in this Article  VIII shall
be a contract right and, subject to Sections B and E of this Article  VIII,
shall include the right to payment by the Corporation of the expenses 
incurred in defending any such Proceeding in advance of its final
disposition.  The Corporation may, by action of the Board of Directors,
provide  indemnification to employees and agent of the Corporation with the
same scope  and effect as the foregoing indemnification of directors and
officers.

  B. _Procedure for Indemnification of Directors and Officers_. Any  indemnification of a director or officer of the Corporation under Section A of  this Article VIII or advancement of expenses under Section E of this Article VIII shall be made  promptly, and in any event within thirty (30) days, upon the written request of  the director or officer. If a determination by the Corporation that the director  or officer is entitled to indemnification pursuant to this Article VIII is  required, and the Corporation fails to respond within sixty (60) days to a  written request for indemnity, the Corporation shall be deemed to have approved  the request. If the Corporation denies a written request for indemnification or  advancement of expenses, in whole or in part, or if payment in full pursuant to  such request is not made within thirty (30) days, the right to indemnification  or advancement of expenses as granted by this Article VIII shall be enforceable  by the director or officer in any court of competent jurisdiction. Such person\'s  costs and expenses incurred in connection with successfully establishing his or  her right to indemnification, in whole or in part, in any such action shall also  be indemnified by the Corporation. It shall be a defense to any such action  (other than an action brought to enforce a claim for expenses incurred in  defending any Proceeding in advance of its final disposition where the required  undertaking, if any, has been tendered to the Corporation) that the claimant has  not met the standards of conduct which make it permissible under the General  Corporation Law of the State of Delaware for the Corporation to indemnify the  claimant for the amount claimed, but the burden of such defense shall be on the  Corporation. Neither the failure of the Corporation (including the Board of  Directors, independent legal counsel or its stockholders) to have made a  determination prior to the commencement of such action that indemnification of  the claimant is proper in the circumstances because he or she has met the  applicable standards of conduct set forth in the General Corporation Law of the  State of Delaware, nor an actual determination by the Corporation (including the  Board of Directors, independent legal counsel or its stockholders) that the  claimant has not met such applicable standards of conduct, shall be a defense to  the action or create a presumption that the claimant has not met the applicable  standards of conduct. 

  C. _Non-exclusivity of Article VIII_. The rights to
indemnification and the  payment of expenses incurred in defending a
Proceeding in advance of its final  disposition conferred in this Article
VIII shall not be exclusive of any other  right which any person may or
hereafter acquire under any statute, provision of  this Certificate of
Incorporation, By-Law, agreement, vote of stockholders or  disinterested
directors or otherwise.

  D. _Insurance_. The Corporation may purchase and maintain
insurance on its own  behalf and on behalf of any person who is or was a
director, officer, employee,  fiduciary or agent of the Corporation or was
serving at the request of the  Corporation as a director, officer, employee,
fiduciary or agent of another  corporation, partnership, joint venture, trust
or other enterprise against any  liability asserted against him or her and
incurred by him or her in any such  capacity, whether or not the Corporation
would have the power to indemnify such  person against such liability under
this Article VIII.

  E. _Expenses_. Expenses incurred by any person described in
Section A of this  Article VIII in defending a Proceeding shall be paid by
the Corporation in  advance of such Proceeding\'s final disposition unless
otherwise determined by  the Board of Directors in the specific case upon
receipt of an undertaking by or  on behalf of the director or officer to
repay such amount if it shall ultimately  be determined that he or she is not
entitled to be indemnified by the  Corporation. Such expenses incurred by
other employees and agents may be so paid  upon such terms and conditions, if
any, as the Board of Directors deems  appropriate.

  foregoing  provisions of this Article VIII and who are or were employees or
agents of the  Corporation, or who are or were serving at the request of the
Corporation as  employees or agents of another corporation, partnership,
joint venture, trust or  other enterprise, may be indemnified to the extent
authorized at any time or  from time to time by the Board of Directors.

 

ARTICLE IX

 

Limitations on Directors\' Liability

  A  director of the Corporation shall not be personally liable
to the Corporation or  its stockholders for monetary damages for breach of
fiduciary duty as a  director, except: (i) for any breach of the director\'s
duty of loyalty to the  Corporation or its stockholders, (ii) for acts or
omissions that are not in good  faith or that involve intentional misconduct
or a knowing violation of law,  (iii) under Section 174 of the General
Corporation Law of the State of Delaware  or (iv) for any transaction from
which the director derived any improper  personal benefit. If the General
Corporation Law of the State of Delaware or  other Delaware law is amended or
enacted after the date of filing of this  Certificate of Incorporation to
further limit or eliminate the personal  liability of directors, then the
liability of a director of the Corporation  shall be limited or eliminated to
the fullest extent permitted by the General  Corporation Law of the State of
Delaware, as so amended, or such other Delaware  law. Any repeal or
modification of the foregoing paragraph by the stockholders  of the
Corporation shall not adversely affect any right or protection of a  director
of the Corporation existing at the time of such repeal or  modification.

 

ARTICLE X

 

Reorganization

  Whenever  a compromise or arrangement is proposed between the
Corporation and its  creditors or any class of them and/or between the
Corporation and its  stockholders or any class of them, any court of
equitable jurisdiction within  the State of Delaware may, on the application
in a summary way of the  Corporation or of any creditor or stockholder
thereof or on the application of  any receiver or receivers appointed for the
Corporation under Section 291 of  Title 8 of the Delaware Code or on the
application of trustees in dissolution or  of any receiver or receivers
appointed for the Corporation under Section 279 of  Title 8 of the Delaware
Code order a meeting of the creditors or class of  creditors, and/or of the
stockholders or class of stockholders of the  Corporation, as the case may
be, to be summoned in such manner as the said court  directs. If a majority
in number representing three fourths in value of the  creditors or class of
creditors, and/or of the stockholders or class of  stockholders of the
Corporation, as the case may be, agree to any compromise or  arrangement and
to any reorganization of the Corporation as consequence of such  compromise
or arrangement, the said compromise or arrangement and the said 
reorganization shall, if sanctioned by the court to which the said
application  has been made, be binding on all the creditors or class of
creditors, and/or on  all the stockholders or class of stockholders, of the
Corporation, as the case  may be, and also on the Corporation.

  ARTICLE XI

 

Amendment of Certificate of Incorporation

  The  Corporation reserves the right to amend, alter or repeal
any provision contained  in this Certificate of Incorporation in the manner
now or hereafter prescribed  by statute, and all rights of stockholders
herein are subject to this  reservation.

    THE UNDERSIGNED, being the sole incorporator above  named, for the purpose of forming a corporation pursuant to the General  Corporation Law of the State of Delaware, has signed this instrument this 22nd  day of January, 2018.

U.S. Geothermal Inc. 
  390 E. Parkcenter Boulevard, Suite 250 
  Boise, ID 83706 
 

 

Re: _Cancellation  and Termination of Options_

 

Ladies and Gentlemen:

 

This is to confirm that:

     1\.   |

I am the holder of the options to purchase the number of  shares of Common
Stock, par value $0.001 per share (the "Common  Stock"), of U.S. Geothermal
Inc., a Delaware corporation (the  "Company") at the exercise prices listed
on Schedule 1 (the  "Options").

  
      |   
    2\.   |

I elect to have all of my options cancelled and  terminated in exchange for
the right to receive a cash payment equal to  the _excess of_ (x) $5.45 per
share of Common Stock subject to the  Options _over_ (y) the exercise price
per share of Common Stock  subject to the Options ("Designated
Consideration"), less any taxes  required to be withheld as set forth below,
in each case as provided in  the Agreement and Plan of Merger, dated as of
January 24, 2018 (the  "Merger Agreement"), by and among the Company, Ormat
Nevada Inc., a  Delaware corporation ("Buyer") and OGP Holding Corp., a
Delaware  corporation ("Merger Sub") and a wholly-owned subsidiary of 
Parent.

  
      |   
    3\.   |

I represent and understand  that:

  
   
       | a.   |

I am the owner of the Options, free and clear of all  liens, claims and
encumbrances;

  
      |   |   
      | b.   |

I have not exercised, sold, assigned, given away or  otherwise transferred,
in any way, any right, title or interest in, to or  under the Options or the
option agreements related thereto;

  
      |   |   
      | c.   |

I have the legal capacity to execute and deliver this  Agreement and to
consummate the transactions contemplated to be performed  by me under this
Agreement;

  
      |   |   
      | d.   |

This Agreement is my binding obligation, enforceable  against me in
accordance with its terms; and        | e.   |

I have received and had an opportunity to review the  proxy statement dated
[], 2018 which the Company sent to its stockholders  and option holders in
connection with the transactions contemplated by the  Merger Agreement (the
"Company Proxy Statement") and such other  information as I have considered
relevant for purposes of entering into  this Agreement.

  
   
     4\.   |

I understand that as a result of the cancellation and  termination of the
Options and my receipt of the Designated Consideration,  I may incur a tax
liability which I must pay. I further understand and  agree that the Company
will withhold all applicable federal, state and  local income and employment
taxes required to be withheld from the  Designated Consideration before
paying the balance to me.

  
      |   
    5\.   |

_Effective upon cancellation and termination of the  Options and the payment
to me of the Designated Consideration, less any  taxes required to be
withheld, I hereby irrevocably release, waive and  relinquish any and all
rights, claims and benefits which I may have with  respect to the Options and
with respect to shares of Common Stock that  would have been issuable upon
exercise of the Options (including, without  limitation, any rights I may
have under the Company s 2009 Stock Incentive  Plan (the "Plan"), any Option
award letter or grant instrument or any  other plans, contracts, agreements
or understandings related thereto),  except for the right to receive the
Designated  Consideration._

  
      |   
    6\.   |

This Agreement will remain in full force and effect  notwithstanding my death
or incapacity and will be binding upon my heirs,  executors, administrators,
successors and assigns.

  
      |   
    7\.   |

This Agreement will be governed by and construed in  accordance with the
internal laws of the State of Delaware (both  substantive and procedural)
without giving effect to any choice or  conflict of law provision or rule
(whether of the State of Delaware or any  other jurisdiction) that would
cause the application of laws of any  jurisdiction other than those of the
State of Delaware.

  
      |   
    8\.   |

I hereby irrevocably and unconditionally agree that any  claim, action, suit
or proceeding with respect to this Agreement and the  rights and obligations
arising hereunder, or any matter related to or  arising out of or in
connection with this Agreement shall be brought and  determined exclusively
in the Delaware Chancery Court and any state  appellate court therefrom
within the State of Delaware, or, if and only if  the Delaware Chancery Court
shall not have or declines to accept  jurisdiction over a particular matter,
in any federal court located in the  State of Delaware or other Delaware
state court. I further agree that the  mailing of any process, summons,
notice or document in connection with any  such claim, action, suit or
proceeding hand delivered or sent by U.S.  registered mail to my address
below will be valid and sufficient service  thereof. I irrevocably and
unconditionally submit with regard to any such  claim, action, suit or
proceeding for myself and in respect of my  property, generally and
unconditionally, to the jurisdiction of  the aforesaid courts and agree that
I will not bring any  action relating to this Agreement in any court or
tribunal other than the  aforesaid courts. I irrevocably and unconditionally
waive, and agree not  to assert, by way of motion, as a defense, counterclaim
or otherwise, in  any action or proceeding with respect to this Agreement and
the rights and  obligations arising hereunder, or for recognition and
enforcement of any  judgment in respect of this Agreement and the rights and
obligations  arising hereunder: (a) any claim that I am not personally
subject to the  jurisdiction of the above named courts for any reason other
than the  failure to serve process in accordance herewith, (b) any claim that
I or  my property is exempt or immune from jurisdiction of any such court
or  from any legal process commenced in such courts (whether through
service  of notice, attachment prior to judgment, attachment in aid of
execution of  judgment, execution of judgment or otherwise) and (c) to the
fullest  extent permitted by applicable law, any claim that (i) the suit,
action or  proceeding in such court is brought in an inconvenient forum, (ii)
the  venue of such suit, action or proceeding is improper or (iii) this 
Agreement, or the subject matter hereof, may not be enforced in or by such 
courts.

  
     
     9\.   |

I HEREBY IRREVOCABLY AND UNCONDITIONALLY WAIVE ANY RIGHT  I MAY HAVE TO A
TRIAL BY JURY IN RESPECT OF ANY ACTION, SUIT OR PROCEEDING  ARISING OUT OF OR
RELATING TO THIS AGREEMENT.
