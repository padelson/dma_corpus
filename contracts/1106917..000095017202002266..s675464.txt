without limitation: (a) all liabilities and obligations relating to Excluded
Assets; (b) except to the extent provided in Section 5.08, Tax liabilities of
the Seller arising out of or attributable to the transactions contemplated
hereby or relating to the Purchased Assets for periods up to and including
the Closing Date; (c) all liabilities or obligations attributable to any
failure by the Seller to comply with the terms of the Assumed Contracts prior
to the Closing Date but only to the extent that such liabilities or
obligations relate to the conduct of the Business prior to the Closing Date;
and (d) accounts payable arising under the Assumed Contracts prior to the
Closing Date and not included in Net Working Liabilities.   SECTION 2.05.
Assignment of Contracts and Rights. Anything in this Agreement to the
contrary notwithstanding, this Agreement shall not constitute an agreement to
assign any Purchased Asset or any claim or right or any benefit arising
thereunder or resulting therefrom if an attempted assignment thereof, without
consent of a third party thereto, would constitute a breach or other
contravention thereof or in any way adversely affect the rights of the Buyer,
Acquisition Sub or the Seller thereunder. The Seller will use its reasonable
efforts (but without making any payments or incurring out-of-pocket expenses
and without commencing any legal proceeding), and the Buyer will actively
assist the Seller, to obtain the consent of the other parties to any such
Purchased Asset or claim or right or any benefit arising thereunder for the
assignment thereof to Acquisition Sub. If such consent is not obtained, or if
an attempted assignment thereof would be ineffective or would adversely
affect the rights of the Seller thereunder so that Acquisition Sub would not
in fact receive all such rights, the Seller, the Buyer and Acquisition Sub
will cooperate in a mutually agreeable arrangement under which Acquisition
Sub would obtain the benefits and assume the obligations thereunder in
accordance with this Agreement, including, without limitation,
subcontracting, sub-licensing, or subleasing to Acquisition Sub, or under
which the Seller would enforce for the benefit of Acquisition Sub, with
Acquisition Sub assuming the applicable Seller\'s or Seller\'s obligations,
any and all rights of the Seller against a third party thereto, and any
amount received by the Seller in respect thereof shall be held for and paid
over to Acquisition Sub.   SECTION 2.06. Purchase Price; Escrow.   (a) The
purchase price for the Purchased Assets shall be $2,630,000 (the "Purchase
Price"), subject to a Purchase Price Adjustment. The Purchase Price shall be
payable by the issuance of such number of shares of Buyer Common Stock (the
"Securities"), valued at the Stock Value, as equal the Purchase Price,
subject to a Purchase Price Adjustment; provided, however, that in the event
that the Stock Value is less than $1.30 on the Determination Date, at the
Seller\'s election made on the Determination Date, the Purchase Price shall
be payable with a combination of (x) cash (in whole or in part) by wire
transfer of immediately available funds (the "Cash Consideration") and/or (y)
Securities (in whole or in part), to be issued on the Closing Date, with such
Securities being valued at the Stock Value. Such Cash Consideration and such
Securities shall be subject, in each case, to a Purchase Price Adjustment.
The Purchase Price, net of any Purchase Price Adjustment, shall be paid as
follows:   (i) The Purchase Price, net of any Purchase Price Adjustment 
and less the Escrowed Consideration, shall be paid or issued, as the  case
may be, to the Seller on the Closing Date (the "Closing  Consideration");
and   (ii) Twenty percent (20%) of the Cash Consideration, if any,  and
twenty percent (20%) of the Securities, if any, shall be deposited  in escrow
(the "Escrowed Consideration") on the Closing Date pursuant  to the terms of
the Escrow Agreement.   (b) The Securities shall be appropriately adjusted
for any  stock split, combination, reorganization, recapitalization, 
reclassification, stock dividend, stock distribution or similar event  having
a record date on or after the date hereof.  SECTION 2.07. Purchase Price
Adjustment   (a) At the Closing, the Purchase Price shall be adjusted
as follows:   (i) In the event that the Adjusted Revenue Run-Rate is less 
than the Revenue Run-Rate, the Purchase Price shall be reduced by an  amount
equal to (A) the amount of the difference between the Adjusted  Revenue Run-
Rate and the Revenue Run-Rate, multiplied by (B) 0.60.   (ii) In the event
that the Adjusted Revenue Run-Rate is  greater than the Revenue Run-Rate, the
Purchase Price shall be  increased by an amount equal to (A) the amount of
the difference  between the Adjusted Revenue Run-Rate and the Revenue Run-
Rate,  multiplied by (B) 0.60.   (b) Any such adjustment described in this
Section 2.07 shall be a "Purchase Price Adjustment".   SECTION 2.08.
Closing. The closing (the "Closing") of the purchase and sale of the
Purchased Assets and the assumption of the Assumed Liabilities hereunder
shall take place at the offices of the Buyer, 601 West 26th Street, New York,
NY 10001, as soon as possible, but in no event later than five Business Days
after satisfaction of the conditions set forth in Article VIII, or at such
other time or place as Buyer and Seller may agree. At the Closing:   (a)
The Buyer shall deliver the Purchase Price, net of any Purchase Price
Adjustment, in accordance with Section 2.06;   (b) Each of the Seller and
Acquisition Sub shall enter into an Assignment and Assumption Agreement, in
substantially the form attached hereto as Exhibit D, and a Bill of Sale, in
substantially the form attached hereto as Exhibit E, and the Seller shall
deliver to the Acquisition Sub such deeds, bills of sale, endorsements,
consents, assignments (including, without limitation, trademark, trade name
and domain name assignments) and other good and sufficient instruments of
conveyance and assignment (the "Conveyance Documents") as the parties and
their respective counsel shall deem reasonably necessary or appropriate to
vest in Acquisition Sub good and valid title in and to the Purchased Assets,
free and clear of all Liens other than Permitted Exceptions; and   (c) Each
of the Seller, the Buyer and Acquisition Sub shall enter into the other
Ancillary Agreements to which it is a party.    ARTICLE III  
REPRESENTATIONS AND WARRANTIES OF THE SELLER   The Seller hereby represents
and warrants to the Buyer and Acquisition Sub, subject to the exceptions
specifically disclosed in writing in the Seller\'s schedules as set forth
below, in each case as of the date hereof and as of the Closing Date,
that:   SECTION 3.01. Capitalization. The authorized capital stock of
the Seller consists of 42,232,611 shares of the Seller Common Stock,
and 32,767,389 shares of the Seller Preferred Stock of which 23,466,794
are designated the Seller Series A Preferred Stock and 9,300,595 are
designated the Seller Series B Preferred Stock. There are outstanding 100
shares of the Seller Common Stock and 23,466,794 shares of the Seller Series
A Preferred Stock and 9,300,595 shares of the Seller Series B Preferred
Stock and the Seller has no other shares of capital stock authorized, issued
or outstanding. All of the outstanding shares of capital stock of the
Seller have been duly authorized, validly issued and are fully paid
and nonassessable.   SECTION 3.02. Organization and Qualification;
Subsidiaries of the Seller. The Seller is duly organized and is validly
existing and in good standing under the Laws of the jurisdiction of its
incorporation and has the requisite corporate power and authority to own,
lease and operate its properties and to carry on its business as it is now
being conducted. The Seller is duly qualified or licensed to do business, and
is in good standing, in each jurisdiction where the character of the
properties owned, leased or operated by it or the nature of its business
makes such qualification or licensing necessary, except for such failures to
be so qualified and in good standing that would not reasonably be likely
to, individually or in the aggregate, result in a Material Adverse
Effect. Except as set forth on Schedule 3.02, the Seller has no Subsidiaries
that have any interest in the Purchased Assets or conduct the Business
as currently conducted.   SECTION 3.03. Corporate Authorization. The Seller
has the necessary corporate power and authority to execute and deliver
this Agreement and each of the Ancillary Agreements to which it is a party,
to perform its obligations hereunder and thereunder, and to consummate
the transactions contemplated hereby and thereby. The execution, delivery
and performance by the Seller of this Agreement and each of the
Ancillary Agreements to which it is a party, and the consummation by the
Seller of the transactions contemplated hereby and thereby have been duly
authorized by all necessary corporate action on the part of the Seller and no
other corporate proceedings on the part of any of the Seller are necessary
to authorize this Agreement or any of the Ancillary Agreements or
to consummate the transactions contemplated hereby or thereby. This
Agreement and each of the Ancillary Agreements have been, or, in the case of
the Ancillary Agreements, will be, duly executed and delivered by the
Seller and constitute valid and binding agreements of the Seller, as the case
may be, enforceable against the Seller, in accordance with their
respective terms, except as the same may be limited by bankruptcy,
insolvency, reorganization, moratorium or similar Laws now or hereafter in
effect relating to creditors\' rights generally and subject to general
principles of equity and public policy. This Agreement and the sale of the
Purchased Assets has been approved by the Stockholder Approvals which are
the requisite vote or action of the Seller\'s stockholders under the
Seller\'s amended and restated certificate of incorporation (including,
without limitation, the certificates of designations of the Seller
Preferred Stock), by-laws and the DGCL.   SECTION 3.04. Governmental
Authorization. The execution, delivery and performance by the Seller of this
Agreement and each of the Ancillary Agreements to which it is a party, and
the consummation by the Seller of the transactions contemplated hereby and
thereby, do not and will not require any action by or in respect of, or
filing with, any Governmental Entity, except for such actions or filings the
failure of which to be made or obtained would not, individually or in the
aggregate, reasonably be expected to result in a Material Adverse Effect.  
SECTION 3.05. Non-Contravention. The execution, delivery and performance by
the Seller of this Agreement and each of the Ancillary Agreements to which it
is a party, and the consummation by the Seller of the transactions
contemplated hereby and thereby, do not and will not (i) contravene or
conflict with the certificate of incorporation or bylaws of the Seller; (ii)
contravene or conflict with or constitute a material violation of any
provision of any Law, judgment, injunction, order or decree binding upon or
applicable to the Seller or to the Business or relating to or affecting the
Purchased Assets; (iii) except as set forth on Schedule 3.05, assuming the
receipt of all Required Consents, constitute a default under or give rise to
any right of termination, cancellation or acceleration of any right or
obligation of the Seller or to a loss of any material benefit relating to or
affecting the Purchased Assets to which the Seller is entitled under any
provision of any material Assumed Contract binding upon the Seller or by
which any of the Purchased Assets is or may be bound, or any Permit or (iv)
result in the creation or imposition of any Lien other than Permitted
Exceptions on any Purchased Asset except for, in the case of clauses (ii),
(iii) and (iv), any conflict, breach, contravention, violation, default,
termination, acceleration, violation, or Lien that would not, individually or
in the aggregate, reasonably be expected to result in a Material Adverse
Effect. The Seller is not in material default (and no event has occurred
which, with notice or lapse of time or both, would cause the Seller to be in
default) under, nor has there occurred any event giving others (with notice
or lapse of time or both) any rights of termination, amendment, acceleration
or cancellation of, any Assumed Contract to which the Seller is a party.  
SECTION 3.06. Required Consents. Schedule 3.06 sets forth each Assumed
Contract requiring a consent, waiver, authorization, exemption, filing with,
or notice to, any Person or approval as a result of the execution, delivery
and performance of this Agreement and the Ancillary Agreements or the
consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby and thereby (each such
consent, a "Required Consent"). Neither the execution, delivery or
performance of this Agreement or the Ancillary Agreements by the Seller, nor
the consummation by the Seller of the transactions contemplated hereby or
thereby (including, without limitation, the transfer of the Assumed
Contracts) requires any consent of, waiver by, authorization by, exemption
from, filing with, or notice to any Person, other than a Required
Consent.   SECTION 3.07. Financial Statements. The Seller
Financial Statements were prepared in conformity with GAAP (except, in the
case of the unaudited interim financials, for the absence of footnotes and
year-end audit adjustments) and fairly present, in all material respects,
the financial position and results of operations of the Seller as of the
dates, and for the periods, referred to therein. The accounts receivable of
the Seller included in the Purchased Assets represent valid obligations
arising in the ordinary course of business from sales actually made or
services actually performed by the Seller and are not subject to any
material setoff, counterclaim or defense. The accounts receivable included in
the Purchased Assets are current and collectible net of the respective
reserves shown on Schedule 3.07. Except as indicated on Schedule 3.07, no
such account debtor has in the past, or currently, refused to pay, disputed
or, to the Knowledge of the Seller, threatened to dispute amounts
presently included in the accounts receivable included in the Purchased
Assets. Schedule 3.07 contains a complete and accurate list of all
accounts receivable included in the Purchased Assets as of September 30,
2002, which list sets forth the aging of such accounts receivable.  
SECTION 3.08. No Undisclosed Liabilities. There are no liabilities relating
to or affecting the Purchased Assets of any kind whatsoever, whether accrued,
contingent, absolute, determined, determinable or otherwise, and there is no
existing condition, situation or set of circumstances which could reasonably
be expected to result in such a liability other than (i) liabilities
specifically disclosed in any schedule hereto, or (ii) liabilities that,
individually or in the aggregate, do not result in a Material Adverse
Effect.   SECTION 3.09. Absence of Certain Changes. Since December 31,
2001, except as set forth in Schedule 3.09, the Seller has utilized the
Purchased Assets in the ordinary course consistent with past practices, and
there has not been:   (a) any Material Adverse Effect or any event,
occurrence, development or state of circumstances or facts known to the
Seller which could reasonably be expected to result in a Material Adverse
Effect;   (b) any event that would reasonably be expected to prevent
or materially delay the performance of the obligations of the Seller
pursuant to this Agreement or the Ancillary Agreements;   (c) any creation
or other incurrence of any Lien other than Permitted Exceptions on any
Purchased Asset or any failure to discharge or satisfy any such Lien or pay
or satisfy any obligation or liability (whether absolute, accrued, contingent
or otherwise) relating to or affecting the Purchased Assets;   (d) any
material damage, destruction or other casualty loss (whether or not covered
by insurance) relating to or affecting any Purchased Asset;   (e) any
material transaction or Contract entered into by the Seller relating to any
Purchased Asset (including the acquisition or disposition of any assets) or
any relinquishment by the Seller of any such Contract or other right relating
to any Purchased Asset, in either case, other than transactions and
commitments in the ordinary course of business consistent with past practices
and those contemplated by this Agreement;   (f) any settlement, waiver,
release, assignment or compromise relating to or affecting any action, suit,
proceeding, claim arbitration or litigation affecting the Purchased
Assets;   (g) any sale or transfer of any of the Purchased
Assets (including, without limitation, any disposition or license of
any Proprietary Rights) or cancellation of any debts or claims relating to
the Purchased Assets or waiver of any rights relating thereto; or   (h) any
authorization of, or agreement entered into or commitment made to do any of
the foregoing.   SECTION 3.10. Title to Purchased Assets. The Seller has
good and valid title to, or enforceable leasehold interests in or valid
rights under contract to use the Purchased Assets, free and clear of any
Liens, except for Permitted Exceptions as well as Liens set forth on Schedule
3.10. Upon consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby, Acquisition
Sub will have acquired good and valid title to, or enforceable leasehold
interests in or valid rights under contract to use the Purchased Assets, free
and clear of all Liens, except for Permitted Exceptions and subject to
the Assumed Liabilities. Schedule 3.10 contains an accurate list of the
owned tangible personal property which are Purchased Assets as of the date
hereof and which comprise subsection (d) of Exhibit A. All of the
material, machinery and equipment listed on Schedule 3.10 are in good working
order and condition, ordinary wear and tear excepted. All of the Purchased
Assets located in the United States of America are located only in the State
of New York, the State of New Jersey or the State of Delaware.   SECTION
3.11. Solvency. The Seller (i) is not insolvent, (ii) will not be rendered
insolvent by the transactions contemplated herein, (iii) after giving effect
to the transactions contemplated herein, will not be left with unreasonably
small capital with which to engage in its business, (iv) does not intend to
incur debts that will be beyond its ability to pay as such debts mature and
(v) is not subject to any Bankruptcy Event. The board of directors of the
Seller has determined, partly based on a favorable valuation opinion received
from its financial adviser, that if the transactions contemplated hereby are
consummated, the Seller would receive not less than a reasonably equivalent
value for the Purchased Assets. For the purposes of this Agreement,
"insolvent" shall mean that the current liabilities of the Seller exceed the
Seller\'s current assets.   SECTION 3.12. Litigation. Except as set forth on
Schedule 3.12 and excluding routine proceedings before the U.S. Patent and
Trademark Office or similar offices, there is no action, suit, claim,
investigation or proceeding pending against, or to the Knowledge of the
Seller, threatened against, or relating to or affecting, any Purchased Asset
before any court or arbitrator or any governmental body, agency or official.
To the Knowledge of the Seller, there are no existing facts or circumstances
that could reasonably be expected to result in such an action, suit,
claim, investigation or proceeding. The Seller is not subject to any
outstanding order, writ, injunction or decree which could reasonably be
expected to have, individually or in the aggregate, a Material Adverse Effect
or materially interfere with the Seller\'s ability to consummate
the transactions contemplated hereby or by the Ancillary Agreements.  
SECTION 3.13. Material Contracts.   (a) Except for the Contracts disclosed
in Schedule 3.13(a), the Seller is not a party to or subject to:   (i) a
source code escrow type arrangement;   (ii) an Assumed Contract which has
been modified orally or in  writing or by course of conduct to provide for
terms or conditions  other than as set forth in the copies provided to Buyer;
or   (iii) any Assumed Contract that substantially limits the  freedom of
the Seller to compete in the line of Business or with any  Person in the
Business or in any area or to own, operate, sell,  transfer, pledge or
otherwise dispose of or encumber any Purchased  Asset, or that would so limit
the freedom of the Buyer or Acquisition  Sub after the Closing Date.   (b)
Schedule 3.13(b) lists all Persons that were as of the date hereof customers
of the Seller pursuant to an Assumed Contract as well as (i) the gross amount
billed to each such customer for the month of September 2002, (ii) the
Monthly-Revenue Run Rate for each such customer and (iii) the calculations
used to determine each such customer\'s Monthly Revenue Run-Rate including
the assumed variable billings used. Schedule 3.13(b) is true, complete and
correct in all respects. Except as set forth under the heading "calculation
notes" in Schedule 3.13(b), since July 1, 2002, no such customer has canceled
or otherwise terminated or, to the Knowledge of the Seller, threatened to
cancel or otherwise terminate its relationship with the Seller.   (c)
Except as set forth on Schedule 3.13(c), each Assumed Contract is a valid and
binding agreement of the Seller and is in full force and effect, and neither
of the Seller nor, to the Knowledge of the Seller, any other party thereto,
is in default in any material respect under the terms of any Assumed
Contract, nor, to the Knowledge of the Seller, has any event or circumstance
occurred that, with notice or lapse of time or both, would constitute a
material event of default thereunder.   SECTION 3.14. Licenses and Permits.
Except as set forth in Section 3.16(h)(1), the Seller has no material
licenses, franchises, permits or other similar authorizations affecting, or
relating in any way to, the Purchased Assets (the "Permits"), and no such
Permits are necessary to use the Purchased Assets.   SECTION 3.15.
Compliance with Laws. The Seller is not in violation of, has not violated,
and, to the Knowledge of the Seller, is not under investigation with respect
to or has been threatened to be charged with or given notice of any violation
of, any Law or judgment, order or decree entered by any court, arbitrator or
governmental authority, domestic or foreign, applicable to the Purchased
Assets or the conduct of the Business, except where such violation would not
reasonably be likely to result in a Material Adverse Effect. No material
violation of any Law relating to or affecting any Purchased Asset currently
exists. There are no developments relating to or affecting any of the
Purchased Assets pending or, to the Knowledge of the Seller, threatened,
which might reasonably be likely to materially detract from the value of such
Purchased Assets.   SECTION 3.16. Proprietary Rights.   (a) Schedule
3.16(a) contains a true and complete list of all U.S. and foreign (i)
applications and registrations related to the Seller\'s Proprietary Rights,
including issue and/or filing dates and (ii) material unregistered
copyrights, trademarks, service marks, trade names, designs, logos and
slogans that are included in the Seller\'s Proprietary Rights. All of the
Seller\'s Proprietary Rights that are registered have been duly maintained
and remain in good standing with all fees and filings due as of the Closing
Date.   (b) The Seller\'s Proprietary Rights contain only those items
and rights which are: (i) owned by the Seller; or (ii) rightfully used by
the Seller pursuant to a valid and enforceable license or other agreement
(the "Seller Licensed Intellectual Property"), the parties, date, term
and subject matter of each such material license or other agreement (each,
a "License Agreement") being set forth on Schedule 3.16(b)(1). The Seller
has all rights in the Seller\'s Proprietary Rights necessary to carry out
the Seller\'s activities at the time such activities were being conducted,
the Seller\'s Proprietary Rights necessary to carry out the Seller\'s
activities of the Business, as currently conducted, including without
limitation, to the extent required to carry out such activities, rights to
make, use, reproduce, modify, adapt, create derivative works based on,
translate, distribute (directly and indirectly), transmit, display and
perform publicly, license, rent and lease and, other than with respect to
Seller Licensed Intellectual Property, assign and sell, the Seller\'s
Proprietary Rights (collectively, "Use"). The License Agreements are valid
and binding obligations of the Seller, enforceable in accordance with their
terms, and there exists no event or condition which will result in a
material violation or breach of, or constitute a material default by the
Seller or, to the Knowledge of the Seller, the other party thereto, under any
such License Agreement. Except as set forth in Schedule 3.16(b)(2), the
Seller does not have any agreements or arrangements with any Persons related
to Trade Secrets of such Persons or restricting any Seller\'s ability to
engage in business activities of any nature.   (c) To the Knowledge of the
Seller and except as set forth in Schedule 3.12, the Seller\'s Proprietary
Rights as now used or offered for use by the Seller in the Business do not
infringe on any Proprietary Right of any Person, anywhere in the world. The
Seller has not received notice of any claims (i) challenging the validity,
effectiveness or, other than with respect to Seller Licensed Intellectual
Property, ownership by a Seller of any of the Seller\'s Proprietary Rights,
or (ii) to the effect that the Use or any other exercise of rights in
Seller\'s Proprietary Rights by the Seller through the Business or their
agents or use by its customers infringes or misappropriates or may infringe
on or misappropriate any Proprietary Right of any Person. To the Knowledge of
the Seller, no such claims have been threatened by any person, nor are there
any valid grounds for any bona fide claim of any such kind. All of the
registered Patents, Copyrights and Trademarks within Seller\'s Proprietary
Rights are valid and subsisting in full force and effect and have not been
cancelled, expired or abandoned. The Seller has not agreed, except in the
ordinary course of business consistent with past practices, to indemnify any
Person for or against any interference, infringement, misappropriation or
other conflict with respect to any item of the Seller\'s Proprietary Rights.
To the Knowledge of the Seller, there is no unauthorized use,
infringement, dilution, misappropriation or other violation of any Seller\'s
Proprietary Rights by any third party, employee or former employee.   (d)
Except as set forth on Schedule 3.16(d), to the Knowledge of the Seller, all
personnel, including employees, agents, consultants and contractors, who, to
the Knowledge of the Seller, have contributed to or participated in the
conception and development of the Seller\'s Proprietary Rights (excluding
Seller Licensed Intellectual Property), have executed nondisclosure or
similar agreements and, to the Knowledge of the Seller, those who
significantly contributed to the development of the Seller\'s Proprietary
Rights either (i) have been a party to a "work-for-hire" arrangement or
agreements with Seller prepared in accordance with applicable Law that
accorded the Seller full, exclusive and original ownership of all Proprietary
Rights thereby arising, or (ii) have executed appropriate instruments of
assignment in favor of the Seller as assignee that have conveyed to the
Seller exclusive ownership of such Proprietary Rights.   (e) The source
code and documentation relating to the software programs owned by the Seller
and incorporated in Seller\'s Proprietary Rights ("Software Programs") and
all other Trade Secrets of the Seller incorporated in the Seller\'s
Proprietary Rights have been maintained in confidence and only (i) have been
disclosed by the Seller to its employees while the Seller has exercised
reasonable measures to maintain such confidence, or (ii) have been disclosed
to those third parties who have a "need to know" the contents thereof and who
have executed nondisclosure agreements with the Seller, in each case which
adequately protects the Seller\'s proprietary interest therein. The Seller
has taken reasonably sufficient measures to protect the confidentiality of
the Seller\'s Proprietary Rights.   (f) The Seller and its Affiliates do
not owe any royalties or other payments to third parties in respect of the
Seller\'s Proprietary Rights, except as set forth on Schedule 3.16(f).  
(g) To the Knowledge of the Seller, the Software Programs contain no
"viruses." For the purposes of this Agreement, "virus" means any computer
code intentionally designed to disrupt, disable or harm in any manner the
operation of any software or hardware. To the Knowledge of the Seller, none
of the Software Programs contain any worm, bomb, backdoor, clock, timer, or
other disabling device, code, design or routine which causes the Software
Programs to be erased, inoperable, or otherwise incapable of being used,
either automatically or upon command by any party.   (h) Schedule 3.16(h)(1)
contains a true and complete list of material licenses or other agreements
with third parties wherein the Seller has licensed or otherwise provided any
rights to any of the Seller\'s Proprietary Rights to such third party, except
for rights granted to customers in the Assumed Contracts. Except as set forth
in Schedule 3.16(h)(2), the Seller has not granted to any third party any
exclusive rights of any kind (including, without limitation, exclusivity with
regard to categories of advertisers on any World Wide Web site,
territorial exclusivity or exclusivity with respect to particular
versions, implementations or translations of any of the Seller\'s Proprietary
Rights), nor has the Seller granted any third party any right to market any
of the Seller\'s Proprietary Rights under any private label, "OEM" or
other arrangements. To the Knowledge of the Seller, except as set forth
in Schedule 3.16(h)(3), no employee of the Seller has any agreements
or arrangements with any Persons other than the Seller related to
Trade Secrets of such Persons or restricting any such employees\' ability
to engage in business activities of any nature. To the Knowledge of
the Seller, the activities of the Seller\'s present employees on behalf of
the Seller do not violate any such agreements or arrangements.   (i) Except
as would not be expected to have a Material Adverse Effect on the Seller\'s
rights therein, the Trademarks listed in Schedule 3.16(a) for which the
Seller have obtained or applied for a registration have been continuously
used in the form appearing in, and in connection with the goods and services
listed in, their respective registration certificates. To the Knowledge of
the Seller, there has been no prior use of such Trademarks by any third party
that would confer upon said third party superior rights in such Trademarks.
The Seller has diligently policed the material Trademarks against third party
infringement so as to maintain the validity of such Trademarks.   SECTION
3.17. Employees. Schedule 3.17 sets forth as of September 30, 2002 a list of
the names, titles, locations, annual salaries and stock option grants of all
employees, independent consultants and leased or temporary employees of the
Seller; and all of the information in Schedule 3.17 is true, complete and
correct in all material respects. The Seller\'s classification of all
Persons, whom the Seller has treated as independent contractors for any
purpose, satisfies the requirements of Law applicable to the classification
of individuals as independent contractors, and the Seller has fully and
accurately reported the amounts paid by the Seller to or on behalf of such
Persons on IRS Forms 1099 when required to do so.   SECTION 3.18.
Intercompany Arrangements. Except as disclosed in Schedule 3.18, (a) since
September 30, 2002, there have been no material transactions between the
Seller and any of its Subsidiaries, or any director, officer, employee,
stockholder or other Affiliate of the Seller relating to the Purchased
Assets; and (b) no Affiliate of the Seller owns or has any rights in or to
any of the Purchased Assets, or properties or rights used by the Business in
the ordinary course.   SECTION 3.19. Taxes.   (a) Except as set forth on
Schedule 3.19(a), the Seller (i) has filed or there has been filed on its
behalf, within the time and in the manner prescribed by Law (taking into
account any extensions of time permitted by Law), all Returns with respect to
Taxes and all such Returns are true, complete and correct in all material
respects, (ii) has timely paid all Taxes that are required to be paid, except
with respect to matters contested in good faith and as to which adequate cash
reserves have been provided, (iii) has not waived any statute of limitations
with respect to Taxes or agreed to any extension of time within which to file
any Return for any taxable period, which such Return has not since been filed
or to extend the period for the assessment or collection of any Taxes, and
(iv) has provided adequate accruals in its financial statements for the
payment of all Taxes not yet due and payable (including deferred income
taxes).   (b) Except as disclosed on Schedule 3.19(b), there are no
liens for Taxes upon the assets of the Seller except for statutory Liens
for current Taxes, assessments or other governmental charges not yet
delinquent or the amount or validity of which is being contested in good
faith by appropriate proceedings and as to which adequate cash reserves have
been provided.   (c) The Seller is not a party to or bound by or has any
obligation under any written Tax sharing, allocation, indemnity or similar
agreement or arrangement currently effective under which the Seller would be
required to pay income Taxes of any Person other than the Seller.   SECTION
3.20. Finders\' Fees. Other than Marlin and Associates (for which all fees,
commissions and expenses shall be borne by the Seller), there is no
investment banker, broker, finder or other intermediary which has been
retained by or is authorized to act on behalf of the Seller who might be
entitled to any fee or commission from the Seller or any of its Affiliates
upon consummation of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement.  
SECTION 3.21. Employee Benefit Plans.   (a) There have been no material
violations of ERISA, the Code or other applicable Law relating to the
operation and administration of any Plan and, to the Knowledge of the Seller,
no "party in interest" or "disqualified person" with respect to the Plans has
engaged in a "prohibited transaction", as defined in Section 4975 of the Code
or Section 406 of ERISA or taken any actions, or failed to take any actions,
which could reasonably result in any liability to the Buyer or any Affiliate
of the Buyer. The Seller has timely filed all documents and reports
(including Form 5500) for each Plan with all applicable governmental
authorities and has timely furnished all required documents to the
participants or beneficiaries of each such Plan, other than any such failures
that could not reasonably be expected to result in any liability to the Buyer
or any Affiliate of Buyer.   (b) No Plan is subject to Section 302 or Title
IV of ERISA or Section 412 of the Code. No liability under Title IV or
Section 302 of ERISA has been incurred by the Seller or any ERISA Affiliate
that has not been satisfied in full, and no condition exists that presents a
material risk to the Buyer or any ERISA Affiliate of incurring any such
liability, other than liability for premiums due the Pension Benefit
Guaranty Corporation (which premiums have been paid when due).   (c) The
Seller does not maintain or contribute to, and does not have an obligation to
establish, maintain or contribute to, a "multiemployer pension plan," as such
term is defined in Section 3(37) of ERISA.   (d) Except as set forth on
Schedule 3.21, the consummation of the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement will not, either alone or in combination with another event, (i)
entitle any Transferred Employee to severance pay or any other payment under
any Plan, except as expressly provided in this Agreement, or (ii) accelerate
the time of payment or vesting, or increase the amount of compensation due
any Transferred Employee under any Plan.   SECTION 3.22. Related Party
Transactions. Except as set forth on Schedule 3.22 hereto, no employee,
director, officer or stockholder of the Seller and no member of the immediate
family of any employee, officer, director or stockholder of the Seller is
directly or indirectly interested in any Assumed Contract.   SECTION 3.23.
Investment Representations and Warranties. The Seller understands that the
Securities have not been, and will not upon issuance be, registered under the
Securities Act, and that the certificates evidencing the Securities shall
bear a legend to that effect.   SECTION 3.24. Acquisition for Own Account.
The Seller is acquiring the Securities for its own account for investment and
for the account of its stockholders and not with a view toward distribution
in a manner which would violate the Securities Act.   SECTION 3.25. Ability
to Protect Its Own Interests. The Seller represents that by reason of the
business and financial experience of its management, the Seller has the
capacity to protect its own interests in connection with the investment in
the Securities.   SECTION 3.26. Accredited Investor. The Seller represents
that it, and each of its stockholders, is an "accredited investor" as that
term is defined in Regulation D promulgated under the Securities Act.  
SECTION 3.27. Legends. The Seller agrees that the Securities shall not be
sold, transferred, pledged, disposed of or encumbered for the
period beginning on the Closing Date and ending twelve months from the
Closing Date other than a distribution to its stockholders (who shall be
subject to the same transfer restrictions and legends) in a manner which does
not violate the Securities Act. Each certificate representing the
Securities shall bear a legend stating:  "THE ISSUANCE AND SALE OF THE
SECURITIES REPRESENTED BY THIS CERTIFICATE HAVE NOT BEEN REGISTERED UNDER THE
SECURITIES ACT OF 1933, AS AMENDED (THE "ACT"), OR APPLICABLE STATE
SECURITIES LAWS AND THESE SECURITIES MAY NOT BE SOLD OR TRANSFERRED UNLESS
(I) A REGISTRATION STATEMENT COVERING SUCH SALE OR TRANSFER IS EFFECTIVE
UNDER THE ACT OR (II) THE TRANSACTION IS EXEMPT FROM REGISTRATION UNDER THE
ACT, AND IF THE ISSUER REQUESTS, AN OPINION SATISFACTORY TO THE CORPORATION
TO SUCH EFFECT HAS BEEN RENDERED BY COUNSEL."  "THE SECURITIES REPRESENTED
BY THIS CERTIFICATE ARE SUBJECT TO A CONTRACTUAL HOLDING PERIOD SET FORTH IN
THAT CERTAIN ASSET PURCHASE AGREEMENT BETWEEN INLUMEN, INC., BROAD
ACQUISITION CORP. AND THE ISSUER DATED AS OF OCTOBER [ ], 2002. PRIOR TO THE
EXPIRATION OF SUCH HOLDING PERIOD, SUCH SECURITIES MAY NOT BE SOLD,
TRANSFERRED OR ASSIGNED AND THE ISSUER SHALL NOT BE REQUIRED TO GIVE EFFECT
TO ANY ATTEMPTED SALE, TRANSFER OR ASSIGNMENT. UPON THE WRITTEN REQUEST OF
THE HOLDER OF THIS CERTIFICATE, THE ISSUER AGREES TO REMOVE THIS RESTRICTIVE
LEGEND (AND ANY STOP ORDER PLACED WITH ITS TRANSFER AGENT) WHEN THE HOLDING
PERIOD HAS EXPIRED."   SECTION 3.28. Other Information. None of the
Seller\'s representations, warranties or statements contained in this
Agreement, and none of the documents or information delivered to the Buyer in
connection with the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, contain any
untrue statement of a material fact or omits to state a material fact
necessary in order to make the statements contained therein not
misleading.   SECTION 3.29. NewsAlert Assets. Notwithstanding anything in
this Agreement or any Ancillary Agreement to the contrary, the Seller makes
no representations, warranties or similar statements (including
without limitation, pursuant to this Article III) with respect to those
assets identified on Schedule 3.29 (the "NewsAlert Assets") and the
NewsAlert Assets are being transferred "as is"; provided, however, that
this limitation shall not apply to Sections 3.01, 3.02, 3.03, 3.04, 3.07,
3.08, 3.11, 3.12 (except for the second sentence thereof), 3.17, 3.20,
3.21, 3.23, 3.24, 3.25, 3.26, 3.27, or 5.05. For the avoidance of doubt,
the transfer of the rights relating to the NewsAlert Assets is limited to
any rights vested in the Seller as of the Closing Date.   ARTICLE IV

the character of the properties owned, leased or operated by it or the nature
of its business makes such qualification or licensing necessary, except for
such failures to be so qualified and in good standing that would not

material adverse effect on the condition (financial or otherwise) or results
of operations of the Buyer or Acquisition Sub.   SECTION 4.03. Corporate

reasonably be expected to result in a material adverse effect on the
condition (financial or otherwise) or results of operations of the Buyer or
Acquisition Sub and other than filing a Form D with any appropriate
Governmental Entity.   SECTION 4.05. Non-Contravention. The execution,
delivery and performance by each of the Buyer and Acquisition Sub of this
Agreement and each of the Ancillary Agreements to which it is a party, and
the consummation by each of the Buyer and Acquisition Sub of the

4.06. Required Consents. Neither the execution, delivery or performance of
this Agreement or the Ancillary Agreements by the Buyer, nor the consummation

filing with, or notice to any Person, other than filing a Form D with any
appropriate Governmental Entity.   SECTION 4.07. Litigation. There is no
action, suit, claim, investigation or proceeding pending against, or to the
Knowledge of the Buyer, threatened against, or relating to or affecting, the

body, agency or official which in any manner challenges or seeks to
prevent, enjoin, alter materially delay the transactions contemplated hereby
or by the Ancillary Agreements, and, to the Knowledge of the Buyer, there are
no existing facts or circumstances that could reasonably be expected to
result in such an action, suit, claim, investigation or proceeding. Neither
the Buyer nor Acquisition Sub is subject to any outstanding order,

the transactions contemplated hereby or by the Ancillary Agreements.  
SECTION 4.08. Finders\' Fees. There is no investment banker, broker, finder

to result in a material adverse effect on the condition (financial or
otherwise) or results of operations of the Buyer.   SECTION 4.10. SEC
Documents. The Buyer has filed all required registration statements,
prospectuses, reports, schedules, forms, statements and other documents
(including exhibits and all other information incorporated therein) with the
SEC since August 2, 2000 (the "SEC Reports"). As of their respective dates,
the SEC Reports complied in all material respects with the requirements of
the Securities Act or the Securities Exchange Act, as the case may be, and
the rules and regulations of the SEC promulgated thereunder applicable to
such SEC Reports, and none of the SEC Reports when filed contained any untrue
statement of a material fact or omitted to state a material fact required to
be stated therein or necessary in order to make the statements therein, in
light of the circumstances under which they were made, not misleading. The
financial statements of the Buyer included in the SEC Reports complied as to
form, as of their respective dates of filing with the SEC, in all material
respects with applicable accounting requirements and the published rules
and regulations of the SEC with respect thereto, have been prepared

state a material fact necessary in order to make the statements contained
therein not misleading.    ARTICLE V   COVENANTS OF THE SELLER

prevent any such representation or warranty from being inaccurate, untrue or
incomplete at any such time; or   (g) authorize, or agree or commit to

financial advisors, financing sources, auditors and other authorized
representatives and agents, such financial and operating data and other

that any investigation pursuant to this Section 5.02 shall be conducted in
such manner as not to interfere unreasonably with the conduct of the business
of the Seller, and shall be done in such a way as to insure continued
compliance with the Confidentiality Agreement.   SECTION 5.03. Notices of
Certain Events. From the date hereof until the Closing Date, the Seller shall
promptly notify the Buyer of:   (i) any notice or other communication from
any Person  alleging that the consent of such Person is a Required
Consent;   (ii) any notice or other communication from any Governmental 
Entity in connection with the Purchased Assets or the transactions

Material Adverse Effect; and   (iii) any actions, suits, claims,
investigations or  proceedings commenced or, to the Knowledge of the Seller,
threatened  against, relating to or involving or otherwise affecting the
Seller or  the Purchased Assets that, if pending on the date of this
Agreement,  would have been required to have been disclosed pursuant to
Section  3.12 or that otherwise relate to the consummation of the
transactions  contemplated by this Agreement (including, without limitation,
any  Bankruptcy Event).   SECTION 5.04. Noncompetition.   (a) For a three
(3) year period commencing on the Closing Date, neither the Seller nor any of
the Seller\'s Subsidiaries shall, directly or indirectly, as a principal or
for its own or another\'s account, alone or in association with any other
Person, or through any form of ownership in any Person:   (i) engage
(directly or indirectly) in any business anywhere  in the world that competes
with the Business; provided, however, that  an investment by the Seller or
any of its Subsidiaries in any Person  as a passive investor with no more
than 10% of the equity ownership of  such Person shall not be deemed a breach
of this covenant;   (ii) call upon any Person who is, at that time, or was
within  one (1) year prior to that time, an employee of the Buyer or its 
Affiliates for the purpose or with the intent of enticing such  employee away
from or out of the employ of the Buyer or its Affiliates  (it being
understood that a general solicitation in a newspaper or  similar medium
should not be deemed a breach of this covenant);   (iii) call upon any
Person who is, at that time, or has been  within one (1) year prior to that
time, a customer of the Buyer or its  Affiliates for the purpose of
solicitation or selling products or  services in competition with the
Business; or   (iv) publish any statement critical of the Buyer or its 
Affiliates with respect to the Business or the Purchased Assets or 
reasonably likely to adversely affect or otherwise malign the  reputation of
the Buyer or its Affiliates with respect to the Business  or the Purchased
Assets.   (b) If any provision contained in this Section 5.04 shall for
any reason be held invalid, illegal or unenforceable in any respect,
such invalidity, illegality or unenforceability shall not affect any
other provisions of this Section 5.04, but this Section 5.04 shall be
construed as if such invalid, illegal or unenforceable provision had never
been contained herein. It is the intention of the parties that if any of
the restrictions or covenants contained herein is held to cover a
geographic area or to be for a length of time which is not permitted by
applicable Law, or in any way construed to be too broad or to any extent
invalid, such provision shall not be construed to be null, void and of no
effect, but to the extent such provision would be valid or enforceable under
applicable Law, a court of competent jurisdiction shall construe and
interpret or reform this Section 5.04 to provide for a covenant having the
maximum enforceable geographic area, time period and other provisions (not
greater than those contained herein) as shall be valid and enforceable under
such applicable Law. The Seller acknowledges that the Buyer would be
irreparably harmed by any breach of this Section 5.04 and that there would be
no adequate remedy at Law or in damages to compensate the Buyer for any
such breach. The Seller agrees that the Buyer shall be entitled, in addition
to any other available remedy, to injunctive relief requiring
specific performance by the Seller of this Section 5.04 without the necessity
of proving actual damages or the posting of a bond, and the Seller consents
to the entry thereof.   (c) The existence of any claim or cause of action
of the Seller against the Buyer or an Affiliate thereof, whether predicated
on this Agreement, the Ancillary Agreements, or otherwise, shall not
constitute a defense to the enforcement by the Buyer of this Section 5.04. It
is understood by the parties hereto that the covenants contained in
this Section 5.04 are essential elements of this Agreement and that, but for
the agreement of the Seller to comply with such covenants, the Buyer
and Acquisition Sub would not have agreed to enter into this Agreement.
The Seller hereby agrees that all covenants contained in this Section 5.04
are reasonable and valid and waive all defenses to the strict
enforcement hereof by the Buyer and Acquisition Sub. The Seller hereby agrees
that the covenants set forth in this Section 5.04 are a material and
substantial part of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement.  
SECTION 5.05. Name Change. Immediately after the Closing Date, the Seller
shall take such action (at its sole expense), including, without limitation,
filing an amendment to its certificate of incorporation, to cause the
Seller\'s name to be changed to a name which does not include the word
"Inlumen" or "NewsAlert" or a word or phrase confusingly similar thereto. The
Seller shall not use a name or internet uniform resource locator which
includes the word "Inlumen" or "NewsAlert" or a word or phrase confusingly
similar thereto from and after the Closing Date.   SECTION 5.06. Trademarks;
Trade names. As soon as practicable, but in no event later than 60 Business
Days after the Closing Date, the Seller shall cease and desist the use of all

any derivative thereof or any confusingly similar Trademarks on all
advertising, stationery, business cards, checks, purchase orders and
acknowledgments, customer agreements and other material used by the
Seller.   SECTION 5.07. No Negotiation with Third Parties. The Seller
shall not, directly or indirectly, and the Seller shall cause its
officers, directors, employees, accountants, counsel, consultants, advisors,
agents and its Principal Stockholders (collectively, "Representatives") not
to, directly or indirectly, solicit, initiate or encourage (including by way
of furnishing nonpublic information), any inquiries or the making of
any proposal or offer that constitutes, or may reasonably be expected to
lead to, any acquisition of the Purchased Assets, whether by way of
asset purchase, stock purchase, merger or otherwise (a "Competing
Transaction"), or enter into or maintain or continue discussions or negotiate
with any person in furtherance of such inquiries or to obtain a
Competing Transaction, or agree to or endorse any Competing Transaction, or
authorize or permit any of the Seller\'s Representatives or Subsidiaries, or
any Representative retained by any of the Seller\'s Subsidiaries, to take
any such action. The Seller shall immediately cease and cause to be
terminated all existing discussions or negotiations with any parties
conducted heretofore with respect to a Competing Transaction. The Seller
shall, and shall use its best efforts to cause its Representatives to, notify
the Buyer orally and in writing promptly upon receipt of any inquiry, offer
or proposal with respect to a Competing Transaction, including the identity
of the party making such inquiry, offer or proposal and stating the
terms thereof. The Seller shall not release any third party from, or waive
any provision of, any confidentiality or standstill agreement to which it is
a party.   SECTION 5.08. Tax Matters.   (a) Any transfer, documentary,
sales, use, registration, value-added or other similar Taxes (including all
applicable real estate transfer Taxes) and related fees (including any
penalty, interest or addition to Taxes) assessed upon or with respect to the
transfer of the Purchased Assets to the Buyer shall be paid equally by the
Buyer and the Seller. The Seller and the Buyer shall cooperate in timely
making all filings, returns, reports and forms as may be required to comply
with the provisions of such transfer Tax Laws. To the extent legally able to
do so, the Buyer shall deliver to the Seller exemption certificates
satisfactory in form and substance to the Seller with respect to transfer
Taxes if such delivery would reduce the amount of transfer Taxes that would
otherwise be imposed.   (b) Any real or personal property or similar Taxes
assessed on a periodic basis with respect to any of the Purchased Assets for
any taxable period commencing prior to the Closing Date and ending after the
Closing Date, shall be apportioned between Buyer and the Seller based on a
pro ration of days in a manner consistent with Section 164(d) of the Code.
All such prorations shall be allocated so that items relating to time
periods ending on or prior to the Closing Date shall be allocated to the
Seller and items relating to time periods beginning after the Closing Date
shall be allocated to the Buyer. The amount of such prorations shall be
settled and paid on the Closing Date.   ARTICLE VI   COVENANTS OF THE

conduct of any audit or other proceeding relating to Taxes involving the
Business.   (d) Neither party shall be required by Section 6.02(b) or (c)
to take any action that would unreasonably interfere with the conduct of
its business or unreasonably disrupt its normal operations (or, in the case
of the Buyer, the Business). Any non-public information received by the
Seller following the Closing Date shall be subject to the
Confidentiality Agreement.   SECTION 6.03. Certain Filings. The Seller and
the Buyer shall cooperate with one another (a) in determining whether any
action by, or in respect of, or filing with, any Governmental Entity is
required, or any actions, consents, approvals or waivers are required to be
obtained from parties to any material Contracts, in connection with the
consummation of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement and (b) in
taking such actions or making any such filings, furnishing information
required in connection therewith and seeking timely to obtain any such

reasonable request of the Buyer, the Seller shall use its reasonable efforts
to introduce the Buyer to the content providers of the Business for the
sole purposes of the Buyer\'s disclosing the existence of the
transactions contemplated hereby in order to obtain a Required Consent or to
seek to renegotiate the terms and conditions of a content vendor agreement
which is an Assumed Contract. A representative of the Seller shall
always participate in or approve in writing any meetings, discussions
or conversations involving the Buyer and any of the Seller\'s customers
or content providers. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary
contained herein or in any other instruments or documents and without the
prior written consent of the Seller, between the date hereof and the
Closing Date, the Buyer shall not, directly or indirectly, and the Buyer
shall cause its officers, directors, employees, accountants,
counsel, consultants, advisors and agents not to, directly or indirectly,
disclose or otherwise use any of the information not publicly available
concerning the transactions contemplated hereby or the Purchased Assets to
any current customer or vendor of the Seller or solicit or otherwise contact
any of Seller\'s or its Subsidiaries\' customers or vendors except in the
ordinary course of business of the Buyer, consistent with past practice and
not in violation of any agreements binding on the Buyer or any of its
Subsidiaries or any of their respective officers, directors, employees,
accountants, counsel, consultants, advisors and agents.   SECTION 6.07.
[Intentionally Omitted]   SECTION 6.08. Allocation of Purchase Price. The
Purchase Price shall be allocated within ninety (90) days of the Closing
among the Purchased Assets in accordance with an allocation schedule to be
prepared by the Buyer and the Seller acting jointly. Such allocation schedule
shall be prepared in accordance with Section 1060 of the Code. In connection
with the determination of such schedule, the parties shall cooperate with
each other and provide such information as any of them shall reasonably
request. The parties shall (i) each report the Federal, state, local and
other Tax consequences of the purchase and sale of contemplated hereby
(including the filing of Internal Revenue Service Form 8594) in a manner
consistent with such allocation schedule and (ii) take no position in any Tax
filing, return, proceeding, audit or otherwise which is inconsistent with
such allocation. In the event that the allocation of the Purchase Price
is disputed by any taxing authority, the party receiving notice of the
dispute shall promptly notify the other parties hereto. Notwithstanding the
above, no allocation of the Purchase Price shall be made, and no
allocation schedule shall be prepared, if the purchase of the Purchased
Assets by the Buyer from the Seller pursuant to this Agreement is treated as
a "reorganization" pursuant to Section 368(a)(1)(C) of the Code
(a "Reorganization"), or is otherwise treated as a transaction pursuant
to which the tax basis of the Purchased Assets to the Buyer is determined
by reference to the tax basis of such assets to the Seller. Buyer and
Seller further agree that, unless the Purchase Price paid pursuant to Section
2.06 consists solely of Securities, the Seller shall determine whether
the purchase of the Purchased Assets constitutes a Reorganization,
which determination shall be binding upon Buyer unless there is no
reasonable basis for such determination or there is a final determination to
the contrary by the Internal Revenue Service.   SECTION 6.09. WorldCom Data
Center. To the extent the WorldCom data center lease is not terminated within
one hundred eighty (180) days of the Closing Date, the Buyer shall return to
the Seller the amount in cash corresponding to the lease buyout amount
included in Net Working Liabilities with respect to the WorldCom Data Center
lease as of the Closing Date within ten (10) Business Days thereafter.  
SECTION 6.10. Filing of Reports Under the Exchange Act. If and for so long as
the Seller or its stockholders hold Securities, the Buyer shall (i) comply
with the reporting requirements of the Securities Exchange Act, and (ii)
comply with all other public information reporting requirements of the SEC
that are a condition to the availability of an exemption from the Securities
Act (under Rule 144 or 144A thereof, as amended from time to time, or
successor rules thereto or otherwise) for the sale of the Securities by the
Seller or its stockholders. The Buyer shall cooperate with the Seller in
supplying such information as may be necessary for the Seller to complete and
file any information reporting forms presently or hereafter required by the
SEC as a condition to the availability of an exemption from the Securities
Act (under Rule 144 or 144A thereunder or otherwise) for the sale of the
Securities by the Seller or its stockholders.   SECTION 6.11. Notification.
Between the date hereof and the Closing Date, the Seller will promptly notify
the Buyer in writing if the Seller becomes aware of any fact or condition
that causes or constitutes a breach of any of the Seller\'s representations
or warranties as of the date hereof, or if the Seller becomes aware of the
occurrence after the date hereof of any fact or condition that would (except
as expressly contemplated herein) cause or constitute a breach of any
such representation or warranty had such representation or warranty been made
as of the time of occurrence or discovery of such fact or condition.
Should any such fact or condition require any change in the Seller\'s
schedules to the representations and warranties contained in this Agreement
if the Seller\'s schedules were dated the date of the occurrence or discovery
of any such fact or condition, the Seller will promptly deliver to the Buyer
a supplement to the Seller\'s schedules to the representations and
warranties contained in this Agreement (the "Supplemental Schedules")
specifying such change. During the same period, the Seller will promptly
notify the Buyer of the occurrence of any breach of any covenant of the
Seller in this Agreement or of the occurrence of any event that may make the
satisfaction of the conditions in Section 8.02 impossible or unlikely.   
ARTICLE VII   EMPLOYEE MATTERS   SECTION 7.01. Employees and Offers of
Employment.   (a) The Buyer shall have the right, but not the obligation,
to offer employment to any employees of the Seller, in the Buyer\'s
sole discretion, that perform services in connection with the Business.
Schedule 7.01(a) sets forth the names of the employees to whom the Buyer may
offer employment (each a "Potentially Transferred Employee"). Except as
otherwise provided herein, any such offers shall be at such salary or wage
and benefit levels and on such other terms and conditions as the Buyer shall
in its sole discretion deem appropriate. The Buyer shall have the right,
but not the obligation, to offer to the Potentially Transferred
Employees bonuses or any other consideration (at such time as may be agreed
between the Buyer and such employees) for their assistance to the Buyer
in connection with effecting the transition of the Business to the Buyer.
The employees who accept and commence employment with the Buyer on or prior
to the Closing Date are heretofore and hereinafter collectively referred to
as the "Transferred Employees." The Buyer may, in compliance with
applicable Law, interview and conduct background investigations with respect
to any Potentially Transferred Employee, and the Seller will not take any
action that would impede, hinder, interfere or otherwise compete with the
Buyer\'s effort to hire any Transferred Employees. Upon Potentially
Transferred Employees becoming Transferred Employees, the Seller shall
provide the personnel records of such Transferred Employees to the Buyer;
provided, however, that the Seller shall have no obligation to provide such
records in the event that the provision of such records is prohibited by
applicable Law.   (b) To the extent that any Transferred Employee is
eligible to participate in any employee benefit plan of the Buyer or any of
its Affiliates (i) such employees shall receive full credit for purposes
of determining future vacation entitlement and (ii) such employees
shall participate in the Buyer employee benefit plans on terms that are no
less favorable than offered to similarly situated employees of the
Buyer. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary herein, in no event shall
any period during which a Transferred Employee was on a sabbatical be
counted for purposes of calculating prior service credit under any Buyer
plan, policy, program or other arrangement.   (c) The Seller shall pay, or
otherwise be responsible for, and shall indemnify the Buyer against all
amounts due and benefits accrued or earned on or before the Closing Date
under any Plan to or by any Transferred Employee on or before the Closing
Date. The Buyer shall pay, or otherwise be responsible for, and shall
indemnify the Seller against all amounts due and benefits accrued or earned
after the Closing Date by any Transferred Employee under any employee benefit
plan, policy, program or other arrangement maintained by the Buyer or any of
its Affiliates, including, but not limited to, any severance obligations to
the Transferred Employees by reason of their termination of employment with
the Buyer. If a current employee of the Seller, other than those employees
set forth on Schedule 7.01(c) or a Transferred Employee for which no
reimbursement shall be due, becomes a full-time employee of the Buyer within
six months of the date hereof or becomes a consultant of the Buyer who works
a minimum of 200 hours for the Buyer during the one hundred eighty (180) days
immediately following the Closing Date, the Buyer shall promptly reimburse
the Seller fifty percent (50%) of the severance payment actually paid by the
Seller to such employee, if any, in connection with such employee\'s
termination of employment with the Seller; provided, however, that the Seller
may elect to waive such right to reimbursement.   (d) Neither the Seller
nor any of its Affiliates shall modify, amend or otherwise alter any non-
competition or other similar restrictions with any Potentially Transferred
Employee (or any former employee of the Seller that would be a Potentially
Transferred Employee if in the employ of the Seller on the date hereof)
without the prior written consent of the Buyer, and the Seller shall not
waive, and the Seller shall use its reasonable efforts to enforce, at the
Buyer\'s expense (provided that, any such expense has been previously
approved by the Buyer in writing), such non-competition or other restrictions
in connection with any violation thereof. The Seller hereby agrees to forever
release (and to cause any Affiliate to release) any Potentially Transferred
Employee who becomes a Transferred Employee or any employee of the Seller (or
any Affiliate) who becomes a consultant to the Buyer from the provisions of
any non-competition, non-disclosure or other similar restrictions relating
to the Purchased Assets to the extent necessary to allow (x) such
Potentially Transferred Employee to accept such offer of employment with the
Buyer or (y) such employee to accept a consulting engagement with the
Buyer.   SECTION 7.02. No Third Party Beneficiaries. No provision of
this Agreement, including, without limitation, this Article VII shall create
any third party beneficiary or other rights in any employee or former
employee (including any beneficiary or dependent thereof) of the Seller or
any of its Subsidiaries (whether or not a Potentially Transferred Employee)
with respect to employment (or continued employment) or consulting
arrangements with the Buyer, and no provision of this Agreement, including,
without limitation, this Article VII shall create any such rights in any
such Persons with respect to any benefits that may be provided, directly
or indirectly, under any plan or arrangement that may be established by
the Buyer. No provision of this Agreement shall constitute a limitation
on rights to amend, modify or terminate after the Closing Date any such
plans or arrangements of the Buyer.    ARTICLE VIII   CONDITIONS TO

all assets, liabilities and operating expenses that are part of Net
Working Liabilities, subject to immaterial adjustments (and for the absence
of footnotes and year-end audit adjustments). The Buyer shall have received
a certificate signed by the Seller\'s Chief Executive Officer and
Chief Financial Officer (the "Financial Certificate"). The Financial
Certificate shall be based on the Closing Date Financial Statements and shall
be prepared in accordance with GAAP accrual accounting for all
assets, liabilities and operating expenses that are part of Net

accordance with Section 2.06(a), elects to receive the Purchase Price
entirely in the form of Cash Consideration, then this Closing condition shall
be deemed to be satisfied.   (c) The Purchase Price, net of any Purchase

of the parties hereto contained in this Agreement or in any certificate
or other writing delivered pursuant hereto or in connection herewith
shall survive the Closing until one (1) year after the Closing
Date. Notwithstanding the preceding sentence, any covenant,
agreement, representation or warranty in respect of which indemnity may be
sought under Section 9.02 or 9.03 shall survive the time at which it
would otherwise terminate pursuant to the preceding sentence, if notice of
the inaccuracy or breach thereof giving rise to such right to indemnity
shall have been given to the party against whom such indemnity may be
sought prior to such time. All covenants made by any party shall survive
the Closing Date pursuant to their terms.   SECTION 9.02.
Indemnification.   (a) The Seller hereby indemnifies the Buyer and
its Affiliates and their respective officers, directors, employees and
agents (a "Buyer Party") against, and agree to hold each of them harmless
from, any and all damages, claims, debts, actions, assessments,
judgments, losses, liabilities, fines, fees, penalties and expense
(including, without limitation, reasonable expenses of investigation and
reasonable attorneys\' fees and expenses in connection with any action, suit
or proceeding) (collectively, "Losses") incurred or suffered by a Buyer
Party, whether in an action between a Buyer Party and the Seller or a Buyer
Party and a third party, in connection with, resulting from or arising out
of:   (i) any misrepresentation, inaccuracy or breach of  representation
and warranty made by the Seller pursuant to this  Agreement without giving
effect to any Supplemental Schedule, other  than any such breach that is
disclosed in a Supplemental Schedule;   (ii) any breach of covenant or
agreement to be performed by  the Seller pursuant to this Agreement;  
(iii) the failure of the Seller to assume full responsibility  for any
Excluded Liability or any obligation or liability of the  Business relating
to the Excluded Assets and failure to pay and  discharge when due any
Excluded Liability, or any claim or cause of  action by any party against
such indemnities with respect to the  Excluded Liability;   (iv) any
obligations or liabilities of any nature relating to  the employment by the
Seller or termination by the Seller of employees  of the Seller (other than
the Transferred Employees); or   (v) claims of actual or alleged
infringement or other  violation arising out of the Seller\'s (or any
Subsidiary\'s) use of the  trademark or trade name "NEWSALERT" prior to the
Closing.   (b) the Buyer hereby indemnifies the Seller and its Affiliates
and their respective officers, directors, employees and agents (a "Seller
Party") against, and agrees to hold each of them harmless from, any and all
Losses incurred or suffered by a Seller Party, whether in an action between a
Seller Party and the Buyer or a Seller Party and a third party, in connection
with, resulting from or arising out of:   (i) any misrepresentation,
inaccuracy or breach of  representation and warranty made by the Buyer or
Acquisition Sub  pursuant to this Agreement;   (ii) any breach of a
covenant or agreement to be performed by  the Buyer or Acquisition Sub
pursuant to this Agreement;   (iii) the failure of Acquisition Sub to assume
full  responsibility for any Assumed Liability or any obligation or 
liability of Acquisition Sub relating to the Purchased Assets and  failure to
pay and discharge when due any Assumed Liability, or any  claim or cause of
action by any party against such indemnities with  respect to the Assumed
Liability;   (iv) any obligations or liabilities of any nature relating to 
the employment by the Buyer or termination by the Buyer of Transferred 
Employees or other employees of the Buyer; or   (v) claims of actual or
alleged infringement or other  violation arising out of the Buyer\'s or
Acquisition Sub\'s use of the  trademark or trade name "NEWSALERT" from and
after the Closing.   (c) Notwithstanding anything contained in Section 9.02
to the contrary, there shall be no liability for indemnification under
this Section 9.02, (i) unless the aggregate amount of Losses exceeds
$50,000 (the "Indemnity Deductible") at which time the Indemnifying Person
shall be liable for the amount of the Losses in excess of the Indemnity
Deductible, (ii) unless the Indemnified Person delivers to the Indemnifying
Party written notice, setting forth in reasonable detail the identity, nature
and amount of Losses related to such claim or claims, (iii) to the extent
that an Indemnified Party has suffered, incurred, sustained or become
subject to, Losses by reason of all such claims in excess of the
Escrowed Consideration and the Indemnifying Parties, in the aggregate, shall
not be obligated to pay anything other than or more than the
Escrowed Consideration, in the aggregate for all claims under Section 9.02,
and (iv) the Seller shall not be obligated to pay anything other than or more
than the Escrowed Consideration, it being understood that the
Escrowed Consideration shall, subject to Section 9.04, constitute the only
recourse against the Seller under this Article IX.   (d) Notwithstanding
anything contained in Section 9.02 to the contrary, the Indemnity Deductible
shall not apply in the event that liability of an Indemnifying Person arises
out of or in connection with a Purchase Price Adjustment or a breach of the
representations or warranties in Sections 3.01, 3.02, 3.03, 3.04, or 3.10. An
Indemnifying Person shall have no liability to indemnify the Indemnified
Person for any Losses resolved by the parties as a Purchase Price
Adjustment.   SECTION 9.03. Procedures; No Waiver.   (a) All claims for
indemnification by an Indemnified Person pursuant to this Article IX shall be
made in accordance with the provisions of this Section 9.03.   (b) A party
entitled to indemnification under this Article IX (the "Indemnified Person")
shall give prompt written notification to the Person obligated to provide
such indemnification (the "Indemnifying Person") of the commencement of any
action, suit or proceeding relating to a claim between the parties or a third
party claim for which indemnification pursuant to this Article IX may be
sought; provided, however, that no delay on the part of the Indemnified
Person in notifying the Indemnifying Person shall relieve the Indemnifying
Person from any liability or obligation under this Article IX except to the
extent of any damage or liability caused solely by or arising solely out of
such delay. With respect to any claim by a third party, within 20 days after
delivery of such notification, the Indemnifying Person may, upon written
notice thereof to the Indemnified Person, assume control of the defense of
such action, suit or proceeding with counsel reasonably satisfactory to
the Indemnified Person; provided that (i) the Indemnifying Person
acknowledges in writing to the Indemnified Person that the Indemnifying
Person shall indemnify the Indemnified Person with respect to all elements of
such action, suit or proceeding and any damages, fines, costs or
other liabilities that may be assessed against the Indemnified Person
in connection with such action, suit or proceeding, and (ii) the third
party seeks monetary damages only. If the Indemnifying Person does not so
assume control of such defense, the Indemnified Person shall control such
defense. The party not controlling such defense may participate therein at
its own expense; provided that if the Indemnifying Person assumes control of
such defense and the Indemnified Person is advised by counsel in writing
that the Indemnifying Person and the Indemnified Person may have
conflicting interests or different defenses available with respect to such
action, suit or proceeding, the reasonable fees and expenses of a single
counsel per applicable jurisdiction to the Indemnified Person shall be
considered "Losses" for purposes of this Agreement and shall be paid by
the Indemnifying Party. The party controlling such defense shall keep the
other party advised of the status of such action, suit or proceeding and
the defense thereof and shall consider in good faith recommendations made
by the other party with respect thereto. An Indemnified Person shall not
agree to any settlement of such action, suit or proceeding without the
prior written consent of the Indemnifying Person, which shall not be
unreasonably withheld or delayed. The Indemnifying Person shall not agree to
any settlement or the entry of a judgment in any action, suit or
proceeding without the prior written consent of the Indemnified Person, which
shall not be unreasonably withheld (it being understood that it is reasonable
to withhold such consent if, among other things, the settlement or the
entry of a judgment (A) lacks a complete release of the Indemnified Person
for all liability with respect thereto or (B) imposes any liability
or obligation on the Indemnified Person).   SECTION 9.04. Sole Remedy.
Except for fraud, and subject to any party\'s right for equitable relief, the
indemnification provisions of this Article IX and the provisions of the
Escrow Agreement shall constitute the sole and exclusive remedy of the
parties hereto for any inaccuracy, untruth, incompleteness or other breach of
or failure to perform any covenant made in this Agreement, and the parties
each waive any other remedy, which they or any other Person entitled to
indemnification hereunder may have at Law with respect thereto.   SECTION
9.05. Adjustments to Indemnification Payments. Any payment made by either the
Seller to Buyer Parties, on the one hand, or by the Buyer to Seller Parties,
on the other hand, pursuant to this Article IX in respect of any claim shall
be reduced by any insurance proceeds realized by and paid to the Indemnified
Person in respect of such claim net of any cost incurred due to such
insurance recoveries, including, without limitation, retrospective premium
adjustments and experience-based premium adjustments. The Indemnified Person
shall use its reasonable efforts to make insurance claims relating to any
claim for which it is seeking indemnification pursuant to this Article IX;
provided that the Indemnified Person shall not be obligated to make such an
insurance claim if the Indemnified Person in its reasonable judgment believes
that the cost of pursuing such an insurance claim together with any
corresponding increase in insurance premiums or other chargebacks to the
Indemnified Person would exceed the value of the claim for which the
Indemnified Person is seeking indemnification.   ARTICLE X  
TERMINATION   SECTION 10.01. Grounds for Termination. This Agreement may
be terminated at any time prior to the Closing:   (i) by mutual written
agreement of the parties; or   (ii) by the Seller, on the one hand, or by
the Buyer, on the  other hand, if the Closing shall not have occurred within
thirty  (30) days following the date hereof (the "Expiration Date"); 
provided, however, that if the only condition to Closing not  satisfied is
the condition set forth in Section 8.02(d), such  Expiration Date shall
automatically be extended, without any  action required by any of the parties
hereto, by an additional  seven (7) days (the "Extension Period"); provided,
further, that  if, at the end of such Extension Period, the condition to
Closing  set forth in Section 8.02(d) is not satisfied, and remains the 
only condition to Closing not satisfied, such Extension Period  shall
automatically be extended, without any action required by  any of the parties
hereto, by an additional seven (7) days (the  "Second Extension Period");
provided, further, that the right to  terminate this Agreement under this
Section 10.01(ii) shall not be  available to a party whose material
misrepresentation, material  breach of warranty or failure to fulfill any
material obligation  under this Agreement has been the cause of, or resulted
in, the  failure of the Closing to occur on or before such date; or   (iii)
by the Seller, on the one hand, or by the Buyer and the  Acquisition Sub, on
the other hand, if there is or has been a  material breach, failure to
fulfill or default on the part of the  other party of any of the
representations and warranties contained  herein or in the due and timely
performance and satisfaction of  any of the covenants, agreements or
conditions contained herein,  and the curing of such default shall not have
been made before the  Expiration Date; or   (iv) by the Seller, on the one
hand, or by the Buyer, on the  other hand, if there shall be a final
nonappealable order of a  Federal or state court in effect preventing the
consummation of  the transactions contemplated by this Agreement; or there
shall be  any action taken, or any statute, rule, regulation or order 
enacted, promulgated or issued or deemed applicable to the  transactions by
any government body, agency, official or authority  which would make the
consummation of the transactions illegal.   SECTION 10.02. Effect of
Termination. If this Agreement is terminated as permitted by Section 10.01,
except as set forth below, such termination shall be without liability of
either party (or any shareholder, director, officer, employee, agent,
consultant or representative of such party) to the other party to this
Agreement; provided that if such termination shall result from the fraud,
willful misconduct or gross negligence of either party in the failure to
satisfy a condition to the performance of the obligations of the other party
or to perform a covenant of this Agreement or from any act of fraud, willful
misconduct or gross negligence in connection with a breach by either party to
this Agreement, such party shall, notwithstanding the provisions of Section
11.03, be fully liable for any and all Losses incurred or suffered by the
other party as a result of such failure or breach. The provisions of this
Section 10.02, Section 6.04 and Section 11.03 shall survive any termination
hereof pursuant to Section 10.01.    ARTICLE XI   MISCELLANEOUS

inducement, promise, understanding, condition or warranty not set forth
herein or therein has been made or relied upon by either party hereto. None

is intended to confer upon any Person other than the parties hereto any
rights or remedies hereunder. If any term or other provision of this

Law or public policy, all other terms and provisions of this Agreement shall
nevertheless remain in full force and effect so long as the economic or legal
substance of the purchase and sale of the Purchased Assets is not affected in
any manner materially adverse to any party. Upon such determination that any
term or other provision is invalid, illegal or incapable of being enforced,
the parties hereto shall negotiate in good faith to modify this Agreement so
as to effect the original intent of the parties as closely as possible in a
mutually acceptable manner to the fullest extent permitted by applicable Law
in order that the purchase and sale of the Purchased Assets may be
consummated as originally contemplated to the fullest extent possible. The
foregoing is in addition to and not in place of the severability provisions

intent or interpretation arises, this Agreement shall be construed as if
drafted jointly by the parties, and no presumption or burden of proof shall
arise favoring or disfavoring any party by virtue of the authorship of
any provisions of this Agreement.   SECTION 11.11. Incorporation of
Exhibits and Schedules. The Exhibits and Schedules referred to in this
Agreement are incorporated herein and made a part hereof.   SECTION 11.12.
Specific Performance. In addition to any other remedies that any party hereto
may have at Law or in equity, the Buyer and the Seller hereby acknowledge
that the transactions contemplated by this Agreement are unique, and that the
harm to a party (the "Non-Breaching Party") resulting from any breach by
another party (the "Breaching Party") of its obligations under this Agreement
cannot be adequately compensated by damages. Accordingly, the Non-Breaching
Party shall have the right to have all obligations, undertakings, agreements,
covenants and other provisions of this Agreement specifically performed by
the Breaching Party, and the Non-Breaching Party shall have the right to
obtain an order or decree of such specific performance in any of the courts
set forth in Section 11.06.    [Remainder of Page Intentionally Left
