</FONT><U>Enforcement of the Agreement; Consent to Jurisdiction</U>. The parties agree that irreparable damage would occur in
the event that any of the provisions of this Agreement were not performed in accordance with their specific terms or were otherwise
breached or threatened to be breached and that an award of money damages would be inadequate in such event. It is accordingly
agreed that the parties shall be entitled to equitable relief, without proof of actual damages, including an injunction or injunctions
to prevent breaches of this Agreement and to enforce specifically the terms and provisions of this Agreement, this being in addition
to any other remedy to which they are entitled at Law or in equity. The parties further agree to waive any requirement for the
securing or posting of any bond in connection with the obtaining of any such injunctive or other equitable relief. In addition,
each of Parent, Merger Sub and the Company irrevocably (a) consents to submit itself to the personal jurisdiction of the Court
of Chancery of the State of Delaware (or, if the Delaware Court of Chancery declines to accept jurisdiction over a particular
matter, any federal court located in the State of Delaware) with respect to any dispute arising out of, relating to, or in connection
with this Agreement or the Transactions contemplated by this Agreement, (b) agrees that it will not attempt to deny or defeat
such personal jurisdiction by motion or other request for leave from any such court and (c) agrees that it will not bring any
Action arising out of, relating to or in connection with this Agreement or the Transactions in any court other than the Court
of Chancery of the State of Delaware (or, if the Delaware Court of Chancery declines to accept jurisdiction over a particular
matter, any federal court located in the State of Delaware). The parties irrevocably and unconditionally waive any objection to

or otherwise in any such court that (i) <FONT STYLE="color: black">such party is not personally subject to the jurisdiction of
