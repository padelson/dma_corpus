AGREEMENT AND PLAN OF MERGER

  



  

This AGREEMENT AND PLAN OF MERGER (this " _Agreement_ "), dated as of October
22, 2012, is by and among Toyota Industries Corporation, a corporation formed
under the laws of Japan (" _Parent_ "), Industrial Components and Attachments
II, Inc., a corporation formed under the laws of the State of Delaware and an
indirect wholly owned subsidiary of Parent (" _Merger Sub_ "), and Cascade
Corporation, a corporation formed under the laws of the State of Oregon (the "
_Company_ ").

  



  

RECITALS

  



  

WHEREAS, Parent desires to acquire the Company on the terms and conditions
set forth in this Agreement;

  



  

WHEREAS, Parent shall cause Merger Sub to commence a cash tender offer (as it
may be amended from time to time, the " _Offer_ ") in accordance with the
terms hereof to purchase all of the outstanding shares of common stock, par
value $0.50 per share, of the Company (the " _Company Common Stock_ ") for
$65.00 per share (such amount, or any higher amount per share paid pursuant to
the Offer, being the " _Offer Price_ "), net to the seller in cash, without
interest;

  



  

WHEREAS, following completion of the Offer, Merger Sub will merge with and
into the Company (the " _Merger_ "), with the Company surviving the
Merger, and each share of Company Common Stock that is not tendered and
accepted pursuant to the Offer (other than such shares owned by Merger Sub,
Parent or any Subsidiary of Parent or the Company immediately prior to the
Effective Time, and other than Dissenting Shares, if any) will be converted
into the right to receive the Merger Consideration (as defined below), in each
case upon the terms and subject to the conditions of this Agreement;

  



  

WHEREAS, the Board of Directors of the Company has unanimously determined
that this Agreement, including the Offer, the Merger and the other
transactions contemplated hereby (collectively, the " _Transactions_ "), is
in the best interests of the Company and its shareholders and has adopted
this Agreement and determined to recommend that its shareholders accept the
Offer and tender their shares pursuant to the Offer and, if required by
applicable Law, vote in favor of the Merger; and

  



  

WHEREAS, concurrently with the execution and delivery of this Agreement, as a
condition and inducement to the willingness of Parent and Merger Sub to enter
into this Agreement, certain holders of shares of Company Common Stock are
executing a Tender and Voting Agreement in favor of Parent, substantially in
the form attached hereto as _Exhibit A_ (the " _Tender Agreement_ ").

  



  

NOW, THEREFORE, in consideration of the foregoing and the mutual warranties,
covenants and agreements contained in this Agreement, and for other good and
valuable consideration, the receipt and sufficiency of which is hereby
acknowledged, the parties, intending to be legally bound, agree as follows:

  



   


--- 

 


--- 

    



  

Article I _ 
 The Offer_

  



  

Section 1.1  _The Offer_.

  



  

(a) _Provided_ , that this Agreement shall not have been terminated
in accordance with _Article VIII_, as promptly as reasonably
practicable after the date of this Agreement but in no event later than the
tenth (10th) Business Day after the date hereof (or such later date as the
parties may agree in writing), Merger Sub shall, and Parent shall cause Merger
Sub to (and the Company shall cooperate with Parent and Merger Sub to)
commence (within the meaning of Rule 14d-2 under the Securities Exchange Act
of 1934, as amended, and the rules and regulations promulgated thereunder
(the " _Exchange Act_ ")) the Offer.

  



  

(b) Subject to the terms and conditions of this Agreement, including
the prior satisfaction or waiver of the conditions set forth in _Annex
I_ (the " _Offer Conditions_ "), Merger Sub shall (and Parent shall cause

payment, the " _Acceptance Time_ ") and promptly following the acceptance of
the shares of Company Common Stock for payment pursuant to the Offer, pay
(subject to any withholding of Tax pursuant to _Section 2.2(g)_) the Offer
Price net to the seller in cash, without interest, for each share of Company
Common Stock validly tendered and not properly withdrawn pursuant to the
Offer. The obligation of Merger Sub to (and of Parent to cause Merger Sub to)
accept for payment, and pay the Offer Price net to the seller in cash,
without interest, for each share of Company Common Stock validly tendered and
not properly withdrawn pursuant to the Offer shall be subject only to the
satisfaction, or waiver by Parent or Merger Sub if permitted hereunder, of
each of the Offer Conditions.

  



  

(c) The Offer shall be made by means of an offer to purchase (the "
_Offer to Purchase_ ") that contains the terms and conditions of the Offer as
set forth in this Agreement, including the Minimum Tender Condition (as
defined in _Annex I_). Parent and Merger Sub expressly reserve the right
(but shall not be obligated), at any time and from time to time in their sole
discretion, to waive any of the Offer Conditions, to increase the Offer Price
or to modify or amend any other terms and conditions of the Offer; 
_provided_ , that without the written consent of the Company, Parent and
Merger Sub shall not (A) decrease the Offer Price, (B) change the form of
consideration payable in the Offer, (C) decrease the number of shares of
Company Common Stock sought to be purchased in the Offer, (D) impose
additional conditions on the consummation of the Offer, (E) amend or modify
any of the Offer Conditions in a manner that adversely affects any holder of
shares of Company Common Stock, (F) change or waive the Minimum
Tender Condition (or HSR Approval component of the Governmental Approval
Condition), (G) extend or otherwise change the Expiration Date in a manner
other than as required or permitted by _Section 1.1(e)_ of this Agreement or
(H) otherwise amend or modify the Offer in a manner that adversely affects,
any holder of shares of Company Common Stock. The failure by Parent or Merger
Sub at any time

 to exercise any of the foregoing rights shall not be deemed a waiver of any
such right, and each right shall be deemed an ongoing right that may be
asserted at any time and from time to time.

  



  

(d) Unless extended pursuant to and in accordance with the terms of
this Agreement, the Offer shall expire at midnight, New York time, on the
date that is twenty (20) Business Days (determined for this purpose in
accordance with Rule 14d-1(g)(3) under the Exchange Act) following the
commencement of the Offer (the " _Initial Expiration Date_ ") or, in the event
the Initial Expiration Date has been extended pursuant to and in accordance
with this Agreement, the date and time to which the Offer has been so
extended (the Initial Expiration Date, or such later date and time to which
the Offer has been extended pursuant to and in accordance with this
Agreement, the " _Expiration Date_ ").

  



  

(e) The Offer shall be extended from time to time as follows:

  



  

(i) If at any then scheduled Expiration Date, any of the Offer
Conditions set forth in clauses (a), (b) or (c)(i) of _Annex I_ hereto shall
not have been satisfied or waived by Parent or Merger Sub if permitted
hereunder, then Merger Sub shall (and Parent shall cause Merger Sub to), if
so requested by the Company in a written notice delivered to Parent on or
prior to the scheduled Expiration Date, extend the Offer for one or more
successive periods of up to ten (10) Business Days each, in order to permit
the satisfaction of such Offer Conditions (subject to the right of Parent and
Merger Sub to waive any Offer Condition (other than the Minimum Tender
Condition or the requirement for HSR Approval that is a component of the
Governmental Approval Condition) in accordance with this Agreement);
_provided_ , that such extension of the Offer does not extend past the earlier
of (A) the termination of this Agreement pursuant to _Article VIII_ and (B)
January 31, 2013 (which date may be extended at the discretion of either the
Company or Parent to not later than March 31, 2013, in the event the
Governmental Approval Condition shall not have been satisfied as of such
date) (the " _Outside Date_ ");

  



  

(ii) Merger Sub may, at its sole discretion, extend the Offer for one
or more successive periods of up to ten (10) Business Days each, the length
of each such period to be determined by Parent at its sole discretion, to
permit any Offer Conditions to be satisfied; _provided_ , that such extension
of the Offer shall not extend past the earlier of (A) the termination of this
Agreement pursuant to _Article VIII_ and (B) the Outside Date; and

  



  

(iii) Merger Sub shall (and Parent shall cause Merger Sub to) extend
the Offer for any period or periods required by applicable Law, by
interpretation or position of the Securities and Exchange Commission (the "
_SEC_ ") or its staff or by the New York Stock Exchange (" _NYSE_ ") that is
applicable to the Offer.

  



   

\- 3 -

Merger Sub shall not terminate the Offer prior to any scheduled Expiration
Date (including any rescheduled Expiration Date) without the prior
written consent of the Company except in the event that this Agreement is
terminated pursuant to _Article VIII_. Nothing in this  _Section 1.1_ shall
affect any of the termination rights set forth in _Article VIII_.

  



  

(f) If fewer than ninety percent (90%) of the number of outstanding
shares of Company Common Stock are accepted for payment pursuant to the
Offer, Parent and Merger Sub may, and at the request of the Company shall, and
upon any such request by the Company Parent shall cause the Merger Sub to,
provide for one "subsequent offering period" (and one or more extensions
thereof) in accordance with Rule 14d-11 under the Exchange Act. Subject to
the terms and conditions of this Agreement and the Offer, Merger Sub
shall (and Parent shall cause Merger Sub to) promptly after any Company
Common Stock is validly tendered during a "subsequent offering period" (or
any extension thereof) accept for payment, and pay (subject to any withholding
of Tax pursuant to _Section 2.2(g)_) the Offer Price net to the seller in
cash, without interest, for, each share of Company Common Stock that is
validly tendered during such "subsequent offering period" or any extension
thereof promptly after any such share of Company Common Stock is
tendered during any such period. The Offer Documents will provide for the
possibility of a "subsequent offering period" in a manner consistent with the
terms of this _Section 1.1(f)_.

  



  

(g) In the event that this Agreement is terminated pursuant to
_Article VIII_ prior to the Acceptance Time, Merger Sub shall (and Parent
shall cause Merger Sub to) (i) within one (1) Business Day of such
termination, terminate the Offer, (ii) not acquire any shares of Company
Common Stock pursuant to the Offer and (iii) cause any depository acting on
behalf of Merger Sub to return, in accordance with applicable Law, all
tendered shares of Company Common Stock to the registered holders thereof.

  



  

(h) On the date of the commencement of the Offer, Parent and Merger
Sub shall prepare and file with the SEC a Tender Offer Statement in
accordance with Rule 14d-3 and Regulation M-A under the Exchange Act on
Schedule TO with respect to the Offer (together with all amendments and
supplements thereto and including exhibits thereto, the " _Schedule TO_")
that will contain or incorporate by reference the Offer to Purchase, the
summary advertisement and form of the related letter of transmittal (such
Schedule TO and the documents included therein pursuant to which the Offer
will be made, together with any amendments and supplements thereto and
including exhibits thereto, the " _Offer Documents_ "). Parent and Merger Sub
shall as promptly as practicable cause the Offer Documents to be disseminated
to holders of the shares of Company Common Stock in accordance with and to
the extent required by Rule 14d-4 under the Exchange Act. Parent and Merger
Sub agree that they shall cause the Offer Documents filed with the SEC by
either Parent or Merger Sub to comply in all material respects with the
Exchange Act and other applicable Laws. The Company shall promptly furnish or
otherwise make available to Parent, Merger Sub and Parent\'s counsel all
information concerning the Company, the Company\'s Subsidiaries and the

   



   

\- 4 - 
--- 

 


--- 

    



  


 Company\'s shareholders that may be required in connection with any action
contemplated by this _Section 1.1(h)_, including such information required by
applicable Laws to be set forth in the Offer Documents. No filing of, or
amendment or supplement to, the Offer Documents will be made by Parent or
Merger Sub, without providing the Company and its counsel a reasonable
opportunity to review and comment thereon and giving due consideration to
such comments. If at any time prior to the Acceptance Time or during any
"subsequent offering period" (or extension thereof) any information relating
to the Company, Parent, Merger Sub, or any of their respective Affiliates,
directors or officers should be discovered by any of the parties hereto,
which should be set forth in an amendment or a supplement to the Offer
Documents so that such documents would not include any misstatement of a
material fact or omit to state any material fact necessary to make the
statements therein, in light of the circumstances under which they were made,
not misleading, the party that discovers such information shall promptly
notify the other parties hereto, and Parent and Merger Sub shall promptly file
with the SEC an appropriate amendment or supplement describing such
information and, to the extent required by Law, shall disseminate such
amendment or supplement to the shareholders of the Company. Parent and Merger
Sub shall notify the Company promptly of the receipt of any comments,
whether written or oral, from the SEC or the staff of the SEC and of any
request by the SEC or the staff of the SEC for amendments or supplements to
the Offer Documents or for additional information, and shall promptly supply
the Company with copies of all correspondence (including a description of any
oral communications) between Parent, Merger Sub or any of their respective
Representatives, on the one hand, and the SEC or the staff of the SEC, on the
other hand, with respect to the Offer Documents. Each of Parent and Merger
Sub shall respond promptly to any comments of the SEC or its staff with
respect to the Offer Documents.

  



  

(i) Parent shall provide or cause to be provided to Merger Sub on a
timely basis the funds necessary to pay for any shares of Company
Common Stock that Merger Sub becomes obligated to accept for payment, and pay
for, pursuant to the Offer.

  



  

Section 1.2  _Company Actions_.

  



  

(a) Subject to _Section 5.2(c)_, the Company approves and consents
to the Offer and to the inclusion in the Offer Documents of
the recommendation by the Company\'s Board of Directors that the shareholders
of the Company accept the Offer and tender their shares of Company Common
Stock to Merger Sub in the Offer and, to the extent required by applicable
Law, approve this Agreement and the Merger (the " _Company Recommendation_
").

  



  

(b) On the date of the commencement of the Offer, concurrently with
the filing of the Offer Documents, the Company shall prepare and file with
the SEC a Solicitation/Recommendation Statement on Schedule 14D-9 (together
with any exhibits, amendments or supplements thereto, the " _Schedule
14D-9_") that, subject to _Section 5.2(c)_, shall reflect the Company
Recommendation. The Company shall use its reasonable best efforts to cause
the Schedule 14D-9 to be mailed to its shareholders as

   



   

\- 5 - 
--- 

 


--- 

    



  


 promptly as practicable after the filing of the Offer Documents with the
SEC, and in any event within two (2) Business Days thereafter. Parent and
Merger Sub shall promptly furnish or otherwise make available to the Company
and its outside legal counsel all information concerning Parent and Merger
Sub required by applicable Laws to be set forth in the Schedule 14D-9 or
required for compliance by the Company with its obligations under this
_Section 1.2(b)_. The Company agrees that it shall cause the Schedule
14D-9 to comply in all material respects with the Exchange Act and other
applicable Laws. No filing of, or amendment or supplement to (including
responses to any comments from the SEC), the Schedule 14D-9 will be made by
the Company, without providing Parent and its counsel a reasonable
opportunity to review and comment thereon and giving due consideration to such
comments. If at any time prior to the Acceptance Time or during any
"subsequent offering period" (or extension thereof) any information relating
to the Company, Parent, Merger Sub, or any of their respective Affiliates,
directors or officers should be discovered by any of the parties hereto which

Bylaws, applicable Laws and the regulations of the NYSE, Merger Sub shall be
entitled to designate, elect or cause the Board of Directors of the Company

is equal to the product, rounded up to the next whole number, of (i) the
total number of directors on the Board of Directors of the Company (after
giving effect to any directors elected or designated pursuant to this

the Board of Directors of the Company to promptly (A) adopt resolutions (1)
increasing the size of the Board of Directors of the Company by such number
of directors as shall be necessary to give effect to the first sentence of

the third sentence of this _Section 1.3(a)_, (B) elect Merger Sub\'s
designees to fill such newly created directorships on the Board of Directors
of the Company and (C) take all such other actions necessary to elect or
designate to the Board of Directors of the Company the individuals designated

_Section 1.3(a)_, including, if necessary, by securing the resignations of
such number of its incumbent directors as is necessary or desirable to enable
Merger Sub\'s designees to be so elected or designated to the Board of
Directors of the Company. The Company shall, upon Merger Sub\'s request
following the Acceptance Time, also cause persons designated by Merger Sub to
constitute the same percentage (after giving effect to any directors elected

body) of each Subsidiary of the Company and (z) each committee (or similar
body) of each such board, in each case, to the extent permitted by applicable
Laws and applicable rules of the NYSE. From and after the Acceptance Time,

1.3(a)_, including mailing to shareholders of the Company (together with the
Schedule 14D-9) the information required by Section 14(f) and Rule 14f-1
under the Exchange Act as is necessary to enable Merger Sub\'s designees to be
elected or designated to the Board of Directors of the Company. Merger Sub
shall supply the Company with information with respect to Merger Sub\'s
designees and Parent\'s and Merger Sub\'s respective officers, directors and
Affiliates to the extent required by Section 14(f) and Rule 14f-1 under the
Exchange Act. The provisions of this _Section 1.3(a)_ are in addition to and
shall not limit any rights that any of Merger Sub, Parent or any of their
respective Affiliates may have as record holders or beneficial owners of
shares of the Company Common Stock under applicable Laws with respect to the
election of directors or otherwise.

  



  

(b) Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the contrary but
subject to _Section 8.4_, following the time directors designated by
Merger Sub are elected or appointed to the Board of Directors of the Company
in accordance with this _Section 1.3_ and prior to the Effective Time, the
affirmative vote of a majority of the directors then in office not so elected
or appointed by Merger Sub and who are not officers, directors or employees
of Parent, Merger Sub or any of their respective Affiliates (the "
_Continuing Directors_ ") shall be required to (i) amend or terminate this
Agreement on behalf of the Company, (ii) exercise or waive any of the
Company\'s rights or remedies hereunder, (iii) extend the time for performance
of Parent\'s or Merger Sub\'s obligations hereunder, (iv) make any

of the Company\'s shareholders (other than Parent or Merger Sub). For purposes
of considering any matter set forth in this  _Section 1.3(b)_ the Continuing
Directors will be permitted to meet without the presence of the other
directors. The Continuing Directors will have the authority to retain such
counsel (which may include current counsel to the Company) and other advisors
at the expense of the Company as determined by the Continuing Directors and
will have the authority to institute any action on behalf of the Company to
enforce performance of this Agreement or any of the Company\'s rights
hereunder (on the terms and subject to the conditions set forth in this
Agreement). The Company will indemnify and advance expenses to, and Parent
will cause the Company to indemnify and advance expenses to, the Continuing
Directors in connection with their service as directors of the Company
prior to the Effective Time to the fullest extent permitted by Applicable Law
and in accordance with the provisions of _Section 6.4_ and the Company
Articles and Company Bylaws. From and after the Acceptance Time, and prior to
the Effective Time, neither Parent nor Merger Sub shall take any action to
remove a Continuing Director.

(a) The Company hereby grants to Parent and Merger Sub an
irrevocable option (the " _Top-Up Option_ "), subject to the terms and
conditions hereof, to purchase from the Company that number of shares of
Company Common Stock (the " _Top-Up Shares_ ") equal to the lowest number of
shares of Company Common Stock that, when added to the number of shares of
Company Common Stock owned by Parent and its Subsidiaries (including Merger
Sub) at the time of exercise of the Top-Up Option, shall constitute one
share of Company Common Stock more than ninety percent (90%) of the number of
shares of Company Common Stock outstanding (after giving effect to the
issuance of the Top-Up Shares, and excluding from the calculation of the
number of shares of Company Common Stock then owned by Parent and Merger Sub,
but not from the calculation of then-outstanding shares of Company Common
Stock, Shares tendered pursuant to guaranteed delivery procedures that have
not yet been delivered in settlement or satisfaction of such guarantee),
at an exercise price per Top-Up Share equal to the Offer Price; _provided_ ,
that Merger Sub may, and at the request of the Company, Merger Sub shall (and
at the request of the Company, Parent shall cause Merger Sub to) exercise the
Top-Up Option, only if (i) the exercise of the Top-Up Option and the issuance
and delivery of the Top-Up Shares shall not be prohibited by any Law or
Restraint, (ii) the Top-Up Option is exercisable for not more than the number
of shares of Company Common Stock that are authorized but unissued (and not
reserved for issuance) at the time of exercise of the Top-Up Option, and (iii)
Merger Sub irrevocably commits upon exercise of the Top-Up Option to promptly
effect a short-form merger pursuant to _Section 1.5_ hereof following such
exercise and is permitted to do so under applicable Laws.

  



  

(b) The Top-Up Option shall only be exercisable once, in whole but
not in part, promptly after the acceptance for payment by Merger Sub of
shares of Company Common Stock pursuant to the Offer representing no less than
65% of the then outstanding number of shares of Company Common Stock;
_provided_ , that the Top-Up Option shall terminate upon the earlier of (i)
the termination of this Agreement and (ii) the Effective Time.

  



  

(c) To exercise the Top-Up Option, Parent or Merger Sub shall so
notify the Company in writing and shall set forth in such notice (i) the
number of shares of Company Common Stock owned by Parent and its Subsidiaries
(including Merger Sub) immediately preceding the purchase of the Top-Up
Shares, (ii) the manner in which it intends to pay the applicable purchase
price, (iii) the place and time for the closing of the purchase of the Top-Up
Shares (the " _Top-Up Closing_ ") and (iv) an irrevocable commitment by
Merger Sub to promptly effect a short-form merger pursuant to _Section 1.5_
hereof following the Top-Up Closing. The Company shall, as soon as
practicable following receipt of such notice, notify Parent and Merger Sub in
writing of the number of shares of Company Common Stock then outstanding and,
based on the information specified in the notice of Parent or Merger Sub, the
number of Top-Up Shares. At the Top-Up Closing, (A) Parent or Merger Sub shall
pay to the Company the aggregate price required to be paid for the Top-Up
Shares, at the election of Parent and Merger Sub, (x) in cash or (y) by paying
in cash an amount equal to not less than the aggregate par value of such Top-
Up Shares and delivery of a promissory note for the

   



   

\- 9 - 
--- 

 


--- 

    



  


 balance of such aggregate price, which promissory note shall (1) be due on
the first (1st) anniversary of the Top-Up Closing, (2) bear simple interest
of five percent (5%) per annum, payable quarterly, (3) have full recourse to
Parent, (4) be able to be prepaid at any time, in whole or in part, without
premium or penalty and (5) provide that the unpaid principal and accrued
interest thereunder shall immediately become due and payable (x) in the event
that Merger Sub fails to make any payment of interest as provided therein and
such failure continues for a period of thirty (30) days or (y) upon the
occurrence of customary bankruptcy or insolvency events with respect to
Merger Sub and (B) the Company shall cause to be issued and delivered to
Merger Sub a certificate representing the Top-Up Shares.

  



  

(d) Parent and Merger Sub acknowledge that the Top-Up Shares will
not be registered under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, and the rules
and regulations promulgated thereunder (the " _Securities Act_ "), and will be
issued in reliance upon an exemption thereunder for transactions not
involving a public offering. Each of Parent and Merger Sub hereby represents
and warrants to the Company that each of Parent and Merger Sub is, and will
be upon the purchase of the Top-Up Shares, an "accredited investor," as such
term is defined in Rule 501 of Regulation D under the Securities Act. Parent
and Merger Sub agree that the Top-Up Option and the Top-Up Shares to be
acquired upon exercise of the Top-Up Option are being and will be acquired by
Parent or Merger Sub for the purpose of investment and not with a view to, or
for resale in connection with, any distribution thereof (within the meaning
of the Securities Act).

  



  

(e) Any dilutive impact on the value of the shares of Company Common
Stock as a result of the issuance of the Top-Up Shares and the
consideration for the Top-Up Shares will not be taken into account in any
determination of the fair value of any Dissenting Shares pursuant to Section
60.554 of the OBCA as contemplated by _Section 2.3_.

  



  

Section 1.5  _Short-Form Merger_. If, after the consummation of the Offer and
any subsequent offering period and the exercise, if any, of the Top-Up
Option, the shares of Company Common Stock beneficially owned by Parent and
its Subsidiaries (including Merger Sub) represent at least ninety percent
(90%) of the then outstanding shares of Company Common Stock, Parent shall
cause Merger Sub to, and the Company shall, execute and deliver such
documents and instruments and take such other actions as Parent or Merger Sub
may request in order to cause the Merger to be completed as promptly as
reasonably practicable as provided in Section 60.491 of the OBCA.

  



  

Section 1.6  _The Merger_. Upon the terms and subject to the conditions set
forth herein, and in accordance with the relevant provisions of the OBCA, at
the Effective Time, Merger Sub shall be merged with and into the Company.
Following the Effective Time, the separate corporate existence of Merger Sub
shall cease, and the Company shall continue as the surviving entity in the
Merger (the " _Surviving Entity_ ") and shall succeed to and assume all the
rights and obligations of the Company and Merger Sub in accordance with the
OBCA.

(a) At the Effective Time, by virtue of the Merger and without any
further action on the part of Parent, Merger Sub, the Company or any holder
of any of the following securities:

  



   

\- 11 - 
--- 

 


--- 

    



  

(i) each share of Company Common Stock that is issued and
outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time (other than Dissenting
Shares, if any, and shares to be canceled in accordance with _Section
2.1(a)(ii)_) shall be converted into the right to receive the Offer Price net
to the seller in cash, without interest (the " _Merger Consideration_ "),
subject to any withholding of Tax pursuant to _Section 2.2(b)_ or _Section
2.2(g)_;

  



  

(ii) each share of Company Common Stock that immediately prior to the
Effective Time is owned by Parent, Merger Sub, the Company or any of their
respective Subsidiaries shall be canceled without any consideration being
exchanged therefor; and

  



  

(iii) each share of common stock of Merger Sub issued and outstanding
immediately prior to the Effective Time shall be converted into and become
one validly issued, fully paid and nonassessable share of common stock of the
Surviving Entity.

  



  

(b) All of the shares of Company Common Stock converted into the
right to receive the Merger Consideration pursuant to this _Article
II_ shall no longer be outstanding, and shall automatically be canceled and
shall cease to exist, as of the Effective Time, and each certificate (each, a
" _Certificate_ ") or book-entry share (each, a " _Book-Entry Share_ ")
previously representing any such shares of Company Common Stock shall
thereafter represent only the right to receive the Merger Consideration into
which the shares of Company Common Stock represented by such Certificate or
Book-Entry Share shall have been converted pursuant to this _Section 2.1_.

  



  

Section 2.2  _Exchange and Payment_.

  



  

(a) _Exchange Agent_. At or prior to the Effective Time, Parent
shall deposit, or shall cause to be deposited, on behalf of Merger Sub,
with a bank or trust company designated by Parent with the Company\'s prior
consent, which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld or delayed (the "
_Exchange Agent_ "), in trust for the benefit of the holders of Company Common
Stock for exchange in accordance with this _Article II_ through the Exchange
Agent, immediately available funds sufficient to pay, and Parent shall
instruct the Exchange Agent to timely pay, the aggregate Merger Consideration
(such aggregate Merger Consideration, being hereinafter referred to as the "
_Exchange Fund_ ").

  



  

(b) _Exchange Procedures_. As promptly as practicable after the
Effective Time, and in any event within five (5) Business Days
thereafter, Parent shall cause the Exchange Agent to mail to each holder of
record of shares of Company Common Stock whose shares of Company Common Stock
were converted into the right to receive the Merger Consideration pursuant to
_Section 2.1(a)(i)_: (i) a letter of transmittal in customary form (which
shall specify that delivery shall be effected, and risk of loss and title to
Certificates shall pass, only upon delivery of the Certificates to the
Exchange Agent and which shall have such other provisions as Parent and the

   



   

\- 12 - 
--- 

 


--- 

    



  


 Company may agree) and (ii) instructions for use in surrendering the
Certificates (or affidavits of loss in lieu thereof) or Book-Entry Shares in
exchange for cash comprising the Merger Consideration. Upon surrender of a
Book-Entry Share or a Certificate for cancellation to the Exchange Agent,
together with such letter of transmittal, duly completed and validly executed,
and/or such other documents as may be reasonably required by the Exchange
Agent, the holder of such Book-Entry Share or Certificate shall be entitled
to receive in exchange therefor a check for the Merger Consideration that such
holder is entitled to receive pursuant to the provisions of this _Article
II_, and the Book-Entry Share or Certificate so surrendered shall forthwith be
canceled. In the event of a transfer of ownership of shares of Company Common
Stock that is not registered in the transfer records of the Company, a check
for the proper amount of cash comprising the Merger Consideration shall be
issued to a Person other than the Person in whose name the Certificate so
surrendered is registered, if, upon presentation to the Exchange Agent, such
Certificate shall be properly endorsed or otherwise be in proper form for
transfer. In such case, the amount of any stock transfer or other similar
Taxes (whether imposed on the registered holder(s), or such other Person, or
otherwise) payable on account of such issuance or transfer to such other
Person shall be deducted from the amount otherwise payable pursuant to the
immediately preceding sentence, unless evidence satisfactory to the Exchange
Agent of the payment of such Taxes, or exemption therefrom, is submitted.
Until surrendered as contemplated by this _Section 2.2(b)_, each Book-Entry
Share and Certificate shall be deemed at any time after the Effective Time to
represent only the right to receive upon such surrender the Merger
Consideration. No interest will be paid or will accrue for the benefit of
holders of shares of Company Common Stock on the Merger Consideration payable
to holders of Company Common Stock pursuant to this _Article II_.

  



  

(c) _No Further Ownership Rights in Company Common Stock_. All cash
paid upon the surrender for exchange of Book-Entry Shares or Certificates in
accordance with the terms of this _Article II_ shall be deemed to have been
paid in full satisfaction of all rights pertaining to the shares of Company
Common Stock previously represented by such Book-Entry Shares or Certificates,
and at the close of business on the day on which the Effective Time occurs,
the stock transfer books of the Company shall be closed and there shall be no
further registration of transfers on the stock transfer books of the Surviving
Entity of the shares of Company Common Stock that were outstanding
immediately prior to the Effective Time. Subject to the last sentence of
_Section 2.2(d)_, if, at any time after the Effective Time, Book-Entry
Shares or Certificates are presented to the Surviving Entity or the Exchange
Agent for any reason, they shall be canceled and exchanged as provided in
this _Article II_.

  



  

(d) _Termination of Exchange Fund_. Any portion of the Exchange
Fund that remains undistributed to the holders of Company Common Stock on
the date that is twelve months after the Effective Time shall be delivered to
Parent upon demand. Any holders of Book-Entry Shares or Certificates who have
not theretofore complied with this _Article II_ shall thereafter look only to
Parent with respect to the Merger Consideration. None of Parent, Merger Sub,
the Company, the Surviving Entity or the Exchange Agent shall be liable to
any Person in respect of any cash from the Exchange

  



   

\- 13 - 
--- 

 


--- 

    



  


 Fund delivered to a public official pursuant to any applicable abandoned
property, escheat or similar Law. Any amounts remaining unclaimed by holders
of shares of Company Common Stock five (5) years after the Effective Time (or
such earlier date, immediately prior to such time when the amounts would
otherwise escheat to or become property of any Governmental Authority) shall
become, to the extent permitted by applicable Law, the property of Parent
free and clear of any claim or interest of any Person previously
entitled thereto.

  



  

(e) _Investment of Exchange Fund_. The Exchange Agent shall invest
any cash included in the Exchange Fund, as directed by Parent, on a
daily basis; _provided_ , that (i) no such investment gains or losses thereon
shall affect the amounts payable to the holders of shares of Company Common
Stock pursuant to this Agreement, (ii) following any losses in the Exchange
Fund, Parent shall promptly provide additional funds to the Exchange Agent to
the extent such losses result in the amount of cash in the Exchange Fund
being less than the amounts that remain payable to the holders of shares of
Company Common Stock under this Agreement and (iii) such investments shall be
in (A) short-term obligations of or guaranteed by the United States of America
with maturities of no more than thirty (30) days, (B) in commercial paper
obligations rated A-1 or P-1 or better by Moody\'s Investor Services, Inc. or
Standard and Poor\'s Financial Services LLC, respectively or (C) short-term
certificates of deposit with maturities of no more than thirty (30) days or
overnight bank repurchase agreements, in each case, of commercial banks with
capital exceeding $5 billion (based on the most recent financial statements
of such bank that are then publicly available). The Exchange Fund shall not be
used for any other purpose, except as provided in this Agreement.

  



  

(f) _Lost Certificates_. If any Certificate shall have been lost,
stolen or destroyed, upon the making of an affidavit of that fact by the
Person claiming such Certificate to be lost, stolen or destroyed and, if
reasonably requested by Parent, the posting by such Person of a bond in such
reasonable and customary amount as Parent may reasonably request as indemnity
against any claim that may be made against it, the Surviving Entity or the
Exchange Agent with respect to such Certificate, Parent shall cause the
Exchange Agent to issue in exchange for such lost, stolen or destroyed
Certificate, the Merger Consideration, in accordance with the terms of this
Agreement.

  



  

(g) _Withholding_. The Exchange Agent, Parent, the Company and the
Surviving Entity shall be entitled to deduct and withhold from the
consideration otherwise payable pursuant to this Agreement to any holder of
shares of Company Common Stock or equity awards under Company Benefit Plans,
or any Person to whom any payment is required to be made pursuant to _Section
2.4_ hereof, such amounts as it is required to deduct and withhold with
respect to the making of such payment under the Internal Revenue Code of 1986,
as amended (the " _Code_ "), and the rules and regulations promulgated
thereunder, or any provision of state, local or foreign Tax law. To the
extent that amounts are so withheld by the Exchange Agent, Parent, the Company
or the Surviving Entity, such withheld amounts shall be treated for all
purposes of this Agreement as having been paid to the holder of shares of the

  



   

\- 14 - 
--- 

 


--- 

    



  


 Company Common Stock or equity awards under Company Benefit Plans, or to
those Persons who are entitled to any such payments, in respect of which such
deduction and withholding was made.

  



  

Section 2.3  _Dissenters\' Rights_. Notwithstanding any other provision
contained in this Agreement, no shares of Company Common Stock that are
issued and outstanding as of the Effective Time and that are held by a
shareholder who has properly exercised any dissenters\' rights that may be
applicable in respect of such shares (any such shares being referred to herein
as " _Dissenting Shares_ ") under Section 60.551 _et seq_ of the OBCA shall
be converted into the right to receive the Merger Consideration as
provided in _Section 2.1_ and instead shall be entitled to such rights as
are granted by Section 60.551 _et seq_ of the OBCA (unless and until such
shareholder shall have failed to timely perfect, or shall have effectively
withdrawn or lost, such shareholder\'s right to dissent from the Merger under
the OBCA) and to receive such consideration as may be determined to be
due with respect to such Dissenting Shares pursuant to and subject to the
requirements of the OBCA. The Company shall (i) give Parent prompt notice of
any notice or demand for appraisal or payment for shares of Company Common
Stock or any withdrawals of such demands and any related instruments received
by the Company and (ii) give Parent the opportunity to participate in and
direct all negotiations and proceedings with respect to any such demands and
not, without the prior written consent of Parent, make any payment with
respect to, or settle, offer to settle or otherwise negotiate any such
demands.

  



  

Section 2.4  _Equity-Based Awards_.

  



  

(a) As of the Effective Time, each option to purchase shares of
Company Common Stock granted under any Company Benefit Plan that is
outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time, whether vested or
unvested (collectively, the " _Company Options_ "), shall be cancelled in
accordance with its terms and the terms of the plan pursuant to which it was
granted and converted into the right of the holder thereof to receive from
the Parent, and Parent shall pay or cause to be paid to each such holder of
Company Options, a lump sum cash payment equal to the product of (i) the
number of shares of Company Common Stock subject to such Company Option and
(ii) the excess, if any, of the Merger Consideration over the exercise price
per share of Company Common Stock under such Company Option.

  



  

(b) As of the Effective Time, each grant of stock appreciation
rights (" _SARs_ ") under any Company Benefit Plan that is outstanding
immediately prior to the Effective Time (collectively, the " _Company SARs "_)
shall be fully vested and, at the Effective Time, cancelled in accordance
with its terms and the terms of the plan pursuant to which it was granted, and
each such Company SAR shall be converted into the right of the holder thereof
to receive from the Parent, and Parent shall pay or cause to be paid to the
holder thereof, at the Effective Time, a lump sum cash payment equal to (x)
the aggregate amount, if any, by which the Merger Consideration exceeds the
base prices of the Company SARs held, by such holder.

Company or (ii) assuming that the consents, approvals and filings referred to

60.801 _et seq_  of the OBCA) (collectively, " _Takeover Laws_ ") be
applicable to the Merger or any of the other transactions contemplated by
this Agreement.

notification, Permit or authorization of, action, nonaction by or in respect
of, waiver, clearance, or registration, declaration or filing with, any

Section 3.5  _Company SEC Reports; Financial Statements; No Undisclosed
Liabilities; Internal Controls_.

  



  

(a) Since January 31, 2010, the Company has timely filed or
furnished, as applicable, all forms, reports and documents required to be
filed or furnished by it with the SEC, all of which have complied as of their
respective filing dates or, if amended or superseded by a subsequent filing
prior to the date hereof, the date of the last such amendment or superseding
filing, in all material respects with all applicable requirements of the
Securities Act, the Exchange Act and the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 (the "
_Sarbanes-Oxley Act_ "). None of the forms, reports or documents filed or
furnished by the Company with the SEC since such date (the " _Company SEC
Reports_ "), including any financial statements, exhibits, schedules or other
information included or incorporated by reference therein, at the time filed
(and, in the case of a registration statement, as of its effective date) or,
if amended or superseded by a subsequent filing prior to the date hereof, as
of the date of the last such amendment or superseding filing, contained any
untrue statement of a material fact or omitted to state a material fact
required to be stated therein or necessary in order to make the statements
therein, in light of the circumstances under which they were made, not
misleading.

  



  

(b) The financial statements of the Company included or incorporated
by reference in the Company SEC Reports (including the related notes and
schedules) (i) have been prepared from, and are in accordance with, the books
and records of the Company and its Subsidiaries, (ii) fairly present in all
material respects the consolidated results of operations, cash flows, changes
in shareholders\' equity and consolidated financial position of the Company
and its Subsidiaries for the respective fiscal periods or as of the
respective dates therein set forth (subject, in the case of unaudited
financial statements, to normal year-end audit adjustments that will not,
individually or in the aggregate, be material in amount), (iii) complied, as
of their respective dates of filing with the SEC, in all material respects
with the published rules and regulations of the SEC with respect thereto, and
(iv) have been prepared in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting
principles (" _GAAP_ ") consistently applied during the periods involved
except as indicated in such statements or in the notes thereto.

  



  

(c) None of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries has any claim,
liability or obligation of any nature whatsoever (whether absolute,
accrued, known or unknown, contingent or otherwise and whether due or to
become due) that is required to be set forth on a balance sheet prepared in
accordance with GAAP (but including any off-balance sheet financings, loans,
make-whole or similar liabilities or obligations, whether or not required to
be disclosed under GAAP), except for those liabilities and obligations: (i)
that are reflected or reserved against in the Company\'s consolidated balance
sheet as of January 31, 2012 included in the Company SEC Reports, including
any notes thereto; (ii) expressly permitted by this Agreement; or (iii)
incurred in the ordinary course of business consistent with past practice
since January 31, 2012, that

  



   

\- 21 -

--- 

    



  


 have not had and would not reasonably be expected to have, either
individually or in the aggregate, a Material Adverse Effect on the Company.

  



  

(d) The Company has in place a system of internal control over
financial reporting (as defined in Rules 13a-15(f) and 15d-15(f) of
the Exchange Act) to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability
of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements in
accordance with GAAP and such system is effective at the reasonable assurance
level. The Company (i) has implemented and maintains disclosure controls and
procedures (as defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) under the Exchange
Act) designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed by the
Company in the reports it files or submits under the Exchange Act
is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods
specified in the SEC\'s rules and forms and is communicated to the Company\'s
management (including the Company\'s principal executive and principal
financial officers, or persons performing similar functions) as appropriate
to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure and to make the
certifications required pursuant to Sections 302 and 906 of the Sarbanes-
Oxley Act and such controls and procedures are effective, and (ii) has
disclosed, based on its most recent evaluation of such controls and
procedures prior to the date hereof, to the Company\'s outside auditors and
the audit committee of the Company\'s Board of Directors (and made summaries
of such disclosures available to Parent): (x) any significant deficiencies
and material weaknesses in the design or operation of internal controls over
financial reporting (as defined in Rule 13a-15(f) of the Exchange Act) which
are reasonably likely to adversely affect the Company\'s ability to record,
process, summarize and report financial information and (y) any fraud,
whether or not material, that involves management or other employees who have
a significant role in the Company\'s internal controls over financial
reporting. Each of the Company and its Subsidiaries has substantially
addressed any such significant deficiency, material weakness or fraud. As of
the date hereof, there is no reason to believe that the Company\'s outside
auditors, chief executive officer and chief financial officer will not be able
to give the certifications and attestations required pursuant to the rules
and regulations adopted pursuant to Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act,
without qualification, when required.

  



  

(e) Each of the principal executive officer and the principal
financial officer of the Company (or each former principal executive
officer and each former principal financial officer of the Company, as
applicable) has made all certifications required by Rule 13a-14 or 15d-14
under the Exchange Act and Sections 302 and 906 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act and
the related rules and regulations promulgated by the SEC and the NYSE with
respect to the Company SEC Reports, and the statements contained in such
certifications were complete and correct on the date such certifications were
made. For purposes of this _Section 3.5(e)_ "principal executive officer"
and "principal financial officer" shall have the meanings given to such terms
in the Sarbanes-Oxley Act. Neither the Company nor any of its Subsidiaries
has any outstanding "extensions of credit" or has arranged any
outstanding "extensions of credit" to directors or executive officers in
violation of Section 402 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act.

Agreement, there are no outstanding or unresolved comments in comment letters
received from the SEC staff with respect to any Company SEC Reports.

none of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries nor any of their
directors, officers, employees, auditors, accountants or Representatives has
received any material complaint, whether written or oral, regarding the
accounting or auditing practices, procedures, methodologies or methods of the
Company or its Subsidiaries and (ii) no attorney representing the Company or
any of its Subsidiaries has reported evidence of a material violation of
securities Laws, breach of fiduciary duty or similar violation by the
Company, its Subsidiaries or any of their respective officers, directors,
employees or agents to the Board of Directors of the Company or any committee
thereof or to the chief executive officer of the Company in accordance with

(c) Since January 31, 2012, and prior to the date hereof, there has
not been any action taken by the Company or any of its Subsidiaries that, if
taken during the period from the date of this Agreement through the Effective
Time, would constitute a breach of any of the covenants set forth in
_Sections 5.1(a)_, _(b)_ , _(c)_ , _(d)_ (other than with respect to grants
of Company SARs or Company Restricted Shares in the ordinary course in
compliance with the applicable Company Benefit Plans), _(f)_ ,  _(h)_ , _(i)_
, _(n)_ , _(p)_ , _(q)_ , _(t)_ , _(u)_ , _(v)_ , _(x)_ and _(aa)_ ;

extent that it relates to any of the foregoing clauses of _Section 5.1_
referenced in this _Section 3.6(c)_.

  



  

Section 3.7  _Legal Proceedings_. There is no suit, action, claim, complaint,
proceeding or investigation by or before any Governmental Authority or
arbitrator (" _Action_ ") pending or, to the Knowledge of the Company,
threatened against the Company or any of its Subsidiaries or to which any of
their respective properties or assets are subject that has had or would

 case, if adversely determined) or would not reasonably be expected to have
the effect of, preventing, delaying, making illegal or otherwise interfering

Acquisition Proposal shall be considered an adverse modification), (ii) if a
tender offer or exchange offer for Company Common Stock that constitutes an
Acquisition Proposal (whether or not a Superior Proposal) is commenced by a
Person unaffiliated with Parent, fail to file, within ten (10) Business Days
following Parent\'s written request to do so, a Schedule 14D-9 pursuant to

that the shareholders reject such Acquisition Proposal, (iii)
approve, recommend or declare advisable any Acquisition Proposal made or

permitted under _Section 5.2(c)_) or (v) fail to include the Company
Recommendation in the Schedule 14D-9, (vi) release any Person from, or grant
any waiver of, or fail to enforce any standstill or similar agreement, unless
the Company\'s Board of Directors determines in good faith,
after consultation with its financial advisors and outside counsel, that it
would be inconsistent with its fiduciary duties under applicable Law not to
do so, or (vii) take any action pursuant to which any Person (other than
Parent, Merger Sub or their respective Affiliates) or Acquisition Proposal
would become exempt from or not otherwise subject to any Takeover Law (any of
the actions described in clauses (i) through (vii) of this _Section 5.3(a)_,
a " _Company Change of Recommendation_ ").

  



  

(b) Notwithstanding  _Section 5.3(a)_ or anything to the contrary
set forth in this Agreement, at any time prior to the Acceptance Time, the
Company\'s Board of Directors (or any committee thereof) may, in the event
that the Company\'s Board of Directors (or any committee thereof) determines
in good faith, after consultation with its financial advisor and outside legal
counsel, that a failure to effect a Company Change of Recommendation would
reasonably be expected to be inconsistent with its fiduciary duties to the
Company and its shareholders under applicable Law, effect any Company Change
of Recommendation pursuant to any clause of _Section 5.3(a)_;  _provided_ ,
that (i) the Company has provided at least twenty-four (24) hours prior
written notice to Parent that it intends to effect a Company Change of
Recommendation, describing in reasonable detail the reasons for such Company
Change of Recommendation (a " _Recommendation Change Notice_ ") and, in the
case of a Superior Proposal, including the material terms and conditions of
such Superior Proposal and attach a copy of the

   



   

\- 54 -

--- 

    



  


 most current draft of any written agreement relating thereto (it being
agreed that the Recommendation Change Notice and any amendment or update to
such notice and the determination to so deliver such notice, or update or
amend public disclosures with respect thereto shall not constitute a Company
Change of Recommendation for purposes of this Agreement); (ii) if requested by
Parent after receipt of such notice, the Company shall have discussed and
negotiated in good faith and have made its Representatives available to
discuss with Parent\'s Representatives and negotiate in good faith (to the
extent Parent desires to negotiate) any proposed modifications to the terms
and conditions of this Agreement during the period beginning at 5:00 p.m.
Pacific time on the day of delivery by the Company to Parent of such
Recommendation Change Notice and ending four (4) Business Days later at 5:00
p.m. Pacific time; _provided_ , however that in the event there is a material
change to the facts and circumstances underlying the decision to effect a
Company Change of Recommendation (including any amendment to any material term
of a Superior Proposal), the Company shall be required to deliver a new
Recommendation Change Notice to Parent and to comply again with
the requirements of this _Section 5.3_, except that references to the four
(4) Business Day period in this clause; (ii) shall be deemed references to a
two (2) Business Day period; and (iii) the Company\'s Board of Directors (or
any committee thereof) shall have determined in good faith (after
consultation with outside legal counsel), after considering in good faith the
terms of any proposed amendment or modification to this Agreement, that the
failure to effect a Company Change of Recommendation would still reasonably
be expected to be inconsistent with its fiduciary duties to the Company and
its shareholders under applicable Law. Any Company Change of Recommendation
shall not change the approval of this Agreement or any other approval of the
Board of Directors of the Company in any respect that would have the effect
of causing any Takeover Law to be applicable to any of the Transactions.
Nothing in this _Section 5.3_ shall in any way limit or otherwise affect
Parent\'s right to terminate this Agreement under _Section 8.1(e)_.

  



  

(c) Nothing in this Agreement shall prohibit or restrict the Company
or the Company\'s Board of Directors (or any committee thereof) from,
without limiting the generality of _Section 5.3(a)_, (i) taking and
disclosing to the Company\'s shareholders a position contemplated by Rule
14e-2(a) under the Exchange Act or complying with the provisions of Rule 14d-9
promulgated under the Exchange Act or (ii) issuing a "stop look and listen"
statement pending disclosure of its position thereunder as contemplated by
Rule 14d-9(f) under the Exchange Act.

 the Company Bylaws, (i) prepare and file with the SEC proxy materials that
shall constitute the proxy statement or information statement relating to the
matters to be submitted to the shareholders of the Company at the Company
Shareholders Meeting (such proxy statement or information statement, and any
amendments or supplements thereto, the " _Proxy Statement_ ") and (ii) use
its reasonable best efforts to cause the Proxy Statement to be mailed to its
shareholders and cleared by the SEC as promptly as possible after the Company
learns that the Proxy Statement will not be reviewed or that the SEC staff has
no further comments thereon. Each of the Company and Parent will cooperate
with each other and respond promptly to any comments from the SEC or the staff
of the SEC on the Proxy Statement. No filing of, or amendment or supplement
to (including any response to SEC comments), the Proxy Statement will be made
by the Company, without providing Parent and its counsel a reasonable
opportunity to review and comment thereon and giving due consideration to
such comments. If at any time prior to the Effective Time any information
relating to the Company or Parent, or any of their respective Affiliates,
directors or officers, should be discovered by the Company or Parent which
should be set forth in an amendment or a supplement to the Proxy Statement so
that such document would not include any misstatement of a material fact or
omit to state any material fact necessary to make the statements therein, in
light of the circumstances under which they were made, not misleading, the
party that discovers such information shall promptly notify the other
parties hereto, and the Company shall promptly file with the SEC an
appropriate amendment or supplement describing such information and, to the
extent required by Law, shall disseminate such amendment or supplement to the

amendments or supplements to the Proxy Statement, as applicable, or for
additional information and shall supply each other with copies of all

Section 6.2  _Access to Information; Confidentiality_.

  



  

(a) Subject to applicable Laws, the Company shall afford to Parent
and its Representatives reasonable access (including, if applicable,
the right at Parent\'s expense to make copies) during normal business hours
during the period from the date hereof until the earlier to occur of the
Effective Time and the date, if any, on which this Agreement is terminated
pursuant to _Section 8.1_ to its and its Subsidiaries\' properties, books,
work papers, operating and financial reports, Tax Returns, Contracts,

be amended from time to time, the " _Confidentiality Agreement_ ").
Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Company shall not be obligated to
provide any such access or information to the extent that doing so (x) may
cause a waiver of an attorney-client privilege or loss of attorney work
product protection, (y) would violate a confidentiality obligation to any
Person or (z) would violate any Law applicable to it, its Subsidiaries or its
business; it being understood and agreed that the Company shall advise Parent
in such circumstances that it is unable to comply with Parent\'s reasonable
requests for information or access as a result of attorney-client
privilege, confidentiality obligations or applicable Law and the Company
shall use its commercially reasonable efforts to generally describe the types
of information being withheld. The disclosing party shall be entitled to have
its Representatives present at all times during any inspection pursuant to
this _Section 6.2_. No access or information provided pursuant to this
_Section 6.2_ will affect any of the representations or warranties of the
parties contained in this Agreement.

  



  

(b) Notwithstanding anything in this _Section 6.2_ to the contrary,
neither Parent nor any of its Representatives shall (i) contact or have any
discussions with any of the Company\'s employees below the level of Vice
President, unless in each case an employee at or above the level of Senior
Vice President has (A) made such employee available or (B) given written
consent to discussions with such employee, (ii) damage any property or any
portion thereof, or (iii) perform any onsite procedure or
investigation (including any onsite environmental investigation or study)
that involves physical disturbance or damage to any property or any portions
thereof.

  



  

(c) No access or information provided pursuant to this _Section
6.2_ or information provided or received by any party hereto pursuant to this
Agreement will affect any of the representations or warranties of the parties
hereto contained in this Agreement or the conditions hereunder to the
obligations of the parties hereto.

the Company and Parent shall use its reasonable best efforts to take,
or cause to be taken, all actions, and to do, or cause to be done, and to
assist and cooperate with each other in doing, all things necessary, proper
or advisable to consummate and make effective, in the most expeditious manner
reasonably practicable, the Merger and the other Transactions, _provided_ ,
that no such actions shall be required that would reasonably be expected to
have a Material Adverse Effect on or with respect to the Company. Without
limiting the foregoing but subject to the foregoing proviso, each of the
Company and Parent shall (i) use their respective reasonable best efforts to
cause the conditions set forth in _Article VII _and _Annex I_ to be
satisfied on a timely basis; (ii) use their respective reasonable best efforts

any other Governmental Approval) and the making of all necessary registrations
and filings as may be necessary to obtain an approval or waiver from, or to
avoid an Action, as promptly as reasonably practicable, including the payment
of any applicable fees (and the parties hereby agree that the Company and its
Subsidiaries on one hand, and Parent and its Affiliate on the other hand,
shall each be responsible for the payment of their respective fees in
connection with any of the filings and submissions referenced in this
_Section 6.3_); (iii) as promptly as reasonably practicable following the
receipt thereof, respond to (or properly reduce the scope

  



   

\- 58 -

 of) any formal or informal request for additional information or
documentary material received by the Company, Parent or any of
their respective Affiliates from any Governmental Authority whether received
prior to or after the date of this Agreement; (iv) defend all lawsuits or
other legal, regulatory or other proceedings to which it is a party
challenging or affecting this Agreement or the consummation of any of the
Transactions, in each case until the issuance of a final, non-appealable
order, (v) seek to have lifted or rescinded any injunction or restraining
order which may adversely affect the ability of the parties to consummate
any of the Transactions and (vi) consult and cooperate with each other and
consider in good faith the views of each other in connection with any
analyses, appearances, presentations, memoranda, briefs, arguments, opinions
or proposals made or submitted by or on behalf of the Company or Parent or
any of their respective Affiliates in connection with proceedings before any
Governmental Authority with respect to any of the Transactions contemplated
hereby. Each of the Company and Parent shall cooperate with and furnish
information to each other to the extent necessary to (x) prepare each filing
or submission under any Antitrust Law and, if requested, to promptly amend or
furnish additional information thereunder, and (y) keep each other reasonably
informed with respect to the status of each action or nonaction, waiver,
consent or approval sought from a Governmental Authority, in each case, in
connection with the Transactions. Each of the Company and Parent shall, in
connection with the Transactions, without limitation: (1) promptly notify the
other of, and if in writing, furnish the other with copies of (or, in the case
of oral communications, advise the other of) any communications from or with
any Governmental Authority, (2) permit the other to review and discuss in
advance, and consider in good faith the view of the other in connection with,
any proposed written or oral communication with any Governmental
Authority, (3) furnish the other party\'s outside legal counsel with copies
of all filings and communications between it and any such
Governmental Authority with respect to the Transactions; _provided_ , that
such material may be redacted as necessary (I) to comply with contractual
arrangements, (II) to address good faith legal privilege or confidentiality
concerns and (III) to comply with applicable Law and (4) furnish the other
party\'s outside legal counsel with such necessary information and reasonable
assistance as the other party\'s outside legal counsel may reasonably request
in connection with its preparation of necessary submissions of information to
any such Governmental Authority. Where reasonably practical, none of the
parties hereto shall independently participate in any meeting or
conversation, or engage in any substantive conversation with any Governmental
Authority in respect of any filings, submissions or inquiry without giving
the other party prior notice of the meeting or conversation and, unless
prohibited by such Governmental Authority, the opportunity to attend and/or
participate and, if one party is prohibited by applicable Law or by the
applicable Governmental Authority from participating in or attending any
meetings, conferences or conversations, the attending party shall keep the
other reasonably apprised with respect thereto. In connection with and without
limiting the first sentence of this _Section 6.3_, each of the Company,
Parent and the respective Boards of Directors of the Company and Parent shall
(x) take all action reasonably necessary to ensure that no Takeover Law is or
becomes applicable to the Transactions and (y) if any Takeover Law becomes
applicable to the Transactions, take all commercially reasonable actions
necessary to ensure that the Transactions may be completed as promptly as
reasonably practicable on the terms contemplated by this Agreement.

  



  

(b) The Company shall give (or shall cause its Subsidiaries to give)
any notices to third parties, and use, and cause its Subsidiaries to use,
their commercially reasonable efforts to obtain any third party consents
necessary to consummate any of the Transactions;  _provided_ , that the
Company shall, and shall cause its Subsidiaries to coordinate and cooperate
with Parent in determining whether any actions, consents, approvals or
waivers are required to be obtained from any Person in connection with
consummation of the Merger and in seeking any such actions, consents,
approvals or waivers. In the event that the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries shall fail to obtain any third party consent described in this
_Section 6.3(b)_ that is material to the operations of the Company, the
Company shall, or shall cause its applicable Subsidiary to use its
commercially reasonable efforts, and take or cause to be taken any such
actions reasonably requested by Parent, to minimize any adverse effect upon
the Company or its Subsidiaries resulting, or which could reasonably be
expected to result, after the Effective Time, as applicable, from the failure
to obtain such consent.

  



  

(c) Neither the Company nor Parent shall, nor shall they permit
their respective Subsidiaries or Affiliates to, acquire or agree to
acquire any business, Person or division thereof, or otherwise acquire or
agree to acquire any assets, if, upon advice of such party\'s outside legal
counsel, the entering into of a definitive agreement relating

 to or the consummation of such acquisition, would reasonably be expected to
materially delay, materially increase the likelihood of not obtaining, or
require any action, nonaction, waiver, clearance, consent or approval under
the HSR Act or applicable requirements of other applicable Antitrust Laws in
connection with the Transactions prior to the Outside Date or (ii) would
reasonably be expected to require any action, nonaction, waiver,
clearance, consent or approval of any other Governmental Authority with
respect to the Transactions.

  



  

(d) Nothing contained in this Agreement shall give Parent or Merger
Sub, directly or indirectly, the right to control or direct the operations of
the Company prior to the Effective Time. Prior to the Effective Time, the
Company shall exercise, consistent with the terms and conditions of this
Agreement, complete unilateral control and supervision over its business
operations.

  



  

Section 6.4  _Directors\' and Officers\' Indemnification and Insurance_.

  



  

(a) Parent and Merger Sub agree that all rights to exculpation and
indemnification for acts or omissions occurring at or prior to the
Effective Time, whether asserted or claimed prior to, at or after the
Effective Time (including any matters arising in connection with
the Transactions or this Agreement), now existing in favor of the current or
former directors, officers or employees, as the case may be, of the Company
or its Subsidiaries (the " _Indemnified Parties_ ") as provided in the Company
Articles, the Company Bylaws (or equivalent organizational documents of the
Company or any of its Subsidiaries) or in any agreement (a "
_Company Indemnity Agreement_ "), each as in effect on the date of this
Agreement, shall survive the Offer and the Merger and shall continue in full
force and effect in accordance with their terms. The Company has made
available to Parent true and complete copies of all Company Indemnity
Agreements.

  



  

(b) Without limiting the provisions of _Section 6.4(a)_, from and
after the Effective Time and for a period of six (6) years thereafter, the
Surviving Entity will (or Parent shall cause the Company or the Surviving
Entity, as applicable, to): (i) indemnify, defend and hold harmless to the
fullest extent permitted by applicable Law, each Indemnified Party from and
against any costs or expenses (including reasonable attorneys\' fees),
judgments, fines, losses, claims, damages, penalties, liabilities and amounts
paid in settlement (including, in each case, any interest or assessments
thereon) in connection with any Action, whether civil, criminal,
administrative or investigative, to the extent such Action arises out of or
pertains to: (A) any action or omission or alleged action or omission in such
Indemnified Party\'s capacity as a director, officer or employee of the
Company or any of its Subsidiaries prior to the Effective Time; or (B) the
Merger, this Agreement and any other Transaction and (ii) provide advancement
of expenses (including reasonable attorneys\' fees) of any Indemnified Party
incurred in connection with any such Action upon receipt of an undertaking by
or on behalf of such Indemnified Party to repay such amount if it shall
ultimately be determined that such Indemnified Party is not entitled to be
indemnified. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Indemnified Parties as a group
may retain only one law firm to represent them with respect to each such
matter unless there is, under applicable standards of professional conduct, a
conflict on any significant issue between the positions of any two or more
Indemnified Parties.

(c) The Surviving Entity will (and Parent shall cause the Company or
the Surviving Entity, as applicable, to) provide, for a period of not less
than six (6) years after the Effective Time, the Indemnified Parties who are
insured under the Company\'s directors\' and officers\' insurance and
indemnification policy with an insurance and indemnification policy (from
either (i) the Company\'s existing insurance carrier or (ii) an insurance
carrier that is reasonably satisfactory to the Company) that provides coverage
for events occurring at or prior to the Effective Time (the " _D andO
Insurance_") that is no less favorable than the existing policy of the
Company; _provided_ , that the cost of such DandO Insurance shall in no event
exceed three hundred percent (300%) of the annual premium paid as of the date
hereof by the Company for such insurance (which amount is set forth in
_Section 6.4(c)_ of the Company Disclosure Schedule). Notwithstanding
anything to the contrary in this Agreement, the Company may and at
Parent\'s request shall, prior to the Effective Time, purchase a "tail"
directors\' and officers\' insurance and indemnification policy, _provided_ ,
that payment for each year of insurance coverage provided by such "tail"
directors\' and officers\' insurance policy shall not exceed three hundred
(300%) of the annual premium paid as of the date hereof by the Company. Any
such "tail" directors\' and officers\' insurance and indemnification policy
will satisfy the Surviving Entity\'s obligation under this _Section 6.4(c)_
to provide DandO Insurance. In the event the cap on amounts to be paid for DandO
Insurance, whether for a new policy or tail coverage, is reached, the most
protective policy of DandO insurance that can be acquired for a premium equal
to such cap shall be purchased.

  



  

(d) The Indemnified Parties to whom this _Section 6.4_ applies
shall be third party beneficiaries of this _Section 6.4_. The provisions of
this _Section 6.4_ are intended to be for the benefit of each Indemnified
Party and his or her successors, heirs and Representatives.

  



  

(e) Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, this _Section
6.4 _shall survive the consummation of the Merger and shall be
binding, jointly and severally, on all successors and assigns of the Company,
the Surviving Entity and its Subsidiaries, and shall be enforceable by the
Indemnified Parties and their successors, heirs or Representatives. In the
event that the Company or the Surviving Entity or any of their respective
successors or assigns consolidates with or merges into any other Person and
shall not be the continuing or surviving corporation or entity of such
consolidation or merger or transfers or conveys all or a majority of its
properties and assets to any Person, then, and in each such case, to the
extent necessary, proper provision shall be made so that such other Person or
the successors and assigns of Parent or the Surviving Entity as the case may
be shall succeed to its obligations set forth in this _Section 6.4_.

  



  

Section 6.5  _Fees and Expenses_. Except as otherwise provided in this
Agreement, all fees and expenses incurred in connection with this Agreement,
the Offer, the Merger and the other Transactions contemplated by this
Agreement shall be paid by the party incurring such fees or expenses, whether
or not any of the Transactions are consummated.

Section 6.6  _Public Announcements_. Parent and the Company shall consult
with each other before issuing, and, to the extent practicable, give each
other the reasonable opportunity to review and comment upon, any press release
or other public statements with respect to the Transactions, including the
Offer and the Merger, and shall not issue any such press release or make any
such public statement, nor schedule any press conference or conference call
with investors or analysts prior to such consultation, except as Parent
or the Company, as applicable, may determine in good faith is required by
applicable Law, court process or by obligations pursuant to any listing
agreement with any national securities exchange, in which case the party
required to make the release or announcement shall use reasonable best
efforts to allow the other party reasonable time to comment on such release or
announcement in advance of such issuance, it being understood that the final
form and content of any such release or announcement shall be at the
final discretion of the disclosing party. Prior to making any material
written communications to the employees of the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries relating to the Transactions, the Company shall provide Parent
with a copy of the intended communication. The parties agree that the initial
press release to be issued with respect to the Transactions shall be a joint
press release in the form heretofore agreed to by the parties.

  



  

Section 6.7  _Employee Matters_.

  



  

(a) For the period immediately following the Acceptance Time through
December 31, 2013, Parent shall, or shall cause the Surviving Entity or its
Subsidiaries to, (i) provide to each individual actively employed by the
Company or one of its Subsidiaries as of the Acceptance Time who does not
terminate employment prior to becoming an employee of the Surviving Entity
(excluding any employee covered under the terms of a Collective Bargaining
Agreement) (collectively, the " _Covered Employees_ ") with at least the
same level of base salary or base wages and (ii) except as set forth in
_Section 6.7(a)_ of the Company Disclosure Schedule, provide each Covered
Employee with employee benefits and periodic and annual bonus and incentive
opportunities that in the aggregate are substantially similar to the employee
benefits (excluding any equity-based compensation arrangements, change in
control, severance, retention or other benefits with respect to a transaction
occurring after the Closing Date) and annual target bonus
opportunities provided to such Covered Employee under the Disclosed Company
Benefit Plans as in effect immediately prior to the Acceptance
Time. Notwithstanding the foregoing, nothing contained in this Agreement
shall (i) prevent the amendment or termination of any Company Benefit Plan in
accordance with its terms, or interfere with the right or obligation of Parent
or the Surviving Entity or any of their respective Subsidiaries to make such
changes as are necessary to conform with applicable Law or (ii) limit the
right of Parent or the Surviving Entity or any of their respective
Subsidiaries to terminate, or change the terms of, the employment of any
employee at any time.

(b) For purposes of determining eligibility to participate, and to
the extent that a Covered Employee becomes eligible to participate
or commences to participate in an employee benefit plan maintained by Parent
or the Surviving Entity, Parent shall cause such employee benefit plan to (i)
recognize the service of such Covered Employee with the Company or its
Subsidiaries for purposes of eligibility, vesting, level of benefits and
benefit accrual (other than benefit accrual under a defined benefit pension
plan) under such employee benefit plan to the same extent such service was
recognized immediately prior to the Acceptance Time under a comparable
Company Benefit Plan in which such Covered Employee was a participant
immediately prior to the Acceptance Time, _provided_ , that (A) recognition
of such service shall not be required to the extent that the service of
employees other than Covered Employees is not so recognized under such
employee benefit plans and (B) such recognition of service shall not operate
to duplicate any benefits payable to the Covered Employee with respect to the
same period of service, and (ii) with respect to any health, dental or
vision plan of Parent or any of its Subsidiaries (other than Company and its
Subsidiaries) in which any Covered Employee commences to participate, in the
plan year that includes the year in which such Covered Employee commences to
participate, (x) cause any pre-existing condition limitations under such
Parent or Subsidiary plan to be waived with respect to such Covered Employee
to the extent such limitation would have been waived or satisfied under the
comparable Company Benefit Plan in which such Covered Employee
participated immediately prior to such commencement of participation, and (y)
recognize any medical or other health expenses incurred by such Covered
Employee in the year that includes the date of the Acceptance Time for
purposes of any applicable deductible and annual out-of-pocket expense
requirements under any such health, dental or vision plan of Parent or any of
its Subsidiaries (including the Surviving Entity), to the extent such
expenses were recognized under a comparable Company Benefit Plan.

  



  

(c) From and after the Acceptance Time, Parent shall, or shall cause
the Surviving Entity to, honor, in accordance with the terms thereof as in
effect as of the date hereof each employment or change in control agreement
listed in _Section 6.7(c)_ of the Company Disclosure Schedule.

  



  

(d) Prior to the scheduled expiration of the Offer, the Company
(acting through its Board of Directors or an appropriate committee
thereof) shall take all such steps as may be required to cause to be exempt
under Rule 14d-10(d) promulgated under the Exchange Act any Arrangements that
have been, or after the date of this Agreement will be, entered into by the
Company or any of the Company\'s Subsidiaries with any Company Security
holders and to ensure that any such Arrangements fall within the safe harbor
provisions of such rule.

  



  

(e) This  _Section 6.7_ shall be binding upon and inure solely to
the benefit of the parties to this Agreement, and nothing in this Agreement,
express or implied, is intended: (i) to confer upon any Company Employee or
any other Person, any rights or remedies, including any right to employment
or continued employment for any period or terms of employment, of any nature
whatsoever under or by reason of this Agreement, or (ii) be treated as an
amendment or other modification of any Company Benefit Plan or other
employee benefit plan or arrangement.

Section 6.8  _Notification of Certain Matters_. Each party shall give prompt
written notice to the other party upon becoming aware of the occurrence or
nonoccurrence of any change, effect, event, change in circumstance, occurrence
or the discovery of any fact, that would reasonably be expected to (A) cause
any of the conditions to Closing set forth in _Article VII_ not to be
satisfied and (B) in the case of the Company, cause any of the conditions set
forth in _Annex I_ not to be satisfied, (b) of any written communication
from any Person alleging that the consent of such Person is required in

terminate the Company Loan Agreement and all related agreements on or prior to

the Acceptance Time, the final form of payoff letters to be executed by third-
party lenders or an agent, if applicable, on their behalf, in form and
substance reasonably satisfactory to Parent and the Company, with respect to
all Indebtedness and other obligations of the Company and its Subsidiaries
under the Company Loan Agreement, _provided_ , that the Company shall not be
required to deliver any prepayment notice or payoff letter unless the
requisite lenders under the Company Loan Agreement acknowledge and agree that
such prepayment or payoff is not irrevocable and that prepayment of the
Company Loan Agreement shall not be required unless and until the Acceptance
Time occurs. Parent and the Company shall use reasonable best efforts to
procure that such payoff letters shall (i) provide for a mutually reasonably
satisfactory arrangement (which arrangement may include replacement or
backstop letters of credit issued under Parent\'s credit facility) with
respect to, any letters of credit issued for the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries (including any letters of credit issued under the Company Loan
Agreement) and (ii) correctly specify the amounts, including any applicable
premiums, fees and expenses, if any, necessary to repay such Indebtedness and
completely discharge the obligations of the Company and its Subsidiaries with
respect to such Indebtedness and release any Encumbrances on the assets and
properties of the Company and its Subsidiaries relating to such Indebtedness.
Subject to its receipt of the payoff letters referred to in this _Section

 Agreement (which shall be the date of receipt by the applicable party of a
termination notice pursuant to _Section 8.1_) (including prior to the date
of termination), then the Company shall pay to Parent $30,360,969 (the "
_Termination Fee_ ") by wire transfer of immediately available funds to an
account or accounts designated in writing by Parent, within two (2) Business
Days after the earlier of the date the Company enters into such definitive
agreement or the date of the completion of such transaction; _provided_

(e) Each of the Company and Parent acknowledges and agrees that the
agreements contained in this _Section 8.2_ are an integral part of the
Transactions, and that, without these agreements, neither the Company nor
Parent would have entered into this Agreement; accordingly, if the Company
fails promptly to pay the Termination Fee due pursuant to _Section 8.2_, and,
in order to obtain such payment, Parent commences a Proceeding that results
in an award against the Company for such fee, then the Company shall pay
Parent, such party\'s costs and expenses (including reasonable attorneys\'
fees and expenses) in connection with such Proceeding, together with interest
on the amount of the applicable fee from the date such payment was required to
be made until the date of payment at the prime lending rate as published in
The Wall Street Journal in effect on the date such payment was required to
be made. It is acknowledged and agreed that the Termination Fee is not a
penalty, but rather is liquidated damages in a reasonable amount that will
compensate Parent in the circumstances in which the Termination Fee is
payable.

  



  

(f) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement (but
subject to _Section 9.7_), (x) if the Company pays the Termination Fee, then
such payment shall be the sole and exclusive remedy of Parent and Merger Sub
against the Company and its Subsidiaries and any of their respective former,
current or future officers, directors, partners, shareholders, managers,
members, Affiliates or successors, and (y) if Parent or Merger Sub receives
any payments from the Company in respect of any breach of this Agreement, and
thereafter Parent is entitled to receive

  



   

\- 68 -

 the Termination Fee under _Section 8.2_, the amount of such
Termination Fee shall be reduced by the aggregate amount of any payments made
by the Company to Parent or Merger Sub in respect of any such breaches of
this Agreement. In no event shall the Company be required to pay the
Termination Fee on more than one occasion.

  



  

Section 8.3  _Effect of Termination_. In the event of termination of this
Agreement by either the Company or Parent as provided in _Section 8.1_, this
Agreement shall forthwith become void and have no further force or effect,
without any liability or obligation on the part of Parent, Merger Sub or the
Company, _provided_ that the provisions of _Section 1.1(g)_, _Section
6.5_,  _Section 8.2_, this _Section 8.3_, _Article IX_, and the second
sentence of _Section 6.2(a)_ shall survive such termination; and _provided
further_ , that nothing herein shall relieve any party from any liability
for any willful and material breach hereof prior to such termination. For
purposes of this Agreement, "willful and material breach" shall mean a
material breach that is a consequence of an act undertaken by the breaching
party with the actual knowledge that the taking of such act would, or would
be reasonably expected to, cause a material breach of this Agreement.

  



  

Section 8.4  _Amendment_. Subject to _Section 1.3(b)_, this Agreement may be
amended by the parties hereto at any time before or after receipt of the
Company Shareholder Approval, to the extent required by applicable Law;
_provided_ , however, that after any such approval has been obtained, there
shall be made no amendment that by Law requires further approval by the
shareholders of the Company or Parent without such further approval having
been obtained. This Agreement may not be amended except by an instrument in
writing signed on behalf of each of the parties hereto.

  



  

Section 8.5  _Extension; Waiver_. At any time prior to the Effective Time,
the parties may (i) extend the time for the performance of any of the
obligations or other acts of the other parties, (ii) waive any inaccuracies in
the representations and warranties contained herein or in any document
delivered pursuant hereto or (iii) subject to _Section 1.1(b)_ and the
proviso to the first sentence of _Section 8.4_, waive compliance with any of
the agreements or conditions contained herein. Any agreement on the part of a
party to any such extension or waiver shall be valid only if set forth in an
instrument in writing signed on behalf of such party. The failure of any
party to this Agreement to assert any of its rights under this Agreement or
otherwise shall not constitute a waiver of such rights.

  



  

Article IX _ 
 Miscellaneous_

  



  

Section 9.1  _Nonsurvival of Representations and Warranties_. None of the
representations and warranties in this Agreement shall survive the Effective
Time. This _Section 9.1_ shall not limit the survival of the covenants set
forth in _Section 6.2_ (Access to Information; Confidentiality), _Section
6.4_ (Directors\' and Officers\' Indemnification and Insurance), _Section
6.5_ (Fees and Expenses) and any other covenant or agreement of the parties

parties.

  



  

Section 9.4  _Entire Agreement; No Third-Party Beneficiaries_. This
Agreement, including the Company Disclosure Schedule and the
Confidentiality Agreement (a) constitute the entire agreement, and supersede
all prior agreements and understandings, both written and oral, among the
parties with respect to the subject matter of this Agreement and the

confer upon any Person other than the parties hereto and their respective

relating to or in connection with this Agreement shall be governed by, and
construed in accordance with, the Laws of the State of Delaware, without
giving effect to any choice or conflict of Law provision or rule (whether of
the State of Oregon or of any other jurisdiction) that would cause the

_provided_ , that any disputes with respect to, arising out of, relating to,
or in connection with fiduciary duties of the members of the Board of
Directors of the Company or any other provisions herein that are required by
the "internal affairs doctrine" to be governed by the Laws of the State of
Oregon shall be governed by such Laws of the State of Oregon, but only to the
extent so required.

  



  

Section 9.6  _Assignment_. Neither this Agreement nor any of the rights,
interests or obligations hereunder shall be assigned, in whole or in part, by
operation of Law or otherwise by any of the parties without the prior written

Section 9.7  _Enforcement of the Agreement; Consent to Jurisdiction_. The
parties agree that irreparable damage would occur in the event that any of
the provisions of this Agreement were not performed in accordance with their
specific terms or were otherwise breached or threatened to be breached and
that an award of money damages would be inadequate in such event. It is
accordingly agreed that the parties shall be entitled to equitable relief,
without proof of actual damages, including an injunction or injunctions to
prevent breaches of this Agreement and to enforce specifically the terms and
provisions of this Agreement, this being in addition to any other remedy to
which they are entitled at Law or in equity. The parties further agree to
waive any requirement for the securing or posting of any bond in connection
with the obtaining of any such injunctive or other equitable relief. In
addition, each of Parent, Merger Sub and the Company irrevocably (a) consents
to submit itself to the personal jurisdiction of the Court of Chancery of the
State of Delaware (or, if the Delaware Court of Chancery declines to accept
jurisdiction over a particular matter, any federal court located in the State
of Delaware) with respect to any dispute arising out of, relating to, or in
connection with this Agreement or the Transactions contemplated by this
Agreement, (b) agrees that it will not attempt to deny or defeat such
personal jurisdiction by motion or other request for leave from any such court
and (c) agrees that it will not bring any Action arising out of, relating to
or in connection with this Agreement or the Transactions in any court other
than the Court of Chancery of the State of Delaware (or, if the Delaware
Court of Chancery declines to accept jurisdiction over a particular matter,
any federal court located in the State of Delaware). The parties irrevocably
and unconditionally waive any objection to the laying of venue of any Action
arising out of this Agreement or the Transactions in the Court of Chancery of
the State of Delaware (or, if the Delaware Court of Chancery declines to
accept jurisdiction over a particular matter, any federal court located
in the State of Delaware), and hereby further irrevocably and unconditionally
waive and agree not to assert by way of motion, defense or otherwise in any
such court that (i) such party is not personally subject to the jurisdiction
of the above-named courts for any reason other than the failure to lawfully
serve process, (ii) such party or its property is exempt or immune from
jurisdiction of any such court or from any legal process commenced in such
courts (whether through service of notice, attachment prior to judgment,
attachment in aid of execution of judgment, execution of judgment or
otherwise), (iii) any such Action brought in any such court has been brought
in an inconvenient forum, (iv) that the venue of the such Action is
improper, or (v) that this Agreement or the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement may not be enforced in or by such courts. The consents to
jurisdiction set forth in this _Section 9.7_ shall not constitute general
consents to service of process in the jurisdictions specified above and shall
have no effect for any purpose except as provided in this _Section 9.7_ and
shall not be deemed to confer rights on any Person other than the parties
hereto. Each of the Company, Parent and Merger Sub hereby

 agrees that in addition to any other legally permissible means of service,

incapable of being enforced by any rule of law or public policy, all other
conditions and provisions of this Agreement shall nevertheless remain in full
force and effect for so long as the economic or legal substance of the
Transactions contemplated hereby is not affected in any manner materially
adverse to any party hereto. Upon such determination that any term or other
provision is invalid, illegal or incapable of being enforced, the parties
hereto shall negotiate in good faith to modify this Agreement so as to effect

extent permitted by applicable Law in an acceptable manner to the end that

shares of Company Common Stock on a fully diluted basis (which expressly
includes all shares issuable pursuant to warrants, options, benefit plans, all

other Governmental Approvals shall have been obtained (the "

(c) Other Conditions.

  



  

(i) (A) No Action by a Governmental Authority shall be pending (1)
restraining, enjoining, prohibiting or otherwise making illegal
the consummation of the Transactions, (2) seeking to impose limitations on
the ability of Parent or Merger Sub effectively to exercise full rights of
ownership of the Company Capital Stock, including, without limitation, the
right to vote any Company Capital Stock acquired by Merger Sub or Parent on
all matters properly presented to the Company\'s shareholders, or (3) that, if
adversely determined, would reasonably be expected to have a Material Adverse
Effect on the Company and (B) no Restraint shall be in effect (1)
restraining, enjoining, prohibiting or otherwise making illegal the
consummation of the Transactions, or (2) that would reasonably be expected to
result, directly or indirectly, in any of the consequences referred to in

(ii) As of the date of this Agreement and as of the Acceptance Time
(in each case except that representations and warranties that by their terms
speak as of a specific date or time need only be true and correct as of such
date or time), (A) the representations and warranties of the Company set
forth in the first sentence of _Section 3.1_ and in _Section 3.2_, _Section
3.3 _and _Section 3.6(a)_ of this Agreement shall be true

this Agreement shall be true and correct in all material respects, and (C) the
other representations and warranties of the Company set forth in this
Agreement shall be true and correct in all respects, except where the
failure of such representations and warranties to be true and correct
(without giving effect to any "materiality" or "Material Adverse Effect" or
similar qualifier set forth therein) has not had and would not reasonably be
expected to have, either individually or in the aggregate, a Material Adverse
Effect on the Company.

  



  

(iii) The Company shall have performed or complied in all material
respects with all agreements and covenants to be performed by it under this
Agreement at or prior to such time.

The foregoing conditions are for the sole benefit of Parent and Merger Sub
and, other than the Minimum Tender Condition and the Government Approval
Condition, may be waived by Parent and Merger Sub in whole or in part at any
time and from time to time in their sole discretion, in each case subject to
the terms and conditions of this Agreement and to the extent permitted by
applicable Law. The failure by Parent, Merger Sub or any other Affiliate of
Parent at any time to exercise any of the foregoing rights shall not be deemed
a waiver of any such right, the waiver of any such right with respect to
particular facts and circumstances shall not be deemed a waiver with respect
to any other facts and circumstances and each such right shall be deemed an
ongoing right that may be asserted at any time and from time to time.

  



  

The capitalized terms used in this _Annex I_ shall have the meanings set
forth in the agreement to which it is annexed.
