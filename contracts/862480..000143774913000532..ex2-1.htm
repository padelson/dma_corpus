transfer agent of the surrender of such Book-Entry Shares on a book-entry
account statement), duly completed and validly executed in accordance with the
instructions thereto and such other documents as the Paying Agent may
reasonably require (a "Proper Delivery"), the holder of such Certificate or
Book-Entry Share shall be entitled to receive in exchange therefor by check or

Share formerly represented by such Certificate or Book-Entry Share. Such
payment of the Merger Consideration shall be sent to such holder by the Paying
Agent as soon as practicable after the date of the Proper Delivery, and any
Certificate so surrendered shall forthwith be canceled. No interest will be
paid or accrued for the benefit of holders of Certificates or Book-Entry
Shares on the Merger Consideration payable in respect of Certificates or Book-
Entry Shares.

  

  

 

 

 

  

 

13  

  

 

 

 

  

  

(c) If payment of the Merger Consideration is to be made to a Person other
than the Person in whose name the surrendered Certificate or Book-Entry Share
is registered, it shall be a condition of payment that such Certificate so
surrendered shall be properly endorsed or shall be otherwise in proper form
for transfer or such Book-Entry Share shall be properly transferred and that
the Person requesting such payment shall have paid any transfer and other
Taxes required by reason of the payment of the Merger Consideration to a
Person other than the registered holder of the Certificate or Book-Entry Share
surrendered or shall have established to the satisfaction of Parent that such
tax either has been paid or is not applicable.

  

  

(d) If any Certificate shall have been lost, stolen or destroyed, upon the
holder's compliance with the replacement requirements established by the
Paying Agent, including, if necessary, the posting by such Person of a bond in
customary amount as indemnity against any claim that may be made against it or
the Surviving Corporation with respect to such Certificate, the Paying Agent
will deliver in exchange for such lost, stolen or destroyed Certificate the
Merger Consideration payable in respect thereof pursuant to this Agreement.

  

  

(e) Until surrendered as contemplated by this Section 3.3, each Certificate or
Book-Entry Share shall be deemed at any time after the Effective Time to
represent only the right to receive the Merger Consideration payable in
respect of Shares theretofore represented by such Certificate or Book-Entry
Share, as applicable, pursuant to Section 3.1.

  

  

(f) Prior to the Effective Time, Parent and the Company shall cooperate to
establish procedures with the Paying Agent and the Depository Trust Company
("DTC") to ensure that (i) if the Closing occurs at or prior to 11:30 a.m.
(New York time) on the Closing Date, the Paying Agent will transmit to DTC or
its nominees on the Closing Date an amount in cash in immediately available
funds equal to the number of Shares held of record by DTC or such nominee
immediately prior to the Effective Time multiplied by the Merger Consideration
(such amount, the "DTC Payment"), and (ii) if the Closing occurs after 11:30
a.m. (New York time) on the Closing Date, the Paying Agent will transmit to
DTC or its nominee on the first business day after the Closing Date an amount
in cash in immediately available funds equal to the DTC Payment.

  

  

 

 

 

  

 

14  

  

 

 

 

  

  

(g) All cash paid upon the surrender for exchange of Certificates or Book-
Entry Shares in accordance with the terms of this Article III shall be deemed
to have been paid in full satisfaction of all rights pertaining to the Shares
formerly represented by such Certificates or Book-Entry Shares. At the
Effective Time, the stock transfer books of the Company shall be closed and
there shall be no further registration of transfers on the stock transfer
books of the Surviving Corporation of the Shares that were outstanding
immediately prior to the Effective Time. If, after the Effective Time,
Certificates are presented to the Surviving Corporation or the Paying Agent
for transfer or transfer is sought for Book-Entry Shares, such Certificates or
Book-Entry Shares shall be canceled and exchanged as provided in this Article
III, subject to applicable Law in the case of Dissenting Shares.

  

  

(h) The Paying Agent shall invest any cash included in the Payment Fund as
directed by Parent, on a daily basis; provided, that any investment of such
cash shall in all events be in short-term obligations of the United States of
America with maturities of no more than three months or guaranteed by the
United States of America and backed by the full faith and credit of the United
States of America or in commercial paper obligations rated A-1 or P-1 or
better by Moody's Investors Service, Inc. or Standard and Poor's Corporation,
respectively. If for any reason (including investment losses) the cash in the
Payment Fund is insufficient to fully satisfy all of the payment obligations
to be made in cash by the Paying Agent hereunder (but subject to Section 3.4),
Parent shall promptly deposit cash into the Payment Fund in an amount which is
equal to the deficiency in the amount of cash required to fully satisfy such
cash payment obligations. Any interest and other income resulting from such
investments shall be payable to the Surviving Corporation.

  

  

(i) At any time following the date that is nine months after the Effective
Time, the Surviving Corporation shall be entitled to require the Paying Agent
to deliver to it any funds (including any interest received with respect
thereto) which have been made available to the Paying Agent and which have not
been disbursed to holders of Certificates or Book-Entry Shares, and thereafter
such holders shall be entitled to look to Parent and the Surviving Corporation
(subject to abandoned property, escheat or other similar laws) only as general
creditors thereof with respect to the Merger Consideration payable upon due
surrender of their Certificate or Book-Entry Shares, without any interest
thereon. The Surviving Corporation shall pay all charges and expenses,
including those of the Paying Agent, in connection with the exchange of Shares
for the Merger Consideration.

  

  

SECTION 3.4 Withholding Rights. Parent, the Surviving Corporation or the
Paying Agent shall be entitled to deduct and withhold from the consideration
otherwise payable to any holder of Shares, Company Stock Options or otherwise
pursuant to this Agreement such amounts as Parent, the Surviving Corporation
or the Paying Agent is required to deduct and withhold with respect to the
making of such payment under the Code, or any provision of state, local or
foreign tax Law. To the extent that amounts are so withheld and paid over to
the appropriate taxing authority by Parent, the Surviving Corporation or the
Paying Agent, such withheld amounts shall be treated for all purposes of this
Agreement as having been paid to the Person in respect of which such deduction
and withholding was made.

  

  

 

 

 

  

 

15  

  

 

 

 

  

  

SECTION 3.5 Dissenting Shares. Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to
the contrary, Shares issued and outstanding immediately prior to the Effective
Time that are held by any holder who has not voted in favor of the Merger and
who is entitled to demand and properly demands appraisal of such Shares
pursuant to Section 262 of the DGCL ("Dissenting Shares") shall not be
converted into the right to receive the Merger Consideration, unless and until
such holder shall have failed to perfect, or shall have effectively withdrawn
or lost, such holder's right to appraisal under the DGCL. Dissenting Shares
shall be treated in accordance with Section 262 of the DGCL. If any such
holder fails to perfect or withdraws or loses any such right to appraisal,
each such Share of such holder shall thereupon be converted into and become
exchangeable only for the right to receive, as of the later of the Effective
Time and the time that such right to appraisal has been irrevocably lost,
withdrawn or expired, the Merger Consideration in accordance with Section
3.1(a). The Company shall serve prompt notice to Parent of any demands
received by the Company for appraisal of any Shares, any attempted withdrawals
of such demands, and any other instruments served pursuant to applicable Law
that are received by the Company relating to stockholders' rights of
appraisal. Parent shall have the right to direct all negotiations and
proceedings with respect to demand for appraisal under the DGCL, and the
Company shall have the right to participate in all negotiations and
proceedings with respect to such demands. The Company shall not, without the
prior consent of Parent, make any payment with respect to, or compromise,
offer to settle or settle, any such demands.

filed or otherwise furnished or transmitted since January 1, 2010 and
subsequent to the date hereof, collectively, the "Company SEC Documents") and
(ii) as of their respective dates, or, if amended, as of the date of the last

filed with or otherwise transmitted to the SEC subsequent to the date hereof
will not, contain any untrue statement of a material fact or omit to state a

circumstances under which they were made, not misleading.

  

  

(b) The audited consolidated financial statements of the Company (including
any related notes thereto) included in the Company's Annual Report on Form
10-K for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2011 filed with the SEC have been

20  

  

 

 

 

  

  

(c) The Company maintains disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in
Rule 13a-15(e) under the Exchange Act) designed to ensure that material

to the chief executive officer and the chief financial officer of the Company
by others within those entities. The Company maintains internal control over
financial reporting (as defined in Rule 13a-15(f) under the Exchange Act)
designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of
financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external
purposes in accordance with GAAP. The Company has disclosed, based on the most

officer prior to the date hereof, to the Company's auditors and the audit
committee of the Company Board (A) any significant deficiencies in the design
or operation of its internal controls over financial reporting that are
reasonably likely to adversely affect the Company's ability to record,
process, summarize and report financial information and has identified for the
Company's auditors and audit committee of the Company Board any material
weaknesses in its internal controls over financial reporting and (B) any
fraud, whether or not material, that involves management or other employees
who have a significant role in the Company's internal controls over financial
reporting. Since January 1, 2010, no material complaints from any source
regarding accounting, internal accounting controls or auditing matters, and no

governance rules and regulations of the NASDAQ, except for any non-compliance
that would not have, individually or in the aggregate, a Company Material
Adverse Effect. Except as permitted by the Exchange Act, including Sections
13(k)(2) and (3) or rules of the SEC, since January 1, 2010, neither the
Company nor any of its Subsidiaries has extended, arranged or modified (in any
material way) any extensions of credit in the form of a personal loan to any
executive officer (as defined in Rule 3b-7 under the Exchange Act) or director
of the Company.

  

  

(f) The value of the Company's and its Subsidiaries' inventory as reflected in

21  

  

 

 

 

  

  

SECTION 4.7 No Undisclosed Liabilities. Except as set forth in Section 4.7 of
the Company Disclosure Letter, neither the Company nor any of its Subsidiaries
has any material Liabilities other than Liabilities (a) reflected or reserved
against in the Balance Sheet, or (b) incurred in the ordinary course of
business since September 30, 2012, that would not, individually or in the
aggregate, have a Company Material Adverse Effect, except those liabilities

materially higher than those reflected or reserved against in Note K of the
consolidated financial statements of the Company for the year ended December
31, 2011 and the footnotes thereto set forth in the Company's Annual Report on

SECTION 4.8 Certain Information. The proxy statement to be sent to the
stockholders of the Company in connection with the Company Stockholder Meeting
(such proxy statement, as amended or supplemented, the "Company Proxy
Statement") will not at the time such document is first mailed to the
Company's stockholders and at the time of the Company Stockholder Meeting,
contain any untrue statement of a material fact or omit to state any material
fact required to be stated therein or necessary in order to make the
statements therein, in the light of the circumstances under which they are
made, not misleading. The Company Proxy Statement will comply in all material
respects with the requirements of the Exchange Act and the rules and
regulations promulgated thereunder. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Company
makes no representation or warranty with respect to any information supplied
by Parent or Merger Sub or any of their respective Representatives for
inclusion or incorporation by reference in the Company Proxy Statement.

  

  

SECTION 4.9 Absence of Certain Changes or Events. Since the date of the

(b) any declaration, setting aside or payment of any dividend or other
distribution with respect to any shares of capital stock of the Company;

  

  

(c) any amendment of any material term of any outstanding security of the
Company or any of its Subsidiaries; or

GAAP or regulatory accounting principles.

  

  

SECTION 4.10 Litigation. Except as set forth in Section 4.10 of the Company
Disclosure Letter, as of the date of this Agreement, there are no Actions
pending or, to the knowledge of the Company, threatened against the Company,
any of its Subsidiaries or any of their respective properties by or before any
Governmental Entity which, individually or in the aggregate, would have a
Company Material Adverse Effect. Neither the Company nor any of its
Subsidiaries is subject to any outstanding Order which, individually or in the
aggregate, has had a Company Material Adverse Effect or would prevent,
materially delay or materially impair the consummation of the Merger or the
other transactions contemplated hereby.

  

  

 

 

 

  

 

22  

  

 

 

 

  

  

SECTION 4.11 Compliance with Laws. Except with respect to the matters covered
by Sections 4.6, 4.8, 4.12, 4.14, 4.15, 4.21 and 4.22, the Company and each of
its Subsidiaries are in compliance with all Laws applicable to them or by
which any of their respective properties are bound, except where any non-
compliance would not, individually or in the aggregate, have a Company
Material Adverse Effect. Except for notices relating to a noncompliance that
has not had a Company Material Adverse Effect, since January 1, 2010, the
Company has not received any notice from a Governmental Entity stating that
the Company or any of its Subsidiaries are not in compliance with any such
Law. Except with respect to the matters covered by Section 4.14, the Company
and its Subsidiaries have in effect all permits, licenses, registrations,
exemptions, authorizations, franchises, variances, orders and approvals of all
Governmental Entities (collectively, "Permits") necessary for them to own,
lease or operate their properties and to carry on their businesses as now
conducted, except for any Permits the absence of which would not, individually
or in the aggregate, have a Company Material Adverse Effect. All Permits are
in full force and effect, except where the failure to be in full force and
effect would not, individually or in the aggregate, have a Company Material
Adverse Effect.

not, under which any current and former director, officer, employee or
independent contractor of the Company or its Subsidiaries has any present or
future right to benefits or the Company or its Subsidiaries has had or has any
present or future liability. All such plans, agreements, programs, policies
and arrangements shall be collectively referred to as the "Company Plans."
With respect to each Company Plan, the Company has furnished or made available
to Parent a current, accurate and complete copy thereof including all
amendments and attachments thereto (or, if a plan is not written, an accurate

in accordance with its terms and in compliance with the applicable provisions
of ERISA and the Code, and no prohibited transaction, as described in Section

Letter, each Company Plan intended to be qualified under Section 401(a) of the
Code has received a favorable determination, advisory and/or opinion letter,
as applicable, from the IRS that it is so qualified (or the deadline for
obtaining such a letter has not expired as of the date of this Agreement) and
nothing has occurred since the date of such letter that would reasonably be
expected to cause the loss of such qualified status of such Company Plan;

  

  

(iii) there is no Action (including any investigation, audit or other
administrative proceeding) by the Department of Labor, the Pension Benefit
Guaranty Corporation, the IRS or any other Governmental Entity or by any plan
participant or beneficiary pending, or to the knowledge of the Company,
threatened, relating to the Company Plans, any fiduciaries thereof with

Letter, none of the Company Plans provides for payment of a benefit, the
increase of a benefit amount, the payment of a contingent benefit or the
acceleration of the payment or vesting of a benefit determined or occasioned,
in whole or in part, by reason of the execution of this Agreement or the
consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby, and, for the avoidance
of doubt, the execution, delivery of and performance by the Company of its

that as a result of the execution of this Agreement, stockholder approval of
this Agreement, or the transactions contemplated by this Agreement (whether
alone or in combination with any subsequent event(s)): (A) could entitle any
current or former director, officer, employee or independent contractor of the
Company or any of its Subsidiaries to severance or any similar payment or any
increase therein upon any termination of employment or service after the date
of this Agreement, (B) will result in the acceleration of the time of payment
or vesting or result in any payment or funding (through a grantor trust or
otherwise) of compensation or benefits under, or increase the amount payable
or result in any other material obligation pursuant to, any of the Company
Plans, (C) will limit or restrict the right of the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries to merge, amend or terminate any of the Company Plans or (D)
result in payments under any of the Company Plans which would not be
deductible under Section 162(m) of the Code;

  

  

(xi) neither the Company nor any of its Subsidiaries has any liability to any
current or former director, officer, employee or independent contractor to
provide post-employment or post-retirement life insurance, health, medical or
other welfare benefits either to them or beneficiaries or dependents thereof,

(xii) each Company Plan that is a "nonqualified deferred compensation plan"
within the meaning of Sections 409A(d)(1) or 457A of the Code subject to
Sections 409A or 457A of the Code and each award thereunder is in material
compliance (in operation and in form) with Sections 409A and 457A of the Code,
respectively, and no such plan or any awards thereunder would subject any
service provider of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries to taxes pursuant

any such plan or holding of any award thereunder; and

execution of this Agreement (the "Parent Disclosure Letter") (it being agreed
that disclosure of any item in any section or subsection of the Parent
Disclosure Letter shall be deemed disclosure with respect to any other section
or subsection to which the relevance of such item is reasonably apparent),
Parent and the Merger Sub, jointly and severally, represent and warrant to the
Company as follows:

organization, (ii) has all requisite corporate or similar power and authority
to own, lease and operate its properties and assets and to carry on its
business as now being conducted, and (iii) is duly qualified or licensed to do
business and is in good standing (with respect to jurisdictions that recognize
such concept) in each jurisdiction in which the nature of its business or the
ownership, leasing or operation of its assets or properties makes such
qualification or licensing necessary, except, with respect to clauses (ii) and
(iii), for any such failures to have such power and authority or to be so
qualified or licensed or in good standing as would not, individually or in the
aggregate, have a Parent Material Adverse Effect.

  

  

(b) Parent has previously furnished to the Company a true and complete copy of
the organizational documents of each of Parent and Merger Sub, in each case as
amended to the date of this Agreement, and each as so delivered is in full

transactions contemplated hereby, subject to the filing of the Certificate of
Merger with the Delaware Secretary of State as required by the DGCL. This
Agreement has been duly executed and delivered by Parent and Merger Sub and,
assuming the due authorization, execution and delivery by the Company,
constitutes a valid and binding obligation of the Parent and Merger Sub,
enforceable against each of them in accordance with its terms (except to the
extent that enforceability may be limited by applicable bankruptcy,
insolvency, moratorium, reorganization or similar Laws affecting the
enforcement of creditors' rights generally or by general principles of
equity).

incorporation or bylaws of Parent or Merger Sub, (ii) assuming that all
consents, approvals and authorizations contemplated by clauses (i) through (v)

clauses have been made, conflict with or violate any Law or Order applicable
to Parent or Merger Sub or by which any of their respective properties are
bound, or (iii) result in any breach or violation of, or constitute a default
(or an event which with notice or lapse of time or both would become a
default) under, or result in the termination of, or accelerate the performance
required by, or result in a right of termination or acceleration under, any
contract to which Parent or Merger Sub is a party or by which Parent or Merger
Sub or any of their respective properties or assets are bound, except, in the
case of clauses (ii) and (iii), for any such conflict, breach, violation,
default, termination, or acceleration that would not, individually or in the
aggregate, have a Parent Material Adverse Effect.

  

  

(b) No Consent of any Governmental Entity is required on the part of Parent or
Merger Sub or any of their Affiliates in connection with the execution,
delivery and performance of this Agreement by Parent and Merger Sub, and the
consummation by Parent and Merger Sub of the Merger and the other transactions
contemplated hereby, except for (i) such filings and approvals as may be
required under state takeover laws and any federal or state securities Laws,

not, individually or in the aggregate, have a Parent Material Adverse Effect.

supplied by Parent, Merger Sub or their respective officers, directors,
representatives, agents or employees for inclusion or incorporation by
reference in the Company Proxy Statement will, at the date it is first mailed
to the stockholders of the Company and at the time of the Company Stockholder
Meeting, contain any untrue statement of a material fact or omit to state any
material fact required to be stated therein or necessary in order to make the
statements therein, in the light of the circumstances under which they are
made, not misleading. Notwithstanding the foregoing, Parent and Merger Sub
make no representation or warranty with respect to any information supplied by
the Company or any of its Representatives for inclusion or incorporation by
reference in the Company Proxy Statement.

sufficient cash, cash equivalents, available unconditional lines of credit,
marketable securities or other sources of immediately available funds in each
case that are readily convertible to U.S. dollars and deployable by the Parent
and Merger Sub without any legal or other condition or restriction, to
consummate the Merger and the other transactions contemplated hereby,
including payment of all amounts required to be paid pursuant to Article III,
and to pay all related fees and expenses. Without limiting the foregoing, any
such amounts contemplated to be paid by Parent and Merger Sub hereunder may be
funded by Parent and its Subsidiaries, and their existing lines of credit.

obligations under this Agreement and any other agreement or instrument to be

obligations hereunder or thereunder (assuming for purposes hereof that (i)
such performance were to occur on the date hereof or any other date on or
prior to the Termination Date and (ii) the Company has performed all
obligations required of it hereunder), the consummation of the Merger and the
other transactions contemplated hereby, and the payment of all amounts
required to be paid pursuant to Article III or otherwise in respect of any

its Subsidiaries or Affiliates to fund any portion of the Merger
Consideration, or assume any liability, of the Parent, Merger Sub, any of
their respective Subsidiaries or any creditor or other counterparty of any
thereof for the benefit of Parent, Merger Sub, or any of their respective
Subsidiaries, which shall include, without limitation, any requirement to
cause the Company or any of its Subsidiaries or Affiliates to distribute or
sell any assets for the purpose of financing the Merger Consideration (or any

or any creditor or other counterparty of, Parent, Merger Sub or any of their
respective Subsidiaries for the benefit of Parent, Merger Sub, or any of their
respective Subsidiaries (any of the foregoing being referred to herein as a
"Seller Assumption Event"). Without limiting the foregoing, Credit
Arrangements, the proceeds of which are used solely to refinance the Company's
existing financing arrangements and to provide working capital for the
Surviving Corporation and its subsidiaries after the Effective Time, shall not
constitute a Seller Assumption Event.

class or series of capital stock of Parent is necessary to approve this

SECTION 6.4 Acquisition Proposals.

  

  

(a) Except as set forth in this Section 6.4, the Company agrees that, during
the period commencing with the execution and delivery of this Agreement and
continuing until the earlier to occur of the termination of this Agreement
pursuant to Section 8.1 hereof and the Company Stockholder Approval, neither
it nor any of its Subsidiaries shall, and it shall direct its and their
respective Representatives not to, directly or indirectly, (i) initiate,
solicit or knowingly encourage (including by providing information) any
inquiries, proposals or offers with respect to, or the making or completion
of, an Acquisition Proposal, (ii) engage or participate in any negotiations or
discussions (other than to state that they are not permitted to have
discussions) concerning, or provide or cause to be provided any non-public
information or data relating to the Company or any of its Subsidiaries or
provide any Person access to the business, properties, assets, books, records
or any personnel of the Company or its Subsidiaries in connection with, an
Acquisition Proposal, (iii) approve, endorse or recommend any Acquisition
Proposal, (iv) approve, endorse or recommend, or execute or enter into any
letter of intent, agreement in principle, merger agreement, acquisition
agreement or other similar agreement relating to an Acquisition Proposal or
(v) authorize, commit or agree to do any of the foregoing; provided, however,
it is understood and agreed that any determination or action by the Company
Board permitted under Section 6.4(b) or (c) or Section 8.1(c)(ii) shall not be
deemed to be a breach of this Section 6.4(a). The Company agrees that it will
immediately cease and cause to be terminated any existing activities,
discussions or negotiations with any Persons conducted heretofore with respect
to any Acquisition Proposal.

  

  

(b) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in Section 6.4(a), at any time
prior to the Company Stockholder Approval, the Company may, in response to an
unsolicited bona fide written Acquisition Proposal that did not result from a
breach of Section 6.4(a) and that the Company Board determines in good faith
constitutes or may reasonably be expected to lead to a Superior Proposal, (i)
furnish information with respect to the Company and its Subsidiaries, and
provide access to the business, properties, assets, books, records and
personnel of the Company and its Subsidiaries to the same extent provided to
Parent, its Affiliates and their respective Representatives, to the Person
making such Acquisition Proposal pursuant to a customary confidentiality
agreement on terms substantially similar to those contained in the
Confidentiality Agreement (except for such changes specifically necessary in
order for the Company to be able to comply with its obligations under this
Agreement) and (ii) participate in discussions or negotiations with such
Person and its Representatives regarding such Acquisition Proposal; provided,
however, that the Company shall provide or make available to Parent any non-
public information concerning the Company or any of its Subsidiaries that is
provided to the Person making such Acquisition Proposal or its Representatives
which was not previously provided or made available to Parent.

  

  

 

 

 

  

 

43  

  

 

 

 

  

  

(c) Except as permitted by this Section 6.4(c), neither the Company Board nor
any committee thereof shall (i) withdraw, withhold, qualify or modify in a
manner adverse to Parent or Merger Sub, or publicly propose to withdraw,
withhold, qualify or modify in a manner adverse to Parent or Merger Sub, its
recommendation of this Agreement or the Merger or (ii) approve or recommend,
or publicly propose to approve or recommend, any Acquisition Proposal (any of
such actions, an "Adverse Recommendation Change"). Notwithstanding anything to
the contrary herein, at any time prior to the Company Stockholder Approval,
the Company Board or any committee thereof may (i) effect an Adverse
Recommendation Change as a result of (A) any Acquisition Proposal made after
the date hereof which the Company Board determined in compliance with this
Section 6.4(c) is a Superior Proposal or (B) new developments occurring after
the date of this Agreement, or (ii) terminate this Agreement pursuant to
Section 8.1(c)(ii); provided, that:

  

  

(i) the Company shall not be entitled to effect an Adverse Recommendation
Change unless (A) the Company Board determines in good faith, after
consultation with outside counsel that the failure to do so would be
inconsistent with the Company Board's exercise of its fiduciary duties under
applicable Law, and (B) the Company Board has given Parent at least three (3)
Business Days prior written notice of its intention to take such action and
all information required by Section 6.4(d) and Parent does not make, within
three (3) Business Days after receipt of such prior written notice (it being
understood and agreed that any change to the financial or other material terms
of any Acquisition Proposal that is the basis for an Adverse Recommendation
Change shall require an additional prior written notice to Parent and a new
three (3) Business Day period), a proposal that would, in the good faith
determination of the Company Board (after consultation with its outside
counsel and financial advisor), permit the Company Board not to effect a
Company Adverse Recommendation Change;

  

  

(ii) the Company shall not be entitled to terminate this Agreement pursuant
Section 8.1(c)(ii) unless (A) the Company Board determines in good faith
(after consultation with its outside counsel and financial advisor) (after
considering the terms of any proposal made by Parent as a result of
information the Company has provided in (B) below) that such third party
Superior Proposal would constitute a Superior Proposal, (B) the Company has
given Parent at least three (3) Business Days' prior written notice of its
intention to take such action (which prior written notice shall specify the
basis therefor and attach the most current version of any proposed agreement
relating to the transaction that constitutes such Superior Proposal, the
identity of the Person or group of Persons making such Superior Proposal and
any other material terms and conditions of such Superior Proposal), (C) Parent
does not make, within three (3) Business Days after receipt of the prior
written notice provided for in clause (A) of this sentence (it being
understood and agreed that any change to the financial or other material terms
of such Superior Proposal shall require an additional prior written notice to
Parent and a new three (3) Business Day period), a proposal that would, in the
good faith determination of the Company Board (after consultation with its
outside counsel and financial advisor), cause such Superior Proposal to no
longer constitute a Superior Proposal, and (D) before or concurrently with any
termination in accordance with this Section 6.4(c), the Company pays the
Termination Fee pursuant to Section 8.3(c); or

  

  

 

 

 

  

 

44  

  

 

 

 

  

  

(iii) in determining whether to make an Adverse Recommendation Change in
response to a Superior Proposal or to take such action pursuant to Section
8.1(c)(ii), the Company Board shall take into account any changes to the terms
of this Agreement proposed by Parent and any other information provided by
Parent in response to notices from the Company referred to in clauses (i) and
(ii) above.

  

  

(d) The Company promptly (and in any event within 24 hours) shall advise
Parent orally or in writing of (i) any written Acquisition Proposal, (ii) any
written request for non-public information relating to the Company or its
Subsidiaries, other than requests for information not reasonably expected to
be related to an Acquisition Proposal, and (iii) any written inquiry or
request for discussion or negotiation regarding an Acquisition Proposal,
including in each case the identity of the Person making any such Acquisition
Proposal, inquiry or request and the terms and conditions of any such
Acquisition Proposal, inquiry or request (including, if applicable, copies of
any written requests, proposals or offers, including proposed agreements) and
thereafter shall keep Parent informed, on a current basis, of the status and
terms of any Acquisition Proposal, inquiry or request (including any
amendments thereto) and the status of any such discussions or negotiations,
including any change in the Company's intentions as previously notified.

  

  

(e) The Company agrees that to the extent it releases or permits the release
of any Person from, or waives or permits the waiver of any provision of, any
confidentiality, "standstill," or similar agreement to which the Company or
any of its Subsidiaries is a party, the Confidentiality Agreement shall be
deemed to be amended to waive or release Parent and its Affiliates from any
equivalent restriction in the Confidentiality Agreement. The Company will
promptly request on or after the date hereof that each Person that has
executed a confidentiality agreement within 12 months prior to the date
hereof, in connection with its consideration of an Acquisition Proposal or
equity investment by such Person, to return or destroy all confidential
information heretofore furnished to such Person by or on behalf of the Company
or any of its Subsidiaries.

  

  

(f) Nothing set forth in this Agreement shall prevent the Company or the
Company Board from (i) taking and disclosing to its stockholders a position
contemplated by Rule 14e-2(a), Rule 14d-9 or Item 1012(a) of Regulation M-A
promulgated under the Exchange Act (or any similar communication to
shareholders in connection with the making or amendment of a tender offer or
exchange offer) or (ii) making any required disclosure to the Company's
stockholders if, in the good faith judgment of the Company Board, after
consultation with outside counsel, failure to disclose such information would
reasonably be expected to violate its obligations under applicable Law;
provided, however, that if such disclosure does not reaffirm the Company's
recommendation of this Agreement or the Merger or has the substantive effect
of withdrawing or adversely modifying the Company's recommendation of this
Agreement or the Merger, such disclosure shall be deemed to be an Adverse
Recommendation Change and Parent shall have the right to terminate this
Agreement as set forth in Section 8.1(d)(ii).

  

  

 

 

 

  

 

45  

  

 

 

 

  

  

SECTION 6.5 Stockholder Meeting; Proxy Material.

  

  

(a) The Company shall promptly following the date of this Agreement prepare
and file with the SEC the Company Proxy Statement and, after completion of the
review of the Company Proxy Statement by the SEC, cause the Company Proxy
Statement to be disseminated to the Company's stockholders as required by the
United States federal securities Laws and the rules and regulations of the SEC
promulgated thereunder (the "Federal Securities Laws"). Parent and Merger Sub
will furnish to the Company in writing, for inclusion in the Company Proxy
Statement, the information relating to them required by applicable Law
(including the Federal Securities Laws) to be set forth in the Company Proxy
Statement and otherwise cooperate with the Company in its efforts to prepare,
file and disseminate the Company Proxy Statement. The Company shall cause the
Company Proxy Statement to comply in all material respects with applicable Law
(including the Federal Securities Laws) and to satisfy all rules of the
NASDAQ. Each of Parent, Merger Sub and the Company agree to promptly correct
any information provided by it for use in the Company Proxy Statement which
shall have become false or misleading, and the Company further agrees to take
all steps necessary to cause the Company Proxy Statement as so corrected to be
filed with the SEC and to be disseminated to the Company's stockholders, in
each case, as and to the extent required by the Federal Securities Laws. The
Company shall use reasonable efforts to respond promptly to comments of the
SEC or its staff with respect to the Company Proxy Statement. If at any time
prior to the Company Stockholder Meeting there shall occur any event that is
required by applicable Law (including the Federal Securities Laws) to be set
forth in an amendment or supplement to the Company Proxy Statement, the
Company shall promptly prepare and mail to its stockholders such an amendment
or supplement. In addition, the Company agrees to provide Parent and Merger
Sub and their Representatives with copies of any written comments, inform them
of any oral comments that the Company or its Representatives may receive from
the SEC or its staff with respect to the Company Proxy Statement and any
request by the SEC for any amendment to the Company Proxy Statement or for
additional information, in each case promptly after receipt of such comments
or request. The Parties shall cooperate to provide responses to such comments
and the Company shall give Parent and Merger Sub a reasonable opportunity
under the circumstances to review and comment upon any proposed written or
oral responses to such comments and shall reasonably incorporate any comments
of Parent and Merger Sub and their Representatives. The Company shall provide
Parent and Merger Sub with copies of any written comments or responses
submitted by the Company in response thereto. The Company shall provide copies
of the proposed forms of the Company Proxy Statement (or any amendment or
supplement thereto) to Parent and Merger Sub and their Representatives within
a reasonable time under the circumstances prior to the dissemination or filing
thereof with the SEC for review and comment by Parent and its Representatives,
and shall reasonably incorporate any comments of the Parent and its
Representatives. The Company shall not mail any Company Proxy Statement, or
any amendment or supplement thereto, to which Parent reasonably objects in a
timely manner. Unless this Agreement is earlier terminated pursuant to Section
8.1 hereof, subject to the terms of Section 6.4(c) hereof, the Company shall
include in the Company Proxy Statement the recommendation of the Company
Board. The Company Proxy Statement shall also contain the opinion of Goldman,
Sachs and Co. described in Section 4.28 and a copy of Section 262 of the DGCL.

  

  

 

 

 

  

 

46  

  

 

 

 

  

  

(b) The Company shall as soon as practicable after completion of the review of
the Company Proxy Statement by the SEC, (x) establish a record date for and
give notice of a meeting of its stockholders, for the purpose of voting upon
the adoption of this Agreement (the "Company Stockholder Meeting"), and (y)
mail to the holders of the Shares as of the record date established for the
Company Stockholder Meeting the Company Proxy Statement. The Company shall
duly call, convene and hold the Company Stockholder Meeting as promptly as
reasonably practicable; provided, however, that in no event shall such meeting
be held later than 40 calendar days following the date the Company Proxy
Statement is mailed to the Company's stockholders and any adjournments of such
meeting shall require the prior written consent of the Parent (which shall not
be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed) other than in the case it is
required to allow reasonable additional time for the filing and mailing of any
supplemental or amended disclosure which is required by court order or under
applicable Law and for such supplemental or amended disclosure to be
disseminated and reviewed by the Company's stockholders prior to the Company
Stockholder Meeting. Once the Company has established a record date for the
Company Stockholder Meeting, the Company shall not change such record date or
establish a different record date for the Company Stockholder Meeting without
the prior written consent of Parent (which shall not be unreasonably withheld,
conditioned or delayed), unless required to do so by applicable Law or the
Company Bylaws. Unless the Company Board shall have effected an Adverse
Recommendation Change in compliance with Section 6.4 of this Agreement, the
Company shall use reasonable best efforts to solicit proxies in favor of the
adoption of this Agreement and shall ensure that all proxies solicited in
connection with the Company Stockholder Meeting are solicited in compliance
with all applicable Laws and all rules of the NASDAQ.

  

  

SECTION 6.6 Cooperation with Respect to Credit Arrangements. At the request of
Parent, the Company shall, and shall cause its Subsidiaries and
Representatives (including legal and accounting) to reasonably cooperate with
Parent and Merger Sub to take steps to maintain or refinance the Company's
existing financing arrangements (including obtaining consents) and assist in
setting up new credit arrangements for the Company to be effective as of or
after the Effective Time (collectively, the "Credit Arrangements"); provided,
however, that nothing herein shall require such cooperation to the extent it
would interfere unreasonably with the business or operations of the Company or
its Subsidiaries; provided further, that neither the Company nor any of its
Subsidiaries shall be required to commit to take any action prior to the
Effective Time that is not contingent upon the Closing (including the entry
into any agreement) or that would be effective prior to the Effective Time, or
relate to a Seller Assumption Event (including any such an event after the
Effective Time). For the avoidance of doubt, the Company's cooperation with
respect to Credit Arrangements that are intended for the purpose of financing
the business of the Surviving Corporation after the Effective Time (and not to
finance all or any portion of the Merger Consideration) shall not be deemed to
be for the benefit of Parent, Merger Sub or their Subsidiaries for purposes of
the definition of Seller Assumption Event, so long as (other than the issuance
of a guaranty by Parent or an Affiliate in support thereof) the credit parties
under the Credit Arrangements are limited to the Company and its Subsidiaries.
In addition, none of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries shall be required
to take any action that would subject it to actual or potential liability, to
bear any cost or expense or to pay any commitment or other similar fee (other
than reasonable out-of-pocket costs) or make any other payment or incur any
other liability or provide or agree to provide any indemnity in connection
with actions requested by Parent in connection with the Credit Arrangements,
prior to the Effective Time pursuant to this Section 6.6, or related to a
Seller Assumption Event (including any such event after the Effective Time).
Parent shall indemnify and hold harmless the Company, its Subsidiaries and the
Representatives from and against any and all liabilities, losses, damages,
claims, costs, expenses, interest, awards, judgments and penalties suffered or
incurred by them in connection with the arrangement of any new Credit
Arrangements and any information utilized in connection therewith (other than
historical information relating to the Company or its Subsidiaries or other
information furnished by or on behalf of the Company or its Subsidiaries).
Parent shall, promptly upon request by the Company, reimburse the Company for
all documented and reasonable out-of-pocket costs incurred by the Company or
its Subsidiaries in connection with this Section 6.6.

  

  

 

 

 

  

 

47  

  

 

 

 

  


 

  

SECTION 6.7 Access to Information; Confidentiality.

  

  

(a) From the date hereof to the Effective Time or the earlier termination of
this Agreement, upon reasonable prior written notice, the Company shall, and
shall use its reasonable best efforts to cause its Subsidiaries, officers,
directors and representatives to, afford to Parent and its authorized
representatives reasonable access during normal business hours, consistent
with applicable Law, to its officers, employees, properties, offices, other
facilities and books and records, and shall furnish Parent with all financial,
operating and other data and information as Parent shall reasonably request in
writing (it being agreed, however, that the foregoing shall not permit Parent
or its officers, employees or representatives to conduct any environmental
testing or sampling). Notwithstanding the foregoing, any such investigation or
consultation shall be conducted in such a manner as not to interfere with the
business or operations of the Company or its Subsidiaries or otherwise result
in any interference with the prompt and timely discharge by the employees of
the Company or its Subsidiaries of their normal duties. Neither the Company
nor any of its Subsidiaries shall be required to provide access to or to
disclose information where such access or disclosure would (i) breach any
agreement with any third-party, (ii) cause significant competitive harm if the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement were not consummated, (iii)
constitute a waiver of or jeopardize the attorney-client or other privilege
held by the Company, or (iv) otherwise violate any applicable Law.

  

  

(b) As soon as practicable after the date hereof, the Company shall provide to
Parent copies of all contracts relating to sponsorship arrangements (to the
extent not already provided).

  

  

(c) From and after the date hereof, the Company shall use its reasonable best
efforts to take actions reasonably requested by Parent to consummate as soon
as practicable each of the actions set forth in Section 6.7 of the Company
Disclosure Letter, which such actions shall include providing to Parent and
its Representatives all books and records of such Subsidiaries as well as
access to their Representatives. For the avoidance of doubt, Parent and Merger
Sub acknowledge and agree that the Company may, despite its use of its
reasonable best efforts to comply with its obligations in the preceding
sentence, not be successful in consummating any or all of the actions set
forth in Section 6.7 of the Company Disclosure Letter and that any such non-
success shall not constitute a breach of this Agreement, nor shall the success
of any or all of such actions be a condition to Closing.

  

  

 

 

 

  

 

48  

  

 

 

 

  

  

(d) Each of Parent and Merger Sub will hold and treat and will cause its
Representatives to hold and treat in confidence all documents and information
concerning the Company and its Subsidiaries furnished to Parent or Merger Sub
in connection with the transactions contemplated by this Agreement in
accordance with the Confidentiality Agreement, dated July 13, 2012, between
Parent and the Company (the "Confidentiality Agreement"), which
Confidentiality Agreement shall remain in full force and effect in accordance
with its terms.

  

  

SECTION 6.8 Further Action; Reasonable Best Efforts.

  

  

(a) Upon the terms and subject to the conditions of this Agreement, each of
the Parties shall use its reasonable best efforts to take, or cause to be
taken, all actions and to do, or cause to be done, and cooperate with each
other in order to do, all things necessary, proper or advisable under
applicable Law (including under any Antitrust Law) to consummate the Merger
and the other transactions contemplated by this Agreement at the earliest
practicable date, including using reasonable best efforts to: (i) cause the
preparation and filing of all forms, registrations and notices required to be
filed to consummate the Merger; (ii) execute and deliver any additional
instruments necessary to consummate the Merger; and (iii) obtain all material
approvals, Consents and Permits from any Governmental Entity or third party
necessary to consummate the Merger, except in the case of each of clauses (i)
through (iii), other than with respect to such actions relating to the
Antitrust Laws, which are dealt with in the subsections below. In furtherance
and not in limitation of the provisions of this Section 6.8(a), each of the
Parties, as applicable, agrees to prepare and file as promptly as practicable,
an appropriate filing of a Notification and Report Form pursuant to the HSR
Act and any filings required under Foreign Antitrust Laws. The Company shall
consult with Parent prior to seeking consents from third parties. Parent shall
pay all filing fees and other charges for the filings required pursuant to the
HSR Act and any other Antitrust Laws.

  

  

(b) If a Party receives a request for information or documentary material from
any Governmental Entity with respect to this Agreement or any of the
transactions contemplated hereby, including but not limited to a Second
Request for Information under the HSR Act, then such Party shall in good faith
make, or cause to be made, as soon as reasonably practicable and after
consultation with the other Party, a response which is, at a minimum, in
substantial compliance with such request.

  

  

(c) The Parties shall keep each other apprised of the status of matters
relating to the completion of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement
and work cooperatively in connection with obtaining the approvals of or
clearances from each applicable Governmental Entity, including:

  

  

 

 

 

  

 

49  

  

 

 

 

  

  

(i) cooperating with each other in connection with filings required to be made
by any Party under any Antitrust Law and liaising with each other in relation
to each step of the procedure before the relevant Governmental Entities and as
to the contents of all communications with such Governmental Entities. In
particular, to the extent permitted by Law or by a Governmental Entity, no
Party will make any notification in relation to the transactions contemplated
hereunder without first providing the other Party with a copy of such
notification in draft form and giving such other Party a reasonable
opportunity to discuss its content before it is filed with the relevant
Governmental Entities, and such first Party shall consider and take account of
all reasonable comments timely made by the other Party in this respect;

  

  

(ii) furnishing to the other Party all information within its possession that
is required for any application or other filing to be made by the other Party
pursuant to the applicable Law in connection with the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement;

  

  

(iii) promptly notifying each other of any communications from or with any
Governmental Entity with respect to the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement and ensuring to the extent permitted by Law or Governmental Entity
that each of the Parties is entitled to attend any meetings with or other
appearances before any Governmental Entity with respect to the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement;

  

  

(iv) consulting and cooperating with one another in connection with all
analyses, appearances, presentations, memoranda, briefs, arguments, opinions
and proposals made or submitted by or on behalf of any Party in connection
with proceedings under or relating to the Antitrust Laws; and

  

  

(v) without prejudice to any rights of the Parties hereunder, consulting and
cooperating in all respects with the other in defending all lawsuits and other
proceedings by or before any Governmental Entity challenging this Agreement or
the consummation of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement.

  

  

(d) In addition, each of the Parties shall use reasonable best efforts to
take, or cause to be taken, all other action and to do, or cause to be done,
all other things necessary, proper or advisable under all Antitrust Laws to
consummate the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, including (i)
using its reasonable best efforts to obtain the expiration of all waiting
periods and obtain all other approvals and any other consents required to be
obtained in order for the Parties to consummate the transactions contemplated
by this Agreement; and (ii) using reasonable best efforts to resolve any
objection asserted with respect to the transactions contemplated under this
Agreement under any Antitrust Law raised by any Governmental Entity that would
prevent, prohibit, restrict or delay the consummation of the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement.

  

  

(e) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary set forth in this Agreement,
Parent shall not be required to propose, negotiate, commit to, take or enter
into any actions, or take, offer to take or offer to commit to take any such
action which Parent determines in good faith would have a Company Material
Adverse Effect (for the avoidance of doubt, any of the foregoing if taken
pursuant to Antitrust Laws or their enforcement by any Government Entity shall
not be deemed to arise out of, be attributable to, or result from, the
performance of this Agreement or consummation of the transactions contemplated
hereby for the purposes of such determination) or a material adverse effect
(relative to the size of the proposed transaction) on Parent.

  

  

 

 

 

  

 

50  

  

 

 

 

  

  

(f) Notwithstanding the foregoing, commercially and/or competitively sensitive
information and materials of a Party will be provided to the other Party on an
outside counsel only basis while, to the extent feasible, making a version in
which the commercial and/or competitively sensitive information has been
redacted available to the other Party.

  

  

SECTION 6.9 Employment and Employee Benefits Matters; Other Plans.

  

  

(a) Without limiting any additional rights that any current or former employee
of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries (each, a "Company Employee") may
have under any Company Plan, except as otherwise agreed in writing between
Parent and a Company Employee, Parent shall cause the Surviving Corporation
and each of its Subsidiaries, for a period commencing at the Effective Time
and ending on the second anniversary thereof, to maintain the severance-
related provisions of Company Plans as of the date hereof (to the extent
disclosed in Section 4.12 (a) of the Company Disclosure Letter) and to provide
100% of the severance payments and benefits required thereunder to be provided
to any employees of the Company or its Subsidiaries who continue as employees
of the Surviving Corporation or its Subsidiaries after the Effective Time (the
"Continuing Employees") terminated during that two year period.

  

  

(b) Without limiting any additional rights that any Company Employee may have
under any Company Plan, except as otherwise agreed in writing between Parent
and a Company Employee, Parent shall cause the Surviving Corporation and each
of its Subsidiaries, for the period commencing at the Effective Time and
ending on the second anniversary thereof, to maintain for any Continuing
Employee (i) subject to Section 6.9(a) above, cash compensation levels (such
term to include salary, bonus opportunities, commissions and severance), and
(ii) benefits (including the costs thereof to Company Plan participants)
provided under Company Plans that, in the aggregate taking into account (i)
and (ii) are no less favorable than, the overall cash compensation levels and
benefits (including the costs thereof to Company Plan participants) maintained
for and provided to such Continuing Employees as of the date hereof (to the
extent disclosed in Section 4.12(a) of the Company Disclosure Letter);
provided, that this provision shall not restrict Parent or the Surviving
Corporation from terminating Continuing Employees so long as Parent or the
Surviving Corporation fully complies with any applicable severance obligations
to such Continuing Employees.

  

  

(c) As of and after the Effective Time, Parent will, or will cause the
Surviving Corporation to, give Continuing Employees full credit for purposes
of eligibility, participation and vesting and benefit accruals (but not for
purposes of benefit accruals under any defined benefit pension plans), under
any employee compensation, incentive, and benefit (including vacation, but
excluding any equity incentive compensation) plans, programs, policies and
arrangements maintained for the benefit of Continuing Employees as of and
after the Effective Time by Parent, its Subsidiaries or the Surviving
Corporation for the Continuing Employees' service with the Company, its
Subsidiaries and their predecessor entities (each, a "Parent Plan") to the
same extent recognized by the Company immediately prior to the Effective Time
(but only to the extent such credit does not result in a duplication of
benefits for the Continuing Employees). With respect to each Parent Plan that
is a "welfare benefit plan" (as defined in Section 3(1) of ERISA), Parent and
its Subsidiaries shall (i) cause there to be waived any pre-existing condition
or eligibility limitations to the extent the Continuing Employees are covered
under similar plans maintained by the Company and its Subsidiaries immediately
prior to the Effective Time, and (ii) give effect, in determining any
deductible and maximum out-of-pocket limitations, to claims incurred and
amounts paid by, and amounts reimbursed to, Continuing Employees under similar
plans maintained by the Company and its Subsidiaries in the plan year in which
the Effective Time occurs.

  

  

 

 

 

  

 

51  

  

 

 

 

  

  

(d) From and after the Effective Time, except as otherwise agreed in writing
between Parent and a Continuing Employee or as otherwise provided in this
Agreement, the Surviving Corporation will honor, in accordance with its terms
the Company Plans as disclosed in Section 4.12(a) of the Company Disclosure
Letter, subject to Parent's ability to amend any provisions or terminate any
Company Plan consistent with the applicable Company Plan.

  

  

(e) Parent shall cause the Surviving Corporation and each of its Subsidiaries,
for a period commencing at the Effective Time and ending 90 days thereafter,
not to effectuate a "plant closing" or "mass layoff" as those terms are
defined in WARN affecting in whole or in part any site of employment,
facility, operating unit or Company Employee, and shall cause the Surviving
Corporation and each of its Subsidiaries not to take any such action after
such 90 day period without complying with all provisions of WARN, or any
similar provision of applicable foreign Law.

  

  

(f) With respect to any labor union, labor organization, works council, or
other employee representative body in place for employees of the Company or
any of its Subsidiaries, the Company shall use its reasonable best efforts to
take, or cause to be taken, all actions necessary and proper, as required by
applicable Law, contract, or collective bargaining agreement, and provide such
cooperation as Parent reasonably requests, to consummate the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement, including consultation with or notification to
the relevant labor union, labor organization, works council or employee
representative body.

  

  

(g) This Agreement shall inure exclusively to the benefit of and be binding
upon the Parties and their respective successors, assigns, executors and legal
representatives. Nothing in this Section 6.9, express or implied, shall (i) be
treated as an amendment or other modification of any Company Plan, (ii) limit
the right of Parent or the Surviving Corporation or any of its Subsidiaries to
amend, terminate or otherwise modify any Company Plan following the Closing
Date or terminate any employee, or (iii) confer upon any Person, whether or

SECTION 6.10 Takeover Laws. If any Takeover Law is or becomes applicable to
this Agreement, the Merger or any of the other transactions contemplated
hereby, each of the Company and Parent and their respective Boards of
Directors shall take all action necessary to (a) ensure that the Merger and

eliminate or minimize the effect of such Takeover Law on this Agreement, the
Merger and the other transactions contemplated hereby.

SECTION 6.12 Notification of Certain Matters.

  

  

(a) The Company and Parent shall promptly notify each other of (a) any notice
or other communication received by such Party from any Governmental Entity in
connection with the Merger and the other transactions contemplated hereby or
from any Person alleging that the consent of such Person is or may be required
in connection with the Merger and the other transactions contemplated hereby,
(b) any Action commenced or, to such Party's knowledge, threatened against,
relating to or involving or otherwise affecting such Party or any of its
Subsidiaries which relate to the Merger or the other transactions contemplated
hereby, or (c) the discovery of any fact or circumstance that, or the
occurrence or non-occurrence of any event the occurrence or non-occurrence of
which, would cause or result in any of the conditions to the Merger set forth
in Article VII not being satisfied or satisfaction of those conditions being
materially delayed in violation of any provision of this Agreement; provided,
however, that the delivery of any notice pursuant to this Section 6.12 shall
not (i) cure any breach of, or non-compliance with, any other provision of
this Agreement or (ii) limit the remedies available to the Party receiving
such notice; provided further, that failure to give prompt notice pursuant to
clause (c) shall not constitute a failure of a condition to the Merger set
forth in Article VII except to the extent that the underlying fact or
circumstance not so notified would standing alone constitute such a failure.
The Parties agree and acknowledge that, except with respect to clause (c) of
the first sentence of this Section 6.12, the Company's compliance or failure
of compliance with this Section 6.12 shall not be taken into account for
purposes of determining whether the condition referred to in Section 7.1(b)

the Company threatened, against the Company and/or the members of the Company
Board prior to the Effective Time, the Company shall promptly notify Parent of
any such claim, Action or threat and shall keep Parent reasonably informed
with respect to the status thereof. The Company shall reasonably consult with
Parent with respect to the defense or settlement of any such claim or Action,
and no settlement thereof shall be agreed to without Parent's prior written
consent (which shall not be unreasonably withheld), except for any settlement
that does not include an admission of liability or guilt and is covered by the
Company's directors' and officers' insurance carrier, other than to the extent
of the retention.

SECTION 6.13 Indemnification, Exculpation and Insurance.

  

  

(a) Without limiting any additional rights that any employee may have under
any agreement or Company Plan, from the Effective Time through the sixth
anniversary of the date on which the Effective Time occurs, Parent shall, or
shall cause the Surviving Corporation to, indemnify and hold harmless each
present (as of the Effective Time) and former officer, director or employee of
the Company and its Subsidiaries (the "Indemnified Parties"), against all
claims, losses, liabilities, damages, judgments, inquiries, fines and
reasonable fees, costs and expenses, including attorneys' fees and
disbursements (collectively, "Costs"), incurred in connection with any Action,
whether civil, criminal, administrative or investigative, arising out of or
pertaining to (i) the fact that the Indemnified Party is or was an officer,
director, employee, fiduciary or agent of the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries, or (ii) matters existing or occurring at or prior to the
Effective Time (including this Agreement and the transactions and actions
contemplated hereby), whether asserted or claimed prior to, at or after the
Effective Time, to the fullest extent permitted under applicable Law and the
Company Charter and Company Bylaws as at the date hereof. In the event of any
such Action, (A) each Indemnified Party shall be entitled to advancement of
expenses incurred in the defense of any Action from Parent or the Surviving
Corporation to the fullest extent permitted under applicable Law and the
Company Charter and Company Bylaws as at the date hereof within 20 days of
receipt by Parent or the Surviving Corporation from the Indemnified Party of a
request therefor; provided, that any Person to whom expenses are advanced
provides an undertaking, if and only to the extent required by DGCL or the
Company Charter or Company Bylaws, to repay such advances if it is ultimately
determined that such Person is not entitled to indemnification, (B) neither
Parent nor the Surviving Corporation shall settle, compromise or consent to
the entry of any judgment in any proceeding or threatened action, suit,
proceeding, investigation or claim (and in which indemnification could be
sought by such Indemnified Party hereunder), unless such settlement,
compromise or consent includes an unconditional release of such Indemnified
Party from all liability arising out of such action, suit, proceeding,
investigation or claim or such Indemnified Party otherwise consents, and (C)
the Surviving Corporation shall cooperate in the defense of any such matter.

  

  

(b) Except as may be required by applicable Law, Parent and the Company agree
that all rights to indemnification and exculpation from liabilities for acts
or omissions occurring at or prior to the Effective Time and rights to
advancement of expenses relating thereto now existing in favor of any
Indemnified Party as provided in the certificate of incorporation or bylaws
(or comparable organizational documents) of the Company and its Subsidiaries
or in any indemnification agreement between such Indemnified Party and the
Company or any of its Subsidiaries shall survive the Merger and continue in
full force and effect, and shall not be amended, repealed or otherwise
modified in any manner that would adversely affect any right thereunder of any
such Indemnified Party.

  

  

 

 

 

  

 

54  

  

 

 

 

  

  

(c) For a period of six years from the Effective Time, Parent shall either
cause to be maintained in effect the current policies of directors' and
officers' liability insurance and fiduciary liability insurance maintained by
the Company and its Subsidiaries or cause to be provided substitute policies
or purchase or cause the Surviving Corporation to purchase, a "tail policy,"
in either case of at least the same coverage and amounts containing terms and
conditions that are not less advantageous in the aggregate than such policy
with respect to matters arising on or before the Effective Time; provided,
however, that after the Effective Time, Parent shall not be required to pay
with respect to such insurance policies in respect of any one policy year
annual premiums in excess of 200% of the last annual premium paid by the
Company prior to the date hereof in respect of the coverage required to be
obtained pursuant hereto, but in such case shall purchase as much coverage as
reasonably practicable for such amount; provided further, that if the
Surviving Corporation purchases a "tail policy" and the coverage thereunder
costs more than 200% of such last annual premium, the Surviving Corporation
shall purchase the maximum amount of coverage that can be obtained for 200% of
such last annual premium. At the Company's option, the Company may purchase,
prior to the Effective Time, a six-year, non-cancellable, irrevocable, prepaid
"tail policy" on terms and conditions (in both amount and scope) providing
substantially equivalent benefits as the current policies of directors' and
officers' liability insurance and fiduciary liability insurance maintained by
the Company and its Subsidiaries with respect to matters arising on or before
the Effective Time, covering without limitation the transactions contemplated
hereby; provided, that such policy shall not cost more than 200% of the last
annual premium paid by the Company prior to the date hereof in respect of the
coverage required to be obtained pursuant hereto. If such tail prepaid policy
has been obtained by the Company prior to the Effective Time, Parent shall
cause such policy to be maintained in full force and effect, for its full
term, and cause all obligations thereunder to be honored by the Surviving
Corporation.

  

  

(d) Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, if any Action (whether
arising before, at or after the Effective Time) is instituted against any
Indemnified Party on or prior to the sixth anniversary of the Effective Time,
the provisions of this Section 6.13 shall continue in effect with respect to
such Action until the final disposition of such Action.

  

  

(e) The indemnification provided for herein shall not be deemed exclusive of
any other rights to which an Indemnified Party is entitled, whether pursuant
to Law, contract or otherwise. The provisions of this Section 6.13 shall
survive the consummation of the Merger and, notwithstanding any other
provision of this Agreement that may be to the contrary, expressly are
intended to benefit, and shall be enforceable by, each of the Indemnified
Parties and their respective heirs and legal representatives.

  

  

(f) In the event that the Surviving Corporation or Parent or any of their
respective successors or assigns (i) consolidates with or merges into any
other Person and shall not be the continuing or surviving corporation or
entity of such consolidation or merger or (ii) transfers or conveys all or a
majority of its properties and assets to any Person, then, and in each such
case, proper provision shall be made so that the successors and assigns of the
Surviving Corporation or Parent, as the case may be, shall succeed to the
obligations set forth in this Section 6.13.

derivative securities) pursuant to the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement by each individual who is a director or officer of the Company to be
exempt under Rule 16b-3 promulgated under the Exchange Act.

  

  

SECTION 6.15 Public Announcements. Each of Parent and Merger Sub, on the one
hand, and the Company, on the other hand, shall, to the extent reasonably
practicable, consult with each other before issuing, and give each other a
reasonable opportunity to review and comment upon, any press release, other
public statements or formal communication to employees (but only with respect
to such employee communications that are made before the Target Date) with
respect to this Agreement, the Merger and the other transactions contemplated
hereby and shall not issue any such press release or make any public
announcement or formal communication to employees (with respect to employee
communications made prior to the Target Date) prior to such consultation and
review, except as may be required by applicable Law, court process or by
obligations pursuant to any listing agreement with any national securities
exchange or national securities quotation system. Parent and the Company agree
that the press release announcing the execution and delivery of this Agreement
shall be a joint release of Parent and the Company. Notwithstanding the
foregoing, the Company shall not be required to consult with or obtain the
prior written consent of Parent and and/or Merger Sub in connection with any
press release, public announcement or formal communication to employees in
connection with any action made in compliance with Section 6.4.

  

  

SECTION 6.16 Obligations of Merger Sub; Voting of Shares. Parent shall take
all action necessary to cause Merger Sub and the Surviving Corporation to
perform their respective obligations under this Agreement and to cause Merger
Sub to consummate the Merger on the terms and conditions set forth in this
Agreement. Parent shall vote any Shares Beneficially Owned by it or any of its
Subsidiaries in favor of adoption of this Agreement.

  

  

SECTION 6.17 Financing of Merger. Parent and Merger Sub acknowledge and agree
that the obtaining of any financing, including the arranging of the Credit
Arrangements (or obtaining any consent or waiver thereunder), is not a
condition to Closing and reaffirm their obligation to consummate the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement irrespective and independently of
the availability of any financing.

  

  

SECTION 6.18 FIRPTA Certificate. Prior to the Closing Date, the Company shall
deliver to Parent (i) a certificate prepared in accordance with the
requirements set forth in Treasury Regulation Sections 1.1445-2(c)(3)(i) and
1.897-2(h) certifying that the Shares are not "United States real property
interests" under Section 897(c) of the Code, and (ii) a letter of notice to
the IRS prepared in accordance with the requirements set forth in Treasury
Regulation Section 1.897-2(h)(2).

  

  

 

 

 

  

 

56  

  

 

 

 

  

  

SECTION 6.19 Parent Commitment. Simultaneously with the execution and delivery
of this Agreement, Parent is providing to the Company an irrevocable standby
letter of credit which shall be deemed to be satisfactory to the Company (as
to form, substance and issuer and confirming bank) for an amount equal to the
Parent Liquidated Damages (the "Parent Commitment"). The Parent Commitment
shall be available to the Company as and to the extent set forth in Section
8.3(e). Parent may replace the original Parent Commitment with a substitute
Parent Commitment of the same amount, but only with the prior written consent
of the Company which consent shall be in the sole and absolute discretion of
the Company.

the Company be required to pay the Termination Fee on more than one occasion
and any expense amount actually paid by the Company to Parent pursuant to
Section 8.3(b) above shall be deducted from such fee paid pursuant to this
Section 8.3(c). Payment of the Termination Fee, if applicable, shall be made
by wire transfer of immediately available funds to the account or accounts
designated by Parent (A) on the earlier of the execution of a definitive
agreement with respect to, or consummation of, any transaction contemplated by
an Acquisition Proposal, as applicable, in the case of a Termination Fee
payable pursuant to Section 8.3(c)(i) or Section 8.3(c)(ii), or (B)
concurrently with the termination of this Agreement by the Company pursuant to
Section 8.1(c)(ii).

  

  

 

 

 

  

 

62  

  

 

 

 

  

  

(d) In the event that this Agreement has been terminated by Parent pursuant to
Section 8.1(d)(ii), then in such case the Company shall pay Parent an amount
equal to the sum of (i) the sum of the documented, reasonable out-of-pocket
expenses incurred by Parent and Merger Sub in connection with this Agreement
and the transactions contemplated hereby (including, any amounts paid in
relation to the filings and approvals contemplated by Section 6.8 and any
expenses incurred in connection with the filing, printing and mailing of the
Company Proxy Statement (including applicable SEC filing fees) and the
solicitation of the Company Stockholder Approval); provided, however, that the
amount payable by the Company pursuant to this subclause (i) of this Section
8.3(d) shall not exceed $500,000 under any circumstances; plus (ii) a
termination fee of $2,000,000 (the "Adverse Recommendation Fee"), it being
understood that (x) the Adverse Recommendation Fee and expenses paid pursuant
to this Section 8.3(d) shall be deducted from any Termination Fee payable
pursuant to Section 8.3(c) and (y) under no circumstances shall the Company be
required to pay expenses pursuant to both this Section 8.3(d) and Section
8.3(b). The Company shall pay any expenses owed pursuant to this Section
8.3(d) and the Adverse Recommendation Fee as promptly as practicable, but in
any event not later than the third Business Day, following Parent's
notification to the Company in writing of its termination of this Agreement
pursuant to Section 8.1(d)(ii), by wire transfer of immediately available
funds to the account or accounts designated by Parent.

  

  

(e) In the event this Agreement has been terminated by the Company pursuant to
Section 8.1(c)(i), then Parent shall pay to the Company, as liquidated
damages, an amount equal to $17,203,000 (the "Parent Liquidated Damages");
provided, that, at the time the Company has given Parent written notice of its
intent to terminate this Agreement pursuant to Section 8.1(c)(i) (to the
extent written notice is required to be delivered thereby), Parent has not
previously communicated to the Company in accordance with the terms of this
Agreement that it then has the right to terminate this Agreement pursuant to
either Section 8.1(b) or Section 8.1(d) with the understanding that Parent's
breach of its covenants and agreements shall not have been the primary cause
nor have been primarily responsible for any situation giving rise to its right
to terminate under Section 8.1(b) or Section 8.1(d). In such event, the
Company shall be entitled to draw upon the Parent Commitment for the full
amount of the Parent Liquidated Damages; provided, however, that in the case
of a termination pursuant to Section 8.1(c)(i)(1) the Company shall only be
entitled to draw upon the Parent Commitment on or after the Termination Date.
The Parties agree that the Parent Liquidated Damages constitute liquidated
damages and not a penalty. The Parties have computed, estimated and agreed
upon the Parent Liquidated Damages as an attempt to make a reasonable forecast
of probable actual loss because of the difficulty of estimating with exactness
the damages that would result in the event this Agreement is terminated in
such circumstances. The Parties agree that the Parent Liquidated Damages shall
be the sole and exclusive remedy available to the Company with respect to this
Agreement and the transactions contemplated hereby (including with respect to
any failure by Parent and Merger Sub to effect the Merger or any breach by
Parent or Merger Sub of this Agreement). Upon payment of the Parent Liquidated
Damages to the Company, Parent and its Subsidiaries, including Merger Sub, and
the Buyer Representatives shall have no further liability to the Company or
its Subsidiaries or their Representatives, relating to or arising out of this
Agreement or the transactions contemplated by this Agreement. Notwithstanding
anything to the contrary in this Agreement (other than in the immediately
following sentence), if Parent and Merger Sub fail to effect the Merger or
otherwise are in breach of this Agreement, then the aggregate liability of
Parent, Merger Sub and the Buyer Representatives shall in all cases be limited
to the amount of the Parent Liquidated Damages. Notwithstanding anything to
the contrary in this Agreement, including without limitation in the preceding
sentences, the obligations, liabilities, and agreements of Parent pursuant to
Section 6.13 shall not be restricted or otherwise limited to the Parent
Liquidated Damages. In no event shall the Parent Liquidated Damages be paid to
the Company on more than one occasion.

  

  

 

 

 

  

 

63  

  

 

 

 

  

  

(f) The Parties acknowledge that the agreements contained in this Section 8.3
are an integral part of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement and
constitute liquidated damages and not a penalty, and that, without these
agreements, the other Party would not enter into this Agreement.
Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this Section 8.3(f), in
the event that the Company or Parent, as applicable, fails promptly to pay any
amounts due pursuant to this Section 8.3 or the Company draws the funds under
the Parent Commitment in circumstances where the Company is not eligible to do
so under Section 8.3(e) above, and, in order to obtain such payment or
reimbursement of the Parent Commitment, as applicable, Parent or the Company,
as applicable, commences a suit that results in a judgment against the Company
or Parent, as applicable, for the amounts set forth in this Section 8.3 (or
the reimbursement of the Parent Commitment), the Company shall pay to Parent,
or Parent shall pay to the Company, as applicable, its costs and expenses
(including reasonable attorneys' fees and expenses) in connection with such
suit, together with interest on the amounts due pursuant to this Section 8.3
(whether in payment of any fee hereunder or reimbursement of the Parent
Commitment, as applicable) from the date such payment was required to be made
until the date of payment at the prime lending rate as published in The Wall
Street Journal in effect on the date such payment was required to be made.

  

  

SECTION 8.4 Amendment or Supplement. This Agreement may be amended, modified
or supplemented by the Parties by action taken or authorized by their
respective Boards of Directors (if required for Parent) at any time prior to
the Effective Time, whether before or after the Company Stockholder Approval
has been obtained; provided, however, that after the Company Stockholder
Approval has been obtained, no amendment may be made that pursuant to
applicable Law requires further approval or adoption by the stockholders of
the Company without such further approval or adoption. This Agreement may not
be amended, modified or supplemented in any manner, whether by course of
conduct or otherwise, except by an instrument in writing specifically
designated as an amendment hereto, signed on behalf of each of the Parties in
interest at the time of the amendment.

  

  

 

 

 

  

 

64  

  

 

 

 

  

  

SECTION 8.5 Extension of Time; Waiver. At any time prior to the Effective
Time, the Parties may, by action taken or authorized by their respective
Boards of Directors (if required for Parent), to the extent permitted by
applicable Law, (a) extend the time for the performance of any of the
obligations or acts of the other Party, (b) waive any inaccuracies in the
representations and warranties of the other Parties set forth in this
Agreement or any document delivered pursuant hereto, or (c) subject to
applicable Law, waive compliance with any of the agreements or conditions of
the other Parties contained herein; provided, however, that after the Company
Stockholder Approval has been obtained, no waiver may be made that pursuant to
applicable Law requires further approval or adoption by the stockholders of
the Company without such further approval or adoption. Any agreement on the
part of a Party to any such waiver shall be valid only if set forth in a
written instrument executed and delivered by a duly authorized officer on
behalf of such Party. No failure or delay of any Party in exercising any right
or remedy hereunder shall operate as a waiver thereof, nor shall any single or
partial exercise of any such right or power, or any abandonment or
discontinuance of steps to enforce such right or power, or any course of
conduct, preclude any other or further exercise thereof or the exercise of any
other right or power.

Section, Article, Exhibit or Schedule such reference shall be to a Section,
Article, Exhibit or Schedule of this Agreement unless otherwise indicated. The
table of contents and headings contained in this Agreement or in any Exhibit
or Schedule are for convenience of reference purposes only and shall not
affect in any way the meaning or interpretation of this Agreement. References
to a Person are also to its permitted successors and assigns. Any payment
hereunder required to be paid on a date that is not a Business Day shall be

SECTION 9.4 Entire Agreement. This Agreement (including the Exhibits hereto),
the Company Disclosure Letter, the Parent Disclosure Letter and the
Confidentiality Agreement constitute the entire agreement, and supersede all
prior written agreements, arrangements, communications and understandings and
all prior and contemporaneous oral agreements, arrangements, communications
and understandings among the Parties with respect to the subject matter hereof
and thereof.

  

  

SECTION 9.5 Parties in Interest.

  

  

(a) This Agreement is not intended to, and shall not, confer upon any other
Person other than the Parties and their respective successors and permitted
assigns any rights or remedies hereunder, except (a) from and after the
Effective Time, the Persons who are the intended beneficiaries of Parent's
agreements and obligations as set forth in Section 6.13 (each such Person a
"Third Party Beneficiary") shall each be deemed a third party beneficiary of
this Agreement with respect thereto, (b) from and after the Effective Time,
the rights of holders of Shares to receive the Merger Consideration set forth
in Article III, and (c) from and after the Effective Time, the rights of
holders of Company Stock Options to receive the payments contemplated by
Section 3.2 in accordance with the terms and conditions of this Agreement. The
rights under this Agreement, other than as specifically set forth in the first
sentence of this Section 9.5, may only be enforced by the Parties hereto.
Further, notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this Agreement
and for the sake of clarity, none of the limitations on damages recoverable by
the Company, as provided for in this Agreement, including in Section 8.3(e),
shall restrict or otherwise limit the damages recoverable by any Third Party
Beneficiary in respect of Parent's agreement and obligations, as set forth in
Section 6.13.

  

  

(b) The representations and warranties in this Agreement are the product of
negotiations among the Parties hereto and are for the sole benefit of the
Parties hereto. In some instances, the representations and warranties in this
Agreement may represent an allocation among the Parties hereto of risks
associated with particular matters regardless of the knowledge of any of the
Parties hereto. Consequently, Persons other than the Parties hereto may not
rely upon the representations and warranties in this Agreement or the
characterization of actual facts or circumstances as of the date of this
Agreement or as of any other date. Any inaccuracies in such representations
and warranties are subject to waiver by the Parties hereto in accordance with
Section 8.5 without notice or liability to any other Person.

  

  

SECTION 9.6 Governing Law. This Agreement and all disputes or controversies
arising out of or relating to this Agreement or the transactions contemplated
hereby shall be governed by, and construed in accordance with, the internal
laws of the State of Delaware, without regard to the laws of any other
jurisdiction that might be applied because of the conflicts of laws principles
of the State of Delaware.

  

  

 

 

 

  

 

67  

  

 

 

 

  

  

SECTION 9.7 Submission to Jurisdiction. Each of the Parties irrevocably agrees
that any legal action or proceeding arising out of or relating to this
Agreement brought by any Party (or a Third Party Beneficiary, as applicable)
against any other Party shall be brought and determined in the Court of
Chancery of the State of Delaware, provided that if jurisdiction is not then
available in the Court of Chancery of the State of Delaware, then any such
legal action or proceeding may be brought in any federal court located in the
State of Delaware or any other Delaware state court. Solely for purposes of an
action or proceeding brought by a Party (or a Third Party Beneficiary, as
applicable) arising out of or relating to this Agreement, each of the Parties
hereby irrevocably and unconditionally submits to, on behalf of themselves and
the Parent Commitment (to the extent applicable), the personal jurisdiction of
the aforesaid courts. Each of the Parties agrees not to commence any action,
suit or proceeding relating to this Agreement except in the courts described
above in Delaware, other than actions in any court of competent jurisdiction
to enforce any judgment, decree or award rendered by any such court in
Delaware as described herein. Each of the Parties further agrees that in any
proceeding brought by a Party (or a Third Party Beneficiary, as applicable)
against another Party arising out of or relating to this Agreement, service of
any legal documents upon a Party at the address set forth in Section 9.2 of
this Agreement or, for service to Parent by the Company (or a Third Party
Beneficiary, as applicable), upon service of such documents to National
Corporate Research, Ltd., 615 South DuPont Highway, Dover, DE, 19901 (with a
copy to the address set forth in Section 9.2 of this Agreement), whom Parent
hereby represents and warrants to the Company (and each Third Party
Beneficiary) is its agent for service of process in Delaware for actions
arising out of this Agreement and brought by the Company (or a Third Party
Beneficiary), shall constitute sufficient service of process to confer
personal jurisdiction over such Party in such Delaware court and the Parties
irrevocably waive and agree not to assert any argument that such service is
insufficient. Each of the Parties hereby irrevocably and unconditionally
waives, and agrees not to assert, by way of motion or as a defense,
counterclaim or otherwise, in any action or proceeding brought by a Party
arising out of or relating to this Agreement (including, without limitation,
Section 6.13) or the transactions contemplated hereby, (a) any claim that it
or the Parent Commitment is not subject to the personal jurisdiction of the
courts in Delaware as described herein for any reason, (b) that it is exempt
or immune from jurisdiction of any such court or from any legal process
commenced in such courts (whether through service of notice, attachment prior
to judgment, attachment in aid of execution of judgment, execution of judgment
or otherwise), and (c) that (i) the suit, action or proceeding in any such
court is brought in an inconvenient forum, (ii) the venue of such suit, action
or proceeding is improper, or (iii) this Agreement, or the subject matter
hereof, may not be enforced in or by such courts. Parent agrees that if the
Company (or a Third Party Beneficiary, as applicable) obtains against Parent a
judgment of a Delaware state or federal court relating to this Agreement or
any of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, the Company (or such
Third Party Beneficiary, as applicable) may bring an action with respect to
the recognition and enforcement thereof in a court in Korea, and Parent
irrevocably waives, and agrees not to assert, by way of motion, as a defense,
counterclaim or otherwise, any contention that such judgment of a Delaware
state or federal court may not be recognized and/or enforced in whole or in
part.

  

  

SECTION 9.8 Assignment; Successors. Neither this Agreement nor any of the
rights, interests or obligations under this Agreement may be assigned or
delegated, in whole or in part, by operation of law or otherwise, by any Party
without the prior written consent of the other Parties, and any such
assignment without such prior written consent shall be null and void. Subject
to the preceding sentence, this Agreement will be binding upon, inure to the
benefit of, and be enforceable by, the Parties and their respective successors
and assigns.

  

  

 

 

 

  

 

68  

  

 

 

 

  

  

SECTION 9.9 Enforcement. The Parties agree that irreparable damage would occur
in the event that any of the provisions of this Agreement were not performed
by the Company in accordance with their specific terms or were otherwise
breached. Accordingly, each of Parent and Merger Sub shall be entitled to
specific performance of the terms hereof, including an injunction or
injunctions to prevent breaches of this Agreement and to enforce specifically
the terms and provisions of this Agreement in the Court of Chancery of the
State of Delaware, provided that if jurisdiction is not then available in the
Court of Chancery of the State of Delaware, then in any federal court located
in the State of Delaware or any other Delaware state court, this being in
addition to any other remedy to which Parent or Merger Sub is entitled at law
or in equity. The Company hereby further waives for actions arising out of
this Agreement and brought by Parent or Merger Sub (a) any defense in any
action for specific performance that a remedy at law would be adequate and (b)
any requirement under any law to post security as a prerequisite to obtaining
equitable relief. The Parties acknowledge that the Company shall not be
entitled to an injunction or injunctions to prevent breaches of this Agreement
by Parent or Merger Sub or any remedy to enforce specifically the terms and
provisions of this Agreement and that the Company's sole and exclusive
remedies with respect to any such breach shall be the remedies set forth in
Section 8.3(e).

  

  

SECTION 9.10 Currency. All references to "dollars" or "$" or "US$" in this
Agreement refer to United States dollars, which is the currency used for all
purposes in this Agreement.

  

  

SECTION 9.11 Severability. Whenever possible, each provision or portion of any
provision of this Agreement shall be interpreted in such manner as to be
effective and valid under applicable Law, but if any provision or portion of
any provision of this Agreement is held to be invalid, illegal or
unenforceable in any respect under any applicable Law or rule in any
jurisdiction, such invalidity, illegality or unenforceability shall not affect
any other provision or portion of any provision in such jurisdiction, and this
Agreement shall be reformed, construed and enforced in such jurisdiction as if
such invalid, illegal or unenforceable provision or portion of any provision
had never been contained herein.

  

  

SECTION 9.12 Waiver of Jury Trial. EACH OF THE PARTIES TO THIS AGREEMENT
HEREBY IRREVOCABLY WAIVES ALL RIGHT TO A TRIAL BY JURY IN ANY ACTION,
PROCEEDING OR COUNTERCLAIM ARISING OUT OF OR RELATING TO THIS AGREEMENT OR THE
TRANSACTIONS CONTEMPLATED HEREBY.

  

  

SECTION 9.13 Counterparts. This Agreement may be executed in two or more
counterparts, all of which shall be considered one and the same instrument and
shall become effective when one or more counterparts have been signed by each
of the Parties and delivered to the other Party.

  

  

 

 

 

  

 

69  

  

 

 

 

  

  

SECTION 9.14 Facsimile Signature. This Agreement may be executed by facsimile
or pdf signature and a facsimile or pdf signature shall constitute an original
for all purposes.

  

  

SECTION 9.15 No Presumption Against Drafting Party. Each of Parent, Merger Sub
and the Company acknowledges that each Party to this Agreement has been
represented by counsel in connection with this Agreement and the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement. Accordingly, any rule of law or any legal
decision that would require interpretation of any claimed ambiguities in this
Agreement against the drafting Party has no application and is expressly
waived.

  

  

SECTION 9.16 Parent Guarantee. Parent agrees to take all action necessary to
cause Merger Sub or the Surviving Corporation, as applicable, to perform all
of its respective agreements, covenants and obligations under this Agreement.
Parent unconditionally guarantees to the Company the full and complete
performance by Merger Sub or the Surviving Corporation, as applicable, of its
respective obligations under this Agreement, including without limitation the
obligation to pay the Merger Consideration to the holder of Shares at the
Effective Time, and shall be liable for any breach of any representation,
warranty, covenant or obligation of Merger Sub or the Surviving Corporation,
as applicable, under this Agreement. This is a guarantee of payment and
performance and not of collectability. Parent hereby waives diligence,
presentment, demand of performance, filing of any claim, any right to require
any proceeding first against Merger Sub or the Surviving Corporation, as
applicable, protest, notice and all demands whatsoever in connection with the
performance of its obligations set forth in this Section 9.16; provided, that
this Section 9.16 shall not preclude Parent from asserting any defense that
Merger Sub or the Surviving Corporation would have had with respect to any
claims under this guarantee.
