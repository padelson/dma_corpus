exempt.

through (xv).

  

  

(c) Except as specifically set forth herein, nothing contained in this
Agreement shall give Buyer, directly or indirectly, the right to control or
direct the business and operations of the Acquired Companies prior to the
Closing. Prior to the Closing, Sellers and the Acquired Companies shall

control and supervision over the business and operations of the Acquired
Companies.

  

  

Section 5.2 Access to Information.

  

  

(a) During the Pre-Closing Period, Sellers shall, and shall cause the Acquired
Companies to, provide Buyer and its Representatives with reasonable access to
(i) all of the Acquired Companies' properties, assets, Contracts, books and
records and other documents and data; (ii) all senior management of the
Acquired Companies; and (iii) any other information concerning the business,
properties and personnel of the Acquired Companies as Buyer or any of its
Representatives may reasonably request. All access and investigation pursuant
to this Section 5.2(a) shall be (A) conducted during normal business hours
upon reasonable advance notice to Sellers, (B) conducted in such a manner as
not to interfere with the normal operations of the Acquired Companies, (C)
coordinated through a designee of U.S. Seller and (D) conducted at Buyer's
sole cost and expense, and Sellers shall have the right to have one or more of
their respective Representatives present at all times during any visits,
examinations, discussions or contacts contemplated by this Section 5.2(a).
Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained herein, during the Pre-
Closing Period, neither Seller nor any Acquired Company shall be required to
provide access or disclose information where such access or disclosure would,
in Sellers' reasonable judgment, (1) jeopardize the attorney-client privilege
or other immunity or protection from disclosure of Sellers or any Acquired
Company, (2) conflict with any (x) Law applicable to Sellers or any Acquired
Company or the assets, or operation of the business, of Sellers or any
Acquired Company, (y) Contract to which an Acquired Company is party or by
which any of the Acquired Companies' assets or properties are bound or (z)
other obligation of confidentiality, or (3) result in the disclosure of
competitively sensitive information; provided, however, that, in such
instances, Sellers shall inform Buyer of the general nature of the information
being withheld and, upon Buyer's request and at Buyer's sole cost and expense,
reasonably cooperate with Buyer to provide such information, in whole or in
part, in a manner that would not result in any of the outcomes described in
the foregoing clauses (1), (2) and (3). Notwithstanding anything to the
contrary contained herein, during the Pre-Closing Period, without the prior
written consent of U.S. Seller (x) (which consent may be withheld for any
reason) Buyer shall have no right to perform invasive or subsurface
investigations of the properties or facilities of any Acquired Company, and
(y) (which consent may not be unreasonably withheld) Buyer shall not, and
shall cause its Affiliates and its Representatives not to, contact any vendor,
supplier or customer of an Acquired Company regarding the business,
operations, or prospects of the Acquired Companies or this Agreement or the
transactions contemplated hereby.

  

  

 

 

 

  

 

37  

  

 

 

 

  

(b) Buyer will hold any information obtained pursuant to Section 5.2(a) in
confidence in accordance with the Confidentiality Agreement.

  

  

Section 5.3 Efforts to Consummate. Subject to Section 5.4, during the Pre-
Closing Period, each of Buyer and Sellers shall, and Sellers shall cause the
Acquired Companies to, use reasonable best efforts (unless, with respect to
any action, another standard of performance is expressly provided for herein)
to take, or cause to be taken, all actions and to do, or cause to be done, all
things necessary, proper or advisable to consummate and make effective the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement as promptly as practicable,
including satisfaction of the conditions to Closing set forth in Article 6.

  

  

Section 5.4 Governmental Approvals.

  

  

(a) Subject to the other terms and conditions of this Section 5.4, during the
Pre-Closing Period, Buyer, shall, and shall cause its Affiliates to, use
reasonable best efforts to (i) obtain, or cause to be obtained, the Consents
of Governmental Bodies set forth in Section 5.4(a) of the Seller Disclosure
Schedules, including to cause the waiting periods under the HSR Act to
terminate or expire at the earliest possible date after filing, (ii) respond
promptly to any requests for information made by any Governmental Body,
including the FTC or the DOJ, (iii) cooperate fully with the other Party in
promptly seeking to obtain all such Consents and (iv) not take any action that
could reasonably be expected to have the effect of delaying, impairing or
impeding the receipt of any such Consents. Buyer and Sellers shall (A) prepare
and file required Notification and Report Forms under the HSR Act with the FTC
and the DOJ, as promptly as practicable and, in no event, later than ten (10)
Business Days after the date hereof, and (B) prepare and file notifications,
filings, registrations, submissions or other materials required or necessary
to obtain the other Consents of Governmental Bodies set forth in Section
5.4(a) of the Seller Disclosure Schedules as promptly as practicable. All
filings made in connection with the foregoing sentence shall be made in
substantial compliance with the requirements of applicable Law, including
Antitrust Laws. All filing fees payable in connection with the notifications,
filings, registrations, submissions or other materials contemplated by this
Section 5.4(a) shall be paid entirely by Buyer.

  

  

(b) To the extent not prohibited by applicable Law, each of Buyer, on the one
hand, and Sellers, on the other hand, shall (i) promptly notify and furnish
the other Party copies of any correspondence or communication (including, in
the case of any oral correspondence or communication, a summary thereof)
between it or any of its Affiliates or any of their respective
Representatives, on the one hand, and any Governmental Body, on the other
hand, or any filing such Party submits to any Governmental Body, (ii) consult
with and permit the other Party to review in advance any proposed filing and
any written or oral communication or correspondence by such Party to any
Governmental Body, and (iii) consider in good faith the views of such other
Party in connection with any proposed filing and any written or oral
communication or correspondence to any Governmental Body, in each case, to the
extent relating to the subject matter of this Section 5.4 or the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement. No Party to this Agreement shall agree to, or
permit any of its Affiliates or Representatives to, participate in any meeting
or discussion with any Governmental Body in respect of any filings,
investigation, inquiry or any other matter contemplated by this Section 5.4 or
any transaction contemplated by this Agreement unless it consults with the
other Party in advance and, to the extent permitted by such Governmental Body,
gives the other Party the opportunity to attend and participate in such
meeting or discussion.

  

  

 

 

 

  

 

38  

  

 

 

 

  

(c) Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the contrary, Buyer shall
take any and all actions necessary to obtain any Consents required under or in
connection with the HSR Act and any other Antitrust Law, and to enable all
waiting periods under any Antitrust Law to expire, and to avoid or eliminate
each and every impediment under any Antitrust Law asserted by any Governmental
Body, in each case, to cause the Closing and the other transactions
contemplated hereby to occur as promptly as practicable following the date of
this Agreement and, in any event, prior to the Termination Date, including (i)
promptly complying with or modifying any requests or inquiries for additional
information or documentation (including any second request) by any
Governmental Body, (ii) offering, negotiating, committing to and effecting, by
consent decree, hold separate order or otherwise, (A) the sale, divestiture,
license or other disposition of any and all of the capital stock or equity
interests, assets, rights, products or businesses of Buyer and its Affiliates
and the Acquired Companies and (B) any other restrictions on the activities of
Buyer and its Affiliates and the Acquired Companies to the extent the failure
to do so that would adversely affect the ability of either Party to
consummate, or otherwise delay the consummation of, the transactions
contemplated hereby, and (iii) taking any and all other actions to prevent the
entry, enactment or promulgation of any Order that would adversely affect the
ability of either Party to consummate, or otherwise delay the consummation of
the transactions contemplated hereby and by the Ancillary Agreements.
Notwithstanding the foregoing or anything in this Agreement to the contrary,
in no event shall Buyer, any Acquired Company or any of their respective
Affiliates be obligated to commit to take any action pursuant to this Section
5.4(c), the consummation of which is not conditioned on the consummation of
the Closing.

  

  

(d) In the event that any Consent listed on Section 5.4(d) of the Seller
Disclosure Schedules (the "Schedule 5.4(d) Consents") shall not be obtained
prior to the Closing, each of the Parties agrees that it shall use its
reasonable best efforts to obtain any such Schedule 5.4(d) Consents as soon as
reasonably practicable after the Closing Date and to cause title to all equity
interests in the Untransferred Entities to be transferred to Buyer for no
additional consideration as promptly as possible after receipt of such
Consents. Each of Sellers agrees that it shall operate each of the
Untransferred Entities (if any) subject to the restrictions set forth in
Section 5.1 (mutatis mutandis) for the benefit of Buyer during the period from
the Closing Date until the date upon which the transfer of such Untransferred
Entity is completed (such period, a "Transition Period") and shall pass on to
Buyer (which shall assume and accept) all of the benefits and burdens arising
from the operation or ownership of the Untransferred Entity during the
Transition Period.

  

  

Section 5.5 Resignations. At the Closing, Sellers shall deliver to Buyer
written resignation and release letters, effective as of the Closing Date, of
each of the officers and directors of the Acquired Companies, and each of
directors of the JV designated by U.S. Seller, in each case as requested by
Buyer in writing at least thirty (30) Business Days prior to the Closing,
effectuating his or her resignation from such position as a member of the
board of directors (or equivalent governing body) or as officer (although not
as an employee unless otherwise so required pursuant to this Agreement).

  

  

 

 

 

  

 

39  

  

 

 

 

  

Section 5.6 Public Announcements. Except as otherwise expressly contemplated
by or necessary to implement the provisions of this Agreement, neither Buyer
nor Sellers (nor any of their respective Affiliates) shall issue any press
release or otherwise make any public statements or disclosure with respect to
the transactions contemplated by this Agreement without the prior written
consent of the other Party, except to the extent such disclosure is required
by applicable Law or the rules of any stock exchange, in which case the Party
seeking to make such disclosure shall promptly notify the other Party thereof
and the Parties shall use reasonable efforts to cause a mutually agreeable
release or announcement to be issued.

  

  

Section 5.7 Books and Records.

  

  

(a) For a period of seven (7) years after the Closing, but only to the extent
reasonably required for the purposes set forth in this Section 5.7(a), Buyer
shall, and shall cause the Acquired Companies to, use reasonable efforts to
(a) give Seller and its Representatives reasonable access during normal
business hours to its Representatives, including employees, books and records
and other information (not subject to the attorney-client privilege, work
product doctrine, or other similar privilege, unless pursuant to a joint
defense or similar agreement) with respect to the Acquired Companies relating
to periods prior to the Closing for (i) the preparation of Tax returns and
financial statements, (ii) complying with any audit request, subpoena or other
investigative demand by any Governmental Body, subject in all cases to
reasonable restrictions imposed from time to time upon advice of counsel in
respect of applicable Laws relating to the confidentiality of information
(including any Antitrust Laws), (iii) the defense against any Legal Proceeding
arising out of or relating to (A) the transactions contemplated herein or in
any of the other Ancillary Agreements, or (B) any fact, situation,
circumstance, status, condition, activity, practice, plan, occurrence, event,
incident, action, failure to act or transaction on or prior to the Closing
Date involving Sellers, the Acquired Companies or the JV in any manner, and
(b) maintain all such books and records in the same or a similar accessible
format as currently existing. The access provided pursuant to this Section
5.7(a) shall be conducted in such a manner so as not to interfere unreasonably
with the operation of the business of Buyer and the Acquired Companies.

  

  

(b) For a period of one hundred and twenty (120) days after the Closing, but
only to the extent reasonably required for the purposes set forth in this
Section 5.7(b) and subject to the terms of the Confidentiality Agreement,
Seller shall use reasonable efforts to give Buyer and its Representatives
reasonable access during normal business hours to its Representatives,
including employees, books and records and other information (not subject to
the attorney-client privilege, work product doctrine, or other similar
privilege, unless pursuant to a joint defense or similar agreement) in order
to prepare audited financial statements with respect to the Acquired
Companies, to be completed within seventy-five (75) days of the Closing Date,
relating to periods prior to the Closing, subject in all cases to reasonable
restrictions imposed from time to time upon advice of counsel in respect of
applicable Laws relating to the confidentiality of information (including any
Antitrust Laws). The access provided pursuant to this Section 5.7(b) shall be
conducted in such a manner so as not to interfere unreasonably with the
operation of the business of Seller.

  

  

Section 5.8 Confidentiality Agreement. The Confidentiality Agreement shall be
deemed incorporated herein by reference as if set forth herein and shall
continue in full force and effect until the Closing, unless this Agreement is
terminated prior to the Closing, in which case the Confidentiality Agreement
shall nonetheless continue in full force and effect in accordance with its
terms.

Section 5.9 Director and Officer Indemnification .

  

  

(a) Buyer agrees that all rights to exculpation, indemnification and
advancement of expenses pursuant to the Organizational Documents of the
Acquired Companies for acts or omissions occurring on or prior to the Closing
Date, whether (i) asserted or claimed prior to, on or after the Closing Date
(including in respect of any matters arising in connection with this Agreement
and the transactions contemplated hereby), (ii) now existing or (iii) arising
prior to Closing, in favor of each Person who is now, or who has been at any
time prior to the date hereof, or who becomes prior to the Closing, a
director, officer, employee or other fiduciary of an Acquired Company (each, a
"DandO Indemnified Person") shall survive the Closing Date and the consummation
of the transactions contemplated hereby and remain in full force and effect.
For a period of at least six (6) years after the Closing Date, Buyer shall
not, and shall not permit any Acquired Company to, in any manner that would
adversely affect any DandO Indemnified Person, amend, repeal or modify any
provision in any Acquired Company's Organizational Documents relating to the
exculpation, indemnification or advancement of expenses with respect to any
DandO Indemnified Person in connection with acts or omissions occurring on or
prior to the Closing Date, whether asserted or claimed prior to, on or after
the Closing Date (including in respect of any matters arising in connection
with this Agreement and the transactions contemplated hereby), unless, and
only to the extent, required by applicable Law, it being the intent of the
Parties that all such DandO Indemnified Persons shall continue to be entitled to
such exculpation, indemnification and advancement of expenses to the fullest
extent permitted by applicable Law, and that no change, modification or
amendment of such documents or arrangements may be made that will adversely
affect any such DandO Indemnified Person's rights thereto without the prior
written consent of such DandO Indemnified Person.

  

  

(b) In the event that Buyer, any Acquired Company or any of their respective
successors or assigns (i) consolidates with or merges into any other Person
and is not the continuing or surviving corporation or entity of such
consolidation or merger or (ii) transfers or conveys fifty percent (50%) or
more of its properties and other assets to any Person, then, and in each such
case, proper provision shall be made so that such successors, assigns or
transferees shall expressly assume the obligations set forth in this Section
5.9.

  

  

(c) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained herein or otherwise,
the rights and benefits of the DandO Indemnified Persons under this Section 5.9
shall not be terminated or modified in any manner as to adversely affect any
DandO Indemnified Person without the prior written consent of such DandO
Indemnified Person. The provisions of this Section 5.9 are intended to be for
the benefit of, and shall be enforceable by, each DandO Indemnified Person, his
or her heirs and his or her executors, administrators and personal
representatives, each of whom is an intended third-party beneficiary of this
Section 5.9, and are in addition to, and not in substitution for, any other
rights, including rights to indemnification or contribution that any such
Person may have by Contract or otherwise. The provisions of this Section 5.9
shall survive consummation of the Closing.

  

  

 

 

 

  

 

41  

  

 

 

 

  

Section 5.10 Employment and Benefits Arrangements.

  

  

(a) From and after the Closing Date, Buyer will honor, in accordance with
their terms, all existing written employment, change in control and severance
agreements between the Acquired Companies and any Company Employee.

  

  

(b) Continuing Employees.

  

  

(i) During the eighteen (18) month period commencing on the Closing Date or
such shorter period as the applicable employee may be employed, Buyer and its
Affiliates shall provide to each Company Employee a base salary or wage rate
and annual cash bonus opportunity at least equal to such Company Employee's
base salary or wage rate and annual bonus opportunity in effect as of
immediately prior to the Closing and benefits that are, in the aggregate,
substantially no less favorable than those in effect immediately prior to the
Closing.

  

  

(ii) For purposes of eligibility and vesting under the compensation and
benefit plans, programs agreements and arrangements of Buyer or its Affiliates
in which the Company Employees participate or are eligible to participate
after the Closing (the "New Plans"), and benefit accrual solely for purposes
of determining accrual of vacation and severance benefits under New Plans, if
applicable, each such Company Employee shall be credited with his or her years
of service with the Acquired Companies or any of their respective Affiliates
as of the date hereof (including any predecessor) before the Closing, to the
same extent as such Company Employee was entitled, before the Closing, to
credit for such service under any similar Company Benefit Plan. In addition,
and without limiting the generality of the foregoing: (A) each Company
Employee shall be immediately eligible to participate, without any waiting
time, in any and all New Plans to the extent coverage under such New Plan
replaces coverage under a comparable Company Benefit Plan in which such
Company Employee participated immediately before the replacement; and (B) for
purposes of each New Plan providing medical, dental, pharmaceutical and/or
vision benefits to any Company Employee, Buyer or its Affiliates shall cause
all pre-existing condition exclusions and actively-at-work requirements of
such New Plan to be waived for such Company Employee and his or her covered
dependents to the extent such exclusions or requirements were waived or
satisfied under the comparable Company Benefit Plan, and Buyer or its
Affiliates shall cause any eligible expenses incurred by such Company Employee
and his or her covered dependents under a Company Benefit Plan during the
portion of the plan year prior to the Closing to be taken into account under
such New Plan for purposes of satisfying all deductible, co-insurance, co-
payment and maximum out-of-pocket requirements applicable to such Company
Employee and his or her covered dependents for the applicable plan year as if
such amounts had been paid in accordance with such New Plan.

  

  

(iii) Notwithstanding anything in this Section 5.10(b), the terms and
conditions of employment for any Company Employees that are governed by a
collective bargaining agreement immediately prior to the Closing Date shall
continue to be governed by such collective bargaining agreement as of the
Closing until the expiration, termination or modification of such agreement in
accordance with its terms or applicable Law.

  

  

 

 

 

  

 

42  

  

 

 

 

  

This Section 5.10 shall be binding upon and inure solely to the benefit of
each of the parties to this Agreement, and nothing in this Section 5.10 or any
other provision in this Agreement, express or implied, is intended to confer
upon any other Person any rights or remedies of any nature whatsoever under or
by reason of this Section 5.10 or any other provision of this Agreement or is
intended to be, shall constitute or be construed as an amendment to or
modification of the Company Benefit Plans or any other employee benefit plan
or arrangement of Sellers, the Acquired Companies, the JV, Buyer or their
respective Affiliates, unless this Agreement explicitly states that the
provision "amends" such Company Benefit Plan, or any other employee benefit
plans or arrangements, or limit in any way the right of Sellers, the Acquired
Companies, the JV, Buyer or any of their respective Affiliates to amend,
modify or terminate any Company Benefit Plan or any other employee benefit
plans or arrangements. This shall not prevent the parties entitled to enforce
this Agreement from enforcing any provision in this Agreement, but no other
party shall be entitled to enforce any provision in this Agreement on the
grounds that it is an amendment to such Company Benefit Plan or arrangement.
If a party not entitled to enforce this Agreement brings a lawsuit or other
action to enforce any provision in this Agreement as an amendment to such
Company Benefit Plan or arrangement and that provision is construed to be such
an amendment despite not being explicitly designated as one in this Agreement,
that provision shall lapse retroactively as of its inception, thereby
precluding it from having any amendatory effect. Nothing in this Section 5.10
or any other provision in this Agreement shall confer upon any Company
Employee any right with respect to continuance of employment by Buyer or any
Affiliate or limit the right of Buyer or its Affiliates to terminate the
employment of any Company Employee at any time following the Closing.

  

  

Section 5.11 Termination of Affiliate Arrangements. All Contracts between an
Acquired Company, on the one hand, and Sellers and any of their respective
Affiliates (other than the Acquired Companies), on the other hand, listed on
Section 5.11 of the Seller Disclosure Schedules shall be terminated as of the
Closing Date, and all obligations and liabilities thereunder shall be
satisfied.

  

  

Section 5.12 Further Assurances. Following the Closing, and subject to the
terms and conditions of this Agreement, each of Buyer and Sellers shall, and
shall cause their respective Affiliates to, execute and deliver such
additional documents, instruments and assurances and take such other actions
as may reasonably be requested to carry out and give effect to the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement.

  

  

Section 5.13 Tax Returns.

  

  

(a) U.S. Seller shall prepare and file, or cause to be prepared and filed, all
Tax Returns that are required to be filed by the Acquired Companies on or
prior to the Closing Date. Buyer shall not, and shall not cause or permit, any
of the Acquired Companies to amend any Tax Return for any Pre-Closing Tax
Period without the prior written consent of U.S. Seller, which shall not be
unreasonably withheld, delayed or conditioned.

  

  

(b) Buyer shall prepare and timely file, or cause to be prepared and timely
filed, all Tax Returns required to be filed by any of the Acquired Companies
that have not been filed as of the Closing Date and that relate to a Pre-
Closing Tax Period or Straddle Tax Period; provided, however, that Buyer shall
prepare, or cause to be prepared, such Straddle Returns in a manner consistent
with past practice of the Acquired Companies (or U.S. Seller, as the case may
be), except as otherwise required by Law; and provided, further, that Buyer
shall deliver to U.S. Seller for its review, comment and approval a copy of
such Tax Returns as soon as practicable, but in no event later than fifteen
(15) days prior to the due date (taking into account any available extensions)
for filing such Tax Returns, and U.S. Seller shall submit to Buyer in writing
U.S. Seller's comments with respect to such Tax Returns as soon as practicable
but in no event later than one week prior to the due date (taking into account
any available extensions) of such Tax Returns. Buyer shall accept and
implement all comments reasonably requested by U.S. Seller, to the extent not
inconsistent with Section 3.16 and this Section 5.13, relating to Taxes for
which Sellers may be liable under Section 8.2.

  

  

 

 

 

  

 

43  

  

 

 

 

  

(c) The preparation and filing of all other Tax Returns shall be within the
control of Buyer.

  

  

(d) U.S. Seller shall be responsible for any Circular 698 Tax Obligations, and
shall pay or cause to be paid any Taxes due in connection therewith.

  

  

Section 5.14 Mutual Assistance and Cooperation. After the Closing Date, U.S.
Seller and Buyer shall, subject to Section 5.2, Section 5.7, and Section 5.8:

  

  

(a) assist (and cause their respective Affiliates to assist) the other party
in preparing any Tax Return of the Acquired Companies;

  

  

(b) cooperate fully in preparing for any audit of, or dispute with any Taxing
Authority regarding, any Tax Return of the Acquired Companies;

  

  

(c) make available to the other party and to any Taxing Authority as
reasonably requested all information, records and documents relating to Taxes
of the Acquired Companies; and

  

  

(d) furnish the other party with copies of all correspondence received from
any Taxing Authority in connection with any audit or information request with
respect to the Acquired Companies for Taxes for which the other party may have
a liability.

  

  

Section 5.15 Exclusive Dealing.

  

  

(a) During the period from the date of this Agreement until the earlier of (i)
the date this Agreement is terminated in accordance with its terms and (ii)
the Closing Date, Sellers shall not take, and shall cause the Acquired
Companies and their respective Affiliates and Representatives to refrain from
taking, any action, directly or indirectly, to solicit or engage in
discussions or negotiations with, or provide any information to, any Person,
other than Buyer (and its Affiliates and Representatives), concerning the
purchase of the Acquired Companies (whether by merger, recapitalization or
other similar transaction).

  

  

(b) Immediately following the execution of this Agreement, Sellers shall, and
shall cause its Affiliates, and each of their respective Representatives to
terminate any existing discussions or negotiations with any Persons, other
than Buyer (and its Affiliates and Representatives), concerning the purchase
of the Acquired Companies.

  

  

 

 

 

  

 

44  

  

 

 

 

  

Section 5.16 No Hire and Non-Solicitation of Employees. Neither Sellers nor
any of their respective Affiliates shall at any time prior to eighteen (18)
months from the Closing Date, directly or indirectly, (i) solicit the
employment or services (whether as an employee, consultant, independent
contractor or otherwise) of any of the Company Employees without Buyer's prior
written consent or (ii) hire in any capacity (whether as an employee,
consultant, independent contractor or otherwise) any of the Company Employees,
who is not terminated by Buyer or any of its Affiliates subsequent to the
Closing, without Buyer's prior written consent; provided, that this Section
5.16 shall not prevent Sellers or any of their respective Affiliates from
hiring any of the Company Employees who (x) are terminated by Buyer or the
Acquired Companies or (y) respond to a General Solicitation by Sellers or any
of their respective Affiliates. For purposes of this Section 5.16, the term
"solicit the employment or services" shall not be deemed to include
generalized searches for employees through media advertisements of general
circulation, employment search firms, open job fairs or otherwise (each such
search, a "General Solicitation"); provided, further, that any General
Solicitation by Sellers or any of their respective Affiliates shall not be
focused or targeted on the Company Employees specified on Section 5.16 of the
Seller Disclosure Schedules.

  

  

Section 5.17 Covenant Not to Compete. In light of the extensive knowledge
possessed by Sellers and their respective Affiliates in respect of the
Acquired Companies and the Business, and for good and valuable consideration
which the Parties acknowledge, it is mutually agreed that, for the period
commencing at the Closing and ending on the second (2nd) anniversary of the
Closing Date (the "Non-Compete Period"), none of the Parent Entities shall
engage (including through the provision of management, advisory or technical
services or through a joint venture or partnership) in the Business, anywhere
in the world ("Competitive Activities") without the prior written consent of
Buyer; provided, that each Parent Entity may engage in any business or
activity (and natural evolutions thereof) conducted or engaged in by Parent or
its Affiliates prior to July 25, 2013. Notwithstanding the foregoing, Buyer
hereby agrees that (a) the foregoing covenant shall not be deemed breached as
a result of the ownership by the Parent Entities (i) of the stock of a Person
engaged, directly or indirectly, in Competitive Activities if owned by a
pension fund managed by a Parent Entity; (ii) of less than an aggregate of ten
percent (10%) of the stock of a Person engaged, directly or indirectly, in
Competitive Activities (such Person, a "Competing Person"); or (iii) of the
stock of a Competing Person if the revenues derived from such Competitive
Activities do not exceed ten percent (10%) of gross annual revenues of such
Competing Person for the most recently completed fiscal year, and (b) any
acquisition by a Parent Entity of a Competing Person who derives more than ten
percent (10%) but no more than forty percent (40%) of its gross annual
revenues for the most recently completed fiscal year from Competitive
Activities shall not require the prior written consent of Buyer if (i) the
applicable Parent Entity takes steps to divest as promptly as reasonably
practicable the portion of such Competing Person's business engaged in the
Competitive Activities and (ii) Parent gives notice to Buyer of the proposed
divestiture and an opportunity to participate in the divestiture process.

  

  

Section 5.18 Notification of Certain Matters. Sellers, on the one hand, and
Buyer, on the other hand, shall promptly notify the other Party of:

  

  

 

 

 

  

 

45  

  

 

 

 

  

(a) any notice or other communication from any Person alleging that the
consent of such Person is or may be required in connection with the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement or the Ancillary Agreements;

  

  

(b) any notice or other communication from any governmental authority in
connection with the transactions contemplated by this Agreement; and

  

  

(c) any inaccuracy of any representation or warranty contained in this
Agreement (i) of Sellers of which Sellers obtain knowledge that would cause
the condition set forth in Section 6.3 not to be satisfied or (ii) of Buyer of
which Buyer obtains knowledge that would cause the condition set forth in
Section 6.2 not to be satisfied; provided, that no such notification, nor the
obligation to make such notification, shall affect any representation,
warranty, covenant or indemnification right or obligation of any Party;
provided, further, that the failure by Sellers to so notify Buyer shall not be
deemed a breach of covenant for purposes of Article 7 or Article 8 hereof.

  

  

Section 5.19 Transfer Taxes. Any Transfer Taxes, excluding, for the avoidance
of doubt, any Circular 698 Tax Obligations, incurred as a result of the
transfers effected pursuant to this Agreement shall be borne by one-half by
Buyer and one-half by Sellers.

  

  

Section 5.20 Financing.

  

  

(a) Buyer shall use its reasonable best efforts to take, or cause to be taken,
all actions and to do, or cause to be done, all things necessary, proper or
advisable to arrange and obtain the Financing on the terms and conditions
described in the Financing Commitments and shall not permit any amendment or
modification to be made to, or any waiver of any provision or remedy under the
Financing Commitments (except that, subject to the limitations set forth in
Section 4.4(a), Buyer may replace or amend the Financing Commitments to add
lenders, lead arrangers, bookrunners, syndication agents or similar entities
that have not executed the Financing Commitments as of the date hereof (but
not to make any other changes), if the addition of such additional parties,
individually or in the aggregate, would not prevent, delay or impair the
availability of the financing under the Financing Commitments or the
consummation of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement). Without
limiting the generality of the foregoing, Buyer shall use reasonable best
efforts to (i) maintain in effect the Financing Commitments until the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement are consummated, (ii) satisfy on a
timely basis all conditions and covenants applicable to Buyer in the Financing
Commitments and otherwise comply with its obligations thereunder, (iii) enter
into definitive agreements with respect thereto on the terms and conditions
(including the flex provisions) contemplated by the Financing Commitments, and
(iv) consummate the Financing at or prior to the Closing. Without limiting the
generality of the foregoing, Buyer shall give Sellers prompt notice: (A) of
any breach or default (or any event or circumstance that, with or without
notice, lapse of time or both, could reasonably be expected to give rise to
any breach or default) by any party to any Financing Commitment or definitive
document related to the Financing; (B) of the receipt of any written notice or
other written communication from any Person with respect to any (1) actual or
potential breach, default, termination or repudiation by any party to any
Financing Commitment or any definitive document related to the Financing or
any provisions of the Financing Commitment or any definitive document related
to the Financing or (2) material dispute or disagreement between or among any
parties to any Financing Commitment or any definitive document related to the
Financing; and (C) if for any reason Buyer believes in good faith that (1)
there is (or there is likely to be) a dispute or disagreement between or among
any parties to any Financing Commitment or any definitive document related to
the Financing or (2) there is a material possibility that it will not be able
to obtain all or any portion of the Financing on the terms, in the manner or
from the sources contemplated by the Financing Commitment or the definitive
documents related to the Financing. As soon as reasonably practicable, but in
any event within five (5) Business Days after the date Sellers deliver to
Buyer a written request, Buyer shall provide any information reasonably
requested by Sellers relating to any circumstance referred to in clause (A),
(B) or (C) of the immediately preceding sentence. If any portion of the
Financing becomes unavailable on the terms and conditions (including the flex
provisions) contemplated in the Financing Commitments, Buyer shall use its
reasonable best efforts to arrange and obtain financing from alternative
sources in an amount sufficient to consummate the transactions contemplated by
this Agreement as promptly as practicable following the occurrence of such
event. Buyer shall keep Sellers informed on a reasonably current basis in
reasonable detail of the status of its efforts to arrange the Financing and
concurrently provide copies of all documents provided to or by the lenders or
otherwise related to the Financing to Sellers.

  

  

 

 

 

  

 

46  

  

 

 

 

  

(b) Buyer acknowledges and agrees that the obtaining of the Financing, or any
alternative financing, is not a condition to the Closing and reaffirms its
obligation to consummate the transactions contemplated by this Agreement
irrespective and independently of the availability of the Financing or any
alternative financing, subject to fulfillment or waiver of the conditions to
the Closing set forth in Article 6.

  

  

Section 5.21 Lenders. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained
herein or otherwise, each Seller acknowledges and agrees that it cannot
directly enforce the lenders' obligations with respect to the Financing
Commitments against such lenders. This Section 5.21 is intended to be for the
benefit of, and shall be enforceable by, such lenders and their respective
successors and assigns. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained
herein or otherwise, each Seller agrees and acknowledges that Buyer does not
and will not have any obligation (whether or not requested by any Seller)
under this Agreement (including, without limitation, pursuant to Section 9.11)
to initiate or participate in any action, suit, or proceeding, whether at law
or in equity, against such lenders with respect to any matter related to or
arising out of this Agreement or the Financing Commitments.

  

  

Section 5.22 Bank Accounts. As promptly as reasonably practicable, but in no
event later than twenty (20) days after the date hereof, U.S. Seller shall
provide to Buyer a list of the locations and numbers of all bank accounts,
investment accounts and safe deposit boxes maintained by the Acquired
Companies, together with the names of all Persons who are authorized
signatories or have access thereto or control thereover.

  

  

Section 5.23 Certain Intellectual Property Matters.

  

  

(a) As soon as practicable after the Closing Date, but no later than ninety
(90) days thereafter, Buyer shall, and shall cause each of the Acquired
Companies (including Power-One SAS, Power-One Limited, Power-One Ireland
Limited, Power-One B.V., Power-One Pte. Ltd., Power-One s.r.o., Power-One AG,
Power-One Limited, Power-One Limited Liability Company, Power-One Co., Ltd.,
and Power-One Asia Pacific Electronics (Shenzhen) Co. Ltd.), as applicable, to
(i) discontinue all use of the names, trademarks and service marks containing
"POWER-ONE" (the "POWER-ONE Marks") and any term or designation confusingly
similar thereto as, or as part of, a corporate name, business name or trade
name, (ii) take action to change each Acquired Company's corporate name,
business name and trade name to a name that does not include the POWER-ONE
Marks and is not confusingly similar thereto and (iii) take all actions
necessary and appropriate to (x) change each Acquired Company's corporate and
business name with the appropriate Governmental Bodies, including effecting
the amendment of any by-laws, corporate formation agreements, or similar
documents, (y) to the extent applicable, de-register such name, including
making all filings with appropriate Governmental Bodies, necessary to effect
such changes, and (z) to the extent applicable, amend the necessary agreements
and make the necessary governmental filings to adopt and register a new name
for each applicable Acquired Company. During the foregoing 90-day period after
the Closing Date, the Acquired Companies may use the "POWER-ONE" name as their
corporate name solely for the purposes of winding down such use and
transitioning to the new name(s) referred to in clause (ii) above. In the
event that Buyer requires additional time for completion of the foregoing
actions within such 90-day period, Buyer may request an extension of thirty
(30) days by written notice to U.S. Seller no later than sixty (60) days after
the Closing Date, and U.S. Seller shall not unreasonably withhold its consent
to such a request. Buyer shall certify in writing to U.S. Seller that Buyer
has complied with this Section 5.23(a) within one-hundred twenty (120) days of
the Closing Date. Nothing in this Section 5.23(a) requires Buyer or its
current Affiliates to discontinue the use of any names, trademarks or service
marks used by Buyer or its current Affiliates as of the date hereof.

  

  

 

 

 

  

 

47  

  

 

 

 

  

(b) Prior to and after the Closing Date, should it be brought to the attention
of either Party that any POWER-ONE Marks are owned by any of the Acquired
Companies, such Party shall provide a written notice thereof to the other
Party hereto and, as soon as practicable thereafter, any such POWER-ONE Mark
shall be assigned by the respective Acquired Company, and, to the extent
applicable, shall be caused by Buyer to be so assigned, to U.S. Seller
pursuant to a trademark assignment agreement substantially in the form of the
assignment agreement used to assign to U.S. Seller registered trademark nos.
CN1706063 and CN6199603. All such POWER-ONE Marks shall, immediately upon
their assignment to U.S. Seller, be deemed "Licensed Marks" under the
Trademark License Agreement.

termination pursuant to Section 7.1(a)):

  

  

(a) by the mutual written consent of Buyer and Sellers;

  

  

(b) by either Buyer, on the one hand, or Sellers, on the other hand, if the
Closing shall not have occurred on or before August 30, 2014 or such other
date that Buyer and Sellers may agree upon in writing (the "Termination

that makes consummation of the Closing illegal or otherwise prohibited or (ii)
any Governmental Body shall have issued an Order permanently enjoining the

remove such Law or Order;

  

  

(d) by Buyer, if (i) there shall have been a breach by Sellers of any

50  

  

 

 

 

  

(e) by each Seller, if (i) there shall have been a breach by Buyer of any
representation, warranty, covenant or agreement contained herein that would
result in the failure of any of the conditions set forth in Section 6.3(a) or
(b) to be satisfied, (ii) such Seller is not then in breach of any provision
of this Agreement and (iii) such breach by Buyer shall not have been cured on
or prior to the earlier of (A) the Termination Date and (B) thirty (30) days
after receipt by Buyer of written notice of such breach from such Seller.

Section 8.1 Survival.

  

  

(a) Subject to the other terms and conditions of this Article 8, each of the
representations and warranties set forth in this Agreement shall survive the
Closing and the consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby and shall
expire (together with any right to assert a claim under Section 8.2(a) or
Section 8.3(a), as applicable) on the date that is one (1) year after the
Closing Date. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the representations and
warranties contained in (i) Sections 3.1 ("Organization and Authority of
Sellers"), (ii) 3.2(a) ("Organization") and 3.3 ("Capitalization;
Organizational Documents") of this Agreement (collectively, the "Seller
Fundamental Representations") and the right to indemnification for breach

Authority of Buyer") and 4.6 ("Investment Purpose") of this Agreement (the
"Buyer Fundamental Representations") and the right to indemnification for
breach thereof shall survive indefinitely; (iii) Section 3.17 ("Environmental
Matters") of this Agreement and the right to indemnification for breach
thereof shall expire on the date that is two (2) years after the Closing Date,

51  

  

 

 

 

  

(b) Each of the covenants and other agreements contained in Section 5.1 of
this Agreement shall expire (together with any right to assert a claim under
Section 8.2(b) or Section 8.3(b), as applicable) on the date that is ninety
(90) days after the Closing Date.

  

  

(c) It is the express intent of Buyer and Sellers that, (i) if the applicable
period set forth in Section 8.1(a) or Section 8.1(b) for the survival of the
representations, warranties, covenants and other agreements and for the making
of claims for indemnification based on any breaches thereof is shorter than
the statute of limitations that would otherwise have been applicable thereto,
then, by contract, the statute of limitations applicable thereto shall be
reduced to the survival period set forth in Section 8.1(a) or Section 8.1(b),
as applicable, and (ii) each Party shall be obligated to indemnify, defend,
hold harmless, compensate or reimburse the other Party after the last date
that is within the survival period set forth in Section 8.1(a) or Section
8.1(b), as applicable, with respect to any particular claim for
indemnification, and all rights and remedies that may be exercised by a Party
with respect to such representations, warranties, covenants and other
agreements and any claim for indemnification based on any breaches thereof
will expire and terminate simultaneously with the ending of the survival
period set forth in Section 8.1(a) or Section 8.1(b), as applicable. Buyer and
Sellers further acknowledge that the survival periods set forth in Section
8.1(a) or Section 8.1(b) are the result of arms' length negotiations between
Buyer and Sellers and that Buyer and Sellers intend for such survival periods
to be enforced as agreed by Buyer and Sellers.

  

  

(d) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary herein, any Claim properly
asserted in good faith pursuant to Section 8.5 prior to the expiration of the
applicable survival period set forth in Section 8.1(a) or Section 8.1(b) shall
survive until such Claim is fully and finally resolved.

  

  

Section 8.2 Indemnification by U.S. Seller. Subject to the other terms and
conditions of this Article 8, from and after the Closing, U.S. Seller shall
indemnify, defend and hold harmless Buyer (including its directors, officers
and Affiliates) from and against, and shall pay and reimburse Buyer for, any
and all Losses of Buyer to the extent arising out of:

  

  

(a) any inaccuracy in or breach of any representation or warranty of Sellers
contained in Article 3 of this Agreement;

  

  

(b) any breach of any covenant, agreement or obligation to be performed by
Sellers pursuant to this Agreement;

  

  

(c) any and all liability of the Acquired Companies existing prior to the
Closing Date arising from, or otherwise in connection with, the following
Legal Proceedings; Syn Qor, Inc. v. Power One, Inc. et al., Civil Action No.
2:07cv497TJW/CE and Syn Qor, Inc. v. Power One, Inc. et al., Civil Action No.

Ltd. arising from, or otherwise in connection with, the September 30, 2010 tax
audit report of the Italian tax authorities in Arezo and the related November
20, 2010 and August 8, 2012 tax assessment notices, as further described in

52

conditions of this Article 8, from and after the Closing Date, Buyer shall
indemnify, defend and hold harmless Sellers (including its directors, officers
and Affiliates) against, and shall pay and reimburse Sellers for, any and all
Losses of Sellers to the extent arising out of:

  

  

(a) any inaccuracy in or breach of any representation or warranty of Buyer
contained in Article 4 of this Agreement; or

  

  

(b) any breach of any covenant, agreement or obligation to be performed by
Buyer pursuant to this Agreement.

  

  

Section 8.4 Limitations and Other Matters Relating to Indemnification.

  

  

(a) U.S. Seller shall not be required to indemnify, defend, hold harmless, pay
or reimburse Buyer under Section 8.2:

  

  

(i) unless and until the aggregate amount of all Losses subject to
indemnification under Section 8.2 exceeds $4,000,000 (the "Seller
Indemnification Threshold"), and once the Seller Indemnification Threshold has
been exceeded, U.S. Seller shall only be required to indemnify, defend, hold
harmless, pay and reimburse for Losses in excess of the Seller Indemnification
Threshold (subject to the limitations set forth in Section 8.4(b)); provided,
however, that the Seller Indemnification Threshold shall not apply in any
manner whatsoever to any breach of a Seller Fundamental Representation, any
breach of a covenant (other than Section 5.1) by any Seller or the Syn Qor
Liability; and

  

  

(ii) unless and until the amount of Losses subject to indemnification under
Section 8.2 arising from any particular inaccuracy in or breach of any
representation, warranty or covenant of Sellers in this Agreement exceeds
$300,000 (the "Seller Per Claim Threshold"), and once the Seller Per Claim
Threshold has been exceeded, U.S. Seller shall only be required to indemnify,
defend, hold harmless, pay and reimburse for Losses in excess of the Seller
Per Claim Threshold (subject to the limitations set forth in Section 8.4(b)),
and such Losses below the Seller Per Claim Threshold shall not be counted
toward the Seller Indemnification Threshold; provided, however, that the
Seller Per Claim Threshold shall not apply in any manner whatsoever to any
breach of a Seller Fundamental Representation, any breach of a covenant (other
than Section 5.1) by any Seller, the Syn Qor Liability, or the Magnetek
Liability.

  

  

For purposes of calculating Losses under this Section 8.4, any materiality or
Company Material Adverse Effect qualifications in the representations,
warranties, covenants and agreements will be disregarded.

  

  

(b)

  

  

(i) U.S. Seller shall not be required to indemnify, defend, hold harmless, pay
or reimburse Buyer under Section 8.2 to the extent the aggregate amount of
Losses incurred by Buyer as a result of any breach or inaccuracy described in
Section 8.2 exceeds $11,700,000; provided, however, that the limitation in
this Section 8.4(b)(i) shall not apply in any manner whatsoever to any breach
of a Seller Fundamental Representation, any breach of a covenant (other than
Section 5.1) by any Seller, the Syn Qor Liability, or the Magnetek Liability.

  

  

 

 

 

  

 

53  

  

 

 

 

  

(ii) Buyer shall not be required to indemnify, defend, hold harmless, pay or
reimburse Sellers under Section 8.3 to the extent the aggregate amount of
Losses incurred by Sellers as a result of any breach or inaccuracy described
in Section 8.3 exceeds $11,700,000; provided, however, that the limitation in
this Section 8.4(b)(ii) shall not apply in any manner whatsoever to any breach
of a Buyer Fundamental Representation.

  

  

(c) The amount of any Losses that are subject to indemnification, compensation
or reimbursement under this Article 8 shall be reduced by the amount of any
insurance proceeds and any indemnity, contribution or other similar payment
actually received by the Indemnified Party in respect of such Losses or any of
the events, conditions, facts or circumstances resulting in or relating to
such Losses ("Third-Party Payments"). If an Indemnified Party receives any
Third-Party Payment with respect to any Losses for which it has previously
been indemnified (directly or indirectly) by an Indemnifying Party, the
Indemnified Party shall promptly (and in any event within three (3) Business
Days after receiving such Third-Party Payment) pay to the Indemnifying Party
an amount equal to such Third-Party Payment or, if it is a lesser amount, the
amount of such previously indemnified Losses. The Indemnified Party shall use
its commercially reasonable efforts to recover under insurance policies or
indemnity, contribution or other similar agreements other than this Agreement
for any Losses to the same extent such Party would if such Losses were not
subject to indemnification, compensation or reimbursement hereunder.

  

  

(d) The amount of any Losses that are subject to indemnification, payment or
reimbursement under this Article 8 shall be reduced by an amount equal to any
Tax benefit actually realized as a result of such Losses by the Indemnified
Party. The Indemnified Party shall be deemed to have "actually realized" a Tax
benefit to the extent that, and at such time as, the amount of Taxes paid by
the Indemnified Party or any of its Affiliates is reduced below the amount of
Taxes that such Persons would have been required to pay but for the Tax
benefit. If a Tax benefit is actually realized by an Indemnified Party with
respect to any Losses for which it has previously been indemnified (directly
or indirectly) by an Indemnifying Party, the Indemnified Party shall promptly
(and in any event within three (3) Business Days after such Tax benefit is
actually realized) pay to the Indemnifying Party an amount equal to such
actually realized Tax benefit or, if it is a lesser amount, the amount of such
previously indemnified Losses. If a Tax benefit is reasonably available to an
Indemnified Party in connection with any such Losses, the Indemnified Party
shall use commercially reasonable efforts to cause such Tax benefit to be
actually realized.

  

  

(e) Each of Buyer and Sellers shall (and shall cause its Affiliates to) use
commercially reasonable efforts to pursue all legal rights and remedies
available in order to mitigate and minimize any Losses subject to
indemnification pursuant to this Article 8 promptly upon becoming aware of any
event or circumstance that could reasonably be expected to constitute or give
rise to such Losses.

  

  

 

 

 

  

 

54  

  

 

 

 

  

(f) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary herein, neither Party shall be
liable under this Article 8 or otherwise for any Losses based upon or arising
out of any inaccuracy in or breach of any of the representations, warranties
or covenants of such Party contained in this Agreement if the other Party had
actual knowledge of such inaccuracy or breach prior to the Closing Date.

  

  

(g) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary herein, in no event shall Buyer,
on the one hand, or Sellers, on the other hand, be required to indemnify,
defend, hold harmless, pay or reimburse the other Party for Losses under this
Article 8 to the extent such Losses (i) were considered in the determination
of the Final Adjustment Report pursuant to Section 2.4, (ii) were reserved for
or reflected in the Financial Statements, or (iii) in the case of Sellers,
resulted from the failure by Sellers or any Acquired Company to take any
action prohibited by Section 5.1(b) of this Agreement if Sellers requested the
consent of Buyer to take such action and Buyer withheld such consent. Any
Losses subject to indemnification hereunder shall be determined without
duplication of recovery.

  

  

Section 8.5 Indemnification Procedures.

  

  

(a) All claims for indemnification pursuant to this Article 8 shall be made in
accordance with the procedures set forth in this Section 8.5. A Person
entitled to assert a claim for indemnification (a "Claim") pursuant to this
Article 8 (an "Indemnified Party") shall give the Indemnifying Party written
notice of any such Claim (a "Claim Notice"), which notice shall include a
description in reasonable detail of (i) the basis for, and nature of, such
Claim, including the facts constituting the basis for such Claim, and (ii) the
estimated amount of the Losses that have been or may be sustained by the
Indemnified Party in connection with such Claim. Any Claim Notice shall be
given by the Indemnified Party to the Indemnifying Party, (A) in the case of a
Claim in connection with any Legal Proceeding made or brought by any Person
(other than Buyer or Seller in connection with this Agreement) against such
Indemnified Party (a "Third-Party Claim"), promptly, but in any event not
later than five (5) Business Days, following receipt of notice of the
assertion or commencement of such Legal Proceeding, and (B) in the case of a
Claim other than a Third-Party Claim (a "Direct Claim"), promptly, but in any
event not later than five (5) Business Days, after the Indemnified Party
becomes aware of the facts constituting the basis for such Direct Claim;
provided, however, that no failure to give such prompt written notice shall
relieve the Indemnifying Party of any of its indemnification obligations
hereunder except to the extent that the Indemnifying Party is prejudiced by
such failure. The Indemnifying Party and Indemnified Party will cooperate in
good faith to resolve any such Claim (including any Direct Claim). For the
purposes of this Agreement, "Indemnifying Party" means Buyer (in the case of a
claim for indemnification by Sellers) or U.S. Seller (in the case of a claim
for indemnification by Buyer).

  

  

(b) With respect to any Third-Party Claim, the Indemnifying Party shall have
the right, by giving written notice to the Indemnified Party within thirty
(30) days after delivery of the Claim Notice with respect to such Third-Party
Claim, to assume control of the defense of such Third-Party Claim at the
Indemnifying Party's expense with counsel of its choosing, and the Indemnified
Party shall cooperate in good faith in such defense. The Indemnified Party or
Indemnifying Party, as the case may be, that is not controlling such defense
shall have the right, at its own cost and expense, to participate in the
defense of any Third-Party Claim with counsel selected by it. If the
Indemnifying Party elects not to control the defense of such Third-Party Claim
(including by failing to promptly notify the Indemnified Party in writing of
its election to control such defense in accordance with this Section 8.5(b)),
the Indemnified Party may control the defense of such Third-Party Claim with
counsel of its choosing. Buyer and Sellers shall reasonably cooperate with
each other in connection with the defense of any Claim, including by retaining
and providing to the Party controlling such defense records and information
that are reasonably relevant to such Claim and making available employees on a
mutually convenient basis for providing additional information and explanation
of any material provided hereunder. The Indemnified Party or Indemnifying
Party, as the case may be, that is controlling such defense shall keep the
other Party reasonably advised of the status of such Legal Proceeding and the
defense thereof.

  

  

 

 

 

  

 

55  

  

 

 

 

  

(c) Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the contrary, (i) an
Indemnifying Party shall not agree to any settlement of any Third-Party Claim
without the prior written consent of the Indemnified Party, such consent not
to be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed, unless such settlement
provides for no relief other than the payment of monetary damages and such
monetary damages are paid in full by the Indemnifying Party, and (ii) an
Indemnified Party shall not agree to any settlement of a Third-Party Claim
without the prior written consent of the Indemnifying Party (such consent not
to be unreasonably withheld in the event that the Indemnified Party has
assumed control of the defense of such Third-Party Claim in accordance with
this Section 8.5).

  

  

Section 8.6 Tax Treatment of Indemnification Payments. All indemnification
payments made under this Article 8 shall be deemed adjustments to the Purchase
Price for Tax purposes, unless otherwise required by applicable Law.

  

  

Section 8.7 Exclusive Remedy; No Duplication; No Set-off.

  

  

(a) From and after the Closing, the Parties acknowledge and agree that (i)
this Article 8 shall be the sole and exclusive remedy of Buyer, on the one
hand, and Sellers, on the other hand, in connection with this Agreement and
the transactions contemplated hereby, (ii) neither Buyer, on the one hand, nor
Sellers, on the other hand, shall be liable or responsible in any manner
whatsoever (whether for indemnification or otherwise) to any Indemnified Party
for a breach of this Agreement or in connection with any of the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement, including the purchase of the Shares pursuant
hereto, except pursuant to the indemnification provisions set forth in this
Article 8, and (iii) each Party hereby waives, to the fullest extent permitted
under applicable Law, any and all rights, claims, causes of action, suits,
demands and Legal Proceedings (A) for any breach of any representation,
warranty, covenant, agreement or obligation set forth herein or (B) otherwise
relating to or in connection with this Agreement and the transactions
contemplated hereby, in each case, that it may have against the other Party
and any of such Party's Affiliates or Representatives arising under or based
upon any applicable Law, except pursuant to the indemnification provisions set
forth in this Article 8; provided, however, that nothing in this Section
8.7(a) shall limit the rights or remedies of, or constitute a waiver of any
rights or remedies by, any Person pursuant to (or shall otherwise operate to
interfere with the operation of) Section 2.4 or Section 9.11.

  

  

 

 

 

  

 

56  

  

 

 

 

  

(b) Neither Buyer nor Sellers shall have any right to set-off any claim for
indemnification pursuant to this Article 8 against any payment due pursuant to
any other provision of this Agreement or any Ancillary Agreement.

  

  

ARTICLE 9

  

  

MISCELLANEOUS

  

  

Section 9.1 Limitation on Liability. No Party will be liable to any other
Party to this Agreement, any of such other Party's Affiliates or any third
party for any indirect, consequential, incidental, speculative, punitive,
special, exemplary or similar Losses (even if such Party has been advised of
the possibility of such Losses), including loss of revenue or anticipated
profits, loss of data, loss of customers or clients, loss of opportunity, loss
of business opportunity or lost business. This limitation applies regardless
of whether the damages or other relief are sought based on breach of warranty,
breach of contract, negligence, strict liability in tort or any other legal or
equitable theory.

  

  

Section 9.2 Fees and Expenses. Except as otherwise expressly provided in this
Agreement or in any Ancillary Agreements, whether or not the Closing is
consummated, all costs and expenses incurred, including fees and disbursements
of counsel, financial advisors and accountants, in connection with this
Agreement and the transactions contemplated hereby shall be borne by the Party
incurring such costs and expenses.

connection with this Agreement shall be in writing and shall be deemed to have
been properly delivered, given and received (a) on the date of delivery if

successful transmission if an executed copy of such notice is sent via

receipt requested, if received on a Business Day, otherwise on the next

Section 9.4 Entire Agreement. This Agreement, the Confidentiality Agreement,
the Ancillary Agreements and any other agreements, instruments or documents
being or to be executed and delivered by a Party or any of its Affiliates
pursuant to or in connection with this Agreement constitute the sole and
entire agreement of the Parties with respect to the subject matter contained
herein and therein, and supersede all other prior representations, warranties,
understandings and agreements, both written and oral, with respect to such
subject matter.

  

  

Section 9.5 Amendment. This Agreement shall not be amended, modified or
supplemented except by an instrument in writing specifically designated as an
amendment hereto and executed by each of the Parties.

  

  

Section 9.6 Waivers. Either Party may, at any time, (a) extend the time for
the performance of any of the obligations or other acts of the other Party,
(b) waive any inaccuracies in the representations and warranties of the other
Party contained herein or (c) waive compliance by the other Party with any of
the agreements or conditions contained herein. No waiver by any Party of any
of the provisions hereof shall be effective unless explicitly set forth in a
written instrument executed and delivered by the Party so waiving. No waiver
by any Party of any breach of this Agreement shall operate or be construed as
a waiver of any preceding or subsequent breach, whether of a similar or
different character, unless expressly set forth in such written waiver.
Neither any course of conduct or failure or delay of any Party in exercising
or enforcing any right, remedy or power hereunder shall operate or be
construed as a waiver thereof, nor shall any single or partial exercise of any
right, remedy or power hereunder, or any abandonment or discontinuance of
steps to enforce such right, remedy or power, or any course of conduct,
preclude any other or further exercise thereof or the exercise of any other
right, remedy or power.

  

  

 

 

 

  

 

58  

  

 

 

 

  

Section 9.7 Severability. If any term or provision of this Agreement is
invalid, illegal or incapable of being enforced in any situation or in any
jurisdiction, such invalidity, illegality or unenforceability shall not affect
the validity, legality or enforceability of any other term or provision hereof
or the offending term or provision in any other situation or any other
jurisdiction, so long as the economic or legal substance of the transactions
contemplated hereby is not affected in any manner materially adverse to either
Party. Upon any such determination that any term or other provision is
invalid, illegal or incapable of being enforced, the Parties shall negotiate
in good faith to modify this Agreement so as to effect the original intent of
the Parties as closely as possible, in a mutually acceptable manner, in order
that the transactions contemplated hereby be consummated as originally
contemplated to the fullest extent possible.

  

  

Section 9.8 No Third Party Beneficiaries. Except to the extent provided in
Section 5.9, 5.21, and 9.10 (the provisions of which shall inure to the
benefit of the Persons referenced therein as third-party beneficiaries of such
provisions), this Agreement shall be binding upon and inure solely to the
benefit of each Party and its successors and permitted assigns, and nothing in
this Agreement, express or implied, is intended to or shall be construed to
confer upon any other Person any legal or equitable rights, benefits or
remedies of any nature whatsoever under or by reason of this Agreement. Except
to the extent provided in Section 5.9, this Agreement may be amended or
terminated, and any provision of this Agreement may be waived, in accordance
with the terms hereof without the consent of any Person other than the
Parties.

  

  

Section 9.9 Assignment. Neither this Agreement nor any of the rights,
interests or obligations hereunder may be assigned or delegated, in whole or
in part, by either Party without the prior written consent of the other Party
except that Buyer, with the prior written consent of Sellers, not to be
unreasonably withheld, may designate one or more Affiliates as the purchaser
of the Shares, and any purported assignment or delegation in contravention of
this Section 9.9 shall be null and void and of no force and effect. Subject to
the preceding sentences of this Section 9.9, this Agreement shall be binding
upon, shall inure to the benefit of and shall be enforceable by the Parties
and their respective successors and permitted assigns.

  

  

Section 9.10 Governing Law; Submission to Jurisdiction; Waiver of Jury Trial.

  

  

(a) This Agreement and all matters, claims, controversies, disputes, suits,
actions or proceedings arising out of or relating to the negotiation,
execution or performance of this Agreement or any of the transactions
contemplated hereby, including all rights of the Parties (whether sounding in
contract, tort, common or statutory law, equity or otherwise) in connection
therewith, shall be interpreted, construed and governed by and in accordance
with, and enforced pursuant to, the internal Laws of the State of New York
without giving effect to any choice or conflict of law provision or rule
(whether of the State of New York or any other jurisdiction) that would cause
the application of the Law of any jurisdiction other than those of the State
of New York.

  

  

 

 

 

  

 

59  

  

 

 

 

  

(b) Each of the Parties hereby (i) agrees and irrevocably consents to submit
itself to the exclusive jurisdiction of the courts of the State of New York
and the federal courts of the United States of America located in the Borough
of Manhattan (collectively, the "Chosen Courts") in any Legal Proceeding
arising out of or relating to this Agreement or any of the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement (including any Legal Proceeding related to the
Financing Commitments), (ii) agrees that all claims in respect of any such
Legal Proceeding may be heard and determined in any Chosen Court, (iii) agrees
that it shall not attempt to deny or defeat such jurisdiction by motion or
other request for leave from any Chosen Court, (iv) agrees not to bring or
support any Legal Proceeding arising out of or relating to this Agreement or
any of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement (whether in contract,
tort, common or statutory law, equity or otherwise) anywhere other than the
Chosen Courts and (v) agrees that a final judgment in any such Legal
Proceeding shall be conclusive and may be enforced in other jurisdictions by
suit on the judgment or in any other manner provided by applicable Law. For
the avoidance of doubt, the preceding sentence shall not limit the
jurisdiction of the Accounting Firm as set forth in Section 2.4. Each of the
Parties waives any defense of inconvenient forum to the maintenance of any
Legal Proceeding brought in any Chosen Court in accordance with this Section
9.10(b). Each of the Parties agrees that the service of any process, summons,
notice or document in connection with any such Legal Proceeding in the manner
provided in Section 9.3 or in such other manner as may be permitted by
applicable Law, will be valid and sufficient service thereof.

  

  

(c) EACH PARTY (I) ACKNOWLEDGES AND AGREES THAT ANY LEGAL PROCEEDING THAT MAY
ARISE UNDER OR RELATE TO THIS AGREEMENT OR THE TRANSACTIONS CONTEMPLATED BY
THIS AGREEMENT IS LIKELY TO INVOLVE COMPLICATED AND DIFFICULT ISSUES AND (II)
HEREBY IRREVOCABLY AND UNCONDITIONALLY WAIVES, TO THE FULLEST EXTENT PERMITTED
BY APPLICABLE LAW, ANY RIGHT IT MAY HAVE TO A TRIAL BY JURY IN RESPECT OF ANY
LEGAL PROCEEDING ARISING OUT OF OR RELATING TO THIS AGREEMENT OR ANY OF THE
TRANSACTIONS CONTEMPLATED BY THIS AGREEMENT (INCLUDING, IN EACH CASE, ANY
LEGAL PROCEEDING RELATED TO THE FINANCING COMMITMENTS). EACH PARTY (A)
CERTIFIES AND ACKNOWLEDGES THAT NO REPRESENTATIVE OF THE OTHER PARTY HAS
REPRESENTED, EXPRESSLY OR OTHERWISE, THAT SUCH OTHER PARTY WOULD NOT, IN THE
EVENT OF ANY LEGAL PROCEEDING, SEEK TO ENFORCE THE FOREGOING WAIVER, (B)
CERTIFIES AND ACKNOWLEDGES THAT IT AND THE OTHER PARTY HAVE BEEN INDUCED TO
ENTER INTO THIS AGREEMENT BY, AMONG OTHER THINGS, THE MUTUAL WAIVERS AND
CERTIFICATIONS IN THIS SECTION OF THIS AGREEMENT, (C) UNDERSTANDS AND HAS
CONSIDERED THE IMPLICATIONS OF THIS WAIVER AND (D) MAKES THIS WAIVER
VOLUNTARILY.

  

  

This Section 9.10 is intended to be for the benefit of, and shall be
enforceable by, the lenders with respect to the Financing Commitments and
their respective successors and assigns.

  

  

 

 

 

  

 

60  

  

 

 

 

  

Section 9.11 Remedies. The Parties agree that irreparable damage would occur
in the event that any provision of this Agreement were not performed in
accordance with its terms and that, although monetary damages may be available
for such a breach, monetary damages would be an inadequate remedy therefor.
Accordingly, each of the Parties agrees that, in the event of any breach or
threatened breach of any provision of this Agreement by such Party, the other
Party shall be entitled to an injunction or injunctions, specific performance
and other equitable relief to prevent or restrain breaches or threatened
breaches hereof and to specifically enforce the terms and provisions hereof. A
Party seeking any order or injunction to prevent breaches of this Agreement or
to enforce specifically the terms and provisions hereof shall not be required
to provide, furnish or post any bond or other security in connection with or
as a condition to obtaining any such order or injunction, and each Party
hereby irrevocably waives any right it may have to require the provision,
furnishing or posting of any such bond or other security. In the event that
any Legal Proceeding should be brought in equity to enforce the provisions of
this Agreement, each Party agrees that it shall not allege, and each Party
hereby waives the defense, that there is an adequate remedy at law.

  

  

Section 9.12 Interpretation; Construction.

  

  

(a) The table of contents, articles, titles and headings to sections herein
are inserted for convenience of reference only and are not intended to be a
part of or to affect the meaning or interpretation of this Agreement. Except
as otherwise indicated, all references in this Agreement to "Articles",
"Sections", "Disclosure Schedules" and "Exhibits" are intended to refer to
Articles and Sections of this Agreement and Schedules and Exhibits to this
Agreement. The Seller Disclosure Schedules and Exhibits referred to herein
shall be construed with and as an integral part of this Agreement to the same
extent as if they were set forth verbatim herein. Any capitalized terms used
in the Seller Disclosure Schedules, any Exhibit or any Ancillary Agreement but
not otherwise defined therein shall be defined as set forth in this Agreement
unless the context otherwise requires. Notwithstanding any other provision in
this Agreement to the contrary, in the event and to the extent that there
shall be a conflict between the provisions of this Agreement and the
provisions of any Ancillary Agreement, the provisions of this Agreement shall
control (unless the Ancillary Agreement explicitly provides otherwise).

  

  

(b) For purposes of this Agreement: (i) "include," "includes" or "including"
shall be deemed to be followed by "without limitation"; (ii) "hereof,"
"herein", "hereby", "hereto" and "hereunder" shall refer to this Agreement as
a whole and not to any particular provision of this Agreement; (iii) "extent"
in the phrase "to the extent" shall mean the degree to which a subject or
other item extends and shall not simply mean "if"; (iv) "Dollars" and "$"
shall mean United States Dollars; (v) the singular includes the plural and
vice versa; (vi) reference to a gender includes the other gender; (vii) "any"
shall mean "any and all"; (viii) "or" is used in the inclusive sense of
"and/or"; (ix) reference to any agreement, document or instrument means such
agreement, document or instrument as amended, supplemented and modified in
effect from time to time in accordance with its terms; and (x) reference to
any Law means such Law as amended from time to time and includes any successor
legislation thereto and any regulations promulgated thereunder.

  

  

(c) Neither the specification of any dollar amount in any representation or
warranty contained in this Agreement nor the inclusion of any specific item in
the Seller Disclosure Schedules is intended to imply that such amount, or
higher or lower amounts, or the item so included or other items, are or are
not material, and no Party shall use the fact of the setting forth of any such
amount or the inclusion of any such item in any dispute or controversy between
the Parties as to whether any obligation, item or matter not described herein
or included in the Seller Disclosure Schedules is or is not material for
purposes of this Agreement. Unless this Agreement specifically provides
otherwise, neither the specification of any item or matter in any
representation or warranty contained in this Agreement nor the inclusion of
any specific item in the Seller Disclosure Schedules is intended to imply that
such item or matter, or other items or matters, are or are not in the ordinary
course of business, and no Party shall use the fact of the setting forth or
the inclusion of any such item or matter in any dispute or controversy between
the Parties as to whether any obligation, item or matter not described herein
or included in the Seller Disclosure Schedules is or is not in the ordinary
course of business for purposes of this Agreement.

  

  

 

 

 

  

 

61  

  

 

 

 

  

(d) The language used in this Agreement shall be deemed to be the language
chosen by the Parties to express their mutual intent. The Parties have
participated jointly in the negotiation and drafting of this Agreement with
the benefit of competent legal representation and, in the event that an
ambiguity or question of intent or interpretation arises, this Agreement shall
be construed as if drafted jointly by the Parties, and no presumption or
burden of proof shall arise favoring or disfavoring either Party by virtue of
the authorship of any provisions hereof.

  

  

(e) The Seller Disclosure Schedules shall be arranged in sections that
correspond to the Sections of this Agreement to which such sections of the
Seller Disclosure Schedules relate; provided, however, that the disclosure of
any information in any section of the Seller Disclosure Schedules shall also
constitute disclosure for purposes of all other Sections of this Agreement
with respect to which such disclosure is applicable or relevant.

  

  

Section 9.13 Counterparts and Electronic Signatures. This Agreement and any
Ancillary Agreements may be executed in one or more counterparts, each of
which shall be deemed to be an original and all of which, when taken together,
shall be deemed to be one and the same agreement or document. A signed copy of
this Agreement or any Ancillary Agreement transmitted by facsimile, email or
other means of electronic transmission shall be deemed to have the same legal
effect as delivery of an original executed copy of this Agreement or such
Ancillary Agreement for all purposes.

  

  

Section 9.14 Time is of the Essence. Time is of the essence in the performance
of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement.
