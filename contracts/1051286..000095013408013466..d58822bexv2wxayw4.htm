of uncertificated Common Stock (&#147;<U>Uncertificated Shares</U>&#148;) outstanding immediately prior to
the Effective Time. Prior to the Effective Time, Parent shall deposit or cause the Surviving
Corporation to deposit with the Exchange Agent, for the benefit of the holders of the Certificates
and the Uncertificated Shares, cash in an amount sufficient to pay the aggregate Merger
Consideration required to be paid pursuant to <U>Section&nbsp;2.06(c)</U>. Any funds deposited with
the Exchange Agent pursuant to this <U>Section&nbsp;2.07(a)</U> shall hereinafter be referred to as the

after the Effective Time, Parent shall cause the Exchange Agent to mail to each Company Stockholder
of record whose shares of Common Stock were converted into the right to receive the Merger
Consideration (i)&nbsp;a form of letter of transmittal (which shall specify that delivery shall be
effected, and risk of loss and title shall pass, only upon proper delivery of the Certificates or
transfer of the Uncertificated Shares to the Exchange Agent and which shall be in customary form
and contain customary provisions) and (ii)&nbsp;instructions to effect the surrender of the Certificates
or transfer of the Uncertificated Shares in exchange for the Merger Consideration. Each Company
Stockholder of record shall, upon surrender or transfer to the Exchange Agent of the Common Stock,
together with such duly executed letter of transmittal and such other documents as may reasonably
be required by the Exchange Agent, be entitled to receive in exchange therefor the amount of cash
to which such holder is entitled pursuant to
