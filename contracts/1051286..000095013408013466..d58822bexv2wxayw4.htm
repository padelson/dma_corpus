 (a) _Capital Stock of Merger Sub_. Each issued and outstanding share of capital stock of Merger Sub shall be converted into and become one validly issued, fully paid and nonassessable share of common stock, par value $0.0001 per share, of the Surviving Corporation. 

   

 (b) _Cancellation of Treasury Stock and Parent-Owned Stock_. Each share of Common Stock that is directly owned by the Company (other than shares held in the Rabbi Trust), Parent or Merger Sub immediately prior to the Effective Time shall automatically be canceled and shall cease to exist, and no consideration shall be delivered in exchange therefor. Any shares of Common Stock that are owned by a wholly owned Subsidiary of Parent (other than Merger Sub) or the Company shall remain outstanding after the Effective Time, appropriately adjusted such that such Subsidiary owns the same percentage of the Company after the Merger as it owned immediately prior to the Merger. 

   

 (c) _Merger Consideration_. Each share of Common Stock issued and outstanding (including shares held in the Rabbi Trust) immediately prior to the Effective Time (other than shares to be canceled or to remain outstanding in accordance with _Section 2.06(b)_ and any Dissenting Shares) shall be converted into the right to receive an amount of cash, without interest, equal to the Merger Consideration, payable to the holder thereof. At the Effective Time, all such shares of Common Stock shall no longer be outstanding and shall automatically be canceled and shall cease to exist, and each holder of such shares of Common Stock immediately prior to the Effective Time shall cease to have any rights with respect thereto, except the right to receive the Merger Consideration paid in consideration therefor upon surrender of such interest in accordance with _Section 2.07(b)_. The right of any Company Stockholder to receive the Merger Consideration shall be subject to and reduced by the amount of any withholding that is required under applicable Tax Law. 

    ##### 

  

     

 (d) _Dissenting Shares_. 

   

 (i) Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the contrary, shares of Common Stock outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time and held by a holder who is entitled to and properly demands appraisal of such shares (" _Dissenting Shares_ ") pursuant to, and who complies in all respects with, Section 262 of the DGCL (the " _Dissenters  Provisions_") shall be entitled to payment of the fair value of such Dissenting Shares in accordance with the Dissenters Provisions; _provided_ , however, that if any such holder shall fail to perfect or otherwise shall waive, withdraw or lose the right to dissent under the Dissenters Provisions, then the right of such holder to be paid the fair value of such holders Dissenting Shares shall cease and such Dissenting Shares shall be deemed to have been converted as of the Effective Time into, and to have become exchangeable solely for the right to receive, the Merger Consideration (payable without any interest thereon). 

  

 (ii) The Company shall promptly notify Parent of any demands received by the Company for dissenters rights of any shares of Common Stock, and Parent shall have the right to participate in all negotiations and proceedings with respect to such demands. Prior to the Effective Time, the Company shall not, without the prior written consent of Parent, make any payment with respect to, or settle or compromise or offer to settle or compromise, any such demand, or agree to do any of the foregoing. 

  

 Section 2.07. _Exchange of Shares_. 

  

 (a) _Exchange Agent_. Prior to the Effective Time, Parent shall appoint a bank or trust company that is reasonably satisfactory to the Company to act as exchange agent (the " _Exchange Agent_ ") for the payment of the Merger Consideration for the benefit of the holders of (i) certificates representing shares of Common Stock (the " _Certificates_ ") and (ii) shares of uncertificated Common Stock (" _Uncertificated Shares_ ") outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time. Prior to the Effective Time, Parent shall deposit or cause the Surviving Corporation to deposit with the Exchange Agent, for the benefit of the holders of the Certificates and the Uncertificated Shares, cash in an amount sufficient to pay the aggregate Merger Consideration required to be paid pursuant to _Section 2.06(c)_. Any funds deposited with the Exchange Agent pursuant to this _Section 2.07(a)_ shall hereinafter be referred to as the " _Exchange Fund_." The Exchange Fund shall not be used for any other purpose. 

   

 (b) _Exchange Procedures_. Promptly (and in any event within five (5) Business Days) after the Effective Time, Parent shall cause the Exchange Agent to mail to each Company Stockholder of record whose shares of Common Stock were converted into the right to receive the Merger Consideration (i) a form of letter of transmittal (which shall specify that delivery shall be effected, and risk of loss and title shall pass, only upon proper delivery of the Certificates or transfer of the Uncertificated Shares to the Exchange Agent and which shall be in customary form and contain customary provisions) and (ii) instructions to effect the surrender of the Certificates or transfer of the Uncertificated Shares in exchange for the Merger Consideration. Each Company Stockholder of record shall, upon surrender or transfer to the Exchange Agent of the Common Stock, together with such duly executed letter of transmittal and such other documents as may reasonably be required by the Exchange Agent, be entitled to receive in exchange therefor the amount of cash to which such holder is entitled pursuant to 

    ##### 

  

    

 _Section 2.06(c)_. In the event of a transfer of ownership of Common Stock
that is not registered in the transfer records of the Company, payment of the
Merger Consideration in accordance with this _Section 2.07(b)_ may be made
to a Person other than the Person in whose name the Certificate so
surrendered is registered if such Certificate shall be properly endorsed
or otherwise be in proper form for transfer and the Person requesting such
payment shall pay any transfer Taxes required by reason of the payment of the
Merger Consideration to a Person other than the registered holder of such
Certificate or establish to the reasonable satisfaction of Parent that such
Taxes have been paid or are not applicable. Until surrendered as contemplated
by this  _Section 2.07(b)_, each Certificate or Uncertificated Share shall
be deemed at any time after the Effective Time to represent only the right to
receive the Merger Consideration upon surrender. No interest shall be paid or
will accrue on any payment to holders of Certificates or Uncertificated
Shares pursuant to the provisions of this Article II. 

   

 (c) _No Further Ownership Rights in Common Stock_. The Merger Consideration paid upon the surrender of shares of Common Stock in accordance with the terms of this Article II shall be deemed to have been paid in full satisfaction of all rights pertaining to such shares of Common Stock. At the close of business on the day on which the Effective Time occurs, the share transfer books of the Company shall be closed, and there shall be no further registration of transfers on the share transfer books of the Surviving Corporation of the shares of Common Stock outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time. 

   

 (d) _Termination of the Exchange Fund_. Any portion of the Exchange Fund that remains undistributed to the Company Stockholders on the date that is one (1) year after the Effective Time shall be delivered to Parent, upon demand, and any Company Stockholders who have not theretofore complied with this Article II shall thereafter look only to Parent for, and Parent shall remain liable for, payment of their claim for the Merger Consideration in accordance with this Article II. 

   

 (e) _No Liability_. None of Parent, Merger Sub, the Company, the Surviving Corporation or the Exchange Agent shall be liable to any Person in respect of any funds from the Exchange Fund properly delivered to a public official pursuant to any applicable abandoned property, escheat or similar Law. 

   

 (f) _Investment of Exchange Fund_. The Exchange Agent shall invest the cash in the Exchange Fund as directed by Parent; _provided_ that such investments shall be in obligations of, or guaranteed by, the United States or of any agency thereof and backed by the full faith and credit of the United States, in commercial paper obligations rated A-1 or P-1 or better by Moodys Investors Service, Inc. or Standard and Poors Corporation, respectively, or in deposit accounts, certificates of deposit or bankers acceptances of, repurchase or reverse repurchase agreements with, or Eurodollar time deposits purchased from, commercial banks with capital, surplus and undivided profits aggregating in excess of $500 million (based on the most recent financial statements of such bank that are then publicly available at the SEC or otherwise). Any interest and other income resulting from such investments shall be paid to and be income of Parent. If for any reason (including losses), the cash in the Exchange Fund shall be insufficient to fully satisfy all of the payment obligations to be made in cash by the Exchange Agent hereunder, Parent shall, or shall cause the Surviving Corporation to, promptly deposit cash into the Exchange Fund in the amount required to fully satisfy such cash payment obligations. 

    ##### 

  

     

 (g) _Lost Certificates_. If any Certificate shall have been lost, stolen or destroyed, upon the making of an affidavit of that fact by the Person (who shall be the record owner of such Certificate) claiming such Certificate to be lost, stolen or destroyed, and, if required by the Exchange Agent or Parent, the posting by such Person of a bond in customary amount and upon such terms as may be required as indemnity against any claim that may be made against them or the Surviving Corporation with respect to such Certificate, the Exchange Agent shall deliver in exchange for such lost, stolen or destroyed Certificate the Merger Consideration pursuant to this Article II. 

   

 (h) _Withholding Rights_. Each of Parent, the Surviving Corporation or the Exchange Agent shall be entitled to deduct and withhold from the consideration otherwise payable pursuant to this Agreement such amounts as it reasonably determines that it is required to deduct and withhold with respect to the making of such payment under the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the " _Code_ "), or any provision of state, local or foreign Tax Law. To the extent that amounts are so withheld and paid over to the appropriate Taxing Authority by Parent, the Surviving Corporation or the Exchange Agent, such withheld amounts shall be treated for all purposes of this Agreement as having been paid to the Company Stockholder in respect of which such deduction and withholding was made by Parent, the Surviving Corporation or the Exchange Agent. 

   

 Section 2.08. _Company Stock-Based Awards_. 

  

 (a) As of the Effective Time, by virtue of the Merger and without any action on the part of the holders thereof, each Company Stock Option outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time, whether or not vested or exercisable, shall be cancelled and the holder thereof shall be entitled to receive at the Effective Time from the Surviving Corporation an amount of cash, without interest, equal to the product of (i) the total number of shares subject to such Company Stock Option, multiplied by (ii) the excess, if any, of the Merger Consideration over the exercise price per share of such Company Stock Option (with the aggregate amount of such payment to the holder to be rounded to the nearest cent), less the amount of any withholding required under applicable Tax Law. 

   

 (b) As of the Effective Time, by virtue of the Merger and without any action on the part of the holders thereof, each outstanding Performance Share Award and Performance-Based Restricted Stock Unit Award outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time shall be cancelled and the holder thereof shall be entitled to receive at the Effective Time from the Surviving Corporation an amount of cash, without interest, equal to the product of (i) the target number of shares or units underlying such award, multiplied by (ii) the Merger Consideration (with the aggregate amount of such payment to the holder to be rounded to the nearest cent), less the amount of any withholding required under applicable Tax Law. 

   

 (c) As of the Effective Time, by virtue of the Merger and without any action on the part of the participants therein, the phantom stock units (" _Phantom Stock Units_ ") credited to each participants account under the Second Amended and Restated EnergySouth, Inc. Non-Employee Directors Deferred Fee Plan and the 2005 Non-Employee Directors Deferred Fee Plan (" _Deferred Fee Plans_ ") shall be converted into a dollar amount equal to the product of (i) the number of Phantom Stock Units credited to such participants account, multiplied by (ii) the 

   ##### 

  

   

Merger Consideration (with such amount to be rounded to the nearest cent). As
of the Effective Time, such dollar amount shall be credited to such
participants cash account under the applicable Deferred Fee Plan, and the
Phantom Stock Units shall be debited from such participants plan account. As
of the Effective Time and thereafter, such participants account shall
be credited with interest when and as provided in the applicable Deferred Fee
Plan and distributable in cash in accordance with the participants
distribution election and the terms and conditions of the Deferred Fee Plans.
Prior to the Effective Time, the Company shall amend the Deferred Fee Plans
to provide that, as of the Effective Time and thereafter, no further Phantom
Stock Units shall be credited to the accounts of participants and the
accounts of participants shall be distributable only in the form of cash. 

   

 (d) Prior to the Effective Time, the Board of Directors of the Company (or the appropriate committee thereof) shall take or cause to be taken all actions necessary to effectuate this  _Section 2.08_ to the extent such treatment is not expressly provided for by the terms of the applicable Stock Plans and related award agreements, Contracts or participant election forms, including, without limitation, the adoption of any necessary amendments to the Stock Plans. Prior to the Effective Time and as soon as administratively practicable, the Company shall use commercially reasonable efforts to obtain from each holder of Company Stock Options granted under the Amended and Restated Stock Option Plan of EnergySouth, Inc. and the 2003 Stock Option Plan of EnergySouth, Inc. a written consent and release (in a form reasonably acceptable to Parent) providing for the treatment of such Company Stock Options as provided under _Section 2.08(a)_ hereof, which Section 2.08(a) will govern regardless of whether a particular holder of a Company Stock Option delivers such a consent. 

   

 (e) Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the contrary, if the Effective Time occurs prior to November 15, 2008, immediately prior to the Effective Time, the Company shall pay any amounts due to each employee then actively employed by the Company or a Company Subsidiary under an outstanding award granted under the Companys Executive Incentive Compensation Plan or Employee Incentive Compensation Plan with respect to the full fiscal year ending on September 30, 2008. The amount of each such payment shall be reasonably consistent with the intent of the Companys Executive Incentive Compensation Plan or Employee Incentive Compensation Plan, as determined in the exercise of reasonable good faith discretion by the Compensation Committee of the Board of Directors with regard to the Executive Incentive Compensation Plan and by the President and Chief Executive Officer of the Company with regard to the Employee Incentive Compensation Plan; provided, that the aggregate amount of such payments under both such Plans shall not exceed $4,800,000. In the event the Effective Time occurs on or after November 15, 2008, immediately prior to the Effective Time, the Company shall pay to each employee any amounts due such employee under the terms and conditions of such an award and the Executive Incentive Compensation Plan or Employee Incentive Compensation Plan for the full fiscal year ending September 30, 2008; provided, that the aggregate amount of such payments under both such Plans shall not exceed $4,800,000. For the avoidance of doubt, the $4,800,000 cap on payments described above under this  _Section 2.08(e)_ shall be exclusive of the bonus pool funding the Team Performance Awards, as defined in the Employment Agreements, effective April 2, 2007, between EnergySouth Midstream, Inc. and Ben J. Reese, W. Todd Brown and John A. Pirraglia, which Team Performance Awards shall be paid in accordance with such Employment Agreements. Not less than five (5) Business Days prior to the determination of the amounts of such payments by the 

   ##### 

  

   

Compensation Committee of the Board of Directors of the Company (in the case
of the Executive Incentive Compensation Plan), or the Chief Executive Officer
of the Company (in the case of the Employee Incentive Compensation Plan), as
applicable, the Company shall provide to Parent a schedule setting forth the
employees to whom the payments described in this _Section 2.08(e)_ are to be
made, and the amount of each such payment. For purposes of any employment
agreement entered into between the Company or a Company Subsidiary and such
an employee, such payment shall be deemed full payment of such employees
annual incentive award pursuant to the terms of such employees employment
agreement. 

   

 Section 2.09. _Adjustments to Prevent Dilution_. In the event that the Company changes the number of shares of Common Stock or securities convertible or exchangeable into or exercisable for shares of Common Stock issued and outstanding prior to the Effective Time as a result of a reclassification, stock split (including a reverse stock split), stock dividend or distribution, recapitalization, merger, issuer tender or exchange offer, or other similar transaction, the Merger Consideration shall be equitably adjusted.

During the period from the date of this Agreement to the Effective Time, the Company shall, and shall cause each of the Company Subsidiaries to, (i) timely file all material Tax Returns (taking into account any applicable extensions) required to be filed by or on behalf of each such entity; (ii) timely pay all material Taxes due and payable; (iii) promptly notify Parent of any material Actions that become pending against or with respect to the Company or any of its Subsidiaries in respect of any amount of Tax and not settle or compromise any material Tax liability without Parents prior written consent, which shall not be unreasonably withheld or delayed; and (iv) not make or change any material Tax election, change any annual accounting period, adopt or change any accounting method or practice with respect to Taxes, enter into any closing agreement, surrender any right to claim a refund of Taxes, or consent to any extension or waiver of the limitation period applicable to any Tax claim or assessment relating to the Company or the Company Subsidiaries, other than with Parents prior written consent (which shall not be unreasonably withheld or delayed), other than in the ordinary course of business consistent with past practice, or other than as may be necessary to conform to changes in Tax Laws. Any Tax Returns described in this _Section 5.01(d)_ shall be complete and correct in all material respects and shall be prepared on a basis consistent with the past practice of the Company, except as may be necessary to conform to changes in Tax Laws. The Company shall notify Parent upon the filing of any such material Tax Return and shall make such Tax Returns available to Parent. 

   

 (e) _Maintenance of Control of Operations_. Nothing contained in this Agreement (including, without limitation, this _Section 5.01_) is intended to give Parent or Merger Sub, directly or indirectly, the right to control or direct the Companys or any of the Company Subsidiaries operations prior to the Effective Time, and nothing contained in this Agreement is intended to give the Company, directly or indirectly, the right to control or direct Parents or any of its Subsidiaries operations. Prior to the Effective Time, each of Parent, Merger Sub and the Company shall exercise, consistent with the terms and conditions of this Agreement, complete control and supervision over its and its Subsidiaries respective operations. 

   

 Section 5.02. _No Solicitation_. 

  

 (a) Except as set forth in this _Section 5.02_, until the earlier of the Effective Time or the termination of this Agreement pursuant to _Article VIII_, the Company shall not, and shall not authorize or permit the Company Subsidiaries or any of their respective directors, officers, employees, advisors, agents, representatives or controlled Affiliates (collectively, " _Representatives_ ") to, directly or indirectly, (i) solicit, initiate, knowingly encourage or knowingly facilitate any Takeover Proposal or the making thereof, (ii) enter into, continue or otherwise participate in any discussions or negotiations regarding, or furnish to any Person any information in connection with, or otherwise cooperate in any way with, any Takeover Proposal or (iii) waive, terminate, modify or fail to enforce any provision of any contractual "standstill" or similar obligation of any Person other than Parent. The Company shall, and shall cause the Company Subsidiaries to, immediately cease and cause to be terminated all existing discussions or negotiations with any Person conducted heretofore with respect to any Takeover Proposal, terminate any and all Persons (other than Parent and its Affiliates) access to the Companys electronic data room and request the prompt return or destruction of all confidential information previously furnished or provided to any such Person in connection with any applicable confidentiality agreement. Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement, in response to a written 

   ##### 

  

   

Takeover Proposal that the Board of Directors of the Company or any committee
thereof reasonably determines in good faith is _bona_ _fide_ and (after
consultation with outside counsel and a financial advisor of nationally
recognized reputation) is, or is reasonably likely to result in, a Superior
Proposal, and which Takeover Proposal was made after the date hereof and was
not the result of a material breach by the Company of this _Section
5.02(a)_, the Company may (A) furnish information with respect to the Company
and the Company Subsidiaries to the Person making such Takeover Proposal (and
its Representatives) pursuant to a confidentiality agreement containing
confidentiality provisions, not less restrictive to such Person than
the provisions of the Confidentiality Agreement are to Parent; _provided_
that all such information has previously been provided to Parent or is
provided to Parent prior to or substantially concurrent with the time it is
provided to such Person, and (B) participate in discussions or negotiations
with the Person making such Takeover Proposal (and its
Representatives) regarding such Takeover Proposal, if and only to the extent
that in connection with the foregoing clauses (A) and (B), the Board of
Directors of the Company concludes in good faith (after consultation with its
outside counsel and a financial advisor of nationally recognized
reputation) that the failure to take such action would be inconsistent with
its fiduciary duties under applicable Law. 

   

 The term " _Takeover Proposal_ " means any inquiry, proposal or offer from any Person (other than Parent and its Affiliates) relating to, or that could reasonably be expected to lead to, any direct or indirect acquisition or purchase, in one transaction or a series of transactions, of assets (including equity securities of any Company Subsidiary) or businesses that constitute 20% or more of the revenues, net income or assets of the Company and the Company Subsidiaries, taken as a whole, or 20% or more of any class of equity securities of the Company, any tender offer or exchange offer that if consummated would result in any Person beneficially owning 20% or more of any class of equity securities of the Company, or any merger, consolidation, business combination, recapitalization, liquidation, dissolution, joint venture, share exchange or similar transaction involving the Company or the Company Subsidiaries pursuant to which any Person or the equityholders of any Person would own 20% or more of any class of equity securities of the Company or of any resulting parent company of the Company, in each case other than the Transactions. For purposes of this definition, a Person shall also mean any group (as defined in Rule 13d-5 under the Exchange Act) of Persons (other than Parent and its Affiliates). 

  

 The term " _Superior Proposal_ " means any bona fide Takeover Proposal (with all percentages in the definition of Takeover Proposal changed to 50%) made in writing and not the result of a violation of _Section 5.02(a)_ that the Board of Directors of the Company reasonably determines in good faith (after consultation with outside counsel and a financial advisor of nationally recognized reputation) to be: (i) more favorable to the Company Stockholders from a financial point of view than the Transactions, and (ii) reasonably likely to be completed on the terms proposed, taking into account all financial, legal, regulatory and other aspects of such proposal, in each case of clauses (i) and (ii), after taking into account any written proposal by Parent in response to such Takeover Proposal or any written proposal by Parent to amend the terms of the Transactions. 

  

 (b) Except as set forth in this _Section 5.02_, until the earlier of the time that the Stockholder Approval is received or the termination of this Agreement pursuant to Article VIII, neither the Board of Directors of the Company nor any committee thereof shall (i) (A) withdraw, modify or qualify the Company Recommendation in any manner adverse to Parent, (B) take any 

   ##### 

  

   

other action or make any public statement in connection with the Company
Recommendation, the Merger or the Company Stockholders Meeting that is
inconsistent with the Company Recommendation, or fail to make the Company
Recommendation in the Proxy Statement or (C) adopt or recommend, or propose
publicly to adopt or recommend, any Takeover Proposal (any action described in
this clause (i) being referred to as a " _Company Adverse Recommendation
Change_ "), or (ii) adopt or recommend, or publicly propose to adopt or
recommend, or approve the Companys or the Company Subsidiaries execution or
entry into, any letter of intent, memorandum of understanding, agreement in
principle, merger agreement, acquisition agreement, option agreement, joint
venture agreement, partnership agreement or other similar Contract
constituting or related to, or that is intended to or could reasonably be
expected to lead to, any Takeover Proposal (other than a
confidentiality agreement referred to in _Section 5.02(a)_) (an "
_Acquisition Agreement_ "). 

   

 (c) Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the contrary, at any time prior to the time that the Stockholder Approval is received and subject to _Section 5.02(e)_, the Board of Directors of the Company may make a Company Adverse Recommendation Change: (i) in response to a material development or change in material circumstances occurring or arising after the date hereof, the existence and material consequences of which were not known to the Companys Board of Directors as of or prior to the date hereof (and not relating to any Takeover Proposal), if the Board of Directors of the Company concludes in good faith, after consultation with its outside counsel, that the failure of the Board of Directors to make a Company Adverse Recommendation Change would be inconsistent with its fiduciary duties under applicable Law or (ii) in response to a Takeover Proposal, if the Board of Directors of the Company concludes that such Takeover Proposal constitutes a Superior Proposal, and such Takeover Proposal was made after the date hereof and was not the result of a material breach of this _Section 5.02_. If the Board of Directors of the Company makes a Company Adverse Recommendation Change pursuant to _Section 5.02(c)(ii)_, the Company may terminate this Agreement pursuant to _Section 8.01(f),_ and enter into an Acquisition Agreement, if the Board of Directors of the Company has concluded in good faith, after consultation with its outside counsel, that, in light of such Superior Proposal, the failure of the Board of Directors to terminate this Agreement would be inconsistent with its fiduciary duties under applicable Law; provided, however, that the Board of Directors of the Company (including any committee thereof) may not effect a Company Adverse Recommendation Change as contemplated in  _Section 5.02(c)(ii)_ and/or terminate this Agreement pursuant to _Section 8.01(f)_ unless: 

   

 (A) the Company shall have provided prior written notice to Parent and Merger Sub, at least four (4) Business Days in advance (the " _Notice Period_ "), of its intention to effect a Company Adverse Recommendation Change in response to a Superior Proposal and/or to terminate this Agreement to enter into a definitive agreement with respect to such Superior Proposal, which notice shall specify the material terms and conditions of any such Superior Proposal, and contemporaneously with providing such notice shall have provided a copy of the relevant proposed transaction agreements with the party making such Superior Proposal and any other materials submitted therewith; and 

  

 (B) prior to effecting such Company Adverse Recommendation Change in response to a Superior Proposal and/or terminating this Agreement to enter into a definitive agreement with respect to such Superior Proposal, if requested by Parent the Company 

   ##### 

  

    

shall, and shall cause its legal and financial advisors to, during the Notice
Period, negotiate with Parent and Merger Sub in good faith (to the extent
Parent and Merger Sub desire to negotiate) to make such adjustments to the
terms and conditions of this Agreement so that such Takeover Proposal ceases
to constitute a Superior Proposal. 

  

In the event that during the Notice Period any revisions are made to the
Superior Proposal to which the proviso in this _Section 5.02(c)_ applies and
the Board of Directors of the Company in its good faith judgment determines
such revisions are material (it being agreed that any change in the purchase
price in such Superior Proposal shall be deemed a material revision), the
Company shall be required to deliver a new written notice to Parent and
Merger Sub and to comply with the requirements of this _Section 5.02(c)_
with respect to such new written notice except that the Notice Period shall
be reduced to two (2) Business Days. 

  

 (d) In addition to the obligations of the Company set forth in subsections (a) through (c) of this _Section 5.02_, the Company shall (i) promptly (and in any event within 24 hours of learning of the relevant information) advise Parent orally and in writing of the receipt of any Takeover Proposal, the material terms and conditions of any such Takeover Proposal (including any changes thereto) and the identity of the Person making any such Takeover Proposal, (ii) keep Parent informed in all material respects of the status and details (including any change to the material terms thereof) of any Takeover Proposal and (iii) publicly reaffirm the Company Recommendation within ten (10) Business Days of receipt of a written request by Parent to provide such reaffirmation, unless a Company Adverse Recommendation Change is permitted by  _Section 5.02(c)_. 

   

 (e) Nothing contained in this _Section 5.02_ shall prohibit the Company or the Board of Directors of the Company from at any time taking and disclosing to the Company Stockholders a position contemplated by Rule 14e-2(a) under the Exchange Act or making a statement required under Rule 14d-9 under the Exchange Act or other applicable Law; _provided_ , however, that in no event shall the Company or the Board of Directors of the Company or any committee thereof take, or agree or resolve to take, any action prohibited by _Section 5.02(b)_.

 (c) In addition to and not in limitation of the covenants of the parties contained in  _Sections 6.03(a)_ and _(b)_ , each party hereto shall use its best efforts (in each case to the extent permitted under applicable Law) to resolve such objections, if any, as may be asserted with respect to the Transactions under any Antitrust Law, including agreeing to take or cause its Subsidiaries to take any action or agree to take any action or consent to the taking of any action not inconsistent with this _Section 6.03(c)_.

proceeding and to have vacated, lifted, reversed or overturned any decree,
judgment, injunction or other order, whether temporary, preliminary or

 Section 6.04. _Indemnification, Exculpation and Insurance_. 

  

 (a) As of the Effective Time, Parent shall, and shall cause the Surviving Corporation to, indemnify and hold harmless the current and former directors and officers of the Company and the Company Subsidiaries in respect of acts or omissions occurring at or prior to the Effective Time to the fullest extent permitted by Law or as provided in the Company Certificate, the Company Bylaws, the organizational documents of any Company Subsidiary or any written indemnification Contract between such directors or officers and the Company (in each case, as in effect on the date hereof). Such obligations shall survive the Merger and shall continue in full force and effect in accordance with their terms. From the Effective Time through the sixth (6th) anniversary of the date on which the Effective Time occurs, the certificate of incorporation and bylaws of the Surviving Corporation shall contain, and Parent shall cause the certificate of incorporation and bylaws of the Surviving Corporation to contain, provisions no less favorable with respect to indemnification, advancement of expenses and exculpation of present and former directors and officers of the Company and the Company Subsidiaries for acts or omissions occurring at or prior to the Effective Time than are presently set forth in the Company Certificate and Company Bylaws, and such provisions shall not be amended, repealed, or otherwise modified in any manner that could adversely affect the rights thereunder of any Person benefited by such provisions. Parent hereby unconditionally guarantees the obligations of the Surviving Corporation under this  _Section 6.04_. 

   

 (b) In the event that the Surviving Corporation or any of its successors or assigns (i) consolidates with or merges into any other Person and is not the continuing or surviving corporation or entity of such consolidation or merger or (ii) transfers or conveys all or substantially all of its properties and other assets to any Person, then, and in each such case, Parent shall cause proper provision to be made so that the successors and assigns of the Surviving Corporation shall expressly assume the obligations set forth in this _Section 6.04_. 

   

 (c) The Company shall use commercially reasonable efforts to purchase, prior to the Effective Time, and if the Company does not so purchase, Parent shall or shall cause the Surviving Corporation to purchase promptly after the Effective Time a six-year "tail" prepaid policy on the Companys directors and officers liability insurance policy covering each person currently covered by the Companys directors and officers liability insurance policy, on terms with respect to such coverage and amounts no less favorable than those of such policy in effect on the date hereof. Following the Effective Time, Parent shall or shall cause the Surviving Corporation to maintain such "tail" policy in full force and effect and to continue to honor its obligations thereunder. If the Company, Parent and the Surviving Corporation for any reason fail to obtain such "tail" policy as of or promptly after, as applicable, the Effective Time, Parent shall, or shall cause the Surviving Corporation to, maintain (directly or indirectly through the Companys existing insurance programs) in effect the Companys current directors and officers liability insurance in respect of acts or omissions occurring at or prior to the Effective Time, covering each person currently covered by the Companys directors and officers liability 

   ##### 

  

   

insurance policy (a complete and accurate copy of which has been previously
delivered to Parent), on terms with respect to such coverage and amounts no
less favorable than those of such policy in effect on the date hereof;
_provided_ , however, that Parent may (i) substitute policies of Parent
containing terms with respect to coverage (including with respect to
deductibles and exclusions) and amounts no less favorable to such directors
and officers or (ii) request that the Company obtain such extended reporting
period coverage under its existing insurance programs, to be effective as of
the Effective Time, or, if such insurance is unavailable, the
Surviving Corporation shall, and Parent shall cause the Surviving Corporation
to, purchase the best available coverage (including with respect to
deductibles and exclusions) for such six-year period from an insurance
carrier with the same or better credit rating as the Companys current
insurance carrier with respect to the Companys existing directors and
officers liability insurance with terms, conditions, retentions and with
levels of coverage at least as favorable as provided in the Companys
existing policies as of the date of this Agreement. Notwithstanding anything
in the foregoing, in no event shall Parent or the Surviving Corporation be
required to expend for such policies an annual premium amount in excess of
300% of the annual premiums currently paid by the Company for such insurance;
and _provided_ _further_ , that if the annual premiums of such insurance
coverage exceed such amount, the Surviving Corporation shall obtain a policy
with the greatest coverage available for a cost not exceeding such amount. 

   

 (d) The provisions of this _Section 6.04_ (i) are intended to be for the benefit of, and will be enforceable by, each indemnified party, his or her heirs and his or her representatives and (ii) are in addition to, and not in substitution for, any other rights to indemnification or contribution that any such Person may have by Contract or otherwise. 

   

 Section 6.05. _Fees and Expenses_. 

  

 (a) Except as otherwise provided in this _Section 6.05_, all fees and expenses incurred in connection with this Agreement, the Merger and the other Transactions shall be paid by the party incurring such fees or expenses, whether or not the Merger is consummated.

 (c) In the event that this Agreement is terminated by the Company pursuant to _Section 8.01(f)_ , then the Company shall pay Parent the Termination Fee by wire transfer of same-day funds concurrently with such termination. 

   

 (d) In the event that this Agreement is terminated: 

   

 (i) by Parent pursuant to _Section 8.01(c)_ and, prior to the breach giving rise to such right of termination, a Takeover Proposal has been publicly announced or shall have otherwise become publicly known; 

   ##### 

  

  

 (ii) by the Company or Parent pursuant to _Section 8.01(b)(ii)_ and, prior to such termination, a Takeover Proposal has been publicly announced or shall have otherwise become publicly known; or 

  

 (iii) by the Company or Parent pursuant to _Section 8.01(b)(iii)_ and prior to the Company Stockholders Meeting, a Takeover Proposal has been publicly announced or shall have otherwise become publicly known; and 

 

within nine (9) months after such termination, the Company enters into a
definitive Contract to consummate, or consummates, the transactions
contemplated by any Takeover Proposal (regardless of whether such Takeover
Proposal is made before or after termination of this Agreement), then
the Company shall pay Parent the Termination Fee by wire transfer of same-day
funds on the second (2nd) Business Day following the earlier of the date the
Company enters into such Contract or consummates such Takeover Proposal. For
purposes of this _Section 6.05(d)_, all references (whether in words or
numerals) to "twenty percent (20%)" in the definition of Takeover Proposal
shall be deemed to refer to "more than fifty percent (50%)." 

   

 (e) The Company and Parent acknowledge and agree that the agreements contained in _Section 6.05_ are an integral part of the Transactions, and that, without these agreements, Parent would not enter into this Agreement. Accordingly, if the Company fails promptly to pay any amount due pursuant to _Section 6.05_, and, in order to obtain such payment, Parent commences an Action that results in a judgment against the Company for the Termination Fee, the Company shall pay Parent its costs and expenses (including attorneys fees and expenses) in connection with such Action, together with interest on the amount of the Termination Fee and/or expenses, as the case may be, from the date such payment was required to be made until the date of payment, at the prime rate of Regions Bank, in effect on the date such payment was required to be made.

Except with respect to any Company Adverse Recommendation Change made in accordance with the terms of this Agreement, Parent and the Company shall consult with each other before issuing, and give each other the opportunity to review and comment upon, any press release or other public statements with respect to the Transactions, including the Merger, and shall not issue any such press release or make any such public statement prior to such consultation, except as such party may reasonably conclude may be required by applicable Law, by court process or by obligations pursuant to any listing agreement with any national securities exchange. 

  

 Section 6.07. _Stockholder Litigation_. The Company shall give Parent prompt written notice of, and the opportunity to participate in, subject to a customary joint defense agreement, but not control, the defense or settlement of, any stockholder litigation against the Company and/or its directors relating to the Transactions, and no such settlement shall be agreed to without Parents prior written consent, which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld or delayed. 

  

 Section 6.08. _Employee Matters_. 

  

 (a) For a period of twelve (12) months following the Effective Time, subject to the terms of any collective bargaining agreement, the employees of the Company and the 

   #####

either (A) those provided by the Parent and its Subsidiaries to similarly
situated employees of Parent and its Subsidiaries or (B) those provided or
paid by the Company and the Company Subsidiaries immediately prior to the

 Section 9.08. _GOVERNING LAW_. THIS AGREEMENT SHALL BE GOVERNED BY, AND CONSTRUED IN ACCORDANCE WITH, THE LAWS OF THE STATE OF DELAWARE, REGARDLESS OF THE LAWS THAT MIGHT OTHERWISE GOVERN UNDER APPLICABLE PRINCIPLES OF CONFLICTS OF LAWS THEREOF. 

  

 Section 9.09. _Assignment_. Neither this Agreement nor any of the rights, interests or obligations hereunder shall be assigned, in whole or in part, by operation of Law or otherwise by any of the parties without the prior written consent of the other parties, and any assignment without such consent shall be null and void, except that Parent and Merger Sub, upon prior written notice to the Company, may assign, in their sole discretion, any of or all their rights, interests and obligations under this Agreement to Parent or to any direct or indirect wholly owned Subsidiary of Parent, but no such assignment shall relieve Parent or Merger Sub of any of its obligations hereunder. Subject to the preceding sentence, this Agreement will be binding upon, inure to the benefit of, and be enforceable by, the parties and their respective successors and assigns. 

  

 Section 9.10. _Specific Enforcement; Consent to Jurisdiction_. The parties agree that irreparable damage would occur in the event any provision of this Agreement were not performed in accordance with the terms hereof or were otherwise breached and that money damages would not be a sufficient remedy for any breach of this Agreement, and accordingly, the parties hereto shall be entitled to specific performance of the terms hereof, in addition to any other remedy at law or equity. Each of the parties hereto irrevocably and unconditionally

submits, for itself and its property, to the exclusive jurisdiction of the
Delaware Court of Chancery or, in the event (but only in the event) such
court does not have subject matter jurisdiction, any other court of the State
of Delaware or the United States District Court for the District of Delaware,
in any Action arising out of or relating to this Agreement or
the Transactions. Each of the parties hereto agrees that, subject to rights
with respect to post-trial motions and rights of appeal or other avenues of
review, a final judgment in any such Action shall be conclusive and may be
enforced in other jurisdictions by suit on the judgment or in any
other manner provided by Law. Each of the parties hereto irrevocably and
unconditionally waives, to the fullest extent it may legally and effectively
do so, any objection that it may now or hereafter have to the laying of venue
of any Action arising out of or relating to this Agreement in the Delaware
Court of Chancery or any other state court of the State of Delaware or the
United States District Court for the District of Delaware. Each of the
parties hereto irrevocably and unconditionally waives, to the fullest extent
it may legally and effectively do so, the defense of an inconvenient forum to
the maintenance of such Action in any such court. 

  

 Section 9.11. _WAIVER OF JURY TRIAL_. EACH PARTY HERETO HEREBY WAIVES, TO THE FULLEST EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW, ANY RIGHT IT MAY HAVE TO A TRIAL BY JURY IN RESPECT OF ANY ACTION ARISING OUT OF THIS AGREEMENT OR THE TRANSACTIONS. EACH PARTY HERETO (A) CERTIFIES THAT NO REPRESENTATIVE, AGENT OR ATTORNEY OF ANY OTHER PARTY HAS REPRESENTED, EXPRESSLY OR OTHERWISE, THAT SUCH PARTY WOULD NOT, IN THE EVENT OF ANY ACTION, SEEK TO ENFORCE THE FOREGOING WAIVER AND (B) ACKNOWLEDGES THAT IT AND THE OTHER PARTIES HERETO HAVE BEEN INDUCED TO ENTER INTO THIS AGREEMENT, BY, AMONG OTHER THINGS, THE MUTUAL WAIVER AND CERTIFICATIONS IN THIS SECTION 9.11. 

  

 Section 9.12. _Severability_. If any term or other provision of this Agreement is invalid, illegal or incapable of being enforced by any rule of Law or public policy, all other conditions and provisions of this Agreement shall nevertheless remain in full force and effect. Upon such determination that any term or other provision is invalid, illegal or incapable of being enforced, the parties hereto shall negotiate in good faith to modify this Agreement so as to effect the original intent of the parties as closely as possible to the fullest extent permitted by applicable Law in an acceptable manner to the end that the Transactions are fulfilled to the extent possible.
