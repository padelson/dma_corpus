3 AGREEMENT AND PLAN OF MERGER



THIS AGREEMENT AND PLAN OF MERGER (this " _Agreement_ "), dated as of May 3,
2005, is by and among AMERICAN TOWER CORPORATION, a Delaware corporation ("
_ATC_ "), ASTEROID MERGER SUB, LLC, a Delaware limited liability company ("
_Merger Sub_ ") and a direct wholly owned Subsidiary of ATC, and SpectraSite,
Inc., a Delaware corporation (" _SpectraSite_ ").



W I T N E S S E T H:



WHEREAS, upon the terms and subject to the conditions of this Agreement and
in accordance with the General Corporation Law of the State of Delaware (the "
_DGCL_ ") and the Limited Liability Company Act of the State of Delaware (the
" _DLLC Act_ "), ATC and SpectraSite will enter into a business combination
transaction pursuant to which SpectraSite will merge with and into Merger Sub
(the " _Merger_ "), with Merger Sub as the surviving entity (the " _Surviving
Company_ "); 



WHEREAS, the Board of Directors of SpectraSite (i) has determined that the
Merger is consistent with and in furtherance of the long-term business
strategy of SpectraSite, and in the best interests of SpectraSite and the
holders of its common stock, par value $0.01 per share (the "
_SpectraSite Common Stock_ "), and has approved and adopted this Agreement,
the Merger and the other transactions contemplated by this Agreement and
declared its advisability and (ii) has recommended that the stockholders of
SpectraSite approve and adopt this Agreement and the Merger;



WHEREAS, the Board of Directors of ATC (i) has determined that the Merger is
consistent with and in furtherance of the long-term business strategy of ATC,
and in the best interests of ATC and its stockholders and has approved and
adopted this Agreement, the Merger and the other transactions contemplated by
this Agreement and declared its advisability and (ii) has recommended that the
stockholders of ATC approve the issuance of ATC Common Stock in connection
with the Merger and the other transactions contemplated hereby;



WHEREAS, the Board of Managers of Merger Sub (i) has determined that the
Merger is in the best interests of Merger Sub and its sole member and has
approved and adopted this Agreement, the Merger and the other transactions
contemplated by this Agreement and declared its advisability and (ii) has
recommended that ATC, as the sole member of Merger Sub, approve and adopt this
Agreement and the Merger;



WHEREAS, ATC, in its capacity as sole member of Merger Sub, has approved and
adopted this Agreement and the Merger by unanimous written consent
in accordance with the requirements of the DLLC Act;



WHEREAS, ATC may, prior to the Merger, contribute all of the membership units
of interest in Merger Sub to another limited liability company wholly owned by
ATC; and



WHEREAS, for U.S. federal income tax purposes, it is intended by ATC, Merger
Sub and SpectraSite that (a) the Merger shall qualify as a "reorganization"
within the meaning of Section 368(a) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as
amended (the " _Code_ "), and the rules and regulations promulgated
thereunder, (b) this Agreement shall constitute a plan of reorganization, and
(c) ATC and SpectraSite shall each be a party to such reorganization within
the meaning of Section 368(b) of the Code;



 

NOW, THEREFORE, in consideration of the foregoing and the respective
representations, warranties, covenants and agreements contained in
this Agreement and intending to be legally bound hereby, the parties hereto
agree as follows:

 ARTICLE I



 

THE MERGER



Section 1.1. _The Merger_. Upon the terms and subject to the conditions of
this Agreement, and in accordance with the DGCL and the DLLC Act, at
the Effective Time, SpectraSite shall be merged with and into Merger Sub. As
a result of the Merger, the separate corporate existence of SpectraSite shall
cease and Merger Sub shall continue as the Surviving Company following the
Merger. The existence of Merger Sub shall continue unaffected and unimpaired
by the Merger and, as the Surviving Company, it shall be governed by the Laws
of the State of Delaware. At the option of ATC and in lieu of the otherwise
applicable provisions of this Section 1.1, the Merger will consist of the
merger of Merger Sub with and into SpectraSite, with SpectraSite as the
Surviving Company; provided, that ATC shall not be entitled to exercise such
right to the extent that it would result in the failure to be satisfied of
the conditions set forth in either Section 6.2(d) or 6.3(d). In the event that
ATC makes such an election, the parties shall discuss in good faith and use
reasonable best efforts to agree on appropriate amendments to
the representations, warranties, covenants and other agreements contained
herein to give effect to such change; provided, that if the parties do not so
agree then the Merger shall be structured in the manner described in the first
two sentences of this paragraph.



Section 1.2. _Effective Time; Closing_. As promptly as practicable (and in
any event within three (3) business days) after the satisfaction or waiver of
the conditions set forth in Article VI hereof (other than those conditions
that by their nature are to be satisfied at the Closing), the parties hereto
shall cause the Merger to be consummated by filing a certificate of merger
(the " _Certificate of Merger_ "), with the Secretary of State of the State of
Delaware and by making all other filings or recordings required under the
DGCL or the DLLC Act in connection with the Merger, in such form as is
required by, and executed in accordance with the relevant provisions of, the
DGCL or the DLLC Act, as applicable. The Merger shall become effective at such
time as the Certificate of Merger is duly filed with the Secretary of State
of the State of Delaware, or at such other time as the parties hereto agree
and as shall be specified in the Certificate of Merger (the date and time the
Merger becomes effective, the " _Effective Time_ "). On the date of such
filing, a closing (the " _Closing_ ") shall be held at 9:00 a.m., Eastern
Time, at the offices of King and Spalding LLP, 1185 Avenue of the Americas, New
York, NY 10036, or at such other time and location as the parties hereto
shall otherwise agree.



Section 1.3. _Effect of the Merger_. At the Effective Time, the effect of the
Merger shall be as provided in the applicable provisions of the DGCL and the
DLLC Act. Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, and subject
thereto, at the Effective Time, except as otherwise provided herein, all the
property, rights, privileges, powers and franchises of SpectraSite and Merger
Sub shall vest in the Surviving Company, and all debts,
liabilities, obligations, restrictions, disabilities and duties of
SpectraSite and Merger Sub shall become the debts, liabilities, obligations,
restrictions, disabilities and duties of the Surviving Company.



Section 1.4. _Certificate of Formation and Operating Agreement_. 



(a) The Certificate of Formation of Merger Sub in effect immediately
preceding the Effective Time, which shall be in the form set forth in Exhibit
1.4(a), shall be the Certificate of Formation of the Surviving Company until
thereafter changed or amended as provided therein or by applicable Law. 



(b) The Operating Agreement of Merger Sub in effect immediately preceding the
Effective Time, which shall be in the form set forth in Exhibit 1.4(b), shall
be the Operating Agreement of the Surviving Company, until thereafter changed
or amended or as provided therein or by applicable Law.

 



Section 1.5. _Managers and Officers_. From and after the Effective Time,
until the earlier of their resignation or removal or until their respective
successors are duly elected or appointed and qualified in accordance with
applicable Law, (a) the members of the board of managers of Merger Sub at the
Effective Time shall be the members of the board of managers of the Surviving
Company, and (b) the officers of Merger Sub at the Effective Time shall be the
officers of the Surviving Company.



 

2 ARTICLE II



CONVERSION OF SECURITIES; EXCHANGE PROCEDURES



Section 2.1. _Effect on Shares_. At the Effective Time, by virtue of the
Merger and without any action on the part of ATC, Merger Sub, SpectraSite or
the holders of any of the following securities:



(a) Subject to the other provisions of this Section 2.1, each share of
SpectraSite Common Stock (collectively, the " _Shares_ ") issued and
outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time (other than Shares
canceled pursuant to Section 2.1(b)) shall be canceled and shall by virtue of
the Merger and without any action on the part of the holder thereof be
converted automatically into the right to receive 3.575 (the "
_Exchange Ratio_ ") shares of ATC Class A Common Stock (the " _Merger
Consideration_ "). At the Effective Time, all Shares converted pursuant to
this Section 2.1(a) shall no longer be outstanding and shall automatically be
canceled and retired and cease to exist, and each holder of a certificate ("
_Certificate_ ") representing any such Shares shall cease to have any rights
with respect thereto, except the right to receive the Merger Consideration in
accordance with this Section 2.1(a).



(b) Each Share held in treasury of SpectraSite and each Share owned directly
by ATC, in each case immediately prior to the Effective Time, shall be
canceled without any conversion thereof, and no payment or distribution shall
be made with respect thereto.



(c) Each membership unit of interest in Merger Sub (the " _Merger Sub Units_
") issued and outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time shall remain
outstanding and unaffected by the Merger as identical units of interest in the
Surviving Company and, following the Merger, shall constitute the
only outstanding units of interest or other equity interests in the Surviving
Company from and after the Effective Time.



Section 2.2. _Stock Options; Warrants_.



(a) ATC, effective as of the Effective Time, shall assume by operation of this
Agreement the SpectraSite 2003 Equity Incentive Plan and the SpectraSite 2005
Equity Incentive Plan (together, the " _SpectraSite Stock Option Plans_ "),
and all stock options (the " _SpectraSite Options_ ") outstanding, whether or
not exercisable and whether or not vested, at the Effective Time under the
SpectraSite Stock Option Plans, shall remain outstanding following the
Effective Time. The consummation of the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement shall result in the vesting (or other lapsing of similar
restrictions in exercisability) of unvested options granted under the
SpectraSite Stock Option Plans that are outstanding immediately prior to the
Effective Time on the same terms and conditions as were applicable under, and
only to the extent expressly provided for by the terms of, the SpectraSite
Stock Option Plans and the related SpectraSite Options as outstanding and in
effect on the date hereof or issued after the date hereof to the extent
permitted by Section 5.1(b) (but taking into account any changes thereto
provided for in the SpectraSite Stock Options Plans or in the SpectraSite
Options (x) by reason of this Agreement or the transactions contemplated
hereby or (y) to the extent permitted in accordance with Section 5.1(c)(vii)).
The parties acknowledge that, under the terms of the SpectraSite Stock Option
Plans, immediately prior to the Effective Time, the Board of Directors of
SpectraSite will determine whether the SpectraSite Performance Options (as
defined in each stock option agreement for SpectraSite Stock Options (a "
_SpectraSite Option Agreement_ ")) that are unvested immediately prior to the
Effective Time will become vested upon the Effective Time, which determination
shall be made in accordance with the terms of the SpectraSite Options and the
SpectraSite Stock Option Plans. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the parties
agree that if any SpectraSite Option provides for a Service Option (as defined
in such SpectraSite Option Agreement), such Service Option will vest if the
employment of the holder of such SpectraSite Option is terminated without
Cause (as "Cause" is defined in the SpectraSite 2003 Equity Incentive Plan
(the " _2003 Plan_ ")) at any time after the Effective Time but before the
end of the one (1) year period which starts at the Effective Time (the "
_Protected Period_ ") or the employment of such SpectraSite Option holder
terminates as a result of such SpectraSite Option holders resignation for
Good Reason (as "Good Reason" is defined in the 2003 Plan) during the
Protected Period. At the Effective Time, the SpectraSite Options shall, by
virtue of the Merger and without any further  



 

3  action on the part of SpectraSite or the holder thereof, be assumed by ATC
in such manner that ATC (i) is a corporation "assuming a stock option in
a transaction to which Section 424(a) applies" within the meaning of Section
424 of the Code and the regulations thereunder or (ii) to the extent that
Section 424 of the Code does not apply to any such SpectraSite Options, would
be such a corporation were Section 424 of the Code applicable to any such
SpectraSite Options. From and after the Effective Time, all references to
SpectraSite in the SpectraSite Stock Option Plans and the applicable stock
option agreements issued thereunder shall be deemed to refer to ATC. Each
SpectraSite Option assumed by ATC (each, a " _Substitute Option_ ") shall be
exercisable upon the same terms and conditions as under the SpectraSite Stock
Option Plans and the applicable option agreement issued thereunder, except
that (A) each such Substitute Option shall be exercisable for, and represent
the right to acquire, that whole number of shares of ATC Common Stock (rounded
down to the nearest whole share) equal to the aggregate number of shares of
SpectraSite Common Stock subject to such SpectraSite Option multiplied by the
Exchange Ratio; and (B) the option price per share of ATC Common Stock shall
be an amount equal to the option price per share of SpectraSite Common Stock
subject to such SpectraSite Option in effect immediately prior to the
Effective Time divided by the Exchange Ratio (the option price per share, as
so determined, being rounded upward to the nearest full cent). Such Substitute
Option shall otherwise be subject to the same terms and conditions as such
SpectraSite Option.



(b) As soon as practicable after the Effective Time, ATC shall deliver, or
cause to be delivered, to each holder of a Substitute Option an appropriate
notice setting forth such holders rights pursuant thereto and such
Substitute Option shall continue in effect on the same terms and conditions
(including any antidilution provisions, and subject to the adjustments
required by this Section 2.2 after giving effect to the Merger). ATC shall
take all corporate action necessary to reserve for issuance a sufficient
number of shares of ATC Common Stock for delivery upon exercise of Substitute
Options pursuant to the terms set forth in this Section 2.2. ATC shall use
reasonable best efforts to prepare and file with the SEC and to cause to be
effective prior to or at the Effective Time a registration statement on Form
S-8 (or another appropriate form) registering under the SpectraSite Stock
Option Plans all shares of ATC Common Stock subject to the Substitute
Options. ATC shall use reasonable best efforts to keep such registration
statement effective and to keep the current status of the prospectus required
thereby maintained as long as Substitute Options remain outstanding. In
addition, ATC shall use reasonable best efforts to cause the shares of ATC
Common Stock subject to Substitute Options to be listed on the NYSE.



(c) As of the Effective Time, by virtue of the Merger and the conversion of
the issued and outstanding shares of SpectraSite Common Stock pursuant
to Section 2.1(a) above, and without any action on the part of SpectraSite or
ATC or the holder of the warrants issued and outstanding in connection with
SpectraSites Plan of Reorganization that became effective on February 10,
2003, granting holders thereof the right to purchase shares of SpectraSite
Common Stock (the " _SpectraSite Warrants_ "), each SpectraSite Warrant issued
and outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time shall, in accordance
with and subject to the applicable provisions of such SpectraSite Warrant (i)
remain outstanding after the Effective Time and (ii) be exercisable in
accordance with the terms of such SpectraSite Warrant.



(d) Section 2.2(d) of the SpectraSite Disclosure Letter (hereinafter defined)
sets forth a complete and correct list, as of May 2, 2005, of all SpectraSite
Options, the number of shares of SpectraSite Common Stock (or other capital
stock of SpectraSite) subject thereto, the grant dates, expiration dates, the
exercise or base prices and vesting schedules thereof and the names of the
holders thereof.



(e) On or after the date of this Agreement and prior to the Effective Time,
each of ATC and SpectraSite shall take all necessary actions as may be
required to cause any dispositions of SpectraSite Common Stock (including
derivative securities with respect to SpectraSite Common Stock) or
acquisitions of ATC Common Stock (including derivative securities with respect
to ATC Common Stock) resulting from the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement by each director or officer who is subject to the reporting
requirements of Section 16(a) of the Exchange Act, to be exempt from the
short-swing profit liability rules of Section 16(b) of the Exchange Act
pursuant to Rule 16b-3 promulgated thereunder. Such actions shall be
consistent with all current  



 

4  applicable interpretation and guidance of the United States Securities and
Exchange Commission (the " _SEC_ "), including, but not limited to, the No-
Action letter dated January 12, 1999, issued by the SEC to Skadden, Arps,
Slate, Meagher and Flom LLP.



Section 2.3. _Restricted Stock_. Any shares of SpectraSite Common Stock
outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time that are subject to
a repurchase option or risk of forfeiture under the SpectraSite Stock Option
Plans shall, by operation of this Agreement, be exchanged for shares of ATC
Common Stock on the same terms and conditions as the shares of SpectraSite
Common Stock that are not subject to any repurchase option or risk of
forfeiture in accordance with Section 2.1; _provided_ , _however_ , that, to
the extent that such shares do not, by their terms, become vested and cease to
be subject to any such repurchase option or risk of forfeiture as a result of
the consummation of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, such
shares shall, following the Effective Time, be subject to the same repurchase
option or risk of forfeiture as set forth in the agreement pursuant to which
such shares were granted. Section 2.3 of the SpectraSite Disclosure Letter
sets forth a complete and correct list, as of the date hereof, of all
SpectraSite Common Stock subject to any such repurchase option or other
risk of forfeiture, the grant dates, expiration dates of such repurchase
options or other risk of forfeiture or "vesting schedules" thereof and the
names of the holders thereof.



Section 2.4. _Exchange of Certificates_.



(a) _Exchange Agent_. At or prior to the Effective Time, ATC shall deposit, or
shall cause to be deposited, with a bank or trust company that may be
designated by ATC as exchange agent (the " _Exchange Agent_ "), for the
benefit of the holders of Shares, for exchange in accordance with this Article
II through the Exchange Agent, (i) certificates representing the shares of
ATC Common Stock issuable pursuant to Section 2.1(a), and (ii) cash, from time
to time as required to make payments in lieu of any fractional shares pursuant
to Section 2.4(e) (such cash and certificates for shares of ATC Common Stock,
together with any dividends or distributions with respect thereto, being
hereinafter referred to as the " _Exchange Fund_ "). The Exchange Agent shall,
pursuant to irrevocable instructions, deliver the shares of ATC Common Stock
and cash contemplated to be issued pursuant to Section 2.1(a) and this Section
2.4(a) out of the Exchange Fund. Except as contemplated by Section 2.4(g)
hereof, the Exchange Fund shall not be used for any other purpose.



(b) _Exchange Procedures_. As promptly as practicable after the Effective
Time, ATC shall cause the Exchange Agent to mail to each person who was, at
the Effective Time, a holder of record of Shares entitled to receive the
Merger Consideration pursuant to Section 2.1(a): (i) a letter of transmittal
(which shall be in customary form and shall specify that delivery shall be
effected, and risk of loss and title to the Certificates shall pass, only upon
proper delivery of the Certificates to the Exchange Agent) and (ii)
instructions for use in effecting the surrender of the Certificates pursuant
to such letter of transmittal. Upon surrender to the Exchange Agent of a
Certificate for cancellation, together with such letter of transmittal, duly
completed and validly executed in accordance with the instructions thereto,
and such other documents as may be required pursuant to such instructions, the
holder of such Certificate shall be entitled to receive in exchange therefor:
(A) a certificate representing that number of whole shares of ATC Common
Stock which such holder has the right to receive in respect of the Shares
formerly represented by such Certificate after taking into account all Shares
then held by such holder, and (B) cash in lieu of any fractional shares of ATC
Common Stock to which such holder is entitled pursuant to Section 2.4(e) and
any dividends or other distributions to which such holder is entitled pursuant
to Section 2.4(c), and the Certificate so surrendered shall forthwith be
cancelled. No interest will be paid or will accrue on any cash payable
pursuant to Section 2.4(c) or (e). In the event of a transfer of ownership of
Shares that is not registered in the transfer records of SpectraSite, a
certificate representing the proper number of shares of ATC Common Stock and
a check for cash in lieu of any fractional shares of ATC Common Stock to which
such holder is entitled pursuant to Section 2.4(e) and for any dividends or
other distributions to which such holder is entitled pursuant to
Section 2.4(c) may be issued to a transferee if the Certificate representing
such Shares is presented to the Exchange Agent, accompanied by all documents
required to evidence and effect such transfer and by evidence that any
applicable stock transfer taxes have been paid. Until surrendered as
contemplated by this Section 2.4, each Certificate shall be deemed at all
times after the Effective Time to represent only the right  



 

5  to receive upon such surrender the Merger Consideration, the cash in lieu of
any fractional shares of ATC Common Stock to which such holder is
entitled pursuant to Section 2.4(e) and any dividends or other distributions
to which such holder is entitled pursuant to Section 2.4(c).



(c) _Distributions with Respect to Unexchanged Shares_. No dividends or other
distributions declared or made after the Effective Time with respect to the
ATC Common Stock with a record date after the Effective Time shall be paid to
the holder of any unsurrendered Certificate with respect to the shares of
SpectraSite Common Stock represented thereby, until the holder of such
Certificate shall surrender such Certificate. Subject to the effect of
escheat, tax or other applicable Laws, following surrender of any such
Certificate, there shall be paid to the holder of the certificates
representing whole shares of ATC Common Stock issued in exchange therefor,
without interest, (i) promptly, the amount of dividends or other distributions
with a record date after the Effective Time and theretofore paid with respect
to such whole shares of ATC Common Stock, and (ii) at the appropriate payment
date, the amount of dividends or other distributions, with a record date after
the Effective Time but prior to surrender and a payment date occurring after
surrender, payable with respect to such whole shares of ATC Common Stock.

 



(d) _No Further Rights in SpectraSite Common Stock_. All cash paid and shares
of ATC Common Stock issued upon conversion of the Shares in accordance with
the terms of this Article II (including any cash paid pursuant to Section
2.4(c) or (e)) shall be deemed to have been paid and issued in full
satisfaction of all rights pertaining to such Shares.



(e) _No Fractional Shares_. No certificates or script representing fractional
shares of ATC Common Stock shall be issued upon the surrender for exchange of
Certificates, and such fractional shares interests will not entitle the owner
thereof to vote or to any other rights of a stockholder of ATC. Each holder
of Shares exchanged pursuant to the Merger who would otherwise be entitled to
receive a fraction of a share of ATC Common Stock (after taking into account
all Certificates delivered by such holder) shall receive, upon surrender of
such holders Certificates in accordance with this Section 2.4, an amount in
cash (without interest) equal to the product obtained by multiplying (i) such
fractional share interest to which such holder would otherwise be entitled by
(ii) the average of the per share closing prices on the New York Stock
Exchange (the " _NYSE_ ") of shares of ATC Common Stock during the ten (10)
consecutive trading days ending on (and including) the trading
day immediately preceding the date of the Effective Time. As promptly as
practicable after the determination of the amount of cash, if any, to be paid
to holders of fractional share interests, the Exchange Agent shall so notify
ATC, and ATC shall deposit such amount with the Exchange Agent and shall
cause the Exchange Agent to forward payments to such holders of fractional
share interests subject to and in accordance with the terms of Section 2.4(b).



(f) _Adjustments to Exchange Ratio_. The Exchange Ratio shall be adjusted to
reflect appropriately the effect of any stock split, reverse stock split,
stock dividend (including any dividend or distribution of securities
convertible into ATC Common Stock or SpectraSite Common Stock), cash
dividends, reorganization, recapitalization, reclassification, combination,
exchange of shares or other like change with respect to ATC Common Stock or
SpectraSite Common Stock occurring on or after the date hereof and prior to
the Effective Time.

 



(g) _Termination of Exchange Fund_. Any portion of the Exchange
Fund (including any interest received with respect thereto) that remains
undistributed to the holders of the SpectraSite Common Stock for one year
after the Effective Time shall be delivered to ATC, upon demand, and any
holders of the SpectraSite Common Stock who have not theretofore complied
with this Article II shall thereafter look solely to ATC with respect to the
Merger Consideration payable or issuable upon due surrender of their
Certificates, and any other cash amounts payable pursuant to this Article II,
without any interest thereon. Any portion of the Exchange Fund remaining
unclaimed by holders of Shares as of a date which is immediately prior to such
times as such amounts would otherwise escheat to or become property of
any Governmental Entity shall, to the extent permitted by applicable Law,
become the property of ATC free and clear of any claims or interest of any
person previously entitled thereto.



 

6 (h) _No Liability_. Neither the Exchange Agent nor any party hereto shall be
liable to any holder of Certificates for any such Shares (or dividends or
distributions with respect thereto), or cash delivered to a public official
pursuant to any abandoned property, escheat or similar Law.



(i) _Withholding Rights_. Each of the Surviving Company, ATC and the Exchange
Agent shall be entitled to deduct and withhold from the Merger Consideration
otherwise payable pursuant to this Agreement to any holder of Shares such
amounts as it is required to deduct and withhold with respect to the making of
such payment under the Code, or any provision of federal, state, local or
foreign tax Law. To the extent that amounts are so withheld by ATC or the
Exchange Agent, as the case may be, such withheld amounts shall be treated for
all purposes of this Agreement as having been paid to the holder of the
Shares in respect to which such deduction and withholding was made by ATC or
the Exchange Agent, as the case may be.



(j) _Lost Certificates_. If any Certificate shall have been lost, stolen or
destroyed, upon the making of an affidavit of that fact by the
person claiming such Certificate to be lost, stolen or destroyed and, if
required by ATC, the posting by such person of a bond, in such reasonable
amount as ATC may direct, as indemnity against any claim that may be made
against it with respect to such Certificate, the Exchange Agent will issue in
exchange for such lost, stolen or destroyed Certificate the Merger
Consideration, any cash in lieu of fractional shares of ATC Common Stock to
which the holders thereof are entitled pursuant to Section 2.4(e) and any
dividend or other distributions to which the holders thereof are entitled
pursuant to Section 2.4(c).



Section 2.5. _Stock Transfer Books_. At the Effective Time, the stock transfer
books of SpectraSite shall be closed and there shall be no
further registration of transfers of Shares thereafter on the records of
SpectraSite. From and after the Effective Time, the holders of Certificates
representing Shares outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time shall
cease to have any rights with respect to such Shares, except as otherwise
provided in this Agreement or by Law. On or after the Effective Time, any
Certificates presented to the Exchange Agent or ATC for any reason shall be
converted into the right to receive the Merger Consideration, any cash in
lieu of fractional shares of ATC Common Stock to which the holders thereof are
entitled pursuant to Section 2.4(e) and any dividends or other distributions
to which the holders thereof are entitled pursuant to Section 2.4(c).



Section 2.6. _Forms of SpectraSite Options and SpectraSite Restricted Stock
Awards_. Prior to the date hereof, SpectraSite has made available to ATC
correct and complete copies of the form of each stock option agreement or
restricted stock award that evidences any outstanding SpectraSite Options,
restricted stock grants or other compensatory stock awards, and no stock
option agreement or restricted stock purchase agreement or other award
agreement that governs any such SpectraSite Options, restricted stock grants
or other compensatory stock awards contains terms that are materially
inconsistent with such forms.

since February 10, 2003 (the " _SpectraSite SEC Reports_ "), each of which
has complied in all material respects with the applicable requirements of the
Securities Act and the rules and regulations promulgated thereunder, the
Exchange Act, and the rules and regulations promulgated thereunder, each as
in effect on the date so filed, except to the extent updated, amended,
restated or corrected by a subsequent SpectraSite SEC Report filed or
furnished to the SEC by SpectraSite, and in either case, publicly available
prior to the date hereof (each, a " _SpectraSite Filed SEC Report_ "). None of
the SpectraSite SEC Reports (including, any financial statements or schedules
included or incorporated by reference therein) contained when filed, and any
SpectraSite SEC Reports filed with the SEC subsequent to the date hereof will
not contain, any untrue statement of a material fact or omitted to state a
material fact required to be stated therein or necessary to make the
statements therein, in light of the circumstances under which they were made,
not misleading, except to the extent updated, amended, restated or corrected
by a subsequent SpectraSite Filed SEC Report. The principal executive officer
of SpectraSite and the principal financial officer of SpectraSite (and each
former principal executive officer of SpectraSite and each former principal
financial officer of SpectraSite, as applicable) have made the certifications
required by Sections 302 and 906 of, and SpectraSite has complied in all
material respects with, the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 (the " _Sarbanes-Oxley
Act_ "), and the rules and regulations of the SEC promulgated thereunder with
respect to SpectraSites filings pursuant to the Exchange Act. For purposes
of the preceding sentence, "principal executive officer" and "principal
financial officer" shall have the meanings given to such terms in the
Sarbanes-Oxley Act.



 

11 (b) Except to the extent updated, amended, restated or corrected by a
subsequent SpectraSite Filed SEC Report, all of the financial statements
included in the SpectraSite SEC Reports, in each case, including any related
notes thereto, as filed with the SEC (those filed with the SEC are
collectively referred to as the " _SpectraSite Financial Statements_ "), have
been prepared in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles
(" _GAAP_ ") applied on a consistent basis throughout the periods involved
(except as may be indicated in the notes thereto or, in the case of the
unaudited statements, as may be permitted by Form 10-Q of the SEC and subject,
in the case of the unaudited statements, to normal, year-end audit adjustments
which would not reasonably be expected to have, individually or in
the aggregate, a Material Adverse Effect). The consolidated balance sheets
(including the related notes) included in such SpectraSite Financial
Statements (if applicable, as updated, amended, restated or corrected in a
subsequent SpectraSite Filed SEC Report) fairly present, in all material
respects, the consolidated financial position of SpectraSite and the
SpectraSite Subsidiaries at the respective dates thereof, and the consolidated
statements of operations, stockholders equity and cash flows (in each case,
including the related notes) included in such SpectraSite Financial Statements
(if applicable, as updated, amended, restated or corrected in a subsequent
SpectraSite Filed SEC Report) fairly present, in all material respects, the
consolidated statements of operations, stockholders equity and cash flows of
SpectraSite and the SpectraSite Subsidiaries for the periods indicated,
subject, in the case of the unaudited statements, to normal, year-end audit
adjustments which would not reasonably be expected to have, individually or
in the aggregate, a Material Adverse Effect.



(c) SpectraSite has designed and maintains a system of "internal control over
financial reporting" (as defined in Rules 13a-15(f) and 15d-15(f) of the
Exchange Act) sufficient to provide reasonable assurances regarding the
reliability of financial reporting.



(d) SpectraSites "disclosure controls and procedures" (as defined in Rules
13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) of the Exchange Act) are reasonably designed to
ensure that all material information (both financial and non-financial)
required to be disclosed by SpectraSite in the reports that it files or
submits under the Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized and reported
within the time periods specified in the rules and forms of the SEC, and that
all such information is accumulated and communicated to SpectraSites
management as appropriate to allow timely decisions regarding required
disclosure and to make the certifications of the chief executive officer and
chief financial officer of SpectraSite required under the Exchange Act with
respect to such reports.



(e) Neither SpectraSite nor any of the SpectraSite Subsidiaries has any
liabilities or obligations of any kind whatsoever, whether or not accrued
and whether or not contingent or absolute, that are material to SpectraSite
and the SpectraSite Subsidiaries, taken as a whole, other than (i) liabilities
or obligations disclosed or provided for in the consolidated balance sheet of
SpectraSite and the SpectraSite Subsidiaries as of December 31, 2004,
including the notes thereto, contained in the SpectraSite Filed SEC Reports,
(ii) liabilities or obligations incurred on behalf of SpectraSite in
connection with this Agreement and the contemplated Merger, (iii) liabilities
or obligations incurred in the ordinary course of business consistent with
past practice since January 1, 2005, and (iv) other liabilities or obligations
that are not otherwise covered by insurance that were not, or would not
reasonably be expected to be, material and adverse to the businesses of
SpectraSite and the SpectraSite Subsidiaries, taken as a whole.



Section 3.8. _Absence of Certain Changes or Events_. Except as contemplated by
this Agreement, since January 1, 2005, each of SpectraSite and
the SpectraSite Subsidiaries has conducted its respective businesses only in
the ordinary course in all material respects and in a manner consistent with
prior practice in all material respects and there has not been any event or
occurrence of any condition that has had or would reasonably be expected to
have, individually or in the aggregate, a Material Adverse Effect. Except as
contemplated by this Agreement, since January 1, 2005 and through the date
hereof, there has not been (i) any material change in accounting methods,
principles or practices employed by SpectraSite or (ii) any action of the
types described in Sections 5.1(b) or 5.1(c) which, had such action been taken
after the date of this Agreement, would be in violation of any such Section.

tax returns and reports required to be filed by it or has been granted
extensions to file such returns or reports, which extensions have not expired,

had and would not reasonably be expected to have a Material Adverse Effect.
SpectraSite and each of the SpectraSite Subsidiaries have paid (or SpectraSite
has paid on its behalf) all taxes (i) shown as due on such returns or (ii)
otherwise due and payable, except for those taxes (x) being contested in good
faith by appropriate proceedings and for which adequate reserves have been
established in the financial statements included in the SpectraSite Filed SEC
Reports in accordance with GAAP or (y) that have not had and would not
reasonably be expected to have, individually or in the aggregate, a Material
Adverse Effect. There are no Liens for any taxes upon the assets of
SpectraSite or the SpectraSite Subsidiaries, other than (i) statutory Liens
for taxes not yet due and payable, (ii) Liens for taxes contested in good
faith by appropriate proceedings and (iii) Liens that are not, and would not
reasonably be expected to be, material to the businesses of SpectraSite and
the SpectraSite Subsidiaries, taken as a whole.

in writing against SpectraSite or any of the SpectraSite Subsidiaries that

in the aggregate, have not had and would not reasonably be expected to have a
Material Adverse Effect, and no requests for waivers of the time to assess
any such taxes have been granted or are pending (other than with respect to
years that are currently under examination by the Internal Revenue Service or
other applicable taxing authorities). 



(c) Neither SpectraSite nor any of the SpectraSite Subsidiaries has taken any
action or has any knowledge of any fact or circumstance that is reasonably

into a "listed transaction" within the meaning of Treasury Regulation
§1.6011-4(b)(2).



(f) SpectraSite and the SpectraSite Subsidiaries have complied with all
applicable Laws relating to the payment and withholding of taxes, except where

liability for the taxes of any person (other than SpectraSite and the
SpectraSite Subsidiaries) under Treasury Regulation § 1.1502-6 (or any
similar provision of any state, local or foreign law) as a transferee or
successor, by contract or otherwise that, individually or in the aggregate,
has had or would reasonably be expected to have a Material Adverse Effect.

or foreign income, gross receipts, property, sales, use, license, excise,
franchise, employment, payroll, premium, withholding, alternative or added
minimum, ad valorem, transfer or excise tax, or any other tax, duty,

the Merger or the other transactions contemplated by this Agreement will

SpectraSite Benefit Plan (or, in the case of any unwritten SpectraSite
Benefit Plan, a summary of the material provisions of such plan) in effect on

Section 412 of the Code or is otherwise a plan described in Section 3(40) of
ERISA or a plan described in Section 413 of the Code. Other than severance
benefits provided under a SpectraSite Benefit Plan, no SpectraSite Welfare
Plan provides benefits to, or on behalf of, any former employee after the
termination of employment except (1) where the full cost of such benefit is
borne entirely by the former employee (or his eligible dependents or
beneficiaries), (2) where plan benefits are payable through a trust, the fair
market value of the assets of which equal or exceed the present value of the
liabilities of such plan or (3) where the benefit is required by Section
4980B of the Code.



(c) Except as has not had or would not reasonably be expected to have,
individually or in the aggregate, a Material Adverse Effect: (i) each
SpectraSite Benefit Plan in effect on the date hereof has been administered in

participant contributions, required under each SpectraSite Benefit Plan have
been made in full on a timely and proper basis pursuant to the terms of such
plans and applicable Law; (iii) with respect to the SpectraSite Benefit
Plans, individually and in the aggregate, no event has occurred, and there

taxes under Section 401(a) of the Code and the trust relating to such plan is
exempt from income taxes under Section 501(a) of the Code, and no
such determination letter has been revoked and, to the knowledge of
SpectraSite, revocation has not been threatened; (vi) SpectraSite has made
available to ATC a copy of the most recent determination letter received with
respect to each SpectraSite Pension Plan for which such a letter has been
issued, as well as a copy of any pending application for a determination
letter; (vii) there are no understandings, agreements or undertakings, written
or oral, with any person (other than the express terms of any SpectraSite
Benefit Plans) that would (pursuant to any such understandings, agreements or
undertakings) reasonably be expected to result in any liabilities if any
SpectraSite Benefit Plan was amended or terminated on or at any time after
the Effective Time or that would prevent any unilateral action by SpectraSite
(or, after the Effective Time, ATC) to effect such amendment or termination;
(viii) no present or former officers, employees, directors or independent
contractors of SpectraSite or any SpectraSite Subsidiaries will be entitled
to any  



 

16  additional benefits or any acceleration of the time of payment, funding or
vesting of any benefits under any SpectraSite Benefit Plan as a result of
the transactions contemplated by this Agreement; (ix) neither the execution
and delivery of this Agreement, nor the consummation of any transaction
contemplated by this Agreement (alone or in conjunction with a termination of
employment) will (A) trigger any funding (through a grantor trust or
otherwise) of any compensation or benefits or (B) result in any violation or
breach of, or a default (with or without notice or lapse of time or both)
under any SpectraSite Benefit Plan; (x) other than as set forth in any
SpectraSite Benefit Plans or as may be required to avoid any adverse tax
consequence under Section 409A of the Code, since December 31, 2004, there has

or any SpectraSite Subsidiaries of any SpectraSite Benefit Plan or any
agreement (whether or not legally binding) to adopt or amend any such plan;
and (xi) only officers, directors and employees of SpectraSite or any
SpectraSite Subsidiaries are eligible for compensation or benefits under the
terms of each SpectraSite Benefit Plan, and each individual who is classified
by SpectraSite or any SpectraSite Subsidiary as an "employee" or as an
"independent contractor" is properly so classified.

had, or would not reasonably be expected to have, individually or in the
aggregate, a Material Adverse Effect; and neither ATC nor any ATC Subsidiary
has received notice from any Governmental Entity that any such license,
permit, certificate, approval or authorization is subject to any adverse
action which has had, or would reasonably be expected to have, individually
or in the aggregate, a Material Adverse Effect.



(c) This Section 4.6 does not relate to tax matters, employee benefits
matters, labor relations matters, or environmental matters which are the
subjects of Sections 4.9, 4.14, 4.15 and 4.16, respectively.



Section 4.7. _SEC Filings; Financial Statements_.



(a) Each of ATC and the ATC Subsidiaries has filed all forms,
reports, statements and documents required to be filed with the SEC since
February 10, 2003 (the " _ATC SEC Reports_ "), each of which has complied in
all material respects with the applicable requirements of the Securities Act
and the rules and regulations promulgated thereunder, the Exchange Act, and
the rules and regulations promulgated thereunder, each as in effect on the
date so filed, except to the extent updated, amended, restated or corrected by
a subsequent ATC SEC Report filed or furnished to the SEC by ATC, and in
either case, publicly available prior to the date hereof (each, a " _ATC Filed
SEC Report_ "). None of the ATC SEC Reports (including, any financial
statements or schedules included or incorporated by reference therein)
contained when filed, and any ATC SEC Reports filed  



 

24  with the SEC subsequent to the date hereof will not contain, any untrue
statement of a material fact or omitted to state a material fact required to
be stated therein or necessary to make the statements therein, in light of
the circumstances under which they were made, not misleading, except to the
extent updated, amended, restated or corrected by a subsequent ATC Filed SEC
Report. The principal executive officer of ATC and the principal financial
officer of ATC (and each former principal executive officer of ATC and each
former principal financial officer of ATC, as applicable) have made the
certifications required by Sections 302 and 906 of, and ATC has complied in
all material respects with, the Sarbanes-Oxley Act, and the rules and
regulations of the SEC promulgated thereunder with respect to ATCs filings
pursuant to the Exchange Act. For purposes of the preceding
sentence, "principal executive officer" and "principal financial officer"
shall have the meanings given to such terms in the Sarbanes-Oxley Act.



(b) Except to the extent updated, amended, restated or corrected by a
subsequent ATC Filed SEC Report, all of the financial statements included in
the ATC SEC Reports, in each case, including any related notes thereto, as
filed with the SEC (those filed with the SEC are collectively referred to as
the " _ATC Financial Statements_ "), have been prepared in accordance with
GAAP applied on a consistent basis throughout the periods involved (except as
may be indicated in the notes thereto or, in the case of the unaudited
statements, as may be permitted by Form 10-Q of the SEC and subject, in the
case of the unaudited statements, to normal, year-end audit adjustments which
would not reasonably be expected to have, individually or in the aggregate, a
Material Adverse Effect). The consolidated balance sheets (including the
related notes) included in such ATC Financial Statements (if applicable, as
updated, amended, restated or corrected in a subsequent ATC Filed SEC Report)
fairly present, in all material respects, the consolidated financial position
of ATC and the ATC Subsidiaries at the respective dates thereof, and
the consolidated statements of operations, stockholders equity and cash
flows (in each case, including the related notes) included in such ATC
Financial Statements (if applicable, as updated, amended, restated or
corrected in a subsequent ATC Filed SEC Report) fairly present, in all
material respects, the consolidated statements of operations, stockholders
equity and cash flows of ATC and the ATC Subsidiaries for the periods
indicated, subject, in the case of the unaudited statements, to normal, year-
end audit adjustments which would not reasonably be expected to have,
individually or in the aggregate, a Material Adverse Effect.



 

(c) ATC has designed and maintains a system of "internal control over
financial reporting" (as defined in Rules 13a-15(f) and 15d-15(f) of the
Exchange Act) sufficient to provide reasonable assurances regarding the
reliability of financial reporting.



(d) ATCs "disclosure controls and procedures" (as defined in Rules 13a-15(e)
and 15d-15(e) of the Exchange Act) are reasonably designed to ensure that all
material information (both financial and non-financial) required to be
disclosed by ATC in the reports that it files or submits under the Exchange
Act is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods
specified in the rules and forms of the SEC, and that all such information is
accumulated and communicated to ATCs management as appropriate to allow
timely decisions regarding required disclosure and to make the certifications
of the chief executive officer and chief financial officer of ATC required
under the Exchange Act with respect to such reports.



(e) Neither ATC nor any of the ATC Subsidiaries has any liabilities or
obligations of any kind whatsoever, whether or not accrued and whether or
not contingent or absolute, that are material to ATC and the ATC
Subsidiaries, taken as a whole, other than (i) liabilities or obligations
disclosed or provided for in the consolidated balance sheet of ATC and the ATC
Subsidiaries as of December 31, 2004, including the notes thereto, contained
in the ATC Filed SEC Reports, (ii) liabilities or obligations incurred on
behalf of ATC in connection with this Agreement and the contemplated Merger,
(iii) liabilities or obligations incurred in the ordinary course of business
consistent with past practice since January 1, 2005, and (iv) other
liabilities or obligations that are not otherwise covered by insurance that
were not, or would not reasonably be expected to be, material and adverse
to the businesses of ATC and the ATC Subsidiaries, taken as a whole.



Section 4.8. _Absence of Certain Changes or Events_. Except as contemplated by
this Agreement, since January 1, 2005, each of ATC and the ATC Subsidiaries
has conducted its respective businesses only in the  



 

25  ordinary course in all material respects and in a manner consistent with
prior practice in all material respects and there has not been any event
or occurrence of any condition that has had or would reasonably be expected
to have, individually or in the aggregate, a Material Adverse Effect. Except
as contemplated by this Agreement, since January 1, 2005 and through the date
hereof, there has not been (i) any material change in accounting methods,
principles or practices employed by ATC or (ii) any action of the types
described in Sections 5.2(b) or 5.2(c) which, had such action been taken after
the date of this Agreement, would be in violation of any such Section.



Section 4.9. _Taxes_. 



(a) Each of ATC and the ATC Subsidiaries has duly filed all tax returns and
reports required to be filed by it or has been granted extensions to file such
returns or reports, which extensions have not expired, except to the extent
that all such failures to file, taken together, have not had and would
not reasonably be expected to have a Material Adverse Effect. ATC and each of
the ATC Subsidiaries have paid (or ATC has paid on its behalf) all taxes (i)
shown as due on such returns or (ii) otherwise due and payable, except for
those taxes (x) being contested in good faith by appropriate proceedings and
for which adequate reserves have been established in the financial statements
included in the ATC Filed SEC Reports in accordance with GAAP or (y) that have
not had and would not reasonably be expected to have, individually or in the
aggregate, a Material Adverse Effect. There are no Liens for any taxes upon
the assets of ATC or the ATC Subsidiaries, other than (i) statutory Liens for
taxes not yet due and payable, (ii) Liens for taxes contested in good faith
by appropriate proceedings and (iii) Liens that are not, and would not
reasonably be expected to be, material to the businesses of ATC and the ATC
Subsidiaries, taken as a whole.



(b) No deficiencies for any taxes have been proposed, asserted or assessed
in writing against ATC or any of the ATC Subsidiaries that are not adequately
reserved for, except for deficiencies that, individually or in the aggregate,
have not had and would not reasonably be expected to have a Material Adverse
Effect, and no requests for waivers of the time to assess any such taxes have
been granted or are pending (other than with respect to years that are
currently under examination by the Internal Revenue Service or other
applicable taxing authorities).



(c) Neither ATC nor any of the ATC Subsidiaries has taken any action or
has any knowledge of any fact or circumstance that is reasonably likely to
prevent the transactions contemplated hereby, including the Merger, from
qualifying as a reorganization within the meaning of Section 368 of the Code.



(d) Neither ATC nor any of the ATC Subsidiaries has constituted either
a "distributing corporation" or a "controlled corporation" (within the
meaning of Section 355(a)(1)(A)) in a distribution of stock qualifying for
tax-free treatment under Section 355 of the Code (i) in the two years prior to
the date of this Agreement or (ii) in a distribution which could otherwise
constitute part of a "plan" or "series of related transactions" (within the
meaning of Section 355(e) of the Code) in conjunction with the Merger.

 



(e) Neither ATC nor any of the ATC Subsidiaries has entered into a "listed
transaction" within the meaning of Treasury Regulation §1.6011-4(b)(2).



(f) ATC and the ATC Subsidiaries have complied with all applicable Laws
relating to the payment and withholding of taxes, except where a failure to
comply, individually or in the aggregate, has not had and would
not reasonably be expected to have a Material Adverse Effect.



(g) Neither ATC nor any of the ATC Subsidiaries has any liability for the
taxes of any person (other than ATC and the ATC Subsidiaries) under Treasury
Regulation § 1.1502-6 (or any similar provision of any state, local or foreign
law) as a transferee or successor, by contract or otherwise that,
individually or in the aggregate, has had or would reasonably be expected to
have a Material Adverse Effect.



 

26 Section 4.10. _Change of Control Agreement; No Excess Parachute Payment_.
Neither the execution and delivery of this Agreement nor the consummation of
the Merger or the other transactions contemplated by this Agreement will
(either alone or in conjunction with any other event) result in, cause the
accelerated vesting or delivery of, or increase the amount or value of, any
payment or benefit to any director, officer or employee of ATC or any ATC
Subsidiary. No amount paid or payable by ATC or any ATC Subsidiary in
connection with the Merger or the other transactions contemplated by
this Agreement, including accelerated vesting of options (either solely as a
result thereof or as a result of such transactions in conjunction with any
other event), will be an "excess parachute payment" within the meaning of
Section 280G of the Code. Neither ATC nor any ATC Subsidiary has any
obligation to pay or otherwise reimburse any person for paying any tax imposed
under Section 4999 of the Code.



Section 4.11. _Litigation_.



(a) There is no Litigation that which, if adversely determined, individually
or in the aggregate would reasonably be expected to have a Material
Adverse Effect. There is no suit, action or proceeding (including in
connection with the consummation of the Merger) pending or, to the knowledge
of ATC, threatened, against or affecting ATC or any of the ATC Subsidiaries or
any of their respective assets that, individually or in the aggregate, has
had or would reasonably be expected to have a Material Adverse Effect.



(b) There is not any Order of any Governmental Entity or arbitrator
outstanding against, or, to the knowledge of ATC, investigation by, any
Governmental Entity involving ATC or any of the ATC Subsidiaries or any of
their respective assets that, individually or in the aggregate, has had or

(c) This Section 4.11 does not relate to tax matters, employee
benefits matters, labor relations matters, or environmental matters which are
the subjects of Sections 4.9, 4.14, 4.15 and 4.16, respectively.



Section 4.12. _Contracts and Commitments_.



(a) Section 4.12(a) of the ATC Disclosure Letter sets forth a true and
complete list as of the date hereof of each ATC Material Contract. "

defined in Section 601(b)(10) of Regulation S-K of the SEC, (ii) a contract,
agreement or arrangement which contains any non-compete or exclusivity
provisions with respect to the business of or geographic area with respect to
ATC or any ATC Subsidiary, or restricts the conduct of the business of ATC or
any ATC Subsidiary, or the geographic area or manner in which ATC or any ATC
Subsidiary may conduct business, in each case in any material respect, (iii)
a contract, agreement or arrangement between ATC or any ATC Subsidiary on the
one hand, and any officer, director or person directly or indirectly owning,
controlling or holding power to vote 5% or more of ATCs outstanding voting
securities (other than compensation arrangements involving a director or
officer of ATC listed or described in Section 4.14 of the ATC Disclosure
Letter), on the other hand, or (iv) a contract, agreement or arrangement to

such contract or (D) is a material arrangement governing the legal
relationship between ATC or any ATC Subsidiary and one of the ten largest
customers of ATC and any ATC Subsidiaries, taken as a whole, for the calendar
year ended December 31, 2004. ATC has delivered or made available true and
complete copies of all such agreements, arrangements and commitments to
SpectraSite.



(b) Except as would not reasonably be expected to have, individually or in the
aggregate, a Material Adverse Effect, the ATC Material Contracts are legal,
valid, binding and enforceable in accordance with their respective  



 

27  terms with respect to ATC and, to the knowledge of ATC, with respect to each
other party to any of such ATC Material Contracts, except, in each case, to
the extent that enforcement of rights and remedies created by any ATC
Material Contracts are subject to bankruptcy, insolvency, fraudulent transfer,
reorganization, moratorium and similar Laws of general application related to
or affecting creditors rights and to general equity principles. There are no
existing defaults, violations or breaches by ATC or any ATC Subsidiary of any
notes, bonds, mortgages, indentures, contracts, agreements or leases to which
ATC or any of the ATC Subsidiaries is a party or by which ATC or any of the
ATC Subsidiaries or any property or asset of ATC or any of the ATC
Subsidiaries is bound or affected, including any ATC Material Contract (or
events or conditions which, with notice or lapse of time or both would
constitute such a default, violation or breach) and, to the knowledge of ATC,
there are no such defaults, violations or breaches (or events or conditions
which, with notice or lapse of time or both, would constitute such a default,
violation or breach) with respect to any third party to any such notes, bonds,
mortgages, indentures, contracts, agreements or leases that, in any such case,
has had or would reasonably be expected to have, individually or in the
aggregate, a Material Adverse Effect. ATC has no knowledge of any pending or
threatened bankruptcy, insolvency or similar proceeding with respect to any
party to any ATC Material Contract which has had or would reasonably be
expected to have a Material Adverse Effect. Section 4.12(b) of the ATC
Disclosure Letter identifies each ATC Material Contract set forth therein that
requires the consent of or notice to the other party thereto to avoid any
material breach, default or violation of such contract, agreement or other
instrument in connection with the transactions contemplated hereby. Neither
ATC nor any ATC Subsidiary is a party to any voting agreement with respect to
the voting of any securities of ATC. Neither ATC nor any ATC Subsidiary
has any contractual obligation to file a registration statement under the
Securities Act, in respect of any securities of ATC or any ATC Subsidiary.



Section 4.13. _Information Supplied_. The information supplied or to be

first mailed to the stockholders of SpectraSite and ATC, (iii) the time of
the ATC Stockholders Meeting and (iv) the Effective Time, contain any untrue
statement of a material fact or omit to state any material fact required to be
stated therein or necessary in order to make the statements made therein, in
light of the circumstances under which they were made, not misleading. If, at
anytime prior to the Effective Time, any event or circumstance relating to ATC
or Merger Sub or any ATC Subsidiary, or their respective officers or
directors, should be discovered by ATC which should be set forth in an
amendment or supplement to the Registration Statement or Joint Proxy
Statement, ATC shall promptly inform SpectraSite. All documents that ATC

other transactions contemplated by this Agreement will comply as to form and
substance in all material respects with the applicable requirements of the
Securities Act and the rules and regulations thereunder and the Exchange Act
and the rules and regulations thereunder. Notwithstanding the foregoing, no
representation or warranty is made by ATC or Merger Sub with respect to

(a) Section 4.14 of the ATC Disclosure Letter sets forth a list as of the date
hereof of all "employee pension benefit plans" (as defined in Section 3(2) of
ERISA) under which ATC or any ATC Subsidiaries has any liability (sometimes
referred to individually as an " _ATC Pension Plan_ " and collectively as the
" _ATC Pension Plans_ "), all "employee welfare benefit plans" (as defined in
Section 3(1) of ERISA) under which ATC or any ATC Subsidiaries has any

contributed to or required to be maintained or contributed to by ATC or any
ATC Subsidiaries for the benefit of any present or former
officers, employees, directors or independent  



 

28  contractors of ATC or any ATC Subsidiaries and under which ATC or any of the
ATC Subsidiaries has any actual or contingent material liabilities (each of
the foregoing being referred to individually as an " _ATC Benefit Plan_ " and
each of the foregoing together with the ATC Pension Plans and ATC Welfare
Plans being referred to collectively as the " _ATC Benefit Plans_ "). 



(b) ATC has made available to SpectraSite true and complete copies of (1)
each ATC Benefit Plan (or, in the case of any unwritten ATC Benefit Plan, a

Section 412 of the Code or is otherwise a plan described in Section 3(40) of
ERISA or a plan described in Section 413 of the Code. Other than severance
benefits provided under a ATC Benefit Plan, no ATC Welfare Plan provides
benefits to, or on behalf of, any former employee after the termination of
employment except (1) where the full cost of such benefit is borne entirely by
the former employee (or his eligible dependents or beneficiaries), (2) where
plan benefits are payable through a trust, the fair market value of the assets
of which equal or exceed the present value of the liabilities of such plan or
(3) where the benefit is required by Section 4980B of the Code.



(c) Except as has not had or would not reasonably be expected to have,
individually or in the aggregate, a Material Adverse Effect: (i) each ATC
Benefit Plan in effect on the date hereof has been administered in all
respects in accordance with its terms, and ATC and each of the ATC
Subsidiaries and all ATC Benefit Plans are in compliance with the applicable
provisions of ERISA, the Code and other applicable Laws as to the ATC Benefit
Plans; (ii) all contributions, including participant contributions, required
under each ATC Benefit Plan have been made in full on a timely and proper
basis pursuant to the terms of such plans and applicable Law; (iii) with
respect to the ATC Benefit Plans, individually and in the aggregate, no event

any of the ATC Subsidiaries could reasonably be expected to become subject to
liability under ERISA, the Code or any other applicable Law; (iv) the amounts
payable pursuant to the terms of a ATC Benefit Plan will not be subject to any
income tax deduction limit under Section 162(m) of the Code or any other
applicable Law; (v) each ATC Pension Plan that is intended to comply with the

income taxes under Section 501(a) of the Code, and no such determination
letter has been revoked and, to the knowledge of ATC, revocation has not been
threatened; (vi) ATC has made available to SpectraSite a copy of the most
recent determination letter received with respect to each ATC Pension Plan for
which such a letter has been issued, as well as a copy of any pending
application for a determination letter; (vii) there are no understandings,
agreements or undertakings, written or oral, with any person (other than the
express terms of any ATC Benefit Plans) that would (pursuant to any such
understandings, agreements or undertakings) reasonably be expected to
result in any liabilities if any ATC Benefit Plan was amended or terminated
on or at any time after the Effective Time or that would prevent any
unilateral action by ATC (or, after the Effective Time, SpectraSite) to effect
such amendment or termination; (viii) no present or former officers,
employees, directors or independent contractors of ATC or any ATC Subsidiaries
will be entitled to any additional benefits or any acceleration of the time of
payment, funding or vesting of any benefits under any ATC Benefit Plan as a
result of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement; (ix) neither the
execution and delivery of this Agreement, nor the consummation of any
transaction contemplated by this Agreement (alone or in conjunction with
a termination of employment) will (A) trigger any funding (through a grantor
trust or otherwise) of any compensation or benefits or (B) result in any
violation or breach of, or a default (with or without notice or lapse of time
or both) under any ATC Benefit Plan; (x) other than as set forth in any ATC
Benefit Plans or as may be required to avoid any adverse tax consequence under
Section 409A of the Code, since December 31, 2004, there  



 

29  has not been any adoption or amendment in any material respect by ATC or any
ATC Subsidiaries of any ATC Benefit Plan or any agreement (whether or
not legally binding) to adopt or amend any such plan; and (xi) only officers,
directors and employees of ATC or any ATC Subsidiaries are eligible for
compensation or benefits under the terms of each ATC Benefit Plan, and each
individual who is classified by ATC or any ATC Subsidiary as an "employee" or
as an "independent contractor" is properly so classified.



Section 4.15. _Labor and Employment Matters_.



(a) Since February 10, 2003, neither ATC nor any of the ATC Subsidiaries has
been a party to, or bound by, or conducted negotiations regarding,
any collective bargaining agreement or other contracts, arrangements,
agreements or understandings with a labor union or labor organization that was
certified by the NLRB or voluntarily recognized or recognized under foreign
Law. There is no existing, pending or, to the knowledge of ATC, threatened
(i) Concerted Action involving the employees of ATC or any of the ATC

aggregate has had or would reasonably be expected to have a Material Adverse
Effect. To the knowledge of ATC, neither the employees of ATC nor the
employees of any of the ATC Subsidiaries have engaged in a Concerted Action in
the past three years that has had or would reasonably be expected to have a
Material Adverse Effect.



(b) To the knowledge of ATC, none of ATC, any of the ATC Subsidiaries or
any of their respective representatives or employees has committed an unfair
labor practice in connection with the operation of the respective businesses
of ATC or any of the ATC Subsidiaries, which has had or would reasonably be
expected to have, individually or in the aggregate, a Material Adverse
Effect. Each of ATC and the ATC Subsidiaries is in compliance with all
applicable Laws respecting labor, employment, fair employment practices, terms
and conditions of employment, workers compensation, occupational safety,
plant closings, mass layoffs, and wages and hours, except where such failure
has not had and would not reasonably be expected to have, individually or in
the aggregate, a Material Adverse Effect. There are no material controversies
pending or, to the knowledge of ATC, threatened between ATC, the ATC
Subsidiaries and any of its current or former employees which have resulted
in, or would reasonably be expected to result in, an action, suit,
proceeding, claim, arbitration or investigation before any Governmental
Entity which has had, or would reasonably be expected to have, individually or
in the aggregate, a Material Adverse Effect.

things necessary, proper or advisable under Law to consummate and make
effective the Merger and the other transactions contemplated by

to carry out the purposes of this Agreement, the proper officers of each party

efforts to take all such action.

necessary to ensure that no state anti-takeover statute or similar statute or
regulation is or becomes operative with respect to this Agreement, the Merger
or any other transactions contemplated by this Agreement and (ii) if any state

becomes operative with respect to this Agreement, the Merger or any other

contemplated by this Agreement and otherwise to minimize the effect of such
statute or regulation on the Merger and the other transactions contemplated by
this Agreement.



(c) Each of SpectraSite and ATC shall, in connection with its obligation
to use reasonable best efforts to obtain all requisite approvals and
authorizations for the transactions contemplated by this Agreement under the
HSR Act or any other federal, state or foreign antitrust or fair trade law,
use its reasonable best efforts to (i) cooperate in all respects with each
other in connection with any filing or submission and in connection with any
investigation or other inquiry, including any proceeding initiated by a
private party, (ii) promptly inform the other party of any communication

party, in each case regarding any of the transactions contemplated hereby,
(iii) permit the other party, or the other partys legal counsel, to review

such Governmental Entity or private party may have to such transactions under
such Law so as to permit consummation of the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement.



(e) For purposes of this Section 5.5, "reasonable best efforts" shall include,
as necessary, the obligation to enter into a settlement, undertaking, consent
decree, stipulation or other agreement with a Governmental Entity  



 

37  regarding antitrust matters that requires a party to divest or hold separate
any of its or its subsidiaries assets; provided, however, that nothing
in this Agreement shall require or be deemed to require (i) ATC or
SpectraSite to agree to, or proffer to, divest or hold separate any assets or
any portion of any business of ATC and the ATC Subsidiaries (after giving
effect to the Merger) or agree to any restriction, condition or other
limitation on the conduct of their respective businesses, to the extent that
doing so would reasonably be expected to have, individually or in the
aggregate, a Combined Company Material Adverse Effect, or (ii) SpectraSite or
ATC to agree to, or proffer to, divest or hold separate any assets or any
portion of any business of SpectraSite or any of the SpectraSite Subsidiaries
or ATC or any of the ATC Subsidiaries or agree to any material
restriction, condition or other limitation on the conduct of their respective
businesses, as the case may be, or take any other similar action, that is not
conditional on the consummation of the Merger. The term " _Combined Company
Material Adverse Effect_ " means a Material Adverse Effect, after giving
effect to the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, on ATC and the ATC
Subsidiaries, taken as a whole; provided, that for the avoidance of doubt it
is understood and agreed by the parties hereto that SpectraSite and the
SpectraSite Subsidiaries shall constitute Subsidiaries of ATC for purposes of
determining the existence of a Combined Company Material Adverse Effect.



(f) ATC shall perform, or cause to be performed, when due all obligations
of Merger Sub under this Agreement.



Section 5.6. _No Solicitation_.



(a) _SpectraSite_.



(i) SpectraSite shall not, nor shall it authorize or permit any of the

indirectly, (A) solicit, initiate or encourage, or take any other action
designed to, or which would reasonably be expected to, facilitate, any
SpectraSite Takeover Proposal or (B) enter into, continue or otherwise
participate in any discussions or negotiations regarding, or furnish to any
person any information, or otherwise cooperate with, any SpectraSite Takeover
Proposal. SpectraSite shall, and shall cause the SpectraSite Subsidiaries and
its Representatives to, immediately cease and cause to be terminated all
existing discussions or negotiations with any person conducted heretofore with
respect to any SpectraSite Takeover Proposal and request the prompt return or
destruction of all confidential information previously furnished.
Notwithstanding the foregoing, at any time prior to obtaining the SpectraSite
Stockholder Approval, in response to a bona fide written SpectraSite Takeover
Proposal that the Board of Directors of SpectraSite determines in good faith
(after consultation with outside counsel and a financial advisor of nationally
recognized reputation) constitutes, or would reasonably be expected to lead
to, a SpectraSite Superior Proposal, and which SpectraSite Takeover Proposal
was not solicited after the date hereof, was made after the date hereof and
did not otherwise result from a breach of this Section 5.6(a)(i), SpectraSite
may, if its Board of Directors determines in good faith (after consultation
with outside counsel) that it is required to do so to comply with its
fiduciary duties to the stockholders of SpectraSite under applicable Law, and
subject to compliance with this Section 5.6(a)(i) and after giving
ATC written notice of such determination, (x) furnish information with
respect to SpectraSite and the SpectraSite Subsidiaries to the person making
such SpectraSite Takeover Proposal (and its Representatives) pursuant to a
customary confidentiality agreement not less restrictive of such person than
the Confidentiality Agreement; _provided_ that (1) all such information has
previously been provided to ATC or is provided to ATC prior to the time it is
provided to such person and (2) such customary confidentiality agreement
expressly provides the right for SpectraSite to comply with the terms of this
Agreement, including Section 5.6(a)(iii), and (y) participate in discussions
or negotiations with the person making such SpectraSite Takeover Proposal
(and its Representatives) regarding such SpectraSite Takeover Proposal.



The term " _SpectraSite Takeover Proposal_ " means any inquiry, proposal or
offer from any person relating to, or that would reasonably be expected to
lead to, any direct or indirect acquisition or purchase, in one transaction or
a series of transactions, of assets or businesses that constitute 20% or more
of the revenues, net income, EBITDA (earnings before interest expense, taxes,
depreciation and amortization) or the assets of SpectraSite and the
SpectraSite Subsidiaries, taken as a whole, or 20% or more of any class of  



 

38  equity securities of SpectraSite, any tender offer or exchange offer that if
consummated would result in any person beneficially owning 20% or more of
any class of equity securities of SpectraSite, or any merger, consolidation,

venture, binding share exchange or similar transaction involving SpectraSite
pursuant to which any person or the stockholders of any person would own 20%
or more of any class of equity securities of SpectraSite or of any resulting
parent company of SpectraSite, other than the transactions contemplated by
this Agreement.



The term " _SpectraSite Superior Proposal_ " means a SpectraSite Takeover
Proposal ( _provided_ that for purposes of this definition references to 20%
in the definition of "SpectraSite Takeover Proposal" shall be deemed to be
references to 50%) which the Board of Directors of SpectraSite determines in
good faith (after consultation with outside counsel and a financial advisor of
nationally recognized reputation) to be (i) more favorable to the stockholders
of SpectraSite than the Merger, taking into account all relevant factors
(including all the terms and conditions of such proposal and this Agreement
(including any changes to the terms of this Agreement proposed by ATC in
response to such offer or otherwise)) and (ii) reasonably capable of being
completed, taking into account all financial, legal, regulatory and other
aspects of such proposal.



(ii) Neither the Board of Directors of SpectraSite nor any committee thereof
shall, (A) (1) withdraw (or qualify or modify in a manner adverse to ATC or
Merger Sub), or publicly propose to withdraw (or qualify or modify in a manner

declaration of advisability by such Board of Directors or any such
committee thereof of this Agreement, the Merger or the other transactions
contemplated by this Agreement or (2) recommend, adopt, approve or declare

agreement or other similar agreement constituting or related to, or that is
intended to or would reasonably be expected to lead to, any SpectraSite
Takeover Proposal (other than a confidentiality agreement referred to
in Section 5.6(a)(i) pursuant to and in accordance with the limitations set
forth therein) (a " _SpectraSite Acquisition Agreement_ "). Notwithstanding
the foregoing, at any time prior to obtaining the SpectraSite Stockholder
Approval, the Board of Directors of SpectraSite may make a SpectraSite
Adverse Recommendation Change described in clause (A)(2) above if such Board
of Directors determines in good faith (after consultation with outside
counsel) that it is required to do so to comply with its fiduciary duties to
the stockholders of SpectraSite under applicable Law; _provided_ , _however_ ,
that no such SpectraSite Adverse Recommendation Change may be made until after
the fifth calendar day following ATCs receipt of written notice (a "
_SpectraSite Notice of Adverse Recommendation_ ") from SpectraSite advising
ATC that the Board of Directors of SpectraSite intends to take such action and
specifying the reasons therefor, including the terms and conditions of any
SpectraSite Superior Proposal that is the basis of the proposed action by the
Board of Directors of SpectraSite (it being understood and agreed that (x) any
amendment to any material term of such SpectraSite Superior Proposal or (y)
with respect to any previous SpectraSite Adverse Recommendation Change, any
material change in the principal stated rationale by the Board of Directors of
SpectraSite for such previous SpectraSite Adverse Recommendation
Change, shall, in the case of either (x) or (y), require a new SpectraSite
Notice of Adverse Recommendation and a new five (5) calendar day period). In
determining whether to make a SpectraSite Adverse Recommendation Change, the
Board of Directors of SpectraSite shall take into account any changes to the
terms of this Agreement proposed by ATC in response to a SpectraSite Notice of
Adverse Recommendation or otherwise.



(iii) In addition to the obligations of SpectraSite set forth in Sections
5.6(a)(i) and 5.6(a)(ii), (A) SpectraSite shall promptly advise ATC orally
and in writing (and in any case within 24 hours) of any SpectraSite Takeover
Proposal or any inquiry that would reasonably be expected to lead to any
SpectraSite Takeover Proposal, the material terms and conditions of any such
SpectraSite Takeover Proposal or inquiry  



 

39  (including any changes thereto) and the identity of the person making any
such SpectraSite Takeover Proposal or inquiry and (B) SpectraSite shall (1)
keep ATC fully and promptly informed of the status and material details
(including any change to any material term thereof) of any such SpectraSite
Takeover Proposal or inquiry and (2) provide to ATC promptly after receipt or

sent or provided to SpectraSite or any of the SpectraSite Subsidiaries from
any person that describes any of the terms or conditions of any SpectraSite
Takeover Proposal.



(iv) Nothing contained in this Section 5.6(a) shall prohibit SpectraSite from
taking and disclosing to its stockholders a position contemplated by Rule
14(e)-2(a) or Rule 14(d)-9 promulgated under the Exchange Act or from making
any disclosure to SpectraSites stockholders if, in the good faith
judgment of the Board of Directors of SpectraSite, after consultation with
independent outside counsel, failure to so disclose would be inconsistent with
applicable Law; _provided_ , _however_ , that all actions taken or agreed to
be taken by SpectraSite or the Board of Directors of SpectraSite or any
committee thereof shall comply with the provisions of Section 5.6(a)(ii).



(b) _ATC_.



(i) ATC shall not, nor shall it authorize or permit any of the ATC
Subsidiaries or its or their Representatives to, directly or indirectly, (A)
solicit, initiate or encourage, or take any other action designed to, or which
would reasonably be expected to, facilitate, any ATC Takeover Proposal or (B)
enter into, continue or otherwise participate in any discussions
or negotiations regarding, or furnish to any person any information, or
otherwise cooperate with, any ATC Takeover Proposal. ATC shall, and shall
cause the ATC Subsidiaries and its Representatives to, immediately cease and
cause to be terminated all existing discussions or negotiations with any
person conducted heretofore with respect to any ATC Takeover Proposal and
request the prompt return or destruction of all confidential information
previously furnished. Notwithstanding the foregoing, at any time prior to
obtaining the ATC Stockholder Approval, in response to a bona fide written ATC
Takeover Proposal that the Board of Directors of ATC determines in good faith
(after consultation with outside counsel and a financial advisor
of nationally recognized reputation) constitutes, or would reasonably be
expected to lead to, an ATC Superior Proposal, and which ATC Takeover Proposal
was not solicited after the date hereof, was made after the date hereof and
did not otherwise result from a breach of this Section 5.6(b)(i), ATC may, if
its Board of Directors determines in good faith (after consultation with
outside counsel) that it is required to do so to comply with its fiduciary
duties to the stockholders of ATC under applicable Law, and subject to
compliance with this Section 5.6(b)(i) and after giving SpectraSite written
notice of such determination, (x) furnish information with respect to ATC and
the ATC Subsidiaries to the person making such ATC Takeover Proposal (and its
Representatives) pursuant to a customary confidentiality agreement not less
restrictive of such person than the Confidentiality Agreement; _provided_ that
(1) all such information has previously been provided to SpectraSite or is
provided to SpectraSite prior to the time it is provided to such person and
(2) such customary confidentiality agreement expressly provides the right for
ATC to comply with the terms of this Agreement, including Section 5.6(b)(iii),
and (y) participate in discussions or negotiations with the person making
such ATC Takeover Proposal (and its Representatives) regarding such ATC
Takeover Proposal.



The term " _ATC Takeover Proposal_ " means any inquiry, proposal or offer from
any person relating to, or that would reasonably be expected to lead to, any
direct or indirect acquisition or purchase, in one transaction or a series of
transactions, of assets or businesses that constitute 20% or more of the

depreciation and amortization) or the assets of ATC and the ATC Subsidiaries,
taken as a whole, or 20% or more of any class of equity securities of ATC, any
tender offer or exchange offer that if consummated would result in any person
beneficially owning 20% or more of any class of equity securities of ATC, or
any merger, consolidation, business combination, recapitalization,
liquidation, dissolution, joint venture, binding share exchange or similar
transaction involving ATC pursuant to which any person or the stockholders of

of any resulting parent company of ATC, other than the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement.



 

40 The term " _ATC Superior Proposal_ " means an ATC Takeover Proposal (provided

advisability by such Board of Directors or any such committee thereof of this
Agreement, the Merger or the other transactions contemplated by this Agreement
(including the issuance of shares of ATC Common Stock pursuant to the Merger)
or (2) recommend, adopt, approve or declare advisable, or propose publicly to
recommend, adopt, approve or declare advisable, any ATC Takeover Proposal (any
action described in this clause (A) being referred to as an " _ATC Adverse
Recommendation Change_ ") or (B) adopt, approve, recommend or declare
advisable, or propose to adopt, approve, recommend or declare advisable, or
allow ATC or any of the ATC Subsidiaries to execute or enter into, any letter
of intent, memorandum of understanding, agreement in principle, merger
agreement, acquisition agreement, option agreement, joint venture agreement,
partnership agreement or other similar agreement constituting or related to,

Takeover Proposal (other than a confidentiality agreement referred to in
Section 5.6(b)(i) pursuant to and in accordance with the limitations set forth
therein) (an " _ATC Acquisition Agreement_ "). Notwithstanding the foregoing,

may be made until after the fifth calendar day following SpectraSites receipt
of written notice (an " _ATC Notice of Adverse Recommendation_ ") from ATC
advising SpectraSite that the Board of Directors of ATC intends to take such
action and specifying the reasons therefor, including the terms and conditions
of any ATC Superior Proposal that is the basis of the proposed action by the
Board of Directors of ATC (it being understood and agreed that (x) any
amendment to any material term of such ATC Superior Proposal or (y) with
respect to any previous ATC Adverse Recommendation Change, any material change
in the principal stated rationale by the Board of Directors of ATC for
such previous ATC Adverse Recommendation Change, shall, in the case of either
(x) or (y), require a new ATC Notice of Adverse Recommendation and a new five
(5) calendar day period). In determining whether to make an ATC Adverse
Recommendation Change, the Board of Directors of ATC shall take into account
any changes to the terms of this Agreement proposed by SpectraSite in response
to an ATC Notice of Adverse Recommendation or otherwise.



(iii) In addition to the obligations of ATC set forth in Sections 5.6(b)(i)
and 5.6(b)(ii), (A) ATC shall promptly advise SpectraSite orally and in

_however_ , that all actions taken or agreed to be taken by ATC or the Board
of Directors of ATC or any committee thereof shall comply with the provisions
of Section 5.6(b)(ii).

other the opportunity to participate in the defense or settlement of any
stockholder Litigation against SpectraSite and its directors and/or ATC and
its directors relating to the Merger or the other transactions contemplated by
this Agreement; _provided_ , _however_ , that no such settlement shall be
agreed to without the other partys prior written consent, which consent
shall not be unreasonably conditioned, withheld or delayed.



Section 5.8. _Indemnification_.



(a) It is understood and agreed that all rights to indemnification by
SpectraSite now existing in favor of each present and former director and
officer of SpectraSite or the SpectraSite Subsidiaries (the " _Indemnified
Parties_ ") as provided in SpectraSite Certificate of Incorporation or the
SpectraSite Bylaws, in each case as in effect on the date of this Agreement,
or pursuant to any other agreements in effect on the date hereof, copies of
which have been provided to ATC, shall survive the Merger, and ATC shall (i)
cause the Surviving Company to continue in full force and effect for a period
of at least six years from the Effective Time and (ii) perform, or cause the
Surviving Company to perform, in a timely manner, the Surviving Companys
obligations with respect thereto. ATC agrees that any claims for

currently maintained by SpectraSite (provided that the Surviving Company may
substitute therefor policies of at least the same coverage containing terms
and conditions which are not materially less favorable) with respect to acts
or omissions occurring prior to the Effective Time; _provided_ , _however_ ,
that in no event shall the Surviving Company be required to expend pursuant
to this Section 5.8(b) more than an amount per year equal to two hundred
percent (200%) of current annual premiums paid by SpectraSite for the DandO

sentence, the Surviving Company would be required to expend more than two
hundred percent (200%) of current annual premiums, the Surviving Company shall

premiums equal to two hundred percent (200%) of current annual premiums.



(c) The provisions of this Section 5.8 will survive the Effective Time and
are intended to be for the benefit of, and will be enforceable by, each
Indemnified Party and his or her heirs and representatives. ATC will pay or
cause to be paid (as incurred) all expenses, including reasonable fees and
expenses of counsel, that an Indemnified Party may incur in enforcing the
indemnity and other obligations provided for in this Section 5.8 (subject to
reimbursement if the Indemnified Party is subsequently determined not be
entitled to indemnification under Section 5.8(a)).

merges into any other person and is not the continuing or surviving
corporation or entity of such consolidation or merger or (ii) transfers or
conveys all or substantially all of its properties and assets to any person,
then, and in each such case, to the extent necessary, proper provisions will

assume the obligations set forth in this Section 5.8.

consultation, except as may be required by Law or any listing agreement with a
national securities exchange or trading system to which ATC or SpectraSite is
a party. The parties agree that the initial press release(s) to be issued
with respect to the transactions contemplated by this Agreement shall be in
the form agreed to by the parties.



Section 5.10. _Registration Statement; Joint Proxy Statement_.



(a) As promptly as practicable after the execution of this Agreement, (i) ATC
and SpectraSite shall jointly prepare and file with the SEC the joint proxy

stockholders of ATC relating to the meeting of SpectraSites stockholders (the

the case of SpectraSites stockholders, the approval and adoption of this

Agreement shall be submitted to the stockholders of SpectraSite at the
SpectraSite Stockholders Meeting for the purpose of obtaining the  



 

43  SpectraSite Stockholder Approval and nothing contained herein shall be
deemed to relieve SpectraSite of such obligation; _provided_ , _however_

terminate this Agreement pursuant to and in accordance with Section 7.1(h).



(b) ATC shall cause the ATC Stockholders Meeting to be duly called and held
as soon as practicable for the purpose of obtaining the ATC

shall be submitted to the stockholders of ATC at the ATC Stockholders Meeting

contained herein shall be deemed to relieve ATC of such obligation;
_provided_ , _however_ , that the foregoing shall not be deemed to limit ATCs
right to terminate this Agreement pursuant to and in accordance with Section

Section 5.12. _Contribution of Assets and Liabilities after Effective Time_.
Unless ATC has contributed the entire interest in Merger Sub to a limited
liability company wholly owned by ATC as contemplated by the sixth WHEREAS

44 Section 5.15. _Tax Treatment of Merger_. Each of ATC and SpectraSite shall use
reasonable best efforts to (a) cause the Merger to qualify as a

cause the Merger to fail to so qualify as a reorganization under Section
368(a) of the Code.

SpectraSite and ATC in form and substance reasonably satisfactory to ATC and
customary in scope and substance for agreed upon procedures letters delivered
by independent public accountants in connection with registration statements
and proxy statements similar to the Registration Statement and the Joint

scope and substance for agreed upon procedures letters delivered by
independent public accountants in connection with registration statements and
proxy statements similar to the Registration Statement and the Joint Proxy
Statement; provided, that the failure of such a letter to be delivered by

the SpectraSite Credit Agreement) to permit the Merger, and (ii) effect such
other amendments to the SpectraSite Credit Agreement as ATC shall reasonably
request (in any case, the " _SpectraSite Bank Amendment_ "). If, ATC requests
the SpectraSite Bank Amendment but, despite the reasonable best efforts of
SpectraSite and ATC to obtain such SpectraSite Bank Amendment, ATC and
SpectraSite, on the one hand, and the Majority Lenders (as defined in the
SpectraSite Credit Agreement), on the other hand, cannot agree to terms of
the SpectraSite Bank Amendment (including any request for the payment of fees
or other amounts) that are acceptable to ATC, then ATC and SpectraSite shall
cooperate and use their respective reasonable best efforts to refinance and
replace the SpectraSite Credit Agreement with a substitute credit facility
that is, to the extent available in the marketplace, on substantially similar
terms as those contained in the SpectraSite Credit Agreement (except that
such substitute credit facility shall permit the Merger or be entered into
effective as of the Merger) and otherwise reasonably acceptable to ATC (a "
_Replacement Credit Agreement_ ").



(b) SpectraSite and ATC shall cooperate with each other with respect to
the SpectraSite Bank Amendment and, if applicable, the Replacement Credit
Agreement. No mailing or other distribution to Lenders (as defined in  



 

45  the SpectraSite Credit Agreement) of an amendment or supplement to, the
documents relating to the SpectraSite Bank Amendment or, if applicable,
the Replacement Credit Facility will be made by SpectraSite without providing
ATC the opportunity to review and comment thereon.



(c) Notwithstanding the foregoing, ATC may, in its sole discretion, by notice
to SpectraSite, elect to refinance or otherwise repay in full the SpectraSite
Credit Agreement and terminate all obligations thereunder as of the Effective
Time, and SpectraSite shall, and shall cause SpectraSites applicable
Subsidiary to, cooperate with ATC with respect to such refinancing or
other repayment and any financing arrangements in connection therewith,
including pursuant to the terms of a Replacement Credit Agreement.



Section 5.18. _Consent Solicitation; Supplemental Indenture; Tender Offer_. If

obtaining, effective as of the Effective Time, any consents to, amendments to
or waivers from the Indenture dated as of May 21, 2003 between SpectraSite
and the Bank of New York, as trustee (the " _Trustee_ ") (the " _SpectraSite
Indenture_ ") relating to the outstanding 8.25% Senior Notes due 2010
of SpectraSite (the " _SpectraSite Notes_ "), including an amendment to the
definition of the term "Change of Control" to exclude the transactions
contemplated hereby, and causing to become effective at the Effective Time
a supplemental indenture to the Indenture reflecting any such consents,
amendments or waivers (the " _Supplemental Indenture_ ") and (B) causing the
Surviving Company to enter with the Trustee into a supplemental indenture
supplementing the SpectraSite Indenture as required by Article V of the
SpectraSite Indenture or (ii) conducting a tender offer, either on it own or
in connection with a consent solicitation contemplated by clause (i)(A) of
this Section 5.18, for the SpectraSite Notes that is conditioned upon

SpectraSite shall deliver to ATC a letter identifying all persons who are, in
the opinion of SpectraSite, at the time of this Agreement is submitted for
adoption by the stockholders of SpectraSite, "affiliates" of SpectraSite
for purposes of Rule 145 under the Securities Act. SpectraSite shall use
commercially reasonable efforts to cause each such person to deliver to ATC as
of the Closing Date, a written agreement substantially in the form attached as
Exhibit 5.19 hereto; provided, that the failure of any such letter to be
delivered shall not result in a failure of a condition to Closing (including

their respective rights under Section 5.6 of this Agreement, during the
period from the date of this Agreement through the Effective Time, neither ATC
nor SpectraSite shall terminate, amend, modify or waive any provision of any
confidentiality or standstill agreement to which it or any of its respective
Subsidiaries is a party. During such period, ATC or SpectraSite, as the case
may be, shall enforce, to the fullest extent permitted under applicable law,
the provisions of any such agreement, including by obtaining injunctions to
prevent any breaches of such agreements and to enforce specifically the terms
and provisions thereof in any court of the United States of America or of any
state having jurisdiction.



Section 5.21. _Warrant Agreement_. Promptly following the Effective Time, ATC
shall, as required by Section 12 of the SpectraSite Warrant Agreement, dated
February 10, 2003 (the " _Warrant Agreement_ "), execute a supplement thereto
and cause the notification to holders of SpectraSite Warrants as required by
Section 12 of the Warrant Agreement. ATC shall at all times reserve and keep
available out of its authorized but unissued ATC Common Stock, solely for the
purpose of issuance and delivery upon exercise of the SpectraSite Warrants in
accordance with their terms, such number of shares of ATC Common Stock as
shall then be issuable or deliverable upon exercise of all outstanding but
unexercised SpectraSite Warrants.



 

46 Section 5.22. _Employees_.



(a) Until 90 days following the Effective Time, ATC shall not and shall cause
the Surviving Company not to terminate the employment of any employee who was
employed by SpectraSite immediately prior to the Effective Time (each a "
_Covered Employee_ ") and shall provide each such Covered Employee with the
same or better total compensation package (excluding equity based
compensation) as that in effect for each such Covered Employee immediately
prior to the Effective Time; _provided_ , _however_ , that this Section
5.22(a) shall not (i) apply to Messrs. Clark, Biltz and Slaven or
(ii) prevent ATC or the Surviving Company from terminating any Covered
Employee for "cause" (as such term is defined in the SpectraSite Executive
Severance Plan B).



(b) Without in any way limiting Section 5.22(a), for a period of one year
following the Effective Time, ATC shall or shall cause the Surviving Company
to maintain in effect compensation, employee benefit plans and arrangements
which provide compensation and benefits (excluding equity based compensation)
to the Covered Employees that remain employed by the Surviving Company which
have a value substantially comparable, in the aggregate, to the compensation
and benefits provided by the SpectraSite Benefit Plans as in effect on the
date hereof to such Covered Employees.



(c) For purposes of determining eligibility to participate in, and non-
forfeitable rights under, any employee benefit plan or arrangement of ATC or
the Surviving Company, Covered Employees shall receive service credit for
service with SpectraSite (and with any predecessor or acquired entities or any
other entities for SpectraSite granted service credit) as if such service had
been completed with ATC.



(d) To the extent applicable, ATC shall or shall cause the Surviving Company
to waive or cause its insurance carriers to waive any pre-existing condition
limitation on participation and coverage applicable to any Covered Employee
or any of his or her covered dependents under any ATC or Surviving Company
health or welfare plan (a " _New Plan_ ") in which such Covered Employee or
covered dependent shall become eligible to participate after the Effective
Time to the extent such Covered Employee or covered dependent was no longer
subject to such pre-existing condition limitation under the corresponding
SpectraSite Benefit Plan in which such Covered Employee or such covered
dependent was participating immediately before he or she became eligible to
participate in the New Plan. ATC shall or shall cause the Surviving Company to
provide each Covered Employee with credit for any co-payments and deductibles
paid prior to the Effective Time and during the calendar year in which the
Effective Time occurs under any SpectraSite Benefit Plan in satisfying any
applicable co-payment and deductible requirements for such calendar year under
any New Plan in which such Covered Employee participates after the Effective
Time.



(e) ATC shall or shall cause the Surviving Company to recognize any unused
paid time off and sick leave hours available to each Covered Employee as of
the Effective Time under SpectraSites paid time off policy applicable to such
Covered Employee and to recognize service by each Covered Employee with
SpectraSite for purposes of determining eligibility for vacation and sick
leave following the Effective Time under the applicable vacation and sick
leave policies of ATC or the Surviving Company.



(f) ATC shall or shall cause the Surviving Company to assume and honor
in accordance with their terms all severance and termination plans and
agreements (including change in control provisions) applicable to Covered
Employees set forth in Section 3.14 of the SpectraSite Disclosure Letter.



(g) Without limiting the scope of Section 8.1, nothing in this Section
5.22 shall confer any rights or remedies of any kind or description upon any
Covered Employee or any other person other than SpectraSite and ATC and their
respective successors and assigns.
