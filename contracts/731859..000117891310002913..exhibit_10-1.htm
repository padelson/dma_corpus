DESCRIPTION OF TRANSACTION.

   
---|--- 
 

  

  

1.1 Purchase and Sale. Subject to the terms and conditions of this Agreement,
on the Closing Date, Seller shall sell, transfer, assign, convey and deliver
to Purchaser, and Purchaser shall purchase from Seller, (i) the Shares and
(ii) the Shareholder Loan.

  

  

1.2 Closing. Unless this Agreement is earlier terminated pursuant to Section 9
hereof, the closing (the "Closing") of such purchase and sale and of the other
transactions contemplated hereby (collectively, the "Transactions"), shall
take place at the offices of Goldfarb, Levy, Eran, Meiri, Tzafrir and Co., 2
Weizmann Street, Tel-Aviv, Israel, at 10:00 a.m., on the third (3rd) business
day after all the conditions set forth in Sections 7 and 8 have been satisfied
or waived, but not earlier than December 30, 2010, or on such other date, time
and place as the parties may mutually agree (the "Closing Date").

  

  

1.3 Purchase Price. The consideration (the "Consideration") for the Shares and
the Shareholder Loan (including any interest accrued thereon and not paid)
shall consist of, and be paid in the following manner:

  

  

(a) On the date hereof, Purchaser shall deposit an amount in cash of Thirty
Million NIS (NIS 30,000,000) in a bank account designated by Seller (such
amount, including any interest accrued thereon: the "Deposit"). The Deposit
shall be held and disposed by Seller to the credit of either Seller or
Purchaser, in accordance with the terms and conditions of this Agreement. At
Closing, the Deposit shall be immediately released to Seller pursuant to the
terms hereof and be applied to and credited against the Consideration in
accordance with Section 1.3(b) below. If Closing does not occur, the Deposit
shall be payable to Seller or to Purchaser in accordance with Section 9. If
the circumstances do not result in the payment of the Deposit to Seller
pursuant to this Section 1.3 or Section 9, the Deposit shall be released to
Purchaser promptly after termination of this Agreement. To the extent that
Seller shall be required to release the Deposit to Purchaser after termination
of this Agreement, Seller will be entitled to withhold and deduct from the
payment of any Deposit (including any interest accrued thereon), the Tax
amount required to be withheld and deducted under any applicable law which are
payable on such Deposit (including any interest accrued thereon). To the
extent that amounts are so withheld by Seller, they shall be treated for all
purposes of this Agreement as having been paid to Purchaser.

  

  

 

 

 

  

 

2  

  

 

 

 

  

  

(b) At Closing, Purchaser shall pay to Seller, by wire transfer of immediately
available funds to an account designated in writing by Seller, an amount in
NIS equal to Six Hundred and Fifty Million NIS (NIS 650,000,000) minus the
Deposit.

  

  

(c) On the date hereof, the Company shall assign to Seller all of its rights
to receive payments (including default interest, if any, and rights to seek
enforcement and damages if such payments are not timely made) from B
Communications Ltd. (f/k/a 012 Smile.Communications Ltd.), a company organized
under the laws of Israel ("BC"), pursuant to that Amendment, Joinder and
Affirmation to the Asset Purchase Agreement, dated as of January 26, 2010, by
and between the Company and BC (the "BC Payments"). The parties hereby agree
that, if BC or any other third party whose consent is required for the same at
Seller\'s reasonable discretion, does not consent in writing to the aforesaid
assignment until the Closing, then, in lieu of such assignment, Purchaser
shall cause the Company, and the Company shall, (i) transfer any such payments
received from BC on or following the date hereof to Seller (net of any
applicable Tax, if any, paid by the Company), immediately following their
receipt, (ii) if not timely received, cooperate with Seller (including by way
of engaging an attorney selected and paid by Seller to pursue litigation), at
Seller\'s expense, to compel BC to make such payments to the Company, and
(iii) upon Seller\'s request, take all other reasonable actions, including
execution of an appropriate power of attorney, to assign all of its causes of
action in connection therewith to allow Seller, at Seller\'s election and
expense, to compel (including litigation) BC to make such payments.

  

  

(d) The aforesaid Consideration to be paid to Seller is exclusive of any VAT,
if applicable (i.e., plus VAT, if applicable). To the extent that the Seller
shall provide to the Purchaser prior to the Closing a valid withholding tax
exemption certificate pursuant to the Israeli Tax Ordinance according to which
the Seller is entitled to full exemption of tax withholding, Purchaser agrees
it shall not deduct or withhold from any consideration payable or otherwise
deliverable pursuant to this Agreement any Tax.

the parties agree to use reasonable best efforts to obtain the Regulatory

all requirements applicable to it of the MoC or the Israeli Antitrust
Commissioner or other applicable agencies or regulatory authorities, as the

cause any of its controlling shareholders and other Affiliates not to, take

(d) Notwithstanding the foregoing, it is hereby agreed that Purchaser shall
not be required to agree to conditions imposed by the Israeli Antitrust
Commissioner and/or MoC and/or any other applicable regulatory authority, if
any, which conditions are either (A) reasonably likely to have a Material
Adverse Effect on the assets and operating profit of Purchaser, and its

ended June 30, 2010; (B) provide for the sale of the Company\'s International

secrets or other confidential information shall be redacted from such updates
and shall be provided to a third party trustee for safekeeping. Purchaser
shall promptly notify Seller of any material written communication made to or
received by such party or its Affiliates from the MoC or the Israeli Antitrust
Commissioner or any other regulatory body regarding any of the transactions
contemplated hereby; permit Seller to review in advance any material written
communication to the MoC or the Israeli Antitrust Commissioner; and shall not

practicable, gives Seller the opportunity to attend, and furnish Seller with
copies of all material correspondence, filings and written communications
between them on one hand and the MoC or the Israeli Antitrust Commissioner or
its respective staff on the other hand, with respect to this Agreement and the
transactions contemplated hereby. This clause (f) shall apply to Seller and

shall not permit any of its Affiliates and Representatives to) issue any press
release or make any public statement regarding this Agreement, or regarding
any of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, without Company\'s
prior written consent. Notwithstanding the provisions of the preceding
sentence, each party or any Affiliate thereof whose shares are publicly traded
shall be permitted to issue any press release or make any public statement as
is required by or (in its reasonable judgment) advisable in connection with
any Legal Requirement, including, without limitation, Nasdaq rules,
providedthat it first consults with the other party hereto as to the timing
and substance thereof. Each of Purchaser, the Company and Seller acknowledge
that certain of the proceedings required to obtain consents to or approvals of
the Transactions from Governmental Bodies are public, and consent to the
filings and disclosures required during the Pre-Closing Period pursuant to
Section 6.1 hereof notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Section
6.2; provided that the parties hereto shall use their commercially reasonable
efforts to cause the Governmental Bodies with which contacts may be made in
order to obtain such consents or approvals to maintain the confidentiality of
this Agreement and the Transactions to the fullest extent practicable. To the
extent inconsistent with the provisions of this Section 6.2, the Non-
Disclosure Agreement dated October 6, 2010 between the Company and Purchaser
(the "Confidentiality Agreement") is expressly superseded hereby and shall be
deemed amended to conform hereto. In addition, the parties agree that, by
virtue of execution of this Agreement, they agree that the Confidentiality

reasonable best efforts to cause the conditions set forth in Section 7 to be
satisfied on a timely basis, and (b) Purchaser shall use its reasonable best
efforts to cause the conditions set forth in Section 8 to be satisfied on a
timely basis.

  

  

(b) Without derogating from the generality of clause (a), other than the
closing conditions set forth in Sections 7 and 8 hereof, the absence of any
consent, approval or authorization of any third party for the transactions
contemplated hereby shall not constitute a condition precedent for Closing, a
ground for terminating or not consummating this Agreement or the transactions
contemplated hereby, or a breach of this Agreement.

  

  

(c) Without derogating from the generality of clause (a), as promptly as
practicable after the execution of this Agreement, Seller and the Company
shall seek to obtain the consent of the Institutional Lenders (the
"Institutional Lenders Consent") to the removal of the Institutional Lenders
Pledges and the cancellation of the Institutional Lenders loan agreement dated
January 31, 2010, to the extent it relates to the Company and the removal of
the Company as a party from such agreement at, and subject to, the Closing.
Purchaser undertakes to cooperate with Seller and the Company in that regard,
including by way of executing appropriate pay-off letters to the benefit of
the Institutional Lenders.

  


 

  

(d) Without derogating from the generality of clause (a), as promptly as
practicable after the execution of this Agreement, the parties shall seek to
obtain the consent of Lending Banks to the transactions contemplated hereunder
and the removal of the Lending Banks Pledges at, and subject to, the Closing
(the "Lenders Bank Consent"). Purchaser undertakes to cooperate with Seller
and the Company in that regard, including by way of executing appropriate
documentation that would grant the Lending Banks the same level of the Lending
Banks Pledges (including guarantees and other forms of security satisfactory
to the Lending Banks); provided that, subject to Purchaser\'s compliance with
this Section 6.3, Purchaser shall not be required to consent to acceleration
of the Lending Banks Loan. Purchaser may, upon written notice to Seller and
the Company of at least thirty (30) days prior to Closing, elect to have the
Company prepay, at and subject to Closing, the Lending Banks Loans and,
subject to any consent, if required, of the Lending Banks, the Company shall
do so at Closing with, and subject to, the full cooperation of Purchaser
(including arranging for a replaced financing to the Company, if needed). In
such case, Purchaser further acknowledges that any prepayment commission or
penalty imposed by the Lending Banks shall be its (or, post Closing, the
Company\'s) sole responsibility and, for the sake of clarity, shall not be
reduced from the Consideration.

  


 

  

 

 

 

  

 

14  

  

 

 

 

  

  

(e) Without derogating from the generality of clause (a), Seller and the
Company shall use best efforts to obtain the consents set forth under the
second and third bullets of Part 2.16(A) of the Disclosure Schedule.

Agreement.

promptly notify Purchaser, and Purchaser shall promptly notify the Company and
Seller, in writing of the discovery of any of the following: (i) any event,
condition, fact or circumstance that occurred or existed on or prior to the
date of this Agreement and that caused or constitutes a material inaccuracy in

Agreement; (ii) any event, condition, fact or circumstance that occurs, arises
or exists after the date of this Agreement and that causes or constitutes, or

inaccuracy in or breach of any representation or warranty made by the relevant
party in this Agreement; (iii) any breach of any material covenant or
obligation of the relevant party; and (iv) any event, condition, fact or
circumstance that would make the timely satisfaction of any of the conditions
set forth in Section 7 or 8 impossible, unlikely or postponed.

  

  

6.6 Information Rights. Purchaser shall cause the Company, and the Company
shall, at the request of Seller and at its reasonable expense (if such
information is not readily prepared by Purchaser due to its own internal or
legal requirements), promptly prepare and furnish (and, where applicable,
cause its accountants to prepare and furnish), such information (including
audited consolidated yearly financial statements and quarterly reviewed
financial statements, if required) relating to the financial condition,
business and corporate affairs of the Company as Seller may from time to time
request in order to comply (including by way of making public filings of such
information and reports) with applicable legal requirements (including
securities and stock exchange rules and guidance from the applicable authority
or regulator)) that apply to Seller or its Affiliates. Without derogating from
and subject to the foregoing, Purchaser shall cause the Company, and the
Company shall, at Seller\'s reasonable expense, prepare and furnish the
information relating to subsequent events, including discussions with
management, management representation, representation from the current
auditors, all in order to and to the extent required to enable Seller and its
auditors to comply with Legal Requirements.‫‫

undertakes to transfer to the Company or to Purchaser, at Purchaser\'s
discretion, the amount specified, and to be used by Purchaser and the Company,
in accordance with, Part 6.7 of the Disclosure Schedule.

respect to such Damage, net of any deductibles; and (D) if a Purchaser
Indemnitee shall be entitled to receive proceeds from a third party (not
affiliated with Purchaser) that are intended to cover a Damage for which a

10.3 Defense of Third Party Claims. In the event of the assertion or
commencement by any Person of any claim or Legal Proceeding (whether against
the Company, against Purchaser or against any other Person) with respect to
which any of the Purchaser Indemnitees or Seller Indemnitees shall have the
right to seek indemnification pursuant to this Section 10, the indemnifying
party shall have the right, at its election, to proceed with the defense of
such claim or Legal Proceeding on its own, with counsel reasonably
satisfactory to the party entitled to indemnification. If such party so
proceeds with the defense of any such claim or Legal Proceeding:

  

  

(a) all reasonable expenses relating to the defense of such claim or Legal
Proceeding shall be borne and paid by the indemnifying party;

  

  

(b) the indemnifying party shall have the right to settle, adjust or
compromise such claim or Legal Proceeding with the consent of party entitled
to indemnification; provided, however, that such consent shall not be
unreasonably withheld.

  

  

Each party seeking indemnification shall give the indemnifying party prompt
notice of the commencement of any such Legal Proceeding against Purchaser,
Seller or the Company (as applicable); provided, however, that any failure to
do so shall not limit any of the rights of the indemnitees under this Section
10 (except to the extent such failure materially prejudices the defense of
such Legal Proceeding).

  

  

10.4 Exercise of Remedies by Third Parties. No Person who is not a party to
this Agreement (or any successor thereto or assign thereof) shall be permitted
to assert any indemnification claim or exercise any other remedy under this
Agreement unless the applicable party to this Agreement (or any successor
thereto or assign thereof) shall have consented to the assertion of such
indemnification claim or the exercise of such other remedy.

  

  

10.5 Sole Remedy. From and after the Closing, the rights of the parties under
this Section 10 shall be the sole and exclusive remedy of the parties with
respect to claims resulting from or relating to any representation, warranty,
covenant or agreement contained in this Agreement. Notwithstanding the above,
each party hereto shall be (a) entitled to seek any available remedy of law or
equity (including rescission or restitution) with respect to fraud and/or
willful misconduct, (b) entitled to seek injunctive relief to enjoin the
breach, or threatened breach, of any provision of this Agreement, and (c)
entitled to seek the equitable remedy of specific performance in connection
with this Agreement.

  

  

10.6 Representations not a Closing Condition. Without derogating from
Purchaser\'s right to seek Damages pursuant to this Agreement, it is hereby
clarified and agreed that completeness or accuracy of any of the
representations and warranties made by the Company or Seller hereunder are
not, and shall not be deemed to be, a closing condition of Purchaser and a
breach of Sections 2 or 3 hereof shall not be a ground for terminating or not
consummating this Agreement or the transactions contemplated hereby.
