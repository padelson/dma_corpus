result in cancellation of Seller's interest therein.

  



  

Section 3.04 _Notice of Title Defects_.

  



   | (a)| If Buyer discovers any Title Defect affecting any Asset, Buyer
shall notify Seller as promptly as possible, but no later than the expiration
of the Examination Period of such alleged Title Defect. To be effective, such
notice must (i) be in writing, (ii) be received by Seller by 5:00 p.m.
Central Standard Time on the expiration date of the Examination Period and
(iii) describe the Title Defect in reasonable detail, to the extent then
reasonably known by Buyer (including the estimated value of such Title Defect

(7) 
--- 

 


--- 

    



   | (b)| Upon the receipt of such effective notice from Buyer, Seller, at

Value of such affected Asset as set forth on _Exhibit C_. 
---|---|--- 
  



   | (c)| The value attributable to each Title Defect (the " _Title Defect
Value_ ") that is asserted by Buyer in the Title Defect notices shall be
determined based upon the criteria set forth below: 
---|---|--- 
  



   | (i)| If the Title Defect is a lien upon any Asset, the Title Defect
Value is the amount reasonably expected to be necessary to be paid to remove
the lien from the affected Asset. 
---|---|--- 
  



   | (ii)| If the Title Defect asserted is that the Net Revenue Interest
attributable to any Well or unit or Well location is less than that stated in
_Exhibit C_ or the Working Interest attributable to any Well or unit or Well
location is greater than that stated in _Exhibit C_, then the Title Defect
Value shall take into account the relative change in the interest from
_Exhibit C_ and the appropriate Allocated Value attributed to such Asset. 
---|---|--- 
  



   | (iii)| If the Title Defect represents an obligation, encumbrance,
burden or charge upon the affected Asset (including any increase in Working
Interest for which there is not a proportionate increase in Net Revenue
Interest) for which the economic detriment to Buyer is unliquidated, the
amount of the Title Defect Value shall be determined by taking into
account the Allocated Value of the affected Asset, the portion of the Asset
affected by the Title Defect, the legal effect of the Title Defect, the
potential discounted economic effect of the Title Defect over the life of the
affected Asset. 
---|---|--- 
  



   | (iv)| If a Title Defect is not in effect or does not adversely affect
an Asset throughout the entire productive life of such Asset, such fact shall
be taken into account in determining the Title Defect Value. 
---|---|--- 
  



   | (v)| The Title Defect Value shall be determined without duplication of
any costs or losses included in another Title Defect Value hereunder. 
---|---|--- 
  



   | (vi)| Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, in no event
shall a Title Defect Value exceed the Allocated Value of the Wells, units or
other Assets affected thereby. 
---|---|--- 
  



    

(8) 
--- 

 


--- 

    



   | (vii)| Such other factors as are reasonably necessary to make a proper
evaluation. 
---|---|--- 
  



  

Section 3.05 _Remedies for Title Defects_.

  



   | (a)| With respect to each Title Defect that Seller does not cure on or
before the Closing, except as otherwise provided in this _Section 3.05_ , the
Purchase Price shall be reduced by an amount equal to the Title Defect
Value agreed upon in writing by Buyer and Seller or, if Buyer agrees, Seller
shall indemnify Buyer pursuant to _Section 14.04_ against all costs which
Buyer may incur in connection with such Title Defect. If any Title Defect is
in the nature of an unobtained consent to assignment or other restriction on
assignability, the provisions of _Section 3.08_ shall apply. 
---|---|--- 
  



   | (b)| Except for those affected Assets which Seller elects to exclude
from this transaction pursuant to _Section 3.04(b)(ii)_ , if on or before
Closing the Parties have not agreed upon the validity of any asserted Title
Defect or have not agreed on the Title Defect Value attributable thereto,
either Party shall have the right to elect to have the validity of such Title
Defect and/or such Title Defect Value determined by an Independent Expert
pursuant to _Section 16.03_ ; _provided_  that if the validity of any
asserted Title Defect, or the Title Defect Value attributable thereto, is not
determined before Closing, the affected Asset shall be excluded from the sale
and the Purchase Price shall be reduced by the Allocated Value of such
affected Asset as set forth on _Exhibit C_. In no event shall Buyer be
required to purchase any such excluded Asset after Closing. 
---|---|--- 
  



   | (c)| Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement, (i)
if the value of a given individual Title Defect (or individual Title Benefit
(as defined in _Section 3.09(a)_ ) does not exceed $50,000 then no adjustment
to the Purchase Price shall be made for such Title Defect (or Title Benefit),
(ii) if the aggregate adjustment to the Purchase Price determined in
accordance with this Agreement for Title Defects and Environmental Defects (as
hereinafter defined) does not exceed three percent (3%) of the Purchase Price
prior to any adjustments thereto, then no adjustment of the Purchase Price
shall be made therefor and (iii) if the aggregate adjustment to the Purchase
Price determined in accordance with this Agreement for Title Defects and
Environmental Defects does exceed three percent (3%) of the Purchase Price
prior to any adjustments thereto, then the Purchase Price shall only be
adjusted by the amount of such excess. 
---|---|--- 
  



  

Section 3.06 _Intentionally Omitted_.

  



  

Section 3.07 _Preferential Rights To Purchase_. _Schedule 3.07_ lists all

Section 3.08 _Consents to Assignment_. Seller shall use all reasonable
efforts to obtain all necessary consents set forth on _Schedule 5.11_ _ _
from Third Parties to assign the Assets prior to the Closing (other than
governmental approvals that are customarily obtained after the Closing) and
Buyer shall use reasonable efforts to assist Seller with such efforts. If
prior to the Closing, Seller fails to obtain a consent to assign that would
invalidate the conveyance of the Asset affected by the consent to assign to
Buyer or materially affect the value or use of the Asset, then Seller shall
retain the affected Asset and the Purchase Price shall be reduced by the
Allocated Value of the affected Asset. In no event shall Buyer be required by
this provision to pay for any such excluded Asset after Closing. For purposes
of the foregoing, consent requirements that do not expressly (i) render
transfer of the applicable Assets to Buyer void or voidable if such consent
is not obtained, (ii) result in lease termination, or (iii) result in
liquidated damages or otherwise materially affect the value or the use of the
Asset, shall not be objectionable by Buyer and any such Assets shall be
conveyed and paid for at Closing without regard to whether or not consents
thereto are obtained. Buyer shall reasonably cooperate with Seller in
obtaining any required consent including providing assurances of reasonable
financial conditions, but Buyer shall not be required to expend funds or make
any other type of financial commitments as a condition of obtaining such
consent. Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, certain leases on
_Schedule 5.11_ are notated as requiring consent prior to Closing or else the
Purchase Price shall be reduced, and if any such notated consent is not
obtained prior to Closing, then the Purchase Price shall be reduced by the
Allocated Value attributable to the applicable lease and such lease shall not
ever be assigned to Buyer.

  



  

Section 3.09 _Remedies for Title Benefits_.

  



   | (a)| If either Party discovers any Title Benefit during the
Examination Period affecting the Assets, it shall promptly notify the other
Party in writing thereof on or before the expiration of the Examination
Period. Subject to _Section 3.05_ , Seller shall be entitled to an upward
adjustment to the Purchase Price pursuant to _Section 10.02(a)(iv)_ with
respect to all Title Benefits in excess of $50,000 in an amount mutually
agreed upon by the Parties; _provided_ , that notwithstanding anything in
this Agreement to the contrary (i) if the aggregate adjustment to the Purchase
Price for Title Benefits determined in accordance with this Agreement does
not exceed three percent (3%) of the Purchase Price prior to any adjustments
thereto, then no adjustment of the Purchase Price shall be made therefor and
(ii) if the aggregate adjustment to the Purchase Price for Title Benefits
determined in accordance with this Agreement does exceed three percent (3%) of
the Purchase Price prior to any adjustments thereto, then the Purchase Price
shall only be adjusted by the amount of such excess. For purposes of this
Agreement, the term " _Title Benefit_ " shall mean Seller's interest in any
Subject Interest that is greater than or in addition to that set forth in
_Exhibit B_ (including, without limitation, a Net Revenue Interest that is
greater than that set forth in _Exhibit B_) or Seller's Working Interest in
any Subject Interest that is less than the Working Interest set forth in
_Exhibit B_ (without a corresponding decrease in the Net Revenue Interest).
Any matters that may otherwise constitute Title Benefits, but of which Buyer
has not been specifically notified by Seller in accordance with the foregoing,
shall be deemed to have been waived by Seller for all purposes. 
---|---|--- 
  



    

(10) 
--- 

 


--- 

    



   | (b)| If, with respect to a Title Benefit, the Parties are not deemed
to have agreed on the amount of the upward Purchase Price Adjustment or have
not otherwise agreed on such amount prior to the Closing Date, Seller or Buyer
shall have the right to elect to have such Purchase Price Adjustment
determined by an Independent Expert pursuant to _Section 16.03_. If the
amount of such adjustment is not determined pursuant to this Agreement by the
Closing, the undisputed portion of the Purchase Price with respect to the
Asset affected by such Title Benefit shall be paid by Buyer at the Closing
and, subject to _Section 3.05_ , upon determination of the amount of such
adjustment, any unpaid portion thereof shall be paid by Buyer to Seller. 
---|---|---

similar to the Exhibits and Schedules to this Agreement and the proposed
purchase price of such acquisition, calculated based on the Allocated Value
for such Tag Along Assets as described on Schedule 3.10 and in

shall provide that each of said parties shall provide Seller with written
notice, on or before December 23, 2013 at 5:00 p.m. Central Standard Time, of
its election to sell its interest in the Tag Along Assets or a waiver of its
right to sell its interest in the Tag Along Assets. Seller shall promptly

and all those who indicated a desire to participate.

estimated costs and expenses to correct such Environmental Defect in the most
cost-effective manner reasonably available, consistent with Environmental
Laws, taking into account that non-permanent remedies (such as mechanisms to
contain or stabilize hazardous materials, including monitoring site
conditions, natural attenuation, risk-based corrective action, institutional

Section 4.03 _Notice of Environmental Defects_.

  



   | (a)| If Buyer discovers any Environmental Defect affecting the Assets,
Buyer shall notify Seller prior to the expiration of the Examination Period
of such alleged Environmental Defect. To be effective, such notice must: (i)
be in writing; (ii) be received by Seller prior to the expiration of the
Examination Period and (iii) describe the Environmental Defect in reasonable
detail, to the extent reasonably known by Buyer (including the estimated value
of such Environmental Defect as determined by Buyer). 
---|---|--- 
  



   | (b)| Except for the matters described in _Section 14.01(f)_ and
_Section 14.04(a)_ as it relates solely to _Section 5.13_ , any matters that
may otherwise constitute Environmental Defects, but of which Seller has not
been notified by Buyer in accordance with the foregoing, together with any
environmental matter that does not constitute an Environmental Defect, shall
be deemed to have been waived by Buyer for all purposes and constitute an
Assumed Obligation (as defined in _Section 14.02_ ). Upon the receipt of such
effective notice from Buyer, Seller, at Seller's option, shall (i) cure such
Environmental Defect at any time prior to the Closing or (ii) exclude the
affected Asset from the sale and reduce the Purchase Price by the
Allocated Value of such affected Asset as set forth on _Exhibit C_, or (iii)
may, with Buyer's agreement, take any remedial action with respect to the
alleged Environmental Defect and indemnify Buyer pursuant to _Section 14.04_
against all costs which Buyer may incur in connection with same.

Section 4.04 _Remedies for Environmental Defects_.

  



   | (a)| If any Environmental Defect described in a notice delivered in
accordance with _Section 4.03_  is not cured on or before the Closing, and
Seller has not elected to exclude the affected Assets from this sale or Buyer
and Seller have not agreed for Seller to indemnify Buyer for the
Environmental Defect, then the Purchase Price shall be reduced by the
Environmental Defect Value of such Environmental Defect as agreed by the
Parties. 
---|---|--- 
  



   | (b)| If Buyer and Seller have not agreed as to the validity of any
asserted Environmental Defect, or if the Parties have not agreed on the
Environmental Defect Value therefor, and if Seller shall not have elected to
exclude the affected Assets from this sale pursuant to _Section 4.03(b)(ii)_
, then either Party shall have the right to elect to have the validity of the
asserted Environmental Defect, and/or the Environmental Defect Value for such
Environmental Defect, determined by an Independent Expert pursuant to
_Section 16.03_. If the validity of any such asserted Environmental Defect or
the amount of any such Environmental Defect Value is not determined by the
Closing, the Asset affected by such disputed Environmental Defect shall be
excluded from the Closing and the Purchase Price paid at the Closing shall be
reduced by the Allocated Value of that Asset. Notwithstanding the foregoing,
either Buyer or Seller shall have the right to exclude an Asset from the sale
if the Environmental Defect Value exceeds the Allocated Value of the Asset(s)
affected thereby. In no event shall Buyer be required to purchase any such
excluded Asset after Closing. 
---|---|--- 
  



    

(15) 
--- 

 


--- 

    



   | (c)| Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement, (i)
if the Environmental Defect Value for a given individual Environmental Defect
does not exceed $50,000, then no adjustment to the Purchase Price shall be
made for such Environmental Defect; (ii) if the aggregate adjustment to the
Purchase Price determined in accordance with this Agreement for Title Defects
and Environmental Defects does not exceed three percent (3%) of the Purchase
Price prior to any adjustments thereto, then no adjustment of the Purchase
Price shall be made therefore and (iii) if the aggregate adjustment to the
Purchase Price determined in accordance with this Agreement for Title Defects
and Environmental Defects does exceed three percent (3%) of the Purchase
Price prior to any adjustments thereto, then the Purchase Price shall only be
adjusted by the amount of such excess.

Article IX 
 Tax Matters

  



  

Section 9.01 _Transfer Taxes_. Buyer and Seller expect that this
transaction will not be subject to any sales, use, transfer or similar Taxes
(" _Transfer Taxes_ ") because the transaction is a transfer of realty and
the transfer of tangible personal property, if any, is incidental to the
transfer of realty. Accordingly, no Transfer Taxes will be collected at
Closing from Buyer in connection with this transaction. Seller and Buyer
agree to cooperate with each other in attempting to demonstrate that the
requirements for any exemption from such Taxes have been met. To the extent
any Transfer Taxes or recording fees are nevertheless incurred by or
imposed with respect to the transfer of the Assets to Buyer pursuant to this
Agreement, such Transfer Taxes or recording fees shall be solely the
responsibility of Buyer. Buyer and Seller shall reasonably cooperate in good
faith to minimize, to the extent permissible under applicable law, the amount
of any such Transfer Taxes and recording fees. For the avoidance of doubt,
Seller shall retain all liability for and shall pay all income Tax, franchise
Tax and similar Taxes imposed on any income or gain realized by
Seller pursuant to the transactions contemplated in this Agreement.

  



  

Section 9.02 _Asset Taxes_. Seller shall retain responsibility for and
bear all Asset Taxes for (A) any period ending prior to the Effective
Time and (B) the portion of any Straddle Period that ends immediately prior
to the Effective Time. All Asset Taxes with respect to the ownership or
operation of the Assets arising on or after the Effective Time shall be
allocated to and borne by Buyer. For purposes of allocation between Seller
and Buyer of Asset Taxes that are payable with respect to Straddle Periods,
the portion of any such Taxes that are attributable to the portion of the
Straddle Period that ends immediately prior to the Effective Time shall (i)
in the case of Asset Taxes that are based upon or related to income or
receipts or imposed on a transactional basis such as severance or production
Taxes, be deemed equal to the amount that would be payable if the tax year or
period ended immediately prior to the Effective Time; and (ii) in the case of
other Asset Taxes, be deemed equal to the product of (1) the amount of such
Asset Taxes multiplied by (2) the quotient of the number of days in the
portion of such Straddle Period ending on the day immediately prior to the
day on which the Effective Time occurs, divided by the total number of days in
such Straddle Period. To the extent the actual amount of Asset Taxes is not
determinable at Closing or at the time the Final Statement is prepared, as
applicable, Buyer and Seller shall utilize the most recent information
available in estimating the amount of Asset Taxes for purposes of
_Sections 10.02(a)(ii)_ , _10.02(b)(iii)_ , and _12.02_. If, at the time the
actual amount of an Asset Tax is determined, the amount of such Asset Tax
paid by Seller, plus, if applicable, the amount of any adjustment to the
Purchase Price with respect to such Asset Tax made pursuant to _Section
10.02(b)(iii)_ and _Section 12.02_ _minus_ , if applicable, the amount of any
adjustment to the Purchase Price with respect to such Asset Tax made pursuant
to _Section 10.02(a)(ii)_ and _Section 12.02_ is (x) less than Seller's share
of the actual amount of such Asset Tax determined pursuant to the foregoing
provisions of this _Section 9.02_ , then Seller shall promptly pay Buyer an
amount equal to such difference or (y) more than Seller's share of the actual
amount of such Asset Tax, determined pursuant to the foregoing provisions of
this _Section 9.02_ , then Buyer shall promptly pay Seller an amount equal to
such difference.

  



    

(23) 
--- 

 


--- 

    



  

Section 9.03 _Purchase Price Allocation_. Seller and Buyer shall
cooperate in the preparation of Internal Revenue Service Form 8594 pursuant to
Section 1060 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended and the
Treasury Regulations promulgated thereunder, to report the allocation of the
Purchase Price, the Assumed Obligations and any other items constituting
consideration for applicable income Tax purposes (to the extent known at such
time) among the Assets and in a manner that is, to the maximum extent
possible, consistent with the allocation set forth in _Exhibit C_ (the "
_Purchase Price Allocation_ "). Buyer and Seller agree to amend the Purchase
Price Allocation to reflect adjustments to the Purchase Price and to report
the transactions contemplated by this Agreement consistently with the
Purchase Price Allocation, as adjusted by the Parties, on any Tax Return, and
will not assert, and will cause their affiliates not to assert, in connection
with any Tax audit or other proceeding with respect to Taxes, any asset
values or other items inconsistent with the amounts set forth in the Purchase
Price Allocation except with the agreement of the other Parties or as
required by applicable law.

  



  

Section 9.04 _Tax Cooperation_. The Parties shall cooperate fully, as and
to the extent reasonably requested by the other Party, in connection with the
filing of Tax Returns and any audit, litigation, or other proceeding with
respect to Taxes relating to the Assets. Such cooperation shall include the
retention and (upon another Party's request) the provision of records and
information that are relevant to any such Tax Return or audit, litigation or
other proceeding and making employees available on a mutually
convenient basis to provide additional information and explanation of any
material provided under this Agreement. Seller and the Buyer agree to retain
all books and records with respect to tax matters pertinent to the Assets
relating to any tax period beginning before the Effective Time until the
expiration of the statute of limitations of the respective tax periods and to
abide by all record retention agreements entered into with any taxing

in _Article VII_ , or of Seller set forth in _Article VIII_ , (such Party

case (i) if Buyer is the Breaching Party, Seller shall retain the Deposit as
liquidated damages on account of Buyer's failure to perform its obligations
under this Agreement or Buyer's breach of any representation under this

   | (a)| Seller  acknowledges that full carve out audited financial
statements are not available for the  subject properties and that full carve
out financial statements are impracticable for  Seller to prepare. Seller
will deliver a letter to Buyer at closing stating that full  carve out
audited financial statements are not available and are impracticable  for

operating expenses and supplemental reserve disclosures  including proved
reserve tables and the standardized measure of discounted cash flows  as
required by the Securities Exchange Commission (" _SEC_ ") by  Buyer pursuant
to the Securities Act of 1933, as amended (the " _Securities  Act_ "), or the

that such statements  of revenues and direct operating expenses will  be

(Interim Financial Information)), as may be reasonably requested  by Seller's
Auditor, with respect to the statement of revenues and direct operating 
expenses. Also by February 21, 2014, Seller will have prepared and delivered,
at Buyer's  expense, a separate unaudited statement of revenues and direct
operating expenses applicable  to the Assets for the partial interim

Act,  report or other filing under the Exchange Act and the rules set forth
in Regulation S-X  (the " _Financial Statements_ "). In addition, by January
31, 2014, Seller  shall provide Buyer with lease operating statements for the
fourth quarter of 2013. Seller  shall cooperate with, assist, and provide

   | (b)| Seller  agrees to consent to the inclusion or incorporation by
reference of the statements of  revenues and direct operating expenses and

notice from Buyer's counsel that the statements of revenues  and direct
operating expenses and all supplemental information therein are required to 
be included or incorporated by reference to satisfy  any rule or regulation
of the SEC or to satisfy relevant financial disclosure obligations  under the
Securities Act or the Exchange Act. Upon request of Buyer, Seller agrees to 
request the external audit firm that audits the statements of revenues and
direct operating  expenses (the " _Audit Firm_ ") to consent to the inclusion
or incorporation  by reference of its audit opinion with respect to the
audited statements of revenues  and direct operating expenses in any such
registration statement, report or other document  and provide to the Audit
Firm such customary representation letters as may be reasonably  requested by
the Audit Firm. Seller shall (i) provide Buyer and Buyer's independent 
accountants with access to management by  Seller to Seller's independent
accountants to the extent applicable to the Assets  and (ii) authorize
Seller's Audit Firm to provide such Audit Firm's consent  to the
incorporation of the audited statements of revenues and direct operating
expenses  by reference to satisfy any rule or regulation of the SEC or to
