coverage mandated by applicable Law, (ii) death benefits under any "pension
plan," or (iii) benefits the full cost of which is borne by the current or
former employee (or his or her beneficiary). No condition exists that would

Section 5.7 _Post-Closing Directors and Officers of the Surviving
Corporation_. Subject to the terms of the Stockholders' Agreement and the

action within its power as may be necessary or appropriate such that
immediately following the Closing:

  



  

(a) the Board of Directors of the Surviving Corporation shall consist of
seven (7) directors, which shall all be designated by the Grosvenor Holders,
three of which must qualify in the determination of the Board of Directors of
Acquiror as an "independent director" under stock exchange regulations
applicable to Acquiror (the " _Grosvenor Designated Directors_ ");

  



  

(b) the Chairperson of the Board of Directors of the Surviving Corporation
shall initially be Michael J. Sacks, who shall serve in such capacity in
accordance with the terms of the Stockholders' Agreement and the Surviving
Corporation Governing Documents following the Closing; and

  



  

(c) the initial officers of the Surviving Corporation shall be as set forth
on _Section 5.7(c)_ of the Grosvenor Companies Disclosure Letter, who shall
serve in such capacity in accordance with the terms of the Surviving
Corporation Governing Documents following the Closing.

  



  

Section 5.8 _Indemnification and Insurance_.

  



  

(a) From and after the Closing, the Surviving Corporation agrees that it
shall indemnify and hold harmless each present and former director and
officer of the (x) Grosvenor Companies and each of their respective
Subsidiaries (in each case, solely to the extent acting in their capacity as
such and to the extent such activities are related to the business of the
Grosvenor Companies being acquired under this Agreement) (the " _Company
Indemnified Parties_ ") and (y) Acquiror and each of its Subsidiaries (the "
_Acquiror Indemnified Parties_ " together with the Company Indemnified
Parties, the " _D andO Indemnified Parties_") against any costs or expenses
(including reasonable attorneys' fees), judgments, fines, losses,
claims, damages or liabilities incurred in connection with any Legal
Proceeding, whether civil, criminal, administrative or investigative, arising
out of or pertaining to matters existing or occurring at or prior to the
Closing, whether asserted or claimed prior to, at or after the Closing, to
the fullest extent that the Grosvenor Companies, Acquiror or their respective
Subsidiaries, as the case may be, would have been permitted under applicable
Law and its respective certificate of incorporation, certificate of
formation, bylaws, limited liability company agreement, limited liability
partnership agreement, limited liability limited partnership agreement or
other Governing Documents in effect on the date of this Agreement to indemnify
such DandO Indemnified Parties (including the advancing of expenses as incurred
to the fullest extent permitted under applicable Law). Without limiting the
foregoing, Acquiror and the Grosvenor Companies shall, and shall cause their
Subsidiaries to (i) maintain for a period of not less than six years from the
Closing provisions in its certificate of incorporation, certificate of
formation, bylaws, limited liability company agreement, limited liability
partnership agreement, limited liability limited partnership agreement and
other Governing Documents concerning the indemnification and exoneration
(including provisions relating to expense advancement) of the Acquiror's, its
Subsidiaries', the Grosvenor Companies' and their Subsidiaries' former and
current officers, directors, employees, and agents that are no less favorable
to those Persons than the provisions of the certificate of incorporation,
certificate of formation, bylaws, limited liability company agreement,
operating agreement, limited liability partnership agreement, limited
liability limited partnership agreement and other Governing Documents of the
Grosvenor Companies, Acquiror or their respective Subsidiaries, as applicable,
in each case, as of the date of this Agreement and (ii) not amend, repeal or
otherwise modify such provisions in any respect that would adversely affect
the rights of those Persons thereunder, in each case, except as required by

Companies and their Subsidiaries to honor, each of the covenants in this
_Section 5.8_.

  



  

   

68

 



    



  

(b) For a period of six years from the Closing, the Surviving Corporation
shall cause the Grosvenor Companies to maintain in effect directors' and
officers' liability insurance covering those Persons who are currently covered
by Acquiror, the Grosvenor Companies' or their Subsidiaries' directors' and
officers' liability insurance policies (true, correct and complete copies of
which have been made available to Acquiror prior to the date of this Agreement
or their agents or representatives, respectively) on terms not less favorable
than the terms of such current insurance coverage, except that in no event
shall the Surviving Corporation be required to pay an annual premium for such
insurance in excess of 300% of the aggregate annual premium payable by
Acquiror or the Grosvenor Companies, as applicable, for such insurance policy
for the year ended December 31, 2019; _provided_ , _however_ , that (i)
Acquiror, the Surviving Corporation or the Grosvenor Companies may cause
coverage to be extended under the current directors' and officers' liability
insurance by obtaining a six-year "tail" policy with respect to claims
existing or occurring at or prior to the Closing and if and to the extent
such policies have been obtained prior to the Closing with respect to any
such Persons, the Grosvenor Companies and the Surviving Corporation shall
maintain (and cause their Subsidiaries to maintain, and the Grosvenor
Companies shall pay any costs of Acquiror and IntermediateCo to maintain) such
policies in effect and continue to honor the obligations thereunder, and (ii)
if any claim is asserted or made within such six-year period, any insurance
required to be maintained under this _Section 5.8_ shall be continued in
respect of such claim until the final disposition thereof.

  



  

(c) Notwithstanding anything contained in this Agreement to the contrary,
this _Section 5.8_ shall survive the Closing indefinitely and shall be
binding, jointly and severally, on Acquiror and the Grosvenor Companies and
all successors and assigns of Acquiror and the Grosvenor Companies. In the
event that Acquiror or any of the Grosvenor Companies or any of their
respective successors or assigns consolidates with or merges into any other
Person and shall not be the continuing or surviving corporation or entity of
such consolidation or merger or transfers or conveys all or substantially all
of its properties and assets to any Person, then, and in each such
case, Acquiror and the Grosvenor Companies shall ensure that proper provision
shall be made so that the successors and assigns of Acquiror or any of the
Grosvenor Companies, as the case may be, shall succeed to the obligations set
forth in this _Section 5.8_.

to the Closing, a DandO Indemnified Party, his or her heirs and his or her
personal representatives, (ii) shall be binding on Acquiror, GCM PubCo and the
Grosvenor Companies and their successors and assigns, (iii) are in addition
to, and not in substitution for, any other rights to indemnification or
contribution that any such Person may have, whether pursuant to Law, Contract,
Governing Documents, or otherwise and (iv) shall survive the consummation of
the Closing and shall not be terminated or modified in such a manner as to
adversely affect any DandO Indemnified Party without the consent of such DandO
Indemnified Party.

  



  

(e) On the Closing Date, the Surviving Corporation shall enter into customary
indemnification agreements reasonably satisfactory to Grosvenor Holdings with
the post-Closing directors and officers of the Surviving Corporation, which
indemnification agreements shall continue to be effective following the
Closing.

  



  

Section 5.9 _Audit Committee Charter_. On the Closing Date, the Surviving

Acquiror Share Redemption Amount and (ii) including the GCM PubCo Equity
Investments is reasonably expected to be less than Three Hundred Million

determined before and without regard to the payment of Acquiror Transaction
Expenses or Grosvenor Transaction Expenses) as of the Closing (such
amount, as calculated in accordance with the foregoing, the " _Minimum
Available Acquiror Cash Amount_ "), then the Grosvenor Holders and their
Affiliates shall be entitled to arrange for the purchase by third Persons of,
additional shares of Acquiror Common Stock at a price per share of $10.00 in
an aggregate amount such that the Available Acquiror Cash is, at or
immediately prior to the Closing, equal to at least the Minimum Available

Acquiror (a) shall cause any documents, opinions and notices required to be
delivered to the Trustee pursuant to the Trust Agreement to be so delivered

(d) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this Agreement, the
Acquiror's Board of Directors may, at any time prior to, but not after,
obtaining the Acquiror Stockholder Approval, make a Modification in
Recommendation in response to an Intervening Event (an " _Intervening Event
Change in Recommendation_ ") if the failure to take such action would be a
breach of the fiduciary duties of the Board of Directors of Acquiror to the
Acquiror Stockholders under applicable Law, provided, that: (A) the
Grosvenor Holders shall have received written notice from Acquiror of
Acquiror's intention to make an Intervening Event Change in Recommendation at
least five (5) Business Days prior to the taking of such action by Acquiror
(the " _Intervening Event Notice Period_ "), which notice shall specify the
applicable Intervening Event in reasonable detail, (B) during the Intervening
Event Notice Period and prior to making an Intervening Event Change in
Recommendation, if requested by the Grosvenor Holders, Acquiror and its
representatives shall have negotiated in good faith with the Grosvenor
Holders and their representatives regarding any revisions or
adjustments proposed by the Grosvenor Holders to the terms and conditions of
this Agreement as would enable Acquiror to proceed with its recommendation of
this Agreement and the Transactions and not make such Intervening Event Change
in Recommendation and (C) if the Grosvenor Holders requested negotiations in
accordance with clause (B), Acquiror may make an Intervening Event Change in
Recommendation only if the Board of Directors of Acquiror, after considering
in good faith any revisions or adjustments to the terms and conditions of
this Agreement that the Grosvenor Holders shall have, prior to the expiration
of the 5-Business Day period, offered in writing in a manner that would form
a binding contract if accepted by Acquiror (and the other applicable parties
hereto), continues to determine in good faith that failure to make an
Intervening Event Change in Recommendation would be a breach of its fiduciary
duties to the Acquiror Stockholders under applicable Law. An " _Intervening
Event_ " shall mean any Event that (i) was not known to its Board of
Directors as of the date of this Agreement and (ii) does not relate to (A) any
Business Combination Proposal or (B) clearance of the Transaction under the
Regulatory Approvals or any other applicable Laws, including any action in
connection therewith taken pursuant to or required to be taken pursuant to
_Section 7.1_ ; provided, however, that (1) any change in the price or
trading volume of Acquiror Common Stock shall not be taken into account for
purposes of determining whether an Intervening Event has occurred; and (2)
the Grosvenor Companies meeting, failing to meet or exceeding projections (in
and of itself, but without preventing a determination of an Intervening Event
as to the Events underlying such change) shall not be taken into account
for purposes of determining whether an Intervening Event has occurred.
Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this Agreement, during
an Intervening Event Notice Period, the obligations on Acquiror and/or
Acquiror's Board of Directors to make filings with the SEC with respect to
the proposals contemplated herein, to give notice for or to convene a meeting,
or make a recommendation, shall be tolled during such period, and in the
event a filing and or notice for a meeting was made prior to the Intervening
Event Notice Period, Acquiror shall be permitted to adjourn such meeting and
amend such filing as necessary in order to provide sufficient time for the
stockholders to consider any revised recommendation.

  



  

(e) Acquiror agrees that it shall provide the holders of Acquiror Common
Stock the opportunity to elect redemption of such shares of Acquiror Common
Stock in connection with the Acquiror Stockholders' Meeting and, if

Governing Documents.

Section 7.3 _Support of Transaction_

  



  

(a). Without limiting any covenant contained in _Article VI_ or _Article VII_
, Acquiror and IntermediateCo shall each, and shall each cause their
respective Subsidiaries to (a) use reasonable efforts to obtain all material
consents and approvals of third parties that any of Acquiror or its
Affiliates are required to obtain in order to consummate the Transactions and
(b) take such other action as may be reasonably necessary or as another party
hereto may reasonably request to satisfy the conditions of _Article VIII_
(including the use of reasonable efforts to enforce Acquiror's rights under
the PIPE Subscription Agreements) or otherwise to comply with this Agreement
and to consummate the Transactions as soon as practicable.

  



  

Section 7.4 _Tax Matters_.

  



  

(a) _Preparation of Tax Returns_.

  



  

(i) With respect to any Flow-Thru Tax Return of the Grosvenor Companies or
their Subsidiaries with respect to a Pre-Closing Tax Period, such Flow-Thru
Tax Return shall be prepared in a manner consistent with the past practices of
the Grosvenor Companies and their Subsidiaries, except as required by
applicable Law or set forth herein. At least twenty (20) days prior to the
filing of any such Tax Return, a draft copy of such Tax Return shall be
delivered to Grosvenor Holdings for its review and approval.

  



  

(ii) Grosvenor Capital shall take all actions necessary to ensure that
Grosvenor Capital (and, to the extent provided for in the Tax
Receivable Agreement, any of its Subsidiaries that is treated as a
partnership or disregarded entity for applicable Tax purposes) will have made
a valid election pursuant to Section 754 of the Code (and elections available
under similar provisions of state or local Law) that is effective for the
taxable period that includes the Closing Date. Determinations with respect to
the allocation of taxable items of Grosvenor Capital and its Subsidiaries
that are to be made as a result of the transfer of interests in Grosvenor
Capital made in connection with the Transactions shall be made under Section
706 of the Code under any proper method selected by Grosvenor Holdings. To
the fullest extent permitted by applicable Law, all deductions triggered in
connection with the Transactions shall be reported on income Tax Returns of
the Grosvenor Companies and their Subsidiaries as attributable to Pre-Closing
Tax Periods.

  



  

(iii) With respect to any such matter that could reasonably be expected to
result in any Tax liability for which any Grosvenor Holder could be
responsible, without the prior written consent of Grosvenor Holdings, Acquiror
shall not, and shall not permit any of its Affiliates to file, re-file, or
amend any Tax Return of the Grosvenor Companies or their Subsidiaries with
respect to any Pre-Closing Tax Period, or make any election that would have
retroactive effect with respect to a Pre-Closing Tax Period.

  



  

(iv) With respect to the Transactions, for U.S. federal income Tax purposes,
the parties intend that (i) except to the extent required to be treated as
imputed interest under applicable Law, payments made under the Tax Receivable
Agreement that are attributable to the Purchase (as such term is defined in
the Tax Receivable Agreement) be treated as additional consideration in
respect of the Option Conveyance and the interests in Grosvenor Capital
acquired directly or indirectly from Grosvenor Holdings in the
Grosvenor Class B-1 Sale (if any) and the GCM Transfers; (ii) the
recapitalization of the equity interests of Grosvenor Capital in
connection with Grosvenor Redomicile and LLLPA Amendment will be treated as a
non-taxable recapitalization of the equity of Grosvenor Capital; and (iii)
the Merger will be treated as a reorganization within the meaning of Section
368(a) of the Code. The parties hereby adopt this Agreement as a "plan of
reorganization" within the meaning of Treasury Regulation Section 1.368-2(g)
and agree to (and shall cause their Affiliates to) file all Tax Returns
consistent with the foregoing to the fullest extent permitted by applicable
Law. Grosvenor Capital agrees to use reasonable efforts to cooperate with
Acquiror to provide information reasonably and timely requested in order for
counsel to Acquiror to provide an opinion regarding the qualification of the
Merger as a reorganization within the meaning of Section 368(a) of the Code.

  



  

   

82

 



    



  

(b) _Tax Contest Matters_. With respect to any Tax audit, examination,
proceeding, claimed deficiency or other similar matter relating to the
Grosvenor Companies or their Subsidiaries that pertains to Flow-Thru Tax
Returns with respect to Pre-Closing Tax Periods (a " _Tax Matter_ "), if
directed by Grosvenor Holdings, (i) the relevant Grosvenor Company or other
entity shall (to the extent permissible under applicable Law) make or not
make the election provided for under Section 1101(g)(4) of the
Bipartisan Budget Act of 2015 (or any similar election available under U.S.
state or local Law); (ii) with respect to any Tax liability arising out of a
Tax Matter, the Grosvenor Companies and their Subsidiaries shall not make the
election provided for in Section 6226(a) of the Code with respect to such
liability, and shall instead pay any "imputed underpayment" (or similar
liability imposed under other provisions of applicable Tax law) at the
Grosvenor Company or other relevant entity-level. Notwithstanding anything
else contained herein or in the Governing Documents of Grosvenor Capital,
without the prior written consent of Grosvenor Holdings (which may be
withheld in Grosvenor Holdings' sole discretion), in no event will the
Grosvenor Holders be required to amend any Tax Return in connection with the
procedures described in Section 6225(c) of the Code, undertake any other
alternative to payment by the Grosvenor Companies or their Subsidiaries of
any imputed underpayment as provided for in the immediately
preceding sentence, or undertake any indemnification or reimbursement
obligation of any Grosvenor Company in connection with liabilities described
in this Section 7.4(b). The Grosvenor Holders will use reasonable efforts to
cooperate to reduce any amounts that the Grosvenor Companies and their
Subsidiaries are required to pay in connection with any imputed underpayment

Article X _ 
 MISCELLANEOUS_

  



  

Section 10.1 _Trust Account Waiver_. Each of the Grosvenor Companies and the
Grosvenor Holders acknowledges that Acquiror is a blank check company with
the powers and privileges to effect a Business Combination. Each of the
Grosvenor Companies and the Grosvenor Holders further acknowledges that, as
described in the prospectus dated December 11, 2018 (the " _Prospectus_ ")
available at www.sec.gov, substantially all of Acquiror assets consist of the
cash proceeds of Acquiror's initial public offering and private placements of
its securities and substantially all of those proceeds have been deposited in
a the trust account for the benefit of Acquiror, certain of its public
stockholders and the underwriters of Acquiror's initial public offering (the "
_Trust Account_ "). Each of the Grosvenor Companies and the Grosvenor Holders
acknowledges that it has been advised by Acquiror that, except with respect
to interest earned on the funds held in the Trust Account that may be released
to Acquiror to pay its franchise Tax, income Tax and similar obligations, the
Trust Agreement provides that cash in the Trust Account may be disbursed only
(i) if Acquiror completes the transaction which constitutes a Business
Combination, then to those Persons and in such amounts as described in the
Prospectus; (ii) if Acquiror fails to complete a Business Combination within
the allotted time period and liquidates, subject to the terms of the Trust
Agreement, to Acquiror in limited amounts to permit Acquiror to pay the costs
and expenses of its liquidation and dissolution, and then to Acquiror's
public stockholders; and (iii) if Acquiror holds a stockholder vote to amend
Acquiror's amended and restated memorandum and articles of association to
modify the substance or timing of the obligation to redeem 100% of Acquiror
Common Stock (prior to the Effective Time) if Acquiror fails to complete a
Business Combination within the allotted time period, then for the redemption
of any Acquiror Common Stock (prior to the Effective Time) properly tendered
in connection with such vote. For and in consideration of Acquiror entering
into this Agreement, the receipt and sufficiency of which are
hereby acknowledged, each of the Grosvenor Companies and the Grosvenor
Holders, on behalf of themselves and their respective Affiliates, hereby
agree that they do not now have or shall at any time hereafter have, and
irrevocably waive any right, title, interest or claim of any kind they or any
of their respective Affiliates have or may have in the future, in or to any
monies in the Trust Account or distributions therefrom and agree not to seek
recourse against the Trust Account or any funds distributed therefrom as a
result of, arising out of, this Agreement and any negotiations, Contracts or
agreements with Acquiror or any other matter, and regardless of whether such
claim arises based on contract, tort, equity or any other theory of legal
liability. Each of the Grosvenor Companies and the Grosvenor Holders agrees
and acknowledges that such irrevocable waiver is material to this
Agreement and specifically relied upon by Acquiror to induce the Acquiror to
enter in this Agreement, and each of the Grosvenor Companies and the
Grosvenor Holders further intends and understands such waiver to be valid,
binding and enforceable against such party and each of its Affiliates under
applicable Law. Notwithstanding the foregoing, (x) nothing herein shall serve
to limit or prohibit the Grosvenor Companies' and the Grosvenor Holders'
right to pursue a claim against Acquiror for legal relief against monies or
other assets held outside the Trust Account (other than distributions
therefrom directly or indirectly to the Acquiror's public stockholders), for
specific performance or other equitable relief in connection with the
consummation of the Transactions (including a claim for Acquiror to
specifically perform its obligations under this Agreement and cause the
disbursement of the balance of the cash remaining in the Trust Account (after
giving effect to the Acquiror Share Redemptions) to the Grosvenor Holders in
accordance with the terms of this Agreement and the Trust Agreement) so long
as such claim would not affect Acquiror's ability to fulfill its obligation
to effectuate the Acquiror Share Redemptions and (y) nothing herein shall
serve to limit or prohibit any claims that the Grosvenor Companies and the
Grosvenor Holders may have in the future against Acquiror's assets or funds
that are not held in the Trust Account (including any funds that have been
released from the Trust Account and any assets that have been purchased or
acquired with any such funds, but excluding distributions from the Trust
Account directly or indirectly to the Acquiror's public stockholders).

(a) Acquiror, the Grosvenor Companies and the Grosvenor Holders hereby agree
that, in the event a dispute with respect to this Agreement or
the Transactions arises after the Closing between or among Acquiror,
IntermediateCo and/or Sponsor, on the one hand, and the Grosvenor Companies
and/or the Grosvenor Holders, on the other hand, any legal counsel (including
Hughes Hubbard and Reed LLP and Ellenoff Grossman and Schole LLP) that
represented Acquiror and/or Sponsor prior to the Closing may represent Sponsor
in such dispute even though the interests of Sponsor may be directly adverse
to the Acquiror, and even though such counsel may have represented Acquiror
in a matter substantially related to such dispute, or may be handling ongoing
matters for Acquiror and/or Sponsor. Notwithstanding the foregoing, any
privileged communications or information shared by the Grosvenor Companies
prior to the Closing with Acquiror or Sponsor (in any capacity) under a
common interest agreement shall remain the privileged communications or
information of the Grosvenor Companies following the Closing.

  



  

(b) Acquiror and the Grosvenor Companies hereby agree that, in the event a
dispute with respect to this Agreement or the Transactions arises after the
Closing between or among the Grosvenor Designated Directors and/or the
Grosvenor Holders, on the one hand, and the Grosvenor Companies and/or
Acquiror, on the other hand, any legal counsel (including Latham and Watkins
LLP) that represented the Grosvenor Designated Directors and/or the Grosvenor
Holders prior to the Closing may represent the Grosvenor Designated Directors
and/or the Grosvenor Holders in such dispute even though the interests of the
Grosvenor Designated Directors and/or the Grosvenor Holders may be directly
adverse to the Acquiror and/or the Grosvenor Companies, and even though such
counsel may have represented Acquiror and/or the Grosvenor Companies in a
matter substantially related to such dispute, or may be handling ongoing
matters for Acquiror, the Grosvenor Companies, the Grosvenor Designated
Directors and/or the Grosvenor Holders. Acquiror and the Grosvenor
Companies further agree that, as to all legally privileged communications
prior to the Closing between or among any legal counsel (including Latham and
Watkins LLP) that represented the Grosvenor Companies, the Grosvenor
Designated Directors and/or the Grosvenor Holders prior to the Closing and
any one or more such Persons that relate in any way to the Transactions, the
attorney/client privilege and the expectation of client confidence belongs to
the Grosvenor Holders and/or the Grosvenor Designated Directors and may
be controlled by the Grosvenor Holders and/or such Grosvenor Designated
Directors, and shall not pass to or be claimed or controlled by Acquiror
(after giving effect to the Closing) or the Grosvenor Companies; _provided_
that the Grosvenor Holders and/or the Grosvenor Designated Directors shall
not waive such attorney/client privilege other than to the extent they
determine appropriate in connection with the enforcement or defense of their
respective rights or obligations existing under this Agreement.
Notwithstanding the foregoing, any privileged communications or information
shared by Acquiror prior to the Closing with the Grosvenor Holders or the
Grosvenor Designated Directors (in any capacity) under a common interest
agreement shall remain the privileged communications or information of the
Grosvenor Companies following the Closing.
