substantially all of Acquiror assets consist of the cash proceeds of Acquiror&rsquo;s initial public offering and private placements
of its securities and substantially all of those proceeds have been deposited in a the trust account for the benefit of Acquiror,
certain of its public stockholders and the underwriters of Acquiror&rsquo;s initial public offering (the &ldquo;<U>Trust Account</U>&rdquo;).
Each of the Grosvenor Companies and the Grosvenor Holders acknowledges that it has been advised by Acquiror that, except with
respect to interest earned on the funds held in the Trust Account that may be released to Acquiror to pay its franchise Tax, income
Tax and similar obligations, the Trust Agreement provides that cash in the Trust Account may be disbursed only (i) if Acquiror
completes the transaction which constitutes a Business Combination, then to those Persons and in such amounts as described in
the Prospectus; (ii) if Acquiror fails to complete a Business Combination within the allotted time period and liquidates, subject
to the terms of the Trust Agreement, to Acquiror in limited amounts to permit Acquiror to pay the costs and expenses of its liquidation
and dissolution, and then to Acquiror&rsquo;s public stockholders; and (iii) if Acquiror holds a stockholder vote to amend Acquiror&rsquo;s
amended and restated memorandum and articles of association to modify the substance or timing of the obligation to redeem 100%

with such vote. For and in consideration of Acquiror entering into this Agreement, the receipt and sufficiency of which are hereby
acknowledged, each of the Grosvenor Companies and the Grosvenor Holders, on behalf of themselves and their respective Affiliates,
hereby agree that they do not now have or shall at any time hereafter have, and irrevocably waive any right, title, interest or
claim of any kind they or any of their respective Affiliates have or may have in the future, in or to any monies in the Trust
Account or distributions therefrom and agree not to seek recourse against the Trust Account or any funds distributed therefrom
as a result of, arising out of, this Agreement and any negotiations, Contracts or agreements with Acquiror or any other matter,
and regardless of whether such claim arises based on contract, tort, equity or any other theory of legal liability. Each of the
Grosvenor Companies and the Grosvenor Holders agrees and acknowledges that such irrevocable waiver is material to this Agreement
and specifically relied upon by Acquiror to induce the Acquiror to enter in this Agreement, and each of the Grosvenor Companies
and the Grosvenor Holders further intends and understands such waiver to be valid, binding and enforceable against such party
and each of its Affiliates under applicable Law. Notwithstanding the foregoing, (x) nothing herein shall serve to limit or prohibit
