ARTICLE 2. PURCHASE OF OPERATING COMPANY AND STELLAR PROPANE



2.1 _Stellar Propane Merger_.



(a) Prior to the Closing, the Sellers will cause Star/Petro and Stellar
Propane to take all required corporate and shareholder action to cause Stellar
Propane to be merged with and into a newly-formed Delaware limited liability
company in accordance with the provisions of Section 18-209 of the Delaware
Limited Liability Company Act, with the resulting entity to have the name
"Stellar Propane Service, LLC". Prior to the Merger, the Sellers will provide
a copy of the certificate of formation and limited liability company
agreement that will become the



 

8 Organizational Documents of Stellar Propane after the Merger, which
certificate of formation and limited liability company agreement must be in
form and substance satisfactory to Buyer. The Sellers will cause the Merger to
be completed in accordance with the following terms, and will provide evidence
of the effectiveness of the Merger to Buyer:



(i) No action will be taken by the Sellers that will result in or require
Stellar Propane to wind up its affairs or pay its liabilities and distribute
its assets, it being intended that the limited liability company will continue
to operate in the ordinary course of business and consistent with
past practice;



(ii) The Sellers covenant that Stellar Propane will not elect to be treated
as a corporation for federal Tax purposes.



(b) The Sellers will prepare or cause to be prepared and file or cause to be
filed all Tax Returns for the Operating Company and Stellar Propane (including
any consolidated or combined Tax Returns in which Stellar Propanes income is
included) for all periods ending on or prior to the Closing Date that are to
be filed after the Closing Date. The Sellers will permit Buyer to review and
comment on each such Tax Return described in the preceding sentence prior to
filing. To the extent permitted by applicable Law, the Sellers will include
(and will cause Star/Petro to include) any income, gain, loss, deduction or
other Tax items for such periods on their respective Tax Returns and with the
Schedule K-1s prepared by the Sellers for such periods. The Sellers have paid
or will pay any and all Taxes attributable to the Operating Company and
Stellar Propane for taxable years or periods ending on or before the Closing
Date, including all Taxes attributable to the Merger. The Sellers and
Star/Petro have paid or will pay all Taxes applicable to, arising out of or in
connection with their allocable share of profits, income, gain or other
taxable receipts or payments from the Operating Company for any period or
portion thereof, through and including the Closing Date and the Merger. For
this purpose, the Taxes of the Sellers in the Operating Company and Stellar
Propane will be computed based on the taxable period of such entities ending
as of the close of business on the Closing Date after the Merger and the sale
of the Stellar Propane Interest, and, in each case, if such Taxes are income
Taxes, such income Taxes will be computed by determining the items of income,
expense, deduction loss or credit on a "closing of the books" basis as of the
end of the Closing Date.



2.2 _Sale of Stellar Propane to the Operating Company_. Prior to the Closing
(but after the Merger), the Sellers will cause Star/Petro to sell, transfer,
assign, grant, bargain, deliver and convey all of the Stellar Propane Interest
to the Operating Company pursuant to an assignment substantially in the form
of _Exhibit A_ in exchange for a promissory note payable by the
Operating Company to Star/Petro in the amount of $75,000,000, substantially
in the form of _Exhibit B_ (the " _Promissory Note_ "). Star/Petro will sell,
transfer, assign, grant, bargain, deliver and convey to the Operating Company
all right, title and interest in and to the Stellar Propane Interest, free
and clear of any and all Liens and without any condition or restriction on
transferability except for those conditions or restrictions contained in
Stellar Propanes certificate of formation and limited liability company
agreement.



2.3 _Star/Petro Distribution_. Prior to the Closing (but after the sale of the
Stellar Propane Interest contemplated by Section 2.2), the Sellers will cause
the Operating Company to transfer, distribute, convey and assign all of
the shares of stock in Star/Petro to the Partnership and the General Partner
in proportion to their respective percentage interests in the Operating
Company.



 

9 2.4 _Creation of New Buyer GP; Purchase of General Partner Interest_. Prior to
the Closing, Buyer will form a new Delaware limited liability company,
wholly-owned by Buyer (the " _New Buyer GP_ "). At the Closing, the General
Partner will sell and assign the General Partner Interest to the New Buyer GP,
and the New Buyer GP will purchase the General Partner Interest from the
General Partner.



2.5 _Purchase of Limited Partner Interest_. At the Closing, the Partnership
will sell and assign the Limited Partner Interest to Buyer, and Buyer will
purchase the Limited Partner Interest from the Partnership.



ARTICLE 3. PURCHASE PRICE



3.1 _Aggregate Purchase Price_. The aggregate purchase price (the " _Purchase
Price_ ") for the General Partner Interest and the Limited Partner Interest is
(A) plus (B) where (A) is $475,000,000, as adjusted pursuant to Section 3.2,
and (B) is an amount equal to interest on $475,000,000 at the rate equal to
the One-Month LIBOR Rate plus 200 basis points for each day from December 1,
2004 up to, but not including, the Closing Date. The $475,000,000 under (A) is
to be paid at the Closing in the amounts set forth below, and the amount under
(B) will be paid at the Closing in the same proportion as the amounts set
forth below. If Buyer retains any portion of the Purchase Price pursuant to
Section 9.14, then such reduction will be made in the same proportion as the
amounts set forth below. 



(a) $47,500 to the General Partner in exchange for the General Partner
Interest; and



(b) $474,952,500 to the Partnership in exchange for the Limited Partner
Interest.



3.2  _Working Capital Adjustment_.



(a) Buyer will pay to the Sellers an amount equal to $9,500,000 (the "
_Estimated Working Capital Payment_ "), as a working capital adjustment to the
Purchase Price, based upon an expected level of Working Capital as of November
30, 2004 of $15,000,000. The Estimated Working Capital Payment will be paid
by Buyer to the Sellers at the Closing. Thereafter, the Purchase Price will be
further increased or decreased in an amount equal to the amount by which
Working Capital reflected on the Closing Date Balance Sheet exceeds or is
less than $15,000,000. " _Working Capital_ " means the net aggregate dollar
amount of current assets (including the long term portion of accounts
receivable) less current liabilities (excluding the current portion of long-
term debt and accrued interest, intercompany liabilities and all borrowings
for working capital purposes) of the Operating Company and Stellar Propane on
a consolidated basis, as determined in accordance with GAAP and on a
basis consistent with the financial statements of the Partnership included in
the SEC Reports and the Propane Business Financials.



 

10 (b) Within 60 days after the Closing Date, Buyer will prepare and deliver to
the Sellers a consolidated balance sheet of the Operating Company and Stellar
Propane as of November 30, 2004 (the " _Closing Date Balance Sheet_ "). The
Closing Date Balance Sheet will be prepared in accordance with GAAP and on a
basis consistent with the financial statements of the Partnership included in
the SEC Reports and the Propane Business Financials. The Closing Date Balance
Sheet will attach Buyers calculation of the adjustments required to the
Purchase Price pursuant to Section 3.2(a). The Sellers and their
Representatives may review all work papers and other supporting documentation
used by Buyer in or relevant to the creation of the Closing Date Balance
Sheet, and may make reasonable inquiries of Buyers Representatives, during
the 60 day period in which Buyer is preparing the Closing Date Balance Sheet
and for a period of 30 days after receipt of the Closing Date Balance Sheet.



(c) The Closing Date Balance Sheet will become final and binding upon the
Sellers for purposes of calculating the adjustment to the Purchase Price
hereunder 30 days after delivery thereof to the Sellers unless the Sellers
within such time period deliver written notice to Buyer of their disagreement
as to any item included in the Closing Date Balance Sheet or in Buyers
calculation of the adjustment to the Purchase Price required under this
Section 3.2 (an " _Adjustment Dispute Notice_ "). Any such Adjustment Dispute
Notice must specify in reasonable detail the nature of such disagreement and
the basis and supporting evidence for the Sellers position with respect to
the disputed items. The parties will attempt in good faith for a period of ten
days following the date of the Adjustment Dispute Notice to resolve any
disagreement and, if they are unable to do so within such period, will submit
the disputed items to an independent accounting firm of national reputation
(the " _Referral Firm_ "), whose decision with respect to the matters disputed
in the Adjustment Dispute Notice will be final and binding. The Referral Firm
will render its decision with respect to such matters within 30 days after
they are submitted to it. The parties will promptly provide all information
and documents within their respective possession that the Referral Firm, in
its sole discretion, considers necessary or desirable in order to make its
decision with respect to the disputed matters. The fees and expenses of the
Referral Firm will be borne equally by the Sellers and Buyer.



(d) Within five days after the Closing Date Balance Sheet is finally
determined either through agreement of the parties or through submission to
the Referral Firm as described in Section 3.2(c), Buyer will pay to the
Sellers (in the same proportion as the payments made pursuant to Section 3.1)
or the Sellers will pay to Buyer, as the case may be, by wire transfer the net
amount owed pursuant to the Purchase Price adjustment provisions of this
Section 3.2.



3.3 _Results of Interim Operations_. The parties desire to effect the
transaction contemplated by this Agreement solely for purposes of economic
effect and for accounting treatment as if the Closing occurred at 11:59 p.m.
on November 30, 2004. In order to more fully accomplish such economic effect,
after November 30, 2004, the Sellers will cause the Operating Company and
Stellar Propane to refrain from making any distributions (in cash or
otherwise) to their respective partners, shareholders or members or make any
capital contribution to a subsidiary other than the Star/Petro Distribution.
In addition, the Sellers will, on or prior to the Closing Date, reimburse the
Operating Company and Stellar Propane for all amounts paid (whether of
interest, principal, fees, prepayment costs, make-whole premiums or other
similar costs) during the month of December, 2004 by either the Operating
Company or Stellar Propane



 

11 relating to Indebtedness (including borrowings for working capital purposes)
or relating to payments made under Intercompany Agreements excluding payments
for actual goods or services provided consistent with past practices.



3.4 _Allocation of Purchase Price_. The Purchase Price and any liabilities of
the Sellers attributable to the General Partner Interest, the Limited Partner
Interest or the Stellar Propane Interest will be allocated among the assets of
the Operating Company and Stellar Propane in accordance with the rules under
Sections 734(b), 751, 755 and 1060 of the Code and in accordance with the
attached  _Schedule 3.4_ , and Buyer and the Sellers will file any
informational statements or forms required by Law. Unless otherwise required
by Law, Buyer and the Sellers will act, and will cause their respective
Affiliates and Representatives to act, in accordance with the relevant Tax
Returns or similar filings (including any forms or reports required to be
filed pursuant to Section 1060 of the Code (the " _1060 Forms_ ")), to
cooperate in the preparation of any 1060 Forms, to file such 1060 Forms in
the manner required by law and not to take any position inconsistent with
_Schedule 3.4_ upon examination of any Tax refund or refund claim, in any
Legal Proceeding or otherwise. The parties will amend _Schedule 3.4_  upon
determining the Purchase Price adjustment pursuant to Section 3.2.

Indebtedness, as more fully described in the Partnerships Form 8-K filed on
November 5, 2004, as amended or replaced from time to time, and related
transactions (the " _Chase Refinancing Proposal_ "), the Sellers shall
promptly notify Buyer if any proposals are received by, any information is
requested from, or any negotiations or discussions are sought to be initiated
or continued with, the Sellers, the Operating Company, Stellar Propane or any
of their Representatives, in each case, in connection with an Acquisition
Proposal (an " _Acquisition Proposal Interest_ "), which notice must identify
the name of the Person indicating such Acquisition Proposal Interest and the
material terms and conditions of any Acquisition Proposal.



(b) Except with respect to the Chase Refinancing Proposal, the Sellers and
their Representatives shall (and shall cause the Operating Company and
Stellar Propane and their respective Representatives to) immediately cease
and cause to be terminated all existing discussions, negotiations and
communications with any Persons with respect to any Acquisition Proposal.
Except as provided in Section 8.8(c), from the date of this Agreement until
the earlier of the termination of this Agreement or the Closing, none of the
Sellers, the Operating Company or Stellar Propane may, and may not authorize
or permit their respective Representatives to, directly or indirectly (i)
initiate, solicit or knowingly encourage, or knowingly take any action to
facilitate the making of, any offer or proposal that constitutes or that may
be reasonably likely to lead to any third-party Acquisition Proposal or
(ii) enter into any Contract or Other Agreement with respect to any
Acquisition Proposal. Notwithstanding the foregoing, nothing contained in this
Section 8.8 prohibits the Sellers from (x) in the event of an unsolicited
Acquisition Proposal, requesting from the third party such information as may
be reasonably necessary for the board of directors of the General Partner (on
behalf of itself and as general partner of the Partnership) to inform itself
as to the material terms of such Acquisition Proposal for the sole purpose of
determining whether such Acquisition Proposal constitutes a Superior Proposal,
(y) taking (and disclosing to the Partnerships unitholders or partners) its
position with respect to a tender or exchange offer by a third party pursuant
to Rules 14d-9 and 14e-2 under the Exchange Act or (z) making such disclosure
to the Partnerships unitholders or partners as in the good-faith judgment of
the board of directors of the General Partner, after receipt of advice from
outside legal counsel to the Sellers, that such disclosure is necessary for
the board of directors of the General Partner to comply with its fiduciary
duties under applicable Law.



(c) Notwithstanding the foregoing, prior to the Closing Date, the Company
may furnish information concerning the Business or the assets associated with
the Business to any Person pursuant to a confidentiality agreement with terms
no less favorable to the Sellers or their Affiliates than those contained in
the Confidentiality Agreement and may negotiate and participate in
discussions and negotiations with such Person concerning an Acquisition
Proposal if, but only if, (i) such Acquisition Proposal is reasonably likely
to be consummated (taking into



 

36 account the legal aspects of the proposal, the Person making the Acquisition
Proposal and approvals required in connection therewith), (ii) such entity or
group has on an unsolicited basis, and in the absence of any violation of this
Section 8.8 by the Sellers or their Affiliates, submitted a bona fide, fully
financed, written proposal to the Sellers relating to any such transaction
that the board of directors of the General Partner determines in good faith,
after receiving advice from the Sellers financial advisors, is more favorable
to the Partnerships unitholders or partners from a financial point of view
than the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, and (iii) in the good
faith opinion of the board of directors of the General Partner, after
consultation with outside legal counsel to the Sellers, providing
such information or access or engaging in such discussions or negotiations is
in the best interests of the Partnership and its unitholders or partners and
necessary in order for the board of directors of the General Partner to
discharge its fiduciary duties to the Partnerships unitholders or partners
under applicable Law (an Acquisition Proposal that satisfies clauses (i), (ii)
and (iii) being referred to as a " _Superior Proposal_ "). The Sellers shall
promptly, and in any event within two business days following receipt of a
Superior Proposal and prior to providing any Person with any material non-
public information, notify Buyer of the receipt of the same. The Sellers shall
promptly provide to Buyer any material non-public information regarding the
Sellers, the Operating Company, Stellar Propane, the Business or the assets
associated with the Business provided to any Person that was not previously
provided to Buyer, such additional information to be provided no later than
the date of provision of such information to such Person.



(d) Except as set forth in this Section 8.8, neither the board of directors of
the General Partner nor any committee thereof may (i) withdraw or modify, or
propose to withdraw or modify, in a manner adverse to the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement or to Buyer, the approval or recommendation by
the board of directors of the General Partner of this Agreement or the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement, (ii) approve or recommend or
propose to approve or recommend, any Acquisition Proposal or (iii) enter into
any Contract or Other Agreement with respect to any Acquisition Proposal.
Notwithstanding the foregoing, prior to the Closing, the board of directors of
the General Partner may (subject to the terms of this and the following
sentence) withdraw or modify its approval or recommendation of this Agreement
or the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, approve or recommend a
Superior Proposal, or enter into a Contract or Other Agreement with respect
to a Superior Proposal (an " _Acquisition Agreement_ "), in each case at any
time after the third business day following the Sellers delivery to Buyer of
written notice advising Buyer that the board of directors of the General
Partner has received a Superior Proposal, specifying the material terms and
conditions of such Superior Proposal and identifying the Person making such
Superior Proposal; provided, however, that neither the Sellers nor any of
their Affiliates may enter into a Contract or Other Agreement with respect to
a Superior Proposal unless the Sellers comply with Section 8.8(e).



(e) The Sellers may terminate this Agreement and the Sellers or their
Affiliates may enter into an Acquisition Agreement with respect to a
Superior Proposal, provided that, prior to any such termination, (i) the
Sellers have provided Buyer written notice that they intend to terminate this
Agreement pursuant to this Section 8.8(e), identifying the Superior Proposal
then determined to be more favorable and the parties thereto, and (ii) at
least three full business days after the Sellers have provided the notice

the use of and reliance on any audited or unaudited financial statements
relating to the Operating Company and Stellar Propane reasonably requested by
Guarantor to be used in any public filings that Guarantor desires to make
under the Securities Act, including any registration statements of Guarantor.
In addition, the Sellers will use commercially reasonable efforts to obtain
the consent of KPMG LLP to the use of and reliance on such financial
statements. Prior to the Closing, the Sellers will provide Buyer and
Guarantor such available information, and make available such personnel, as
Buyer or Guarantor may reasonably request in order to assist Buyer and
Guarantor to obtain financing or raise funds, including any public equity or
debt offerings to be registered under the Securities Act.



8.10 _HSR Act_.



(a) On or before November 19, 2004, the parties will make such filings as may

this Agreement. Thereafter, the parties will file as promptly as practicable
all reports or other documents required or requested by the U.S. Federal
Trade Commission or the U.S. Department of Justice pursuant to the HSR Act or
otherwise including requests for additional information concerning such
transactions, so that the waiting period specified in the HSR Act will expire
as soon as reasonably possible after the execution and delivery of this
Agreement. Without limiting the foregoing, the parties will use commercially
reasonable efforts to cooperate and oppose any preliminary injunction sought
by the U.S. Federal Trade Commission or the U.S. Department of Justice

Agreement. The Sellers, on the one hand, and Buyer, on the other hand, will
equally share the application fees required in connection with the filings

reasonable assistance as the other may reasonably request in connection with
its preparation of necessary filings or submissions under the HSR Act.



8.11 _Severance Obligations_.



(a) Prior to the Closing, the Sellers will be responsible for, and agree
to pay, all amounts due any employees of the Operating Company or Stellar
Propane relating to any severance, retention, change in control or other

similar payment obligations payable by the Sellers to Donald Rainey as a
result of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, the Sellers will

payments that would be made to Donald Rainey on or about the Closing would be
paid at such time and (ii) half of the lump sum payments that would be made to
him on or about the Closing would be placed in an escrow account on or about
the Closing Date, with the amount placed in



 

38 escrow (plus interest earned on such amount) paid to him on March 31, 2005,
provided that the payment of such escrowed funds to him would be contingent
upon him continuing to assist Buyer in the operation of the Business until

an employee of Buyer or its Affiliates after the Closing.

Company, Stellar Propane and their respective Benefit Plans to resign or to be
removed from such offices.

to afford Buyer the opportunity to determine, in its sole discretion, what
employee benefits it will provide to the employees of the Operating Company

benefits will be provided, subject to applicable privacy and other Laws, the
Sellers will (and will cause the Operating Company and Stellar Propane to) use
commercially reasonable efforts to afford to Buyer and its Representatives
full and free access in a reasonable manner, upon reasonable notice and at
reasonable times, to each of the Sellers, the Operating Companys and Stellar
Propanes Benefit Plan documents, including access to all files, records,
reports and other data and information relating thereto, and all personnel
involved with the administration of such Benefit Plans. The Sellers will also
make available to Buyer a copy of the documents and instruments governing each
Benefit Plan (including, where applicable, the plan document, summary plan
description or other summary, most recent actuarial report, and trust or other
funding arrangement).



(b) If and to the extent requested by Buyer, the Sellers and their Affiliates
will amend or terminate any Benefit Plan; provided, however, any
such amendment or termination will comply with all applicable Laws and will
not be required if otherwise prohibited by the terms of the Collective
Bargaining Agreements. Any such amendment or termination may be made
conditional upon the Closing provided that such amendment or termination
becomes effective immediately prior to the Closing.



(c) Buyer will notify the Sellers at least five days prior to the Closing as
to (i) whether Buyer desires the Sellers to assign and transfer to Buyer (or
cause the Operating Company and Stellar Propane to assign and transfer to
Buyer) any of the Sellers, the Operating Companys or Stellar Propanes
health or other benefit plan policies of insurance and (ii) whether (A) it
will continue to sponsor the Operating Companys 401(k) profit sharing plan
either as a merged plan with Buyers existing 401(k) profit sharing plan or as
a separate plan or (B) it desires that the Operating Companys 401(k) profit
sharing plan be terminated prior to the Closing.



(d) For purposes of determining (i) eligibility to participate in or
vesting under Buyers applicable 401(k) profit sharing plan, (ii) eligibility
to participate in applicable health plans and (iii) eligibility to participate

Company or Stellar Propane on the Closing Date or who are hired within 15

employee of either the Operating Company or Stellar Propane.



 

39 8.14 _Litigation Retained by the Sellers_. The Sellers will be responsible
for, and agree to defend, hold harmless and indemnify Buyer and its
Affiliates (including the Operating Company and Stellar Propane) from and
against all actual or threatened Legal Proceedings relating to, arising out of
or resulting from (i) the execution, delivery or performance of this
Agreement by the Sellers, (ii) any claim by a partner or unitholder of the
Sellers or any of their Affiliates, in such partners or unitholders capacity
as a partner or unitholder, (iii) the Partnerships disclosures contained in
the SEC Reports or any failure to disclose with respect to the SEC Reports,

certain unitholders of the Partnership against the Partnership and certain of
its Affiliates (including the Operating Company), (iv) any claim against any
officer or director of the Operating Company or Stellar Propane relating to
events, facts or circumstances arising on or before the Closing Date, or (v)
any claim similar to those described in clauses (i), (ii), (iii) and (iv).



8.15 _Parent Guaranty_. Guarantor hereby unconditionally and absolutely

Sellers will amend their Organizational Documents and the Organizational
Documents of the Operating Company to effect any amendments of such
Organizational Documents required in order to effect the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement, including amendments to Sections 10.2,
10.3, 12.1(b) and 13.1(b) of the Amended and Restated Agreement of Limited
Partnership of the Operating Company and amendments to such Organizational
Documents to allow for the Star/Petro Distribution. Prior to making any such
amendments to the Organizational Documents of the Operating Company, the
Sellers will obtain the prior approval of Buyer as to the form and substance
of such amendments, which consent will not be unreasonably withheld.



8.17 _Environmental Assessments_.



(a) Prior to the Closing, Buyer may, in Buyers sole judgment and discretion
and at Buyers sole expense, cause Phase I environmental site assessments (the
" _Environmental Assessments_ ") of the Real Property to be conducted by a
qualified engineer or environmental consultant of Buyers choice. All
Environmental Assessments will be performed in such a manner as to not
physically damage the Real Property.



(b) Upon reasonable advance oral or written notice to Joseph P. Cavanaugh, the
Sellers will (and will cause the Operating Company and Stellar Propane
to) allow Buyer and its Representatives reasonable access to the Real
Property for the purpose of conducting the Environmental Assessments. The

Environmental Assessments, including accompanying Buyers Representatives on
any physical investigation of the Real Property.

9.13 _No Governmental Restraint_. There is not in effect any temporary

9.14 _Special Closing Requirements_.



(a) Provided that there has been no willful breach of this Agreement by the
Sellers, other than breaches that do not have an adverse economic effect
on Buyer, if the Sellers have performed (or Buyer has waived) all of their
respective obligations in Section 8.2 and all of the conditions set forth in
Sections 9.6(b), 9.7, 9.8, 9.9, 9.10, 9.11, 9.12 and 9.13 have been satisfied,
notwithstanding the failure of one or more of the conditions set forth in
Sections 9.1, 9.2, 9.3, 9.4, 9.5 or 9.6(a) to be satisfied, upon notice by the
Sellers, Buyer shall, subject to all of the terms of this Section 9.14,
proceed with the Closing provided that, in Buyers good faith judgment,
substantiated in a notice to the Sellers containing specific reference to
relevant and available information (the " _Damages Notice_ "), the events,
facts or circumstances that have caused one or more of the conditions set
forth in Sections 9.1, 9.2, 9.3, 9.4, 9.5 or 9.6(a) to be unsatisfied (the "
_Unsatisfied Conditions_ ") have not and are not reasonably likely to cause an
adverse economic effect or other Damages (including, solely for the purposes
of this Section 9.14, any diminution in the fair value of the Business) in
excess of $47,500,000. The Damages Notice will also include Buyers good faith
estimate (" _Buyer s Damage Estimate_") of the amount of such adverse
economic effect or other Damages (including diminution in the fair value of
the Business) as a result of such Unsatisfied Conditions. The Sellers shall
promptly provide Buyer with all relevant and available documentation
and information in the Sellers possession or under their control relating to
the Unsatisfied Conditions.



(b) If Buyers Damage Estimate is less than or equal to $15,000,000, Buyer
shall proceed with the Closing and may immediately pursue an indemnity claim
pursuant to Article 11. If Buyers Damage Estimate exceeds $15,000,000 but is
less than or equal to $47,500,000, then Buyer and the Sellers will enter into
good faith negotiations to determine a possible reduction in the Purchase
Price. If Buyer and the Sellers cannot agree upon a reduction in the Purchase
Price, the Sellers may elect to terminate this Agreement. If the Sellers do
not terminate this Agreement, Buyer (i) shall proceed with the Closing, (ii)
may withhold a portion of the Purchase Price equal to the amount by which
Buyers Damage Estimate exceeds $15,000,000, and (iii) may immediately pursue
an indemnity claim pursuant to Article 11. If Buyers Damages Estimate is in
excess of $47,500,000 then this Agreement may be terminated by Buyer or the
Sellers.



 

43 (c) Any decision by the Sellers not to exercise their termination right
pursuant to Section 9.14(b) will not prejudice any defense they may have in
any indemnification proceeding under Article 11 or any claim they may have to
the remaining portion of the Purchase Price. Any decision by Buyer to reduce
the Purchase Price pursuant to Section 9.14(b), and the amount of such
reduction, will not prejudice any claim for the actual amount of the adverse
economic effect or other Damages (including diminution in the fair value of
the Business) as a result of any Unsatisfied Conditions. Unless
otherwise agreed by the Sellers and Buyer, the amount of Buyers Damage
Estimate is not conclusive (and is not to be used by any party as evidence in
any dispute) of the final amount of any claim and no party will be deemed to
have accepted such amount as determinative of the actual amount of the
adverse economic effect or other Damages.



ARTICLE 10. CONDITIONS TO OBLIGATIONS OF THE SELLERS TO CONSUMMATE THE

Agreement.

claims, actions or causes of action, involving toxic torts, and those seeking

extent they arise out of the pre-Closing handling, treatment, storage,

Operating Company or Stellar Propane of any Hazardous Substance, oil, gasoline
or other petroleum products at any property, even though such claim, action
or cause of action may be made or filed on or after the Closing Date, (ii) the
Sellers, the Operating Company or Stellar Propane accepting, solely prior to
the Closing, any Hazardous Substance for transport to disposal or treatment
Facilities, (iii) any Release of Hazardous Substances, oil, gasoline or

about or into the Real Property and including (without limitation) the extent
to which such Release continues after the Closing, whether or not such
Release or threat of a Release occurred as the result of the negligence or
misconduct of the Sellers, the Operating Company or Stellar Propane or any
other third party or otherwise, or (iv) any violation, actual or alleged, of
or any other liability under or in connection with any Environmental Law
solely to the extent related to conditions created prior to Closing that
affect soil, air, surface water or groundwater. Furthermore, if Buyer or any
of its Affiliates (including the Operating Company or Stellar Propane) is
required by any Governmental Authorities to clean up any Real Property as a
result of a Release of Hazardous Substances, oil, gasoline or petroleum-
related wastes disposed prior to the Closing, the Sellers hereby agree to
conduct such environmental cleanup solely to the extent such cleanup is
related to a Release, including a continuing Release, that began or occurred
before the Closing and to the full extent required by any Governmental
Authorities having jurisdiction over the subject matter thereof in the most
cost-effective manner achievable as determined by laws, regulations, and
policies or



 

46 agreed to by such Governmental Authorities. Notwithstanding any other
provisions of this Agreement to the contrary, Sections 11.1 and 11.3
constitute the sole and exclusive indemnity under this Agreement for Damages
related to or arising out of Environmental Laws.



(b) Buyer, the Operating Company and Stellar Propane hereby covenant and agree
to indemnify, protect, defend and hold harmless the Sellers, and
their members, officers, agents, employees, Representatives, successors and
assigns from and against any and all Damages (including reimbursement of
clean-up costs) directly or indirectly arising from or as a result of (i)
claims, actions or causes of action, involving toxic torts, and those seeking
administrative enforcement, injunctive relief or reimbursement of
investigation and clean-up costs or natural resource damages, solely to the
extent they arise out of the post-Closing handling, treatment, storage,
disposal or transportation or arranging therefor, by Buyer, the Operating
Company or Stellar Propane of any Hazardous Substance, oil, gasoline or other
petroleum products at any property, (ii) Buyer, the Operating Company
or Stellar Propane accepting, solely after the Closing, any Hazardous
Substance for transport to disposal or treatment Facilities, (iii) any Release
of Hazardous Substances, oil, gasoline or petroleum products solely to the
extent it occurred after the Closing upon, about or into the Real Property,
whether or not such Release or threat of a Release occurred as the result of
the negligence or misconduct of Buyer, the Operating Company or Stellar
Propane or any other third party or otherwise, but excluding any continuing
Releases to the extent attributable to Seller in Section 11.3(a)(iii), or (iv)
any violation, actual or alleged, of or any other liability under or in
connection with any Environmental Law solely to the extent related
to conditions created after Closing that affect soil, air, surface water or
groundwater.



(c) Buyer, its subsidiaries, successors, and assigns agree to provide the
Sellers and its Representatives access to the Real Property as might
reasonably be required by the Sellers or its Representatives to perform the
obligations of the Sellers under Section 11.3 or as otherwise required by a
Governmental Authority. Buyer agrees to fully cooperate with the Sellers in
the Sellers performance of their obligations under Section 11.3 or as
otherwise required by a Governmental Authority. Access and cooperation under
this Section 11.3(c) will be provided without any additional compensation to
Buyer or its subsequent purchasers, lessees or assignees. To the extent Buyer
conveys, leases or assigns any interest in the Business or Real Property,
Buyer will by contract and recordation of rights on the land records have its
lessees, its assignees and its immediate subsequent purchasers (with which
Buyer has privity) agree to this same requirement of access and cooperation.
Failure by Buyer to ensure such access or cooperation with respect to a parcel
of Real Property will relieve the Sellers of their indemnity obligations under
this Section 11.3 with respect to such parcel only to the extent that Seller
is prejudiced in carrying out its obligations under this Section 11.3.



(d) Unless required by Law or to mitigate Damages, Buyer (on behalf of itself
and its subsidiaries) agrees not to engage in communications, either oral or
written, with any third party, including any Governmental Authority, which
communications have the intent of resulting in (i) an allegation of a
violation of any Environmental Law related to the Real Property or the
Business, (ii) an unnecessary investigation or remediation of any Real
Property or environmental conditions related to the Real Property or the
Business, or (iii) a claim for Damages related to or arising out of
Environmental Laws. Buyer will make reasonable efforts to obtain the agreement
of its lessees, its assignees and its immediate subsequent purchasers (with



 

47 which Buyer has privity) to this same requirement. To the extent that Buyer or
any of its subsidiaries breaches this covenant with respect to a parcel of
Real Property, the Sellers are relieved from their obligations under this
Section 11.3 with respect to such parcel only to the extent that the Sellers
are prejudiced in carrying out their obligations under Section 11.3.
Notwithstanding any of the foregoing, Buyer and its subsidiaries may engage in
communications with their Representatives, contractors and insurance carriers
for any purpose even if clauses (i), (ii) and (iii) above result and
may communicate with other third parties and Governmental Authorities that
are, or which Buyer and its subsidiaries believe in good faith are, necessary
to comply with Law, to address a violation of Environmental Law, to mitigate
Damages, or to establish a bona fide prospective purchaser, innocent
landowner or contiguous landowner defense under Environmental Law, and all
such communications will not be construed as a breach of this provision.



11.4 _Procedure_. All claims for indemnification by a party under
this Article 11 (the party claiming indemnification and the party against
whom such claims are asserted being referred to as the " _Indemnified Party_ "
and the " _Indemnifying Party_ ," respectively) must be asserted and resolved
as follows:



(a) If any claim or demand for which an Indemnifying Party would be liable to
an Indemnified Party under this Agreement is asserted against or sought to be
collected from such Indemnified Party by a third party, such Indemnified Party
shall with reasonable promptness give notice (the " _Claim Notice_ ") to the
Indemnifying Party of such claim or demand, specifying the nature of and
specific basis for such claim or demand and the amount or the estimated amount
thereof to the extent then feasible (which estimate is not conclusive of the
final amount of such claim and demand). The Indemnifying Party is not
obligated to indemnify the Indemnified Party under this Agreement with respect
to any such claim or demand if the Indemnified Party fails to notify
the Indemnifying Party thereof in accordance with the provisions of this
Agreement, and, as a result of such failure, the Indemnifying Partys ability
to defend against the claim or demand is materially prejudiced. The
Indemnifying Party has ten days from the delivery or mailing of the Claim
Notice (the " _Notice Period_ ") to notify the Indemnified Party (i) whether
or not it disputes the liability of the Indemnifying Party to the Indemnified
Party hereunder with respect to such claim or demand, and (ii) whether or not
it desires, at the cost and expense of the Indemnifying Party, to defend the
Indemnified Party against such claim or demand; provided, however, that any
Indemnified Party is hereby authorized, but is not obligated, prior to and
during the Notice Period, to file any motion, answer or other pleading that it
considers necessary or appropriate to protect its interests or those of the
Indemnifying Party. If the Indemnifying Party notifies the Indemnified Party
within the Notice Period that it desires to defend the Indemnified Party
against such claim or demand, the Indemnifying Party shall, subject to the
last sentence of this Section 11.4(a), have the right to control the defense
against the claim by all appropriate proceedings and any settlement
negotiations, provided that to the satisfaction of the Indemnified Party, the
Indemnifying Party shall secure the Indemnified Party against such contested
claims by posting a bond or otherwise. If the Indemnified Party desires to
participate in, but not control, any such defense or settlement, it may do so
at its sole cost and expense. If the Indemnifying Party fails to respond to
the Indemnified Party within the Notice Period, elects not to defend the
Indemnified Party, or after electing to defend fails to commence or reasonably
pursue such defense, then the Indemnified Party has the right, but not the
obligation, to undertake or continue the defense of, and to



 

48 compromise or settle (exercising reasonable business judgment), the claim or
other matter all on behalf, for the account and at the risk of the
Indemnifying Party. Notwithstanding the foregoing, if the basis of the
proceeding relates to a condition of operations that existed or were conducted
both prior to and after the Closing Date or if the Indemnified Party would be
otherwise adversely affected as a result of any adverse decision of such
proceeding, each party has the same right to participate at its own expense
and at its own risk in the proceeding without either party having the right of
control. 



(b) If requested by the Indemnifying Party, the Indemnified Party will, at
the Indemnifying Partys expense, cooperate with the Indemnifying Party and
its counsel in contesting any claim or demand that the Indemnifying Party
elects to contest, or, if appropriate and related to the claim in question,
in making any counterclaim against the Person asserting the third party claim
or demand, or any cross-complaint against any Person. Except as set forth in
Section 11.4(a), no claim as to which indemnification is sought under this
Agreement may be settled without the consent of the Indemnifying Party.



(c) If any Indemnified Party has a claim against the Indemnifying Party
hereunder that does not involve a claim or demand being asserted against or
sought to be collected from it by a third party, the Indemnified Party shall
send a Claim Notice with respect to such claim to the Indemnifying Party. If
the Indemnifying Party disputes such claim, such dispute will be resolved by
litigation in an appropriate court of competent jurisdiction.



11.5 _Time Limitations_. If the Closing occurs, the Sellers will have
no liability for indemnification under this Agreement with respect to any
representation or warranty, or covenant or obligation to be performed and
complied with prior to the Closing Date or indemnification obligation under
Sections 11.1, other than those in Sections 5.1, 5.2, 5.3, 5.5, 5.10, 5.14,
8.2, 8.14, 11.1(iii), 11.1(iv) and 11.3, unless on or before the end of the
18th month following the Closing Date Buyer notifies the Sellers of a claim
specifying the factual basis of that claim in reasonable detail to the extent
then known by Buyer; a claim with respect to Sections 5.1, 5.2, 5.3, 5.5,
5.14, 8.2, 8.14, 11.1(iii), 11.1(iv) and 11.3, or a claim for indemnification
or reimbursement not based upon any representation or warranty or any
covenant or obligation to be performed and complied with prior to the Closing
Date, may be made at any time; a claim with respect to Section 5.10 must be
made on or before the fifth anniversary of the Closing Date. If the Closing
occurs, Buyer will have no liability for indemnification under this Agreement
with respect to any representation or warranty, or covenant or obligation to
be performed and complied with prior to the Closing Date, other than those in
Sections 6.1 and 6.2, unless on or before the end of the 18th month following
the Closing Date the Sellers notify Buyer of a claim specifying the factual
basis of that claim in reasonable detail to the extent then known by the
Sellers; a claim with respect to Sections 6.1 or 6.2, or a claim for
indemnification or reimbursement not based upon any representation or warranty
or any covenant or obligation to be performed and complied with prior to the
Closing Date, may be made at any time.



11.6 _Limitations on Amount_. Subject to the last sentence of this Section
11.6, no party will have liability for indemnification under any Section of
this Article 11 (other than Sections 11.1(iii), 11.1(iv) and 11.2(ii), to
which this sentence is inapplicable) until the total of all Damages with
respect to such matters exceeds $5,000,000, and once such amount has been



 

49 exceeded, such party will be liable for indemnification for the total of all
Damages in excess of $5,000,000. Subject to the last sentence of this Section
11.6, each partys aggregate liability under this Article 11 (other than
Sections 11.1(iii), 11.1(iv) and 11.2(ii), to which this sentence is
inapplicable) is limited to $106,875,000. However, this Section 11.6 will not
apply to any breach of any of the parties covenants in this Agreement that
are to be performed at or after the Closing (including Sections 8.2, 8.14,
11.1(iii), 11.1(iv) and 11.3) or any of the representations and warranties
contained in Sections 5.1, 5.2, 5.3, 5.5, 5.10(a), 5.10(c), 5.10(d), 5.14,
5.21, 6.1, 6.2 or 6.4.



11.7 _Exclusive Remedy_. In the absence of fraud, each partys sole and
exclusive remedy with respect to any and all claims relating to the subject
matter of this Agreement will be pursuant to the indemnification provisions
set forth in this Article 11; provided, however, that the indemnification
provisions set forth in this Article 11 do not apply to claims arising out of
or relating to the Noncompetition Agreement or the Transition
Services Agreement, both of which will be governed by their respective terms.



11.8 _Waiver of Punitive Damages_. No party will be liable to another party
for any punitive damages resulting from or arising out of this Agreement or
the transactions contemplated by this Agreement.



11.9 _Losses Net of Insurance Proceeds_. The amount of any and all Damages
under this Article 11 will be determined net of any amounts actually recovered
by the Indemnified Party under insurance policies, indemnities or other
reimbursement arrangements with respect to such Damages.



ARTICLE 12. SURVIVAL OF COVENANTS, AGREEMENTS, REPRESENTATIONS AND

 

WARRANTIES; RIGHT OF OFFSET



12.1 _Survival_. All representations, warranties, covenants and agreements
made by the parties each to the other in this Agreement or pursuant to this
Agreement in any certificate, instrument or document will survive the
consummation of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement for the period
contemplated by Section 11.5.



12.2 _Right of Offset_. The Sellers have made certain representations and
warranties to Buyer in this Agreement and the schedules and exhibits attached
to this Agreement in connection with the acquisition of the General Partner
Interest, the Limited Partner Interest, the Stellar Propane Interest and the
Business. As a result of such representations, warranties and agreements,
there exists the possibility that the Sellers will be liable to Buyer or be
required to indemnify Buyer in accordance with this Agreement. Any obligation
of Buyer to the Sellers is subject to any such liability or indemnification,
and Buyer may, at its election, offset against any payment required by Buyer
pursuant to this Agreement or the schedules and exhibits attached to this
Agreement on the Closing Date (in the case of an offset pursuant to Section
9.14) or after the Closing (in all other cases) an amount equal to or less
than the amount that such party may be liable to Buyer or may be required to
pay Buyer pursuant to such indemnification.



 

50 ARTICLE 13. EXPENSES



Each party shall pay, without right of reimbursement from any other Person
(including the Operating Company and Stellar Propane), the costs incurred by
such party incident to the preparation and execution of this Agreement and
performance of their respective obligations under this Agreement, whether or
not the transactions contemplated by this Agreement are consummated,
including the fees and disbursements of brokers, legal counsel, accountants
and consultants employed by the respective parties in connection with the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement.



ARTICLE 14. TERMINATION



14.1 _Termination_. This Agreement may be terminated at any time prior to the
Closing:



(a) by agreement of all of the parties; 



(b) by the Sellers if the Closing has not taken place on or before December
20, 2004, provided that the right to terminate this Agreement under this
Section 14.1(b) is not available to the Sellers if the willful failure of the
Sellers to fulfill any obligation under this Agreement has been the cause of,
or results in, the failure of the Closing to occur within such period;



(c) by Buyer if the Closing has not taken place on or before December 31,
2004, provided that the right to terminate this Agreement under this Section
14.1(c) is not available to Buyer if the failure of Buyer to fulfill any
obligation under this Agreement has been the cause of, or results in, the
failure of the Closing to occur within such period;



(d) by the Sellers pursuant to Section 8.8;



(e) by the Sellers pursuant to Section 9.14; and



(f) by Buyer pursuant to Section 9.14.



14.2 _No Liability; Termination Fee_.



(a) In the event of a termination of this Agreement pursuant to Section
14.1(a), there will be no liability on the parties as a result thereof under
this Agreement. A termination under Sections 14.1(b) or 14.1(e) by the
Sellers will not prejudice any claim for Damages that the Sellers may have
hereunder or in law or in equity as a consequence of any matter giving rise to
a termination of this Agreement under Sections 14.1(b) or 14.1(e). A
termination under Sections 14.1(c) or 14.1(f) by Buyer will not prejudice any
claim for Damages that Buyer may have hereunder or in law or in equity as a
consequence of any willful breach of this Agreement by the Sellers, but,
except as provided in Section 9.14, in the absence of any willful breach,
there will be no liability on the Sellers as a result of such termination or
as a consequence of any matter giving rise to a right of termination under
Sections 14.1(c) or 14.1(f). A termination under Section 14.1(e) by the
Sellers will not prejudice any claim for Damages that Buyer may have hereunder
or in law or in equity as a consequence of any matter giving rise to
a termination of this Agreement under Section 14.1(e).



 

51 (b) A termination under Section 14.1(d) will entitle Buyer to the Termination
Fee pursuant to Section 8.8.



14.3 _Notice of Termination_. Buyer may exercise its right of termination of
this Agreement only by delivering written notice to that effect to the
Sellers, provided that such notice is received by the Sellers prior to the
Closing. The Sellers may exercise their right of termination of this
Agreement only by delivering written notice to that effect to Buyer, provided
that such notice is received by Buyer prior to the Closing.

Agreement will be effective only if it is in writing and (i)

15.2 _Parties in Interest and Assignment_.



(a) This Agreement is binding upon and is for the benefit of the parties and
their respective successors and permitted assigns. Except as
expressly provided in this Agreement, nothing in this Agreement, express or
implied, is intended to confer on any Person other than the parties or their
respective successors and permitted assigns any rights, remedies or
obligations or liabilities under or by reason of this Agreement.



 

52 (b) Except as provided in Section 15.2(c), neither this Agreement nor any of

portion of its rights under this Agreement to an Affiliate of Buyer or
in connection with any merger, consolidation or conversion of Buyer or any
sale of all or a significant portion of the assets of Buyer.



15.3 _Modification_. This Agreement may not be amended or modified except by a
writing signed by an authorized representative of the party against whom
enforcement of the change is sought. No waiver of the performance or breach
of, or default under, any condition or obligation of this Agreement will be
deemed to be a waiver of any other performance, or breach of, or default under
the same or any other condition or obligation of this Agreement.



15.4  _Waiver_. Each party may, by written notice to the other party: (a)
extend the time for the performance of any of the obligations or other actions
of such other party under this Agreement; (b) waive any inaccuracies in the
representations or warranties of such other party contained in this Agreement
or in any document delivered pursuant to this Agreement; (c) waive compliance
by such other party with any of the conditions or covenants of the other
contained in this Agreement; or (d) waive or modify performance of any of the
obligations of such other party under this Agreement. Except as provided in
the preceding sentence, no action taken by or on behalf of any party,
including any investigation by or on behalf of such party, will be deemed to
constitute a waiver by the party taking such action of compliance with any
representations, warranties, covenants or agreements contained in this
Agreement.



15.5 _Entire Agreement_. This Agreement, along with the Confidentiality
Agreement, embodies the entire agreement between the parties with respect to
the subject matter hereof and there are no agreements, representations or
warranties between the parties other than those set forth or provided in this
Agreement and the Confidentiality Agreement, which Confidentiality Agreement
remains unaffected by this Agreement and in full force and effect in
accordance with its terms. All exhibits and schedules called for by this
Agreement and delivered to the parties are considered a part of this
Agreement with the same force and effect as if the same had been specifically
set forth in this Agreement.



15.6 _Execution in Multiple Originals_. This Agreement may be executed in
multiple originals, each of which is deemed an original but all of
which together constitute but one and the same instrument.



15.7  _Invalid Provisions_. If any provision of this Agreement is held to be
illegal, invalid or unenforceable under any present or future Law, and if the
rights or obligations of any party under this Agreement will not be materially
and adversely affected thereby, (a) such provision will be fully severable;
(b) this Agreement will be construed and enforced as if such illegal, invalid
or unenforceable provision had never comprised a part of this Agreement; and
(c) the remaining provisions of this Agreement will remain in full force and
effect and will not be affected by the illegal, invalid or unenforceable
provision or by its severance herefrom.



 

53 15.8 _Governing Law_. This Agreement is governed by and construed, interpreted
and enforced in accordance with the Laws of the State of Delaware applicable
to agreements made and to be performed entirely within such State, including
all matters of enforcement, validity and performance. Each of the parties to
this Agreement is a Delaware Person and each party to this Agreement agrees
that this Agreement involves at least $100,000 and that this Agreement has
been entered into in express reliance upon 6 Del. C. § 2708\.
