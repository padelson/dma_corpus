                      AGREEMENT AND PLAN OF REORGANIZATION

           This AGREEMENT AND PLAN OF REORGANIZATION (the "Agreement") is made
and entered into on April 19, 2000 among Vitesse Semiconductor Corporation, a
Delaware corporation ("Parent"), Southpaw Acquisition Corp., a Delaware
corporation and a wholly-owned subsidiary of Parent ("Sub"), SiTera
Incorporated, a Delaware corporation (the "Company"), and, with respect to
Article 8 only, Steven P. Flannery as Stockholder Representative and U.S. Bank
Trust National Association as Escrow Agent.

                                    RECITALS

           A. The Boards of Directors of each of the Company, Parent and Sub
believe it is in the best interests of each company and their respective
stockholders that Parent acquire the Company through the statutory merger of Sub
with and into the Company (the "Merger") and, in furtherance thereof, have
approved the Merger.

           B. Pursuant to the Merger, among other things, all of the issued and
outstanding shares of capital stock and options or rights to acquire capital
stock of the Company shall be converted into the right to receive or acquire, as
the case may be, shares of common stock of Parent ("Parent Common Stock").

           C. A portion of the shares of Parent Common Stock issuable by Parent
in connection with the Merger shall be placed in escrow by Parent for purposes
of satisfying damages, losses, expenses and other similar charges which result
from breaches of the representations, warranties and covenants of the Company
contained herein.

           D. Concurrently with the execution of this Agreement, and as a
condition and inducement to Parent's and Sub's willingness to enter into this
Agreement, each holder of at least 10% of each class or series of the Company's
outstanding voting stock and each officer and director of the Company shall
enter into a Voting Agreement in the form attached hereto as Exhibit A (the
"Voting Agreements").

           E. The parties intend that (i) this Agreement shall constitute a plan
of reorganization within the meaning of Treasury Regulations Section 1.368-2(g),
(ii) the Merger shall constitute a reorganization within the meaning of Section
368 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the "Code") and (iii) the
Merger shall qualify for accounting treatment as a pooling of interests if the
Closing Date shall be May 31, 2000 or earlier.

           F. The Company, on the one hand, and Parent and Sub, on the other
hand, desire to make certain representations, warranties, covenants and other
agreements in connection with the Merger.

           NOW, THEREFORE, in consideration of the covenants, promises and
representations set forth herein, and for other good and valuable consideration,
the parties agree as follows:



                                    ARTICLE 1
                                   THE MERGER

           SECTION 1.01. The Merger. At the Effective Time (as defined in
Section 1.02) and subject to and upon the terms and conditions of this Agreement
and the applicable provisions of the Delaware General Corporation Law (the
"DGCL"), Sub shall be merged with and into the Company, the separate corporate
existence of Sub shall cease and the Company shall continue as the surviving
corporation and as a wholly-owned subsidiary of Parent. The Company after the
Merger is hereinafter sometimes referred to as the "Surviving Corporation."

           SECTION 1.02. Effective Time. Unless this Agreement is earlier
terminated pursuant to Section 9.01, the closing of the Merger (the "Closing")
will take place as promptly as practicable, but no later than two (2) business
days after the last to occur of the satisfaction or waiver of the conditions set
forth in Sections 7.01 and 7.02, at the offices of Davis Polk & Wardwell, 1600
El Camino Real, Menlo Park, California, unless another place or time is agreed
to in writing by Parent and the Company. The date upon which the Closing
actually occurs is herein referred to as the "Closing Date." On the Closing
Date, the parties hereto shall cause the Merger to be consummated by filing a
certificate of merger (or like instrument)(the "Merger Certificate") with the
Secretary of State of the State of Delaware in accordance with the applicable
provisions of the DGCL (with the time of acceptance by the Secretary of State of
the State of Delaware being referred to herein as the "Effective Time").

           SECTION 1.03. Effect of the Merger. At the Effective Time, the effect
of the Merger shall be as provided in the applicable provisions of the DGCL.
Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, and subject thereto, at the
Effective Time, all the property, rights, privileges, powers and franchises of
the Company and Sub shall vest in the Surviving Corporation, and all debts,
liabilities and duties of the Company and Sub shall become the debts,
liabilities and duties of the Surviving Corporation.

           SECTION 1.04.  Certificate of Incorporation; Bylaws.

           (a) Unless otherwise determined by Parent prior to the Effective
Time, at the Effective Time, the Certificate of Incorporation of Sub shall be
the

<PAGE>



Certificate of Incorporation of the Surviving Corporation until thereafter
amended as provided by law and such Certificate of Incorporation.

           (b) The Bylaws of Sub, as in effect immediately prior to the
Effective Time, shall be the Bylaws of the Surviving Corporation until
thereafter amended.

           SECTION 1.05. Directors and Officers. The directors of the Surviving
Corporation immediately after the Effective Time shall be the directors of Sub
immediately prior to the Effective Time, each to hold the office of director of
the Surviving Corporation in accordance with the provisions of the applicable
laws of the State of Delaware and the Certificate of Incorporation and Bylaws of
the Surviving Corporation until their successors are duly qualified and elected.
The officers of the Surviving Corporation immediately after the Effective Time
shall be the officers of Sub immediately prior to the Effective Time, each to
hold office in accordance with the provisions of the Bylaws of the Surviving
Corporation.

           SECTION 1.06.  Maximum Shares to Be Issued; Effect on Capital Stock.

           (a) Shares to be Issued. The aggregate number of shares of Parent
Common Stock (i) to be issued in exchange for all outstanding shares of Series A
Preferred Stock, Series B Preferred Stock and Series C Preferred Stock of
Company ("Company Series A Preferred Stock", "Company Series B Preferred Stock",
and "Company Series C Preferred Stock," respectively, and, collectively, the
"Company Preferred Stock") and common stock of the Company ("Company Common
Stock") and (ii) reserved for issuance pursuant to warrants to purchase Company
Series B Preferred Stock ("Series B Warrants"), warrants to purchase Company
Series C Preferred Stock ("Series C Warrants," and, with the Series B Warrants,
the "Preferred Stock Warrants") and options to acquire Common Stock ("Company
Stock Options") assumed in the Merger shall be determined at the Effective Time
as set forth in Section 1.06(h) and shall not exceed, in the aggregate, the
Aggregate Share Number (as defined, along with certain other capitalized terms
used herein, in paragraph 1.06(h) below).

           (b) Conversion Stock. At the Effective Time, by virtue of the Merger
and without any action on the part of the Company, Parent or Sub, the following
shall occur:

               (i) each share of Company Series A Preferred Stock, Company
          Series B Preferred Stock and Company Series C Preferred Stock, issued
          and outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time (other than
          shares of Company Series A Preferred Stock, Company Series B Preferred
          Stock and Company Series C Preferred Stock to be canceled pursuant to
          Section 1.06(c) and any Dissenting Shares (as defined and to the
          extent provided in Section 1.07)) will be canceled and extinguished
          and be

                                        3

<PAGE>



          converted automatically into the right to receive, subject to the
          provisions of Section 1.06(g) and Article 8, that number of shares of
          Parent Common Stock equal to the Series A Preferred Exchange Ratio,
          Series B Preferred Exchange Ratio and Series C Preferred Exchange
          Ratio, respectively, upon surrender of the certificate representing
          such share of Company Series A Preferred Stock, Company Series B
          Preferred Stock or Company Series C Preferred Stock in the manner
          provided in Section 1.08.

               (ii) each share of Company Common Stock issued and outstanding
          immediately prior to the Effective Time (other than any shares of
          Company Common Stock to be canceled pursuant to Section 1.06(c) and
          any Dissenting Shares (to the extent provided in Section 1.07)), will
          be canceled and extinguished and be converted automatically into the
          right to receive, subject to the provisions of Section 1.06(g) and
          Article 8, that number of shares of Parent Common Stock equal to the
          Common Exchange Ratio, upon surrender of the certificate representing
          such share of Company Common Stock in the manner provided in Section
          1.08.

           (c) Cancellation of Parent-Owned and Company-Owned Stock. Each share
of Company Preferred Stock and Company Common Stock owned by Sub, Parent, the
Company or any direct or indirect wholly-owned subsidiary of Parent or of the
Company immediately prior to the Effective Time shall be canceled and
extinguished without any conversion thereof.

           (d) Company Stock Options and Preferred Stock Warrants.

               (i) Company Stock Options. At the Effective Time, all Company
          Stock Options then outstanding under the 1996 Amended and Restated
          Equity Incentive Plan Stock Option Plan (the "Option Plan") shall be
          assumed by Parent subject to the terms of such options in accordance
          with Section 6.14 hereof and this Section 1.06(d). Each Company Stock
          Option so assumed by Parent at the Effective Time will continue to
          have, and be subject to, the same terms and conditions set forth in
          the Option Plan immediately prior to the Effective Time (including,
          without limitation, any repurchase rights), except that (i) each
          Company Stock Option will be exercisable (or will become exercisable
          in accordance with its terms) for that number of whole shares of
          Parent Common Stock equal to the product of the number of shares of
          Company Common Stock that were issuable upon exercise of such Company
          Stock Option immediately prior to the Effective Time multiplied by the
          Common Exchange Ratio, rounded down to the nearest whole number of
          shares of Parent Common Stock, and (ii) the per share exercise price
          for the shares of Parent Common Stock issuable upon exercise of such
          assumed Company Stock Option will be equal to the quotient determined
          by dividing the exercise price per share of Company Common Stock at
          which such Company Stock Option was

                                        4

<PAGE>



          exercisable immediately prior to the Effective Time by the Common
          Exchange Ratio, rounded up to the nearest tenth of a cent.

               (ii) Series B Warrants. At the Effective Time, all Series B
          Warrants then outstanding shall be assumed by Parent. Each Series B
          Warrant so assumed by Parent at the Effective Time will continue to
          have, and be subject to, the same terms and conditions as immediately
          prior to the Effective Time, except that (i) each Series B Warrant
          will be exercisable for that number of whole shares of Parent Common
          Stock equal to the product of the number of shares of Company Series B
          Preferred Stock that were issuable upon exercise of such Series B
          Warrant immediately prior to the Effective Time multiplied by the
          Series B Preferred Exchange Ratio, rounded down to the nearest whole
          number of shares of Parent Common Stock, and (ii) the per share
          exercise price for the shares of Parent Common Stock issuable upon
          exercise of such assumed Series B Warrant will be equal to the
          quotient determined by dividing the exercise price per share of
          Company Series B Preferred Stock at which such Series B Warrant was
          exercisable immediately prior to the Effective Time by the Series B
          Preferred Exchange Ratio, rounded up to the nearest tenth of a cent.

               (iii) Series C Warrants. At the Effective Time, all Series C
          Warrants then outstanding shall be assumed by Parent. Each Series C
          Warrant so assumed by Parent at the Effective Time will continue to
          have, and be subject to, the same terms and conditions as immediately
          prior to the Effective Time, except that (i) each Series C Warrant
          will be exercisable for that number of whole shares of Parent Common
          Stock equal to the product of the number of shares of Company Series C
          Preferred Stock that were issuable upon exercise of such Series C
          Warrant immediately prior to the Effective Time multiplied by the
          Series C Preferred Exchange Ratio, rounded down to the nearest whole
          number of shares of Parent Common Stock, and (ii) the per share
          exercise price for the shares of Parent Common Stock issuable upon
          exercise of such assumed Series C Warrant will be equal to the
          quotient determined by dividing the exercise price per share of

Time, Parent shall make available to the Exchange Agent for exchange in
accordance with this Article 1 the shares of Parent Common Stock issuable
pursuant to Section 1.06 (the "Merger Shares") in exchange for all the
outstanding shares of Company Preferred Stock or Company Common Stock; provided,
however, that, pursuant to Section 8.02 hereof, Parent shall deposit into an
escrow account and not issue to the Stockholders that number of Merger Shares
equal to ten percent (10%) of the shares which each Stockholder is entitled to
receive pursuant to Section 1.06, rounded to the nearest whole share, issued to
the Escrow Agent (as defined in Article 8) on behalf of the Stockholders
pursuant to Section 1.06(b) (the "Escrow Amount").

           (c) Exchange Procedures. On the Closing Date, the Stockholders will
surrender the certificates representing their Company Preferred Stock or Company
Common Stock (the "Company Certificates") to the Company, Parent or the Exchange
Agent, as may be requested by Parent, for cancellation together with a letter of
transmittal in such form and having such provisions as Parent may reasonably
request. Upon surrender of a Company Certificate for cancellation to such agent
or agents as may be appointed by Parent, together with such letter of
transmittal, duly completed and validly executed in accordance with the
instructions thereto, Parent will promptly cause the Exchange Agent to deliver
to the holder of such Company Certificate in exchange therefor a certificate
representing the number of whole shares of Parent Common Stock (less the number
of shares of Parent Common Stock to be deposited in the Escrow Fund on such
holder's behalf pursuant to Section 1.08(b) and Article 8) to which such
Stockholder is entitled pursuant to Section 1.06, and the Company Certificate so
surrendered shall forthwith be canceled. Until so surrendered, each outstanding
Company Certificate that, prior to the Effective Time, represented shares of
Company Preferred Stock or Company Common Stock will be deemed from and after
the Effective Time, for all corporate purposes, other than the payment of
dividends, to evidence only the right to receive the number of full shares of
Parent Common Stock into which such shares of Company Preferred Stock or Company
Common Stock shall have been converted pursuant to this Article 1 and subject to
Article 8. As soon as practicable after the Effective Time, and subject to and
in accordance with the provisions of Article 8 hereof, Parent shall cause to be
distributed to the Escrow Agent a certificate or certificates representing that
number of shares of Parent Common Stock equal to the Escrow Amount, which shall
be registered in the name of the Escrow Agent. All shares held in the Escrow
Fund shall be beneficially owned by the holder on whose behalf such shares were
deposited in the Escrow Fund and shall be available to compensate Parent as
provided in Article 8.

           (d) Distributions with Respect to Unexchanged Shares. No dividends or
other distributions declared or made after the Effective Time with respect to
Parent Common Stock with a record date after the Effective Time will be paid to
any holder of any unsurrendered Company Certificate with respect to the shares
of Parent Common Stock represented thereby until the holder of record of such
Company Certificate shall surrender such Company Certificate. Subject to
applicable law, following surrender of any such Company Certificate, there shall
be paid to the record holder of the certificates representing whole shares of
Parent Common Stock issued in exchange therefor, without interest, at the time
of such surrender, the amount of dividends or other distributions with a record
date after the Effective Time theretofore paid with respect to such whole shares
of Parent Common Stock.

           (e) Transfers of Ownership. If any certificate for shares of Parent
Common Stock is to be issued in a name other than that in which the Company
Certificate surrendered in exchange therefor is registered, it will be a
condition to the issuance thereof that the Company Certificate so surrendered
will be properly endorsed and otherwise in proper form for transfer and that the
person requesting such exchange will have paid to Parent or any agent designated
by it any transfer or other taxes required by reason of the issuance of a
certificate for shares of Parent Common Stock in any name other than that of the
registered holder of the Company Certificate surrendered, or established to the
satisfaction of Parent or any agent designated by it that such tax has been paid
or is not payable.

           (f) Lost, Stolen or Destroyed Company Certificates. In the event any
Company Certificates shall have been lost, stolen or destroyed, the Exchange
Agent shall issue in exchange for such lost, stolen or destroyed Company
Certificates, upon the making of an affidavit of that fact by the holder
thereof, the number of shares of Parent Common Stock, if any, as may be required
pursuant to Section 1.06; provided, however, that Parent may, in its discretion
and as a condition precedent to the issuance thereof, require the owner of such
lost, stolen or destroyed Company Certificates to deliver a bond in such sum as
it may reasonably direct as indemnity against any claim that may be made against
Parent or the Exchange Agent with respect to the certificates alleged to have
been lost, stolen or destroyed.

           (g) No Liability. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this
Section 1.08, none of the Exchange Agent, the Surviving Corporation or any party
hereto shall be liable to a holder of shares of Parent Common Stock, Company
Preferred Stock or Company Common Stock for any amount properly paid to a public
official pursuant to any applicable abandoned property, escheat or similar law.

           SECTION 1.09. No Further Ownership Rights in Company Preferred Stock
or Company Common Stock. At the Effective Time, all shares of Parent Common


                                       10

<PAGE>


Stock issued in accordance with the terms hereof shall be deemed to be full
satisfaction of all rights pertaining to such shares of Company Preferred Stock
or Company Common Stock, and there shall be no further registration of transfers
on the records of the Surviving Corporation of shares of Company Preferred Stock
or Company Common Stock that were outstanding immediately prior to the Effective
Time. If, after the Effective Time, Company Certificates are presented to the
Surviving Corporation for any reason, they shall be canceled and exchanged as
provided in this Article 1.

canceled.

parties hereto that (i) this Agreement shall constitute a plan of reorganization
within the meaning of Treasury Regulations Section 1.368-2(g), (ii) the Merger
shall constitute a reorganization within the meaning of Section 368 of the Code
and (iii) the Merger shall qualify for accounting treatment as a pooling of
interests if the Closing Date shall be May 31, 2000 or earlier. Each party has
consulted with, and is relying exclusively upon, its own tax advisors and
accountants with respect to the tax and accounting consequences, respectively,
of the Merger.

           SECTION 1.12. Taking of Necessary Action; Further Action. If, at any
time after the Effective Time, any further action is necessary or desirable to
carry out the purposes of this Agreement and to vest the Surviving Corporation

privileges, powers and franchises of the Company and Sub, the officers and
directors of the Company, Parent and Sub are fully authorized in the name of

"Conflict") (i) any provision of the Certificate of Incorporation or Bylaws of
the Company, (ii) any mortgage, indenture, lease, contract or other agreement or
instrument, permit, concession, franchise or license to which the Company or any

adverse effect on the business, assets (including intangible assets), financial
conditions or results of operations of the Company.

           SECTION 3.06. Consents. No consent, waiver, approval, order or
authorization of, or registration, declaration or filing with, any court,

the five months then ended (the "Unaudited Financials"). The Audited Financials
and the Unaudited Financials have been prepared in accordance with GAAP, applied
on a basis consistent throughout the periods indicated and consistent with each

2000 shall be hereinafter referred to as the "Current Balance Sheet."

           SECTION 3.08. No Undisclosed Liabilities. The Company has no

has not been reflected in the Current Balance Sheet or the notes thereto, or
(ii) has not arisen in the ordinary course of business consistent with past
practices since March 31, 2000 and been disclosed to Parent in Section 3.08 of
the Company Disclosure Schedule other than liabilities, indebtedness,

(a) through (m) (other than negotiations with Parent and its representatives
regarding the transactions contemplated by this Agreement).

           SECTION 3.10. Taxes. (a) The Company and each affiliated group
(within the meaning of Section 1504 of the Code) of which the Company is or has
been a member, has timely filed (or has had timely filed on its behalf) or will
file or cause to be timely filed all Tax Returns required by applicable law to
be filed by it prior to or as of the date hereof, and all such Tax Returns are,
or will be at the time of filing, true and complete in all material respects.

            (b) As of the date hereof, the Company has paid (or has had paid on
its behalf), or, where payment is not yet due, has established (or has had
established on its behalf and for its sole benefit and recourse) in accordance
with GAAP, an adequate accrual for the payment of all taxes due with respect to
any period ending prior to or as of the Effective Time.

            (c) Neither the Company nor any member of any affiliated,
consolidated, combined or unitary group of which the Company is or has been a
member has granted any extension or waiver of the statute of limitations period
applicable to any Return, which period (after giving effect to such extension or
waiver) has not yet expired.

            (d) There are no Liens or encumbrances for Taxes on any of the
assets of Company other than Liens or encumbrances for Taxes not yet due and
payable.

           (e) The Company has complied in all material respects with all
applicable laws, rules and regulations relating to the payment and withholding
of Taxes.

            (f) To the Company's knowledge, as of the date hereof, no federal,
state, local or foreign audits or administrative proceedings are pending with
regard to any Taxes or Tax Return of Company, nor has the Company received a
written notice of any proposed audit or proceeding regarding any pending audit
or proceeding.

            (g) "Taxes" shall mean any and all taxes, charges, fees, levies or
other assessments, including income, gross receipts, excise, real or personal
property, sales, withholding, social security, retirement, unemployment,
occupation, use, goods and services, service use, license, value added, capital,
net worth, payroll, profits, withholding, franchise, transfer and recording
taxes, fees and charges, and any other taxes, assessment or similar charges
imposed by the IRS or any taxing authority (whether domestic or foreign
including any state, county, local or foreign government or any subdivision or
taxing agency thereof (including a United States possession)) (a "Taxing
Authority"), whether computed on a separate, consolidated, unitary, combined or
any other basis; and such term shall

                                       21

<PAGE>


include any interest whether paid or received, fines, penalties or additional
amounts attributable to, or imposed upon, or with respect to, any such taxes,
charges, fees, levies or other assessments. "Tax Return" shall mean any report,
return, document, declaration or other information or filing required to be
supplied to any taxing authority or jurisdiction (foreign or domestic) with
respect to Taxes, including information returns, any documents with respect to
or accompanying payments of estimated Taxes, or with respect to or accompanying
requests for the extension of time in which to file any such report, return,
document, declaration or other information.

           SECTION 3.11. Employee Benefit Plans. (a) The Company has provided
Parent with a list and copies of the Employee Plans (and, if applicable, related
trust agreements) and all amendments thereto and written interpretations thereof
together with the three most recent annual reports (Form 5500 including, if
applicable, Schedule B thereto) and the most recent actuarial valuation report
prepared in connection with any Employee Plan. Such list identifies each
Employee Plan that is (i) a Multiemployer Plan, (ii) a Title IV Plan or (iii)
maintained in connection with any trust described in Section 501(c)(9) of the
Code. The Company has provided Parent with complete age, salary, service and
related data as of March 31, 2000 for all employees and former employees covered
under any Title IV Plan.

            (b) As of March 31, 2000, the fair market value of the assets of
each Title IV Plan (excluding for these purposes any accrued but unpaid
contributions) exceeded the present value of all benefits accrued under such
Title IV Plan determined on a termination basis using the assumptions
established by the PBGC as in effect on such date. As of March 31, 2000, the
aggregate unfunded liability of the Company in respect of all Employee Plans or
Benefit Arrangements described under Sections 4(b)(5) or 401(a)(1) of ERISA,
computed using reasonable actuarial assumptions and determined as if all
benefits under such plans were vested and payable as of such date, did not
exceed $50,000.

            (c) To the Company's knowledge, no transaction prohibited by Section
406 of ERISA or Section 4975 of the Code has occurred with respect to any
employee benefit plan or arrangement that is covered by Title I of ERISA, which
transaction has or will cause the Company to incur any liability under ERISA,
the Code or otherwise, excluding transactions effected pursuant to and in
compliance with a statutory or administrative exemption. No "accumulated funding
deficiency," as defined in Section 412 of the Code, has been incurred with
respect to any Employee Plan subject to such Section 412, whether or not waived.
No "reportable event," within the meaning of Section 4043 of ERISA, other than a
"reportable event" that will not have a Material Adverse Effect on the Company,
and no event described in Section 4062 or 4063 of ERISA, has occurred in
connection with any Employee Plan. Neither the Company nor any ERISA Affiliate
of the Company has (i) engaged in, or is a successor or parent

                                       22

<PAGE>


corporation to an entity that has engaged in, a transaction described in
Sections 4069 or 4212(c) of ERISA or (ii) incurred, or reasonably expects to
incur prior to the Effective Time, (A) any liability under Title IV of ERISA
arising in connection with the termination of, or a complete or partial
withdrawal from, any plan covered or previously covered by Title IV of ERISA or
(B) any liability under Section 4971 of the Code that in either case could
become a liability of the Company, Parent or any of their ERISA Affiliates after
the Effective Time. No condition exists that (i) could constitute grounds for
termination by the PBGC of any employee benefit plan that is subject to Title IV
of ERISA and that is maintained by the Company or any of its ERISA Affiliates or
(ii) presents a material risk of complete or partial withdrawal from any
multiemployer plan, as defined in Section 3(37) of ERISA, which could result in
the Company, Parent or any ERISA Affiliate of any of them incurring a withdrawal
liability within the meaning of Section 4201 of ERISA. The assets of the Company
are not now, nor will they after the passage of time be, subject to any lien
imposed under Code Section 412(n) by reason of a failure of any of the Company
to make timely installments or other payments required under Code Section 412.
If a "complete withdrawal" by the Company and all of its ERISA Affiliates were
to occur as of the Effective Time with respect to all Multiemployer Plans, none
of the Company or any of its ERISA Affiliates would incur any material
withdrawal liability under Title IV of ERISA.

            (d) Each Employee Plan that is intended to be qualified under
Section 401(a) of the Code is so qualified and has been so qualified during the
period since its adoption; each trust created under any such Plan is exempt from
tax under Section 501(a) of the Code and has been so exempt since its creation.
The Company has provided Parent with the most recent determination letter of the
Internal Revenue Service relating to each such Employee Plan. Each Employee Plan
has been maintained in substantial compliance with its terms and with the
requirements prescribed by any and all applicable statutes, orders, rules and
regulations, including but not limited to ERISA and the Code.

            (e) The Company has provided Parent with a list and copies or
descriptions of each Benefit Arrangement (and, if applicable, related trust
agreements) and all amendments thereto and written interpretations thereof. Each
Benefit Arrangement has been maintained in substantial compliance with its terms
and with the requirements prescribed by any and all applicable statutes, orders,
rules and regulations and has been maintained in good standing with applicable
regulatory authorities.

            (f) The Company has no current or projected liability in respect of
post-employment or post-retirement health or medical or life insurance benefits
for retired, former or current employees of the Company, except as required to
avoid excise tax under Section 4980B of the Code. No condition exists that would
prevent the Company from amending or terminating any Employee Plan or

                                       23

<PAGE>


Benefit Arrangement providing health or medical benefits in respect of any
active employee of the Company other than limitations imposed under the terms of
a collective bargaining agreement.

            (g) All contributions and payments accrued under each Employee Plan
and Benefit Arrangement, determined in accordance with prior funding and accrual
practices, will be discharged and paid or accrued on or prior to the Effective
Time. There has been no amendment to, written interpretation of or announcement
(whether or not written) by the Company relating to, or change in employee
participation or coverage under, any Employee Plan or Benefit Arrangement that
would increase materially the expense of maintaining such Employee Plan or
Benefit Arrangement above the level of the expense incurred in respect thereof
for the most recent fiscal year ended prior to the date hereof.

            (h) The Company is not a party to any contract, plan or arrangement
(written or otherwise) covering any employee or former employee of the Company
that, individually or collectively, could give rise to the payment of any amount
that would not be deductible pursuant to the terms of Section 280G of the Code.

            (i) There has been no failure of a group health plan (as defined in
Section 5000(b)(1) of the Code) to meet the requirements of Code Section
4980B(f) with respect to a qualified beneficiary (as defined in Section
4980B(g)). The Company has not contributed to a nonconforming group health plan
(as defined in Section 5000(c)) and no ERISA Affiliate of the Company has
incurred a tax under Section 5000(a) that is or could become a liability of the
Company.

            (j) The Company has provided Parent with a list and copies of each
International Plan. Each International Plan has been maintained in substantial
compliance with its terms and with the requirements prescribed by any and all
applicable statutes, orders, rules and regulations (including any special
provisions relating to qualified plans where such Plan was intended so to
qualify) and has been maintained in good standing with applicable regulatory
authorities. There has been no amendment to, written interpretation of or
announcement (whether or not written) by the Company relating to, or change in
employee participation or coverage under, any International Plan that would
increase materially the expense of maintaining such International Plan above the
level of expense incurred in respect thereof for the most recent fiscal year
ended prior to the date hereof. According to the actuarial assumptions and
valuations most recently used for the purpose of funding each International Plan
(or, if the same has no such assumptions and valuations or is unfunded,
according to actuarial assumptions and valuations in use by the PBGC on the date
hereof), as of March 31, 2000 the total amount or value of the funds available
under such Plan to pay benefits accrued thereunder or segregated in respect of
such accrued benefits, together with any reserve or accrual with respect
thereto, exceeded the present value of all benefits (actual or contingent)
accrued as of such date of all participants and past


                                       24

<PAGE>


participants therein in respect of which the Company has or would have after the
Effective Time any obligation. From and after the Effective Time, Parent and its
Affiliates will get the full benefit of any such funds, accruals or reserves.

            (k) No employee or former employee of the Company will become
entitled to any bonus, retirement, severance, job security or similar benefit or
enhanced such benefit (including acceleration of vesting or exercise of an
incentive award) as a result of the transactions contemplated hereby.

           SECTION 3.12.  Environmental Matters.  (a) Except as could not
reasonably be expected to have, individually or in the aggregate, a Material
Adverse Effect on the Company:

               (i) no notice, notification, demand, request for information,
          citation, summons or order has been received, no complaint has been
          filed, no penalty has been assessed, and no investigation, action,
          claim, suit, proceeding or review (or any basis therefor) is pending
          or, to the knowledge of the Company, is threatened by any governmental
          entity or other Person relating to or arising out of any Environmental
          Law;

               (ii) the Company is and has been in compliance with all
          Environmental Laws and all Environmental Permits; and

               (iii) there are no liabilities of or relating to the Company of
          any kind whatsoever, whether accrued, contingent, absolute,
          determined, determinable or otherwise arising under or relating to any
          Environmental Law and there are no facts, conditions, situations or
          set of circumstances that could reasonably be expected to result in or
          be the basis for any such liability.

           (b) There has been no environmental investigation, study, audit,
test, review or other analysis conducted of which the Company has knowledge in
relation to the current or prior business of the Company or any property or
facility now or previously owned or leased by the Company that has not been
delivered to Parent at least five days prior to the date hereof.

           (c) The Company does not own, lease or operate nor has it owned,
leased or operated any real property. The Company does not conduct nor has it
ever conducted any operations, in New Jersey or Connecticut.

            (d) For purposes of this Section 4.19, the term "Company" shall
include any entity that is, in whole or in part, a predecessor of the Company.

           SECTION 3.13. Restrictions on Business Activities. There is no
judgment, injunction, order or decree to which the Company is a party or
otherwise binding


                                       25

<PAGE>


upon the Company that has had or reasonably could be expected to have the effect
of prohibiting or impairing any business practice of the Company, any
acquisition of property (tangible or intangible) by the Company or the conduct
of business by the Company. Without limiting the foregoing, the Company is not
subject to any agreement under which the Company is restricted from selling,
licensing or otherwise distributing any of its technology or products to or
providing services to, customers or potential customers or any class of
customers, in any geographic area, during any period of time or in any segment
of the market.

           SECTION 3.14. Title of Properties; Absence of Liens and Encumbrances;
Condition of Equipment.

           (a) The Company does not own any real property, and has never owned
any real property. Section 3.14(a) of the Company Disclosure Schedule sets forth
a list of all real property currently leased by the Company, the name of the
lessor, the date of the lease and each amendment thereto and, with respect to
any current lease, the aggregate annual rental and/or other fees payable under
any such lease and the term and renewal provisions of such lease. All such
leases are in full force and effect and enforceable by the Company, and there is
not, under any of such leases, any existing default by the Company or, to the
knowledge of the Company, by the other party thereto or event of default (or
event which with notice or lapse of time, or both, would constitute such a
default).

           (b) The Company has good and valid title to, or, in the case of
leased properties and assets, valid leasehold interests in, all of its tangible
properties and assets, real, personal and mixed, used or held for use in its
business, free and clear of any Liens, except as reflected in the Current
Balance Sheet and except for Liens for Taxes not yet due and payable, municipal
and zoning ordinances, easements for public utilities and such imperfections of
title and encumbrances, if any, which are not material in character, amount or
extent, and which do not materially detract from the value, or interfere with
the present use, of the property subject thereto or affected thereby.

           (c) Section 3.14(c) of the Company Disclosure Schedule lists all
material items of equipment (the "Equipment") owned or leased by the Company and

Directors of the Company determines in good faith by a majority vote, on the
basis of advice from Cooley Godward LLP, outside legal counsel to the Company,
or any other nationally-recognized law firm reasonably acceptable to Parent,
that it must take such action to comply with its fiduciary duties under
applicable law.

           (c) The Board of Directors of the Company shall not take any of the
actions referred to in clauses (i) through (iv) of the preceding subsection
unless the Company shall have delivered to Parent a prior written notice

Party (or its agents or advisors) in possession of confidential information

destroy all such information.

           "Superior Proposal" means any bona fide, unsolicited written
Acquisition Proposal for at least a majority of the outstanding voting
securities of the Company or substantially all of assets of the Company on terms
that the Board of Directors of the Company determines in good faith by a
majority vote, on the basis of the advice of a financial advisor of nationally
recognized reputation and taking into account all the terms and conditions of
the Acquisition Proposal, including any break-up fees, expense reimbursement
provisions and conditions to consummation, are more favorable and provide
greater value to the Company's stockholders than as provided hereunder and for
which financing, to the extent required, is then fully committed or reasonably
determined to be available by the Board of Directors of the Company.

injunctions or other impediments or delays, legal or otherwise, in order to
consummate and make effective the transactions contemplated by this Agreement
for the purpose of securing to the parties hereto the benefits contemplated by

any divestiture by Parent or the Company or any of Parent's subsidiaries or
Affiliates of shares of capital stock or of any business, assets or property of
Parent or its subsidiaries or Affiliates or of the Company, its Affiliates, or

           SECTION 6.07. Notification of Certain Matters. Any party shall give
prompt notice to the other parties hereto of (i) the occurrence or
non-occurrence of


                                       43

<PAGE>


any event, the occurrence or non-occurrence of which is likely to cause any
representation or warranty of such party contained in this Agreement to be
untrue or inaccurate at or prior to the Effective Time and (ii) any failure of
such party to comply with or satisfy any covenant, condition or agreement to be
complied with or satisfied by it hereunder; provided, however, that the delivery

misrepresentations, breach of warranty or breach of covenant.

           SECTION 6.08. Affiliate Agreements. Section 6.08 of the Company
Disclosure Schedule sets forth those persons who, in the Company's reasonable
judgment, are or may be Affiliates of the Company. The Company shall provide
Parent with such information and documents as Parent reasonably requests for
purposes or reviewing such list. The Company shall use its best efforts to
deliver or cause to be delivered to Parent, concurrently with the execution of
this Agreement (and in any case prior to the Closing Date) from each of the
Affiliates of the Company, an executed Affiliate Agreement in the form attached
hereto as Exhibit B (provided that the covenants in such Affiliate Agreement
relating to pooling of interests will not be required if (i) Parent and the
Company agree that the Merger will not be accounted for as a pooling of
interests or (ii) the Closing Date shall be after May 31, 2000). Parent shall be
entitled to place appropriate legends on the certificates evidencing any Parent

necessary or desirable for effecting completely the consummation of this
Agreement and the transactions contemplated hereby.

           SECTION 6.10. Tax-free Reorganization. The parties intend to adopt
this Agreement and the Merger as a plan of reorganization under Section 368 of
the Code. The parties shall not take a position on any tax return inconsistent
with this Section 6.10. From and after the Effective Time, neither Parent, Sub
nor the Company shall take any action that could reasonably be expected to cause
the Merger not to be treated as a reorganization within the meaning of Section
368 of the Code.

           SECTION 6.11.  Pooling Accounting.  Parent and the Company shall each
use their best efforts to cause the business combination to be effected by the

                                       44

<PAGE>


Company shall use their best efforts to cause its Affiliates not to take any
action that would adversely affect the ability of Parent to account for the
business combination to be effected by the Merger as a pooling of interests;

accounted for as a pooling of interests, or (ii) the Closing Date shall be after
May 31, 2000.

           SECTION 6.12. Nasdaq National Market Listing. Parent agrees to file
with the Nasdaq National Market prior to the Effective Time a Notification of
Listing of Additional Shares with respect to the shares of Parent Common Stock
issuable or reserved for issuance, in connection with the Merger.

           SECTION 6.13. Offers of Employment; Employee Benefits. Following the
Closing Date, Parent shall continue to employ the employees of the Company
identified in Section 3.24 of the Company Disclosure Schedule with the salaries,
bonus plans and employee benefits as mutually agreed between Parent and Company.

           SECTION 6.14. Stock Options. Pursuant to Section 1.06(d) hereof, at
the Effective Time, each outstanding Company Stock Option under the Option Plan,
whether or not exercisable, will be assumed by Parent and substituted with an
option to acquire Parent Common Stock. After the Effective Time, Parent will
issue to each holder of an outstanding Company Stock Option a notice describing
the assumption and substitution of such Company Stock Option by Parent. It is
intended that Company Stock Options assumed by Parent shall qualify following
the Effective Time as incentive stock options as defined in Section 422 of the
Code to the extent such Company Stock Options qualified as incentive stock
options immediately prior to the Effective Time and the provisions of this
Section 6.14 shall be applied consistent with such intent. Parent will reserve
sufficient shares of Parent Common Stock for issuance under Section 1.06(d)
hereof.

           SECTION 6.15. Form S-8. Parent agrees to file a registration
statement on Form S-8 for the shares of Parent Common Stock issuable with
respect to assumed Company Stock Options no later than thirty (30) business days
after the Closing Date and shall not withdraw such Registration Statement.

           SECTION 6.16.  Indemnification of Directors and Officers.

           (a) For a period of six years from the Closing Date, Parent shall,
and shall cause the Surviving Corporation to, fulfill and honor in all respects

officers of the Company, as provided in the Company's Articles of Incorporation
and Bylaws and as otherwise existing on the date of this Agreement in favor of
such directors and officers.

<PAGE>


           (b) Parent agrees to pay all expenses, including attorneys' fees,
which may be incurred by any director or officer of the Company in enforcing the
indemnity and other obligations provided for in this Section 6.16.

           (c) This Section 6.16 shall survive the consummation of the
transactions contemplated hereby, is intended to benefit and may be enforced by
the directors and officers of the Company, and shall be binding on all
successors and assigns of Parent and the Company.

           SECTION 6.17. California Permit; Registered Offering. (a) As promptly
as practicable after the execution of this Agreement, Parent shall prepare the
necessary documents and apply to obtain a California Permit so that the issuance
of the Parent Common Stock in the Merger shall be exempt from registration under
the Securities Act of 1933, as amended (together with the rules and regulations
promulgated thereunder, the "Securities Act"), by virtue of the exemption from
registration contained in Section 3(a)(10) thereof. The Company shall cooperate
with, and provide information to, Parent in connection with Parent's application
for the California Permit. The Company and Parent will respond to any comments
from the California Commissioner of Corporations and use their commercially
reasonable efforts to have the California Permit granted as soon as practicable
after such filing. None of the information supplied by the Company to Parent in
connection with the California Permit application or any other document prepared
to comply with federal or state securities laws shall contain any untrue
statement of a material fact or omit to state any material fact necessary in
order to make the statements contained therein, in the light of the
circumstances under which they were made, not misleading.

           (b) In the event that a California Permit cannot be issued for any
reason, then the parties hereto shall take all action necessary to permit the
delivery of Parent Common Stock pursuant to the Merger to be accomplished by
means of registration of such Parent Common Stock on a Registration Statement on
Form S-4 (or another appropriate form) (the "Registration Statement") under the
Securities Act. Promptly after being notified by the California Commissioner of
Corporations that a California Permit cannot be issued, Parent shall promptly
prepare and file with the SEC the Registration Statement and shall use its best
efforts to cause the Registration Statement to be declared effective by the SEC
as promptly as practicable thereafter. The Company shall cooperate with, and
provide information to, Parent in connection with the preparation and seeking of
effectiveness of the Registration Statement.

           SECTION 6.18. HSR Act. Parent and the Company shall file as soon as
practicable after the date of this Agreement notifications under the HSR Act (if
necessary) or any other filing required by antitrust authorities and shall
respond as promptly as practicable to all inquiries or requests received from
the Federal Trade Commission or the Antitrust Division of the Department of
Justice for


                                       46

                                    ARTICLE 8
           SURVIVAL OF REPRESENTATIONS AND WARRANTIES; INDEMNIFICATION

           SECTION 8.01. Survival of Representations and Warranties. All of the
Company's representations and warranties in this Agreement, as modified by the
Company Disclosure Schedule delivered on the date of this Agreement or in any
instrument delivered pursuant to this Agreement shall survive the Merger and
continue until the earlier of the date which is ten days following delivery to
Parent of the auditor's report for the first audit of Parent's financial
statements after the Closing Date or the date which is one year following the
Closing Date (the "Expiration Date"). All of Parent's and Sub's representations
and warranties contained herein or in any instrument delivered pursuant to this
Agreement shall terminate at the Closing.

           SECTION 8.02.  Escrow Arrangements.

           (a) Escrow Fund. As security for the indemnity provided for in this
Section 8.02 and by virtue of this Agreement, the Stockholders will be deemed to
have received and deposited with the Escrow Agent (as defined below) the Escrow
Amount (plus any additional shares as may be issued upon any stock split, stock
dividend or recapitalization effected by Parent after the Effective Time with
respect to the Escrow Amount) without any act of any Stockholder. As soon as
practicable after the Effective Time, the Escrow Amount, without any act of any
Stockholder, will be deposited with U.S. Bank Trust, National Association (or
other institution acceptable to Parent and the Stockholder Representative (as
defined in Section 8.03)) as Escrow Agent (the "Escrow Agent"), such deposit to
constitute an escrow fund (the "Escrow Fund") to be governed by the terms set
forth herein. The Escrow Agent may execute this Agreement following the date
hereof and prior to the Effective Time, and such later execution, if so executed
after the date hereof, shall not affect the binding nature of this Agreement as
of the date hereof between the other signatories hereto. The portion of the
Escrow Amount contributed on behalf of each Stockholder shall be in proportion
to the aggregate Parent Common Stock to which such holder would otherwise be
entitled under Section 1.06. The Stockholders shall indemnify and hold Parent
and its officers, directors and affiliates (the "Indemnified Parties") harmless
against all claims, losses, liabilities, damages, deficiencies, costs and
expenses, including reasonable attorneys' fees and expenses of investigation
(hereinafter individually a "Loss" and collectively "Losses") incurred by
Parent, its officers, directors, or affiliates (including the Surviving
Corporation) directly or indirectly


                                       51

<PAGE>


as a result of (i) any inaccuracy or breach of a representation or warranty of
the Company contained in this Agreement, (ii) any failure by the Company to
perform or comply with any covenant contained in this Agreement, or (iii) any
action, suit or proceeding which is pending or threatened against the Company as
of the Effective Time. No Stockholder shall have any right to contribution from
the Company for any claim made by Parent after the Effective Time.

           (b) Limitation on Liability. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the
Stockholders shall not be obligated to indemnify Parent, or any of its officers,
directors and affiliates, pursuant to this Section 8.02 unless and until the
amount of all Losses incurred by Parent, and its officers, directors and
affiliates taken as a group, exceeds $1,000,000 in the aggregate, in which event
the Stockholders shall indemnify, pursuant to this Section 8.02 and subject to
the limitation set forth in the following sentence, Parent, and its officers,
directors and affiliates, for all Losses incurred by them in the aggregate to
the extent they exceed $1,000,000. Parent and the Company hereby agree that
Parent's sole and exclusive recourse against the Company and the Stockholders
for any Loss or claim of Losses arising out of or relating to this Agreement
shall be expressly limited to the Escrow Fund and in accordance with the
indemnification provisions of this Article 8.

           (c) Escrow Period; Distribution upon Termination of Escrow Period.
Subject to the following requirements, the Escrow Fund shall be in existence
immediately following the Effective Time and shall terminate at 5:00 p.m.,
P.S.T. on the Expiration Date (the "Escrow Period"); provided, however, that the
Escrow Period shall not terminate with respect to any amount which, in
reasonable judgement of Parent, subject to the objection of the Stockholder
Representative and the subsequent arbitration of the matter in the manner
provided in Section 8.02(g) hereof, is necessary to satisfy any unsatisfied
claims specified in any Officer's Certificate (as defined in paragraph (d)
below) delivered to the Escrow Agent prior to termination of such Escrow Period
with respect to facts and circumstances existing prior to the termination of
such Escrow Period. As soon as all such claims have been resolved, the Escrow
Agent shall deliver to the Stockholders the remaining portion of the Escrow Fund
not required to satisfy such claims. Deliveries of Escrow Amounts to the
Stockholders pursuant to this Section 8.02(c) shall be made in proportion to
their respective original contributions to the Escrow Fund.

           (d) Protection of Escrow Fund.

               (i) The Escrow Agent shall hold and safeguard the Escrow Fund
          during the Escrow Period, shall treat such fund as a trust fund in
          accordance with the terms of this Agreement and not as the property of
          Parent and shall hold and dispose of the Escrow Fund only in
          accordance with the terms hereof.


                                       52

<PAGE>


               (ii) Any shares of Parent Common Stock or other equity securities
          issued or distributed by Parent (including shares issued upon a stock
          split) ("New Shares") in respect of Parent Common Stock in the Escrow
          Fund which have not been released from the Escrow Fund shall be added
          to the Escrow Fund and become a part thereof. New Shares issued in
          respect of shares of Parent Common Stock which have been released from
          the Escrow Fund shall not be added to the Escrow Fund but shall be
          distributed to the record holders thereof. Cash dividends on Parent
          Common Stock shall not be added to the Escrow Fund but shall be
          distributed to the record holders thereof.

               (iii) Each Stockholder shall have voting rights with respect to
          the shares of Parent Common Stock contributed to the Escrow Fund by
          such Stockholder (and on any voting securities added to the Escrow
          Fund in respect of such shares of Parent Common Stock). As the record
          holder of such shares, the Escrow Agent shall vote such shares in
          accordance with the instructions of the Stockholders having the
          beneficial interest therein and shall promptly deliver copies of all
          proxy solicitation materials to such Stockholders.

           (e) Claims Upon Escrow Fund.

               (i) Subject to subsection (e) below, thirty (30) days after the
          Escrow Agent has received, provided such receipt is on or before the
          Expiration Date, a certificate signed by any officer of Parent (an
          "Officer's Certificate") (A) stating that Parent has paid or properly
          accrued or reasonably anticipates that it will have to pay or accrue
          Losses, and (B) specifying in reasonable detail the individual items
          of Losses included in the amount so stated, the date each such item
          was paid or properly accrued, or the basis for such anticipated
          liability, and the nature of the misrepresentation, breach of warranty
          or covenant to which such item is related, the Escrow Agent shall,
          subject to the provisions of Section 8.02(f) hereof, deliver to Parent
          out of the Escrow Fund, as promptly as practicable, shares of Parent
          Common Stock held in the Escrow Fund with a value equal to such
          Losses.

               (ii) For the purposes of determining the number of shares of
          Parent Common Stock to be delivered to Parent out of the Escrow Fund
          as indemnity pursuant to Section 8.02(e)(i) hereof, the shares of
          Parent Common Stock shall be valued at the Average Price, which the
          parties shall certify to the Escrow Agent in writing.

           (f) Objections to Claims. At the time of delivery of any Officer's
Certificate to the Escrow Agent, a duplicate copy of such certificate shall be
delivered to the Stockholder Representative, and for a period of thirty (30)
days


                                       53

<PAGE>


after such delivery, the Escrow Agent shall make no delivery to Parent of any
Escrow Amounts pursuant to Section 8.02(e) hereof unless the Escrow Agent shall
have received written authorization from the Stockholder Representative to make
such delivery. After the expiration of such thirty (30) day period, the Escrow
Agent shall make delivery of shares of Parent Common Stock from the Escrow Fund
in accordance with Section 8.02(e) hereof; provided, however, that no such
payment or delivery may be made if the Stockholder Representative shall object
in a written statement to the claim made in the Officer's Certificate, and such
statement shall have been delivered to the Escrow Agent prior to the expiration
of such thirty (30) day period, with a copy of such objection to be
simultaneously transmitted to Parent.

           (g) Resolution of Conflicts; Arbitration.

               (i) In case the Stockholder Representative shall object in
          writing to any claim or claims made in any Officer's Certificate, such
          Stockholder Representative and Parent shall attempt in good faith to
          agree upon the rights of the respective parties with respect to each
          of such claims. If such Stockholder Representative and Parent should
          so agree, a memorandum setting forth such agreement shall be prepared
          and signed by both parties and shall be furnished to the Escrow Agent.
          The Escrow Agent shall be entitled to rely on any such memorandum and
          distribute shares of Parent Common Stock from the Escrow Fund in
          accordance with the terms thereof.

               (ii) If no such agreement can be reached after good faith
          negotiation, either Parent or the Stockholder Representative may
          demand arbitration of the matter unless the amount of the damage or
          Loss is at issue in pending litigation with a third party, in which
          event arbitration shall not be commenced until such amount is
          ascertained or both parties agree to arbitration; and in either such
          event the matter shall be settled by arbitration conducted by one
          arbitrator mutually agreeable to Parent and such Stockholder
          Representative. In the event that within forty-five (45) days after
          submission of any dispute to arbitration, Parent and such Stockholder
          Representative cannot mutually agree on one arbitrator, Parent and
          such Stockholder Representative shall each select one arbitrator, and
          the two arbitrators so selected shall select a third arbitrator. The
          arbitrator or arbitrators, as the case may be, shall set a limited
          time period and establish procedures designed to reduce the cost and
          time for discovery while allowing the parties an opportunity, adequate
          in the sole judgement of the arbitrator or majority of the
          arbitrators, as the case may be, to discover relevant information from
          the opposing parties about the subject matter of the dispute. The
          arbitrator or a majority of the arbitrators, as the case may be, shall
          rule upon motions to compel or limit discovery and shall have the
          authority to impose sanctions, including


                                       54

<PAGE>


          attorneys' fees and costs, to the same extent as a competent court of
          law or equity, should the arbitrators or a majority of the
          arbitrators, as the case may be, determine that discovery was sought
          without substantial justification or that discovery was refused or
          objected to without substantial justification. The decision of the
          arbitrator or a majority of the arbitrators, as the case may be, as to
          the validity and amount of any claim in such Officer's Certificate
          shall be binding and conclusive upon the parties to this Agreement.
          Such decision shall be written and shall be supported by written
          findings of fact and conclusions which shall set forth the award,
          judgment, decree or order awarded by the arbitrator(s).

               (iii) Judgment upon any award rendered by the arbitrator(s) may
          be entered in any court having jurisdiction. Any such arbitration
          shall be held in the County of Santa Clara, California, in accordance
          with the Commercial Arbitration Rules then in effect of the American
          Arbitration Association. The arbitrator(s) shall determine how all
          expenses relating to the arbitration shall be paid, including without
          limitation, the respective expenses of each party, the fees of each
          arbitrator and the administrative fee of the American Arbitration
          Association.

           (h) Third-Party Claims. In the event Parent becomes aware of a third-
party claim which Parent believes may result in a demand against the Escrow
Fund, Parent shall notify the Stockholder Representative of such claim, and the
Stockholders shall be entitled, at their expense, to participate in any defense
of such claim. Parent shall have the right in its sole discretion to settle any
such claim; provided, however, that except with the consent of the Stockholder
Representative, no settlement of any such claim with third-party claimants shall
be determinative of the amount of any claim against the Escrow Fund. In the
event that the Stockholder Representative has consented to any such settlement,
the Stockholders shall have no power or authority to object under any provision
of this Article 8 to the amount of any claim by Parent against the Escrow Fund
with respect to such settlement.

           (i) Escrow Agent's Duties.

               (i) The Escrow Agent shall be obligated only for the performance
          of such duties as are specifically set forth herein, and as set forth
          in any additional written escrow instructions which the Escrow Agent
          may receive after the date of this Agreement which are signed by an
          officer of Parent and the Stockholder Representative, and may rely and
          shall be protected in relying or refraining from acting on any
          instrument reasonably believed to be genuine and to have been signed
          or presented by the proper party or parties. The Escrow Agent shall
          not be liable for any act done or omitted hereunder as Escrow Agent
          while acting in good faith and in the exercise of reasonable judgment,
          and any act done or omitted


                                       55

<PAGE>


          pursuant to the advice of counsel shall be conclusive evidence of such
          good faith.

               (ii) The Escrow Agent is hereby expressly authorized to disregard
          any and all warnings given by any of the parties hereto or by any
          other person, excepting only orders or process of courts of law, and
          is hereby expressly authorized to comply with and obey orders,
          judgments or decrees of any court. In case the Escrow Agent obeys or
          complies with any such order, judgment or decree of any court, the
          Escrow Agent shall not be liable to any of the parties hereto or to
          any other person by reason of such compliance, notwithstanding any
          such order, judgment or decree being subsequently reversed, modified,
          annulled, set aside, vacated or found to have been entered without
          jurisdiction.

               (iii) The Escrow Agent shall not be liable in any respect on
          account of the identity, authority or rights of the parties executing
          or delivering or purporting to execute or deliver this Agreement or
          any documents or papers deposited or called for hereunder.

               (iv) The Escrow Agent shall not be liable for the expiration of
          any rights under any statute of limitations with respect to this
          Agreement or any documents deposited with the Escrow Agent.

               (v) In performing any duties under the Agreement, the Escrow
          Agent shall not be liable to any party for damages, losses, or
          expenses, except for negligence or willful misconduct on the part of
          the Escrow Agent. The Escrow Agent shall not incur any such liability
          for (A) any act or failure to act made or omitted in good faith, or
          (B) any action taken or omitted in reliance upon any instrument,
          including any written statement of affidavit provided for in this
          Agreement that the Escrow Agent shall in good faith believe to be
          genuine, nor will the Escrow Agent be liable or responsible for
          forgeries, fraud, impersonations, or determining the scope of any
          representative authority. In addition, the Escrow Agent may consult
          with legal counsel in connection with Escrow Agent's duties under this
          Agreement and shall be fully protected in any act taken, suffered, or
          permitted by him/her in good faith in accordance with the advice of
          counsel. The Escrow Agent is not responsible for determining and
          verifying the authority of any person acting or purporting to act on
          behalf of any party to this Agreement.

               (vi) If any controversy arises between the parties to this
          Agreement, or with any other party, concerning the subject matter of
          this Agreement, its terms or conditions, the Escrow Agent will not be
          required to determine the controversy or to take any action regarding
          it. The Escrow Agent may hold all documents and shares of Parent
          Common


                                       56

<PAGE>


          Stock and may wait for settlement of any such controversy by final
          appropriate legal proceedings or other means as, in the Escrow Agent's
          discretion, required, despite what may be set forth elsewhere in this
          Agreement. In such event, the Escrow Agent will not be liable for
          damages. Furthermore, the Escrow Agent may at its option, file an
          action of interpleader requiring the parties to answer and litigate
          any claims and rights among themselves. The Escrow Agent is authorized
          to deposit with the clerk of the court all documents and shares of
          Parent Common Stock held in escrow, except all cost, expenses, charges
          and reasonable attorney fees incurred by the Escrow Agent due to the
          interpleader action and which the parties jointly and severally agree
          to pay. Upon initiating such action, the Escrow Agent shall be fully
          released and discharged of and from all obligations and liability
          imposed by the terms of this Agreement.

               (vii) The parties and their respective successors and assigns
          agree jointly and severally to indemnify and hold Escrow Agent
          harmless against any and all losses, claims, damages, liabilities, and
          expenses, including reasonable costs of investigation, counsel fees,
          including allocated costs of in-house counsel and disbursements that
          may be imposed on Escrow Agent or incurred by Escrow Agent in
          connection with the performance of the Escrow Agent's duties under
          this Agreement, including but not limited to any Litigation arising
          from this Agreement or involving its subject matter other than arising
          out of its negligence or willful misconduct.

               (viii) The Escrow Agent may resign at any time upon giving at
          least thirty (30) days written notice to the parties; provided,
          however, that no such resignation shall become effective until the
          appointment of a successor escrow agent which shall be accomplished as
          follows: the parties shall use their best efforts to mutually agree on
          a successor escrow agent within thirty (30) days after receiving such
          notice. If the parties fail to agree upon a successor escrow agent
          within such time, the Escrow Agent shall have the right to appoint a
          successor escrow agent authorized to do business in the state of
          California. The successor escrow agent shall execute and deliver an
          instrument accepting such appointment and the terms of this Article 8
          and it shall, without further acts, be vested with all the estates,
          properties, rights, powers, and duties of the predecessor escrow agent
          as if originally named as escrow agent. Upon appointment of a
          successor escrow agent, the Escrow Agent shall be discharged from any
          further duties and liability under this Agreement.

           (j) Fees. All fees of the Escrow Agent for performance of its duties
hereunder shall be paid by Parent in accordance with the standard fee schedule
of the Escrow Agent attached hereto as Exhibit E. It is understood that the fees
and usual charges agreed upon for services of the Escrow Agent shall be
considered compensation for ordinary services as contemplated by this Agreement.
In the


                                       57

<PAGE>


event that the conditions of this Agreement are not promptly fulfilled, or if
the Escrow Agent renders any service not provided for in this Agreement, or if
the parties request a substantial modification of its terms, or if any
controversy arises, or if the Escrow Agent is made a party to, or intervenes in,
any litigation pertaining to the Escrow Fund or its subject matter, the Escrow
Agent shall be reasonably compensated for such extraordinary services and
reimbursed for all costs, attorney's fees, including allocated costs of in-house
counsel, and expenses occasioned by such default, delay, controversy or
litigation.

           (k) Consequential Damages. In no event shall the Escrow Agent be
liable for special, indirect or consequential loss or damages of any kind
whatsoever (including but not limited to lost profits), even if the Escrow Agent
has been advised of the likelihood of such loss or damages and regardless of the
form of action.

           (l) Successor Escrow Agents. Any corporation into which the Escrow
Agent in its individual capacity may be merged or converted or with which it may
be consolidated, or any corporation resulting from any merger, conversion or
consolidation to which the Escrow Agent in its individual capacity shall be a
party, or any corporation to which substantially all the corporate trust
business of the Escrow Agent in its individual capacity may be transferred,
shall be the Escrow Agent under this Escrow Agreement without further act.

           SECTION 8.03.  Stockholder Representative.

           (a) In the event that the Merger is approved, effective upon such
vote, and without further act of any stockholder, Steven P. Flannery shall be
appointed as agent and attorney-in-fact (the "Stockholder Representative"") for
each Stockholder, for and on behalf of the Stockholders, to give and receive
notices and communications, to authorize delivery to Parent of shares of Parent
Common Stock from the Escrow Fund in satisfaction of claims by Parent, to object
to such deliveries, to agree to, negotiate, enter into settlements and
compromises of, and demand arbitration and comply with orders of courts and
awards of arbitrators with respect to such claims, and to take all actions
necessary or appropriate in the judgment of the Stockholder Representative for
the accomplishment of the foregoing. Such agency may be changed by the
Stockholders from time to time upon not less than thirty (30) days prior written
notice to Parent; provided, however, that the Stockholder Representative may not
be removed unless holders of a majority in interest in the Escrow Fund agree to
such removal and to the identity of the substituted agent. Any vacancy in the
position of Stockholder Representative may be filled by approval of the holders
of a majority in interest in the Escrow Fund. No bond shall be required of the
Stockholder Representative, and the Stockholder Representative shall not receive
compensation for his or her services. Notices or communications to or from the
Stockholder Representative shall constitute notice to or from each of the
Stockholders.


                                       58

<PAGE>


           (b) The Stockholder Representative shall not be liable for any act
done or omitted hereunder as Stockholder Representative while acting in good
faith and in the exercise of reasonable judgment. The Stockholders on whose
behalf the Escrow Amount was contributed to the Escrow Fund shall severally
indemnify the Stockholder Representative and hold the Stockholder Representative
harmless against any loss, liability or expense incurred without negligence or
bad faith on the part of the Stockholder Representative and arising out of or in
connection with the acceptance or administration of the Stockholder
Representative's duties hereunder, including the reasonable fees and expenses of
any legal counsel retained by the Stockholders.

           A decision, act, consent or instruction of the Stockholder
Representative shall constitute a decision, act, consent or instruction of all
Stockholders for whom a portion of the Escrow Amount otherwise issuable to them
are deposited in the Escrow Fund and shall be final, binding and conclusive upon
each of such Stockholders, and the Escrow Agent and Parent may rely upon any
such decision, act, consent or instruction of the Stockholder Representative as
being the decision, act, consent or instruction of each and every such
Stockholder. The Escrow Agent and Parent are hereby relieved from any liability
to any person for any acts done by them in accordance with such decision, act,
consent or instruction of the Stockholder Representative.

           (a) by mutual written agreement of the Company and Parent;

           (b) by either the Company or Parent, if:

               (i) the Merger has not been consummated on or before September
          30, 2000 (the "End Date"), provided that the right to terminate this
          Agreement pursuant to this Section 9.01(b)(i) shall not be available
          to any party whose breach of any provision of this Agreement results
          in the failure of the Merger to be consummated by such time;

               (ii) there shall be any law or regulation that makes consummation
          of the Merger illegal or otherwise prohibited or any judgment,
          injunction,


                                       59

<PAGE>


          order or decree of any court or governmental body having competent
          jurisdiction enjoining Company or Parent from consummating the Merger
          is entered and such judgment, injunction, judgment or order shall have
          become final and nonappealable; or

               (iii) as permitted by Section 5.03(b)(iv), the Board of Directors
          of the Company shall have failed to make or withdrawn, or modified in
          a manner adverse to Parent, its approval or recommendation of this
          Agreement or the Merger, or shall have failed to call the Company
          Stockholder Meeting in accordance with Section 5.02, provided that the

          Proposal of the nature described in Section 5.03(c), attaching the
          most current version of such agreement (or a description of all
          material terms and conditions thereof), and (ii) Parent does not make,
          within 72 hours of receipt of such written notification, an offer that
          is at least as favorable to the shareholders of the Company as such
          Superior Proposal, it being understood that the Company shall not
          enter into any such binding agreement during such 72-hour period.

           (c) by Parent, if (i) a breach of or failure to perform any
representation, warranty, covenant or agreement on the part of the Company set
forth in this Agreement shall have occurred that would cause the condition set
forth in Section 7.01(e), 7.02(a) not to be satisfied, and such condition is
incapable of being satisfied by the End Date, (ii) the Company shall have failed
to call the Stockholder Meeting in accordance with Section 5.02, or (iii) an
event having a Company Material Adverse Change shall have occurred after the
date of this Agreement and the effect of such event is not reversed within 10
days of such occurrence such that it no longer has a Company Material Adverse
Change; or

           (d) by the Company, if (i) a breach of or failure to perform any
representation, warranty, covenant or agreement on the part of the Parent or Sub
set forth in this Agreement shall have occurred that would cause the condition
set forth in Section 7.01(a) not to be satisfied, and such condition is
incapable of being satisfied by the End Date, or (ii) an event having a Parent
Material Adverse Change shall have occurred after the date of this Agreement and
the effect of such event is not reversed within 10 days of such occurrence such
that it no longer has a Parent Material Adverse Change.
