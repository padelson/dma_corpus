                          AGREEMENT AND PLAN OF MERGER

     This AGREEMENT AND PLAN OF MERGER (the "AGREEMENT") dated as of January 16,
2001 is by and among ArQule, Inc. ("ARQULE"), a Delaware corporation, Camitro
Acquisition Corporation ("MERGER SUB"), a Delaware corporation and a wholly
owned subsidiary of ArQule, Camitro Corporation ("CAMITRO"), a California
corporation, and the stockholders of Camitro identified on the signature pages
hereto (collectively, the "PRINCIPAL STOCKHOLDERS").

     A.   Upon the terms and subject to the conditions of this Agreement and in
accordance with the Delaware General Corporation Law (the "DGCL") and the
California General Corporation Law (the "CGCL"), ArQule and Camitro will enter
into a business combination transaction pursuant to which Merger Sub will merge
with and into Camitro (the "MERGER").

     B.   ArQule, Camitro, Merger Sub and the Principal Stockholders desire to
make certain representations and warranties and other agreements in connection
with the Merger.

     C.   The parties intend, by executing this Agreement, to adopt a plan of
reorganization within the meaning of Section 368 of the Internal Revenue Code of
1986, as amended (the "CODE").

     NOW, THEREFORE, in consideration of the covenants, promises and
representations set forth herein, and for other good and valuable consideration,
the receipt and sufficiency of which are hereby acknowledged, the parties agree
as follows:

                                   ARTICLE I

                                   THE MERGER

     1.1  THE MERGER. At the Effective Time (as defined in Section 1.2) and
subject to and upon the terms and conditions of this Agreement and the
applicable provisions of the CGCL and the DGCL, Merger Sub shall be merged with
and into Camitro, the separate corporate existence of Merger Sub shall cease and
Camitro shall continue as the surviving corporation (the "SURVIVING
CORPORATION").

     1.2  EFFECTIVE TIME; CLOSING. The closing of the Merger (the "CLOSING")
shall take place at a time and date to be specified by the parties, which shall
be no later than the second business day after the satisfaction or waiver of the
conditions set forth in Article VII, or at such other time, date, and location
as the parties hereto agree in writing (the "CLOSING DATE"). At the Closing, the
parties shall deliver to each other the various certificates and instruments
required under Article VII, as well as the other deliveries to be made at
Closing pursuant to this Agreement. As soon as practicable thereafter, the
parties shall cause the Merger to be consummated by executing and filing
Articles of Merger and Certificate of Merger (the "MERGER ARTICLES") with the
Secretaries of State of California and Delaware in accordance with the relevant
provisions of the DGCL and the CGCL, respectively (the time of the later
acceptance of either such filing (or such later time as may be agreed in writing
by the parties and specified in the Merger Articles) being the "EFFECTIVE
TIME"). Unless the context otherwise requires, the term "AGREEMENT" as used
herein refers collectively to this Agreement and the Merger Articles.

<PAGE>   7

     1.3  EFFECT OF THE MERGER. At the Effective Time, the effect of the Merger
shall be as provided in this Agreement and the applicable provisions of the CGCL
and the DGCL. Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, and subject
thereto, at the Effective Time all the property, rights, privileges, powers and
franchises of Camitro and Merger Sub shall vest in the Surviving Corporation,
and all debts, liabilities and duties of Camitro and Merger Sub shall become the
debts, liabilities and duties of the Surviving Corporation.

     1.4  ARTICLES OF ORGANIZATION; BYLAWS.

          (a)  At the Effective Time, the Articles of Incorporation of Camitro,
as in effect immediately prior to the Effective Time, shall be the Articles of
Incorporation of the Surviving Corporation until thereafter amended as provided
by law and such Articles of Incorporation. The purposes of the Surviving
Corporation shall be the purposes of Camitro, as in effect immediately prior to
the Effective Time.

          (b)  The Bylaws of Camitro, as in effect immediately prior to the
Effective Time, shall be, at the Effective Time, the Bylaws of the Surviving
Corporation until thereafter amended.

     1.5  DIRECTORS AND OFFICERS. The directors of Merger Sub immediately prior
to the Effective Time shall be the initial directors of the Surviving
Corporation, to serve until their respective successors are duly elected or
appointed and qualified. The officers of Camitro immediately prior to the
Effective Time shall be the initial officers of the Surviving Corporation, to
serve until their successors are duly elected or appointed or qualified.

     1.6  EFFECT ON CAPITAL STOCK. At the Effective Time, by virtue of the
Merger and without any action on the part of Merger Sub, Camitro or the holders
of any of the following securities, the following actions shall occur with
respect to the capital stock of Camitro and Merger Sub:

          (a)  CONVERSION OF CAMITRO STOCK. All shares of Common Stock of
Camitro (the "CAMITRO COMMON STOCK"), all shares of Series A Preferred Stock of
Camitro (the "Camitro Series A Preferred Stock") and all shares of Series B
Preferred Stock of Camitro (the "CAMITRO SERIES B PREFERRED STOCK," and together
with Camitro Series A Preferred Stock and Camitro Series B Preferred Stock, the
"CAMITRO STOCK"), issued and outstanding immediately before the Effective Time
(other than any shares of Camitro Stock to be canceled pursuant to Section
1.6(c) if any, and shares of Camitro Stock held by a stockholder who has
properly exercised dissenters' rights in accordance with Section 1300 of the
CGCL, which shall be treated in accordance with Section 1.10) will be canceled
and extinguished and automatically converted (subject to Section 1.6(e)) into
the right to receive the following shares and, subject to provisions of Section
1.6(b), cash (together, the "MERGER CONSIDERATION"):

               (i)  A number of shares (the "MERGER SHARES") of Common Stock,
     par value $.01 per share, of ArQule (the "ARQULE COMMON STOCK") determined
     by multiplying the number of shares of Camitro Stock held by each such
     holder by the Stock Conversion Factor (as defined below); and

                                       2
<PAGE>   8

               (ii) an amount in cash for each share of Camitro Stock held by
     each such holder determined by dividing the Merger Cash (as defined
     herein), if any, determined pursuant to Section 1.6(b) by the number of
     shares of Camitro Common Stock either outstanding or issuable on conversion
     of the Camitro Series A Preferred Stock and the Camitro Series B Preferred
     Stock immediately prior to the Effective Time, but excluding shares of
     Camitro Stock canceled pursuant to Section 1.6(c);

such Merger Consideration to be allocated among the holders of shares of Camitro
Stock on a pro rata basis, subject to the provisions of Sections 1.9 and 1.14;
notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained herein, if the Per Share
Value (as defined in Section 6.5(b)) is less than $3.10, then the Merger
Consideration shall be allocated as set forth in Section 3 of the Articles of
Incorporation of Camitro and the Camitro Stock shall be canceled and
extinguished and automatically converted into the right to receive the Merger
Consideration.

               (iii) "Stock Conversion Factor" means the quotient obtained by
     dividing (i) 3,390,000 less the aggregate number of shares of ArQule Common
     Stock reserved for issuance under Section 1.6(d) and 6.5(a) hereof by (ii)
     the number of shares of Camitro Common Stock either outstanding or issuable
     on conversion of outstanding shares of Camitro Series A Preferred Stock and
     Camitro Series B Preferred Stock immediately prior to the Effective Time,
     but excluding shares of Camitro Stock canceled pursuant to Section 1.6(c),
     if any, and excluding shares of Camitro Stock reserved for issuance to the
     University of Pittsburgh pursuant to Section 7.3(k).

          (b)  MERGER CASH. If the product of the Market Value (as defined
herein) multiplied by 3,390,000 shares of ArQule Common Stock is less than
$95,000,000, then the Merger Consideration shall include a cash payment, not to
exceed $10,000,000, equal to the excess of $95,000,000 over such product (the
"MERGER CASH"). For purposes of this Agreement, "MARKET VALUE" of ArQule Common
Stock means the average of the closing prices of ArQule Common Stock as reported
on the Nasdaq National Market for the ten (10) consecutive trading days ending
on the day prior to the date of the Camitro stockholder meeting scheduled
pursuant to Section 6.12.

          (c)  CANCELLATION OF CERTAIN SHARES. Each share of Camitro Stock held
in the treasury of Camitro, if any, owned by Merger Sub, ArQule or any direct or
indirect wholly owned subsidiary of Camitro or of ArQule immediately before the
Effective Time shall be canceled and extinguished without any conversion
thereof.

          (d)  STOCK OPTIONS AND WARRANTS. At the Effective Time, all options to
purchase Camitro Common Stock then outstanding under Camitro's 1999 Stock Option
Plan (the "CAMITRO STOCK PLAN") and all warrants to purchase Camitro Series B
Preferred Stock then outstanding shall be assumed by ArQule in accordance with
Section 6.5 hereof.

          (e)  FRACTIONAL SHARES. No fraction of a share of ArQule Common Stock
will be issued by virtue of the Merger, but in lieu thereof each holder of
shares of Camitro Stock who would otherwise be entitled to a fraction of a share
of ArQule Common Stock (after aggregating all fractional shares of ArQule Common
Stock to be received by such holder) shall receive from ArQule an amount of cash
(rounded to the nearest whole cent) equal to the product of such

                                       3
<PAGE>   9

fraction, multiplied by the closing price per share of ArQule Common Stock on
the last trading day before the Closing Date, as reported on the Nasdaq National
Market.

          (f)  CAPITAL STOCK OF MERGER SUB. Each share of Common Stock, par
value $.01 per share, of Merger Sub issued and outstanding immediately prior to
the Effective Time shall be converted into and exchanged for one validly issued,
fully paid and nonassessable share of Common Stock, par value $.01 per share, of
the Surviving Corporation. Each stock certificate evidencing ownership of any
such shares shall continue to evidence ownership of such shares of capital stock
of the Surviving Corporation.

     1.7  SURRENDER OF CERTIFICATES.

          (a)  DELIVERY OF CAMITRO STOCK. At the Closing, each Stockholder shall
surrender and deliver to ArQule certificates (the "CERTIFICATES") representing
all of such holder's ownership of Camitro Stock.

          (b)  DELIVERY OF MERGER CASH. At the Closing, ArQule shall deliver to
the holders of shares of Camitro Stock the Merger Cash, if any, to be allocated
among the holders of shares of Camitro Stock in accordance with SCHEDULE 1 by
wire transfer to an account designated by the holders.

          (c)  DELIVERY OF MERGER SHARES. As soon as practicable after the
Effective Time, subject to Sections 1.9 and 1.14, ArQule shall cause its
transfer agent to mail to each holder of shares of Camitro Stock who has
delivered his, her or its Certificate(s) pursuant to Section 1.7(a) a
certificate representing that number of Merger Shares into which such shares of
Camitro Stock theretofore held by such stockholder shall have been converted
pursuant to the provisions of this Agreement.

          (d)  EFFECT OF FAILURE TO DELIVER CAMITRO STOCK. Until surrendered in
accordance with the provisions of this Section, each Certificate representing
Camitro Stock held by a stockholder shall be deemed from and after the Effective
Time, for all corporate purposes, to evidence only ownership of the number of
full shares of ArQule Common Stock into which such shares of Camitro Stock shall
have been so converted and the right to receive a proportionate amount of Merger
Cash, if any, and any cash in lieu of the issuance of any fractional shares in
accordance with Section 1.6(e).

          (e)  DISTRIBUTIONS WITH RESPECT TO UNEXCHANGED SHARES. No dividends or
other distributions declared or made after the date of this Agreement with
respect to ArQule Common Stock with a record date after the Effective Time will
be paid to the holder of any unsurrendered Certificate with respect to the
shares of ArQule Common Stock represented thereby until the holder of record of
such Certificate shall surrender such Certificate. Subject to applicable law,
following surrender of any such Certificate, there shall be paid to the record
holder thereof certificates representing whole shares of ArQule Common Stock
issued in exchange therefor, without interest, along with the amount of
dividends or other distributions with a record date after the Effective Time
payable with respect to such whole shares of ArQule Common Stock, a
proportionate amount of Merger Cash, if any, and cash in lieu of any fractional
shares in accordance with Section 1.6(e).

                                       4
<PAGE>   10

          (f)  TRANSFERS OF OWNERSHIP. If any certificate for shares of ArQule
Common Stock is to be issued in a name other than that in which the Certificate
surrendered in exchange therefor is registered, it will be a condition of the
issuance thereof that the Certificate so surrendered will be properly endorsed,
accompanied by any documents required to evidence and effect such transfer and
otherwise in proper form for transfer and that the person requesting such
exchange will have paid to ArQule or any agent designated by it any applicable
transfer taxes required by reason of the issuance of a certificate for shares of
ArQule Common Stock in any name other than that of the registered holder of the
Certificate surrendered, or shall provide evidence that any applicable transfer
taxes have been paid.

     1.8  NO FURTHER OWNERSHIP RIGHTS IN CAMITRO STOCK. All Merger Shares issued
and Merger Cash paid upon the surrender for exchange of shares of Camitro Stock
in accordance with the terms hereof (including any cash paid in respect thereof
pursuant to Section 1.6(e)) shall be deemed to have been issued in full
satisfaction of all rights pertaining to such shares of Camitro Stock, and there

          (a)  All Tax Returns (as defined below) required to be filed on or
before the date hereof by or with respect to Camitro have been filed within the
time and in the manner prescribed by law. All such Tax Returns are true,
correct, and complete in all material respects; provided, however, that no
representation is made herein as to the availability for periods after

                                       10
<PAGE>   16

the date that includes the Effective Time (the "EFFECTIVE DATE") to ArQule under
Sections 382, 383, or 384 of the Code of Camitro's net operating losses,
built-in losses, or tax credits shown on such Tax Returns. All Taxes owed by
Camitro for the periods covered by such Tax Returns, whether or not shown on any
Tax Return, have been paid. Camitro is not currently the beneficiary of any
extension of time within which to file any Tax Return. Camitro files Tax Returns
in all jurisdictions where it is required to so file, and no claim has ever been
made in writing by any taxing authority in any other jurisdiction that Camitro
is or may be subject to taxation by that jurisdiction.

          (b)  There are no liens or other encumbrances with respect to Taxes
upon any of the assets or properties of Camitro, other than with respect to
Taxes not yet due and payable.

          (c)  No deficiency for any Taxes has been proposed in writing against
Camitro, which deficiency has not been paid in full, and Camitro does not know
of any basis upon which any such Tax deficiency could reasonably be expected to
be asserted. No issue relating to Camitro or involving any Tax for which Camitro
might be liable has been resolved in favor of any taxing authority in any audit
or examination which, by application of the same principles, could reasonably be
expected to result in a deficiency for Taxes of Camitro for any other period.

          (d)  Section 2.7(d) of the Camitro Disclosure Schedule lists all
federal, state, local, and foreign income Tax Returns filed with respect to
Camitro for taxable periods ended on or after December 31, 1995, indicates those
Tax Returns that have been audited, and indicates those Tax Returns that
currently are the subject of audit. Except as set forth in Section 2.7(d), there
are no outstanding agreements, waivers or arrangements extending the statutory
period of limitation applicable to any claim for, or the period for the
collection or assessment of, Taxes due from or with respect to Camitro for any
taxable period, and no power of attorney granted by or with respect to Camitro
relating to Taxes is currently in force. Camitro has delivered to ArQule true,
complete and correct copies of all Tax Returns, audit reports, and statements of
deficiencies for each of the last three taxable years filed by or issued to or
with respect to Camitro (or, insofar as such items relate to Camitro, by or to
any affiliated, consolidated, combined, or unitary group of which Camitro was
then a member).

          (e)  The unpaid Taxes of Camitro for all taxable periods (or portions
thereof) ending on or prior to the Effective Date (i) did not, as of September
30, 2000, exceed the reserve for tax liability (rather than any reserve for
deferred Taxes established to reflect timing differences between book and Tax
income) set forth on the face (rather than in any notes thereof) of the balance
sheet included in the Camitro Interim Financial Statements and (ii) will not, as
of the Effective Date, exceed such reserve as adjusted to reflect the ordinary
operations of Camitro after September 30, 2000 and through the Effective Date in
accordance with the past customs and practice of Camitro in filing its Tax
Returns.

          (f)  Camitro is not a "consenting corporation" within the meaning of
Section 341(f) of the Code, and no consent to the application of Section
341(f)(2) of the Code (or any predecessor provision) has been made or filed by
or with respect to Camitro or any of its assets or properties. None of the
assets or properties of Camitro are or will be required to be treated as being
(i) owned by any other person pursuant to the provisions of Section 168(f)(8) of
the

                                       11
<PAGE>   17

Internal Revenue Code of 1954, as amended and in effect immediately before the
enactment of the Tax Reform Act of 1986, or (ii) tax-exempt use property within
the meaning of Section 168(h)(1) of the Code. Camitro has not agreed, nor is it
required, to make any adjustment under Section 481(a) of the Code by reason of a
change in accounting method or otherwise.

          (g)  Camitro has not been and is not currently in violation (or, with
or without notice or lapse of time or both, would be in violation) of any
applicable law or regulation relating to the payment, collection, or withholding
of Taxes, or the remittance thereof, and all withholding and payroll Tax
requirements required to be complied with by Camitro up to and including the
date hereof have been satisfied.

          (h)  Camitro is not and has never been (i) a member of any affiliated
group filing or required to file a consolidated, combined, or unitary Tax Return
or (ii) a party to or bound by, nor does it have or has it ever had any
obligation under, any Tax sharing agreement or similar contract or arrangement.
Camitro does not have any liability for the Taxes of any other person under
Treasury Regulation ss.1.1502-6 (or any similar provision of state, local, or
foreign law), as a transferee or successor, by contract, or otherwise.

          (i)  Camitro has not distributed to its stockholders or security
holders stock or securities of a controlled corporation in a transaction to
which Section 355 of the Code applies (x) in the two years prior to the date of
this Agreement or (y) in a distribution which could otherwise constitute part of
a "plan" or "series of related transactions" (within the meaning of Section
355(e) of the Code) that includes the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement, nor was Camitro the subject of any such distribution pursuant to any
transaction with respect to which Camitro has agreed to or is otherwise
obligated to, indemnify any person for any tax resulting from or attributable to
such transaction.

          (j)  Camitro is not a party to any contract or agreement, plan, or
arrangement concerning any person that, individually or collectively with other
similar agreements, could give rise to the payment of any amount that would not
be deductible by Camitro by reason of Section 280G of the Code or would be
subject to the limitations in Section 162 of the Code.

          (k)  Camitro is not and has not been during the applicable period
specified in Section 897(c)(1)(A)(ii) of the Code a United States real property
holding corporation within the meaning of Section 897(c)(2) of the Code.

          (l)  Camitro has not used the installment method to defer any material
liability for Taxes to any taxable period ending after the Closing Date.

          (m)  No stockholder holds shares of Camitro Stock which are subject to
a substantial risk of forfeiture (within the meaning of Section 83 of the Code)
with respect to which a valid election under Section 83(b) of the Code has not
been made.

          (n)  As used in this Agreement, (i) "TAX RETURN" means any return,
declaration, report, claim for refund, information return, or statement, and any
schedule, attachment, or amendment thereto, including without limitation any
consolidated, combined or unitary return or other document (including any
related or supporting information), filed or required to be filed by any taxing
authority in connection with the determination, assessment,

                                       12
<PAGE>   18

collection, imposition, payment, refund or credit of any federal, state, local
or foreign Tax or the administration of the laws relating to any Tax, and (ii)
"TAX" or "TAXES" means any and all taxes, charges, fees, levies, deficiencies or
other assessments of whatever kind or nature including, without limitation, all
net income, gross income, profits, gross receipts, excise, real or personal
property, sales, ad valorem, withholding, social security, retirement, excise,
employment, unemployment, minimum estimated, severance, stamp, property,
occupation, environmental, windfall profits, use, service, net worth, payroll,

authority, including any liability therefor as a transferee under Section 6901
of the Code or any similar provision of applicable law, as a result of Treasury
Regulation ss.1.1502-6 or any similar provision of applicable law, or as a
result of any Tax sharing or similar agreement, together with any interest,
penalties or additions to tax relating thereof.

     2.8  TITLE TO PROPERTIES; ABSENCE OF LIENS AND ENCUMBRANCES.

          (a)  Camitro does not own any real property. Section 2.8(a) of the
Camitro Disclosure Schedule lists all real property leases to which Camitro is a
party and each amendment thereto. All such current leases are in full force and
effect, are valid and effective in accordance with their respective terms, and
there is not, under any of such leases, any existing default or event of default
(or event which with notice or lapse of time, or both, would constitute a
default).

          (b)  Camitro has good and valid title to, or, in the case of leased
properties and assets, valid leasehold interests in, all of its tangible
properties and assets, real, personal and mixed, used or held for use in its
business, and such properties and assets, as well as all other properties and
assets of Camitro, whether tangible or intangible, are free and clear of any
liens, except as reflected in the Camitro Financial Statements or in Section
2.8(b) of the Camitro Disclosure Schedule and except for liens for taxes not yet
due and payable and such imperfections of title and encumbrances, if any, that
are not material in character, amount or extent, and that do not materially
detract from the value, or materially interfere with the present use, of the
property subject thereto or affected thereby.

     2.9  INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY.

          (a)  To the best of Camitro's knowledge, Camitro owns, or is licensed
or otherwise possesses legally enforceable rights to use, all patents, trade
secrets, trademarks (both registered and unregistered), trade names, service
marks, copyrights, and any applications therefor, schematics, technology,
know-how, computer software programs or applications (in both source code and
object code form), and tangible or intangible proprietary information or
material that are required or necessary for the conduct of business of Camitro
as currently conducted including current products under development
(collectively, the "CAMITRO INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY").

          (b)  The Camitro Disclosure Schedule sets forth a list of all federal,
state and foreign patents, registered copyrights, registered and unregistered
trademarks, and any applications therefor included in the Camitro Intellectual
Property, and specifies, where applicable, the jurisdictions in which each such
item of Camitro Intellectual Property has been

                                       13
<PAGE>   19

issued or registered or in which an application for such issuance or
registration has been filed, including the respective registration or
application numbers and the names of all registered owners. The Camitro
Disclosure Schedule sets forth a list of all licenses, sublicenses and other
agreements to which Camitro is a party and pursuant to which Camitro or any
other person is authorized to use or license the use of any (i) Camitro
Intellectual Property and (ii) third party patents, copyrights, trademarks, and
applications for registration thereof. The execution and delivery of this
Agreement by Camitro, and the consummation of the transactions contemplated
hereby, will not cause Camitro to be in violation or default under any such
license, sublicense or agreement, nor entitle any other party to any such
license, sublicense or agreement to terminate or modify such license, sublicense
or agreement.

          (c)  No claims have been asserted in writing or are, to Camitro's
knowledge, threatened by any person, to the effect that the practice of the
Camitro Intellectual Property or the manufacture, sale, licensing or use of any
of Camitro's current products, including current products under development,
infringes on any copyright, patent, trademark, service mark, trade secret or
other proprietary right of any third party. To Camitro's knowledge, Camitro has
not infringed, and the business of Camitro does not infringe, any copyright,
patent, trade secret or other proprietary right of any third party. To Camitro's
knowledge, there is no unauthorized use, infringement or misappropriation of any
of Camitro Intellectual Property by any third party, including any employee or
former employee of Camitro. To the best of Camitro's knowledge, no Camitro
Intellectual Property or product of Camitro is subject to any outstanding
decree, order, judgment or stipulation restricting in any manner the licensing
thereof by Camitro. Camitro has entered into valid and binding confidentiality,
non-disclosure and assignment of inventions agreements with all current and
former employees. Camitro has also entered into confidentiality agreements with
all current and former consultants, vendors, collaborators and other third
parties with access to non-public information regarding the Camitro Intellectual
Property. Such forms of agreements are attached to Section 2.9(c) of the Camitro
Disclosure Schedule.

     2.10 COMPLIANCE; PERMITS; RESTRICTIONS.

          (a)  Camitro is not in default or violation of, (i) any law, rule,
regulation, order, judgment or decree applicable to Camitro or by which any of
its properties is bound or affected, or (ii) any note, bond, mortgage,
indenture, contract, agreement, lease, license, permit, franchise or other
instrument or obligation to which Camitro is a party or by which Camitro or any
of its properties is bound or affected which would cause a Camitro Material
Adverse Effect.

          (b)  Camitro holds all consents, permits, licenses, variances,
exemptions, orders and approvals from governmental authorities that are material
to the operation of the business of Camitro (collectively, the "CAMITRO
PERMITS"). Camitro is in compliance with the terms of Camitro Permits, except
where the failure to so comply, individually or in the aggregate, would not have
a Camitro Material Adverse Effect.

     2.11 LITIGATION. There is no action, suit or proceeding of any nature
pending or, to Camitro's knowledge, threatened against Camitro or any of its
properties, assets, securities, officers or directors, in their respective
capacities as such. To Camitro's knowledge, there is no investigation pending or
threatened against Camitro, its properties or any of its officers or

                                       14
<PAGE>   20

directors by or before any Governmental Entity that would have a Camitro
Material Adverse Effect or would prevent Camitro from consummating the
transactions contemplated hereby.

     2.12 BROKERS' AND FINDERS' FEES. Camitro has not incurred, nor will it
incur, directly or indirectly, any liability for brokerage or finders' fees or
agents' commissions or any similar charges in connection with this Agreement or
any transaction contemplated hereby.

     2.13 EMPLOYEE BENEFITS. Section 2.13 of the Camitro Disclosure Schedule
sets forth a correct and complete list of all pension, profit sharing,
retirement, deferred compensation, welfare, insurance, disability, bonus,
vacation pay, severance pay and similar plans, programs or arrangements,
including without limitation all employee benefit plans as defined in Section
3(3) of the Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974, as amended
("ERISA") with respect to which Camitro is the "PLAN SPONSOR" within the meaning
of Section 3(16)(B) of ERISA, or in which Camitro participates (the "CAMITRO
PLANS"). Camitro has never maintained or contributed to a defined benefit
pension plan that is subject to Title IV of ERISA. Camitro has never maintained
or contributed to any "MULTIEMPLOYER PLAN" as defined in Section 4001(a)(3) of
ERISA, and Camitro has not incurred any material liability under Sections 4062,
4063 or 4201 of ERISA. Except as set forth in Section 2.13 of the Camitro
Disclosure Schedule, each master prototype plan upon which each of the Camitro
Plans is based and which is intended to be qualified under Section 401(a) or
501(c)(9) of the Code, has received or is the subject of a favorable
determination letter from the Internal Revenue Service; and nothing has occurred
since the date of such favorable determination letter that would adversely
affect the qualification of such prototype or plan. Except as set forth on
Section 2.13 of the Camitro Disclosure Schedule, each Camitro Plan has been
administered in all material respects in accordance with the terms of such
Camitro Plan and the provisions of any and all applicable statutes, orders or
governmental rules or regulations, including without limitation ERISA and the
Code. Except as set forth on Section 2.13 of the Camitro Disclosure Schedule, to
the knowledge of Camitro, nothing has been done or omitted to be done with
respect to any Camitro Plan which is intended to comply with Section 401(a) of
the Code that could be reasonably expected to adversely affect the qualified
status of such Camitro Plan or result in any material liability on the part of
Camitro including, without limitation, under Title I of ERISA or Section 4975 of
the Code. All material reports, returns, notices and documents required to be
filed with respect to all Camitro Plans, including without limitation annual
reports on Form 5500 (as applicable), have been timely filed. Except as set
forth on Section 2.13 of the Camitro Disclosure Schedule, all material
contributions required by law or the terms of any Camitro Plan have been made.
Except as set forth on Section 2.13 of the Camitro Disclosure Schedule, all
material claims for welfare benefits incurred by employees of Camitro on or
before the Closing are or will be fully covered by third-party insurance
policies or programs. Except for continuation of health coverage to the extent
required under Section 4980B of the Code or as otherwise set forth in this
Agreement, there are no obligations under any Camitro Plan providing group
health expense reimbursements benefits after termination of employment. Complete
copies of the following documents with respect to each Camitro Plan (as
applicable) have been delivered or made available to ArQule: (i) each relevant
Camitro Plan document and subsequent amendment thereto; (ii) each trust
agreement, group annuity contract, insurance policy or contract relating to a
Camitro Plan; (iii) each Form 5500 series annual report with each required
schedule and attachment for each of the three (3) most recent plan years for
which the time for filing and report has passed (or for such shorter period of
time that such Camitro Plan has been in effect); (iv) the most recent IRS
determination

                                       15

opinion or notification letter, if any, for each Camitro Plan which is intended
to comply with the requirements of Section 401(a) of the Code; and (v) the most
recent summary plan description and each summary of material modification
thereto. For purposes of this Section 2.13, references to Camitro include
Camitro and its ERISA Affiliates. An "ERISA AFFILIATE" of Camitro means any
trade or business (whether or not incorporated) that together with Camitro would
have been deemed a "single employer" within the meaning of Sections 414(b), (c),
and (m) of the Code at any time within the five-year period ending on the
Closing Date.

     2.14 EMPLOYMENT MATTERS.

          (a)  COMPLIANCE. Camitro (i) is in compliance in all material respects

business and consistent with past practice).

          (b)  LABOR. No work stoppage or labor strike against Camitro is
pending or, to the knowledge of Camitro, threatened. Camitro has not engaged in
any unfair labor practices within the meaning of the National Labor Relations
Act that would, individually or in the aggregate, directly or indirectly have a
Camitro Material Adverse Effect. Camitro is not presently, nor has it been in
the past, a party to, or bound by, (i) any collective bargaining agreement or
union contract with respect to employees and no collective bargaining agreement
is being negotiated by Camitro or (ii) any statutory works council or other
agreement, statute, rule or regulation that mandates employee approval,
participation, consultation or consent with regard to the transactions
contemplated hereby.

          (c)  EMPLOYEES. To Camitro's knowledge, no employee of Camitro (i) has
an employment agreement, (ii) is in violation of any term of any patent
disclosure agreement, non-competition agreement, or any restrictive covenant to
a former employer relating to the right of any such employee to be employed by
Camitro because of the nature of the business conducted or presently proposed to
be conducted by Camitro or to the use of trade secrets or proprietary
information of others or (iii) has given notice to Camitro, nor is Camitro
otherwise aware, that any executive officer intends to terminate his or her
employment with Camitro.

     2.15 ENVIRONMENTAL MATTERS. Camitro has complied in all material respects
with all applicable laws and regulations relating to the environment or
occupational health and safety. There is no pending or, to the knowledge of
Camitro, threatened civil or criminal litigation, written notice of violation,
formal administrative proceeding, or investigation, inquiry or information
request by any Governmental Entity, relating to any such violation of law by
Camitro. There have been no releases by Camitro, or to Camitro's knowledge, by
others, of any chemicals, pollutants, contaminants, or hazardous substances into
the environment at any parcel

                                       16
<PAGE>   22

of real property or any facility formerly or currently owned, leased, operated
or controlled by Camitro.

     2.16 AGREEMENTS, CONTRACTS AND COMMITMENTS.

          (a)  CERTAIN MATERIAL CONTRACTS. Camitro is not a party to or bound
by:

               (i)  any agreement under which Camitro is restricted from
     selling, licensing, or otherwise distributing any of its products to any
     class of customers, in any geographic area, during any period of time or in
     any segment of the market, and Camitro has not granted any exclusive rights
     with respect to any of its products to any other person;

               (ii) any agreement, contract or commitment relating to capital
     expenditures and involving future obligations in excess of $50,000 and not
     cancelable without penalty;

               (iii) any agreement, contract or commitment currently in force
     relating to the disposition or acquisition of assets not in the ordinary
     course of business or any ownership interest in any corporation,
     partnership, joint venture or other business enterprise;

               (iv) any mortgages, indentures, loans or credit agreements,
     security agreements relating to an amount of assets or other agreements or
     instruments relating to the borrowing of money or extension of credit; or

               (v)  any other agreement, contract or commitment (excluding real
     and personal property leases) which requires annual payments by Camitro
     under any such agreement, contract or commitment of $50,000 or more in the
     aggregate and is not cancelable within thirty (30) days without penalty.

          (b)  NO BREACHES. Neither Camitro nor, to Camitro's knowledge, any
other party has breached, violated or defaulted under, or received notice that
it has breached, violated or defaulted under, any of the terms or conditions of
any agreement, contract or commitment to which Camitro is a party or by which it
is bound in such a manner as would permit any other party to cancel or terminate
any such agreement, contract or commitment or to seek damages, which in either
case would have a Camitro Material Adverse Effect.

     2.17 DISCLOSURE. The representations and warranties of Camitro contained in
this Agreement do not contain any untrue statement of a material fact, and, when
taken together, do not omit to state any material fact necessary to make such

     Each Principal Stockholder severally represents and warrants to ArQule and
Merger Sub, subject to the exceptions specifically disclosed in writing in the
disclosure schedule supplied by the Principal Stockholders to ArQule (the
"PRINCIPAL STOCKHOLDERS DISCLOSURE SCHEDULE"), the section references of which
correspond to the sections and subsections of this Agreement to which they
relate, as follows:

     3.1  TITLE TO SHARES. Such Principal Stockholder is the true and lawful
owner of, and has good title to, the shares of Camitro Stock set forth opposite
his, her or its name on SCHEDULE 1, free and clear of any liens. There are no
shareholder agreements, voting trusts, proxies or other agreements or
understandings with respect to the outstanding shares of Camitro Stock to which
such Principal Stockholder is a party.

     3.2  AUTHORITY TO EXECUTE AND PERFORM AGREEMENTS. Such Principal
Stockholder has full legal right and power and all authority to enter into,
execute and deliver this Agreement and to perform in full his, her or its
respective obligations hereunder. This Agreement has been duly executed and
delivered and is the valid and binding obligation of such Principal Stockholder,
enforceable against such Principal Stockholder in accordance with its terms,
subject to bankruptcy, insolvency, fraudulent transfer, reorganization,
moratorium and similar laws of general applicability relating to or affecting
creditors' rights and to general principles of equity.

     3.3  NO BREACH. The execution and delivery by such Principal Stockholder of
this Agreement does not, and the performance of this Agreement will not result
in any breach of or constitute a default (or an event that with notice or lapse
of time or both would become a default) under, any instrument, contract or other
agreement to which such Principal Stockholder is a party or to which such
Principal Stockholder or his, her or its shares of Camitro Stock may be bound or
subject, or conflict with or violate any statute, law, ordinance or regulation
of any jurisdiction or any order, judgment, injunction, award or decree or other
requirement of any court, arbitrator or governmental or regulatory body binding
upon such Principal Stockholder or such Principal Stockholder's shares of
Camitro Stock.

     3.4  BROKERAGE. There are no brokerage commissions, finders' fees or
similar fees or commissions payable in connection herewith based on any

action taken by such Principal Stockholder, the liability for which is or will
be borne by Camitro or ArQule.

     3.5  INVESTMENT REPRESENTATIONS. Each Principal Stockholder has such
knowledge and experience in financial and business matters that he, she, or it
is capable of evaluating the merits and risks of an investment in shares of the
ArQule Common Stock. Each Principal Stockholder is acquiring the Merger Shares
for the Principal Stockholder's own account for investment and not with a view
to, or for sale in connection with, any distribution thereof, nor with any
present intention of distributing the Merger Shares. Each Principal Stockholder
acknowledges that the Merger Shares are restricted securities that are
unregistered under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended (the "SECURITIES
ACT"); that the each Principal Stockholder

                                       18
<PAGE>   24

must hold the Merger Shares indefinitely unless they are subsequently registered
under the Securities Act or an exemption from such registration is available;
and that the registration rights set forth in SCHEDULE 2 constitute the only
obligation of ArQule to register the Merger Shares.

     3.6  RESTRICTIONS ON TRANSFER. The Principal Stockholder will not sell,
transfer, distribute or otherwise dispose of the Merger Shares except (i)
pursuant to an effective registration statement under the Securities Act as then
in effect covering the Merger Shares and proposed distribution or (ii) upon
first furnishing to ArQule an opinion of counsel satisfactory to it stating that
the proposed disposition is not in violation of the registration requirements of
the Securities Act and such undertakings and agreements with ArQule by the
proposed transferee as ArQule may reasonably require to ensure compliance with
the Securities Act. Each Principal Stockholder acknowledges that each
certificate representing the Merger Shares will bear a legend substantially in
the following form:

     THE SHARES REPRESENTED BY THIS CERTIFICATE HAVE NOT BEEN REGISTERED UNDER
     THE SECURITIES ACT OF 1933 AND MAY NOT BE TRANSFERRED OR OTHERWISE DISPOSED
     OF UNLESS AND UNTIL (I) THE SHARES ARE REGISTERED UNDER SUCH ACT OR (II) AN
     OPINION OF COUNSEL SATISFACTORY TO THE ISSUER TO THE EFFECT THAT
     REGISTRATION UNDER SUCH ACT IS NOT REQUIRED, AND SUCH UNDERTAKINGS AS THE
     ISSUER MAY REASONABLY REQUIRE TO ENSURE COMPLIANCE WITH SUCH ACT AS
     AMENDED, ARE FURNISHED.

     3.7  INVESTIGATION. Each Principal Stockholder has been furnished with, and
has had an opportunity to read, this Agreement and all materials relating to the
business, finances, operations, and prospects of ArQule that have been
reasonably requested by it, including but not limited to the reports filed by
ArQule with the Securities and Exchange Commission pursuant to the Securities
Exchange Act of 1934, as amended. Each Principal Stockholder understands that
the Merger Shares are being or will be issued for exchange for Camitro Stock
without any particular offering or disclosure document, but acknowledges that
the Principal Stockholder has been given ample opportunity to ask questions and
request information of and receive answers from ArQule officials concerning the
business, finances and operations of ArQule.

under, or give to others any rights of termination, amendment, acceleration or
cancellation of, or result in the creation of a lien or encumbrance on any of
the properties or assets of ArQule or any of its Subsidiaries

licenses or leases required to be obtained in connection with the consummation
of the transactions contemplated hereby, all of which have been obtained except

to the properties, books, records and personnel of the other party during the
period prior to the Closing Date to obtain all information concerning the
business, including the status of product development efforts, properties,

transaction; (iii) sell, transfer, license or dispose of all or any portion of

     6.4  LEGAL REQUIREMENTS. ArQule will use its commercially reasonable
efforts to take such steps as may be necessary to comply with the securities and
blue sky laws of all jurisdictions which are applicable to the issuance of
ArQule Common Stock pursuant hereto.

     6.5  CAMITRO STOCK OPTIONS AND WARRANTS.

          (a)  At the Effective Time, each outstanding option to purchase shares
of Camitro Common Stock (each an "CAMITRO STOCK OPTION") under the Camitro Stock
Plan, whether or not exercisable, and each outstanding warrant to purchase
shares of Camitro Series B Preferred Stock (each "CAMITRO WARRANT"), whether or
not exercisable, will be assumed by ArQule, respectively, as provided in this
Section 6.5. Each Camitro Stock Option and Camitro Warrant so assumed by ArQule
under this Agreement will continue to have, and be subject to, the same terms
and conditions, including vesting schedule, set forth in the Camitro Stock Plan
or Camitro Stock Option and such Camitro Warrant, as the case may be,
immediately before the Effective Time, except that (i) each Camitro Stock Option
and Camitro Warrant will be exercisable (or will become exercisable in
accordance with its terms) for that number of whole shares of ArQule Common
Stock equal to the product of the number of shares of Camitro Common Stock or
Camitro Series B Preferred Stock, as applicable, that were issuable upon
exercise of such Camitro Stock Option or Camitro Warrant immediately before the
Effective Time multiplied by the Option Conversion Factor (as defined below),
rounded down to the nearest whole number of shares of ArQule Common Stock, and
(ii) the per share exercise price for the shares of ArQule Common Stock issuable
upon exercise of such assumed Camitro Stock Option or Camitro Warrant will be
equal to the quotient determined by dividing the exercise price per share of
Camitro Common Stock or Camitro Series B Preferred Stock, as applicable, at
which such Camitro Stock Option or Camitro Warrant was exercisable immediately
before the Effective Time by Option Conversion Factor, rounded up to the nearest
whole cent. After the Effective Time, ArQule will issue to each holder of an
outstanding Camitro Stock Option or Camitro Warrant a notice describing the
foregoing assumption of such Camitro Stock Option or Camitro Warrant by ArQule.

          (b)  "Option Conversion Factor" means the quotient obtained by
dividing (i) the Per Share Value (as defined below) by (ii) the Market Value.
"Per Share Value" equals the quotient obtained by dividing (i) the sum of (a)
the product of 3,390,000 multiplied by the Market Value plus (b) Merger Cash, if
any, by (ii) the total number of shares of Camitro Stock either outstanding or
issuable on (a) conversion of outstanding shares of Camitro Series A Preferred
Stock and shares of Camitro Series B Preferred Stock and (b) exercise of
outstanding Camitro Stock Options and Camitro Warrants immediately prior to the
Effective Time, and

                                       25
<PAGE>   31

excluding shares of Camitro Stock reserved for issuance to the University of
Pittsburgh pursuant to Section 7.3(k).

          (c)  It is the intention of the parties that Camitro Stock Options
assumed by ArQule qualify following the Effective Time as incentive stock
options as defined in Section 422 of the Code to the extent Camitro Stock
Options qualified as incentive stock options immediately prior to the Effective
Time; and that notwithstanding anything contained in Section 1.6(d) or Section
6.5(a) hereof, or any other provision of this Agreement, the exercise price, the
number of shares purchasable and the terms and conditions applicable to any
Camitro Stock Options shall be determined so as to comply with Sections 422 and
424 of the Code and the regulations promulgated thereunder.

          (d)  ArQule will reserve sufficient shares of ArQule Common Stock for
issuance under Section 1.6(d) and Section 6.5(a) hereof.

     6.6  CAMITRO EMPLOYEE PLANS. From and after the Effective Time, and subject
to applicable law, ArQule shall either continue Camitro's welfare benefit plans
as in effect at the Effective Time or provide to employees who were employees of
Camitro at the Effective Time those welfare benefits provided to similarly
situated employees of ArQule. From and after the Effective Time, employees who
were employees of Camitro at the Effective Time shall, to the extent permitted
by applicable law, receive credit for service with Camitro (or other service
credited under Camitro's plans) for purposes of eligibility, vesting and benefit
levels (other than benefit accruals under any defined benefit pension plan)
under the ArQule welfare benefit and 401(k) plans, and all preexisting
conditions to which any such employees are subject shall be waived, and credit
toward deductibles shall be carried over, under ArQule's welfare benefit plans
to the extent permitted under the applicable plans. Nothing in this Agreement
shall be interpreted as preventing ArQule from amending, modifying or
terminating any Camitro or ArQule Employee Plan in accordance with its terms.

     6.7  ARQULE FORM S-8. To the extent necessary to avoid issuance of
"restricted securities," ArQule agrees to file a registration statement on Form
S-8 for the shares of ArQule Common Stock issuable with respect to the assumed

later than February 13, 2001 and shall keep such registration statement

prompt notice to Camitro, and Camitro will give prompt notice to ArQule, of the
occurrence, or failure to occur, of any event, which occurrence or failure to

this Agreement under this Section 8.1(e) shall not be available to any party

                                 INDEMNIFICATION

     9.1  SURVIVAL. Notwithstanding any right of any party to fully investigate
the affairs of the other party and notwithstanding any knowledge of facts
determined or determinable by such party pursuant to such investigation or right
of investigation, each party has the right to rely fully upon the
representations, warranties, covenants and agreements of each other party in
this Agreement or in any certificate, financial statement or other document
delivered by any party pursuant hereto. All such representations, warranties,
covenants and agreements shall survive

                                       33
<PAGE>   39

the execution and delivery hereof and the Closing hereunder, subject to the
limitations set forth in Section 9.4. No person shall have a right to recovery
against any party (or any officer, director, employee or agent of a party) other
than through the exercise of the indemnification rights set forth in Section
9.2, which shall constitute the sole and exclusive remedy after the Closing Date
for any breach by a party of any representation, warranty or covenant contained
herein or in any certificate or other instrument delivered pursuant hereto,
other than a fraudulent or intentional breach.

     9.2  OBLIGATION OF THE STOCKHOLDERS OF CAMITRO TO INDEMNIFY. After the
Effective Time, the stockholders of Camitro shall, jointly and severally,
indemnify and hold harmless ArQule and the Surviving Corporation (and their
respective directors, officers, employees, agents, affiliates and assigns) from
and against all losses, liabilities, damages, deficiencies, costs or expenses,
including interest and penalties imposed or assessed by any judicial or
administrative body and reasonable attorneys' fees, whether or not arising out
of third-party claims and including all amounts paid in investigation, defense
or settlement of the foregoing pursuant to this Article IX ("LOSSES") based
upon, arising out of or otherwise in respect of any breach of any
representation, warranty or covenant of Camitro or the Principal Stockholders
contained herein or in any certificate delivered pursuant hereto.

     9.3  OBLIGATION OF ARQULE TO INDEMNIFY. After the Effective Time, ArQule
agrees to indemnify and hold harmless the holders of the Camitro Stock
outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time (and their respective
directors, officers, employees, agents, affiliates and assigns) from and against
any Losses based upon, arising out of or otherwise in respect of any inaccuracy
in or breach of any representation, warranty or covenant of ArQule contained
herein or in any certificate delivered pursuant hereto.

     9.4  LIMITATIONS ON INDEMNIFICATION. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the
right to indemnification under this Article IX shall be subject to the following
terms:

          (a)  Except with respect to claims previously made but not then
resolved, no indemnification shall be payable pursuant to Section 9.2 or Section
9.3 after March 31, 2002.

          (b)  No indemnification shall be payable by a party pursuant to
Section 9.2 or 9.3 until the total of all Losses with respect to matters covered
by the respective section exceeds $250,000, whereupon indemnification will be
payable for the entire amount of such Losses.

          (c)  All indemnification claims under Section 9.2 shall be satisfied
only from the Merger Shares escrowed pursuant to Section 1.14 (the "ESCROW
ACCOUNT") and no person shall have any right to recovery from any person who was
a holder of Camitro Stock immediately before the Effective Time. All
indemnification claims under Section 9.3 shall be satisfied only to the extent
of the Market Value (as defined in Section 1.6(b)) of the Escrow Account.

          (d)  The limitations of Sections 9.4(a), (b), and (c) shall not apply
in the case of a fraudulent or intentional misrepresentation or breach by any
party, but no Camitro stockholder shall be liable for any such misrepresentation
or breach under Article III by any other Camitro stockholder.

                                       34
<PAGE>   40

     9.5  NOTICE AND DEFENSE OF CLAIMS. Less than ten (10) days after receipt of
notice of any claim or legal proceeding by a third party with respect to which a
party may seek indemnification hereunder, the receiving party shall give written
notice thereof to the indemnifying party (which, in the case of claims under
Section 9.2, shall be the Shareholder Representative (as defined in the Escrow
Agreement)), but such notification shall not be a condition to indemnification
hereunder except to the extent of actual prejudice to the indemnifying party.
The notice shall state the information then available regarding the amount and
nature of such claim, liability or expense and shall specify the provision or
provisions of this Agreement under which the liability or obligation is
asserted. If within 30 days after receiving such notice from the receiving party
the indemnifying party gives written notice to the indemnified party stating
that it intends to defend against such claim, liability or expense at its own
cost and expense, then defense of such matter, including selection of counsel
(subject to the consent of the indemnified party, which consent shall not be
unreasonably withheld), shall be by the indemnifying party and the indemnified
party shall make no payment on such claim, liability or expense as long as the
indemnifying party is conducting a good faith and diligent defense. The
indemnifying party shall not settle or compromise any such claim or liability
without the prior approval of the indemnified party, which shall not be
unreasonably withheld. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the indemnified party
shall at all times have the right to fully participate in such defense at its
own expense directly or through counsel; provided, however, if the named parties
to the action or proceeding include both the indemnifying party and the
indemnified party and representation of both parties by the same counsel would
be inappropriate under applicable standards of professional conduct, the expense
of separate counsel for the indemnified party shall be paid by the indemnifying
party. If no such notice of intent to dispute and defend is given by the
indemnifying party, or if such diligent good faith defense is not being or
ceases to be conducted, the indemnified party shall, at the expense of the
indemnifying party, undertake the defense of such claim, liability or expense
with counsel selected by the indemnified party, and shall have the right to
compromise or settle the same exercising reasonable business judgment. The
indemnified party shall make available all information and assistance that the
indemnifying party may reasonably request and shall cooperate with the
indemnifying party in such defense.

     9.6  SUBMISSION TO JURISDICTION. Each party hereby (a) submits to the
jurisdiction of any state or federal court sitting in the Commonwealth of
Massachusetts in any action or proceeding arising out of or relating to this
Agreement and (b) agrees that all claims in respect of such action or proceeding
may be heard and determined in any such court. Each party hereby waives any
defense of inconvenient forum to the maintenance of any action or proceeding so
brought and waives any bond, surety or other security that might be required of
the other party with respect thereto. Each party hereto shall accept service
made on him or it by sending or delivering a copy of the process to such party
at the address and in the manner provided for the giving of notices in this
Agreement. Nothing in this Section 9.6, however, shall affect the right of
either party to serve legal process in any other manner permitted by law.
