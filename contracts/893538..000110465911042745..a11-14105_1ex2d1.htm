 **THIS PURCHASE AND SALE AGREEMENT** (this " ** _Agreement_** ") is made as
of June 9, 2011 (the " ** _Execution Date_** ") among SM ENERGY COMPANY, a
Delaware corporation (" ** _SM_** "), STATOIL TEXAS ONSHORE PROPERTIES LLC, a
Delaware limited liability company (" ** _Statoil_** ") and TALISMAN ENERGY
USA INC., a Delaware corporation (" ** _Talisman_** ", together with Statoil
collectively, the " ** _Buyers_** ", and each individually, a " ** _Buyer_**
"). SM and Buyers shall sometimes be referred to herein together as the " **
_Parties_** ", and each individually as a " ** _Party_** ".

 



 

 **RECITALS**

 



 

 **WHEREAS** , SM owns certain oil and gas leases located in La Salle County
and Dimmit County, Texas and associated assets as more fully described below;
and

 



 

 **WHEREAS** , SM desires to sell and Buyers desire to purchase the Assets (as

 **NOW THEREFORE** , in consideration of the mutual agreements herein
contained, the Parties hereby agree as follows:

 **ARTICLE II 
PURCHASE AND SALE**

 



 

 ** _2.1 Purchase and Sale_**.

 



 

(a) Subject to the terms and conditions of this Agreement, Buyers agree to
purchase from SM, and SM agrees to sell, assign and deliver to the Buyers, the
Assets for the consideration specified in this _Article II_.

 



 

(b) SM shall reserve and retain all of the Excluded Assets.

 



 

 ** _2.2 Purchase Price_**. Subject to the other terms and conditions of this
Agreement, the purchase price for the Assets shall be two hundred and twenty-
five million dollars ($225,000,000) (the " ** _Purchase Price_** "). Subject
to the terms hereof, the Buyers shall be jointly and severally responsible for
the Purchase Price. The Purchase Price shall be payable as follows:

 



 

(a) On or before June 10, 2011, Buyers shall deposit with the Escrow Agent by
wire transfer in immediately available funds, to be held in escrow by the
Escrow Agent pending Closing pursuant to the terms of the Escrow Agreement,
the sum of $22,500,000 (such amount, together with any interest earned thereon
the " ** _Deposit_** ").

 



 

(b) At Closing, (i) the Parties shall jointly issue a written instruction to
the Escrow Agent to transfer the Deposit to SM, and (ii) Buyers shall pay the
Closing Amount to SM by wire transfer in immediately available funds.

 



 

(c) In the event of any termination of this Agreement, the Parties shall, in
each case, thereupon have the rights and obligations set forth in _Section
12.2_ and _Section 12.3_.

 



 

 ** _2.3 Adjustments to Purchase Price_**.

 



 

(a) For purposes of determining the amounts of the adjustments to the Purchase
Price provided for in this _Section 2.3_, the principles set forth in this
_Section 2.3(a) _shall apply. Except as otherwise adjusted for in _Sections
2.3(b) _and _2.3(c)_ , each Buyer shall be entitled to its Proportionate
Share of all production of Hydrocarbons from or attributable to the Units,
Leases and Wells at and after the Effective Time (and all products and
proceeds attributable thereto), and to its Proportionate Share of all other
income, proceeds, receipts and credits earned with respect to the Assets at or
after the Effective Time, and Buyers shall be responsible for (and entitled to
any refunds with respect to) all Operating Expenses incurred at and after the
Effective Time. Except as otherwise adjusted for in _Sections 2.3(b) _and
_2.3(c)_ , SM shall be entitled to all Hydrocarbon production from or
attributable to Units, Leases and Wells prior to the Effective Time (and all
products and proceeds attributable thereto), and to all other income,
proceeds, receipts and credits earned with respect to the Assets prior to the
Effective Time, and shall be responsible for (and entitled to any refunds with
respect to) all Operating Expenses incurred prior to the Effective Time.
"Earned" and "incurred", as used in the Agreement shall be interpreted in
accordance with GAAP and Council of Petroleum Accountants Society standards,
except as otherwise specified herein. For purposes of allocating production
(and proceeds and accounts receivable with respect thereto), under this
_Section 2.3_, (i) liquid Hydrocarbons shall be deemed to be " ** _from or
attributable to_** " the Units, Leases and Wells when

 



      
 

 



 

they pass through the pipeline connecting into the storage facilities into
which they are run and (ii) gaseous Hydrocarbons shall be deemed to be " **
_from or attributable to_** " the Units, Leases and Wells when they pass
through the royalty measurement meters, delivery point sales meters or custody
transfer meters on the gathering lines or pipelines through which they are
transported (whichever meter is closest to the well). SM shall utilize
reasonable interpolative procedures, consistent with industry practice, to
arrive at an allocation of production when exact meter readings or gauging and
strapping data are not available.

 



 

(b) The Purchase Price shall be adjusted upward by the following amounts
(without duplication):

 



 

(i) an amount equal to the value of all Hydrocarbons produced from or
attributable to the Assets in storage or existing in stock tanks, pipelines
and/or plants (including inventory) as of the Effective Time, the value to be
based upon the contract price in effect as of the Effective Time (or if there
is no contract price, then the market price in effect as of the Effective Time
in the field in which such Hydrocarbons were produced or if actually sold
prior to the date of determination, the proceeds actually recovered by SM
attributable to such sale), net of amounts payable as royalties, overriding
royalties and other burdens upon, measured by or payable out of such
production and Asset Taxes;

 



 

(ii) an amount equal to all Operating Expenses and other costs and expenses
paid by SM that are attributable to the Assets during the Interim Period,
whether paid before or after the Effective Time;

 



 

(iii) [RESERVED];

 



 

(iv) to the extent that SM is under-produced or has over-delivered into
pipelines (in each case) as of the Effective Time, as complete and final
settlement of all such Imbalances, to the extent attributable to the Assets,
the sum of $0.00;

 



 

(v) to the extent that Global Geophysical Services, Inc. has consented in
writing to the transfer of SMs rights with respect to the Data Agreement to
Buyers, an amount equal to $550,000; and

 



 

(vi) any other amount provided for elsewhere in this Agreement or otherwise
agreed upon by the Parties.

 



 

(c) The Purchase Price shall be adjusted downward by the following amounts
(without duplication):

 



 

(i) an amount equal to all proceeds actually received by SM attributable to
the sale of Hydrocarbons (A) produced from or attributable to the Assets
during the Interim Period or (B) contained in storage or existing in stock
tanks, pipelines and/or plants (including inventory) as of the Effective Time
for which an upward Purchase Price adjustment was made pursuant to _Section
2.3(b)_;

 



      
 

 



 

(ii) the aggregate Title Defect Amounts for all Title Defects for which the
Purchase Price is to be reduced pursuant to _Section 6.2_;

 



 

(iii) the aggregate Remediation Amounts for all Environmental Defects for
which the Purchase Price is to be reduced pursuant to _Section 7.1_;

 



 

(iv) an amount determined pursuant to _Section 6.4(a)_, _Section 6.4(b) _or
_Section 7.1(b)(iii)_, as applicable, for any Asset excluded from the
transaction contemplated hereby pursuant to such Sections;

 



 

(v) the value of any Casualty Loss pursuant to _Section 6.3(b)_;

 



 

(vi) to the extent that SM is over-produced or has under-delivered into
pipelines (in each case) as of the Effective Time, as complete and final
settlement of all such Imbalances, to the extent attributable to the Assets,
the sum of $0.00;

 



 

(vii) all funds for Burdens or other associated payments with respect to the
Assets that are being held in suspense by SM as of the Closing Date, if any;
and

 



 

(viii) any other amount provided for elsewhere in this Agreement or otherwise
agreed upon by the Parties.

 



 

 ** _2.4 Allocated Value_**. SM and Buyers have agreed upon an allocation of
the unadjusted Purchase Price as set forth on **_Exhibit A_** and **_Exhibit
B_** (the " ** _Allocated Value_** "). SM and Buyers agree that the Allocated
Values shall be used in calculating adjustments to the Purchase Price as
provided herein. Any adjustments to the Purchase Price, other than the
adjustments provided for in _Section 2.3_, shall be applied on a pro rata
basis to the amounts set forth in **_Exhibit A_** or **_Exhibit B_**, as
applicable, for all Assets. After all such adjustments are made, any
adjustments to the Purchase Price made pursuant to _Section 2.3 _shall be
applied to the amounts set forth on **_Exhibit A_** or **_Exhibit B_**, as
applicable, for the particular affected Assets. For tax purposes, except as
otherwise required by applicable Law, the Parties agree to report the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement in a manner consistent with the
terms of this Agreement, including the allocations set forth above as of the
Closing Date, and that neither Party will take any position inconsistent
therewith, including in any tax return, refund claim, litigation, arbitration,
or otherwise.

 



 

 ** _2.5 Settlement; Disputes_**.

 



 

(a) Not less than five (5) Business Days prior to the Closing, SM shall
prepare and submit to Buyers for review a draft settlement statement using the
best information available to SM (the " ** _Preliminary Settlement
Statement_** ") that shall set forth the adjusted Purchase Price reflecting
each adjustment made in good faith in accordance with this Agreement as of the
date of preparation of such Preliminary Settlement Statement. Within three (3)
Business Days of receipt of the Preliminary Settlement Statement, Buyers have
the right but not the obligation to deliver to SM a written report containing
all changes with the explanation therefor that Buyers propose to be made to
the Preliminary Settlement Statement. The Preliminary Settlement Statement, as
agreed upon by the Parties, will be used to adjust the Purchase Price at
Closing (such adjusted price, the " ** _Preliminary Purchase Price_** "). If
the Parties cannot agree on the

 



      
 

 



 

Preliminary Settlement Statement prior to the Closing, the Preliminary
Settlement Statement as presented by SM will be used to adjust the Purchase
Price at Closing.

 



 

(b) On or before one hundred and twenty (120) days after the Closing, a final
settlement statement (the " ** _Final Settlement Statement_** ") will be
prepared by SM, based on actual income and expenses during the Interim Period
and which takes into account all final adjustments made to the Purchase Price
and shows the resulting final adjusted Purchase Price (the " ** _Final
Purchase Price_** "). SM shall, at Buyers request, supply reasonable
documentation in its or its Affiliates possession available to support the
actual revenue, expenses and other items for which adjustments are made. The
Final Settlement Statement shall set forth the actual proration of the amounts
required by this Agreement. As soon as practicable, and in any event within
forty-five (45) days after receipt of the Final Settlement Statement, Buyers
have the right but not the obligation to return a written report containing
any proposed changes to the Final Settlement Statement and an explanation of
any such changes and the reasons therefor (the " ** _Dispute Notice_** ").
Buyers shall be deemed to have agreed to the Final Settlement Statement
delivered by SM if no Dispute Notice is delivered to SM within such forty-five
(45) day period. If the Final Purchase Price set forth in the Final Settlement

respective liabilities and obligations hereunder, and that neither Party
represents to the other Party that any particular tax treatment will be given
to any Party as a result thereof. The Party electing to assign all or any of
its rights under this Agreement pursuant to this _Section 2.6 _shall defend,
indemnify, and hold harmless each other Party and its Affiliates from all
claims relating to such election.

LIABILITIES ARISE OUT OF OR RESULT FROM, SOLELY OR IN PART, THE SOLE, ACTIVE,
PASSIVE, CONCURRENT OR COMPARATIVE NEGLIGENCE, STRICT LIABILITY OR OTHER FAULT
OR VIOLATION OF LAW OF OR BY A MEMBER OF THE SM INDEMNIFIED PARTIES, EXCEPTING
ONLY LIABILITIES ACTUALLY RESULTING ON THE ACCOUNT OF THE GROSS NEGLIGENCE OR
WILLFUL MISCONDUCT OF A MEMBER OF THE SM INDEMNIFIED PARTIES**.

 



 

(e) Buyers shall disclose to SM all portions of their final environmental
reports and test results prepared by any Third Party environmental consultants
for Buyers or any of their Affiliates (i) as may relate to any Environmental
Defect claimed in any Environmental Defect Notice or (ii) as may be required
to be disclosed by SM to any lessor under the terms of any applicable Lease.

expressed, implied or statutory as to the condition to the Assets or to the
accuracy of said documents or the information contained therein.

 



       
 

 



 

(f) Upon completion of the Buyers due diligence, Buyers shall, at their sole
cost and expense and without any cost or expense to SM or its Affiliates (i)
repair all physical damage done to the Assets in connection with the Buyers
due diligence, (ii) restore the Assets to the approximate same or better
physical condition in existence prior to commencement of the Buyers due
diligence, and (iii) remove all equipment, tools or other property brought
onto the Assets in connection with the Buyers due diligence. Any disturbance
to the Assets (including, without limitation, the real property associated
with such Assets) resulting from the Buyers due diligence will be promptly
corrected by the Buyers.

 



 

 ** _5.2 Buyer Confidentiality_**. Each Buyer acknowledges that, pursuant to
its right of access to the Records and the Assets, such Buyer will become
privy to confidential and other information of SM and that such confidential
information shall be held confidential by such Buyer and its Buyers
Representatives in accordance with the terms of the applicable Confidentiality
Agreement. If Closing should occur, the foregoing confidentiality restriction
on Buyers, including the Confidentiality Agreements, shall terminate (except
as to (a) any Assets that are excluded from the transactions contemplated
hereby pursuant to the provisions of this Agreement, (b) the Excluded Assets,

 **ARTICLE VI 
TITLE MATTERS; CASUALTIES**

 



 

 ** _6.1 SMs Title_**. Except for the special warranty of title as set forth
in the Assignment with respect to the Assets and without limiting Buyers
remedies for Title Defects set forth in this _Article VI_, SM makes no
warranty or representation, express, implied, statutory or otherwise with
respect to its title to any of the Assets and Buyers hereby acknowledge and
agree that Buyers sole remedy for any defect of title, including any Title
Defect, with respect to any of the Assets (a) on or before the Defect Claim
Date shall be as set forth in _Section 6.2_ and (b) without duplication, from
and after the Defect Claim Date, shall be pursuant to the special warranty of
title set forth in the Assignment, under _Section 13.2(a) _relating to any
breach by SM of _Section 3.7, 3.8, 3.10, 3.14_ or _3.18_ , and under _Section
13.2(b) _relating to any breach by SM of _Section 8.1(b)(vi)_.

 



 

 ** _6.2 Notice of Title Defects; Defect Adjustments_**.

 



 

(a) _Title Defect Notices_. On or before 4:00 p.m. (Mountain Time) on July 22,
2011 (the " ** _Defect Claim Date_** "), Buyers (jointly and not individually)
shall have the right but not the obligation to deliver notices to SM meeting
the requirements of this _Section 6.2(a) _(each, a " ** _Title Defect
Notice_** ") setting forth any matters which, in Buyers reasonable opinions,
constitute Title Defects and which Buyers intend to assert as a Title Defect
pursuant to this _Section 6.2_. For all purposes of this Agreement and
notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, but subject to Buyers rights
under _Section 13.2(a) _relating to any breach by SM of _Section 3.7, 3.8,
3.10, 3.14 _or _3.18_ _or under_ _Section 13.2(b) _relating to any breach by
SM of _Section 8.1(b)(vi) _ and under the special warranty of title set forth
in the Assignment, Buyers shall be deemed to have waived, and SM shall have no
liability for, any Title Defect that Buyers fail to assert as a Title Defect
pursuant to a Title Defect Notice delivered in compliance with this _Section
6.2(a) _and received by SM on or before the Defect Claim Date. To be
effective, each Title Defect Notice shall be in writing and shall include (i)
a description of the alleged Title Defect and the Assets affected by such
Title Defect (each a " ** _Title Defect Property_** "), (ii) the Allocated
Value of each Title Defect Property, (iii) supporting documents available to
Buyers reasonably necessary for SM to verify the existence of the alleged
Title Defect(s), (iv) the amount by which Buyers reasonably believe the
Allocated Value of each Title Defect Property is reduced by the alleged Title
Defect(s) and (v) the computations upon which Buyers beliefs are based. To
give SM an opportunity to commence reviewing and curing Title Defects, Buyers
agree to use reasonable efforts to give SM, on or before the end of each
calendar week prior to the Defect Claim Date, written notice of all alleged
Title Defects discovered by Buyers during the preceding calendar week, which
notice may be preliminary in nature and supplemented prior to the expiration
of the Defect Claim Date, provided that failure to provide preliminary notice
of a Title Defect shall not prejudice Buyers right to assert such Title
Defect hereunder. Buyers shall also promptly furnish SM with written notice of
any Title Benefit which is reported by any of Buyers employees or any Buyers
Representative while conducting Buyers due diligence with respect to the
Assets prior to the Defect Claim Date.

 



 

(b) _Title Benefit Notices_. SM shall have the right, but not the obligation,
to deliver to Buyers on or before the Defect Claim Date, a notice setting
forth any matters that, in SMs reasonable opinion, constitute Title Benefits
and that SM intends to assert as a Title

 



      
 

 



 

Benefit pursuant to this _Section 6.2_ (each, a " ** _Title Benefit Notice_**
") including (i) a description of the Title Benefit and the Assets affected by
the Title Benefit (the " ** _Title Benefit Property_** "), (ii) the amount by
which SM reasonably believes the Allocated Value of the Title Benefit Property
is increased by the Title Benefit, (iii) supporting documents available to SM
reasonably necessary for Buyers to verify the existence of the alleged Title
Benefit(s) and (iv) the computations upon which SMs belief is based. SM shall
be deemed to have waived all Title Benefits of which it, or Buyers pursuant to
_Section 6.2(a)_, has not given notice on or before the Defect Claim Date.

 



 

(c) _Remedies for Title Defects_. Subject to SMs continuing right to dispute
the existence of a Title Defect or the Title Defect Amount asserted with
respect thereto and subject to the Individual Title Defect Threshold and the
Aggregate Deductible, in the event that any Title Defect properly asserted by
Buyers in accordance with _Section 6.2(a) _is not waived in writing by Buyers
or cured on or before Closing, the Parties shall mutually elect to:

 



 

(i) have SM transfer, convey and assign the entirety of the Title Defect
Property that is subject to such Title Defect, together with all associated
Assets, to Buyers at Closing, and reduce the Purchase Price by the Title
Defect Amount;

 



 

(ii) have SM transfer, convey and assign the entirety of the Title Defect
Property that is subject to such Title Defect, together with all associated
Assets, to Buyers at Closing, in which event SM shall have the right, for a
period of sixty (60) days following the Closing Date (the " ** _Cure Period_**
"), to cure any Title Defect relating to such retained Title Defect Property,
and should SM cure such Title Defect during the Cure Period, then the Purchase
Price shall not be adjusted. If SM is unable to cure any such Title Defect
during the Cure Period, then the Purchase Price shall be reduced by an amount
equal to the Title Defect Amount; or

 



 

(iii) have SM transfer, convey and assign the entirety of the Title Defect
Property that is subject to such Title Defect, together with all associated
Assets, to Buyers at Closing, with an indemnity by SM in favor of Buyers for
all Liability resulting from such Title Defect with respect to the Assets
pursuant to an indemnity agreement mutually agreeable to the Parties.

 



 

In the event that the Parties do not agree in writing by the Closing on an
election of alternative (i), (ii) or (iii) above with respect to any Title
Defect properly asserted by Buyers in accordance with _Section 6.2(a)_, they
shall be deemed to have elected alternative (i), provided that if the
existence of a Title Defect or the Title Defect Amount asserted with respect
thereto is disputed, no adjustment to the Purchase Price shall be implemented
until the dispute is resolved pursuant to _Section 6.2(i)_. Any Title Defect
Amount that is resolved by the Parties after the Closing Date shall be paid by
SM to Buyers (in their Proportionate Shares) by wire transfer of immediately
available funds made within ten (10) days following such resolution.

 



 

(d) _Remedies for Title Benefits_. With respect to each Well or Lease affected
by Title Benefits reported under this _Section 6.2_, the aggregate Title
Defect Amounts shall be decreased by an amount equal to the increase in the
Allocated Value for such Asset caused by such Title Benefits, as determined
pursuant to _Section 6.2(g) _(the " ** _Title Benefit Amount_** ").

 



      
 

 



 

(e) _Exclusive Remedy_. Except for SMs special warranty of title under the
Assignment and Buyers rights under _Section 13.2(a) _relating to any breach
by SM of _Section 3.7, 3.8, 3.10, 3.14 _or _3.18_ or under _Section 13.2(b)
_relating to any breach by SM of _Section 8.1(b)(vi)_, the provisions set
forth in _Section 6.2(c) _shall be the exclusive right and remedy of Buyers
with respect to SMs failure to have Defensible Title with respect to any
Asset.

 



 

(f) _Title Defect Amount_. The amount by which the Allocated Value of the
affected Title Defect Property is reduced as a result of the existence of such
Title Defect shall be the " ** _Title Defect Amount_** " and shall be
determined in accordance with the following terms and conditions:

 



 

(i) if Buyers and SM agree on the Title Defect Amount, then that amount shall
be the Title Defect Amount;

 



 

(ii) if the Title Defect is an Encumbrance that is undisputed and liquidated
in amount, then the Title Defect Amount shall be the amount necessary to be
paid to remove the Title Defect from the Title Defect Property;

 



 

(iii) if the Title Defect represents a discrepancy between (A) the Net Revenue
Interest for any Title Defect Property and (B) the Net Revenue Interest for
such Title Defect Property stated in **_Exhibit B_**, and the Working
Interest attributable to such Title Defect Property has been reduced
proportionately, then the Title Defect Amount shall be the product of the
Allocated Value of such Title Defect Property multiplied by a fraction, the
numerator of which is the positive difference between such Net Revenue
Interest values, and the denominator of which is the Net Revenue Interest for
such Title Defect Property stated in **_Exhibit B_**;

 



 

(iv) if the Title Defect represents a discrepancy between (A) the Net Acres
for any Title Defect Property and (B) the Net Acres for such Title Defect
Property stated in **_Exhibit A_**, then the Title Defect Amount shall be an
amount equal to (x) a fraction, the numerator of which is the Allocated Value
attributable to such Title Defect Property and the denominator of which is the
number of Net Acres for such Title Defect Property stated in **_Exhibit A_**
multiplied by (y) such discrepancy between (I) the Net Acres for such Title
Defect Property stated in **_Exhibit A_** and (II) the Net Acres for any
Title Defect Property;

 



 

(v) if the Title Defect represents an obligation or Encumbrance upon or other
defect in title to the Title Defect Property of a type not described above,
including a Title Defect that represents a discrepancy between (A) the Net
Revenue Interest for any Title Defect Property and (B) the Net Revenue
Interest for such Title Defect Property stated in **_Exhibit B_**, and the
Working Interest attributable to such Title Defect Property has not been
reduced proportionately, the applicable Title Defect Amount shall be
determined by taking into account the Allocated Value of the Title Defect
Property, the portion of the Title Defect Property affected by the Title
Defect, the legal effect of the Title Defect, the potential economic effect of
the Title Defect over the life of the Title Defect Property, the values placed
upon the Title Defect by Buyers and

 



      
 

 



 

SM and such other reasonable factors as are necessary to make a proper
evaluation; provided, however, that if such Title Defect is reasonably capable
of being cured, the Title Defect Amount shall not be greater than the lesser
of (A) the reasonable cost and expense of curing such Title Defect and (B) the
Allocated Value of such Title Defect Property;

 



 

(vi) the Title Defect Amount with respect to a Title Defect Property shall be
determined without duplication of any costs or losses included in any other
Title Defect Amount hereunder; and

 



 

(vii) notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this _Article VI_, the
aggregate Title Defect Amounts attributable to the effects of all Title
Defects upon any single Title Defect Property shall not exceed the Allocated
Value of such Title Defect Property.

 



 

(g) _Title Benefit Amount_. The Title Benefit Amount resulting from a Title
Benefit shall be determined in accordance with the following methodology,
terms and conditions:

 



 

(i) if Buyers and SM agree on the Title Benefit Amount, then that amount shall
be the Title Benefit Amount;

 



 

(ii) if the Title Benefit represents an increase between (A) the Net Revenue
Interest for any Title Benefit Property and (B) the Net Revenue Interest for
such Title Benefit Property stated in **_Exhibit B_**, and the Working
Interest has increased proportionately, then the Title Benefit Amount shall be
the product of the Allocated Value of such Title Benefit Property multiplied
by a fraction, the numerator of which is the positive difference between such
Net Revenue Interest values, and the denominator of which is the Net Revenue
Interest for such Title Benefit Property stated in **_Exhibit B_**, provided
that if the Net Revenue increase does not affect the Title Benefit Property
throughout its entire life, the Title Benefit Amount determined under this
_Section 6.2(g) _shall be reduced to take into account the applicable time
period only;

 



 

(iii) if the Title Benefit represents an increase between (A) the Net Acres
for any Title Benefit Property and (B) the Net Acres for such Title Benefit
Property stated in **_Exhibit A_**, then the Title Benefit Amount shall be an
amount equal to (x) a fraction, the numerator of which is the Allocated Value
attributable to such Title Benefit Property and the denominator of which is
the number of Net Acres for such Title Benefit Property stated in **_Exhibit
A_** multiplied by (y) such discrepancy between (I) the Net Acres for such
Title Benefit Property stated in **_Exhibit A_** and (II) the Net Acres for
any Title Benefit Property, provided that if the Net Acre increase does not
affect the Title Benefit Property throughout its entire life, the Title
Benefit Amount determined under this _Section 6.2(g) _shall be reduced to
take into account the applicable time period only;

 



 

(iv) if the Title Benefit is of a type not described above, then the
applicable Title Benefit Amount shall be determined by taking into account the
Allocated Value of the Title Benefit Property, the portion of the Title
Benefit Property affected by

 



      
 

 



 

such Title Benefit, the legal effect of the Title Benefit, the potential
economic effect of the Title Benefit over the life of such Title Benefit
Property, the values placed upon the Title Benefit by Buyers and SM and such
other reasonable factors as are necessary to make a proper evaluation; and

 



 

(v) the Title Benefit Amount with respect to a Title Benefit Property shall be
determined without duplication of any items or amounts included in any other
Title Benefit Amount hereunder.

 



 

(h) _Title Threshold and Deductibles_. Notwithstanding anything to the
contrary, in no event shall there be any adjustments to the Purchase Price or
other remedies provided by SM hereunder or under the Assignment: (i) for any
individual Title Defect for which the Title Defect Amount, or any Subject
Special Warranty Claim the amount of which, in either case, does not exceed
the Individual Title Defect Threshold and (ii) for any Title Defect for which
the Title Defect Amount or Subject Special Warranty Claim the amount of which,
in either case, exceeds the Individual Title Threshold unless the sum of (A)
the aggregate Title Defect Amounts of all such Title Defects that exceed the
Individual Title Defect Threshold (excluding any Title Defect Amounts
attributable to Title Defects cured by SM), _plus_ (B) the aggregate
Remediation Amounts of all Environmental Defects that exceed the Individual
Environmental Threshold (excluding any Remediation Amounts attributable to
Environmental Defects cured by SM or Environmental Defect Properties retained
by SM pursuant to _Section 7.1(b)(iii)_), _plus_ (C) the aggregate amount of
all Subject Special Warranty Claims that exceed the Individual Title Defect
Threshold (excluding the amounts of any Subject Special Warranty Claims cured
by SM), exceeds one and a half percent (1.5%) of the unadjusted Purchase Price
(the " ** _Aggregate Deductible_** "), after which point Buyers shall be
entitled to, as applicable, adjustments to the Purchase Price only with
respect to such Title Defects in excess of the Aggregate Deductible or Subject
Special Warranty Claims against SM under the Assignment pursuant to the
special warranty of title contained therein, but in each case only with
respect to Title Defect Amounts or Subject Special Warranty Claims amounts
which in the aggregate are in excess of the Aggregate Deductible (after the
consideration of the other amounts applied against the Aggregate Deductible).

 



 

(i) _Title Dispute Resolution_. SM and Buyers shall attempt to agree on all
Title Defects, Title Benefits, Title Defect Amounts and Title Benefit Amounts
prior to Closing. If SM and Buyers are unable to agree on any such matter by
Closing, the matter in Dispute shall be exclusively and finally resolved
pursuant to this _Section 6.2(i)_. There shall be a single arbitrator, who
shall be a title attorney with at least 10 years experience in oil and gas
title matters involving properties in the regional area in which the Assets at
the center of the Dispute are located, as selected by mutual agreement of
Buyers and SM within fifteen (15) days after any Party invokes the provisions
of this _Section 6.2(i) _to resolve such Dispute, and absent such agreement,
by the Houston office of the AAA (the " ** _Title Arbitrator_** "). The Title
Arbitrator shall not have worked as an employee or performed more than $25,000
of work as outside counsel for any Party or its Affiliates during the five
year period preceding the arbitration or have any financial interest in the
dispute. The arbitration proceeding shall be held in Houston, Texas and shall
be conducted in accordance with the AAA Rules to the extent such rules do not
conflict with the terms of this _Section 6.2(i)_. The Title Arbitrators
determination shall be made within twenty (20) days after submission by the
Parties of the matters in Dispute and shall be final and

 



      
 

 



 

binding upon both Parties, without right of appeal. In making his
determination, the Title Arbitrator shall be bound by the rules set forth in
_Section 6.2(f) _and _Section 6.2(g) _and, subject to the foregoing, may
consider such other matters as in the opinion of the Title Arbitrator are
necessary to make a proper determination. The Title Arbitrator, however, may
not award (a) Buyers a greater Title Defect Amount than the Title Defect
Amount claimed by Buyers in the applicable Title Defect Notice (which such
Title Defect Amount shall not exceed the Allocated Value of the applicable
Title Defect Property) or (b) SM a greater Title Benefit Amount than the Title
Benefit Amount claimed by SM in the applicable Title Benefit Notice. The Title
Arbitrator shall act as an expert for the limited purpose of determining the
specific disputed Title Defect, Title Benefit, Title Defect Amount or Title
Benefit Amount submitted by any Party and may not award damages, interest or
penalties to any Party with respect to any Dispute. SM and Buyers shall each
bear its/their own legal fees and other costs of presenting its case to the
Title Arbitrator. SM shall bear one-half, and Buyers shall bear one-half, of
the costs and expenses of the Title Arbitrator. Any judgment of the award of
the Title Arbitrator may be entered and enforced by any court of competent
jurisdiction. To the extent that the award of the Title Arbitrator with
respect to any Title Defect Amount was not taken into account as an adjustment
to the Purchase Price or the aggregate Title Defect Amounts, as applicable at
Closing pursuant to pursuant to _Section 2.3_ and an adjustment would
otherwise be required under the provisions of _Section 6.2(c) _and _Section
6.2(d)_, as applicable, then, within ten (10) days after the Title Arbitrator
delivers written notice to Buyers and SM of its award with respect to such
Title Defect Amount or a Title Benefit Amount and subject to _Section
6.2(h)_, any Party required to make a payment to effect such award shall make
such payment by wire transfer in immediately available funds.

 



 

 ** _6.3 Casualty or Condemnation Loss_**.

 



 

(a) Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, from and after the
Effective Time, if Closing occurs, Buyers shall assume all risk of loss with
respect to (i) production of Hydrocarbons from the Assets through normal
depletion (including watering out of any well, collapsed casing or sand
infiltration of any well) and (ii) the depreciation of personal property due
to ordinary wear and tear and, in each case, Buyers shall not assert such
matters as Casualty Losses or Title Defects hereunder.

 



 

(b) If, from and after the Effective Time but prior to the Closing Date, any
portion of the Assets is damaged or destroyed by fire or other casualty or is
taken in condemnation or under right of eminent domain (a " ** _Casualty
Loss_** "), and the resulting loss from such Casualty Loss exceeds $50,000
based on the Allocated Value of the affected Assets, then (i) Buyers shall
nevertheless be required to close the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement and (ii) SM shall elect by written notice to Buyers prior to Closing
to either (A) cause, at SMs sole cost and as promptly as reasonably
practicable (which work may extend after the Closing Date), each Asset
affected by such Casualty Loss to be repaired or restored to at least its
condition prior to such casualty or taking, or (B) reduce the Purchase Price
by the cost to repair or restore each Asset affected by such Casualty Loss to
at least its condition prior to such casualty or taking. In each case, SM
shall retain all rights to insurance, condemnation awards and other claims
against Third Parties with respect to the casualty or taking except to the
extent the Parties otherwise agree in writing.

 



      
 

 



 

 ** _6.4 Preferential Rights and Consents to Assign_**.

 



 

(a) _Preferential Rights_.

 



 

(i) With respect to each Preferential Right pertaining to an Asset and the
transactions contemplated hereby, SM, within 10 days after the Execution Date,
shall send to the holder of each such Preferential Right a notice, in material
compliance with the contractual provisions applicable to such Preferential
Right, requesting a waiver of such right. Any Preferential Right must be
exercised subject to all terms and conditions set forth in this Agreement,
including the successful closing of this Agreement pursuant to _Article XI_.
The consideration payable under this Agreement for any particular Asset for
purposes of Preferential Right notices shall be the Allocated Value of such
Asset.

 



 

(ii) All Assets burdened by Preferential Rights for which (A) the applicable
Preferential Right has been waived, or (B) the period to exercise such
Preferential Right has expired prior to the Closing without the applicable
holder of such Preferential Right electing to enforce its Preferential Right,
shall, in each case, be assigned to Buyers at the Closing pursuant to the
provisions of this Agreement.

 



 

(iii) If, prior to the Closing (A) any holder of a Preferential Right notifies
SM that it intends to consummate the purchase of the portion of the Assets to
which its Preferential Right applies or (B) the time for exercising a
Preferential Right has not expired and the holder of such Preferential Right
has not waived such Preferential Right, then, in each case, such portion of
the Assets affected by such Preferential Right shall be excluded from the
Assets to be conveyed to Buyers at Closing and the Purchase Price shall be
reduced by the Allocated Value of such excluded portion of the Assets. SM
shall be entitled to all proceeds paid by a Person exercising a Preferential
Right prior to the Closing. If, after Closing (1) such holder of such
Preferential Right thereafter fails to consummate the purchase of the portion
of the Assets covered by such Preferential Right or (2) the time for
exercising such Preferential Right expires without exercise by the holder
thereof, then SM shall (x) so notify Buyers and (y) on or before 10 days
following delivery of such notice, assign such portion of the Assets to Buyers
pursuant to an assignment in substantially the form of the Assignment and the
Purchase Price shall be increased by an amount equal to the Allocated Value of
the such portion of the Assets.

 



 

(b) _Consents_. Except with respect to the Consents required for the
Transportation Contracts which are addressed in _Section 8.5_, SM, within 10
days after the Execution Date, shall send to each holder of a Consent a notice
seeking such holders consent to the transactions contemplated hereby.

 



 

(i) If (A) SM fails to obtain a Consent prior to Closing and the failure to
obtain such Consent would cause (1) the assignment to Buyers of any portion of
the Assets to be void or (2) the termination of a Lease under the express
terms thereof or (B) a Consent requested by SM is denied in writing, then, in
each case, that portion of the Assets affected by such Consent shall be
excluded from the Assets to be conveyed to Buyers at Closing and the Purchase
Price shall be reduced by the Allocated Value of such portion of the Assets.
In the event that a Consent that was not obtained prior to Closing

 



      
 

 



 

is obtained within one hundred and twenty (120) days following Closing or the
requirement to obtain such Consent is waived by Buyers then, within 10 days
after such Consent is obtained or the requirement to obtain such Consent is
waived by Buyers, (x) SM shall assign such excluded portion of the Assets to
Buyers pursuant to an assignment in substantially the form of the Assignment
(and if the requirement to obtain a Consent is waived by Buyers, Buyers shall
have no claim against, and SM shall have no Liability for, the failure to
obtain such Consent), and (y) Buyers shall pay to SM by wire transfer of
immediately available funds an amount equal to the amount by the Allocated
Value of such portion of the Assets so assigned. Notwithstanding the
foregoing, on the earlier to occur of (i) the 120th day following the Closing
Date (which may be extended for up to 10 days in the event a Consent is
obtained within the final 10 days of such 120 day period) and (ii) a Consent
being denied in writing, SM shall have no obligation to convey the portion of
the Assets affected by such Consent to Buyers and Buyers shall have no
obligation to pay the Allocated Value of such Assets to SM.

 



 

(ii) If (A) SM fails to obtain a Consent prior to Closing and the failure to
obtain such Consent would not cause (1) the assignment to Buyers of any
portion of the Assets to be void or (2) the termination of a Lease under the
express terms thereof and (B) such Consent requested by SM is not denied in
writing, then that portion of the Assets subject to such Consent shall be
assigned by SM to Buyers at Closing pursuant to the Assignment and Buyers
shall have no claim against, and SM shall have no Liability for, the failure
to obtain such Consent.

 



 

(iii) From and after the Execution Date up to Closing, SM shall use its
commercially reasonable efforts to obtain, and Buyers shall use their
commercially reasonable efforts to cooperate with SM in obtaining all Consents
(excluding any Customary Post-Closing Consents). In the event any Consent of
the type identified in _Section 6.4(b)(ii) _is not obtained on or before
Closing, for a period not to exceed 90 days after Closing, the Parties shall
cooperate with each other in obtaining all such remaining Consents. In no
event shall any Party be required to incur any Liability or pay any money in
order to obtain any Consent.

 



 

 **ARTICLE VII 
ENVIRONMENTAL MATTERS**

 



 

 ** _7.1 Environmental Defects_**.

 



 

(a) _Environmental Defects Notice_. On or before the Defect Claim Date, Buyers
(jointly and not individually) shall have the right, but not the obligation,
to deliver notices to SM meeting the requirements of this _Section 7.1(a)
_(each, an " ** _Environmental Defect Notice_** ") setting forth any matters
that, in Buyers reasonable opinions, constitute Environmental Defects and
that Buyers intend to assert as Environmental Defects pursuant to this
_Section 7.1_. ** **For all purposes of this Agreement, but subject to
Buyers rights under _Section 13.2(a) _for a breach of _Section 3.13 _by SM,
Buyers rights under _Section 13.2(b) _for a breach of _Section 8.1(a) _or
_8.1(b)_ , or Buyers rights under _Section 13.2(d)_, Buyers shall be deemed
to have waived any Environmental Defect that Buyers fail to properly assert as
an Environmental Defect pursuant to an Environmental Defect Notice delivered
in accordance with this _Section 7.1(a) _and received by

 



       
 

 



 

SM on or before the Defect Claim Date. To be effective, each Environmental
Defect Notice shall be in writing and shall include (i) a description of the
Environmental Condition constituting the alleged Environmental Defect, (ii)
each Asset (or portion thereof) affected by the alleged Environmental Defect
(the " ** _Environmental Defect Property_** "), (iii) supporting documents
available to Buyers reasonably necessary for SM to verify the existence of the
alleged Environmental Defect, (iv) the amount Buyers reasonably believe is the
Remediation Amount with respect to such Environmental Defect and (v) the
computations upon which Buyers beliefs are based. SM shall have the right,
but not the obligation, to cure any claimed Environmental Defect on or before
Closing. To give SM an opportunity to commence reviewing and curing
Environmental Defects, Buyers agree to use reasonable efforts to give SM, on
or before the end of each calendar week prior to the Defect Claim Date,
written notice of all alleged Environmental Defects discovered by Buyers
during the preceding calendar week, which notice may be preliminary in nature
and supplemented prior to the expiration of the applicable Defect Claim Date,
provided that failure to provide preliminary notice of an Environmental Defect
shall not prejudice Buyers rights to assert such Environmental Defect
hereunder.

 



 

(b) _Remedies for Environmental Defects_. Subject to SMs continuing right to
dispute the existence of an Environmental Defect or the Remediation Amount
asserted with respect thereto and subject to the Individual Environmental
Threshold and the Aggregate Deductible, in the event that any Environmental
Defect timely asserted by Buyers in accordance with _Section 7.1(a) _is not
waived in writing by Buyers or cured on or before Closing, the Parties shall
mutually elect to:

 



 

(i) reduce the Purchase Price by the Remediation Amount for such Environmental
Defect;

 



 

(ii) have SM assume responsibility for the Remediation of such Environmental
Defect;

 



 

(iii) have SM retain the entirety of the Environmental Defect Property subject
to such Environmental Defect, together with all associated Assets, and reduce
the Purchase Price by an amount equal to the Allocated Value of the
Environmental Defect Property and associated Assets; or

 



 

(iv) indemnify Buyers against all Liability resulting from such Environmental
Defect with respect to the Assets pursuant to an indemnity agreement in a form
mutually agreeable to the Parties.

 



 

If the Parties elect the option set forth in clause (i) above, each Buyer
shall be deemed to have assumed responsibility, severally and not jointly, for
its Proportionate Share of all costs and expenses attributable to the
Remediation of the applicable Environmental Defect (net to the Assets) and all
Liabilities (net to the Assets) with respect thereto, and each Buyers
obligations with respect to the foregoing shall be deemed to constitute part
of the Assumed Obligations. If the Parties elect the option set forth in
clause (ii) above, SM shall use its reasonable efforts to implement such
Remediation in a manner that is consistent with the requirements of
Environmental Laws in a timely fashion for the type of Remediation that SM
elects to undertake. SM will be deemed to have adequately completed the
Remediation required in the immediately

 



      
 

 



 

preceding sentence at such time that the Remediation has been implemented to
the extent necessary to comply with existing regulatory requirements. In the
event that the Parties do not agree in writing by the Closing on an election
of alternative (i), (ii), (iii) or (iv) above with respect to any
Environmental Defect properly asserted by Buyers in accordance with _Section
7.1(a)_, then (A) if the Remediation Amount is less than the Allocated Value
of the affected Environmental Defect Property, then the Parties shall be
deemed to have elected alternative (i) as the remedy and (B) if the
Remediation Amount is greater than the Allocated Value of the affected
Environmental Defect Property, then SM may elect alternative (iii) as the
remedy, provided that if SM does not elect alternative (iii), the Parties
shall be deemed to have elected alternative (i) as the remedy.

 



 

(c) _Exclusive Remedy_. Subject to Buyers remedy for a breach of SMs
representation contained in _Section 3.13_ (and claims under _Section
13.2(a) _with respect thereto), Buyers rights under __Section 13.2(b)_ _for
breaches of _Section 8.1(a) _or _8.1(b) _and Buyers rights under _Section
13.2(d)_, _Section 7.1(b) _shall be the exclusive right and remedy of Buyers
with respect to any Environmental Defect.

 



 

(d) _Environmental Threshold and Deductibles_. Notwithstanding anything to the
contrary, in no event shall there be any adjustments to the Purchase Price or
other remedies provided by SM for (i) any individual Environmental Defect for
which the Remediation Amount does not exceed $50,000 (" ** _Individual
Environmental Threshold_** "), or (ii) any Environmental Defect for which the
Remediation Amount exceeds the Individual Environmental Threshold, unless the
sum of (A) the aggregate Remediation Amounts of all such Environmental Defects
that exceed the Individual Environmental Threshold (excluding any Remediation
Amounts attributable to (1) Environmental Defects cured by SM or (2)
Environmental Defect Properties that SM retains pursuant to _Section
7.1(b)(iii)_), _plus_ (B) the aggregate Title Defect Amounts of all Title
Defects that exceed the Individual Title Defect Threshold (excluding any Title
Defect Amounts attributable to Title Defects cured by SM), exceeds the
Aggregate Deductible, after which point Buyer shall only be entitled to
adjustments to the Purchase Price with respect to such Environmental Defects
in excess of the Aggregate Deductible. For the avoidance of doubt, if SM
retains any Asset pursuant to _Section 7.1(b)(iii)_, the Purchase Price shall
be reduced by the Allocated Value of such retained Asset and the Remediation
Amount for the Environmental Defect relating to such retained Asset will not
be counted towards the Aggregate Deductible (after the consideration of the
other amounts applied against the Aggregate Deductible).

 



 

(e) _Environmental Dispute Resolution_. SM and Buyers shall attempt to agree
on all Environmental Defects and Remediation Amounts prior to Closing. If SM
and Buyers are unable to agree on any such matter by Closing, any
Environmental Defects or Remediation Amounts in Dispute will be exclusively
and finally resolved by arbitration pursuant to this _Section 7.1(e)_. There
will be a single arbitrator, who must be an environmental attorney with at
least ten (10) years experience in environmental matters involving oil and
gas properties in the regional area in which the applicable Environmental
Defect Properties are located, as selected by mutual agreement of Buyers and
SM within fifteen (15) days after any Party invokes the provisions of this
_Section 7.1(e) _to resolve such Dispute, and absent such agreement, by the
Houston office of the AAA (the " ** _Environmental Arbitrator_** "). The
Environmental Arbitrator shall not have worked as an employee or performed
more than $25,000 of Work as outside counsel for any Party or its Affiliates
during the five (5) year period preceding the arbitration or

 



      
 

 



 

have any financial interest in the dispute. The arbitration proceeding will be
held in Houston, Texas and conducted in accordance with the AAA Rules to the
extent such rules do not conflict with the terms of this _Section 7.1(e)_.
The Environmental Arbitrators determination must be made within twenty (20)
days after submission of the matters in Dispute and shall be final and binding
upon both Parties, without right of appeal. In making its determination, the
Environmental Arbitrator shall be bound by the rules set forth in this
_Section 7.1_ and, subject to the foregoing, may consider such other matters
as in the opinion of the Environmental Arbitrator are necessary or helpful to
make a proper determination. The Environmental Arbitrator, however, may not
award Buyers a greater Remediation Amount than the Remediation Amount claimed
by Buyers in the applicable Environmental Defect Notice, nor may the
Environmental Arbitrator award Buyers a lesser Remediation Amount than the
Remediation Amount proposed by SM. The Environmental Arbitrator will act as an
expert for the limited purpose of determining the specific disputed
Environmental Defects and/or Remediation Amounts submitted by either Party and
may not award damages, interest or penalties to either Party with respect to
any matter. SM and Buyers shall each bear their own legal fees and other costs
of presenting its case. SM shall bear one-half, and Buyers shall bear one-
half, of the costs and expenses of the Environmental Arbitrator. Any judgment
of the award of the Environmental Arbitrator may be entered and enforced by
any court of competent jurisdiction. To the extent that the award of the
Environmental Arbitrator with respect to any Remediation Amount is not taken
into account as an adjustment to the Purchase Price at Closing pursuant to
_Section 2.3_ and Buyers would otherwise be entitled to an adjustment under
the provisions of _Section 7.1(b)_, then, within ten (10) days after the
Environmental Arbitrator delivers written notice to Buyers and SM of such
award and subject to _Section 7.1(d)_, any Party required to make a payment
to effect such award shall make such payment.

 



 

 ** _7.2 NORM, Wastes and Other Substances_**. Buyers acknowledge that the
Assets have been used for exploration, development and production of oil and
gas and that there may be petroleum, produced water, wastes or other
substances or materials located in, on or under or associated with the Assets.
Equipment and sites included in the Assets may contain asbestos, NORM or other
Hazardous Substances. NORM may affix or attach itself to the inside of wells,
materials and equipment as scale, or in other forms. The wells, materials and
equipment located on the Assets or included in the Assets may contain NORM and
other wastes or Hazardous Substances. NORM containing material or other wastes
or Hazardous Substances may have come in contact with various environmental
media, including without limitation, water, soils or sediment. Special
procedures may be required for the assessment, remediation, removal,
transportation or disposal of environmental media, wastes, asbestos, NORM and
other Hazardous Substances from the Assets.

_(the " ** _Transportation Contracts_** ") to assign to Buyers the proportions
of the rights and obligations arising under those Transportation Contracts

 **ARTICLE X 
TAX MATTERS**

 



 

 ** _10.1 Asset Tax Liability_**. Subject to the treatment of ad valorem Taxes
provided below, all Asset Taxes shall be allocated between Buyers (on the one
hand) and SM (on the other hand) as of the Effective Time for all taxable
periods that include the Effective Time as set forth in this _Section 10.1_.
Likewise, this _Section 10.1_ shall control the determination of the portion
of the Assets Taxes that constitute Operating Expenses properly allocable to
the period from and after the Effective Time and to the Interim Period for the
purpose of _Section 2.3_ and all other sections of this Agreement for a
taxable period that includes the Effective Time or the Closing Date. However,
no liability for Asset Taxes pursuant to this _Section 10.1_ shall duplicate
an adjustment to the Purchase Price made pursuant to _Section 2.3_ or any
other provision of this Agreement. All Asset Taxes that are not ad valorem
taxes, such as severance and production taxes, shall be allocated to SM to the
extent they relate to production prior to the Effective Time and to the Buyers
(in accordance with their respective Proportionate Share) to the extent they
relate to production on or after the Effective Time (i.e., based upon the
number of units or value of production actually produced and sold, as
applicable, on or after the Effective Date). Ad valorem Taxes for each
assessment period that includes the Effective Date shall be allocated to SM
based on the percentage of the assessment period occurring before the
Effective Time and to the Buyers (in accordance with their respective
Proportionate Shares) based on the percentage of the assessment period
occurring on or after the Effective Time (determined through daily proration).
Each Party shall promptly furnish to the other copies of any Asset Tax
assessments and statements (or invoices therefor from the operator of the
Assets) received by it to the extent such assessment, statement, or invoice
relates to an Asset Tax allocable to the other Party under this _Section
10.1_. Each Party shall timely pay all Asset Taxes subject to allocation under
this

 



      
 

 



 

Section and shall furnish to the other Party evidence of such payment. The
Parties shall estimate all Asset Taxes asserted against it that are
attributable to the ownership or operation of the Assets to the extent they
relate to the period on and after the Effective Time and through the Closing
Date and all Subject Transfer Taxes and incorporate such estimates into the
Preliminary Settlement Statement. The actual amounts (to the extent the actual
amounts differ from the estimates included in the Preliminary Settlement
Statement and are known at the time of the Final Settlement Statement) shall
be accounted for in the Final Settlement Statement. If the actual amounts are
not known at the time of the Final Settlement Statement, the amounts shall be
re-estimated based on the best information available at the time of the Final
Settlement Statement. When the actual amounts are known, Buyers (on the one
hand) or SM shall make such payments to the other (if any) as are necessary to
effect the allocation of Taxes described in this _Section 10.1_.

 



 

 ** _10.2 Transfer Taxes_**. All sales, use or other similar taxes, duties,
levies, recording fees or other governmental charges (but, for the avoidance
of doubt, not including any Asset Taxes, Franchise Tax Liability, or Income
Tax Liability), if any, incurred by or imposed with respect to the property
transfers undertaken pursuant to this Agreement (" ** _Subject Transfer
Taxes_** "), if any, shall be the responsibility of, and shall be paid by, the
Buyers (in accordance with their respective Proportionate Shares). The Parties
shall reasonably cooperate in taking steps that would minimize or eliminate
any Subject Transfer Taxes. Buyers agree to file all Subject Transfer Tax
Returns relating to such Subject Transfer Taxes.

 



 

 ** _10.3 Asset Tax Reports and Returns_**. For Asset Tax periods in which the
Effective Time occurs, SM agrees to immediately forward to Buyers copies of
any Asset Tax reports and Tax Returns received or filed by SM after Closing
and provide Buyers with any information SM has that is reasonably necessary
for Buyers to file any required Tax Return related to the Asset Taxes provided
that SM shall not file any such Tax Return without the consent of the Buyers,
which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld or delayed. Buyers agree to
file all Tax Returns and reports applicable to the Assets that Buyers are
required to file after the Closing and, subject to the provisions of _Section
10.1_, to pay all required Asset Taxes payable with respect to the Assets.

 



 

 ** _10.4 Tax Cooperation_**. Buyers and SM shall cooperate fully as and to
the extent reasonably requested by the other party, in connection with the
filing of any Tax Returns and any audit, litigation or other proceeding (each,
a " ** _Tax Proceeding_** ") with respect to Taxes relating to or in
connection with the Assets. Such cooperation shall include the retention and
(upon the other Partys request) the provision of such records and information
which are reasonably relevant to any such Tax Return or Tax Proceeding and
making employees available on a mutually convenient basis to provide
additional information and explanation of any material provided hereunder.

 



 

 **ARTICLE XI 
CLOSING**

 



 

 ** _11.1 Date of Closing_**. Subject to the conditions stated in this
Agreement, the transfer by SM and the acceptance by Buyers of the Assets (the
" ** _Closing_** ") shall occur on August 2, 2011 or, if all conditions to
Closing in _Article IX_ (other than those conditions that are only capable of

 



      
 

 



 

being satisfied at the Closing) have not yet been satisfied or waived by that
date, five (5) Business Days after such conditions have been satisfied or
waived, or such other date as Buyers and SM may agree upon in writing. The
date when Closing actually occurs shall be the " ** _Closing Date_** _._ "

 



 

 ** _11.2 Place of Closing_**. Closing shall be held at the offices of Vinson
and Elkins, LLP, 1001 Fannin Street, Suite 2500, Houston, Texas 77002, or such

warranties of a Buyer that are qualified by materiality, the failure of such

(a) Neither Party shall have any liability for any indemnification under

 ** _13.6_** ** _ _****_Exclusive Remedy for Agreement_**. Notwithstanding
anything to the contrary contained in this Agreement, from and after Closing,
_Section 5.1(d)_, _Section 13.2_ and _Section 13.3_ contain the Parties

Agreement and the affirmations of such representations, warranties, covenants

 ** _13.7_** ** _ _****_Indemnification Procedures_**. All claims for
indemnification under _Section 5.1(d)_, _Section 13.2_ and _Section 13.3_
shall be asserted and resolved as follows:

 



      
 

 



 

(a) For purposes of this _Article XIII_, the term " ** _Indemnifying Party_**
", when used in connection with particular Liabilities, shall mean the Party
having an obligation to indemnify another Party or Person(s) with respect to
such Liabilities pursuant to this _Article XIII_, and the term " **
_Indemnified Party_** ", when used in connection with particular Liabilities,
shall mean the Party or Person(s) having the right to be indemnified with
respect to such Liabilities by another Party pursuant to this _Article XIII_.

 



 

(b) To make claim for indemnification under _Section 5.1(d)_, _Section 13.2_
or _Section 13.3_, an Indemnified Party shall notify the Indemnifying Party
of its claim under this _Section 13.7_, including the specific details of and
specific basis under this Agreement for its claim (the " ** _Claim Notice_**
"). In the event that the claim for indemnification is based upon a claim by a
Third Party against the Indemnified Party (a " ** _Third Party_** **_Claim_**
"), the Indemnified Party shall provide its Claim Notice promptly after the
Indemnified Party has actual knowledge of the Third Party Claim and shall
enclose a copy of all papers (if any) served with respect to the Third Party
Claim; provided that the failure of any Indemnified Party to give notice of a
Third Party Claim as provided in this _Section_ _13.7_ shall not relieve the
Indemnifying Party of its obligations under _Section 5.1(d)_, _Section 13.2_
or _Section 13.3_ (as applicable) except to the extent such failure results
in insufficient time being available to permit the Indemnifying Party to
effectively defend against the Third Party Claim or otherwise materially
prejudices the Indemnifying Partys ability to defend against the claim. In
the event that the claim for indemnification is based upon an inaccuracy or
breach of a representation, warranty, covenant or agreement, the Claim Notice
shall specify the representation, warranty, covenant or agreement that was
inaccurate or breached.

 



 

(c) In the case of a claim for indemnification based upon a Third Party Claim,
the Indemnifying Party shall have thirty (30) days from its receipt of the
Claim Notice to notify the Indemnified Party whether it admits or denies its
obligation to defend the Indemnified Party against such Third Party Claim at
the sole cost and expense of the Indemnifying Party. The Indemnified Party is
authorized, prior to and during such thirty (30) day period, at the expense of
the Indemnifying Party, to file any motion, answer or other pleading that it
shall deem necessary or appropriate to protect its interests or those of the
Indemnifying Party and that is not prejudicial to the Indemnifying Party.

 



 

(d) If the Indemnifying Party admits its obligation to indemnify a Third Party
Claim, it shall have the right and obligation to diligently defend, at its
sole cost and expense, the Third Party Claim provided that, where the Third
Party Claim consists of a civil, criminal or regulatory proceeding, action,
indictment or investigation against the Indemnified Party by any Governmental
Authority, the Indemnified Party shall at its option have the right to control
the defense and proceedings. Except as provided in the preceding sentence, the
Indemnifying Party shall have full control of such defense and proceedings,
including any compromise or settlement thereof. If requested by the
Indemnifying Party, the Indemnified Party agrees to cooperate in contesting
any Third Party Claim which the Indemnifying Party elects to contest
(provided, however, that the Indemnified Party shall not be required to bring
any counterclaim or cross-complaint against any Person). The Indemnified Party
may participate in, but not control, at its own expense, any defense or
settlement of any Third Party Claim controlled by the Indemnifying Party
pursuant to this _Section 13.7(d)_. An Indemnifying Party shall not, without
the written consent of the Indemnified Party, (i) settle any Third Party Claim
or consent to the entry of any

 



      
 

 



 

judgment with respect thereto which does not result in a final resolution of
the Indemnified Partys Liability in respect of such Third Party Claim
(including in the case of a settlement an unconditional written release of the
Indemnified Party from all Liability in respect of such Third Party Claim) or
(ii) settle any Third Party Claim or consent to the entry of any judgment with
respect thereto in any manner that may materially and adversely affect the
Indemnified Party (other than as a result of money damages covered by the
indemnity).

 



 

(e) If the Indemnifying Party does not admit its obligation to indemnify and
bear all expenses associated with a Third Party Claim or admits its obligation
to indemnify and bear all expenses associated with a Third Party Claim but
fails to diligently prosecute or settle the Third Party Claim, then the
Indemnified Party shall have the right to defend against the Third Party Claim
at the sole cost and expense of the Indemnifying Party, with counsel of the
Indemnified Partys choosing, subject to the right of the Indemnifying Party
to admit its obligation to indemnify and bear all expenses associated with a
Third Party Claim and assume the defense of the Third Party Claim at any time
prior to settlement or final determination thereof. If the Indemnifying Party
has not yet admitted its obligation to indemnify and bear all expenses
associated with a Third Party Claim, the Indemnified Party shall send written
notice to the Indemnifying Party of any proposed settlement and the
Indemnifying Party shall have the option for ten (10) Business Days following
receipt of such notice to (i) admit in writing its obligation to indemnify and
bear all expenses associated with a Third Party Claim and (ii) if such
obligation is so admitted, reject, in its reasonable judgment, the proposed
settlement.

 



 

(f) In the case of a claim for indemnification not based upon a Third Party
Claim, the Indemnifying Party shall have thirty (30) days from its receipt of
the Claim Notice to (i) cure the Liabilities complained of, (ii) admit its
obligation to indemnify for and bear all expenses associated with such
Liability or (iii) dispute the claim for such Liabilities. If the Indemnifying
Party does not notify the Indemnified Party within such thirty (30) day period
that it has cured the Liabilities or that it disputes the claim for such
Liabilities, the amount of such Liabilities shall conclusively be deemed a
liability of the Indemnifying Party hereunder.

 



 

 ** _13.8_** ** _ _****_Survival_**. The representations and warranties of the
Parties contained in _Sections 3.1_ , _3.2_ , _3.3(a)_ , _3.5_ , _3.15_ ,
_4.1_ , _4.2_ , _4.3(a)_ , _4.5_ , _4.9_ and _4.10_ (collectively, the " **
_Fundamental Representations_** ") shall, in each case, survive the Closing
without time limit. The representations and warranties of SM contained in
_Article III_ and of each of the Buyers in _Article IV_ (in each case, other
than the Fundamental Representations) shall, in each case, survive the Closing
for a period of twelve (12) months. The covenants and agreements of SM
contained in _Section 13.2(d) _through _Section 13.2(f) _shall, in each
case, survive the Closing for a period of twenty-four (24) months. The other
covenants and agreements of SM and Buyers contained in this Agreement shall
survive the Closing without time limit. Representations, warranties, covenants
and agreements shall be of no further force and effect after the date of their
expiration; provided that there shall be no termination of any bona fide claim
asserted pursuant to this Agreement with respect to such a representation,
warranty, covenant or agreement prior to its expiration date.

 



 

 ** _13.9_** ** _ _****_Non-Compensatory Damages_**. None of the Buyer
Indemnified Parties or SM Indemnified Parties shall be entitled to recover
from SM or Buyers, as applicable, or their respective Affiliates, any
indirect, consequential, punitive or exemplary damages or damages for

 



      
 

 



 

lost profits of any kind arising under or in connection with this Agreement or
the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, except to the extent any such
Party suffers such damages (including costs of defense and reasonable
attorneys fees incurred in connection with defending of such damages) to a
Third Party, which damages (including costs of defense and reasonable
attorneys fees incurred in connection with defending against such damages)
shall not be excluded by this provision as to recovery hereunder. Subject to
the preceding sentence, each Buyer, on behalf of each of its Buyer Indemnified
Parties, and SM, on behalf of each of the SM Indemnified Parties, each waive
any right to recover punitive, special, exemplary and consequential damages,
including damages for lost profits of any kind, arising in connection with
this Agreement or the transactions contemplated by this Agreement. This
Section shall not restrict any Partys right to obtain specific performance or
other equitable remedies (other than rescission) pursuant to _Section 12.2_.

 



 

 ** _13.10_** ** _ _****_Cooperation by Buyers Concerning Retained
Litigation_**. Buyers agree to use reasonable efforts to cooperate with SM in
connection with SMs defense and other actions relating to or arising out of
the litigation and claims set forth on __Schedule 13.1__.

 ** _14.7_** ** _ _****_Governing Law_**. THIS AGREEMENT AND THE LEGAL
RELATIONS AMONG THE PARTIES SHALL BE GOVERNED AND CONSTRUED IN ACCORDANCE WITH
THE LAWS OF THE STATE OF TEXAS, EXCLUDING ANY CONFLICTS OF LAW RULE OR
PRINCIPLE THAT MIGHT REFER CONSTRUCTION OF SUCH PROVISIONS TO THE LAWS OF
ANOTHER JURISDICTION. SUBJECT TO _SECTION 2.5(c)_, _SECTION 6.2(i)_,
_SECTION 7.1(e) _AND _SECTION 14.8_, THE PARTIES CONSENT TO THE EXERCISE OF
JURISDICTION IN PERSONAM BY THE UNITED STATES DISTRICT COURT AND THE COURTS OF
THE STATE OF TEXAS LOCATED IN HARRIS COUNTY IN THE STATE OF TEXAS FOR ANY
DISPUTE AND/OR THE ENFORCEMENT OF ANY ARBITRATION OR EXPERT AWARD.

 



 

 ** _14.8_** ** _ _****_Dispute Resolution_**. Except for (1) determinations
by the Accounting Arbitrator pursuant to _Section 2.5(c)_, (2) determinations
of Title Disputes pursuant to _Section 6.2(i)_, or (3) determinations of
Environmental Disputes pursuant to _Section 7.1(e)_, any Dispute shall be
settled by arbitration administered by the American Arbitration Association
(the " ** _AAA_** ") under its Commercial Arbitration Rules (the " ** _AAA
Rules_** "), as modified below:

 



 

(a) The arbitration shall be conducted by three arbitrators. The place of
arbitration shall be Houston, Texas. Within thirty (30) days of any Party
providing notice to the other Party of a Dispute, each Party to such Dispute
shall appoint one arbitrator (provided that if both Buyers are party to a
dispute with SM, the Buyers shall collectively appoint one (1) arbitrator and
SM shall appoint one (1) arbitrator), and the two arbitrators so appointed
shall select the third and presiding arbitrator within thirty (30) days
following appointment of the second Party-appointed arbitrator. If either
Party or group of Parties fails to appoint an arbitrator within the permitted
time period, then the missing arbitrator(s) shall be selected by the AAA as
appointing authority in accordance with the AAA Rules. Any arbitrator
nominated or appointed by the AAA shall be a member of the Large, Complex
Commercial Case Panel of the AAA. In addition to the rules of the AAA and
applicable Law on arbitrator neutrality, no arbitrator shall have been an
employee or consultant to any Party or any of its Affiliates within the five
year period preceding the arbitration, or have any financial interest in the
Dispute.

 



 

(b) All decisions of the arbitral tribunal shall be made by majority vote. All
awards of the arbitral tribunal shall be final and binding, subject only to
grounds and procedures for vacating, modifying or correcting such under the
Federal Arbitration Act (9 U.S.C. § 1 _et seq._ ). Judgment on the award may
be entered and enforced by any court of competent jurisdiction.

 



 

(c) Notwithstanding the agreement to arbitrate Disputes in this _Section
14.8_, any Party may apply to a court for interim measures pending appointment
of the arbitration tribunal, including injunction, attachment and conservation
orders. The Parties agree that seeking and obtaining such court-ordered
interim measures shall not waive any Partys right to arbitration.
Additionally, the arbitrators (or in an emergency the presiding arbitrator
acting alone in the event one or more of the other arbitrators is unable to be
involved in a timely fashion) may grant interim measures including
injunctions, attachments and conservation orders in appropriate circumstances,
which measures may be immediately enforced by court order. Hearings on
requests for interim measures may be held in person, by telephone or video
conference or by other means that permit the Parties to present evidence and
arguments. The arbitrators (or

 



      
 

 



 

chairperson, as the case may be) may require any Party to provide appropriate
security in connection with such measures.

 



 

(d) The arbitral tribunal is authorized to award costs, attorneys fees and
expert witness fees and to allocate such costs and fees among the Parties. The
award may include interest, at the Agreed Interest Rate, from the date of any
default, breach or other accrual of a claim until the arbitral award is paid
in full. The arbitrators may not award indirect, consequential, special or
punitive damages except to the extent such damages are expressly allowed under
the terms of this Agreement. Unless otherwise directed by the arbitral
tribunal, each Party shall pay its own expenses in connection with the
arbitration. The cost of the arbitrators shall be split evenly between the
Parties.

 



 

(e) All negotiations, mediation, arbitration and expert determinations
relating to a Dispute (including a settlement resulting from negotiation or
mediation, an arbitral award, documents exchanged or produced during a
mediation or arbitration proceeding, and memorials, briefs or other documents
prepared for the arbitration) are confidential and may not be disclosed by the
Parties, their respective Affiliates or any of their respective employees,
officers, directors, counsel, consultants and expert witnesses, except to the
extent necessary to enforce any settlement agreement, arbitration award or
expert determination, to enforce other rights of a Party, as required by Law
or for a bona fide business purpose, such as disclosure to accountants,
shareholders or third-party purchasers; provided, however, that breach of this
confidentiality provision shall not void any settlement, expert determination
or award.

 



 

(f) Any papers, notices or process necessary or proper for an arbitration
hereunder, or any court action in connection with an arbitration or an award,
may be served on a Party in the manner set forth in _Section 14.2_.

 



 

 ** _14.9_** ** _ _****_Filings, Notices and Certain Governmental Approvals;
Use of Name_**.

 



 

(a) Promptly after Closing, Buyers shall (a) record the Assignments and all
state/federal assignments executed at Closing in all applicable real property
records and/or, if applicable, all state or federal agencies, (b) actively
pursue all Customary Post-Closing Consents that may be required in connection
with the assignment of the Assets to Buyers, and (c) continue to use
reasonable efforts to pursue all other consents and approvals that may be
required in connection with the (i) assignment of the Assets to Buyers and
(ii) assumption of the Assumed Liabilities by Buyers hereunder, in each case,
that shall not have been obtained prior to Closing.

 



 

(b) As promptly as practicable after the Closing Date but in any event within
sixty (60) days of the Closing Date, Buyers shall eliminate the names "SM
Energy Company", "SM Energy", "Saint Mary", "SM" and any variants thereof from
the Assets and, except with respect to such grace period for eliminating
existing usage, shall have no right to use any logos, trademarks or trade
names belonging to SM or any of its Affiliates.

 



 

 ** _14.10_** ** _ _****_Amendment_**. This Agreement may be amended only by
an instrument in writing executed by all of the Parties and expressly
identified as an amendment or modification hereof.

 



 

 ** _14.11_** ** _ _****_Parties in Interest_**. Nothing in this Agreement
shall entitle any Person other than the Parties to any claim, cause of action,
remedy or right of any kind.

 



      
 

 



 

 ** _14.12_** ** _ _****_Successors and Permitted Assigns_**. This Agreement
shall be binding upon and inure to the benefit of the Parties and their
respective successors and permitted assigns.

 



 

 ** _14.13_** ** _ _****_Publicity_**. Prior to making any public announcement
or statement in connection with the entry into or consummation of this
Agreement or, prior to making any other public announcement or statement
regarding this Agreement (including any term or condition hereof) on or before
the Closing Date (a " ** _Closing Announcement_** "), each Party shall provide
the other Parties a draft of such announcement or statement prior to making
such announcement or statement and advise the other Parties of any material
revisions to such draft prior to making such announcement or statement. In
addition, prior to making any such announcement or statement, the Party making
such statement or announcement shall consider in good faith any revisions or
comments that any other Party propose to such announcement or statement. After
Closing, the Parties will not make any public announcement or statement that
is materially inconsistent with such Partys Closing Announcement.
Notwithstanding the foregoing, any Party may always make any disclosures
required by applicable Law or the applicable rules or regulations of any
Governmental Authority or stock exchange.

 



 

 ** _14.14_** ** _ _****_SM Confidentiality. _**If Closing should occur, then
all data with respect to the Wells and information regarding the terms and
provisions of the Leases (collectively, " ** _Confidential Information_** ")
shall become confidential information with respect to SM, the disclosure of
which by SM would cause irreparable harm to the Buyers. Accordingly, should
Closing occur, then, during the twelve (12) month period following the Closing
Date, SM will not, and will direct its Affiliates and its and their officers
and employees not to, disclose to any Person any Confidential Information
unless Buyers have provided prior written consent to such disclosure.
Notwithstanding anything to the contrary herein, Confidential Information
shall not include information that: (i) is in the public domain; or (ii) is
acquired by SM from any Third Party if such Third Party is not known by SM,
after reasonable inquiry, to be bound by a contractual, legal or fiduciary
obligation of confidentiality or secrecy to a Buyer or any other Third Party
with respect to such information. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary
herein, SM may disclose Confidential Information to the extent such disclosure
is required by Law, a Governmental Authority or any stock exchange rules,
provided that SM shall, to the extent legally permissible and practicable,
provide written advance notice of such disclosure to the Buyers or, with
respect to data regarding the Wells, such information is included as part of
aggregate data with respect to other wells or assets of SM or its Affiliates.

 



 

 ** _14.15_** ** _ _****_Post-Closing Limitations. _**If Closing should occur,
SM and its Affiliates shall not directly or indirectly top lease any of the
Leases during the primary term of each such Lease without the prior written
consent of Buyers.

 



 

 ** _14.16_** ** _ _****_Preparation of Agreement_**. Both SM and Buyers and
their respective counsel participated in the preparation of this Agreement. In
the event of any ambiguity in this Agreement, no presumption shall arise based
on the identity of the draftsman of this Agreement.

 



 

 ** _14.17_** ** _ _****_Conduct of the Parties_**. Each Party warrants that
it and its Affiliates have not made, offered or authorized and agrees that it
will not make, offer or authorize with respect to the matters which are the
subject of this Agreement, any payment, gift, promise or other advantage,
whether directly or through any other Person, to or for the use or benefit of
any public

 



      
 

 



 

official (being any person holding a legislative, administrative or judicial
office, including any person employed by or acting on behalf of a public
agency, a public enterprise or public international organization) or any
political party or political party official or candidate for office, where
such payment, gift, promise or advantage would violate any applicable Law.

 



 

 ** _14.18_** ** _ _****_Severability_**. If any term or other provision of
this Agreement is invalid, illegal or incapable of being enforced by any rule
of Law or public policy, all other conditions and provisions of this Agreement
shall nevertheless remain in full force and effect so long as the economic or
legal substance of the transactions contemplated hereby is not affected in any
adverse manner to any Party. Upon such determination that any term or other
provision is invalid, illegal or incapable of being enforced, the Parties
shall negotiate in good faith to modify this Agreement so as to effect the
original intent of the Parties as closely as possible in an acceptable manner
to the end that the transactions contemplated hereby are fulfilled to the
extent possible.
