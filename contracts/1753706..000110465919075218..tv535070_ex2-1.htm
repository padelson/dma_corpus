(a)  It is understood and agreed that the specification of any
dollar amount in the representations and warranties contained in this
Agreement or the inclusion of any specific item in the Sellers Disclosure
Schedule or Purchaser Disclosure Schedule is not intended to imply that such
amounts, or higher or lower amounts, or the items so included, or other items,
are or are not material, and neither Party shall use the fact of the setting
of such amounts or the fact of the inclusion of any such item in the
Sellers Disclosure Schedule or Purchaser Disclosure Schedule in any dispute
or controversy between the Parties as to whether any obligation, item or
matter not described in this Agreement or included in the Sellers Disclosure
Schedule or Purchaser Disclosure Schedule is or is not material for purposes
of this Agreement.

  



  

(b) For purposes of this Agreement, (i) the words "hereof,"

contained in this Agreement and the Schedules or Exhibits hereto are
inserted for convenience of reference only and shall not be deemed to affect
the meaning or interpretation of this Agreement. Without limiting the
foregoing, the division of the Sellers Disclosure Schedule and Purchaser
Disclosure Schedule into sections is for organization and convenience of
reference only, and shall not limit the applicability of any disclosures
therein except as expressly set forth in this Agreement.

  



  

Section 1.5   _Schedules and Exhibits_. The Schedules and
Exhibits to this Agreement are incorporated into and form an integral part of
this Agreement. If any of the foregoing is a form of agreement, such
agreement, when executed and delivered by the Parties thereto, shall
constitute a document independent of this Agreement.

  



  

Article II 
  
 SALE AND PURCHASE

  



  

Section 2.1   _Purchase and Sale_. Subject to the terms
and conditions of this Agreement, at the closing of the Transactions (the "
_Closing_ "), the Sellers shall sell, convey, assign, transfer and deliver to
the Purchaser the Transferred Equity Interests and the assets included in the
Transferred Assets and Liabilities free and clear of all Liens (other than
restrictions arising under the Transferred Entities' Organizational Documents
made available to the Purchaser or applicable securities Laws or Liens
created by the Purchaser), and the Purchaser shall purchase, acquire and
accept the Transferred Equity Interests and the Transferred Assets and
Liabilities, and assume and agree to discharge the Liabilities included in the
Transferred Assets and Liabilities, in exchange for an amount equal to
(subject to, without limitation, _Section 2.6_ and _Section 5.22_) the
Purchase Price.

  



  

Section 2.2   _Date and Place of Closing_. The Closing
shall take place at the offices of Wachtell, Lipton, Rosen and Katz, 51 West
52nd Street, New York, New York 10019, at 10:00 a.m., New York time, on the
third (3rd) Business Day following the satisfaction or waiver of the
conditions set forth in _Article VIII_ (other than those conditions that by
their nature are to be satisfied or waived at the Closing, but subject to the
satisfaction or waiver of those conditions), or at such other place, time or
date as may be mutually agreed upon in writing by the Sellers and the
Purchaser. The date on which the Closing occurs is referred to as the "
_Closing Date_."

  



  

Section 2.3 _Estimated Adjustment_. No fewer than five
(5) Business Days before the Closing Date, the Sellers shall cause the
Transferred Entities to prepare and deliver to the Purchaser a statement
setting forth its calculation of the estimate of the Adjustment Amount (the "
_Estimated Adjustment Statement_ "), substantially in the form of _Exhibit I_
, together with all related work papers and supporting calculations or other
materials reasonably requested by the Purchaser. The Estimated Adjustment
Statement shall be prepared using and applying the same accounting principles,
practices, procedures, policies and methods (with consistent classifications,
judgments, elections, inclusions, exclusions and valuation and estimation
methodologies) used and applied by the Sellers and the Acquired Companies in
the preparation of the Financial Statements (including as described in
footnote 2 to the Audited Financial Statements) and utilizing the line items
set forth on _Exhibit I_ , and, to the extent not addressed by the foregoing,
in accordance with GAAP (the " _Transaction Accounting Principles_ "). To the
extent any financial statement to which this Agreement requires the
application of the Transaction Accounting Principles is inconsistent with
GAAP, the accounting principles, practices, procedures, policies and methods
used in the preparation of the Financial Statements shall control. In any
event, the Transaction Accounting Principles (i) shall be based on facts and
circumstances as they exist prior to the Closing and (ii) shall follow the
defined terms contained in this Agreement.

Section 2.5   _Post-Closing Adjustment_.

  



  

(a)  As promptly as practicable, but in any event within one
hundred twenty (120) days following the Closing Date, the Purchaser shall
deliver to the Sellers a statement setting forth its calculation of the
Adjustment Amount (the " _Post-Closing Adjustment Statement_ "), together
with all related work papers and supporting calculations reasonably requested
by the Sellers. The Post-Closing Adjustment Statement shall be prepared in
accordance with the Transaction Accounting Principles. During the
120-day period following the Closing Date until the delivery by the Purchaser
to the Sellers of the Post-Closing Adjustment Statement, the Purchaser and
its Representatives respectively, shall be permitted to review the applicable
books and records of the Acquired Companies, and the Sellers shall promptly
as reasonably practicable make available employees and other Representatives
of the Acquired Companies as reasonably necessary for the preparation of the
Post-Closing Adjustment Statement; _provided_ , that such access shall be
during normal business hours and in a manner that does not interfere with the
normal business operations of the Sellers;  _provided_ , _further_ , that
such access shall not jeopardize the attorney-client privilege or attorney
work-product doctrine or any other applicable privilege to which any such
books and records, materials and other information is subject.

  



  

(b) During the thirty (30)-day period immediately after the
delivery by the Purchaser to the Sellers of the Post-Closing Adjustment
Statement (the " _Review Period_ "), the Sellers and their respective
Representatives shall be permitted to review the applicable supporting
documents and work papers used in the preparation of the Post-
Closing Adjustment Statement, and the Purchaser shall as promptly as
reasonably practicable make reasonably available the individuals responsible
for and knowledgeable about the information used in and necessary for the
preparation of the Post-Closing Adjustment Statement to respond to the
inquiries of, or requests for information (including any supporting documents
used in preparing the Post-Closing Adjustment Statement) by, the Sellers or
their respective Representatives; _provided_ , that such access shall be
during normal business hours and in a manner that does not interfere with the
normal business operations of the Purchaser or the Acquired Companies;
_provided further_ , that such access shall not jeopardize the attorney-
client privilege or attorney work-product doctrine or any other applicable
privilege to which any such books and records, materials and other
information is subject.

  



  

   

21

 



    



  

(c)  In the event that the Sellers do not agree with any of the
information set forth on the Post-Closing Adjustment Statement, the Sellers
shall notify the Purchaser of such disagreement in writing (the " _Notice of
Disagreement_ ") as promptly as practicable, and in any case on or before the
expiration of the Review Period. The Notice of Disagreement shall set forth
in reasonable detail the basis for such dispute and the amounts involved in
such dispute. If the Sellers do not deliver a Notice of Disagreement to the
Purchaser by the end of the Review Period, the Post-Closing Adjustment
Statement shall be deemed to be final, including for purposes of _Section
2.5(g)_.

  



  

(d)  During the fifteen (15)-day period immediately following
the delivery of a Notice of Disagreement (the " _Consultation Period_ "), the
Sellers and the Purchaser shall seek in good faith to resolve all differences
that they may have with respect to the matters specified in the Notice of
Disagreement. If, during the Consultation Period, such Parties reach an
agreement with respect to all items in dispute as set forth in the Notice of
Disagreement, such agreement shall be evidenced in writing and the Post-
Closing Adjustment Statement shall be updated to reflect such resolutions and,
as so updated, shall be deemed to be final, including for purposes of
_Section 2.5(g)_.

  



  

(e) If, at the end of the Consultation Period, the Sellers and
the Purchaser have been unable to resolve all differences that they may have
with respect to the matters specified in the Notice of Disagreement, the
Sellers and the Purchaser shall submit all matters that remain in dispute
with respect to the Notice of Disagreement (along with copies of the Post-
Closing Adjustment Statement and Notice of Disagreement marked to indicate
those line items that are not then in dispute) to Grant Thornton LLP, or
another independent certified public accounting firm in the United States of
good national reputation and mutually acceptable to the Sellers and the
Purchaser (the " _Independent Accounting Firm_ "). The Sellers and the
Purchaser agree to cooperate with the Independent Accounting Firm during its
resolution of the matters that remain in dispute as set forth and marked in
the Notice of Disagreement (including by entering into a customary engagement
letter with the Independent Accounting Firm); _provided_ , _however_ , that
the accountants of the Sellers shall not be obligated to make any work papers
available to the Independent Accounting Firm except in accordance with such
accountants' normal disclosure procedures and then only after the Independent
Accounting Firm has signed a customary agreement relating to such access to
work papers in form and substance reasonably acceptable to such accountants.
The Sellers and the Purchaser shall instruct the Independent Accounting Firm,
within fifteen (15) days after referral of the matter to such
Independent Accounting Firm, to evaluate the appropriate amount of each line
item in the Post-Closing Adjustment Statement as to which the Sellers and the
Purchaser disagree (as set out and marked in the Notice of Disagreement
submitted to the Independent Accounting Firm), acting as an expert and not as
an arbitrator, of the appropriate amount with respect to each such line
item and the resulting calculation of the Post-Closing Adjustment Statement
in accordance with the Transaction Accounting Principles. In making such
determination, the Independent Accounting Firm shall rely solely on the
presentations and supporting material provided by the Sellers and the
Purchaser, in each case, to the Independent Accounting Firm and the
other Party, and not pursuant to any independent review, and the definitions
and other applicable provisions of this Agreement. The Independent Accounting
Firm shall not consider any issues other than those which remain in dispute
between the Sellers and the Purchaser, as set forth and marked in the Notice
of Disagreement submitted to the Independent Accounting Firm. The Independent
Accounting Firm shall resolve each line item that remains in dispute by
choosing a value not in excess of, nor less than, the greatest or lowest
value, respectively, set forth in the presentations and supporting material
provided by the Sellers and the Purchaser. Such determination of the
Independent Accounting Firm shall be conclusive and binding upon the parties
absent Fraud or manifest error. A copy of all materials submitted to the
Independent Accounting Firm pursuant to this _Section 2.5(e) _shall be
provided by the Sellers or the Purchaser, as applicable, to the other Party
concurrently with the submission thereof to the Independent Accounting Firm.
During such determination period, the Independent Accounting Firm also shall
prepare a statement of the Adjustment Amount based upon all line items not
disputed or resolved by the Parties and the amount of each line item
determined by the Independent Accounting Firm in accordance with this _Section
2.5(e)_, which statement, absent a showing of Fraud or manifest calculation
error, shall be deemed to be final, including for purposes of _Section
2.5(g)_. During the review by the Independent Accounting Firm, the Sellers
and the Purchaser and their respective accountants and other Representatives
will each make available to the Independent Accounting Firm interviews with
such individuals, and such information, books and records and work papers, as
may be reasonably required by the Independent Accounting Firm to fulfill its
obligations under this _Section 2.5(e)_; _provided_ , _however_ , that the
accountants of the Sellers shall not be obligated to make any work papers
available to the Independent Accounting Firm except in accordance with
such accountants' normal disclosure procedures and then only after the
Independent Accounting Firm has signed a customary agreement relating to such
access to work papers in form and substance reasonably acceptable to such
accountants. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the scope of the disputes to be
resolved by the Independent Accounting Firm shall be limited to fixing
mathematical errors and determining whether any disputed determination of the
Post-Closing Adjustment Statement properly submitted in accordance with the
terms hereof was properly calculated in accordance with this Agreement,
including the Transaction Accounting Principles. The Independent Accounting
Firm is not authorized to, and shall not, make any other determination,
including (A) any determination with respect to any matter included in the
Post-Closing Adjustment Statement or the Notice of Disagreement other than
those matters that were properly submitted for resolution to the Independent
Accounting Firm in accordance with the terms hereof, (B) any determination as
to whether the Transaction Accounting Principles were followed with respect
to the Financial Statements, (C) any determination as to whether the Target
Working Capital Amount or the related calculations to the extent set forth in
Exhibit I were properly calculated in accordance with the Transaction
Accounting Principles, (D) any determination as to the accuracy of the
representations and warranties set forth in this Agreement or (E) any
determination as to compliance by any party with any of their respective
covenants in this Agreement. Any dispute not within the scope of disputes to
be resolved by the Independent Accounting Firm pursuant to this _Section 2.5_
shall be resolved as otherwise provided in this Agreement.

  



  

   

22

 



    



     

(f)  Each of the Sellers and the Purchaser shall bear all the
fees and costs incurred by them in connection with the Independent Accounting
Firm's review, except that the fees and expenses relating to the foregoing
work by the Independent Accounting Firm shall be borne by the Sellers, on the
one hand, and the Purchaser, on the other hand, in inverse proportion as they
may prevail on the matters resolved by the Independent Accounting Firm, which
proportionate allocation will also be determined by the
Independent Accounting Firm calculated on an aggregate basis based on the
relative dollar values of the amounts in dispute and be included in the
Independent Accounting Firm's written report.

  



  

(g)  The statement of the Adjustment Amount that is final, as
finally determined pursuant to _Section 2.5(a)_, _2.5(c)_ ,  _2.5(d)_ or
_2.5(e)_ , is referred to as the " _Final Adjustment Statement_." The Final
Adjustment Statement shall be conclusive and binding on the parties, and
judgment may be entered upon the Final Adjustment Statement by any court
referred to in _Section 10.3_.

  



  

(h)  The " _Post-Closing Adjustment_ " shall be equal to (a) the

Statement, less (b) the estimated Adjustment Amount set forth in the Estimated
Adjustment Statement, if positive, or plus (c) the absolute value of the
estimated Adjustment Amount set forth in the Estimated Adjustment
Statement, if negative. If the Post-Closing Adjustment is a positive amount,
then the Purchaser shall pay in cash to the Sellers (or one or more
Affiliates designated by the Sellers) the amount of the Post-Closing
Adjustment. If the Post-Closing Adjustment is a negative amount, then the
Sellers (or one or more Affiliates designated by the Sellers) shall pay in
cash to the Purchaser the absolute value of the Post-Closing Adjustment. Any
such payment shall be made within five (5) Business Days after the final Post-
Closing Adjustment Statement is delivered.

  



  

Section 2.6   _Earnout_.

  



  

(a)  During the period between the date of Closing but on or
prior to the fifth (5th) anniversary of Closing (the " _Earnout Period_ "),
subject to the terms and conditions set forth herein, the Sellers shall have
the contingent right to receive additional consideration from the Purchaser
based on the performance mechanics set forth in this _Section 2.6_, to
the extent that the requirements as set forth in this _Section 2.6_ are met.

  



  

(b)  In the event that the volume weighted-average per-share
trading price of Class A Ordinary Shares is at or above the Tier 1 Threshold
Price for twenty (20) trading days in any thirty (30)-day continuous trading
period during the Earnout Period, the Sellers will have the right to receive
a number of additional Class A Ordinary Shares equal to $20,000,000 _divided
by_ the Tier 1 Threshold Price (the " _Tier 1 Consideration_ ").

  



  

(c)  In the event the weighted-average per-share trading price
of Class A Ordinary Shares is at or above the Tier 2 Threshold Price for
twenty (20) trading days in any thirty (30)-day continuous trading period
during the Earnout Period, the Sellers will have the right to receive a

the Tier 2 Threshold Price (the " _Tier 2 Consideration_ " and with the Tier
1 Consideration, the " _Earnout Shares_ ").

  



  

   

23

 



    



     

(d)  The Purchaser shall use commercially reasonable efforts to
issue the relevant portion of the Earnout Shares to the Sellers within five
(5) Business Days following the final day of the relevant twenty (20) trading
day period.

  



  

(e)  In the event that a Change in Control occurs prior to the
expiration of the Earnout Period at or above a Class A Ordinary Shares per
share price (or implied per share price) of $10.00 per share (the "
_Acceleration Price_ "), the Sellers will have the right to receive a number
of additional Class A Ordinary Shares equal to the sum of (i) $20,000,000
divided by the Tier 1 Threshold Price _plus_ (ii) $20,000,000 divided by the
Tier 2 Threshold Price immediately prior to the consummation of the Change in
Control. For the avoidance of doubt, in the event that a Change in Control
occurs either after the expiration of the Earnout Period or at a Class A
Ordinary Shares per share price below the Acceleration Price, the Sellers
shall not be entitled to receive any additional consideration pursuant to this
_Section 2.6(e)_.

  



  

(f)  The Purchaser shall not voluntarily cease to be listed as
a public company on the NASDAQ during the Earnout Period other than in
connection with a Change in Control.

  



  

Section 2.7   _Withholding_. The Purchaser shall be
entitled to deduct and withhold from amounts payable hereunder such amounts
as are required to be deducted and withheld under the Code or any provision
of federal, state, local or foreign Tax Law with respect to the making of
such payment; _provided_ , _that_ , other than employment-related withholding
on compensatory payments to any person under this Agreement, including Change
in Control Payments, the Purchaser (or an Affiliate thereof) shall use
commercially reasonable efforts to provide the Sellers (or Person in respect
of which such deduction or withholding will be made) with fifteen (15) days'
advance notice of the amount it intends to deduct or withhold and the basis
for such deduction or withholding. The Purchaser shall consider in good faith
any certificate or other documentation provided by Sellers that establishes a
basis to eliminate or reduce any required deduction or withholding under
applicable Law. The Purchaser shall cooperate in good faith with the Sellers
to the extent commercially reasonable to eliminate or reduce any required
deduction or withholding. To the extent that amounts are deducted and
withheld and are properly remitted to the appropriate Governmental Entity,
such amounts shall be treated for all purposes of this Agreement as having
been paid to the Person in respect of which such deduction and
withholding was made.

  



  

Section 2.8   _Directors and Officers_. Subject to
applicable Law, the Purchaser Board shall take all action necessary to
ensure that, effective as of the Closing, individuals determined in
accordance with the Investors Agreement (each, a " _Designated Director_ ")
shall be appointed to the Purchaser Board.

share subdivision, share capitalization, share consolidation, merger,

such adjustment occurring following the date hereof but prior to the
expiration of the Earnout Period) and Tier 2 Consideration (if such

of the Earnout Period), (ii) Escrowed Sponsor Shares (if such adjustment
occurs following the date hereof but prior to the release of the Escrowed
Sponsor Shares), and (iii) Escrowed Seller Shares (if such adjustment occurs
following the date hereof but prior to the release of the Escrowed Seller

such changes.

Article III 
  
 REPRESENTATIONS AND WARRANTIES OF THE Sellers

  



  

Except as set forth in the correspondingly numbered Section of the Sellers
Disclosure Schedule (each of which shall qualify the correspondingly numbered
Sections or subsections hereof to which such Sellers Disclosure Schedule
relates, and shall qualify any other provision of this Agreement to which
the relevance of the item so disclosed to such other provision is reasonably
apparent from the face of such disclosure, with no presumption or inference
established by the existence or absence of a reference to such section in the
corresponding numbered Sections or subsections hereof), the Sellers hereby
jointly and severally represent and warrant to the Purchaser as follows:

  



  

Section 3.1   _Organization; Standing and Power_.

  



  

(a)  Each of the Sellers and the Acquired Companies is the type
of legal entity set forth next to its name on _Section 3.1(a)_ of the
Sellers Disclosure Schedule and is duly organized, validly existing and in
good standing under the Laws of its respective jurisdiction of organization
as set forth therein. Each of the Acquired Companies has requisite corporate
or other entity power and authority to own, operate or lease their respective
properties and assets now owned, operated or leased by such Acquired
Company and to carry on such Acquired Company's business as it is presently
conducted in all material respects.

  



  

(b)  Each of the Sellers and the Acquired Companies is duly
licensed or qualified to do business and is in good standing under the Laws
of any jurisdiction in which the character of the properties and assets owned
or leased by it or in which the operation of its business makes such
licensing or qualification necessary, except where the failure to be so
licensed, qualified or in good standing would not have, and would not
reasonably be expected to have, in each case either individually or in the
aggregate, a Material Adverse Effect.

  



  

Section 3.2   _Capital Structure of the Acquired
Companies_.

  



  

(a)   _Section 3.2(a)_ of the Sellers Disclosure Schedule sets
forth the capitalization of each of the Transferred Entities as of the date
hereof, describing in each case (i) the authorized capital stock of such
Transferred Entity, including the number of shares and par value thereof;
(ii) the number of shares that are issued and outstanding therein; and (iii)
the owners of each such equity interest. The Sellers have good and valid
title, of record and beneficially, to all of the Transferred Equity
Interests, free and clear of all Liens, other than Permitted Liens, and the
Transferred Equity Interests constitute all of the issued and outstanding
equity interests of the Transferred Entities.

  



  

(b) All of the Transferred Equity Interests have been duly
authorized and validly issued, fully paid and nonassessable and were
not issued in violation of (i) any agreement, arrangement, Contract or other
commitment to which any of the Sellers or the Acquired Companies is a party
or is subject to; (ii) any preemptive or similar rights of any Person; or
(iii) any Law. There are no outstanding and authorized (x) options,
subscriptions, warrants or rights of conversion, calls, puts, rights of first
refusal, preemptive rights or other similar rights, Contracts, agreements,
arrangements or commitments obligating any of the Transferred Entities, the
Sellers or their respective Affiliates to issue, sell or otherwise cause
to become outstanding or to acquire, repurchase or redeem any shares of or
other equity interest in any Transferred Entity's capital stock or any
interest therein, other equity interests or securities convertible into or
exchangeable for equity interests in any Transferred Entity or the
Transferred Equity Interests or other direct or indirect equity interests of
the Transferred Entities (whether issued or unissued); (y) stock appreciation
rights, phantom stock, profit participation or other similar rights or equity
equivalents of or with respect to any Transferred Entity; or (z)
voting trusts, stockholder agreements, proxies or other agreements or
understandings in effect with respect to the voting or transfer of any of the
Transferred Equity Interests or to which any Transferred Entity is a party or
by which any Transferred Entity is bound. No claim has been made or, to the
Knowledge of Sellers, threatened, asserting that any Person is the holder or
beneficial owner of, or has the right to acquire beneficial ownership of, any
Transferred Equity Interests or any other equity interests in the Transferred
Entities, and to the Knowledge of the Sellers, no facts or circumstances exist
that would reasonably be expected to give rise to a valid claim of such
ownership by any Person.

  



  

   

25

 



    



  

(c) Except as set forth on _Section 3.2(c)_ of the Sellers
Disclosure Schedule, the Transferred Entities do not directly or indirectly
own any equity interest in, or any other interest convertible into or
exchangeable or exercisable for, any equity or similar interest in, any
Person. _Section 3.2(c)_ of the Sellers Disclosure Schedule sets forth a
list, correct in all material respects, of the name, owner, jurisdiction of
formation or organization (as applicable) and percentages of outstanding
equity securities owned, directly or indirectly, by each Acquired Company,
with respect to each Person of which such Acquired Company owns directly or
indirectly, any equity or equity related securities. All outstanding equity
securities of each Subsidiary of the Transferred Entities (except to the
extent such concepts are not applicable under the applicable Law of such
Subsidiary's jurisdiction of formation or other applicable Law) have been duly
authorized and validly issued and are owned free and clear of any Liens,
other than Permitted Liens, beneficially and of record, by one of the
Acquired Companies and the holders of such equity securities have no
obligation to make further payments for their purchase of such equity
securities or contributions to the applicable Subsidiary solely by reason of
such ownership. Except as set forth on _Section 3.2(c)_ of the Sellers
Disclosure Schedule, there are no outstanding (i) equity securities of any
Subsidiary of the Transferred Entities, (ii) securities of any Subsidiary of
the Transferred Entities convertible into or exchangeable for, at any time,
equity securities of any Subsidiary of the Companies or (iii) options or other
rights to acquire from any Subsidiary of the Transferred Entities, in each
case, that are owned by a Person other than one of the Acquired Companies,
and no obligation of any Subsidiary of the Transferred Entities to issue to
any Person other than one of the Acquired Companies, any equity securities or
securities convertible into or exchangeable for, at any time,
equity securities of any Subsidiary of the Transferred Entities. No claim has
been made or, to the Knowledge of the Sellers, threatened, asserting that any
Person, other than a Person listed on _Section 3.2(c)_ of the
Sellers Disclosure Schedule, is the holder or beneficial owner of, or has the
right to acquire beneficial ownership of, any equity securities of, or any
other equity interests in, any Subsidiary of the Transferred Entities. The
Sellers have delivered or made available to the Purchaser true, correct and
complete copies of the Organizational Documents of each of the
Transferred Entities. For the avoidance of doubt, Flavors Luxembourg Sarl, a
Societe a responsabilite limitee organized under the Laws of Luxembourg, has
been dissolved prior to the date hereof.

  



  

Section 3.3   _Authority; No Violation_.

  



  

(a)  Each of the Sellers has all of the requisite corporate or
other entity power and authority, as applicable, to enter into this Agreement
and to carry out and perform its obligations hereunder and to consummate the
Transactions. This Agreement has been duly and validly executed and delivered
by the Sellers, and the performance by each of the Sellers of its obligations
hereunder and the consummation by the Sellers of the Transactions has been
duly authorized, and, assuming due authorization, execution and delivery of
this Agreement by the Purchaser, this Agreement constitutes a valid, legal and
binding obligation of the Sellers, enforceable against the Sellers in
accordance with its terms, except as such enforceability may be subject to,
and limited by, applicable bankruptcy, insolvency, fraudulent transfer,
reorganization, moratorium and similar Laws relating to or affecting
creditors' rights generally and general equity principles (regardless of
whether enforcement is sought in a proceeding at Law or in equity)
(collectively, the " _Enforceability Exceptions_ ").

  



  

(b)  The execution, delivery and performance of this Agreement
by the Sellers and the consummation of the Transactions, do not (and will
not, with or without the lapse of time or the giving of notice, or both):

breach of or default under any of the Organizational Documents of the Sellers
or any of the material provisions of the Organizational Documents of the
Acquired Companies;

  



  

(ii)  subject to obtaining the consents, approvals, authorizations
or making required filings described under _Section 3.4_, contravene,
conflict with or result in a violation or breach of any provision of any Law
or Order applicable to the Sellers or the Acquired Companies;

  



  

(iii)  contravene, conflict with or result in a violation or
breach of, or result in a default (or give rise to any right of termination,
cancellation, payment or acceleration) under, or result in the creation of any
Lien (other than Liens created by the Purchaser or any of its Affiliates and
Permitted Liens) upon any of the properties, assets or rights of the Acquired
Companies, under any Contract to which an Acquired Company is party; except,
in the case of clause (ii) and (iii), where such conflict, violation, default
or imposition would not have, and would not reasonably be expected to have,
individually or in the aggregate, a Material Adverse Effect.

  



  

Section 3.4 _Consents and Approvals_. Except for (a)
filings required under or in connection with the HSR Act and other Regulatory
Laws set forth on _Section 3.4_ of the Sellers Disclosure Schedule; (b)

required under § 271 of the General Corporation Law of the State of Delaware
(all of which authorizations shall have been obtained by written consents

Agreement), no notice, approval, report, consent, registration, Permit or
other authorization or filing to or with any Governmental Entity is required
by or with respect to the Sellers or the Acquired Companies in connection
with the execution and delivery of this Agreement by the Sellers or the
performance of their obligations under this Agreement, or the consummation of
the Transactions except for such notices, approvals, reports, consents,
registrations, Permits or other authorizations or filings that, if not
obtained or made, would not be, and would not reasonably be expected to be,
individually or in the aggregate, materially adverse to the Acquired Companies
taken as a whole.

Section 3.5   _Title to the Transferred Equity Interests_.

(other than created by the Purchaser). Except as otherwise set forth on
_Section 3.5_ of the Sellers Disclosure Schedule, other than this Agreement
and the Transferred Entities' Organizational Documents or applicable
securities Laws, there is no Contract to which any of the Sellers or
Acquired Companies is a party, or by which any of the Sellers or Acquired
Companies are individually or jointly bound, that restricts or otherwise

Acquired Companies.

each case, that is or would reasonably be expected to materially adversely
impact the Business; (b) material settlement agreement currently in effect
with respect to the Business; (c) outstanding, pending, or, to the Knowledge

impact the Business; or (d) as of the date hereof, Action pending or to the

as a result of or in connection with the consummation of the Transactions.

to be applicable to the representation and warranty set forth herein (other

cautionary, or forward-looking in nature); or (b) as set forth in the

which shall qualify the correspondingly numbered Sections or subsections
hereof to which such Purchaser Disclosure Schedule relates, and shall qualify
any other provision of this Agreement to which the relevance of the item so
disclosed to such other provision is reasonably apparent from the face of
such disclosure), the Purchaser hereby represents and warrants to the Sellers
as follows:

  

   

43

 



    



  

Section 4.1   _Organization; Standing and Power_.

existing and in good standing under the Laws of its jurisdiction of
organization. The Purchaser has all requisite power and authority to own,
operate and lease its respective properties and carry on its business as
presently being conducted in all material respects.

  



  

(b)  The Purchaser is qualified to do business as a foreign
corporation and is in good standing under the Laws of any state of the United
States or foreign jurisdiction in which the character of the properties owned
or leased by it, therein or in which the transaction of its business makes
such qualification necessary, except where the failure to be so qualified
would not have, and would not reasonably be expected to have, individually or
in the aggregate, a Purchaser Material Adverse Effect.

  



  

Section 4.2   _Capital Structure of Purchaser_. As of the
date of this Agreement, the share capital of the Purchaser is $22,100
divided into 200,000,000 Class A ordinary shares of a par value of $0.0001
each (" _Class A Ordinary Shares_ "), 20,000,000 Class B ordinary shares of a
par value of $0.0001 each (" _Class B Ordinary Shares_ "), and 1,000,000
preference shares of a par value of $0.0001 each. The Purchaser has issued

Ordinary Share and one-half of one Purchaser Warrant (each, a " _Purchaser

were issued and outstanding. The issued and outstanding Class B Ordinary
Shares are convertible into up to 7,500,000 Class A Ordinary Shares upon

irrevocably waived any anti-dilution adjustment as to the ratio by which Class
B Ordinary Shares convert into Class A Ordinary Shares or any other measure
with an anti-dilutive effect, in any case, that results from or is related to
the Transactions. All issued and outstanding Class A Ordinary Shares, Class B
Ordinary Shares, Purchaser Warrants and Purchaser Units are validly issued,
fully paid and non-assessable and are not subject to preemptive rights. Except
for the Purchaser Warrants and Purchaser Units, there are no outstanding (a)
securities of the Purchaser convertible into or exchangeable for shares or
other equity interests or voting securities of the Purchaser, (b) options,
warrants or other rights (including preemptive rights) or agreements,
arrangement or commitments of any character, whether or not contingent, of the
Purchaser to acquire from any Person, and no obligation of the Purchaser to
issue, any shares or other equity interests or voting securities of the
Purchaser or any securities convertible into or exchangeable for such shares
or other equity interest or voting securities, (c) equity equivalents or
other similar rights of or with respect to the Purchaser, or (d) obligations
of the Purchaser to repurchase, redeem, or otherwise acquire any of the
foregoing securities, shares, options, equity equivalents, interests or

participation or voting right or other investment (whether debt, equity or
otherwise) in any Person (including any Contract in the nature of a voting
trust or similar agreement or understanding) or any other equity
equivalents in or issued by any other Person. The Purchaser Sponsor and its

(with only the fee amounts and market flex provisions contained in such fee
letter redacted), in each case as may be amended or replaced in accordance
with the terms hereof, and taken together with any Term Loan B Debt
Commitment Letter, the " _Debt Commitment Letter_ ") from The Toronto-
Dominion Bank, New York Branch and TD Securities (USA) LLC (together with
each Affiliate thereof and each former, current and future Representative of
each such Person, the " _Debt Providers_ "), relating to the commitment of the
Debt Providers to provide, subject only to the terms and conditions set forth
therein, the full amount of the debt financing stated therein (together with
any Term Loan B Financing, the " _Debt Financing_ " and together with the
Additional Equity Financing, if any, the " _Financing_ ").

  



  

   

48

 



    

   



  

(b)  Except as set forth in the Debt Commitment Letter, there
are no conditions precedent to the obligations of the Debt Providers to
provide the Debt Financing or any contingencies that would permit the Debt
Providers to reduce the total amount of the Debt Financing. There are no side
letters or other Contracts relating to the funding or investing, as
applicable, of the full amount of the Debt Financing.

  



  

(c)  As of the date of this Agreement, the Debt Commitment
Letter is valid, binding and enforceable in accordance with its terms except
as may be limited by the Enforceability Exceptions. As of the date of this
Agreement, no event has occurred that, with or without notice, lapse of time,
or both, would reasonably be expected to constitute a default or breach or a
failure to satisfy a condition precedent on the part of the Purchaser under
the terms and conditions of the Debt Commitment Letter (for the avoidance of
doubt, excluding the accuracy of the representation and warranties in _Article
III_ and the compliance in all material respects by the Sellers and the
Acquired Companies of the terms and conditions of this Agreement). The Debt
Commitment Letter has not been amended, restated or otherwise modified or
waived on or prior to the date of this Agreement and as of the Closing
Date, and the commitments contained in the Debt Commitment Letter have not
been withdrawn, modified or rescinded on or prior to the date of this
Agreement, in each case, except as permitted by _Section 5.14_. The Purchaser
has paid in full any and all commitment fees or other fees or expenses
required to be paid pursuant to the terms of the Debt Commitment Letter, each
of the foregoing to the extent required by the Debt Commitment Letter to be
paid on or before the date of this Agreement.

  



  

(d)  Assuming the satisfaction of the conditions set forth in
_Section 8.1_ and _Section 8.2_, and after giving effect to (i) any
Additional Equity Financing, and (ii) the Debt Financing, when fully funded in
accordance with the Debt Commitment Letter, together with all available
amounts in the Trust Account, will provide the Purchaser at the Closing with
all funds necessary to pay the Cash Consideration and the Transaction Costs
(such obligations collectively, the " _Aggregate Cash Obligations_ ").

  



  

(e)  To the Knowledge of the Purchaser, on the date of this
Agreement, there is no fact or occurrence as of the date hereof that would
cause any condition to the funding of the Financing not to be satisfied at or
before the Closing, and the Purchaser has no reason to believe that it will
be unable to satisfy on a timely basis any term or condition of the Financing
contained in the Debt Commitment Letter, except for the accuracy of the
representation and warranties in _Article III_ and the compliance in all
material respects by the Sellers and the Acquired Companies of the terms and
conditions of this Agreement.

  



  

(f)  Subject to _Section 8.1(d)_ and _Section 9.1(b)(iv)_, in
no event shall the receipt or availability of any funds or financing
(including the Financing) by the Purchaser or any Affiliate of the Purchaser
or any other financing or other transactions be a condition to any of the
Purchaser's obligations hereunder.

  



  

Section 4.16   _Solvency_.

  



  

(a) Assuming all conditions set forth in _Section 8.1(d)_ and
_Section 8.2_ have been satisfied or waived, immediately after giving effect
to the consummation of the Transactions, including the Financing, the
Purchaser will be, on a consolidated basis with its Subsidiaries, Solvent.
For purposes of this _Section 4.16_, " _Solvent_ " means, with respect to
any Person, that:

  



  

   

49

 



    



  

(i) the fair saleable value (determined on a going concern
basis) of the assets of such Person shall be greater than the total
amount required to pay such Person's debts (including a reasonable estimate
of the amount of all contingent Liabilities);

  



  

(ii)  such Person shall be able to pay its debts in the
ordinary course of business consistent with past practice as they become due;
and

  



  

(iii) such Person shall have adequate capital to carry on its
business.

the Sellers, their Affiliates or any of their Representatives by or on behalf
of the Purchaser. Neither the Purchaser nor any other Person or entity on

Order or approval pursuant to this Agreement and to the extent that the
Sellers make any such payments prior to Closing, the Adjustment Amount will
be modified in accordance with the terms set forth in the
definition. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement, under
no circumstances shall the Sellers or any of their Affiliates be required to

provided on an outside counsel-only basis, and/or may be redacted (A)
to remove references concerning competitively sensitive information and the
valuation of the Business and the transactions contemplated thereby and (B)
as necessary to comply with contractual arrangements. Each Party shall,
subject to applicable Law, permit counsel for the other Parties a reasonable
opportunity to review in advance, and consider in good faith the views of the
other Party in connection with, any proposed written communication, draft
filing, correspondence or submission to any Governmental Entity in connection
with the Transactions. Each Party agrees not to participate, or to permit any
of its Affiliates or their respective Representatives to participate, in any
meeting or discussion, either in person or by telephone, with any Governmental
Entity in connection with the Transactions, unless it consults with the other
Parties in advance and, to the extent not prohibited by such Governmental
Entity, gives the other Parties the opportunity to attend and participate.

  



  

(e)  Any information provided to any Party or its
Representatives to another Party or its Representatives in accordance with
this _Section 5.3_ or otherwise pursuant to this Agreement shall be held by
the receiving Party and its Representatives in accordance with, and shall be
subject to, the confidentiality obligations set forth in the
Confidentiality Agreement.

  



  

(f)  During the period from the date hereof until the earlier
of the termination of this Agreement in accordance with its terms and the
Closing Date, the Parties shall not, and shall not permit any of their
Affiliates to, knowingly take any action that could prevent, materially delay
or materially impede the consummation of the Transaction.

  



  

Section 5.4   _Further Assurances_. The Sellers and the
Purchaser shall execute and deliver, or cause to be executed or
delivered, all additional documents, agreements and other instruments and
take all such further action as may be necessary to carry out the purposes
and intents of this Agreement and applicable Law and to consummate such
further transactions as may be reasonably required hereby or thereby.

  



  

Section 5.5 _Public Announcements_. The Purchaser and
Sellers have agreed to the text of a press release announcing the execution of
this Agreement. Except as may be required to comply with the requirements of
any applicable Law or the rules and regulations of any stock exchange or
national market system upon which the securities of the Purchaser are listed,
including the filing of any Current Report on Form 8-K or other appropriate
filings with the SEC, no Party will issue any press release or other public
announcement relating to the subject matter of this Agreement or the
Transactions without the prior written consent of the Sellers, in the case of
the Purchaser, or the Purchaser, in the case of the Sellers. Notwithstanding
the foregoing, without such prior written consent, the Purchaser shall be
permitted to issue a press release or other public announcement containing
information relating to this Agreement or the Transactions that is
substantially consistent with information included in a press release or
other public announcement previously approved pursuant to the preceding
sentence.

Section 5.6   _Insurance_.

  



  

(a)  From and after the Closing, with respect to any Losses,
damages and Liability incurred by any of the Acquired Companies arising out
of acts or omissions prior to the Closing, the Sellers will provide the
Acquired Companies with access to, and the Acquired Companies may make claims
under, in each case at the sole expense of the Acquired Companies, the
Sellers' third-party occurrence-based insurance policies that were in place
immediately prior to the Closing, but solely to the extent that such
policies provided coverage for the Acquired Companies with respect to events
occurring prior to the Closing; _provided_ that such access to, and the right
to make claims under, such insurance policies, shall be subject to the terms
and conditions of such insurance policies, including any limits on coverage
or scope, any deductibles and other fees and expenses, and shall be subject to
the following additional conditions:

  



  

(i)  the Purchaser shall indemnify, hold harmless and reimburse
the Sellers and their Affiliates for any deductibles, self-insured retention
or fees and expenses incurred by the Sellers or their Affiliates to the extent
resulting from any access to, any claims made by the Acquired Companies
under, any insurance policy of the Sellers or their Affiliates provided
pursuant to this _Section 5.6(a)_, including any indemnity payments,
settlements, judgments, legal fees and allocated claims expenses and claim
handling fees, whether such claims are made by the Acquired Companies, their
respective employees or third parties (collectively, " _Insurance Costs_ ");

  



  

(ii)  from time to time upon the prior written request of the
Sellers, and in any event prior to submitting any claim that would reasonably
be expected to result in the incurrence by the Sellers (without giving effect
to any indemnification by the Purchaser pursuant to _Section 5.6(a)(i)_) of
any Insurance Costs, the Purchaser shall provide a reasonably detailed
description regarding any such claims to the Sellers, as promptly as
practicable;

  



  

(iii)  in connection with the matters described in this _Section
5.6(a)_, the Purchaser shall be responsible for making payments directly to
insurers, insurance brokers and third-party claims administrators and shall
take all appropriate action to insure that no Insurance Costs in respect of
claims of the Acquired Companies are incurred by the Sellers in connection
with any insurance provided pursuant to this _Section 5.6(a)_ unless such
Insurance Costs are fully reimbursed by the Purchaser;

  



  

(iv)  the Sellers shall have no obligations to incur any
unreimbursed Insurance Costs in respect of any such claims;

  



    

59

 



    



  

(v)  the Purchaser shall not, and shall cause the Acquired
Companies not to, in connection with any claim by the Acquired Companies
under any insurance policy of the Sellers or their Affiliates pursuant to this
_Section 5.6(a)_, take any action that would be reasonably likely to (A)
result in the applicable insurance company terminating or reducing coverage,
or increasing in any material respect the amount of any premium owed by the
Sellers or their Subsidiaries under the applicable insurance policy or (B)
otherwise compromise, materially and adversely jeopardize or interfere with
the rights of the Sellers or their Subsidiaries under the applicable policy;
and

  



  

(vi)  in the event an insurance policy aggregate is exhausted, or
believed likely to be exhausted, due to noticed claims, the Purchaser, on the
one hand, and the Sellers, on the other hand, shall be responsible for their
pro rata portion of the reinstatement premium, if any, based upon the losses
submitted by each of them (or their respective Subsidiaries) from and after
the date of Closing to the Sellers' insurance carrier(s); _provided_ , that
the Sellers may elect not to reinstate the policy aggregate.

  



  

(b)  Except as set forth in this _Section 5.6(b)_, the
Purchaser acknowledges that from and after the Closing, the Acquired
Companies shall cease to be insured by the Sellers' or their Affiliates'
respective current and historical insurance policies or programs or by any of
their current and historical self-insured programs, and neither the Purchaser
nor the Acquired Companies shall have any access, right, title or interest to
or in any such insurance policies, programs or self-insured programs
(including to all claims and rights to make claims and all right to proceeds)
to cover any assets of the Acquired Companies or any Liability arising from
the operation of the Business. The Sellers and their Affiliates may, effective
at or after the Closing, amend any insurance policies and ancillary
arrangements in the manner they deem appropriate to give effect to this
_Section 5.6_. From and after the Closing, the Purchaser shall be
responsible for securing all insurance it considers appropriate for its
operation of the Acquired Company and the Business.

  



  

(c)  This Agreement shall not be considered an attempted
assignment of any policy of insurance or as a contract of insurance and shall
not be construed to waive any right or remedy of any of the Sellers or their
Subsidiaries in respect of any insurance policy or any other contract or
policy of insurance.

  



  

Section 5.7   _Control of Operations_. Without in any way
limiting any Party's rights or obligations under this Agreement including 
_Section 5.1_, the Parties understand and agree that nothing contained in
this Agreement shall give the Purchaser, directly or indirectly, the right to
control or direct the Business' operations prior to the Closing.

  



  

Section 5.8   _Intercompany Arrangements_.

  



  

(a)  As of the Closing, all accounts (including Indebtedness),
except for those accounts listed on _Section 5.8(a)_ of the Sellers
Disclosure Schedule, between the Sellers and/or any of their Affiliates, on
the one hand, and any of the Acquired Companies, on the other hand, shall be
settled or otherwise eliminated without creating any Liability to the
Purchaser or any of the Acquired Companies that would remain outstanding as
of immediately after the Closing.

  



    

60

 



    



  

(b)  Effective at the Closing, other than any accounts governed
by _Section 5.8(a)_ and the Contracts listed on _Section 5.8(b)_ of the
Sellers Disclosure Schedule, all Contracts, including all obligations to
provide goods, services or other benefits, between any of the Sellers or any
of their Affiliates, on the one hand, and any of the Acquired Companies, on
the other hand, shall be terminated without any party having any continuing
obligations or Liability to the other.

  



  

Section 5.9   _Restrictive Covenants_.

  



  

(a)  For one year following the Closing, subject to the other
terms of this _Section 5.9_, the Sellers shall not (directly or indirectly
through any Affiliate), and shall cause their Affiliates not to, own, hold or
control any equity interests in any Person whose primary business is the
manufacture, supply, distribution and sale of aspartame, sucralose, saccharin
and stevia branded tabletop sweeteners, licorice extracts and licorice
derivatives (such business, collectively, as conducted by the Acquired
Companies on the date hereof, the " _Restricted Business_ ") (or otherwise
operate or engage in any Restricted Business);  _provided_ , _however_ , that
the foregoing shall not prohibit the Sellers or any of their Affiliates from
making a passive investment in the capital stock or other interest of an
issuer so long as such restricted party does not acquire, directly or
indirectly, more than five percent (5%) equity interest in a Person engaged
in a Restricted Business; _provided_ , _however_ , in the event that the
Sellers or their Affiliates dispose of an investment in existence prior to
Closing, and in connection with such disposition receive equity interests in
a Person engaged in a Restricted Business, the five percent (5%) ownership
threshold referenced herein shall increase to twenty percent (20%) solely
with respect to the securities received in connection with such disposition; 
_provided_ , _further_ , nothing herein shall permit the Sellers or their
Affiliates to make standalone acquisitions beyond the five percent (5%)
threshold and such accretion shall only be permitted directly in connection
with a relevant disposition.

  



  

(b)  For one (1) year following the Closing Date, subject to the
terms of this _Section 5.9_, the Sellers shall not (directly or indirectly
through any Subsidiary), and shall cause their Affiliates not to solicit for
employment or otherwise engage (whether as an employee, consultant or
otherwise) or hire any Person that is an executive officer of the Acquired
Companies as of the Closing Date or any Key Business Employee, _provided_ ,
_however_ , that nothing in this _Section 5.9(b)_ shall preclude the Sellers
or their Affiliates and their respective officers, directors and employees
from (A) soliciting and hiring any such individual who has not been employed
by the Purchaser or its Affiliates for a period of at least six (6) months
prior to commencement of employment discussions between the Sellers, or their
respective officers, directors or employees and such individual, or (B)
making any general or public solicitation not targeted at employees of the
Purchaser or any of its Affiliates and hiring any Person who responds
thereto; _provided_ , _however_ , that the foregoing shall not restrict
publicly traded portfolio companies of the Sellers and their Affiliates, from
soliciting, engaging or hiring any person; _provided_ , _further_  that the
Sellers will not direct such otherwise unrestricted portfolio companies to
take actions in contravention of this provision.

  



  

(c) The Parties acknowledge and agree that the covenants and
provisions in this _Section 5.9_ are reasonable in duration, geographic area
and scope and separate and divisible and, if any such covenant or provision is
determined to be unenforceable or invalid for any reason, it shall be
reformed to have the closest possible effect, consistent with applicable Law,
to the original covenant or provision and the remaining covenants shall be
unaffected. Each of the Sellers acknowledges that the restrictions contained
in this _Section 5.9_ are reasonable and necessary to protect the
legitimate interests of the Purchaser and constitute a material inducement to
the Purchaser to enter into this Agreement and consummate the Transactions.

  



  

   

61

 



    



  

Section 5.10   _The Form S-4, Proxy Statement and the
Purchaser Extraordinary General Meeting_.

  



  

(a)  As promptly as reasonably practicable after the date of
this Agreement, but in any event within the later of (i) thirty (30) days
from the date hereof and (ii) ten (10) Business Days following delivery of
information required to be provided by the Sellers or such later date as the
Parties agree, the Purchaser will prepare and file with the SEC the Form S-4
containing a proxy statement containing the information specified in Schedule
14A of the Exchange Act with respect to the Transactions and to the extent
required the Designated Directors (the " _Proxy Statement_ ") in preliminary
form. The Purchaser shall as promptly as reasonably practicable notify the
Sellers of the receipt of any oral or written comments from the SEC relating
to the Form S-4 or Proxy Statement and any request by the SEC for any
amendment to the Form S-4 or Proxy Statement or for additional
information. The Purchaser shall use reasonable best efforts to cooperate and
provide the Sellers with a reasonable opportunity to review and comment on
the Form S-4 or Proxy Statement (including each amendment or supplement
thereto) and all responses to requests for additional information by and
replies to comments of the SEC and give due consideration to all comments
reasonably proposed by the Sellers in respect of such documents and responses
prior to filing such with or sending such to the SEC, and the Parties will
provide each other with copies of all such filings made and correspondence
with the SEC. Except in the case of a Change in Recommendation pursuant to
_Section 5.10(d)_, the Purchaser Board Recommendation shall be included in
the Proxy Statement. The Purchaser will use its reasonable best efforts to
respond promptly to any comments made by the SEC with respect to the Form S-4
or Proxy Statement. The Purchaser will cause the Proxy Statement to be
transmitted to the Purchaser Shareholders as promptly as reasonably
practicable, but in any event within five (5) Business Days, following the
date on which the SEC confirms it has no further comments on the Form S-4 and
Proxy Statement.

  



  

(b) The Sellers acknowledge that a substantial portion of the
Form S-4 and Proxy Statement shall include disclosure regarding the Business
and the Acquired Companies. Accordingly, the Sellers will, as promptly as
reasonably practicable after the date of this Agreement, use their respective
reasonable best efforts to provide the Purchaser with all information
concerning the operations and business of the Business and the Acquired
Companies and the Business's management and operations and financial
condition, in each case, required or reasonably requested by the Purchaser to
be included in the Form S-4 and Proxy Statement, including (i) the required
financial statements of the Business prepared in accordance with SEC
Guidance, including the requirements of Regulation S-X and a related consent
from the Business's independent public accountants, (ii) required selected
financial data of the Business required by Item 301 of Regulation S-K and
(iii) required management's discussion and analysis for the periods required
under applicable SEC Guidance. Without limiting the generality of the
foregoing, the Sellers shall use their respective reasonable best efforts to
cooperate with the Purchaser in connection with the preparation for inclusion
in the Form S-4 and Proxy Statement of pro forma financial statements
that comply with SEC Guidance, including the requirements of Regulation S-X
(it being understood that the Purchaser shall be responsible for the
preparation of any pro forma calculations, any post-Closing or other pro forma
cost savings, capitalization, ownership or other pro forma adjustments that
may be included therein). The Sellers shall use reasonable best efforts to
make the managers, directors, officers and employees of the Acquired Companies
available to the Purchaser and its counsel (and other Representatives engaged
in connection with the preparation of the Form S-4 and Proxy Statement)
in connection with the drafting of the Form s-4 and Proxy Statement, as
reasonably requested by the Purchaser, and responding in a timely manner to
comments on the Form S-4, Proxy Statement and such other filings from the SEC.

  



  

   

62

 



    



  

(c)  The Purchaser will take, in accordance with applicable Law,
NASDAQ rules and the Purchaser Constitutional Documents, all action necessary
to call, hold and convene an extraordinary general meeting of the Purchaser
(including any permitted adjournment (the " _Purchaser Extraordinary General
Meeting_ ") to consider and vote upon the Purchaser Shareholder Proposals as
promptly as practicable after the filing of the Form S-4 and Proxy Statement
in definitive form with the SEC and in no event less than fifteen (15)
Business Days (" _Inside Date_ ") or more than thirty-five (35) days after the
definitive Form S-4 and Proxy Statement is first transmitted to the Purchaser
Shareholders, subject to the adjournment provisions below. Once the Purchaser
Extraordinary General Meeting to consider and vote upon the Purchaser
Shareholder Proposals has been called and noticed, except as required by Law,
the Purchaser will not postpone or adjourn the Purchaser Extraordinary General
Meeting without the consent of the Sellers (which consent will not be
unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed) other than (1) for the absence
of a quorum, or (2) to allow reasonable additional time for the filing and
mailing of any supplemental or amended disclosure that the Purchaser has
determined in good faith, after consultation with its outside legal advisors,
is necessary under applicable Law and for such supplemental or amended
disclosure to be disseminated to and reviewed by the Purchaser Shareholders
prior to the Purchaser Extraordinary General Meeting or (3) an adjournment or
postponement to solicit additional proxies from the Purchaser Shareholders to
the extent the Purchaser has determined in good faith that such adjournment or
postponement is reasonably necessary to obtain the approval of the Required
Purchaser Shareholder Proposals, _provided_ , that in the case of an
postponement or adjournment in accordance with clause (1), (2) or (3), above,
such postponement or adjournment (i) may be no more than ten (10) Business
Days from the original date of the Purchaser Extraordinary General Meeting
and (ii) for the avoidance of doubt shall not require the consent of the
Sellers. Subject to _Section 5.10(d)_, following delivery of the Form S-4 and
Proxy Statement to the Purchaser Shareholders, the Purchaser will use
reasonable best efforts to solicit approval of the Purchaser Shareholder
Proposals by the Purchaser Shareholders.

  



  

(d) Subject to this _Section 5.10(d)_, the Purchaser Board
will recommend that the Purchaser Shareholders approve the
Purchaser Shareholder Proposals (the " _Purchaser Board Recommendation_ ").
Notwithstanding the foregoing, at any time prior to obtaining approval of the
Purchaser Shareholder Proposals, the Purchaser Board may fail to make,
amend, change, withdraw, modify, withhold or qualify the Purchaser Board
Recommendation (any such action a " _Change in Recommendation_ ") if the
Purchaser Board shall have concluded in good faith, after consultation with
its outside legal advisors and financial advisors, that a failure to make a
Change in Recommendation would violate its fiduciary duties under applicable
Law; _provided_ , _however_ _,_ that the Purchaser Board shall not be entitled
to exercise its rights to make a Change in Recommendation pursuant to this
sentence unless (i) such Change in Recommendation is based upon
an Intervening Event and (ii) unless the Purchaser has provided to the
Sellers three (3) Business Days' prior written notice advising the Sellers
that the Purchaser Board intends to take such action and specifying the
reasons therefor in reasonable detail (the " _Notice Period_ "). During the
Notice Period, if requested by the Sellers, the Purchaser shall engage in
good faith negotiations with the Sellers regarding any amendment to this
Agreement proposed in writing by the Sellers that would reasonably be
expected to obviate the need to effect a Change in Recommendation.
The Purchaser Board shall consider in good faith any proposed amendments to
this Agreement and any other agreements that may be proposed in writing by
the Sellers no later than 11:59 p.m., New York City time, on the last day of
the Notice Period. Any material changes related to such Intervening Event
shall constitute a new Intervening Event and the Purchaser shall be required
to deliver a new written notice to the Sellers and again comply with the
requirements of this section with respect to such new written notice. The
Purchaser agrees that, unless the Agreement is terminated in accordance with
its terms, its obligation to establish a record date for, duly call, give
notice of, convene and hold the Purchaser Extraordinary General Meeting for
the purpose of voting on the Purchaser Shareholder Proposals shall not be
affected by any Change in Recommendation, and the Purchaser agrees to
establish a record date for, duly call, give notice of, convene and hold
the Purchaser Extraordinary General Meeting and submit for the approval of
the Purchaser Shareholders the matters contemplated by the Proxy Statement,
regardless of whether or not there shall be any Change in Recommendation.

  



  

   

63

 



    



  

(e)  If at any time prior to the Closing Date, any event,
circumstance or information relating to the Purchaser or the Sellers, the
Acquired Companies or any of their respective Affiliates, officers or
directors or other Representatives should be discovered by the Purchaser or
the Sellers, as applicable, that in the reasonable judgment of the Purchaser
should be set forth in an amendment or supplement to the Form S-4 and Proxy
Statement, so that such documents would not include any misstatement of a
material fact or omit to state any material fact necessary to make the
statements therein, in light of the circumstances under which they were made,
not misleading, the Party which discovers such information shall promptly
notify the other Parties, and an appropriate amendment or supplement
describing such information shall be filed as promptly as reasonably
practicable with the SEC by the Purchaser and disseminated to the holders of
the Class A Ordinary Shares; _provided_ that no information received by the
Purchaser pursuant to this _Section 5.10(e)_ shall be deemed to change,
supplement or amend the Sellers Disclosure Schedule.

  



  

(f)  Subject to this _Section 5.10_, the Purchaser shall use
reasonable best efforts to complete the Offer as promptly as practicable and
shall not terminate or withdraw the Offer other than in connection with the
valid termination of this Agreement. The Purchaser shall extend the Offer for
any period required by any rule, regulation, interpretation or position of the
SEC, NASDAQ or the respective staff thereof that is applicable to the Offer.
Nothing in this _Section 5.10(f)_ shall (i) impose any obligation on the
Purchaser to extend the Offer beyond the Outside Date, or (ii) be deemed to
impair, limit or otherwise restrict in any manner the right of the Purchaser
to terminate this Agreement in accordance its terms.

  



  

Section 5.11 _Trust_. Upon satisfaction or waiver of the
conditions set forth in _Article VIII_ (other than those conditions that
by their nature are to be satisfied at Closing, but subject to the
satisfaction or waiver of those conditions) (including but not limited to
_Section 8.1(d)_) and provision of notice thereof to the Trustee, in
accordance with, subject to and pursuant to the Trust Agreement and the
Purchaser Constitutional Documents, at the Closing, the Purchaser (a)
shall cause the documents, opinions and notices required to be delivered to
the Trustee pursuant to the Trust Agreement to be so delivered and (b) shall
use its reasonable best efforts to cause the Trustee to (i) pay as and when
due all amounts payable to the Purchaser Shareholders holding the Class A
Ordinary Shares sold in the IPO who shall have previously validly elected to
redeem their Class A Ordinary Shares pursuant to the Purchaser Constitutional
Documents, and (ii) immediately thereafter, pay all remaining amounts then
available in the Trust Account to the Purchaser for immediate use, subject to
this Agreement and the Trust Agreement.

  



  

   

64

 



    



  

Section 5.12   _Exclusivity_. From the date of this Agreement
until the earlier of the Closing or the termination of this Agreement:

  



  

(a)  None of the Sellers nor any of the Acquired Companies shall
take, nor shall any of them permit any of their respective Representatives to
take, any action to solicit, encourage, initiate or engage in discussions or
negotiations with, or provide any information to or enter into any agreement
with any Person (other than the Purchaser and/or any of its Affiliates)
concerning any purchase of any of the Acquired Companies' equity securities
or any merger, sale of substantial assets or similar transaction
involving any of the Acquired Companies, other than assets sold in the
ordinary course of business (each such acquisition transaction, an "
_Acquisition Transaction_ "). The Sellers shall, and shall cause the Acquired
Companies and any of their respective Representatives to, immediately cease
and cause to be terminated all existing discussions, conversations,
negotiations and other communications with any Person (other than Purchaser
and its Affiliates) with respect to any of the foregoing. The Purchaser
hereby acknowledges that prior to the date of this Agreement, the Sellers and
the Acquired Companies have provided information relating to the Acquired
Companies and has afforded access to, and engaged in discussions with, other
Persons in connection with a proposed Acquisition Transaction and that such
information, access and discussions could reasonably enable another Person to
form a basis for an Acquisition Transaction without any breach by the Sellers
or the Acquired Companies of this _Section 5.12(a)_. Notwithstanding the
foregoing, any of the Sellers, the Acquired Companies or their respective
Representatives may respond to any unsolicited proposal regarding an
Acquisition Transaction by indicating that the Sellers and the Acquired
Companies are subject to an exclusivity agreement and are unable to provide
any information related to the Acquired Companies or entertain any
proposals or offers or engage in any negotiations or discussions concerning
an Acquisition Transaction so long as such exclusivity agreement remains in
effect. The Sellers shall promptly (but in any event within forty-eight hours)
notify the Purchaser if any of the Seller, any Acquired Company or any of
their Representatives receive any offer for, or any solicitation to discuss or
negotiate, an Acquisition Transaction.

  



  

(b) The Purchaser shall not take, and shall cause its
Affiliates and their respective Representatives not to take, any action
to solicit, encourage, initiate or engage in discussions or negotiations
with, or provide any information to or enter into any agreement with any
Person (other than the Sellers and/or any of their Affiliates) concerning any
Business Combination (each such transaction, a " _Business Combination
Transaction_ "). The Purchaser shall, and shall cause its Affiliates and
their respective Representatives to, immediately cease and cause to be
terminated all existing discussions, conversations, negotiations and other
communications with any Person (other than the Sellers and their Affiliates)
with respect to any of the foregoing. The Sellers hereby acknowledge that
prior to the date of this Agreement, the Purchaser has provided information
relating to the Business Combination and has afforded access to, and engaged
in discussions with, other Persons in connection with a proposed Business
Combination Transaction and that such information, access and
discussions could reasonably enable another Person to form a basis for a
Business Combination Transaction without any breach by the Purchaser of this
_Section 5.12(b)_. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Purchaser, any of its
Affiliates and any of its or their respective Representatives may respond to
any unsolicited proposal regarding a Business Combination Transaction by
indicating that the Purchaser is subject to an exclusivity agreement and is
unable to entertain any proposals or offers or engage in any negotiations or
discussions concerning a Business Combination Transaction so long as such
exclusivity agreement remains in effect. The Purchaser shall promptly (but in
any event within forty-eight hours) notify the Sellers, if the Purchaser or
any of its Representatives receives any offer for, or any solicitation to
discuss or negotiate, an Business Combination Transaction.

  



  

   

65

 



    



  

Section 5.13   _Additional Financing_.

  



  

(a)  At any time from and after the date hereof, the Purchaser
may, at its sole discretion, procure additional equity financing in the form
of the issuance and sale of additional Class A Ordinary Shares from Persons
and on terms reasonably acceptable to the Sellers (the " _Additional Equity
Financing_ ").

  



  

(b)  The Purchaser shall, in consultation with the Sellers, use
reasonable best efforts to, as promptly as possible after the date hereof,
obtain a binding commitment for a "term loan B" facility on the terms set
forth on _Section 5.13_  of the Seller Disclosure Letter (such commitment
letter, a " _Term Loan B Commitment Letter_ ", and such financing, the "
_Term Loan B Financing_ ").

  



  

Section 5.14   _Financing_.

  



  

(a)  The Purchaser shall, in consultation with the Sellers, use
reasonable best efforts to take, or cause to be taken, all actions and to do,
or cause to be done, all things necessary to obtain and consummate the Debt
Financing (or, in the event any portion or all of the Debt Financing becomes
unavailable, alternative debt or equity financing (in an amount sufficient,
together with the remaining Debt Financing, if any, and any other sources
available to the Purchaser, to fund the payment of the Aggregate
Cash Obligations and satisfy any other obligations of the Purchaser
contemplated hereunder) from the same or other sources (such portion from
sources other than any source providing the Debt Financing contemplated by the
Debt Commitment Letter as of the date hereof, the " _Alternate Financing_
")), including using its reasonable best efforts to (i) in accordance with
and subject to the terms and conditions set forth therein, maintain in effect
the Debt Commitment Letter until the occurrence of the Closing, (ii)
negotiate and enter into definitive agreements with respect to the Financing
on terms and conditions no less favorable to the Purchaser (including, if
necessary, the flex provisions) than those contained therein on the date of
this Agreement, subject to any amendments or modifications thereto permitted
by the last sentence of this _Section 5.14(a)_, (iii) on or before the
Closing Date, satisfy (or obtain a waiver of) all conditions applicable to the
Purchaser that are within its control and contained in the Debt Commitment
Letter or any definitive agreements related to the Debt Financing, including
the payment of any fees on or substantially concurrently with the Closing
Date to the extent required as a condition to the Debt Financing, (iv) comply
with its obligations under the Debt Commitment Letter and any definitive
agreements related to the Debt Financing in accordance with and subject to
the terms and conditions set forth therein, (v) perform and satisfy its
obligations under the Debt Commitment Letter at or prior to the Closing, (vi)
fully enforce its rights under the Debt Commitment Letter or any definitive
agreements related to the Debt Financing and (vii) consummate the Debt
Financing at or prior to the Closing. For the avoidance of doubt and
notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, in no event shall the
foregoing sentence or the "reasonable best efforts" of the Purchaser be
deemed or construed to require the Purchaser to, and the Purchaser shall not
be required to (i) pay fees to the Debt Providers in the aggregate in excess
of those contemplated by the Debt Commitment Letter or (ii) agree to terms
that are less favorable than any terms set forth in the Debt Commitment Letter
(including the "market flex" provisions of any fee letters executed in
connection therewith) or any related agreements executed in connection
therewith. In each case, the Purchaser shall keep the Sellers informed on a
reasonable basis and in reasonable detail of the status of its efforts to
arrange the Debt Financing. The Purchaser shall give the Sellers prompt
written notice upon becoming aware of, or receiving notice or any other
communication with respect to, any actual breach of or default under the Debt
Commitment Letter or any definitive agreements related to the Debt Financing,
or any actual termination, withdrawal or rescission of the Debt Commitment
Letter or any credit agreement related to the Debt Financing, in each case,
prior to the Closing. Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the
contrary, the Purchaser expressly acknowledges and agrees that neither the
availability nor terms of the Debt Financing or any Alternate Financing are
conditions to the obligations of the Purchaser to consummate the Transactions,
and the Purchaser reaffirms its obligation to consummate the Transactions

however cooperate with the DandO Indemnified Person in the defense of any
Action; _provided_ , that none of the Purchaser and the Acquired

its full term, and honor all obligations thereunder (including the payment of
any applicable premiums).

Article VII 
  
 TAX MATTERS

  



  

Section 7.1   _Tax Year_. The Parties shall treat the
taxable year of the Acquired Companies as ending on the Closing Date
where required or allowable by Law and, except as provided under the "next
day rule" of Treasury Regulations Section 1.1502-76, shall allocate income to
the period ending on the Closing Date based on a closing of the books as of
the Closing Date. The Parties hereto agree that no ratable allocation
election under Treasury Regulations Section 1.1502-76(b)(2)(ii) or any other
similar Law shall be made with respect to the Transactions. In accordance
with Treasury Regulations Section 1.1502-76 and any similar Law, any income
or gain related to any extraordinary transaction that occurs on the Closing
Date after the Closing shall be allocated to the taxable period beginning
after the Closing Date. The Purchaser shall not take, or cause or permit any
Acquired Company to take, any action outside of the ordinary course of
business on the Closing Date after the Closing.

  



  

Section 7.2   _Pre-Closing Tax Returns_.

  



  

(a)  With respect to any Tax Return of an Acquired Company for
any Pre-Closing Tax Period that is required to be filed after the Closing
Date (a " _Pre-Closing Tax Return_ "), the Sellers shall appoint and engage,
at the Sellers' expense, a professional tax preparation firm (" _Tax
Preparer_ ") of its choosing to prepare and file any such Tax Return. Without
limiting the generality of _Section 7.4_, the Purchaser shall, and shall
cause its Affiliates (including, after the Closing, the Acquired Companies)
to, engage and cooperate with each such Tax Preparer in preparing and filing
any Pre-Closing Tax Return. The Parties shall instruct the Tax Preparer to
provide each of the Sellers and the Purchaser with a copy of any such Pre-
Closing Tax Return at least forty-five (45) days prior to the due date thereof
(taking into account any applicable extensions) for review and comment. The
Sellers and Tax Preparer shall prepare, or cause to be prepared, and the
relevant Acquired Company shall timely file, or cause to be timely filed,
such Pre-Closing Tax Return in a manner consistent with the past practices,
elections, and methods of the relevant Acquired Company, except as required
by applicable Law. Tax Preparer shall revise such Tax Return to reflect any
reasonable comments received from the Sellers not later than ten (10) days
before the due date thereof (taking into account any extensions). The
Purchaser shall not amend or revoke (or permit any of its Affiliates
(including, after the Closing, the Acquired Companies) to amend or revoke)
any Tax Return of any Acquired Company for any taxable period ending on or
before, or including, the Closing Date (or any notification or election
relating thereto) without the prior written consent of the Sellers.

  



  

   

75

 



    



  

(b)  The Purchaser shall prepare and timely file, or cause to be
prepared and timely filed, all Tax Returns of the Acquired Companies for any
Straddle Period (each a " _Straddle Period Return_ ") in a manner that is
consistent with the past practices, elections, and methods of the Acquired
Companies, except as required by applicable Law. The Purchaser shall deliver
to the Sellers for their review, comment and approval (which approval shall
not be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed) a copy of each such Tax
Return at least forty-five (45) days prior to the due date (taking into
account any extensions). The Purchaser shall reflect on any such Tax Return
any reasonable comments provided by the Sellers not later than ten (10) days
before the due date for filing such Tax Returns (taking into account
applicable extensions). To the extent not already addressed by _Section 7.1_
or the first sentence of this _Section 7.2(b)_, for purposes of the
allocation of Taxes during a Straddle Period, the amount of any Taxes based
on or measured by income or receipts of the Acquired Companies for the portion
of the Straddle Period ending on the Closing Date will be determined based on
an interim closing of the books as of the close of business on the Closing
Date and the amount of other Taxes of the Acquired Companies for a Straddle
Period that relates to the portion of the Straddle Period ending on the
Closing Date will be deemed to be the amount of such Tax for the entire
taxable period multiplied by a fraction the numerator of which is the number
of days in the taxable period ending on the Closing Date and the denominator
of which is the number of days in such Straddle Period.

  



  

Section 7.3   _Sellers ' Consolidated, Combined, Unitary Tax
Return_. Notwithstanding any other provision of this Agreement, (i) the
Sellers shall be entitled to control in all respects, and neither the
Purchaser nor any of their Affiliates (including, after the Closing Date, the
Acquired Companies) shall have any rights in respect of (1) any Tax Return of
the Sellers or a member of the Sellers Group or (2) any Combined Tax Return;
and (ii) the Sellers shall not be required to provide any person with
any such Tax Return or copy thereof (provided that to the extent that such
Tax Returns would be required to be delivered but for this  _Section 7.3_,
the person that would be required to deliver such Tax Returns shall instead
deliver pro forma Tax Returns relating solely to the Acquired Companies).

  



  

Section 7.4   _Cooperation_.

  



  

(a)  Each Party shall, and shall cause their Affiliates to,
provide to the other Party such cooperation, documentation and information as
either of them reasonably may request (including the provision of any
necessary powers of attorney) in (a) filing any Tax Return, amended Tax
Return or claim for refund; (b) preparing financial accounting statements; (c)
cooperating with financial statement auditors (including providing any
requested information); (d) determining a liability for Taxes or a right to a
refund of Taxes; and (e) conducting any audit, litigation, or Tax proceeding.
Each Party shall make its employees reasonably available on a mutually
convenient basis at its cost to provide explanation of any documents or
information so provided. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this
Agreement, in no event shall the Sellers or any of their Affiliates be
required to provide any Person with any Tax Return or copy of any Tax Return
of (x) the Sellers or any of their Affiliates or (y) a
consolidated, combined, or unitary group that includes the Sellers or any of
their Affiliates. Each Party shall retain all Tax Returns, schedules and work
papers, and all material records and other documents relating to Tax matters,
of the relevant entities for their respective Tax periods ending on or prior
to the Closing Date until the later of (x) the expiration of the statute of
limitations for the Tax periods to which the Tax Returns and other documents
relate, or (y) eight (8) years following the due date (without extension) for
such Tax Returns. Thereafter, the Party holding such Tax Returns or other
documents may dispose of them after offering the other Party reasonable
notice and opportunity to take possession of such Tax Returns and other
documents at such other Party's own expense ( _provided_ , that any such
notice must in any event be made in writing at least sixty (60) days prior to
such disposition).

  



  

   

76

 



    



  

Section 7.5   _Transfer Taxes_. Notwithstanding anything
to the contrary in this Agreement, the Purchaser shall pay, when due, and be
responsible for, any sales, use, transfer (including any indirect real estate
transfer), documentary, stamp, value-added, goods and services or similar
Taxes and related fees (" _Transfer Taxes_ ") imposed on or payable with
respect to the transactions undertaken pursuant to _Article II_. The Party
responsible under applicable Law for filing the Tax Returns with respect to
such Transfer Taxes shall prepare and timely file such Tax Returns and
promptly provide a copy of such Tax Return to the other Party. The Sellers
and the Purchaser shall, and shall cause their respective Affiliates to,
cooperate to timely prepare and file any Tax Returns or other filings
relating to such Transfer Taxes, including any claim for exemption or
exclusion from the application or imposition of any Transfer Taxes.

  



  

Section 7.6   _Tax Sharing Agreements_. The Sellers shall
terminate or cause to be terminated, on or before the Closing Date the rights
and obligations of the Acquired Companies pursuant to all Tax sharing
agreements or arrangements (other than this Agreement), if any, to which any
of the Acquired Companies, on the one hand, and the Sellers or any of their
Subsidiaries (other than the Acquired Companies), on the other hand, are
parties, and neither the Sellers nor any of their Affiliates nor any of the
Acquired Companies shall have any rights, obligations or Liabilities
thereunder after the Closing in respect of such agreements or arrangements.

  



  

Section 7.7   _Post-Closing Matters_. The Purchaser shall
not make (or permit to be made) (a) any election under Sections 336 or 338 of
the Code with respect to the acquisition of any Acquired Company or (b) any
election with respect to any Acquired Company (including any entity
classification election pursuant to Treasury Regulations Section 301.7701-3),
which election would be effective on or prior to the Closing Date or could
affect any transaction occurring on or prior to the Closing Date.

  



  

Section 7.8   _Tax Elections_.

  



  

(a)  The Sellers agree to (a) make an election under Treas. Reg.
1.1502-36(d)(6)(i) to reduce the Tax basis the relevant Seller has in its
shares of the relevant Acquired Company in the amount necessary to avoid
reducing the Tax attributes of such Acquired Company; provided, however, that
such Seller shall not be required to make an election under Treas. Reg.
1.1502-36(d)(6)(i) if such an election is not necessary to avoid reducing the
tax attributes of the relevant Acquired Company, and (b) without the
prior written consent of the Purchaser, to not make any other election under
Treas. Reg. §1.1502-36 that would eliminate or reduce the Tax basis of any
asset held by an Acquired Company on the Closing Date or any credit or other
favorable Tax attribute (such as a net operating loss or capital loss
carryover) of the Acquired Companies in existence on the Closing Date or
increase any of the Acquired Companies' taxable income for any period ending
after the Closing Date.

of the assets of the entities set forth on _Section 7.8(b)_  of the Sellers

and the Transferred Assets and Liabilities (the " _Purchase Price Allocation
Schedule_ "). The Purchase Price Allocation Schedule shall be prepared in
accordance with the applicable provisions of the Code and the
allocation(s) set forth in Section 7.9 of the Sellers Disclosure Schedule
(the " _Allocation Principles_ "). If within thirty (30) days of receiving
the Purchase Price Allocation Schedule, the Sellers have not objected, the
Purchase Price Allocation Schedule shall be final and binding. If within
thirty (30) days the Sellers object to the Purchase Price Allocation Schedule,
the Sellers and the Purchaser shall work in good faith to resolve any
disputes, provided that if after thirty (30) days, the Sellers and
the Purchaser are unable to agree, the Parties shall use the procedures set
forth in _Section 2.5(e)_ to resolve their dispute;  _provided_ , that any
Purchase Price Allocation Schedule determined by the Independent Accounting

borne fifty percent (50%) by the Sellers and fifty percent (50%) by the
Purchaser.

adjustments to the Purchase Price Allocation Schedule to reflect changes in

consistently with the Purchase Price Allocation Schedule (as appropriately
adjusted) and (3) not take any position during the course of any audit or
other legal Action that is inconsistent with such Purchase Price Allocation
Schedule, unless required by a determination of the applicable Taxing
Authority that is final.

_provided_ ,  _however_ , that (i) the Purchaser, at its own expense, shall
have the right to participate in any such Tax Contest controlled by the
Sellers pursuant to this _Section 7.10(b)_ and (ii) the Sellers shall not,
and shall not allow any Acquired Company to, settle, resolve or abandon a Tax
Contest that could result in the Purchaser or any of its Affiliates incurring

conditioned).

Section 10.3   _Governing Law; Waiver of Jury Trial_.

  



  

(a)  This Agreement shall be governed by and construed in
accordance with the laws of the State of New York (without regard to its laws
relating to choice-of-law) applicable to contracts between residents of that
State and executed in and to be performed entirely within that State. EACH

NEW YORK AND THE APPROPRIATE APPELLATE COURTS THEREFROM (the " _Chosen
Courts_ "), for any Action arising out of, or relating to, this Agreement or
the Transactions (including the Debt Financing), and each Party agrees not to
commence any Action relating hereto or thereto except in such court. Each
Party (i) waives any objection to laying venue in any such Action in the
Chosen Courts, (ii) waives any objection that the Chosen Courts are an
inconvenient forum or do not have jurisdiction over any Party and (iii)
without limiting other means of service of process permissible under
applicable Law, agrees that service of process upon such party in any such
Action will be effective if notice is given in accordance with _Section
10.5_.

THAT MAY ARISE UNDER THIS AGREEMENT IS LIKELY TO INVOLVE COMPLICATED AND
DIFFICULT ISSUES, AND THEREFORE EACH SUCH PARTY HEREBY IRREVOCABLY AND
UNCONDITIONALLY WAIVES, TO THE EXTENT PERMITTED BY LAW AT THE TIME OF
INSTITUTION OF THE APPLICABLE LITIGATION, ANY RIGHT SUCH PARTY MAY HAVE TO A
TRIAL BY JURY IN RESPECT OF ANY LITIGATION DIRECTLY OR INDIRECTLY ARISING OUT
OF OR RELATING TO THIS AGREEMENT OR THE TRANSACTIONS (INCLUDING THE DEBT
FINANCING). EACH PARTY CERTIFIES AND ACKNOWLEDGES THAT: (I) NO
REPRESENTATIVE, AGENT OR ATTORNEY OF ANY OTHER PARTY HAS REPRESENTED,
EXPRESSLY OR OTHERWISE, THAT SUCH OTHER PARTY WOULD NOT, IN THE EVENT OF
LITIGATION, SEEK TO ENFORCE THE FOREGOING WAIVER, (II) EACH PARTY UNDERSTANDS
AND HAS CONSIDERED THE IMPLICATIONS OF THIS WAIVER, (III) EACH PARTY MAKES
THIS WAIVER VOLUNTARILY, AND (IV) EACH PARTY HAS BEEN INDUCED TO ENTER INTO
THIS AGREEMENT BY, AMONG OTHER THINGS, THE MUTUAL WAIVERS AND CERTIFICATIONS
IN THIS _SECTION 10.3_.

Section 10.6   _Successors and Assigns_. This Agreement shall
be binding upon and inure to the benefit of the Parties and their
respective successors and permitted assigns; provided, however, that no Party
will assign its rights or delegate any or all of its obligations under this
Agreement without the express prior written consent of the other Party, except
that (i) the Sellers may assign their rights and obligations under this
Agreement to an Affiliate of the Sellers, and (ii) the Purchaser may assign
all or part of its respective rights under this Agreement and delegate all or
part of its respective obligations under this Agreement without such written
consent to (x) one or more of its Affiliates, in which event all the
obligations, liabilities, rights and powers of the Purchaser, and remedies
available to it under this Agreement shall extend to and be enforceable by
each such Affiliate(s); or (y) its sources of financing (including the Debt
Providers) as collateral security for any obligations arising in connection
with the financing of the Transactions; _provided_ that no such assignment
shall release the Sellers or the Purchaser from any liability or obligation
under this Agreement; _provided_ , _further_ , that, if either Party or its
successors or assigns (a) consolidates with or merges into any other Person
and is not the continuing or surviving entity of such consolidation or
merger, or (b) transfers or conveys all or substantially all of its equity,
properties or assets to any Person, then, in each case, such Party, as the
case may be, shall cause proper provision to be made so that such successors,
assigns or Person assume the obligations set forth in this Agreement of such
Party, as applicable. Any attempted assignment in violation of this  _Section
10.6_ shall be void. This _Section 10.6_ shall not be terminated or modified
in any manner that is materially adverse to the Debt Providers in their
capacities as such without the prior written consent of the Debt
Providers, it being expressly agreed that the Debt Providers are third-party
beneficiaries of this _Section 10.6_.

Section 10.7   _Amendments and Waivers_. This Agreement may
not be modified or amended except by an instrument or instruments in
writing and mutually signed by each of the Parties. Notwithstanding anything
to the contrary contained herein, _Section 10.3_ , the last proviso of
_Section 10.4_ , this _Section 10.7_ , _Section 10.8(b)_ , and _Section 10.14_
and the definition of Debt Providers (and any provision or definition of this
Agreement to the extent a modification, waiver or termination of
such provision would modify the substance of any of the foregoing provisions)
may only be amended if such amendment is approved in writing by the Debt
Providers, in each case, to the extent the proposed amendment affects the
provisions of such Section as it applies to the Debt Providers. Each Party
may, only by an instrument in writing, waive compliance by any other Party
with any term or provision of this Agreement on the part of such other Party
to be performed or complied with. The waiver by a Party of a breach of any
term or provision of this Agreement by another Party shall not be construed
as a waiver of any subsequent breach.

  



  

Section 10.8   _Specific Performance_.

  



  

(a)  The Parties hereby acknowledge and agree that irreparable
injury for which monetary damages (even if available) would not be an
adequate remedy would occur if any Parties hereto does not perform any
provision of this Agreement in accordance with its specified terms or
otherwise breaches such provisions. Accordingly, the Parties acknowledge and
agree that, prior to a valid termination, to prevent breaches or threatened
breaches by the Parties of any of their respective covenants or obligations
set forth in this Agreement, including its failure to take all actions
required under the express terms of this Agreement to consummate the
Transactions, and that prior to a valid termination of this Agreement, the
Parties shall be entitled to specific performance of such agreements and
covenants in such event and other equitable relief to prevent breaches of this
Agreement, in addition to any other remedy to which they are entitled at law
or in equity. Each of the Parties agrees that it will not oppose the granting
of any such injunction, specific performance and other equitable relief on
the basis that any other Party has an adequate remedy at Law or that any
award of specific performance is not an appropriate remedy for any reason at
Law or in equity. Each Party hereby waives any requirement to provide any
bond or other security in connection with such order or injunction.

  



  

(b)  Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the contrary,
in no event shall any of the Sellers or any equity holder thereof, nor any of
its or their respective Affiliates (other than, for the avoidance of doubt,
from and after the Closing, the Purchaser and its Affiliates), be entitled
to, or permitted to seek, specific performance against any of the Debt
Providers. This _Section 10.8(b)_ shall not be terminated or modified
without the prior written consent of the Debt Providers, it being expressly
agreed that the Debt Providers are third-party beneficiaries of this _Section
10.8(b)_.

  



  

Section 10.9   _Severability_. If any term, provision,
covenant or restriction of this Agreement is held by a court of
competent jurisdiction or other authority to be invalid, void or
unenforceable, the remainder of the terms, provisions, covenants and
restrictions of this Agreement shall remain in full force and effect and
shall in no way be affected, impaired or invalidated so long as the economic
or legal substance of the Transactions is not affected in any manner
materially adverse to any Party. Upon such a determination, the Parties shall
negotiate in good faith to modify this Agreement so as to effect the original
intent of the Parties as closely as possible in a mutually acceptable manner
in order that the Transactions be consummated as originally contemplated to
the fullest extent possible.

  



  

   

87

 



    



  

Section 10.10   _No Admission_. Nothing herein shall be deemed an
admission by the Sellers or any of their respective Affiliates, in any action
or proceeding by or on behalf of a third party, that such third party is or is
not in breach or violation of, or in default in, the performance or
observance of any term or provisions of any Contract.

  



  

Section 10.11   _No Recourse_. Notwithstanding anything to the
contrary contained herein, the Purchaser agrees that neither [Parent] nor its
Affiliates (other than the Sellers) shall have any liability to the Purchaser
or its representatives or equity holders on any basis (including, in
contract, tort, under federal or state securities laws or otherwise) and
neither the Purchaser nor its representatives shall make any claims
whatsoever against [Parent] or its Affiliates (other than the Sellers) or
their respective representatives in connection with this Agreement or the
Transactions.

  



  

Section 10.12   _Privileged Communications_. The Purchaser, for
itself and for the Acquired Companies following the Closing, and for the
Purchaser's and the Acquired Companies' respective successors and assigns,
acknowledges and agrees that all communications between the Sellers, their
Affiliates and the Acquired Companies, on the one hand, and counsel, on the
other hand, including Wachtell, Lipton, Rosen and Katz, made in connection with
the negotiation, preparation, execution, delivery and Closing under, or any
dispute or Action arising under or in connection with, this Agreement which,
immediately prior to the Closing, would be deemed to be
privileged communications of the Sellers and/or any their Affiliates
(including each of the Acquired Companies), and their counsel and would not
be subject to disclosure to the Purchaser in connection with any process
relating to a dispute arising under or in connection with this Agreement or
otherwise, shall continue after the Closing to be privileged communications
between the Sellers and such counsel and neither the Purchaser nor any Person
acting or purporting to act on behalf of or through the Purchaser shall seek
to obtain the same by any process on the grounds that the privilege attaching
to such communications belongs to the Acquired Companies following the
Closing and not the Sellers. The Purchaser agrees that any attorney-client
privilege, attorney work product protection, and expectation of client
confidence arising from or as a result of counsel's representation of the
Acquired Companies or the Sellers prior to the Closing, and all information
and documents covered by such privilege or protection, shall belong to and be
controlled by the Sellers and may be waived only by the Sellers, and not by
any of the Acquired Companies or any other Person, and shall not pass to or
be claimed or used by the Purchaser, the Acquired Companies or their
Affiliates.

Section 10.13   _Trust Account Waiver_. Reference is made to the
final prospectus of the Purchaser, filed with the SEC (File No.
333-230756) (the " _Prospectus_ "), and dated as of April 25, 2019. Each of
the Sellers acknowledges that it has read the Prospectus, the Trust Agreement
and the Purchaser Constitutional Documents and understands that the Purchaser
has established the Trust Account containing the proceeds of its initial
public offering (the " _IPO_ ") and from certain private placements
occurring simultaneously with the IPO, and interest accrued from time to time
thereon, for the benefit of the public Purchaser Shareholders and certain
parties (including the underwriters of the IPO) and that, except as otherwise
described in the Prospectus, the Purchaser may disburse monies from the Trust
Account only: (a) to the public Purchaser Shareholders in the event they elect
to exercise their Purchaser Shareholder Redemption Right, (b) to the public
Purchaser Shareholders if Purchaser fails to consummate a
Business Combination within twenty-four (24) months from the closing of the
IPO, (c) to pay any franchise and income taxes with any interest earned on
the amounts held in the Trust Account or (d) to the Purchaser after or
concurrently with the consummation of a Business Combination. For and in
consideration of the Purchaser entering into this Agreement with the Sellers
regarding the Transactions, and for other good and valuable consideration,
the receipt and sufficiency of which is hereby acknowledged, the Sellers
hereby agree on behalf of themselves and their Affiliates notwithstanding
anything to the contrary in this Agreement, neither the Sellers nor any of
their Affiliates (including the Acquired Companies) do now and shall at any
time hereafter have any right, title, interest or claim of any kind against
the Trust Account (including distributions therefrom), or make any claim or
bring any Action against, the Trust Account (including distributions
therefrom), and regardless of whether such claim arises as a result of, in
connection with or relating in any way to, any proposed or actual business
relationship between the Purchaser or its Representatives, on the one hand,
and the Sellers or any of their Affiliates (including the Acquired Companies)
or respective Representatives, on the other hand, this Agreement, the
Transactions or any other matter, and regardless of whether such claim arises
based on contract, tort, equity or any other theory of legal liability (any
and all such claims are collectively referred to hereafter as the "
_Released Claims_ "). Each of the Sellers, and their Affiliates (including
the Acquired Companies) and Representatives, (i) hereby irrevocably waives
any such Released Claims it may have against the Trust Account (including any
distributions therefrom) now or in the future as a result of, or arising out
of, this Agreement (including the negotiation, execution and performance
thereof) any other Contract with the Purchaser, the Transactions or any other
negotiations, Contracts or other agreements or arrangements with the
Purchaser and will not seek recourse against the Trust Account (including any
distributions therefrom) for any reason whatsoever (including for an alleged
breach of any agreement with the Purchaser or its Affiliates), (ii) agrees and
acknowledges that such irrevocable waiver is material to this Agreement and
specifically relied upon by the Purchaser to induce it to enter in this
Agreement, and each of the Sellers further intends and understands such waiver
to be valid, binding and enforceable under applicable Law and (iii)
acknowledges and agrees that, to the extent the Sellers or any of their
Affiliates (including the Acquired Companies) or Representatives commences
any Action based upon, in connection with, relating to or arising out of
any matter relating to the Purchaser, which Action seeks, in whole or in
part, monetary relief against the Purchaser, the sole remedy of any such
Person shall be against funds held outside of the Trust Account and that such
claim shall not permit the Acquired Companies or their Affiliates (or any
Person claiming on any of their behalves or in lieu of any of them) to have
any claim against the Trust Account (including any distributions therefrom)
or any amounts contained therein. Notwithstanding the foregoing, nothing in
this _Section 10.13_ shall serve to limit or prohibit the Sellers' right to
pursue a claim against the Purchaser for legal relief against assets of the
Purchaser held outside the Trust Account, for specific performance or other
non-monetary relief.

  



  

   

89

 



    



  

Section 10.14   _Lender Limitations_. Notwithstanding any
provision of this Agreement to the contrary, (i) each Seller hereby agrees on
its own behalf and on behalf of its Representatives that none of the Debt
Providers shall have any liability or obligations to the Sellers nor any of
their respective Representatives or permitted assigns relating to this
Agreement or any transactions contemplated by this Agreement (including the
Debt Financing), whether at law or equity, in contract, in tort or otherwise,
and (ii) in no event shall the Sellers nor any of their Representatives seek
to (A) enforce this Agreement against, make any claims for breach of this
Agreement against, (B) enforce the commitments against or make any claims for
breach of the Debt Commitment Letter against, or (C) recover monetary damages
from, or otherwise sue, any Debt Provider for the Debt Financing in
connection with (x) this Agreement, (y) the Transactions or (z) the
obligations of the Debt Providers for the Debt Financing under the
Debt Commitment Letter. This _Section 10.14_ may not be amended or otherwise
modified without the consent, not to be unreasonably withheld, of the Debt
Providers.
