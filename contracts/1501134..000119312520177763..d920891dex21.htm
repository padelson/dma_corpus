(b) _Cancellation of Securities Held by the Company_. Any shares of Company
Capital Stock that are owned by the Company immediately prior to the

that is issued and outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time (other

Agreement, be converted into the right to receive (without interest) the
following consideration, payable as set forth herein:

(i) a certificate or book entry reflecting an amount of shares of Parent
Common Stock equal to the Per Share Upfront Stock Consideration, which shares
shall be subject to the Lock-Up Restriction;

 

(ii) an amount of cash equal to the Per Share Upfront Cash Consideration;

 

(iii) after any Milestone is achieved (the date of any such achievement, a "
_Milestone Date_ "), a certificate or book entry reflecting an amount of
shares of Parent Common Stock equal to the applicable Per Share Milestone
Consideration, which shares shall be subject to the Lock-Up Restriction if

(iv) an amount of cash equal to the __quotient__ of (x) the Expense Fund
Amount, when and to the extent released to the Holders as provided herein,
__divided__ __by__ (y)  the Fully Diluted Shares of Company Stock.

2.7 _Effects of Reverse Merger on Company Options_.

 

(a) At the Effective Time, by virtue of the Reverse Merger and without any
action to be taken on the part of any Company Optionholder, each Company
Option that is outstanding at the Effective Time shall have its vesting fully
accelerated and shall be treated as follows:

(i)  _Cash-Out Options_. Coincident with (A) the Surviving Companys next
regularly scheduled payroll cycle after the Closing Date and through the
Surviving Companys payroll system, with respect to each Employee Option, the
Estimated Cash to Shares Consideration Ratio of each Company Option, rounded
down to the nearest full share, shall be automatically converted into the
right to receive (without interest) with respect to each share of Company
Common Stock subject to such portion of the Company Option, a cash payment
equal to the Cash Portion Per Company Option (as defined below), subject to
applicable withholding, and (B) the Closing and through the
Surviving Companys accounts payable system, with respect to each Non-
Employee Option, the Estimated Cash to Shares Consideration Ratio of each
Company Option, rounded down to the nearest full share, shall
be automatically converted into the right to receive (without interest) with
respect to each share of Company Common Stock subject to such portion of the
Company Option, a cash payment equal to the Cash Portion Per Company Option.

 

(ii) _Converted Options_. Each Company Option other than a Company Option
referred to in _clause (i)_ ( _i.e._ , the remainder after applying the
Estimated Cash to Shares Consideration Ratio to each Company Option as
contemplated in _clause (i)_ ) shall be assumed by Parent and converted into
an option to purchase shares of Parent Common Stock (each, a " _Converted
Option_ "). Each Converted Option shall continue to have and be subject to
substantially the same terms and conditions as were applicable to such Company
Option immediately before the Effective Time, except that (A) for the
avoidance of doubt, each Converted Option shall be fully vested and
exercisable at any time, (B) each Converted Option shall be exercisable for
that number of shares of Parent Common Stock equal to the product (rounded
down to the nearest whole number) of (1) the number of shares of Company
Stock subject to the Company Option immediately before the Effective Time and
(2) the Closing Exchange Ratio; and (C) the per share exercise price for each
share of Parent Common Stock issuable upon exercise

 



22

    

 of the Converted Option shall be equal to the quotient (rounded up to the
nearest whole cent) obtained by dividing (1) the exercise price per share of
Company Stock of such Company Option immediately before the Effective Time by
(2) the Closing Exchange Ratio; _provided, however,_ that the exercise price
and the number of shares of Parent Common Stock purchasable under each
Converted Option shall be determined in a manner consistent with the
requirements of Section 409A of the Code and the applicable regulations
promulgated thereunder; and _provided further, however,_ that the assumption
of any such Company Options that are incentive stock options under Section
422 of the Code will be effected in a manner that is intended to be consistent
with the applicable requirements of Section 424 of the Code and the applicable
regulations promulgated thereunder. In the event that the shares of Parent
Common Stock underlying the Converted Options are not registered on the Form
S-4 Registration Statement, then as soon as practicable after the Closing
Date, Parent shall prepare and file with the SEC a registration statement on
Form S-8 with respect to the Converted Options.

(iii) _Future Payments_. Each Company Option, whether subject to clause (i)
or clause (ii) above, shall be entitled to receive, (A) following each
Milestone Date, a number of shares of Parent Common Stock equal to the
applicable Per Share Milestone Consideration (such shares to be issued to the
Company Optionholder by a certificate or book entry), with the shares of
Parent Common Stock represented thereby subject to the Lock-Up Restriction
if applicable and (B) an amount of cash equal to up to the __quotient__ of
(x) the Expense Fund Amount, when and to the extent released to the Holders as
provided herein, __divided__ __by__ (y) the Fully Diluted Shares of Company
Stock; _provided, however,_ that, as to any Terminated Service Provider as of

(including pursuant to _Section_ __ _ 2.6(c)(iii)_,  _Section_ __ _ 2.7_
and _Section_ __ _ 2.8(c)_, as applicable), there shall exist a good faith
claim by Parent to exercise the Offset Right, all or a portion of such
Milestone Shares (with such shares valued in accordance with _Section_ __ _
8.3(a)_) as determined by Parent in its reasonable discretion (but subject to
the limitations set forth in _ARTICLE VIII_ ) to represent the Losses at issue

Agreement; _provided, that_ , for the avoidance of doubt, no Milestone Shares

its Approved Relatives or (v) without consideration, in connection with the
dissolution, liquidation or termination of any corporation, limited liability
company or other entity.

consistent with the Accounting Methodology.

 



26

after the Closing Date, Parent shall deliver book entries reflecting the
shares of Parent Common Stock to be allocated among the Holders pursuant to
_Section_ __ _ 2.6(c)(i)_ and  _Section_ __ _ 2.8(a)_ and in accordance
with the Allocation Schedule; _provided_ , _however_ , that, with respect to
any shares of Company Capital Stock for which a properly completed Letter of
Transmittal has not been received by the Exchange Agent, Parent shall be
entitled to withhold the book entries reflecting the shares of Parent Common
Stock issuable with respect to such shares of Company Capital Stock and to
issue such shares of Parent Common Stock promptly following such receipt by
the Exchange Agent.

2.14 _Non-_ _Conversion_ _._

 

(a) _Dissenting Shares_. Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the
contrary, any Dissenting Shares shall not be converted into or represent a
right to receive the applicable consideration for Company Capital Stock set
forth in _Section_ __ _ 2.6_, but instead the applicable Company Stockholder
shall only be entitled to such rights as are provided by the DGCL. In the
event that a Company Stockholder properly perfects such Company Stockholders
appraisal, dissenters or similar rights by demanding and not effectively
withdrawing or losing such Company Stockholders appraisal, dissenters or
similar rights for any shares of Company Capital Stock, the Exchange Agent
shall deliver to Parent such Company Stockholders portion of any cash
otherwise allocable to such Dissenting Shares at the time such rights
are perfected.

(b) _Withdrawal or Loss of Rights_. Notwithstanding the provisions of
_Section_ __ _ 2.14(a)_, if any Company Stockholder effectively withdraws or
loses (through failure to perfect or otherwise) such Company Stockholders
appraisal or dissenters rights with respect to any Dissenting Shares under
the DGCL, then, within ten (10) Business Days of the later of the Effective
Time and the occurrence of such event, (i) such Company Stockholders shares
shall automatically convert into and represent only the right to receive the
consideration for Company Capital Stock, as applicable, set forth in

completed and validly executed Letter of Transmittal and (ii) Parent (to the
extent the following amount has been previously delivered by the Exchange
Agent to Parent pursuant to _Section_ __ _ 2.14(a)_ and not returned to the
Exchange Agent) or the Exchange Agent shall deliver to such Company
Stockholder such Company Stockholders portion of the cash attributable to
such shares.

(c) _Demands for Appraisal_. The Company shall give Parent (i) prompt
notice of any written demand for appraisal received by the Company pursuant
to the applicable provisions of the DGCL and (ii) the opportunity to
participate in all negotiations and proceedings with respect to such demands.
The Company shall not, except with the prior written consent of Parent (not
to be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed), make any payment with

and Company Warrantholders as of immediately following the Closing pursuant to
_Section_ __ _ 2.6(c)(ii)_ and  _Section_ __ _ 2.8(b)_ and in accordance
with the Allocation Schedule, as well as the cash that may become

with the Exchange Agent, for the benefit of the Company Stockholders and
Company Warrantholders, the aggregate cash for distribution to the Holders as
of immediately following the Closing pursuant to _Section_ __ _ 2.6(c)(ii)_
and _Section_ __ _ 2.8(b)_. Parent also will deposit (or cause to be
deposited) with the Exchange Agent, for the benefit of the Holders, cash that
becomes distributable to the Holders as and when any portion of the Expense
Fund Amount is released pursuant to the terms of this Agreement. The Exchange
Agent will hold and distribute the cash payable to such Holders pursuant to
the provisions of an exchange agreement between Parent and the Exchange Agent
(the " _Exchange Agreement_ ").

(b)  _Letter of Transmittal_. No later than two (2) Business Days following
the Effective Time, Parent shall cause the Exchange Agent to send to each
Company Stockholder and Company Warrantholder of record a letter of
transmittal in a form mutually agreed upon by Parent and the Company (each, a
" _Letter of Transmittal_ "). Upon return of the Letter of Transmittal, duly
completed and validly executed in accordance with the instructions (and such
other customary documents as may reasonably be required by the Exchange
Agent), the record owner of such Company Capital Stock e-certificate or
Company Warrant, as applicable, shall be entitled to receive in exchange
therefor the consideration provided for herein and the Company Capital Stock
e-certificate or Company Warrant, as applicable, shall thereafter be canceled.
Parent shall cause the Exchange Agent to make payment to each such Company
Stockholder and Company Warrantholder promptly following receipt by the
Exchange Agent of such duly completed Letter of Transmittal. If payment of any
portion of the consideration provided for herein is to be made to any Person
other than the Person in whose name the Company Capital Stock e-certificate
or Company Warrant, as applicable, is registered, it shall be a condition of
payment that the Person requesting such payment shall have paid any transfer
and other Taxes required by reason of the payment of the applicable portion of
the consideration provided for herein to a Person other than the registered
holder of such Company Capital Stock e-certificate or Company Warrant, as
applicable, or shall have established to the reasonable satisfaction of Parent
that such Tax either has been paid or is not applicable. After the Effective
Time, each Company Capital Stock e-certificate or Company Warrant, as
applicable, shall represent only the right to receive the applicable portion
of the consideration provided for herein as contemplated by this  _ARTICLE
II_.

 



28

    

(c) _Transfer Books; No Further Ownership Rights in Company Capital Stock_.
The right to receive the applicable portion of the consideration provided for
herein, in accordance with the terms of this _ARTICLE II_ shall be deemed to
have been paid in full satisfaction of all rights pertaining to the shares of
Company Capital Stock previously represented by such Company Capital Stock
e-certificates or such Company Warrants, as applicable, and at the close of
business on the day on which the Effective Time occurs, the stock transfer
books of the Company shall be closed and thereafter there shall be no further
registration of transfers on the stock transfer books or warrant transfer
books, as applicable, of the Surviving Company of the shares of Company
Capital Stock or Company Warrants, as applicable, that were outstanding
immediately prior to the Effective Time. If, at any time after the Effective
Time, Company Capital Stock e-certificates or Company Warrants, as applicable,
are presented to Parent or the Surviving Company for any reason, they shall
be canceled and exchanged as provided in this _ARTICLE II_.

 

(d) _Termination of Exchange Fund_. At any time after six months following the
Effective Time, Parent shall be entitled to require the Exchange Agent to
deliver to it any amount distributed to the Exchange Agent in respect of such
payments that has not been disbursed to the holders of the Company Capital
Stock certificates or Company Warrants, as applicable, and thereafter
such holders may look only to Parent (subject to abandoned property, escheat
or other similar Laws) as general creditors thereof with respect to the
payment of any portion thereof that may be payable upon surrender of any
Company Capital Stock certificates or Company Warrants held by such holders.

2.16 _No_ _Liability_. Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to
the contrary, none of the Parties or the Exchange Agent shall be liable to
any Person for any portion of the payments contemplated by this _ARTICLE II_
delivered to a public official pursuant to any applicable abandoned property,
escheat or similar Law.

2.17 _Withholding_ _Taxes_. Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the
contrary, Parent, the Company, the Surviving Company and the Exchange Agent,
(each a " _Withholding Agent_ "), shall be entitled to deduct and withhold
from that portion of any payments contemplated by this _ARTICLE II_ or any
other amount payable to a Holder pursuant to this Agreement, and shall pay to
the appropriate Taxing Authority, such amounts that are required to be
deducted and withheld with respect to the making of such payments under any
Tax Law. To the extent amounts are so deducted and withheld and paid to the
appropriate Taxing Authority in accordance with applicable Law, such amounts
shall be treated for purposes of this Agreement as having been paid to the
Holder in respect of which such deduction and withholding were made. Without
limiting the foregoing, and in lieu of deducting from any payment, the
applicable Withholding Agent may require that any Holder make arrangements
satisfactory to such applicable Withholding Agent to satisfy any
withholding requirements as a condition to making any payment (including, for
example, in an instance where payment is to be made in shares of Parent Common
Stock); _provided_ , that any Holder may request that such applicable
Withholding Agent accept commercially reasonable arrangements (including sell
to cover arrangements) with respect to satisfying such withholding
requirements.

 

2.18 _Adjustments_. Notwithstanding any provision of this _ARTICLE II_ to the
contrary (but without in any way limiting the covenants in _Section_ __ _
5.1_ (Conduct of Business)), if between the Agreement Date and the Effective
Time the outstanding shares of any class or series of Company Capital Stock
are changed into a different number of shares or a different class or series
by reason of the occurrence or record date of any Stock Event, the per share
consideration payable hereunder (including pursuant to _Section_ __ _ 2.6_,
_Section_ __ _ 2.7_ or  _Section_ __ _ 2.8_) shall be appropriately
adjusted to reflect such Stock Event.

 



29

    

2.19 _Post-_ _Closing_ _Adjustment Amount_.

 

(a) _Preparation of Closing Statement_. Within one hundred twenty (120) days
following the Closing Date, Parent shall prepare and deliver to Holders
Representative a statement as of the Closing (the " _Final Calculation_ ")
setting forth its calculation of each of the following:

 

(i) the Closing Cash;

(ii) the Closing Net Working Capital;

(iii) the Company Transaction Expenses;

 

(iv) the Company Debt; and

 

(v) the resulting Final Upfront Cash Consideration.

 

The Final Calculation shall be accompanied by such supporting documentation
reasonably necessary to derive the numbers set forth therein. The
Final Calculation shall be final, conclusive and binding upon the Parties
unless Holders Representative delivers a written notice to Parent of any
objection to the Final Calculation (the " _Objection Notice_ ") within
thirty (30) days (the " _Objection Period_ ") after delivery of the Final
Calculation. Any Objection Notice must set forth in reasonable detail (x) any
item on the Final Calculation that Holders Representative believes has
not been prepared in accordance with this Agreement and the correct amount of
such item and (y) Holders Representatives alternative calculation of the
Closing Cash, the Closing Net Working Capital, the Company Transaction
Expenses or Company Debt, as the case may be. If Holders Representative
gives any such Objection Notice within the Objection Period, then Holders
Representative and Parent shall attempt in good faith to resolve any dispute
concerning the item(s) subject to such Objection Notice. If Holders
Representative and Parent do not resolve the issues raised in the Objection
Notice within thirty (30) days of the date of delivery of such notice (the "
_Initial Resolution Period_ "), such dispute shall be resolved in accordance
with the procedures set forth in _Section_ __ _ 2.19(b)_. Any item or amount
which has not been disputed in the Objection Notice shall be final, conclusive
and binding on the Parties on the expiration of the Initial Resolution Period
(for clarity, excluding any item or amount which is dependent on another item
or amount that has been disputed in the Objection Notice).

 

(b) _Resolution of Disputes_. If Parent and Holders Representative have not
been able to resolve a dispute within the Initial Resolution Period, either
Party may submit such dispute to and such dispute shall be resolved fully,
finally and exclusively through the use of an independent international
accounting firm selected to serve as such by mutual agreement of Parent
and Holders Representative (such accounting firm, the " _Reviewing Party_
"). The fees and expenses of the Reviewing Party incurred in the resolution of
such dispute shall be borne by the parties (in the case of the
Holders Representative, on behalf of the Holders) in such proportion as is
appropriate to reflect the relative benefits received by the Holders and
Parent from the resolution of the dispute. For example, if Holders
Representative challenges the calculation in the Final Calculation by an
amount of $100,000, but the Reviewing Party determines that Holders
Representative has a valid claim for only $40,000, Parent shall bear 40% of
the fees and expenses of the Reviewing Party and Holders Representative on
behalf of the Holders shall bear the other 60% of such fees and expenses. The
Reviewing Party shall determine (with written notice thereof to Holders
Representative and Parent) as promptly as practicable, but in any event
within thirty (30) days following the date on which Final Calculation and
written submissions detailing the disputed items are delivered to the
Reviewing Party (i) whether the Final Calculation was prepared in accordance
with the terms of this Agreement or, alternatively, (ii) only with respect to
the disputed items submitted to the Reviewing Party, whether and to what
extent (if any) the Final Calculation requires

 



30

    

 adjustment and a written explanation in reasonable detail of each such
required adjustment, including the basis therefor (it being understood that
any determination of a disputed item shall be not greater or less than the
amount of such disputed item as proposed by Parent in the Final Calculation or
as proposed by Holders Representative in the Objection Notice). Parent and
Holders Representative shall require the Reviewing Party to enter into a
confidentiality agreement on terms agreeable to Parent, Holders
Representative and the Reviewing Party. The procedures of this _Section_ __ _
2.19(b)_ are exclusive and the determination of the Reviewing Party shall be
final and binding on the Parties. The decision rendered pursuant to this
_Section_ __ _ 2.19(b)_ may be filed as a judgment in any court of competent
jurisdiction.

 

(c) _Post-Closing Purchase Price Adjustment_.

 

(i) The " _Post-Closing Adjustment_ " shall be an amount equal to the Final
Upfront Cash Consideration __less__ the Upfront Cash Consideration and, for
the avoidance of doubt, may be a positive or a negative number or zero.

(ii) If the Post-Closing Adjustment is a negative number greater than One
Million Dollars ($1,000,000) (an " _Eligible Post-Closing Adjustment_ "), then
the Post-Closing Adjustment shall represent a Loss that is subject to the
Offset Right.

 

(iii) If the Post-Closing Adjustment is a positive number, no adjustments or
payments shall occur.

 

2.20 _Effect of the Forward Merger on Capital Stock_. At the effective time of
the Forward Merger, by virtue of the Forward Merger and without any action to
be taken on the part of the holder of any shares of Company Capital Stock or
any units of membership interest in Merger Sub B, or on the part of the
Company, Parent, Merger Sub B or any other Person:

(a) each share of capital stock of the Company outstanding immediately prior
to the effective time of the Forward Merger shall be canceled and shall cease
to exist and no consideration shall be delivered in exchange therefor; and

(b) each unit of membership interest in Merger Sub B outstanding immediately
prior to the effective time of the Forward Merger shall remain unchanged and
continue to remain outstanding as a unit of membership interest in the
Surviving Company. At the effective time of the Forward Merger, Parent shall
continue as the sole, direct holder of membership interests in the Surviving
Company.

2.21 _Milestones_.

 

(a) _Milestone Determination_. Within five (5) Business Days following the
achievement of any Milestone, Parent shall deliver a notice (each, a "
_Milestone Notice_ ") to the Holders Representative regarding the achievement
of the applicable Milestone. Within ten (10) Business Days following Parents
delivery of a Milestone Notice (or, if applicable, within ten (10) Business
Days following determination of the achievement of a Milestone by the Expert
pursuant to _Section_ __ _ 2.21(d) below_), the Holders Representative shall
deliver to Parent a spreadsheet (each, a " _Milestone_ ___Spreadsheet_ ")
setting forth (i) a list of each Holder and the amount of Milestone Shares
payable to such Holder, after factoring in any deduction for any amount
subject to (A) the Offset Right (it being understood, for the avoidance of
doubt, no Milestone Shares may be withheld from payment in respect of the
Natera Litigation unless at the time the Milestone Shares would otherwise be
distributed or paid, either (x) the Natera Litigation has been fully and
finally resolved or (y) Parent and Holders Representative otherwise mutually
agree) and (B) the Banker Milestone Fee Share Equivalent, (ii) whether such
Holders right is contingent upon (and thus delayed until) the exercise of
the right of

 



31

    

 such Holder pursuant to _Section_ __ _ 2.7_, (iii) the Banker Milestone Fee
Cash Equivalent and (iv) any additional information as Parent may reasonably
request concurrent with the delivery of the applicable Milestone Notice.
Within three (3) Business Days after receipt of a Milestone Spreadsheet,
Parent shall deliver book entries reflecting the Milestone Shares to be
allocated among the Holders pursuant to  _Section_ __ _ 2.6(c)(i)_,
_Section_ __ _ 2.7_ and _Section_ __ _ 2.8(c)_ and in accordance with the
Milestone Spreadsheet and the other applicable terms and provisions of this
Agreement;  _provided_ , _however_ , that with respect to any shares of
Company Capital Stock or Company Warrants for which a properly completed

(d) _Dispute Resolution_. If Holders Representative believes that Parent has
breached any of its obligations under this  _Section_ __ _ 2.21_, then
Holders Representative may invoke the following dispute resolution process by
providing written notice thereof to Parent. Within fifteen (15) Business Days
of such notice, Parent and Holders Representative shall jointly select one
unaffiliated, independent expert who has appropriate technical, regulatory or
commercial expertise to resolve any such dispute to act as expert (the "

Parent shall provide the Selected Expert with all necessary background
information within twenty (20) Business Days after the Selected Expert is
selected, and the parties shall cooperate with all reasonable requests of the
Selected Expert for such documents or information as the Selected Expert may
require in support of the Selected Experts determination, and provide

determination reverses Parents position and Holders Representative (on
behalf of the Holders) shall reimburse Parent for its share of such fees if
the Selected Experts determination upholds Parents position. The hearing
shall be held within forty-five (45) Business Days of the Selected Expert
being selected, and the Selected Expert shall be requested to reach a
final determination within ten (10) Business Days after the hearing. All
proceedings conducted by the Selected Expert shall take place in Denver,

Experts determination shall be final and binding upon the parties and for
purposes of this Agreement. If the Selected Expert determines, or if Parent
agrees in writing, that Parent materially breached its obligation to use
commercially reasonable efforts to achieve any Milestone pursuant to
_Section_ __ _ 2.21(b)_ or to determine the PCM Revenue as set forth in the
Milestone Schedule, then the applicable Milestone shall be deemed to be
achieved by the Selected Expert, and Parent shall, pursuant  _Section_ __ _
2.21(a)_, deliver book entries reflecting the Milestone Shares corresponding
to such Milestone to be allocated among the Holders to the extent not already
issued.

 

(e) _Update Reports_. Commencing on January 1 of the first year following the

Holders Representative a report regarding the status of its (and its
Affiliates) efforts to achieve the Milestones and a statement setting forth,
in reasonable detail, a calculation of the PCM Revenue recognized during the
prior six months) (each such report, an " _Update Report_ "). If Holders
Representative requests a meeting with Parent to discuss any Update Report
within thirty (30) days after receipt thereof, Parent shall make available for
such a meeting such of its and its Affiliates respective employees with
appropriate expertise and knowledge of the activities undertaken to achieve
the Milestones, including an officer with operating responsibility for such
activities. In addition, for thirty (30) days after delivery of each Update
Report, Parent shall make available a qualified, designated employee of Parent
or its Affiliate with appropriate expertise to respond telephonically or
electronically to questions posed by Holders Representative. 

(f) _Information and Audit Rights_. Parent shall keep, and shall cause its
Affiliates to keep, reasonable documentation relating to the attainment of
each Milestone and complete, fair and true books of accounts and records for
the purposing of determining the PCM Revenue (the " _Milestone Information_
"). Such Milestone Information shall be maintained for a period of five (5)
years following the end of the calendar year to which it pertains. So long as
it is conducted in a manner which does not

 



33

    

 unduly interfere with Parents business, Holders Representative, or any
representative of Holders Representative reasonably acceptable to Parent,
shall have the right, no more frequently than once in any six (6) month
period, to review and audit the Milestone Information and to engage in
discussions with Parents employees with substantive knowledge of the
underlying matters regarding the status of each unachieved Milestone;
_provided_ , _however_ , that such right shall terminate as to each milestone
upon the fifth (5th) anniversary of the back-end date identified for
achievement of such Milestone per the Milestone Schedule. The cost of such
any audit shall be borne by Holders Representative, unless the audit
concludes that a Milestone was timely achieved and the applicable Milestone
Shares were not issued when due or that Parent otherwise breached any of its
obligations under this _Section_ __ _ 2.21_, in which case, Parent shall bear
the cost of such audit. All information contained in any Update Report, or
conveyed to the Holders Representative in any meeting or other communication
regarding an Update Report, or made available to Holders Representative
pursuant to any audit conducted during this _Section_ __ _ 2.21(f)_, shall be
subject to a reasonable and customary confidentiality agreement between
Parent and the Holders Representative. Such confidentiality agreement shall
expressly permit Holders Representative to disclose the confidential
information referred to in the foregoing sentence of Parent and its
Affiliates to Holders Representatives advisors, employees and consultants
providing direction to Holders Representative in his performance hereunder or
who otherwise have a need to know and, in any event, to Perceptive, so long
as such Persons are subject to the confidentiality agreement between Parent
and the Holders Representative or otherwise bound by comparable obligations
of confidentiality and nonuse as well as acknowledgement of
applicable federal securities laws pertaining to material nonpublic
information of Parent.

(g) _Cessation of Efforts_. If Parent (directly or indirectly) ceases
performance of activities required to achieve any Milestone, then Parent shall
send prompt written notice thereof to the Holders Representative together
with a reasonably detailed explanation for such cessation of activities.
Parents satisfaction of its obligations pursuant to the foregoing sentence
shall not relieve Parent of any of its obligations under this _Section_ __ _
2.21_.

 

(h) _Achievement of Milestone Prior to Closing_. In the event that any
Milestone is achieved after the date of this Agreement but prior to the
Closing, then the Company shall promptly, but no more than five (5) Business
Days after achievement of such Milestone, notify Parent that such Milestone
has been achieved and the applicable Milestone Shares shall be included in
the consideration payable by Parent at Closing in accordance with _Section_
__ _ 2.12_.

 

2.22 _Tax_ _Consequences_.

 

(a) Parent, the Merger Subs and the Company each intend that the Mergers,
taken together, constitute a "reorganization" within the meaning of Section
368(a) of the Code and the Treasury Regulations promulgated thereunder, in
accordance with IRS Revenue Ruling 2001-46, 2001-2 CB 321 (the " _Intended
Tax-Free Treatment_"). Each of Parent, the Merger Subs and the Company and
their respective Affiliates and Representatives (including Holders
Representative) shall (A) file all Tax Returns consistent with the Intended
Tax-Free Treatment (including attaching the statement described in Treasury
Regulations Section 1.368-3(a) on or with the U.S. federal income Tax Returns
of the Company and Parent for the taxable year that includes the Mergers), and
(B) except to the extent otherwise required by a "determination" as such term
is used in Section 1313 of the Code, take no Tax position inconsistent with
the Intended Tax-Free Treatment (whether in audits, Tax Returns or otherwise).

 

(b) This Agreement is intended to constitute, and the Parties hereby adopt
this Agreement as, a "plan of reorganization" within the meaning Treasury
Regulation Sections 1.368-2(g) and 1.368-3(a).

 



34

    

(c) Each of Parent, the Merger Subs and the Company and their respective
Affiliates and Representatives shall cooperate and use its respective
commercially reasonable efforts to cause the Mergers to qualify for the
Intended Tax-Free Treatment, and, except for the performance of this Agreement
in accordance with its terms, agree not to take any action or fail to take
any action, in either case, that could reasonably be expected to prevent or
impede the Mergers from qualifying for the Intended Tax-Free Treatment. Such
cooperation and commercially reasonable efforts shall include (but not be
limited to): (i) taking actions (and not failing to take actions) to cause the
Mergers to qualify for the Intended Tax-Free Treatment, and not taking
actions (or failing to take actions) that could reasonably be expected to
prevent or impede the Mergers from qualifying for the Intended Tax-Free
Treatment; (ii) a Party promptly notifying the other Party that such Party
knows or has reason to believe that the Mergers may not qualify for the
Intended Tax-Free Treatment (and whether the terms of this Agreement could be
reasonably amended in order to facilitate the Mergers qualifying for the
Intended Tax-Free Treatment); and (iii) in the event either Parent or the
Company seeks a tax opinion from its respective tax advisor regarding the
Intended Tax-Free Treatment, or the SEC requests or requires tax opinions in
connection with the Transactions, each Party shall execute and deliver
customary tax representation letters to the applicable tax advisor in form and
substance reasonably satisfactory to such advisor.

 

(d) Notwithstanding any provision herein to the contrary, (i) no Party or
their respective Affiliates shall have any liability to the other Party, or
any Holder, with respect to the tax treatment or the tax consequences of the
Mergers or the other Transactions (other than, for the avoidance of doubt, any
liability resulting from (A) any breach of, or misrepresentation
or inaccuracy in, any of the representations or warranties made by such Party
in this Agreement or any tax representation letters provided by such Party
pursuant to _Section_ __ _ 2.22(c)_ (if applicable) and (B) any breach of
or failure to perform any covenant or agreement of such Party provided for in
this Agreement including pursuant to _Section_ __ _ 2.22(c)_ (if applicable))
and (ii) each Holder shall be solely responsible with respect to the
tax treatment of the Mergers or the other Transactions as to such Holder as
well as the tax consequences thereof.

(e) If, at least ten (10) Business Days in advance of the Closing, the
Company reasonably believes that the Intended Tax-Free Treatment will not be
achieved as of the Closing, then, at the discretion of the Company,
the Parties shall promptly meet to agree upon a modification of the relative
aggregate mixture of cash consideration and Parent Common Stock consideration
that would otherwise be payable or issuable in connection with the Closing
(for clarity, such calculation shall not take into account any Milestone
Shares), and thereupon adjust such consideration as the Parties shall agree by
decreasing the amount of such cash consideration and making a corresponding
increase in the number of shares of Parent Common Stock representing such
consideration ( _i.e._ , such increase in shares shall be a number of shares,
rounded up to the nearest whole share, equal to the quotient of (i) the
required decrease in cash consideration divided by (ii) the Parent Trading
Price), but only to the extent the Company determines in good faith that such
adjustment is required to achieve the Intended Tax-Free Treatment. The Parties
agree to take all reasonable and necessary actions in furtherance of the
objective stated in this _Section_ __ _ 2.22(e)_, including, if applicable,
by making any necessary amendments to this Agreement and, as applicable,
seeking the requisite stockholder approvals.

the nature of the business conducted by it or the character or location of the
properties and assets owned, leased or licensed by it makes such licensing or
qualification necessary, except to the extent a failure to be so qualified in
any other jurisdiction has not been, and would not reasonably be expected to
be, individually or in the aggregate, materially adverse to the Company Group
taken as a whole.

 

(b) _Operations_. _Section_ __ _ 3.1(b)_ of the Disclosure Schedule lists

(c) _ERISA_. No Company Plan is subject to Title IV of ERISA or is otherwise
a Defined Benefit Plan as defined in Section 3(35) of ERISA (a " _Title IV
Plan_ ") and no member of the Company Group or any other trade or business
(whether or not incorporated) that, together with any member of the Company
Group, would be treated as a single employer under Section 414(b) or (c) of
the Code or, solely for purposes of Section 302 of ERISA and Section 412 of
the Code, is treated as a single employer under Section 414(m) or (o) of the
Code (each an " _ERISA Affiliate_ ") has incurred any liability pursuant to
Title IV of ERISA that remains unsatisfied. No member of the Company Group nor
any ERISA Affiliate has sponsored, contributed or had an obligation to
contribute, to any Title IV Plan, or any money purchase pension plan subject
to Section 412 of the Code, within the past six (6) years. No Company Plan is

(a " _Multiemployer Plan_ ") or a multiple employer welfare arrangement within
the meaning of Section 3(40) of ERISA. During the past six (6) years, no
member of the Company Group nor any of its respective ERISA Affiliates has
completely or partially withdrawn from any Multiemployer Plan and no
termination liability to the United States Pension Benefit Guaranty
Corporation or withdrawal liability to any Multiemployer Plan has been or

ERISA, respectively, has, to the Companys Knowledge, engaged in any
"prohibited transaction," as defined in Section 4975 of the Code or Section

Plan, nor, to the Companys Knowledge, have there been any fiduciary
violations under ERISA that could subject any member of the Company Group (or
any Employee) to any penalty or tax under Section 502(i) of ERISA or Section
4975 of the Code.

(d) _Status of Plans_. Each Company Plan intended to qualify under Section
401 of the Code or other tax-favored treatment under Subchapter B of Chapter 1
of Subtitle A of the Code has received a favorable determination letter
from the IRS or is the subject of a favorable prototype opinion letter from
the IRS as to its qualification under the Code and any trusts intended to be
exempt from federal income taxation under the Code are so exempt. To the
Knowledge of the Company, nothing has occurred with respect to the operation
of any Company Plans that could reasonably be expected to cause the loss of
such qualification or exemption. No event has occurred and no condition exists
with respect to any Company Plan subject to the requirements of Code Section

Lien, penalty or other liability imposed by ERISA, the Code or other
applicable Laws. For each Company Plan with respect to which a Form 5500 has
been filed, no

 



45

and maintained in all material respects in accordance with their terms and
with all applicable provisions of ERISA, the Code and other Laws. All
amendments and actions required to bring the Company Plans into conformity in
all material respects with all of the applicable provisions of the Code, ERISA
and other applicable Laws have been made or taken, except to the extent that
such amendments or actions are not required by Law to be made or taken until a
date after the Closing. There are no pending Actions arising from or relating
to the Company Plans (other than routine benefit claims), nor does the
Company have any Knowledge of facts that could form or could reasonably be
expected to form the basis for any such Action. There are no filings or
applications pending with respect to the Company Plans with the IRS, the DOL
or any other Governmental Authority. Each member of the Company Group has
satisfied obligations applicable to such member under Section 4980B of the
Code, Part 6 of Subtitle B of Title I of ERISA and each applicable state law

of the Company Group.

(i) _Effect of Transaction_. Except for the payment of the consideration
under _ARTICLE II_ , neither the execution and delivery by the Company of the

shall result in (i) any payment becoming due to any Employee, (ii) the
provision of any benefits or other rights to any Employee, (iii) the increase,
acceleration or provision of any payments, benefits or other rights to any
Employee, whether or not any such payment, right or benefit would
constitute a "parachute payment" within the meaning of Section 280G of the
Code, (iv) require any contributions or payments to fund any obligations under
any Company Plan, or (v) the forgiveness in whole or in part of any
outstanding loans made by any member of the Company Group to any Employee or

result of the execution and delivery of the Transaction Agreements or the
consummation of the Transactions is an "excess parachute payment" within the
meaning of Section 280G of the Code.

(j) _Compliance with Section_ __ _ 409A of the Code_. To the extent that any
Company Plan is a Nonqualified Deferred Compensation Plan, such Company Plan
is in documentary and operational compliance with, in all respects, Section
409A of the Code and all applicable guidance issued by the IRS thereunder (or

guidance). No payment pursuant to any Company Plan or other arrangement to any
"service provider" (as such term is defined in Section 409A of the Code and
the United States Treasury Regulations and IRS guidance thereunder) to a
member of the Company Group would subject any person to tax pursuant to
Section 409A(1) of the Code, whether pursuant to the Transactions or
otherwise. There is no Contract or arrangement to which any member of the
Company Group, or to the Knowledge of the Company, any Company Affiliate is a
party or by which it is bound to compensate any of its current or former

(l) _Plan Termination_. Each Company Plan can be amended, terminated or
otherwise discontinued in accordance with its terms, without Liability to any
member of the Company Group, Parent or any of their Affiliates (other than
ordinary administrative expenses typically incurred in a termination event).
No member of the Company Group nor any of its respective Affiliates has
announced its intention to modify or amend any Company Plan or adopt any
arrangement or program which, once established, would come within the meaning
of a Company Plan, and each asset held under any Company Plan may be
liquidated or terminated without the imposition of any redemption fee,
surrender charge or comparable Liability.

any Environmental Liability. No member of the Company Group has stored,
treated, disposed of, arranged for or permitted the disposal of, transported,
handled or released any substance (including any Hazardous Materials) or
owned, occupied or operated any Premises or property in a manner that has

is listed or proposed to be listed on the National Priorities List or on any
analogous state or local list. The Company has made available to Parent an
accurate list of environmental reports, audits assessments and investigations
in the Company Groups possession or control which relate to the Premises and
the real property in the Company Groups possession or control. To the

legal right and ability of any member of the Company Group (treating, for this
purpose, the Surviving Company as a member of the Company Group) to continue
using the Company Technology in the operation of the Business on or after the
Closing to the same extent as the Company Technology is used in the operation
of the Business prior to the Closing. The Transactions (including any transfer

(a) As promptly as practicable after the Agreement Date, Parent and the

promptly furnish all information concerning itself and its Affiliates as may
be reasonably requested by the other Party and shall otherwise reasonably
assist and cooperate with the other in connection with the preparation,
filing and distribution of the Form S-4 Registration Statement and the proxy
statement/prospectus to be filed with the SEC as part of the Form
S-4 Registration Statement and sent to (i) the Parent stockholders relating
to the Parent Stockholder Meeting and (ii) the Company Stockholders for
purposes of obtaining the Requisite Stockholder Approval (such proxy
statement/prospectus, together with any amendments or supplements thereto,
the " _Proxy Statement/Prospectus_ "). Parent shall file with the SEC, as
promptly as practicable after the Agreement Date, the Form S-4 Registration
Statement, which shall include the Proxy Statement/Prospectus, in connection
with the registration under the Securities Act of the shares of Parent Common
Stock to be issued in connection with the Reverse Merger and the other matters
to be considered by the Parent stockholders and the Company Stockholders.
Each of Parent and the Company will use their respective reasonable best
efforts to (i) cause the Form S-4 Registration Statement, when filed, to
comply with all legal requirements applicable thereto, (ii) respond as
promptly as reasonably practicable

 



61

    

 to and resolve all comments received from the SEC or its staff concerning
the Form S-4 Registration Statement, (iii) have the Form S-4 Registration
Statement declared effective under the Securities Act as promptly as
practicable after such filing and (iv) keep the Form S-4 Registration
Statement effective for so long as necessary to complete the Transactions. On
or after the Agreement Date but prior to the initial mailing of the Proxy
Statement/Prospectus to the Parent stockholders, Parent shall set a record
date (the " _Parent Record Date_ ") for determining the Parent stockholders
entitled to attend the Parent Stockholder Meeting. Parent will cause the Proxy
Statement/Prospectus to be mailed to each Parent stockholder as of the Parent
Record Date as promptly as practicable after the Form S-4 Registration
Statement is declared effective under the Securities Act.

 

(b) No filing of, or amendment or supplement to, the Form S-4 Registration
Statement, or response to SEC comments with respect thereto, will be made by
Parent without the prior written consent of the Company (which shall not be
unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed).

 

(c) Parent will promptly notify the Company upon the receipt of any comments
from the SEC or any request from the SEC for amendments or supplements to the
Form S-4 Registration Statement, and will, as promptly as practicable after
receipt thereof, provide the Company with copies of all correspondence between
it and its Representatives, on the one hand, and the SEC, on the other hand,
and all written comments with respect to the Form S-4 Registration Statement
or the Proxy Statement/Prospectus received from the SEC and advise the other
on any oral comments with respect to the Form S-4 Registration Statement
received from the SEC. Parent will advise the Company, promptly after Parent
receives notice thereof, of the time of effectiveness of the Form S-4
Registration Statement (the date on which such effectiveness shall occur, the
" _Effectiveness Date_ ") and the issuance of any stop order relating thereto
or the suspension of the qualification of the shares of Parent Common Stock
issuable in connection with the Transactions, and Parent and the Company will
use their respective reasonable best efforts to have any such stop order or
suspension lifted, reversed or otherwise terminated.

 

(d) Parent and the Company will also use their respective reasonable best
efforts to take any other action required to be taken under the Securities
Act, the Exchange Act, any applicable foreign or state securities or "blue
sky" Laws and the rules and regulations thereunder in connection with the
Transactions. Each of Parent and the Company shall ensure that none of
the information supplied by or on its behalf for inclusion or incorporation
by reference in (i) the Form S-4 Registration Statement will, at the time the
Form S-4 Registration Statement is filed with the SEC, at each time at which
it is amended and at the time it becomes effective under the Securities Act,
contain any untrue statement of a material fact or omit to state any material
fact required to be stated therein or necessary to make the statements
therein, in light of the circumstances under which they are made, not
misleading and (ii) the Proxy Statement/Prospectus will, at the date it is
first mailed or sent to Parents stockholders and the Company Stockholders
and at the time of the Parent Stockholder Meeting contain any untrue statement
of a material fact or omit to state any material fact required to be stated
therein or necessary in order to make the statements therein, in light of the
circumstances under which they are made, not misleading. If at any time prior
to the Closing any information relating to Parent, the Company or any of their
respective Affiliates, officers or directors, is discovered by Parent or
the Company which should be set forth in an amendment or supplement to the
Form S-4 Registration Statement, so that any of such documents would not
include a misstatement of a material fact or omit to state any material fact
necessary to make the statements therein, in light of the circumstances under
which they were made, not misleading, the Party that discovers such
information shall promptly notify the other Parties and each of Parent and the
Company shall use its reasonable best efforts to cause an appropriate
amendment or supplement describing such information to be promptly filed with
the SEC and, to the extent required by law, disseminated to Parents
stockholders.

 



62

    

5.4 _Parent Stockholder Approvals; Company Stockholder Approvals_.

 

(a) Parent shall, as promptly as practicable after the Form S-4 Registration
Statement is declared effective under the Securities Act, give notice of and
convene and hold a special meeting of Parents stockholders (the " _Parent
Stockholder Meeting_ ") in accordance with Parents Charter Documents for the
purposes of obtaining the following (the " _Parent Stockholder Approvals_ ")
which Parent shall, through its board of directors and subject to _Section_ __
_ 5.4(d)_ __ below, recommend to Parents stockholders: (i) approval of the
Mergers and the other Transactions; (ii) adoption and approval of this
Agreement and the other Transaction Agreements to which Parent or any of its
Subsidiaries is a party; (iii) adoption and approval of any other proposals
as the SEC (or staff members thereof) may indicate are necessary in its
comments to the Form S-4 Registration Statement or in correspondence related
thereto, and of any other proposals reasonably agreed by Parent and the
Company as necessary or appropriate in connection with the Transactions; (iv)
approval of the issuance of Parent Common Stock as contemplated by this
Agreement in connection with the Reverse Merger, including the Milestone
Shares; (v) approval for any financing activities relating to the Transaction
(including the Mergers); and (vi) the adjournment of the Parent Stockholder
Meeting, if necessary, in the circumstances set forth in  _Section_ __ _
5.4(b)_ below (the " _Parent Board Recommendation_ "). Parent shall use its
reasonable best efforts to obtain from its stockholders the Parent Stockholder
Approvals, including by actively soliciting proxies.

(b) The Parent Stockholder Meeting will initially be scheduled to be convened
within forty (40) days of the Effectiveness Date. Notwithstanding the
foregoing, the Company acknowledges that Parent may postpone or adjourn the
Parent Stockholder Meeting (i) to solicit additional proxies for the purpose
of obtaining the Parent Stockholder Approvals because at the scheduled time
of the Parent Stockholder Meeting there are not sufficient votes to approve
and adopt any of the Parent Stockholder Approvals, (ii) for the absence of a
quorum and (iii) to allow reasonable additional time for the filing
or mailing of any supplemental or amended disclosure that Parent has
determined after consultation with outside legal counsel is reasonably likely
to be required under applicable Law and for such supplemental or amended
disclosure to be disseminated and reviewed by Parents stockholders prior to
the Parent Stockholder Meeting; _provided, that_ , except as required by
applicable Law, the Parent Stockholder Meeting shall not be postponed,
recessed or adjourned to a date that is (A) more than thirty (30) days after
the date on which the Parent Stockholder Meeting was originally scheduled or
(B) less than five (5) Business Days prior to the Outside Date, in each case
without the prior written consent of the Company.

(c) Except as permitted by _Section_ __ _ 5.4(d)_ below, neither the Parent
Board nor any committee thereof shall (i) withhold or withdraw (or qualify or
modify in any manner adverse to the Company), or publicly propose to withhold
or withdraw (or qualify or modify in any manner adverse to the Company) the
Parent Board Recommendation, (ii) fail to include the Company Board
Recommendation in the Proxy Statement/Prospectus, or (iii) fail to publicly
reaffirm the Parent Board Recommendation within 10 days after receiving a
written request to do so from the Company (or, if sooner, prior to the then-
scheduled Parent Stockholders Meeting) (any action described in _Section_ __ _
5.4(c)_ being referred to as a " _Parent Adverse Recommendation Change_ ").

 

(d) Notwithstanding the foregoing, prior to obtaining the Parent Stockholder
Approval, the Parent Board (or any duly authorized committee thereof) may
effect a Parent Adverse Recommendation Change, but only in response to a
Parent Intervening Event and only if (i) the Parent Board (or any duly
authorized committee thereof) determines in good faith (after consultation
with its outside counsel and financial advisor) that the failure to take such
action would be inconsistent with the Parents directors fiduciary duties
under applicable Law; (ii) Parent has notified the Company in writing that it
intends to effect a Parent Adverse Recommendation Change due to the
occurrence of a Parent Intervening Event (which notice shall specify and
describe the Parent Intervening Event in reasonable

 



63

    

 detail and which notice shall not constitute a Parent Adverse Recommendation
Change); (iii) for a period of three (3) Business Days following the notice
delivered pursuant to clause (ii) of this _Section_ __ _ 5.4(d)_, Parent
shall have made Parent Representatives available to discuss and negotiate in
good faith (in each case to the extent Company desires to negotiate), with
Company Representatives any proposed modifications to the terms and
conditions of this Agreement so that the failure to take such action would no
longer be inconsistent with Parents directors fiduciary duties under
applicable Law (it being understood and agreed that any material change to
the facts and circumstances relating to the Parent Intervening Event shall
require a new notice and a new negotiation period (except that such new
negotiation period shall be for two (2) Business Days)); and (iv) no earlier
than the end of the negotiation period, the Parent Board (or any duly
authorized committee thereof) shall have determined in good faith (after
consultation with its outside counsel and financial advisor), after
considering the terms of any proposed amendment or modification to this
Agreement, that the failure to take such action would still be inconsistent
with the Parents directors fiduciary duties under applicable Law. In no
event shall the making of a Parent Adverse Recommendation Change affect in
any manner the obligation of Parent to convene the Parent Stockholder Meeting
and obtain a vote of the Parent stockholders on the matters to be considered
at such meeting.

 

(e) The Company shall, as promptly as practicable after the Form S-4
Registration Statement is declared effective under the Securities Act,
distribute to each Company Stockholder the Proxy Statement/Prospectus and a
written consent (in form and substance reasonably acceptable to Parent) in
accordance with applicable provisions of the DGCL and the Companys Charter
Documents for the purposes of obtaining the following (the " _Company
Stockholder Approvals_ ") which Company shall, through its board of directors,
recommend to the Company Stockholders: (i) approval of the Mergers and the
other Transactions; and (ii) adoption and approval of this Agreement and the
other Transaction Agreements to which the Company is a party (including
specific approval of the Holders Representative and the provisions of this
Agreement with respect thereto); _provided_ , _however_ , that such effort
shall in no way limit or adversely affect the receipt of the Requisite
Stockholder Approval represented by the Written Consent. In addition, the
Company shall take all actions that may be required or appropriate to
implement the provisions of Section 3 of that certain Amended and Restated
Voting Agreement dated December 11, 2019 among the Company and the
"Stockholders" identified therein (Drag-Along Right). With respect to any
payments and/or benefits that may constitute "parachute payments" under
Section 280G of the Code with respect to any Employees, the Company shall
submit such parachute payments to the Company Stockholders for approval, with
the understanding that the solicitation materials for such approval will not
be included as part of the Proxy Statement/Prospectus but instead be
distributed as a separate solicitation package to the Company Stockholders.

5.5 _Appropriate Action; Consents; Filings_.

 

(a) Subject to the terms and conditions of this Agreement, the Parties will
reasonably cooperate with each other and use (and will cause their respective
Subsidiaries to use) their respective reasonable best efforts to consummate
the transactions contemplated by this Agreement prior to the Outside Date and
to cause the conditions to the Mergers set forth in _ARTICLE VI_ to
be satisfied as promptly as reasonably practicable prior to the Outside Date,
including using reasonable best efforts to accomplish the following as
promptly as reasonably practicable prior to the Outside Date: (i) the

administrative, challenging this Agreement or that would otherwise prevent or
delay the consummation of the Transactions, including the Mergers, performed
or consummated by each party in accordance with the terms of this Agreement,
including seeking to have any stay, temporary restraining order or
injunction entered by any Governmental Authority vacated or reversed. The
Company shall use commercially reasonable efforts to obtain the consent,
approval or waiver with respect to Material Contracts in connection with the
consummation of the Transactions from third Persons to the extent reasonably
requested by Parent after consulting with the Company in good faith regarding
the request. Each of the Parties shall, in consultation and cooperation with
the other Parties and as promptly as reasonably practicable, but in any event
within ten (10) Business Days after the Agreement Date, make its respective
filings under the HSR Act, and make any other applications and filings as
reasonably determined by the Company and Parent under other applicable
Antitrust Laws with respect to the Transactions, as promptly as practicable,
but in no event later than as required by Law. Parent shall pay all filing
fees and other charges for the filings required under any Antitrust Law by the
Company or Parent with respect to the Transactions (the " _Regulatory Filing
Fees_ "). Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this
Agreement, without the prior written consent of Parent (which consent shall
not be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed), none of the Company or
any of its Subsidiaries or Affiliates will grant or offer to grant any
accommodation or concession (financial or otherwise), or make any payment, to
any Person (other than filing fees to any Governmental Authority) in
connection with seeking or obtaining its consent to any of the Transactions.

(b) In connection with and without limiting the efforts referenced in
_Section_ __ _ 5.5(a)_, each of the Parties will (i) furnish to the other
such necessary information and reasonable assistance as the other may request
in connection with the preparation of any governmental filings, submissions
or other documents; (ii) give the other reasonable prior notice of any such
filing, submission or other document and, to the extent reasonably
practicable, of any communication with or from any Governmental Authority
regarding the Transactions, and permit the other to review and discuss in
advance, and consider in good faith the views, and secure the participation,
of the other in connection with any such filing, submission, document or
communication; and (iii) cooperate in responding as promptly as reasonably
practicable to any investigation or other inquiry from a Governmental
Authority or in connection with any Action initiated by a Governmental
Authority or private party, including informing the other Parties as soon as
practicable of any such investigation, inquiry or Action, and consulting in
advance, to the extent practicable, before making any presentations or
submissions to a Governmental Authority, or, in connection with any Action
initiated by a private party, to any other Person. In addition, each of the
Parties will give reasonable prior notice to and consult with the other in
advance of any meeting, conference or substantive communication with any
Governmental Authority, or, in connection with any Action by a private party,
with any other Person, and to the extent not prohibited by applicable Law or
by the applicable Governmental Authority or other Person, and to the extent
reasonably practicable, not participate or attend any meeting or conference,
or engage in any substantive communication, with any Governmental Authority or
such other Person in respect of the Transactions without the other Party (as
between Parent and the Company), and in the event either Parent or the
Company is prohibited from, or unable to participate, attend or engage in, any
such meeting, conference or communication, keep such Party apprised with
respect thereto. Each Party shall furnish to the other Parties copies of all
filings, submissions, correspondence and communications between it and its
Affiliates and their respective Representatives, on the one hand, and any
Governmental Authority or members of any Governmental Authoritys staff (or
any other Person in connection with any Action initiated by a private party),
on the other hand, with respect to the Transactions. Each Party may, as it
deems advisable and necessary, reasonably designate material provided to the
other party as "Outside Counsel Only Material," and also

 



65

    

 may reasonably redact the material as necessary to (A) remove personally
sensitive information, (B) remove references concerning the valuation of the
Company and its Subsidiaries or Parent and its Subsidiaries conducted in
connection with the approval and adoption of this Agreement and the
negotiations and investigations leading thereto, (C) comply with contractual
arrangements, (D) prevent the loss of a legal privilege or (E) comply with
applicable Law.

(c) The Parties shall consult with each other with respect to obtaining all
permits and consents necessary to consummate the Transactions, including the
Mergers.

(d) Each of the Parties agrees that, during the Pre-Closing Period, it shall
not, and shall ensure that none of its Subsidiaries shall, consummate, enter
into any agreement providing for, or announce, any investment, acquisition,
divestiture, business combination or other transaction or take or omit to
take any action that would reasonably be expected to materially delay or
prevent the effectiveness of the Form S-4 or the consummation of the
Transactions.

 

(e) Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the contrary and for the
avoidance of doubt, the Holders Representative shall not have any
obligations under this _Section_ __ _ 5.5_.

5.6 _Public Announcements_. The initial press release with respect to the
execution of this Agreement shall be a joint press release to be agreed upon
by Parent and the Company. Following such initial press release, unless
otherwise required by (a) applicable Law, (b) stock exchange requirements,
or (c) any disclosure made in connection with the enforcement of any right or
remedy relating to this Agreement or the Transactions, no Party to this
Agreement shall at any time make any public announcement or disclosure in
respect of this Agreement or the Transactions or otherwise communicate with
any news media with respect to this Agreement or the Transactions without the
prior written consent of the other Parties (which consent shall not be
unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed); _provided, that_ , Parent
shall be permitted to (i) respond to questions or provide a summary or update
relating to, or discuss the benefits of, the Transactions in calls or meetings
with Parents analysts, investors or attendees of any industry conference
and, (ii) with advance notice to the Company, make any public announcement or
statement and issue any press release that provides a summary or update
relating to the Transactions.

 

5.7 _Access to Information_. Subject to the requirements of applicable Law
(including any COVID-19 Measures), from time to time during the Pre-Closing
Period, each of the Company and Parent shall, and shall cause other members of
the Company Group and Parent Group to, afford to the other and its
Representatives reasonable access during normal business hours upon reasonable
advance notice to (a) such Partys premises, books, reports, Contracts,
assets, filings with and applications to Governmental Authorities, records
and correspondence (in each case, whether in physical or electronic form) and
(b) to the Representatives of such Party as the other Party may reasonably
request and such Party shall furnish promptly to the other Party all
information and documents concerning such Partys business, financial
condition and operations, properties and personnel related to the consummation
of the Transactions or the ownership or operation of Parents business as the
other Party may reasonably request and the other Party shall be allowed to
make copies of such information and documents, ____provided,__ __ _ that_,
the Company, Parent and their respective Representatives shall conduct any
such activities in such a manner as not to interfere unreasonably with the
business or operations of the other Party; _ _ provided__ _,_ __ _ _
further__, that (i) the Company and Parent (or their respective Subsidiaries)
shall not be obligated to provide such access or information if the Company or
Parent, as applicable, determines, in its reasonable judgment, that doing so
would violate applicable Law or a Contract with a third party or obligation
of confidentiality owing to a third party, jeopardize the protection of the
attorney-client privilege or expose such party to risk of liability for
disclosure of sensitive or personal information ( _ _provided,__ __ _ that_,
the withholding party shall use its reasonable best efforts to allow for
providing such access or information (or as much of it as possible) in a
manner that does not violate applicable Law or a Contract or obligation of
confidentiality, jeopardize the

 



66

    

 protection of the attorney-client privilege or expose such party to risk of
liability for disclosure of sensitive or personal information, including by
(A) using its reasonable best efforts to obtain the required consent of any
third party to provide such access or information or (B) entering into a
customary joint defense or common interest agreement) and (ii) in each case,
such access may be limited to the extent the Company or Parent reasonably
determines, in light of COVID-19 or COVID-19 Measures, that such access would
jeopardize the health and safety of any employee of the Company or Parent, as
applicable, or its Subsidiaries. The Parties acknowledge that the information
exchanged pursuant to this _ Section 5.7_ will be subject to the terms of the
Mutual Nondisclosure Agreement, dated as of March 1, 2020, between Parent and
the Company (as it may be amended from time to time) (the " _Existing NDA_ ").

5.8  _Notification of Certain Matters_. Each of Parent and the Company shall
provide prompt written notice to the other upon becoming aware (a) that any
representation or warranty made by it in this Agreement was inaccurate when
made or subsequently has become inaccurate and that would make the timely
satisfaction of the conditions in _Section_ __ _ 6.1(a)_ or _Section_ __ _
6.2(a)_, as applicable, impossible or unlikely, (b) of any failure by it to
comply with or satisfy any of its covenants or agreements hereunder and that
would make the timely satisfaction of the condition in _Section_ __ _ 6.1(b)_
or _Section_ __ _ 6.2(b)_ impossible or unlikely, (c) of the occurrence or
nonoccurrence of any event that would reasonably be expected to cause any
condition precedent to any obligation of the other to consummate the
Transactions (including the Mergers) not to be satisfied at or prior to
the Closing Date, (d) of any notice or other communication from any Person
alleging that the consent of such Person is or may be required in connection
with the Transactions (including the Mergers), to the extent such consent is
not already contemplated by this Agreement or the Disclosure Schedule, (e) of
any notice or other communication from any Governmental Authority in
connection with the Transactions (including the Mergers), or (f) of the
commencement or written threat of commencement of any Action regarding the
Transactions (including the Mergers) or otherwise relating to the Company
Group or the Business; _provided_ , _however_ , that neither the delivery of
any notice pursuant to this  _Section_ __ _ 5.8_ nor obtaining any
information or knowledge in any investigation pursuant to _Section_ __ _ 5.7_
or otherwise shall (i) cure any breach of, or non-compliance with, any
representation or warranty requiring disclosure of such matter, or any breach
of any other provision of this Agreement, (ii) amend or supplement the
Disclosure Schedule or (iii) limit the remedies available to the Party
receiving, or entitled to receive, such notice.

5.9 _Tax Matters_.

 

(a) Parent shall timely file or cause to be timely filed (taking into account
all extensions properly obtained) all Tax Returns of the Company Group that
are first due (taking into account all extensions properly obtained) after the
Closing Date and that relate in whole or in part to a Pre-Closing Tax Period
(each, a " _Parent Prepared Return_ "), and Parent shall timely remit or
cause to be timely remitted any Taxes due in respect of such Parent Prepared
Returns. To the extent any Parent Prepared Return relates in whole or part to
a Pre-Closing Tax Period, each such Parent Prepared Return shall (i) be
prepared in a manner consistent with the past practice of the Company Group
(ii) include all Transaction Deductions on the income Tax Return of the
Company for the taxable period that includes the Closing Date to the extent
permitted by applicable Law, and (iii) be prepared in a manner consistent with
the Intended Tax-Free Treatment, unless otherwise required by applicable Law.
In the event that any item reflected on any Parent Prepared Return could
increase the amount of Taxes included in Closing Net Working Capital or
Company Transaction Expenses or result in an Offset Right for such Taxes by
the Parent Indemnified Persons under _Section_ __ _ 8.2_, Parent will submit
such Parent Prepared Return to the Holders Representative for review and
comment at least thirty 30 days prior to the due date for filing such Parent
Prepared Return (or, if such due date is within 60 days following the Closing
Date, as promptly as practicable following the Closing Date), and will not
file any such Parent Prepared Return without the consent of the Holders
Representative, which consent will not be unreasonably withheld, conditioned
or delayed.

 



67

    

(b) For all purposes of this Agreement, in the case of any Straddle Period,
the amount of Taxes of the Company Group that are allocable to the portion of
a Straddle Period ending on and including the Closing Date shall be determined
by assuming that the Straddle Period consisted of two taxable years or
periods, one of which ended at the close of the Closing Date and the other of
which began at the beginning of the day following the Closing Date, and (i)
Taxes based on, or computed with respect to, net income or earnings, gross
income or earnings, payroll, capital or net worth, or any other Taxes
resulting from or imposed on, sales, receipts, uses, transfers or assignments
of property or other assets, payments or accruals to other Persons (including
wages) or any other similar transaction or transactions of any member of the
Company Group for the Straddle Period shall be allocated between such two
taxable years or periods on a "closing of the books basis" by assuming that
the books of the Company or such Subsidiary were closed at the close of the
Closing Date and (ii) in the case of all other Taxes, such Taxes shall be
equal to the product of the amount of such Taxes for the entire Straddle
Period multiplied by a fraction, the numerator of which is the number of
calendar days in the Straddle Period before and including the Closing Date
and the denominator of which is the total number of calendar days in the
entire Straddle Period.

 

(c) Without the prior written consent of the Holders Representative (such
consent not to be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed), Parent will
not: (i) except for Tax Returns that are filed in accordance with _Section_ __
_ 5.9(a)_, file or amend, or permit the Company, the Surviving Company or any
of their Affiliates to file or amend any Tax Return of the Company Group
relating to a taxable period (or portion thereof) ending on or prior to the
Closing Date; (ii) with respect to Tax Returns filed pursuant to _Section_ __
_ 5.9(a)_, after the date such Tax Returns are filed pursuant to _Section_
__ _ 5.9(a)_, amend or permit the Company, the Surviving Company or any of
their Affiliates to amend any such Tax Return; (iii) extend or waive, or cause
to be extended or waived, or permit the Company, the Surviving Company or any
of their Affiliates to extend or waive, any statute of limitations or other
period for the assessment of any Tax or deficiency related to a taxable period
(or portion thereof) of any member of the Company Group ending on or prior to
the Closing Date; (iv) make or change any election or change any method of
accounting with respect to Taxes with retroactive effect to a taxable period
(or portion thereof) ending on or prior to the Closing Date for any member of
the Company Group; (v) initiate discussions or examinations with any Taxing
Authority (including any voluntary disclosures) regarding Pre-Closing Taxes or
(vi) except as explicitly contemplated by this Agreement, engage in any
transaction on the Closing Date after the Closing outside the Ordinary Course
of Business and consistent with the Companys past practice; _provided_ that
the restrictions in clauses (i) through (vi) of this sentence will apply only
to the extent that such action would have the effect of increasing the amount
of Taxes included in Closing Net Working Capital or Company Transaction
Expenses or resulting in an Offset Right for such Taxes by the Parent
Indemnified Persons under _Section_ __ _ 8.2_.

(d) Parent will give prompt written notice to the Holders Representative of
the assertion of any claim, or the commencement of any Action, with respect
to: (x) any Tax Return of any member of the Company Group that relates solely
to one or more taxable periods ending on or prior to the Closing Date; or (y)
any Tax liability of any member of the Company Group for which the Holders are
partially or wholly responsible under this Agreement (each, a " _Tax Claim_
").

 

(i) With respect to any Tax Claim that relates solely to taxable periods that
end on or before the Closing Date, the Holders Representative may, at the
Holders expense, upon written notice to Parent, assume the defense of any
such Tax Claim; _provided_ that in order to assume such defense, the Holders
Representative: (A) must provide such written notice within 10 Business Days
after Parent gives notice of the assertion of the Tax Claim; (B) will keep
Parent reasonably informed concerning the progress of such Tax Claim,
including providing copies of all correspondence and other documents relevant
to such Tax Claim; (C) will consult with Parent upon Parents reasonable
request for such consultation from time to time with respect to such Tax
Claim; and (D) will not, without Parents 

 



68

    

 prior written consent (which consent will not be unreasonably withheld,
conditioned or delayed), agree to any settlement with respect to any Tax if
such settlement could adversely affect any Tax liability of Parent or any
Affiliate of Parent in any Tax period ending after the Closing Date. If the
Holders Representative assumes such defense, Parent will have the right (but
not the duty) to participate in the defense thereof and to employ counsel
(which will include participation in meetings with Taxing Authorities and
review and comment on written submissions to Taxing Authorities), at its own
expense, separate from the counsel employed by the Holders Representative
(on behalf of the Holders). The right of the Holders Representative to
assume any such defense pursuant to this _Section_ __ _ 5.9(d)(i)_ shall
terminate at the time that there are not any remaining Milestone Shares
subject to the Offset Right.

(ii) With respect to any Tax Claim that the Holders Representative does not
or cannot elect to control pursuant to _Section_ __ _ 5.9(d)(i)_, Parent
will control such Tax Claim; _provided_ that Parent: (A) will keep the
Holders Representative reasonably informed concerning the progress of such
Tax Claim, including providing copies of all correspondence and other
documents relevant to such Tax Claim; (B) will consult with the Holders
Representative upon the Holders Representatives reasonable request for such
consultation from time to time with respect to such Tax Claim; and (C) with
respect to any Tax that could increase the amount of Taxes included in Closing
Net Working Capital or result in an Offset Right for such Taxes by the Parent
Indemnified Persons under  _Section_ __ _ 8.2(a)(vii)_ will not, without the
Holders Representatives prior written consent (which consent will not be
unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed), agree to any settlement and
(2) will provide the Holders Representative with the right (but not the
duty) to participate in the defense of any such Tax Claim (which will include
participation in meetings with Taxing Authorities and review and comment on
written submissions to Taxing Authorities) and to employ counsel, at the
Holders expense, separate from the counsel employed by Parent.

(iii) In the event of any conflict between the provisions of this _Section_
__ _ 5.9(d)_, and the provisions of _Section_ __ _ 8.3(i)_, the provisions
of this _Section_ __ _ 5.9_, shall control.

 

(e) Any transfer, stamp, documentary, sales, use, registration, value-added
and other similar Taxes (including all applicable real estate transfer Taxes
and real property transfer Taxes and including any filing and recording fees,
but not, for the avoidance of doubt, any capital gain Taxes) incurred in
connection with this Agreement and the Transactions (" _Transfer Taxes_ ")
will be borne by Parent. Parent and the Holders Representative shall
cooperate with each other in the provision of any information or preparation
of any documentation that may be necessary or useful for obtaining any
available mitigation, reduction or exemption from any Transfer Taxes.

(f) For all applicable Tax purposes, the Parties agree to, and no party
shall take any action or filing position inconsistent with, the following Tax
treatment of the items specified below:

(i) The Expense Fund Amount shall be treated as having been received and
voluntarily set aside by the Holders on the Closing Date, and no Tax
withholding or reporting shall be required in connection with the distribution
of any portion of the Expense Fund to the Holders.

(ii) Any payments made in respect of Company Options pursuant to this
Agreement (A) shall be treated as compensation paid by the Company as and
when received by the holder thereof to whom such payment is due (which, for
the avoidance of doubt, shall be the Closing Date with respect to the Expense
Fund Amount), (B) shall be net of any Taxes withheld pursuant to  _Section_
__ _ 2.17_, and (C) shall, in respect of payments attributable to Employee
Options only, be made through the Surviving Companys (or any Affiliate
thereof or successor thereto) standard payroll procedures in accordance with
_Section_ __ _ 2.7_ ( _provided_ , _however_ , that payments of the release
of the Expense Fund Amount in respect of Company Options shall be made
directly by the Surviving Company (or any Affiliate thereof or successor
thereto) and not through its payroll). Any applicable withholding Taxes in
respect of the portion of the Expense Fund Amount borne by the Holders in
respect of Company Options shall be withheld from their Cash Portion Per
Company Option.

5.10 _Employee Matters and Company Plans_.

 

(a) _C_ _ontinuing Employees_. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary set
forth in this Agreement, nothing in this Agreement shall be deemed to give
rise to any obligation by Parent to retain any Current Employee, any group of
Current Employees of the Company Group or any Company Plan following the
Closing Date. Current Employees of the Company Group who continue in
employment immediately following the Effective Time (the " _Continuing
Employees_ ") who become eligible to participate in any welfare benefit plan
or pension plan (intended to qualify under Section 401(a) of the Code) of
Parent (each a " _Parent Plan_ ") shall receive credit for purposes of
eligibility and vesting for years of service with the Company Group prior to
the Closing to the extent that such service was recognized under the
corresponding Company Plan prior to the Closing; provided that such service
shall not be recognized if and to the extent that it would result in the
duplication of benefits or is not possible or practical under a Parent Plan.
For clarity, service credit shall not be given for benefit accrual, early
retirement subsidies or entitlement purposes under any Parent Plan and shall
not be given for any purpose under any Parent plans or programs other than
welfare benefit plans or pension plans, including any equity plans,
but excluding any personal time off plans, severance plans and vacation
programs.

(b) To the extent permitted by the applicable Parent Plans, Parent shall
cause (i) to be waived all pre-existing condition exclusions and actively-at-
work requirements and similar limitations, eligibility waiting periods and
evidence of insurability requirements under any Parent Plans to the extent
waived or satisfied by a Continuing Employee (or covered dependent thereof)
under any Company Plan as of the Closing and (ii) any deductible, co-
insurance and covered out-of-pocket expenses paid on or before the Closing by
any Continuing Employee (or covered dependent thereof) to be taken into
account for purposes of satisfying the corresponding deductible, coinsurance
and maximum out-of-pocket provisions after the Closing under any applicable
Parent Plan in the same plan year in which the Closing occurs.

(c) _Company Plans_. The Company Group shall cease contributions to and
terminate all of the Company Plans effective immediately prior to Closing (one
day prior to Closing in the case of any Company Plan intended to qualify under
Section 401(a) of the Code). Any such cessation or termination shall be
undertaken (i) in accordance with the governing documents and Contracts for
the Company Plans (including through plan amendment) and (ii) in conformance
with applicable Laws.

 

(d) _No Limitation_. This _Section_ __ _ 5.10_ is not intended to amend any
benefit plans or arrangements of Parent or any of its Subsidiaries, to limit
the ability of Parent or any of its Subsidiaries to amend, modify or terminate
any of such benefit plans or arrangements or to confer third-party beneficiary
rights on any Person (including any Current Employee or any beneficiary or
dependent thereof).

 



70

    

5.11 _No Negotiations, Etc_ _._

 

(a) Except as provided in _Section_ __ _ 5.11(a)_, during the Pre-Closing
Period, the Company shall not, shall cause each other member of the Company
Group and its Representatives not to, and shall advise the Holders and their
respective Representatives (other than the Holders Representative) not to,
directly or indirectly solicit, initiate or enter into any discussions,
negotiations or commitments or continue in any way any discussions or
negotiations with any Person or group of Persons regarding any Competing
Transaction. The Company shall promptly but not later than forty-eight (48)
hours following the occurrence of the relevant event notify Parent orally and
in writing if any inquiries, proposals or requests for information concerning
a Competing Transaction are received by any member of the Company Group, the
Holders or any of their respective Representatives (other than the Holders
Representative). The written notice shall include a summary of the material
terms and conditions of such inquiry proposal or request. For the avoidance
of doubt, the provisions of this _Section_ __ _ 5.11(a)_ shall not prohibit
the Company from securing financing in accordance with Schedule 5.1.

 

(b) Notwithstanding the foregoing, at any time prior to obtaining the
Requisite Stockholder Approval in respect of this Agreement and the Mergers
(including pursuant to the Written Consent), if the Company receives a written
Company Competing Transaction Proposal from a third party and the receipt of
such Company Competing Transaction Proposal was not initiated, sought,
solicited, knowingly encouraged or knowingly induced or knowingly facilitated
in violation of _ Section_ __ _ 5.11_, then the Company may (i) contact the
Person who has made such Company Competing Transaction Proposal and
its Representatives in order to clarify the terms of such Company Competing
Transaction Proposal so that the Companys Board of Directors (or any duly
authorized committee thereof) may inform itself about such Company Competing
Transaction Proposal, (ii) furnish information concerning its business,
properties or assets to the Person who has made such Company Competing
Transaction Proposal and its Representatives pursuant to an Acceptable
Confidentiality Agreement ( _ _provided__ _,_ __ _ that_, all such
information has previously been furnished to Parent or is furnished to Parent
prior to or substantially concurrently with the time it is furnished to such
Person) and (iii) negotiate and participate in discussions and negotiations
with the Person who has made such Company Competing Transaction Proposal and
its Representatives concerning such Company Competing Transaction Proposal,
if, in the case of each of _ clauses (ii)_ and _ (iii)_, the Company Board
(or any duly authorized committee thereof) determines in good faith (after
consultation with its outside counsel and financial advisor) that such Company
Competing Transaction Proposal constitutes or would reasonably be expected to
lead to a Company Superior Proposal.

(c) For purposes of this Agreement,

 

(i) " _Competing Transaction_ " means a transaction or a series of related
transactions (other than the Transactions) providing for any (A) merger,
consolidation, share exchange, business combination, recapitalization or
similar transaction involving the Company or any of its Subsidiaries, pursuant
to which any such Person (or the stockholders of such Person) or group would
own or control, directly or indirectly, fifty percent (50%) or more of the
voting power of the Company, (B) sale, lease, license, dissolution or other
disposition, directly or indirectly, of assets of the Company (including the
equity interests of any of its Subsidiaries) or any Subsidiary of the Company
representing fifty percent (50%) or more of the consolidated assets or
revenues of the Company Group, taken as a whole, as of or for the fiscal year
ending, as appropriate, December 31, 2019, or to which fifty percent (50%) or
more of the Companys revenues or assets on a consolidated basis are
attributable, taken as a whole, as of or for the fiscal year ending, as
appropriate, December 31, 2019, (C) issuance or sale or other disposition of
Company capital stock representing fifty percent (50%) or more of the voting
power of the Company, (D) tender offer, exchange offer or any other
transaction or series of transactions in which any Person (or the
stockholders of such Person) or group will acquire, directly or indirectly,
beneficial ownership or the right to acquire beneficial ownership of Company
capital stock representing fifty percent (50%) or more of the voting power
of the Company or (E) any combination of the foregoing.

 



71

    

(ii) " _Company Competing Transaction Proposal_ " means any _ bona fide_
written proposal or offer from any Person (other than Parent) providing for or
contemplating a Competing Transaction which the Companys Board of Directors
believes in good faith (after consultation with its outside counsel
and financial advisor) could represent a Company Superior Proposal.

(iii) " _Company Superior Proposal_ " shall mean any _ bona fide_ written
Company Competing Transaction Proposal which the Company Board determines in
good faith (after consultation with its outside counsel and financial advisor)
to be (i) more favorable to the Companys stockholders from a financial point
of view than the Transactions and (ii) reasonably likely to be completed on
the terms proposed, in the case of each of _ clauses (i)_ and _ (ii)_,
taking into account at the time of determination all relevant circumstances,
including the various legal, financial and regulatory aspects of the proposal,
all the terms and conditions of such proposal and this Agreement and any
changes to the terms of this Agreement offered by Parent in response to such
Company Competing Transaction Proposal.

5.12 _Officers and Directors Insurance and Indemnification_. Prior to the
Closing Date, the Company shall obtain a prepaid extended reporting period or
tail policy insuring the current and former officers or directors of the
Company (the " _D andO Indemnified __Persons_ ") under the current program of
directors and officers liability insurance maintained by the Company which
shall be effective commencing with the Closing Date and ending six (6) years
thereafter and which shall afford coverage for actual or alleged acts or
omissions occurring at, during or prior to the Closing Date including with
respect to the Transactions (including the Mergers) (the " _D andO Tail
Insurance_"). The Company and Parent shall each bear fifty percent (50%) of
the cost of such insurance coverage and the Companys share of such cost, to
the extent not paid prior to the Closing, shall be included in the
determination of the Company Transaction Expenses. Parent will cause the
Surviving Company to use commercially reasonable efforts to enforce the DandO
Tail Insurance upon request of the DandO Indemnified Persons and will not allow
the Surviving Company to cancel the DandO Tail Insurance during its term. In
addition, for a period of six (6) years following the Closing Date, Parent
and the Surviving Company agree to indemnify and hold harmless, reimburse,
exculpate from liability, and advance expenses to all DandO Indemnified Persons
to the same extent and on the same terms as such persons are entitled to
indemnification, reimbursement, exculpation or expense advancement by the
Company as of the Agreement Date, whether pursuant to applicable documents
(including Charter Documents), individual indemnification agreements, by Law
or otherwise, for acts or omissions or matters which occurred or arose at or
prior to the Closing (regardless of whether any proceeding relating to any DandO
Indemnified Persons rights to indemnification, exculpation, or expense
advancement with respect to any such matters, acts, or omissions is commenced
before or after the Closing). Any claims for indemnification made under this
_Section_ __ _ 5.12_ on or prior to the sixth (6th) anniversary of the
Closing Date shall survive until the final resolution thereof. The provisions
of this _Section_ __ _ 5.12_ shall be enforceable by each DandO Indemnified
Person and the Surviving Company shall, and Parent shall cause the Surviving
Company or its successors to, pay all costs and expenses (including reasonable
attorneys fees) incurred by any DandO Indemnified Person (or his or her heirs,
personal representatives, successors or assigns) in any legal action brought
by such Person that is successful to enforce the obligations of Parent or the
Surviving Company or its successors under this _Section_ __ _ 5.12_. The
obligations of Parent and the Surviving Company and its successors under this
_Section_ __ _ 5.12_ shall not be terminated, amended or otherwise modified
in such a manner as to adversely affect any DandO Indemnified Person (or his or
her heirs, personal representatives, successors or assigns) without the prior
written consent of such DandO Indemnified Person (or his or her heirs, personal
representatives, successors or assigns, as applicable).

 



72

    

5.13 _Natera Litigation_. Following the Closing, the Surviving Company
directly and Parent indirectly shall control the Natera Litigation;
_provided_ , _however_ , that subject to Holders Representative executing a
non-disclosure and non-use agreement in form and substance reasonably
satisfactory to Parent, which non-disclosure and non-use agreement shall
not prohibit the Holders Representative from communicating any such
information with the Holders who have a need to know such information,
_provided, that_ , any such recipients are subject to confidentiality
obligations with respect thereto, (a) Parent shall keep Holders
Representative advised of material developments with respect to the Natera
Litigation, (b) Holders Representative may provide Parent with comments and
suggestions regarding the Natera Litigation, which Parent will consider (and
Parent will cause the Surviving Company to consider) in good faith, and (c)
the Natera Litigation will not be settled without the consent of Holders
Representative, which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld, conditioned
or delayed; and _provided_ , _further_ , that if at any time the Offset Right
is no longer available with respect to any Losses that may arise or result
from the Natera Litigation, then the foregoing proviso of this  _Section_ __
_ 5.13_ ( _i.e._ , including clauses (a), (b)  and (c)) shall no longer
apply.

5.14 _Section 16 Matters_. Prior to the Effective Time, Parent shall take,
and shall cause Parents Board of Directors or an appropriate committee
thereof composed solely of two or more "non-employee directors" (as defined in
Rule 16b-3 under the Exchange Act) to take, all such steps as may be required
or as may be requested by the Company to cause acquisitions of Parent Common
Stock (including derivative securities with respect to Parent Common Stock)
resulting from the Reverse Merger by each director or officer of the Company
as well as each other Holder who will become subject to the reporting
requirements of Section 16(a) of the Exchange Act (including those
Persons who may be deemed to be "directors by deputization") with respect to
Parent as a result of the Reverse Merger, to be exempt under Rule 16b-3
promulgated under the Exchange Act.

 

5.15 _Listing_. Parent shall promptly prepare and submit to the New York Stock
Exchange (the "NYSE") a supplemental listing application covering the shares
of Parent Common Stock issuable in the Merger, and shall use reasonable best
efforts to obtain, prior to the Effective Time, approval for the listing of
such Parent Common Stock, subject to official notice of issuance, and the
Company shall cooperate with Parent with respect to such listing.

5.16 _Parent Action_. Parent shall take all actions necessary to (a) cause
Merger Sub A, Merger Sub B and the Surviving Company to perform promptly their
respective obligations under this Agreement and, (b) as and when applicable,
cause Merger Sub A and Merger Sub B to consummate the Mergers and the other
Transactions on the terms and conditions set forth in this Agreement. Promptly
following the execution and delivery of this Agreement, Parent shall adopt
this Agreement as the sole stockholder, as applicable, of Merger Sub A and
Merger Sub B and shall promptly provide evidence of such adoption to the
Company upon request.

5.17 _A_ _dditions to Parent Board_. In addition to the appointment of Jason
Myers, the Chief Executive Officer of the Company, to Parents Board of
Directors with effect upon the Closing as contemplated by _Section_ __ _
6.2(h)_, Parents Board of Directors will engage in confidential interviews
and discussions with a second member of the Companys Board of Directors as
reasonably determined by Parents Board of Directors. Assuming the
satisfaction of Parents Board of Directors with such interviews and
discussions, but subject to the discretion of Parents Board of Directors to
act in the best interests of Parents stockholders, Parents Board of
Directors shall consider the appointment of such second individual to
Parents Board of Directors, although the effect of any such appointment would
be no earlier than the Closing. Any such appointment (including as to class of
Director for purposes of Parents classified Board of Directors) would occur
in compliance with Parents Charter Documents as implemented by the
determinations of Parents Board of Directors.

5.18 _Registration Statement_. If requested in writing by any Consenting
Stockholder(s) with respect to Parent Common Stock that is not registered
pursuant to the Form S-4 Registration Statement and may not be resold under
Rule 144 without regard to any volume or manner of sale restrictions, as soon
as practicable following, but in any event in accordance with the timeline
required by applicable Legal Requirements: (a) with respect to Parent Common
Stock issued in connection with the Closing of the Transactions, the Closing
Date ( _provided, that_ , if on such date Parent is then in a Deferral Period
or Parents insider trading policy would prohibit executive officers of the
Company from trading in Parent Common Stock, such reference date will be
extended until Parent is no longer in such Deferral Period or Parents
insider trading policy no longer prohibits executive officers of the Company
from trading in Parent Common Stock) and (b) with respect to Parent Common
Stock issued in connection with the achievement of a Milestone, the related
Milestone Date ( _provided, that_ , if on such date Parent is then in a
Deferral Period or Parents insider trading policy would prohibit executive
officers of the Company from trading in Parent Common Stock, such reference
date will be extended until Parent is no longer in such Deferral Period or
Parents insider trading policy no longer prohibits executive officers of the
Company from trading in Parent Common Stock), Parent will file with the SEC a
registration statement on Form S-3 ASR (or if Form S-3 ASR is not available
for such purpose, then on Form S-3, or if Form S-3 is not available, another
appropriate form) registering the resale of the Parent Common Stock issued to
the requesting Consenting Stockholders on the Closing Date or the applicable
Milestone Date, as the case may be (each, a " _Resale Registration Statement_
"), and Parent will use its commercially reasonable efforts to have the Resale
Registration Statement declared effective as soon as practicable after the
filing thereof. Parents obligations to include any shares of Parent Common
Stock held by any Stockholder in the Resale Registration Statement are
contingent on such Consenting Stockholder furnishing in writing to Parent such
information regarding such Consenting Stockholder, the securities of Parent
held by such Consenting Stockholder and the intended method of disposition of
such Parent Common Stock, as will be reasonably requested by Parent to effect
the registration of such Parent Common Stock, and such Consenting Stockholder
will execute such documents, including any questionnaires, certificates, and
instruments, in connection with such registration as Parent may reasonably
request that are customary of a selling stockholder in similar situations
(the " _Seller Documents_ "). Parent shall take all necessary steps to cause
the Seller Documents to be delivered to the Consenting Stockholder as soon as
practicable after the Form S-4 Registration Statement is declared effective
under the Securities Act in order to permit their completion by the Consenting
Stockholders and return to Parent prior to the anticipated filing date for
the related Resale Registration Statement. At all times from and after the
date on which any Resale Registration Statement is first filed with the SEC
(except for any period during which Parent restricts offers and sales or other
dispositions of shares of Parent Common Stock issued hereunder under the
Resale Registration Statement pursuant to the immediately succeeding
sentence), such Resale Registration Statement will comply as to form in all
material respects with the requirements of applicable Legal Requirements and
will not contain an untrue statement of a material fact or omit to state any
material fact necessary in order to make the statements made therein not
misleading in the light of the circumstances under which they were made;  _
_provided,__ _that_ , Parent shall not be responsible for any statements or
omissions made in reliance on and in conformity with information relating to
any Consenting Stockholder furnished in writing to Parent by any
Consenting Stockholder specifically for inclusion in the Resale Registration
Statement, any prospectus or any amendment or supplement thereto.
Notwithstanding the foregoing, Parent may suspend the use of any such Resale
Registration Statement if it determines in its reasonable good faith judgment
that a Deferral Period shall exist following the Resale Registration Statement
being declared effective by the SEC. Parent shall maintain the effectiveness
of each Resale Registration Statement filed hereunder until the earlier of
(i) such time as all shares of Parent Common Stock registered under such
Resale Registration Statement may be resold under Rule 144 without regard to
any volume or manner of sale restrictions or (ii) all such shares of Parent
Common Stock shall have been previously sold. For purposes hereof, a "
_Deferral Period_ " shall refer to a period during which Parent determines in
its reasonable good faith judgment (after consultation with its legal
advisors) that the offer and sale or other disposition of Parent Common Stock
pursuant to a Resale

 



74

    

 Registration Statement would require public disclosure by Parent of material
nonpublic information that Parent is not otherwise obligated to disclose and
that the immediate disclosure of such information would be materially
detrimental to Parent; __provided,__ _that_ , if Parent delays the filing of
any Resale Registration Statement or suspends its use pursuant to this
sentence, (A) Parent shall not register any securities for sale by Parent or
for resale by any other securityholders during such delay or suspension period
other than pursuant to a registration solely for the sale of securities to or
by employees of Parent or a Subsidiary of Parent pursuant to equity incentive
plans, (B) Parent may not suspend offers and sales or other dispositions of
Parent Common Stock pursuant to this sentence for more than 30 consecutive
days in any one instance or 60 days in the aggregate during any 12
month period and (B) Parent shall work in good faith and take reasonable
steps to limit to the extent practicable the duration of any such delay or
suspension period. In all cases, Parent shall file or permit resales under, as
the case may be, such Resale Registration Statement as soon as reasonably
practicable following the lapsing or expiration of the circumstances that led
Parent to delay such filing or suspend its use. Parent shall provide
reasonable written notice of the existence of any Deferral Period to each
Consenting Stockholder whose Parent Common Stock is being registered under any
Resale Registration Statement.

of Parent and the Company (such date, as it may be so extended from time to
time, the " _Outside Date_ "); _provided_ , _however_ , that the right to
terminate this Agreement under this _Section_ __ _ 7.1(b)_ shall not be

has the effect of enjoining, restraining, preventing, prohibiting or making

to a party if a material breach by such party of its obligations under this

78

    

(d) By Parent, if any of the representations or warranties of the Company set
forth in  _ARTICLE III_ shall not be accurate or if the Company has failed to
perform any covenant or agreement on the part of the Company set forth in this
Agreement (including an obligation to consummate the Closing) such that the
conditions to Closing set forth in either _Section_ __ _ 6.1(a)_ or
_Section_ __ _ 6.1(b)_ would not be satisfied and the breach or breaches
causing such representations or warranties not to be accurate, or the failures
to perform any covenant or agreement, as applicable, are not cured on or
prior to the earlier of (i) thirty (30) days after written notice thereof is
delivered to the Company and (ii) the Outside Date; _provided_ that this
provision shall not be available to Parent if Parent is then in material
breach of this Agreement;

(e) By the Company, if any of the representations or warranties of Parent set
forth in _ARTICLE IV_ shall not be true and correct or if Parent, Merger Sub A
or Merger Sub B has failed to perform any covenant or agreement on the part of
Parent, Merger Sub A or Merger Sub B, as applicable, set forth in this
Agreement (including an obligation to consummate the Closing) such that the
conditions to Closing set forth in either _Section_ __ _ 6.2(a)_ or _Section_
__ _ 6.2(b)_ would not be satisfied and the breach or breaches causing such
representations or warranties not to be accurate, or the failures to perform
any covenant or agreement, as applicable, are not cured on or prior to the

(h) By the Company, upon written notice to the Parent, if the Parent board of
directors shall have made a Parent Adverse Recommendation Change.

7.2 _Effect of Termination_.

 

(a) In the event this Agreement is terminated pursuant to _Section_ __ _
7.1_, this Agreement shall become null and void (other than the provisions of
this _ARTICLE VII_ , _Section_ __ _ 8.4(e)_ (Indemnification; Holders
Representative Losses), _Section_ __ _ 9.13_ (Governing Law) and _Section_ __
_ 9.14_ (Dispute Resolution) and any provision hereof that forms the basis
for a claim of willful breach of this Agreement prior to the termination of
this Agreement, and if applicable _Section_ __ _ 7.2(c)_, all of which shall
survive termination of this Agreement and remain in full force and effect),
without further liability on the part of the Parties or any of their
respective directors, officers or Affiliates other than with respect to any
circumstances giving rise to the termination of this Agreement as result of a
Partys willful breach of any provision of this Agreement prior to the
termination of this Agreement.

 

(b) If (i) either Parent or the Company terminates this Agreement pursuant to
_Section_ __ _ 7.1(f) _or (ii) the Company terminates this Agreement
pursuant to _Section_ __ _ 7.1(h)_, then Parent will pay or cause to be paid
to the Company an amount in cash equal to $30,000,000 (the " _Creditable
Amount_ "). The Creditable Amount shall be paid by wire transfer of
immediately available funds to a U.S. bank account designated to Parent by the
Company, which payments shall be made, in cases of qualifying terminations by
Parent, concurrently with and as a condition to the effectiveness of such
termination, and in cases of qualifying terminations by the Company, within
three (3) Business Days following such termination.

 



79

    

(c) Each Party acknowledges that the agreements contained in this _ Section_
__ _ 7.2_ are an integral part of the Transactions and that the Creditable
Amount is not a penalty, but rather is a reasonable upfront payment toward a
mutually beneficial agreement between Parent and the Company the receipt of
which, to the extent representing a payment in advance (which such payment
will be amortized over a time period mutually acceptable to Parent and the
Company) of when amounts would otherwise be payable, is intended
to compensate the Company in the circumstances in which the Creditable Amount
is payable for the efforts and resources expended and opportunities foregone
while negotiating this Agreement and in reliance on this Agreement and on the
expectation of the consummation of the Transactions, which amount would
otherwise be impossible to calculate with precision. Accordingly, if Parent
fails to pay the Creditable Amount and, in order to obtain such payment, the
Company commences a suit that results in a judgment against Parent for the
Creditable Amount, Parent shall pay interest on the Creditable Amount from the
date payment of the Creditable Amount was due to the date of actual payment at
the rate equal to the prime rate published in the  _Wall Street Journal_ for
the relevant period, together with the costs and expenses of the Company
(including reasonable legal fees and expenses) in connection with such suit.
In the event that the Creditable Amount is paid by Parent, then Parent may
request that Parent and the Company promptly commence negotiations in good
faith for a period not to exceed three months with the goal of establishing a
collaboration, partnership, research and development, commercial or similar
agreement of mutual benefit, with the terms thereof to be acceptable to each
of Parent and the Company in its respective reasonable discretion, in which
event the Creditable Amount shall be applied toward payments otherwise
required from Parent under such agreement. Subject to the obligations in the
preceding sentence, Parent and the Company confirm that there shall be no
obligation on the part of either Parent or the Company to enter any such
agreement .

(iii) any appraisal rights exercised by a Holder to the extent not covered by
amounts returned to Parent with respect to such Holders Dissenting Shares
pursuant to _Section_ __ _ 2.14_, and any other Action brought by a Holder or

on adequacy of the consideration received by such Holder (or all Holders) or
claims that any director or officer of the Company breached any fiduciary
duty owed to the Company or any of the Holders in connection with the
negotiation, approval, execution or performance of this Agreement or any of
the Transactions (including the Mergers);

remedy of the Parent Indemnified Parties with respect to the subject matter of
this Agreement.

 

8.3 _Mechanics of Offset Right_ _._

 

(a) _Reduction of Milestone Shares_. At the time the Stated Damages are
finally determined pursuant to the provisions of this  _Section_ __ _ 8.3_,
the aggregate number of then remaining (i.e., unissued or unearned) Milestone
Shares shall be reduced in an amount equal to the quotient (rounded down to
the nearest whole share) of the final determined amount of Stated Damages
divided by the average closing price for shares of Parent Common Stock on the
New York Stock Exchange (or any other exchange which is then the primary
exchange upon which shares of Parent Common Stock are traded) for the
twenty (20) trading day period immediately preceding the date of the
applicable Offset Certificate (the " _Reduction Shares_ "). Any Reduction
Shares shall be taken (or the distribution stayed as contemplated by 
_Section_ __ _ 8.3(b)_, as applicable) from the first available Milestone to
be achieved after delivery of the applicable Offset Certificate (and, if
needed, from each next successive Milestone to thereafter be achieved until
the Reduction Shares have been fully applied).

(b) _Exercise of Offset Right_. To exercise the Offset Right, Parent shall (on
behalf of Parent or any other Parent Indemnified Persons at issue) deliver to
Holders Representative at the notice address set forth in _Section_ __ _
9.2_ (as the same may be amended from time to time as provided therein and
including all Persons to be copied on any notice to Holders Representative),
a certificate signed by Parent (an " _Offset Certificate_ "): (a) stating in
good faith that one or more of the Parent Indemnified Persons has suffered
or incurred Losses which are entitled to be recovered pursuant to the Offset
Right (the " _Stated Damages_ "); and (b) specifying to the extent practicable
in reasonable detail the individual items of Stated Damages and the nature
of the breach or other circumstance to which each such item is related. Upon
the timely delivery of an Offset Certificate stating a bona fide claim for
Stated Damages, and notwithstanding any provision herein to the contrary, any
distribution of Milestone Shares shall be stayed to the extent of Milestone
Shares reflecting such Stated Damages (as calculated pursuant to _Section_ __
_ 8.3(a)_) as provided in _Section_ __ _ 2.10_.

 



81

    

(c) _Perfection of Offset Right_. After the expiration of a period of
ten (10) Business Days following the time of delivery of an Offset
Certificate to Holders Representative, the Offset Right shall be deemed
perfected as to the applicable Stated Damages and the Milestone Shares shall
be reduced pursuant to  _Section_ __ _ 8.3(a)_ unless, prior to the
expiration of such period of ten (10) Business Days, Holders Representative
objects in a written statement delivered to Parent to the claims made in the
Offset Certificate, setting forth in reasonable detail the objections to the
claim for Stated Damages.

(d) _Objection to Offset Right_. If Holders Representative shall timely
object in writing to an exercise of the Offset Right by Parent, Holders
Representative and Parent shall attempt in good faith to agree upon the rights
of the respective parties with respect to each of such claims within twenty
(20) Business Days after such objection. If Holders Representative and Parent
should so agree on a claim, a memorandum setting forth such agreement shall be
prepared and signed by such parties, which shall include, if applicable, a
statement of the reduction in Milestone Shares pursuant to _Section_ __ _
8.3(a)_.

(e) _Resolution of Offset Right_. If no agreement can be reached after good
faith negotiation between Holders Representative and Parent pursuant to
_Section_ __ _ 8.3(d)_, then either Parent or Holders Representative may
pursue dispute resolution with respect thereto pursuant to _Section_ __ _
9.15_.

(f) _Unaffected by Investigation_. The Offset Right shall not be affected by
any investigation conducted with respect to, or any knowledge acquired or
capable of being acquired, at any time, whether before or after the execution
and delivery of this Agreement or the Closing, with respect to the accuracy
of or compliance with any of the representations, warranties, covenants or
agreements set forth in this Agreement. The waiver of any condition based on
the accuracy of any representation or warranty, or on the performance of or
compliance with any covenant or agreement, shall not affect the Offset Right
(including with respect to any such representation, warranty, covenant or
agreement).

 

(g) _Surviving Company_. The Parties acknowledge and agree that if the
Surviving Company suffers, sustains or becomes subject to or incurs any Loss,
then (without limiting any of the rights of the Surviving Company as an
Indemnified Person), Parent shall also be deemed, by virtue of its ownership
of the equity of the Surviving Company, to suffer, sustain or become subject
to or incur such Loss.

(h) _Specific Element of Consideration_. The Offset Right is, without
limitation, (i) a specific element of the consideration that induced Parent
to enter into this Agreement and to perform its obligations as contemplated
hereby and (ii) intended to be fully enforceable on the terms provided in this
_ARTICLE VIII_.

 

(i) _Defense of Third Party Claims_. In the event of a Third Party Claim for
which Parent is entitled to indemnification hereunder, such Third Party Claim
will not be settled without the consent of Holders Representative, which
consent shall not be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed; provided,
however, that this Section 8.3(i) shall not apply to any Natera Litigation
(which is subject to _Section_ __ _ 5.13_).

8.4 _Holders_ __ _Representative_ _._  

(a) _Appointment_. By virtue of approving the Merger, each Holder shall be
deemed to have irrevocably nominated, constituted and appointed Holders
Representative as his, her or its attorney in fact and exclusive
representative and agent with full power of substitution, to act in the name,
place and stead of the Holders for all purposes in connection with this
Agreement and the any agreement ancillary hereto including for purposes of
executing any documents and taking any actions that Holders Representative
may, in his sole discretion, determine to be necessary, desirable or
appropriate in connection with any exercise of the Offset Right. Kyle Lefkoff
hereby accepts his appointment as Holders Representative.

 



82

    

(b) _Authority_. The Holders grant to Holders Representative full authority
to: (i) execute, deliver, acknowledge, certify and file on behalf of each
such Holder (in the name of any or all of the Holders or otherwise) any and
all documents that Holders Representative may, in his sole discretion,
determine to be necessary, desirable or appropriate, in such forms and
containing such provisions as Holders Representative may, in his sole
discretion, determine to be appropriate, in performing its duties as
contemplated by this  _Section_ __ _ 8.4_ and (ii) do or refrain from doing
any further act or deed on behalf of the Holders which the Holders
Representative deems necessary or appropriate in his sole discretion relating
to the subject matter of this Agreement. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the
Holders Representative shall have no obligation to act on behalf of the
Holders, except as expressly provided herein, and for purposes of clarity,
there are no obligations of the Holders Representative in any ancillary
agreement, schedule, exhibit or the Disclosure Schedule. Notwithstanding
anything in any Transaction Agreement to the contrary: (a) each Parent
Indemnified Person shall be entitled to deal exclusively with Holders
Representative on all matters relating to any exercise of the Offset Right;
and (b) Parent, each Parent Indemnified Person, the Exchange Agent, and each
Holder shall be entitled to rely conclusively (without further evidence of
any kind whatsoever) on any document executed or purported to be executed on
behalf of any Holder by Holders Representative and on any other action taken
or purported to be taken on behalf of any Holder by Holders Representative
as fully binding upon such Holder. A decision, act, consent or instruction of
Holders Representative, including an amendment, extension or waiver of this
Agreement (or any provision hereof) pursuant to  _Section_ __ _ 9.4_ or
_Section_ __ _ 9.5_ shall constitute a decision of the Holders and shall be
final, binding and conclusive upon the Holders and such Holders successors as
if expressly confirmed and ratified in writing by such Holder, and all
defenses which may be available to any Holder to contest, negate or disaffirm
the action of the Holders Representative taken in good faith under this
Agreement are waived. The Exchange Agent, Parent, Merger Sub and the
Surviving Company may rely upon any such decision, act, consent or instruction
of Holders Representative as being the decision, act, consent or instruction
of the Holders. The Exchange Agent, Parent, Merger Sub and the Surviving
Company are hereby relieved from any liability to any Person for any acts done
by them in accordance with such decision, act, consent or instruction of
Holders Representative.

 

(c) _Power of Attorney_. The powers, immunities and rights to indemnification
granted to the Holders Representative hereunder: (a) are coupled with an
interest and are irrevocable; (b) may be delegated by Holders Representative;
(c) shall survive the death, incompetence, bankruptcy, dissolution or
incapacity, as applicable, of each of the Holders and shall be binding on any
successor thereto; and (d) shall survive the delivery of an assignment by any
Holder of the whole or any fraction of his, her or its interest in any
Milestone Shares or the Expense Fund Amount.

 

(d) _Replacement_. If Holders Representative resigns or is otherwise unable
to fulfill its responsibilities hereunder, the Holders shall (by consent of
those Persons entitled, or who were entitled, to at least a majority of the
Milestone Shares), within ten (10) days after such resignation or inability,
appoint a successor to Holders Representative reasonably satisfactory to
Parent. Any such successor shall succeed Holders Representative as Holders
Representative hereunder. If for any reason there is no Holders
Representative at any time, all references herein to Holders Representative
shall be deemed to refer to those Persons entitled, or who were entitled, to
at least a majority of the Milestone Shares. The immunities and rights to
indemnification shall survive the resignation or removal of the
Holders Representative and the Closing and/or any termination of this
Agreement.

 



83

    

(e) _Indemnification; Holders_ __ _Representative Losses_. The Holders
Representative shall not be liable to the Holders for any action taken or
omitted to be taken by such person in connection with such persons services
pursuant to this Agreement or any agreements ancillary hereto, except in
the case of liability directly caused by such persons willful misconduct or
gross negligence. The Holders will, severally in accordance with their
respective pro rata portion (calculated based on ownership of Fully Diluted
Shares of Company Stock), indemnify, defend and hold harmless the Holders
Representative from and against any and all losses, liabilities, damages,
claims, penalties, fines, forfeitures, actions, fees, costs and expenses
(including the fees and expenses of counsel and experts and their staffs and
all expense of document location, duplication and shipment) (collectively, "
_Holders  Representative Losses_") arising out of or in connection with the
Holders Representatives execution and performance of this Agreement and any
agreements ancillary hereto, in each case as such Holders Representative Loss
is suffered or incurred; provided, that in the event that any such Holders
Representative Loss is finally adjudicated to have been directly caused by
the gross negligence or willful misconduct of the Holders Representative, the
Holders Representative will reimburse the Holders the amount of such
indemnified Holders Representative Loss to the extent attributable to such
gross negligence or willful misconduct. If not paid directly to the Holders
Representative by the Holders, any such Holders Representative Losses may be
recovered by the Holders Representative from (i) the Expense Fund and (ii)
any other funds that become payable to the Holders under this Agreement at
such time as such amounts would otherwise be distributable to the Holders;
provided, that while this section allows the Holders Representative to be
paid from the aforementioned sources of funds, this does not relieve the
Holders from their obligation to promptly pay such Holders Representative
Losses as they are suffered or incurred, nor does it prevent the Holders
Representative from seeking any remedies available to it at law or otherwise.
Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the contrary, any restrictions
or limitations on liability or indemnification obligations of, or
provisions limiting the recourse against non-parties otherwise applicable to,
the Holders set forth elsewhere in this Agreement are not intended to be
applicable to the indemnities provided to the Holders Representative under
this section.

(f) _No Expenditures; Reliance on Allocation Schedule_. The Holders
acknowledge that the Holders Representative shall not be required to expend
or risk his own funds or otherwise incur any financial liability in the
exercise or performance of any of his powers, rights, duties or privileges or
pursuant to this Agreement or the transactions contemplated hereby.
Furthermore, the Holders Representative shall not be required to take any
action unless the Holders Representative has been provided with funds,
security or indemnities which, in its determination, are sufficient to
protect the Holders Representative against the costs, expenses and
liabilities which may be incurred by the Holders Representative in performing
such actions. The Holders Representative shall be entitled to: (i) rely upon
the Allocation Schedule, (ii) rely upon any signature believed by it to be
genuine, and (iii) reasonably assume that a signatory has proper authorization
to sign on behalf of the applicable Holder or other party.

 

(g) _E_ _xpense Fund_. Upon the Closing, Parent shall wire to the Holders
Representative the Expense Fund Amount. The Expense Fund Amount shall be held
by the Holders Representative in a segregated client account and shall be
used (i) for the purposes of paying directly or reimbursing the Holders
Representative for any Holders Representative Losses incurred pursuant to
this Agreement, or (ii) as otherwise determined by the Holders Representative
(the " _Expense Fund_ "). The Holders Representative is not providing any
investment supervision, recommendations or advice and shall have no
responsibility or liability for any loss of principal of the Expense Fund
other than as a result of his gross negligence or willful misconduct. The
Holders Representative will hold these funds separate from his corporate
funds, will not use these funds for any corporate purposes and will not
voluntarily make these funds available to his creditors in the event of
bankruptcy. The Holders Representative is not acting as a withholding agent
or in any similar capacity in connection with the Expense Fund, and has no tax
reporting or income distribution obligations. The Holders will not receive any
interest or earnings on the Expense Fund and irrevocably transfer and assign
to the Holders Representative any such interest or earnings. The Holders
Representative may contribute funds to the Expense Fund from any consideration
otherwise distributable to the Holders. As soon as reasonably determined by
the Holders Representative that the Expense Fund is no longer required to be
withheld, the Holders Representative shall distribute the remaining Expense
Fund (if any) to the Exchange Agent and/or Parent, as applicable, for
further distribution to the Holders.

9.3 _Assignment and Succession_. Neither this Agreement nor any of the
rights, interests or obligations hereunder may be assigned or delegated by
any Party without the written consent of the other Parties, except that
Parent, Merger Sub A or Merger Sub B may, without the prior consent of any
other Party, collaterally assign this Agreement to any lender; _provided_
that no such assignment shall relieve the assigning Party of any of its
obligations hereunder. Any assignment of this Agreement or any of the rights,
interests or obligations hereunder not permitted under this _Section_ __ _
9.3_ shall be null and void _ab initio_. Subject to the foregoing terms of
this _Section_ __ _ 9.3_, this Agreement shall be binding upon, inure to the
benefit of and be enforceable by the Parties and their respective successors
and permitted assigns.

9.4 _Amendment or Supplement_. Subject to the requirements of applicable Law,
this Agreement may be amended at any time by execution of an instrument in
writing identifying itself as an amendment signed, when amended prior to the
Closing, by Parent, Merger Sub A, Merger Sub B and the Company and, when
amended on or after the Closing, by Parent and Holders Representative.

9.5 _Waivers_. No waiver of any provision of this Agreement shall be valid
and binding unless it is in writing and signed by the Party against whom the
waiver is to be effective. No failure on the part of any Party in exercising
any right, privilege or remedy hereunder and no delay on the part of any
Party in executing any right, privilege or remedy under this Agreement, shall
operate as a waiver thereof, nor shall any single or partial exercise of any
such right preclude any other or further exercise thereof or the exercise of
any other right hereunder. No notice to or demand on a Party made hereunder
shall operate as a waiver of any right of the Party giving such notice or
making such demand to take further action without notice or demand as
permitted hereunder.

 

9.6 _Entire Agreement_. This Agreement, including the Schedules and Exhibits
hereto and the other documents referred to herein which form a part hereof,
and the Transaction Agreements contain the entire understanding of the Parties
with respect to the subject matter contained herein and therein. This
Agreement supersedes all prior and contemporaneous, agreements,
arrangements, contracts, discussions, negotiations, undertakings and
understandings (whether written or oral) among the Parties with respect to
such subject matter (other than the Transaction Agreements).

 

9.7 _No Third-Party Beneficiaries_. Nothing in this Agreement, express or
implied, is intended to or shall confer upon any Person (other than the
Parties) any right, benefit or remedy of any nature whatsoever under this
Agreement, except that after the Closing, (a) Parent Indemnified Persons shall
be third party beneficiaries for purposes of enforcing the rights granted
herein to such Parent Indemnified Persons and (b) DandO Indemnified Persons
shall be third party beneficiaries for purposes of enforcing the rights
granted to such DandO Indemnified Persons in _Section_ __ _ 5.14_.

 

9.8 _Specific Performance_. The Parties agree that each Party would be
irreparably harmed if any of the provisions of this Agreement are not
performed in accordance with their specific terms and that any breach of this
Agreement by the other Parties could not be compensated adequately by monetary
damages alone. Accordingly, the Parties agree that, in addition to any other
remedy to which such Party may be entitled to at Law or in equity, each Party
shall be entitled to temporary, preliminary and/or permanent injunctive relief
or injunctions to prevent breaches or threatened breaches of this Agreement
and to enforce specifically the terms and provisions of this Agreement
(including the right to compel the other Parties to cause the Transactions to
be consummated on the terms and subject to conditions set forth in this
Agreement) without having to prove irreparable harm or that monetary damages
would be inadequate. The Parties expressly waive any requirement under any Law
that the other Parties obtain any bond or give any other undertaking in
connection with any action seeking injunctive relief or specific performance
of any of the provisions of this Agreement. Each Party further agrees that in
the event of any action for specific performance relating to this Agreement or
the Transactions, such Party shall not assert and hereby waives the defense
that a remedy at Law would be adequate or that specific performance is not an
appropriate remedy for any reason in Law or equity.

 



87

    

9.9 _Severability_. If a court of competent jurisdiction finds that any term
or provision of the Agreement is invalid, illegal or unenforceable under any
Law or public policy, the remaining provisions of the Agreement shall remain
in full force and effect if the economic and legal substance of this Agreement
and the Transactions shall not be affected in any manner materially adverse
to any Party. Any such term or provision found to be illegal, invalid or
unenforceable only in part or in degree shall remain in full force and effect
to the extent not invalid, illegal or unenforceable. Upon the determination
that any term or provision is invalid, illegal or unenforceable, the Parties
intend that such provision shall be construed by modifying or limiting it so
as to be valid and enforceable to the maximum extent possible under
applicable Law and compatible with the consummation of the Transactions as
originally intended.

9.10 _Costs and Expenses_. Except as otherwise specified herein, whether or
not the Transactions are consummated, each Party shall pay all costs and
expenses it has incurred in connection with this Agreement and the
Transactions.

 

9.11 _Time of Essence_. The Parties acknowledge that the Outside Date
specified in _Section_ __ _ 7.1(b)_ __is essential and therefore agree that
no Party wishing to terminate this Agreement in accordance with _Section_ __ _
7.1(b)_ __shall be required to extend the Outside Date to allow any other
Party to satisfy any condition or perform any obligation under this
Agreement.

9.12 _Counterparts_. This Agreement may be executed in several counterparts,
each of which shall be deemed an original copy of this Agreement and all of
which, when taken together, shall constitute one instrument. The exchange of
copies of this Agreement and manually executed signature pages by transmission
by email of a .pdf of a handwritten original signature or signatures to the
other Parties shall constitute effective execution and delivery of this
Agreement and may be used in lieu of the original Agreement for all purposes.
The signature of a Party transmitted by electronic means shall be deemed to
be an original signature for any purpose.

9.13 _Governing Law_. This Agreement and all claims or causes of action
(whether sounding in contract or tort) arising under or related to this
Agreement shall be governed by and construed in accordance with the Laws of
the State of Delaware, without regard to any rule or principle that might
refer the governance or construction of this Agreement to the Laws of another
jurisdiction.

9.14 _Dispute Resolution_.

 

(a) Any Action relating to this Agreement or the enforcement of any provision
of this Agreement shall be brought or otherwise commenced exclusively in the
Delaware Court of Chancery, and to the extent the Delaware Court of Chancery
rejects jurisdiction, in any state or federal court located in the County of
New Castle, State of Delaware. Each Party: (i) expressly and irrevocably
consents and submits to the exclusive jurisdiction in the Delaware Court of
Chancery, and to the extent the Delaware Court of Chancery rejects
jurisdiction, each state and federal court located in the County of New
Castle, State of Delaware (and each appellate court located in the County of
New Castle, State of Delaware) in connection with any such Action; (ii) agrees
that the Delaware Court of Chancery and each state and federal court located
in the County of New Castle, State of Delaware shall be deemed to be a
convenient forum; and (iii) agrees not to assert (by way of motion, as a
defense or otherwise), in any such Action commenced in the Delaware Court of
Chancery or any state or federal court located in the County of New Castle,
State of Delaware, any claim that such party is not subject personally to the
jurisdiction of such court, that such Action has been brought in an
inconvenient forum, that the venue of such Action is improper or that
this Agreement or the subject matter of this Agreement may not be enforced in
or by such court.

 



88

    

(b) EACH PARTY ACKNOWLEDGES AND AGREES THAT ANY CONTROVERSY WHICH MAY ARISE
UNDER THIS  _SECTION 9.14_ IS LIKELY TO INVOLVE COMPLICATED AND DIFFICULT
ISSUES, AND THEREFORE EACH SUCH PARTY HEREBY IRREVOCABLY AND UNCONDITIONALLY
WAIVES ANY RIGHT SUCH PARTY MAY HAVE TO TRIAL BY JURY IN ANY SUCH LEGAL
PROCEEDING. EACH PARTY CERTIFIES AND ACKNOWLEDGES THAT (I) NO REPRESENTATIVE,
AGENT OR ATTORNEY OF ANY OTHER PARTY HAS REPRESENTED, EXPRESSLY OR OTHERWISE,
THAT SUCH OTHER PARTY WOULD NOT, IN THE EVENT OF A LEGAL PROCEEDING, SEEK TO
ENFORCE THE FOREGOING WAIVER, (II) EACH PARTY UNDERSTANDS AND HAS CONSIDERED
THE IMPLICATIONS OF THIS WAIVER, (III) EACH PARTY MAKES THIS WAIVER
VOLUNTARILY AND (IV) EACH PARTY HAS BEEN INDUCED TO ENTER INTO THE AGREEMENT
BY, AMONG OTHER THINGS, THE MUTUAL WAIVERS AND CERTIFICATIONS IN THIS
_SECTION 9.14_.

9.15 _Non-Recourse_. All claims, obligations, liabilities, or causes of
action (whether at Law, in equity, in contract, in tort or otherwise) that may
be based upon, in respect of, arise under, out or by reason of, be connected
with, or relate in any manner to this Agreement, or the negotiation,
execution or performance of this Agreement (including any representation or
warranty made in, in connection with, or as an inducement to, this Agreement),
may be made only against (and such representations and warranties are
those solely of) the Persons that are expressly identified as Parties (the "
_Contracting Parties_ "). No Person who is not a Contracting Party, including
any current, former or future equityholder, incorporator, controlling
person, Affiliate, assignee or Representative of, and any financial advisor,
financing source or lender to, any Contracting Party, or any current, former
or future equityholder, incorporator, controlling person, Affiliate, assignee
or Representative of, and any financial advisor, financing source or lender
to, any of the foregoing or any of their respective successors, predecessors
or assigns (or any successors, predecessors or assigns of the foregoing)
(collectively, the " _Non-Party Affiliates_"), shall have any liability
(whether in Law or in equity, whether in contract or in tort or otherwise) for
any claims, causes of action, or Liabilities arising under, out of,
in connection with, or related in any manner to this Agreement or based on,
in respect of, or by reason of this Agreement or its negotiation, execution,
performance or breach, and, to the maximum extent permitted by Law, each
Contracting Party hereby waives and releases all claims, causes of action or
Liabilities arising under, out of, in connection with or related in any manner
to this Agreement or based on, in respect of, or by reason of this Agreement
or its negotiation, execution, performance or breach against any such Non-
Party Affiliates. Without limiting the foregoing, to the maximum extent
permitted by Law, (a) each Contracting Party hereby waives and releases any
and all rights, claims, demands, or causes of action that may otherwise be
available, whether at Law, in equity, in contract, in tort or otherwise, to
avoid or disregard the entity form of a Contracting Party or otherwise impose
liability of a Contracting Party on any Non-Party Affiliate, whether granted
by statute or based on theories of equity, agency, control, instrumentality,
alter ego, domination, sham, single business enterprise, piercing the
veil, unfairness, undercapitalization or otherwise, in each case arising
under, out of, in connection with or related in any manner to this Agreement
or based on, in respect of or by reason of this Agreement or its negotiation,
execution, performance or breach; and (b) each Contracting Party disclaims
any reliance upon any Non-Party Affiliates with respect to the performance of
this Agreement or any representation or warranty made in, in connection
with or as an inducement to this Agreement. Notwithstanding anything in the
Agreement to the contrary, this Section 9.15 shall not apply to _Section_ __ _
8.4_, which shall be enforceable by the Holders Representative in
its entirety against the Holders.

 



89

    

9.16 _Waiver of Conflict of Interest; Privileged Communications_.

 

(a) Each Party acknowledges and agrees that Cooley LLP (the " _Firm_ ") has
acted as counsel to the Company Group in various matters involving a range of
issues and as counsel to the Company in connection with the negotiation of
this Agreement and consummation of the Transactions.

 

(b) In connection with any matter or dispute under this Agreement, Parent
hereby irrevocably waives and agrees not to assert, and agrees to cause the
Company Group following the Closing to irrevocably waive and not to assert,
any conflict of interest arising from or in connection with (i) the Firms
prior representation of the Company Group and (ii) the Firms representation
of the Holders Representative and/or any of the Holders (collectively, the "
_Seller Parties_ ") prior to and after the Closing.

 

(c) Parent further agrees, on behalf of itself, and, after the Closing, on
behalf of the Company Group, that all communications in any form or format
whatsoever between or among any of the Firm, any of the Company Group, any of
the Seller Parties, or any of their respective Representatives that relate in
any way to the negotiation, documentation and consummation of the Transactions
or, beginning on the date of this Agreement, any dispute arising under this
Agreement (collectively, the " _Deal Communications_ ") shall be deemed to be
retained and owned collectively by the Seller Parties, shall be controlled by
the Holders Representative on behalf of the Holders and shall not pass to or
be claimed by Parent, or, following the Closing, the Company Group. All Deal
Communications that are attorney-client privileged (the " _Privileged
Deal Communications_ ") shall remain privileged after the Closing and the
privilege and the expectation of client confidence relating thereto shall
belong solely to the Holders Representative and the Holders, shall be
controlled by the Holders Representative on behalf of the Holders and shall
not pass to or be claimed by any of Parent, or, following the Closing, the
Company Group; __provided__ _, that_ , nothing contained herein shall be
deemed to be a waiver by any of Parent or any of its Affiliates (including,
after the Closing, the Company Group and their respective Affiliates) of any
applicable privileges or protections that can or may be asserted to prevent
disclosure of any such communications to any third party.

(d) Notwithstanding the foregoing, in the event that a dispute arises between
Parent or, after the Closing, the Company Group, on the one hand, and a third
party other than a Seller Party, on the other hand, Parent or, following the
Closing, the Company Group may assert the attorney-client privilege to prevent
the disclosure of the Privileged Deal Communications to such third party;
__provided__ _,_ _ _however__ , that neither Parent nor, following the
Closing, the Company Group may waive such privilege without the prior written
consent of the Holders Representative. In the event that Parent or,
following the Closing, any member of the Company Group is legally required by
Order or otherwise to access or obtain a copy of all or a portion of the
Privileged Deal Communications, Parent shall immediately (and, in any
event, within two Business Days) notify the Holders Representative in
writing (including by making specific reference to this _Section_ __ _
9.16(d)_) so that the Holders Representative may seek a protective order and
Parent agrees to use all commercially reasonable efforts to assist therewith.

(e) To the extent that files or other materials maintained by the Firm
constitute property of its clients, only the Holders Representative and the
Holders shall hold such property rights, and the Firm shall have no duty to
reveal or disclose any such files or other materials or any Privileged
Deal Communications by reason of any attorney-client relationship between the
Firm, on the one hand, and the Company Group, on the other hand so long as
such files or other materials would be subject to a privilege or protection if
they were being requested in an Action by an unrelated third party.

 



90

    

(f) Parent agrees on behalf of itself and, following the Closing, the Company
Group, (i) to the extent that Parent or, after the Closing, any member of the
Company Group receives or takes physical possession of any Deal
Communications, (A) such physical possession or receipt shall not, in any way,
be deemed a waiver by any of the Seller Parties or any other Person, of the
privileges or protections described in this section, and (B) neither Parent
nor, following the Closing, any member of the Company Group shall assert any
claim that any of the Seller Parties or any other Person waived the attorney-
client privilege, attorney work-product protection or any other right or
expectation of client confidence applicable to any such materials or
communications, (ii) not to access or use the Deal Communications, including
by way of review of any electronic data, communications or other information,
or by seeking to have the Holders Representative or any Holder waive the
attorney-client or other privilege, or by otherwise asserting that Parent or,
following the Closing, the Company has the right to waive the attorney-client
or other privilege and (iii) not to seek to obtain the Deal Communications
from the Firm so long as such Deal Communications would be subject to
a privilege or protection if they were being requested in an Action by an
unrelated third party.
