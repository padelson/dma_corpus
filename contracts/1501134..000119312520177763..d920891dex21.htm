Stock), indemnify, defend and hold harmless the Holders&#146; Representative from and against any and all losses, liabilities, damages, claims, penalties, fines, forfeitures, actions, fees, costs and expenses (including the fees and expenses of

the Holders&#146; Representative from seeking any remedies available to it at law or otherwise. Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the contrary, any restrictions or limitations on liability or indemnification obligations of, or provisions

transactions contemplated hereby. Furthermore, the Holders&#146; Representative shall not be required to take any action unless the Holders&#146; Representative has been provided with funds, security or indemnities which, in its determination, are
sufficient to protect the Holders&#146; Representative against the costs, expenses and liabilities which may be incurred by the Holders&#146; Representative in performing such actions. The Holders&#146; Representative shall be entitled to:

</B>Losses incurred pursuant to this Agreement, or (ii)&nbsp;as otherwise determined by the Holders&#146; Representative (the &#147;<U>Expense Fund</U>&#148;). The Holders&#146; Representative is not providing any investment supervision,
recommendations or advice and shall have no responsibility or liability for any loss of principal of the Expense Fund other than as a result of his gross negligence or willful misconduct. The Holders&#146; Representative will hold these funds
separate from his corporate funds, will not use these funds for any corporate purposes and will not voluntarily make these funds available to his creditors in the event of bankruptcy. The Holders&#146; Representative is not acting as a withholding
agent or in any similar capacity in connection with the Expense Fund, and has no tax reporting or income distribution obligations. The Holders will not receive any interest or earnings on the Expense Fund and irrevocably transfer and assign to the
Holders&#146; Representative any such interest or earnings. The Holders&#146; Representative may contribute funds to the Expense Fund from any consideration otherwise distributable to the Holders. As soon as reasonably determined by the
Holders&#146; Representative that the Expense Fund is no longer required to be withheld, the Holders&#146; Representative shall distribute the remaining Expense Fund (if any) to the Exchange Agent and/or Parent, as applicable, for further
distribution to the Holders. </P>
