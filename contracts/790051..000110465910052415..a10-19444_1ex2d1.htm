 **AGREEMENT AND PLAN OF MERGER**

  



  

THIS AGREEMENT AND PLAN OF MERGER, dated as of October 14, 2010 (this "
_Agreement_ "), by and among **Carlisle Companies Incorporated** , a Delaware
corporation (" _Parent_ "), **HC Corporation** , a Delaware corporation ("
_Merger Sub_ "), and **Hawk Corporation** , a Delaware corporation (the "
_Company_ ").

  



  

 **RECITALS**

  



  

1. The respective Boards of Directors of the Company, Parent and Merger Sub have approved the acquisition of the Company by Parent on the terms and subject to the conditions set forth in this Agreement.

  



  

2. In furtherance of such acquisition, Parent has agreed to cause Merger Sub to commence a tender offer (as it may be amended from time to time as permitted under this Agreement, the " _Offer_ ") to purchase all the issued and outstanding shares of Class A common stock, par value $0.01 per share, of the Company (the " _Company Common Stock_ "), including the associated Rights (each, a " _Share_ " and, collectively, the " _Shares_ ") at a price per Share of $50.00 (such amount, or any other amount per Share paid pursuant to the Offer and this Agreement, the " _Offer Price_ "), net to the seller in cash, without interest, on the terms and subject to the conditions set forth in this Agreement and the Offer.

  



  

3. The Board of Directors of the Company (the " _Company Board_ "), based upon the recommendation of a special committee thereof consisting solely of independent directors (the " _Special Committee_ "), has (i) determined that this Agreement and the Transactions, including the Offer and the Merger, are advisable, fair to and in the best interests of the Companys stockholders and (ii) approved this Agreement and the Transactions, including the Offer and the Merger, on the terms and subject to the conditions set forth herein.

  



  

4. Following consummation of the Offer, the parties intend that Merger Sub will be merged with and into the Company (the " _Merger_ "), with the Company surviving the Merger as a wholly owned subsidiary of Parent in accordance with the General Corporation Law of the State of Delaware (the " _DGCL_ "), and each Share that is not tendered and accepted pursuant to the Offer will thereupon be cancelled and converted into the right to receive cash in an amount equal to the Offer Price, on the terms and subject to the conditions set forth herein.

  



  

5. The respective Boards of Directors of Parent and Merger Sub have (i) determined that this Agreement and the Transactions, including the Offer and the Merger, are advisable, fair to and in the best interests of their respective stockholders and (ii) approved this Agreement and the Transactions, including the Offer and the Merger, on the terms and subject to the conditions set forth herein.

  



  

6. Concurrently with the execution and delivery of this Agreement, and as a condition and inducement to Parent entering into this Agreement, certain holders of Company Common Stock have entered into a tender and voting agreement, dated as of the Agreement, in substantially the form set forth in _Annex B_ hereof, pursuant to which, among other things, each such holder of Company Common Stock has agreed to tender his or its Shares in the Offer (the " _Tender and Voting Agreement_ ").

  



        
   

  



  

7. Prior to the execution and delivery of this Agreement, and as a condition and inducement to Parent entering into this Agreement, certain officers of the Company have entered into agreements with the Company in substantially the forms set forth in _Annex C_  hereof, which agreements shall become effective only upon consummation of the Merger.

  



  

NOW, THEREFORE, in consideration of the foregoing and of the
respective representations, warranties, covenants and agreements set forth in
this Agreement and intending to be legally bound hereby, the parties hereto
agree as follows:

  



  

 **ARTICLE 1: 
 THE OFFER**

  



  

SECTION 1.1 _The Offer_.

  



  

(a) Provided that this Agreement shall not have been terminated in accordance
with _Section 8.1_, (i) as promptly as practicable but in no event later
than October 25, 2010, Merger Sub shall, and Parent shall cause Merger Sub
to, file with the Ohio Division of Securities and the Company a Form 041 and
such other documents as may be required in accordance with Section 1701.041
of the Ohio Revised Code, and (ii) as promptly as practicable but in no
event later than one Business Day after clearance of the Form 041, Merger
Sub shall, and Parent shall cause Merger Sub to, commence the Offer within
the meaning of the applicable rules and regulations of the SEC. The
obligations of Merger Sub to, and of Parent to cause Merger Sub to, accept
for payment, and pay for, any Shares tendered pursuant to the Offer are
subject to the conditions set forth in _Annex A_ (collectively, the " _Offer
Conditions_ ").

  



  

(b) The Offer may not be terminated prior to its scheduled expiration (as
such expiration may be extended or re-extended in accordance with this
Agreement and applicable Law), unless this Agreement is terminated in
accordance with _Section 8.1_. Merger Sub expressly reserves the right to
waive any condition to the Offer or modify the terms of the Offer, except
that, without the prior written consent of the Company, Merger Sub shall not
(i) reduce the number of Shares subject to the Offer, (ii) reduce the Offer
Price, (iii) waive or change the Minimum Tender Condition (as defined in
_Annex A_ ), (iv) add to the Offer Conditions or modify any of the Offer
Conditions in a manner adverse to the holders of Shares, (v) extend the Offer
(except as expressly provided below), (vi) change the form of consideration
payable in the Offer or (vii) otherwise amend the Offer in any manner adverse
to the holders of Shares. Notwithstanding the foregoing, Merger Sub may,
without the consent of the Company, extend the Offer for any period required
by any rule, regulation, interpretation or position of the SEC or the staff
thereof or of Amex applicable to the Offer.

  



  

(c) The initial expiration date of the Offer shall be the 20th Business Day
following the commencement of the Offer (determined using Rule 14d-2(a)
promulgated by the SEC under the Exchange Act). If at the
initially scheduled or any extended expiration date of the Offer, any of the
Offer Conditions (other than any Offer Conditions which by their nature are
to be satisfied at the closing of the Offer) are not satisfied or, if
permitted, waived, Merger Sub shall, and Parent shall cause Merger Sub to,
extend the Offer for one or more periods ending not later than the Outside
Date to permit such Offer Conditions to be satisfied; _provided_ that Merger
Sub shall not be required to extend the Offer beyond the Outside Date. If,
following the expiration of the Offer, fewer than 90% of the issued and
outstanding Shares are accepted for payment pursuant to the Offer, then
Merger Sub may, and at the request of the Company, shall, and upon any such

  



        
   

  



  

request of the Company, Parent shall cause Merger Sub to, make available a
"subsequent offering period," in accordance with Rule 14d-11 promulgated by
the SEC under the Exchange Act.

  



  

(d) On the terms and subject to the conditions of the Offer and this
Agreement, Merger Sub shall, and Parent shall cause Merger Sub to, (i)
promptly after the expiration of the Offer, accept for payment all Shares
validly tendered and not withdrawn pursuant to the Offer, and (ii) promptly
after the Acceptance Time, pay the Offer Price for such Shares. For the
avoidance of doubt, the parties hereto agree that vested shares of Restricted
Stock may be tendered in the Offer and be acquired by Parent or Merger Sub
pursuant to the Offer.

  



  

(e) Parent shall provide or cause to be provided to Merger Sub on a timely
basis the funds necessary to purchase any Shares that Merger Sub becomes
obligated to purchase pursuant to the Offer.

  



  

(f) On the date of commencement of the Offer, Parent and Merger Sub shall
file with the SEC a Tender Offer Statement on Schedule TO with respect to the
Offer, which shall contain an offer to purchase and a form of transmittal and
summary advertisement (such Schedule TO and the documents included therein
pursuant to which the Offer will be made, together with any supplements or
amendments thereto, the " _Offer Documents_ ").  The Company shall promptly
provide Parent with all information relating to the Company that is required
to be included in the Offer Documents, and hereby consents to the inclusion
in the Offer Documents of the recommendations of the Company Board and the
Special Committee described in clauses (iii) and (iv) of the second sentence
of _Section 3.3(b)_ and clause (iii) of the first sentence of _Section
3.3(b)_. Each of Parent, Merger Sub and the Company shall promptly correct
any information provided by it for use in the Offer Documents if and to the
extent that such information shall have become false or misleading in any
material respect, and each of Parent and Merger Sub shall take all steps
necessary to amend or supplement the Offer Documents and to cause the Offer
Documents as so amended or supplemented to be filed with the SEC and the
Offer Documents as so amended or supplemented to be disseminated to the
holders of Shares, in each case as and to the extent required by
applicable federal securities Laws. The Company and its counsel shall be
given reasonable opportunity to review and comment upon the Offer Documents
and any amendments or supplements thereto prior to filing such documents with
the SEC or disseminating such documents to the stockholders of the Company
and Parent and Merger Sub shall give reasonable and good faith consideration
to any comments made by the Company and its counsel. Parent and Merger Sub
shall provide the Company and its counsel in writing with any comments
Parent, Merger Sub or their counsel may receive from the SEC or its staff
with respect to the Offer Documents promptly after the receipt of such
comments and shall consult with the Company and its counsel prior to
responding to such comments. Parent and Merger Sub shall provide the Company
and its counsel with a reasonable opportunity to participate in the response
of Parent and Merger Sub to those comments and to review and provide comments
on that response (to which reasonable and good faith consideration shall be
given) and shall provide the Company and its counsel with a copy of any
written response sent to the SEC and telephonic notice of any oral responses
or discussions with SEC staff.

  



  

(g) After the date hereof and prior to the date of commencement of the Offer,
and as reasonably requested by Parent, the Company shall assist Parent in the
preparation of Form 041 pursuant to Ohio Revised Code Section 1707.041. Each
of Parent, Merger Sub and the Company

  



        
   

  



  

shall promptly correct any information provided by it for use in the Form 041
if and to the extent that such information shall have become false or
misleading in any material respect, and each of Parent and Merger Sub shall
take all steps necessary to amend or supplement the Form 041, as and to the
extent required by applicable Law.

  



  

SECTION 1.2 _Company Actions_.

  



  

(a) The Company hereby consents to the Offer, the Merger and the other
transactions contemplated by this Agreement (collectively, the "
_Transactions_ "). The Company has been advised that all of its directors and
named executive officers (as that term is defined in Item 402 of Regulation
S-K of the SEC) who own Shares intend to tender their Shares pursuant to the
Offer.

  



  

(b) On the date of commencement of the Offer, the Company shall file with the
SEC a Solicitation/Recommendation Statement on Schedule 14D-9 with respect to
the Offer (such Schedule 14D-9, as amended from time to time, the " _Schedule
14D-9_") describing the recommendations referred to in _Section 3.3(b)_
(subject to _Section 6.8_) and shall mail the Schedule 14D-9 to the holders
of Shares. Parent and Merger Sub shall promptly provide the Company with all
information relating to Parent and Merger Sub that is required to be included
in the Schedule 14D-9. Each of the Company, Parent and Merger Sub shall
promptly correct any information provided by it for use in the Schedule
14D-9 if and to the extent that such information shall have become false
or misleading in any material respect, and the Company shall take all
steps necessary to amend or supplement the Schedule 14D-9 and to cause
the Schedule 14D-9 as so amended or supplemented to be filed with the SEC
and disseminated to the holders of Shares, in each case as and to the
extent required by applicable federal securities Laws.  Parent and its
counsel shall be given reasonable opportunity to review and comment upon the
Schedule 14D-9 and any amendments or supplements thereto prior to filing such
documents with the SEC or disseminating such documents to the stockholders of
the Company and the Company shall give reasonable and good faith
consideration to any comments made by Parent and its counsel. The Company
shall provide Parent and its counsel in writing with any comments the Company
or its counsel may receive from the SEC or its staff with respect to the
Schedule 14D-9 promptly after the receipt of such comments and shall consult
with Parent and its counsel prior to responding to such comments. The Company
shall provide Parent and its counsel with a reasonable opportunity to
participate in the response of the Company to those comments and to review
and provide comments on that response (to which reasonable and good faith
consideration shall be given). The Company shall provide the Parent and
its counsel with a copy of any written response sent to the SEC and
telephonic notice of any oral responses or discussions with SEC staff.

  



  

(c) In connection with the Offer, the Company shall instruct its transfer
agent to furnish Merger Sub promptly with mailing labels containing the names
and addresses of the record holders of Company Common Stock as of a recent
date and of those persons becoming record holders subsequent to such date,
together with copies of all lists of stockholders, security position listings
and computer files and all other information in the Companys possession or
control regarding the beneficial owners of Shares, and shall furnish to
Merger Sub such information and assistance (including updated lists of
stockholders, security position listings and computer files) as Parent may
reasonably request in communicating the Offer to the holders of Shares.
 Subject to the requirements of applicable Law, and except for such steps as
are necessary to disseminate

  



        
   

  



  

the Offer Documents and any other documents necessary to consummate the
Transactions, Parent and Merger Sub shall hold in confidence the information
contained in any such labels, listings and files, shall use such information
only in connection with the Offer and the Merger and, if this Agreement shall
be terminated, shall, upon request, deliver to the Company all copies of such
information then in their possession.

  



  

SECTION 1.3 _Top-Up Option_.

  



  

(a) Subject to _Section 1.3(b)_ and  _Section 1.3(c)_, the Company grants
to Merger Sub an irrevocable option (the " _Top-Up Option_ "), for so long
as this Agreement has not been terminated pursuant to the provisions hereof,
to purchase from the Company up to the number (but not less than that number)
of authorized and unissued shares of Company Common Stock equal to the number
of shares of Company Common Stock that, when added to the number of Shares
owned by Parent, Merger Sub or any Subsidiary of Parent at the time of the
exercise of the Top-Up Option, constitutes at least one Share more than 90%
of the Shares that would be outstanding immediately after the issuance of all
shares of Company Common Stock to be issued upon exercise of the Top-Up
Option (such Shares to be issued upon exercise of the Top-Up Option, the "
_Top-Up Shares_ ").

  



  

(b) The Top-Up Option may be exercised by Merger Sub only once, at any time
during the two-Business Day period following the Acceptance Time, or if any
subsequent offering period is provided, during the two-Business Day period
following the expiration date of such subsequent offering period, and only if
Merger Sub shall own as of such time more than 75% but less than 90% of the
shares of Company Common Stock outstanding; _provided_ that,
notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the contrary, the Top-Up Option
shall not be exercisable (i) to the extent the number of shares of Company
Common Stock issuable upon exercise of the Top-Up Option would exceed the
number of authorized but unissued and unreserved shares of Company Common
Stock, (ii) if any Judgment then in effect shall prohibit the exercise of the
Top-Up Option or the delivery of the Top-Up Shares, and (iii) unless Parent
or Merger Sub has accepted for payment all Shares validly tendered in the
Offer and not withdrawn. The Top-Up Option shall terminate upon the earlier
to occur of (i) the Effective Time and (ii) termination of this Agreement in
accordance with _Article 8_. The aggregate purchase price payable for
the Top-Up Shares being purchased by Merger Sub pursuant to the Top-Up Option
shall be determined by multiplying the number of such Top-Up Shares by the
Offer Price, without interest. Such purchase price may be paid by Merger
Sub, at its election, either (A) entirely in cash or (B) by paying in cash an
amount equal to not less than the aggregate par value of such Top-Up Shares
and by executing and delivering to the Company a promissory note having a
principal amount equal to the balance of such purchase price. Any such
promissory note shall bear interest at the rate of 3% per annum, shall mature
on the first anniversary of the date of execution and delivery of such
promissory note and may be prepaid without premium or penalty.  Without the
prior written consent of the Company, the right to exercise the Top-Up Option
granted pursuant to this Agreement shall not be assigned by Merger Sub except
to any direct or indirect wholly owned Subsidiary of Parent. Any attempted
assignment in violation of this _Section 1.3(b)_ shall be null and void.

  



  

(c) In the event Merger Sub wishes to exercise the Top-Up Option, Merger Sub
shall deliver to the Company written notice (the " _Top-Up Notice_
") setting forth (i) the number of Top-Up Shares that Merger Sub intends
to purchase pursuant to the Top-Up Option, (ii) the manner in

  



        
   

  



  

which Merger Sub intends to pay the applicable purchase price and (iii) the
place and time at which the closing of the purchase of such Top-Up Shares by
Merger Sub is to take place. The Top-Up Notice shall also include
an undertaking signed by Parent and Merger Sub that, promptly following such
exercise of the Top-Up Option, Merger Sub intends to consummate the Merger in
accordance with Section 253 of the DGCL as contemplated by _Section 6.1(c)_.
At the closing of the purchase of the Top-Up Shares, Parent and Merger Sub
shall cause to be delivered to the Company the consideration required to be
delivered in exchange for the Top-Up Shares, and the Company shall cause to
be issued to Merger Sub a certificate representing the Top-Up Shares. The
parties hereto agree to use their reasonable best efforts to cause the
closing of the purchase of the Top-Up Shares to occur on the same day that
the Top-Up Notice is deemed received by the Company pursuant to _Section
9.1_, and if not so consummated on such day, as promptly thereafter as
possible. The parties further agree to use their reasonable best efforts to
cause the Merger to be consummated in accordance with Section 253 of the DGCL
as contemplated by _Section 6.1(c)_ as close in time as possible to
(including, to the extent possible, on the same day as) the issuance of the
Top-Up Shares.  Parent, Merger Sub and the Company shall cooperate to ensure
that any issuance of the Top-Up Shares is accomplished in a manner consistent
with all applicable Laws.

  



  

(d) Parent and Merger Sub understand that the Top-Up Shares will not be
registered under the Securities Act, and will be issued in reliance upon an
exemption thereunder for transactions not involving a public offering.  Each
of Parent and Merger Sub represents and warrants to the Company that Merger
Sub is, and will be upon any exercise of the Top-Up Option, an
"accredited investor" as defined in Rule 501 of Regulation D promulgated
under the Securities Act. Each of Parent and Merger Sub represents, warrants
and agrees that the Top-Up Option is being, and the Top-Up Shares will be,
acquired by Merger Sub for the purpose of investment and not with a view to
or for resale in connection with any distribution thereof within the meaning
of the Securities Act. Any certificates evidencing Top-Up Shares shall
include any legends required by applicable securities Laws.

  



  

(e) Any dilutive impact on the value of the Shares as a result of the
issuance of the Top-Up Shares will not be taken into account in any
determination of the fair value of any Appraisal Shares pursuant to Section
262 as contemplated by _Section 2.7(c)_.

the second Business Day after satisfaction or (to the extent permitted by

reasonable efforts to (i) cause the Closing to occur on or prior to December
31, 2010 and (ii) make requisite payments hereunder on or prior to December
31, 2010 (so long as the payee has timely delivered all required
documentation in proper form to allow for such payment to be made on or prior
to such date).

  



  

SECTION 2.4 _Consummation of the Merger_. As soon as practicable after
consummation of the Offer and the satisfaction or waiver (if permitted) of
the conditions of the Merger set forth in Article 7, the parties hereto shall
cause the Merger to be consummated by filing with the Secretary of State of
the State of Delaware a certificate of merger or other appropriate documents
(in any such case, the " _Certificate of Merger_ ") in such form as required
by, and executed in accordance with, the relevant provisions of the DGCL and
shall make all other filings or recordings required under the DGCL. The
Merger shall become effective at such time and date as the Certificate of
Merger is duly filed with such Secretary of State, or at such later time as
Parent and the Company shall agree and specify in the Certificate of Merger
(the time and date the Merger becomes effective being referred to herein as
the " _Effective Time_ " and " _Effective Date_ ," respectively).

  



  

SECTION 2.5 _Organizational Documents; Directors and Officers_.
The certificate of incorporation of the Company, as in effective immediately
prior to the Effective Time, shall be the certificate of incorporation of
the Surviving Corporation until thereafter changed or amended as provided
herein or by applicable Law or amended at the Effective Time. The by-laws of
the Company, as in effect immediately prior to the Effective Time, shall be
the by-laws of the Surviving Corporation until thereafter amended as provided
therein and by applicable Law. The directors of Merger Sub immediately prior
to the Effective Time shall be the initial directors of the
Surviving Corporation and shall serve until the earlier of their resignation
or removal or their respective successors are duly elected or appointed and
qualified, as the case may be. The officers of the Company immediately prior
to the Effective Time shall be the initial officers of the Surviving
Corporation and shall serve until the earlier of their resignation or removal
or until their respective successors have been duly elected or appointed and
qualified, as the case may be.

  



  

SECTION 2.6 _Conversion of Merger Sub Capital Stock_. At the Effective Time,
by virtue of the Merger and without any action on the part of Parent, Merger
Sub, the Company or any holder of shares of Merger Sub capital stock, each
share of Merger Sub capital stock shall be converted into and become
one fully paid and nonassessable share of common stock, par value $0.01 per
share, of the Surviving Corporation.

  



  

SECTION 2.7 _Conversion of Company Common Stock_. At the Effective Time,
by virtue of the Merger and without any action on the part of Parent, Merger
Sub, the Company or any holder of Shares:

  



        
   

  



  

(a) Each Share issued and outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time
(other than any shares to be canceled pursuant to _Section 2.7(b)_ and any
Appraisal Shares) shall be canceled and shall be converted automatically into
the right to receive an amount in cash per share equal to the Offer
Price without interest thereon (the " _Merger Consideration_ "). As of the
Effective Time, all such Shares shall no longer be outstanding and shall
automatically be canceled and shall cease to exist, and each holder of a
certificate representing any such Shares shall cease to have any rights with
respect thereto, except the right to receive the Merger Consideration upon
surrender of such certificate in accordance with _Section 2.8_, without
interest.

  



  

(b) Each Share held in the treasury of the Company and each Share owned by
Merger Sub, Parent or any wholly owned Subsidiary of Parent or of the Company
immediately prior to the Effective Time shall be canceled and retired and
shall cease to exist, without any conversion thereof and no payment
or distribution shall be made with respect thereto.

  



  

(c) _Appraisal Rights_.  Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the
contrary, Shares that are outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time
and that are held by any person who is entitled to demand and properly
demands appraisal of such Shares (collectively, " _Appraisal Shares_
") pursuant to, and who complied in all respects with, Section 262 of
the DGCL (" _Section 262_") shall not be converted into the right to
receive Merger Consideration as provided in _Section 2.7(a)_, but rather the
holders of Appraisal Shares shall be entitled to payment of the fair value of
such Appraisal Shares in accordance with Section 262 (and at the Effective
Time, such Appraisal Shares shall no longer be outstanding and shall
automatically be cancelled and shall cease to exist, and such holders
shall cease to have any right with respect thereto, except the right to
receive the fair value of such Appraisal Shares in accordance with Section
262); _provided_ , _however_ , that if any such holder shall fail to perfect
or otherwise shall waive, withdraw or lose the right to appraisal under
Section 262, then the right of such holder to be paid the fair value of such
holders Appraisal Shares shall cease and such Appraisal Shares shall be
deemed to have been converted as of the Effective Time into, and to have
become exchangeable solely for the right to receive, Merger Consideration as
provided in _Section 2.7(a)_. The Company shall serve prompt notice
to Parent of any demands received by the Company for appraisal of any Shares,
and after the Acceptance Time, Parent shall have the right to direct
all negotiations and proceedings with respect to such demands. After the
Acceptance Time, except with the prior written consent of Parent, the Company
shall not make any payment with respect to, or offer to settle or settle any
such demands.

  



  

SECTION 2.8 _Exchange of Certificates_.

  



  

(a) _Exchange Agent_.  Prior to the Effective Time, Parent shall enter into
an agreement with such bank or trust company selected by Parent and
reasonably acceptable to the Company (the " _Exchange Agent_ "), which
shall provide for the payment of Merger Consideration in accordance with the
terms of this _Section 2.8_. Parent shall, or shall take all steps
necessary to enable and cause the Surviving Corporation to, deposit with the
Exchange Agent as of the Effective Time, for the benefit of the holders of
shares of Company Common Stock, for payment by the Exchange Agent in
accordance with this Article 2, the cash necessary to pay for the Shares
converted into the right to receive Merger Consideration (the " _Exchange
Fund_ "). The Exchange Fund shall not be used for any other purpose. The
Exchange Fund shall, pending its disbursement to such holders, be invested by
the Exchange Agent as directed by Parent. Any net profit resulting from, or
interest or income produced by, such amounts on deposit with the

  



        
   

  



  

Exchange Agent will be payable to Parent or as Parent otherwise directs. Any
portion of the Merger Consideration deposited with the Exchange Agent to pay
for Shares for which appraisal rights have been perfected shall be returned
to Parent upon demand. If for any reason (including losses), the cash in the
Exchange Fund shall be insufficient to fully satisfy all of the payment
obligations to be made in cash by the Exchange Agent hereunder, Parent shall
promptly deposit cash into the Exchange Fund in an amount that is equal to
the deficiency in the amount of cash required to fully satisfy such
cash payment obligations.

  



  

(b) _Exchange Procedures_.  As soon as reasonably practicable after the
Effective Time but in any event not later than five Business Days thereafter,
the Exchange Agent shall mail to each holder of record of a certificate or
certificates which immediately prior to the Effective Time represented
outstanding Shares and whose Shares were converted into the right to receive
the Merger Consideration pursuant to _Section 2.7_ (collectively, the "
_Certificates_ "), (i) a letter of transmittal (which shall specify that
delivery shall be effected, and risk of loss and title to the Certificates
shall pass, only upon delivery of the Certificates to the Exchange Agent and
shall be in such form and have such other provisions as Parent may reasonably
specify) and (ii) instructions for use in surrendering the Certificates in
exchange for the Merger Consideration. Upon surrender of a Certificate for
cancellation to the Exchange Agent, together with such letter of transmittal,
duly executed, and such other documents as may reasonably be required by the
Exchange Agent, the holder of such Certificate shall receive in
exchange therefor the amount of cash which the Shares theretofore represented
by such Certificate entitle such holder to receive pursuant to the provisions
of this _Article 2_ and the Certificate so surrendered shall forthwith be
canceled. In the event of a transfer of ownership of Shares that is not
registered in the transfer records of the Company, payment may be made to a
Person other than the Person in whose name the Certificate so surrendered is
registered if such Certificate shall be properly endorsed or otherwise be in
proper form for transfer and the Person requesting such issuance shall pay
any transfer or other Taxes required by reason of the payment to a Person
other than the registered holder of such Certificate or establish to the
satisfaction of Parent that such Tax has been paid or is not applicable. Each
Certificate shall be deemed at any time after the Effective Time to represent
only the right to receive upon surrender in accordance with this _Section
2.8_ the Merger Consideration into which the shares of Company Common Stock
shall have been converted pursuant to _Section 2.7_. No interest shall be
paid or shall accrue on any cash payable to holders of Certificates pursuant
to the provisions of this _Article 2_.

  



  

(c) _No Further Ownership Rights in Company Common Stock_. The Merger
Consideration paid upon the surrender for exchange of Certificates in
accordance with the terms of this _Article 2_ shall be deemed to have been
paid in full satisfaction of all rights pertaining to the Shares theretofore
represented by such Certificates, _subject_ , _however_ , to the Surviving
Corporations obligation to pay any dividends or make any other distributions
with a record date prior to the Effective Time that may have been declared or
made by the Company on such Shares in accordance with the terms of this
Agreement or prior to the date of this Agreement and that remain unpaid
at the Effective Time, and there shall be no further registration of
transfers on the stock transfer books of the Company of the Shares that were
outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time.  If, after the
Effective Time, Certificates are presented to the Surviving Corporation or
the Exchange Agent for any reason, they shall be canceled and exchanged as
provided in this _Article 2_, except as otherwise provided by applicable
Law.

  



        
   

  



  

(d) _Termination of Exchange Fund_. Any portion of the Exchange Fund that
remains undistributed to the holders of Certificates for one year after the
Effective Time shall be delivered to Parent, upon demand, and any holders of
Certificates who have not theretofore complied with this _Article 2_
shall thereafter look only to Parent for payment of their claim for
Merger Consideration.

  



  

(e) _No Liability_.  None of Parent, Merger Sub, the Company or the Exchange
Agent shall be liable to any Person in respect of any cash from the Exchange
Fund delivered to a public official pursuant to any applicable abandoned
property, escheat or similar Law. If any Certificate shall not have been
surrendered prior to five years after the Effective Time (or immediately
prior to such earlier date on which any amounts payable pursuant to this
_Article 2_ would otherwise escheat to or become the property of any
Governmental Authority, any such amounts shall, to the extent permitted
by applicable Law, become the property of the Surviving Corporation, free
and clear of all claims or interest of any Person previously entitled
thereto.

  



  

(f) _Lost Certificates_.  If any Certificate shall have been lost, stolen or
destroyed, then upon the making of an affidavit of that fact by the Person
claiming such Certificate to be lost, stolen or destroyed and, if required by
Parent, the posting by such Person of a bond in such reasonable amount as
Parent may direct as indemnity against any claim that may be made against it
with respect to such Certificate, the Exchange Agent shall issue in exchange
for such lost, stolen or destroyed Certificate the applicable Merger
Consideration with respect thereto pursuant to this Agreement.

  



  

(g) _Withholding Rights_.  Each of Parent, Merger Sub and the Exchange Agent
shall be entitled to deduct and withhold from the consideration otherwise
payable pursuant to this Agreement to any holder of Shares such amounts as it
is required to deduct and withhold with respect to the making of such payment
under the applicable Tax Law. To the extent that amounts are so withheld by
Parent, Merger Sub or the Exchange Agent and paid to the appropriate taxing
authorities, such withheld amounts shall be treated for all purposes of this
Agreement as having been paid to the holder of the Shares in respect of which
such deduction and withholding was made by Parent, Merger Sub or the Exchange
Agent.

  



  

SECTION 2.9 _Company Options; Restricted Stock; Stock Plans_.

  



  

(a) At the Effective Time, without any action on the part of any holder of
any outstanding Option, whether vested or unvested, exercisable
or unexercisable: (i) each Option that is outstanding and unexercised
immediately prior thereto shall immediately and fully vest; (ii) subject to
the terms and conditions set forth below in this _Section 2.9_, each such
Option shall terminate and be cancelled at the Effective Time; and (iii) each
holder of an Option will be entitled to receive from the Company, and shall
receive as soon as practicable following the Effective Time, in settlement of
each Option a single lump sum Cash Amount. The " _Cash Amount_ " shall be
equal to the net amount of (i) the product of (A) the excess, if any, of the
Merger Consideration over the exercise price per share of such Option,
_multiplied by_ (B) the number of shares subject to such Option, _less_ (ii)
any income or employment Tax required to be withheld under any applicable
state, local, or foreign Tax Laws or any other applicable Law. If the
exercise price per share of any Option equals or exceeds the Merger
Consideration, the Cash Amount therefor shall be zero and, for the avoidance
of doubt, such Options shall terminate and be cancelled at the Effective
Time. To the extent that any amounts are withheld, those amounts

  



        
   

  



  

shall be treated as having been paid to the holder of that Option for all
purposes under this Agreement. The Company shall make the payments in respect
of the Options as soon as practicable, but in no event later than
five Business Days, following the cancellation of such Options as
contemplated by this _Section 2.9(a)_ and delivery to the Company by each
holder thereof of the agreements reflecting such cancelled Options (or such
other satisfactory documentation as mutually agreed by the Company and
Merger Sub). Upon written notice from the Company, Parent shall cause Merger
Sub to pay to the Company an amount in cash sufficient to fund the Companys
payment obligation, including the requisite employee and employer Tax
required to be withheld under any applicable state, local or foreign Tax
Laws, under this _Section 2.9(a)_ as such amounts are paid.

  



  

(b) At the Effective Time, each outstanding unvested share of Restricted
Stock will be vested and no longer subject to restrictions and will be
canceled and be converted into, and constitute the right to receive,
the Merger Consideration, which shall be payable in accordance with _Section
2.7_ and _Section 2.8_ of this Agreement.  Any payment made pursuant to
this _Section 2.9(b)_ to the holder of any shares of Restricted Stock shall
be reduced by any income or employment Taxes required to be withheld under
any applicable state, local or foreign Tax Laws or any other applicable Law.

  



  

(c) As soon as practicable following the date of this Agreement, the Company
Board (or, if appropriate, any committee thereof administering the Stock
Plans) shall adopt such resolutions or take such other actions as may
be required to terminate the Stock Plans as of the Effective Time.

  



  

SECTION 2.10 _Taking of Necessary Action; Further Action_. Each of
Parent, Merger Sub and the Company shall use reasonable best efforts to take
all such actions as may be necessary or appropriate in order to promptly
effectuate the Merger under the DGCL. If at any time after the Effective
Time, any further action is necessary or desirable to carry out the purposes
of this Agreement and to vest the Surviving Corporation with full right,
title and possession to all assets, property, rights, privileges, powers and
franchises of either Merger Sub or the Company, the officers and directors of
the Surviving Corporation are fully authorized in the name of each of Merger
Sub and the Company or otherwise to take, and shall take, all such lawful and
necessary action.

(q) _Adverse Actions_. Take, or omit to take, any action that
would reasonably be expected to result in any of the Offer Conditions or any
of the conditions to the Merger set forth in _Article 7_ not being
satisfied in a timely manner.

  



  

(r) _Commitments_. Enter into any contract or binding commitment with respect
to any of the foregoing.

  



  

SECTION 5.2 _Conduct of Business by Parent Pending the Merger_. Parent
agrees that, from the date hereof until the Effective Time, without the prior
written consent of the Company, except as required by applicable Law, Parent
shall not, and shall cause each of the Parent Subsidiaries (including Merger
Sub) not to, take or omit to take any action that would reasonably be
expected to result in any of the Offer Conditions or any of the conditions to
the Merger set forth in Article 7 not being satisfied in a timely manner.

  



  

SECTION 5.3 _No Right to Control Company Prior to Acceptance Time_. Nothing
contained in this Agreement is intended to give Parent or Merger Sub,
directly or indirectly, the right to control or direct the Companys or any
Company Subsidiarys operations prior to the Acceptance Time. Prior to the
Acceptance Time, the Company and the Company Subsidiaries shall exercise,
consistent with the terms and conditions of this Agreement, complete control
and supervision over their respective businesses, assets and properties.

  



  

 **ARTICLE 6: 
 ADDITIONAL AGREEMENTS**

  



  

SECTION 6.1 _Stockholder Approval_.

  



  

(a) If required by applicable Law in order to consummate the Merger, the
Company, acting through the Company Board, shall, in accordance with
applicable Law and the Companys certificate of incorporation and by-
laws, duly call, give notice of, convene and hold, as promptly as practicable
after the Acceptance Time, an annual or special meeting of its stockholders
for the purpose of considering and taking action on this Agreement and the
Merger (the " _Company Stockholders Meeting_ ").

  



  

(b) If approval of the Companys stockholders is required by applicable Law
to consummate the Merger, promptly following the Acceptance Time, the Company
shall prepare and file the Proxy Statement with the SEC under the Exchange
Act in preliminary form, and shall use its reasonable best efforts to have
the Proxy Statement cleared by the SEC promptly. Each of the Company, Parent
and Merger Sub agrees to use its reasonable best efforts, after

  



        
   

  



  

consultation with the other parties, to respond promptly to all comments of
and requests by the SEC with respect to the Proxy Statement and to cause the
Proxy Statement and all required amendments and supplements thereto to be
mailed to the holders of Shares entitled to vote at the Company Stockholders
Meeting at the earliest practicable time.

  



  

(c) Notwithstanding the foregoing, if Parent, Merger Sub and any other Parent
Subsidiary shall collectively acquire at least 90% of the then outstanding
Shares pursuant to the Offer, the parties shall take all necessary and
appropriate action to cause the Merger to become effective as soon
as practicable after the expiration of the Offer without a stockholders
meeting in accordance with Section 253 of the DGCL.

  



  

(d) Parent shall cause all Shares purchased pursuant to the Offer and all
other Shares owned by Parent, Merger Sub or any Parent Subsidiary to be voted
in favor of the adoption of this Agreement.

  



  

SECTION 6.2 _Employee Benefit Matters_.

  



  

(a) Parent agrees to honor in accordance with their terms all Company
Employee Benefit Plans listed in Section 6.2(a) of the Company Disclosure
Letter.

  



  

(b) Section 6.2(b) of the Company Disclosure Letter lists certain Company
Employee Benefit Plans that entitle certain employees to payments on or after
the Acceptance Time.  Parent agrees that the total amount of such payments
shall be made on or after the Acceptance Time at such time, and in such
manner, as is described in Section 6.2(b) of the Company Disclosure Letter.

  



  

(c) For twelve months following the Effective Time, Parent agrees to provide
to (i) former employees employee benefits that are substantially comparable,
in the aggregate, to such employee benefits currently provided by the Company
and the Company Subsidiaries to such former employees and (ii) employees of
the Company and the Company Subsidiaries who continue employment with the
Surviving Corporation or any of its affiliates (the " _Covered Employees_ ")
base salary or base wages and employee benefits (excluding, for this purpose,
any equity-based compensation and any severance benefits) that are
substantially comparable, in the aggregate, to such salary or wages and
employee benefits currently provided by the Company and the Company
Subsidiaries to such Covered Employees. Parent agrees that, if the Effective
Time occurs on or before December 31, 2010, any employee of the Company or a
Company Subsidiary who is employed by the Company or a Company Subsidiary
as of the Effective Time shall be deemed, solely for the purposes of the
Company Employee Benefit Plans listed on Section 6.2(c) of the
Company Disclosure Letter, to be employed by the Company or such Company
Subsidiary as of December 31, 2010, and any payments required to be made to
such employees under such listed Company Employee Benefit Plans as of
December 31, 2010 shall be made. After January 1, 2011, Parent shall be
under no obligation to retain any employee or group of employees of the
Company or any of the Company Subsidiaries other than as required by
applicable Law or by an employment agreement listed in Section 6.2(a) of the
Company Disclosure Letter.

  



  

(d) For purposes of all employee benefit plans, programs and arrangements
maintained by or contributed to by Parent and any of the Parent Subsidiaries
(including, after the Closing, the Surviving Corporation), Parent shall, or
shall cause the Parent Subsidiaries to, cause each such

  



        
   

  



  

plan, program or arrangement to treat the prior service with the Company and
its affiliates of the Covered Employees immediately prior to the Closing (to
the same extent such service is recognized under analogous plans, programs or
arrangements of the Company or its affiliates prior to the Closing) as
service rendered to Parent or the Parent Subsidiaries, as the case may be,
for purposes of eligibility to participate in and vesting thereunder.
Covered Employees shall also be given credit for any deductible or co-payment
amounts paid in respect of the plan year in which the Closing occurs, to the
extent that, following the Closing, they participate in any other plan for
which deductibles or co-payments are required.  Parent shall also cause each
Employee Benefit Plan maintained by or contributed to by Parent and its
subsidiaries (including, after the Closing, the Surviving Corporation) in
which Covered Employees participate, to waive any preexisting condition that
was waived under the terms of any Company Employee Benefit Plan immediately
prior to the Closing or waiting period limitation that would otherwise be
applicable to a Covered Employee on or after the Closing. Parent shall
recognize any accrued but unused vacation and sick leave of the Covered
Employees as of the Closing Date that has been accrued in accordance with the
terms of such Company policies.

  



  

(e) No provision of this _Section 6.2_ will (i) create or be deemed to
create any third-party beneficiary or other rights in any employee or former
employee (including any beneficiary or dependent thereof) of the Company, any
Company Subsidiary or any other person other than the parties to this
Agreement and their respective successors and permitted assigns, (ii)
constitute or create or be deemed to constitute or create an employment
agreement or (iii) constitute or be deemed to constitute an amendment to any
employee benefit plan sponsored or maintained by Parent, the Company or any
of their respective Subsidiaries.

  



  

(f) Parent agrees to provide any required notice under the WARN Act, and any
similar federal, state, local or foreign Law or regulation, and to otherwise
comply with the WARN Act and any such other similar Law with respect to any
"plant closing" or "mass layoff" (as defined in the WARN Act) or
group termination or similar event affecting Covered Employees (including as
a result of the consummation of the Transactions).

  



  

SECTION 6.3 _Antitrust Filings_. The Company, Parent and Merger Sub
shall each, as promptly as practicable after the date of this Agreement and,
in any event, within ten Business Days of the date hereof (or as otherwise
mutually agreed by the parties in writing), file or cause to be filed with
the FTC and the DOJ all appropriate filings and submissions required by the
U.S. Antitrust Laws and promptly file any additional information requested as
soon as practicable after receipt of such request therefor. The Company,
Parent and Merger Sub shall each, as promptly as practicable after the date
of this Agreement, file or cause to be filed with all applicable non-U.S.
Governmental Authorities all appropriate filings and submissions required by
any applicable antitrust or competition Laws of such non-U.S. Governmental
Authorities.

  



  

SECTION 6.4 _Public Statements_. Subject to _Section 6.8_, the Company,
Parent and Merger Sub shall consult with each other prior to issuing, and
will not issue without the prior written consent of the other party
(which consent will not be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed),
any public announcement, statement or other disclosure with respect to this
Agreement or the Transactions, except that a party may, without the prior
written consent of the other party (but after prior consultation) issue any
public announcement, statement or other disclosure with respect to this
Agreement or the Transactions as may be required by applicable Law, the SEC
or any listing agreement with a national securities exchange or trading
market.

  



        
   

  



  

The Company, Parent and Merger Sub will cooperate to develop all public
communications and make appropriate members of management available at
presentations related to the Transactions as reasonably requested by the
other party.

  



  

SECTION 6.5 _Standard of Effort_.

  



  

(a) Subject to the terms and conditions provided herein, each of the Company,
Parent and Merger Sub agrees to use its reasonable best efforts to take, or
cause to be taken, all action, and to do, or cause to be done, and to assist
and cooperate with the other parties in doing, all things necessary, proper
or advisable under applicable Law to consummate and make effective in the
most expeditious manner practicable, the Offer, the Merger and the
other Transactions, including: (i) obtaining all consents, approvals,
authorizations and actions or non-actions required for or in connection with
the consummation by the parties hereto of the Offer, the Merger and the other
Transactions; (ii) the taking of all steps as may be necessary to obtain an
approval or waiver from, or to avoid an action or proceeding by, a
Governmental Authority; and (iii) the execution and delivery of any
additional instruments necessary to consummate the Transactions and to fully
carry out the purposes of this Agreement. The Company shall have the right to
review and comment upon (to which reasonable and good faith consideration
shall be given) all characterizations of the information relating to the
Company; Parent shall have the right to review and comment upon (to which
reasonable and good faith consideration shall be given) all characterizations
of the information relating to Parent or Merger Sub; and each of the Company
and Parent shall have the right to review and comment upon (to which
reasonable and good faith consideration shall be given) all characterizations
of the information relating to the Transactions, in each case that appear in
any material filing (including the Offer Documents, the Schedule 14D-9, the
Proxy Statement and any filing under U.S. and non-U.S. antitrust Laws or any
state takeover Law) made in connection with the Transactions. The Company,
Parent and Merger Sub agree that they shall consult with each other with
respect to the obtaining of all such necessary permits, consents, approvals
and authorizations of all third parties and Governmental Authorities.
Notwithstanding the foregoing, neither the Company nor the Company Board
shall be restricted from taking any action permitted by _Section 6.8_.

  



  

(b) In furtherance of, and not in limitation of the foregoing, the parties
shall use their respective reasonable best efforts to respond promptly to any
requests for additional information made by the FTC or the DOJ, and to cause
the waiting periods under the HSR Act to terminate or expire at the earliest
possible date after the date of filing. The parties hereto agree not to
extend directly or indirectly any waiting period under the HSR Act or
enter into any agreement with a Governmental Authority to delay or not to
consummate the Offer, the Merger and the other Transactions, except with the
prior written consent of the other parties hereto.  Each of Parent and
Merger Sub, on one hand, and the Company, on the other, shall (x) promptly
notify the other party of any written communication to that party from any
Governmental Authority and, subject to applicable Law, permit the other party
to review in advance any proposed written communication to any such
Governmental Authority, (y) not participate in any substantive meeting or
discussion with any such Governmental Authority in respect of any filing,
investigation or inquiry concerning this Agreement, the Offer, the Merger or
the other Transactions unless it consults with the other party in advance
and, to the extent permitted by such Governmental Authority, gives the other
party the opportunity to attend, and (z) furnish the other party with copies
of all correspondence, filings and written communications between such party
and its affiliates and their respective Representatives on the one hand, and
any such

  



        
   

  



  

Governmental Authority or its staff on the other hand, with respect to this
Agreement, the Offer, the Merger or any of the other Transactions. Each of
Parent and the Company shall use commercially reasonable efforts to avoid
impediments under any antitrust, merger control, competition or trade
regulation Law that may be asserted by any Governmental Authority with
respect to the Offer, the Merger and the other Transactions so as to enable
the Closing to occur as soon as reasonably practicable. If
any administrative or judicial action or proceeding is instituted (or
threatened to be instituted) challenging the Merger or the Transactions as
violative of any antitrust Law, or if any Judgment or Law enacted, entered,
promulgated or enforced by a Governmental Authority that would make the
Offer, the Merger or the other Transactions illegal or would otherwise
prohibit or materially impair or delay the consummation of the Offer, the
Merger or the other Transactions, each of Parent and Merger Sub shall use
such efforts as are commercially reasonable, in Parents sole judgment, to
contest any such action or proceeding. The Company shall cooperate with
Parent and Merger Sub in all respects in Parents and Merger
Subs implementation of any of the measures taken pursuant to the preceding
sentence in order to permit consummation of the Offer, the Merger or the
other Transactions,  _provided_ that neither the Company nor any Company
Subsidiary shall be required pursuant to this _Section 6.5_ to take any
irrevocable action prior to the Closing or enter into any agreement or other
arrangement that does not expressly provide that the Companys obligations
are subject to the prior or simultaneous occurrence of the Closing.

  



  

(c) Parent shall cause Merger Sub to comply with all of Merger
Subs obligations under or related to this Agreement and the Offer, the
Merger and the other Transactions.

  



  

SECTION 6.6 _Notification of Certain Matters_.

  



  

(a) The Company agrees to give prompt notice to Parent and Merger Sub of (i)
any written notice received from any Person alleging that the consent of such
Person is required in connection with the Transactions, (ii) any written
notice from any Governmental Authority in connection with the Transactions,
(iii) any actions, suits, claims, investigations or proceedings commenced or,
to its knowledge, threatened against, relating to or involving or otherwise
affecting the Company or any of its Subsidiaries that, if pending on the date
of this Agreement, would have been required to have been disclosed pursuant
to any Section of this Agreement or that relate to the consummation of the
Transactions, (iv) any inaccuracy of any representation or warranty of the
Company contained in this Agreement at any time during the term hereof that
could reasonably be expected to cause any Offer Condition not to be
satisfied, or (v) any failure of the Company to comply with or satisfy any
covenant, condition or agreement to be complied with or satisfied by it
hereunder if such failure to comply or satisfy could reasonably be expected
to cause any Offer Condition not to be satisfied.

  



  

(b) Each of Parent and Merger Sub agrees to give prompt notice to the Company
of (i) any written notice received from any Person alleging that the consent
of such Person is required in connection with the Transactions, (ii) any
written notice from any Governmental Authority in connection with the
Transactions, (iii) any actions, suits, claims, investigations or proceedings
commenced or, to its knowledge, threatened against, relating to or involving
or otherwise affecting Parent or any of its Subsidiaries that, if pending on
the date of this Agreement, would have been required to have been disclosed
pursuant to any Section of this Agreement or that relate to the consummation
of the Transactions, (iv) any inaccuracy of any representation or warranty of
Parent or Merger Sub contained in this Agreement at any time during the term
hereof

  



         
 

  



  

that could reasonably be expected to cause any Offer Condition not to be
satisfied, or (v) any failure of Parent or Merger Sub to comply with or
satisfy any covenant, condition or agreement to be complied with or satisfied
by it hereunder if such failure to comply or satisfy could reasonably be
expected to cause any Offer Condition not to be satisfied.

  



  

(c) In no event shall the delivery of any notice by a party pursuant to this
_Section 6.6_ limit or otherwise affect the respective rights, obligations,
representations, warranties, covenants or agreements of the parties or the
conditions to the obligations of the parties under this Agreement.

  



  

SECTION 6.7 _Access to Information; Confidentiality_.

  



  

(a) The Company shall, and shall cause the Company Subsidiaries and the
officers, directors, employees and agents of the Company and the
Company Subsidiaries, to, afford the officers, employees and agents of Parent
and Merger Sub, at their sole cost and risk, reasonable access during
normal business hours from the date hereof through the Effective Date (or
earlier termination of this Agreement in accordance with its terms) to its
officers, employees, agents, properties, facilities, books, records,
contracts and other assets and shall furnish Parent and Merger Sub all
financial, operating and other data and information as Parent and Merger Sub
through their officers, employees or agents, may reasonably request.  Parent
and Merger Sub, at their sole cost and risk, shall have the right to make
such due diligence investigations as Parent and Merger Sub shall
deem necessary or reasonable, upon reasonable notice to the Company;
_provided_ , _however_ , that any investigations of the Companys facilities
or any visits or telephonic communications with the Companys customers (to
extent such customers are not also customers of Parent or a Parent
Subsidiary, in which case, the restrictions contained in this sentence shall
not apply to communications regarding the business of Parent or such Parent
Subsidiary) shall be conducted under the supervision of appropriate personnel
of the Company or with the prior consent of the Company (which consent may
cover multiple communications and shall not be unreasonably withheld) and in
a manner as not to unreasonably interfere with or disrupt the normal
operation of the business of the Company. All requests for such access shall
be made to such agents of the Company as the Company may designate, who will
be solely responsible for coordinating all such requests and all
access permitted hereunder. Neither Parent, Merger Sub nor any of their
respective representatives shall contact any of the employees, customers,
landlords, licensors or suppliers of the Company or any Company Subsidiary in
connection with the Transactions, whether in person or by telephone, mail or
other means of communication, without the specific prior written
authorization of such agents of the Company as the Company may designate.
Neither the Company nor any Company Subsidiary will be required to afford
access or disclose information that would jeopardize attorney-client
privilege, contravene any binding agreement with any third party or violate
any Law or regulation. The parties will make reasonable
appropriate substitute arrangements in circumstances where the previous
sentence applies.

  



  

(b) The provisions of the Confidentiality Agreement dated July 30, 2010,
between Parent and the Company (the " _Confidentiality Agreement_ ") shall
remain in full force and effect in accordance with its terms. Except as
otherwise provided herein, if there is a conflict between the terms of the
Confidentiality Agreement and this Agreement, the terms of this Agreement
shall govern.

  



        
   

  



  

SECTION 6.8 _No Solicitation_.

  



  

(a) The Company and each of the Company Subsidiaries shall, and the Company
shall use commercially reasonable efforts to cause its or any of the Company
Subsidiaries Representatives to, immediately cease and cause to
be terminated any existing activities, discussions or negotiations with any
Person or its Representatives conducted heretofore with respect to any
Acquisition Proposal until such time, if any, as this Agreement is terminated
in accordance with its terms. The Company shall promptly request that each
Person, if any, that has executed a confidentiality agreement within the six-
month period prior to the date hereof in connection with its consideration of
any Acquisition Proposal return or destroy all confidential information
heretofore furnished to such Person by or on behalf of the Company or any of
its Subsidiaries (and all analyses and other materials prepared by or on
behalf of such Person that contains, reflects or analyzes that information)
and that (to the extent provided in the terms of the applicable
confidentiality agreement between such Person and the Company) such Person
provide a certificate of such return or destruction to the Company. The
Company shall use commercially reasonable efforts to secure all such
certifications as promptly as practicable.

  



  

(b) From the date hereof until the Closing or the earlier termination of this
Agreement in accordance with its terms, the Company and its Subsidiaries
shall not, and the Company shall use its commercially reasonable efforts to
cause its or any of its Subsidiaries Representatives not to, directly or
indirectly, (i) initiate, solicit or take any action to knowingly facilitate
or knowingly encourage the submission of an Acquisition Proposal, (ii) enter
into, engage or participate in any discussions or negotiations with any
Person concerning an Acquisition Proposal or the making of an Acquisition
Proposal, or (iii) furnish any confidential information relating to the
Company or any of its Subsidiaries to, afford access to the business,
properties, assets, books or records of the Company or any of
its Subsidiaries to, or otherwise cooperate with, assist, facilitate or
encourage any effort, by any Person in connection with an Acquisition
Proposal or inquiries regarding an Acquisition Proposal or the making of an
Acquisition Proposal. The Company agrees that any violation of the
restrictions on the Company set forth in this Section 6.8 by any
Representative of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries shall be a breach of
this Section by the Company.  Notwithstanding the foregoing provisions of
this _Section 6.8(b)_, prior to the Acceptance Date, the Company may furnish
information to, or enter into discussions or negotiations with, any Person
that has made a _bona fide_ , unsolicited, written Acquisition Proposal if,
and only to the extent that: (A) the Company Board and the Special
Committee, after consulting with the Companys and the Special Committees
outside legal and financial advisors, have determined in good faith that such
Acquisition Proposal constitutes a Superior Proposal or is reasonably
expected to result in a Superior Proposal and that the failure to take such
action would be reasonably likely to result in a breach of their fiduciary
duties under applicable Law; (B) such Acquisition Proposal is not the result
of a breach by the Company or its Subsidiaries of this _Section 6.8_ and the
Company and its Subsidiaries are otherwise in compliance with this _Section
6.8_; and (C) prior to furnishing such information or engaging in discussions
or negotiations, the Company receives from such Person an executed
confidentiality agreement (a copy of which shall be provided to Parent) on
terms no less favorable to the Company than those contained in the
Confidentiality Agreement, as determined by counsel to the Company, and all
such information provided or made available to such Person (to the extent
that such information has not been previously provided or made available to
Parent) is provided or made available to Parent, as the case may be, at or
before the time it is provided or made available to such other Person;
_provided, however_ , that the Company may enter into negotiations solely
with respect to entering into such confidentiality agreement with a Person
who has made a

  



        
   

  



  

 _bona fide_ , unsolicited, written Acquisition Proposal without breaching,
or being deemed to breach, this  _Section 6.8_.

  



  

(c) From the date hereof until the Closing or the earlier termination of this
Agreement in accordance with its terms, the Company shall notify Parent in
writing within one Business Day following receipt by the Company of any
Acquisition Proposal, any inquiry with respect to an Acquisition Proposal, or
request for access to information or the properties, books or records of the
Company or any Subsidiary by any Person that informs the Company or such
Subsidiary that it is considering making, or has made, an
Acquisition Proposal. The written notice shall include all material terms
and conditions of the Acquisition Proposal or such inquiry or request
(including the identity of the Person making such Acquisition Proposal,
inquiry or request), and, if in writing, shall include a copy of such
Acquisition Proposal, inquiry or request. The Company shall keep Parent
reasonably apprised of any material modification of or amendment to such
Acquisition Proposal, inquiry or request and of any developments, discussions
and negotiations with respect to such Acquisition Proposal, inquiry or
request. The Company shall provide Parent as soon as reasonably practicable
(but in no event later than one Business Day) after receipt thereof with
copies of all correspondence and other written material sent or provided to
the Company from any Person in connection with such Acquisition Proposal,
inquiry or request.

  



  

(d) Nothing contained in this _Section 6.8_ prohibits or will be construed
as prohibiting the Company or the Company Board from (i) taking and
disclosing to the Companys stockholders a position contemplated by Rule
14e-2(a) promulgated under the Exchange Act or (ii) making any disclosure to
the Companys stockholders if, in the good faith judgment of the Company
Board, after consultation with outside counsel, failure to make such
disclosure would be inconsistent with applicable Law.

  



  

(e) From the date hereof until the Closing or the earlier termination of this
Agreement in accordance with its terms, neither the Company Board nor the
Special Committee thereof shall (i) approve or recommend, or fail to
recommend rejection of, any Acquisition Proposal, (ii) fail to make,
withdraw, modify or amend in a manner adverse to Parent or Merger Sub
(or publicly propose to withdraw, modify or amend in a manner adverse to
Parent or Merger Sub) the Company Board Recommendation, or otherwise take any
action or make any public statement inconsistent with, the Company Board
Recommendation (any of the foregoing in clause (i) of this Section 6.8(e)
or this clause (ii), an " _Adverse Recommendation Change_ "), (iii) cause or
permit the Company to enter into any letter of intent, agreement in
principle, term sheet, acquisition agreement, option agreement or similar
agreement with respect to any Acquisition Proposal, (iv) grant any waiver or
release under any standstill or similar agreement with respect to any class
of equity securities of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries or under the
Rights Agreement, (v) take any action to render the restrictions on business
combinations set forth in Section 203 of the DGCL inapplicable to any
transaction (other than the Transactions), or (vi) cooperate with any Person
other than Parent or Merger Sub with respect to the preparation and filing of
documents under Ohio Revised Code Section 1707.041. Notwithstanding the
foregoing provisions of this _Section 6.8(e)_, the Company Board may make an
Adverse Recommendation Change if the Company Board and the Special Committee
have concluded in good faith, after consultation with the Companys and
Special Committees outside financial and legal advisors, that failure of the
Company Board to effect such Adverse Recommendation Change would be
reasonably likely to result in a breach of their fiduciary duties under
applicable Law.

  



        
   

  



  

(f) Neither the Company Board nor the Special Committee shall make an
Adverse Recommendation Change or cause the Company to exercise its right to
terminate this Agreement pursuant to _Section 8.1(e)(ii)_ unless: (i) the
Company promptly ( _i.e._ , within one Business Day) after a meeting of
the Company Board and a meeting of the Special Committee provides written
notice _(_ " _Notice of Adverse Recommendation_ ") advising Parent that the
Company Board and the Special Committee intend to take any such action and
specifying the reasons therefor, including, if applicable, (A) the material
terms and conditions of a Superior Proposal, (B) the identity of the Person
making such Superior Proposal and (C) the terms and conditions of any
proposed agreement relating to such Superior Proposal; (ii) during a period
commencing on the date that the Notice of Adverse Recommendation is deemed to
be received by Parent in accordance with _Section 9.1_ and ending at 5:00
p.m., Eastern Time, on the third Business Day thereafter (such three-Business
Day period, the " _Notice Period_ "), the Company supplies all information
requested by Parent, otherwise cooperates and negotiates exclusively with
Parent in good faith to make such adjustments to the terms and conditions of
this Agreement as would enable the Company to proceed with the Company Board
Recommendation and not make such Adverse Recommendation Change; (iii)
following expiration of the Notice Period, the Company Board and the Special
Committee, after consultation with the Companys and Special Committees
outside financial and legal advisors, determine in good faith (after taking
into account any adjustments to the terms and conditions of this Agreement)
that failure of the Company Board to effect such Adverse Recommendation
Change would be reasonably likely to result in a breach of their fiduciary
duties under applicable Law; and (iv) if required by the terms of _Section
8.3(a)_, the Company has paid to Parent the fee described in _Section
8.3(a)_. Any modification to the terms and conditions of a Superior Proposal,
if any, or a proposed agreement, if any, relating to such Superior Proposal
from those described in a Notice of Adverse Recommendation shall require the
Company to deliver a new Notice of Adverse Recommendation and shall trigger a
new Notice Period commencing on the date that the new Notice of Adverse
Recommendation is received by Parent.

  



  

SECTION 6.9 _Indemnification and Insurance_.

  



  

(a) For six years after the Effective Time, Parent shall cause the Surviving
Corporation to, and Surviving Corporation shall, maintain in effect the
provisions in the Surviving Corporations certificate of incorporation
and by-laws regarding the elimination of liability of directors,
indemnification of directors, officers, employees or agents of the Company
and its Subsidiaries, or any of them who act as a fiduciary under any of the
Company Employee Benefit Plans, and advancement of expenses that are no less
advantageous to the intended beneficiaries than the corresponding provisions
in the Companys Second Amended and Restated Certificate of Incorporation and
the Companys Amended and Restated By-laws in existence on the date of this
Agreement. Parent shall cause the Surviving Corporation to, and Surviving
Corporation shall, fulfill its obligations under the indemnification
agreements listed in Section 6.9(a) of the Company Disclosure Letter and all
rights set forth in such agreements shall survive the Merger and shall not be
amended, repealed or otherwise modified in any manner that would adversely
affect the rights thereunder of the other party to such agreement, unless
such party affected thereby otherwise consents in writing thereto.

  



  

(b) For six years after the Effective Time, Parent shall cause the Surviving
Corporation to, and Surviving Corporation shall, defend and hold harmless
each current or former director and officer of the Company (each, an "
_Indemnified Party_ ") from and against all costs and expenses

  



        
   

  



  

(including reasonable attorneys fees and costs of investigation), losses,
claims, damages, liabilities, judgments and fines as incurred, in connection
with any claim, action, suit, proceeding or investigation, whether civil,
criminal, administrative or investigative, arising out of actions or
omissions before or at the Effective Time (including as to, or arising out of
or pertaining to, the Transactions and this Agreement), to the fullest extent
permitted by the DGCL, subject to any provisions in the Companys Second
Amended and Restated Certificate of Incorporation and the Companys Amended
and Restated By-laws in effect on the date hereof; _provided_ that
such indemnification shall be subject to any limitation imposed from time to
time under applicable Law. Parent shall cause Surviving Corporation to pay
all such costs and expenses promptly as statements therefor are received to
the extent permitted by, and in conformity with, the DGCL and the applicable
provisions of the Companys Second Amended and Restated Certificate of

(c) For a period of six years after the Effective Time, Parent shall cause
the Surviving Corporation to, and Surviving Corporation shall, maintain the
Companys officers and directors liability insurance policy, in effect on
the date hereof and described in Section 6.9(c) of the Company Disclosure
Letter (the " _D andO Insurance_"), in respect of acts or omissions occurring
at or prior to the Effective Time covering each such person covered at or
prior to the Effective Time by such officers and directors liability
insurance policy; _provided_  that, in no event shall Parent or the Surviving
Corporation be required to expend for such policies pursuant to this sentence
an annual premium amount in excess of 200% of the amount per annum the
Company paid in its last full fiscal year, which amount is set forth in
Section 6.9(c) of the Company Disclosure Letter; and _provided further_
 that, if the aggregate premiums of such insurance coverage exceed such
amount, the Surviving Corporation shall be obligated to obtain a policy with
the greatest coverage available, with respect to matters occurring prior to
the Effective Time, for a cost not exceeding such amount. Parent shall have
the right to cause coverage to be extended under the DandO Insurance by
obtaining a six-year tail policy on terms and conditions no less advantageous

of this _Section 6.9(c)_.

  



  

(d) The obligations of Parent and the Surviving Corporation under this

the consent of such affected Indemnified Party.  This _Section 6.9_ is
intended for the benefit of, and shall be enforceable by, the Indemnified
Parties referred to herein, their heirs and personal representatives and
shall be binding on the Surviving Corporation and its successors and assigns.

  



  

(e) If Parent or the Surviving Corporation or any of their respective
successors or assigns (i) consolidates with or merges into any other Person
and shall not be the continuing or surviving corporation or entity of such
consolidation or merger or (ii) transfers all or substantially all of its
properties and assets to any Person, then, and in each such case,
proper provision shall be made so that the successors and assigns of Parent
or the Surviving Corporation, as the case may be, shall assume the
obligations set forth in this _Section 6.9_.

  



  

(f) Parent shall cause Surviving Corporation to, and Surviving Corporation
shall, pay all reasonable expenses, including reasonable attorneys fees and
costs of investigation, that may be incurred by any Indemnified Party in
enforcing Parent or Surviving Corporations obligations set forth in this
_Section 6.9,_ subject to the DGCL and the applicable provisions of the

Sub representation on the Company Board equal to at least that number of
directors, rounded up to the next whole number, that is the product of (a)
the total number of directors on the Company Board (giving effect to the
directors elected pursuant to this sentence) multiplied by (b) the percentage
that (i) the number of Shares beneficially owned (as such term is defined in
Rule 13d-3 promulgated under the Exchange Act) by Parent and Merger Sub bears
to (ii) the total number of Shares that are then issued and outstanding, and
the Company shall, at such time, use its reasonable best efforts to cause
Merger Subs designees to be so elected or appointed (in furtherance of the
foregoing, if requested by Parent or Merger Sub after the Acceptance Time but
prior to the Effective Time, the Company shall use its reasonable best
efforts to cause (x) a corresponding increase in the size of the Company
Board and/or (y) a corresponding number of directors of the Company to tender
their resignations as directors, effective as of date of such request, and to
deliver to Parent written evidence of such resignations).  At such time, the
Company shall also, upon request of Parent, cause such persons designated by
Parent to constitute at least the same percentage (rounded up to the nearest
whole number) as is on the Company Board on (i) each committee of the Company
Board, subject to compliance with applicable securities Laws and Amex rules,
and (ii) each board of directors (or similar body) of each Company Subsidiary
and each committee of such board (or similar body); _provided_ that with
respect to the board of directors (or similar body) of the Company
Subsidiaries domiciled outside of the U.S. the Company shall use its
reasonable best efforts to cause such persons designated by Parent to
constitute at least the same percentage (rounded up to the nearest whole
number) as is on the Company Board.

  



  

(b) The Companys obligations to appoint designees to the Company Board shall
be subject to Section 14(f) of the Exchange Act and Rule 14f-l promulgated
thereunder.  The Company shall promptly use its reasonable best efforts to
take all actions required pursuant to Section 14(f) and Rule 14f-l in order
to fulfill its obligations under this _Section 6.11_ and shall include in
the Schedule 14D-9 such information with respect to the Company and its
officers and directors as is required under Section 14(f) and Rule 14f-l to
fulfill its obligations under this _Section 6.11_. Parent or Merger Sub shall
supply to the Company in writing and be solely responsible for any
information with respect to either of them and their respective nominees,
officers, directors and affiliates required by Section 14(f) and Rule 14f-1.

of the directors of the Company then in office who were not designated by
Parent or Merger Sub shall be required, in each case, for: (i) any amendment
or termination of this Agreement by the Company; (ii) any extension of
time by the Company for performance of any obligation or action hereunder by
Parent or Merger Sub; (iii) any waiver or exercise of any of the Companys

practicable following the date hereof, the Company shall use its reasonable
best efforts to cause each issued and outstanding Option and each unvested
share of Restricted Stock granted under the Stock Plans to be amended to
permit the cancellation of such Options and the payment of the Cash Amount
under _Section 2.9(a)_ and the vesting and cancellation of such Restricted
Stock and the payment of the Merger Consideration under _Section 2.9(b)_, at
the Effective Time, to the extent such Options and Restricted Stock do not
permit such treatment; provided, however, that in no event shall the Company
provide any benefit or consideration to the holder of any such Option or
Restricted Stock in obtaining such amendment or take any other action
prohibited in connection with the transactions contemplated by this Agreement
under Rule 14d-10 promulgated under the Exchange Act.

other in taking, or causing to be taken, all actions necessary to delist the

restricting, preventing or prohibiting consummation of the Transactions.

  



  

(c) _Acceptance of Shares_.  Merger Sub shall have accepted for payment all
Shares properly tendered and not withdrawn pursuant to the Offer; _provided_

the terms of the Offer or of this Agreement.

  



  

 **ARTICLE 8: 
 TERMINATION**

  



  

SECTION 8.1 _Termination_. This Agreement may be terminated at any time prior

Agreement by the stockholders of the Company, the Transactions may
be abandoned for any reason provided in paragraphs (a) through (e) below;

vote of the directors of the Company not designated by Parent or Merger Sub

Company:

  



  

(a) by mutual written consent of Parent (on behalf of itself and Merger Sub)

withdrawn pursuant to its terms and the terms of this Agreement prior to the
Acceptance Time; _provided_ ,  _however_ , that the right to terminate this
Agreement under either clause of this _Section 8.1(b)_ shall not be
available to any party whose breach of any obligation under this Agreement
has been the cause of, or resulted in, the event specified in such clause;

  



  

(c) by either the Company or Parent, if any Judgment issued by a court of
competent jurisdiction or by a Governmental Authority makes, or any Law or
other legal restraint or prohibition making, the Merger illegal or otherwise
prevents the consummation thereof shall be in effect and shall have become
final and nonappealable; _provided_ that the right to terminate this
Agreement pursuant to this _Section 8.1(c)_ shall not be available to any
party which has not complied with its obligations under  _Section 6.5_;

  



  

(d) by Parent prior to the Acceptance Time, if:

  



  

(i) (A) an Adverse Recommendation Change shall have occurred or, at any time
after receipt or public announcement of an Acquisition Proposal, the Company
Board shall have failed to reaffirm the Company Board Recommendation as
promptly as practicable (but in any event within five Business Days) after
receipt of any written request to do so from Parent; or (B) the Company Board
shall have resolved to make an Adverse Recommendation Change;

  



  

(ii) there shall have been an intentional and material breach of _Section
6.8_; or

  



  

(iii) the Company shall have breached or failed to perform any of
its representations, warranties, covenants or other agreements contained in
this Agreement, which breach or failure to perform (A) has given rise to
the failure of a condition set forth in paragraph (a), (c) or (d) of
the Offer Conditions and (B) is incapable of being cured or has not been
cured by the Company within 20 Business Days after written notice has been
given by Parent to the Company of such breach or failure to perform; or

  



  

(e) by the Company,

  



  

(i) if Parent or Merger Sub fails to commence the Offer as provided in
_Section 1.1 _as a result of an intentional and material breach by Parent or
Merger Sub of the covenants contained in this Agreement; _provided_  that
the right to terminate this Agreement pursuant to this _Section 8.1(e)(i)_
shall not be available to the Company unless, as of the date of termination,
the Company has complied with its obligations contained in _Article 1_
of this Agreement and the representations and warranties of the Company
contained in _Section 3.8_ of this Agreement are true and correct in
all material respects; or

  



  

(ii) at any time prior to the Acceptance Time, in order for the Company to
enter into a definitive agreement with respect to a transaction
that constitutes a Superior Proposal after having complied in full with its
obligations under _Section 6.8_ if, concurrently with such termination,
the Company pays the Termination Fee to Parent in accordance with _Section
8.3(a)_; or

  



  

(iii) if Parent shall have breached or failed to perform in any material
respect any of its representations, warranties, covenants or other agreements
contained in this Agreement, which breach or failure to perform is incapable
of being cured or has not been cured by

  



        
   

  



  

Parent within 20 Business Days after written notice has been given by the
Company to Parent of such breach or failure to perform.

  



  

The party desiring to terminate this Agreement shall give written notice of
such termination to the other parties.

  



  

SECTION 8.2 _Effect of Termination_. Upon the termination of this
Agreement pursuant to _Section 8.1_, this Agreement shall forthwith become
null and void except for the provisions of (i) _Section 8.3_, (ii)
_Section 6.6(c)_, (iii) _Section 6.7(b)_ and (iv) Article 9, which shall
survive such termination; _provided_ that nothing herein shall relieve any
party from liability for any material breach of a covenant of this Agreement
for any and all liabilities and damages incurred or suffered by the other
parties as a result of such breach. Without limiting the generality of
the foregoing, any failure of Parent and Merger Sub to satisfy the
payment obligations hereunder following the Acceptance Time or the Effective
Time, as applicable, will constitute a material breach of a covenant of this
Agreement.

  



  

SECTION 8.3 _Fees_.

  



  

(a) The Company shall pay to Parent or its designated affiliate a fee in
immediately available funds in the amount of $14,500,000 (the " _Termination
Fee_ ") if:

  



  

(i) this Agreement is terminated by Parent pursuant to _Section 8.1(d)(i)_
or  _Section 8.1(d)(ii)_, in which case the Termination Fee shall
be payable within two Business Days of such termination;

  



  

(ii) this Agreement is terminated by the Company pursuant to _Section
8.1(e)(ii)_, in which case the Termination Fee shall be payable at the time
of termination; or

  



  

(iii) (A) this Agreement is terminated by Parent or the Company pursuant to
_Section 8.1(b)_ and prior to such termination, all Offer Conditions other
than the Minimum Tender Condition have been satisfied or waived, (B) the
event giving rise to the right to terminate occurred at any time after an
Acquisition Proposal (with 50% being substituted for references to 25% in the
definition thereof for the purposes of this _Section 8.3(a)(iii)_) had been
publicly made (other than by Parent or its affiliates) and (C) within twelve
months following the date of such termination, the Company shall have entered
into a definitive agreement with respect to, or recommended to
its stockholders, an Acquisition Proposal, or an Acquisition Proposal
shall otherwise have been consummated, in which case, the Termination Fee
shall be payable on the date of such event or action.

  



  

(b) The Company acknowledges that the Termination Fee and this _Section
8.3_ are an integral part of the Transactions and that, without these
agreements, Parent and Merger Sub would not enter into this Agreement.
Accordingly, if the Company fails promptly to pay any amount due to Parent
pursuant to this _Section 8.3_, it shall also pay any costs and expenses
incurred by Parent or Merger Sub in connection with a legal action to enforce
this Agreement that results in a judgment against the Company for such
amount, together with interest on the amount of any unpaid fee, cost or
expense at the publicly announced prime rate of Citibank, N.A. from the date
such fee, cost or expense was required to be paid to (but excluding) the
payment date.

  



         
 

  



  

(c) Unless the Company has intentionally and materially breached its
obligations contained in _Section 6.8_ and this Agreement has been
terminated in accordance with _Section 8.1(e)(ii)_ (in which case, Parent
and Merger Sub shall reserve all rights), (i) Parents receipt of the
Termination Fee (and, if applicable, any amounts payable pursuant to _Section
8.3(b)_) from the Company shall be the sole and exclusive remedy of Parent
and Merger Sub against the Company and its Subsidiaries and any of their
respective Representatives for the loss suffered as a result of the failure
of the Offer or Merger to be consummated under circumstances giving rise to
an obligation of the Company to pay the Termination Fee and (ii) upon payment
of such Termination Fee (and, if applicable, any amounts payable pursuant to
_Section 8.3(b)_), none of the Company, any of its Subsidiaries or any of
their respective former, current or future Representatives shall have any
further liability or obligation relating to or arising out of this Agreement
or the Transactions.

(collectively, the " _Payment Rules_ "), to pay for any Shares tendered
pursuant to the Offer, and may terminate or amend the Offer, in accordance
with and subject to the terms of this Agreement, unless, prior to the
expiration of the Offer:

  



  

(1) there shall have been validly tendered and not withdrawn that number of

(3) any applicable waiting period under the HSR Act applicable to the
purchase of Shares pursuant to the Offer shall have expired or been
terminated; and

  



  

(4) any approval or consent of any Governmental Authority that is necessary
for the Transactions to be consummated in accordance with the terms of this
Agreement, or any relevant material statutory, regulatory or other
governmental waiting periods, whether domestic, foreign or supranational,
shall have been obtained or be in full force and effect or shall have
expired, as applicable.

  



  

Furthermore, notwithstanding any other term of the Offer or this Agreement,
Merger Sub shall not be required to accept for payment or, subject to the
Payment Rules, to pay for any Shares tendered pursuant to the Offer, and may
terminate or amend the Offer, in accordance with and subject to the terms of
this Agreement if, at the then effective expiration date for the Offer, any
of the following conditions exists:

  



  

(a) any Judgment issued by a court of competent jurisdiction or by a
Governmental Authority shall be in effect, or any action or proceeding by any
Governmental Authority shall be pending, or any Law or any other legal
restraint or prohibition shall be in effect, in each case, that would make
the Offer or the Merger illegal or otherwise prevent the consummation
thereof;

  



  

(b) since the date of this Agreement, there shall have occurred any event,
change, effect or occurrence which, individually or in the aggregate, has had
or would be reasonably expected to have a Company Material Adverse Effect;

  



  

(c) (1) any of the representations and warranties of the Company contained in
_Section 3.2_ shall not be true in all respects (other than such
inaccuracies as are _de minimis_ to the equity capitalization of the Company

Offer as if made at and as of such time, (2) any of the

  



        
   

  



  

representations and warranties of the Company contained in any of _Section
3.1_,  _Section 3.3_, or _Section 3.20_ or _Section 3.21_ shall not be
true in all material respects at and as of immediately prior to the
expiration of the Offer as if made at and as of such time (other than
any such representation and warranty that, by its terms, addresses matters
only as of another specified time, which shall be true only as of such time),
and (3) any of the other representations and warranties of the Company set
forth in this Agreement shall not be true and correct in all respects in each
case at and as of the date of this Agreement and at and as of the Acceptance
Date as though made at and as of the Acceptance Date (except to the extent
expressly made as of an earlier date, in which case solely as of such date),
interpreted without giving effect to the words "materially" or "material" or
to any qualification based on such terms or based on the defined term
"Company Material Adverse Effect," except where the failure of all such
representations and warranties to be true and correct has not had and would
not reasonably be expected to have a Company Material Adverse Effect;

  



  

(d) the Company shall have breached or failed to perform or comply with, in
any material respect, any of its agreements, obligations or covenants under
this Agreement;

  



  

(e) the Company and Merger Sub shall have agreed in writing that Merger Sub

thereunder; or

The foregoing conditions are for the sole benefit of Parent and Merger Sub
and, other than the Minimum Tender Condition, may be waived by Parent or
Merger Sub in whole or in part at any time and from time to time in its
sole discretion. The failure by Parent, Merger Sub or any other affiliate of
Parent at any time to exercise any of the foregoing rights shall not be
deemed a waiver of any such right, the waiver of any such right with respect
to particular facts and circumstances shall not be deemed a waiver with
respect to any other facts and circumstances and each such right shall be
deemed an ongoing right that may be asserted at any time and from time to
time.
