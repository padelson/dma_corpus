assign, transfer and deliver to Buyer good and valid title to all of the
Shares held by such Stockholder as of immediately prior to the Closing, free
and clear of all Liens, and with the benefit of all rights of whatsoever
nature attaching or accruing to such Shares (the "Share Purchase"), and (b)
each Optionholder shall surrender the Options held by such Optionholder for
cancellation. As soon as reasonably practicable after the Closing (and in any
event on the Closing Date) Buyer shall pay and deliver, or cause to be paid
and delivered, the Purchase Price to, or for the benefit of, the Sellers.



2.2 Purchase Price.



(a)Subject to the adjustments set forth in Section 2.3, in full consideration
for the transfer of the Shares and the surrender of the Options, Buyer shall
pay or cause to be paid to, or for the benefit of, the Sellers at the Closing
an aggregate amount equal to $116,500,000 plus the Estimated Cash minus:



(i)the aggregate amount of the Estimated Company Debt outstanding immediately
prior to the Closing;

(ii)the unpaid portion, as of the Closing, of the Estimated Selling Expenses;

(iii)the Indemnity Escrow Funds; and

(iv)the Holdback Amount;

(such amount, the "Initial Purchase Price"), increased by (A) any Working
Capital Overage or decreased by (B) any Working Capital Underage (as adjusted,
the "Purchase Price").

(b)Shares and Options. In accordance with Section 2.1, the Purchase Price will
be distributed to, or for the benefit of, the Sellers as follows:

(i)Each Stockholder will be entitled to receive an amount equal to the product
of: (A) the Share Amount; and (B) the number of Shares owned by such
Stockholder, payable in cash by bank wire transfer of immediately available
funds to an account or accounts designated in the Spreadsheet.

(ii)Each Option shall be cancelled at the Closing, and each Optionholder will
be entitled to receive, upon the cancellation of his or her then outstanding
Options, an amount equal to the product of: (A) the Share Amount; and (B) the
number of shares of Common Stock underlying such Options held by such
Optionholder at the Closing, minus the product of: (1) the exercise price of
each Option held by such Optionholder; and (2) the number of Options held by
such Optionholder at each such exercise price (the aggregate amount payable to
all Optionholders is referred to as the "Option Consideration"). Buyer shall
pay, or shall cause one or more of its Affiliated entities to pay, the Option
Consideration to the applicable Optionholders (less applicable withholding) as
promptly as practicable after the Closing, but in no event later than 21 days
following the Closing Date, through the payroll of the Company or the

take all necessary or appropriate action in accordance with the Option Plan to
effectuate the cancellation of the Options as contemplated by this Section
2.2(b)(ii). For the avoidance of doubt, in no event shall any acceleration of
any vesting of any Options increase the amount payable by Buyer hereunder.



(c)Other Settlements. At the Closing and subject to the Company's compliance
with Section 7.10 and Section 7.11, Buyer shall: (i) on behalf of the Company
and the Subsidiary, cause the Company Debt outstanding immediately prior to
the Closing to be repaid in full to the lender or other payee entitled thereto

(collectively, the "Settlement Amounts").



(d)Spreadsheet. At least two Business Days prior to the Closing Date, the
Company shall deliver to Buyer the Spreadsheet. The Company shall reasonably
consider any comments to the Spreadsheet made by Buyer prior to the Closing
Date (it being understood that any such comments, or lack thereof, whether or
not reflected in the Spreadsheet, shall not diminish or otherwise affect
Buyer's remedies hereunder if the Spreadsheet is not accurate).



2.3 Purchase Price Adjustment



(a) Estimated Statement. No later than two Business Days prior to the Closing
Date, the Seller Representative shall prepare and deliver, or cause to be
prepared and delivered, to Buyer, in writing, a good faith estimate of: (i)
the Net Working Capital as of the Closing prepared in accordance with the
principles set forth on Schedule 2.3(a) (such estimate, the "Estimated Working
Capital"); (ii) the Estimated Cash; (iii) the Estimated Company Debt and (iv)
the Estimated Selling Expenses (the "Estimated Closing Statement"). As
contemplated by Section 2.2(a), if the Estimated Working Capital is less than
the Target Working Capital, then the Initial Purchase Price will be reduced by
the amount of such shortfall (the "Working Capital Underage"), subject to
further adjustment as provided in this Section 2.3. As contemplated by Section
2.2(a), if the Estimated Working Capital is greater than the Target Working
Capital, then the Initial Purchase Price will be increased by the amount of
such excess (the "Working Capital Overage"), subject to further adjustment as
provided in this Section 2.3. If the Estimated Working Capital is equal to the
Target Working Capital, then the Initial Purchase Price will not be adjusted
pursuant to this Section 2.3(a), but will be subject to adjustment as
otherwise provided in this Article II. Buyer shall have the right to review
the Estimated Closing Statement and such supporting documentation or data of
the Company as Buyer may reasonably request and to discuss the Estimated
Closing Statement with the Company; provided, however, that the failure to
include in the Estimated Closing Statement any changes proposed by Buyer, or
the acceptance by Buyer of the Estimated Closing Statement, or the
consummation of the Closing, shall not limit or otherwise affect Buyer's
remedies under this Agreement, including Buyer's right to include such changes
or other changes in the Closing Statement, or constitute an acknowledgment by
Buyer of the accuracy of the Estimated Closing Statement.



(b) Closing Statement. Within 60 days after the Closing Date, Buyer shall
prepare and deliver, or cause to be prepared and delivered, to the Seller
Representative a statement (the "Closing Statement"), setting forth: (i) the
Net Working Capital as of the Closing, prepared in accordance with the
principles set forth on Schedule 2.3(a) (the "Final Working Capital"); (ii)
the Cash and Cash Equivalents as of the Closing (the "Final Cash"); (iii) the
Company Debt outstanding as of the Closing (the "Final Company Debt"); and
(iv) the Selling Expenses outstanding as of the Closing (the "Final Selling
Expenses").



(c) Dispute. Within 60 days following receipt by the Seller Representative of
the Closing Statement, the Seller Representative shall deliver written notice
to Buyer of any dispute it has with respect to the preparation or content of
the Closing Statement, which shall specifically describe the basis of the
Seller Representative's dispute, determination and corresponding adjustments
to the Final Working Capital, Final Cash, Final Company Debt and/or Final
Selling Expenses (the "Notice of Disagreement"). If the Seller Representative
does not timely deliver to Buyer the Notice of Disagreement, then such Closing
Statement will be final, conclusive and binding on the parties hereto. In the
event the Notice of Disagreement is timely delivered to Buyer, Buyer and the
Seller Representative shall, for a period of 15 days thereafter, negotiate in
good faith to resolve the disputes set forth in the Notice of Disagreement. If
Buyer and the Seller Representative, notwithstanding such good faith effort,
fail to resolve all of the disputes set forth in the Notice of Disagreement
during such 15-day period, then Buyer and the Seller Representative jointly
shall engage a mutually-agreed upon (which agreement shall not be unreasonably
withheld) "big-four" accounting firm (the "Arbitration Firm"). As promptly as
practicable thereafter (but in any event, within 15 days of engaging the
Arbitration Firm), Buyer and the Seller Representative shall each prepare and
submit a presentation to the Arbitration Firm. The Arbitration Firm shall
consider only those items and amounts in the Seller Representative's and
Buyer's respective calculations that are identified as being items and amounts
to which the Seller Representative and Buyer have been unable to agree. Buyer
and the Seller Representative shall make readily available to the Arbitration
Firm all relevant books and records and any work papers (including those of
the parties' respective accountants, to the extent permitted by such
accountants) relating to the Closing Statement and the Notice of Disagreement
and all other items reasonably requested by the Arbitration Firm in connection
therewith. The Arbitration Firm shall have the opportunity to present written
questions to Buyer and/or the Seller Representative, a copy of which shall be
provided to the other. 

As soon as practicable thereafter, Buyer and the Seller Representative will
cause the Arbitration Firm to choose one of the parties' positions. The party
whose position is not accepted by the Arbitration Firm shall be responsible
for all of the fees and expenses of the Arbitration Firm. All determinations
made by the Arbitration Firm will be final, conclusive and binding on the
parties, absent manifest error.



(d) Access. For purposes of complying with the terms set forth in this Section
2.3, Buyer and the Company, on the one hand, and the Seller Representative, on
the other hand, shall, and the Company shall cause the Subsidiary to,
cooperate with and make available to each other and their respective
representatives all information, records and data, and shall permit access to
its personnel, as may be reasonably required and as is reasonably requested in
connection with the preparation and analysis of the Closing Statement, the
Notice of Disagreement and the resolution of any disputes thereunder. The
Seller Representative shall treat, and shall cause its legal and financial
advisors to treat, confidentially and not disclose to anyone (other than its
legal and financial advisors or the Arbitration Firm in accordance with
Section 2.3(c)) any nonpublic information from or about Buyer, the Company,
the Subsidiary or their respective Affiliates or any of the books, records or
other information so made available pursuant to this Section 2.3(d).



(e)Adjustment. Within two Business Days after the date on which the Final
Working Capital, Final Cash, Final Company Debt and Final Selling Expenses are
finally determined pursuant to Section 2.3(c), the Initial Purchase Price
shall be recalculated using the Final Working Capital, Final Cash, Final
Company Debt and Final Selling Expenses (each as finally determined pursuant
to Section 2.3(c)) in lieu of the Estimated Working Capital, Estimated Cash,
the Estimated Company Debt and the Estimated Selling Expenses, respectively,
as of the Closing.



(i)If such substitutions would have resulted in a Purchase Price that is less
than the Purchase Price that was paid on the Closing Date, then each Seller
shall pay to Buyer, by wire transfer of immediately available funds, within
five Business Days from the date on which the Final Working Capital, Final
Cash, Final Company Debt and Final Selling Expenses are finally determined
pursuant hereto, such Seller's Pro Rata Share of such shortfall.



(ii)If such substitutions would have resulted in a Purchase Price that is
greater than the Purchase Price that was paid on the Closing Date, then Buyer
shall pay, or cause to be paid, to the Sellers in the proportions set forth on
Schedule 2.3(e)(ii), an amount in cash equal to such excess (less the employer
portion of any applicable social security, Medicare, unemployment or other
employment, withholding or payroll Tax or similar amount owed by or imposed
upon Buyer (or any of its Affiliated entities) as a result of or with respect
to or attributable to, any such payment to the extent such Tax or similar
amount would constitute Selling Expenses). With respect to the Stockholders or
former non-employee holders of Options, such amounts shall be paid by Buyer
within five Business Days from the date on which the Final Working Capital,
Final Cash, Final Company Debt and Final Selling Expenses are finally
determined pursuant to Section 2.3(c) by bank wire transfer of immediately
available funds to the accounts designated in writing by the Seller
Representative to Buyer. With respect to the Optionholders (other than to
former non-employee holders of Options), such amounts shall be paid by Buyer,
or Buyer shall cause one or more of its Affiliated entities to pay, to such
Optionholders (less applicable withholding Taxes) as promptly thereafter as
practicable, but in no event later than 21 days following, the date on which
the Final Working Capital, Final Cash, Final Company Debt and Final Selling
Expenses are finally determined pursuant to Section 2.3(c), through the
payroll of Buyer or its Affiliated entities.



(iii)If such substitutions would have resulted in a Purchase Price that is
equal to the Purchase Price that was paid on the Closing Date, then there will
be no adjustment to Purchase Price pursuant to this Section 2.3(e).



(iv)Any amounts paid pursuant to the provisions of this Section 2.3 shall be
deemed to be and treated, to the extent permitted by Law, as an adjustment to
the Purchase Price for all purposes.



2.4 Withholding. Buyer, the Company and their agents shall be entitled to
deduct and withhold from any amount deliverable under this Agreement, and from
any other payments otherwise required pursuant to this Agreement, to any
Person that is required to deducted and withheld with respect to any such
deliveries and payments under the Code or any provision of state, local,
provincial or foreign Law; provided, however, if Buyer determines 

that an amount is required to be deducted and withheld with respect to any
amounts payable (other than as compensation), Buyer shall provide the Seller
Representative with notice of its intent to deduct and withhold and Buyer
shall reasonably cooperate with the Seller Representative to eliminate or
reduce the basis for such deduction or withholding (including providing the
Seller Representative with a reasonable opportunity to provide forms or other
evidence that would exempt such amounts from withholding). To the extent that
amounts are so withheld and paid over to or credited by the applicable Tax
Authority, such withheld amounts shall be treated for all purposes of this
Agreement as having been delivered and paid to such holders in respect of
which such deduction and withholding was made; provided, however, Buyer shall
be responsible for any penalties and interest imposed as a result of Buyer
failing to timely pay any such amounts (or have credited) to the applicable
Tax Authority on a timely basis.

shares of Common Stock of the Company subject to each Option, the "date of
grant" of such Option, and the exercise price per share. In addition, Schedule

period then ended (the "Interim Financial Statements" and, collectively with
the Audited Financial Statements, the "Company Financial Statements").



(b) The Audited Financial Statements (i) have been prepared in accordance with
GAAP in all material respects and applied on a consistent basis throughout the
periods involved and (ii) fairly present, in all material respects, the
financial position, and results of operations, stockholders' equity, and cash
flows of the Company and the Subsidiary, on a consolidated basis, as of the
dates and for the periods indicated. Except as set forth on Schedule 4.5(b),
the Interim Financial Statements (x) have been prepared by management of the
Company in accordance with GAAP in all material respects and applied on a
consistent basis throughout the periods involved (except for the absence of
footnote disclosure and any year‑end adjustments in the ordinary course
consistent with past practice) and (y) fairly and accurately present, in all
material respects, the financial position and results of operations of the
Company and the Subsidiary, on a consolidated basis, as of the dates and for

that are required to be reflected in the Company Financial Statements in
accordance with GAAP other than (i) those set forth or adequately provided for
on the Company Balance Sheet, (ii) those incurred in the conduct of the
Company's business since the Balance Sheet Date in the ordinary course of
business that are of the type that ordinarily recur and, individually or in

Subsidiary, taken as a whole, and do not result from any breach of Contract or
warranty or from any infringement, tort or violation of applicable Law, (iii)
executory obligations pursuant to the express terms of any Contract that do

thereof within a time period consistent with past practice relating thereto,
less an amount not in excess of the allowance for doubtful accounts provided
for in the Company Balance Sheet or in the Estimated Closing Statement, as the
case may be. Allowances for doubtful accounts and warranty returns have been
prepared in accordance with GAAP consistently applied and in accordance with
the Company's past practice and are sufficient to provide for any losses that

thereto, less allowances for doubtful accounts and warranty returns determined
in accordance with GAAP consistently applied and the Company's past practice
that are or shall be sufficient to provide for any losses that may be
sustained on realization of the applicable Accounts Receivable. As of the
Effective Date, none of the Accounts Receivable are subject to any claim of
offset, recoupment, set-off or counter-claim and, to the Company's Knowledge,
there are no facts or circumstances (whether asserted or unasserted) that
would give rise to any such claim. No material amount of Accounts Receivable
is contingent upon the performance by the Company of any obligation or
Contract other than normal warranty repair and replacement. No Person has any
Lien on any Accounts Receivable, and no agreement for deduction or discount
has been made with respect to any such Accounts Receivable. Schedule 4.5(e)

resale or distribution of any part thereof, and Buyer has no present intention
of selling, granting a participation in or otherwise distributing the same.
Buyer understands that the Shares have not been registered under the
Securities Act by reason of a specific exemption from the registration
provisions of the Securities Act that depends upon, among other things, the
bona fide nature of the investment intent and the accuracy of Buyer's
representations as expressed herein. Buyer understands that the Shares are
"restricted securities" under applicable U.S. federal and state securities
Laws and that, pursuant to these Laws, Buyer must hold the Shares indefinitely
unless they are registered with the Securities and Exchange Commission and
qualified by state authorities, or an exemption from such registration and
qualification requirements is available. Buyer understands that no public
market now exists for the Shares and that none of the Sellers, the Company,
the Subsidiary nor any other Person has made assurances that a public market
will ever exist for the Shares. Buyer is an "accredited investor" as defined
in Rule 501(a) of Regulation D promulgated under the Securities Act.



6.2 Organization and Standing. Buyer is a corporation duly organized under the
laws of the Canton of Vaud, Switzerland, validly existing and, where such
concept is recognized, in good standing under the Laws of its jurisdiction of
incorporation or formation. Buyer is duly qualified to do business, and, where
such concept is recognized, is in good standing, in each jurisdiction in which
the character of the properties owned or leased by it or in which the conduct
of its business requires it to be so qualified, except where the failure to be
so qualified or to be in good standing would not have a Material Adverse
Effect on Buyer.



6.3 Authority, Validity and Effect. Buyer has the requisite power and
authority to execute and deliver this Agreement and all agreements and
documents contemplated hereby to be executed and delivered by it, and to 

consummate the transactions contemplated hereby and thereby without obtaining
any additional approvals (whether internal or third party), except for any
such Consents contemplated hereby. The execution and delivery of this
Agreement and such other agreements and documents and the consummation of the
transactions contemplated hereby and thereby, have been duly and validly
authorized by all necessary action on the part of Buyer. This Agreement has
been duly and validly executed and delivered by Buyer and constitutes the
legal, valid and binding obligation of Buyer, enforceable against Buyer in
accordance with its terms, except as limited by the General Enforceability
Exceptions.



6.4 No Conflict; Required Consents.



(a) Neither the execution and delivery of this Agreement by Buyer, nor the
consummation by Buyer of the transactions contemplated hereby, nor compliance
by Buyer with any of the provisions hereof, will: (i) conflict with or result
in a breach of any provisions of the articles of association, bylaws or
similar governing documents of Buyer; (ii) constitute or result in the breach
of any term, condition or provision of, or constitute a default under, or give
rise to any right of termination, cancellation or acceleration with respect
to, or result in the creation or imposition of any Lien upon any property or
assets of Buyer pursuant to any note, bond, mortgage, indenture, license,
agreement, lease or other instrument or obligation to which Buyer is a party
or by which Buyer or any of Buyer's properties or assets may be subject, and
that would, in any such event, prevent the consummation of the Share Purchase;
or (iii) violate any Order or Law applicable to Buyer or any of its properties
or assets.



(b) Other than as may be required under the HSR Act, no Consent is required to
be obtained by Buyer for the consummation by Buyer of the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement that if not obtained would have a Material
Adverse Effect on Buyer.



6.5 Independent Investigation; No Reliance. In connection with its investment
decision, Buyer or its representatives have inspected and conducted such
reasonable independent review, investigation and analysis (financial and
otherwise) of the Company and the Subsidiary as desired by Buyer. The purchase
of the Shares by Buyer and the consummation of the transactions contemplated
hereby by Buyer are not done in reliance upon any representation or warranty
by, or information from, the Sellers, the Company, the Subsidiary or any of
their respective Affiliates, employees or representatives, whether oral or
written, express or implied, including any implied warranty of merchantability
or of fitness for a particular purpose, except for the representations and
warranties specifically and expressly set forth in Article IV and Article V
(in each case, as modified by the Schedules), and Buyer expressly disclaims
any other representations and warranties. Such purchase and consummation are
instead done entirely on the basis of Buyer's own investigation, analysis,
judgment and assessment of the present and potential value and earning power
of the Company and the Subsidiary, as well as those representations and
warranties by the Company and the Sellers, as applicable, specifically and
expressly set forth in Article IV and Article V (in each case, as modified by

case, as modified by the Schedules), Buyer acknowledges that neither the
Company nor the Sellers have made any representations or warranties to Buyer
regarding the projections or forecasts delivered to or made available to Buyer
of future revenues, future results of operations, future cash flows or the
future financial condition of the Company (on a consolidated basis).

by this Agreement, the Company: (a) will be solvent (in that both the fair

7.16 Release.



(a) Effective as of, and contingent upon, the Closing, each Seller, on such
Seller's behalf and on behalf of any such Seller's subsidiaries, heirs,
estates, successors or assigns (the "Releasors") (which, for clarity, excludes
any portfolio companies of any venture capital, private equity or other
equityholder in the Company), hereby knowingly, fully, unconditionally and
irrevocably releases any and all claims, rights, demands and causes of action
that such Releasor has or may have against the Company or the Subsidiary or
any present or former director, officer, manager, employee or agent of the
Company or the Subsidiary, whether asserted or unasserted, known or unknown,
contingent or noncontingent, past or present, arising or resulting from or
relating, directly or indirectly, to any act, omission, event or occurrence
prior to the Closing relating to the Company, the Subsidiary, their respective
assets and properties and the equity securities and convertible securities of
the Company and any rights or interests therein (including with respect to any
inaccuracies in the Spreadsheet or the allocation of the Purchase Price as set
forth herein or therein) (the "Released Claims"). Notwithstanding anything to
the contrary in the foregoing, nothing in this Section 7.16(a) will be deemed
to constitute a release or waiver by any Releasor of any claim, demand or
cause of action, or of any right of, such Releasor pursuant to (i) this
Agreement or the Ancillary Agreements (to which such Releasor is a party),
(ii) any written indemnification agreement between the Company and such
Releasor (if such Seller is a director or officer of the Company) that is
disclosed on the Schedules, (iii) the right to receive amounts payable
pursuant to exculpation, indemnification, reimbursement, contribution, payment
or advancement of related expenses, hold harmless and liability exculpation
covenants, agreements and obligations under provisions contained in (A) the
Charter Documents of the Company or the Subsidiary, (B) liability insurance
policies of the Company and (C) applicable Law, (iv) any rights to accrued but
unpaid compensation or employee benefits as an employee or director of the
Company or the Subsidiary or accrued compensation as a contractor or
consultant to the Company or the Subsidiary, in each case, with respect to
services performed prior to the Closing, or (v) any right of reimbursement for
expenses incurred by any such Releasor in the ordinary course of his or her
employment or service to the Company or the Subsidiary which are reimbursable
under the expense reimbursement policies of the Company or the Subsidiary.



(b) Such Seller acknowledges and agrees that it, he or she is familiar with
Section 1542 of the Civil Code of the State of California ("Section 1542"),
which provides as follows:



A GENERAL RELEASE DOES NOT EXTEND TO CLAIMS WHICH THE CREDITOR DOES NOT KNOW
OR SUSPECT TO EXIST IN HIS OR HER FAVOR AT THE TIME OF EXECUTING THE RELEASE,
WHICH IF KNOWN BY HIM OR HER MUST HAVE MATERIALLY AFFECTED HIS OR HER
SETTLEMENT WITH THE DEBTOR.

Effective as of, and contingent upon, the Closing, such Seller, on such
Seller's behalf and on behalf of the other Releasors, hereby waives and
relinquishes any rights and benefits that such Seller may have under Section
1542 or any similar statute or common law principle of any jurisdiction with
respect to the Released Claims. Such Seller acknowledges that it, he or she
may hereafter discover facts in addition to or different from those that such
Seller now 

knows or believes to be true with respect to the subject matter of the
Released Claims, but it is such Seller's intention to fully and finally and
forever settle and release any and all Released Claims (other than as
expressly set forth in Section 7.16(a) above) that do now exist, may exist or
heretofore have existed with respect to the subject matter thereof. In
furtherance of this intention, the release of the Released Claims (other than
as set forth in Section 7.16(a) above) shall be and remain in effect as full
and complete releases notwithstanding the discovery or existence of any such
additional or different facts.

(c) Each Seller agrees that he, she or it will not bring, commence, institute,
maintain, prosecute, participate in or voluntarily aid any Action, in law or
in equity, in any court or before any Governmental Authority, which (i)
challenges the validity of or seeks to enjoin the operation of any provision
of this Agreement or the execution and delivery of the Ancillary Agreements or
the consummation of the Share Purchase and the other transactions contemplated
hereby and thereby, or (ii) alleges that the execution and delivery of this
Agreement by such Seller, either alone or together with the other proxies to
be delivered in connection with this Agreement and/or the execution of this
Agreement by the other Sellers, breaches any fiduciary duty, whether of the
Board of Directors of the Company or any member thereof, of any officer of the
Company or of any holder of capital stock of the Company or other Company
securities, in each case, other than any Action for the enforcement of the
terms of this Agreement or any Ancillary Agreement to which such Seller is a
party.

of the requisite stockholder approval procedure under Section 7.17(b) below, a
waiver of the right to receive payments that could constitute "excess
parachute payments" as defined in Section 280G(b)(1) of the Code and Treasury
Regulations promulgated thereunder (a "Parachute Payment Waiver", and the
payments so waived, the "Waived Parachute Payments") from each Person who is
or would reasonably be considered to be, with respect to the Company, a
"disqualified individual" (within the meaning of Section 280G of the Code and
the Treasury Regulations promulgated thereunder), as determined immediately
prior to the initiation of the requisite stockholder approval procedure under
Section 7.17(b), and who could otherwise receive, have received, or have the
right or entitlement to receive any excess parachute payment under Section
280G of the Code, and the Company shall deliver any such Parachute Payment
Waiver to Buyer before the Closing Date.



(b) The Company shall use its commercially reasonable efforts to obtain, not
later than one day prior to the Closing Date, the approval by the stockholders
of the Company of the Waived Parachute Payments in accordance with the terms
of Section 280G(b)(5)(B) of the Code and the Treasury Regulations promulgated
thereunder. Whenever the Company becomes aware of any event prior to Closing
that should be set forth in an amendment or supplement to the disclosure
provided to stockholders as contemplated by Section 280G(b)(5)(B) of the Code
and the Treasury Regulations thereunder so that such disclosure would not
include any misstatement of a material fact or omit to state any material fact
necessary to make the statements therein not misleading, the Company will
promptly inform the Buyer of such occurrence and will promptly (and in all
events prior to Closing and consistent with the intent of the first sentence
of this Section 7.17(b)) prepare and provide to the Company's stockholders
such amendment or supplement. Buyer shall disclose to the Company the material
terms of any arrangements agreed to prior to Closing that will be provided by
Buyer or any of its Affiliates to any "disqualified individuals" within a
reasonable time after the date of this Agreement, and in any event no later
than five Business Days prior to the Closing Date, so that the Company may
comply with its obligations under this Section 7.17.



(c) The Company shall provide to Buyer at least two Business Days in advance
of their intended use copies of all Parachute Payment Waivers and copies of
all consents, disclosure documents and other materials to solicit any
stockholder vote contemplated by Section 7.17(b), provide Buyer with a
reasonable opportunity to review and comment thereon, and consider in good
faith any reasonable comments provided thereon by Buyer.

representation or warranty by, or information from, Buyer or any of its
Affiliates, employees or representatives, whether oral or written, express or
implied, including any implied warranty of merchantability or of fitness for a
particular purpose, except for the representations and warranties specifically
and expressly set forth in Article VI (as modified by the Schedules), and each
of the Company, the Seller Representative and each Seller acknowledges that

officers, managers or employees shall disclose or otherwise make available to
DPA Microphones any Product and IP Information.

however, that the right to terminate this Agreement pursuant to this Section
9.1(c) is not available to any party hereto whose breach of any provision of
this Agreement results in or causes such Order or other action;



(d) by the Seller Representative if: (i) Buyer has breached or failed to

to be complied with by Buyer such that the closing condition set forth in
Section 8.1(b) would not be satisfied; or (ii) there exists a breach of any
representation or warranty of Buyer contained in this Agreement such that the
closing condition set forth in Section 8.1(a) would not be satisfied, and, in
the case of clauses (i) and (ii) of this Section 9.1(d), such breach or
failure to perform is not cured within 30 days after receipt of written notice
thereof or is incapable of being cured by Buyer by the Termination Date; or

of Section 7.3(b), Section 7.4, this Section 9.2, and Article XII, which will
survive any termination of this Agreement; provided, however, that nothing
herein will relieve any party hereto from any liability for any intentional
and material pre‑termination breach by such party of its covenants or
agreements set forth in this Agreement.

provided that for the purposes of this clause (a), qualifications as to
material, materiality or Material Adverse Effect contained in such
representations and warranties shall be given effect for determining whether a
breach or inaccuracy of such representations and warranties has occurred, but
shall not be given effect for purposes of calculating any Losses relating
thereto; (b) any breach of the covenants or agreements of the Company arising
prior to or as of the Closing, or any breach of the covenants or agreements of
any of the Sellers, contained in this Agreement (including the Schedules and
exhibits attached hereto and the certificates delivered pursuant hereto) or
any Ancillary Agreement; and/or (c) any Fraud.



10.4 Exclusive Remedy. The parties hereto agree that, from and after the
Closing, the sole and exclusive remedies of the parties for any Losses based
upon, arising out of or otherwise in respect of the matters set forth in this
Agreement (including representations, warranties, covenants and agreements)
and the transactions contemplated hereby, whether based in contract, tort,
equity or Law, are the indemnification, reimbursement and other obligations of
the parties set forth in this Article X. The provisions of this Section 10.4
shall not, however, prevent or limit a cause of action under Section 10.8 to
obtain an injunction or injunctions to prevent breaches of this Agreement or
to enforce specifically the terms and provisions hereof.



10.5 Limitations on Indemnification Payments to Seller Indemnitees.
Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the contrary (including Section
10.2), the right of the Seller Indemnitees to indemnification shall be subject
to the following:



(a) The Seller Indemnitees' right to indemnification pursuant to Section 10.2
on account of any Losses will be reduced by all insurance proceeds actually
received by the Seller Indemnitees (net of any applicable collection costs and
reserves, deductibles, premium adjustments and retrospectively rated
premiums). The Seller Indemnitees shall use commercially reasonable efforts to
claim and recover any Losses suffered by the Seller Indemnitees under all such
insurance policies and other third party indemnities; provided, that in no
event shall any Seller Indemnitee be required to litigate to obtain any such
insurance coverage. The Seller Indemnitees shall remit to Buyer any such
insurance proceeds that are paid to the Seller Indemnitees with respect to
Losses for which the Seller Indemnitees have been previously compensated
pursuant to Section 10.2 (net of any applicable collection costs and reserves,
deductibles, premium adjustments and retrospectively rated premiums).



(b) The Seller Indemnitees will not be entitled to indemnification pursuant to
Section 10.2 for punitive damages except to the extent that punitive damages
have been awarded and paid to a third party in any Third Party Claim.



(c) No Seller Indemnitee shall be entitled to be compensated more than once
for the same Loss.







10.6 Limitations on Indemnification Payments to Buyer Indemnitees.
Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the contrary (including Section
10.3), the right of the Buyer Indemnitees to indemnification is subject to the
following:



(a) The Buyer Indemnitees will be entitled to indemnification pursuant to
Section 10.3(a) on account of any Losses arising with respect to the matters
described in Section 10.3(a) to the extent (but only to the extent) that the
aggregate amount of all Losses suffered by the Buyer Indemnitees with respect
to such matters exceeds a deductible of $[***]. The limitations set forth in
this Section 10.6(a) shall not apply to any indemnification claim pursuant to
Section 10.3(a) as a result of or arising from a breach or inaccuracy in any
Fundamental Representation.



(b) Buyer shall not, and shall cause the Buyer Indemnitees not to, seek
recourse against, and shall not, and shall cause the Buyer Indemnitees not to,
recover from any of the Seller Indemnitors on account of any Losses pursuant
to Section 10.3 (other than with respect to claims pursuant to Section 10.3(a)
as a result of or arising from any breach or inaccuracy of any Fundamental
Representation or pursuant to Section 10.3(c)) that exceed [***]. To the
extent such Losses pursuant to Section 10.3 (other than with respect to claims
pursuant to Section 10.3(a) as a result of or arising from any breach or
inaccuracy of any Fundamental Representation or pursuant to Section 10.3(c))
exceed [***], the parties agree that the RandW Insurance Policy shall be the
sole and exclusive remedy of the Buyer Indemnitees and no Buyer Indemnitees
shall have any rights to pursue any claims against any Seller Indemnitors for
amounts in excess of [***] (other than with respect to claims pursuant to
Section 10.3(a) as a result of or arising from any breach or inaccuracy of any
Fundamental Representation or pursuant to Section 10.3(c)). Notwithstanding
anything to the contrary in this Agreement, in the case of a claim pursuant to
Section 10.3(a) as a result of or arising from a breach or inaccuracy of any
or all of the Fundamental Representations, the aggregate liability of a Seller
with respect to any and all recoveries under this Agreement and the Ancillary
Agreements shall not exceed [***] up to an aggregate amount which, if added to
all other amounts paid or payable by such Seller pursuant to this Article X,
is equal to [***]. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement,
in the case of a claim pursuant to Section 10.3(c), the aggregate liability of
a Seller with respect to any and all recoveries under this Agreement and the
Ancillary Agreements shall equal [***] without any further limit or cap.



(c) The Buyer Indemnitees' right to indemnification pursuant to Section 10.3
(other than Section 10.3(c)) on account of any Losses will be reduced by all
insurance (including the RandW Insurance Policy) proceeds actually received by
the Buyer Indemnitees from any insurance policy of the Company or the
Subsidiary in effect immediately prior to the Closing (net of any applicable
collection costs and reserves, deductibles and premium adjustments). Buyer
shall use commercially reasonable efforts to claim and recover any Losses
suffered by the Buyer Indemnitees under all such insurance policies of the
Company or the Subsidiary in effect immediately prior to the Closing;
provided, that in no event shall any Buyer Indemnitee be required to litigate
to obtain any such insurance coverage. The Buyer Indemnitees shall, as
promptly as practicable, remit to the Seller Representative for the benefit of
the Sellers any such insurance proceeds that are paid to the Buyer Indemnitees
with respect to Losses for which the Buyer Indemnitees have been previously
compensated pursuant to Section 10.3 (net of any applicable collection costs
and reserves, deductibles and premium adjustments). The Buyer Indemnitees'
right to indemnification pursuant to Section 10.3 on account of any Losses
will be reduced by all third party indemnification proceeds actually received
by the Buyer Indemnitees from a third party (net of any applicable collection
costs and reserves); provided, however, that notwithstanding the foregoing, in
no event shall any Buyer Indemnitee be obligated to seek, pursue or recover
any third party indemnification proceeds on account of any Losses and the
failure to seek, pursue or recover any such third party indemnification
proceeds shall not reduce the amount of, or otherwise limit any Buyer
Indemnitee's right to, any such Losses.



(d) The Buyer Indemnitees will not be entitled to indemnification pursuant to
Section 10.3 for punitive damages except to the extent that punitive damages
have been awarded and paid to a third party in any Third Party Claim.

(e) The Buyer Indemnitees will not be entitled to indemnification pursuant to
Section 10.3 for Losses to the extent that any Buyer Indemnitee has been
compensated therefor pursuant to Section 2.3. 



(f) The Buyer Indemnitees right to indemnification pursuant to Section 10.3 on
account of any Losses will be reduced by the amount of any reserve or
provision properly reflected in the Final Working Capital, as finally
determined pursuant to Section 2.3, to the extent such Loss directly relates
to such reserve or provision.



(g) The Buyer Indemnitees shall comply with applicable Law with regards to
mitigating any Losses.



(h) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary herein, subject to the
limitations set forth in this Article X, (i) no Seller Indemnitee will have
any right of indemnification, contribution or right of advancement from Buyer,
the Company or any other Buyer Indemnitee with respect to any portion of any
Losses that are indemnifiable by any Seller Indemnitor under this Article X,
and (ii) the rights and remedies of the Buyer Indemnitees after the Closing
shall not be limited by (A) any investigation made, disclosure received, or
knowledge obtained, by or on behalf of any Buyer Indemnitee prior to the
Closing regarding any matter or (B) any waiver by Buyer of any condition to
the Closing related thereto.



(i) No Buyer Indemnitee shall be entitled to be compensated more than once for
the same Loss.



(j) Subject to Section 10.6(a), with respect to any claim for indemnification
pursuant to Section 10.3 (other than with respect to claims pursuant to
Section 10.3(a) as a result of or arising from any breach or inaccuracy of any
Fundamental Representation or pursuant to Section 10.3(c)), the obligation to
pay the Losses to the applicable Buyer Indemnitee shall be satisfied (i)
first, by the Seller Indemnitors to the extent recovery is available from the
Indemnity Escrow Funds pursuant to the Escrow Agreement and (ii) thereafter,
solely by recovery under the RandW Insurance Policy.



(k) With respect to any claim for indemnification pursuant to Section 10.3(a)
as a result of or arising from any breach or inaccuracy of any Fundamental
Representation, the obligation to pay the Losses to the applicable Buyer
Indemnitee shall be satisfied (i) first, by the Seller Indemnitors to the
extent recovery is available from the Indemnity Escrow Funds pursuant to the
Escrow Agreement, (ii) second, by recovery under the RandW Insurance Policy and
(iii) thereafter, by each Seller Indemnitor paying, within five Business Days
following the obligation of the Seller Indemnitors to pay to such Buyer
Indemnitee pursuant to Section 10.7, such Seller Indemnitor's Pro Rata Share
of any remaining unpaid portion of such Losses to the applicable Buyer
Indemnitee, subject to the second to last sentence of Section 10.6(b).



(l) With respect to any claim for indemnification pursuant to Section 10.3(c),
the obligation to pay the Losses to the applicable Buyer Indemnitee shall be
satisfied (i) first, only if such Losses are recoverable under the RandW
Insurance Policy and only to the extent the retention under the RandW Insurance
Policy has previously been satisfied, by recovery under the RandW Insurance
Policy and (ii) second by each Seller Indemnitor paying, within five Business
Days following the obligation of the Seller Indemnitors to pay such Losses to
such Buyer Indemnitee pursuant to Section 10.7, such Seller Indemnitor's Pro
Rata Share of such Losses to the Buyer Indemnitee, subject to the last
sentence of Section 10.6(b).



(m) The Buyer Indemnitees will not have the right to indemnification under
this Agreement for any Losses to the extent such Losses are based on Taxes:
(i) except to the extent attributable to any breach or inaccuracy in the
representations and warranties in Sections 4.6(c), (d), (e), (f), or (k),
attributable to taxable periods (or portions thereof) beginning after the
Closing Date; (ii) that are due to the unavailability in any taxable period
(or portion thereof) beginning after the Closing Date of any net operating
losses, or other Tax attribute from a taxable period (or portion thereof)
ending on or prior to the Closing Date; (iii) resulting from transactions or
actions taken by Buyer, the Company, the Subsidiary or any of their respective
Affiliates after the Closing on the Closing Date that are not contemplated by
this Agreement and are outside the ordinary course of business consistent with
past practice; or (iv) that result from Buyer's breach of any of the covenants
contained in Article XI.



10.7 Procedures.



(a) Notice of Losses by Seller Indemnitee. Subject to the limitations set
forth in this Article X, as soon as reasonably practicable after a Seller
Indemnitee has actual knowledge, based on a good faith belief, of any claim
that it has under this Article X that may result in a Loss (a "Claim"), the
Seller Representative shall give written notice thereof (a "Claims Notice") to
Buyer. A Claims Notice must describe the Claim in reasonable detail and
indicate the amount (estimated, as necessary and to the extent feasible) of
the Loss that has been or may be suffered by the applicable Seller Indemnitee.
No delay in or failure to give a Claims Notice by the Seller Representative to
Buyer pursuant to this Section 10.7(a) will adversely affect any of the other
rights or remedies that the Seller Representative has under this Agreement, or
alter or relieve Buyer of its obligation to indemnify the applicable Seller
Indemnitee, except to the extent (and only to the extent) that Buyer is
materially prejudiced thereby. Buyer shall respond to the Seller
Representative (a "Claim Response") within 30 days (the "Response Period")
after the date that the Claims Notice is sent by the Seller Representative.
Any Claim Response must specify whether or not Buyer disputes the Claim
described in the Claims Notice. If Buyer fails to give a Claim Response within
the Response Period, then Buyer will be deemed not to dispute the Claim
described in the related Claims Notice. If Buyer elects not to dispute a Claim
described in a Claims Notice, whether by failing to give a timely Claim
Response or otherwise, then the amount of Losses alleged in such Claims Notice
will be conclusively deemed to be an obligation of Buyer, and Buyer shall pay,
in cash, to the Seller Representative within 15 days after the last day of the
applicable Response Period the amount specified in the Claims Notice. If Buyer
delivers a Claim Response within the Response Period indicating that it
disputes one or more of the matters identified in the Claims Notice, then
Buyer and the Seller Representative shall promptly meet and use their
reasonable efforts to settle the dispute. If Buyer and the Seller
Representative are unable to reach agreement within 30 days after the
conclusion of the Response Period, then either Buyer or the Seller
Representative may resort to other legal remedies in accordance with Section
12.12, subject to the limitations set forth in this Article X.



(b) Notice of Losses by Buyer Indemnitee.



(i) Claims with Determinable Losses. Subject to the limitations set forth in
this Article X, if any Buyer Indemnitee believes in good faith that it has a
claim for indemnification pursuant to Section 10.3 (a "Buyer Claim"), the
amount of which is then known by Buyer, then Buyer shall, as soon as
reasonably practicable after it actually becomes aware of such Buyer Claim,
notify the Seller Representative and, if applicable, the RandW Insurer of such
Buyer Claim by means of a written notice (with a copy to the Escrow Agent if
the Claim involves recovery against the Indemnity Escrow Funds) describing the
Buyer Claim in reasonable detail and setting forth Buyer's good faith
calculation of the Losses paid, sustained, suffered or incurred by the
applicable Buyer Indemnitee with respect thereto (a "Buyer Claim Notice" and,
together with a Claims Notice, a "Notice"). The failure by Buyer to promptly
deliver a Buyer Claim Notice under this Section 10.7(b)(i) will not adversely
affect the applicable Buyer Indemnitee's right to indemnification pursuant to
Section 10.3, except to the extent (and only to the extent) the Seller
Representative or any of the Sellers are materially prejudiced thereby in
terms of the amount of Losses for which the Seller Indemnitors are obligated
to indemnify the Buyer Indemnitees. If, by the 30th day following receipt by
the Seller Representative of a Buyer Claim Notice (the "Dispute Period"),
Buyer has not received from the Seller Representative notice in writing that
the Seller Representative objects to the Buyer Claim (or the amount of Losses
set forth therein) asserted in such Buyer Claim Notice (a "Dispute Notice"),
then (A) the Seller Representative (on behalf of the Sellers) shall be
conclusively deemed to have consented to the recovery by the applicable Buyer
Indemnitees of the full amount of Losses specified in the Buyer Claim Notice
and (B) the Seller Representative and Buyer shall deliver a joint written
instruction to the Escrow Agent instructing the Escrow Agent to pay to Buyer
from the Indemnity Escrow Funds the amount of Losses specified in the Buyer
Claim Notice, subject to the provisions contained in this Article X.



(ii) Claims without Determinable Losses. Subject to the limitations set forth
in this Article X, if any Buyer Indemnitee believes in good faith that it has
a Buyer Claim, the amount of which cannot reasonably be determined by Buyer,
then Buyer shall, as soon as reasonably practicable after it actually becomes
aware of such Buyer Claim, notify the Seller Representative and, if
applicable, the RandW Insurer by means of a Buyer Claim Notice (with a copy to
the Escrow Agent if the Claim involves recovery against the Indemnity Escrow
Funds) that contains the information required by Section 10.7(b)(i) (other
than a good faith calculation of the Losses paid, sustained, suffered or
incurred) and a good faith estimate, if reasonably practicable, of Buyer's 

calculation of the Losses paid, sustained, suffered or incurred or that may be
paid, sustained, suffered or incurred by the applicable Buyer Indemnitee with
respect thereto. The failure by Buyer to promptly deliver a Buyer Claim Notice
under this Section 10.7(b)(ii) will not adversely affect the applicable Buyer
Indemnitee's right to indemnification pursuant to Section 10.3, except to the
extent (and only to the extent) the Seller Representative or any Seller is
materially prejudiced thereby in terms of the amount of Losses for which the
Seller Indemnitors are obligated to indemnify the Buyer Indemnitees. If Buyer
has not received a Dispute Notice from the Seller Representative within the
Dispute Period, then (A) the Seller Representative (on behalf of the Sellers)
shall be conclusively deemed to have consented to the recovery by the
applicable Buyer Indemnitees of the full amount of Losses specified in the
Buyer Claim Notice and (B) the Seller Representative and Buyer shall deliver a
joint written instruction to the Escrow Agent instructing the Escrow Agent to
pay to Buyer from the Indemnity Escrow Funds the amount of Losses specified
from time to time as the amount of any such Buyer Claim becomes known, subject
to the provisions contained in this Article X.



(iii) Disputes. If the Seller Representative timely delivers a Dispute Notice
to Buyer within the Dispute Period (with a copy to the Escrow Agent if the
Claim involves recovery against the Indemnity Escrow Funds), Buyer and the
Seller Representative shall promptly meet and use their reasonable efforts to
settle the dispute as to whether and to what extent the Buyer Indemnitees are
entitled to indemnification hereunder on account of such Buyer Claim. If Buyer
and the Seller Representative are able to reach agreement within 30 days after
Buyer receives such Dispute Notice, then the Seller Representative and Buyer
shall deliver a joint written instruction to the Escrow Agent setting forth
such agreement and instructing the Escrow Agent to pay to Buyer from the
Indemnity Escrow Funds an amount in accordance with such agreement. If Buyer
and the Seller Representative are unable to reach agreement within 30 days
after Buyer receives such Dispute Notice, then either Buyer or the Seller
Representative may resort to other legal remedies in accordance with Section
12.12, subject to the limitations set forth in this Article X. For all
purposes of this Article X (including those pertaining to disputes under
Section 10.7(a) and this Section 10.7(b)), Buyer and the Seller Representative
shall cooperate with and make available to the other party and its respective
representatives all information, records and data, and shall permit reasonable
access to its facilities and personnel, as may be reasonably required and
reasonably requested in connection with the resolution of such disputes.



(iv) Buyer Claim Notice. Notwithstanding anything in this Section 10.7(b) to
the contrary, a Buyer Claim Notice may be updated and amended from time to
time by Buyer delivering an updated or amended Buyer Claim Notice, so long as
such update or amendment relates to the underlying facts and circumstances
specifically set forth in such original Buyer Claim Notice.



(c) Third Party Claims. Buyer shall determine and conduct the investigation,
defense and the settlement, adjustment or compromise of any claim by a third
party against any Buyer Indemnitee (a "Third Party Claim"), and all costs,
expenses and other amounts incurred by Buyer in connection with such
investigation, defense or settlement of such claim and the enforcement and
protection of its rights under this Agreement in respect thereof (including
reasonable attorneys' fees, other professionals' and experts' fees and court
or arbitration costs), shall constitute Losses for which the Buyer Indemnitees
shall obtain indemnification for hereunder if it is ultimately determined that
such Third-Party Claim itself is indemnifiable under Section 10.3. No
settlement, adjustment, compromise or entry of judgment shall be determinative
of the existence or amount of Losses relating to such matter, except for any
such settlement, adjustment, compromise or entry of judgement entered into or
agreed to with the prior written consent of the Seller Representative (on
behalf of the Seller Indemnitors), such consent not to be unreasonably
withheld conditioned or delayed. In the event that the Seller Representative
has consented in writing to any such settlement, adjustment, compromise or
entry of judgement, neither the Seller Representative nor any Seller
Indemnitors shall have any power or authority to object under any provision of
this Article X to the amount of any Buyer Claim by or on behalf of any Buyer
Indemnitee against the Indemnity Escrow Funds or the Seller Indemnitors in
accordance with the provisions of this Article X for indemnification with
respect to the amount of Losses contemplated by such settlement, adjustment,
compromise or entry of judgement.



(d) Seller Representative Participation. The Seller Representative shall have
the right to receive copies of all pleadings, notices and other written
communications with the third party claimant or its counsel with respect to 

the Third Party Claim and may participate (with its own counsel and at the
expense of the Seller Indemnitors, which cannot be satisfied from the
Indemnity Escrow Funds) in, but not determine, the conduct of the defense of
the Third Party Claim or settlement, adjustment or compromise negotiations
with respect to the Third Party Claim. Buyer shall have the right, in its sole
discretion, to determine the conduct of the defense of the Third Party Claim
or the settlement, adjustment or compromise thereto.



(e) Other Releases of the Indemnity Escrow Funds. All Indemnity Escrow Funds
held under the Escrow Agreement minus the amounts reasonably necessary to
satisfy any and all unresolved or disputed Buyer Claims set forth in any then
pending Buyer Claim Notices (and less the employer portion of any applicable
social security, Medicare, unemployment or other employment, withholding or
payroll Tax or similar amount owed by or imposed upon Buyer (or any of its
Affiliated entities) as a result of or with respect to or attributable to the
release of such funds to the extent such Tax or similar amount would
constitute Selling Expenses) shall automatically be released to the
Stockholders and the Company (on behalf of the Optionholders), in each case,
in accordance with their Pro Rata Share thereof as set forth in the
Spreadsheet, within one Business Day after the [***] (the "Escrow Release
Date) in accordance with this Agreement and the Escrow Agreement. With respect
to amounts delivered to the Company (on behalf of the Optionholders), Buyer
shall pay, or shall cause one or more of its Affiliated entities to pay, such
amounts to the Optionholders (less applicable withholding), in accordance with
the Escrow Agreement, as promptly thereafter as reasonably practicable, but in
no event later than 21 days following the date on which Buyer receives such
amounts from the Escrow Agent, through the payroll of Buyer or its Affiliated
entities. Any portion of the Indemnity Escrow Funds held by the Escrow Agent
following the Escrow Release Date with respect to any unresolved or disputed
Buyer Claims that are not awarded to a Buyer Indemnitee upon the resolution of
thereof (less the employer portion of any applicable social security,
Medicare, unemployment or other employment, withholding or payroll Tax or
similar amount owed by or imposed upon Buyer (or any of its Affiliated
entities) as a result of or with respect to or attributable to the release of
such funds to the extent such Tax or similar amount would constitute Selling
Expenses) `shall be released to the Stockholders and the Company (on behalf of
the Optionholders), in each case, in accordance with their Pro Rata Share
thereof as set forth in the Spreadsheet.



10.8 Specific Performance. Each party's obligations under this Agreement are
unique. If any party hereto should breach its covenants or agreements under
this Agreement, the parties hereto each acknowledge that it would be extremely
impracticable to measure the resulting damages; accordingly, the nonbreaching
party or parties, in addition to any other available rights or remedies they
may have under the terms of this Agreement, may sue in equity for specific
performance or to obtain an injunction or injunctions to prevent breaches of
this Agreement, and each party hereto expressly waives the defense that a
remedy in damages will be adequate.



10.9 Subrogation. Upon the Seller Indemnitors making any payment of Losses to
any Buyer Indemnitee pursuant to Section 10.6(k)(iii) or Section 10.6(l)(ii),
the Seller Representative (on behalf of the Sellers) shall be subrogated to
all rights of the Buyer Indemnitees against the RandW Insurer arising from that
portion of such Losses paid by the Seller Indemnitors to the Buyer Indemnitees
pursuant to Section 10.6(k)(iii) or Section 10.6(l)(ii) if, and only if, such
Buyer Indemnitees did not recover from the RandW Insurer under the RandW Insurance
Policy all or such portion of such Losses that would reasonably be expected to
be recoverable under the RandW Insurance Policy.



10.10 Adjustment to Purchase Price. All indemnification payments made pursuant
to this Article X will be treated as an adjustment to the Purchase Price
unless otherwise required by applicable Law.



10.11 Deemed Losses. Notwithstanding anything else contained in this Agreement
to the contrary, any Losses incurred by any Buyer Indemnitee shall be deemed
as Losses incurred by Logitech US.



ARTICLE X1 TAX MATTERS



11.1 Cooperation; Audits; Tax Returns.



(a) In connection with the preparation of Tax Returns, audit examinations, and
any administrative or judicial proceedings relating to the Tax Liabilities
imposed on the Company or the Subsidiary for all Tax periods (or 

portion of a Straddle Period) ending on or before the Closing Date
("Pre‑Closing Tax Periods"), Buyer, on the one hand, and the Sellers, on the
other hand, shall cooperate fully with each other, including the furnishing or
making available during normal business hours of records, personnel (as
reasonably required), books of account, powers of attorney or other materials
necessary or helpful for the preparation of such Tax Returns, the conduct of
audit examinations or the defense of claims by Taxing Authorities as to the
imposition of Taxes and any assessment or reassessment in respect of Taxes.
Buyer shall, and shall cause the Company and the Subsidiary to, (i) retain all
books and records with respect to Tax Matters pertinent to the Company and the
Subsidiary relating to any taxable period beginning before the Closing Date
until the expiration of the applicable statute of limitations (and, to the
extent notified by the Seller Representative, any extension thereof) for the
respective taxable periods, and to abide by all record retention Laws and
agreements entered into with any Taxing Authority, and (ii) give the Seller
Representative reasonable written notice prior to transferring, destroying or
discarding any such books and records and shall allow the Seller
Representative to take possession of such books and records.



(b) Buyer and the Seller Representative shall, upon the other's request, use
their commercially reasonable efforts to obtain any certificate or other
document from any Governmental Authority or any other Person as may be
necessary to mitigate, reduce or eliminate any Tax that could be imposed
(including with respect to the transactions contemplated hereby).



(c) The Seller Representative shall prepare, or cause to be prepared, all
income Tax Returns of the Company or the Subsidiary for any Pre-Closing Tax
Period (not including any Straddle Period). The Seller Representative shall
provide such income Tax Returns to Buyer at least thirty days before the due
date for such income Tax Returns, including any applicable extensions, for
Buyer's review and approval, not to be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or
delayed. To the fullest extent permitted by Law, the Tax Deductions shall be
reported on applicable income Tax Returns solely as income Tax deductions of
the Company and the Subsidiary for Pre-Closing Tax Periods and to the extent
so reported shall not be treated or reported as income Tax deductions for a
year or period (or portion thereof) beginning after the Closing Date
(including under Section 1.1502-76(b)(1)(ii)(B) of the Treasury Regulations or
any comparable or similar provision under state, local or foreign Law). Buyer
shall timely file such income Tax Returns. The Sellers shall pay to the
Company or Buyer the amount of Taxes shown due on such Tax Returns.



11.2 Controversies. Notwithstanding Section 10.7(c), this Section 11.2 shall
control any inquiries, assessments, proceedings or similar events with respect
to Taxes. Buyer shall promptly notify the Seller Representative: (a) upon
receipt by Buyer or any Affiliate of Buyer of any notice of any Tax Matter
from any Taxing Authority; or (b) prior to Buyer, the Company or the
Subsidiary initiating any Tax Matter with any Taxing Authority. The Seller
Representative may, at the Sellers' expense, participate in any such Tax
Matter; provided, however, that the failure to provide such notice with
respect to clause (a) of this Section 11.2 will not affect Buyer's right to
indemnification under Section 10.3 except to the extent the Sellers' defense
of such matter is demonstrably prejudiced by such failure; provided further
that the failure to provide such notice with respect to clause (b) of this
Section 11.2 will negate Buyer's right to indemnification under Section 10.3
with respect to Tax Liabilities resulting from any such voluntary contact.
Buyer shall have the authority, with respect to any Tax Matter, to represent
the interests of the Company and the Subsidiary before the relevant Taxing
Authority and the Buyer shall have the right to control the defense,
compromise or other resolution of any such Tax Matter, subject to the
limitations contained herein, including responding to inquiries, and
contesting, defending against and resolving any assessment for additional
Taxes or notice of Tax deficiency or other adjustment of Taxes of, or relating
to, such Tax Matter. Buyer shall not enter into any settlement of or otherwise
compromise any such Tax Matter to the extent that it adversely affects the Tax
Liability of the Sellers without the prior written consent of the Seller
Representative, which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld, conditioned
or delayed. The Buyer shall keep the Seller Representative informed with
respect to the commencement, status and nature of any such Tax Matter and
will, in good faith, allow the Seller Representative to consult with Buyer
regarding the conduct of or positions taken in any such proceeding.



11.3 Amendment of Tax Returns. Unless required to reflect a final
determination within the meaning of Section 1313 of the Code, neither Buyer
nor any of its Affiliates shall amend, refile, revoke or otherwise modify any
Tax Return or Tax election of the Company or the Subsidiary with respect to a
Pre‑Closing Tax Period (not including any Straddle Period) without the prior
written consent of the Seller Representative. 



11.4 Certain Taxes. All transfer, documentary, sales, use, stamp, registration
and other such Taxes and fees (including any penalties and interest) incurred
in connection with the transactions contemplated by this Agreement
(collectively, "Transfer Taxes") will be paid by Buyer when due, and all
necessary Tax Returns and other documentation with respect to Transfer Taxes
will be prepared and filed by Buyer unless a Seller is required to file such
Tax Returns under applicable Law.



11.5 Refunds and Credits. Any Tax refund received by Buyer, the Company or the
Subsidiary (or any of their respective Affiliates), and any amounts credited
against any Tax to which Buyer, the Company or the Subsidiary (or any of their
respective Affiliates) shall become entitled, which refund or credit relates
to taxable periods, or portions thereof, ending on or before the Closing Date,
shall be for the account of the Sellers, and Buyer shall pay, or cause to be
paid, to the Sellers in the proportions set forth on Schedule 2.3(e)(ii), an
amount equal to such refund or credit. With respect to the Stockholders, such
amounts shall be paid by Buyer within five Business Days after receipt or
utilization thereof by bank wire transfer of immediately available funds to
the accounts designated in writing by the Seller Representative to Buyer. With
respect to the Optionholders, such amounts shall be paid by Buyer, or Buyer
shall cause one or more of its Affiliated entities to pay, such amounts to the
Optionholders (less applicable withholding and any applicable social security,
Medicare, unemployment or other employment, withholding or payroll Tax or
similar amount owed by or imposed upon Buyer (or any of its Affiliated
entities) or for which Buyer (or any of its Affiliated entities) is or will
otherwise be liable, as a result of or with respect to or attributable to, any
such payment) as promptly thereafter as practicable, but in no event later
than 21 days, after receipt or utilization thereof, through the payroll of
Buyer or one or more of its Affiliated entities.



11.6 Consolidated Income Tax Return. The Company shall join the consolidated
U.S. federal income Tax Return of Logitech US and its Subsidiaries for the
taxable year of Logitech US that includes the day after the Closing Date. The
parties acknowledge and agree that, as a consequence of the transactions
contemplated pursuant to or in connection with this Agreement, (a) the taxable
year of the Company and the Subsidiaries shall close for U.S. federal income
Tax purposes at the end of the day on the Closing Date, (b) to the extent
applicable Law in other taxing jurisdictions so permits, the taxable year of
the Company and the Subsidiaries shall close at the end of the day on the
Closing Date and (c) to the extent applicable Law in other taxing
jurisdictions so permits, all federal, state, local and foreign income Tax
Returns shall be filed consistently on the foregoing basis.

Company (pre‑Closing) or the Sellers. In performing any of its duties under
this Agreement or any agreements or documents executed and delivered in

instruments and take such further actions as may reasonably be necessary to

instrument in writing duly executed by the Seller Representative and Buyer. At
any time, the Seller Representative or Buyer may: (a) extend the time for the
performance of any of the obligations or other acts of the parties hereto;
provided, that the Seller Representative may not extend the time for the

making the waiver. No waiver of any provision hereunder or any breach or
default thereof shall extend to or affect in any way any other provision or
prior or subsequent breach or default. Receipt by Buyer of any of the
agreements, instruments, certificates or documents delivered pursuant to
Section 3.2 shall not be deemed to be an agreement by Buyer that the
information or statements contained therein are true, correct or complete, and
shall not diminish Buyer's remedies hereunder if any of the foregoing
agreements, instruments, certificates or documents are not true, correct or
complete.



12.9 Optionholder Payments. Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary,
no payment of any amounts contemplated by this Agreement shall be made to any
Optionholder, in his or her capacity as such, after the fifth anniversary of
the Closing Date, and such amounts remaining after the fifth anniversary of
the Closing Date shall be distributed to the Stockholders, on a pro‑rata basis
based on his, her or its fully diluted ownership compared with all
Stockholders.



12.10 Legal Representation. Buyer further agrees that, as to all
communications between and among all counsel for the Sellers, the Company, the
Subsidiary or their respective Affiliates (including Jones Day), and
Riverside, the Sellers, the Company, the Subsidiary or their respective
Affiliates that primarily relate to the transactions contemplated by or in
connection with this Agreement (collectively, the "Privileged
Communications"), the attorney-client privilege and the expectation of client
confidence with respect to the Privileged Communications belongs to the
Sellers and may be controlled by the Sellers and will not pass to or be
claimed by Buyer or any of its respective subsidiaries (including, following
the Closing, the Company and the Subsidiary). The Privileged Communications
are the property of the Sellers and, from and after the Closing, none of
Buyer, its subsidiaries (including, following the Closing, the Company and the
Subsidiary) or any Person purporting to act on behalf of or through Buyer or
such subsidiaries will seek to obtain the Privileged Communications, whether
by seeking a waiver of the attorney-client privilege or through other means.
Buyer, and its respective subsidiaries (including, following the Closing, the
Company and the Subsidiary), together with any of their respective Affiliates,
successors or assigns, further agree that no such party may use or rely on any
of the Privileged Communications in any action against or involving any of the
Sellers or any of their respective Affiliates after the Closing. The
Privileged Communications may be used by the Sellers or any of their
respective Affiliates in connection with any dispute that relates to the
transactions contemplated by or in connection with this Agreement, including
in any claim for indemnification brought by Buyer. Notwithstanding the 

foregoing, in the event that a dispute arises between Buyer or any of its
respective subsidiaries and a third party (other than a party to this
Agreement or any of its Affiliates) after the Closing, Buyer and its
subsidiaries may assert the attorney-client privilege to prevent disclosure of
confidential communications by counsel to such third party, provided that
neither Buyer nor its subsidiaries (including, following the Closing, the
Company and the Subsidiary) may waive such privilege without the prior written
consent of the Seller Representative.



12.11 Governing Law. This Agreement is to be governed by, and construed and
enforced in accordance with, the laws of the State of Delaware, without regard
to its rules of conflict of laws.



12.12 Consent to Jurisdiction and Service of Process. The parties hereto
consent and submit to the exclusive jurisdiction of the courts of the Delaware
Court of Chancery and any state appellate court therefrom within the State of
Delaware (or, if the Delaware Court of Chancery declines to accept
jurisdiction over a particular matter, then any state or federal court within
the State of Delaware) in respect of the interpretation and enforcement of the
provisions of this Agreement and waive, and will not assert, any defense in
any Action for the interpretation or enforcement of this Agreement, that they
are not subject to the courts' jurisdiction or that the Action may not be
brought or is not maintainable in such courts or that this Agreement may not
be enforced in or by such courts or that their respective property is exempt
or immune from execution, that the Action is brought in an inconvenient forum
or that the venue of the Action is improper. Service of process with respect
thereto may be made upon the parties hereto by mailing a copy thereof by
registered or certified mail, postage prepaid, to that party at the applicable
address provided in Section 12.6.



12.13 Waiver of Jury Trial. EACH OF THE PARTIES HERETO HEREBY IRREVOCABLY
WAIVES ANY AND ALL RIGHT TO TRIAL BY JURY IN ANY ACTION ARISING OUT OF OR
RELATED TO THIS AGREEMENT OR THE TRANSACTIONS CONTEMPLATED HEREBY.



12.14 Severability. Any term or provision of this Agreement that is invalid or
unenforceable in any jurisdiction will, as to that jurisdiction, be
ineffective to the extent of such invalidity or unenforceability without
rendering invalid or unenforceable the remaining terms and provisions of this
Agreement or affecting the validity or enforceability of any of the terms or
provisions of this Agreement in any other jurisdiction. If any provision of
this Agreement is so broad as to be unenforceable, the provision will be
interpreted to be only so broad as is enforceable.



12.15 Construction. The parties hereto have participated jointly in the
negotiation and drafting of this Agreement. If an ambiguity or question of
intent or interpretation arises, then this Agreement will be construed as
drafted jointly by the parties hereto and no presumption or burden of proof
will arise favoring or disfavoring any party hereto by virtue of the
authorship of any of the provisions of this Agreement. Unless otherwise
indicated to the contrary herein by the context or use thereof: (a) any
reference to any federal, state, local or foreign statute or law will be
deemed also to refer to all rules and regulations promulgated thereunder; (b)
all references to the preamble, recitals, Sections, Articles, Exhibits or
Schedules are to the preamble, recitals, Sections, Articles, Exhibits or

other material has been "delivered," "provided" or "made available" to Buyer,
its legal counsel or its other representatives, that such information,
document or material was included, and available for review by Buyer, its
legal counsel and its other representatives, in the virtual data room set up
by Donnelley Financial Services in connection with this Agreement as of 5:00
p.m. Pacific Time on the date one Business Day prior to the Effective Date.

separate counterparts, each of which will be deemed an original, but all of
which together will constitute one and the same instrument.

delivery of a manually executed counterpart to this Agreement.



12.17 Complete Agreement. This Agreement and the Schedules and exhibits hereto
and the other documents delivered by the parties hereto in connection
herewith, together with the Confidentiality Agreement, contain the complete
agreement between the parties hereto with respect to the transactions
contemplated hereby and thereby and supersede all prior agreements and
