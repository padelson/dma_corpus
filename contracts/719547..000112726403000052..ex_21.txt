                          AGREEMENT AND PLAN OF MERGER


                  AGREEMENT AND PLAN OF MERGER (this "Agreement"), dated as of
April 1, 2003, by and among Berkshire Hathaway Inc., a Delaware corporation
("Parent"), B Merger Sub Inc., a Delaware corporation and a wholly owned
subsidiary of Parent ("Merger Sub"), and Clayton Homes, Inc., a Delaware
corporation (the "Company").

                  WHEREAS, the Board of Directors of Parent, the Board of
Directors of Merger Sub, and the Board of Directors of the Company have
approved, and determined that it is advisable and in the best interests of their
respective companies and stockholders to consummate, the merger of Merger Sub
with and into the Company (the "Merger"), with the Company as the surviving
corporation in the Merger, upon and subject to the terms and conditions set
forth in this Agreement, pursuant to which the shares of Common Stock, par value
$0.10 per share, of the Company (the "Shares" or the "Company Common Stock")
issued and outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time (as defined in
Section 1.2), other than Shares described in Section 2.1(b) and any Dissenting
Shares (as defined in Section 2.3), will be converted into the right to receive
$12.50 per Share in cash (the "Merger Consideration"); and

                  WHEREAS, the Company, Parent and Merger Sub desire to make
certain representations, warranties, covenants and agreements in connection with
the Merger and the other transactions contemplated hereby; and

                  WHEREAS, concurrently with the execution and delivery of this
Agreement and as a condition to Parent's and Merger Sub's willingness to enter
into this Agreement, Parent and Merger Sub have entered into a Stockholders
Agreement, dated the date hereof, the form of which is attached as Exhibit A
hereto (the "Stockholders Agreement"), with the stockholders named therein (the
"Stockholders"), pursuant to which the Stockholders have, among other things,
agreed to vote all Shares beneficially owned by the Stockholders in favor of the
Merger and this Agreement and against any Takeover Proposal (as defined herein),
in each case subject to and on the conditions set forth therein.

                  NOW, THEREFORE, in consideration of the foregoing and the
respective representations, warranties, covenants and agreements set forth
herein, the parties hereto agree as follows:

                                   ARTICLE I

                                   THE MERGER

                  Section 1.1 The Merger. Subject to the terms and conditions of
this Agreement and the provisions of the Delaware General Corporation Law (the
"DGCL"), at the Effective Time, the Company and Merger Sub shall consummate a
merger (the "Merger") pursuant to which (a) Merger Sub shall be merged with and
into the Company and the separate corporate existence of Merger Sub shall
thereupon cease, (b) the Company shall be the successor or surviving corporation
in the Merger (the "Surviving Corporation") under the name "Clayton Homes, Inc."
and shall continue to be governed by the laws of the State of Delaware, and (c)
the separate corporate existence of the Company with all its rights, privileges,
immunities, powers and franchises shall continue unaffected by the Merger. After
the Effective Time, (x) the certificate of incorporation of the Company shall be
amended as desired by Parent (which amendments will include restrictions on the

<PAGE>

transferability of shares of capital stock of the Surviving Corporation) and as
so amended shall become the certificate of incorporation of the Surviving
Corporation, until thereafter amended as provided by law and such certificate of
incorporation, and (y) the bylaws of Merger Sub, as in effect immediately prior
to the Effective Time, shall be the bylaws of the Surviving Corporation until
thereafter amended as provided by law, the certificate of incorporation and such
bylaws. The Merger shall have the effects set forth in the DGCL.

                  Section 1.2 Effective Time. Parent, Merger Sub, and the
Company shall cause an appropriate Certificate of Merger (the "Certificate of
Merger") to be executed and filed on the date of the Closing (as defined in
Section 1.3) (or on such other date as Parent and the Company may agree) with
the Secretary of State of the State of Delaware (the "Secretary of State") as
provided in the DGCL. The Merger shall become effective on the date on which the
Certificate of Merger has been duly filed with the Secretary of State or such
later time as is agreed upon by the parties and specified in the Certificate of
Merger, and such time is hereinafter referred to as the "Effective Time."

                  Section 1.3 Closing. The closing of the Merger (the "Closing")
shall take place at 10:00 a.m., on a date to be specified by the parties, which
shall be as soon as practicable, but in no event later than the fourth business
day, after satisfaction or waiver of all of the conditions set forth in Article
VI hereof (the "Closing Date"), at, or directed from, the offices of Munger,
Tolles & Olson LLP, 355 South Grand Avenue, Los Angeles, California 90071,
unless another date or place is agreed to in writing by the parties hereto.

                  Section 1.4 Directors and Officers of the Surviving
Corporation. The directors of Merger Sub and the officers of the Company
immediately prior to the Effective Time shall, from and after the Effective
Time, be the directors and officers, respectively, of the Surviving Corporation
until their successors shall have been duly elected or appointed or qualified or
until their earlier death, resignation or removal in accordance with the
Surviving Corporation's certificate of incorporation and bylaws.

                  Section 1.5 Stockholders' Meeting.

                           (a) The Company, acting through its Board of
Directors, shall, in accordance with applicable law:

                                    (i) duly call, give notice of, convene and
hold a special meeting of its stockholders for the purpose of considering and
taking action upon this Agreement (the "Special Meeting") as soon as practicable
following the date hereof;

                                    (ii) prepare and file with the United States
Securities and Exchange Commission (the "SEC"), within ten business days of the
date hereof, a preliminary proxy statement relating to the Merger and this
Agreement and use its reasonable efforts (A) to obtain and furnish the
information required to be included by the federal securities laws (and the
rules and regulations thereunder) in the Proxy Statement (as hereinafter


                                       2
<PAGE>

defined) and, after consultation with Parent, to respond promptly to any
comments made by the SEC with respect to the preliminary proxy statement and, as
soon as practicable thereafter, to cause a definitive proxy statement (the
"Proxy Statement") to be mailed to its stockholders and (B) to obtain the
necessary approvals of the Merger and this Agreement by its stockholders as soon
as practicable; and

                                    (iii) include in the Proxy Statement (1) the
recommendation of the Board that stockholders of the Company vote in favor of
the approval of the Merger and the adoption of this Agreement, unless such
recommendation has been withdrawn, or as such recommendation has been modified
or amended, in each case in accordance with Section 5.2, and (2) the opinion of
Morgan Keegan (the "Financial Advisor") described in Section 3.20.

                           (b) Parent shall provide the Company with the
information concerning Parent and Merger Sub required to be included in the
Proxy Statement. Parent shall vote, or cause to be voted, all of the Shares (if
any) then owned by it, Merger Sub or any of its other subsidiaries and
affiliates in favor of the approval of the Merger and the adoption of this
Agreement.

                                   ARTICLE II

                     CONVERSION OF SECURITIES; OPTION OFFER

                  Section 2.1 Conversion of Capital Stock. As of the Effective
Time, by virtue of the Merger and without any action on the part of the holders
of any shares of Company Common Stock or of the common stock, par value $.0l per
share, of Merger Sub (the "Merger Sub Common Stock"):

                           (a) Merger Sub Common Stock. Each issued and
outstanding share of Merger Sub Common Stock shall be converted into and become
one validly issued, fully paid and nonassessable share of common stock, par
value $.0l per share, of the Surviving Corporation.

                           (b) Cancellation of Treasury Stock and Parent-Owned
Stock. All shares of Company Common Stock that are owned by the Company as
treasury stock, all shares of Company Common Stock owned by any subsidiary of
the Company and any shares of Company Common Stock owned by Parent, Merger Sub
or any other wholly owned subsidiary of Parent shall be canceled and retired and
shall cease to exist and no consideration shall be delivered in exchange
therefor.

                           (c) Conversion of Shares. Each issued and outstanding
share of Company Common Stock, other than Shares to be canceled in accordance
with Section 2.1(b) hereof and any Dissenting Shares (as defined in Section 2.3
hereof), shall be converted into the right to receive the Merger Consideration
in cash, without interest, payable to the holder thereof upon surrender of the
certificate formerly representing such share of Company Common Stock in the


                                       3
<PAGE>

manner provided in Section 2.2 hereof. All such shares of Company Common Stock,
when so converted, shall no longer be outstanding and shall automatically be
canceled and retired and shall cease to exist, and each holder of a certificate
representing any such Shares shall cease to have any rights with respect
thereto, except the right to receive the Merger Consideration therefor upon the
surrender of such certificate in accordance with Section 2.2 hereof, without
interest.

                  Section 2.2 Exchange of Certificates.

                           (a) Paying Agent. Prior to the Effective Time, Parent
shall designate a bank or trust company (the "Paying Agent") reasonably
acceptable to the Company to make the payments of the funds to which holders of
shares of Company Common Stock shall become entitled pursuant to Section 2.1(c)
hereof. When and as needed, Parent shall deposit with the Paying Agent such
funds in trust for the benefit of holders of shares of Company Common Stock for
exchange in accordance with Section 2.1, for timely payment hereunder. Such
funds shall be invested by the Paying Agent as directed by Parent. Any net
profit resulting from, or interest or income produced by, such investments will
be payable to Parent.

                           (b) Exchange Procedures. As promptly as practicable
after the Effective Time but in no event more than ten (10) days thereafter,
Parent shall cause the Paying Agent to mail to each holder of record of a
certificate or certificates, which immediately prior to the Effective Time
represented outstanding shares of Company Common Stock (the "Certificates"),
whose shares were converted pursuant to Section 2.1(c) into the right to receive
the Merger Consideration, (i) a letter of transmittal (which shall specify that
delivery shall be effected, and risk of loss and title to the Certificates shall
pass, only upon delivery of the Certificates to the Paying Agent and shall be in
such form and have such other provisions as Parent and the Surviving Corporation
may reasonably specify) and (ii) instructions for use in effecting the surrender
of the Certificates in exchange for payment of the Merger Consideration. Upon
surrender of a Certificate for cancellation to the Paying Agent, together with
such letter of transmittal, duly executed, the holder of such Certificate shall
be entitled to receive in exchange therefor the Merger Consideration (subject to
subsection (e) below) multiplied by the number of shares of Company Common Stock
formerly represented by such Certificate and the Certificate so surrendered
shall forthwith be canceled. If payment of the Merger Consideration is to be
made to a person other than the person in whose name the surrendered Certificate
is registered, it shall be a condition of payment that the Certificate so
surrendered shall be properly endorsed or shall be otherwise in proper form for
transfer and that the person requesting such payment shall have paid any
transfer and other taxes required by reason of the payment of the Merger
Consideration to a person other than the registered holder of the Certificate
surrendered or shall have established to the satisfaction of the Surviving
Corporation that such tax either has been paid or is not applicable. Until
surrendered as contemplated by this Section 2.2, each Certificate shall be
deemed at any time after the Effective Time to represent only the right to
receive the Merger Consideration in cash as contemplated by this Section 2.2.

                           (c) Transfer Books; No Further Ownership Rights in
Company Common Stock. At the Effective Time, the stock transfer books of the
Company shall be closed and thereafter there shall be no further registration of
transfers of shares of Company Common Stock on the records of the Company. From
and after the Effective Time, the holders of Certificates evidencing ownership


                                       4
<PAGE>

of shares of Company Common Stock outstanding immediately prior to the Effective
Time shall cease to have any rights with respect to such Shares, except as
otherwise provided for herein or by applicable law. If, after the Effective
Time, Certificates are presented to the Surviving Corporation for any reason,
they shall be canceled and exchanged for Merger Consideration in the proper
amount of cash as provided in this Article II.

                           (d) Return of Funds; No Liability. At any time
following 270 calendar days after the Effective Time, Parent or the Surviving
Corporation shall be entitled to require the Paying Agent to deliver to it any
funds (including any interest received with respect thereto) which had been
deposited with the Paying Agent and which have not been disbursed to holders of
Certificates, and thereafter such holders shall be entitled to look only to
Parent or the Surviving Corporation (subject to abandoned property, escheat or
other similar laws) as general creditors thereof with respect to the payment of
any Merger Consideration that may be payable upon surrender of any Certificates
such stockholder holds, as determined pursuant to this Agreement, without any
interest thereon. Notwithstanding the foregoing, none of Parent, the Surviving
Corporation nor the Paying Agent shall be liable to any holder of a Certificate
for Merger Consideration delivered to a public official pursuant to any
applicable abandoned property, escheat or similar law.

                           (e) Withholding Taxes. Parent, the Surviving
Corporation and the Paying Agent shall be entitled to deduct and withhold from
the consideration otherwise payable to a holder of Shares pursuant to the Merger
such amounts as Parent, the Surviving Corporation or the Paying Agent is
required to deduct and withhold with respect to the making of such payment under
the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the "Code") or any provision of
state, local or foreign tax law. To the extent amounts are so withheld by
Parent, the Surviving Corporation or the Paying Agent, the withheld amounts
shall be treated for all purposes of this Agreement as having been paid to the
holder of the Shares in respect of which the deduction and withholding was made.

                  Section 2.3 Dissenting Shares. Notwithstanding any provision
of this Agreement to the contrary, if and to the extent required by the DGCL,
shares of Company Common Stock which are issued and outstanding immediately
prior to the Effective Time and which are held by holders of such shares of
Company Common Stock who have properly exercised appraisal rights with respect
thereto (the "Dissenting Shares") in accordance with Section 262 of the DGCL,
shall not be exchangeable for the right to receive the Merger Consideration, and
holders of such Dissenting Shares shall be entitled to receive payment of the
appraised value of such Dissenting Shares in accordance with the provisions of
Section 262 of the DGCL unless and until such holders fail to perfect or
effectively withdraw or otherwise lose their rights to appraisal and payment
under the DGCL. If, after the Effective Time, any such holder fails to perfect


                                       5
<PAGE>

or effectively withdraws or loses such right, such Dissenting Shares shall
thereupon be treated as if they had been converted into and to have become
exchangeable for, at the Effective Time, the right to receive the Merger
Consideration, without any interest thereon. Notwithstanding anything to the
contrary contained in this Section 2.3, if this Agreement is terminated prior to
the Effective Time, then the right of any stockholder to be paid the fair value
of such stockholder's Dissenting Shares pursuant to Section 262 of the DGCL
shall cease. The Company shall give Parent (i) prompt notice of any demands
received by the Company for appraisal of Dissenting Shares, withdrawals of such
demands and any other instruments served pursuant to the DGCL which are received
by the Company, and (ii) the opportunity to direct all negotiations and
proceedings with respect to demands for appraisal under the DGCL. The Company
shall not, except with the prior written consent of Parent, make any payment
with respect to any demands for appraisal or offer to settle or settle any such
demands.

                  Section 2.4 Company Option Plans.

                           (a) On such date as is determined by the mutual
agreement of the Company and Parent, which shall be no later than the date the
Proxy Statement is mailed to the Company's stockholders, the Company shall
commence an offer (the "Option Offer") to purchase, from the holders thereof,
all outstanding options to purchase shares of Company Common Stock ("Company
Stock Options"), whether vested or unvested (except for unvested Company Stock
Options granted pursuant to the 1996 Outside Directors Equity Plan, which shall
not be included in the Option Offer and which shall terminate, in accordance
with their terms, at the Effective Time), for an aggregate price not in excess
of $19,500,000 and at a price per option (subject to any applicable withholding
taxes) determined in accordance with Exhibit B hereto. The Option Offer shall
require each optionholder to tender all Company Stock Options owned by such
optionholder at the time of his or her tender in order to participate in the
Option Offer. In making the Option Offer, the Company shall, and shall cause all
documents related to the Option Offer which are filed with the SEC and/or
published, sent or given to holders of Company Stock Options (collectively, the
"Option Offer Documents") to, comply in all respects with the provisions of
applicable federal securities laws (including, without limitation, the
provisions of the Exchange Act, and the rules and regulations promulgated
thereunder, that relate to going private transactions under Rule 13e-3 of the
Exchange Act and issuer tender offers) and state law. On the date any Option
Offer Documents are filed with the SEC and on the date any Option Offer
Documents are first published, sent or given to holders of Company Stock
Options, such documents shall not contain any untrue statement of a material
fact or omit to state any material fact required to be stated therein or
necessary in order to make the statements therein, in light of the circumstances
under which they were made, not misleading, except that no representation is
made by the Company with respect to information supplied by or on behalf of
Parent or Merger Sub for inclusion in the Option Offer Documents. The Company
shall not file with the SEC or otherwise provide to holders of Company Stock
Options any documents related to the Option Offer without the prior review and
approval of such documents by Parent and Merger Sub, nor waive any conditions to
the Option Offer (which conditions must be approved by Parent and Merger Sub)
without the prior approval of Parent and Merger Sub. In addition, the Company
shall provide Parent and Merger Sub and their counsel in writing with any
comments the Company or its counsel may receive from the SEC or its staff with
respect to any of the Offer Documents promptly after receipt of such comments
and a reasonable opportunity to participate in the preparation of any responses
thereto by the Company or its counsel, including copies of any written responses
and telephonic notification of any verbal responses.

                           (b) The Board of Directors of the Company (or, if
appropriate, any committee thereof) shall adopt such resolutions and take such
other action as may be necessary to (i) cancel all Company Stock Options
purchased by the Company pursuant to Section 2.4(a) immediately following such


                                       6

purchase, (ii) terminate, as of the Effective Time, any plan, program or
arrangement providing for the issuance or grant of any interest in respect of
the capital stock of the Company or any subsidiary of the Company, other than,
to the extent Company Stock Options remain outstanding thereunder immediately
prior to the Effective Time, the Company's 1991 Employee Stock Incentive Plan,
1994 Director's Equity Plan, 1996 Outside Directors Equity Plan, and 1997
Employee Stock Incentive Plan (the "Option Plans"), and (iii) provide that
following the Effective Time no participant in any such plan, program or
arrangement shall have any right thereunder to acquire capital securities of
Parent or, except for any Company Stock Options which remain outstanding under
the Option Plans immediately prior to the Effective Time, the Surviving
Corporation.

                                  ARTICLE III

                  REPRESENTATIONS AND WARRANTIES OF THE COMPANY

          The Company represents and warrants to Parent and Merger Sub
as follows:

                  Section 3.1 Corporate Organization. Each of the Company and
its subsidiaries is a corporation duly organized, validly existing and in good
standing under the laws of the jurisdiction of its organization and has the
requisite corporate power and authority to own or lease all of its properties
and assets and to carry on its business as it is now being conducted. Each of
the Company and its subsidiaries is duly licensed or qualified to do business in
each jurisdiction in which the nature of the business conducted by it or the
character or location of the properties and assets owned or leased by it makes
such licensing or qualification necessary, except where the failure to be so
licensed or qualified would not reasonably be expected to have, individually or
when aggregated with all other such failures, a Material Adverse Effect (as
defined below) on the Company ("Company Material Adverse Effect"). The copies of
the Certificate of Incorporation and Bylaws of the Company (the "Company
Charter" and "Company Bylaws"), in the form delivered to Merger Sub and Parent,
are true, complete and correct copies of such documents as in effect as of the
date of this Agreement. As used in this Agreement, the term "Material Adverse
Effect" means, with respect to the Company, on the one hand, or Parent, on the
other hand, a material adverse effect on (i) the ability of the Company, on the
one hand, or Parent and Merger Sub, on the other hand, to consummate the
transactions contemplated hereby, or (ii) the business, results of operations,
properties, assets, liabilities or financial condition of such party and its
subsidiaries, taken as a whole, except to the extent such material adverse
effect under this clause (ii) results from (A) any changes in general United
States or global economic conditions, (B) any changes in general economic
conditions in industries in which such party and its subsidiaries operate, which
changes do not affect such party disproportionately relative to other entities
operating in such industries, or (C) any decline in the market price of the
common stock of such party. For purposes of analyzing whether any state of
facts, change, development, effect, occurrence or condition has resulted in a
Company Material Adverse Effect, Parent and Merger Sub will not be deemed to
have knowledge of any state of facts, change, development, effect, occurrence or
condition relating to the Company or its subsidiaries unless it is disclosed in
the Company's SEC Documents or the Company Disclosure Schedule (as defined


                                       7
<PAGE>

below). As used in this Agreement, the word "subsidiary" when used with respect
to any party means any corporation, partnership or other organization, whether
incorporated or unincorporated, (i) of which at least a majority of the
securities or other interests having by their terms voting power to elect a
majority of the board of directors or others performing similar functions with
respect to such corporation or other organization is directly or indirectly
beneficially owned or controlled by such party or by any one or more of its
subsidiaries, or by such party and one or more of its subsidiaries, or (ii) that
would be required to be consolidated in such party's financial statements under
generally accepted accounting principles as adopted (whether or not yet
effective) in the United States.

                  Section 3.2 Capitalization.

                           (a) The authorized capital stock of the Company
consists of 200,000,000 shares of Company Common Stock, par value $0.10 per
share. At the date hereof, there were (i) 136,134,319 shares of Company Common
Stock issued and outstanding, and (ii) 5,944,718 shares of Company Common Stock
issuable upon the exercise of outstanding Company Stock Options (whether or not
presently exercisable) pursuant to the Option Plans. All of the issued and
outstanding shares of Company Stock have been, and any shares of Company Common
Stock issued upon the exercise of Company Stock Options will be, duly authorized
and validly issued and are or will be fully paid, nonassessable and free of
preemptive rights. Except as set forth above or in Section 3.2(a) of the
Company's disclosure schedule delivered to Parent concurrently with the
execution of this Agreement (the "Company Disclosure Schedule"), as of the date
hereof, there are not, and as of the Effective Time there will not be, any
outstanding securities, options, warrants, calls, rights, commitments,
agreements, derivative contracts, forward sale contracts or undertakings of any
kind to which the Company or any of its subsidiaries is a party, or by which the
Company or any of its subsidiaries is bound, obligating the Company or any of
its subsidiaries to issue, deliver or sell, or cause to be issued, delivered or
sold, additional shares of capital stock or other voting securities of the
Company or of any subsidiary of the Company or obligating the Company or any
subsidiary of the Company to issue, grant, extend or enter into any such
security, option, warrant, call, right, commitment, agreement, derivative
contract, forward sale contract or undertaking, or obligating the Company to
make any payment based on or resulting from the value or price of the Company
Common Stock or of any such security, option, warrant, call, right, commitment,
agreement, derivative contract, forward sale contract or undertaking. There are
no outstanding contractual obligations of the Company or any of its subsidiaries
to repurchase, redeem or otherwise acquire any shares of capital stock of the
Company or any of its subsidiaries.

                           (b) The Company owns, directly or indirectly, all of
the issued and outstanding shares of capital stock of each of its subsidiaries,
free and clear of any liens, charges, encumbrances, adverse rights or claims and
security interests whatsoever ("Liens"), and all of such shares are duly
authorized and validly issued and are fully paid, nonassessable and free of
preemptive rights.

                           (c) Disclosed in Section 3.2(c) of the Company
Disclosure Schedule is a true and complete list of all outstanding Company Stock
Options, the exercise price therefor, and the holder thereof.

                  Section 3.3 Authority.

                           (a) The Company has all necessary corporate power and
authority to execute and deliver this Agreement and to consummate the
transactions contemplated hereby, subject to obtaining the approval of holders
of a majority of the outstanding shares of Company Common Stock (the "Company
Stockholder Approval") prior to the consummation of the Merger in accordance
with Section 251 of the DGCL. The Company Stockholder Approval is the only vote
of the holders of any class or series of the Company's securities necessary to
approve this Agreement, the Merger and the other transactions contemplated
hereby. The execution, delivery and performance by the Company of this
Agreement, and the consummation by it of the transactions contemplated hereby,
have been duly authorized by its Board of Directors and, except for obtaining
the approval of its stockholders as contemplated by Section 1.5 hereof and as
required by the DGCL, no other corporate action on the part of the Company is
necessary to authorize the execution and delivery by the Company of this
Agreement and the consummation by it of the transactions contemplated hereby.
This Agreement has been duly executed and delivered by the Company and, assuming
due and valid authorization, execution and delivery hereof by the other parties
thereto, constitutes a valid and binding obligation of the Company enforceable
against the Company in accordance with its terms, except that such
enforceability (i) may be limited by bankruptcy, insolvency, moratorium or other
similar laws affecting or relating to the enforcement of creditors' rights
generally and (ii) is subject to general principles of equity.

                           (b) The Board of Directors of the Company has
approved and taken all corporate action required to be taken by the Board of
Directors for the consummation by the Company of the transactions contemplated
by this Agreement.

                  Section 3.4 Consents and Approvals; No Violations.

                           (a) Except for (i) the consents and approvals set
forth in Section 3.4(a) of the Company Disclosure Schedule, (ii) the filing with
the SEC of the preliminary proxy statement, the Proxy Statement and any of the
Offer Documents required to be so filed, (iii) the filing of the Certificate of
Merger with the Secretary of State pursuant to the DGCL, (iv) the Company
Stockholder Approval and (v) filings, permits, authorizations, consents and
approvals as may be required under, and other applicable requirements of, (A)
the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the "Exchange Act"), and (B)
the Hart-Scott-Rodino Antitrust Improvements Act of 1976, as amended (the "HSR
Act"), no consents or approvals of, or filings, declarations or registrations
with, any federal, state or local court, administrative or regulatory agency or
commission or other governmental authority or instrumentality, domestic or
foreign (each a "Governmental Entity"), are necessary for the consummation by
the Company of the transactions contemplated hereby or by the Stockholders
Agreement, other than such other consents, approvals, filings, declarations or
registrations that, if not obtained, made or given, would not reasonably be
expected to have, individually or in the aggregate, a Company Material Adverse
Effect.

                           (b) Except as set forth in Section 3.4(b) of the
Company Disclosure Schedule, neither the execution and delivery of this
Agreement by the Company nor the consummation by the Company of the transactions
contemplated hereby, nor compliance by the Company with any of the terms or
provisions hereof, nor the consummation of the transactions contemplated by the


                                       9
<PAGE>

Stockholders Agreement or compliance with the terms and provisions thereof, will
(i) conflict with or violate any provision of the Company Charter or Company
Bylaws or any of the similar organizational documents of any of its subsidiaries
or (ii) assuming that the authorizations, consents and approvals referred to in
Section 3.4(a) and the authorization hereof by the Company's stockholders are
duly obtained in accordance with the DGCL, (x) violate any statute, code,
ordinance, rule, regulation, judgment, order, writ, decree or injunction
applicable to the Company or any of its subsidiaries or any of their respective
properties or assets, or (y) violate, conflict with, result in the loss of any
material benefit under, constitute a default (or an event which, with notice or
lapse of time, or both, would constitute a default) under, result in the
termination of or a right of termination or cancellation under, accelerate the
performance required by, or result in the creation of any Lien upon any of the
respective properties or assets of the Company or any of its subsidiaries under,
any of the terms, conditions or provisions of any note, bond, mortgage,
indenture, deed of trust, license, lease, agreement or other instrument or
obligation to which the Company or any of its subsidiaries is a party, or by
which they or any of their respective properties or assets may be bound or
affected, except, in the case of clause (ii) above, for such violations,
conflicts, breaches, defaults, losses, terminations of rights thereof,
accelerations or Lien creations which, individually or in the aggregate, would
not reasonably be expected to have a Company Material Adverse Effect.

                  Section 3.5 SEC Documents; Undisclosed Liabilities. The
Company has filed all required registration statements, prospectuses, reports,
schedules, forms, statements and other documents required to be filed by it with
the SEC since January 1, 2001 (collectively, and in each case including all
exhibits, schedules and amendments thereto and documents incorporated by
reference therein, the "SEC Documents"). No subsidiary of the Company is
required to file any registration statement, prospectus, report, schedule, form,
statement or other document with the SEC. As of their respective dates, the SEC
Documents complied in all material respects with the requirements of the
Securities Act of 1933, as amended (the "Securities Act"), or the Exchange Act,
as the case may be, and the rules and regulations of the SEC promulgated
thereunder applicable to such SEC Documents, and none of the SEC Documents
(including any and all financial statements included therein) as of such dates
contained any untrue statement of a material fact or omitted to state a material
fact required to be stated therein or necessary in order to make the statements
therein, in light of the circumstances under which they were made, not
misleading. The consolidated financial statements of the Company included in the
SEC Documents (the "SEC Financial Statements") comply as to form in all material
respects with applicable accounting requirements and the published rules and
regulations of the SEC with respect thereto, have been prepared in accordance
with generally accepted accounting principles ("GAAP") (except, in the case of
unaudited consolidated quarterly statements, as permitted by Form 10-Q of the
SEC) applied on a consistent basis during the periods involved (except as may be
indicated in the notes thereto) and fairly present in all material respects the
consolidated financial position of the Company and its consolidated subsidiaries
as of the dates thereof and the consolidated results of their operations and
cash flows for the periods then ended (subject, in the case of unaudited


                                       10
<PAGE>

quarterly statements, to normal year-end audit adjustments). Since June 30,
2002, neither the Company nor any of its subsidiaries, has incurred any
liabilities or obligations of any nature (whether accrued, absolute, contingent
or otherwise) required, if known, to be reflected or reserved against on a
consolidated balance sheet of the Company prepared in accordance with GAAP
except (i) as and to the extent set forth on the audited balance sheet of the
Company and its subsidiaries as of June 30, 2002 (including the notes thereto)
included in the SEC Documents, (ii) as incurred in connection with the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement, (iii) as incurred after June 30,
2002 in the ordinary course of business and consistent with past practice, (iv)
as described in the SEC Documents filed since June 30, 2002 (the "Recent SEC
Documents"), or (v) as would not, individually or in the aggregate, have a
Company Material Adverse Effect. If, at any time prior to the Effective Time,
the Company shall obtain knowledge of any material facts that would require
supplementing or amending any of the foregoing documents in order to make the
statements therein, in the light of the circumstances under which they were
made, not misleading, or to comply with applicable laws, such amendment or
supplement shall be promptly filed with the SEC and, as required by law,
disseminated to the stockholders of the Company. The management of the Company
has (i) designed disclosure controls and procedures to ensure that material
information relating to the Company, including its consolidated subsidiaries, is
made known to the management of the Company by others within those entities, and
(ii) has disclosed, based on its most recent evaluation, to the Company's
auditors and the audit committee of the Company's Board of Directors (A) all
significant deficiencies in the design or operation of internal controls which
could adversely affect the Company's ability to record, process, summarize and
report financial data and have identified for the Company's auditors any
material weaknesses in internal controls and (B) any fraud, whether or not
material, that involves management or other employees who have a significant
role in the Company's internal controls. A summary of such disclosure made by
management to the Company's auditors and audit committee is set forth on Section
3.5 of the Company Disclosure Schedule.

                  Section 3.6 Broker's Fees. Except for the Financial Advisor's
fee set forth in Section 3.6 of the Company Disclosure Schedule, neither the
Company nor any subsidiary of the Company nor any of their respective officers
or directors on behalf of the Company or such subsidiaries has employed any
financial advisor, broker or finder or incurred any liability for any financial
advisory fee, broker's fees, commissions or finder's fees in connection with any
of the transactions contemplated hereby.

                  Section 3.7 Absence of Certain Changes or Events. Except as
set forth in the Recent SEC Documents filed prior to the date hereof, since June
30, 2002, the Company and its subsidiaries have conducted their businesses only
in the ordinary course and in a manner consistent with past practice and, since
such date, there has not been any event that, individually or in the aggregate,
has had or would reasonably be expected to have in the future a Company Material
Adverse Effect. Except as set forth in Section 3.7 of the Company Disclosure
Schedule, since June 30, 2002, neither the Company nor any of its subsidiaries
has taken, or failed to take, any action that would have constituted a breach of
Section 5.1 hereof had the covenants therein applied since that date.

                  Section 3.8 Legal Proceedings.

                           (a) Except as set forth in Section 3.8 of the Company
Disclosure Schedule, there is no action, suit or proceeding, claim, arbitration
or investigation pending or, to the Company's knowledge, threatened against the


                                       11
<PAGE>

Company or any of its subsidiaries, and neither the Company nor any or its
subsidiaries is a party to any action, suit or proceeding, arbitration or
investigation, which, individually or in the aggregate, would reasonably be
expected to have a Company Material Adverse Effect.

                           (b) There is no injunction, order, judgment, decree
or regulatory restriction imposed upon the Company, any of its subsidiaries or
the assets of the Company or any of its subsidiaries which, individually or when
aggregated with all other such injunctions, orders, judgments, decrees and
restrictions, would reasonably be expected to have a Company Material Adverse
Effect.

                  Section 3.9 Compliance with Applicable Law. Except as
disclosed in Section 3.9 of the Company Disclosure Schedule, the Company and
each of its subsidiaries hold all material licenses, franchises, permits and
authorizations necessary for the lawful conduct of their respective businesses
as presently conducted and are in compliance with the terms thereof, except
where the failure to hold such license, franchise, permit or authorization or
such noncompliance would not, individually or when aggregated with all other
such failures or noncompliance, reasonably be expected to have a Company
Material Adverse Effect, and neither the Company nor any of its subsidiaries
knows of, or has received notice of, any material violations of any applicable
law, statute, order, rule, regulation, policy and/or guideline of any
Governmental Entity relating to the Company or any of its subsidiaries, which,
individually or in the aggregate, would reasonably be expected to have a Company
Material Adverse Effect.

                  Section 3.10 Company Information. The information relating to
the Company and its subsidiaries to be provided by or on behalf of the Company
for inclusion in the Proxy Statement and the Option Offer Documents, or in any
other document filed with any other Governmental Entity in connection herewith
at the respective times filed with the SEC or such other Governmental Entity and
first published, sent or given to stockholders of the Company and, in addition,
in the case of the Proxy Statement, at the date it or any amendment or
supplement is mailed to holders of the shares of Company Common Stock, at the
time of the Special Meeting and at the Effective Time, will not contain any
untrue statement of a material fact or omit to state a material fact necessary
to make the statements therein, in light of the circumstances in which they are
made, not misleading (except that no representation is made by the Company to
such portions thereof that relate expressly to Parent, Merger Sub or any of
their subsidiaries or to statements made therein based on information supplied
by or on behalf of Parent or Merger Sub for inclusion therein). The Proxy
Statement and the Option Offer Documents required to be filed with the SEC will
comply as to form in all material respects with the provisions of the Exchange
Act and the rules and regulations thereunder.

                  Section 3.11 Employee Matters.

                           (a) The Company has delivered or made available to
Parent full and complete copies or descriptions of each material employment,
severance, bonus, change-in-control, profit sharing, compensation, termination,
stock option, stock appreciation right, restricted stock, phantom stock,
performance unit, pension, retirement, deferred compensation, welfare or other
employee benefit agreement, trust fund or other arrangement and any union, guild
or collective bargaining agreement maintained or contributed to or required to
be contributed to by the Company or any of its ERISA Affiliates (as defined
below), for the benefit or welfare of any director, officer, employee or former


                                       12
<PAGE>

employee of the Company or any of its ERISA Affiliates (such plans and
arrangements being collectively the "Company Benefit Plans"). Each of the
Company Benefit Plans is in material compliance with all applicable laws
including the Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974, as amended
("ERISA"), and the Code except where such noncompliance would not reasonably be
expected to have a Company Material Adverse Effect. The Internal Revenue Service
has determined that each Company Benefit Plan that is intended to be a qualified
plan under Section 401(a) of the Code is so qualified as to form and the Company
is aware of no event occurring after the date of such determination that would
adversely affect such determination. The liabilities accrued under each such
plan are reflected on the latest balance sheet of the Company included in the
Recent SEC Reports in accordance with GAAP applied on a consistent basis. No
condition exists that is reasonably likely to subject the Company or any of its
subsidiaries to any direct or indirect liability under Title IV of ERISA or to a
civil penalty under Section 502(j) of ERISA or liability under Section 4069 of
ERISA or 4975, 4976, or 4980B of the Code or other liability with respect to the
Company Benefit Plans that would have a Company Material Adverse Effect and that
is not reflected on such balance sheet or, except as set forth in Section
3.11(a) of the Company Disclosure Schedule, that is reasonably likely to result
in any loss of a federal tax deduction under Section 280G of the Code. There are
no pending or to the Company's knowledge, threatened, claims (other than routine
claims for benefits or immaterial claims) by, on behalf of or against any of the
Company Benefit Plans or any trusts related thereto except where such claims
would not reasonably be expected to have a Company Material Adverse Effect.
"ERISA Affiliate" means, with respect to any person, any trade or business,
whether or not incorporated, that together with such person would be deemed a
"single employer" within the meaning of Section 4001(a)(15) of the ERISA.

                           (b) Neither the Company nor any of its subsidiaries
is a party to, or bound by, any collective bargaining agreement or other
contract or understanding with a labor union or labor organization. Except for
such matters that would not reasonably be expected to have, individually or in
the aggregate, a Company Material Adverse Effect, there is no (i) unfair labor
practice, labor dispute or labor arbitration proceeding pending, (ii) to the
knowledge of the Company, any activity or proceeding by a labor union or
representative thereof to organize any employees of the Company or any of its
subsidiaries or (iii) lockout, strike, slowdown, work stoppage or, to the
knowledge of the Company, threat thereof by or with respect to such employees.

                  Section 3.12 Environmental Matters. Except as set forth in
Section 3.12 of the Company's Disclosure Schedule, there are no legal,
administrative, arbitral or other proceedings, claims, actions, causes of
action, required environmental remediation activities or, to the knowledge of
the Company, governmental investigations of any nature seeking to impose, or
that reasonably would be expected to result in the imposition, on the Company or
any of its subsidiaries of any liability or obligations arising under common law
standards relating to environmental protection, human health or safety, or under
any local, state, federal, national or supernational environmental statute,
regulation or ordinance, including the Comprehensive Environmental Response,
Compensation and Liability Act of 1980, as amended (collectively, "Environmental
Laws"), pending or, to the knowledge of the Company, threatened, against the
Company or any of its subsidiaries, which liability or obligation would have or
would reasonably be expected to have a Company Material Adverse Effect. To the


                                       13
<PAGE>

knowledge of the Company, during or prior to the period of (i) its or any of its
subsidiaries' ownership or operation of any of their respective current
properties, (ii) its or any of its subsidiaries' participation in the management
of any property, or (iii) its or any of its subsidiaries' holding of a security
interest or other interest in any property, there was no release or threatened
release of hazardous, toxic, radioactive or dangerous materials or other
materials regulated under Environmental Laws in, on, under or affecting any such
property which would reasonably be expected to have a Company Material Adverse
Effect. Neither the Company nor any of its subsidiaries is subject to any
agreement, order, judgment, decree, letter or memorandum by or with any court,
governmental authority, regulatory agency or third party imposing any material
liability or obligations pursuant to or under any Environmental Law that would
have or would reasonably be expected to have a Company Material Adverse Effect.

                  Section 3.13 Takeover Statutes. The Company has taken all
actions necessary such that no restrictive provision of any "fair price,"
"moratorium," "control share acquisition," "interested shareholder" or other
similar anti-takeover statute or regulation (including, without limitation,
Section 203 of the DGCL) (each a "Takeover Statute") or restrictive provision of
any applicable anti-takeover provision in the governing documents of the Company
is, or at the Effective Time will be, applicable to the Company, Parent, Merger
Sub, the shares of Company Common Stock (including shares of Company Common
Stock acquired in the Merger), the Merger or any other transaction contemplated
by this Agreement or the Stockholders Agreement.

                  Section 3.14 Properties. Except (a) as disclosed in the Recent
SEC Documents or in the notes to the latest audited financial statements
included in the SEC Documents and (b) for any of the following which would not
have a Company Material Adverse Effect, each of the Company and its subsidiaries
(i) has good and indefeasible title to all the properties and assets reflected
on the latest audited balance sheet included in the SEC Documents as being owned
by the Company or one of its subsidiaries or acquired after the date thereof
which are, individually or in the aggregate, material to the Company's business
on a consolidated basis (except properties sold or otherwise disposed of since
the date thereof in the ordinary course of business), free and clear of (A) all
Liens except (1) statutory liens securing payments not yet due and (2) such
imperfections or irregularities of title or other Liens (other than real
property mortgages or deeds of trust) as do not materially affect the use of the
properties or assets subject thereto or affected thereby or otherwise materially
impair business operations at such properties, and (B) all real property
mortgages and deeds of trust except such secured indebtedness as is properly
reflected in the latest audited balance sheet included in the SEC Documents, and
(ii) is the lessee of all leasehold estates reflected in the latest audited
financial statements included in the SEC Documents or acquired after the date
thereof which are material to its business on a consolidated basis and is in
possession of the properties purported to be leased thereunder, and each such

the event that the Board of Directors of the Company determines in good faith,
in response to a Superior Proposal that was unsolicited and made after the date
hereof in circumstances not otherwise involving a breach of this Agreement,
after considering applicable provisions of state law and after consultation with
outside counsel, that the failure to do so would be inconsistent with its

Board of Directors of the Company has received a Superior Proposal, specifying
the material terms and conditions of such Superior Proposal, identifying the
person making such Superior Proposal and providing notice of the determination
of the Board of Directors of the Company of what action referred to herein the
Board of Directors of the Company has determined to take, and further provided,
that the action described in clause (z) may be taken only upon compliance by the
Company with Section 7.1(c)(ii) and Section 7.3.

                           (c) In addition to the obligations of the Company set

developments which could reasonably be expected to culminate in the Board of
Directors of the Company withdrawing, modifying or amending its recommendation
of this Agreement, the Merger and the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement, or in exercising any of its other rights under Section 5.2(a) or (b).

                           (d) Nothing contained in this Section 5.2 or Section

except as in accordance with Section 5.2(b), withdraw or modify, or propose
publicly to withdraw or modify, its approval, determination or recommendation of

<PAGE>

this Agreement, the Merger and the other transactions contemplated hereby or
approve, determine to be advisable, or recommend, or propose publicly to
approve, determine to be advisable, or recommend, a Takeover Proposal.

proposal or offer from any person (other than Parent and its subsidiaries,

or purchase of 15% or more of the assets of the Company or any of its
subsidiaries or 15% or more of any class of equity securities of the Company or
any of its subsidiaries, any tender offer or exchange offer that if consummated
would result in any person beneficially owning 15% or more of any class of
equity securities of the Company or any of its subsidiaries, or any merger,
consolidation, share exchange, business combination, recapitalization,
liquidation, dissolution or similar transaction involving the Company or any of
its subsidiaries, other than the transactions contemplated by this Agreement.

                                    (ii) "Superior Proposal" means a bona fide
written offer from any person (other than Parent and its subsidiaries,

of 50% or more of the assets of the Company or any of its subsidiaries or 50% or
more of any class of equity securities of the Company or any of its

securities of the Company or any of its subsidiaries, or any merger,
consolidation, share exchange, business combination, recapitalization,
liquidation, dissolution or similar transaction involving the Company or any of
its subsidiaries (other than the transactions contemplated by this Agreement)
(A) which provides for consideration on a per share basis to the stockholders of
the Company with a value (taking into account, among other things, the
likelihood of such offer resulting in a consummated transaction) exceeding the
Merger Consideration, (B) which, considering all relevant factors, is more
favorable to the Company and its stockholders than the Merger, and (C) for which
the third party has demonstrated that the financing for such offer is fully
committed or is reasonably likely to be obtained, in each case as determined by
the Board of Directors in its good faith judgment (based on the advice of
independent financial advisors and outside counsel).

                  Section 5.3 Publicity. The initial press release with respect

in effect, none of the Company, Parent or Merger Sub, nor any of their
respective affiliates shall issue or cause the publication of any press release
or other announcement with respect to the Merger, this Agreement or the other
transactions contemplated hereby without the prior consultation of the other
parties, except as may be required by law or by any listing agreement with a
national securities exchange as determined in the good faith judgment of the
party wanting to make such release.

                  Section 5.4 Notification of Certain Matters. The Company shall
give prompt notice to Parent if any of the following occur after the date of
this Agreement: (i) receipt of any notice or other communication in writing from

<PAGE>

with the transactions contemplated by this Agreement; or (iii) the occurrence of
an event which would or would be reasonably likely in the future to (A) have a
Company Material Adverse Effect or prevent or delay the consummation of the
Merger or (B) cause any condition to the Merger to be unsatisfied; provided,
however, that the delivery of any notice pursuant to this Section 5.4 shall not
limit or otherwise affect the remedies of Parent and Merger Sub available
hereunder.

                  Section 5.5 Access to Information.

                           (a) Upon reasonable notice and subject to applicable
laws relating to the exchange of information, the Company shall, and shall cause
each of its subsidiaries to, afford to the officers, employees, accountants,

                           (b) No investigation by any of the parties or their
respective representatives shall affect the representations, warranties,
covenants or agreements of any other party set forth herein.

                           (c) The information provided pursuant to Section
5.5(a) shall be used solely for the purpose of the transactions contemplated

be kept confidential by Parent and Merger Sub, except that the information
provided pursuant to Section 5.5(a) or portions thereof may be disclosed to

                  Section 5.6 Further Assurances.

                           (a) Subject to the terms and conditions of this
Agreement, each of Parent and the Company shall, and shall cause its
subsidiaries to, use all reasonable efforts (i) to take, or cause to be taken,
all actions necessary, proper or advisable to comply promptly with all legal
requirements which may be imposed on such party or its subsidiaries with respect
to the Merger and, subject to the conditions set forth in Article VI hereof, to
consummate the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, including, without
limitation, the Merger, as promptly as practicable and (ii) to obtain (and to


                                       23
<PAGE>

cooperate with the other party to obtain) any consent, authorization, order or
approval of, or any exemption by, any Governmental Entity and any other third
party which is required to be obtained by the Company or Parent or any of their
respective subsidiaries in connection with the Merger and the other transactions
contemplated by this Agreement, and to comply with the terms and conditions of
any such consent, authorization, order or approval.

                           (b) Subject to the terms and conditions of this
Agreement, each of Parent and the Company shall use all reasonable efforts to
take, or cause to be taken, all actions, and to do, or cause to be done, all
things necessary, proper or advisable to consummate and make effective, as soon
as practicable after the date of this Agreement, the transactions contemplated
hereby, including, without limitation, using all reasonable efforts to lift or
rescind any injunction or restraining order or other order adversely affecting
the ability of the parties to consummate the transactions contemplated hereby
and using all reasonable efforts to defend any litigation seeking to enjoin,
prevent or delay the consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby or
seeking material damages.

                           (c) Notwithstanding subsections (a) and (b) of this
section or any other provision of this Agreement to the contrary, in no event
shall Parent or Merger Sub be required to agree to (i) any prohibition of or
limitation on the ownership or operation by Parent, Merger Sub, the Company or
any of their respective subsidiaries or affiliates of any portion of their
respective businesses or assets, (ii) divest, hold separate or otherwise dispose
of any portion of its or their respective businesses or assets, (iii) any
limitation on the ability of Parent, Merger Sub, the Company or any of their
respective subsidiaries, as the case may be, to acquire or hold, or exercise
full rights of ownership of, the Company Common Stock and any capital stock of
any subsidiary of the Company, or (iv) any other limitation on Parent's, Merger
Sub's, the Company's or any of their respective subsidiaries' ability to
effectively control their respective businesses or operations.

                  Section 5.7 Indemnification.

                           (a) From and after the Effective Time, Parent shall,
and shall cause the Surviving Corporation to, indemnify, defend and hold
harmless each person who is now, or has been at any time prior to the date of
this Agreement or who becomes such prior to the Effective Time, an officer or
director of the Company or any of its subsidiaries (the "Indemnified Parties")
against (i) any and all losses, claims, damages, costs, expenses, fines,
liabilities or judgments or amounts that are paid in settlement with the
approval of the indemnifying party (which approval shall not be unreasonably
withheld) of or in connection with any claim, action, suit, proceeding or
investigation based in whole or in part on or arising in whole or in part out of
the fact that such person is or was a director or officer of the Company or any
of its subsidiaries whether pertaining to any action or omission existing or
occurring at or prior to the Effective Time and whether asserted or claimed
prior to, or at or after, the Effective Time ("Indemnified Liabilities"), and
(ii) all Indemnified Liabilities based in whole or in part on, or arising in
whole or in part out of, or pertaining to this Agreement or the transactions
contemplated hereby; provided, however, that, in the case of Merger Sub and the
Surviving Corporation such indemnification shall only be to the fullest extent a


                                       24
<PAGE>

corporation is permitted under the DGCL, as applicable, to indemnify its own
directors and officers, and in the case of Parent, such indemnification shall
not be limited by the DGCL but such indemnification shall not be applicable to
any claims made against the Indemnified Parties (A) if a judgment or other final
adjudication established that their acts or omissions were committed in bad
faith or were the result of active and deliberate dishonesty and were material
to the cause of action so deliberated or (B) arising out of, based upon or
attributable to the gaining in fact of any financial profit or other advantage
to which they were not legally entitled. Parent, Merger Sub, and the Surviving
Corporation, as the case may be, will pay all expenses of each Indemnified Party
in advance of the final disposition of any such action or proceeding to the
fullest extent permitted by law upon receipt of any undertaking contemplated by
Section 145(e) of the DGCL. Without limiting the foregoing, in the event any
such claim, action, suit, proceeding or investigation is brought against any
Indemnified Party (whether arising before or after the Effective Time), (i) the
Indemnified Parties may retain counsel satisfactory to them and Parent and
Merger Sub, (ii) Parent shall, or shall cause the Surviving Corporation to, pay
all reasonable fees and expenses of such counsel for the Indemnified Parties
promptly as statements therefor are received, and (iii) Parent shall, and shall
cause the Surviving Corporation to, use all reasonable efforts to assist in the
vigorous defense of any such matter, provided that none of Parent, Merger Sub or
the Surviving Corporation shall be liable for any settlement of any claim
effected without its written consent, which consent, however, shall not be
unreasonably withheld. Any Indemnified Party wishing to claim indemnification
under this Section 5.7, upon learning of any such claim, action, suit,
proceeding or investigation, shall notify Parent, Merger Sub or the Surviving
Corporation (but the failure so to notify an indemnifying party shall not
relieve it from any liability which it may have under this Section 5.7 except to
the extent such failure materially prejudices such party), and shall deliver to
Merger Sub and the Surviving Corporation the undertaking contemplated by Section
145(e) of the DGCL. The Indemnified Parties as a group may retain only one law
firm to represent them with respect to each such matter unless there is, under
applicable standards of professional conduct, a conflict on any significant
issue between the positions of any two or more Indemnified Parties. In the event
any Indemnified Party brings any action against Parent or the Surviving
Corporation to enforce rights or to collect monies due under this Section 5.7,
the prevailing party in such action shall be entitled to recover its costs,
including reasonable attorneys' fees and costs.

                           (b) Successors. In the event Parent or any of its
successors or assigns (i) consolidates with or merges into any other person and
shall not be the continuing or surviving corporation or entity of such
consolidation or merger or (ii) transfers all or substantially all of its
properties and assets to any person, then and in either such case, proper
provisions shall be made so that the continuing or surviving entity or
transferee, as appropriate, shall assume the obligations set forth in this
Section 5.7.

                           (c) Survival of Indemnification. To the fullest
extent not prohibited by law, from and after the Effective Time, all rights to
indemnification as of the date hereof in favor of the directors, officers and
fiduciaries of the Company and its subsidiaries with respect to their activities
as such prior to the Effective Time, as provided in their respective
certificates of incorporation and bylaws or comparable documents in effect on
the date hereof, shall survive the Merger and shall continue in full force and
effect for a period of not less than six years from the Effective Time, provided


                                       25
<PAGE>

that in the event any claim or claims are asserted or made within such six-year
period, all such rights to indemnification in respect of such claim or claims
shall continue until the final disposition thereof.

                           (d) Current Insurance Coverage. Parent shall cause
the Surviving Corporation to maintain the Company's existing directors' and
officers' insurance policy, under which all premiums and other costs associated
therewith have been paid in full, for the balance of its term.

                  Section 5.8 Employee Benefit Plans. For purposes of all
employee benefit plans (as defined in Section 3(3) of ERISA) and other
employment agreements, arrangements and policies of Parent under which an
employee's benefits depends, in whole or in part, on length of service, credit
will be given to current employees of the Company and its subsidiaries for
service with the Company or any of its subsidiaries prior to the Effective Time,
provided that such crediting of service does not result in duplication of
benefits. Parent shall, and shall cause the Surviving Corporation to, honor in
accordance with their terms all employee benefit plans (as defined in Section
3(3) of ERISA) and the other Company Benefit Plans; provided, however, that
Parent or the Surviving Corporation may amend, modify or terminate any
individual Company Benefit Plan in accordance with its terms and applicable law
(including obtaining the consent of the other parties to and beneficiaries of
such Company Benefit Plan to the extent required thereunder); provided, further,
that, for a period of two years from the Closing Date, no such amendment,
modification or termination shall result in compensation and benefits to the
employee, former employees, directors or former directors of the Company and its
subsidiaries (the "Company Employees") that are less favorable, in the
aggregate, than the compensation and benefits that are provided to the Company
Employees immediately prior to the Effective Time. Notwithstanding the foregoing
or anything else in this Agreement to the contrary, the Surviving Corporation
and its subsidiaries shall not, after the Effective Time, provide (i) retiree
medical health insurance benefits without the consent of Parent except as may be
required by law, or (ii) any form of equity-based compensation, including,
without limitation, options to purchase shares of capital stock in the Surviving
Corporation or any of its subsidiaries.

                  Section 5.9 Additional Agreements. In case at any time after
the Effective Time any further action is necessary or desirable to carry out the
purposes of this Agreement or to vest the Surviving Corporation with full title
to all properties, assets, rights, approvals, immunities and franchises of any
of the parties to the Merger, the proper officers and directors of each party to
this Agreement and their respective subsidiaries shall take all such necessary
action as may be reasonably requested by, and at the sole expense of, Parent.

                  Section 5.10 Certain Lending Transactions. Following the date
of this Agreement, and until the Section 5.10 Termination Date (as defined
below), Parent shall, or shall cause one or more of its subsidiaries to, enter
into such agreements with the Company, or one or more of its subsidiaries, as
are described in Schedule I delivered by Parent to the Company concurrently with
the execution of this Agreement, for the purpose of lending funds to the Company
or one or more of its subsidiaries in connection with the transactions, and on
the terms, described in Schedule I, it being understood and agreed by Parent and
the Company that (a) any such agreement will be entered into on or about the
date specified for such purpose in Schedule I and any transaction provided for
therein will be subject to the terms applicable to such transaction set forth in


                                       26
<PAGE>

Schedule I, and (b) all obligations of Parent under this Section 5.10 shall
terminate as of the Section 5.10 Termination Date. For purposes of this
Agreement, the "Section 5.10 Termination Date" shall mean the earliest to occur
of (a) the first anniversary of the date of this Agreement, (b) the date Parent
or Merger Sub provides the Company with notice of the occurrence of any breach
of any of the Company's representations, warranties, obligations, agreements, or
covenants contained in this Agreement, which breach would (assuming it cannot be
cured or has not been cured within the time specified in Section 7.1(d)(iii))
entitle Parent to terminate this Agreement pursuant to Section 7.1(d)(iii),
provided that, if such breach is cured by the Company within the time specified
in Section 7.1(d)(iii), then, unless Parent's obligations pursuant to this
Section 5.10 have been terminated as a result of any other provision of this
Section 5.10, such obligations under this Section 5.10 shall continue once the
cure of such breach is effective, (c) the date of termination of this Agreement
pursuant to Sections 7.1(c)(ii) or 7.1(d)(ii) hereof, or (d) the date of
termination of this Agreement pursuant to Section 7.1(b)(i), 7.1(b)(ii),
7.1(c)(i), or 7.1(d)(i) hereof, to the extent that such termination under this
clause (d) either (1) occurs following a Takeover Proposal, which Takeover
Proposal (together with any modifications thereof) has not been withdrawn by the
date of the event giving rise to such termination, or (2) relates to or results
from a Takeover Proposal.

                  Section 6.4 Frustration of Closing Conditions. None of Parent,
Merger Sub or the Company may rely on the failure of any condition to its
obligation to consummate the Merger set forth in Section 6.1, 6.2 or 6.3, as the

(subject, in the case of Parent and Merger Sub, to Section 5.6(c)) to use its
reasonable efforts to consummate the Merger and the other transactions
contemplated by this Agreement.

                                   ARTICLE VII

contrary notwithstanding, this Agreement may be terminated and the Merger
contemplated herein may be abandoned at any time prior to the Effective Time,
whether before or after stockholder approval thereof:

Company.

                           (b) By either of the Company or Parent:

                                    (i) if any Governmental Entity shall have
issued an order, decree or ruling or taken any other action in each case
permanently restraining, enjoining or otherwise prohibiting the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement and such order, decree, ruling or other action
shall have become final and non-appealable (any such order, decree, ruling or
other action, a "Final Order"); provided that the party seeking to terminate
this Agreement shall have used all reasonable efforts (subject, in the case of
Parent and Merger Sub, to Section 5.6(c)) to challenge such order, decree,
ruling or other action;

                                    (ii) if the Effective Time shall not have
occurred on or before August 30, 2003, (the "Outside Date"), provided, that, a
party may not terminate the Agreement pursuant to this Section 7.1(b)(ii) if its
failure to perform any of its obligations under this Agreement results in the
failure of the Effective Time to occur by such time, provided, however, that the
Outside Date shall be extended day-by-day for each day during which any party
shall be subject to a nonfinal order, decree, ruling or action restraining,
enjoining or otherwise prohibiting the consummation of the Merger, provided
further, however, that the Outside Date shall not be extended past October 15,

stockholders or at any adjournment thereof;

<PAGE>

                                    (ii) if concurrently it enters into a
definitive agreement providing for a Superior Proposal entered into in
accordance with Section 5.2, provided that prior thereto or simultaneously
therewith the Company has paid the Termination Fee to Parent in accordance with
Section 7.3; or

                                    (iii) if the representations and warranties
of Parent or Merger Sub set forth in this Agreement that are qualified by
materiality shall not be true and correct in any respect, or if the
representations and warranties of Parent and Merger Sub set forth in this
Agreement that are not so qualified shall not be true and correct in all
material respects, in each case as of the date of this Agreement and as of the
Closing Date as if made on such date (or, in the case of representations and
warranties that address matters only as of a particular date, as of such date),
or either Parent or Merger Sub shall have breached or failed in any material
respect to perform or comply with any material obligation, agreement or covenant
required by this Agreement to be performed or complied with by it, which
inaccuracy or breach cannot be cured or has not been cured within fifteen (15)
business days after the Company gives written notice of such inaccuracy or
breach to Parent.

                           (d) By Parent:

                                    (i) if the required approval of the
stockholders of the Company shall not have been obtained by reason of the
failure to obtain the required vote upon a vote held at a duly held meeting of
stockholders or at any adjournment thereof;

                                    (ii) if the Board of Directors of the
Company or any committee thereof shall have withdrawn or modified, or proposed
publicly to withdraw or modify, in a manner adverse to Parent its approval or
recommendation of this Agreement, the Merger and the other transactions
contemplated hereby, or failed to reconfirm its recommendation within three (3)
business days after a written request to do so, or approved or recommended, or
proposed publicly to approve or recommend, any Takeover Proposal, or the Board
of Directors of the Company or any committee thereof shall have resolved to take
any of the foregoing actions; or

                                    (iii) if the representations and warranties
of the Company set forth in this Agreement that are qualified by materiality
shall not be true and correct in any respect, or if the representations and
warranties of the Company set forth in this Agreement that are not so qualified
shall not be true and correct in all material respects, in each case as of the
date of this Agreement and as of the Closing Date as if made on such date (or,
in the case of representations and warranties that address matters only as of a
particular date, as of such date), or the Company shall have breached or failed
in any material respect to perform or comply with any material obligation,
agreement or covenant required by this Agreement to be performed or complied
with by it, which inaccuracy or breach cannot be cured or has not been cured
within fifteen (15) business days after Parent gives written notice of such
inaccuracy or breach to the Company.

                  Section 7.2 Effect of Termination. In the event of the
termination of this Agreement as provided in Section 7.1, written notice thereof
shall forthwith be given to the other party or parties specifying the provision
hereof pursuant to which such termination is made, and this Agreement (other
than Sections 5.5(b), 5.5(c), 7.2, 7.3, 8.4, 8.6, 8.7, 8.8, 8.9 and, subject to


                                       30
<PAGE>

the conditions set forth therein, 5.10 hereof) shall forthwith become null and
void, and there shall be no liability on the part of the Parent or the Company,
except as provided in Section 7.3; provided, however, that nothing in this
Section shall relieve any party from liability for any breach (occurring prior
to any such termination) of any of the representations, warranties, covenants,
or agreements set forth in this Agreement.

                  Section 7.3 Termination Fee; Expenses. Except as provided in
this Section 7.3 and except for the filing fee under the HSR Act (which filing
fee shall be borne equally by Parent and the Company), all fees and expenses
incurred by the parties hereto shall be borne solely by the party that has
incurred such fees and expenses. In the event that (i) a Takeover Proposal shall
have been made known to the Company or shall have been made directly to its
stockholders generally or any person shall have publicly announced an intention
(whether or not conditional) to make a Takeover Proposal and thereafter this
Agreement is terminated either (a) pursuant to Section 7.1(b)(ii), 7.1(c)(i), or
7.1(d)(i) or (b) pursuant to Section 7.1(b)(i), but only if, in the case of this
clause (b), the applicable Final Order is based on the existence of such
Takeover Proposal (whether or not modified after it was first made), and such
Takeover Proposal (whether or not modified after it was first made) is
consummated within one (1) year of such termination or (ii) this Agreement is
terminated by Parent pursuant to Section 7.1(d)(ii), or is terminated by the
Company pursuant to Section 7.1(c)(ii), then the Company shall pay to Parent on
the date of such termination, or in the case of subclause (i) upon such
consummation, a termination fee equal to $35 million (the "Termination Fee"),
payable by wire transfer of same day funds. The Company acknowledges that the
agreements contained in this Section 7.3 are an integral part of the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement and that, without these agreements,
Parent and Merger Sub would not enter into this Agreement. In the event the
Termination Fee becomes payable pursuant to this Section 7.3, the Company shall
also promptly pay upon Parent's request, all reasonably documented out-of-pocket
fees and expenses incurred by Parent and Merger Sub in connection with this
Agreement and the transactions contemplated hereby (including the portion of the
filing fee under the HSR Act paid by Parent), which payments shall be in
addition to the Termination Fee, but which payments shall not exceed $1 million
in the aggregate. The fee arrangement contemplated hereby shall be paid pursuant
to this Section 7.3 regardless of any alleged breach by Parent of its
obligations hereunder, provided, that no payment made by the Company pursuant to
this Section 7.3 shall operate or be construed as a waiver by the Company of any
breach of this Agreement by Parent or Merger Sub or of any rights of the Company
in respect thereof. The Termination Fee, if paid, shall be credited against any
damages recovered by Parent or Merger Sub from the Company arising from a breach
of this Agreement by the Company.

                                  ARTICLE VIII

                                  MISCELLANEOUS

                  Section 8.1 Amendment and Modification. Subject to applicable
law, this Agreement may be amended, modified and supplemented in any and all
respects, whether before or after any vote of the stockholders of the Company
contemplated hereby, by written agreement of the parties hereto at any time
prior to the Closing Date with respect to any of the terms contained herein;


                                       31

provided, however, that no amendment, modification or supplement of this
Agreement shall be made following the approval of this Agreement by the
stockholders unless, to the extent required, approved by the stockholders.

                  Section 8.2 Extension; Waiver. At any time prior to the
Effective Time, the parties may (a) extend the time for the performance of any
of the obligations or other acts of the other parties, (b) waive any
inaccuracies in the representations and warranties contained in this Agreement
or in any document delivered pursuant to this Agreement or (c) subject to the
proviso of Section 8.1, waive compliance with any of the agreements or
conditions contained in this Agreement. Any agreement on the part of a party to
any such extension or waiver shall be valid only if set forth in an instrument
in writing signed on behalf of such party. The failure of any party to this
Agreement to assert any of its rights under this Agreement or otherwise shall
not constitute a waiver of such rights.

                  Section 8.3 Nonsurvival of Representations and Warranties.
None of the representations and warranties in this Agreement or in any schedule,
instrument or other document delivered pursuant to this Agreement shall survive

                  Section 8.5 Counterparts. This Agreement may be executed in
two or more counterparts, all of which shall be considered one and the same
agreement and shall become effective when two or more counterparts have been
signed by each of the parties and delivered to the other parties, it being
understood that all parties need not sign the same counterpart.

                  Section 8.6 Entire Agreement; Third Party Beneficiaries. This
Agreement (including the Exhibits hereto and the documents and the instruments
referred to herein): (a) constitutes the entire agreement and supersedes all
prior agreements and understandings, both written and oral, among the parties
with respect to the subject matter hereof, and (b) except as provided in Section
5.7, is not intended to confer upon any person other than the parties hereto any
rights or remedies hereunder. Section 5.7 is intended for the benefit of, and
shall be enforceable by, the Indemnified Parties.

                  Section 8.7 Severability. If any term, provision, covenant or
restriction of this Agreement is held by a court of competent jurisdiction or
other authority to be invalid, void, unenforceable or against its regulatory
policy, the remainder of the terms, provisions, covenants and restrictions of
this Agreement shall remain in full force and effect and shall in no way be
affected, impaired or invalidated, so long as the economic and legal substance
of the transactions contemplated hereby, taken as a whole, are not affected in a
manner materially adverse to any party hereto.

                  Section 8.8 Governing Law. This Agreement shall be governed
and construed in accordance with the laws of the State of Delaware without
giving effect to the principles of conflicts of law thereof or of any other
jurisdiction.

                  Section 8.9 Assignment. Neither this Agreement nor any of the
rights, interests or obligations hereunder shall be assigned by any of the
parties hereto (whether by operation of law or otherwise) without the prior
written consent of the other parties, except that Merger Sub may assign, in its
sole discretion, any or all of its rights, interests and obligations hereunder
to Parent or to any direct or indirect wholly owned subsidiary of Parent.
Subject to the preceding sentence, this Agreement shall be binding upon, inure
to the benefit of and be enforceable by the parties and their respective
successors and assigns.

                  Section 8.10 Headings; Interpretation. The descriptive
headings used herein are inserted for convenience of reference only and are not
intended to be part of or to affect the meaning or interpretation of this
Agreement. "Include," "includes," and "including" shall be deemed to be followed
by "without limitation" whether or not they are in fact followed by such words
or words of like import. "Knowledge" and "known" means the actual knowledge
after reasonable inquiry of the executive officers of the Company or Parent, as
the case may be.

                  Section 8.11 Enforcement. The parties agree that irreparable
damage would occur in the event that any of the provisions of this Agreement
were not performed in accordance with their specific terms or were otherwise
breached. It is accordingly agreed that the parties shall be entitled to an
injunction or injunctions to prevent breaches of this Agreement and to enforce
specifically the terms and provisions of this Agreement in any court of the
State of Delaware or of the United States located in the State of Delaware in
the event any dispute arises out of this Agreement or any of the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement, and each party will not attempt to deny or
defeat personal jurisdiction or venue in any such court by motion or other
request for leave from any such court.
