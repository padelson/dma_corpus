income produced by, such investments shall be payable to the Surviving
Company. To the extent that there are losses with respect to such investments,
or the Payment Fund diminishes for other reasons below the level required to
make prompt payments of the Merger Consideration as contemplated hereby,
Parent shall promptly replace or restore the portion of the Payment Fund lost
through investments or other events so as to ensure that the Payment Fund is,
at all times, maintained at a level sufficient to make such payments.

  

  

(b) _Exchange Procedures_. Promptly after the Effective Time (and in no event
later than two (2) Business Days thereafter), Parent shall cause to be mailed
to each person who was, at the Effective Time, a holder of record of Shares
entitled to receive the Merger Consideration pursuant to _Section 3.01(a)_:
(i) a letter of transmittal (which shall be in customary form and shall
specify that delivery shall be effected, and risk of loss and title to the
Shares shall pass, only upon proper delivery of the Shares to the Paying
Agent) and (ii) instructions for use in effecting the surrender of the
certificates evidencing such Shares (each, a " _Certificate_ " and, together,
the " _Certificates_ ") or the non-certificated Shares represented by book-
entry (" _Book-Entry Shares_ ") in exchange for the Merger Consideration. Upon
surrender of Certificates (or effective affidavits of loss in lieu thereof and
delivery of a bond in a reasonable amount, if reasonably required, in each
case pursuant to _Section 3.02(e)_) to the Paying Agent for cancellation,
together with such letter of transmittal, duly completed and validly executed
in accordance with the instructions thereto (and such other documents as may
customarily be required by the Paying Agent), the holder of such Shares shall
be entitled to receive in exchange therefor the Merger Consideration which
such holder has the right to receive pursuant to _Section 3.01(a)_, and the
Certificates so surrendered shall forthwith be cancelled. In the event of a
transfer of ownership of Shares that is not registered in the transfer records
of the Company, payment of the Merger Consideration may be made to a person
other than the person in whose name the Certificate or Book-Entry Share so
surrendered is registered if the Certificate or Book-Entry Share representing
such Shares shall be presented to the Paying Agent, accompanied by all
documents required to evidence and effect such transfer or otherwise be in
proper form for transfer, and the person requesting such payment shall pay any
transfer or other Taxes required solely by reason of the payment of the Merger
Consideration to a person other than the registered holder of such Certificate
or Book-Entry Share or establish to the reasonable satisfaction of Parent that
such Tax has been paid or is not applicable. Until surrendered as contemplated
by this _Section 3.02_, each Certificate or Book-Entry Share shall be deemed
at all times after the Effective Time to represent only the right to receive
upon such surrender the Merger Consideration to which the holder of such
Certificate or Book-Entry Share is entitled pursuant to this _Article III_. No
interest shall be paid or will accrue on any cash payable to holders of
Certificates or Book-Entry Shares pursuant to the provisions of this _Article
III_. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this _Section 3.02_, any
holder of Book-Entry Shares shall not be required to deliver a Certificate or
an executed letter of transmittal to the Paying Agent to receive the Merger
Consideration that such holder is entitled to receive pursuant to this
_Article III_. In lieu thereof, each registered holder of one or more Book-
Entry Shares shall upon receipt by the Paying Agent of an "agent's" message in
customary form (or such other evidence, if any, as the Paying Agent may
reasonably require) be entitled to receive, and the Surviving Company shall
cause the Paying Agent to pay and deliver as soon as reasonably practicable
after receipt of such agent's message (or such other evidence, if any, as the
Paying Agent may reasonably require), the Merger Consideration for each Book-
Entry Share.

  

  

 

13  

  

  

(c) _No Further Rights_. From and after the Effective Time, holders of Shares
shall cease to have any rights as stockholders of the Company, except as
provided herein or by Law.

  

  

(d) _Termination of Payment Fund_. Any portion of the Payment Fund that
remains undistributed to the former holders of Shares twelve (12) months after
the Effective Time shall be delivered to the Surviving Company, upon demand,
and any holders of Shares who have not theretofore complied with this _Article
III_ shall thereafter look only to the Surviving Company for, and the
Surviving Company shall remain liable for, payment of their claim for the
Merger Consideration. Any portion of the Payment Fund remaining unclaimed by
holders of Shares as of a date which is immediately prior to such time as such
amounts would otherwise escheat to or become property of any Governmental
Authority shall, to the extent permitted by applicable Law, become the
property of the Surviving Company free and clear of any claims or interest of
any person previously entitled thereto. Neither Parent nor the Surviving
Company shall be liable to any person in respect of any Merger Consideration
delivered to a public official pursuant to any applicable abandoned property,
escheat or similar Law.

  

  

(e) _Lost Certificates_. If any Certificate shall have been lost, stolen or
destroyed, then upon (i) the making of an affidavit of that fact by the person
claiming such Certificate to be lost, stolen or destroyed, and (ii) if
reasonably required by the Surviving Company, an indemnity bond reasonable in
amount, the Paying Agent shall pay in respect of such lost, stolen or
destroyed Certificate the Merger Consideration to which the holder thereof is
entitled pursuant to _Section 3.01(a)_.

  

  

SECTION 3.03 _Stock Transfer Books_. At the close of business on the day of
the Effective Time, the stock transfer books of the Company shall be closed
and thereafter there shall be no further registration of transfers of Shares
on the records of the Company. From and after the Effective Time, the holders
of Shares outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time shall cease to
have any rights with respect to such Shares, except as otherwise provided in
this Agreement or by Law. On or after the Effective Time, any Certificates or
Book-Entry Shares presented to the Paying Agent or Parent for any reason shall
be cancelled against delivery of the Merger Consideration to which the holders
thereof are entitled pursuant to _Section 3.01(a)_.

  

  

SECTION 3.04 _Company Stock Options and Restricted Stock Units_.

  

  

(a) At the Effective Time, (i) each outstanding option (each, a " _Company
Stock Option_ ") to purchase Shares granted under the Company Stock Plans that
is outstanding and unexercised as of immediately prior to the Effective Time,
whether or not vested or exercisable, shall become fully vested and
exercisable, and shall be cancelled as of the Effective Time, subject, if
applicable, to the payment pursuant to _Section 3.04(b)_, and (ii) each
restricted stock unit subject to time-based restrictions (each, a "
_Restricted Stock Unit_ ") granted under the Company Stock Plans and
outstanding as of immediately prior to the Effective Time shall become fully
vested as of the Effective Time and shall be cancelled as of the Effective
Time, subject to the payment pursuant to _Section 3.04(c)_.

  

  

 

14  

  

  

(b) Each holder of a Company Stock Option that is outstanding and unexercised
as of the Effective Time that has an exercise price per Share that is less
than the Merger Consideration shall (subject to the provisions of this
_Section 3.04_) be paid by the Surviving Company immediately after the
Effective Time (and in no event later than five (5) days following the
Effective Time), an amount in cash equal to the product of (i) the amount by
which the Merger Consideration exceeds the applicable exercise price per Share
of such Company Stock Option and (ii) the aggregate number of Shares issuable
upon exercise of such Company Stock Option. All such payments shall be subject
to all applicable Tax withholding requirements. Each Company Stock Option that
has an exercise price per Share that is equal to or greater than the Merger
Consideration shall be cancelled as of the Effective Time without payment of
any cash consideration.

  

  

(c) Each Restricted Stock Unit that vests in accordance with _Section 3.04(a)_
shall be cancelled as of the Effective Time and converted into the right to
receive, immediately after the Effective Time (and in no event later than five
(5) days following the Effective Time), an amount in cash, without interest,
equal to the product of (i) the Merger Consideration and (ii) the aggregate
number of Shares subject to such Restricted Stock Unit. All such payments
shall be subject to all applicable Tax withholding requirements.

  

  

(d) No later than promptly following the date of this Agreement, the Company
Board (or, if applicable, any committee thereof administering the Company
ESPP) shall adopt such resolutions or take such other necessary actions such
that (i) with respect to any Offering Period(s) (as such term is defined in
the Company ESPP) open as of the date of this Agreement under the Company
ESPP, such Offering Period(s) shall terminate and any option to purchase
Shares under the Company ESPP shall be deemed to have been exercised upon the
earlier to occur of (A) the day that is four (4) Business Days prior to the
Effective Time or (B) the date on which such Offering Period(s) would
otherwise end, and no additional Offering Period(s) shall commence under such
Company ESPP after the date of this Agreement; (ii) no individual
participating in the Company ESPP shall be permitted to (A) increase the
amount of his, her or its rate of payroll contributions thereunder from the
rate in effect as of the date of this Agreement, or (B) except to the extent
required by applicable Law, make separate non-payroll contributions to the
Company ESPP on or following the date of this Agreement; (iii) no individual
who is not participating in the Company ESPP as of the date of this Agreement
may commence participation in the Company ESPP following the date of this
Agreement; (iv) the amount of the accumulated contributions of each
participant under the Company ESPP as of immediately prior to the Effective
Time shall, to the extent not used to purchase Shares in accordance with the
terms and conditions of the Company ESPP, be refunded to such participant as
of the Effective Time (without interest); and (v) subject to the consummation
of the Merger, the Company ESPP shall terminate, effective immediately prior
to the Effective Time.

  

  

(e) Prior to the Effective Time, the Company shall provide any notice required
under the terms of the Company Stock Plans, obtain any necessary consents,
adopt applicable resolutions, amend the terms of the Company Stock Plans or
any outstanding awards and take all other appropriate actions to give effect
to the transactions contemplated herein.

  

  

 

15  

  

  

(f) Prior to the Effective Time, the Company shall take all steps reasonably
necessary to cause the Transactions and any other dispositions of Shares or
other equity securities of the Company (including derivative securities) in
connection with this Agreement by each person who is a director or officer of
the Company to be exempt under Rule 16b-3 promulgated under the Exchange Act,
as amended.

  

  

SECTION 3.05 _Certain Adjustments_. Without limiting the other provisions of
this Agreement, if the outstanding Shares are changed into a different number
or class of shares due to any stock split, reverse stock split, stock dividend
(including any dividend or distribution of securities convertible into
Shares), reorganization, recapitalization, reclassification, combination,
exchange of shares or other like change with respect to Shares occurring on or
after the date hereof and prior to the Effective Time, the Merger
Consideration as provided in _Section 3.01(a)_ shall be equitably adjusted to
reflect the effect thereof.

  

  

SECTION 3.06 _Dissenting Shares_.

  

  

(a) Notwithstanding any provision of this Agreement to the contrary, Shares
that are outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time and that are held
by stockholders who shall have neither voted in favor of the Merger nor
consented thereto in writing and who shall have demanded properly in writing
appraisal for such Shares in accordance with Section 262 of the DGCL
(collectively, the " _Dissenting Shares_ ") shall not be converted into, or
represent the right to receive, the Merger Consideration, unless such holder
fails to perfect, withdraws or otherwise loses the right to appraisal. At the
Effective Time, all Dissenting Shares will no longer be outstanding and
automatically will be cancelled and will cease to exist, and, except as
otherwise provided by applicable Laws, each holder of Dissenting Shares will
cease to have any rights with respect to the Dissenting Shares, other than
such rights as are granted under such Section 262. Such stockholders shall be
entitled to receive payment of the appraised value of such Shares held by them
in accordance with the provisions of such Section 262, except that all
Dissenting Shares held by stockholders who shall have failed to perfect or who
effectively shall have withdrawn or lost their rights to appraisal of such
Shares under such Section 262 shall thereupon be deemed to have been converted
into, and to have become exchangeable for, as of the Effective Time, the right
to receive the Merger Consideration, without any interest thereon, upon
surrender, in the manner provided in _Section 3.02_, of the certificate or
certificates that formerly evidenced such Shares.

  

  

(b) The Company shall give Parent (i) prompt notice and copies of any demands
for appraisal received by the Company, withdrawals of such demands and any
other instruments served pursuant to the DGCL and received by the Company and
(ii) the opportunity to direct and control all negotiations and proceedings
with respect to demands for appraisal under the DGCL. The Company shall not,
except with the prior written consent of Parent, make any payment, or offer or
agree to make any payment, with respect to any demands for appraisal or offer
to settle or settle any such demands.

  

  

SECTION 3.07 _Withholding Rights_. Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement
to the contrary, each of the Paying Agent, the Surviving Company and Parent
shall be entitled to deduct and withhold from the consideration otherwise
payable pursuant to this Agreement to any holder of Shares, Company Stock
Options or Restricted Stock Units, such amounts as it is required to deduct
and withhold with respect to such payment under all applicable Tax Laws and
pay such withholding amount over to the appropriate Governmental Authority. To
the extent that amounts are so properly withheld and timely paid over to the
appropriate Governmental Authority by the Paying Agent, the Surviving Company,
Merger Sub or Parent, as the case may be, such withheld amounts shall be
treated for all purposes of this Agreement as having been paid to the holder
of Shares, Company Stock Options or Restricted Stock Units in respect of which
such deduction and withholding was made by the Paying Agent, the Surviving
Company, Merger Sub or Parent, as the case may be.

all requisite corporate or other entity power and authority to carry on its

Company Subsidiary is duly qualified or licensed to do business and is in good
standing (where such concept is recognized under applicable Law) in each
jurisdiction where the nature of its business or the ownership, leasing or
operation of its properties makes such qualification or licensing necessary,

True and complete copies of (i) the Company Charter and (ii) the Company By-
laws, in each case as in effect on the date of this Agreement, are included in
the SEC Documents. The Company is not in violation of any provisions of the
Company Charter or the Company By-laws, except for violations that would not,

17  

  

  

The Company has made available to Parent a true and complete copy of the

Merger.

  

  

SECTION 4.02 _Capitalization_.

  

  

(a) The authorized share capital of the Company consists of (i) 245,000,000

Disclosure Schedule, as of the close of business on September 21, 2018, there
were no options, warrants or other similar rights obligating the Company or

18  

  

  

(d) Each outstanding capital share, limited liability company interest,
partnership interest or equity or similar interest of each Company Subsidiary
that is held, directly or indirectly, by the Company is duly authorized,
validly issued, fully paid and nonassessable and was issued free and clear of
preemptive (or similar) rights, and each such share or interest is owned by
the Company or a Company Subsidiary free and clear of all Liens, other than
Permitted Liens. There are no options, warrants, rights, convertible or
exchangeable securities, stock-settled performance units, Contracts or
undertakings of any kind to which any Company Subsidiary is a party or by

or in equity).

  

  

SECTION 4.04 _No Conflict; Required Filings and Consents_.

  

  

(a) The execution and delivery of this Agreement by the Company do not, and

, _(iii)_ and _(iv)_ , for any such conflicts, violations, breaches, defaults,
rights or other occurrences that would not, individually or in the aggregate,
have a Material Adverse Effect or prevent the consummation of the Merger.

  

  

 

19  

  

  

(b) The execution and delivery of this Agreement by the Company do not, and
the performance of this Agreement by the Company and the consummation by the
Company of the Transactions will not, require any consent, approval,
authorization or permit of, or filing with or notification to, any

Adverse Effect or prevent the consummation of the Merger, (ii) applicable
requirements of the Securities Act and the Exchange Act, (iii) the filing with

(c) The Securitization Agreement is in full force and effect and constitutes a
legal, valid and binding obligation of the Company and its Subsidiaries party
thereto and, to the Knowledge of the Company, each other party thereto,
enforceable against the Company and its Subsidiaries party thereto and, to the
Knowledge of the Company, each other party thereto in accordance with its
terms, subject in each case to (i) the effect of any applicable bankruptcy,

(regardless of whether considered in a proceeding at Law or in equity) and
(ii) any effects on the Securitization Agreement resulting from actions taken
by the Company or any of its Subsidiaries with the written consent, or at the
written direction, of Parent or its Affiliates. As of the date hereof, there
does not exist, and on the Closing Date there will not be, a Securitization
Adverse Event that is continuing other than resulting from actions taken by
the Company or any of its Subsidiaries with the written consent, or at the
written direction, of Parent or its Affiliates. The execution and delivery of
this Agreement by the Company do not, and the performance of this Agreement by
the Company and the consummation by the Company of the Transactions will not
result in a Securitization Adverse Event other than any resulting from actions
taken by the Company or any of its Subsidiaries with the written consent, or
at the written direction, of Parent or its Affiliates. The Company has made
available to Parent a true, correct and complete copy of the Securitization

SECTION 4.05 _SEC Filings; Financial Statements; Undisclosed Liabilities_.

  

  

(a) The Company has timely filed all material forms, reports, statements,
schedules and other documents required to be filed by it with the SEC since
August 31, 2015 (as amended and supplemented from time to time, collectively,
the " _SEC Reports_ "). The SEC Reports (i) as of their respective dates of
filing, complied as to form in all material respects with the applicable
requirements of the Securities Act, the Exchange Act, and the Sarbanes-Oxley
Act of 2002, as applicable, and, in each case, the rules and regulations
promulgated thereunder, and (ii) except to the extent amended or superseded by
a subsequent filing, did not, at the time they were filed, or, if amended, as
of such amendment (or with respect to the SEC Reports filed after the date of
this Agreement, will not), contain any untrue statement of a material fact or
omit to state a material fact required to be stated therein or necessary in
order to make the statements made therein, in light of the circumstances under
which they were made, not misleading.

  

  

 

20  

  

  

None of the Company Subsidiaries is subject to the periodic reporting
requirements of the Exchange Act (other than in its capacity as a Subsidiary
of the Company). As of the date hereof, there are no outstanding or unresolved
comments in comment letters from the SEC staff with respect to any of the SEC
Reports. To the Knowledge of the Company, as of the date hereof, none of the
SEC Reports is the subject of ongoing SEC review or outstanding SEC
investigations.

  

  

(b) Each of the consolidated financial statements of the Company (including,
in each case, any notes thereto) contained in the SEC Reports was prepared in
accordance with GAAP applied on a consistent basis during the periods involved
(except as may be indicated in the notes thereto or, in the case of unaudited
statements, as permitted by Form 10-Q of the SEC) and each fairly presents, in
all material respects, the consolidated financial position, results of
operations and cash flows of the Company and its consolidated Subsidiaries as
at the respective dates thereof and for the respective periods indicated
therein (subject, in the case of unaudited statements, to the absence of notes
and normal and recurring year-end adjustments).

  

  

(c) The Company has implemented and maintains disclosure controls and
procedures and internal controls over financial reporting (as defined in Rule
13a-15(e) and Rule 13a-15(f) of the Exchange Act), reasonably designed to (i)
provide reasonable assurances that material information relating to the
Company, including its consolidated Subsidiaries, is made known to the
principal executive officer and the principal financial and accounting officer
of the Company by others within those entities and, to the Company's
Knowledge, such disclosure controls and procedures are effective in all
material respects in timely alerting the principal executive officer and the
principal financial and accounting officer of the Company to all material
information required to be disclosed by the Company in the reports filed under
the Exchange Act and (ii) provide reasonable assurances regarding the
reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements
for external purposes in accordance with GAAP. The Company is in compliance in
all material respects with the applicable listing and corporate governance
rules and regulations of Nasdaq. Since August 31, 2015, none of the Company,
the Company Board nor, to the Knowledge of the Company, the Company's auditors
have been advised of, and the Company's principal executive officer and its
principal ﬁnancial and accounting officer have not disclosed, based on their
most recent evaluation prior to the date of this Agreement, to the Company's

SECTION 5.08 _Financing_.

  

  

(a) Parent has provided to the Company true, accurate and complete copies,
dated as of the date of this Agreement, of the Equity Commitment Letters from
each of the Investors, pursuant to which the Investors have, severally (and
not jointly) as between the Equity Commitment Letters, committed to provide,
subject only to the terms and conditions contained therein, funds that, when
aggregated, represent the full amount of the aggregate Merger Consideration
(the " _Aggregate Consideration_ "), any other amounts required to be paid in
connection with the consummation of the Transactions (including all amounts
payable pursuant to _Section 3.04_) and any fees and expenses of or payable by
Parent or Merger Sub in connection with the Transactions (such amount
collectively, the " _Required Amount_ " and, such equity financing,
collectively, the " _Equity Commitment_ "). There are no other side letters,
arrangements or understandings, whether written or oral, with any person
relating to the Equity Commitment other than as expressly set forth in the
Equity Commitment Letters. Each Equity Commitment Letter, in the form provided
to the Company, is a legal, valid and binding obligation of Parent, Merger Sub
and the applicable Investor, is in full force and effect and is enforceable in
accordance with the terms thereof against Parent, Merger Sub and the
applicable Investor, subject to the effect of any applicable bankruptcy,
insolvency (including all Laws relating to fraudulent transfers),
reorganization, moratorium or similar Laws affecting creditors' rights
generally and subject to the effect of general principles of equity
(regardless of whether considered in a proceeding at Law or in equity), and no
event has occurred (and no event is reasonably expected to occur) which would
reasonably be expected to result in any breach of or constitute a default
under (or an event which with notice or lapse of time or both would result in
any breach of or constitute a default under) or reasonably be expected to
result in a failure to satisfy a condition precedent, in each case, on the
part of Parent, Merger Sub or the Investors or would reasonably be expected to
permit any party to such Equity Commitment Letter to terminate, or to not make
the initial funding under, such Equity Commitment Letter.

Each Equity Commitment Letter has not been amended, supplemented, terminated,
rescinded or modified (and no waiver of any provision thereof has been
granted) and no such amendment, supplement, termination, rescission or
modification is contemplated. Each Equity Commitment Letter (x) contains all
of the conditions precedent to the obligations of the Investors to make the
applicable portion of the Required Amount available to Parent and Merger Sub
on the terms set forth therein and (y) does not contain any contingencies that
would permit the applicable Investor to reduce, or rescind its obligation to
provide, the total amount of the Equity Commitment. The obligations and
commitments contained in the Equity Commitment Letters have not been withdrawn
or rescinded in any respect. The Investors have not indicated that the Equity
Commitment will be unavailable. Each of Parent and Merger Sub, as applicable,
has fully paid, or caused to be fully paid, any and all commitment fees or
other fees to the extent required to be paid in connection with the Equity
Commitment. Parent and Merger Sub will have at the Closing funds sufficient
for the payment of the Required Amount.

  

  

(b) The Company is an express third-party beneficiary of each of the Equity
Commitment Letters and, subject to _Section 10.08_, the Company is (on its own
behalf and on behalf of the Company's stockholders) entitled to enforce,
directly or indirectly, each Equity Commitment Letter in accordance with its
terms against the applicable Investor.

  

  

(c) Parent and Merger Sub acknowledge and agree that it is not a condition to
the Closing or to any of the other obligations under this Agreement that
Parent and Merger Sub obtain financing for or relating to the Transactions.

  

  

SECTION 5.09 _Solvency_. Immediately after giving effect to the consummation
of the Transactions (including the payment of the Aggregate Consideration and
any other Required Amounts and incurrence of any Financing) and assuming the
accuracy in all material respects of the representations and warranties
contained in _Article IV_, the Surviving Company will be Solvent as of the
Effective Time, as of the Closing Date and immediately after the Effective
Time. For purposes of this Agreement, " _Solvent_ " means that, with respect
to any person, as of any date of determination, (a) the amount by which the
"fair saleable value" of the assets of such person will, as of such date,
exceed the sum of (i) the value of all "liabilities of such person, including
contingent and other liabilities," as of such date, as such terms are
generally determined in accordance with applicable Laws governing
determinations of the insolvency of debtors, and (ii) the amount that will be
required to pay the probable liabilities of such person, as of such date, on
its existing debts (including contingent and other liabilities) as such debts
become absolute and mature, (b) such person will not have, as of such date, an
unreasonably small amount of capital for the operation of the businesses in

Parent or Merger Sub for inclusion or incorporation by reference in the Proxy
Statement will, as of the date the Proxy Statement is first mailed to the
stockholders of the Company and at the time of the Company Stockholders'

material fact required to be stated therein or necessary to make the
statements therein, in light of the circumstances under which they were made,

SECTION 5.12 _Non-Reliance on Estimates, Projections, Forecasts, Forward-
Looking Statements and Business Plans_. In connection with the due diligence
investigation of the Company and its Subsidiaries by Parent and Merger Sub,
Parent and Merger Sub (and their Representatives) have received and may
continue to receive from the Company and its Subsidiaries and their
Representatives certain estimates, projections, forecasts and other forward-
looking information, as well as certain business plan information, regarding
the Company and its Subsidiaries and their respective businesses and
operations. Parent and Merger Sub hereby acknowledge that there are
uncertainties inherent in attempting to make such estimates, projections,
forecasts and other forward-looking statements, as well as in such business
plans, with which Parent and Merger Sub are familiar, that Parent and Merger
Sub are taking full responsibility for making their own evaluation of the
adequacy and accuracy of all estimates, projections, forecasts and other
forward-looking information, as well as such business plans, so furnished to
them (including the reasonableness of the assumptions underlying such
estimates, projections, forecasts, forward-looking information or business
plans), and that Parent and Merger Sub will have no claim against the Company
or any Subsidiary of the Company, or any of their respective shareholders or
Representatives, or any other person, with respect thereto. Parent and Merger
Sub hereby acknowledge that, except for the representations and warranties set
forth in _Article IV_, none of the Company nor any Subsidiary of the Company,
nor any of their respective shareholders or Representatives, nor any other
person, has made or is making any warranty with respect to any matter,
including any such estimates, projections, forecasts, forward-looking
statements or business plans (including the reasonableness of the assumptions
underlying such estimates, projections, forecasts, forward-looking statements
or business plans). Parent and Merger Sub acknowledge and agree that they have
not relied on any information provided by the Company, its Subsidiaries or any
of their Representatives, including information in any "data room," management
presentations or any estimates, projections, forecasts, forward-looking
statements or business plans received from the Company and its Subsidiaries or
their Representatives. Parent and Merger Sub entered into this Agreement based
upon their own investigation, examination and determination with respect
thereto as to all matters and without reliance upon any express or implied
representations or warranties of any nature made by or on behalf of the
Company, except as expressly set forth in this Agreement.

(b) Unless this Agreement is terminated pursuant to _Section 9.01_, the
Company shall, as promptly as reasonably practicable after the date on which
the Company learns that the Proxy Statement will not be reviewed or that the
SEC staff has no further comments thereon, duly call, give notice of, convene
and hold the Company Stockholders' Meeting. Subject to the terms of this
Agreement, the Company Board shall recommend that the stockholders of the
Company vote in favor of the adoption of this Agreement. Notwithstanding the
foregoing sentence, if on a date for which the Company Stockholders' Meeting
is scheduled, the Company has not received proxies representing a sufficient
number of Shares to constitute a quorum and to obtain the Company Stockholder
Approval, whether or not a quorum is present, the Company shall have the right
to make one or more successive postponements or adjournments of the Company
Stockholders' Meeting. At the Company Stockholders' Meeting, Parent will cause
all shares of Company Common Stock held of record by Parent or Merger Sub to
vote in favor of the adoption of this Agreement.

  

  

 

48  

  

  

The Company shall, unless there has been an Adverse Recommendation Change, use
its commercially reasonable efforts to solicit from its stockholders proxies
in favor of the adoption of this Agreement. Unless this Agreement is
terminated pursuant to _Section 9.01_, the Company shall submit this Agreement
to its stockholders at the Company Stockholders' Meeting. Without the prior
written consent of Parent, the adoption of this Agreement and the transactions
contemplated hereby (including the Merger) and related matters (including any
"golden parachute" vote) shall be the only matter (other than procedural
matters) that the Company shall propose to be acted on by the stockholders of
the Company at the Company Stockholders' Meeting.

  

  

SECTION 7.02 _Access to Information; Confidentiality_.

  

  

(a) Except (i) as otherwise prohibited by applicable Law or the terms of any
Contract or (ii) as would be reasonably expected to result in the loss of any
attorney-client (or other legal) privilege ( _provided_ , that the Company
shall use commercially reasonable efforts to allow the disclosure of such
information (or as much of it as reasonably possible) in a manner that does
not, in the case of _clause (i)_ , result in a violation of Law or the terms
of any Contract, or, in the case of _clause (ii)_ , result in a loss of
attorney-client (or other legal) privilege), during the Pre-Closing Period,
the Company shall (and shall cause its Subsidiaries to), at Parent's expense:
(x) provide to Parent and its Representatives reasonable access, during normal
business hours and upon reasonable prior notice to the Company by Parent, to
the officers, employees, properties and offices and other facilities of the
Company and its Subsidiaries and to the material books and records thereof,
and (y) furnish promptly to Parent such information concerning the business,
properties, Contracts, assets, liabilities and personnel of the Company and
its Subsidiaries as Parent or its Representatives may reasonably request.

  

  

(b) All information obtained by Parent, Merger Sub or its or their
Representatives pursuant to this _Article VII_ shall be kept confidential in
accordance with the confidentiality agreement, dated June 6, 2018, as amended
and modified from time to time (the " _Confidentiality Agreement_ "), between
Roark Capital Acquisition LLC and the Company.

  

  

SECTION 7.03 _No Solicitation_.

  

  

(a) Subject to the provisions of this _Section 7.03_, the Company shall, and
shall cause its Subsidiaries to, and shall instruct (and use its reasonable
best efforts to cause) its and its Subsidiaries' Representatives to,
immediately cease and cause to be terminated any solicitation, discussions or
negotiations that may be ongoing with a potential acquiror or its
Representative with respect to an Acquisition Proposal, and shall promptly
request the prompt return or destruction of all confidential information
previously furnished in connection therewith and immediately terminate all
physical and electronic data room access previously granted to any such person
or its Representatives. The Company and the Company Subsidiaries shall not
modify, amend, terminate, waive, release, or fail to enforce any provisions
of, any standstill provisions (including provisions that restrict or prohibit
the purchase of Shares) of any confidentiality agreement (or any similar
agreement) to which the Company or any of the Company Subsidiaries is a party
relating to an Acquisition Proposal; _provided_ , that at any time prior to
obtaining the Company Stockholder Approval, the Company may grant a waiver or
release under any standstill agreement (or similar agreement) to permit a
person covered by such standstill to submit or make an Acquisition Proposal,
if the Company Board shall have determined (after consultation with its
outside legal counsel) that the failure to take such action is reasonably
likely to be inconsistent with its fiduciary duties under applicable Law.

  

  

 

49  

  

  

The Company shall provide written notice to Parent of any waiver or release of
any standstill by the Company, including disclosure of the identities of the
parties thereto and circumstances relating thereto to the extent not
restricted by the terms of any existing confidentiality agreement ( _provided_
that the Company shall have used commercially reasonable efforts to obtain a
waiver under such confidentiality agreement to permit the Company to disclose
such information to Parent).

  

  

(b) Except as permitted by this _Section 7.03_, during the Pre-Closing Period,
the Company agrees that neither it nor any Subsidiary of the Company shall,
and it shall use its reasonable best efforts to cause its and its
Subsidiaries' Representatives not to (i) solicit, initiate, knowingly
encourage or knowingly facilitate any inquiries with respect to, or the
submission of any Acquisition Proposal, (ii) engage in, continue or otherwise
participate in discussions or negotiations regarding, or furnish to any person
any non-public information in connection with, any Acquisition Proposal,
except to notify such person of the existence of this _Section 7.03(b)_ or
(iii) except for an Acceptable Confidentiality Agreement, enter into any
acquisition agreement, merger agreement or similar agreement relating to any
Acquisition Proposal or that would require the Company to abandon, terminate
or fail to consummate the Merger (each, an " _Acquisition Agreement_ ");
_provided_ , that, if, prior to the receipt of the Company Stockholder
Approval, the Company receives an Acquisition Proposal that did not result
from a breach of this Agreement and the Company Board determines (after
consultation with its outside legal counsel and financial advisors) that such
Acquisition Proposal is, or could reasonably be expected to result in, a
Superior Proposal, the Company and its Subsidiaries and its and their
Representatives may (A) engage or participate in discussions or negotiations
with the person making such Acquisition Proposal and its Representatives
regarding such Acquisition Proposal and (B) furnish information to the person
making such Acquisition Proposal pursuant to an Acceptable Confidentiality
Agreement.

  

  

(c) The Company shall promptly (and, in any event, within forty-eight (48)
hours) after receipt of any Acquisition Proposal or any request for non-public
information relating to an Acquisition Proposal, or any inquiry, offer or
proposal, that could reasonably be expected to result in any Acquisition
Proposal, notify Parent of the material terms of such Acquisition Proposal,
request, inquiry, offer or proposal received by the Company (including copies
of any material written requests, proposals or offers, including proposed
agreements), and the identity of the person or "group" making such Acquisition
Proposal, inquiry offer or proposal to the extent not restricted by the terms
of any existing confidentiality agreement ( _provided_ that the Company shall
have used commercially reasonable efforts to obtain a waiver under such
confidentiality agreement to permit the Company to disclose such information
to Parent). The Company shall (i) keep Parent reasonably informed on a prompt
basis of the status and terms of, and changes in, any such Acquisition
Proposal, request, inquiry, offer or proposal (including copies of any
material written requests, proposals, offers or agreements) and (ii) make
available to Parent copies of all written due diligence materials concerning
the Company provided by the Company to such party to the extent not previously
provided or made available to Parent. The Company shall promptly (and, in any
event, within forty-eight (48) hours), following a determination by the
Company Board that an Acquisition Proposal is a Superior Proposal, notify
Parent of such determination.

  

  

 

50  

  

  

(d) Except as permitted by this _Section 7.03_, the Company Board (or any
committee thereof) shall not, and shall not publicly propose to: (i) withhold,
withdraw or adversely qualify (or modify or amend in a manner adverse to
Parent or Merger Sub), the Company Board Recommendation; (ii) approve, adopt
or recommend, or declare the advisability of, any Acquisition Proposal; (iii)
fail to include the Company Board Recommendation in the Proxy Statement; (iv)
fail to recommend against any Acquisition Proposal that is a tender offer or
exchange offer that is subject to Regulation 14D under the Exchange Act within
ten (10) Business Days after the commencement of such Acquisition Proposal
offer; or (v) if an Acquisition Proposal (other than an Acquisition Proposal
subject to Regulation 14D) shall have been publicly announced or disclosed,
fail to reaffirm the Company Board Recommendation upon the written request of
Parent within ten (10) Business Days after such written request (any of the
foregoing actions, an " _Adverse Recommendation Change_ ").

  

  

(e) Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the contrary, prior to the
receipt of the Company Stockholder Approval, if in response to an unsolicited
Acquisition Proposal made after the date of this Agreement that has not been
withdrawn and that did not result from a breach of this _Section 7.03_, the
Company Board determines (after consultation with its outside legal counsel
and financial advisors) that such Acquisition Proposal is a Superior Proposal
and determines (after consultation with its outside legal counsel) that its
failure to take such action is reasonably likely to be inconsistent with its
fiduciary duties under applicable Law, then (i) the Company Board may make an
Adverse Recommendation Change and/or (ii) the Company may terminate this
Agreement pursuant to _Section 9.01(d)(ii)_ in order to enter into an
Acquisition Agreement with respect to such Superior Proposal; _provided_ ,
_however_ , that the Company shall not terminate this Agreement pursuant to
_Section 9.01(d)(ii)_ unless the Company (A) prior to, or concurrently with,
such termination, pays, or causes to be paid, to Parent the Company
Termination Fee and (B) concurrently with such termination, enters into a
definitive agreement that documents the terms and conditions of such Superior
Proposal.

  

  

(f) Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the contrary, at any time
prior to the receipt of the Company Stockholder Approval, but subject to the
Company's and the Company Board's compliance with _Section 7.03(h)_, the
Company Board may make an Adverse Recommendation Change in response to an
Intervening Event if the Company Board determines (after consultation with its
outside legal counsel) that the failure to effect an Adverse Recommendation
Change in response to such Intervening Event is reasonably likely to be
inconsistent with its fiduciary duties under applicable Law.

  

  

 

(g) Prior to effecting an Adverse Recommendation Change with respect to a
Superior Proposal or terminating this Agreement pursuant to _Section
9.01(d)(ii)_ in order to enter into an Acquisition Agreement with respect to a
Superior Proposal, (i) the Company shall notify Parent in writing that it
intends to effect an Adverse Recommendation Change or terminate this Agreement
pursuant to _Section 9.01(d)(ii)_, as applicable, (ii) the Company shall
provide Parent a summary of the material terms and conditions of such Superior
Proposal (including the consideration offered therein and the identity of the
person or "group" making the Superior Proposal) and an unredacted copy of the
Acquisition Agreement, (iii) if requested to do so by Parent, for a period of
three (3) Business Days following delivery of such notice, the Company shall
discuss and negotiate in good faith, and shall make its Representatives
available to discuss and negotiate in good faith, with Parent and Parent's
Representatives, any proposed modifications to the terms and conditions of
this Agreement,

  

  

 

51  

  

  

and (iv) no earlier than the end of such three (3)-Business Day period, the
Company Board shall determine, after considering the terms of any proposed
amendment or modification to this Agreement proposed by Parent during such
three (3)-Business Day period and in consultation with its outside legal
counsel and financial advisors, that such Superior Proposal still constitutes
a Superior Proposal and that its failure to take such action is reasonably
likely to be inconsistent with its fiduciary duties under applicable Law (it
being understood and agreed that any change to the financial or other material
terms of a proposal that was previously the subject of a notice hereunder
shall require a new notice to Parent as provided above, but with respect to
any such subsequent notice references herein to a "three (3)-Business Day
period" shall be deemed references to a "two (2)-Business Day period").

  

  

(h) Prior to effecting an Adverse Recommendation Change with respect to an
Intervening Event, (i) the Company shall notify Parent in writing that it
intends to effect an Adverse Recommendation Change, describing in reasonable
detail the reasons for such Adverse Recommendation Change and the material
facts and circumstances relating to such Intervening Event, (ii) if requested
to do so by Parent, for a period of three (3) Business Days following delivery
of such notice, the Company shall discuss and negotiate in good faith, and
shall make its Representatives available to discuss and negotiate in good
faith, with Parent's Representatives any proposed modifications to the terms
and conditions of this Agreement and (iii) no earlier than the end of such
three (3)-Business Day period, the Company Board shall determine, after
considering the terms of any proposed amendment or modification to this
Agreement agreed upon by Parent during such three (3)-Business Day period and
in consultation with its outside legal counsel, that the failure to effect an
Adverse Recommendation Change would still be reasonably likely to be
inconsistent with the Company Board's fiduciary duties under applicable Law
(it being understood and agreed that any material development in an
Intervening Event that was previously the subject of a notice hereunder shall
require a new notice to Parent as provided above, but with respect to any such
subsequent notice references herein to a "three (3)-Business Day period" shall
be deemed references to a "two (2)-Business Day period").

  

  

(i) Nothing contained in this Agreement shall prevent the Company or the
Company Board from (i) issuing a "stop, look and listen" communication
pursuant to Rule 14d-9(f) under the Exchange Act, making a statement
contemplated by Item 1012(a) of Regulation M-A under the Exchange Act or
otherwise complying with Rule 14d-9 and Rule 14e-2 under the Exchange Act with
respect to an Acquisition Proposal or (ii) making any disclosure to the
Company's stockholders if the Company Board determines (after consultation
with its advisors) that its failure to do so is reasonably likely to be
inconsistent with its fiduciary duties under applicable Law; _provided_ , that
any Adverse Recommendation Change may only be made in accordance with this
_Section 7.03_. For the avoidance of doubt, a factually accurate public
statement that describes the Company's receipt of an Acquisition Proposal and
the operation of this Agreement with respect thereto shall not be deemed an
Adverse Recommendation Change. Nothing in this _Section 7.03_ shall prohibit
the Company from contacting and engaging in any discussions with any person or
group or their respective Representatives who has made an Acquisition Proposal
solely for the purpose of clarifying such Acquisition Proposal and the terms
thereof.

  

  

(j) Except as set forth in _Section 9.03(c)_ with respect to an Acquisition
Proposal, for purposes of this Agreement:

  


 

 

  

 

(i) " _Acquisition Proposal_ " means any proposal or offer, from any person or
"group" (within the meaning of Section 13(d)(3) of the Exchange Act), other
than Parent or Merger Sub, relating to (A) any direct or indirect acquisition,
in a single transaction or a series of related transactions,

  

  

 

52  

  

  

of (1) assets constituting 20% or more of the consolidated assets, revenue or
net income of the Company and its Subsidiaries, taken as a whole (based on the
fair market value thereof), including an acquisition of 20% or more of such
consolidated assets, revenue or net income of the Company and its Subsidiaries
indirectly through the acquisition of equity interests of a Company
Subsidiary, or (2) 20% or more of any class of voting securities of the
Company; (B) any tender offer or exchange offer that, if consummated, would
result in any person beneficially owning, or having the right to acquire
beneficial ownership of, 20% or more of any class of voting securities of the
Company; or (C) any merger, consolidation, business combination,
recapitalization, share exchange, joint venture, restructuring,
reorganization, liquidation, dissolution or other similar transaction
involving the Company (other than any such transaction among the Company and
any of its wholly-owned Subsidiaries or among its wholly-owned Subsidiaries).

  


 

 

  

(ii) " _Intervening Event_ " means any change, effect, event, occurrence or
fact that materially affects the Company and its Subsidiaries, taken as a
whole, that does not relate to an Acquisition Proposal and was not known or
reasonably foreseeable to the Company Board as of the date of this Agreement
(or if known, the magnitude or material consequences of which were not known
or reasonably foreseeable by the Company Board as of the date of this
Agreement), other than any change, effect, event, occurrence or fact resulting
from a material breach of this Agreement by the Company.

  

  

(iii) " _Superior Proposal_ " means any written Acquisition Proposal that is
on terms that the Company Board determines in good faith (after consultation
with its outside legal counsel and financial advisors) and after taking into
account the legal, financial, regulatory and other aspects of such Acquisition
Proposal (including the person or "group" (within the meaning of Section
13(d)(3) of the Exchange Act) making the Acquisition Proposal) (x) is
reasonably capable of being consummated in accordance with its terms and (y)
if consummated would result in a transaction more favorable to the Company's
stockholders, from a financial point of view, than the Merger (taking into
account any proposed amendment or modification proposed by Parent pursuant to
_Section 7.03(g)_). For purposes of the reference to "Acquisition Proposal" in
this definition, all references to "20%" will be deemed references to "50%."

  

  

SECTION 7.04 _Directors ' and Officers' Indemnification and Insurance_.

  

  

(a) From and after the Effective Time, the Surviving Company and its
Subsidiaries shall, and Parent shall cause the Surviving Company to, to the
fullest extent permitted under the DGCL, honor and fulfill in all respects the
obligations of the Company and its Subsidiaries under the indemnification
agreements between the Company or any Subsidiary of the Company and any of
their respective present or former directors and officers (collectively, the "
_Indemnified Parties_ "). In addition, the certificate of incorporation and
by-laws (or similar organizational documents) of the Surviving Company shall
contain provisions no less favorable with respect to exculpation and
indemnification than are set forth in the Company Charter or the Company By-
laws on the date hereof, which provisions shall not be amended, repealed or
otherwise modified for a period of six (6) years from the Effective Time in
any manner that would affect adversely the rights thereunder of individuals
who, at or prior to the Effective Time, were directors, officers, employees,
fiduciaries or agents of the Company or any Subsidiary of the Company.

  

  

 

53  

  

  

(b) For a period of six (6) years after the Effective Time, the Surviving
Company shall, and Parent shall cause the Surviving Company to, to the fullest
extent permitted under applicable Law, indemnify and hold harmless each
Indemnified Party against all costs and expenses (including attorneys' fees),
judgments, fines, losses, claims, damages, liabilities and settlement amounts
paid in connection with any Action (whether arising before or after the
Effective Time), whether civil, criminal, administrative or investigative,
arising out of or relating to any action or omission in their capacity as an
officer, director, employee, fiduciary or agent of the Company or one of its
Subsidiaries, whether occurring on or before the Effective Time. To the
fullest extent permitted by Law, the Surviving Company shall, and Parent shall
cause the Surviving Company to, pay all expenses of each Indemnified Party in
advance of the final disposition of any such Action, subject to receipt of an
undertaking to repay such advances if it is ultimately determined in
accordance with applicable Law that such Indemnified Party is not entitled to
indemnification. In the event of any such Action, (i) the Surviving Company
shall, and Parent shall cause the Surviving Company to, pay the reasonable
fees and expenses of counsel selected by the Indemnified Parties, promptly
after statements therefor are received, (ii) neither Parent nor the Surviving
Company shall settle, compromise or consent to the entry of any judgment in
any pending or threatened Action to which an Indemnified Party is a party (and
in respect of which indemnification could be sought by such Indemnified Party
hereunder), unless such settlement, compromise or consent includes an
unconditional release of such Indemnified Party from all liability arising out
of such Action or such Indemnified Party otherwise consents thereto in
writing, and (iii) Parent and the Surviving Company shall cooperate in the
defense of any such matter; _provided_ , that in the event that any claim for
indemnification is asserted or made within such six (6)-year period, all
rights to indemnification in respect of such claim shall continue until the
disposition of such claim. The rights of each Indemnified Party under this
_Section 7.04_ _(_ _b)_ shall be in addition to any rights such person may
have under the certificate of incorporation or by-laws (or similar
organizational documents) of the Company and the Surviving Company or any of
their Subsidiaries, or under any Law or under any agreement of any Indemnified
Party with the Company or any Subsidiary of the Company.

  

  

(c) Prior to the Effective Time, the Company may obtain "tail" insurance
policies with respect to directors' and officers' liability insurance for
claims arising from facts or events that occurred on or prior to the Effective
Time on terms with respect to coverage, deductibles and amounts no less
favorable than those of such policy in effect on the date hereof for the six
(6)-year period following the Effective Time at a price not to exceed 300% of
the amount per annum the Company paid for such insurance in its last full
fiscal year prior to the date of this Agreement. If the Company does not
obtain "tail" insurance prior to the Effective Time, the Surviving Company
shall either (i) cause to be obtained at the Effective Time "tail" insurance
policies with a claims period of at least six (6) years from the Effective
Time with respect to directors' and officers' liability insurance in amount
and scope at least as favorable as the Company's existing policies for claims
arising from facts or events that occurred on or prior to the Effective Time;
or (ii) maintain in effect for six (6) years from the Effective Time, if
available, the current directors' and officers' liability insurance policies
maintained by the Company; _provided_ , that the Surviving Company may
substitute therefor policies of at least the same coverage containing terms
and conditions that are not less favorable with respect to matters occurring
prior to the Effective Time; _provided_ , _however_ , that in no event shall
the Surviving Company be required to expend pursuant to this _Section 7.04(c)_
more than an amount per year equal to 300% of current annual premiums paid by
the Company for such insurance; _provided_ , _further_ that in the event of an
expiration, termination or cancellation of such current policies, Parent or
the Surviving Company shall be required to obtain as much coverage as is
possible under substantially similar policies for amounts not to exceed such
maximum annual amount in aggregate annual premiums.

  

  

 

54  

  

  

(d) In the event Parent or the Surviving Company or any of their respective
successors or assigns (i) consolidates or amalgamates with or merges into any
other person and shall not be the continuing or surviving company or entity of
such consolidation, amalgamation or merger or (ii) transfers all or
substantially all of its assets to any person, then, and in each such case,
proper provision shall be made so that the successors and assigns of Parent or
the Surviving Company, as the case may be, shall succeed to the obligations
set forth in this _Section 7.04_.

  

  

(e) The provisions of this _Section 7.04_ are intended to be for the benefit
of, and shall be enforceable by, each Indemnified Party, and his or her heirs
and legal representatives, each of whom shall be a third-party beneficiary
under this Agreement.

  

  

(f) Parent shall cause the Surviving Company to perform all of the obligations
of the Surviving Company under this _Section 7.04_.

  

  

SECTION 7.05 _Employee Benefits Matters_.

  

  

(a) Parent hereby agrees that, for a period of one (1) year immediately
following the Effective Time, it shall, or it shall cause the Surviving
Company and its Subsidiaries to: (x) provide each employee of the Company and
of each of its Subsidiaries as of the Effective Time (each, an " _Employee_ ")
with at least the same level of base salary, "holiday mint" bonus (on the same
terms as generally provided to employees in the past and in an amount equal to
a half a month of base salary), cash incentive compensation opportunity and
other variable cash compensation opportunity that was provided to such
Employee immediately prior to the Effective Time, and (y) provide the
Employees with other employee benefits that are no less favorable in the
aggregate than those provided to such Employees and their covered dependents
immediately prior to the Effective Time (excluding all equity-based
compensation). From and after the Effective Time, Parent shall cause the
Surviving Company and its Subsidiaries to honor in accordance with their
terms, all Contracts, policies, plans and commitments of the Company and its
Subsidiaries as in effect immediately prior to the Effective Time that are
applicable to any current or former employees or directors of the Company or
any Subsidiary of the Company, including any short-term or long-term cash
incentive awards granted pursuant to the Company's Senior Executive Cash
Incentive Plan dated January 19, 2017 or the Company's Employee Cash Incentive
Plan dated January 6, 2011, _provided_ , that such incentive awards, to the
extent earned to date, have been properly accrued.

  

  

(b) Employees shall receive credit for all service with the Company and its
Subsidiaries and their respective predecessors under any employee benefit plan
of Parent, the Surviving Company, or any of their Subsidiaries for purposes of
eligibility to participate, vesting, benefit accrual (solely for purposes of
any vacation policy and severance policy) and eligibility to receive benefits,
(but not for benefit accruals or participation eligibility under any defined
benefit pension plan or plan providing post-retirement medical or other
similar benefits) under any employee benefit plan, program or arrangement
established or maintained by Parent, the Surviving Company or any of their
respective Subsidiaries under which any Employee may be eligible to
participate on or after the Effective Time to the same extent recognized by
the Company or any of its Subsidiaries under comparable Plans immediately
prior to the Effective Time.

  

  

 

55  

  

  

For the avoidance of doubt, each Employee's vacation and sick time accruals,
as of the Effective Time, shall carry over to Parent, Surviving Company or any
of their respective Subsidiaries, _provided_ , that such accruals have been
paid or properly recorded as a liability on the books of the relevant entity.
Notwithstanding the foregoing, nothing in this _Section 7.05_ shall be
construed to require crediting of service that would result in (i) duplication
of benefits for the same period of service or (ii) service credit for benefit
accruals under a defined benefit pension plan or any grandfather or frozen
plan Parent benefit plan.

  

  

(c) With respect to the welfare benefit plans, programs and arrangements
maintained, sponsored or contributed to by Parent or the Surviving Company ("
_Parent Welfare Benefit Plans_ ") in which an Employee may be eligible to
participate on or after the Effective Time, Parent and the Surviving Company
shall use commercially reasonable efforts to (i) waive, or cause the insurance
carrier to waive, all limitations as to preexisting and at-work conditions, if
any, with respect to participation and coverage requirements applicable to
each Employee and any covered dependent under any Parent Welfare Benefit Plan
to the same extent waived under a comparable Plan, and (ii) provide credit to
each Employee and any covered dependent for any co-payments, deductibles and
out-of-pocket expenses paid by such Employee or covered dependent under the
Plans during the relevant plan year, up to and including the Effective Time.

  

  

(d) Each of the Company, Parent and Merger Sub acknowledges that the
consummation of the Merger will constitute a change in control of the Company
under the terms of the Company's employee plans, programs, arrangements and
contracts containing provisions triggering payment, vesting or other rights
upon a change in control or similar transaction.

  

  

(e) The provisions contained in this _Section 7.05_ are included for the sole
benefit of the parties hereto, and nothing in this _Section 7.05_, whether
express or implied, shall create any third-party beneficiary or other rights
in any other person, including, without limitation, any employee, former
employee, any participant in any Plan or other benefit plan or arrangement, or
any dependent or beneficiary thereof, or any right to continued employment
with the Company, its Subsidiaries, Parent, the Surviving Company or any of
their respective Affiliates. Nothing contained herein, whether express or
implied, shall be treated as an amendment or other modification of any Plan or
other employee benefit plan or arrangement, or shall limit the right of the
Company, its Subsidiaries, Parent, the Surviving Company or any of their
respective Affiliates to amend, terminate or otherwise modify any Plan or
other employee benefit plan or arrangement in accordance with its terms.

  

  

SECTION 7.06 _Further Action_.

  

  

(a) Upon the terms and subject to the conditions set forth in this Agreement,
Parent, Merger Sub and the Company agree to use reasonable best efforts to
take, or cause to be taken, all actions necessary, proper or advisable to
consummate, as promptly as reasonably practicable, the Transactions, including
using reasonable best efforts to (i) obtain all authorizations, consents,
Orders, approvals, licenses, permits and waivers of all Governmental
Authorities that may be or become necessary for its execution and delivery of,
and the performance of its obligations pursuant to, this Agreement and the
consummation of the Transactions and (ii) provide such other information to
any Governmental Authority as such Governmental Authority may lawfully request
in connection herewith.

  

  

 

56  

  

  

Each party shall make its respective filing, if necessary, pursuant to the HSR
Act as promptly as reasonably practicable, but in any event no later than five
(5) Business Days, following the date of this Agreement and shall make any
other filing pursuant to any other Antitrust Law with respect to the
Transactions as promptly as reasonably practicable. The parties shall supply
as promptly as reasonably practicable thereafter to the appropriate
Governmental Authorities any additional information and documentary material
that may be requested pursuant to the HSR Act. Parent will pay all fees or
make other payments to any Governmental Authority in order to make such
filings or obtain any such authorizations, consents, Orders or approvals.

  

  

(b) Without limiting the generality of the undertaking of Parent and Merger
Sub pursuant to _Section 7.06(a)_, Parent and Merger Sub shall, and shall
cause each of their respective Subsidiaries to, use reasonable best efforts to
take any and all steps necessary to avoid or eliminate each and every
impediment under any Antitrust Law that may be asserted by any Governmental
Authority or any other party so as to enable the parties hereto to consummate
the Transactions as promptly as practicable, and in any event prior to the
Outside Date, including proposing, negotiating, committing to and effecting,
by consent decree, hold separate orders, or otherwise, the sale, divestiture,
license or other disposition of such of Parent's, Merger Sub's and their
respective Subsidiaries' assets, properties or businesses or of the assets,
properties or businesses to be acquired by Parent and Merger Sub pursuant
hereto, and entering into such other arrangements, as are necessary or
advisable in order to avoid the entry of, and the commencement of litigation
seeking the entry of, or to effect the dissolution of, any injunction,
temporary restraining order or other Order in any suit or proceeding that
would otherwise have the effect of materially delaying or preventing the
consummation of the Transactions. In addition, Parent and Merger Sub shall
defend any Action in order to avoid entry of, or to have vacated or
terminated, any Order (whether temporary, preliminary or permanent) that would
prevent or materially impede, interfere with, hinder or delay the consummation
of the Merger or the other Transactions or which would prevent the
consummation of the Merger prior to the Outside Date; _provided_ , _however_ ,
that in no event shall Parent, Merger Sub or any of their Affiliates be
required under this Agreement to commence, threaten or otherwise seek to
commence any Action against any Governmental Authority.

  

  

(c) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement, no party shall
be required, nor shall the Company or any of the Company Subsidiaries be
permitted, to (i) undertake any efforts, or to take or consent to any action,
if such efforts, action or consent, individually or in the aggregate, would
result in a material adverse effect on the business, financial condition,
assets, liabilities or results of operations of the Company and its
Subsidiaries, taken as a whole, (ii) take or agree to take any action with
respect to the assets, properties, business or operations of Parent or its
Affiliates (other than the Company and its Subsidiaries after the Closing) or
(iii) take or commit to take any action with respect to its assets,
properties, business or operations in connection with obtaining the expiration
or termination of the applicable waiting periods under, or any approvals
under, the HSR Act or any Authorization, unless the effectiveness of such
agreement or action is conditioned upon the occurrence of the Closing.

  

  

(d) Subject to applicable Laws, the Company and Parent each shall use its
reasonable best efforts to (i) cooperate in all respects with each other in
connection with any filing or submission with a Governmental Authority in
connection with the Transactions and in connection with any investigation or
other inquiry by or before a Governmental Authority relating thereto and (ii)
keep each other reasonably apprised of the content and status of any
communications with, and communications from, any Governmental Authority with
respect to the Transactions, including promptly notifying the other parties
hereto of any communication it or any of its Affiliates receives from any
Governmental Authority relating to any review or investigation of the
Transactions under the HSR Act and shall permit the other parties to review in
advance (and to consider in good faith any comments made by the other party in
relation to) any proposed material communication by such party to any
Governmental Authority relating to such matters.

  

  

 

57  

  

  

None of the parties to this Agreement shall agree to participate in any
meeting, telephone call or discussion with any Governmental Authority in
respect of any submissions, filings, investigation (including any settlement
of the investigation), litigation or other inquiry relating to the matters
that are the subject of this Agreement unless it consults with the other
parties a reasonable amount of time in advance and, to the extent permitted by
such Governmental Authority, gives the other parties the opportunity to attend
and participate at such meeting, telephone call or discussion. The parties to
this Agreement will coordinate and cooperate fully with each other in
exchanging such information and providing such assistance as the other party
may reasonably request in connection with the foregoing and in seeking early
termination of any applicable waiting periods, including under the HSR Act.
The parties to this Agreement shall provide each other with copies of all
correspondence, filings or communications between them or any of their
representatives, on the one hand, and any Governmental Authority or members of
its staff, on the other hand, with respect to this Agreement and the
Transactions; _provided_ , _however_ , that each party may, as it deems
advisable and necessary, reasonably designate any competitively sensitive
materials provided to the other party as "Outside Counsel Only Material" and
may redact the materials as necessary to (i) remove references concerning the
valuation of the Company, (ii) comply with contractual arrangements and (iii)
address reasonable attorney-client or other privilege or confidentiality
concerns.

  

  

(e) None of the Company, the Company Subsidiaries, Parent, Merger Sub or any

reasonably be expected to make it materially more difficult, or to materially
increase the time required, to: (i) consummate the Merger and the Closing,
(ii) obtain the expiration or termination of the waiting period under the HSR
Act, or the authorizations, consents, Orders and approvals required under any
other Antitrust Law applicable to the Transactions, (iii) avoid the entry of,
avoid the commencement of litigation seeking the entry of, or effect the
dissolution of, any injunction, temporary restraining order or other Order
that would materially delay or prevent the consummation of the Transactions or
(iv) obtain all authorizations, consents, Orders and approvals of Governmental
Authorities necessary for the consummation of the Transactions.

  

  

SECTION 7.07 _Obligations of Parent With Respect to Merger Sub and the
Surviving Company_. Parent hereby guarantees the due, prompt and faithful
payment, performance and discharge by Merger Sub of, and the compliance by
Merger Sub with, all of the covenants, agreements, obligations and
undertakings of Merger Sub under this Agreement in accordance with the terms
of this Agreement, and covenants and agrees to take all actions necessary or
advisable to cause Merger Sub to pay, perform and discharge its obligations
hereunder. During the Pre-Closing Period, Merger Sub shall not, and Parent
shall not permit Merger Sub to, engage in any activity of any nature except as
provided in or expressly contemplated by this Agreement.

  

  

 

58  

  

  

SECTION 7.08 _Public Announcements_. The initial press release relating to
this Agreement shall be a joint press release, the text of which has been
agreed to by each of Parent and the Company. Thereafter, except with respect
to any matters contemplated by _Section 7.03_, _Section 9.01_ or _Section
9.03_, each of Parent and the Company shall consult with each other before
issuing any press release or otherwise making any public statements with
respect to this Agreement or any of the Transactions, except to the extent
public disclosure is required by applicable Law or the rules or regulations of
Nasdaq or any United States national securities exchange on which the Shares
are then traded, in which case the issuing party shall use its reasonable
efforts to consult with the other party before issuing any press release or
making any such public statements. Notwithstanding the foregoing, each party
may, without such consultation, make any public statement in response to
questions from the press, analysts, investors or those attending industry
conferences, make internal announcements to employees and make disclosures in
documents (including exhibits and all other information incorporated therein)
required to be filed or furnished by the Company with the SEC, so long as such
statements are consistent with previous press releases, public disclosures or
public statements made jointly by the parties hereto (or individually in
accordance with this _Section 7.08_). Prior to making any written
communications to the employees or independent contractors of the Company or
any of its Subsidiaries pertaining to compensation or benefit matters that are
affected by the Transactions, the Company shall provide Parent with a copy of
the intended communication at least one (1) Business Day prior to the date of
first use, and the Company shall consider in good faith any comments made to
such communication (it being understood that any subsequent communication that
sets forth substantially the same information shall not require compliance
with this sentence). Parent, Merger Sub and their Affiliates may, without
consultation with, or consent of, the Company, make non-public ordinary course
disclosures and communications to existing or prospective general and limited
partners, equityholders, members, managers and investors of such person, if
the persons receiving such disclosures and communications are subject to
customary confidentiality restrictions restricting public dissemination or use
of such information; _provided_ , that such disclosures and communications do
not include any material non-public and/or proprietary information of the
Company or its Subsidiaries.

  

  

SECTION 7.09 _Transfer Taxes_. The Company and Parent shall cooperate in the
preparation, execution and filing of all returns, questionnaires, applications
or other documents regarding any sales, transfer, stamp, stock transfer, value
added, use, real property transfer and any similar Taxes which become payable
in connection with the Transactions. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary
herein, the Surviving Company agrees to assume liability for and pay any
sales, transfer, stamp, stock transfer, value added, use, real property
transfer and any similar Taxes, as well as any transfer, recording,
registration and other fees that may be imposed upon, payable or incurred in
connection with this Agreement and the Transactions.

  

  

SECTION 7.10 _Stock Exchange De-Listing_. Parent shall cause the Company's
securities to be de-listed from Nasdaq and de-registered under the Exchange
Act as soon as practicable following the Effective Time and, prior to the
Effective Time, the Company shall reasonably cooperate with Parent to
accomplish the foregoing.

  

  

SECTION 7.11 _Stockholder Litigation_. The Company shall notify Parent
promptly of the commencement of, and promptly advise Parent of any material
developments with respect to, any stockholder litigation brought or threatened
in writing against the Company or its directors or officers relating to the
Transactions (" _Transaction Litigation_ ") and shall keep Parent reasonably
informed with respect to the status thereof.

  

  

 

59  

  

  

The Company shall be entitled to direct and control the defense of any such
stockholder litigation; _provided_ , _however_ , the Company shall give Parent
the right to consult and participate in the defense, negotiation or settlement
of any Transaction Litigation and the Company shall give reasonable and good
faith consideration to Parent's advice with respect to such Transaction
Litigation. The Company shall not and shall not permit any of its
Representatives to, settle any Transaction Litigation without Parent's prior
written consent (which shall not be unreasonably withheld, delayed or
conditioned).

  

  

SECTION 7.12 _Takeover Laws_. If any "fair price," "moratorium," "control
share acquisition," "interested shareholder" or other anti-takeover Law
becomes or is deemed to be applicable to this Agreement or the Transactions,
then the Company Board shall grant such approvals and take such actions as are
necessary so that the Transactions may be consummated as promptly as
practicable on the terms contemplated hereby and otherwise act to render such
Law or Laws inapplicable to the foregoing.

  

  

SECTION 7.13 _Certain Filings and Consents_. The Company and Parent shall
cooperate with one another (i) in connection with the preparation of the Proxy
Statement, (ii) in determining whether any action by or in respect of, or
filing with, any Governmental Authority is required, or any actions, consents,
approvals or waivers are required to be obtained from parties to any material
Contracts, in connection with the consummation of the Transactions and (iii)
in taking such actions or making any such filings, furnishing information
required in connection therewith or with the Proxy Statement and seeking
timely to obtain any such actions, consents, approvals or waivers. The Company
and Parent shall reasonably cooperate in seeking to obtain consents and
waivers with respect to Contracts to which the Company or a Subsidiary of the
Company is a party (which may or may not be obtained); _provided_ , that (A)
neither the Company nor any of its Subsidiaries will make or agree to make any
payment of a consent fee, "profit sharing" payment or other consideration
(including increased or accelerated payments) or concede anything of monetary
or economic value for the purposes of obtaining any such consents without the
prior consent of Parent, such consent not to be unreasonably withheld, delayed
or conditioned and (B) no failure to obtain any such consent or waiver or any
Contract termination as a result of such failure shall in and of itself result
in the failure of any condition set forth in _Article VIII_.

  

  

SECTION 7.14 _Financing_.

  

  

(a) Parent and Merger Sub shall take all actions, and do all things,
necessary, proper or advisable to obtain the Required Amount contemplated by
the Equity Commitment Letters, including (i) maintaining in effect the Equity
Commitment Letters, (ii) satisfying on a timely basis all conditions
applicable to Parent and Merger Sub set forth in the Equity Commitment
Letters, (iii) entering into definitive agreements to consummate the Equity
Commitment, (iv) consummating the Equity Commitment contemplated by the Equity
Commitment Letters on or prior to the Closing Date (and in any event prior to
the Outside Date) and (v) fully enforcing the rights of Parent and Merger Sub
and the obligations of Investors under the Equity Commitment Letters,
including (at the request of the Company) by filing one or more lawsuits
against the Investors to fully enforce the rights of Parent and Merger Sub and
the obligations of Investors thereunder (and the Company shall be entitled to
enforce the rights of Parent and Merger Sub and of the Company and its
stockholders by filing such lawsuits against the Investors on behalf of Parent
and Merger Sub and the Company and its stockholders). Neither Parent nor
Merger Sub shall amend, alter, waive, terminate, modify or rescind, or agree
to amend, alter, waive, terminate, modify or rescind, any term of the Equity
Commitment Letters without the prior written consent of the Company.

  

  

 

60  

  

  

Parent shall promptly (and in any event within one (1) Business Day) notify
the Company of (x) the expiration or termination (or attempted or purported
termination, whether or not valid) of the Equity Commitment Letters, (y) any
breach or threatened breach by the Investors of the Equity Commitment Letters
or (z) any refusal by the Investors to provide, any stated intent by the
Investors to refuse to provide, or any expression of concern or reservation by
the Investors regarding their obligation and/or ability to provide, the
Required Amount.

  

  

(b) Nothing herein prevents Parent from pursuing potential Debt Financing
Sources to fund a portion of the Required Amount. Notwithstanding the
foregoing, the parties acknowledge and agree that securing financing is not a
condition to the Closing. Between the date of this Agreement and the Closing,
the Company shall provide such reasonable assistance and cooperation as Parent
may reasonably request in connection with any proposed debt financing (the "
_Financing_ ") ( _provided_ , that such requested assistance and cooperation
does not interfere with the ongoing operation of the Company's business),
including (A) making senior management available for customary lender
meetings, meetings with parties acting as arrangers or agents, sessions with
rating agencies and "roadshow" presentations and cooperating with prospective
lenders in performing their due diligence, (B) reasonably cooperating in the
preparation of any offering memorandum, marketing materials, bank information
memoranda (including with respect to presence of or absence of material non-
public information relating to the Company and its Subsidiaries contained
therein), lender presentations or similar document, (C) furnishing Parent and
its Debt Financing Sources and their respective Representatives with financial
and other pertinent information reasonably available regarding the Company as
may be requested by Parent or as is required to permit Parent to prepare pro
forma financial statements ( _provided_ , that Parent shall be responsible for
the preparation of any pro forma financial statements and pro forma
adjustments giving effect to the transactions contemplated hereby for use in
connection with the Financing), (D) if requested in writing by a Debt
Financing Source, furnishing to such Debt Financing Source information
regarding the Company and its Subsidiaries that is required by U.S. regulatory
authorities under applicable "know your customer" and anti-money laundering
rules and regulations, including the USA PATRIOT Act of 2001, (E) assisting
Parent in preparing presentations with respect to corporate, corporate family,
credit, facility and securities ratings from rating agencies, (F) reasonably
facilitating the pledging of collateral, _provided_ , that no such pledging or
related documents or agreements shall be effective prior to Closing, (G)
taking all corporate actions, subject to the occurrence of the Closing,
reasonably requested by Parent to permit the consummation of the Financing (
_provided_ , that no such action shall be required of the Company Board prior
to the Closing) and (H) executing customary officers' certificates as may be
reasonably requested by Parent in connection with the Financing, _provided_ ,
_however_ , that (x) any such certificate will be not be executed except in
connection with the closing of any Financing and only by officers who will
continue after the Effective Time as an officer of the Surviving Company and
(y) no personal liability will be imposed on the officers or employees
involved. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement, the
Company's breach or violation of any of its representations, warranties or
covenants in this _Section 7.14(b)_ shall not be deemed a breach or violation
for purposes of the conditions precedent set forth in _Section 8.02(a)_ and
_Section 8.02(b)_.

  

  

(c) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this _Section 7.14_, neither
the Company nor any of its Subsidiaries shall be required to take or permit
the taking of any action pursuant to _Section 7.14(b)_ that would (i) (A)
contravene any applicable Law or conflict with or violate the organizational
documents of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries,

  

  

 

61  

  

  

(B) result in any breach or violation of or constitute a default (or an event
which, with notice or lapse of time or both, would become a default) by the
Company or any Company Subsidiary under, or give to others any right of
termination, amendment, acceleration or cancellation of, or result in the
creation of any Liens (other than Permitted Liens) in connection with any
Contract to which the Company or any Company Subsidiary is a party or by which
the Company or a Company Subsidiary or their respective properties or assets
is bound or (C) require the Company or any of its Subsidiaries to disclose
information subject to any attorney-client, attorney work product or other
legal privilege, (ii) cause any covenant, representation or warranty in this
Agreement to be breached by the Company or any of its Subsidiaries, (iii)
require the Company or any of its Subsidiaries to pay any commitment or other
fee or incur any other expense, indemnity liability or obligation, (iv) cause
any director, officer or employee or stockholder of the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries to incur any personal liability, (v) require the Company, its
Subsidiaries or any persons who are directors of the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries to pass any resolution or consent to approve or authorize the
execution of the Financing or (vi) require the Company, its Subsidiaries or
any persons who are officers of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries to
execute or deliver any certificate, document, instrument or agreement or agree
to any change or modification of any existing certificate, document,
instrument or agreement that is effective prior to the Closing ( _provided_ ,
that in no event shall _Section 7.14(b)_ require the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries to cause any officer of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries
that is not continuing in such capacity after the Closing to execute any
certificate, document, instrument or agreement). Nothing in _Section 7.14(b)_
or otherwise shall require the Company or any of its Subsidiaries, prior to
the Closing, to be an issuer or other obligor with respect to any of the
Financing. In the event that the Company reasonably determines that any action
pursuant to this _Section 7.14_ or any other action taken in connection with
the Financing could reasonably be expected to result in a Securitization
Adverse Event or result in a breach or inaccuracy in _Section 4.04(c)_, upon
the written request of the Company, Parent shall immediately cease and cause
its Affiliates to immediately cease the taking of such actions.

  

  

(d) Parent shall, promptly upon request by the Company, reimburse the Company
for all out-of-pocket costs and expenses (including reasonable attorneys'
fees) incurred by the Company or any of its Subsidiaries or their respective
Representatives in connection with such Financing pursuant to _Section
7.14(b)_. In addition, Parent shall indemnify and hold harmless the Company,
its Subsidiaries and their respective Representatives from and against any and
all losses, damages, claims, costs or expenses suffered or incurred by any of
them in connection with the arrangement of the Financing, and any information
used in connection therewith.

  

  

(e) All non-public or otherwise confidential information regarding the Company
or any of its Subsidiaries obtained by Parent, Merger Sub or any of their
respective Representatives pursuant to this _Section 7.14_ shall be kept
confidential in accordance with the Confidentiality Agreement; _provided_ that
Parent and its Representatives shall be permitted to disclose such
confidential information to the Debt Financing Sources and their respective
Representatives pursuant to the terms of the Confidentiality Agreement and
such Debt Financing Sources and their applicable Representatives shall be
deemed to be "Representatives" thereunder.

  

  

  

 

62  

  

  

(f) Parent and Merger Sub acknowledge and agree that it is not a condition to
the Closing or to any of the other obligations under this Agreement that
Parent and Merger Sub obtain the Equity Commitment or any Financing. For the
avoidance of doubt, if the Equity Commitment or any Financing has not been
obtained, Parent and Merger Sub shall continue to be obligated to complete the
Merger and consummate the Transactions.

respect to a Superior Proposal; _provided_ , that (A) prior to, or
concurrently with, such termination the Company pays the Company Termination
Fee due under _Section 9.03_ _(_ _a)(ii)_ and (B) the Company concurrently
enters into such Acquisition Agreement; _provided_ , that the Company shall
not have the right to terminate this Agreement pursuant to this _Section
9.01(d)(ii)_ if the Company Stockholder Approval has been obtained; or

  

  

(iii) any breach or inaccuracy of any representation or warranty or failure to
perform any covenant or agreement on the part of Parent or Merger Sub set
forth in this Agreement shall have occurred that (A) would cause any of the
conditions set forth in _Section 8.03(a)_ or _Section 8.03(b)_ not to be
satisfied, and (B) is not capable of being cured prior to the Outside Date;
_provided_ , that the Company is not then in material breach of this
Agreement.

  

  

SECTION 9.02 _Notice of Termination; Effect of Termination_.

  

  

 

66  

  

  

(a) A terminating party shall provide written notice of termination to the
other parties specifying with reasonable particularity the reason for such
termination, and any such termination in accordance with _Section 9.01_ shall
be effective immediately upon delivery of such written notice to the other
party.

  

  

(b) In the event of termination of this Agreement by any party as provided in
_Section 9.01_, this Agreement shall forthwith become void and of no further
force or effect and there shall be no liability or obligation on the part of
any party, except that (i) this _Section 9.02_, _Section 7.02(b)_, the last
sentence of _Section 7.06(a)_, _Section 7.14(d)_, _Section 7.14(e)_, _Section
9.03_ and _Article X_ shall remain in full force and effect and the
Confidentiality Agreement and Parent Confidentiality Agreement shall remain in
full force and effect in accordance with their terms and (ii) subject to
_Section 9.03(b)_ and _Section 9.03(e)_, nothing herein shall relieve any
party from liability for any fraud or Willful and Material Breach of this
Agreement prior to the Termination Date.

  

  

SECTION 9.03 _Fees and Expenses_. All expenses incurred in connection with
this Agreement, the Transactions, the solicitation of stockholder approvals
and all other matters related to the Transactions shall be paid by the party
incurring such expenses, whether or not the Merger or any other Transaction is
consummated, except as otherwise set forth in this Agreement.

  

  

(a) If this Agreement shall be terminated:

  

  

(i) (A) by the Company or Parent pursuant to _Section 9.01(b)(ii)_, by Parent
pursuant to _Section 9.01(c)(i)_ (and only in circumstances where the Company
Stockholders' Meeting has not been held) or by the Company pursuant to
_Section 9.01(d)(i)_ (and only in circumstances where the Company
Stockholders' Meeting has not been held), (B)(1) in the case of a termination
pursuant to _Section 9.01(b)(ii)_, an Acquisition Proposal shall have been
publicly made or become publicly known, and not publicly withdrawn, prior to
the date of the Company Stockholders' Meeting, and (2) in the case of
termination pursuant to _Section 9.01(c)(i)_ or _Section 9.01(d)(i)_, an
Acquisition Proposal shall have been made to the Company Board or become
publicly known, and not withdrawn, prior to the Termination Date, and (C)
within twelve (12) months following the Termination Date the Company
consummates, or enters into an agreement providing for, a transaction
contemplated by any Acquisition Proposal, then the Company shall pay to Parent
the amount of $47,736,000 (the " _Company Termination Fee_ ") in accordance
with _Section 9.03(b)_; or

  

  

(ii) (A) by Parent pursuant to _Section 9.01(c)(ii)_, or (B) the Company
pursuant to _Section 9.01(d)(ii)_, then the Company shall pay to Parent the
Company Termination Fee in accordance with _Section 9.03_ _(_ _b)_. 
 

  

(b) The Company Termination Fee payable by the Company under this _Section
9.03_ shall be paid to Parent by the Company in immediately available funds
(i) prior to, or concurrently with, termination of this Agreement by the
Company pursuant to _Section 9.01(d)(ii)_ and (ii) within two (2) Business
Days after the date of the event giving rise to the obligation to make such
payment in all other circumstances. The payment to Parent of the Company
Termination Fee shall be the sole and exclusive remedy of Parent and Merger
Sub for any loss suffered by Parent or Merger Sub as a result of the failure
of the Transactions to be consummated and, upon such payment in accordance
with this _Section 9.03_, the Company and other Company Related Parties shall
not have any further liability or obligation relating to or arising out of
this Agreement or the Transactions.

  

  

 

67  

  

  

(c) For purposes of this _Section 9.03_, the definition of Acquisition
Proposal shall have the meaning assigned to such term in _Section 7.03(j)(i)_,
except that references to "20%" in the definition thereof shall be deemed to
be references to "50%" and _clause (C)_ of the definition thereof shall be
deemed amended and replaced in its entirety by the following language: "(C)
any merger, consolidation, business combination, recapitalization, share
exchange, joint venture, restructuring, reorganization, liquidation,
dissolution or other similar transaction involving the Company pursuant to
which stockholders of the Company immediately prior to the consummation of
such transaction would cease to own directly or indirectly at least 50% of the
voting power of the outstanding securities of the Company (or of another
person that directly or indirectly would own all or substantially all the
assets of the Company) immediately following such transaction in the
substantially same proportion as they owned prior to the consummation of such
transaction (other than any such transaction among the Company and any of its
wholly-owned Subsidiaries or among its wholly-owned Subsidiaries)."

  

  

(d) The parties acknowledge and agree that the agreements contained in this
_Section 9.03_ are an integral part of the Transactions, and that, without
these agreements, the parties would not enter into this Agreement. Each of the
parties further acknowledges that the payment of the amounts by the Company
specified in this _Section 9.03_ is not a penalty, but, in each case, is
liquidated damages in a reasonable amount that will compensate Parent and
Merger Sub in the circumstances in which such fees are payable for the efforts
and resources expended and the opportunities foregone while negotiating this
Agreement and in reliance on this Agreement and on the expectation of the
consummation of the Transactions, which amount would otherwise be impossible
to calculate with precision. In no event shall the Company be required to pay
a fee in connection with the termination of this Agreement more than once. If
the Company fails promptly to pay any amount due pursuant this _Section 9.03_,
and, in order to obtain such payment, Parent commences a suit that results in
an award against the Company for such amount, the Company shall pay to Parent
(or its designee) Parent's and Merger Sub's reasonable and documented costs
and expenses (including reasonable attorneys' fees and expenses) in connection
with such suit, together with interest on the applicable amount from the date
such payment was required to be made until the date of payment at the prime
lending rate as published in The Wall Street Journal in effect on the date
such payment was required to be made.

  

  

(e) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement, in the event
that Parent and Merger Sub fail to effect the Closing as and when required
pursuant to the terms of this Agreement for any or no reason or either of
Parent or Merger Sub otherwise breaches this Agreement or fails to perform any
of its covenants hereunder (in any case, whether willfully, intentionally,
unintentionally or otherwise), except for (i) the right of the Company to an
injunction, specific performance or other equitable relief in accordance with
_Section 10.08_, (ii) the rights of the Company to specific performance to
enforce Equity Commitment Letters in accordance with, and subject to, the
terms and conditions thereof and (iii) the rights of the Company under the
Confidentiality Agreement, the sole and exclusive remedy (whether at law, in
equity, in contract, in tort or otherwise) of the Company and its Subsidiaries
and, to the fullest extent permitted under applicable Law, any of their
respective former, current or future officers, employees, directors, partners,
equityholders, managers, members, attorneys, agents, advisors or other
Representatives (the " _Company Related Parties_ ") against Parent,

  

  

 

68  

  

  

any of its Subsidiaries, and any of their respective former, current or future
officers, employees, directors, partners, equityholders, managers, members,
attorneys, agents, advisors or other Representatives or the Equity Financing
Sources (the " _Parent Related Parties_ ") for any breach, loss or damage with
respect to this Agreement and the Transactions shall be (X) for the Company to
terminate this Agreement pursuant to _Section 9.01(b)(i)_ , _Section
9.01(d)(i)_ or _Section 9.01(d)(iii)_ and seek damages against Parent and
Merger Sub to the extent Parent or Merger Sub shall have committed fraud or a
Willful and Material Breach or (Y) under circumstances where Parent has
terminated this Agreement pursuant to _Section 9.01(b)(i)_ or _Section
9.01(c)(i)_ in circumstances in which the Company has the right to terminate
this Agreement pursuant to _Section 9.01(d)(i)_ or _Section 9.01(d)(iii),_
seek damages against Parent and Merger Sub to the extent Parent or Merger Sub
shall have committed fraud or a Willful and Material Breach (in either of
clause (X) or (Y), a " _Pre-Closing Damages Proceeding_ "); _provided_ , that
the monetary damages sought by the Company, and monetary damages payable by
Parent, under all Pre-Closing Damages Proceedings shall not exceed, in the
aggregate, $103,429,028 (the " _Cap_ "). Notwithstanding anything to the
contrary in this Agreement and to the fullest extent permitted under
applicable Law, except for (1) the right of the Company to seek and recover
monetary damages from Parent up to the amount of the Cap pursuant to the terms
and conditions of this _Section 9.03(e)_, (2) the rights of the Company under
the Confidentiality Agreements, (3) the rights of the Company to specific
performance to enforce the Equity Commitment Letters and (4) the rights of the
Company to an injunction, specific performance or other equitable relief in
accordance with _Section 10.08_, to the fullest extent permitted under
applicable Law, none of the Parent Related Parties will have any liability to
the Company Related Parties, whether at Law or equity, in contract in tort or
otherwise, arising from or in connection with any breach by Parent or Merger
Sub of any of their representations, warranties, covenants or agreements
contained in this Agreement or arising from any claim or cause of action that
the Company or any of its Affiliates may have relating to this Agreement
(including a failure to effect the Closing as and when required pursuant to
the terms of this Agreement) and, to the fullest extent permitted by Law, none
of the Company Related Parties will have any rights or claims against any or
the Parent Related Parties relating to any such matters. In no event shall the
Company or any Subsidiary of the Company, and the Company shall not cause any
of the Company Related Parties to, seek or cause, authorize or encourage to be
sought on behalf of any such person any damages from, or otherwise bring any
claim or proceeding against, any of the Parent Related Parties arising from or
in connection with any breach of this Agreement, other than (A) a Pre-Closing
Damages Proceeding against Parent pursuant to this Agreement (subject to the
limitations set forth in this _Section 9.03(e)_ ), (B) pursuant to the
Confidentiality Agreement, (C) specific performance to enforce the Equity
Commitment Letters in accordance with, and subject to, the terms and
conditions thereof or (D) for an injunction, specific performance or other
equitable relief in accordance with _Section 10.08_. Nothing in this _Section
9.03(e)_ shall in any way expand or be deemed or construed to expand the
circumstances in which Parent or any other Parent Related Party may be liable
under this Agreement or in connection with any of the transactions
contemplated hereby.

  

  

(f) For purposes of this Agreement, " _Equity Financing Sources_ " means each
of the Investors and their respective former, current and future Affiliates,
and each of the Investor's (and their respective Affiliates') former, current
and future equityholders, members, partners, or Representatives and any heirs,
executors, successors and assigns of any of the foregoing; provided that
"Equity Financing Sources" shall be deemed not to include Parent or Merger
Sub.

SECTION 10.03 _Interpretation and Rules of Construction_. When a reference is
made in this Agreement to an Annex, an Exhibit, an Article or a Section, such
reference shall be to an Annex, an Exhibit, an Article or a Section of this
Agreement unless otherwise indicated. The table of contents, index of defined
terms and headings contained in this Agreement are for reference purposes only
and shall not affect in any way the meaning or interpretation of this
Agreement. Whenever the words "include," "includes" or "including" are used in
this Agreement, they shall be deemed to be followed by the words "without
limitation." The words "hereof," "hereto," "hereby," "herein" and "hereunder"
and words of similar import when used in this Agreement shall refer to this
Agreement as a whole and not to any particular provision of this Agreement.
Documents, materials and information are deemed to have been "made available"
to Parent and Merger Sub, if such documents, materials or information were at
least one (1) Business Day prior to the date hereof (a) available for review
by such person and its Representatives through the electronic data room
entitled "Project Sky," which is hosted by Merrill Datasite in connection with
the Transactions, (b) disclosed in a SEC Document filed and publicly
available, or (c) otherwise provided by or on behalf of the Company in writing
to Parent, Merger Sub or their Representatives. The term "or" is not
exclusive. The word "extent" in the phrase "to the extent" shall mean the
degree to which a subject or other thing extends, and such phrase shall not
mean simply "if." The definitions contained in this Agreement are applicable
to the singular as well as the plural forms of such terms and to the masculine
as well as to the feminine and neuter genders of such term. Any Contract or
Law defined or referred to herein means such Contract or Law as from time to
time amended, modified or supplemented. All accounting terms used and not
defined herein have the respective meanings given to them under GAAP, except
to the extent otherwise specifically indicated or that the context otherwise
requires. References to "ordinary course of business" refers to the ordinary
course of business of the Company and the Subsidiaries of the Company, taken
as a whole, materially consistent with past practice. References to a person
are also to its successors and permitted assigns. References to a "wholly-
owned Subsidiary" shall mean, with respect to any Subsidiary of any person,
that 100% of the outstanding capital stock of such Subsidiary is owned,
directly or indirectly, by such person and/or its other wholly-owned
Subsidiaries. References to a "wholly-owned Company Subsidiary" shall mean,
with respect to any Company Subsidiary, that 100% of the outstanding capital
stock of such Company Subsidiary is owned, directly or indirectly, by the
Company and/or its other wholly-owned Subsidiaries. If the last day of a
period of time before which, within which or following which any act is to be
done or step taken pursuant to this Agreement is not a Business Day, the
period shall end on the immediately following Business Day. Unless otherwise
specifically indicated, all references to "dollars" and "$" will be deemed
references to the lawful money of the United States of America. Each of the
parties has participated in the drafting and negotiation of this Agreement. If
an ambiguity or question of intent or interpretation arises, this Agreement
must be construed as if it is drafted by all the parties, and no presumption
or burden of proof shall arise favoring or disfavoring any party by virtue of
authorship of any of the provisions of this Agreement. References to "days"
shall mean "calendar days" unless expressly stated otherwise. Whenever this
Agreement requires a Company Subsidiary to take any action, such requirement
shall be deemed to include an undertaking on the part of the Company to cause
such Company Subsidiary to take such action and, after the Effective Time, on
the part of Parent and the Surviving Company to cause such Subsidiary to take
such action.

  

  

 

71  

  

  

Whenever this Agreement requires Merger Sub to take any action, such
requirement shall be deemed to include an undertaking on the part of Parent to
cause Merger Sub to take such action. All references herein to "parties" shall
be to the parties hereto unless the context shall otherwise require.

  

  

SECTION 10.04 _Severability_. If any term or other provision of this Agreement
is invalid, illegal or incapable of being enforced by any Law or public
policy, all other conditions and provisions of this Agreement shall
nevertheless remain in full force and effect so long as the economic or legal
substance of the Transactions is not affected in any manner materially adverse
to any party. Upon such determination that any term or other provision is
invalid, illegal or incapable of being enforced, the parties hereto shall
negotiate in good faith to modify this Agreement so as to effect the original
intent of the parties as closely as possible in a mutually acceptable manner
in order that the Transactions be consummated as originally contemplated to
the fullest extent possible.

  

  

SECTION 10.05 _Entire Agreement_. This Agreement, taken together with the
Company Disclosure Schedule, the Confidentiality Agreement (together with any
joinders or other agreements entered into in connection therewith) and the
Parent Confidentiality Agreement and the Equity Commitment Letters,
constitutes the entire agreement among the parties with respect to the subject
matter hereof and thereof and supersedes all prior agreements and
undertakings, both written and oral, among the parties hereto, or any of them,
with respect to the subject matter hereof and thereof.

  

  

SECTION 10.06 _Assignment_. Neither this Agreement nor any of the parties'
respective rights, interests or obligations under this Agreement shall be
assigned, in whole or in part, by operation of Law or otherwise by any of the
parties hereto without the prior written consent of the other parties hereto;
_provided_ , that Parent and Merger Sub may assign all or any of their rights
and obligations hereunder to (a) any of their respective direct or indirect
wholly-owned Subsidiaries and/or (b) their Debt Financing Sources for purposes
of creating a security interest herein or otherwise assigning as collateral in
respect of such financing so long as such assignment would not reasonably be
expected to have a Parent Material Adverse Effect. No assignment by any party
shall relieve such party of any of its obligations hereunder. Subject to the
immediately preceding sentence, any purported assignment without such consent
shall be void. Subject to the preceding sentences, this Agreement will be
binding upon, inure to the benefit of, and be enforceable by, the parties and
their respective successors and assigns.

  

  

SECTION 10.07 _Parties in Interest_. This Agreement shall be binding upon and
inure solely to the benefit of each party hereto and their respective
successors and permitted assigns, and nothing in this Agreement, express or
implied, is intended to or shall confer upon any other person any right,
benefit or remedy of any nature whatsoever under or by reason of this
Agreement, except for (a) the provisions of _Section 7.04_ (which are for the
benefit of the persons covered thereby and may be enforced by such persons
after the Effective Time), (b) after the Effective Time occurs, for the rights
of the holders of Shares to receive the Merger Consideration to which they are
entitled to receive in accordance with the terms and conditions of this
Agreement, (c) the rights, at and after the Effective Time, of the holders of
the Company Stock Options and Restricted Stock Units to receive the payments
contemplated by _Section 3.04_, (d) the right of the Company to damages
(including damages based on loss of the economic benefit of the Transactions
to the Company's stockholders) on behalf of the Company's stockholders, (e)
the third-party beneficiary rights specified in the Equity Commitment Letters
and (f) the rights of the Company Related Parties and Parent Related Parties
set forth in _Section 9.03(e)_ and _Section 10.14_.

  

  

 

72  

  

  

SECTION 10.08 _Specific Performance_.

  

  

(a) The parties acknowledge and agree that irreparable damage would occur in
the event that any of the provisions of this Agreement were not performed in
accordance with their specific terms or were otherwise breached. Each party
agrees that, in the event of any breach or threatened breach by any other
party of any covenant or obligation contained in this Agreement or the Equity
Commitment Letters, the non-breaching party shall be entitled (in addition to
any other remedy that may be available to it whether in Law, equity or
otherwise, including monetary damages) to (i) an Order of specific performance
to enforce the observance and performance of such covenant or obligation and
(ii) an injunction restraining such breach or threatened breach and Parent and
Merger Sub agree not to assert that a remedy of specific enforcement is
unenforceable, invalid, contrary to Law or inequitable for any reason, nor to
object to a remedy of specific performance on the basis that a remedy of
monetary damages would provide an adequate remedy for any such breach or for
any other reason. In circumstances where Parent, Merger Sub or the Company is
obligated to consummate any Transaction and such Transaction has not been
consummated, each of Parent, Merger Sub and the Company expressly acknowledges
and agrees that the other party and its stockholders shall have suffered
irreparable harm, that monetary damages will be inadequate to compensate such
other party and its stockholders and that such other party on behalf of itself
and its stockholders shall be entitled to enforce specifically Parent's and
Merger Sub's or the Company's, as the case may be, obligation to consummate
such Transaction and, subject to _Section 10.08(b)_, the terms of the Equity
Commitment Letters (and specifically that the Company is entitled to enforce
the terms of the Equity Commitment Letters (whether under this Agreement or
the Equity Commitment Letters), including causing the Investors to provide the
Equity Commitment and otherwise cause Parent or Merger Sub to consummate the
Transactions on behalf of itself and its stockholders, which right is hereby
acknowledged and agreed by Parent and Merger Sub). Each party further agrees
that no other party or any other person shall be required to obtain, furnish
or post any bond or similar instrument in connection with or as a condition to
obtaining any remedy referred to in this _Section 10.08_, and each party
irrevocably waives any right it may have to require the obtaining, furnishing
or posting of any such bond or similar instrument. In the event that a party
initiates a proceeding seeking equitable relief pursuant to this _Section
10.08_, the Outside Date shall automatically be extended until such proceeding
is finally resolved.

  

  

(b) Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the contrary, the parties
hereby agree that the Company shall only be entitled to enforce specifically
the terms of the Equity Commitment Letters (whether under this Agreement or
the Equity Commitment Letters), including causing all or any portion of the
Equity Commitment to be funded or otherwise cause Parent or Merger Sub to
consummate the Merger or the other Transactions (including the obligation to
pay the aggregate Merger Consideration) if (i) the conditions set forth in
_Section 8.01_ and _Section 8.02_ have been satisfied or waived and remain
satisfied or waived at the time when the Closing would have occurred but for
the failure of the Equity Commitment to be funded or of Parent and Merger Sub
to consummate the Merger (other than those conditions that by their nature are
to be satisfied at the Closing but which were capable of being satisfied at
such time), (ii) the Company has confirmed to Parent in writing that if
specific performance is granted and the Equity Commitment is funded, then the
Company will proceed with the Closing and (iii) Parent and Merger Sub have
failed to consummate the Merger by the date the Merger is required to have
occurred pursuant to _Section 2.02_.

  

  

 

73  

  

  

(c) Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the contrary, under no
circumstances shall the Company be entitled to the grant of specific
performance which results in the consummation of the Merger (including the
funding of the Equity Commitment, whether under this Agreement or the Equity
Commitment Letters, and the payment of the Merger Consideration), on the one
hand, and be awarded monetary damages whatsoever, on the other hand.

  

  

SECTION 10.09 _Governing Law_.

  

  

(a) This Agreement shall be governed by and construed in accordance with the
Laws of the State of Delaware without regard to the principles of conflicts of
law that would cause the application of law of any jurisdiction other than
those of the State of Delaware.

  

  

(b) The parties hereto agree that any Action seeking to enforce any provision
of, or based on any matter arising out of or in connection with, this
Agreement or the Transactions (whether brought by any party or any of its
Affiliates or against any party or any of its Affiliates) shall be heard and
determined exclusively in the Court of Chancery of the State of Delaware;
_provided_ , _however_ , that, if such court does not have jurisdiction over
such Action, such Action shall be heard and determined exclusively in any
federal or state court located in the State of Delaware. Consistent with the
preceding sentence, each of the parties hereto hereby (i) submits to the
exclusive jurisdiction of any federal or state court sitting in the State of
Delaware for the purpose of any Action arising out of or relating to this
Agreement brought by either party hereto; (ii) agrees that service of process
will be validly effected by sending notice in accordance with _Section 10.02_;
and (iii) irrevocably waives, and agrees not to assert by way of motion,
defense, or otherwise, in any such Action, any claim that it is not subject
personally to the jurisdiction of the above-named courts, that its property is
exempt or immune from attachment or execution, that the Action is brought in
an inconvenient forum, that the venue of the Action is improper, or that this
Agreement or the Transactions may not be enforced in or by any of the above
named courts.

  

  

SECTION 10.10 _Waiver of Jury Trial_. EACH OF THE PARTIES HERETO HEREBY WAIVES
TO THE FULLEST EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW ANY RIGHT IT MAY HAVE TO A
TRIAL BY JURY WITH RESPECT TO ANY LITIGATION DIRECTLY OR INDIRECTLY ARISING
OUT OF, UNDER OR IN CONNECTION WITH THIS AGREEMENT OR THE TRANSACTIONS. EACH
OF THE PARTIES HERETO HEREBY (A) CERTIFIES THAT NO REPRESENTATIVE, AGENT OR
ATTORNEY OF THE OTHER PARTY HAS REPRESENTED, EXPRESSLY OR OTHERWISE, THAT SUCH
OTHER PARTY WOULD NOT, IN THE EVENT OF LITIGATION, SEEK TO ENFORCE THE
FOREGOING WAIVER AND (B) ACKNOWLEDGES THAT IT HAS BEEN INDUCED TO ENTER INTO
THIS AGREEMENT AND THE TRANSACTIONS CONTEMPLATED BY THIS AGREEMENT, AS
APPLICABLE, BY, AMONG OTHER THINGS, THE MUTUAL WAIVERS AND CERTIFICATIONS IN
THIS _SECTION_ _10.10_.

  

  

SECTION 10.11 _Amendment_. This Agreement may be amended, by written agreement
of the parties hereto, at any time prior to the Effective Time; _provided_ ,
_however_ , that following the receipt of the Company Stockholder Approval, no
amendment may be made that would reduce the amount or change the form of the
Merger Consideration or that would otherwise require the approval of the
stockholders of the Company under applicable Law.

SECTION 10.12 _Waiver_. At any time prior to the Effective Time, Parent (on
behalf of itself and Merger Sub), on the one hand, and the Company, on the
other hand, may (a) extend the time for the performance of any obligation or
other act of any other party hereto, (b) waive any inaccuracy in the
representations and warranties of any other party contained herein or in any
document delivered pursuant hereto and (c) waive compliance with any agreement
of any other party or any condition to its own obligations contained herein.
Any such extension or waiver shall be valid if set forth in an instrument in
writing signed by the party or parties to be bound thereby. The failure of any
party to assert any of its rights under this Agreement or otherwise shall not
constitute a waiver of those rights.

  

  

SECTION 10.13 _Company Disclosure Schedule_. The parties hereto agree that any
reference in a particular Section of the Company Disclosure Schedule shall be
deemed to be disclosed and incorporated by reference in each other Section of
the Company Disclosure Schedule to which such information reasonably relates
as though fully set forth in such other Section. Certain items and matters may
be listed in the Company Disclosure Schedule for informational purposes only
and may not be required to be listed therein by the terms of this Agreement.
In no event shall the listing of items or matters in the Company Disclosure
Schedule be deemed or interpreted to broaden, or otherwise expand the scope
of, the representations and warranties or covenants contained in this
Agreement. The mere inclusion of an item in the Company Disclosure Schedule as
an exception to a representation or warranty (a) shall not be deemed an
admission that such item represents a material exception or material event,
circumstance, change, effect, development or condition or that such item would
have a Material Adverse Effect on the Company and (b) shall not be construed
as an admission or indication by the Company of any non-compliance with, or
breach or violation of, any third-party rights (including any Intellectual
Property), any Contract or agreement or any Law or Order of any Governmental
Authority, such disclosures having been made solely for the purposes of
creating exceptions to the representations made herein or of disclosing any
information required to be disclosed under this Agreement.

  

  

SECTION 10.14 _Non-Recourse_. 
 

  

 

(a) Without limiting any of the express terms or conditions of this Agreement,
each party agrees, on behalf of itself and its Affiliates and Representatives,
that other than pursuant to (A) the Confidentiality Agreement or (B) pursuant
to the Equity Commitment Letters, all proceedings, claims, obligations,
liabilities or causes of action (whether in Contract or in tort, in Law or in
equity or otherwise, or granted by statute or otherwise, whether by or through
attempted piercing of the corporate, limited partnership or limited liability
company veil or any other theory or doctrine, including alter ego or
otherwise) that may be based upon, in respect of, arise under, out or by
reason of, be connected with, or relate to (i) this Agreement or the
Transactions, (ii) the negotiation, execution or performance of this Agreement
(including any representation or warranty made in, in connection with, or as
an inducement to, this Agreement), (iii) any breach or violation of this
Agreement and (iv) any failure of the Transactions to be consummated, in each
case, may be made only against (and are those solely of) the persons that are
expressly identified herein as a party to this Agreement (or a party to any
such other agreement referenced herein or contemplated hereunder) and in
accordance with, and subject to the terms and conditions of, this Agreement
(or the terms of any such other agreement referenced herein or contemplated
hereunder).

  

  

 

75  

  

  

(b) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained herein, the Company (on
behalf of itself and its Affiliates and, to the fullest extent legally
permissible, the other Company Related Parties), other than the Company's
right to seek to specifically enforce the Equity Commitment Letters in
accordance with, and subject to, the terms and conditions of this Agreement
and the Equity Commitment Letters, (i) hereby waives any claims or rights
against any Equity Financing Source relating to or arising out of this
Agreement, the Equity Commitment Letters, the Equity Commitment and the
transactions contemplated hereby and thereby, whether at law or in equity and
whether in tort, contract or otherwise, and (ii) hereby agrees not to bring or
support any Action against any Equity Financing Source in connection with this
Agreement, the Equity Commitment Letters, the Equity Commitment and the
transactions contemplated hereby and thereby, whether at law or in equity and
whether in tort, contract or otherwise.

  


 

 

  

SECTION 10.15 _Counterparts_. This Agreement may be executed and delivered
(including by facsimile transmission or other means of electronic
transmission, such as by electronic mail in "pdf" form) in counterparts, and
by the different parties hereto in separate counterparts, each of which when
executed shall be deemed to be an original but all of which taken together
shall constitute one and the same agreement.
