 **AGREEMENT AND PLAN OF MERGER**

  

THIS AGREEMENT AND PLAN OF MERGER (this " _Agreement_ "), dated as of August
16, 2003, is made by and among Precision Castparts Corp., an Oregon
corporation (" _Parent_ "), Star Acquisition, LLC, a Pennsylvania limited
liability company of which Parent is the sole member (" _Acquisition Sub_ "),
and SPS Technologies, Inc., a Pennsylvania corporation (the " _Company_ ").

  

 **RECITALS**

  

WHEREAS, the parties wish to effect a business combination through a merger
(the " _Merger_ ") of the Company with and into Acquisition Sub on the terms
and conditions set forth in this Agreement (defined terms having the meanings
indicated in Article VII) and in accordance with the Pennsylvania Business
Corporation Law of 1988, as amended (the " _PBCL_ ") and the Pennsylvania
Limited Liability Company Law of 1994, as amended (the " _PLLCL_ ");

  

WHEREAS, it is intended that the Merger will qualify as a tax-free
reorganization within the meaning of Section 368(a) of the Internal Revenue
Code of 1986, as amended (the " _Code_ ");

  

WHEREAS, the Board of Directors of the Company (the " _Company Board_ ") has
determined that the Merger is advisable and in the best interests of the
Company and its shareholders and has approved this Agreement, the Merger and
the other transactions contemplated by this Agreement;

  

WHEREAS, the Board of Directors of Parent (the " _Parent Board_ ") and the
managers of Acquisition Sub have approved this Agreement, the Merger and the
other transactions contemplated by this Agreement; and

  

WHEREAS, concurrently with the execution and delivery of this Agreement, to
induce Parent to enter into this Agreement, certain shareholders of the
Company are each entering into a voting agreement in the form attached hereto
as Exhibit A-1 or Exhibit A-2 (collectively, the " _Voting Agreements_ ");

  

NOW, THEREFORE, in consideration of the mutual representations, warranties
and covenants set forth herein, and intending to be legally bound, Parent,
Acquisition Sub and the Company hereby agree as follows:

  

 **ARTICLE I 
  
 THE MERGER**

  

1.1 _The Merger_.

  

(a) Upon the terms and subject to the conditions of this Agreement, at the
Effective Time, the Company shall be merged with and into Acquisition Sub in
accordance with the PBCL and the PLLCL, whereupon the separate existence of
the Company shall cease, and Acquisition Sub shall be the surviving entity in
the Merger (the " _Surviving Entity_ ") and shall

  



  

1      
   



  

continue to be governed by the laws of the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania, and
the separate limited liability company existence of Acquisition Sub with all
its rights, privileges, immunities, powers and franchises shall continue
unaffected by the Merger. The Merger shall have the effects specified in the
PBCL and the PLLCL.

  

(b) The Certificate of Organization of Acquisition Sub, as in effect
immediately prior to the Effective Time, shall be the Certificate of
Organization of the Surviving Entity until thereafter amended as provided by
law and such Certificate of Organization, and the Operating Agreement of
Acquisition Sub, as in effect immediately prior to the Effective Time, shall
be the Operating Agreement of the Surviving Entity until thereafter amended
as provided by applicable Law, by such Certificate of Organization or by such
Operating Agreement.

  

1.2 _Effective Time_. As promptly as practicable after all of the conditions
set forth in Article V shall have been satisfied or, if permissible, waived
by the party entitled to the benefit of the same, the appropriate parties
shall duly execute and file a certificate of merger (the " _Certificate of
Merger_ ") with the Department of State of the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania
in accordance with the PBCL and the PLLCL and shall take such other and
further actions as may be required by applicable law to make the Merger
effective. The time the Merger becomes effective in accordance with
applicable law is hereinafter referred to as the " _Effective Time_ ".

  

1.3 _Closing_. The closing of the Merger (the " _Closing_ ") shall take place
(a) at the offices of Stoel Rives LLP, 900 S.W. Fifth Avenue, Portland,
Oregon 97204, at such time and on a date to be specified by the parties,
which shall be no later than the fifth Business Day following the date on
which the last of the conditions set forth in Article V hereof shall
be satisfied or waived in accordance with this Agreement (other than
conditions which by their terms are required to be satisfied or waived at the
Closing, including, without limitation, the conditions set forth in Sections
5.2(e), 5.2(j) and 5.3(c)) (the " _Closing Date_ ") or (b) at such other
place, time and date as Parent and the Company may agree.

  

1.4 _Managers and Officers_. The managers and officers of Acquisition
Sub immediately prior to the Effective Time shall, immediately after the
Effective Time, be the managers and officers of the Surviving Entity, each to
hold office in accordance with the Certificate of Organization and Operating
Agreement of the Surviving Entity.

  

1.5 _Conversion of Securities_. At the Effective Time, by virtue of
the Merger and without any further action on the part of Parent, Acquisition
Sub or the Company:

  

(a) _Excluded Shares_. Each Company Share owned by the Company or any Company
Subsidiary or by Parent, Acquisition Sub, or any Parent
Subsidiary immediately prior to the Effective Time (collectively, the "
_Excluded Shares_ ") shall be canceled and extinguished and no payment or
distribution shall be made with respect thereto.

  

(b) _Merger Consideration_. Subject to the further provisions of this Section
1.5, each Company Share, other than Excluded Shares, issued and outstanding
immediately prior to the Effective Time shall be converted into the right to
receive: (i) for each Company Share in respect of which an effective election
(an " _Election_ ") shall have been made, one of the following:  (A) $43.00
in cash (the " _Cash Consideration_ "), subject to adjustment as provided in

  



  

2    **    
 **  



  

Sections 1.5(c) and 1.5(f) or (B) 1.36 (as may be increased pursuant to
Section 1.5(f), the " _Exchange Ratio_ ") Parent Shares (the " _Stock
Consideration_ "), subject to adjustment as provided in Sections 1.5(d) and
1.5(f), and (ii) for each Company Share in respect of which no effective
Election shall have been made for any reason (a " _No Election Share_ "), a
combination of cash and Parent Shares equal to one-half of the Cash
Consideration and one-half of the Stock Consideration, as each is adjusted as
provided in Sections 1.5(c), 1.5(d) and 1.5(f). The consideration
payable pursuant to this Section 1.5(b), together with cash payments in lieu
of fractional shares pursuant to Section 1.5(h) is referred to herein
collectively as the " _Merger Consideration_ ".

  

(c) _Cash Election_. Each record holder of Company Shares, other than
Excluded Shares, who makes an effective Election to receive cash (a "
_Cash Election_ ") shall be entitled to receive for each of such holders
Company Shares as to which such Cash Election is made the Cash Consideration
in cash (without interest), or, subject to Section 1.5(f), a combination of
cash and Parent Shares, solely as provided in clause (i) or (ii) below.

  

(i) If the Available Cash Amount equals or exceeds the Cash Election Amount,
each Company Share as to which an effective Cash Election is made shall be
converted into the right to receive the Cash Consideration (without
interest).

  

(ii) If the Cash Election Amount exceeds the Available Cash Amount, then each
Company Share as to which an effective Cash Election is made shall be
converted into the right to receive (A) an amount of cash (without interest)
equal to the Cash Consideration multiplied by a fraction, the numerator of
which shall be the Available Cash Amount and the denominator of which shall
be the Cash Election Amount (such fraction being the " _Cash Fraction_ ") and
(B) a number of Parent Shares equal to the product of (x) the Exchange Ratio
and (y) a fraction equal to one minus the Cash Fraction.

  

(iii) For purposes of this Section 1.5(c):

  

(A) " _Available Cash Amount_ " shall mean the product of (x) one-half of the
Cash Consideration and (y) the total number of Company Shares outstanding
immediately prior to the Effective Time.

  

(B) " _Cash Election Amount_ " shall mean the product of (x) the number of
Company Shares as to which an effective Cash Election is made (including one-
half of the number of No Election Shares) and (y) the Cash Consideration.

  

Cash Elections shall be made on a form, mutually acceptable to Parent and the
Company, designed for the purpose of making Elections (an " _Election Form_
"), accompanied by Certificates for the Company Shares to which such Election
Form relates, as provided in Section 1.5(g).

  

(d) _Stock Election_. Subject to Section 1.5(f), each record holder of
Company Shares, other than Excluded Shares, who makes an effective Election
to receive Parent Shares (a " _Stock Election_ ") shall be entitled to
receive for each of such holders Company Shares as to

  



  



  

3    **    
 **  



  

which such Stock Election is made Parent Shares or a combination of cash and
Parent Shares, solely as provided in clause (i) or (ii) below.

  

(i) If the Available Stock Amount equals or exceeds the Stock Election
Amount, each Company Share as to which an effective Stock Election is made
shall be converted into the right to receive the Stock Consideration.

  

(ii) If the Stock Election Amount exceeds the Available Stock Amount, then
each Company Share as to which an effective Stock Election is made shall be
converted into the right to receive (A) a number of Parent Shares equal to
the Exchange Ratio multiplied by a fraction, the numerator of which shall be
the Available Stock Amount and the denominator of which shall be the Stock
Election Amount (such fraction being the " _Stock Fraction_ ") and (B) an
amount of cash (without interest) equal to the product of (x) the Cash
Consideration and (y) a fraction equal to one minus the Stock Fraction.

  

(iii) For purposes of this Section 1.5(d):

  

(A) " _Available Stock Amount_ " shall mean the product of (x) one-half of
the Exchange Ratio (before any adjustment under Section 1.5(f)) and (y) the
total number of Company Shares outstanding immediately prior to the Effective
Time.

  

(B) " _Stock Election Amount_ " shall mean the product of (x) the number of
Company Shares as to which an effective Stock Election is made (including
one-half of the number of No Election Shares) and (y) the Exchange Ratio
(before any adjustment under Section 1.5(f)).

  

Stock Elections shall be made on the Election Form, accompanied by
Certificates for the Company Shares to which such Election Form relates, as
provided in Section 1.5(g).

  

(e) _No Election_. If no effective Election shall have been made for any
reason with respect to any Company Shares, other than Excluded Shares, the
holders of such No Election Shares shall be treated for purposes of this
Section 1.5 as having made an effective Cash Election with respect to one-
half (.5) of each No Election Share (subject to adjustment as provided
in Sections 1.5(c) and 1.5(f)) and as having made an effective Stock Election
with respect to one-half (.5) of each No Election Share (subject to
adjustment as provided in Sections 1.5(d) and 1.5(f)).

  

(f) _Further Adjustments_.

  

(i) In addition to the adjustments set forth above, Parent shall have the
right, exercisable in its sole discretion in writing, to increase (the amount
of such increase, a " _Stock Adjustment_ ") the aggregate stock portion of
the Merger Consideration that would otherwise be payable under this Section
1.5 (the " _Aggregate Stock Consideration_ ") to an amount equal to 40% of
the aggregate value of the Merger Consideration determined based upon the per
share last sale price of Parent Common Stock as reported by the New York
Stock Exchange not later than 3:00 pm, Eastern

  



  

4      
   



  

Time, on the Closing Date (the " _Adjusted Aggregate Stock Consideration_ ").
If there is a Stock Adjustment, Parent shall increase the Exchange Ratio such
that the value of the aggregate number of Parent Shares to be issued in
connection with the Merger equals the Adjusted Aggregate Stock Consideration,
and the number of Parent Shares to be delivered to each shareholder of the
Company in connection with the Merger under this Section 1.5 shall be
determined based upon the Exchange Ratio as so increased (without
recalculation of the Available Stock Amount or the Stock Election Amount
under Section 1.5(d) or any adjustment to the aggregate cash portion of the
Merger Consideration, other than cash in lieu of fractional shares
pursuant to Section 1.5(h)).

  

(ii) If, between the date of this Agreement and the Effective Time, the
Parent Shares or Company Shares outstanding shall have changed, by reason of
any reclassification, subdivision, recapitalization, stock split (including
reverse stock split) or stock dividend, then the Exchange Ratio and/or the
amount or form of any portion of the Merger Consideration that would
otherwise be payable in Parent Shares or in respect of Company Shares and
other definitions and provisions of this Agreement dependent thereon, shall
be equitably adjusted to give effect to such event.

  

(g) _Election Procedure_. At the time of the mailing of the
Proxy Statement/Prospectus to holders of record of Company Shares entitled to
vote at the Company Shareholders Meeting, Parent will mail, or cause to be
mailed, an Election Form and a letter of transmittal to each such holder. To
be effective, an Election Form must be properly completed, signed and
actually received by the Exchange Agent, not later than 5:00 pm, Eastern
Time, on such date as the parties mutually determine, and in no event later
than the fifth Business Day preceding the Closing Date, which date shall be
publicly announced to the Companys shareholders (the " _Election Deadline_
") and, in the case of shares that are not held in book entry form,
accompanied by the Certificates representing all of the Company Shares as to
which such Election Form relates, duly endorsed in blank or otherwise in form
acceptable for transfer (or accompanied by an appropriate guarantee of
delivery by an eligible organization). For shares that are held in book entry
form, Parent shall establish reasonable procedures for the delivery of
such shares. Parent shall have the discretion, which it may delegate in
whole or in part to the Exchange Agent, to determine whether Election Forms
have been properly completed, signed and timely submitted or to disregard
defects in Election Forms. Any such determination of Parent or the Exchange
Agent shall be conclusive and binding. Neither Parent nor the Exchange Agent
shall be under any obligation to notify any Person of any defect in an
Election Form submitted to the Exchange Agent. If Parent or the Exchange
Agent shall determine that any purported Election was not properly made, the
Company Shares subject to such improperly made Election shall be treated as
No Election Shares. A record holder need not make the same election with
respect to all of the Company Shares held of record by such holder or
represented by a single Certificate. Any Election Form may be revoked by the
shareholder who submitted such Election Form to the Exchange Agent only by
written notice received by the Exchange Agent (i) prior to the Election
Deadline or (ii) after such time if (and only to the extent that)
the Exchange Agent is legally required to permit revocations and only if
the Effective Time shall not have occurred prior to such date. In addition,
all Election Forms shall automatically be revoked, and all Certificates
returned, if the Exchange Agent is notified in writing by Parent and Company
that this Agreement has been terminated.

(h) _No Fractional Shares_. No fractional shares of Parent Common Stock shall
be issued pursuant to this Agreement.  In lieu of fractional shares, each
shareholder who would otherwise have been entitled to a fraction of a share
of Parent Common Stock hereunder (after aggregating all fractional shares to
be received by such shareholder), shall receive, without interest, an amount
in cash (rounded to the nearest whole cent) determined by multiplying such
fraction by the per share last sale price of Parent Common Stock as reported
by the New York Stock Exchange not later than 3:00 pm, Eastern Time, on the
Closing Date.

  

(i) _Acquisition Sub Membership Interests_. Each membership interest of
Acquisition Sub issued and outstanding immediately prior to the
Effective Time shall continue to be outstanding following, and shall be
unaffected by, the Merger.

  

1.6 _Company Stock Options_.

  

(a) Each option (collectively, the " _Options_ ") granted under the Company
Stock Option Plans, whether vested or unvested, which is outstanding as of
immediately prior to the Effective Time and which has not been exercised or
canceled prior thereto shall, at the Effective Time, be canceled and upon the
surrender and cancellation of the option agreement representing such Option,
Parent shall pay to the holder thereof cash in an amount equal to the product
of (i) the number of Company Shares provided for in such Option and (ii) the
excess, if any, of the Cash Consideration over the exercise price per Company
Share provided for in such Option, which cash payment shall be treated as
compensation and shall be net of any applicable federal or state withholding
tax. The Company shall take all actions necessary to ensure that no Options
or Restricted Stock are granted after the date of this Agreement.

  

(b) Each restricted stock award (collectively, the " _Restricted Stock_ ")
granted under the Company Stock Option Plans, which is outstanding as of
immediately prior to the Effective Time and which has not been forfeited or
canceled prior thereto shall, at the Effective Time, be fully vested and free
of restrictions and shall be converted into the right to receive a portion of
the Merger Consideration as provided in Section 1.5(b).

  

(c) Immediately after the Effective Time, the Company Stock Option Plans
shall terminate and the provisions in any other plan, program or arrangement
providing for the issuance or grant of any other interest in respect of the
capital stock of the Company or any of the Company Subsidiaries shall be of
no further force and effect and shall be deemed to be deleted and no holder
of an Option or any participant in any Company Stock Option Plan or any other
plans, programs or arrangements shall have any right thereunder to acquire
any equity securities of the Company, the Surviving Entity (as hereinafter
defined) or any subsidiary thereof.

  

1.7 _Closing of Company Transfer Books_. At the Effective Time, the stock
transfer books of Company shall be closed and no further registration of
transfers of shares of Company Common Stock shall thereafter be made. On or
after the Effective Time, any Certificates presented to the Exchange Agent or
Parent for any reason shall be converted into the right to receive Merger
Consideration with respect to the shares of Company Common Stock formerly
represented thereby and any dividends or other distributions to which the
holders thereof are entitled pursuant to Section 1.12.

  



  

6    **    
 **  



  

1.8 _Exchange of Certificates_.

  

(a) Parent shall authorize one or more Persons reasonably acceptable to the
Company to act as Exchange Agent hereunder (the " _Exchange Agent_ ").
Promptly after the Effective Time, Parent shall cause the Exchange Agent to
mail, to former record holders of Company Shares who have not previously
submitted letters of transmittal together with Certificates, instructions for
surrendering their Certificates in exchange for the Merger Consideration.

  

(b) Promptly after the Effective Time, Parent shall deliver to the Exchange
Agent sufficient Parent Shares and cash to satisfy the Merger Consideration.
After the Effective Time, upon receipt of Certificates for cancellation,
together with a properly completed letter of transmittal (which shall specify
that delivery shall be effected, and risk of loss of, and title to, the
Certificates shall pass, only upon delivery of the Certificates to the
Exchange Agent) and other requested documents and in accordance with the
instructions thereon, the holder of such Certificates shall be entitled to
receive in exchange therefor (i) a certificate representing that number of
whole shares of Parent Common Stock into which the Company Shares theretofore
represented by the Certificates so surrendered shall have been converted
pursuant to Section 1.5 and (ii) a check in the amount of any cash due
pursuant to Section 1.5. No interest shall be paid or shall accrue on any
such amounts.

  

(c) Until surrendered in accordance with the provisions of this Section 1.8,
each Certificate shall represent for all purposes only the right to receive
Merger Consideration and, if applicable, amounts under Section 1.12.
Parent Shares into which Company Shares shall be converted in the Merger at
the Effective Time shall be deemed to have been issued at the Effective Time.
If any certificates representing Parent Shares are to be issued in a name
other than that in which the Certificate surrendered is registered, it shall
be a condition of such exchange that the Person requesting such exchange
deliver to the Exchange Agent all documents necessary to evidence and effect
such transfer and pay to the Exchange Agent any transfer or other taxes
required by reason of the issuance of a certificate representing Parent
Shares in a name other than that of the registered holder of the Certificate
surrendered, or establish to the satisfaction of the Exchange Agent that such
tax has been paid or is not applicable. Beginning on the date which is twelve
months following the Closing Date, Parent shall act as the Exchange Agent
and thereafter any holder of an unsurrendered Certificate shall look solely
to Parent for any amounts to which such holder may be due, subject to
applicable law. Notwithstanding any other provisions of this Agreement, any
portion of the Merger Consideration remaining unclaimed five years after the
Effective Time (or such earlier date immediately prior to such time as such
amounts would otherwise escheat to, or become property of, any Governmental
Entity) shall, to the extent permitted by law, become the property of Parent
free and clear of any claims or interest of any person previously entitled
thereto.

  

1.9 _No Liability_. None of Parent, the Surviving Entity or the Exchange
Agent shall be liable to any Person in respect of any shares (or dividends or
distributions with respect thereto) or cash payments delivered to a public
official pursuant to any applicable escheat, abandoned property or similar
Law.

  



  

7    **    
 **  



  

1.10 _Lost Certificates_. If any Certificate shall have been lost, stolen or
destroyed, upon the making of an affidavit of that fact by the
Person claiming such Certificate to be lost, stolen or destroyed and, if
reasonably required by Parent, the execution and delivery of an indemnity
agreement, in such customary form as Parent may reasonably direct, against
any claim that may be made against it with respect to such Certificate, the
Exchange Agent shall deliver in exchange for such lost, stolen or destroyed
Certificate, the Merger Consideration and any amounts due pursuant to Section
1.12.

  

1.11 _Withholding Rights_. Parent shall be entitled to deduct and withhold
from the consideration otherwise payable pursuant to this Agreement to any
holder of Company Shares such amounts as it is required to deduct
and withhold with respect to the making of such payment under the Code, or
any provision of state, local or foreign tax law.  To the extent that
amounts are so withheld by Parent, such withheld amounts shall be treated for
all purposes of this Agreement as having been paid to the holder of the
Company Shares in respect of which such deduction and withholding was made.

  

1.12 _Distributions With Respect to Unexchanged Shares_. No dividend
or other distribution declared with respect to Parent Common Stock with a
record date after the date on which the Effective Time occurs shall be paid
to holders of unsurrendered Certificates or holders who comply with the
provisions of Section 1.10 (with regard to lost certificates) until such
holders surrender such Certificates or submit an affidavit (and any
reasonably required indemnity agreement) in accordance with Section 1.10.
 Upon the surrender of such Certificates in accordance with Section 1.8 or
submission of an affidavit (and any reasonably required indemnity
agreement) in accordance with Section 1.10, there shall be paid to such
holders, promptly after such surrender or submission, as the case may be, the
amount of dividends or other distributions, without interest, declared with a
record date after the date on which the Effective Time occurs and not paid
because of the failure to surrender such Certificates for exchange.

  

1.13 _Further Assurances_.  At and after the Effective Time, the officers and
managers of the Surviving Entity shall be authorized to execute and deliver,
in the name and on behalf of the Company, any deeds, bills of sale,
assignments or assurances and to take and do, in the name and on behalf of
the Company, any other actions and things to vest the Surviving Entity with
full right, title and possession to all assets, properties, rights,
privileges, powers and franchises of both the Company and Acquisition Sub.

  

1.14 _Tax Treatment of Merger_.  Parent, Acquisition Sub and the Company
intend that the Merger will qualify as a tax-free reorganization under
Section 368(a) of the Code and shall file all tax returns and reports
consistent therewith.

Agreement dated as of April 6, 2001, as amended, between the Company and

execution of this Agreement so as to provide that (i) (A) Parent will not
become an "Acquiring Person" and (B) no "Stock Acquisition Date" or

there are no agreements or understandings to which the Company or any Company
Subsidiary is a party with respect to the voting of any shares of capital
stock or other equity interests of the Company or any Company Subsidiary or
which restrict the transfer of any such shares or other equity interests, nor

interests or which restrict the transfer of any such shares or other equity
interests.

  

(g) The Company has no outstanding bonds, debentures, notes or other

neither the Company nor any Company Subsidiary is under any obligation,
contingent or otherwise, by reason of any agreement to register the offer and
sale or resale of any of their securities under the Securities Act.

  

2.6 _Company Subsidiaries_. Section 2.6 of the Company Disclosure Schedule
correctly sets forth the name and jurisdiction of incorporation
or organization of each Company Subsidiary.  All issued and outstanding
shares or other equity interests of each Company Subsidiary are duly
authorized, validly issued, fully paid and nonassessable. Except as set forth
in Section 2.6 of the Company Disclosure Schedule, all issued and
outstanding shares or other equity interests of each Company Subsidiary are
owned directly or indirectly by the Company free and clear of any Liens.

  

2.7 _Other Interests_. Except for ownership of the shares or other equity
interests of the Company Subsidiaries or as otherwise set forth in Section
2.7 of the Company Disclosure Schedule, neither the Company nor any Company
Subsidiary owns directly or indirectly any interest or investment (whether
equity or debt) in any Person (other than investments in short-
term investment securities). Except as set forth in Section 2.7 of the
Company Disclosure Schedule, to the Companys knowledge, there is no material
dispute among the equity holders of any entity of which the Company and/or
any Company Subsidiary owns more than five percent (5%) of the voting
interests or voting securities therein.

  

2.8 _SEC Reports_. Parent has had access through publicly-available
information to (i) the Companys Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year
ended December 31, 2002, as filed with the SEC (the " _Company 10-K_ "), (ii)
its quarterly reports on Form 10-Q for the quarters ended March 31, 2003 and
June 30, 2003, as filed with the SEC (the " _Company 10-Qs_ "), (iii) all
proxy statements relating to the Companys meetings of shareholders held or
to be held after December 31, 2002 and (iv) all other documents filed by the
Company with the SEC under the Exchange Act or the Securities Act
since January 1, 2000 (the " _Company SEC Reports_ "). As of their
respective dates, such documents complied, and all documents filed by the
Company with the SEC under the Exchange Act or the Securities Act between the
date of this Agreement and the Closing Date will comply, in all material
respects, with applicable SEC requirements and did not, or in the case of
documents filed on or after the date hereof will not, contain any untrue
statement of a material fact or omit to state a material fact required to be
stated therein or necessary to make the statements therein, in light of the
circumstances under which they were made, not misleading. All Company SEC
Reports have been timely filed with the SEC and constitute all forms, reports
and documents required to be filed by the Company under the Exchange Act and
the Securities Act since January 1, 2000. Between the date of this Agreement
and the Closing Date, the Company will timely file with the SEC all documents
required to be filed by it under the Exchange Act or the Securities Act.  No
Company Subsidiary is required to file any form, report or other document
with the SEC. The certifications of the chief executive officer and chief
financial officer of the Company required by Rules 13a-14 and 15d-14 of the
Exchange Act with respect to the Company SEC Reports, as applicable, are true
and correct as of the date of this Agreement as they relate to a particular
Company SEC Report, as though made as of the date of this Agreement. The
Company has established and maintains disclosure controls and procedures, has
conducted the procedures in accordance with their terms and has otherwise

  



  

12    **    
 **  



  

operated in compliance with the requirements under Rules 13a-15 and 15d-15 of
the Exchange Act.

  

2.9 _Financial Statements_. Each of the consolidated balance sheets of the
Company included in or incorporated by reference into the Company SEC Reports
(including, in each case, any related notes) fairly presents in all material
respects the consolidated financial position of the Company and the Company
Subsidiaries as of its date and each of the consolidated statements
of operations, shareholders equity and cash flows of the Company included in
or incorporated by reference into the Company SEC Reports (including, in
each case, any related notes) fairly presents in all material respects
the consolidated financial position, results of operations or cash flows, as
the case may be, of the Company and the Company Subsidiaries for the periods
set forth therein (subject, in the case of unaudited statements, to normal
year-end audit adjustments which in the aggregate were not or will not be
material in amount or effect), in each case in accordance with GAAP
consistently applied during the periods involved, except as may be noted
therein.

  

2.10 _Absence of Undisclosed Liabilities_. Except as set forth in the Company
SEC Reports or in Section 2.10 of the Company Disclosure Schedule, as
of December 31, 2002, the Company and the Company Subsidiaries had
no material liabilities of any nature, whether accrued, absolute, contingent
or otherwise (including without limitation, liabilities as guarantor or
otherwise with respect to obligations of others or liabilities for taxes due
or then accrued or to become due), required to be reflected or disclosed in
the balance sheet dated December 31, 2002 (or the notes thereto) included in
the Company 10-K (the " _Company Balance Sheet_ ") that were not
adequately reflected or reserved against on the Company Balance Sheet. Except
as set forth in Section 2.10 of the Company Disclosure Schedule, the Company
has no material liabilities of any nature, whether accrued, absolute,
contingent or otherwise, other than liabilities (i) adequately reflected or
reserved against on the Company Balance Sheet or the Companys unaudited
balance sheet dated June 30, 2003, included in the applicable Company 10-Q,
(ii) incurred since June 30, 2003 in the ordinary course of business, or
(iii) that would not, individually or in the aggregate, reasonably be
expected to have a Company Material Adverse Effect.

  

2.11 _Absence of Adverse Changes_. Between June 30, 2003 and the date of
this Agreement, there has not been any change, event or circumstance that has
had, or would reasonably be expected to have, a Company Material Adverse
Effect.

  

2.12 _Compliance with Laws_.

for the benefit of its current or former employees or directors under which
there are continuing obligations (collectively, the " _Employee Plans_ "),
and, except as set forth in Section 2.22(a) of the Company Disclosure

received from the Internal Revenue Service a favorable determination for each
of the ERISA Pension Plans and their related trusts that each of the ERISA
Pension Plans is qualified under Section 401(a) of the Code and the related
trust is tax-exempt under Section 501(a) of the Code. There has been no event

"withdrawal liability," as defined in Section 4201 of ERISA or any other
liability on withdrawal from participation with respect to a "multiemployer
plan" as defined in Section 3(37)(A) of ERISA, and there are no impediments

participation in such a multiemployer plan. None of the Company or any
Company Subsidiary participates in any "multiple-employer
welfare arrangement" as defined in Section 3(40)(A) of ERISA or in any ERISA
Pension Plan maintained by multiple employers that are not members of the
same controlled group of businesses, except for any multiemployer plan
described above.

investment manager or administrator thereof has engaged in a nonexempt "
prohibited transaction," as such term is defined in Section 406 of ERISA and
Section 4975 of the Code. To the Companys knowledge, there are not and have
not been any excess deferrals or excess contributions under any ERISA Pension
Plan. There are not and have not been any taxable reversions of assets from

laws and regulations, whether or not the ERISA Plan documents have been
amended to reflect such requirements.

the Exchange Act.

  

3.6 _Financial Statements_. Each of the consolidated balance sheets of Parent
included in or incorporated by reference into the Parent SEC

Parent Subsidiaries as of its date and each of the consolidated statements of
income, shareholders investment and cash flows of Parent included in or
incorporated by reference into the Parent SEC Reports (including, in each
case, any related notes) fairly presents in all material respects the
consolidated financial position, results of operations or cash flows, as the
case may be, of Parent and the Parent Subsidiaries for the periods set forth
therein (subject, in the case of unaudited statements, to normal year-end
audit adjustments which in the aggregate were not or will not be material in
amount or effect), in each case in accordance with GAAP consistently applied
during the periods involved, except as may be noted therein.

  

3.7 _Absence of Undisclosed Liabilities_. Except as set forth in the Parent
SEC Reports or in Section 3.7 of the Parent Disclosure Schedule, as of March

any nature, whether accrued, absolute, contingent or otherwise (including,
without limitation, liabilities as guarantor or otherwise with respect to
obligations of others or liabilities for taxes due or then accrued or to
become due), required to be reflected or disclosed in the balance sheet dated
March 30, 2003 (or the notes thereto) included in the Parent 10-K (the "
_Parent Balance Sheet_ ") that were not adequately reflected or reserved
against on the Parent Balance Sheet. Except as set forth in Section 3.7 of
the Parent Disclosure Schedule, Parent has no material liabilities of any
nature, whether accrued, absolute, contingent or otherwise, other than
liabilities (i) adequately reflected or reserved against on the Parent
Balance Sheet or Parents unaudited balance sheet dated June 30,
2003, included in the Parent 10-Q, (ii) incurred since June 30, 2003 in the
ordinary course of business, or (iii) that would not, individually or in the
aggregate, reasonably be expected to have a Parent Material Adverse Effect.

  

3.8 _Absence of Adverse Changes_. Between June 30, 2003 and the date of
this Agreement, there has not been any change, event or circumstance that has
had, or would reasonably be expected to have, a Parent Material Adverse
Effect.

  

3.9 _Actions and Proceedings_. Except as set forth in the Parent SEC Reports
or in Section 3.9 of the Parent Disclosure Schedule, there are no actions,
suits or claims or legal, administrative or arbitration proceedings pending
or, to the knowledge of Parent, threatened against Parent or any
Parent Subsidiary that, individually or in the aggregate, would reasonably be
expected to have a Parent Material Adverse Effect.  Except as set forth in
Section 3.9 of the Parent Disclosure Schedule, there is no writ, order,
injunction, judgment or decree in effect or, to the knowledge of Parent,
threatened that is applicable to Parent or any Parent Subsidiary or by which
any of their respective properties or assets is bound and that, individually
or in the

  



  

27    **    
 **  



  

aggregate, would reasonably be expected to be material to the business of
Parent and the Parent Subsidiaries taken as a whole.

  

3.10 _Proxy Statement and Registration Statement_. None of the
information supplied by Parent or Acquisition Sub specifically for inclusion
or incorporation by reference in the Registration Statement will, at the time
the Registration Statement is filed with the SEC, at any time it is amended
or supplemented or at the time it becomes effective under the Securities
Act, contain any untrue statement of a material fact or omit to state any
material fact required to be stated therein or necessary in order to make the
statements therein, in light of the circumstances under which they are made,
not misleading. None of the information supplied by Parent specifically for
inclusion or incorporation by reference in the Proxy Statement/Prospectus

the time of the Company Shareholders Meeting (except as supplemented by
Parent to reflect changes in information so supplied at the time of such
meeting), contain any untrue statement of a material fact or omit to state
any material fact required to be stated therein or necessary in order to make
the statements therein, in light of the circumstances under which they were
made, not misleading.  The Registration Statement and the Proxy
Statement/Prospectus will comply as to form in all material respects with the
requirements of the Securities Act.

  

3.11 _Financing_. Parent has sufficient funds on hand or available to it
under bank lines of credit, bank commitments for additional credit facilities
or other sources of funds to satisfy all of Parents and Acquisition Subs
obligations under this Agreement, including, without limitation, the
obligation to pay (a) the cash portion of the Merger Consideration and (b)
all outstanding indebtedness of the Company and the Company Subsidiaries
which is required by its terms to be paid as a result of the Merger and which
is set forth as items (i) through (v) of Section 2.3 of the Company
Disclosure Schedule.  Parent has provided the Company with true, complete and
correct copies of all bank commitment letters referred to in the first
sentence of this Section 3.11, and, to the knowledge of Parent, assuming the
conditions to the obligations of Parent and Acquisition Sub under Sections
5.1 and 5.2 are satisfied at or prior to the Effective Time, there is no
reason to believe any condition to such financing commitments cannot or will
not be waived or satisfied prior to the Closing Date.

  

3.12 _Company Shares and Acquisition Sub Interests_.

  

(a) Except as set forth in Section 3.12 of the Parent Disclosure Schedule,

of Acquisition Sub has been, the sole member of Acquisition Sub. No election
has been made or will be made prior to the Effective Time to treat
Acquisition Sub as an association taxable as a corporation for federal income
tax purposes, and

  



  

28    **

disregarded as an entity separate from Parent for federal income tax
purposes.

had if such individual had reviewed (i) the documents received by such

efforts to timely file and obtain all authorizations, consents and Permits of
others, necessary or desirable to permit the consummation of the Merger on
the terms contemplated by this Agreement. For purposes of this
Section 4.5(a), the obligations of the Company, Parent and Acquisition Sub to
use their "commercially reasonable best efforts" to obtain waivers, consents
and approvals to loan agreements, leases and other contracts shall not
include any obligation to agree to an adverse modification of the terms of
such documents or to prepay or incur additional obligations to such other
parties.

  

(b) As soon as practicable following the date of this Agreement, the Company
and Parent each shall properly prepare and file with the United States
Federal Trade Commission (the " _FTC_ ") and the Antitrust Division of the
United States Department of Justice (" _DOJ_ ") any Notification and Report
Forms relating to the Merger required by the HSR Act, as well as comparable
pre-merger notification forms required by the merger notification and control
laws and regulations of any other applicable jurisdiction, as agreed to by
the parties (collectively, the " _HSR Filings_ "). The Company and Parent each
shall promptly (i) supply the other with any information which may be
reasonably required in order to make such filings and (ii) supply any
additional information which may be requested by the FTC, the DOJ or the
competition or merger control authorities of any other jurisdiction and which
the parties reasonably deem appropriate. Each of Parent and the Company
shall promptly notify the other of the receipt of any comments on, or any
request for amendments or supplements to, any HSR Filing, and each of Parent
and the Company shall supply the other with copies of all
correspondence between it and each of its subsidiaries and representatives,
on the one hand, and the FTC, the DOJ or other Governmental Entity or members
of their respective staff or other appropriate officials, on the

  



  

33      
   



  

other hand, with respect to HSR Filings. Each of Parent and the Company
agrees to use its commercially reasonable best efforts to secure termination
of any waiting periods under the HSR Act or other applicable law and to
obtain the approval of the FTC, DOJ or any other Governmental Entity for the
Merger and the other transactions contemplated hereby, including
without limitation, promptly entering into good faith negotiations with the
FTC or any other Governmental Entity to enter into a consent decree or other
arrangement as may be necessary to secure termination of such waiting periods
or to obtain such approval. Nothing in this Section 4.5 shall prevent, or be
construed to prevent, Parent or Acquisition Sub from agreeing to extend the
waiting period under the HSR Act in connection with good faith settlement
negotiations with any Governmental Entity. Notwithstanding anything to the
contrary in this Agreement, Parent, Acquisition Sub and the Company shall use
their commercially reasonable best efforts to have any non-final injunction
or other action restraining, enjoining or otherwise prohibiting the
consummation of the Merger stayed or reversed.

  

4.6 _Preparation of Disclosure Documents_.

  

(a) As soon as practicable following the date of this Agreement, the Company
and Parent shall prepare the Proxy Statement/Prospectus and Parent shall, in
cooperation with the Company, prepare and file with the SEC the Registration
Statement, in which the Proxy Statement/Prospectus will be included.  Each
of the Company and Parent shall use commercially reasonable best efforts to
have the Registration Statement declared effective under the Securities Act
as promptly as practicable after such filing and to keep the Registration
Statement effective as long as is necessary to consummate the Merger. The
Company shall mail the Proxy Statement/Prospectus to its shareholders as
promptly as practicable after the Registration Statement is declared
effective under the Securities Act and, if necessary, after the
Proxy Statement/Prospectus shall have been so mailed, promptly circulate
supplemental or amended proxy material, and, if required in connection
therewith, resolicit proxies.

  

(b) (i) The Company shall, as soon as practicable following the date the
Registration Statement is declared effective, duly call, give notice of,
convene and hold a meeting of its shareholders (the " _Company Shareholders
Meeting_ ") for the purpose of obtaining the required shareholder votes with
respect to this Agreement, (ii) the Company Board, subject to Section
4.10(b), shall give its unqualified recommendation that its shareholders
adopt this Agreement and (iii) Company shall take all lawful action to
solicit such adoption. No withdrawal, modification, change or
qualification in the recommendation of the Company Board (or any committee of
the Company Board) shall change the approval of the Company Board for
purposes of causing any state takeover statute or other state law to be
inapplicable to the transactions contemplated hereby, or change the
obligation of the Company to present this Agreement for adoption at the
Company Shareholders Meeting.

  

(c) Except as required by applicable Law, no amendment or supplement to the
Proxy Statement/Prospectus or the Registration Statement shall be made by
Parent or the Company without the approval of the other party (which shall
not be unreasonably withheld or delayed). Each party shall advise the other
party, promptly after it receives notice thereof, of the time when
the Registration Statement has become effective or any supplement or
amendment has been filed, of the issuance of any stop order by the SEC, or of
any request by the SEC for

  



  

34    **    
 **  



  

amendment of the Proxy Statement/Prospectus or the Registration Statement or
comments thereon and responses thereto or requests by the SEC for additional
information.

  

4.7 _Further Assurances_. Each of the parties shall execute such documents,
further instruments of transfer and assignment and other papers and take such
further actions as may be reasonably required or desirable to carry out the
provisions hereof and the transactions contemplated hereby. Each party shall
use its respective commercially reasonable best efforts to take other such
actions to ensure that, to the extent within its control or capable of
influence by it, the transactions contemplated by this Agreement shall be
fully carried out in a timely fashion, including preparing and filing any
documents required to be prepared and filed under the Exchange Act.

  

4.8 _Public Announcements_. The Company shall consult with Parent, and Parent
shall consult with the Company, and each will obtain the approval of
the other (which will not be unreasonably withheld or delayed), before
issuing any press release or otherwise making any public statement with
respect to the Merger or this Agreement and shall not issue any such press
release or make any such public statement prior to such consultation and
approval, except as may be required by applicable Law or the applicable rules
of any stock exchange if the party issuing such press release or making such
public statement has used its commercially reasonable best efforts to consult
with the other party and to obtain such partys consent but has been unable
to do so in a timely manner. Notwithstanding the foregoing, without the
other partys prior approval, each party and its authorized representatives
may communicate with shareholders of such party, financial analysts and media
representatives in such manner as such party believes reasonably necessary or
desirable in connection with completing the Merger. In addition, without prior
consultation or approval, each party may disseminate material included in a
press release or other document previously approved for external distribution
by the other party. Each party agrees to promptly make available to the
other party copies of any written communications made without prior
consultation.

  

4.9 _Affiliate Letters_.

  

(a) Prior to the Closing Date, the Company shall identify to Parent all
Persons who, at the time of the Company Shareholders Meeting, the Company
believes may be "affiliates" of the Company within the meaning of Rule 145
under the Securities Act (each an " _Affiliate_ "). The Company shall use its
commercially reasonable best efforts to provide Parent with such information
as Parent shall reasonably request for purposes of making its own
determination of Persons who may be deemed to be Affiliates of the Company.
 The Company shall use its commercially reasonable best efforts to deliver
to Parent prior to the Closing Date a letter from each of such Affiliates
identified by the Company and Parent in substantially the form attached
hereto as Exhibit B (the " _Affiliate Letters_ ").

  

(b) Parent shall file the reports required to be filed by it under Rule
144(c) under the Securities Act to enable any Affiliate to sell Parent Shares
received by such Affiliate in the Merger without registration pursuant to
Rule 145(d) under the Securities Act or any successor rule or regulation
hereafter adopted by the SEC.

4.10 _No Solicitation_.

  

(a) The Company will immediately cease any discussions or negotiations with
any parties that may be ongoing with respect to an Acquisition Proposal.
 Except as explicitly permitted hereunder, the Company shall not, and shall
not authorize or permit any of the Company Subsidiaries or any of its
or their respective officers, directors or employees or any investment
banker, financial advisor, attorney, accountant or other representative,
directly or indirectly, to, (i) solicit, initiate or encourage (including by
way of furnishing non-public information), or take any other action to
facilitate, any inquiries or the making of any proposal that constitutes an
Acquisition Proposal, or (ii) participate in any discussions or negotiations
regarding an Acquisition Proposal; _provided, however,_  that if the Company
Board determines, in good faith, after receiving advice from outside counsel,
that failing to take such action would be inconsistent with its fiduciary
duties to the Companys shareholders under applicable law, the Company, in
response to an unsolicited bona fide written Acquisition Proposal that would
reasonably be expected to result in a Superior Proposal, prior to the date on
which the shareholders of the Company adopt this Agreement and only if the
Company is not in breach of its obligations under this Section 4.10, may (A)
furnish non-public information with respect to the Company to the Person who
made such Acquisition Proposal pursuant to a confidentiality agreement on
terms no more favorable to such Person than the Confidentiality Agreement;
_provided_ that such confidentiality agreement need not include the same
standstill provisions as those contained in the Confidentiality Agreement, it
being understood that if there are no standstill provisions in such
confidentiality agreement or if such provisions are more favorable to the
person who made such Acquisition Proposal than those in the Confidentiality
Agreement, the Confidentiality Agreement shall be deemed amended to exclude
the existing standstill provision or include such more favorable provisions,
as the case may be, and (B) may participate in discussions or negotiations
regarding such Acquisition Proposal.

  

(b) The Company Board shall not (i) withdraw or modify in a manner adverse to
Parent or Acquisition Sub its approval or recommendation of this Agreement or
the Merger, (ii) approve or recommend an Acquisition Proposal to its
shareholders or (iii) cause the Company to enter into any definitive
acquisition agreement with respect to an Acquisition Proposal, unless the
Company Board (A) shall have determined in good faith, after consultation
with counsel, that the Acquisition Proposal is a Superior Proposal and
failing to take such action would be inconsistent with its fiduciary duties
to the Companys shareholders under applicable law and (B) in the case of
clause (iii) above, complies with Section 6.1(c)(i) hereof. In the event that
before the Effective Time the Company Board determines in good faith, after
receiving advice from outside counsel, that failing to take such action would
be inconsistent with its fiduciary duties to the Companys shareholders under
applicable law, the Company may enter into an agreement with respect to a
Superior Proposal, but only 48 hours after Parents receipt of written notice
(x) advising Parent that the Company Board has received a Superior Proposal
and that the Company has elected to terminate this Agreement pursuant
to Section 6.1(c)(i) of this Agreement and (y) setting forth such other
information required to be included therein as provided in Section 6.1(c)(i)
of this Agreement.  If the Company enters into an agreement with respect to a
Superior Proposal, it shall have paid to Parent the Fee in accordance
with Section 6.2 of this Agreement.

  



  

36    **    
 **  



  

(c) Nothing contained in this Section 4.10 shall prohibit the Company from at
any time taking and disclosing to its shareholders a position contemplated by
Rule 14d-9 or Rule 14e-2 promulgated under the Exchange Act or making any
disclosure required by Rule 14a-9 promulgated under the Exchange Act.

  

(d) The Company shall notify Parent promptly (and, in any case, within 24
hours) of any inquiries, proposals or offers received by, any information
requested from, or any discussions or negotiations sought to be initiated or
continued with, it, any Company Subsidiary or any of their directors,
officers, employees, agents or other representatives concerning an
Acquisition Proposal, indicating, in connection with such notice, the
material terms and conditions of any proposals or offers and, in the case of
written materials, providing copies of such materials unless such written
materials constitute confidential information of such other party under an
effective confidentiality agreement. The Company agrees that it will keep
Parent informed, on a reasonably prompt basis (and, in any case, within 36
hours of any significant development), of the status and terms of any such
proposals or offers and the status of any such discussions or negotiations.

  

4.11 _Notification of Certain Matters_. Between the date hereof and the
Closing Date, the Company shall give prompt notice to Parent, and Parent and
Acquisition Sub shall give prompt notice to the Company, of (a) the
occurrence or non-occurrence of any event or circumstance the occurrence or
non-occurrence of which would be likely to cause any representation or
warranty contained in this Agreement to be untrue or inaccurate in any
material respect if made at such time and (b) any failure of the Company,
Parent and Acquisition Sub, as the case may be, to comply with or satisfy in
any material respect any covenant, condition or agreement to be complied with
or satisfied by it hereunder.

  

4.12 _Employee Matters_.

  

(a) On and after the Closing, Parent shall, and shall cause the Surviving
Entity to, honor in accordance with their terms all severance obligations of
the Company or any Company Subsidiary listed in Section 2.23(a) of the
Company Disclosure Schedule, except as may otherwise be agreed to by the
parties thereto, and the Company or Parent shall pay on the Closing Date to
the applicable officers and employees listed in said Section of the Company
Disclosure Schedule, any amounts with respect to such severance obligations
that are payable by their terms upon consummation of the Merger, at the
Effective Time or on the Closing Date (collectively, the "
_Severance Amounts_ ") unless prior to the Closing any of the Severance
Amounts are funded into the SPS Benefits Protection Trust (the " _Trust_ "),
in which case such funded Severance Amounts shall be payable to such
applicable officers and employees directly from the Trust.  For the period
through September 30, 2004, employees of the Surviving Entity and the Company
Subsidiaries who remain employed after the Effective Time (the " _Company
Employees_ ") will continue to participate in the employee benefit plans
(other than deferred compensation plans, supplemental retirement plans,
management incentive plans (except as set forth in clause (b) below for the
plans in effect on the Closing Date), long range incentive plans (except as
set forth in clause (b) below for the plans in effect on the Closing Date),
performance incentive plans, severance plans (excluding severance obligations
that Parent has agreed to honor in accordance with the immediately preceding
sentence), and stock option plans or other employer stock match or other
employer stock related provisions) on substantially similar terms

  



  

37    **    
 **  



  

to those currently in effect. Thereafter, Parent shall, and shall cause the
Surviving Entity to, provide the Company Employees with the types and levels
of employee benefits no less favorable in the aggregate than those maintained
from time to time by Parent or the Surviving Entity for similarly-situated
employees of Parent or the Surviving Entity. Parent shall, and shall cause the
Surviving Entity to, treat, and cause the applicable benefit plans to treat,
the service of Company Employees with the Company or the Company Subsidiaries
attributable to any period before the Effective Time as service rendered to
Parent of the Surviving Entity for purposes of eligibility to participate,
vesting and for other appropriate benefits including, but not limited to,
applicability of minimum waiting periods for participation.  Without
limiting the foregoing, Parent shall not, and shall cause the Surviving
Entity to not, treat any Company Employee as a "new" employee for purposes of
any exclusions under any health or similar plan of Parent or the Surviving
Entity for a pre-existing medical condition, and any deductibles and co-pays
paid under any of the Companys or any of the Company Subsidiaries health
plans shall be credited towards deductibles and co-pays under the
health plans of Parent or the Surviving Entity, if applicable. Parent shall,
and shall cause the Surviving Entity to, make appropriate arrangements with
its insurance carrier(s) to ensure such results. Notwithstanding the
foregoing, Parent and the Company acknowledge that group health, prescription
drug and dental benefit plans are subject to renewal effective January 1,
2004; that the Company will begin renewal negotiations and consideration of
plan design changes prior to, but will not complete the renewal process by,
the Effective Time; _provided_  that the Effective Time has not occurred by
January 1, 2004; and that market factors in recent years have created
substantial volatility in group health, prescription drug and dental plan
renewals.  Therefore, Parent shall have the right to make plan design changes
in any or all of the foregoing plans to the extent reasonably necessary to
keep premium increases for individual plans below ten percent (10%) for the
2004 plan year.

  

(b) After the Closing, Parent shall cause the Surviving Entity to honor all
obligations which existed prior to the Effective Time under the Companys
deferred compensation plans and supplemental retirement plans and, to the
extent earned in accordance with the terms of the plan and accrued prior to
the Effective Time, giving effect to pro-ration for partial years of service,
all obligations which existed under the Companys long range incentive plans
and management incentive plans, including, without limitation, the SPS
Technologies, Inc. Management Incentive Plan and SPS Technologies, Inc. Long
Range Incentive Plan.  Except as is otherwise required by the existing terms
of the written employment and severance agreements to which the Company is
presently a party and listed in Section 2.23(a) of the Company Disclosure
Schedule, future accruals may be (but are not required to be) provided for
under any such plan(s) or under any similar plan(s) of the Surviving Entity
or Parent.

  

(c) Notwithstanding any provision to the contrary in this Section 4.12, the
Company shall take all actions necessary to ensure that the Companys
retirement arrangements in respect of current non-employee directors
(involving payments of lifetime annual retainers to such directors and
granting to such directors the right to elect to receive all or a portion of
such annual retainers in discounted price options or otherwise) shall
terminate as of the Effective Time and thereafter be of no further force or
effect, and shall provide to Parent prior to the Effective Time
evidence reasonably satisfactory to Parent of the agreement of such directors
to such termination.

  



  

38    **    
 **  



  

4.13 _Indemnification_.

  

(a) Subject to the occurrence of the Effective Time, until the six year
anniversary of the date on which the Effective Time occurs, Parent and the
Surviving Entity agree that all rights to indemnification or exculpation now
existing in favor of each present and former employee, agent, fiduciary,
director or officer of the Company and the Company Subsidiaries (the "
_Indemnified Parties_ ") as provided in the respective charters or by-laws or
otherwise in effect as of the date hereof shall survive and remain in full
force and effect.  From and after the Effective Time, Parent and the
Surviving Entity also agree to indemnify and hold harmless the present and
former officers and directors of the Company and the Company Subsidiaries in
respect of acts or omissions occurring prior to the Effective Time to the
extent provided in any written indemnification agreements between the Company
and/or one or more Company Subsidiaries and such officers and directors and
listed in Section 4.13 of the Company Disclosure Schedule.

  

(b) In the event of any threatened or actual claim, action, suit, demand,
proceeding or investigation, whether civil, criminal or administrative,
including, without limitation, any such claim, action, suit, demand,
proceeding or investigation in which any person who is now, or has been at
any time prior to the date hereof, or who becomes prior to the Effective
Time, an Indemnified Party is, or is threatened to be, made a party based in
whole or in part on, or arising in whole or in part out of, or pertaining to
(i) the fact that he or she is or was a director, officer, employee,
fiduciary or agent of the Company or any of the Company Subsidiaries, or is
or was serving at the request of the Company or any of the
Company Subsidiaries as a director, officer, employee, trustee, partner,
fiduciary or agent of another corporation, partnership, joint venture, trust,
pension or other employee benefit plan or other enterprise, or (ii) the
negotiation, execution or performance of this Agreement or any of the
transactions contemplated hereby, whether in any case asserted or arising
before or after the Effective Time, the parties hereto agree to cooperate and
use their commercially reasonable best efforts to defend against and respond
thereto. It is understood and agreed that the Company shall indemnify and
hold harmless, and after the Effective Time the Surviving Entity and Parent
shall indemnify and hold harmless, as and to the full extent permitted by
applicable law, each Indemnified Party against any losses, claims, damages,
liabilities, costs, expenses (including reasonable attorneys fees
and expenses), judgments, fines and amounts paid in settlement in connection
with any such threatened or actual claim, action, suit, demand, proceeding
or investigation, and in the event of any such threatened or actual claim,
action, suit, demand, proceeding or investigation (whether asserted or
arising before or after the Effective Time), (A) the Company, and the
Surviving Entity and Parent after the Effective Time, shall promptly pay
reasonable expenses in advance of the final disposition of any claim, suit,
proceeding or investigation to each Indemnified Party to the full extent
permitted by law, (B) the Indemnified Parties may retain one counsel (plus
one local counsel) reasonably satisfactory to them and Parent, and the
Company and the Surviving Entity shall pay all fees and expenses of such
counsel for the Indemnified Parties within 30 days after statements therefor
are received, and (C) the Company, Parent, the Surviving Entity and the
Indemnified Parties shall use their respective commercially reasonable best
efforts to assist in the vigorous defense of any such matter; _provided_
 that none of the Company, the Surviving Entity or Parent shall be liable
for any settlement effected without its prior written consent (which consent
shall not be unreasonably withheld); and _provided further_ that the
Surviving Entity and Parent shall have no obligation

  



  

39    **    
 **  



  

hereunder to any Indemnified Party when and if a court of competent
jurisdiction shall ultimately determine, and such determination shall become
final and non-appealable, that indemnification of such Indemnified Party in
the manner contemplated hereby is prohibited under applicable law (whereupon
any advances received shall be repaid to Parent or the Surviving Entity). Any
Indemnified Party wishing to claim indemnification under this Section
4.13(b), upon learning of any such claim, action, suit, demand, proceeding or
investigation, shall promptly notify the Company and, after the Effective
Time, the Surviving Entity and Parent; _provided_ that the failure to so
notify shall not affect the obligations of the Company, the Surviving Entity
and Parent except to the extent such failure to notify materially prejudices
such party.

  

(c) Prior to the Effective Time, the Company shall purchase an extended
reporting period endorsement under the Companys existing directors and
officers liability insurance coverage for the Companys directors and
officers in a form acceptable to the Company which shall provide such
directors and officers with coverage for six years following the Effective
Time of not less than the existing coverage under, and have other terms not
materially less favorable on the whole to, the insured persons than the
directors and officers liability insurance coverage presently maintained by
the Company, so long as the aggregate cost is less than $2,000,000; _provided_
that the Company agrees to cooperate in good faith with Parent in order to
obtain the lowest premium for such coverage. In the event that $2,000,000 is
insufficient for such coverage, the Company may spend up to that amount to
purchase such lesser coverage as may be obtained with such amount. Parent
shall, and shall cause the Surviving Entity to, maintain such policies in
full force and effect, and continue to honor the obligations thereunder.

  

(d) In the event Parent or any of its successors or assigns (i) consolidates
with or merges into any other Person and shall not be the continuing or
surviving corporation or entity of such consolidation or merger, or (ii)
transfers or conveys all or substantially all of its properties and assets to
any Person, then, and in each such case, to the extent necessary, proper
provision shall be made so that the successors and assigns of Parent assume
the obligations set forth in this Section 4.13.

  

(e) The provisions of this Section 4.13 are intended to be for the benefit
of, and shall be enforceable by, each Indemnified Party and his or her heirs
and representatives.

  

4.14 _Consultation in respect of Certain Actions and Proceedings_. Until
this Agreement is terminated in accordance with Section 6.1, the Company
shall consult in good faith with Parent in connection with the defense of any
action, suit or proceeding instituted against the Company (or any of its
directors or officers) before any Governmental Entity or threatened by any
Governmental Entity, to restrain, modify or prevent the consummation of the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement, or to seek damages or a
discovery order in connection with such transactions.

  

4.15 _Reorganization Covenants_. Except as otherwise required by Law or
by this Agreement, neither the Company, on the one hand, nor Parent or
Acquisition Sub, on the other hand, shall take or cause to be taken any
action that would prevent the Merger from qualifying as a reorganization
within the meaning of Section 368(a) of the Code.

consents set forth on Schedule 5.1(d) attached hereto, shall have been
obtained and remain in full force and effect, and all waiting periods
relating to such approvals, authorizations and consents shall have expired or
been terminated; _provided, however_ , that the conditions of this Section

under this Agreement shall have been the cause of, or shall have resulted in,
such failure to obtain such approval, authorization or consent.

  

(e) _No Injunctions; Orders or Restraints; Illegality_. No temporary
restraining order, preliminary or permanent injunction or other order, decree
or ruling issued by a court or other Governmental Entity of competent

41    **    
 **  



  

(a) _Representations, Warranties and Covenants_. The representations
and warranties made by the Company in this Agreement shall have been accurate
as of the date of this Agreement and, other than representations and
warranties made as of a particular date, (i) those representations and
warranties that are qualified as to a Company Material Adverse Effect or
words of similar effect shall be true and correct in all respects as of the
Closing Date as if made on and as of the Closing Date, and (ii) those
representations and warranties that are not so qualified shall be true and
correct in all material respects as of the Closing Date as if made on and as
of the Closing Date. The Company shall have performed and complied in all
material respects with all covenants and agreements required by
this Agreement to be performed or complied with by it on or prior to the
Effective Time. The Company shall have delivered to Parent a certificate
from its chief executive officer or chief financial officer, dated the

(b) _Corporate Certificates_. The Company shall have delivered a copy of the

that if the Aggregate Stock Consideration equals at least 40% of the fair
market value of the Merger Consideration determined based upon the per share
last sale price of Parent Common Stock as reported by the New York Stock
Exchange not later than 3:00 pm, Eastern Time, on the Closing Date and the
sole reason that Parent would not receive the opinion described in the
preceding sentence is the continuity of shareholder interest requirement
described in Treasury Regulations Section 1.368-1(e) (the " _COSI
Requirement_ ") has not been satisfied, then the COSI Requirement shall be
deemed satisfied and such opinion shall so assume. In rendering such
opinion, counsel shall be entitled to rely on customary representation
letters of Parent, Company and Acquisition Sub and others, in form and
substance reasonably satisfactory to such counsel.

through the Closing, no event shall have occurred that has had or would
reasonably be expected to have, individually or in the aggregate, a Company
Material Adverse Effect; _provided, however_ , that any event that (i)
results from the announcement or pendency of the Merger, including
disruptions to the Companys business or the Company
Subsidiaries businesses, and their respective employees, customers and

8.3 _Entire Agreement_. This Agreement, together with the exhibits and
schedules hereto, contains the entire agreement between the parties
with respect to the Merger and related transactions, and supersede all
prior agreements, written or oral, between the parties with respect thereto,
other than the Confidentiality Agreement (excluding the provisions of the
agreement dated July 21, 2003 between Parent and the Company), which shall
survive execution of this Agreement and any termination of this Agreement.

  

8.4 _Governing Law_. This Agreement shall be governed by and construed in
accordance with the laws of the State of Delaware without regard to its
conflicts of law provisions, except to the extent that the laws of
the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania apply to the Merger and the rights of
Company shareholders relative to the Merger.

  

8.5 _Binding Effect; No Assignment; No Third-Party Beneficiaries_.

  

(a) This Agreement shall be binding upon and inure to the benefit of the
parties and their respective successors and permitted assigns. This Agreement
is not assignable without the prior written consent of the other parties
hereto.

  

(b) Other than Sections 4.9(b), 4.12 and 4.13, nothing in this Agreement,
express or implied, is intended to or shall confer upon any person other than
Parent, Acquisition Sub and the Company and their respective successors and
permitted assigns any right, benefit or remedy of any nature whatsoever under
or by reason of this Agreement. Sections 4.9(b), 4.12 and 4.13 are
intended to be for the benefit of those persons described therein and the
covenants contained therein may be enforced by such persons.

  

8.6 _Section Headings; Construction_. The headings of Sections in this
Agreement are provided for convenience only and will not affect its
construction or interpretation. All references to "Section" or "Sections"
refer to the corresponding Section or Sections of this Agreement. All words
used in this Agreement will be construed to be of such gender or number as
the circumstances require. Unless otherwise expressly provided, the word
"including" does not limit the preceding words or terms.

  

8.7 _Counterparts_. This Agreement may be executed in two counterparts, each
of which shall be deemed an original, and both of which together
shall constitute one and the same instrument.

  



  

53    **    
 **  



  

8.8 _Severability_. If any provision of this Agreement, or the application
thereof to any person or circumstance is held invalid or unenforceable, the
remainder of this Agreement, and the application of such provision to other
persons or circumstances, shall not be affected thereby, and to such end, the
provisions of this Agreement are agreed to be severable. The parties further
agree to replace such invalid or unenforceable provision of this Agreement
with a valid and enforceable mutually acceptable provision that will achieve,
to the extent possible, the economic, business and other purposes of such
invalid or unenforceable provision.

  

8.9 _Submission to Jurisdiction_. Each of the Company, Parent and
Acquisition Sub hereby irrevocably and unconditionally consents to submit to
the sole and exclusive jurisdiction of the courts of the State of Delaware
and of the United States District Court for the District of Delaware (the "
_Delaware Courts_ ") for any litigation arising out of or relating to this
Agreement, or the negotiation, validity or performance of this Agreement, or
the Merger (and agrees not to commence any litigation relating thereto except
in such courts), waives any objection to the laying of venue of any such
litigation in the Delaware Courts and agrees not to plead or claim in any
Delaware Court that such litigation brought therein has been brought in any
inconvenient forum. Each of the parties hereto agrees, (a) to the extent
such party is not otherwise subject to service of process in the State of
Delaware, to appoint and maintain an agent in the State of Delaware as such
partys agent for acceptance of legal process, and (b) that service of
process may also be made on such party by prepaid certified mail with a proof
of mailing receipt validated by the United States Postal Service constituting
evidence of valid service. Service made pursuant to (a) or (b) above shall
have the same legal force and effect as if served upon such party personally
within the State of Delaware.  For purposes of implementing the parties
agreement to appoint and maintain an agent for service of process in the
State of Delaware, each such party does hereby appoint CT Corporation,
Corporation Trust Center, 1209 Orange Street, Wilmington, DE 19801, as such
agent.

  

8.10 _Enforcement_. The parties recognize and agree that if for any reason
any of the provisions of this Agreement are not performed in accordance with
their specific terms or are otherwise breached, immediate and irreparable
harm or injury would be caused for which money damages would not be an
adequate remedy. Accordingly, each party agrees that in addition to other
remedies the other party shall be entitled to an injunction restraining any
violation or threatened violation of the provisions of this Agreement.
In the event that any action shall be brought in equity to enforce the
provisions of the Agreement, neither party will allege, and each party hereby
waives the defense, that there is an adequate remedy at law.

  

8.11 _Waiver of Jury Trial_. EACH OF PARENT, ACQUISITION SUB AND THE COMPANY
HEREBY IRREVOCABLY WAIVES THE RIGHT TO A TRIAL BY JURY IN ANY
ACTION, PROCEEDING OR COUNTERCLAIM (WHETHER BASED IN CONTRACT, TORT OR
OTHERWISE) ARISING OUT OF, UNDER OR IN CONNECTION WITH THIS AGREEMENT OR ANY
OTHER RELATED DOCUMENT, OR ANY COURSE OF CONDUCT, COURSE OF DEALINGS,
STATEMENT OR ACTION RELATED HERETO OR THERETO.

  



  

54    **    
 **  



  

8.12 _Rules of Construction_. The parties hereto agree that they have
been represented by counsel during the negotiation and execution of this
Agreement and, therefore, waive the application of any law, regulation,
holding or ruling of construction providing that ambiguities in an agreement
or other document will be construed against the party drafting such agreement
or document.

 _EXHIBIT A-1_

  



  



  

 **FORM OF VOTING AGREEMENT**

  



  

THIS VOTING AGREEMENT (this " _Agreement_ "), dated as of August ___, 2003,
is made by and between the undersigned , a shareholder (the " _Shareholder_
") of SPS Technologies, Inc., a Pennsylvania corporation (the " _Company_
") and Precision Castparts Corp., an Oregon corporation (" _Parent_ ").
Capitalized terms used in this Agreement but not otherwise defined have the
same meanings ascribed to such terms in the Merger Agreement (as defined
below).

  



  

 **RECITALS**

  



  

WHEREAS, contemporaneously with the execution and delivery of this Agreement,
Star Acquisition LLC, a wholly owned Pennsylvania subsidiary of Parent ("
_Acquisition Sub_ "), and the Company are entering into an Agreement and Plan
of Merger, dated as of the date hereof (the " _Merger Agreement_ "), pursuant
to which the Company will merge with and into Acquisition Sub (the " _Merger_
"), upon the terms and conditions set forth therein; and

  



  

WHEREAS the Shareholder desires that the Merger occur and that the
Shareholder receive, at the Shareholders election in accordance with the
Merger Agreement, the Shareholders portion of the Merger Consideration;

  



  

NOW, THEREFORE, for good and valuable considera­tion, the receipt,
sufficiency and adequacy of which are hereby acknowledged, and intending to
be legally bound, the parties hereto agree as follows:

  



  

1. _Representations of Shareholder_.

  



  

1.1 The Shareholder represents and warrants that, as of the date of this
Agreement, the Shareholder is the beneficial holder of the number of shares
of the capital stock of the Company set forth on the signature page to this
Agreement (" _Shares_ ") free and clear of all Liens (other than Liens under
applicable Law) which would adversely affect the ability of the Shareholder
to comply with the terms of this Agreement.

  



  

1.2 The Shareholder represents and warrants that the Shareholder does not own
beneficially (as such term is defined in the Exchange Act) or of record (a)
any shares of the capital stock of the Company, other than the Shares or (b)
any rights to acquire any shares of the capital stock of the Company, other
than options held by the Shareholder or its affiliates and the Shares
issuable on exercise of such outstanding options.

  



  

1.3 The Shareholder represents and warrants that the Shareholder has full
power and authority to make, enter into and carry out the terms of this
Agreement. This Agreement has been duly executed and delivered by the
Shareholder and assuming the due authorization, execution and delivery by
Parent, constitutes a legal, valid and binding obligation of the Shareholder,
enforceable against the Shareholder in accordance with its terms, subject to

  



  

57    **    
 **  



  

laws of general application relating to bankruptcy, insolvency and the relief
of debtors and rules of law governing specific performance, injunctive relief
and other equitable remedies.

  



  

1.4 The Shareholder represents and warrants that the execution and delivery
of this Agreement by the Shareholder do not, and the performance of this
Agreement by the Shareholder will not:  (a) conflict with or violate any
order applicable to the Shareholder or by which the Shareholder or any of the
Shareholders properties or Shares is bound or affected; (b) result in any
material breach of or constitute a default (with notice or lapse of time, or
both) under, or give to others any rights of termination, amendment,
acceleration or cancellation of, or result in the creation of any Lien
applicable to any of the Shares pursuant to any written, oral or other
agreement, contract or legally binding commitment to which the Shareholder is
a party or by which the Shareholder or any of the Shareholders properties
(including but not limited to the Shares) is bound or affected; or (c)
require any written, oral or other agreement, contract or legally
binding commitment of any third party except, in each case, a violation,
conflict, breach, default or commitment which would not be reasonably likely
to have a material adverse effect on such Shareholders ability to consummate
the transactions contemplated by this Agreement.

  



  

1.5 The Shareholder represents and warrants that the representations and
warranties contained in this Agreement are accurate in all respects as of the
date of this Agreement, will be accurate in all respects at all times through
Termination Time (as defined in Section 11.4 hereof) and will be accurate in
all respects as of the date of the consummation of the Merger as if made on
that date.

  



  

2. _Agreement to Vote Shares; Proxy; Waiver_.

  



  

2.1 _Voting_. The Shareholder agrees that, prior to the Termination Time, at
any meeting of the shareholders of the Company, however called, and in any
action taken by written consent of shareholders of the Company without a
meeting, the Shareholder shall vote the Shareholders Shares and any shares
of the capital stock of the Company acquired after the date of this Agreement
and prior to the applicable record date ("New Shares"), and shall cause any
holder of record of the Shareholders Shares or New Shares to vote (a) to
approve the Merger and to approve and adopt the Merger Agreement, (b) to
approve any action required in furtherance of the Merger, and (c) against any
action or agreement that would result in a breach of any representation,
warranty, covenant or obligation of the Company in the Merger Agreement or
that would preclude fulfillment of a condition under the Merger Agreement to
the Companys, Parents or Acquisition Subs respective obligations to
consummate the Merger.

  



  

2.2 _Proxy_.  [Intentionally deleted]

  



  

2.3 _Waiver_.

  



  

(a) The Shareholder hereby agrees not to exercise any rights of appraisal and
any dissenters rights that the Shareholder may have (whether under
applicable law or otherwise) with respect to the Shares and any shares
of Parent Common Stock receivable upon conversion of any Shares in connection
with the Merger.

  



  

58    **    
 **  



  



  

(b) The Shareholder hereby waives any rights of first refusal, preemptive
rights, rights of redemption or repurchase, rights to notice and similar
rights of the Shareholder under any agreement, arrangement or understanding
applicable to the Shares or New Shares (other than any Shareholder rights
plan or other rights offered pro rata to all Shareholders of the Company), in
each case as the same may apply to the execution and delivery of the Merger
Agreement and the consummation of the Merger and the other transactions and
acts contemplated by the Merger Agreement. Effective immediately prior to the
Effective Time, the Shareholder hereby agrees and consents to the termination
of any such rights and agreements. The Shareholder agrees to take such
actions, and execute and deliver such agreements and documents, as may
reasonably be requested by Parent in order to effect, confirm or evidence the
foregoing waivers and termination.

  



  

3. _No Voting Trusts_. The Shareholder agrees that, prior to the Termination Time, it will not, and it will use reasonable best efforts to not permit any Person under the Shareholders control to, deposit any of the Shareholders Shares in a voting trust or subject any of the Shareholders Shares to any arrangement with respect to the voting of such Shares other than agreements entered into with Parent.

  



  

4. _No Proxy Solicitations_. The Shareholder agrees that the Shareholder will not, nor will the Shareholder permit any Person under the Shareholders control to, (a) solicit proxies or become a "participant" in a "solicitation" (as such terms are defined in Regulation 14A under the Exchange Act) in opposition to or competition with the consummation of the Merger, (b) subject to Section 9 hereof, directly or indirectly solicit, encourage, initiate or otherwise facilitate any inquiries or the making of any proposal or offer with respect to an Acquisition Proposal or engage in any negotiation concerning, or provide any confidential information or data to, or have any discussions with any Person relating to, an Acquisition Proposal, or (c) become a member of a "group" (as such term is used in Section 13(d) of the Exchange Act) with respect to any voting securities of the Company for the purpose of opposing or competing with the consummation of the Merger.

  



  

5. _Transfer and Encumbrance_. Except for gifts given without consideration where the recipient executes a voting agreement in form and substance similar to this Agreement, the Shareholder agrees that, prior to the Termination Time, the Shareholder will not, directly or indirectly (a) transfer, sell, offer, contract or agree to sell, pledge or otherwise dispose of or encumber any of the Shares or any New Shares or (b) announce any transfer, sale, offer, contract of sale or other disposition of, any of the Shares or any New Shares, to any Person other than (A) pursuant to the Merger, or (B) with prior written consent, which consent will not unreasonably withheld (provided that the exercise of Company options shall not be subject to the terms of this Section 4), unless the person or entity to whom Shares or New Shares have been sold, transferred or disposed agrees to be bound by this Agreement as if a party hereto.

  



  

6. _Specific Performance_. Each party hereto severally acknowledges that it will be impossible to measure in money the damage to the other party if a party hereto fails to comply with any of the obligations imposed by this Agreement and that, in the event of any such failure, the other party will not have an adequate remedy at law or damages.  Accordingly, each party hereto severally agrees that injunctive relief or other equitable remedy, in addition to remedies at 

  



  

59    **    
 **  



  

law or damages, is the appropriate remedy for any such failure and will not
oppose the granting of such relief on the basis that the other party has an
adequate remedy at law. Each party hereto severally agrees that it will not
seek, and agrees to waive any requirement for, the securing or posting of a
bond in connection with any other partys seeking or obtaining such equitable
relief.

  



  

7. _Successors and Assigns_. This Agreement shall be binding upon and inure to the benefit of the parties hereto and their respective successors and assigns and shall not be assignable without the written consent of all other parties hereto.

  



  

8. _Entire Agreement_. This Agreement contains the entire agreement between the parties hereto with respect to the subject matter hereof, and this Agreement supersedes all prior agreements, written or oral, between the parties hereto with respect to the subject matter hereof. This Agreement may not be amended, supplemented or modified, and no provisions hereof may be modified or waived, except by an instrument in writing signed by all the parties hereto.  No waiver of any provisions hereof by any party shall be deemed a waiver of any other provisions hereof by any such party, nor shall any such waiver be deemed a con­tinuing waiver of any provision hereof by such party.

  



  

9. _Shareholder Capacity_. The execution of this Agreement by Shareholder shall be solely in the Shareholders capacity as the beneficial owner of the Shares held by Shareholder, and Shareholder makes no agreement or understanding herein in the Shareholders capacity, if any, as a director, officer or employee of the Company or any of its subsidiaries.

  



  

10. _Preparation of S-4 and Proxy Statement/Prospectus_. Following the consummation of the Merger, Parent, with the assistance of the Company shall, as soon as practicable, prepare and Parent shall file with the SEC a post-effective amendment to the Form S-4 (the " _Post-Effective Amendment"_ ) for the offer and sale of the Parent Common Stock received by Shareholder in the Merger pursuant to the Merger in order to permit Shareholder to freely sell such shares of Parent Common Stock for at least a one-year period following the Merger. Parent shall use commercially reasonable efforts to have the Post-Effective Amendment declared effective under the Securities Act of 1933 (the " _Securities Act_ ") as promptly as practicable after such filing. Parent shall also take any action required to be taken under any applicable state securities laws in connection with the issuance of Parent Common Stock in the Merger. Parent will advise Shareholder and the Company, promptly after it receives notice thereof, of the time when the Post-Effective Amendment has become effective or any supplement or amendment has been filed, the issuance of any stop order, the suspension of the qualification of the Parent Common Stock issuable in connection with the Merger for offering or sale in any jurisdiction, or any request by the SEC for amendment of the Post-Effective Amendment or comments thereon and responses thereto or requests by the SEC for additional information. In the event that such Post-Effective Amendment may not be used for the foregoing purposes, Parent shall promptly following the Merger prepare, file and use commercially reasonable efforts to cause to be declared effective by the SEC a registration statement on Form S-3 (the " _Form S-3_ ") to permit Shareholder, for a one-year period following the Merger to offer and sell shares of Parent Common Stock received in the Merger. Subject to Section 11.8, all costs, expenses, filing fees associated with the preparation, filing and maintaining of the Post-Effective Amendment or the Form S-3 shall be borne by Parent, including the costs and expenses (including reasonable 

  



  

60    **    
 **  



  

counsel fees) incurred by Shareholder in connection with its review of and
participation in connection with the Post-Effective Amendment or the Form
S-3.

  



  

11. _Miscellaneous_.

  



  

11.1 This Agreement shall be deemed a contract made under, and for all
purposes shall be construed in accordance with, the laws of the State of
Delaware without regard to its conflicts of law provisions.

  



  

11.2 If any provision of this Agreement or the application of such provision
to any Person or circumstances shall be held invalid by a court of
competent jurisdiction, the remainder of the provision held invalid and the
application of such provision to Persons or circumstances, other than the
party as to which it is held invalid, shall not be affected.

  



  

11.3 This Agreement may be executed in one or more counterparts, each of
which shall be deemed to be an original but all of which together shall
constitute one and the same instrument. Facsimile signatures shall be valid
and binding as original manual signatures.

  



  

11.4 This Agreement shall terminate upon the earliest to occur of (i)
the consummation of the Merger or (ii) termination of the Merger
Agreement (the " _Termination Time_ "); provided, however, that Section 10
shall survive the consummation of the Merger.  Upon such termination, no
party shall have any further obligations or liabilities hereunder.

  



  

11.5 All Section headings herein are for convenience of reference only and
are not part of this Agreement, and no construction or reference shall be
derived therefrom.

  



  

11.6 From time to time and without additional consideration, the Shareholder
will execute and deliver, or cause to be executed and delivered, such
additional or further transfers, assignments, endorsements, proxies, consents
and other instruments, and perform such further acts, as Parent may
reasonably request for the purpose of effectively carrying out and furthering
the intent of this Agreement.

  



  

11.7 No waiver by any party hereto of any condition or of any breach of any
provision of this Agreement will be effective unless such waiver is set forth
in a writing signed by such party, which writing must refer hereto. No waiver
by any party of such condition or breach, in any one instance, will be deemed
to be a further or continuing waiver of any such condition or breach or a
waiver of any other condition or breach of any other provision contained
herein.

  



  

11.8  Parent agrees that if the Merger is consummated, it shall pay all
fees, costs and expenses (including reasonable attorney fees) up to an
aggregate of $25,000 that are incurred by Shareholder and the other
shareholders of the Company that are entering into similar voting agreements
with Parent in connection with the preparation of this Agreement and the
transactions contemplated hereby (including pursuant to Section 10).

  



  

61    **    
 **  



  

11.9 The obligations of the Shareholder set forth in this Agreement shall not
be effective or binding upon the Shareholder until after such time as the
Merger Agreement is executed and delivered by Parent, Acquisition Sub and
the Company. The parties agree that there is not and has not been any other
agreement, arrangement or understanding between the parties hereto with
respect to the matters set forth herein.

 **REVOCABLE VOTING AGREEMENT**

  



  

THIS REVOCABLE VOTING AGREEMENT (this " _Agreement_ "), dated as of August
__, 2003, is made by and between:

  



  

(a) The Employee Benefits Committee (the " _Committee_ ") of the Board of
Directors (the " _Board_ ") of SPS Technologies, Inc., a Pennsylvania
corporation (the " _Company_ "), in the Committees fiduciary capacity under
Section 4.07 of the Defined Benefit Trust Agreement (the " _Trust_ ") dated
January 2, 2001 between the Company and SEI Private Trust Company (the "
_Trustee_ "); and

  



  

(b) Precision Castparts Corp., an Oregon corporation (" _Parent_ ").

  



  

This Agreement relates to certain shares of common stock of the Company held
by the Trustee under the Trust for the exclusive benefit of participants and
beneficiaries under employee benefit plans (the " _Plans_ ") maintained by
the Company and certain of its affiliates.

  



  

Capitalized terms used in this Agreement but not otherwise defined have the
same meanings ascribed to such terms in the Merger Agreement (as defined
below).

  



  

 **RECITALS**

  



  

WHEREAS Section 4.07 of the Trust provides (a) that the Company is the sole
party empowered to exercise authority, power and discretion with respect
to securities issued by the Company held in the Trust, including but not
limited to proxy voting and disposition of such securities and (b) that the
Trustee shall act upon the written directions of the Company with respect to
any matter involving such securities, and the Board has designated the
Committee as the party to carry out such authority, power and discretion with
respect to such securities; and

  



  

WHEREAS, contemporaneously with the execution and delivery of this Agreement,
Parent, a wholly owned Pennsylvania subsidiary of Parent (" _Acquisition Sub_
") and the Company are entering into an Agreement and Plan of Merger, dated
as of the date hereof (the " _Merger Agreement_ "), pursuant to which the
Company will merge with and into Acquisition Sub (the " _Merger_ "), upon the
terms and conditions set forth therein; and

  



  

WHEREAS the Committee believes that the Merger is in the best interest of
Plan participants and beneficiaries and therefore desires that the Merger
occur and that the Trust receive, at the Committees direction in accordance
with the Merger Agreement, the Trusts portion of the Merger Consideration
for the benefit of Plan participants and beneficiaries;

  



  

NOW, THEREFORE, for good and valuable considera­tion including the effect of
this Agreement as an inducement for Parent, Acquisition Sub and the Company
to enter into the Merger Agreement, the receipt, sufficiency and adequacy of
which are hereby acknowledged, and intending to be legally bound, the parties
hereto agree as follows:

  



  



  

64    **

1. _Representations of Committee_.

  



  

1.1 The Committee represents and warrants that, as of the date of this
Agreement, the Trust is the beneficial holder of the number of shares of the
capital stock of the Company set forth on the signature page to
this Agreement (" _Shares_ ") free and clear of all Liens (other than liens
under applicable law) that would adversely affect the ability of the
Committee to comply with the terms of this Agreement.

  



  

1.2 The Committee represents and warrants that the Trust does not own
beneficially (as such term is defined in the Exchange Act) or of record (a)
any shares of the capital stock of the Company or (b) any rights to
acquire any shares of the capital stock of the Company, other than the
Shares.

  



  

1.3 The Committee represents and warrants that the Committee has full power
and authority to make, enter into and carry out the terms of this Agreement.
This Agreement has been duly executed and delivered by the Committee and
assuming the due authorization, execution and delivery by Parent, unless
revoked by the Committee as provided in Section 3 below or otherwise modified
or invalidated as provided in Section 7.2 below, constitutes a legal, valid
and binding obligation of the Committee, enforceable against the Committee in
accordance with its terms, subject to laws of general application relating to
bankruptcy, insolvency and the relief of debtors and rules of law governing
specific performance, injunctive relief and other equitable remedies.

  



  

1.4 The Committee represents and warrants that the execution and delivery of
this Agreement by the Committee do not, and the performance of this Agreement
by the Committee will not:  (a) conflict with or violate any order applicable
to the Committee or by which the Committee or any of the Shares is bound or
affected; (b) result in any breach of or constitute a default (with notice or
lapse of time, or both) under, or give to others any rights of termination,
amendment, acceleration or cancellation of, or result in the creation of any
Lien applicable to any of the Shares pursuant to any written, oral or other
agreement, contract or legally binding commitment to which the Committee is a
party or by which the Committee or any of the Shares is bound or affected; or
(c) require any written, oral or other agreement, contract or legally binding
commitment of any third party except, in each case, a violation, conflict,
breach, default or commitment which would not be reasonably likely to have a
material adverse effect on the Committees ability to consummate the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement.

  



  

1.5 The Committee represents and warrants that the representations and
warranties contained in this Agreement are accurate in all respects as of the
date of this Agreement, will be accurate in all respects at all times through
Termination Time (as defined in Section 7.4 hereof) and will be accurate in
all respects as of the date of the consummation of the Merger as if made on
that date.

2. _Agreement to Vote Shares; Waiver; Other Agreements_.

  



  

2.1 _Revocation, Modification or Invalidation._ The following Sections 2.2
through 2.6 are subject to revocation, modification or invalidation as
provided in Sections 3 and 7.2 herein.

  



  

2.2 _Voting_. The Committee agrees that prior to the Termination Time, the
Committee shall direct the Trustee to vote at any meeting of the shareholders
of the Company, however called, and in any action taken by written consent of
shareholders of the Company without a meeting, all the Trusts Shares and any
shares of the capital stock of the Company acquired after the date of this
Agreement and prior to the applicable record date (" New Shares") (a) to
approve the Merger and to approve and adopt the Merger Agreement, (b) to
approve any action required in furtherance of the Merger, and (c) against any
action or agreement that would result in a material breach of any
representation, warranty, covenant or obligation of the Company in the Merger
Agreement or that would preclude fulfillment of a condition under the Merger
Agreement to the Companys, Parents or Acquisition Subs respective
obligations to consummate the Merger.

  



  

2.3 _Waiver_.

  



  

(a) The Committee hereby agrees not to exercise any rights of appraisal and
any dissenters rights that the Trust may have (whether under applicable law
or otherwise) with respect to the Shares and any shares of Parent Common
Stock receivable upon conversion of any Shares in connection with the Merger.

  



  

(b) The Committee hereby waives any rights of first refusal, preemptive
rights, rights of redemption or repurchase, rights to notice and similar
rights of the Trust under any agreement, arrangement or
understanding applicable to the Shares or New Shares (other than any
Shareholder rights plan or other rights offered pro rata to all Shareholders
of the Company), in each case as the same may apply to the execution and
delivery of the Merger Agreement and the consummation of the Merger and the
other transactions and acts contemplated by the Merger Agreement.  Effective
immediately prior to the Effective Time, the Committee hereby agrees and
consents to the termination of any such rights and agreements. The Committee
agrees to take such actions, and execute and deliver such agreements and
documents, as may reasonably be requested by Parent in order to effect,
confirm or evidence the foregoing waivers and termination.

  



  

2.4 _No Voting Trusts_.  The Committee agrees that, prior to the Termination
Time, the Committee will not, and it will use reasonable best efforts to not
permit any Person under the Committees control to, deposit any of the
Trusts Shares in a voting trust or subject any of the Trusts Shares to any
arrangement with respect to the voting of such Shares other than agreements
entered into with Parent.

  



  

2.5 _No Proxy Solicitations_. The Committee agrees that the Committee
will not, nor will the Committee permit any Person under the Committees
control to, (a) solicit proxies or become a "participant" in a "solicitation"
(as such terms are defined in

  



  

66    **    
 **  



  

Regulation 14A under the Exchange Act) in opposition to or competition with
the consummation of the Merger, (b) directly or indirectly solicit,
encourage, initiate or otherwise facilitate any inquiries or the making of
any proposal or offer with respect to an Acquisition Proposal or engage in
any negotiation concerning, or provide any confidential information or data
to, or have any discussions with any Person relating to, an Acquisition
Proposal, or (c) become a member of a "group" (as such term is used in
Section 13(d) of the Exchange Act) with respect to any voting securities of
the Company for the purpose of opposing or competing with the consummation of
the Merger.

  



  

2.6 _Transfer and Encumbrance_. The Committee agrees that, prior to the
Termination Time, the Committee will not, directly or indirectly (a)
transfer, sell, offer, contract or agree to sell, pledge or otherwise dispose
of or encumber any of the Shares or any New Shares or (b) announce any
transfer, sale, offer, contract of sale or other disposition of, any of the
Shares or any New Shares, to any Person other than Parent.

  



  

3. _Revocation._ As a fiduciary of an employee benefit plan governed by the Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974 (" _ERISA_ ") the Committee declares, and Parent agrees, that, notwithstanding any provision of this Agreement to the contrary, the Committee may revoke this Agreement prior to the Termination Time if the Committee in its sole discretion after receiving advice from outside counsel on the issue determines in good faith (a) that carrying out this Agreement would be a breach of its fiduciary duty under ERISA, be contrary to the best interests of participants and beneficiaries under the Plans, or otherwise violate the provisions of ERISA or other applicable law or (b) that it would be more favorable to the interests of participants and beneficiaries under the Plans for the Committee to direct the Trustee to accept the terms of another offer.  In order to revoke this Agreement, the Committee shall provide written notice to the Parent of the intent to revoke, including the date and time set by the Committee for the revocation of this Agreement and an explanation of the reason(s) for the revocation and (if applicable) material terms and conditions of the other offer under (b) including, without limitation, the amount and form of the proposed consideration and whether such other offer is subject to any material conditions. To the extent permitted by applicable law and consistent with the Committees fiduciary duty under ERISA, such notice shall be given at least 48 hours before the time set by the Committee for the revocation to be effective, but if less than 48 hours remains before (A) the Termination Time under 7.4(i) or (ii), or (B) the date of the Companys stockholders meeting then the remaining time shall be substituted for the 48-hour minimum.  Upon receipt of such notice, Parent may accept the revocation or propose such alteration of the terms of the Merger Agreement as Parent may wish to propose. The Committee may accept such proposal and rescind its notice of intent to revoke this Agreement, or it may, in its sole discretion after receiving advice from outside counsel on the issue determine in good faith not to do so for one or more of the reasons described in (a) and (b) above. If the Committee does not rescind its proposed revocation by the expiration date and time specified in the Committees notice (or any later expiration date and time that the Committee and Parent may agree will apply), this Agreement shall be revoked and neither party shall be bound by this Agreement after the expiration date and time.

  



  



  

67    **    
 **  



  

4. _Successors and Assigns_. This Agreement shall be binding upon and inure to the benefit of the parties hereto and their respective successors and assigns and shall not be assignable without the written consent of all other parties hereto.

  



  

5. _Entire Agreement_. This Agreement contains the entire agreement between the parties hereto with respect to the subject matter hereof, and this Agreement supersedes all prior agreements, written or oral, between the parties hereto with respect to the subject matter hereof. This Agreement may not be amended, supplemented or modified, and no provisions hereof may be modified or waived, except by an instrument in writing signed by all the parties hereto. No waiver of any provisions hereof by any party shall be deemed a waiver of any other provisions hereof by any such party, nor shall any such waiver be deemed a con­tinuing waiver of any provision hereof by such party.

  



  

6. _Committee Capacity_. The authorization of this Agreement by the Committee, and the execution of this Agreement by the Committee, are solely in the Committees capacity as the Trust fiduciary authorized to direct the Trustee as beneficial owner of the Shares held by the Trust, and no member of the Committee makes any agreement or understanding herein in the members individual capacity or in the members capacity, if any, as a director or officer of the Company apart from his or her role as a member of the Committee.

  



  

7. _Miscellaneous_.

  



  

7.1 This Agreement shall be deemed a contract made under, and for all
purposes shall be construed in accordance with (a) ERISA and (b) to the
extent not preempted by ERISA, by the laws of the State of Delaware without
regard to its conflicts of law provisions.

  



  

7.2 If any provision of this Agreement or the application of such provision
to any Person or circumstances shall be held invalid by a court of
competent jurisdiction, or by a governmental agency, including without
limitation the Department of Labor or the Pension Benefit Guaranty
Corporation, the remainder of the provision held invalid and the application
of such provision to Persons or circumstances, other than the party as to
which it is held invalid, shall not be affected.

  



  

7.3 This Agreement may be executed in one or more counterparts, each of which
shall be deemed to be an original but all of which together shall constitute
one and the same instrument. Facsimile signatures shall be valid and binding
as original manual signatures.

  



  

7.4 This Agreement shall terminate upon the earliest to occur of (i)
the consummation of the Merger, (ii) termination of the Merger Agreement,
or (iii) the revocation of this Agreement by the Committee pursuant to
Section 3 hereof (the " _Termination Time_ ").

  



  

7.5 All Section headings herein are for convenience of reference only and are
not part of this Agreement, and no construction or reference shall be derived
therefrom.

  



  

7.6 From time to time and without additional consideration, the Committee
will execute and deliver, or cause to be executed and delivered, such
additional or further

  



  



  

68    **    
 **  



  

transfers, assignments, endorsements, proxies, consents and other
instruments, and perform such further acts, as Parent may reasonably request
for the purpose of effectively carrying out and furthering the intent of this
Agreement.

  



  

7.7 No waiver by any party hereto of any condition or of any breach of any
provision of this Agreement will be effective unless such waiver is set forth
in a writing signed by such party, which writing must refer hereto. No waiver
by any party of such condition or breach, in any one instance, will be deemed
to be a further or continuing waiver of any such condition or breach or a
waiver of any other condition or breach of any other provision contained
herein.

  



  

7.8 The obligations of the Committee set forth in this Agreement shall not be
effective or binding upon the Committee until after such time as the Merger
Agreement is executed and delivered by Parent, Acquisition Sub and the
Company. The parties agree that there is not and has not been any other
agreement, arrangement or understanding between the parties hereto with
respect to the matters set forth herein.

__________, 2003

  



  



  

Precision Castparts Corp.

  

4650 S.W. Macadam Avenue, Suite 440

  

Portland, OR 97239-4262

  

Telecopy No.: (503) 417-4817

  



  

Ladies and Gentlemen:

  



  

The undersigned has been advised that the undersigned may be deemed to be an
"affiliate" of SPS Technologies, Inc., a Pennsylvania corporation (the "
_Company_ "), as the term "affiliate" is used in and for purposes of
paragraphs (c) and (d) of Rule 145 of the rules and regulations of the
Securities and Exchange Commission (the " _SEC_ ") under the Securities Act
of 1933, as amended (the " _Securities Act_ "). Pursuant to the terms of
the Agreement and Plan of Merger dated as of August 16, 2003 among
Precision Castparts Corp., an Oregon corporation (" _Parent_ "), Star
Acquisition, LLC, a Pennsylvania limited liability company (" _Acquisition
Sub_ ") and the Company (the " _Merger Agreement_ "), the Company will be
merged with and into Acquisition Sub (the " _Merger_ ").

  



  

As a result of the Merger, the undersigned may receive shares of common
stock, without par value, of Parent (the " _Parent Shares_ "), in exchange
for the shares owned by the undersigned of common stock, par value $0.50 per
share, of the Company.

  



  

The undersigned represents, warrants and covenants to Parent that in the
event the undersigned receives any Parent Shares as a result of the Merger:

  



  

(a) The undersigned has carefully read this letter and the Merger Agreement
and has discussed or will discuss the requirements of such documents and
other applicable limitations upon the undersigneds ability to sell, transfer
or otherwise dispose of the Parent Shares, to the extent the undersigned
feels necessary, with the undersigneds counsel or counsel for the Company.

  



  

(b) The undersigned has been advised that the issuance of the Parent Shares
to the undersigned pursuant to the Merger has been or will be registered with
the SEC under the Securities Act on a Registration Statement on Form S-4. The
undersigned has been further advised, however, that since at the time the
Merger was submitted for a vote of the shareholders of the Company, the
undersigned may be deemed to have been an affiliate of the Company and the
distribution by the undersigned or on the undersigneds behalf of the Parent
Shares has not been registered under the Securities Act, dispositions of the
Parent Shares by the undersigned or on the undersigneds behalf may be
restricted under the Securities Act and the rules and

  



  



  

71    **    
 **  



  

regulations thereunder. Accordingly, the undersigned will not sell, transfer
or otherwise dispose of the Parent Shares issued to the undersigned in the
Merger unless the disposition (i) is made in conformity with the volume
and other limitations of Rule 145 under the Securities Act (and otherwise
in accordance with Rule 144 under the Securities Act if the undersigned is
an affiliate of Parent and if so required at the time), (ii) is made pursuant
to an effective registration statement under the Securities Act or (iii) is,
in the opinion of Parents general counsel or other independent counsel
reasonably acceptable to Parent or pursuant to a "no-action" or interpretive
letter obtained by the undersigned from the staff of the SEC, exempt from
registration under the Securities Act; _provided, however,_  that, for so
long as the undersigned holds any Parent Shares as to which the undersigned
is subject to the limitations of Rule 145 and to the extent applicable, Rule
144, Parent will (1) use its commercially reasonable efforts to (A) file all
reports required to be filed by it pursuant to the Securities Exchange Act of
1934, as amended, and the rules and regulations thereunder, as the same shall
be in effect at the time, so as to satisfy the requirements of paragraph (c)
of Rule 144 under the Securities Act that there be available current public
information with respect to Parent and (B) furnish to the undersigned upon
request a written statement as to whether Parent has complied with such
reporting requirements during the 12 months preceding any proposed sale of
Parent Shares by the undersigned under Rule 145 and, to the
extent applicable, Rule 144, and (2) otherwise use its commercially
reasonable efforts to make available to the undersigned the exemption
afforded by Rule 145 and to the extent applicable, Rule 144 with respect to
the sale, transfer or other disposition of the Parent Shares.

  



  

(c) The undersigned also understands that stop transfer instructions will be
given to Parents transfer agents with respect to the Parent Shares and that
there will be placed on the certificates, if any, for the Parent Shares
issued to the undersigned, or any substitutions therefor, a legend stating in
substance:

  



  

THE SHARES REPRESENTED BY THIS CERTIFICATE WERE ISSUED IN A TRANSACTION TO
WHICH RULE 145 PROMULGATED UNDER THE SECURITIES ACT OF 1933, AS
AMENDED, APPLIES. THE SHARES REPRESENTED BY THIS CERTIFICATE MAY NOT BE
SOLD, PLEDGED OR OTHERWISE TRANSFERRED EXCEPT PURSUANT TO AN EFFECTIVE
REGISTRATION STATEMENT OR IN ACCORDANCE WITH AN EXEMPTION FROM THE
REGISTRATION REQUIREMENTS OF THE SECURITIES ACT OF 1933, AS AMENDED.

  

(d) The undersigned also understands that unless a sale or transfer is made
in conformity with the provisions of Rule 145 under the Securities Act (and
satisfactory evidence of such conformity is provided to Parent), or pursuant
to an effective registration statement under the Securities Act, Parent
reserves the right to put the following legend on the certificates issued to
the undersigneds transferee:

  



  

THE SHARES REPRESENTED BY THIS CERTIFICATE HAVE NOT BEEN REGISTERED UNDER
THE SECURITIES ACT OF 1933, AS AMENDED, AND WERE ACQUIRED FROM A PERSON
WHO RECEIVED SUCH SHARES IN A

  



  

72    **    
 **  



  

TRANSACTION TO WHICH RULE 145 PROMULGATED UNDER THE SECURITIES ACT OF 1933,
AS AMENDED, APPLIES. THE SHARES HAVE BEEN ACQUIRED BY THE HOLDER NOT WITH A
VIEW TO, OR FOR RESALE IN CONNECTION WITH, ANY DISTRIBUTION THEREOF WITHIN
THE MEANING OF THE SECURITIES ACT OF 1933, AS AMENDED, AND MAY NOT BE SOLD,
PLEDGED OR OTHERWISE TRANSFERRED EXCEPT IN ACCORDANCE WITH AN EXEMPTION FROM
THE REGISTRATION REQUIREMENTS OF THE SECURITIES ACT OF 1933, AS AMENDED.

  

It is understood and agreed that the legends set forth in paragraphs (c) and
(d) above will be removed by delivery of substitute certificates without such
legends and/or any transfer instructions will be lifted (i) at the written
request of the undersigned to Parent and with evidence reasonably acceptable
to Parent, if one year shall have elapsed from the date of the Merger and the
provisions of Rule 145(d)(2) are then available to the undersigned, (ii) at
the written request of the undersigned to Parent and with evidence reasonably
acceptable to Parent, if two years shall have elapsed from the date of the
Merger and the provisions of Rule 145(d)(3) are then applicable to the
undersigned, or (iii) if the undersigned shall have delivered to Parent (A) a
copy of a "no action" letter or interpretive letter obtained by the
undersigned from the staff of the SEC, or an opinion of counsel, which
opinion and counsel shall be reasonably satisfactory to Parent, to the effect
that such legend is not required for purposes of the Securities Act, or (B),
with evidence reasonably acceptable to Parent, a written statement that the
Parent Shares represented by such certificates are being or have been sold in
conformity with the provisions of Rule 145(d) or pursuant to an effective
registration statement under the Securities Act.

  



  

Execution of this letter should not be considered an admission on the part of
the undersigned that the undersigned is an "affiliate" of the Company as
described in the first paragraph of this letter, or as a waiver of any rights
the undersigned may have to object to any claim that the undersigned is such
an affiliate on or after the date of this letter.
