in good faith any potential adjustments to the Estimated Closing Statement
raised by Buyer prior to the Closing and make any corresponding changes to the
Estimated Closing Statement that Seller reasonably deems appropriate based on
Buyers proposed adjustments (in which case, such report reflecting such

obligations of Seller to consider in good faith any proposed adjustments shall
in no event require that the anticipated Closing Date be postponed or
otherwise delayed.

consideration for the Shares, at the Closing, Buyer shall pay the following
amounts:

(i) an amount of cash equal to the portion of the Estimated Closing Date

immediately available funds to such account or accounts as directed in the
applicable payoff letter delivered to Buyer no later than two Business Days

Buyer shall prepare and deliver to Seller (1) a written statement (the "
_Closing Statement_ ") setting forth (A) a proposed calculation of the Net
Working Capital (the " _Proposed Closing Date Net Working Capital_ "), (B) a
proposed calculation of the Closing Date Funded Indebtedness (the " _Proposed
Closing Date Indebtedness_ "), (C) a proposed calculation of the Closing Date
Cash and Cash Equivalents (the " _Proposed Closing Date Cash and Cash
Equivalents_ "), (D) a proposed calculation of the Transaction Expenses
unpaid as of the Closing (the " _Proposed Transaction Expenses_ ") and (E) a
proposed calculation of the resulting Purchase Price (the " _Proposed Purchase
Price Calculation_ ") based on the Proposed Closing Date Net Working Capital,
the Proposed Closing Date Indebtedness, the Proposed Closing Date Cash and
Cash Equivalents, the Proposed Transaction Expenses and the other components
of the Purchase Price as set forth in the Estimated Purchase Price, (2) the
consolidated balance sheet of the Company as of 12:01 a.m. (Eastern Time) on
the Closing Date (the " _Closing Date Balance Sheet_ ") and (3) reasonable
detail, include supporting schedules and analyses as appropriate, with
respect to each of the components described in the foregoing clauses (1) and
(2). The Proposed Closing Date Net Working Capital, Proposed Closing Date
Indebtedness, the Proposed Closing Date Cash and Cash Equivalents, the
Proposed Transaction Expenses and the Proposed Purchase Price Calculation
shall collectively be referred to herein from time to time as the " _Proposed
Closing Date Calculations_." The Proposed Closing Date Calculations shall be
calculated in good faith in accordance with the Accounting Principles
Consistently Applied and this Agreement, including Schedule A-1 and A-2.

 

(ii) Following Sellers receipt of the Closing Statement through the final
determination of the Purchase Price (including any dispute period described
below), Seller and its representatives shall, at Sellers expense, be
permitted reasonable access to review the working papers of Buyer, the Company
and their independent accountant relating to the Proposed Closing
Date Calculations (subject to the execution of any customary work paper
access letters required by any of the representatives of Buyer). Seller may
dispute the Proposed Closing Date Calculations by delivering a written notice
of dispute (a " _Purchase Price Dispute Notice_ ") to Buyer within 30 days of
receiving the Closing Statement, which Purchase Price Dispute Notice shall set
forth the basis for the dispute and those items or amounts as to which Seller
disagrees, and any item or amount not so specifically disputed shall be
deemed accepted as set forth in the Closing Statement. If Seller does note
deliver a Purchase Price Dispute Notice to Buyer within 30 days of receiving
the Closing Statement, the Closing Statement shall be final, conclusive and
binding on the parties for all purposes. Buyer and Seller will use
commercially reasonable efforts to resolve any such dispute during the 30-day
period commencing on the date Buyer receives the Purchase Price Dispute
Notice from Seller. If such disputed matters are resolved within such 30-day
period, then the Proposed Closing Date Calculations, with such changes as
may have been previously agreed in writing by Seller and Buyer, shall be
deemed final, conclusive and binding on the parties for all purposes. If
Seller and Buyer do not obtain a final resolution within such 30-day period,
then the items in dispute shall be submitted promptly to KPMG LLP (" _KPMG_ ")
or, if KPMG

 



\- 15 -

    

 declines to serve, another independent accounting firm of national standing
mutually agreed to by Buyer and Seller (the " _Accounting Firm_ "), subject to
that firms confirmation that it is independent of both Seller and Buyer. The
Accounting Firm shall be instructed to render a determination, acting as an
accounting expert and not an arbitrator, of the applicable dispute and the
resulting final Purchase Price within 30 days after engagement of the
Accounting Firm with respect to the dispute, which determination must be in
writing and must set forth, in reasonable detail, the basis therefor. The
determination of the Accounting Firm shall be conclusive, binding and non-
appealable upon Buyer and Seller (absent manifest arithmetic error or failure
to comply with instructions required to be issued under this _Section_ __ _
2.3_) and judgment may be entered upon the determination of the Accounting
Firm in any court having jurisdiction over the party against which such
determination is to be enforced.

 

(1) The Accounting Firm shall determine, based solely on written submissions
by Buyer and Seller and their respective representatives, and not by
independent review, only those items disputed in the Purchase Price Dispute
Notice that have not been agreed upon in writing by the parties and may not
resolve any disputed matter of Law or fact, except to correct plain error.
There will be no ex parte communications between Seller or Buyer and the
Accounting Firm, other than written answers by Seller or Buyer to written
questions of the Accounting Firm (copies of which shall be provided
simultaneously to Buyer or Seller, as applicable), but each of Seller and
Buyer shall have the right to reply in writing to the written presentation of
the other within ten days after its receipt of the others written
presentation. In resolving any disputed item, the Accounting Firm shall be
bound by the Accounting Principles Consistently Applied, the applicable
definitions set forth in this Agreement and the other requirements of this
_Section_ __ _ 2.3_ and shall not assign a value to any item greater than
the greatest value for such item claimed by either party or less than the
smallest value for such item claimed by either party.

(2) If Buyer does not deliver the Proposed Closing Date Calculations within
the time period required by _Section_ __ _ 2.3(d)(i)_, at Sellers option it
may accept the Estimated Purchase Price as the Final Statement of
Purchase Price or it may submit in writing to Buyer its own Proposed Closing
Date Calculations within 30 days of the expiration of the deadline for Buyers
delivery of the Proposed Closing Date Calculations (whereupon Buyer and Seller
shall follow the requirements of this _Section_ __ _ 2.3(d)(ii)_, with Buyer
having a 30-day period following Sellers delivery of the Proposed Closing
Date Calculations to deliver a Purchase Price Dispute Notice).

(3) The " _Final Statement of Purchase Price_ " shall mean (A) if a Purchase
Price Dispute Notice is not delivered by Seller within the time period
required by this _Section_ __ _ 2.3(d)(ii)_, the amount of the Proposed
Purchase Price Calculation, (B) at Sellers option, the Estimated Purchase
Price, if Buyer does not deliver the Proposed Purchase Price Calculation, (C)
the amount agreed as the final Purchase Price at any time in writing by Buyer
and Seller or (D) the final Purchase Price as set forth in the written
determination of the Accounting Firm made in accordance with the provisions
of this _Section_ __ _ 2.3(d)(ii)_.

 



\- 16 -

    

(iii) In the event Seller and Buyer submit any unresolved objections to the
Accounting Firm for resolution as provided in _Section_ __ _ 2.3(d)(ii)_
above, the fees, costs and expenses of the Accounting Firm (A) shall be paid
by Buyer in the proportion that the aggregate dollar amount of such disputed
items so submitted that are successfully disputed by Seller (as finally
determined by the Accounting Firm) bears to the aggregate dollar amount of
such items so submitted and (B) shall be paid by Seller in the proportion that
the aggregate dollar amount of such disputed items so submitted that are
unsuccessfully disputed by Seller (as finally determined by the Accounting
Firm) bears to the aggregate dollar amount of such items so submitted.

 

(e) _Adjustment to Estimated Purchase Price_.

 

(i) If the Actual Adjustment is a positive amount, then within three Business
Days after the date on which the Purchase Price is finally determined
pursuant to _Section_ __ _ 2.3(d)_, Buyer shall pay to Seller an amount equal
to the Actual Adjustment, by wire transfer or delivery of other immediately
available funds.

 

(ii) If the Actual Adjustment is a negative amount, then within three Business
Days after the date on which the Purchase Price is finally determined
pursuant to _Section_ __ _ 2.3(d)_ above, Seller shall pay to Buyer an amount
equal to the Actual Adjustment, by wire transfer or delivery of other
immediately available funds.

 

2.4 _Withholding_ _._ Buyer, Seller, and the Company shall be entitled to
deduct and withhold from any amount otherwise payable pursuant to this
Agreement such amounts as are required to be deducted and withheld with
respect to the making of such payment under the Code or any provision of Tax
Law; _provided_ that, if a party becomes aware that any deduction
or withholding applies to amounts otherwise payable to any Person pursuant to
this Agreement, such party shall (a) provide such Person with reasonably
prompt notice upon having become so aware, and (b) provide such Person with
copies of any receipts or other official documentation received from the
relevant Governmental Authority with respect to any such deduction or
withholding. To the extent that amounts are so withheld and remitted to the
applicable Tax authority, such amounts shall be treated for all purposes of
this Agreement as having been paid to the Person in respect of which such
deduction and withholding was made.

its reasonable best efforts to take, or cause to be taken, all action, and to
do, or cause to be done, all things reasonably necessary, proper or advisable
under applicable Laws to consummate and make effective the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement. Following the Closing, each of the parties
hereto shall, and shall cause their respective Affiliates to, execute and

\- 44 -

    

(b) Each party hereto shall, as promptly as possible, use its reasonable best
efforts to obtain, or cause to be obtained, all consents, authorizations,
orders and approvals from all Governmental Authorities that may be or become
necessary for its execution and delivery of this Agreement and the performance
of its obligations pursuant to this Agreement. Each party shall cooperate
fully with each other party and its Affiliates in promptly seeking to obtain
all such consents, authorizations, orders and approvals. The parties hereto
shall not willfully take any action that would have the effect of delaying,
impairing or impeding the receipt of any required consents, authorizations,
orders and approvals. If required by the HSR Act or any non-U.S. Law designed
to prohibit, restrict or regulate actions for the purpose or effect of
monopolization or restraint of trade or the significant impediment of
effective competition, each party hereto agrees to make an appropriate filing
pursuant to the HSR Act and/or such non-U.S. Laws with respect to the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement as promptly as practicable after
the date hereof (and, with respect to any filing pursuant to the HSR Act,
within ten Business Days after the date hereof) and to supply as promptly as
practicable to the appropriate Governmental Authority any additional
information and documentary material that may be requested pursuant to the HSR
Act or such non-U.S. Laws. The parties further agree to request early

expirations or terminations of waiting periods are required to be obtained
from, any other Governmental Authorities in connection with the execution and
delivery of this Agreement and the consummation of the transactions
contemplated hereby; (ii) timely making all such filings and timely obtaining
all such consents, permits, authorizations and approvals; and (iii) defending
through litigation on the merits any claim asserted in court by any party in
order to avoid entry of, or to have vacated or terminated, any order of a
Governmental Authority (whether temporary, preliminary or permanent) that
would prevent the consummation of the Closing.

 

(d) All analyses, appearances, meetings, discussions, presentations,
memoranda, briefs, filings, arguments, and proposals made by or on behalf of
any party before any Governmental Authority or the staff or regulators of any
Governmental Authority in connection with the transactions contemplated
hereunder (but, for the avoidance of doubt, not including any interactions
between Buyer, Seller or the Company with Governmental Authorities in the
ordinary course of business, any disclosure which is not permitted by Law or
any disclosure containing confidential information) shall be disclosed to the
other parties hereunder in advance of any filing, submission or attendance,
it being the intent that the parties will consult and cooperate with one
another, and consider in good faith the views of one another, in connection
with any such analyses, appearances, meetings, discussions, presentations,
memoranda, briefs, filings, arguments, and proposals. Buyer shall give notice
to Seller, and Seller shall give notice to Buyer, with respect to any proposed
meeting, discussion, appearance or contact with any Governmental Authority
or the staff or regulators of any Governmental Authority, with such notice
being sufficient to provide the other parties with the opportunity to attend
and participate in such meeting, discussion, appearance or contact.

(e) Seller (with the reasonable cooperation of Buyer) shall use reasonable
best efforts to give all notices to, and obtain all consents from, all third
parties that are required in connection with the consummation of the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement; _provided_ , _however_ , that (i)
neither Seller nor Buyer shall be obligated to pay any consideration therefor
to any third party from whom consent or approval is requested and (ii) for the
avoidance of doubt, the obtaining of any such consent or approval shall not be
a condition to the consummation of the Closing.

(f) Neither Buyer, nor Seller, nor any of their respective Affiliates shall
enter into any agreement, transaction or any agreement to effect any
transaction (including any merger or acquisition) that could reasonably be
expected to make it materially more difficult, or to materially increase the
time required, to (i) obtain the expiration or termination of the waiting
period under the HSR Act, or any other antitrust, competition or trade
regulation Law applicable to the transaction contemplated hereby, (ii) avoid
the entry of, the commencement of litigation seeking the entry of, or to
effect the dissolution of, any injunction, temporary restraining order or
other order that would materially delay or prevent the consummation of the
transactions contemplated hereby or (iii) obtain all authorizations, consents,
orders and approvals of Governmental Authorities necessary for the
consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby.



     | 6.4 |

_Notification of Certain Events_.

conditions specified in _ARTICLE VII_. Seller shall promptly notify Buyer if
any member of the Seller Group or the Company receives any communication from
any Key Customer or Key Supplier that such Key Customer or Key Supplier
intends to terminate or materially reduce its business relationship with the

business relationship with the Company regarding the transactions
contemplated hereby. Following such initial press release and prior to the
Closing, Buyer and Seller (and its Affiliates) will cooperate with each other
regarding the form, content and timing of any other public disclosure or
announcement of this Agreement or the transactions contemplated hereby, and
the parties will not, and will use commercially reasonable efforts to cause
each of their Affiliates and their respective representatives not to, issue
or cause the publication of any press release or other public disclosure or
announcement with respect to this Agreement, the transactions contemplated by
this Agreement, their discussions or any other memoranda, letters or
agreements between the parties relating to the transactions contemplated by
this Agreement without the prior consent of Buyer and Seller (such consent not
to be unreasonably delayed, conditioned or withheld); _provided_ , _however_ ,
that nothing contained in this _Section_ __ _ 6.5_ shall prohibit (i) either
Seller or Buyer from announcing or otherwise disclosing the existence of this
Agreement to any employee, consultant, customer, supplier or other Person
having a business relationship with it to the extent

 



\- 46 -

    

 reasonably necessary to conduct their businesses in the ordinary course or
(ii) any party or any Person related to such party from making any public
filing, disclosure or announcement or issuing or publishing any press release
that is (x) required by applicable Law or (y) in response to inquiry by any
Governmental Authority, so long as such party shall, in each case of (i) and
(ii), use commercially reasonable efforts to provide the other parties with
the opportunity to review and comment on such disclosure, announcement or
press release before it is made, issued or published.

organizational documents of the Company as in effect on the date of
this Agreement, or pursuant to any other agreements in effect on the date

terms.

 

(b) Seller shall cause the Company to obtain as of the Closing Date a "tail"

that are not less advantageous to the directors and officers of the Company,
in each case with respect to claims arising out of or relating to
events which occurred on or prior to the Closing Date (including in
connection with the transactions contemplated by this Agreement). The costs
associated with obtaining the "tail" insurance policy described in the
immediately preceding sentence (the " _D andO Tail Insurance Costs_") shall be
paid by the Company and constitute a Transaction Expense.

(c) The obligations of Buyer and the Company under this _Section_ __ _ 6.6_
shall not be terminated or modified in such a manner as to adversely affect
any director, or officer to whom this _Section_ __ _ 6.6_ applies without
the consent of such affected director, or officer (it being expressly agreed
that the directors and officers to whom this _Section_ __ _ 6.6_ applies
shall be third-party beneficiaries of this  _Section_ __ _ 6.6_, each of
whom may enforce the provisions of this _Section_ __ _ 6.6_).

(d) In the event that Buyer, the Company or any of their respective
successors or assigns (i) consolidates with or merges into any other Person
and shall not be the continuing or surviving corporation or entity in such
consolidation or merger or (ii) transfers all or substantially all of its
properties and assets to any Person, then, and in either such case, proper

otherwise agreed to in writing by the parties, effective prior to the

---|---|--- 
 

Buyer has bound the representations and warranties insurance policy in the
form delivered to Buyer (the " _R andW Insurance Policy_") insuring Buyer for
Losses due to breaches of representations and warranties of Seller under
_ARTICLE III_ and _ARTICLE IV_. Buyer shall cause the RandW Insurance Policy to
provide that the insurer has no subrogation rights against Seller (except for
Fraud), and Buyer will not amend the subrogation or third-party beneficiary
provisions contained in the RandW Insurance Policy benefitting Seller or
otherwise amend or modify the RandW Insurance Policy in a manner adverse to
Seller without the prior written consent of Seller. Buyer agrees to pay the
total premium and related taxes, fees and expenses for the RandW Insurance
Policy. For the avoidance of doubt, Buyer acknowledges and agrees that

consummate the transactions contemplated by this Agreement.

jurisdiction pertaining to the matters released herein and expressly waives
and releases any and all rights and benefits conferred upon Buyer or Seller,

WHICH IF KNOWN BY HIM OR HER MUST HAVE MATERIALLY AFFECTED HIS OR HER
SETTLEMENT WITH THE DEBTOR.

(b) Each of Buyer and the Company, on the one hand, and Seller, on the other
hand, effective upon the Closing, jointly and severally, for themselves and

any then-unvested awards in respect of the common stock of Parent (the

vest, with any applicable performance goals deemed satisfied at no less than
the target level, and any vested stock options to purchase shares of common
stock of Parent held by a Company Service Provider shall remain exercisable
for no less than three years following the Closing. Without limiting the
generality of the foregoing, effective as of no later than the Closing,
Seller shall settle performance-based restricted stock units granted in
connection with Sellers acquisition of the Company for unrestricted common
stock of Parent based on the number of shares that would have been earned
had performance been achieved at the target level. For the avoidance of
doubt, Seller or Parent shall retain or assume, and the Company and Buyer
shall not assume or retain, any Liabilities related to the Parent Equity
Awards or the issuance of common stock of Parent.

Continuing Employees will participate effective as of the Closing, Buyer
shall, or shall cause the Company to, recognize all service of the Company
Continuing Employees with the Company as if such service were with Buyer, for
vesting and eligibility purposes in any Buyer Benefit Plan in which such
Company Continuing Employees may be eligible to participate after the Closing
Date; _provided, however_ , such service shall not be recognized to the
extent that (x) such recognition would result in a duplication of benefits or
(y) such service was not recognized under the corresponding Benefit Plan. In
addition, subject to the terms of the applicable Buyer Benefit Plan, Buyer
shall use commercially reasonable efforts to (x) waive all limitations as to
preexisting conditions, exclusions and waiting periods with respect to
participation and coverage requirements applicable to Company Continuing
Employees under any Buyer Benefit Plan that is a group health plan in which
such Company Continuing Employees may be eligible to participate after the
Closing and (y) provide each Company Continuing Employee with credit for any
co-payments and deductibles paid during the plan year in which the Closing
occurs in satisfying any applicable deductible or out-of-pocket requirements
under any Buyer Benefit Plans that are group health plans in which such
Company Continuing Employee is eligible to participate after the Closing.

(c) This _Section 6.11_ shall be binding upon and inure solely to the benefit
of each of the parties to this Agreement, and nothing in this _Section 6.11_
, express or implied, shall confer upon any other Person any rights or
remedies of any nature whatsoever under or by reason of this _Section 6.11_.

whatsoever.

maintain in effect the Equity Commitment Letters, (ii) maintain in effect the

satisfied or waived by the applicable party hereto, Buyer shall use
reasonable best efforts to cause the Financing Entities to provide the

adversely modifies or expands any existing) conditions to the consummation of
all or any portion of the Financing as compared to those in the applicable
Commitment Letter as in effect on the date of this Agreement or (ii) reduces,
or would have the effect of reducing, including by increasing the amount of
fees to be paid or original issuance discount, the amount of the Financing
intended to be funded at Closing, or (iii) would reasonably be expected to

transactions contemplated by this Agreement to be consummated at Closing (it
being understood and agreed that an amendment, replacement, supplement or
other modification of the Commitment Letters to add investors, lenders,
lead arrangers, book runners, syndication agents or similar entities who had
not executed the Commitment Letters as of the date of this Agreement would not
reasonably be expected to prevent, materially impede or delay the consummation
of the Financing or the transactions contemplated by this Agreement or the
availability of the Financing under the Commitment Letters). Buyer shall
promptly deliver to Seller copies of any amendment, replacement, supplement,
modification or waiver to either Commitment Letter.

(c) In the event that any portion of the Debt Financing becomes unavailable,
regardless of the reason therefor, Buyer will promptly use reasonable best
efforts to obtain alternative debt financing (in an amount sufficient to
consummate the transactions contemplated by this Agreement) from the same or
other sources (" _Replacement Financing_ ") on terms and conditions that are
at least as favorable to Buyer as those contained in the Debt Commitment
Letters and the related fee letters as of the date hereof. For purposes of
this Agreement, (A) the term "Debt Commitment Letter" shall be deemed to
include any commitment letter (or similar agreement) with respect to any debt
financing arranged in compliance herewith (and any Debt Commitment Letter
remaining in effect at the time in question) and (B) the term
"Financing Entities" shall be deemed to include any financing sources with
respect to any debt financing arranged in compliance herewith and (C) the term
"Debt Financing" shall be deemed to include any Replacement Financing and any
other financing that is arranged in compliance herewith and replaces or
supplements the Debt Financing contemplated by the Debt Commitment Letters as
of the date hereof. Buyer shall provide Seller with prompt written notice (i)
of any actual or threatened (in writing) breach, default, repudiation or
termination by any party to any Debt Commitment Letter that Buyer is aware of
or (ii) at any time for any reason Buyer believes in good faith that it will
not be able to obtain the Financing on the terms and conditions in the manner
or from the sources contemplated by any of the Debt Commitment Letters.

(d) Seller shall and shall cause its Affiliates to, and shall use its
reasonable best efforts to cause its and their respective representatives to
provide all cooperation that is necessary, customary or advisable and
requested by Buyer to assist Buyer in arranging, obtaining and syndicating
any of the Financing including, without limitation, by (i) making senior
management (including Key Employees) of the Company available to participate
at reasonable times in a reasonable number of meetings, presentations, road

in advance with proposed lenders, underwriters, initial purchasers or
placement agents, and in sessions with rating agencies, (ii)
providing reasonable and timely assistance to Buyer and the Financing Parties
in their preparation of (1) materials for lender presentations, confidential

purchase and sale contemplated herein 

 



\- 51 -

6.12(d)_ shall require the Seller to prepare any pro forma financial
statements), (iii) as promptly as practicable on an ongoing basis, furnishing
Buyer with such financial and other information relating to the Company as is
customary or reasonably necessary for the arrangement, syndication and
completion of the Financing including the unaudited consolidated balance
sheet and consolidated statements of income and cash flows of the Company as
of and for each month ended at least 45 days prior to the Closing, (iv)
cooperating in and facilitating reasonable due diligence by the
Financing Parties (including by providing due diligence materials reasonably
requested by the Financing Parties) and taking all actions reasonably
necessary (x) to allow the Financing Parties to evaluate the Companys current
assets, properties, inventory, cash management and accounting systems, and
policies and procedures relating thereto for the purpose of establishing
collateral arrangements to the extent reasonable (including cooperating in and
facilitating and completion of field examinations, collateral audits, asset
appraisals and surveys, in each case, during normal business hours and upon
reasonable written request, and providing reasonable access to Buyer and its
representatives to all applicable real property) and (y) establish bank and
other accounts and blocked account agreements and lock box arrangements in
connection with the Financing (it being understood that signatures to such
agreements shall be held in escrow prior to the Closing, and such agreements
shall only be effective after the occurrence of the Closing Date), (v) if
requested in writing by Buyer at least eight Business Days prior to the
Closing Date, furnish to Buyer and the Financing Parties all information
regarding the Company that is requested by Buyer and required in connection
with the Financing by regulatory authorities under applicable "beneficial
ownership," "know your customer" and anti-money laundering rules and
regulations, including the Patriot Act, at least five Business Days prior to
the Closing Date, (vii) executing and delivering definitive financing
documents, including any pledge and security documents, any loan agreements,

such agreements shall only be effective from and after the occurrence of the
Closing), and in each case assisting in the preparation thereof and of
applicable schedules and other information necessary in connection therewith,
(viii) providing customary authorization letters authorizing the
distribution of information to prospective lenders and containing customary
representations, and (ix) using reasonable best efforts to facilitate the
pledging of collateral (including delivery of stock and other equity
certificates of the Company on the Closing Date).

(e) The Seller and its Subsidiaries shall deliver all notices and take other
actions required to facilitate the termination of the Companys commitments,
obligations and liabilities under the Parent ABL Facility and the Indentures,
and release of any Liens and guarantees in connection therewith on the Closing
Date. The Seller shall furnish to the Buyer no later than one (1) Business
Day prior to the Closing a termination letter or other definitive agreement
(together with all customary or required evidence of lien releases) (the "
_Payoff Documents_ ") in substantially final form and in form and substance
reasonably satisfactory to Buyer from the applicable agent, trustee or other
representative on behalf of all the Persons or financial institutions to which
such indebtedness is owed stating that all obligations (including guarantees)
in respect thereof and Liens in connection therewith on the assets of the
Company and the shares of capital stock of the Company (including the Shares)
shall be, substantially concurrently with the Closing, irrevocably released
and terminated, or arrangements satisfactory to Buyer for such release shall
have been made by such time, and providing for and effecting the release of
record of all such Liens substantially concurrently with the Closing.

 



\- 52 -

    

(f) Notwithstanding any other provision of this Agreement to the contrary,
nothing in the foregoing _Section_ __ _ 6.12_ will require the Seller or any
of its Subsidiaries to (i) waive or amend any terms of this Agreement or agree
to pay any fees (including any commitment or similar fees) or reimburse any
expenses prior to the Closing, (ii) enter into, or have any liability or
obligation under, any Definitive Agreement, certificate or other document that

any such resolutions, consents or approvals executed by a Person in their
capacity as holder of the office(s) which such Person will hold following the
Closing), (iii) take any action that, in the good faith determination of the
Seller, would unreasonably interfere with the conduct of the business of the
Seller or any of its Subsidiaries, (iv) provide any information the
disclosure of which is prohibited or restricted under material applicable Law

or any confidentiality obligation binding on the Seller or any of
its Subsidiaries (provided that in each case the parties will use
commercially reasonable efforts to make appropriate substitute disclosure
arrangements to the extent possible), (v) be required to give any indemnities
in connection with the Financing (except, in the case of the Company, for
indemnities in the Definitive Agreements that are effective from and after the

by _Section_ __ _ 6.13(c)_, neither Seller nor any other member of the

in, carry on in any manner, or have an ownership interest in any Person
engaged in, any Competing Business.

(c) _Section 6.13(b)_ shall not preclude, prohibit or restrict Seller or any
member of Seller Group from owning five percent (5%) or less of the
outstanding publicly traded securities and voting power of any Person engaged
in the business of the Company, so long as neither Seller nor any of its
Affiliates or its or their respective directors, officers or employees
exercise management or control functions with respect to such Person.

 

(d) For five (5) years after the Closing, unless Buyer has otherwise consented
in writing, Seller shall, and shall cause its Affiliates to, retain in
confidence any and all confidential, proprietary and trade secret information
to the extent related to the business of the Company, and shall not disclose

receive any payments or other funds due to the other, then the party
receiving such funds shall promptly forward such funds to the proper party and
(ii) make a payment to any Person on behalf of the other party, then the party

right of offset regarding such payments and a party may not withhold funds
received from third parties for the account of the other party in the event
there is a dispute regarding any other issue under this Agreement or any of
the Transaction Documents.

(b) Seller, on the one hand, and Buyer, on the other hand, on behalf of

respective officers, directors, employees and agents), on the one hand, and
Buyer and its Affiliates (and their respective officers, directors, employees

businesses, copies thereof) to the other party. No party shall open mail
unambiguously intended for another party and marked confidential or

purposes.

(c) Each party to this Agreement shall, at the request of the other, at any

(b) the Company shall remain entitled to all rights under any Seller Insurance
Policies with respect to any claim, act, omission, event, circumstance,
occurrence, loss or allegation of wrongful act that occurred or existed prior
to the Closing Date (a " _Pre-Closing Date Event_"), and to the extent Buyer
so requests, Seller shall file and use commercially reasonable efforts to
pursue on behalf of the Company claims under occurrence-based Seller Insurance
Policies that were in effect at any time prior to the Closing (the "
_Occurrence Policies_ "), in respect of any loss or liability to the extent
insured under the terms and conditions of any Occurrence Policy (whether or

Closing Date Event, regardless of when such claim is reported (a " _Company
Occurrence-Based Claim_ ").

 



\- 55 -

respect to any Company Occurrence-Based Claim; _provided_ that Seller may not
enter into any settlement, provide any release to any insurance carrier or

the Seller Marks solely on the Materials that exist as of the date of this
Agreement in connection with the business of the Company in substantially the
same manner as such Seller Marks and Materials were used in connection with
the business of the Company prior to the Closing and solely to the extent any
such inventory of Materials bearing the Seller Marks remains with the Company
as of the Closing; the Company shall not create any additional Materials
bearing the Seller Marks after the Closing Date. Buyer and its Affiliates
(including the Company) are not purchasing, acquiring or otherwise obtaining
any right, title or interest in Seller Marks, except for the limited right for
the Company to use such Seller Marks as expressly set forth in the
immediately preceding sentence. Nothing set forth in the foregoing shall limit
Companys nominative use of the Seller Marks, including for the purposes of

year period preceding the Closing Date (which services may include corporate
services provided by Seller or its Affiliates and services provided pursuant
to third-party contracts, shared between the Company, on the one hand, and
Seller or its Affiliates, on the other hand), and the Company (or, if prior

and DS Services with respect to purchases by DS Services of products from the
Company shall continue on terms, including with respect to the products,
pricing (and pricing changes), volume, exclusivity, quality and standard of
care consistent in all material respects with past practice during the one-
year period prior to the date of this Agreement until the earlier of (i) such
time as the Company and DS Services enter into a Supply Agreement or (ii) the
one year anniversary of the Closing Date.



     | 6.18 |

_Parent Guarantee_. 

---|---|--- 
 

Parent hereby irrevocably and unconditionally guarantees to the Buyer the
payment and performance by Seller of its covenants, obligations, liabilities
and agreements under this Agreement and the Transaction Documents, when and as
the same shall become due and payable in accordance with the terms and
conditions of this Agreement and the Transaction Documents, as applicable
(the " _Guaranteed Obligations_ "). Parent acknowledges and agrees that such
guaranty shall be a guaranty of payment and performance and not of collection,
and is to remain in force until all obligations of Seller under this Agreement
and the Transaction Documents shall have been performed or satisfied in full.
The liability of Parent under this Agreement shall not be released or
diminished by any variation of the terms of this Agreement or the Transaction
Documents (whether or not agreed by Parent), any forbearance, neglect or
delay in seeking performance of the obligations hereby imposed or any granting
of time for such performance. If Seller shall default in the due and punctual
payment or performance of the Guaranteed Obligations, Parent will upon demand
by Buyer forthwith make full payment or performance of the Guaranteed
Obligations to the appropriate Person pursuant to the terms of this Agreement
and/or the Transaction Documents, as applicable. No setoff, counterclaim,
reduction or diminution of any obligation of any kind or nature which Parent
may have or assert against Buyer shall be available hereunder to the Parent
against the Seller. The Parents guarantee hereunder is
unconditional irrespective of any change in the corporate existence,
structure or ownership of Seller, or any insolvency, bankruptcy,
reorganization or other similar proceeding affecting the Seller or its assets.
Parent waives notice of the Sellers acceptance of and reliance on this
guarantee. Parent further waives any right it may have to (a) require Buyer to
proceed against or exhaust any right against Seller or any other Person, or
(b) require Buyer to pursue any other remedy within their power and Parent
agrees that all of its obligations under this guarantee are independent of the
obligations of the Seller and that a separate action may be brought against
Parent whether or not an action is commenced against Seller. Parent waives
any defense arising by reason of any incapacity, disability, lack of authority
or power, or other defense of Seller based on or arising out of the lack of
validity or the unenforceability of this guarantee or any agreement
or instrument relating thereto. Parent acknowledges that it will receive
substantial direct and indirect benefits from the transactions contemplated by
this Agreement and the Transaction Documents and that the waivers set forth in
this  _Section_ __ _ 6.18_ are made knowingly in contemplation of such
benefits. Parent represents and warrants to Buyer as follows that (I) it is
duly organized, validly existing and in good standing under the laws of
Canada, (II) it has all necessary power and authority to execute and deliver
and perform its obligations under this Agreement and each of the Transaction
Documents to which it is a party and to consummate the transactions
contemplated hereby or thereby in accordance with the terms hereof or
thereof, (III) the execution, delivery and performance by Parent of its
obligations pursuant to this Agreement and each of the Transaction Documents
to which it is a 

 



\- 57 -

    

 party and the consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby or
thereby have been duly and validly authorized by all necessary action on the
part of Parent, and no other proceedings on the part of Parent are necessary
to authorize the execution, delivery or performance of this Agreement and the
applicable Transaction Documents and (IV) this Agreement and each of the
Transaction Documents to which it is a party have been duly and validly
executed and delivered by Parent and, assuming the due authorization,
execution and delivery by the other parties hereto and thereto, constitute a
valid, legal and binding agreement of Parent, enforceable against Parent in
accordance with its terms, subject to the General Enforceability Exceptions.

ordinary course immediately following the Closing, including Cash and Cash
Equivalents posted as margin in respect of coffee futures. For the avoidance
of doubt, the term "consultation with Buyer" shall not provide Buyer any
consent or control right over the actions of the Company described in this
Section 6.19.

 

(b) Seller shall manage the Companys portfolio of coffee hedges and futures
between the date hereof and Closing in consultation with Buyer and in a
manner that preserves the inherent value to the Company of such coffee hedges

solely and exclusively to their constitutional officer position and not to any
position of employment); and

any of them as a result of or arising out of (i) any breach by Buyer of any of
its covenants or agreements contained herein or (ii) any Liabilities to the
extent relating to or arising out of the businesses of, or ownership of, the
Company (other than in respect of obligations of the Seller Indemnitees under
this Agreement or any Transaction Document).

_Notice of Claims; Third Party Claims_. 

---|---|--- 
 

(a) If any person or entity entitled to indemnification pursuant to _Section_
__ _ 9.2_ hereof (an " _Indemnified Party_ ") (i) receives notice of any
claim, action, suit or proceeding by a third party other than a Tax Contest
(which shall be governed by _Section_ __ _ 10.5(f)_) (a " _Third Party Claim_
") or (ii) sustains any Loss not involving a Third Party Claim, in each case
which such Indemnified Party reasonably believes may give rise to a claim for
indemnification from a Responsible Party hereunder and if such Indemnified
Party intends to seek indemnity with respect thereto under this _ARTICLE IX_
, such Indemnified Party shall promptly notify the party obligated to
indemnify such Indemnified Party (or, in the case of a Buyer Indemnitee
seeking indemnification, such Buyer Indemnitee shall promptly notify Seller)
(such notified party, the " _Responsible Party_ ") in writing in reasonable
detail of such claims; _provided_ that the failure to so notify shall not
relieve the Responsible Party of its obligations hereunder, except to the
extent that the Responsible Party is actually prejudiced thereby.

(b) The Responsible Party will be entitled, by notice delivered to the
Indemnified Party within 30 days of the receipt of notice of any Third Party
Claim, to contest, defend, litigate or settle any Third Party Claim. The
Indemnified Party shall have the right to participate in (but not control),
and to be represented by counsel (at its own expense) in any such contest,
defense, litigation or settlement conducted by the Responsible Party.

 



\- 63 -

    

(c) The Responsible Party, if it shall have assumed the defense of any Third
Party Claim as provided in this Agreement, shall (i) conduct the defense of
such Third Party Claim with reasonable diligence and keep the Indemnified
Party reasonably informed of material developments in the Third Party Claim
that materially affect the Indemnified Party and (ii) not consent to a
settlement of, or the entry of any judgment arising from, any such Third Party
Claim without the prior written consent of the Indemnified Party (which
consent shall not be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed);
_provided_ , _however_ , that the Responsible Party may, without the prior
written consent of the Indemnified Party, consent to such a settlement or
entry of judgment to the extent it (x) includes an unconditional release of
the Indemnified Party of all liability (including, for the avoidance of doubt,
any monetary damages or injunctive relief) with respect to such Third Party
Claim and (y) does not involve any finding or admission of any violation of
Law or admission of any wrongdoing by any Indemnified Party.

(d) If an Indemnified Party is entitled to indemnification against a Third
Party Claim, and the Responsible Party fails to accept a tender of, or assume
the defense of, a Third Party Claim pursuant to this _Section_ __ _ 9.3_, the
Indemnified Party shall have the right, without prejudice to its right of
indemnification hereunder, in its discretion exercised in good faith, to
contest, defend and litigate such Third Party Claim, and (with the prior
written consent of the Responsible Party, not to be unreasonably withheld,
conditioned or delayed) may settle such Third Party Claim either before or
after the initiation of litigation, at such time and upon such terms as the
Indemnified Party deems fair and reasonable, _provided_ , _however_ , __ that
prior to any such settlement, written notice of its intention to settle is
given to the Responsible Party and the Responsible Party gives its prior
written consent to the Indemnified Party (which consent shall not be
unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed). 

(e) Any Indemnified Party shall cooperate in all reasonable respects with the
Responsible Party and its attorneys in the investigation, trial and defense
of any Third Party Claim and any appeal arising therefrom and shall furnish
such records, information and testimony, and attend such conferences,
discovery proceedings, hearings, trials and appeals, as may be reasonably
requested in connection therewith. Such cooperation shall include access
during normal business hours afforded to the Responsible Party and its agents
and representatives to, and reasonable retention by the Indemnified Party of,
records and information which have been identified by the Responsible Party
as being reasonably relevant to such Third Party Claim, and making employees
available on a mutually convenient basis to provide additional information and
explanation of any material provided hereunder. The parties shall cooperate
with each other in any notifications to insurers.

(f) Each Indemnified Party shall use commercially reasonable efforts to
mitigate any Loss upon becoming aware of any event which would reasonably be
expected to, or does, give rise thereto.

 

(g) The parties agree that the provisions in this Agreement relating to
indemnification, and the limits imposed on Buyer Indemnitees or Seller
Indemnitee remedies with respect to this Agreement and the transactions
contemplated hereby, were specifically bargained for between sophisticated
parties (after consultation with their advisors) and were specifically taken
into account in the determination of the amounts to be paid to Seller
hereunder.

 



\- 64 -

    

(h) In the event of any conflict between this Section 9.3 and Section
10.5(f), Section 10.5(f) shall control.



     | 9.4 |

_Limitations on Indemnification Obligations_. 

---|---|--- 
 

(a) The amount of any Losses for which the Buyer Indemnitees may be entitled
to indemnification pursuant to the provisions of  _Section_ __ _ 9.2(a)_
will be determined net of the amount of any Losses to the extent such Losses
were included as a liability in the calculation of Net Working Capital.

 

(b) To the extent permitted by applicable Law, in no event shall Seller or any
of its Affiliates, on the one hand, or Buyer or any of its Affiliates, on the
other hand, be liable to Buyer or any Buyer Indemnitee or Seller or any Seller
Indemnitee, as applicable, for, and the definition of "Losses" shall exclude,
any (i) punitive damages; or (ii) any indirect, special or consequential
losses that are not a reasonably foreseeable result of the matter giving rise
to a claim for indemnification hereunder, in each case unless any such damages
are of a third party and are actually assessed against an Indemnified Party
in a valid Third Party Claim for which indemnification is available hereunder.
Other than with respect to any valid Third Party Claim, this limitation shall
apply regardless of whether any Litigation, claim or demand seeking
or related to any of the foregoing damages is based on breach of contract,
breach of warranty, tort or otherwise, and shall apply even where such damages
(or the events giving rise to such damages) are caused, in whole or in part,
by the negligence, gross negligence or acts and omissions of Seller or Buyer
or any of their respective Affiliates. This _Section_ __ _ 9.4(b)_ shall
survive termination or cancellation of this Agreement.

 

(c) The amount of any and all Losses indemnified pursuant to _Section_ __ _
9.2_ will be (i) determined net of an amount equal to any Tax savings or
benefits actually realized in cash for the taxable year in which such Losses
are incurred or for any taxable year ending before the date on which the
indemnification payment is made pursuant to this _Article IX _ by the
Indemnified Party, in each case, that is attributable to any deduction, loss,
credit or other Tax saving or benefit resulting from or arising out of such
Losses, provided that the Responsible Party shall pay to the Indemnified Party
an amount equal to any such Tax benefit (plus any penalties, interest or
other charges imposed by the relevant Governmental Authority) in the event
such Tax benefit is disallowed and (ii) increased by any Taxes or reduction in
refund (including any interest with respect thereto) of any Indemnified Party
resulting from or arising out of the receipt of any payment pursuant to
_Section_ __ _ 9.2_.

 

(d) The amount of any and all Losses will be determined net of (A) any
liabilities to the extent included as a deduction in the calculation of the
Final Statement of Purchase Price with respect to the matters to which such
Losses relate, and (B) any amounts to the extent actually recovered by the
Buyer Indemnitees net of any costs of recovery.

 



     | 9.5 |

_Adjustments to Purchase Price_. 

---|---|--- 
 

Unless otherwise required by applicable Law, all payments made pursuant to
this _ARTICLE IX_ or _Section_ __ _ 2.3(e)_ shall be treated as an
adjustment to the Purchase Price hereunder for all purposes (including federal
income Tax purposes).

Agreement and the transactions contemplated hereby.

 



     | 10.5 |

_Tax Matters_. 

---|---|--- 
 

(a) _Tax Cooperation_. Seller and Buyer agree to furnish or cause to be
furnished to each other, upon request, as promptly as practicable, such
information (including access to books and records) and assistance relating to
the Company as is reasonably requested for the filing of any Tax Returns and
the preparation, prosecution, defense or conduct of any Tax Contests or other
audit, investigation, claim or proceeding relating to Taxes. Seller and Buyer
shall reasonably cooperate with each other in the conduct of any Third Party
Claim or other audit, investigation, claim or proceeding involving or
otherwise relating to the Company (or the income or assets of the Company)
with respect to any Tax. Any information obtained under this _Section_ __ _
10.5(a)_ shall

 



\- 67 -

    

 be kept confidential, except as may be otherwise necessary in connection
with the filing of Tax Returns or in the conduct of a Third Party Claim or
other audit, investigation, claim or proceeding relating to Taxes.
Notwithstanding the foregoing provisions of this _Section_ __ _ 10.5(a)_,
neither Seller nor Buyer will be required to provide any consolidated U.S.
federal income (or analogous state or local) Tax Returns (or portion
thereof), except to the extent such Tax Return (or portion thereof) relates to
the Company.

(b) _Tax Returns_.

 

(i) Seller will prepare and file, or cause to be prepared and filed, any U.S.
federal (and analogous state and local) consolidated, combined or unitary Tax
Returns for any groups that include both (A) the Seller or a member of the
Seller Group and (B) the Company. Seller shall be responsible for and shall
timely pay all Taxes due and payable (including as a result of any audit or
other Tax proceeding) with respect to any Tax Returns described in the
preceding sentence. Seller and the Buyer acknowledge and agree that,
consistent with Treasury Regulations Section 1.1502-76(b)(1)(ii)(A)( _1_ ),
the Company shall cease to be a member of the affiliated group of corporations
of which Seller is the common parent for purposes of filing a consolidated
U.S. federal income Tax Return at the end of the day on the Closing Date.

(ii) Except as otherwise provided in  _Section_ __ _ 10.5(b)(i)_, Buyer will
prepare and file, or cause to be prepared and filed, all Tax Returns of the
Company required to be filed on or after the Closing Date. Until such time as
the Actual Adjustment has been finally determined under _Section_ __ _
2.3(d)_, (a) all such Tax Returns that relate to a Pre-Closing Tax Period or a
Straddle Period shall, solely to the extent that any position
reflected thereon could affect the Actual Adjustment, be prepared and filed
in a manner consistent with past practices except to the extent otherwise
required by Law, (b) Buyer shall provide any such Tax Returns that relate to a
Pre-Closing Tax Period or Straddle Period to Seller for its review at least 30
days (or, in the case of Tax Returns due within 30 days after the Closing
Date, at least 10 days) prior to the date such Tax Return is required to be
filed (taking into account any extensions) and (c) Buyer shall consider in
good faith any reasonable comments made by Seller with respect to any Pre-
Closing Tax Periods (including the relevant portion of any Straddle Periods)
reflected thereon.

(c) _Transfer Taxes_. Notwithstanding any provision of this Agreement to the
contrary, one half of all Transfer Taxes imposed upon the purchase and sale of
the Shares shall be paid by Buyer, and one half by Seller. Buyer shall, at its
own expense, file or cause the Company to file all necessary Tax Returns and
other documentation with respect to all such Transfer Taxes; _provided_ that
if Seller is required to file any such Tax Return under applicable Law, then
Seller shall, at its own expense, file such Tax Return. Buyer and Seller will
reasonably cooperate with one another in the preparation and filing of such
Tax Returns and to minimize or eliminate any Transfer Taxes. For purposes of
this Agreement, " _Transfer Taxes_ " shall mean transfer, documentary, sales,
use, registration and other such Taxes (including all applicable real estate
transfer Taxes).

(d) _Post-Closing Actions_. Buyer covenants that, except as contemplated by
this Agreement, it (i) shall not and shall not cause or permit the Company to
(A) make or file an election to carry back any losses to any Pre-Closing Tax
Period for U.S. federal (or applicable state) income Tax purposes, or (B)
take any action on the Closing Date after the Closing outside the ordinary
course of business, and (ii) shall cause the Company to make and/or join with
Seller in the making of any Tax elections requested by Seller if the making
of such election does not have an adverse impact on Buyer or any of its
Affiliates (including, after the Closing, the Company).

 



\- 68 -

    

(e) _Tax Sharing_ _Agreements_. Effective as of the Closing, any and all
tax sharing or allocation agreements or arrangements to which the Company is
a party (other than any Commercial Tax Agreements or agreements or
arrangements between the Company and a party other than a member of the Seller
Group) shall be terminated such that none of Buyer or the Company shall have
any further liability thereunder.

(f) _Tax Contests_. Buyer and the Company, on the one hand, and Seller, on
the other hand, shall promptly notify each other upon receipt by such party of
written notice of any inquiries, claims, assessments, audits, proceedings or
similar events involving a Governmental Authority with respect to any U.S.
federal (or analogous state or local) consolidated, combined or unitary Tax
Return (or Taxes relating thereto) of the Company and one or more members of
the Seller Group (any such inquiry, claim, assessment, audit, proceeding or
similar event, a " _Tax Contest_ "). Any failure to so notify the other party
of any Tax Contest shall not relieve such other party of any liability with
respect to such Tax Contest. Seller shall have control of the conduct of all
Tax Contests, including any settlement or compromise thereof; _provided_ that
the Buyer shall be permitted to participate, with counsel of its own choice
and at its own expense, in the defense of any Tax Contest to the extent
permitted by applicable Law and the applicable Governmental Authority. This
Section 10.5(f) shall control in lieu of Section 9.3 to the extent of any
conflict between them. For the avoidance of doubt, Buyer shall have the
exclusive right to control all inquiries, claims, assessments, audits,
proceedings or similar events involving a Governmental Authority with respect
to any Taxes of the Company other than any Tax Contest, insofar as Seller will
not be liable to indemnify Buyer with respect to any such matters.

representation or warranty made in or connection with this Agreement or as
an inducement to enter into this Agreement) shall be governed by, and
enforced in accordance with, the internal laws of the State of New York,

conflict of law provision or rule (whether of the State of New York or any
other jurisdiction).

_Assignment; Successors and Assigns; No Third Party Rights_. 

---|---|--- 
 

Except as otherwise provided herein, this Agreement may not, without the prior
written consent of the other parties hereto, be assigned by operation of Law
or otherwise, and any attempted assignment without such consent shall be null
and void; provided that Buyer may collaterally assign its rights hereunder to
any lender or debt financing source without the consent of any other
party, but no such assignment will relieve Buyer of its obligations
hereunder. Subject to the foregoing, this Agreement shall be binding upon and
inure to the benefit of the parties hereto and their respective heirs,
successors and permitted assigns. Except as set forth in _Sections 6.6_ ,
_9.2_ and _10.16_ and _10.20_ hereof, this Agreement shall be for the sole
benefit of the parties to this Agreement and their respective heirs,
successors and permitted assigns and is not intended, nor shall be construed,
to give any Person, other than the parties hereto and their respective heirs,
successors and assigns, any legal or equitable right, remedy or claim
hereunder.

_Counterparts_. 

---|---|---

the parties hereto, each of which shall be deemed an original and all of
which together will constitute one and the same instrument. Delivery of an
executed counterpart of a signature page to this Agreement by facsimile or
portable document format shall be effective as delivery of an executed
counterpart to this Agreement.



     | 10.9 |

_Electronic Delivery_. 

---|---|--- 
 

This Agreement and any signed agreement or instrument entered into in
connection with this Agreement, and any amendments hereto or thereto, to the
extent delivered by means of a telecopier machine or electronic mail (any such
delivery, an " _Electronic Delivery_ "), will be treated in all manner and
respects as an original agreement or instrument and will be considered to
have the same binding legal effect as if it were the original signed version
thereof delivered in person. At the reasonable request of any party to this
Agreement or to any such other agreement or instrument, each other party or
thereto will re-execute original forms thereof and deliver them to all other
parties. No party to any such agreement or instrument will raise the use of
Electronic Delivery to deliver a signature or the fact that any signature or
agreement or instrument was transmitted or communicated through the use of
Electronic Delivery as a defense to the formation of a contract, and each such
party forever waives any such defense, except to the extent such defense
related to lack of authenticity.



     | 10.10 |

---|---|--- 
 

The titles, captions, headings and table of contents in this Agreement are for

The invalidity of any portion hereof shall not affect the validity, force or
effect of the remaining portions hereof. If it is ever held that any
restriction hereunder is too broad to permit enforcement of such restriction
to its fullest extent, such restriction shall be enforced to the maximum
extent permitted by Law.

 



\- 70 -

         | 10.13 |

_Exclusive Remedy_. 

---|---|--- 
 

The parties hereto acknowledge and agree that, notwithstanding anything to the
contrary in this Agreement, from and after the Closing, except (a) as set
forth in _Section_ __ _ 10.14_, (b) in the case of Fraud, (c) for any
recourse of the Buyer Indemnitees to the insurer under the RandW Insurance
Policy and (d) as expressly provided in this Agreement and the other
Transaction Documents, the indemnification provisions of ARTICLE IX shall be
the sole and exclusive remedies of Seller and Buyer, respectively, and their
respective Affiliates, for any losses, liabilities, claims, fines,
deficiencies, damages, Taxes, payments, penalties and reasonable attorneys
and accountants fees and disbursements (including any such losses,
liabilities, claims, fines, deficiencies, damages, Taxes, payments, penalties
and attorneys and accountants fees and disbursements from claims for breach
of contract, warranty, tortious conduct (including negligence) and whether
predicated on common law, statute, strict liability, or otherwise) that each
party (or its Affiliates) may at any time suffer or incur, or become subject
to, as a result of or in connection with this Agreement, the Transaction
Documents or the other transactions contemplated by this Agreement or the
other Transaction Documents.

 



     | 10.14 |

_Specific Performance_. 

---|---|--- 
 

(a) Each of the parties hereto acknowledges that the rights of each party to
consummate the transactions contemplated hereby are unique and recognize and
affirm that in the event of a breach of this Agreement by any party, money
damages may be inadequate and the non-breaching party would be irreparably
damaged and may have no adequate remedy at Law. Accordingly, the parties
agree that such non-breaching party shall have the right, in addition to any
other rights and remedies existing in its favor at Law or in equity, to
enforce its rights and the other partys obligations hereunder not only by an
action or actions for damages but also by an action or actions for specific
performance, temporary, preliminary, and permanent injunctive and/or other
equitable relief to prevent breaches or threatened breaches of any of the
provisions of this Agreement and, subject to _Section_ __ _ 10.14(b)_, to
cause Buyer to consummate the transactions contemplated by this Agreement and
to cause Buyer to fund and pay all amounts required to be paid by Buyer under
this Agreement at the Closing and in connection with the consummation of the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement; _provided_ under no circumstances
shall Seller or the Company be permitted or entitled to receive both a grant
of specific performance resulting in the consummation of the transactions
contemplated hereby and the payment of the Buyer Termination Fee (or monetary
damages of any kind). Each party to this Agreement hereby waives the defense
in any such suit that the other parties to this Agreement have an adequate
remedy at law, and hereby waives any requirement to post any bond in
connection with obtaining such relief.

 

(b) Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the contrary, the parties
agree that Seller shall be entitled to specific performance of Buyers
obligation to cause the Cash Equity to be funded and to effect the Closing, if
and only if (i) all conditions in _Sections 7.1_ and _7.2_ have been satisfied
or waived by Buyer (other than those conditions that by their nature are to
be satisfied at the Closing but subject to the satisfaction of such conditions
at such time), (ii) Buyer has failed to consummate the Closing in breach of
_Section_ __ _ 2.2_, (iii) Seller has irrevocably confirmed in writing to
Buyer that when specific performance is granted and the Cash Equity and Debt
Financing are funded, the Closing will occur pursuant to _Section_ __ _ 2.2_
and (iv) the proceeds of the Debt Financing are available to Buyer (or will
be available at the Closing if the Cash Equity is funded at the Closing) on
the terms set forth in the Debt Commitment Letter.

arising therefrom or relating thereto.

(b) Each of Buyer and the Company, for itself and the Waiving Parties, hereby
irrevocably acknowledges and agrees that all communications between the Seller
Group and their counsel, including Drinker Biddle, made in connection with the
negotiation, preparation, execution, delivery and performance under, or any
dispute or proceeding arising out of or relating to, this Agreement, any
agreements contemplated by this Agreement or the transactions contemplated
hereby or thereby, or any matter relating to any of the foregoing (including,
for the avoidance of doubt, all of the client files and records in the
possession of Drinker Biddle related thereto), shall be deemed to be attorney-
client privileged communications between the Seller Group and such counsel
that belong to the Seller Group and the attorney-client privilege and the
expectation of client confidence belongs to, and shall be controlled by, the
Seller Group and will not pass to or be claimed by Buyer, the Company or any
of the Waiving Parties. From and after the Closing, each of Buyer and the
Company, on behalf of itself and the Waiving Parties, waives and will not
assert any attorney-client privilege with respect to any communication between
Drinker Biddle and the Company or any Person in the Seller Group occurring
during the Current Representation.

(c) None of Buyer, the Company or any of the Waiving Parties or any
Person purporting to act on behalf of or through Buyer, the Company or any of
the Waiving Parties, will access or seek to obtain access to any such
communications, or to the files of Drinker Biddle relating to the Current
Representation, in each case with the intent to compromise the attorney-
client privilege of such communications or files. Drinker Biddle shall not
have any duty whatsoever to reveal or disclose any such attorney-client
communications or files to any of Buyer, the Company or any of the Waiving
Parties by reason of any attorney-client relationship between Drinker Biddle
and the Company or otherwise..

(d) This  _Section_ __ _ 10.16_ is intended for the benefit of, and shall be
enforceable by, Drinker Biddle. This _Section_ __ _ 10.16_ shall be
irrevocable, and no term of this _Section_ __ _ 10.16_ may be amended,
waived or modified without the prior written consent of Drinker Biddle.

_Mutual Drafting; Certain Understandings_. 

---|---|--- 
 

Each of the parties is a sophisticated legal entity or Person that was advised
by experienced counsel and, to the extent it deemed necessary, other advisors
in connection with this Agreement. The parties hereto have been represented by
counsel who have carefully negotiated the provisions hereof. As a consequence,
the parties do not intend that the presumptions of any Laws or rules 

 



\- 73 -

    

 relating to the interpretation of contracts against the drafter of any
particular clause should be applied to this Agreement and therefore waive
their effects. The language used in this Agreement will be deemed to be the
language chosen by the parties to express their mutual intent, and no rule of
strict construction will be applied against any Person. The parties agree that
prior drafts of this Agreement and the documents referred to herein will be
deemed not to provide any evidence as to the meaning of any provision hereof
or the intent of the parties with respect hereto and that such drafts will be
deemed joint work product of the parties. The parties have voluntarily agreed
to define their rights, liabilities and obligations respecting the
transactions contemplated hereby exclusively in contract pursuant to the
express terms and provisions of this Agreement; and the parties expressly
disclaim that they are owed any duties or are entitled to any remedies not
expressly set forth in this Agreement. The parties agree and acknowledge that
to the extent any terms and provisions of this Agreement are in any way
inconsistent with or in conflict with any term, condition or provision of any
other agreement, document or instrument contemplated hereby, this Agreement
will govern and control.



     | 10.18 |

_Failure or Indulgence Not Waiver_. 

---|---|--- 
 

No failure or delay on the part of any party hereto in the exercise of any
right hereunder shall impair such right or be construed to be waiver of, or
acquiescence in, any breach of any representation, warranty or agreement
herein, nor shall any single or partial exercise of any such right preclude
any other or further exercise thereof or any other right. No waiver of any of
the provisions of this Agreement shall be deemed to or shall constitute a
waiver of any other provision hereof (whether or not similar). All rights and
remedies existing under this Agreement are cumulative to, and not exclusive
of, any rights or remedies otherwise available.



     | 10.19 |

_Amendments_. 

---|---|--- 
 

This Agreement may be amended, modified and supplemented by a written
instrument authorized and executed on behalf of the parties hereto at
any time with respect to any of the terms contained herein; _provided_ that
any of the terms or provisions of this Agreement may be waived in writing at
any time by the party that is entitled to the benefits of such waived terms or
provisions.

 



     | 10.20 |

_Financing Parties_. 

---|---|--- 
 

Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the contrary, each party hereto,

or in equity, whether in contract or in tort or otherwise, involving the
Financing Parties, arising out of or relating to the Financing or any of the
agreements entered into in connection with the Financing or any of the
transactions contemplated hereby or thereby or the performance of any services
thereunder shall be subject to the exclusive jurisdiction of any federal or
state court in the Borough of Manhattan, New York, New York, so long as such
forum is and remains available, and any appellate court thereof and each party
hereto irrevocably submits itself and its property with respect to any such
proceeding to the exclusive jurisdiction of such court, (b) agrees that any
such proceeding shall be governed by the laws of the State of New York
(without giving effect to any conflicts of law principles that would result in
the application of the laws of another state), except as otherwise provided
in any agreement relating to the Financing, (c) agrees not to bring or support
or permit any of its controlled Affiliates to bring or

 



\- 74 -

    

 support any proceeding of any kind or description, whether in law or in
equity, whether in contract or in tort or otherwise, against any Financing
Party in any way arising out of or relating to the Financing, the Commitment
Letters or any of the transactions contemplated hereby or thereby or the
performance of any services thereunder in any forum other than any federal or
state court in the Borough of Manhattan, New York, New York, (d) irrevocably
waives, to the fullest extent that it may effectively do so, the defense of an
inconvenient forum to the maintenance of such proceeding in any such court,
(e) knowingly, intentionally and voluntarily waives to the fullest extent
permitted by applicable law trial by jury in any proceeding brought against
the Financing Parties in any way arising out of or relating to the Financing,
the Commitment Letters or any of the transactions contemplated hereby or
thereby or the performance of any services thereunder, (f) agrees that,
subject to the rights of the Buyer under the Debt Commitment Letters, none of
the Financing Parties will have any liability to any of the parties hereto,
and none of the parties hereto, nor any of their respective Affiliates shall
have any rights, claims or causes of action against any of the Financing
Parties, relating to or arising out of this Agreement, the Financing or any of
the transactions contemplated hereby or thereby or the performance of any
services thereunder, whether in law or in equity, whether in contract or in
tort or otherwise, and any such claims, rights and causes of action are
waived, disclaimed and released in full, and (g) agrees that the Financing
Parties are express third party beneficiaries of, and may enforce, any of the
provisions of this Section _ 10.20_, and that such provisions and the related
definitions, including the definition of "Financing Parties" shall not be
amended in any manner adverse to the Financing Parties without the prior
written consent of the Financing Entities.
