Cash, (ii) the Closing Indebtedness, (iii) the Seller Transaction Expenses,

the definitions under this Agreement, together with reasonable documentation
supporting such calculations. After delivery of the Purchase Price Adjustment

relevant periods of review described in this _Section 2.5_, Buyer shall
provide Seller and their respective representatives with reasonable access
(including by electronic delivery of documents), during regular business hours
and in such a manner as to not interfere with the normal operation of the
business of the Company, to relevant documents, schedules, work papers and

Statement to the extent required in connection with Sellers review of the
Purchase Price Adjustment Statement.

 



 

(b) If Seller disagrees with Buyers determination of one or more of the items
set forth on the Purchase Price Adjustment Statement, Seller shall notify
Buyer in writing (an " _Objection Notice_ ") of such disagreement within sixty
(60) days after delivery of the Purchase Price Adjustment Statement to Seller,

delivery of the Objection Notice, Seller may not introduce additional Disputed
Items or increase the amount of any Disputed Item, and any item set forth on
the Purchase Price Adjustment Statement not identified as a Disputed Item
pursuant to a timely Objection Notice will be final and binding upon the
parties hereto for all purposes of this Agreement. During the relevant periods
of review described in this _Section 2.5_, Seller shall provide Buyer and its
representatives with reasonable access (including by electronic delivery of
documents), during regular business hours and in such a manner as to not
interfere with the normal operation of the business of Seller and its

(A) agrees to the Purchase Price Adjustment Statement, or (B) fails to deliver

Purchase Price Adjustment Statement, then the Purchase Price Adjustment
Statement and the Closing Net Working Capital Adjustment Amount, Closing
Indebtedness, Closing Cash and Seller Transaction Expenses set forth therein,
shall be final and binding upon the parties hereto for all purposes of this
Agreement.

 



 

(c) Buyer and Seller shall negotiate in good faith to resolve any Disputed
Item (and all such discussions related thereto shall be governed by Rule 408
of the Federal Rules of Evidence (as in effect as of the date of this
Agreement) and any applicable similar state rule) and any such resolution
agreed to in writing by Buyer and Seller shall be final and binding upon the
parties hereto for all purposes of this Agreement. If Buyer and Seller are
unable to resolve any Disputed Item within thirty (30) days of delivery of the
Objection Notice, then such remaining Disputed Items shall be referred for
final and binding determination to the dispute resolution group of one of the
nationally-recognized, independent public accounting firms listed on _Schedule
2.5(d)_ (the " _Accounting Arbitrator_ ") within fifteen (15) days
thereafter. If such firm is unable or unwilling to serve, Buyer and Seller
shall jointly select an Accounting Arbitrator from an accounting firm of
national standing that is not the independent auditor of Buyer or Seller. If
Buyer and Seller cannot agree on an accounting firm within fifteen (15)
calendar days, then Seller and/or Buyer may submit a written request to the
American Arbitration Association requesting appointment of a nationally
recognized independent certified public accounting firm to serve as the
Accounting Arbitrator. The Accounting Arbitrator shall act as an expert and
not an arbitrator and shall resolve only the Disputed Items submitted to it in
accordance with this _Section 2.5_ by delivering, as promptly as practicable
and in any event within sixty (60) days after its appointment, a written
report setting forth its resolution of any such Disputed Items determined in
accordance with the terms herein. In preparing its report, the Accounting
Arbitrator shall not assign a value to any Disputed Item greater than the
greatest value submitted by either Buyer or Seller or less than the smallest
value submitted by either Buyer or Seller in respect of such Disputed Item.
The Accounting Arbitrator shall make its determination based solely on
presentations and supporting materials provided by the parties (with
substantially simultaneous delivery to the other party) and in accordance with
the guidelines and procedures set forth in this Agreement and not pursuant to
any independent review. Neither Buyer nor Seller nor their respective
representatives shall have any ex parte communications with the Accounting
Arbitrator. Such report shall be final and binding upon the parties hereto for
all purposes of this Agreement. Upon the written agreement of Buyer and Seller
or the decision of the Accounting Arbitrator or if Seller fails to deliver an
Objection Notice to Buyer within the thirty (30) day period provided in
_Section 2.5(b)_, the Purchase Price Adjustment Statement and the items set
forth therein, as adjusted if necessary pursuant to the terms of this _Section
2.5_, shall be deemed to be final and binding on the parties hereto for all
purposes of this Agreement. The fees, costs and expenses of the Accounting
Arbitrator shall be allocated between Buyer and Seller equally such that Buyer
shall bear fifty percent (50%) of all such fees, costs and expenses and Seller
shall bear fifty percent (50%) of all such fees, costs and expenses. Except as
provided in the preceding sentence, all other costs and expenses incurred by
the Parties in connection with resolving any dispute hereunder before the
Accounting Arbitrator shall be borne by the Party incurring such cost and
expense. Buyer and Seller agree that the procedures set forth in this Section
2.5 for resolving disputes with respect to the Purchase Price Adjustment
Statement shall be the sole and exclusive method for resolving any such
disputes; _provided_ that this provision

 



      
 

 



 

shall not prohibit either Party from instituting litigation to enforce any
final determination of the Closing Purchase Price by the Accounting Arbitrator
pursuant to this Section 2.5(c) or to compel any Party to submit any dispute
arising in connection with this Section 2.5(c) to the Accounting Arbitrator
pursuant to and in accordance with the terms and conditions set forth in this
Section 2.5(c), in each case, in any court of competent jurisdiction in
accordance with Section 11.10, but, for the avoidance of doubt, the substance
of the Accounting Arbitrators determination shall not be subject to review or
appeal.

 



 

(d) The Closing Cash, Closing Indebtedness, Seller Transaction Expenses and
the Closing Net Working Capital Adjustment Amount as finally determined
pursuant to this _Section 2.5_ are the " _Final Closing Cash_ ", " _Final
Closing Indebtedness_ ", " _Final Seller Transaction Expenses_ " and " _Final
Net Working Capital Adjustment Amount_ " for all purposes of this Agreement.
The " _Final Purchase Price_ " means (i) $500,000,000, _plus_ (ii) the Final
Closing Cash, _minus_ (iii) the Final Closing Indebtedness, _minus_ (iv) the
Final Seller Transaction Expenses, _plus_ (v) the Final Net Working Capital
Adjustment Amount (which may be a negative number). .

 



 

(e) Within three (3) Business Days of the final and binding determination of
the Final Purchase Price pursuant to this _Section 2.5_:

 



 

(i) if the Estimated Purchase Price is greater than the Final Purchase Price,
Seller shall pay to Buyer an amount of cash equal to such difference by wire
transfer of immediately available funds to the account(s) designated in
writing by Buyer at least two (2) Business Days prior to such payment; or

 



 

(ii) if the Final Purchase Price is greater than the Estimated Purchase Price,
Buyer shall pay to Seller an aggregate amount of cash equal to the value of
such difference by wire transfer of immediately available funds to the
account(s) designated in writing by Seller at least two (2) Business Days
prior to such payment.

 



 

(f) Seller and Buyer agree to treat any payment made pursuant to this _Section
2.5_ as an adjustment to the purchase price for U.S. federal income tax
purposes, except as otherwise required by applicable Law. Except as a result
of the Sellers failure to provide a certificate under _Section 8.1(e)_ or
relating to compensation paid by Buyer or any Newspaper Sub, Buyer is not
aware as of the date hereof of any Law that would require Taxes to be deducted
or withheld from payments made pursuant to this Agreement. Nevertheless, Buyer
and the Newspaper Subs shall be entitled to deduct or withhold Taxes from
payments made pursuant to this Agreement to the extent required to do so by
Law. If Buyer becomes aware of a Law that would require Buyer to deduct or
withhold Taxes from any payment to be made by Buyer to Seller pursuant to this
Agreement, Buyer shall promptly inform Seller of its intention to withhold
and, to the extent requested by Seller, reasonably cooperate with Seller to
mitigate such withholding to the extent permitted by applicable Law. Any
deducted or withheld Taxes shall be remitted to the applicable Governmental
Authority in accordance with applicable Law and to the extent remitted shall
be deemed delivered and paid to the Person in respect of which such deduction
and withholding was made.

 



      
 

 



 

2.6. _Purchase Price Allocation_.

 



 

(a) Within ninety (90) days after the Closing Date, Buyer shall prepare and
deliver to Seller a written allocation (the " _Tax Allocation Statement_ ") of
the purchase price (as determined for U.S. federal income tax purposes) among
the assets treated for U.S. federal income tax purposes as being acquired by
Buyer pursuant to this Agreement in accordance with Section 1060 of the Code.
If Seller disagrees with the Tax Allocation Statement, Seller shall notify
Buyer in writing of such disagreement within thirty (30) days after Buyers
delivery of the Tax Allocation Statement. Buyer and Seller shall negotiate in
good faith to resolve any such disagreement and shall amend the Tax Allocation
Statement to reflect any resolution agreed to in writing.

 



 

(b) Buyer and Seller shall work together in good faith to amend the Tax
Allocation Statement to the extent necessary to reflect any post-Closing
adjustments to the purchase price (as determined for U.S. federal income tax
purposes).

 



 

(c) Any disagreement described in _Section 2.6(a)_ or regarding any amendment
described in _Section 2.6(b)_ that Buyer and Seller are unable to resolve
through good faith negotiations shall be submitted to the Accounting
Arbitrator for resolution in a manner similar to that described in _Section
2.5(c)_, subject to such deadlines as may be mutually agreed among the Parties
and the Accounting Arbitrator, and the Tax Allocation Statement shall be
amended to reflect the Accounting Arbitrators resolution of any such
disagreements.

 



 

(d) Buyer and Seller shall and shall cause their respective Affiliates to (i)
file all Tax Returns (including IRS Form 8594 and any amendments thereto
necessitated by any adjustment described in _Section 2.6(b)_) in a manner
consistent with the Tax Allocation Statement (including any amendments thereto
pursuant to this _Section 2.6_), and (ii) take no position that is

following financial statements (the " _Financial Statements_ "): (i) the
unaudited balance sheet (the " _Most Recent Unaudited Balance Sheet_ ") of
each Newspaper Sub as of December 31, 2017 (the

 



      
 

 



 

" _Balance Sheet Date_ "), (ii) the unaudited balance sheet of each Newspaper
Sub as of December 25, 2016, (iii) the related statements of operations
(collectively with the Most Recent Unaudited Balance Sheet, the " _Most Recent
Unaudited Financial Statements_ ") for the fiscal years ended December 31,
2017 and December 25, 2016. Each of the Financial Statements have been
prepared in accordance with GAAP applied on a consistent basis throughout the
periods covered thereby and fairly present in all material respects the
financial condition of the Newspaper Subs, as applicable, as of the respective
dates thereof or with respect to the periods then ended, subject, in each
case, to the absence of footnote disclosure and to normal, recurring end-of-
period adjustments, none of which are reasonably expected to be material in
amount or significance in any individual case or in the aggregate.

 



 

(b) _Accounting Controls_. The Financial Statements have been derived from the
books and records of the Newspaper Subs and Seller and its Subsidiaries have
devised and maintained a system of internal accounting controls sufficient to
provide reasonable assurance that (i) transactions are executed in accordance
with the general or specific authorization of management of the Newspaper
Subs, (ii) transactions are recorded as necessary to permit the preparation of
financial statements in accordance with GAAP, (iii) access to the property or
assets of the Newspaper Subs is permitted only in accordance with the general
or specific authorization of management of the Newspaper Subs, as applicable,
and (iv) the recorded accountability for items is compared with the actual
levels at reasonable intervals and appropriate action is taken with respect to
any differences. Except as set forth in _Section 4.6(b)_ of the Disclosure

notified in writing of any significant deficiency or material weakness in the
system of internal accounting controls utilized by the Newspaper Subs.

involved (i) the financial position of the Company, and (ii) all transactions
of the Company, including all transactions between the Company, on the one
hand, and the Seller or any of its Subsidiaries, on the other hand. Since the
Applicable Date Seller has not received any advice or notification from its
independent accountants that Seller or any of its Subsidiaries has used any
improper accounting practice that would have the effect of not reflecting or
incorrectly reflecting in the books and records of the Company any properties,
assets, Liabilities, revenues, expenses, equity accounts or other accounts.

 



 

(d) _No Undisclosed Liabilities_. Except as reflected or reserved against in
the Most Recent Unaudited Balance Sheet or as set forth in _Section 4.6(d)_

(accrued, contingent or otherwise) that would be required to be set forth on a
balance sheet prepared in accordance with GAAP or the notes thereto, except
for (i) Liabilities that may have arisen since the date of the Most Recent
Unaudited Balance Sheet in the ordinary course of business consistent with
past practice, and (ii) Liabilities arising under the executory portion of a
Contract (excluding Liabilities for breach, non-performance or default). The
Company is not a party to any "off-balance-sheet arrangements" (as defined in
Item 303(a) of Regulation S-K under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as
amended)), where the result, purpose or intended effect of such is to avoid
disclosure

Newspaper Sub or with respect to the Business or any Transferred Asset, which
waiver or extension remains in effect. All Tax deficiencies which have been
proposed, asserted or assessed against any Newspaper Sub or with respect to
the Business or any Transferred Asset have been fully paid or finally settled.
In the last three (3) years, the Company has not received a notice of a claim
by any Taxing Authority in any jurisdiction where Tax Returns are not filed by

product lines or assets.

 



 

6.3. _Covenants Regarding Employee Matters_.

 



 

(a) Prior to the Closing Date, Seller shall transfer the employment of each
Business Employee to a Newspaper Sub or its Subsidiaries (to the extent such
Business Employees are not currently employed by a Newspaper Sub or its
Subsidiaries) and shall transfer the employment of each Excluded Employee to
Seller or its Affiliates other than a Newspaper Sub and its Subsidiaries
provided that as Seller deems necessary and consistent with this Agreement,
Buyer and Seller shall confer in good faith and mutually agree to such
transfers. To the extent mutually agreed by Buyer and Seller, on or prior to
the Closing Date, effective as of the Closing Date, Buyer shall have the
right, but not the obligation to, or cause one of its Affiliates (including
the Company) to, offer employment in connection with the Business to employees
of Seller or one of its Affiliates or Subsidiaries (other than employees of
the Company) who are based in California or Washington D.C. and primarily
perform services for the Business (the " _Offered Employees_ ") and Seller
shall cooperate with Buyer in making this offer of employment and shall use
its reasonable best efforts to facilitate the Offered Employees accepting such
offer of post-Closing employment with Buyer or one of its Affiliates or
Subsidiaries. The Offered Employees who accept Buyers offer of employment
and commence employment, together with each of the Business Employees of the
Company as of the Closing Date, shall be considered " _Transferred Employees_
" as of the Closing Date. For a period beginning on the Closing Date and
ending on the first anniversary of the Closing Date (the " _Continuation
Period_ "), each Transferred Employee shall, while employed by Buyer or one of
its Subsidiaries (including the Company), be entitled to receive (A) at least
the same base salary, wages and bonus opportunities in the aggregate as the
base salary, wages and bonus opportunities in the aggregate that were provided
to such Transferred Employee immediately prior to the Closing and (B) other
employee benefits (excluding equity-based compensation, retiree medical and
other retiree welfare benefits and defined benefits) that are substantially
comparable in the aggregate to those employee benefits (excluding equity-based
compensation, retiree medical and other retiree welfare benefits and defined
benefits) provided to such Transferred Employee by the Company immediately
prior to the Closing. To the extent any Transferred Employee is terminated in
a severance qualifying termination during the Continuation Period, Buyer or
the Company shall provide each such Transferred Employee with severance pay
pursuant to the applicable severance plan or policy that is set forth on
Section 4.17(a) of the Disclosure Schedule (the " _Severance Plan_ ") that is
no less than the severance pay that would have been payable under the
applicable Severance Plan in effect for such Business Employee immediately
prior to the Closing Date. During the Continuation Period, Buyer shall take
such actions as are necessary to provide to each Business Employee represented
by a labor union with compensation and benefits and other terms and conditions
of employment that are required to comply with the terms of all applicable
labor contracts and applicable Law. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary
in this Section 6.3, Buyer shall not be obligated to continue to employ any
Transferred Employee for any specified period of time following the Closing
Date (except as required by applicable Law or collective bargaining
agreement).

 



      
 

 



 

(b) On and after the Closing Date, Seller shall assume or retain, as
applicable, full responsibility and liability for offering and providing
"continuation coverage" to all "covered employees" other than Transferred
Employees or former Employees who primarily performed services for the
Business and any "qualified beneficiary" related to such employee, who is
covered by a "group health plan," and who experiences a "qualifying event" on
or prior to the Closing. "Continuation coverage," "covered employee,"
"qualified beneficiary," "qualifying event" and "group health plan" all shall
have the meanings given such terms under Section 4980B of the Code and Section
601 _et_ _seq_. of ERISA. On and after the Closing Date, Buyer shall assume
full responsibility and liability for offering and providing "continuation
coverage" to all "covered employees" who are Transferred Employees or former
Employees who primarily performed services for the Business, and any
"qualified beneficiary" related to such employee, who is covered by a "group
health plan," and who experiences a "qualifying event" on or prior to the
Closing. "Continuation coverage," "covered employee," "qualified beneficiary,"
"qualifying event" and "group health plan" all shall have the meanings given
such terms under Section 4980B of the Code and Section 601 et seq. of ERISA.

 



 

(c) Except as provided otherwise under Section 6.3, Seller shall retain all
Liability with respect to (i) each Seller Plan and (ii) any current Employee
who does not become a Transferred Employee.

 



 

(d) Buyer shall be responsible for providing short-term disability benefits to
any Transferred Employees who are disabled as of the Closing, where such
individual would otherwise be eligible for such short-term disability benefits
under the Plans in effect immediately prior to the Closing.

 



 

(e) All workers compensation Liabilities relating to, arising out of or
resulting from any claim by a Transferred Employee or a former Employee who
primarily performed services for the Business that relates to a period prior
to the Closing shall be assumed by Buyer. Buyer shall also assume and be
solely responsible for workers compensation liabilities owed to Transferred
Employees to the extent relating to, arising out of or resulting from a
compensable injury that occurs after the Closing. For purposes of this
Agreement, a compensable injury shall be deemed to be sustained upon the
occurrence of an event or onset of an occupational disease giving rise to
eligibility for workers compensation benefits. Buyer and Seller shall
cooperate with respect to any notification to appropriate Governmental
Authorities of the disposition and the issuance of new, or the transfer of
existing, workers compensation insurance policies and claims handling
contracts.

 



 

(f) Seller shall be responsible for providing or causing to be provided long-
term disability benefits to each Transferred Employee who is receiving such
benefits under a Plan that is not an Assumed Plan as of the Closing Date or
has sustained an injury or illness on or prior to the Closing which will
qualify such Transferred Employee for long-term disability benefits at the end
of the applicable six-month exclusion period under a Plan that is not an
Assumed Plan. Buyer shall be responsible for providing or causing to be
provided long-term disability benefits under the terms of Buyers long term
disability program to each Transferred Employee who sustains an injury or
illness after Closing which will qualify such Business Employee for long-term
disability benefits under the applicable Buyers program.

 



      
 

 



 

(g) Seller shall be solely responsible for any and all Liabilities, penalties,
fines or other sanctions that may be assessed or otherwise due under the
Worker Adjustment and Retraining and Notification Act and similar laws and
regulations arising out of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement
relating to employees or former employees of Seller, the Company and/or the
Transferred Employees, which Liabilities shall be "Excluded Liabilities."
Buyer shall not take any actions during the ninety (90) day period following
the Closing Date which would cause any Liabilities, penalties, fines or other
sanctions to be assessed or otherwise due under the Worker Adjustment and
Retraining and Notification Act and similar laws and regulations for which
Seller may be responsible.

 



 

(h) This _Section 6.3_ shall operate exclusively for the benefit of the
parties to this Agreement and not for the benefit of any other Person,
including, without limitation, any current, former or retired employee of
Seller or Buyer or spouse or dependents of such Persons. Nothing in this
_Section 6.3_ shall (i) be treated as an amendment of, or undertaking to
amend, any employee benefit plan (including any Plan) or (ii) prohibit Buyer
or any of its Affiliates from amending or terminating any employee benefit
plan (including any Plan) following the Closing Date.

 



 

6.4. _Certain Tax Matters_.

 



 

(a) _Tax Returns_.

 



 

(i) Seller, at its sole cost and expense, shall prepare and timely file (or
caused to be prepared and timely filed) all Tax Returns of the Newspaper Subs
due (after taking into account valid extensions) prior to the Closing Date in
a manner consistent with past practice and applicable Law, and shall timely
pay (or cause to be timely paid) all Seller Taxes due and owing in connection
therewith.

 



 

(ii) Buyer shall prepare and timely file (or cause to be prepared and timely
filed), in a manner consistent with past practice and applicable Law, all Tax
Returns of the Newspaper Subs for Straddle Periods or taxable periods ending
on or prior to the Closing Date that are due after the Closing Date (after
taking into account valid extensions). Buyer shall use commercially reasonable
efforts to provide Seller with copies of each such Tax Return at least ten
(10) Business Days prior to the date for filing thereof for Sellers review
and comment. Buyer shall consider in good faith any reasonable comments timely
provided by Seller regarding any such Tax Return. Seller shall pay to the
Person required to file such Tax Return all Seller Taxes that are due and
owing in connection with such Tax Return, along with any reasonable out-of-
pocket costs incurred in connection with the preparation and filing of such
Tax Return that are attributable to Seller Taxes, at least two (2) Business
Days before the filing date for such Tax Return, and such Person shall timely
file (or cause to be filed) such Tax Return and timely pay (or cause to be
paid) such Taxes. Notwithstanding the foregoing, if the Newspaper Subs do not
employ after Closing personnel familiar with the preparation and filing of any
such Tax Returns (or as agreed to by the parties after the Closing), then
Seller shall prepare any such Tax Return in a manner consistent with past
practice and applicable Law.

 



      
 

 



 

(iii) Except to the extent required by Law, without the prior written consent
of Seller (which shall not be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed),
Buyer shall not, and shall not allow any Newspaper Sub to:

 



 

(A) amend any Tax Return of any Newspaper Sub for a Pre-Closing Tax Period;

 



 

(B) make any election with respect to the Newspaper Sub that could affect any
Seller Tax (other than any such election that is consistent with past practice
of the Newspaper Sub prior to the Closing Date);

 



 

(C) allow any Newspaper Sub to pursue a voluntary disclosure agreement or
engage in a similar process with respect to any Tax for a Pre-Closing Tax
Period;

 



 

(D) agree to extend the applicable statute of limitations for any Tax that
could be a Seller Tax; or

 



 

(E) file a letter ruling or advance determination with respect to a Seller
Tax.

 



 

(iv) Buyer shall not engage, or allow any Newspaper Sub to engage in any
transaction on the Closing Date, but after the Closing, that is outside of the
ordinary course of business and could result in a Seller Tax.

 



 

(b) _Straddle Period Allocations_. For purposes of this Agreement, any Taxes
for any Straddle Period of any Newspaper Sub or with respect to the Business
or any Transferred Asset shall be apportioned between the portion of such
Straddle Period ending as of the end of the Closing Date and the portion of
the Straddle Period beginning as of the day after the Closing Date as follows:
(i) any such property, ad valorem and similar Taxes shall be apportioned based
on the relative number of days in each such portion of such Straddle Period,
and (ii) any such Taxes not described in clause (i) above shall be apportioned
by means of an interim closing of the books as of the end of the Closing Date.

 



 

(c) _Cooperation on Tax Matters_. Subject to _Section 6.4(a)_, Buyer and
Seller shall cooperate fully, as and to the extent reasonably requested by any
party hereto, in connection with (i) the filing of Tax Returns pursuant to
this _Section 6.4_, (ii) any other Tax Returns required to be filed in
connection with the Contemplated Transactions, and (iii) any Tax Contests.
Such cooperation shall include the retention and (upon the other partys
request) the provision of records and information which are reasonably
relevant to any such Tax Return or Tax Contest and making employees available
on a mutually convenient basis to provide additional information and
explanation of any material provided hereunder. Buyer and Seller agree (A) to
retain all books and records with respect to Tax matters pertinent to any
Newspaper Sub, any Transferred Asset or the Business relating to any taxable
period beginning before the Closing Date until the expiration of the statute
of limitations (and, to the extent notified by Buyer or Seller, any extensions
thereof) of the respective taxable periods, and to abide by all record
retention agreements entered into with any Taxing Authority, and (B) to give
the other party reasonable written notice prior to transferring, destroying or
discarding any such books and

 



      
 

 



 

records and, if the other party so requests, Buyer or Seller, as the case may
be, shall allow the other party to take possession of such books and records.

 



 

(d) _Transfer Taxes_. Seller and Buyer shall each be responsible for and pay
50% of all Transfer Taxes. Seller shall timely prepare, at its own expense,
all Tax Returns and other documentation required to be filed with respect to
all such Transfer Taxes and shall promptly provide a draft copy of such Tax
Returns and other documentation to Buyer prior to the due date for such Tax
Returns for Buyers review and comment. Seller shall timely file, at its own
expense, or cause to be filed, all such Tax Returns and other documentation,
and Buyer shall reasonably cooperate with Seller as may be necessary to
effectuate such filings.

 



 

(e) _Tax Refunds_. To the extent that Buyer or any of its Affiliates
(including any Newspaper Sub) receives a refund of Seller Taxes after Closing
(whether as a cash payment or a dollar-for-dollar credit against Taxes due and
owing for a taxable period (or portion thereof) beginning after the Closing
Date), Buyer shall pay to Seller the amount of such refund, less any out-of-
pocket costs, expenses and Taxes incurred in connection with the receipt
thereof, within ten (10) days of receipt (or, if in the form of a credit,
within ten (10) days of using the credit); _provided_ , _however_ , that Buyer
shall not be obligated to make any such payment to the extent such refund or
credit (i) arises out of a carryback of an item from a taxable period (or
portion thereof) beginning after the Closing Date or (ii) is specifically
included in the determination of the Closing Net Working Capital. Buyer shall
use commercially reasonable efforts to cooperate (and cause its Affiliates
(including the Newspaper Subs)) to pursue a refund of Seller Taxes, to the
extent requested by Seller and at the cost and expense of Seller, that will
give rise to a payment to Seller under this _Section 6.4(e)_.

 



 

(f) _Deferred Revenue_. Buyer and Seller hereby acknowledge and agree that
Seller is not making any actual or deemed payment to Buyer in respect of any
deferred revenue or prepaid income in connection with the Contemplated
Transactions, and as a result Buyer shall not be treated as recognizing any
income with respect to any amount of deferred revenue or prepaid income
received or accrued by Seller or any of its Affiliates (including for this
purpose the Newspaper Subs) prior to the Closing. Buyer and Seller shall and
shall cause their Affiliates to report the Contemplated Transactions for U.S.
federal (and applicable state and local) income tax purposes in a manner
consistent with this _Section 6.4(f)_.

 



 

6.5. _Restrictive Covenants_.

 



 

(a) _Seller Confidentiality_. Following the Closing, the Seller shall, and
shall cause its Affiliates, agents and representatives other than the Company
(each of the foregoing, collectively, " _Seller Related Parties_ ") to, (i)
maintain the confidentiality of, (ii) not use, and (iii) not divulge to any
Person, any Confidential Information, except with the prior written consent of
Buyer, or as may be required by applicable Law; _provided_ , that the Seller
and each Seller Related Party shall not be subject to such obligation of
confidentiality for information that (A) otherwise becomes lawfully available
to the Seller or Seller Related Party after the Closing Date on a non-
confidential basis from a third party who is not under an obligation of
confidentiality to Buyer or the Company, or (B) is or becomes generally
available to the public without breach of this Agreement by the Seller or
Seller Related Party. If Seller or any Seller Related Party shall be required
by applicable Law or similar legal process or requested by any Governmental

 



       
 

 



 

Authority to divulge any such Confidential Information, Seller or such Seller
Related Party shall provide Buyer with prompt written notice of each such
request (to the extent legally permissible) so that the Buyer may seek an
appropriate protective order or other appropriate remedy, and Seller or such
Seller Related Party shall cooperate with Buyer to obtain a protective order
or other remedy; _provided_ , that, in the event that a protective order or
other remedy is not obtained, Seller or such Seller Related Party shall
furnish only that portion of such information which, in the opinion of its
counsel, Seller or such Seller Related Party is legally compelled to disclose
and shall exercise its reasonable best efforts to obtain reliable assurance
that confidential treatment will be accorded any such information so
disclosed.

 



 

(b) _Buyer Confidentiality_. Buyer acknowledges that the information provided
to it in connection with this Agreement and the Contemplated Transactions is
subject to the terms of the confidentiality agreement between Buyer and Seller
dated February 1, 2018 (the " _Confidentiality Agreement_ "), the terms of
which are incorporated herein by reference. Effective upon, and only upon, the
Closing, the Confidentiality Agreement shall terminate.

 



 

(c) Seller acknowledges and agrees that the covenants and agreements set forth
in this _Section 6.5_ were a material inducement to Buyer to enter into this
Agreement and to perform its obligations hereunder, and that Buyer would not
obtain the benefit of the bargain set forth in this Agreement as specifically
negotiated by the parties hereto if Seller breached the provisions of this
_Section 6.5_. Therefore, Seller agrees, in further consideration of the
amounts to be paid hereunder for the NewCo Securities and the goodwill of the
Business sold by Seller, during the period beginning on the Closing Date and
ending on the three (3) year anniversary following the Closing Date (the "
_Restricted Period_ ") Seller shall not, and shall cause each of its
Affiliates not to, directly, or indirectly (i) induce or attempt to induce any
Employee to leave the employ of the Company, or in any way interfere with the
relationship between the Company and any Employee thereof or (ii) hire any
person who was an Employee of the Company at any time during the one (1) year
period immediately prior to the date on which such hiring would take place (it
being conclusively presumed by the parties so as to avoid any disputes under
this _Section 6.5(c)_ that any such hiring within such one (1) year period is
in violation of clause (A) above.

 



 

(d) If, at the time of enforcement of the covenants contained in _Section
6.5(a)_ or _Section 6.5(c)_ (the " _Restrictive Covenants_ "), a court of
competent jurisdiction shall hold that the duration, scope or area
restrictions stated herein are unreasonable under circumstances then existing,
the parties agree that the maximum duration, scope or area reasonable under
such circumstances shall be substituted for the stated duration, scope or area
and that the court shall be allowed and directed to revise the restrictions
contained herein to cover the maximum period, scope and area permitted by Law.
Seller has consulted with legal counsel regarding the Restrictive Covenants
and based on such consultation has determined and hereby acknowledges that the
Restrictive Covenants are reasonable in terms of duration, scope and area
restrictions and are necessary to protect the goodwill of the Business and the
substantial investment made by Buyer hereunder.

 



 

(e) In the event of any breach or violation by Seller or its Affiliates of any
of the Restrictive Covenants, the time period of such covenant shall be tolled
until such breach or violation is resolved.

 



      
 

 



 

6.6. _Access to Properties, Books and Records_.

 



 

(a) Subject to the Confidentiality Agreement, during the period from the date
hereof through the Closing Date, Seller shall, and Seller shall cause its
Subsidiaries to, give Buyer and its authorized representatives reasonable
access during regular business hours to all offices, Facilities, books and
records of the Company, the Business and the Transferred Assets as Buyer may
reasonably request, provided that (a) Buyer and its representatives shall take
such action as is deemed necessary in the reasonable judgment of Seller to
schedule such access and visits through a designated officer of Seller and in
such a way as to avoid disrupting in any material respect the normal operation
of the Business, (b) Seller shall not be required to take any action which
would constitute a waiver of the attorney-client or other privilege and (c)
Seller need not supply Buyer with any information which, in the reasonable
judgment of Seller after consulting with outside counsel, the Company is under
a contractual or legal obligation not to supply, provided that Seller will use
its reasonable best efforts to enable Buyer to have access to such
information.

 



 

(b) After the Closing Date, Buyer shall, and shall cause the Company and its
Subsidiaries to, until the seventh anniversary of the Closing Date, retain all
material books, records and other documents pertaining to the Business in
existence on the Closing Date and to make the same available for inspection
and copying by Seller (at Sellers expense) solely for bona fide reporting and
compliance purposes during normal business hours of the Company, upon
reasonable request and upon reasonable notice; _provided_ that the foregoing
right of inspection and copying shall not apply in connection with a
Proceeding in which Buyer and Seller are adverse to one another. No such
books, records or documents shall be destroyed after the seventh anniversary
of the Closing Date by Buyer or the Company without first advising Seller in
writing and giving Seller a reasonable opportunity to obtain possession
thereof.

 



 

6.7. _Public Announcements_. The initial and any subsequent press release or
other public announcement, if any, regarding this Agreement shall be made at
such time and in such form as Buyer and the Seller may agree. If the parties
cannot agree, each of Buyer, on the one hand, and the Seller, on the other
hand, shall be permitted to make any disclosure required by applicable Law or
securities exchange, so long as it is consistent with prior public disclosures
regarding this Agreement (assuming an initial press release has been jointly
agreed); _provided_ , that any party proposing to issue any press release or
similar public announcement or communication in compliance with any such
disclosure obligations shall use reasonable best efforts to consult in good
faith with the other parties hereto before doing so; _provided further_ that
nothing in this Section 6.7 shall be read to prohibit Seller or its board of
directors or any committee thereof from making any disclosure in the ordinary
course of business that does not relate to this Agreement or the Contemplated
Transactions (including with respect to a position contemplated by Rule
14e-2(a), Rule 14d-9 or Item 1012(a) of Regulation M-A promulgated under the
Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended).

 



 

6.8. _Release of Claims_.

 



 

(a) Effective as of the Closing, Seller, for and on behalf of itself and the
Seller and any and all of its successors and assigns, together with all
present and former directors and officers and Affiliates, and each of their
successors and assigns (the " _Seller Releasing Parties_ "),

 



      
 

 



 

hereby releases, acquits and forever discharges the Company and any and all of
its respective successors and assigns, together with all present and former
directors and officers and Affiliates (the " _Company Released Parties_ "),
from any and all manner of claims, actions, suits, damages, demands and
Liabilities whatsoever in Law or equity, whether known or unknown, liquidated
or unliquidated, fixed, contingent, direct or indirect, including under
Contracts between the Seller Releasing Parties and the Company Released
Parties (except to the extent any such Contracts remain in place following the
Closing), which the Seller Releasing Party ever had, has or may have against
any of the Company Released Parties for, upon, or by reason of any matter,
transaction, act, omission or thing whatsoever arising under or in connection
with any of the Company Released Parties, from the beginning of time to and
including the Closing Date (the foregoing, collectively, the " _Released
Claims_ "). Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, nothing contained
in this _Section 6.8_ shall operate to release, acquit or discharge any of
the obligations, covenants and agreements arising under (i) this Agreement,
the Ancillary Documents and the transactions contemplated hereby and thereby,
or (ii) the indemnification, exculpation and advancement of expenses
provisions set forth in the Organizational Documents of the Company as in
effect prior to the date hereof. In furtherance of the foregoing, Seller shall
not be entitled to contribution from, subrogation to or recovery against any
Company Released Party with respect to any Losses imposed on or incurred by
any of them in connection with this Agreement, any Ancillary Document or any
other or any document furnished pursuant hereto, whether by reason of the fact
that Seller is or was a stockholder employee, officer, director,
representative or agent of the Company or otherwise.

 



 

(b) Each of the Seller Releasing Parties acknowledges and agrees that the
Released Claims are general releases, and further expressly waives and assumes
the risk of any and all Released Claims that exist as of the date hereof but
that such Seller Releasing Party does not know or suspect to exist, whether
through ignorance, oversight, error, negligence or otherwise, and which, if
known, would materially affect such Seller Releasing Partys decision to enter
into this Agreement. Each of the Seller Releasing Parties hereby expressly
acknowledges that such Seller Releasing Party is familiar with the provisions
of California Civil Code Section 1542, which provides as follows:

 



 

A GENERAL RELEASE DOES NOT EXTEND TO CLAIMS WHICH THE CREDITOR DOES NOT KNOW
OR SUSPECT TO EXIST IN HIS OR HER FAVOR AT THE TIME OF EXECUTING THE RELEASE,
WHICH IF KNOWN BY HIM OR HER MUST HAVE MATERIALLY AFFECTED HIS OR HER
SETTLEMENT WITH THE DEBTOR.

 



 

To the extent that the provisions of California Civil Code Section 1542, as
well as the provisions of any and all comparable or similar statutes or
principles of Law of California or any other state or federal jurisdiction
might be deemed applicable, they are hereby expressly waived by each Seller
Releasing Party with the full knowledge and understanding of the consequences
and effect of such waiver.

 



 

(c) This _Section 6.8_ is intended for the benefit of and may be enforced
directly by each of the Company Released Parties, and shall be binding on all
successors and assigns of the Company and each Seller Releasing Party.

 



      
 

 



 

6.9. _Further Actions; Cooperation_. Subject to the other provisions of this
Agreement, which may impose additional or different obligations, Seller and
Buyer shall each use reasonable best efforts to take, or cause to be taken,
all appropriate actions and to do, or cause to be done, and to assist and
cooperate with the other party in doing, all things necessary, proper or
advisable to satisfy as soon as practicable all of the conditions required to
be satisfied by it hereunder and to consummate the transactions contemplated
hereby as expeditiously as possible. Subject to the other provisions of this
Agreement, Seller and Buyer further understand and agree that they shall not
take, or cause or permit to be taken, any action that is materially
inconsistent with the terms of this Agreement, nor shall a party take, or
cause or permit to be taken any action that might materially delay or hinder
the timely consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby.

 



 

6.10. _Notice of Developments; Investigation_. Prior to the Closing, Seller
shall promptly notify Buyer in writing of all Events arising subsequent to the
date hereof which could result in a breach of any of the representations,
warranties, covenants or agreements of Seller contained herein such that any
of the conditions contained in Article VII would not be satisfied. No
disclosure by Seller pursuant to this Section 6.10 shall be deemed (a) to
amend or supplement the schedules or exhibits attached hereto or the
representations and warranties contained in Article III or Article IV, (b) to
prevent or cure any misrepresentation or breach of warranty, (c) to affect in
any way the indemnification provided hereunder, or (d) to otherwise prejudice
any right or remedies of Buyer or the Buyer Indemnitees (any such effects, the
"Remedial Effects"). Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement, no
investigation of the Company and its Subsidiaries by Buyer or its
Representatives (or any knowledge of Buyer or its Representatives) prior to or
after the Closing Date shall have or be deemed to have any Remedial Effects.

 



 

6.11. _No-Shop_. Between the date hereof and the Closing Date, none Seller or
its Subsidiaries shall directly or indirectly (including by way of providing
information regarding the Company, the Business or the Transferred Assets to
any Person or providing access to any Person), (a) solicit any offer or
inquiry, or encourage or facilitate the solicitation of any offer or inquiry
relating to any potential Competing Transaction, (b) continue or engage in any
discussions or negotiations relating to any potential Competing Transaction,
or (c) enter into any agreement, arrangement or understanding relating to any
potential Competing Transaction. Seller shall promptly notify Buyer if any
such offers or inquiries or are received by, any such information is requested
from, or any such negotiations or discussions are sought to be initiated or
continued with, Seller or any of its Subsidiaries or any of their respective
representatives, including the nature and terms of any of the foregoing and
the identity of the parties involved.

 



 

6.12. _Mutual Release_.

 



 

(a) Effective as of the Closing, the Seller Releasing Parties hereby release,
acquits and forever discharge Buyer and any and all of its successors and
assigns, together with all present and former directors and officers and
Affiliates (the " _Buyer Released Parties_ "), from any and all manner of
claims, actions, suits, damages, demands and Liabilities whatsoever in Law or
equity, whether known or unknown, liquidated or unliquidated, fixed,
contingent, direct or indirect, including under Contracts between the Seller
Releasing Parties and the Buyer Released Parties (except to the extent any
such Contracts remain in place following the Closing), which the Seller
Releasing Party ever had, has or may have against any of the Buyer Released
Parties for, upon, or by reason of any matter, transaction, act, omission or
thing whatsoever

 



      
 

 



 

arising under or in connection with any of the Buyer Released Parties, from
the beginning of time to and including the Closing Date (the foregoing,
collectively, the " _Seller Released Claims_ "). Notwithstanding anything
herein to the contrary, nothing contained in this _Section 6.12_ shall
operate to release, acquit or discharge any of the obligations, covenants and
agreements arising under (i) this Agreement, the Ancillary Documents and the
transactions contemplated hereby and thereby or (ii) the indemnification,
exculpation and advancement of expenses provisions set forth in the
Organizational Documents of the Company as in effect prior to the date hereof
or in accordance with Section 6.13. In furtherance of the foregoing, Seller
shall not be entitled to contribution from, subrogation to or recovery against
any Seller Released Party with respect to any Losses imposed on or incurred by
any of them in connection with this Agreement, any Ancillary Document or any
other or any document furnished pursuant hereto, whether by reason of the fact
that Seller is or was an equityholder, employee, officer, director,
representative or agent of the Company or otherwise.

 



 

(b) Effective as of the Closing, Buyer and its Affiliates hereby release,
acquit and forever discharges Seller and any and all of its successors and
assigns, together with all present and former directors and officers and

equity, liquidated or unliquidated, fixed, contingent, direct or indirect,
including under Contracts between Buyer and any Seller Released Parties
(except to the extent any such Contracts remain in place following the
Closing), which the Buyer ever had, has or may have against any of the Seller
Released Parties for, upon, or by reason of any matter, transaction, act,
omission or thing whatsoever known to Buyer as of the date hereof arising
under or in connection with any of the Seller Released Parties, from the
beginning of time to and including the Closing Date (the foregoing,
collectively, the " _Buyer Released Claims_ "). Notwithstanding anything
herein to the contrary, nothing contained in this _Section 6.12_ shall
operate to release, acquit or discharge any of the obligations, covenants and
agreements arising under (i) this Agreement, the Ancillary Documents, the
Registration Rights Agreement and the transactions contemplated hereby and
thereby, (ii) the indemnification, exculpation and advancement of expenses
provisions set forth in the Organizational Documents of the Seller as in
effect prior to the date hereof (iii) any rights as a stockholder of the
Seller, other than rights to bring claims for events that occurred prior to
the date hereof or (iv) any matter, transaction, act, omission or thing which
is unknown to and which could not have reasonably been known by Buyer as of
the date of this Agreement. In furtherance of the foregoing, Buyer agrees to,
and to cause its Affiliates to, effective as of the Closing, (a) dismiss, with
prejudice, its and its Affiliates currently pending claims (i) for the
issuance of 333,000 shares of Seller common stock pursuant to Nant Term Sheet
and (ii) under Section 220 of the Delaware General Corporation Law with
respect to Seller and (b) terminate without liability to any party thereto the
Nant Term Sheet (and Seller hereby agrees to do the same, thereby terminating
the Nant Term Sheet by mutual agreement of the parties thereto). Buyer hereby
represents and warrants that except with respect to the claims set forth in
the preceding sentence, it is not aware of any claim, action, suit, damage,
demand, Loss or Liability for which any Seller Released Party or Seller
Releasing Party may be liable to any Buyer Released Party. In furtherance of
the foregoing, Buyer shall not be entitled to contribution from, subrogation
to or recovery against any Buyer Released Party with respect to any Losses
imposed on or incurred by any of them in connection with this Agreement, any
Ancillary Document or any other or any document furnished pursuant hereto,
whether by reason of the fact that Buyer is or was a stockholder of Seller or
otherwise.

 



      
 

 



 

(c) Each of the Seller Releasing Parties and Buyer and its Affiliates
acknowledges and agrees that the Seller Released Claims and the Buyer Released
Claims, as applicable, are general releases, and further expressly waives and
assumes the risk of any and all Seller Released Claims and Buyer Released
Claims, as applicable, that exist as of the date hereof but that such Seller
Releasing Party or Buyer or its Affiliate does not know or suspect to exist,
whether through ignorance, oversight, error, negligence or otherwise, and
which, if known, would materially affect such Seller Releasing Partys or
Buyers or its Affiliates decision to enter into this Agreement. Each of the
Seller Releasing Parties and Buyer and its Affiliates hereby expressly
acknowledges that such Person is familiar with the provisions of California
Civil Code Section 1542, which provides as follows:

 



 

A GENERAL RELEASE DOES NOT EXTEND TO CLAIMS WHICH THE CREDITOR DOES NOT KNOW
OR SUSPECT TO EXIST IN HIS OR HER FAVOR AT THE TIME OF EXECUTING THE RELEASE,
WHICH IF KNOWN BY HIM OR HER MUST HAVE MATERIALLY AFFECTED HIS OR HER
SETTLEMENT WITH THE DEBTOR.

 



 

To the extent that the provisions of California Civil Code Section 1542, as
well as the provisions of any and all comparable or similar statutes or
principles of Law of California or any other state or federal jurisdiction
might be deemed applicable, they are hereby expressly waived by each Seller
Releasing Party and Buyer and its Affiliates, as applicable, with the full
knowledge and understanding of the consequences and effect of such waiver.

 



 

(d) This _Section 6.12_ is intended for the benefit of and may be enforced
directly by each of the Buyer Released Parties and Seller Released Parties,
and shall be binding on all successors and assigns of Buyer, its Affiliates
and each Seller Releasing Party.

 



 

6.13. _D andO Insurance_.

 



 

(a) Buyer agrees that all rights to indemnification, exculpation and
advancement of expenses now existing in favor of the directors, managers,
officers, employees and agents of the Company, as provided in the Companys
Organizational Documents or otherwise in effect as of the date hereof with
respect to any matters occurring prior to the Closing, shall survive the
Contemplated Transactions and shall continue in full force and effect and that
the Company shall perform and discharge the Companys obligations to provide
such indemnity, exculpation and advancement. To the maximum extent permitted
by applicable Law, such indemnification shall be mandatory rather than
permissive, and the Company shall advance expenses in connection with such
indemnification as provided in the Companys Organizational Documents or other
applicable Contracts. The indemnification, advancement and liability
limitation or exculpation provisions of the Companys Organizational Documents
shall not be amended, repealed or otherwise modified after the Closing in any
manner that would adversely affect the rights thereunder of individuals who,
as of the Closing or at any time prior to the Closing, were directors,
managers, officers, employees or agents of the Company, unless such
modification is required by applicable Law.

 



 

(b) The Company shall purchase, prior to the Closing, 50% at Buyers cost and
expense and 50% at Sellers cost and expense, a "tail" policy providing
managers and

 



      
 

 



 

officers liability insurance coverage for the benefit of those Persons who
are covered by the Companys managers and officers liability insurance
policies as of the date hereof, for a period of six (6) years following the
Closing Date with respect to matters occurring prior to the Closing that is at
least equal to the coverage provided under the Companys current managers and
officers liability insurance policies; _provided_ that the Company may
substitute therefor policies of at least the same coverage containing terms
and conditions which are not, individually or in aggregate, materially less
advantageous to the beneficiaries thereof so long as such substitution does
not result in gaps or lapses in coverage with respect to matters occurring
prior to the Closing Date.

 



 

(c) The directors, managers, officers, employees and agents of the Company
entitled to the indemnification, liability limitation, exculpation and
insurance set forth in this _Section 6.13_ are intended to be third party
beneficiaries of this _Section 6.13_. This _Section 6.13 _shall survive the
consummation of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement and shall be
binding on all successors and assigns of the Company.

 



 

(d) If the Company or any of its successors or assigns (i) consolidates with
or merges into any other Person and shall not be the continuing or surviving
corporation or entity of such consolidation or merger, or (ii) transfers or
conveys all or substantially all of its properties and assets to any Person,
then, and in each such case, to the extent necessary, proper provision shall
be made so that the successors and assigns of the Company shall assume the
obligations set forth in this _Section 6.13_; _provided_ that the Company
shall not be relieved from such obligations.

 



 

6.14. _Insurance_. The parties acknowledge that insurance coverage applicable
to the Company and the Business for periods prior to Closing is maintained by
Seller and its Subsidiaries (other than the Company) and, except as otherwise
set forth herein, the insurance policies governing the Company and the
Business will remain with Seller and its Subsidiaries following Closing (the
policies for the benefit of the Company and the Business remaining with Seller
and its Subsidiaries, the " _Retained Policies_ "). Seller covenants and
agrees that (i) it shall maintain the Retained Policies that include coverage
on a claims-made basis with respect to occurrences affecting the Company or
the Business prior to the Closing Date, regardless of whether claims are
brought prior to or after the Closing Date (or if such policies are
terminated, substantially similar policies that are appropriate and customary
for a business such as Sellers and that contain similar claims-made coverage
to the extent reasonably available); (ii) prior to Closing, Seller shall give
notice to the insurers under the Retained Policies of each claim then pending
or, to the Knowledge of Seller, threatened with respect to any of the
Transferred Assets, the Company or the Business which Seller reasonably
expects to exceed the applicable deductible or other loss retention feature of
the Retained Policies; (iii) Buyer will, with respect to the Transferred
Assets, the Company and the Business, be provided full coverage under the
Retained Policies after the Closing in accordance with such policies (subject
to deductibles, self-insured retentions and policy limits thereof) on a
claims-made basis with respect to occurrences prior to the Closing, regardless
of whether claims are brought prior to or after the Closing; and (iv) Seller
shall use its reasonable best efforts to cause Buyer to be an "additional
named insured" under each Retained Policy and to ensure that Buyer will, in
such capacity, have the same coverage after the Closing under such insurance
on a claims-made basis with respect to occurrences prior to the Closing as
existed for the Transferred Assets, the Company and the Business prior to
Closing. Following the Closing Date, Buyer shall, and shall cause the

 



      
 

 



 

Company to, reasonably cooperate with respect to any claims made by Seller
with respect to the Transferred Assets, the Company or the Business prior to
the Closing.

 



 

6.15. _LA Times Foundation_. Seller shall use reasonable best efforts to
cause, as of the Closing Date, certain individuals designated by Buyer prior
to Closing to be elected to the board of directors of the LA Times Foundation
in lieu of existing directors identified by Buyer.

not be liable pursuant to _Section 9.2(a)(i)_ (except for claims in respect
of the Fundamental Representations) or _Section 9.2(a)(ii)_ with respect to
pre-Closing covenants (except for a breach of a pre-Closing covenant arising

including the first dollar of any Losses;

 



 

(ii) the Buyer Indemnitees shall not be entitled to recover and Seller shall

aggregate amount of Losses indemnifiable pursuant to _Section 9.2(a)(i)_
(except for claims in respect of the Fundamental Representations) or _Section
9.2(a)(ii)_ with respect to pre-Closing covenants (except for a breach of a

any Losses;

 



 

(iii) the amount recoverable by the Buyer Indemnitees for indemnification
pursuant to _Section 9.2(a)(i)_ (except for claims in respect of the

with or relating to Seller Taxes. Seller shall have no obligation to indemnify

Subject to Section 5.9 (No Reliance), Seller agrees and acknowledges that
nothing else in this Agreement (including this _Section 9.2_) shall limit or
restrict any of the Buyer Indemnitees rights to maintain or recover any

agreement of Buyer (or after the Closing, the Company) contained in this
Agreement and (iii) the Transferred Liabilities.

 



 

9.3. _Procedure_.

 



 

(a) Direct Claims.

 



 

(i) If either a Buyer Indemnitee, on the one hand, or a Seller Indemnitee, on
the other hand, (such claiming party, the " _Indemnitee_ ") shall have a claim
for indemnification hereunder other than in respect of a Third-Party Claim (a
" _Direct Claim_ "), the Indemnitee shall give written notice to the party
from whom indemnification is sought hereunder (the " _Indemnitor_ ") of the
nature and, to the extent practicable known and quantifiable, an estimate of
the amount of such Direct Claim and a reference to the provision(s) of this
Agreement pursuant to which indemnification is owned in respect of such Direct
Claim. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the failure to promptly notify the
Indemnitor shall not affect the Indemnitees right to receive indemnification
under _Section 9.2_ with respect to such Direct Claim, except to the extent
(and only to the extent that) the Indemnitor is actually prejudiced by such
failure. Following the delivery of a claim notice hereunder, the Indemnitee
shall use its reasonable best efforts to provide

 



      
 

 



 

written notice as soon as reasonably practicable to the Indemnitor of all
material developments relating to such Direct Claim and any material changes
to the Indemnitees good faith estimate of the amount of its Losses.

 



 

(ii) If the Indemnitor objects to such Direct Claim or the amount thereof, the
Indemnitor shall, within ten (10) Business Days after receipt of any notice of
a Direct Claim, deliver to the Indemnitee a written notice, noting, in
reasonable detail, its objection to the applicable Direct Claim and the nature
and basis for such objection. If an objection is not delivered by the
Indemnitor within such time, then the Indemnitor shall be deemed to have
acknowledged the Indemnitees right to indemnification in respect of such
Direct Claim. If an objection is delivered by the Indemnitor, indemnification
in respect of such Direct Claim shall become payable upon the earlier of (i)
the mutual written agreement of the Indemnitor and Indemnitee in respect of
the amount indemnifiable in respect of such Direct Claim pursuant to _Section
9.2_, and (ii) a final judgment of a court of competent jurisdiction with
respect to the amount indemnifiable in respect of such Direct Claim pursuant
to _Section 9.2_.

 



 

(b) Third-Party Actions (Other than Tax Contests).

 



 

(i) If an Indemnitee desires to seek indemnification pursuant to this _Section
9.2_ in respect of any Proceeding asserted by or involving a third party
(each, a " _Third-Party Claim_ "), the Indemnitee shall deliver to the
Indemnitor, promptly after receiving written notice of such Third-Party Claim,
a written notice describing, to the extent practicable, such Third-Party Claim
in reasonable detail and including a reference to the provision(s) of this
Agreement pursuant to which indemnification is owned in respect of such Third
Party Claim (a " _Third-Party Claim Notice_ "). Notwithstanding the foregoing,
the failure to promptly deliver a Third Party Claim Notice shall not affect
the Indemnitees right to receive indemnification under _Section 9.2_ with
respect to such Third-Party Claim, except to the extent the Indemnitor is
actually materially prejudiced by such failure. Following the delivery of a
Third-Party Claim Notice hereunder, the Indemnitee shall use reasonable best
efforts to provide written notice as soon as reasonably practicable to the
Indemnitor of all material developments relating to such Third-Party Claim and
any material changes to the Indemnitees good faith estimate of the amount of
its Losses.

 



 

(ii) The Indemnitor shall have the right, at its option, to assume the defense
of any Third-Party Claim with its own counsel, but only if the Indemnitor
simultaneously agrees to fully indemnify the Indemnitee for such Third-Party
Claim. However, Seller shall not have the option to assume the defense of any
such Third-Party Claim (i) which primarily seeks any remedy other than money
damages, (ii) which seeks money damages in an amount that exceeds the amount
for which Seller may be liable hereunder by virtue of the Cap, (iii) which
involves a Governmental Authority (other than a court of competent
jurisdiction or similar authority or (iv) which Third-Party Claim, or the
assumption by Seller of the defense of which Third-Party Claim, Buyer
reasonably determines (on advice of counsel) would reasonably be expected to
materially and adversely affect the continuing business operations of the
Company or any of its Affiliates or their relationships with customers,
clients, suppliers or other third parties

 



      
 

 



 

with whom the Company or any of its Affiliates has a material business
relationship (in which case the Company and/or Buyer shall control the defense
of such Third-Party Claim and Seller shall have the right to participate in
the defense of such Third-Party Claim at Sellers own cost and expense).

 



 

(iii) If the Indemnitor elects to assume the defense of any such Third-Party
Claim, then:

 



 

(A) The Indemnitee shall have the right to participate in the defense of such
Third-Party Claim and to employ its own counsel, at its own cost and expense,
and the Indemnitor shall not be required to pay or otherwise indemnify the
Indemnitee against any attorneys fees or other expenses incurred on behalf of
the Indemnitee in connection with such Third-Party Claim following the
Indemnitors election to assume the defense of such Third-Party Claim, unless
(A) the Indemnitor fails to defend diligently the Third-Party Claim within ten
(10) Business Days after receiving notice of such failure from the Indemnitee,
(B) the Indemnitee reasonably shall have concluded (upon advice of its
counsel) that there may be one or more legal or equitable defenses available
to such Indemnitee or other Indemnitees that are not available to the
Indemnitor, or (C) the Indemnitee shall reasonably conclude (upon advice of
its counsel) that, with respect to such Third-Party Claims, the Indemnitee and
the Indemnitor may have different, conflicting, or adverse legal positions or
interests.

 



 

(B) The Indemnitor shall not, without the prior written consent of the
Indemnitee, which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or
delayed, settle or compromise any pending or threatened Third-Party Claim in
respect of which indemnification may be sought hereunder (whether or not the
Indemnitee is an actual or potential party to such Third-Party Claim) or
consent to the entry of any judgment (A) which does not, to the extent that
the Indemnitee may have any Liability with respect to such Third-Party Claim,
include as an unconditional term thereof the delivery by the claimant or
plaintiff to the Indemnitee of a written release of the Indemnitee from all
Liability in respect of such Third-Party Claim, (B) which includes any
statement or admission of fact regarding culpability of, or a failure to act
by or on behalf of, the Indemnitee, or (C) in any manner that involves any
injunctive relief against the Indemnitee.

 



 

(iv) If the Indemnitor elects not to assume the defense of such Third-Party
Claim, or fails to notify the Indemnitee of its election to assume the defense
of such Third-Party Claim within thirty (30) days after receipt of written
notice of such Third-Party Claim, then the Indemnitee shall proceed diligently
to defend such Third-Party Claim with the assistance of counsel reasonably
satisfactory to the Indemnitor and shall be entitled to be reimbursed for all
reasonable costs, expenses and fees incurred by the Indemnitee in the defense
of such Third-Party Claim. The Indemnitee shall not settle or compromise such
Third-Party Claim without the prior written consent of the Indemnitor, which
consent shall not be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed.

 



      
 

 



 

(v) Regardless of which party assumes the defense of such Third-Party Claim,
the parties shall cooperate with one another in connection therewith. Such
cooperation shall include making available all books, records and other
documents and materials that are relevant to the defense of such Third-Party
Claim and making employees, officers and advisors available to provide
additional information or to act as a witness or respond to legal process.

 



 

(vi) The procedures in this _Section 9.3(b)_ shall not apply to Third-Party
Claims subject to _Section 9.3(c)_ (Tax Contests) or to Direct Claims by an
Indemnitee pursuant to _Section 9.3(a)_.

 



 

(c) Tax Contests.

 



 

(i) If, following the Closing Date, Buyer or the Company receives from any
Taxing Authority written notice of any Tax Contest relating to Seller Taxes,
Buyer shall provide a copy of such notice to Seller as soon as reasonably
practicable (and no later than ten (10) days after receipt); _provided_ , that
Buyers failure to so provide a copy of such notice to Seller shall not affect
any Buyer Indemnitees right to receive indemnification under _Section
9.2(a)_ except to the extent that Seller is actually materially prejudiced by
such failure.

 



 

(ii) Seller shall have the right, at its sole cost and expense, to control,
any Tax Contest described in _Section 9.2(c)(i)_ that relates solely to
Seller Taxes. To the extent a Tax Contest relates in part to Seller Taxes, if
reasonably practicable, the Buyer shall and shall cause the Company to use
reasonable best efforts to cooperate to split such Tax Contest into two Tax
Contests one of which relates solely to the Seller Taxes. Seller shall not
settle any such Tax Contest without the prior written consent of Buyer, which
consent shall not be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed. Seller
shall keep Buyer reasonably informed of the progress of any such Tax Contest
and shall provide copies of all material written communications with any
Taxing Authority related to such Tax Contest.

 



 

(iii) Seller shall have the right, at its sole cost and expense, to
participate in, but not control, any Tax Contest described in _Section
9.2(c)(i)_ that Seller does not control pursuant to _Section 9.3(c)(i)_ to
the extent such Tax Contest could result in Seller Taxes. Buyer shall not
settle, resolve, or abandon, or allow the Company to settle, resolve, or
abandon any such Tax Contest in a manner that results in a Seller Tax without
the consent of Seller, which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld,
conditioned or delayed. Buyer shall keep Seller reasonably informed of the
progress of such Tax Contest to the extent relating to Seller Taxes and shall
provide copies of all material written communications with any Taxing
Authority related to such Tax Contest to the extent relating to Seller Taxes.

 



 

9.4. _Other Provisions_.

 



 

(a) The parties agree that, in order to prevent duplicative recovery, no Buyer
Indemnitee shall be entitled to indemnification or to be held harmless under
this Agreement for

 



      
 

 



 

any Loss to the extent the amount of such Loss was specifically taken into
account in the determination of the Final Purchase Price.

 



 

(b) To the extent that the Indemnitor makes or is required to make any
indemnification payment to the Indemnitee, the Indemnitor shall be entitled to
exercise, and shall be subrogated to, any rights and remedies (including
rights of indemnity, rights of contribution and other rights of recovery) that
the Indemnitee may have against any other Person with respect to any Losses to
which such indemnification payment is directly related, so long as the
Indemnitee is not, and would not be reasonably likely to be, adversely
affected thereby. Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, the
Indemnitor shall not exercise or seek to exercise any such rights against any
customers, clients, suppliers or other third parties with whom the Company or
its Affiliates has a material business relationship.

 



 

(c) Following the Closing, except as otherwise set forth in an Ancillary
Document or in the case of criminal misconduct or fraud, the indemnification
provisions of this _Article IX_ shall be the sole and exclusive remedy of the
Indemnitees, whether in contract, tort or otherwise, for all matters arising
under or in connection with this Agreement, including, for any inaccuracy or
breach of any representation, warranty, covenant or agreement set forth
herein.

 



 

(d) The Buyer Indemnitees shall be entitled to (but shall not be required to)
set-off any amounts due or payable to any of the Buyer Indemnitees by Seller
pursuant to _Section 9.2_ against any amounts otherwise due and payable by
any of the Buyer Indemnitees to Seller.

 



 

(e) Any amount recoverable by a Buyer Indemnitee pursuant to _Section 9.2(a)_
or a Seller Indemnitee pursuant to _Section 9.2(c)_ shall include interest at
the Applicable Rate calculated on the basis of the actual number of days
elapsed from the date the applicable Loss is suffered or sustained to the date
of payment.

 



 

(f) To the extent, any Buyer Indemnitee seeks indemnification pursuant to
_Section 9.2(a)_ or any Seller Indemnitee seeks indemnification pursuant to
_Section 9.2(c)_, such Indemnitee shall use its reasonable best efforts to
mitigate any Loss related to such claim for indemnification.

 



 

(g) The parties hereto agree to treat any indemnity payment made pursuant to
this _Article IX_ as an adjustment to the purchase price for U.S. federal
income tax purposes, except as otherwise required by applicable Law.

 



 

(h) For purposes of determining a breach of a representation or warranty, or
the amount of any Loss in respect thereof, for which any Indemnitee is
entitled to indemnification under this Agreement, each representation or
warranty made by Seller or Buyer in this Agreement or in any schedules or
exhibits attached hereto or in any writing delivered by Seller or Buyer in
connection with this Agreement shall be read without giving effect to any
qualification that is based on materiality, including the words, "material",
"material adverse effect", "in all material respects" and other uses of the
word "material" (other than references to specific dollar amounts or in
respect of _Section 4.7_ (no Company Material Adverse Effect)).

 



      
 

 



 

(i) To the extent any claim may be recoverable pursuant to more than one
section of this Article IX, the Indemnitee may make such claim under any such
section in the alternative; _provided_ that any liability for indemnification
hereunder shall be determined without duplication of recovery by reason of
state of facts giving rise to such liability constituting a breach of more
than one representation, warranty, covenant or agreement.

 



 

ARTICLE X

 

 _Termination_

 



 

10.1. _Termination_. This Agreement may be terminated and the transactions
contemplated hereby may be abandoned:

 



 

(a) at any time, by mutual written agreement of Seller and Buyer;

 



 

(b) by Buyer, at any time prior to the Closing, if Seller is in breach of any
of the representations, warranties or covenants made by it in this Agreement,
which breach would result in the failure to satisfy any condition set forth in
_Section 7.1_ and in any such case such breach: (A) shall by its nature be
incapable of being cured; or (B) if capable of being cured, shall not have
been cured by the earlier of: (1) twenty (20) calendar days after written
notice thereof shall have been received by Seller; or (2) the End Date;
_provided_ , _however_ , that the right of Buyer to terminate pursuant to this
_Section 10.1(b)_ shall not be available if Buyer is then in material breach
of any representation, warranty, covenant, or obligation contained herein
which breach would result in the failure to satisfy any condition set forth in
_Section 7.2_;

 



 

(c) by Seller, at any time prior to the Closing, if Buyer is in breach of any
of the representations, warranties or covenants made by it in this Agreement,
which breach would result in the failure to satisfy any condition set forth in
_Section 7.2_ and in any such case such breach: (A) shall by its nature be
incapable of being cured; or (B) if capable of being cured, shall not have
been cured by the earlier of: (1) twenty (20) calendar days after written
notice thereof shall have been received by Buyer; or (2) the End Date;
_provided_ , _however_ , that the right of Seller to terminate pursuant to
this _Section 10.1(c)_ shall not be available if Seller is then in material
breach of any representation, warranty, covenant, or obligation contained
herein which breach would result in the failure to satisfy any condition set
forth in _Section 7.1_; or

 



 

(d) by written notice by either Seller or Buyer to the other party, at any
time after August 7, 2018 (the " _End Date_ ") if the Closing shall not have
occurred on or prior to such date; _provided_ that the right to terminate this
Agreement under this _Section 10.1(d)_ shall not be available to such party
if the action or inaction of such party or any of its Affiliates has been a
principal cause of or principally resulted in the failure of the Closing to
occur on or before the End Date and such action or failure to act constitutes
a breach of this Agreement.

 



 

10.2. _Procedure and Effect of Termination_. In the event of the termination
of this Agreement and the abandonment of the transactions contemplated hereby,
written notice thereof shall be given by a terminating party to the other
parties, and this Agreement shall terminate and the transactions contemplated
hereby shall be abandoned without further action by any of the

 



      
 

 



 

parties. In the event of termination of this Agreement as provided in this
Article X, this Agreement shall forthwith become null and void and no party
hereto shall have any obligation or Liability to the other parties hereto,
except (a) nothing herein shall relieve any party from Liability for any
breach of any representation, warranty, covenant or agreement in this
Agreement prior to the date of termination; (b) each Party shall be entitled
to any and all remedies at law and in equity for such breach and (c) this
Section 10.2, Section 6.5(a), Section 6.7 and Article XI of this Agreement
shall remain in full force and effect and survive any termination of this
Agreement.

 



 

ARTICLE XI _

11.3. _Governing Law_. This Agreement, together with the exhibits and
scheduled hereto, and all controversies arising out of or relating to the
foregoing shall in all respects be governed by, and construed in accordance
with, the Laws of the State of Delaware (excluding conflict of laws or choice
of laws rules and principles of the State of Delaware or any other
jurisdiction) applicable to agreements made and to be performed entirely
within such State, including all matters of construction, validity and
performance to the extent that such laws are not preempted by the laws of the
United States of America.

 



 

11.4. _Entire Agreement_. This Agreement, together with the exhibits hereto,
the Disclosure Schedule, the Ancillary Documents and the Confidentiality
Agreement, constitutes the entire agreement of the parties hereto concerning
the subject matter hereof and supersede all prior contracts or agreements,
whether oral or written relating to the subject matter hereof.

 



 

11.5. _Severability_. Should any provision of this Agreement or the
application thereof to any Person or circumstance be held invalid or
unenforceable to any extent: (a) such provision shall be ineffective to the
extent, and only to the extent, of such unenforceability or prohibition and
shall be enforced to the greatest extent permitted by Law, (b) such
unenforceability or prohibition in any jurisdiction shall not invalidate or

circumstances, or (ii) in any other jurisdiction, (c) such unenforceability or
prohibition shall not affect or invalidate any other provision of this
Agreement and (d) the parties shall negotiate in good faith to modify this
Agreement so as to effect the original intent of the parties as closely as
possible in a reasonable manner so that the transactions contemplated hereby
may be consummated as originally contemplated to the fullest extent possible.
Moreover, if any term or other provision of this Agreement shall be invalid,
illegal or incapable of being enforced by any rule of Law or public policy
because it is excessively broad as to duration, scope, activity or subject,
the parties intend that such provision shall be deemed modified to the minimum
degree necessary to make such provision valid and

 



       
 

 



 

enforceable under applicable Law and that such modified provision shall
thereafter be enforced to the fullest extent permitted under applicable Law.

 



 

11.6. _Amendment_. Neither this Agreement nor any of the terms hereof may be
terminated, amended, supplemented or modified orally, but only by an
instrument in writing signed by the parties hereto; _provided_ , that the

11.7. _Effect of Waiver or Consent_. No waiver or consent, express or implied,
by any party to or of any breach or default by any party in the performance by
such party of its obligations hereunder shall be deemed or construed to be a
consent or waiver to or of any other breach or default in the performance by
such party of the same or any other obligations of such party hereunder. No
single or partial exercise of any right or power, or any abandonment or
discontinuance of steps to enforce any right or power, shall preclude any
other or further exercise thereof or the exercise of any other right or power.
Failure on the part of a party to complain of any act of any party or to
declare any party in default, irrespective of how long such failure continues,
shall not constitute a waiver by such party of its rights hereunder until the
applicable statute of limitation period has run.

 



 

11.8. _Parties in Interest; Limitation on Rights of Others_. The terms of this
Agreement shall be binding upon, and inure to the benefit of, the parties
hereto and their respective successors and assigns. Nothing in this Agreement,
whether express or implied, shall be construed to give any Person (other than
the parties hereto and their respective successors and assigns and as
expressly provided herein) any legal or equitable right, remedy or claim under
or in respect of this Agreement or any covenants, conditions or provisions
contained herein, as a third party beneficiary or otherwise; _provided_ , that
(a) the Buyer Indemnitees and Seller Indemnitees that are not otherwise a
party to this Agreement shall be third party beneficiaries of this Agreement,
(b) the Seller Released Parties that are not otherwise a party to this
Agreement shall be third party beneficiaries of the provisions of _Section
6.8_ of this Agreement and (c) Section 6.13 shall confer third party
beneficiary rights to those Persons contemplated by such section.

 



 

11.9. _Assignability_. This Agreement shall not be assigned by Seller without
the prior written consent of Buyer. This Agreement shall not be assigned by
Buyer without the prior written consent of Seller; _provided_ , that Buyer may
(a) assign its rights and obligations under this Agreement without such
required consent to an Affiliate of Buyer, which assignment shall not relieve
Buyer of its obligations hereunder and (b) designate one or more of its
Affiliates to perform its obligations hereunder (in any or all of which cases,
Buyer nonetheless shall remain responsible for the performance of all of its
obligations hereunder).

 



 

11.10. _Jurisdiction; Court Proceedings; Waiver of Jury Trial_. ANY PROCEEDING
AGAINST ANY PARTY TO THIS AGREEMENT ARISING OUT OF OR IN ANY WAY RELATING TO
THIS AGREEMENT SHALL BE BROUGHT SOLELY IN ANY FEDERAL OR STATE COURT LOCATED
IN THE STATE OF DELAWARE IN NEW CASTLE COUNTY AND EACH OF THE PARTIES HERETO
SUBMITS TO THE EXCLUSIVE JURISDICTION OF SUCH COURTS FOR THE PURPOSE OF ANY
SUCH PROCEEDING;

 



      
 

 



 

 _PROVIDED_ THAT A FINAL JUDGMENT IN ANY SUCH PROCEEDING MAY BE ENFORCED IN
OTHER JURISDICTIONS BY SUIT ON THE JUDGMENT OR IN ANY OTHER MANNER PROVIDED BY
LAW. EACH PARTY HERETO IRREVOCABLY AND UNCONDITIONALLY AGREES NOT TO ASSERT
(A) ANY OBJECTION WHICH IT MAY EVER HAVE TO THE LAYING OF VENUE OF ANY SUCH
PROCEEDING IN ANY FEDERAL OR STATE COURT LOCATED IN THE STATE OF DELAWARE IN
NEW CASTLE COUNTY, (B) ANY CLAIM THAT ANY SUCH PROCEEDING BROUGHT IN ANY SUCH
COURT HAS BEEN BROUGHT IN AN INCONVENIENT FORUM, AND (C) ANY CLAIM THAT SUCH
COURT DOES NOT HAVE JURISDICTION WITH RESPECT TO SUCH PROCEEDING. EACH PARTY
HERETO AGREES THAT SERVICE OF PROCESS IN ANY PROCEEDING MAY BE MADE BY MAILING
A COPY THEREOF BY REGISTERED OR CERTIFIED MAIL OR BY OVERNIGHT COURIER
SERVICE, POSTAGE PREPAID, TO IT AT ITS ADDRESS FOR NOTICES PROVIDED FOR
HEREIN. NOTHING IN THIS AGREEMENT WILL AFFECT THE RIGHT OF ANY PARTY TO SERVE
PROCESS IN ANY OTHER MANNER PERMITTED BY LAW. EACH PARTY HERETO IRREVOCABLY
AND UNCONDITIONALLY WAIVES ANY RIGHT TO A TRIAL BY JURY AND AGREES THAT ANY OF
THEM MAY FILE A COPY OF THIS PARAGRAPH WITH ANY COURT AS WRITTEN EVIDENCE OF
THE KNOWING, VOLUNTARY AND BARGAINED-FOR AGREEMENT AMONG THE PARTIES
IRREVOCABLY TO WAIVE ITS RIGHT TO TRIAL BY JURY IN ANY PROCEEDING.

 



 

11.11. _Interpretation_. All references in this Agreement or the Ancillary
Documents to this Agreement shall include all exhibits and schedules hereto
and thereto to the same extent as though fully set forth herein.

 



 

11.12. _Reliance on Counsel and Other Advisors_. Each party has consulted such
legal, financial, technical or other expert as it deems necessary or desirable
before entering into this Agreement. Each party represents and warrants that
it has read, knows, understands and agrees with the terms and conditions of
this Agreement.

 



 

11.13. _Remedies_. All remedies, either under this Agreement or by Law or
otherwise afforded to the parties hereunder, shall be cumulative and not
alternative, and any Person having any rights under any provision of this
Agreement will be entitled to seek to enforce such rights specifically, to
recover damages by reason of any breach of this Agreement and to exercise all
other rights granted by Law, equity or otherwise (subject to the limitations
and procedures set forth in this Agreement). Notwithstanding anything to the
contrary provided elsewhere herein, in no event shall any Party (including
pursuant to Article IX) have any liability to the other Party (or its related
Indemnitees) for any punitive, incidental, consequential, exemplary, indirect
or special damages (including lost profits or loss of business reputation or
opportunity), except for consequential damages (including lost profits or loss
of business reputation or opportunity) that are the reasonably foreseeable
consequence of the applicable breach of this Agreement; provided that, in each
case, such limitation shall not limit recovery to the extent any such damages
(i) are the result of fraud or (ii) are payable to a third party as part of a
Third Party Claim that is indemnifiable pursuant to Article IX.

 



 

11.14. _Specific Performance_. The parties agree that irreparable damage would
occur in the event that any of the provisions of this Agreement were not
performed in accordance with

 



      
 

 



 

their specific terms or were otherwise breached. Accordingly, the parties
agree that, in addition to any other remedies, each party shall be entitled to
enforce the terms of this Agreement by a decree of specific performance
without the necessity of proving the inadequacy of money damages as a remedy
(which, for the avoidance of doubt, includes without limitation the right of
Seller to, or to cause Buyer to, enforce the funding under the Commitment
Letter). Each party hereby waives any requirement for the securing or posting
of any bond in connection with such remedy.

 



 

11.15. _Disclosure Schedules_. The Sections of the Disclosure Schedule have
been arranged, for purposes of convenience only, as separately titled Sections
of the Disclosure Schedule corresponding to the Sections of this Agreement.
The Disclosure Schedule is hereby incorporated into this Agreement to the same
extent as though fully set forth herein; _provided_ , that (a) the Disclosure
Schedule is qualified in its entirety by reference to specific provisions of
this Agreement and does not constitute, and shall not be deemed as
constituting, representations, warranties, or covenants of Seller, (b) any
fact or item which is disclosed on any Section of the Disclosure Schedule
shall be deemed disclosed on such other Section or Sections of the Disclosure
Schedule to the extent that its relevance or applicability to information
called for by such other Section or Sections of the Disclosure Schedule is
reasonably apparent on the face of such disclosure, notwithstanding the
omission of a reference or cross-reference thereto, and (c) the mere inclusion
of an item in the Disclosure Schedule as an exception to a representation or
warranty shall not be deemed an admission or representation that such item
represents an exception or a material fact, event or circumstance or an
admission of any liability or obligation to any Person or that such item has
or would reasonably be expected to have a Company Material Adverse Effect.
Nothing in the Disclosure Schedule shall confer or give to any third party any
remedy, claim, liability, reimbursement, cause of action or other right.

 



 

11.16. _Counterparts_. This Agreement may be executed by .pdf signatures and
in any number of counterparts with the same effect as if all signatory parties
had signed the same document. All counterparts shall be construed together and
shall constitute one and the same instrument.

 



 

11.17. _Further Assurance_. If at any time after the Closing any further
action is necessary or desirable to fully effect the transactions contemplated
by this Agreement or any other of the Ancillary Documents, each of the parties
shall take such further action (including the execution and delivery of such
further instruments and documents) as any other party reasonably may request.
