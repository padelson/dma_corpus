Allocation of Consideration; Cancellation of Options and SARs_.

(a) Closing Payment. At the Closing, subject to the terms and conditions of
this Agreement, each Seller severally shall sell, transfer, assign, and convey
such Sellers Purchased Shares to Buyer, free and clear of any and all Liens,
and Buyer shall purchase, acquire and accept such Purchased Shares from each
Seller, and Buyer shall pay to each Seller such Sellers portion of the
Closing Payment as described in _Section_ __ _ 2.1_ _(b)_. The "Closing
Payment" shall be equal to the Purchase Price, as increased or decreased as
provided below in _Section_ __ _ 2.3_.

(b) Subject to the terms and conditions of this Agreement, at the Closing,
Buyer shall pay or cause to be paid to each Seller an aggregate consideration
for such Sellers Purchased Shares in cash equal to, without duplication, the
product of (A) the Per Share Amount _multiplied_ by (B) the number of
Purchased Shares being sold by such Seller hereunder (each such amount, a "
_Closing Common Share Payment_ "); _provided_ that, if such Seller is a party
to a promissory note listed on _Schedule 2.1(b)_ , such Sellers Closing
Common Share Payment shall be reduced to deduct the amount payable to the
Company under such promissory note as of the Closing in full satisfaction of
such Sellers obligations under such promissory note (and the amount of such
reduction shall be deemed to have been paid to such Seller). Each Seller shall
also be entitled to receive, from time to time from and after the Closing
Date, (x) the amount of such Sellers Pro Rata Share with respect to such
shares of Stock and 1st Global Insurance Stock of any payment made pursuant to
_Section_ __ _ 2.4(d)(ii)_ or _Section_ __ _ 2.4(d)(iii)_ and (y) the amount
of such Sellers Pro Rata Share with respect to such shares of Stock and 1st
Global Insurance Stock of the Escrow Funds (as the same may be adjusted
pursuant to the terms hereof), in each case, if and when such amounts are
payable pursuant to the terms of this Agreement.

 

(c) Subject to the terms and conditions of this Agreement, at the Closing,
each outstanding Option shall be canceled, terminated, and shall be of no
further force or effect and each Optionholder shall be entitled to receive
(whether pursuant to the terms of the Incentive Plan or the applicable Option
award agreement), as aggregate consideration for the cancellation of
such Optionholders Options, without interest, an amount in cash equal to,
without duplication, the positive sum of the Option Amounts applicable to each
outstanding Option held by such Optionholder (which amount shall constitute
part of the Closing Payment) (each such amount, a " _Closing Option Payment_
"). From time to time from and after the Closing Date, each Optionholder shall
also be entitled to receive an amount equal to (x) the amount of
such Optionholders Pro Rata Share with respect to such canceled Options of
any payment made pursuant to _Section_ __ _ 2.4(d)(ii)_ or _Section_ __ _
2.4(d)(iii)_, and (y) the amount of such Optionholders Pro Rata Share with
respect to such canceled Options of the Escrow Funds (as the same may be

 



21

    

 adjusted pursuant to the terms hereof), in each case, if and when such
amounts are payable pursuant to the terms of this Agreement (such amounts
collectively with the aggregate amount of the Closing Option Payments, the "
_Option Cancellation Consideration_ "). Upon termination of an Option, each
applicable Optionholder shall have no further rights or obligations with
respect to (i) such Option other than the payments set forth in this
_Section_ __ _ 2.1(c)_ or (ii) acquiring any equity securities of the Company
in connection with such Option. At the Closing, Buyer shall pay or cause to be
paid to the Company (on behalf of the Optionholders) the aggregate amount of
Closing Option Payments due to all Optionholders (on an aggregated basis)
pursuant to the terms of this _Section_ __ _ 2.1(c)_. On or prior to the
Closing, the board of directors of the Company shall take all action as may
be reasonably necessary to terminate the Incentive Plan and any other or the
applicable Option award agreement of the Company as of the Effective Time and
effectuate the foregoing provisions of this  _Section_ __ _ 2.1(c)_.
Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the contrary, any cash payments
due to any Optionholder with respect to its Options pursuant to this Agreement
(including such Optionholders Closing Option Payment and such Optionholders
Pro Rata Share of the Adjustment Escrow Account, and/or the Indemnity Escrow
Account) shall be paid by the Company through the payroll system of 1st
Partners to the applicable Optionholder to whom such payments are to be made
(and with respect to post-Closing Option Cancellation Consideration in
proportion to such Optionholders Pro Rata Share), subject to any applicable
deductions or withholding Taxes applicable to such individuals, which Taxes
shall be remitted in a timely manner to the appropriate Taxing Authority. In
addition, any discretionary employee transaction bonuses or any other similar
payments identified as Transaction Expenses may be paid through the same
process outlined in the immediately preceding sentence.

(d) Subject to the terms and conditions of this Agreement, at the Closing,
each outstanding SAR shall be canceled, terminated, and shall be of no
further force or effect and each SARs Holder shall be entitled to receive
(whether pursuant to the terms of the SARs Plan or the applicable SARs award
agreement), as aggregate consideration for the cancellation of such SARs
Holders SARs, without interest, an amount in cash equal to, without
duplication, the positive sum of the SARs Amounts applicable to each
outstanding SAR held by such SARs Holder (which amount shall constitute part
of the Closing Payment) (each such amount, a " _Closing SARs Payment_ ").
From time to time from and after the Closing Date, each SARs Holder shall also
be entitled to receive an amount equal to (x) the amount of such
SARs Holders Pro Rata Share with respect to such canceled SARs of any
payment made pursuant to _Section_ __ _ 2.4(d)(ii)_ or _Section_ __ _
2.4(d)(iii)_, and (y) the amount of such SARs Holders Pro Rata Share with
respect to such canceled SARs of the Escrow Funds (as the same may be adjusted
pursuant to the terms hereof), in each case, if and when such amounts are
payable pursuant to the terms of this Agreement (such amounts collectively
with the aggregate amount of the Closing SARs Payments, the "SARs
Cancellation Consideration"). Upon termination of a SAR, each applicable SARs
Holder shall have no further rights or obligations with respect to (i) such
SAR other than the payments set forth in this _Section_ __ _ 2.1(d)_ or (ii)
acquiring any equity securities of the Company in connection with such SAR. At
the Closing, Buyer shall pay or cause to be paid to the Company (on behalf of
the SARs Holder) the aggregate amount of Closing SARs Payments due to all
SARs Holder (on an aggregated basis) pursuant to the terms of this _Section_
__ _ 2.1(d)_. On or prior to the Closing, the board of directors of the
Company shall take all action as may be reasonably necessary to terminate the
SARs Plan and any other or the applicable SARs award agreement of the Company
as of the Effective Time and effectuate the foregoing provisions of this 
_Section_ __ _ 2.1(d)_. Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the
contrary, any cash payments due to any SARs Holder with respect to its SARs

 



22

    

 pursuant to this Agreement (including such SARs Holders Closing SARs
Payment and such SARs Holders Pro Rata Share of the Adjustment Escrow
Account, and/or the Indemnity Escrow Account) shall be paid by the Company
through the payroll system of 1st Partners to the applicable SARs Holder to
whom such payments are to be made (and with respect to post-Closing SARs
Cancellation Consideration in proportion to such SARs Holders Pro Rata
Share), subject to any applicable deductions or withholding Taxes applicable
to such individuals, which Taxes shall be remitted in a timely manner to the
appropriate Taxing Authority. In addition, any discretionary
employee transaction bonuses or any other similar payments identified as
Transaction Expenses may be paid through the same process outlined in the
immediately preceding sentence.

Shares, the cancellation of the Options and SARs, and the post-Closing

as provided in _Section_ __ _ 2.3(a)_ and  _Section_ __ _ 2.4_.

2.3 _Payment of Purchase Price; Indebtedness; Transaction Expenses; Escrow
Funds_.

 

(a) At the Closing, Buyer shall deliver to Sellers, by wire transfer of
immediately available funds to the accounts designated by
Sellers Representative in writing not fewer than three (3) Business Days
prior to the Closing Date, an amount equal to (i) the Purchase Price, plus
(ii) the excess, if any, of Estimated Closing Working Capital over Target
Closing Working Capital, minus (iii) the excess, if any, of Target Closing
Working Capital over Estimated Closing Working Capital, minus (iv) the
Estimated Closing Debt Amount, minus (v) the Estimated Transaction Expenses,
minus (vi) the Escrow Amount minus (vii) the Representative Fund Amount (such
remaining amount resulting from (i)  (vii), the " _Closing Payment_ ").

 

(b) At the Closing, Buyer shall deliver, on behalf of the Company or the
Subsidiaries, as applicable, to each payee identified in each Payoff Letter
and Transaction Expense Statement the amount payable to such payee as set
forth in such Payoff Letter or Transaction Expense Statement and reflected in
the Estimated Closing Statement, in each case by wire transfer to an account
designated by the applicable payee; provided, that in no event shall the
aggregate of all amounts payable pursuant to this _Section_ __ _ 2.3(b)_
exceed the amount equal to the Purchase Price as adjusted pursuant to 
_Section_ __ _ 2.4(a)_, less the Escrow Funds.

(c) At the Closing, Buyer shall deliver the Escrow Amount to the Escrow Agent
to be held in accordance with the terms of the Escrow Agreement.

(d) At the Closing, Buyer shall deliver the Representative Fund Amount to

2.4 _Purchase Price Adjustment_.

 

(a) No later than two (2) Business Days prior to the Closing Date, the Company
shall deliver to Buyer a written statement (the " _Estimated Closing
Statement_ "), setting forth in reasonable detail and accompanied by
reasonably detailed backup documentation, the Companys good faith estimate of
(i) Closing Working Capital (" _Estimated Closing Working Capital_ "), (ii)
the Closing Debt Amount (the " _Estimated Closing Debt Amount_ "), (iii)
Unpaid Transaction Expenses (the " _Estimated Transaction Expenses_ "), and
(iv) the resulting Closing Common

 



23

    

 Share Payment, Closing Option Payment and Closing SARs payment to each
Seller, Optionholder and SARs Holder, as applicable (taking into account and
including the amount of any reduction with respect to such Sellers
promissory note, if any, contemplated by the proviso to the first sentence of
_Section_ __ _ 2.1(b)_). Notwithstanding any input Buyer may have with
respect to the amounts reflected in such written statement, no position or
agreement made or taken by any of the parties with respect to the amounts
reflected in such statement and/or such accompanying calculations shall
preclude any such party from taking any other position or making any
other argument with respect to the Adjustment Statement and/or accompanying
calculations, as applicable. The Estimated Closing Statement is to be prepared
in accordance with the principles set forth on _Exhibit E_ and any applicable
GAAP principles and the principles set forth therein.

(b) Within ninety (90) days after the Closing Date, Buyer shall cause to be
prepared and delivered to Sellers Representative, a written statement (the "
_Adjustment Statement_ ") setting forth in reasonable detail and accompanied
by reasonably detailed backup documentation, Buyers calculation of (i)
Closing Working Capital, (ii) the Closing Debt Amount, and (iii) Unpaid
Transaction Expenses (collectively, the " _Proposed Amounts_ ").

 

(c) The Adjustment Statement (and the computations of the Proposed Amounts
indicated thereon) delivered by Buyer to Sellers Representative shall be
deemed to be conclusive and binding upon the parties unless Sellers
Representative, within forty-five (45) days after delivery to Sellers
Representative of the Adjustment Statement, notifies Buyer in writing that
Sellers dispute in good faith the calculation of specific line items set forth
therein, specifying the nature of each individual disputed line item
calculation and the basis therefor in reasonable detail. During such forty-
five (45)-day period, Buyer and the Company will provide reasonable access
during normal business hours upon reasonable advance notice to the Sellers
Representative and its representatives: (i) to all records and work papers
(or true and complete copies thereof) relating to the Company and the
Subsidiaries and Buyers calculation of the Proposed Amounts that the Sellers
Representative and its representatives reasonably request in reviewing
the Adjustment Statement, and (ii) the time and good-faith and unencumbered
efforts of any members of the Companys management team that are then employed
by Parent or any of its subsidiaries, that were involved in the creation of
the Adjustment Statement, provided that such review and investigation shall
not unreasonably disrupt Parent, the Company, the Subsidiaries or their
Affiliates operations. The parties shall in good faith attempt to resolve any
dispute and, if the parties so resolve all disputes, the Adjustment Statement
(and the computations of Proposed Amounts indicated thereon), as amended to
the extent necessary to reflect the resolution of the dispute, shall be deemed
to be conclusive and binding on the parties. If the parties do not reach
agreement in resolving the dispute within fifteen (15) days after such notice
is given by Sellers Representative to Buyer pursuant to this _Section_ __ _
2.4(c)_, then either party may submit the dispute to PricewaterhouseCoopers,
or another nationally recognized independent accounting firm which is mutually
agreeable to the parties (the " _Independent Accountant_ ") for resolution;
provided, that if the parties are unable to agree on the selection of the
Independent Accountant, Sellers Representative, on the one hand, and Buyer,
on the other hand, shall each select a nationally recognized independent
accounting firm, which together shall appoint a third nationally recognized
independent accounting firm to serve as the Independent Accountant, and such
appointment shall be conclusive and binding on the parties. As promptly as
practicable thereafter (and, in any event, within fifteen (15) days after the
Independent Accountants engagement), Sellers Representative shall submit any
unresolved disputes to the Independent Accountant in

 



24

    

 writing (with a copy to Buyer), supported by any documents and arguments
upon which it relies. As promptly as practicable thereafter (and, in any
event, within fifteen (15) days following the Sellers Representative
submission of such unresolved disputes), Buyer shall submit its response to
the Independent Accountant (with a copy to the Sellers Representative)
supported by any documents and arguments upon which it relies. As soon as
practicable thereafter, the Independent Accountant shall render a decision
based solely on the respective written presentations of Buyer and the Sellers
Representative. In resolving any disputed item, the Independent
Accountant (x) shall be bound by the provisions of this _Section_ __ _
2.4(c)_ and (y) may not assign a value to any item greater than the greatest
value for such items claimed by either Buyer or Sellers Representative or
less than the smallest value for such items claimed by either Buyer or
Sellers Representative. The fees, costs and expenses of the Independent
Accountant shall be allocated to and borne by Buyer, on the one hand, and the
Sellers Representative, on behalf of the Sellers, on the other hand, based
on the inverse of the percentage that the Independent Accountants
determination (before such allocation) bears to the total amount of the total
items in dispute as originally submitted to the Independent Accountant. For
example, should the items in dispute total in amount to $1,000 and the
Independent Accountant awards $600 in favor of Sellers position, 60% of the
costs of its review would be borne by Buyer and 40% of the costs would be
borne by the Sellers Representative, on behalf of the Sellers. Subject to
_Section_ __ _ 8.2(a)(v)_, the final, binding and conclusive calculation of
Closing Working Capital, the Closing Debt Amount and Unpaid Transaction
Expenses, based either upon agreement or deemed agreement by Buyer and Sellers
or the written report delivered by the Independent Accountant, in each case,
in accordance with this _Section_ __ _ 2.4(c)_, will be the " _Final Closing
Working Capital_ ", " _Final Closing Debt Amount_ ", or " _Final Transaction
Expenses_ " as the case may be (collectively, the " _Final Amounts_ "), for
all purposes of this Agreement.

(d) On the third (3rd) Business Day after the determination of the Final
Amounts in accordance with this _Section_ __ _ 2.4_:

(i) If the Adjustment Amount is a negative amount, then an amount in dollars
equal to the absolute value of such amount, shall, within three (3) Business
Days from the date on which the Final Amounts are finally determined pursuant
to this _Section_ __ _ 2.4_, be delivered to Buyer and/or its designee by
wire transfer of immediately available funds to an account designated by
Buyer from the Adjustment Escrow Account and Buyer and Sellers Representative
shall deliver joint written instructions to the Escrow Agent instructing the
Escrow Agent, pursuant to this _Section_ __ _ 2.4(d)(i)_, to deliver the
applicable amounts due to Buyer and, if there are any Adjustment Escrow Funds
remaining after such delivery, deliver the same to (A) each Seller by wire
transfer of immediately available funds in accordance with each Sellers
respective Pro Rata Share to such account or accounts designated by Sellers
Representative, (B) to each Optionholder (through 1st Partners) in accordance
with each Optionholders respective Pro Rata Share, and (C) to each SARs
Holder (through 1st Partners), in accordance with each SARs Holders
respective Pro Rata Share. The Company shall cause 1st Partners to pay each
Optionholder and SARs Holder its Pro Rata Share of such Adjustment Amount, if
any, through 1st Partners payroll system subject to applicable withholding
obligations. If the Adjustment Escrow Amount is insufficient to pay the full
Adjustment Amount to Buyer, Buyer, in its sole discretion, may receive the
remaining Adjustment Amount from either (A) the Indemnity Escrow Funds and/or
(B) the Special Escrow Funds. If Buyer elects to receive the remaining
Adjustment Amount from the Indemnity Escrow Funds and/or the Special Escrow
Funds, Buyer and the Sellers Representative shall deliver joint written
instructions to the Escrow Agent instructing the Escrow Agent to deliver the
applicable amounts due to Buyer. No Seller shall have any obligation under
this _Section_ __ _ 2.4(d)(i)_ in excess of the Escrow Funds.

 



25

    

(ii) If the Adjustment Amount is a positive amount, then an amount in dollars
equal to the absolute value of such amount, within three (3) Business Days
from the date on which the Final Amounts are finally determined pursuant to
this _Section_ __ _ 2.4_, be paid to (A) each Seller by wire transfer

Buyer to effect an Acquisition Transaction or any request for non-public

material failure on its part to comply with or satisfy any covenant, condition

affect the remedies available hereunder to the party receiving such notice, or
the representations or warranties of, or the conditions to the obligations
of, the parties.

6.7 _Indebtedness_. Prior to the Closing, Sellers and the Company shall also
make arrangements reasonably satisfactory to Buyer for holders of any

assets or properties of the Company and the Subsidiaries that are not

Subsidiaries on an "occurrence" basis (the " _Occurrence Policies_ ") to
cover the Company and the Subsidiaries following the Closing Date for claims
arising out of occurrences prior to the Closing Date. The Company and Sellers
acknowledge the right of Buyer to access the benefit of insurance for such
pre-Closing occurrences under the historic Occurrence Policies which have
provided coverage to the Company and the Subsidiaries, to issue notice of
claims under any Occurrence Policies in the name of the Company, to present
such claims for payment and to collect insurance proceeds related thereto.

(b) At or prior to the Closing, the Company and the Subsidiaries shall
purchase a six (6) year extended directors and officers liability, non-

occurring on or prior to the Closing Date with respect to those Persons who
are currently covered by the Company and the Subsidiaries comparable
insurance policy (a true and complete copy of which has heretofore been Made
Available) at limit levels and otherwise on terms with respect to such
coverage no less favorable to the insured than those of such current insurance
coverage.

or otherwise) or participate in the ownership, establishment, management,
operation or control of, any business, whether in corporate, proprietorship or
partnership form or otherwise, engaged in wealth management, tax, broker-

68

    

 compete with, the business of each of the Company and the Subsidiaries as
currently conducted (a " _Founder Restricted Business_ ") anywhere in the
United States of America;  _provided_ , that the restrictions contained in

stock of any publicly traded company engaged in a Founder Restricted
Business.

(b) For a period of two (2) years from and after the Closing Date,
the Officer Sellers shall not, and shall cause their Affiliates not to,

firm, corporation or other entity that is competing or that is preparing to
compete with any aspect of the Company or the Subsidiaries business as
currently conducted on the Closing Date, which includes wealth management,
investment and insurance products or services provided to or through
CPA firms or tax professionals (an " _Officer and Seller Restricted Business_
") anywhere in the United States of America; provided, that the restrictions
contained in this _Section_ __ _ 6.10(b)_ shall not restrict the acquisition
by the Officer Sellers, directly or indirectly, of less than 2% of the
outstanding capital stock of any publicly traded company engaged in an Officer
and Seller Restricted Business.

 

(c) For a period of five (5) years from and after the Closing Date, the
Founder Seller shall not, and shall cause his Affiliates not to, directly or
indirectly: (i) (A) cause, solicit, induce or encourage any employee of Buyer,
the Company and the Subsidiaries or any of their Affiliates, or any individual
who was employed by Buyer, the Company and the Subsidiaries or any of their
Affiliates at any time within six (6) months before such solicitation,
inducement or encouragement to leave such employment or (B) hire, employ or
otherwise engage any such employee or individual; or (ii) cause, solicit,
induce or encourage any former, actual or prospective client, customer,
supplier, registered representative, investment adviser representative, or

to do business with a Founder Restricted Business or terminate or materially

cause, solicit, induce or encourage any former, actual or prospective client,

69

    

(e) From and after the Closing Date, each Seller and the Sellers
Representative shall not and shall cause such Sellers and Sellers
Representatives Affiliates not to, directly or indirectly, disclose, reveal,
divulge or communicate to any Person other than authorized officers, directors
and employees of the Parent, Buyer or any of the Company and the Subsidiaries
or use or otherwise exploit for its own benefit or for the benefit of anyone
other than the Company and the Subsidiaries, any Confidential Information.
Neither any Seller nor Sellers Representative shall have any obligation to
keep confidential (or cause such Sellers or Sellers Representatives
Affiliates to keep confidential) any Confidential Information if and to the
extent disclosure thereof is specifically required by applicable Law;
provided, that in the event disclosure is required by applicable Law, such
Seller or Sellers Representative shall, to the extent reasonably possible,
provide Buyer with prompt notice of such requirement prior to making any
disclosure so that Buyer may seek an appropriate protective order and
cooperate with Buyer concerning any such protective order sought.

 

(f) From and after the Closing Date, Sellers shall not and shall cause
Sellers Affiliates not to, directly or indirectly, disparage Buyer, the
Company and the Subsidiaries or any of their respective Affiliates in any way
that adversely and substantially impacts the goodwill, reputation or business
relationships of Buyer, the Company and the Subsidiaries or any of
their respective Affiliates with the public generally, or with any of their
customers, suppliers, independent contractors, or employees.

(g) The covenants and undertakings contained in this _Section_ __ _ 6.9_
relate to matters which are of a special, unique and extraordinary character
and a violation of any of the terms of this _Section_ __ _ 6.9_ will cause
irreparable injury to Buyer, the amount of which will be impossible to
estimate or determine and which cannot be adequately compensated. Accordingly,
the remedy at law for any breach of this _Section_ __ _ 6.9_ will
be inadequate. Therefore, Buyer will be entitled to an injunction,
restraining order or other equitable relief from any court of competent
jurisdiction in the event of any breach of this _Section_ __ _ 6.9_ without
the necessity of proving actual damages or posting any bond whatsoever. The
rights and remedies provided by this _Section_ __ _ 6.9_ are cumulative and
in addition to any other rights and remedies which Buyer may have hereunder or
at law or in equity.

(h) No claim against Buyer or its Affiliates by Sellers or the Company under
this Agreement or otherwise shall constitute a defense to the enforcement by
Buyer of the covenants and obligations in this _Section_ __ _ 6.9_. In the
event of any actual or threatened violation of the covenants and obligations
under this _Section_ __ _ 6.9_ by Sellers or the Company, Buyer shall be
entitled to recover from Sellers or the Company its reasonable attorneys fees
and all costs and expenses associated with the enforcement of any provision of
this _Section_ __ _ 6.9_ in addition to any other available legal or
equitable remedies. If any court of competent jurisdiction finds that Sellers
or the Company has breached any of its covenants or obligations under this
_Section_ __ _ 6.9_ _,_ the time period during which such covenants and
obligations are effective shall be suspended and shall not run in favor of
Sellers or the Company from the date of such breach until the date when such
breach is cured or remedied.

 



70

    

(i) The parties hereto agree that, if any court of competent jurisdiction in a
final nonappealable judgment determines that a specified time period, a
specified geographical area, a specified business limitation or any other
relevant feature of this _Section_ __ _ 6.9_ is unreasonable, arbitrary,
unenforceable, or against public policy, then a lesser period of time,
geographical area, business limitation or other relevant feature which is
determined by such court to be reasonable, not arbitrary, enforceable, and not
against public policy shall be enforced against the applicable party. Sellers
and the Company acknowledge that their covenants and obligations in this
_Section_ __ _ 6.9_ have been a material inducement for Buyer to consummate
this Agreement. Accordingly, Seller and the Company irrevocably waive any
right existing as of the Closing Date or arising in the future to (i) file any
declaratory judgment or similar action seeking to declare unenforceable any
covenant or obligations under this  _Section_ __ _ 6.9_ or challenge the
validity of such covenants or obligations; (ii) otherwise contest the
enforceability of any such covenants or obligations as being unreasonable or
unenforceable; or (iii) assert any defenses to any action or effort by Buyer
to enforce any such covenants or obligations based on their reasonableness.

6.10 _Preservation of Records_. With respect to the pre-Closing financial
books and records and minute books of the Company and the Subsidiaries
relating to matters on or prior to the Closing Date: (a) for a period of five
(5) years after the Closing Date, Buyer shall not cause or permit their
destruction or disposal without first offering to surrender them to Sellers
Representative, at Sellers expense, and (b) where there is
legitimate purpose, including an audit of Sellers by the IRS or any other
Taxing Authority or an indemnification claim by Buyer pursuant to Article VIII
hereof, Buyer shall allow Sellers and their representatives access to such
books and records during regular business hours.

6.11 _Publicity_.

 

(a) No party shall issue any press release or public announcement concerning
this Agreement or the transactions contemplated hereby without obtaining the
prior written approval of Buyer, in the case of the Company or any Subsidiary
(prior to Closing) or any Seller, or of Sellers Representative, in the case
of Buyer or Parent, which approval will not be unreasonably
withheld, conditioned or delayed, unless disclosure is otherwise required by
applicable Law or by the applicable rules of any stock exchange on which Buyer
or its Affiliates lists securities, provided, that, to the extent required by
applicable Law, the party intending to make such release shall use its
commercially reasonable efforts consistent with such applicable Law to consult
with Buyer and Sellers Representative with respect to the contents thereof.
Notwithstanding the foregoing, from and after the Closing, Buyer may issue
any press release or public announcement concerning this Agreement or the
transactions contemplated hereby without obtaining the prior written approval
of Sellers Representative, provided, however, that Buyer will permit
Sellers Representative to review any such release or announcement prior to
its public dissemination.

(b) Except as provided in _Section_ __ _ 6.11(a)_, each of Buyer, Sellers,
and the Company agrees that the material terms of this Agreement shall not be
disclosed or otherwise made available to the public and that copies of this
Agreement shall not be publicly filed or otherwise made available to the
public, except where such disclosure, availability or filing is required by
applicable Law and only to the extent required by such Law. In the event that
such disclosure, availability or filing is required by applicable Law, each
of Buyer, Sellers and the Company (as applicable) agrees to use its
commercially reasonable efforts to obtain "confidential treatment" of this
Agreement with such Governmental Body and to redact such terms of this
Agreement the other party shall request.

 



71

    

6.12 _Releases_ _._

 

(a) Effective upon the Closing, each of Sellers and their successor and
assigns (collectively, the " _Seller Releasing Parties_ ") shall be deemed to
have remised, released and forever discharged the Company and the Subsidiaries
and their respective successors, officers, directors and employees (and each
of their respective heirs, executors and administrators acting in such
capacities) and, subject to and without in any way limiting Buyers
obligations under this Agreement and any Buyer Document, Buyer and its
successors, officers, directors and employees (and each of their
respective heirs, executors and administrators acting in such capacities)
(collectively, the " _Buyer and Company Released Parties_ "), of and from any
and all claims, actions, matters, causes of action, in law or in equity,
Liabilities, suits, proceedings, arbitrations, mediations or other
investigations, debts, Liens, Contracts, promises, accounts, sums of money,
reckonings, bonds, bills, demands, damages, losses, costs or expenses, whether
direct or derivative, of any nature whatsoever, known or unknown, fixed or
contingent, including any claim for indemnification or contribution
(collectively, the " _Claims_ ") that the Seller Releasing Parties, or any of
them, now has or ever had, or hereafter can, shall or may have, for, upon or
by reason of any matter, cause or thing whatsoever, against the Buyer and
Company Released Parties, and each of them, from the beginning of time through
the Closing Date, other than (i) any obligations to provide indemnification,
exculpation or advancement of expenses to any Seller Releasing Party who is or
was an officer or director of the Company or any Subsidiary and who is
entitled to such indemnification, exculpation or advancement of expenses under
the charter of the Company and the Subsidiaries or as a matter of Law by or
on behalf of the Company or any Subsidiary, but in each case, solely to the
extent any Losses related to such obligation are insured under the Tail Policy
at no expense to the Company and the Subsidiaries, (ii) any rights that any
Seller Releasing Party may have as an Employee to earned and unpaid salary,
bonuses, accrued vacation or other employee compensation and unreimbursed
expenses, in each case to the extent reflected in Final Closing Working
Capital. Each Seller Releasing Party covenants and agrees that such Seller
Releasing Party shall not commence, join in or in any manner seek relief
through any suit arising out of, based upon or relating to any Claim released
hereunder, or in any manner assert or cause or assist another to assert any
Claims released hereunder. NOTWITHSTANDING ANYTHING CONTAINED IN THIS _SECTION
6.12_ TO THE CONTRARY, NOTHING HEREIN SHALL BE DEEMED TO RELEASE,
WAIVE, MODIFY, AMEND OR OTHERWISE AFFECT THE RIGHTS OR THE OBLIGATIONS,
COVENANTS OR COMMITMENTS OF SELLER RELEASING PARTIES OR BUYER AND RELEASED
PARTIES UNDER THIS AGREEMENT OR IN CONNECTION WITH THE TRANSACTIONS
CONTEMPLATED HEREBY.

 

(b) Each Seller Releasing Party acknowledges, represents and warrants that
such Seller Releasing Party has had adequate disclosure of all
facts necessary to make a knowing release of all Claims released hereunder.
Effective for all purposes as of the Closing, each Seller Releasing Party
waives and relinquishes any rights and benefits which such Seller Releasing
Party may have under any statute or common law principle of any jurisdiction
which provides, generally, that a general release does not extend to claims
which a creditor does not know or suspect to exist in such Seller Releasing
Partys favor at the time of executing this Agreement, which if known by such
Seller Releasing Party must have materially affected such Seller Releasing
Partys settlement with the debtor. Each Seller Releasing Party acknowledges
that such Seller Releasing Party may hereafter discover facts in addition to
or different from those which such Seller Releasing Party

 



72

    

 now knows or believes to be true with respect to the subject matter of this
_Section_ __ _ 6.12_, but it is each such Seller Releasing Partys intention
to fully and finally and forever settle and release any and all matters,
disputes and differences, known or unknown, suspected and unsuspected, which
now exist, may exist or heretofore have existed between any Seller Releasing
Party and any Buyer and Company Released Party with respect to the subject
matter of this _Section_ __ _ 6.12_ (subject to the exceptions set forth in
this _Section_ __ _ 6.12_). In furtherance of this intention, the releases
herein shall be and remain in effect as full and complete general releases
notwithstanding the discovery or existence of any such additional or different
facts. Each Seller Releasing Party covenants that such Seller Releasing Party
has not assigned any Claims which are the subject of this _Section_ __ _
6.12_.

6.13 _HSR_. The Company and Buyer shall, as soon as reasonably possible but
in no event later than ten (10) calendar days after the date hereof, file
Notification and Report Forms under the HSR Act (the " _HSR Filing_ ") with
the Federal Trade Commission and the Antitrust Division of the United States
Department of Justice. The Company and Buyer shall, as soon as practicable but
in any event within two (2) Business Days after the date of this Agreement
make such other filings, notices, petitions, statements, registrations,
submissions of information, applications and other documents as the Parties
determine are necessary under applicable Antitrust Law or regulations if the
Company or Buyer, as applicable, have not made such filings prior to the
execution of this Agreement. The Company and Buyer shall furnish to the other
such necessary information and reasonable assistance as the other may request
in connection with its preparation of any filing or submission that is
necessary under the HSR Act or other applicable antitrust regulation. Each of
the Company and Buyer will promptly inform the other party of any material
communication received by such party from any Governmental Body relating to
the HSR Filing. Each of the Company and Buyer will use its respective
commercially reasonable efforts to comply as expeditiously as possible with
all requests of any Governmental Body for additional information and
documents, including, without limitation, information or documents requested
under the HSR Act or other applicable antitrust regulation. Buyer, on the one
hand, and Sellers, on the other hand, shall split equally all filing fees
under the HSR Act. No party to this Agreement shall consent to any voluntary
delay of the consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby at the
behest of any Governmental Body without the consent of the other parties to
this Agreement, which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld, conditioned
or delayed

 

6.14 _FINRA Approval_. As promptly as practicable (and in any event within
fifteen (15) days) following the date of this Agreement, the Company shall
prepare and file with FINRA, on a confidential basis to the extent permitted
by applicable Law, a substantially complete and accurate application for
approval of a change in ownership or control as a result of the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement (the " _FINRA Application_ "),
which if approved by FINRA shall be evidenced by a letter of approval from
FINRA (the " _FINRA Approval_ "). The Parties agree to reasonably cooperate
with each other on the filing of the FINRA Application and in furnishing
further information requested by FINRA, and to work in good faith and use
commercially reasonable efforts to obtain the FINRA Approval. The Company
agrees to timely and accurately respond to FINRA requests, to keep the Buyer
reasonably informed in a timely manner of any material developments regarding
the FINRA Application, to afford the Buyer a reasonable time to review and
comment upon the FINRA Application and any subsequent FINRA submissions, that
the FINRA Application shall be in form and substance reasonably satisfactory
to the Buyer and to furnish the Buyer with a copy of the filed FINRA
Application (including attachments and all revisions and updates thereto) and
with all correspondence sent to and received from FINRA (including emails).
The Company shall notify Buyer prior to filing the FINRA Application and any
subsequent FINRA submissions.

surety, to the Sellers and the Company the due and timely performance by Buyer
of Buyers pre-Closing covenants, agreements, obligations, commitments and
undertakings given or undertaken or expressed to be given or undertaken under
this Agreement which are to be performed on or prior to the
Closing (including, for the avoidance of doubt, the payment of the Purchase
Price).

 



76

    

(b) The guarantee in _Section_ __ _ 6.20_ _(a)_ is a guarantee of payment
and performance, and not merely of collection, and the Parent acknowledges and
agrees that no release or extinguishments of the Buyers obligations or
Liabilities (other than in accordance with the terms of this Agreement),
whether by decree in any bankruptcy proceeding or otherwise, shall affect the
continuing validity and enforceability of this guarantee.

(c) The Parent hereby waives, for the benefit of the Sellers and the Company,
any right to require the Sellers or the Company, as a condition of payment or
performance by the Parent, to proceed against the Parent or pursue any other
remedies whatsoever with respect to the pre-Closing obligations of Buyer. The
Parent further waives any and all defenses it may have to the enforceability
of this guaranty against it solely as a guarantor, which waiver shall
not affect any defenses Buyer may have as an obligor with respect thereto.
The Parent hereby represents and warrants to the Sellers and the Company that
(i) it is a corporation duly formed, validly existing and in good standing
under the laws of the state of Delaware, and it has all power and authority
to execute, deliver and perform its obligations under this _Section_ __ _
6.20_ _(a)_ ; (ii) the execution, delivery and performance of this Agreement
by it has been duly and validly authorized and approved by all necessary
corporate action on its part, and no other proceedings or actions on the part
of it are necessary therefor; (iii) this Agreement has been duly and validly
executed and delivered by it and assuming that this Agreement is a valid and
binding obligation of the other parties hereto, constitutes a valid and
legally binding obligation of it, enforceable against it in accordance with
its terms, (iv) it has, and will have at the Closing, sufficient funds
immediately available to pay and perform all of its obligations under this
_Section_ __ _ 6.20_, and (v) that all materials filed by the Parent with the
Securities and Exchange Commission are true and correct in all material
respects. The Parties acknowledge and agree that obligations of the Parent
hereunder are independent of the obligations of the Buyer and that a separate
action may be brought against the Parent, whether or not such action
is brought against Buyer or whether Buyer is joined in such action. The
Parent hereby agrees that its Liability hereunder shall not be contingent upon
the exercise or enforcement by the Sellers or the Company of whatever remedies
they may have against Buyer or any of its Affiliates. For the avoidance of
doubt, Parent shall have no obligations under this Agreement or any Buyer
Document (other than any Buyer Document executed by Parent) following the
Closing.

 

6.21 _R andW Insurance Policy_. Buyer has obtained a binder for the RandW
Insurance Policy with the RandW Insurance Provider, which such RandW Insurance
Policy contains certain conditions to issuing the policy following the

the Parties hereto acknowledge that obtaining the RandW Insurance Policy is a
material inducement to each of the Parties entering into the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement, and the Sellers are relying on Buyers
covenants and obligations set forth in this _Section_ __ _ 6.21_. Prior to
and after the Closing, Buyer and Seller each agree to take all commercially
reasonable actions necessary to complete the conditions in the RandW Insurance
Policy. Following the date hereof, Buyer shall not amend or agree to the
amendment of the binder for the RandW Insurance Policy in any manner that is
materially adverse to the Sellers (including with respect to the subrogation
provisions, policy term, retention amount or coverage amount) without the
Sellers Representatives prior written consent, which shall not be
unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed.

to the Closing Date, Sellers shall cause the Company or the applicable
Subsidiary to take all actions necessary to amend the 1st Partners and Co.
401(k) Plan (the " _Seller 401(k) Plan_ "), to the extent necessary, in order
to (i) permit the distribution and rollover of outstanding participant loans
under the Seller 401(k) Plan; (ii) terminate the Seller 401(k) Plan, effective
as of such date, but contingent upon the Closing; and (iii) fully-vest the
accounts of all of the Seller 401(k) Plans participants, contingent upon
such plan termination. During the post-Closing period, the Company or the
applicable Subsidiary shall take all necessary actions in order to cause the
Seller 401(k) Plan to distribute the accounts of the Seller 401(k) Plans
participants in accordance with the terms of the Seller 401(k) Plan and the
elections of said plan participants. Buyer shall use commercially reasonable
efforts, subject to applicable Law and the terms of its tax qualified
retirement plan (the " _Buyer 401(k) Plan_ "), to permit the Seller 401(k)
Plans participants to voluntarily rollover to the Buyer 401(k) Plan any
amounts, including, for the avoidance of doubt, any outstanding participant
loans, distributed from the Seller 401(k) Plan.

director (including, without limitation, by the provision of relevant records
or information).

commercially reasonable efforts to (a) take, or cause to be taken, all
actions necessary or appropriate to consummate the transactions contemplated

the transactions contemplated by this Agreement. At or after Closing, and
without further consideration, Sellers will execute and deliver to Buyer such
further instruments of conveyance and transfer as may be reasonably necessary
to effectively convey and transfer the Purchased Shares to Buyer, free and
clear of all Liens other than Permitted Exceptions.

6.24  _Directors_ __ _and Officers_ __ _Insurance_. Buyer shall ensure that
the certificate of incorporation or bylaws of the Company and each Subsidiary
shall contain provisions with respect to indemnification to the former
officers and directors that are no less favorable than those in effect in the
certificate of formation and bylaws of the Company and each Subsidiary as in
effect on the date of this Agreement, and such provisions shall (i) not be
amended in any way that is less protective to the former officers and
directors of the Company or any Subsidiary and (ii) be included in any
successor entity to Buyer or the Company.

(including in respect of any options, warrants or other Contract rights)
arising prior to Effective Time or in connection with the consummation of the

Price in accordance with the terms of this Agreement or the Escrow Agreement
in accordance with the terms of this Agreement or the Escrow Agreement,

BY THE COMPANY, BUYER, AND SELLERS TO APPLY IN ACCORDANCE WITH THEIR TERMS,
AND SUBJECT TO ANY LIMITATIONS STATED THEREIN, IRRESPECTIVE OF WHETHER STRICT
LIABILITY (INCLUDING UNDER CERCLA) OR THE FAULT OF ANY OF THE COMPANY, BUYER,
AND SELLERS TO BE INDEMNIFIED (INCLUDING THE NEGLIGENCE, IN FULL OR IN PART,
OF THE COMPANY, BUYER, AND SELLERS) IS ALLEGED OR PROVEN IN CONNECTION WITH A
MATTER FOR WHICH INDEMNIFICATION IS SOUGHT. THE COMPANY, BUYER, AND SELLERS
ACKNOWLEDGE AND AGREE THAT THIS PARAGRAPH (i) DOES NOT ALTER THE AGREEMENTS
OF COMPANY, BUYER, AND SELLERS IN THIS _SECTION 8.2(a)_ AND (ii) IS INTENDED
SOLELY TO COMPLY WITH THE EXPRESS NEGLIGENCE RULE OR SIMILAR RULES REGARDING
THE CONSPICUOUSNESS OF AN INDEMNITY.

such Seller contained in Article III of this Agreement or in any Seller
Document executed by such Seller, as of the date hereof and at and as of the

(i) Any inaccuracy in or breach of the representations or warranties made by

specific date, in which case any inaccuracy in or breach of such
representation and warranty accurate as of such date; and

 

(ii) any breach of any covenant or other agreement on the part of Buyer
contained in this Agreement or any Buyer Document.

 

8.3 _Indemnification Procedures_.

 

(a) A claim for indemnification for any matter not involving a Third-Party
Claim may be asserted by notice to the party from whom indemnification is
sought (or, in the event the indemnified party is a Seller, the written
consent of Sellers Representative); provided, that failure to so notify the
indemnifying party shall not preclude the indemnified party from
any indemnification which it may claim in accordance with this Article VIII.

(b) In the event that any Legal Proceedings shall be instituted or that any
claim or demand shall be asserted by any third-party in respect of which
indemnification may be sought under _Section_ __ _ 8.2_ hereof (regardless of
the limitations set forth in _Section_ __ _ 8.4_) (a " _Third-Party Claim_
"), the indemnified party shall promptly cause written notice of the assertion
of any Third-Party Claim of which it has knowledge which is covered by this
indemnity to be forwarded to the indemnifying party (or, in the event the
indemnified party is a Seller, the written consent of Sellers
Representative). The failure of the indemnified party to give reasonably
prompt notice of any Third-Party Claim shall not release, waive or
otherwise affect the indemnifying partys obligations with respect thereto
except to the extent that the indemnifying party can demonstrate actual and
material loss and prejudice as a result of such failure. Subject to the
provisions of this  _Section_ __ _ 8.3_, the indemnifying party shall have
the right, at its sole expense, to be represented by counsel of its choice,
which must be reasonably satisfactory to the indemnified party, and to defend
against, negotiate, settle or otherwise deal with any Third-Party Claim which
relates to any Losses indemnified against by it hereunder; _provided_ , that
the indemnifying party shall have acknowledged in writing to the indemnified
party its unqualified obligation as between the indemnified party and the
indemnifying party to indemnify the indemnified party as provided hereunder if
the facts alleged in such Third-Party Claim are substantially true and
furnishes evidence to the indemnified party, which is satisfactory to the
indemnified party, of its financial ability to indemnify the indemnified party
and; _provided_ , _further_ , that that indemnifying party shall not have a
right to assume the defense of a Third-Party Claim if (w) such Third-Party
Claim seeks an injunction or equitable relief against the indemnified party,
(x) the amount of Losses in respect

 



85

    

 of such Third-Party Claim (and all other pending claims) could be reasonably
expected to exceed the amounts for which the indemnifying party is obligated
to indemnify the indemnified party, (y) such Third-Party Claim relates to or
arises in connection with any criminal proceeding or involves claims by any
Governmental Body or by a customer or its Affiliate or (z) the indemnifying
party fails to make reasonably adequate provision to satisfy the indemnified
party of the indemnifying partys ability to conduct the defense of such
Third-Party Claim. If the indemnifying party elects to defend against,
negotiate, settle or otherwise deal with any Third-Party Claim which relates
to any Losses indemnified against by it hereunder, it shall within ten (10)
days of the indemnified partys written notice of the assertion of such Third-
Party Claim (or sooner, if the nature of the Third-Party Claim so requires)
notify the indemnified party of its intent to do so; provided, that the
indemnifying party must conduct its defense of the Third-Party Claim actively
and diligently thereafter in order to preserve its rights in this regard (it
being understood that if the indemnifying party fails to actively and
diligently conduct such defense, the indemnified party shall be entitled to
assume control of such defense and the indemnifying party shall be bound by
the results obtained by the indemnified party with respect to such Third-
Party Claim). If the indemnifying party elects not to defend against,
negotiate, settle or otherwise deal with any Third-Party Claim which relates
to any Losses indemnified against by it hereunder, fails to notify the
indemnified party of its election as herein provided, contests its obligation
to indemnify the indemnified party for such Losses under this Agreement or is
not permitted hereunder to assume such defense, the indemnified party
shall have the exclusive right to contest, settle or pay the amount claimed
and the indemnifying party shall be bound by the results obtained by the
indemnified party with respect to such Third-Party Claim. If the indemnifying
party shall assume the defense of any Third-Party Claim, the indemnified
party may participate, at his or its own expense, in the defense of such
Third-Party Claim; provided, that such indemnified party shall be entitled to
participate in any such defense with separate counsel at the expense of the
indemnifying party if (i) so requested by the indemnifying party to
participate or (ii) in the reasonable opinion of counsel to the indemnified
party, a conflict or potential conflict exists between the indemnified party
and the indemnifying party that would make such separate representation
advisable; and provided, further, that the indemnifying party shall not be
required to pay for more than one such counsel (plus any appropriate local
counsel) for all indemnified parties in connection with any Third-Party
Claim. Each party hereto agrees to provide reasonable access to each other
party to such documents and information as may be reasonably requested in
connection with the defense, negotiation or settlement of any such Third-
Party Claim. Notwithstanding anything in this _Section_ __ _ 8.3_ to the
contrary, the indemnifying party shall not consent to the entry of any
judgment with respect to the matter or enter into any settlement or admit any
liability or otherwise agree to any compromise with respect to the matter,
which judgment, settlement, admission or compromise (A) does not irrevocably
and without qualification release the indemnified party from all Liability to
each third-party with respect thereto, (B) provides for injunctive or other
nonmonetary relief affecting the indemnified party, (C) provides for monetary
damages that are not fully paid or reimbursed by the indemnifying party, or
(D) has an adverse effect on Buyer, any of the Company and the Subsidiaries or
an Affiliate thereof, without (in each case), the written consent of the
indemnified party (or, in the event the indemnified party is a Seller, the
written consent of Sellers Representative). If the indemnifying party makes
any payment on any Third-Party Claim, the indemnifying party shall be
subrogated, to the extent of such payment, to all rights and remedies of
the indemnified party to any insurance benefits or other claims of the
indemnified party with respect to such Third-Party Claim. No settlement of any
Third-Party Claim shall limit or reduce the right of any indemnified party to
indemnification in accordance with this Article VIII for all Losses such
indemnified party may incur arising out of or resulting from such Third-Party
Claim. Notwithstanding the foregoing, any Tax Claim shall be handled in
accordance with  _Section_ __ _ 8.7(c)_.

 



86

    

(c) After any final decision, judgment or award shall have been rendered by a
Governmental Body of competent jurisdiction and the expiration of the time in
which to appeal therefrom, or a settlement shall have been consummated, or the
indemnified party and the indemnifying party shall have arrived at a mutually
binding agreement, in each case with respect to a Third-Party Claim
hereunder, the indemnified party shall forward to the indemnifying party
notice of any sums due and owing by the indemnifying party pursuant to this
Agreement with respect to such matter and the indemnifying party shall pay
all of such remaining sums so due and owing to the indemnified party in
accordance with _Section_ __ _ 8.5_.

 

(d) If any Third-Party Claim is of a nature such that (i) the indemnified
party is required by applicable Law or any Order, or (ii) it is necessary in
the reasonable view of the indemnified party acting in good faith and in a
manner consistent with reasonable commercial practices, in respect of (A) a
Third-Party Claim by a customer or its Affiliate relating to products or
services supplied by the business of the Company and the Subsidiaries or (B) a
Third-Party Claim relating to any Material Contract which is necessary to the
ongoing operations of the Company and the Subsidiaries or any material
part thereof in order to avoid material damage to the relationship between
the indemnified party and any of its major customers or to preserve the rights
of the indemnified Party under such an essential Material Contract, to make a
payment to any Person with respect to the Third-Party Claim before the
completion of settlement negotiations or related Legal Proceedings, as the
case may be, then the indemnified party may make such payment and the
indemnifying party shall, promptly after demand by the indemnified party,
reimburse the indemnified party for such payment. If the amount of any
liability of the indemnified party under the Third-Party Claim in respect of
which such a payment was made, as finally determined, is less than the
amount which was paid by the indemnifying party to the indemnified party, the
indemnified party shall, promptly after receipt of the difference from the
Person, pay the amount of such difference to the indemnifying party.

 

(e) Nothing in this Article VIII shall apply to limit any right to recovery
under the RandW Insurance Policy, and the obligations set forth in this
_Section_ __ _ 8.3_ shall be subject to any obligations of any insured under
the RandW Insurance Policy.

8.4  _Other Indemnification Provisions_.

(a) Sellers shall not be required to indemnify any Buyer Indemnified Party
under  _Section_ __ _ 8.2(a)(i)_ and _Section_ __ _ 8.2(b)(i)_ __ unless
the aggregate amount of Losses suffered by any Buyer Indemnified Parties
exceeds $900,000 (the " _Deductible_ ") and then Sellers shall be required to
indemnify the applicable Buyer Indemnified Parties, subject to _Section_ __ _
8.4(b)_, for the amount of Losses in excess of the Deductible; provided, that
this  _Section_ __ _ 8.4(a)_ shall not apply to Losses related to (x) the
failure to be true and correct of any of the Fundamental Representations, or
(y) any indemnification claim arising out of any Fraud. Buyer shall not
be required to indemnify any Buyer Indemnified Party under _Section_ __ _
8.2(c)(i)_ unless the aggregate amount of Losses suffered by any Seller
Indemnified Parties exceeds the Deductible and then Buyer shall be required to
indemnify the applicable Seller Indemnified Parties, subject to _Section_ __
_ 8.4(b)_, for the amount of Losses in excess of the Deductible limitation;
provided, that this _Section_ __ _ 8.4(a)_ shall not apply to Losses related
to (x) the failure to be true and correct of any of the Fundamental

87

    

(b) Neither Sellers, on the one hand, nor Buyer, on the other hand, shall be
required to indemnify any Person under _Section_ __ _ 8.2(a)(i)_, _Section_
__ _ 8.2(b)(i)_, or _Section_ __ _ 8.2(c)(i)_, as applicable, for an
aggregate amount of Losses exceeding the then remaining amount of the
Indemnity Escrow Funds (the " _General Cap_ "); provided, that the General Cap
shall not apply with respect to Losses related to (x) the failure to be true
and correct of any of the Fundamental Representation or (y) any
indemnification claim arising out of any Fraud. Neither any Seller, on the one
hand, nor Buyer, on the other hand, shall be required to indemnify any Person
with respect to Fundamental Representations under  _Section_ __ _
8.2(a)(i)_, _Section_ __ _ 8.2(b)(i)_, or _Section_ __ _ 8.2(c)(i)_, as
applicable, for an aggregate amount of Losses exceeding the Closing Payment,
as adjusted as provided in  _Section_ __ _ 2.4_ (the " _Fundamental Cap_ ");
provided, that the Fundamental Cap shall not apply with respect to Losses
related to any indemnification claim arising out of any Fraud.

 

(c) For purposes of determining the failure of any representations or
warranties to be true and correct, the breach of any covenants or agreements,
and calculating Losses hereunder, any materiality or Material Adverse Effect
qualifications in the representations, warranties, covenants and agreements
shall be disregarded.

 

(d) Sellers shall not be required to indemnify any Person under _Section_ __ _
8.2(a)(vi)_ for an aggregate amount of Losses exceeding the Special Escrow
Funds.

(e) Buyer (on behalf of all Buyer Indemnified Parties) acknowledges and agrees
that if a claim for Losses by a Buyer Indemnified Party hereunder could be
made as either: (i) a claim for breach of a representation or warranty under
_Section_ __ _ 8.2(a)(i)_ or _Section_ __ _ 8.2(b)(i)_ or (ii) a
claim under any other subsection of _Section_ __ _ 8.2(a)_ or _Section_ __ _
8.2(b)_, then such claim shall be made as a claim for a breach of a
representation and warranty under  _Section_ __ _ 8.2(a)(i)_ or _Section_ __
_ 8.2(b)(i)_, as applicable; provided, however, that the foregoing shall not
be applicable to any claim made pursuant to _Section_ __ _ 8.2(a)(vi)_.

 

(f) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary under this Agreement, except in
the case of any Fraud and breach of Fundamental Representation, the Indemnity
Escrow Funds are the sole source of recovery for the Buyer Indemnified Parties
against Sellers under _Section_ __ _ 8.2(a)(i)_ and _Section_ __ _
8.2(b)(i)_ and the Special Escrow Funds are the sole source of recovery for
the Buyer Indemnified Parties against Sellers under _Section_ __ _
8.2(a)(vi)_.

(g) Sellers shall not have any right of contribution, subrogation or other
recourse against the Company, the Subsidiaries, or their respective directors,
managers, officers, Employees, Affiliates, agents, attorneys, stockholders,
members, representatives, assigns or successors for any Third-Party Claims
asserted by Buyer Indemnified Parties, it being acknowledged and agreed that
the covenants and agreements of the members of the Company and the
Subsidiaries are solely for the benefit of the Buyer Indemnified Parties.

 



88

    

(h) The amount of any Losses subject to indemnification under this Article
VIII shall be reduced by (i) the amounts actually recovered by any
indemnified party under applicable insurance policies (including the RandW
Insurance Policy) with respect to claims related to such Losses (net, without
duplication, of (A) any increase in premiums, (B) retroactive premiums, (C)
premium adjustments, or (D) any deductible or retention amounts incurred in
obtaining such recovery), and if any indemnified party receives such insurance
proceeds after the settlement of any indemnification claim under this Article
VIII, such indemnified party shall refund to such indemnifying party the
amount of such insurance proceeds, up to the amount received in connection
with such indemnification claim (net of the total cost of any such recovery);
_provided_ , that no indemnified party shall be required to notify the
provider(s) of, or seek recovery for such Losses under, any insurance policies
prior to seeking recovery for such Losses from the indemnifying party
pursuant to, and subject to the limitations of, this _Article VIII_ and (ii)
the amount of any Tax benefits actually realized with respect to such Losses.

 

(i) Buyer acknowledges and agrees that the Sellers shall not have any
Liability under any provision of this Agreement for any Losses to the extent
that such Losses relate solely to (i) action taken by Buyer or any of its
Affiliates, or their Representatives or (ii) the Companys conduct of the
business, in each case, after the Closing Date. The Sellers shall not
be required to indemnify any Person to the extent of any Losses that a court
of competent jurisdiction shall have determined by final judgment to have
resulted from the bad faith, gross negligence or willful misconduct of Buyer
or any of its Affiliates; for the avoidance of any doubt, no Person shall be
entitled to recover the amount of any Losses more than once.

8.5  _Indemnity Payments_. Any payment Sellers are obligated, after
accounting for and subject to the limitations on indemnification set forth in
this Article VIII, to make to any Buyer Indemnified Parties pursuant to this
Article VIII shall be paid within five (5) Business Days after the date
notice of any sums due and owing is given to the Sellers Representative, (a)
first, from the Indemnity Escrow Funds, (b) next, from the RandW Insurance
Policy, (c) next, from the Special Escrow Funds, and (d) only then, from
Sellers by wire transfer of immediately available funds. Upon the expiration
of the General Survival Period, the Escrow Agent shall release the amount then
remaining in the Indemnity Escrow Account (to the extent not utilized to pay
Buyer for any indemnification claim) to Sellers, except that the Escrow Agent
shall retain an amount (up to the total amount then held by the Escrow Agent)
equal to the amount of claims for indemnification under this Article VIII
asserted prior to the expiration of the General Survival Period but not yet
resolved (" _Unresolved Claims_ "). The Indemnity Escrow Amount retained for
Unresolved Claims shall be released by the Escrow Agent (to the extent not
utilized to pay Buyer for any such claims resolved in favor of Buyer) upon
their resolution in accordance with this Article VIII and the Escrow
Agreement. Upon the expiration of the Special Survival Period, the Escrow
Agent shall release the amount then remaining in the Special Escrow Account
(to the extent not utilized to pay Buyer for any indemnification claim) to
Sellers, except that the Escrow Agent shall retain an amount (up to the total
amount then held by the Escrow Agent) equal to the amount of claims for
indemnification under _Section_ __ _ 8.2(a)(vi)_ asserted prior to the
expiration of the Special Survival Period but not yet resolved. Any payment
Buyer is obligated to make to any Seller Indemnified Party shall be paid to
such Seller Indemnified Party.

8.6 _Exclusive Remedies_. Except for the remedies set forth in _Section_ __ _
2.4_, _Section_ __ _ 6.9_, _Section_ __ _ 8.7_ and _Section_ __ _ 9.2_, the
parties acknowledge and agree that their sole and exclusive remedy (and the
sole and exclusive remedy of the Buyer Indemnified Parties and the Seller
Indemnified Parties) with respect to any and all claims (other than claims
arising from Fraud on the part of a

 



89

    

 party hereto in connection with the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement and claims for equitable relief made with respect to breaches of any
covenant or agreement contained in this Agreement) for any breach of any
representation, warranty, covenant, agreement or obligation set forth herein
or otherwise relating to the subject matter of this Agreement, shall be
pursuant to the provisions set forth in this Article VIII. Nothing in this
_Section_ __ _ 8.6_ shall limit any Persons right to seek and obtain any
equitable relief to which any Person shall be entitled hereunder or to seek
any remedy on account of Fraud or criminal activity by any party hereto.

8.7 _Tax Matters_.

 

(a) _Filing of Tax Returns; Payment of Taxes_.

 

(i) Sellers Representative shall file or cause to be filed all Tax Returns of
the Company and the Subsidiaries for all taxable periods ending on or before
the Closing Date, and shall timely pay any and all Taxes due with respect to
such returns. All Tax Returns described in this _Section_ __ _ 8.7(a)(i)_
shall be prepared in a manner consistent with prior practice, unless
otherwise required by Law. Sellers Representative shall provide Buyer with
copies of such completed Tax Returns at least twenty (20) days (or with
respect to non-income Tax Returns, a reasonable period) prior to the due date
for filing thereof, along with supporting work papers, for Buyers review and
approval, which approval shall not be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or
delayed. The Company and Buyer shall attempt in good faith to resolve any
disagreements regarding such Tax Returns prior to the due date for filing. In
the event that the Company and Buyer are unable to resolve any dispute with
respect to such Tax Return at least ten (10) days prior to the due date for
filing, such dispute shall be resolved pursuant to _Section_ __ _ 8.7(e)_,
which resolution shall be binding on the parties.

 

(ii) Following the Closing, Buyer shall cause to be timely filed all Tax
Returns (other than those Tax Returns described in  _Section_ __ _
8.7(a)(i)_) required to be filed by the Company and the Subsidiaries after the
Closing Date and pay or cause to be paid all Taxes shown due thereon.

 

(iii) Not later than ten (10) days prior to the due date for the payment of
Taxes on any Tax Returns which Buyer has the responsibility to cause to be
filed pursuant to _Section_ __ _ 8.7(a)(ii)_, Sellers Representative shall
pay to Buyer the amount of Taxes owed by Sellers pursuant to the provisions of
this _Section_ __ _ 8.7(a)_; it being understood that the Buyer shall
consult with Sellers Representative if there is a dispute regarding the
amount owed. Nothing contained herein shall excuse Sellers from their
indemnification obligations pursuant to Section 8.2.

 

(b) _Straddle Period Tax Allocation_. The Company and the Subsidiaries will,
unless prohibited by applicable Law, close each of their applicable taxable
periods as of the close of business on the Closing Date. If applicable Law
does not permit the Company and the Subsidiaries to close any of its taxable
years on the Closing Date or in any case in which a Tax is assessed
with respect to a taxable period which includes the Closing Date (but does
not begin or end on that day) (a " _Straddle Period_ "), the Taxes, if any,
attributable to a Straddle Period shall be allocated (i) to Sellers for
the period up to and including the close of business on the Closing Date, and
(ii) to Buyer for the period subsequent to the Closing Date. Any allocation of
income or deductions required to determine any Taxes attributable to a
Straddle Period shall be made by

 



90

    

 means of a deemed closing of the books and records of the Company and the
Subsidiaries as of the close of the Closing Date; provided, that exemptions,
allowances or deductions that are calculated on an annual basis (including,
but not limited to, depreciation and amortization deductions) shall be
allocated between the period ending on the Closing Date and the period after
the Closing Date in proportion to the number of days in each such period.
Notwithstanding the foregoing, property or ad valorem taxes attributable to a
Straddle Period shall be allocated to the period ending on the Closing Date
and the period after the Closing Date in proportion to the number of days in
each such period.

(c) _Tax Audits_.

 

(i) If notice of any Legal Proceeding with respect to Taxes of any of the
Company and the Subsidiaries shall be received by Buyer, the Company, a
Subsidiary or their Affiliates for which Sellers may reasonably be expected to
be liable pursuant to _Section_ __ _ 8.2(a)_ (a " _Tax Claim_ "), Buyer shall
within ten (10) days of receipt notify Sellers Representative in writing of
such Tax Claim; provided, that the failure of Buyer to give Sellers
Representative notice as provided herein shall not relieve Sellers of their
obligations under this  _Section_ __ _ 8.7_, except to the extent that any
Seller is actually and materially prejudiced as a result of such failure.

 

(ii) Sellers Representative shall have the right to assume control of any Tax
Claim relating solely to a Pre-Closing Tax Period (excluding any Straddle
Period) of the Company or a Subsidiary at the expense of Sellers
Representative, provided that (a) Buyer shall have the right to participate at
its expense in such Tax Claim along with counsel of its choice, and (b)
Sellers Representative shall not agree to a settlement or compromise of such
Tax Claim without the prior written consent of Buyer (which consent shall not
be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed) unless the settlement or
compromise (1) involves only a cash payment that is timely paid directly by
the Sellers or Sellers Representative, (2) includes a full and unqualified
release of Buyer, the Company Group and their Affiliates from all liability
in respect of such Tax Claim and (3) is not reasonably expected to impact any
future tax positions that Buyer, the Company Group or their Affiliates may
take. Buyer shall have the right to represent the interests of the Company or
a Subsidiary in any Tax Claim with respect to any Tax Claims relating to a
Straddle Period; provided, that (x) Sellers Representative shall have the
right to participate at its expense in such Tax Claim along with counsel of
its choice, and (y) Buyer shall not agree to a settlement or compromise of
such Tax Claim to the extent related to a Pre-Closing Tax Period without the
prior written consent of Sellers Representative (which consent shall not be
unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed).

(d) _Transfer Taxes_. Sellers shall be liable for and shall pay (and shall
indemnify and hold harmless the Buyer Indemnified Parties against) all sales,
use, stamp, documentary, filing, recording, transfer or similar fees or taxes
or governmental charges as levied by any Governmental Body (including any
interest and penalties) in connection with the transactions contemplated by
this Agreement.

(e)  _Disputes_. Any dispute as to any matter covered in this _Section_ __ _
8.7_ shall be resolved by the Independent Accountant. If any dispute with
respect to a Tax Return is not resolved prior to the due date of such
Tax Return, such Tax Return shall be filed in the manner which the party
responsible for preparing such Tax Return deems correct. The fees, costs and

 



91

    

 expenses of the Independent Accountant shall be allocated to and borne by
Buyer, on the one hand, and Sellers, on the other hand, based on the inverse
of the percentage that the Independent Accountants determination (before
such allocation) bears to the total amount of the total items in dispute as
originally submitted to the Independent Accountant. For example, should the
items in dispute total in amount to $1,000 and the Independent Accountant
awards $600 in favor of Sellers position, 60% of the costs of its review
would be borne by Buyer and 40% of the costs would be borne by Sellers.

 

(f) _Tax Refunds and Deductions_. Any Tax refund, rebate or credit for
overpayment of Taxes due to the Company or a Subsidiary with respect to a
Pre-Closing Tax Period that has not been included in the calculation of Final
Closing Working Capital or Transaction Expenses, shall be paid to the Sellers
Representative (on behalf of the Sellers) within 10 days after such refund,
rebate or credit has been received or realized by Buyer, a member of the
Company Group or their Affiliates; provided, that Sellers Representative (on
behalf of the Sellers) shall be entitled to the amount of refund, rebate or
credit for the overpayment of any Taxes described in _Section_ __ _ 8.7(d)_
for which Sellers are responsible for under _Section_ __ _ 8.7(d)_. Buyer
will, if the Sellers Representative reasonably requests, use commercially
reasonable efforts (with related costs and expenses to be borne by the
Sellers), to cause the Company or a Subsidiary, as applicable, to file for and
prosecute any claim for refunds or credits to which Sellers are entitled
hereunder. Buyer will permit the Seller Representative to control (at the
Seller Representatives expense) the prosecution and content of any such
refund or credit claim.

 

(g) _Tax and Deductions_. Notwithstanding any provision of this Agreement to
the contrary, all Tax deductions and credits attributable to the expenses of
the Company or a Subsidiary resulting from or related to the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement and paid or accrued on or before the Closing
Date for all applicable Tax purposes shall be reflected on the Tax Returns for
the Pre-Closing Tax Periods to the extent permitted by applicable Law,
including such Tax deductions and credits that are attributable to payments or
accruals of the following on or before the Closing Date:
Transaction Expenses, change-in-control compensation or other compensation
payments, and all interest expense paid on any indebtedness. Success-based
fees shall be deducted in accordance with Rev. Proc. 2011-29.

(h) _Post-Closing Actions_. Without the prior written consent of the Sellers
Representative, which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld, conditioned,
or delayed, Buyer shall not take any of the following actions (or cause the
Company or a Subsidiary to take any of the following actions) if such action
could reasonably be expected to result in any Tax liability that would form
the basis of a claim for indemnification under this Agreement by any Buyer
Indemnified Party: (A) file or amend any Tax Return of the Company or
a Subsidiary relating to a Pre-Closing Tax Period, (B) make or change any
material Tax election that has retroactive effect to any Pre-Closing Tax
Period, or (C) file or permit any member of the Company Group to file a Tax
Return relating to a Pre-Closing Tax Period in any jurisdiction in which such
member of the Company Group did not file such Tax Return prior to the
Closing. Buyer shall not make an election under Section 338 of the Code (or
any corresponding or similar provision of state or local Law) with respect to
Buyers acquisition of the Purchased Shares pursuant to this Agreement. 

 



92

    

(i) _Closing Tax Items_. Buyer covenants that it will be a limited liability
company that is wholly owned by a corporation on the Closing Date and will
file a consolidated United States federal income Tax Return with the Company
and all eligible Subsidiaries for the tax period that includes the day
immediately after the Closing Date. To the extent permitted by Law, the
Parties agree that (A) unless otherwise determined by Sellers Representative,
the Company will make an election under Revenue Procedure 2011-29 to deduct
70% of any Transaction Expenses that are success based fees as defined in
Treas. Reg. 1.263(a)-5(f); (B) no election shall be made by any Party under
Treas. Reg. 1.1502-76(b)(2)(ii)(D) (or any similar provision of state, local,
or non-U.S. Law) to ratably allocate items incurred by the Company or a
Subsidiary with respect to the taxable years ending on the Closing Date and
beginning the day following the Closing Date; (C) the Company will claim any
overpayment of Tax reflected on any Tax Return for the Pre-Closing Tax Period
(each a " _Pre-Closing Return_") as a refund (rather than as an estimated tax
payment applied to a post-Closing period); and (D) Buyer will cause the
Company to include on a Pre-Closing Return for the period ending on the
Closing Date, deductions with respect to the expenses of the Company that are
treated as compensation expense, which are permitted to be accrued on or
before the Closing Date, and are paid (i) on or prior to the Closing Date or
(ii) within two and one-half months after the Closing Date.

(j) _Tax Treatment of Escrow Funds_. The Parties intend that for income tax
purposes Sellers right to the Escrow Funds (and release of the Escrow Funds),
exclusive of any accrued or imputed interest thereon, will qualify for
installment sale reporting under the Code, and the Parties agree to
report consistent with such intent.

(k) _Assistance and Cooperation_. After the Closing Date, the Sellers
Representative, on the one hand, and Buyer, on the other hand, shall (and the
Buyer shall cause its Affiliates including the Company and the Subsidiaries
to): (i) assist the other Party in preparing any Tax Returns that such other
Party is responsible for preparing and/or filing in accordance with _Section_
__ _ 8.7(a)_, (ii) cooperate fully in responding to any inquiries from or
preparing for any audits of, or any disputes with a Governmental Body
regarding, any Taxes or Tax Returns of any member of the Company and the
Subsidiaries, and (iii) as reasonably requested, make available to the other
Party and to any Governmental Body all information, records, and documents
relating to Taxes of the Company and the Subsidiaries. In particular, Buyer
shall, and shall cause the Company and the Subsidiaries to, authorize and
direct their respective officers to execute and timely file with the proper
Governmental Body any the Pre-Closing Returns, and Buyer shall provide the
Sellers Representative with a copy of each such Tax Return promptly after
filing. Such cooperation and information shall include providing copies of
relevant Tax Returns or portions thereof, together with
accompanying schedules, related work papers and documents relating to rulings
or other determinations by Governmental Bodies. Buyer, the Company and the
Subsidiaries shall retain all Tax Returns, schedules and work papers, records,
and other documents in its possession relating to Tax matters of the Company
and the Subsidiaries for any taxable period beginning before the Closing Date
until the expiration of the statute of limitations of the taxable periods to
which such Tax Returns and other documents relate.

8.8 _Tax Treatment of Indemnity Payments_. Sellers and Buyer agree to treat
any indemnity payment made pursuant to this  _Article VIII_ as an adjustment
to the Purchase Price for all Tax purposes to the extent permitted by
applicable Law. If, notwithstanding the treatment required by the preceding
sentence, any indemnification payment under Article VIII is determined to be
taxable to the party receiving such payment by any Taxing Authority, the
paying party shall also indemnify the party receiving such payment for any
Taxes incurred by reason of the receipt of such payment and any Losses
incurred by the party receiving such payment in connection with such Taxes
(or any asserted deficiency, claim, demand, action, suit, proceeding, judgment
or assessment, including the defense or settlement thereof, relating to such
Taxes).

ARTICLE IX

 

MISCELLANEOUS

9.1  _Expenses_. Except as otherwise expressly provided in this Agreement,
Sellers, on the one hand, and Buyer, on the other hand, shall each bear their
own expenses incurred in connection with the negotiation and execution of this
Agreement and each other agreement, document and instrument contemplated by
this Agreement and the consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby
and thereby.

 

9.2 _Specific Performance_. The parties hereto acknowledge and agree that a
breach of this Agreement by the Sellers or, before Closing, the Company would
cause irreparable damage to Buyer and that Buyer will not have an adequate
remedy at Law and that a breach of this Agreement by the Buyer or Parent would
cause irreparable damage to Sellers and the Company and that Sellers and
the Company will not have an adequate remedy at Law. Therefore, the
obligations of each party under this Agreement, including Sellers obligations
to sell the Stock and 1st Global Insurance Stock to Buyer, and Buyers
obligation (guaranteed by Parent) to buy the Stock and 1st Global Insurance
Stock from Sellers in exchange for the Purchase Price, shall be enforceable by
a decree of specific performance issued by any court of competent
jurisdiction, and appropriate injunctive relief may be applied for and
granted in connection therewith. Such remedies shall, however, be cumulative
and not exclusive and shall be in addition to any other remedies which any
party may have under this Agreement or otherwise.

 

9.3 _Submission to Jurisdiction; Consent to Service of Process_.

 

(a) The parties hereby irrevocably submit to the exclusive jurisdiction of any
federal or state court located within Dallas, Texas over any dispute arising
out of or relating to this Agreement or any of the transactions contemplated
hereby and each party hereby irrevocably agrees that all claims in respect of
such dispute or any suit, action proceeding related thereto may be heard
and determined in such courts. The parties hereby irrevocably waive, to the
fullest extent permitted by applicable Law, any objection which they may now
or hereafter have to the laying of venue of any such dispute brought in such
court or any defense of inconvenient forum for the maintenance of such
dispute. Each of the parties agrees that a judgment in any such dispute may be
enforced in other jurisdictions by suit on the judgment or in any other manner
provided by Law.

 

(b) Each of the parties hereby consents to process being served by any party
in any suit, action or proceeding by delivery of a copy thereof in accordance
with the provisions of _Section_ __ _ 9.6_.

9.4 _Entire Agreement; Amendments and Waivers_. This Agreement (including the
schedules and exhibits hereto), the Seller Documents, the Company Documents,
and the Buyer Documents represent the entire understanding and agreement
between the parties with respect to the subject matter hereof, supersede all
prior oral discussions and written agreements between the parties with respect
to the subject matter hereof (including any term sheet or similar agreement or

 



94

    

 document relating to the transactions contemplated hereby), and can be
amended, supplemented or changed, and any provision hereof can be waived, only
by written instrument making specific reference to this Agreement signed by
the party against whom enforcement of any such amendment, supplement,
modification or waiver is sought. The parties represent and acknowledge that
the only representations and warranties of the Sellers or the Founder Seller
with respect to the subject matter hereof are as set forth in _Articles III_
and _IV_ hereof. The parties hereto represent that they relied on their own
judgment in entering into this Agreement. No action taken pursuant to this
Agreement, including any investigation by or on behalf of any party, shall be
deemed to constitute a waiver by the party taking such action of compliance
with any representation, warranty, covenant or agreement contained herein. The
waiver by any party of a breach of any provision of this Agreement shall not
operate or be construed as a further or continuing waiver of such breach or as
a waiver of any other or subsequent breach. A breach of this Agreement shall
not preclude injunctive relief. No failure on the part of any party to
exercise, and no delay in exercising, any right, power or remedy hereunder
shall operate as a waiver thereof, nor shall any single or partial exercise of
such right, power or remedy by such party preclude any other or further
exercise thereof or the exercise of any other right, power or remedy,
including injunctive relief. All remedies hereunder are cumulative and are not
exclusive of any other remedies provided by law or equity.

 

9.5 _Governing Law_. This Agreement shall be governed by and construed in
accordance with the laws of the State of Delaware applicable to contracts
made and performed in such State, without reference to such States or any
other states or other jurisdictions principles of conflict of laws.

 

9.6 _Notices_. All notices and other communications under this Agreement shall
be in writing and shall be deemed given (a) when delivered personally by hand
(with written confirmation of receipt), (b) when sent by email (provided, that
for notice to be effective under this clause (b), a copy of such notice must
be sent by overnight courier (with written confirmation of delivery) not more
than one (1) Business Day after the sending of such email) or (c) one Business
Day following the day sent by overnight courier (with written confirmation of
receipt), in each case at the addresses and email addresses set forth on
_Schedule 9.6_ (or to such other address or email address as a party may have
specified by notice given to the other party pursuant to this provision).

 

9.7 _Severability_. If any term or other provision of this Agreement is
invalid, illegal, or incapable of being enforced by any Law or public policy,
all other terms or provisions of this Agreement shall nevertheless remain in
full force and effect so long as the economic or legal substance of the
transactions contemplated hereby is not affected in any manner materially
adverse to any party. Upon such determination that any term or other
provision is invalid, illegal, or incapable of being enforced, such provision
shall be modified so as to effect the original intent of the parties as
closely as possible in an acceptable manner in order that the transactions
contemplated hereby are consummated as originally contemplated to the greatest
extent possible.

9.8  _Binding Effect; Assignment_. This Agreement shall be binding upon and
inure to the benefit of the parties and their respective successors and
permitted assigns. Nothing in this Agreement shall create or be deemed to
create any third-party beneficiary rights in any person or entity not a party
to this Agreement except as provided below or as otherwise expressly provided

 



95

    

 herein. No assignment of this Agreement or of any rights or obligations
hereunder may be made by any party hereto (by operation of law or otherwise)
without the prior written consent of Buyer and Sellers Representative and
any attempted assignment without the required consents shall be void;
provided, that Buyer may assign this Agreement and any or all rights or
obligations hereunder or thereunder (including Buyers rights to purchase and
receive the Stock and 1st Global Insurance Stock and Buyers rights to seek
indemnification hereunder) to any Affiliate of Buyer, any Person from which it
has borrowed money or any Person to which Buyer or any of its
Affiliates proposes to sell all or substantially all of the Stock and 1st
Global Insurance Stock. Upon any such permitted assignment, the references in
this Agreement to Buyer shall also apply to any such assignee unless the
context otherwise requires.

 

9.9 _Non-Recourse_. No past, present or future director, officer, employee,
incorporator, member, partner, equity holder, Affiliate, agent, attorney or
representative of Buyer or its Affiliates shall have any liability for any
obligations or liabilities of Buyer under this Agreement or the Buyer
Documents of or for any claim based on, in respect of, or by reason of, the
transactions contemplated hereby and thereby.

9.10 _Counterparts_. This Agreement may be executed in one or more
counterparts, each of which will be deemed to be an original copy of this
Agreement and all of which, when taken together, will be deemed to constitute
one and the same agreement. In the event that a signature is delivered by
facsimile transmission or by e-mail delivery of a ".pdf" or other electronic
format data file, such signature shall create a valid and binding obligation
of the party executing (or on whose behalf such signature is executed) with
the same force and effect as if such facsimile, ".pdf" or other electronic
format signature page were an original thereof.

 

9.11 _Waiver of Jury Trial_. EACH OF THE PARTIES HEREBY WAIVES, TO THE FULLEST
EXTENT PERMITTED BY LAW, ANY RIGHT TO TRIAL BY JURY OF ANY CLAIM, DEMAND,
ACTION, OR CAUSE OF ACTION (I) ARISING UNDER THIS AGREEMENT OR (II) IN ANY WAY
CONNECTED WITH OR RELATED OR INCIDENTAL TO THE DEALINGS OF THE PARTIES IN
RESPECT OF THIS AGREEMENT OR ANY OF THE TRANSACTIONS RELATED HERETO, IN EACH
CASE WHETHER NOW EXISTING OR HEREAFTER ARISING, AND WHETHER IN CONTRACT, TORT,
EQUITY, OR OTHERWISE. EACH OF THE PARTIES HEREBY AGREES AND CONSENTS THAT ANY
SUCH CLAIM, DEMAND, ACTION, OR CAUSE OF ACTION SHALL BE DECIDED BY COURT TRIAL
WITHOUT A JURY AND THAT THE PARTIES MAY FILE AN ORIGINAL COUNTERPART OF A
COPY OF THIS AGREEMENT WITH ANY COURT AS WRITTEN EVIDENCE OF THE CONSENT OF
THE PARTIES TO THE WAIVER OF THEIR RIGHT TO TRIAL BY JURY.

 

9.12 _Sellers_ __ _Representative_.

 

(a) Sellers hereby irrevocably nominate, constitute and appoint Sellers
Representative as the agent, agent for service of process and true and lawful
attorney-in-fact of each Seller, individually, and to act on behalf of all
Sellers, collectively and individually, with full power of substitution,
in the name, place and stead of any Seller with respect to any matter under
this Agreement or the Escrow Agreement, including the exercise of the power to
(i) execute, deliver, acknowledge, certify and file (in the name of Sellers,
any Seller or otherwise) any

 



96

    

 documents or consents and otherwise take any actions, and make or receive
any payments or disbursements, that Sellers Representative may, in its sole
discretion, determine to be necessary, desirable or appropriate, on behalf of
Sellers, in connection with any matter contemplated in _Section_ __ _ 2.4_,
_Section_ __ _ 7.3_, _Section_ __ _ 7.4_, _Article VIII,_   _Section_ __ _
9.3_ or _Section_ __ _ 9.8_ (including negotiating, entering into compromises
or settlements of and resolving any dispute or litigation with respect to any
such matters); and (ii) give and receive notices and communications under
this Agreement or the Escrow Agreement. Sellers Representative hereby accepts
its appointment as Sellers Representative. The power of attorney granted in
this  _Section_ __ _ 9.12_ is coupled with an interest and irrevocable, may
be delegated by Sellers Representative and shall survive the death,
incapacity, dissolution or liquidation of each Seller.

 

(b) A decision, act, consent or instruction of Sellers Representative shall
constitute a decision of Sellers and shall be final, binding and conclusive
upon Sellers. Buyer, the Company and the Subsidiaries are hereby relieved from
any Liability to any Person for any acts done by them in accordance with such
decision, act, consent or instruction of Sellers
Representative. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this
Agreement, Buyer (and, if applicable, any Buyer Indemnified Party) shall be
entitled to (i) deal exclusively with Sellers Representative on all matters
relating to  _Section_ __ _ 2.4_, _Section_ __ _ 7.3_, _Section_ __ _
7.4_, _Article VIII_ , _Section_ __ _ 9.3_ or _Section_ __ _ 9.8_ and (ii)
rely conclusively (without further evidence of any kind whatsoever) on any
document executed or purported to be executed on behalf of any Seller by
Sellers Representative, and on any other action taken or purported to be
taken on behalf of any Seller by Sellers Representative, as fully binding
upon such Seller. Each Seller hereby confirms each and every action to be
taken by Sellers Representative pursuant to this power of attorney as if it
were such Sellers own and waives any right to make any claim against
Sellers Representative that may arise, directly or indirectly, as a result of
Sellers Representatives actions by virtue of this power of attorney.

 

(c) If a successor to Sellers Representative is appointed pursuant to the
terms of the Joinder, Sellers Representative shall promptly thereafter
notify Buyer of the identity of such successor; provided, that such changes to
Sellers Representative shall be effective upon the later of the date
indicated in such notice or the date such notice is received by
Buyer; provided, further, that until such notice is received, Buyer shall be
entitled to rely on the decisions, actions, consents and instructions of the
prior Sellers Representative as described in _Section_ __ _ 9.12(b)_. Any
such successor shall become "Sellers Representative" for purposes of this
Agreement, and all power, authority, rights and privileges conferred in this
Agreement to Sellers Representative will apply to any successor
Sellers Representative. If for any reason the Sellers Representative is
unable to act in its capacity as the Sellers Representative or fails to act
in its capacity as the Sellers Representative within a reasonable period of
time following a request for action from the Buyer any time or if for any
reason there is no Sellers Representative at any time, all references herein
to Sellers Representative shall be deemed to refer to the successor Sellers
Representative as designated in the Joinder or by the number of Sellers
holding a majority of the Stock prior to the Closing. The Sellers acknowledge
and agree that, upon the death or disability of Stephen A. Batman, or upon the
resignation of Stephen A. Batman as the managing member of Sellers
Representative, H. N. Cunningham shall be appointed as "Sellers
Representative" under this Agreement with no further action by any Person
(other than the delivery of notice as set forth in this  _Section_ __ _
9.12(c)_.

 



97

    

(d) No bond shall be required of Sellers Representative. Sellers
Representative shall not be liable to any Seller for any act done or omitted
hereunder as Sellers Representative, unless such action or omission results
from or arises out of Fraud, willful misconduct, gross negligence or bad faith
on the part of Sellers Representative, with the understanding that any act
done or omitted pursuant to the advice of counsel shall be considered
conclusive evidence of Sellers Representatives good faith. Sellers
Representative shall be entitled to be indemnified by Sellers, on a joint and
several basis, for any loss, liability or expense incurred without gross
negligence or willful misconduct on the part of Sellers Representative with
respect to any matter arising out of or in connection with the acceptance or
administration of its duties hereunder. Sellers Representative shall be
entitled to recover from Sellers, on a joint and several basis, any out-of-
pocket costs and expenses reasonably incurred by Sellers Representative in
good faith and in connection with actions taken by Sellers
Representative pursuant to this Agreement (including the hiring of
accountants and legal counsel and the incurring of accounting and legal fees
and costs) that is in excess of the Representative Fund. Sellers
Representative shall keep reasonably detailed records of the costs and
expenses for which it seeks reimbursement as herein provided. Anywhere in the
Agreement where Sellers Representative is obligated to pay any amount after
the Closing Date in its capacity as Sellers Representative, the obligation
to pay such amount shall be satisfied solely from the Representative Fund.

(e) Sellers Representative hereby represents and warrants that it is duly
organized and validly existing under the Laws of the jurisdiction in which it
is organized, and that Stephen A. Batman is, and will be at all relevant
times, the sole managing member of the Sellers Representative, authorized
with all requisite legal power and authority to take any action required to be
taken by the Sellers Representative. The Sellers Representative also
represents and warrants that the Sellers Representative has, and will have
at all relevant times, the requisite power and authority to execute any
documents or other agreements required to be executed by Sellers
Representative hereunder. The Sellers Representative also represents and
warrants that the Representative Fund will be held by the Sellers
Representative in a segregated account until disbursed to the Sellers and not
be used by Sellers Representative in any manner other than as
contemplated pursuant to the terms of this Agreement and the Joinder. The
Sellers Representative knows of no reason it cannot act as Sellers
Representative pursuant to the terms hereof.

 

9.13 _Legal Representation_. In any proceeding by or against Buyer, the
Parent, the Company (after the Closing) or any Subsidiary (after the Closing)
or any director, manager, officer, employee, stockholder or Affiliate of any
of the foregoing (each, a " _Buyer Party_ ") wherein any Buyer Party asserts
or prosecutes any claim under, or otherwise seeks to enforce, this Agreement,
Buyer and Parent agree in connection with such proceeding (a) that no Buyer
Party or counsel therefor will move to seek disqualification of Foley and
Lardner, LLP (" _Foley_ "); (b) to waive any right any Buyer Party may have
to assert the attorney-client privilege against Foley or the Sellers
Representative, any Seller or any of their respective Affiliates with respect
to any communication with or information contained in Foleys possession or
files; and (c) to consent to the representation of the Sellers
Representative, any Seller or any of their respective Affiliates by Foley,
notwithstanding that Foley has or may have represented the
Sellers Representative, any Seller or any of their respective Affiliates
(including the Subsidiaries) as counsel in connection with any matter,
including any transaction (including the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement), negotiation, investigation, proceeding or action, prior to or
after the Closing. This consent and waiver extends to Foleys representing the
Sellers Representative, any Seller or any of their

 



98

    

 respective Affiliates against any Buyer Party in litigation, arbitration or
mediation in connection with this Agreement or the transactions contemplated
by this Agreement. Any privilege attaching as a result of Foleys
representing the Company or any Subsidiary in connection with the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement shall survive the Closing and shall remain in
effect, provided that such privilege from and after the Closing shall be
assigned to and controlled by the Sellers Representative. In furtherance of
the foregoing, each of the parties agrees to take the steps reasonably
necessary to ensure that any privilege attaching as a result of Foley
representing the Company or any Subsidiary in connection with the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement shall survive the Closing, remain
in effect and be assigned to and controlled by the Sellers Representative.
