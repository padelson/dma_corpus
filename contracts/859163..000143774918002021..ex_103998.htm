unexercised immediately prior to the Effective Time shall be, by virtue of the

Section 3.4 _Dissenting Shares_. Notwithstanding any provision of this
Agreement to the contrary, including _Section 3.1_ , Shares issued and
outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time (other than Shares
cancelled in accordance with _Section 3.1(a)_ ) and held by a holder who has
not voted in favor of adoption of this Agreement or consented thereto in
writing and who has properly exercised appraisal rights of such Shares in
accordance with Section 262 of the DGCL (such Shares being referred to
collectively as the " _Dissenting Shares_ " until such time as such holder
fails to perfect or otherwise loses such holder's appraisal rights under the
DGCL with respect to such Shares) shall not be converted into a right to
receive a portion of the Merger Consideration, but instead shall be entitled
to only such rights as are granted by Section 262 of the DGCL; _provided,
however,_ that if, after the Effective Time, such holder fails to perfect,
withdraws or loses such holder's right to appraisal pursuant to Section 262 of
the DGCL or if a court of competent jurisdiction shall determine that such
holder is not entitled to the relief provided by Section 262 of the DGCL, such
Shares shall be treated as if they had been converted as of the Effective Time
into the right to receive the portion of the Merger Consideration, if any, to
which such holder is entitled pursuant to _Section 3.1_ , without interest
thereon. The Company shall provide Parent prompt written notice of any demands
received by the Company for appraisal of Shares, any withdrawal of any such
demand and any other demand, notice or instrument delivered to the Company
prior to the Effective Time pursuant to the DGCL that relates to such demand,
and Parent shall have the opportunity and right to direct all negotiations and
proceedings with respect to such demands. Except with the prior written
consent of Parent (not to be unreasonably withheld), the Company shall not
make any payment with respect to, or settle or offer to settle, any such
demands.

  



  

Section 3.5 _Surrender and Payment_.

  



  

(a) At the Effective Time, all Shares, Options and Company Warrants
outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time shall automatically be
cancelled and retired and shall cease to exist, and, subject to _Section 3.4_
, each holder of a certificate formerly representing any Shares (each, a "
_Certificate_ ") and each holder of record of an Option or Company Warrant
shall cease to have any rights as a stockholder of the Company or a holder of
Options or Company Warrants, as applicable.

  



  

(b) Prior to the Effective Time, Parent shall appoint an exchange agent
reasonably acceptable to the Company (the " _Exchange Agent_ ") to act as the
exchange agent in the Merger.

  



  

(c) As promptly as practicable following the Closing Date and in any event
not later than two Business Days thereafter, Parent shall cause the Exchange
Agent to mail to each holder of Company Common Stock and each holder of
Company Preferred Stock a letter of transmittal in substantially the form
attached as _Exhibit_ _C_ (a " _Letter of Transmittal_ ") and instructions for
use in effecting the surrender of Certificates in exchange for the applicable
portion of Merger Consideration pursuant to _Section 3.1_. The Exchange Agent
shall, no later than three Business Days after receipt of a Certificate,
together with a Letter of Transmittal duly completed and validly executed in
accordance with the instructions thereto, and any other customary documents
that the Exchange Agent may reasonably require in connection therewith
(including a completed Form W-8 or Form W-9, as applicable), pay to the holder
of such Certificate a cash amount as provided in _Section 3.1_ with respect to
such Certificate so surrendered and the Certificate shall forthwith be
cancelled. Unless otherwise provided herein, no interest shall be paid or
shall accrue on any cash payable upon surrender of any Certificate. Until so
surrendered, each outstanding Certificate that prior to the Effective Time
represented shares of Company Common Stock or Company Preferred Stock (other
than Dissenting Shares) shall be deemed from and after the Effective Time, for
all purposes, to evidence the right to receive the portion of the Merger
Consideration as provided in _Section 3.1_. If after the Effective Time, any
Certificate is presented to the Exchange Agent, it shall be cancelled and
exchanged as provided in this _Section 3.4_.

  



  

   

  



  

(d) With respect to Optionholders who are current employees of the Company
or any Subsidiary, Parent shall, no later than ten Business Days (or the next
regularly scheduled payroll cycle) after Closing (subject to receipt by Parent
or the Company of any customary documents that Parent may reasonably require
in connection therewith (including a completed Form W-8 or Form W-9, as
applicable)), cause the Company's current payroll provider, on behalf of the
Company, to deliver such Optionholder the cash amount such Optionholder has
the right to receive pursuant to _Section 3.2(a)_ (net of any deductions and
withholdings required under _Section 3.9_ below). As promptly as practicable
following the Closing Date and in any event not later than two Business Days
thereafter, Parent shall cause the Exchange Agent to mail to each Optionholder
who is not a current employee of the Company or any Subsidiary a letter
requesting a completed Form W-8 or Form W-9, as applicable, from such
Optionholder, verification of such Optionholder's address and such other
information as may be required to pay the applicable portion of Merger
Consideration to such Optionholder. Upon receipt by the Exchange Agent of the
completed Form W-8 or Form W-9, as applicable, verification of address and
such other information as required from any such Optionholder, the Exchange
Agent shall, no later than three Business Days thereafter, pay to such
Optionholder a cash amount as provided in _Section 3.2(a)_. Unless otherwise
provided herein, no interest shall be paid or shall accrue on any cash payable
upon delivery of any consideration pursuant to _Section 3.2(a)_.

  



  

(e) Each Company Stockholder shall also be entitled to any amounts that
may be payable in the future in respect of the Shares formerly represented by
such Certificate from the Escrow Funds as provided in this Agreement and the
Escrow Agreement and on account of the Post-Closing Adjustment, at the
respective time and subject to the contingencies specified herein and therein.
Unless otherwise provided herein, no interest shall be paid or accrued for the
benefit of Company Stockholders on the Merger Consideration.

  



  

(f) If any portion of the Merger Consideration is to be paid to a Person
other than the Person in whose name the surrendered Certificate is registered,
it shall be a condition to such payment that (i) such Certificate shall be
properly endorsed or shall otherwise be in proper form for transfer, and (ii)
the Person requesting such payment shall pay to the Exchange Agent any
transfer or other Tax required as a result of such payment to a Person other
than the registered holder of such Certificate or establish to the reasonable
satisfaction of the Exchange Agent that such Tax has been paid or is not
payable.

  



  

(g) Any portion of the Merger Consideration or any other consideration
payable hereunder that remains unclaimed by the Company Stockholders or
Optionholders 12 months after the Effective Time shall be returned to Parent,
upon demand, and any such Company Stockholder who has not exchanged
Certificates for the Merger Consideration or any other such consideration in
accordance with this _Section 3.4_ prior to that time shall thereafter look
only to Parent for payment of the Merger Consideration or any other such
consideration; _provided, however,_ that any such portion of the Merger
Consideration payable from the Escrow Funds shall be held and distributed to
the Persons entitled thereof in accordance with the terms of this Agreement
and the Escrow Agreement, at the respective times and subject to the
contingencies specified herein and therein and any portion of the Post-Closing
Adjustment to which the Company Stockholders may become entitled shall become
payable at the times and subject to the contingencies specified herein.
Notwithstanding the foregoing, Parent shall not be liable to any holder of
Certificates or Options for any amounts paid to a public official pursuant to
applicable abandoned property, escheat or similar Laws. Any amounts remaining
unclaimed by Company Stockholders or Optionholders 24 months after the
Effective Time (or such earlier date, immediately prior to such time when the
amounts would otherwise escheat to or become property of any Governmental
Authority) shall become, to the extent permitted by applicable Law, the
property of Parent free and clear of any claims or interest of any Person
previously entitled thereto.

  



  

   

  



  

(h) Any portion of the Merger Consideration made available to the Exchange
Agent in respect of any Dissenting Shares shall be returned to Parent, upon
demand.

  



  

Section 3.6 _Escrow Funds_. In accordance with the Escrow Agreement,
Parent shall deposit or cause to be deposited with the Escrow Agent:

  



  

(a) the Indemnification Escrow Amount (such amount, including any interest
or other amounts earned thereon and less any disbursements therefrom in
accordance with the Escrow Agreement, the " _Indemnification Escrow Fund_ "),
to be held for the purpose of securing the indemnification obligations of the
Company Stockholders set forth in this Agreement and the obligations pursuant
to _Section 3.11(d)_ ; and

  



  

(b) the Purchase Price Adjustment Escrow Amount (such amount, including
any interest or other amounts earned thereon and less any disbursements
therefrom in accordance with the Escrow Agreement, the " _Purchase Price
Adjustment Escrow Fund_ "), to be held for the purpose of securing the
obligations of the Company Stockholders in _Section 3.11(d)_ ; and

  



  

(c) the Stockholder Representative Escrow Amount (such amount, including
any interest or other amounts earned thereon and less any disbursements
therefrom in accordance with the Escrow Agreement, the " _Stockholder
Representative Escrow Fund_ " and together, with the Indemnification Escrow
Fund and the Purchase Price Adjustment Escrow Fund, the " _Escrow Funds_ "),
to be held for the purpose of funding any expenses of Stockholder
Representative arising in connection with the administration of Stockholder
Representative's duties in this Agreement after the Effective Time.

  



  

Section 3.7 _No Further Ownership Rights in Company Common Stock and
Options_. All Merger Consideration paid or payable upon the surrender of
Certificates, and all Merger Consideration paid or payable in respect of the
Options, in accordance with the terms hereof shall be deemed to have been paid
or payable in full satisfaction of all rights pertaining to the Shares
formerly represented by such Certificate and such Options, and from and after
the Effective Time, there shall be no further registration of transfers of
Shares on the stock transfer books of the Surviving Corporation. If, after the
Effective Time, Certificates are presented to the Surviving Corporation, they
shall be cancelled and exchanged for the Merger Consideration provided for,
and in accordance with the procedures set forth, in this _Article III_ and
elsewhere in this Agreement.

  



  

   

  



  

Section 3.8 _Adjustments_. Without limiting the other provisions of this
Agreement, if at any time during the period between the date of this Agreement
and the Effective Time, any change in the outstanding shares of capital stock
of the Company shall occur, including by reason of any reclassification,
recapitalization, stock split (including reverse stock split) or combination,
exchange or readjustment of shares, or any stock dividend or distribution paid
in stock, the Merger Consideration and any other amounts payable pursuant to
this Agreement shall be appropriately adjusted to reflect such change.

  



  

Section 3.9 _Withholding Rights_. Each of the Exchange Agent, Parent,
Merger Subsidiary and the Surviving Corporation shall be entitled to deduct
and withhold from the consideration otherwise payable to any Person pursuant
to this Agreement such amounts as may be required to be deducted and withheld
with respect to the making of such payment under any provision of Tax Law. To
the extent that amounts are so deducted and withheld by the Exchange Agent,
Parent, Merger Subsidiary or the Surviving Corporation, as the case may be,
and remitted to the appropriate Tax Authority, such amounts shall be treated
for all purposes of this Agreement as having been paid to the Person in
respect of which the Exchange Agent, Parent, Merger Subsidiary or the
Surviving Corporation, as the case may be, made such deduction and
withholding.

  



  

Section 3.10 _Lost Certificates_. If any Certificate shall have been
lost, stolen or destroyed, upon the making of an affidavit of that fact by the
Person claiming such Certificate to be lost, stolen or destroyed and, if
required by Parent, the posting by such Person of a bond, in such reasonable
amount as Parent may direct, as indemnity against any claim that may be made
against it with respect to such Certificate, the Exchange Agent shall issue,
in exchange for such lost, stolen or destroyed Certificate, the Merger
Consideration to be paid in respect of the Shares formerly represented by such
Certificate as contemplated under this _Article III_.

  



  

Section 3.11 _Working Capital Adjustment_.

  



  

(a) Closing Adjustment.

  



  

(i) " _Working Capital_ " shall be the amount equal to the following
calculation: receivables, inventory, prepaid expenses and other non-cash
current assets of the Company, less current liabilities in each case as
determined in accordance with GAAP and, to the extent not inconsistent with
GAAP, the Company's past accounting practices and principles. The parties
acknowledge and agree that _Schedule_ _3.11_ sets forth a sample work sheet of
Working Capital (and the components thereof) based upon the Working Capital as
of October 31, 2017 (the " _Sample Working Capital Calculation_ "). The
Company shall accrue as a current liability in the Sample Working Capital
Calculation, the Estimated Working Capital Statement and the Closing Working
Capital Statement the employer portion of all withholding Taxes payable with
respect to all Options outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time.

  



  

   

  



  

(ii) At least three Business Days before the Closing, the Company shall
prepare and deliver to Parent a statement setting forth its good faith
estimate of Closing Working Capital (the " _Estimated Closing Working Capital_
"), which statement shall contain an estimated balance sheet of the Company as
of the Closing Date (without giving effect to the transactions contemplated
herein), a calculation of Estimated Closing Working Capital (the " _Estimated
Closing Working Capital Statement_ "), and a certificate of the Chief
Financial Officer of the Company that the Estimated Closing Working Capital
Statement was prepared in accordance with GAAP and the Sample Working Capital
Calculation. For purposes of this _Section_ _3.11_ and this Agreement, the
Company shall be credited with an increase to Working Capital of (A) up to $2
million representing amounts actually invested after September 29, 2017, in
land, buildings, and other capital investment in Vietnam, _plus_ (B) the
amount of the prepayment penalty and exit fees (which shall be set forth in
the payoff letter from NH Expansion Fund Holdings, LP to be delivered to
Parent at Closing) payable to NH Expansion Fund Holdings, LP in satisfaction
in full of the Company Indebtedness payable thereto.

  



  

(iii) The " _Estimated Closing Adjustment_ " shall be an amount equal to
the Estimated Closing Working Capital minus $10,329,844 (the " _Target Working
Capital_ ").

  



  

(b) Post-Closing Adjustment.

  



  

(i) Within 90 days after the Closing Date, Parent shall prepare and
deliver to Stockholder Representative a statement setting forth its
calculation of Closing Working Capital, which statement shall contain a
balance sheet of the Company as of the Closing Date (without giving effect to
the transactions contemplated herein), a calculation of Closing Working
Capital (the " _Closing Working Capital Statement_ ") and a certificate of the
Chief Financial Officer of Parent that the Closing Working Capital Statement
was prepared in accordance with GAAP applied using the same accounting
methods, practices, principles, policies and procedures, with consistent
classifications, judgments and valuation and estimation methodologies that
were used in the preparation of the Audited Financial Statements for the most
recent fiscal year end as if such Closing Working Capital Statement was being
prepared and audited as of a fiscal year end.

  



  

(ii) The " _Post-Closing Adjustment_ " shall be an amount equal to the
Closing Working Capital minus the Estimated Closing Working Capital;
_provided, however,_ that (A) if the result of such calculation is a positive
number, it shall be capped at $1,500,000, and (B) if the result of such
calculation is a negative number, it shall be capped at ($1,500,000).

  



  

(c) Examination and Review.

  



  

(i) _Examination_. After receipt of the Closing Working Capital
Statement, Stockholder Representative shall have 30 days (the " _Review
Period_ ") to review the Closing Working Capital Statement. During the Review
Period, Stockholder Representative and its accountants shall have full access
to the books and records of the Surviving Corporation, the personnel of, and
work papers prepared by, Parent and/or its accountants to the extent that they
relate to the Closing Working Capital Statement and to such historical
financial information (to the extent in Parent's possession) relating to the
Closing Working Capital Statement as Stockholder Representative may reasonably
request for the purpose of reviewing the Closing Working Capital Statement and
to prepare a Statement of Objections (defined below), provided, that such
access shall be in a manner that does not interfere with the normal business
operations of Parent or the Surviving Corporation.

  



  

   

  



  

(ii) _Objection_. On or prior to the last day of the Review Period,
Stockholder Representative may object to the Closing Working Capital Statement
by delivering to Parent a written statement setting forth its objections in
reasonable detail, indicating each disputed item or amount and the basis for
its disagreement therewith (the " _Statement of Objections_ "). If Stockholder
Representative fails to deliver the Statement of Objections before the
expiration of the Review Period, the Closing Working Capital Statement and the
Post-Closing Adjustment, as the case may be, reflected in the Closing Working
Capital Statement shall be deemed to have been accepted by Stockholder
Representative. If Stockholder Representative delivers the Statement of
Objections before the expiration of the Review Period, Parent and Stockholder
Representative shall negotiate in good faith to resolve such objections within
30 days after the delivery of the Statement of Objections (the " _Resolution
Period_ "), and, if the same are so resolved within the Resolution Period, the
Post-Closing Adjustment and the Closing Working Capital Statement with such
changes as may have been previously agreed in writing by Parent and
Stockholder Representative, shall be final and binding.

  



  

(iii) _Resolution of Disputes_. If Stockholder Representative and Parent
fail to reach an agreement with respect to all of the matters set forth in the
Statement of Objections before expiration of the Resolution Period, then any
amounts remaining in dispute (" _Disputed Amounts_ " and any amounts not so
disputed, the " _Undisputed Amounts_ ") shall be submitted for resolution to
Mayer Hoffman McCann P.C. or, if Mayer Hoffman McCann P.C. is unable or
unwilling to serve, Parent and Stockholder Representative shall appoint by
mutual agreement an impartial nationally recognized firm of independent
certified public accountants (the " _Independent Accountant_ ") who, acting as
experts and not arbitrators, shall resolve the Disputed Amounts only and make
any adjustments to the Post-Closing Adjustment, as the case may be, and the
Closing Working Capital Statement. The Parties hereto agree that all
adjustments shall be made without regard to materiality. The Independent
Accountant shall only decide the specific items under dispute by the Parties
and their decision for each Disputed Amount must be within the range of values
assigned to each such item in the Closing Working Capital Statement and the
Statement of Objections, respectively. For purposes of this Agreement, the
procedures set forth in _Section 3.11(c)(i)_ \- _(v)_ shall be considered to
be arbitration within the meaning of the Federal Arbitration Act and any
cognate state law and the courts of Delaware shall have jurisdiction to
enforce any and all orders and awards of the Independent Accountant.

  



  

(iv) _Fees of the Independent Accountant_. The fees and expenses of the
Independent Accountant shall be paid by Stockholder Representative (on behalf
of the Company Stockholders), on the one hand, and by Parent, on the other
hand, based upon the percentage that the amount actually contested but not
awarded to Stockholder Representative or Parent, respectively, bears to the
aggregate amount actually contested by Stockholder Representative and Parent.
Any such fees and expenses payable by Stockholder Representative shall be paid
from the Stockholder Representative Escrow Fund to the extent available.

  



  

   

  



  

(v) _Determination by Independent Accountant_. The Independent Accountant
shall make a determination as soon as practicable within 30 days after their
engagement, and their resolution of the Disputed Amounts and their adjustments
to the Closing Working Capital Statement and/or the Post-Closing Adjustment
shall be conclusive and binding upon the Parties and shall be considered a
"final award" issued by an arbitrator for purposes of the Federal Arbitration
Act and any cognate state law.

  



  

(d) Payment of Post-Closing Adjustment.

  



  

(i) If the Post-Closing Adjustment is a negative number, Stockholder
Representative and Parent shall, within two Business Days after the final
determination of the Post-Closing Adjustment, jointly instruct the Escrow
Agent to disburse from the Purchase Price Adjustment Escrow Fund by wire
transfer of immediately available funds (A) to Parent, the Post-Closing
Adjustment, and (B) to the Exchange Agent, for distribution to the Company
Stockholders in accordance with their Pro Rata Shares, such Company
Stockholders' aggregate Pro Rata Share of any amounts remaining in the
Purchase Price Adjustment Escrow Fund. For avoidance of doubt, the maximum
Post-Closing Adjustment payable to Parent shall be limited to the Purchase
Price Adjustment Escrow Fund.

  



  

(ii) If the Post-Closing Adjustment is a positive number, then within two
Business Days after the final determination of the Post-Closing Adjustment,
(A) Stockholder Representative and Parent shall jointly instruct the Escrow
Agent to disburse to Exchange Agent the Price Adjustment Escrow Fund by wire
transfer of immediately available funds and (B) Parent shall deposit with the
Exchange Agent an amount equal to the Post-Closing Adjustment (for avoidance
of doubt, the maximum Post-Closing Adjustment shall be limited to $1,500,000).
The Exchange Agent shall thereafter (x) disburse to the Company Stockholders
their Pro Rata Share of the Purchase Price Adjustment Escrow Fund and (y)
disburse to the Company Stockholders and Optionholders, such Company
Stockholders' and such Optionholders' aggregate Adjustment Pro Rata Share of

_Section 409A Plan_ ") and identifies each Section 409A Plan in connection
with which the Company, any Subsidiary or their successors may have liability
with respect to current or former employees, directors, independent
contractors, leased employees, officers or other service providers. No such
plan has assets set aside directly or indirectly in the manner described in
Section 409A(b)(1) of the Code or contains a provision that would be subject
to Section 409A(b)(2) of the Code. Each Section 409A Plan has been

the Company, any Subsidiary or any of their ERISA Affiliates and who are or

independent contractors have been appropriately classified as such under all
applicable legal requirements, and no such individuals participate or have the
right to participate in any Employee Benefit Plan with respect the Company,
any Subsidiary or any of their ERISA Affiliates. No employee of the Company or
any Subsidiary is a "leased employee" within the meaning of Section 414(n) of
the Code.

  



  

(f) Except as set forth in _Section 4.10(f)_ of the Company Disclosure
Letter, each Employee Benefit Plan may be amended or terminated as of or after
the Closing without resulting in any material liability to the Company or any
Subsidiary or to any of their affiliates for any additional contributions,
penalties, premiums, fees, fines, excise taxes, or any other charges or
liabilities, except for ordinary administration expenses.

  



  

(g) Neither the Company nor any Subsidiary or any of their ERISA
Affiliates has contributed to a nonconforming group health plan (as defined
under Section 5000(c) of the Code), or incurred a Tax under Section 5000(a) of
the Code. The Company does not maintain any plan that is an "employee welfare
benefit plan" (as such term is defined under Section 3(1) of ERISA) that has
provided any "disqualified benefit" (as such term is defined in Section
4976(b) of the Code) with respect to which an excise tax could be imposed
under Section 4976 of the Code. The Company, each Subsidiary and each of their
ERISA Affiliates has complied in all material respects with the requirements
of the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act and the Health Care and
Education Reconciliation Act of 2010, as amended, COBRA, and in each case the
regulations promulgated thereunder, with respect to each Employee Benefit Plan
to the extent applicable to such plan.

any retiree's, former employee's, consultant's or director's employment or
service with the Company, liabilities with respect to any individual receiving
continuation of coverage benefits in accordance with the provisions of COBRA
and State benefits continuation laws, and any accrued but unpaid claim,
whether known or unknown as of the Closing, under any such plan. All
contributions that are due have been made within the time periods prescribed
by ERISA and the Code to each such Employee Benefit Plan that is an employee
pension benefit plan (as defined in Section 3(2) of ERISA), and all
contributions for any period ending on or before the Closing that are not yet
due have been made to each such employee pension benefit plan or accrued in
accordance with the past custom and practice of the Company.

  



  

(i) Except as set forth in _Section 4.10(i)_ of the Company Disclosure
Letter, neither the execution and delivery of this Agreement nor the

increase the amount of any compensation due, to any current or former
employee, director, independent contractor, leased employee, officer or other
service provider of the Company or any Subsidiary; (ii) increase any benefits
otherwise payable under any Employee Benefit Plan; (iii) result in the
acceleration of the time of payment or vesting of any such compensation or
benefits; (iv) result in the payment of any amount that could, individually or
in combination with any other such payment, constitute an "excess parachute
payment," as defined in 280G(b)(1) of the Code; or (v) result in the
triggering or imposition of any restrictions or limitations on the rights of
the Company to amend or terminate any Employee Benefit Plan.

"): (i) all employer and employee contributions to each Foreign Benefit Plan
required by Law or by the terms of such Foreign Benefit Plan have been made
or, if applicable, accrued in accordance with normal accounting practices;
(ii) the fair market value of the assets of each funded Foreign Benefit Plan,
the liability of each insurer for any Foreign Benefit Plan funded through
insurance or the book reserve established for any Foreign Benefit Plan,
together with any accrued contributions, is sufficient to procure or provide
for the accrued benefit obligations with respect to all current and former
participants in such plan according to the actuarial assumptions and
valuations most recently used to determine employer contributions to such
Foreign Benefit Plan; (iii) all Foreign Benefit Plans have been maintained in
accordance with their terms and all requirements of applicable Law; (iv) each
Foreign Benefit Plan required to be registered has been registered and has
been maintained in good standing with the appropriate Governmental Authority;
and (v) to the extent any Foreign Benefit Plan is intended to qualify for
special Tax treatment, such Foreign Benefit Plan meets all requirements for
such treatment.

  



  

   

  



  

(k) Neither the Company nor any Subsidiary is a party to, or otherwise
obligated under, any Contract, agreement, plan or arrangement that provides
for the gross-up of Taxes imposed by Section 4999 or Section 409A of the Code.

Agreement or any Ancillary Document; and

  



  

(iii) in the event any order, writ, judgment, injunction, decree or
stipulation entered into or with any Governmental Authority adversely
affecting the ability of the Parties to consummate the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement or any Ancillary Document has been issued, to
have such order, writ, judgment, injunction, decree or stipulation vacated or
lifted.

  



  

(d) All analyses, appearances, meetings, discussions, presentations,
memoranda, briefs, filings, arguments, and proposals made by or on behalf of

between a Party and Governmental Authorities in the ordinary course of
business, any disclosure which is not permitted by Law or any disclosure
containing competitively sensitive information) shall be disclosed to the
other Parties in advance of any filing, submission or attendance, it being the
intent that the Parties will consult and cooperate with one another, and
consider in good faith the views of one another, in connection with any such
analyses, appearances, meetings, discussions, presentations, memoranda,
briefs, filings, arguments, and proposals. Without limiting the generality of
the foregoing, each Party shall provide to the other (or the other's
respective advisors) upon request copies of all correspondence between such
Party and any Governmental Authority relating to the transactions contemplated
by this Agreement. The Parties may, as they deem advisable and necessary,
designate any competitively sensitive materials provided to the other under
this _Section 7.8_ as "counsel only." Such materials and the information
contained therein shall be given only to counsel of the recipient and will not
be disclosed by such counsel to employees, officers, or directors of the

materials. Each Party shall give notice to the other Parties with respect to
any meeting, discussion, appearance or contact with any Governmental Authority
or the staff or regulators of any Governmental Authority in connection with
the transactions contemplated hereunder, with such notice being sufficient to
provide the other Parties with the opportunity to attend and participate in
such meeting, discussion, appearance or contact if acceptable to the relevant
Governmental Authority and except to the extent that any portion of such
meeting, discussion, appearance or contact includes the discussion of
competitively sensitive information.

purchasing a substantial portion of the assets of or equity in, or by any
other manner, any business or any corporation, partnership, association or
other business organization or division thereof, or otherwise acquire or agree
to acquire any assets, if the entering into of a definitive agreement relating
to, or the consummation of such acquisition, merger or consolidation would
reasonably be expected to: (i) impose any material delay in the obtaining of,
or materially increase the risk of not obtaining, any consents of any
Governmental Authority necessary to consummate the transactions contemplated
by this Agreement or the expiration or termination of any applicable waiting
period; (ii) materially increase the risk of any Governmental Authority
seeking or entering an Order prohibiting the consummation of the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement; (iii) materially increase the risk of not
being able to remove any such Order on appeal or otherwise; or (iv) materially
delay or prevent the consummation of the transactions contemplated by this

Company or any of their respective Affiliates; (ii) any conditions relating
to, or changes or restrictions in, the operations of any such assets,
businesses or interests which, in either case, could reasonably be expected to
result in a Company Material Adverse Effect or materially and adversely impact
the economic or business benefits to Parent of the transactions contemplated
by this Agreement; or (iii) any material modification or waiver of the terms

the People's Republic of China (which amounts shall be borne solely by the
Company and shall be included in Company Transaction Expenses). The Company
shall, within three Business Days after the submission of any filing under
Circular 698, deliver a written certification to Parent certifying that the
Company has submitted the Circular 698 filing; _provided, however,_ that if a
receipt of submission is issued to the Company by the Tax Authorities for the

provisions contained in the Company Charter and Company Bylaws, respectively
in effect on the date hereof, and such provisions shall not be amended,
repealed or otherwise modified for a period of six (6) years following the
Closing in any manner that would have the effect of impairing the coverage

obligations set forth in this _Section 7.11_.

  



  

(c) The provisions of this _Section 7.11_ are intended for the benefit of,
and shall be enforceable by, all past and present officers and directors of
the Company and his or her heirs and representatives. The rights of all past

unreasonably withheld or delayed. The termination and payout of any such

participants or beneficiaries or distribute to the Company, as applicable,
prior to, as of or after Closing, as the Parent may direct (but in accordance

all amounts held in such trusts or other funds, subject to the receipt of
appropriate payoff letters and net of applicable income, employment and other
tax withholdings.

obtain a waiver from each "disqualified individual" within the meaning of
Section 280G(c) of the Code with respect to the Company and/or its
Subsidiaries who has received or may receive any payment or benefits (the "
_Waived 280G Benefits_ " and each such waiver, the " _280G Waiver_ ") so that
all remaining payments and benefits, if any, shall not constitute "excess
parachute payments" within the meaning of Section 280G(a) of the Code and,

Persons entitled to vote for approval in a manner that satisfies the
applicable requirements of Section 280G(b)(5)(B) of the Code and the Treasury

purposes of the Tax reimbursement and indemnity provisions of this Agreement,
in the case of any Taxes that are imposed on a periodic basis and are payable
for a Straddle Period, the portion of such Tax related to the portion of such
Tax period ending on and including the Closing Date shall (a) in the case of
any Taxes other than gross receipts, employment Taxes, sales or use Taxes and
Taxes based upon or related to income, be deemed equal to the amount of such
Tax for the entire Tax period multiplied by a fraction the numerator of which
is the number of days in the Tax period ending on and including the Closing
Date and the denominator of which is the number of days in the entire Tax
period, and (b) in the case of any Tax based upon or related to income and any
gross receipts, employment Tax, sales or use Tax, be deemed equal to the
amount which would be payable if the relevant Tax period ended on and included
the Closing Date.

  



  

   

  



  

Section 10.3 _Cooperation; Audits_. In connection with the preparation of
Tax Returns, Proceedings relating to the Tax liabilities imposed on the
Company or any Subsidiary for all Pre- Closing Tax Periods, the Parent, on the
one hand, and Stockholder Representative, on the other hand, shall reasonably
cooperate with each other, including the furnishing or making available during
normal business hours of records, personnel (as reasonably required), books of
account, or other materials necessary or helpful for the preparation of such
Tax Returns, the conduct of audit examinations or the defense of claims by Tax
Authorities as to the imposition of Taxes and any assessment or reassessment
in respect of Taxes. Parent shall, and shall cause the Company and the
Subsidiaries to, retain all books and records with respect to Tax Proceedings
pertinent to the Company and the Subsidiaries relating to any taxable period
beginning before the Closing Date until the expiration of the applicable
statute of limitations (and, to the extent notified by Stockholder
Representative, any extension thereof) for the respective taxable periods, and
to abide by all record retention Laws and agreements entered into with any Tax
Authority.

  



  

Section 10.4 _Tax Returns_.

  



  

(a) _Tax Returns due on or before the Closing Date_. The Company shall
prepare (or cause to be prepared) and timely file (or cause to be timely
filed) all Tax Returns of the Company and the Subsidiaries that are due on or
before the Closing Date (taking into account applicable extensions) and shall
pay (or cause to be paid) all Taxes due with respect to such Tax Returns. All
such Tax Returns shall be prepared in accordance with the past practice of the
Company and the Subsidiaries, as applicable, in filing Tax Returns unless
otherwise required by applicable Law. The Company shall deliver (or cause to
be delivered) such Tax Returns to the Parent no less than thirty (30) days in
the case of any such Income Tax Return or as soon as practical in the case of
any other Tax Return prior to the applicable filing deadline (taking into
account applicable extensions) for the Parent's review and comment. The
Company shall make or cause to be made all changes reasonably requested by the
Parent with respect to any such Tax Returns.

  



  

(b) Tax Returns due after the Closing Date.

  



  

(i) For any Straddle Period, the Company shall prepare (or cause to be
prepared) and timely file (or cause to be timely filed), taking into account
extensions, all Tax Returns of the Company and the Subsidiaries (the "
_Straddle Tax Returns_ ") and shall deliver or cause to be delivered such
Straddle Tax Returns to Stockholder Representative no less than thirty (30)
days in the case of any Income Tax Return or ten (10) days in the case of any
other Tax Return prior to the applicable filing deadline (taking into account
applicable extensions) for Stockholder Representative's review and comment.
The Company shall make or cause to be made all changes reasonably requested by
Stockholder Representative with respect to any Straddle Tax Returns.

  



  

(ii) For any Income Tax Return for a taxable period that ends on or before
the Closing Date and that is required to be filed by the Company or the
Subsidiaries after the Closing Date (taking into account applicable
extensions) (the " _Pre-Closing Income Tax Returns_ "), the Company shall
timely prepare or cause to be prepared such Pre-Closing Income Tax Returns and
shall deliver or cause to be delivered such Pre-Closing Income Tax Returns to
the Parent no less than thirty (30) days prior to the applicable filing
deadline (taking into account applicable extensions) for the Parent's review
and comment. The Company shall make or cause to be made all changes reasonably
requested by the Parent with respect to any Pre-Closing Income Tax Returns.

  



  

   

  



  

(iii) For any other Tax Return for a taxable period that ends on or before
the Closing Date and that is required to be filed by the Company or the
Subsidiaries after the Closing Date (taking into account applicable
extensions) (the " _Pre-Closing Other Tax Returns_ "), the Parent shall timely
prepare or cause to be prepared such Pre-Closing Other Tax Returns and shall
deliver or cause to be delivered such Pre-Closing Other Tax Returns to
Stockholder Representative as soon as practical prior to the applicable filing
deadline (taking into account applicable extensions) for Stockholder
Representative's review and consent. If, after consulting in good faith, the
Parties are unable to resolve any comments made by Stockholder Representative
with respect to a Pre-Closing Other Tax Return, such Pre-Closing Other Tax
Return shall be referred to the Independent Accountant for resolution. If the
Independent Accountant is unable to make a determination with respect to any
disputed item prior to the due date for the filing of the Pre-Closing Other
Tax Return in question, then (x) the Company or the Subsidiaries, as
applicable, shall timely file such Pre-Closing Other Tax Return in accordance
with the reasonable position of the Parent and (y) when the Independent
Accountant subsequently resolves the dispute, the Company or the Subsidiaries,
as applicable, shall promptly file an amended Pre-Closing Other Tax Return, if
necessary reflecting the resolution by the Independent Accountant. The fees
and expenses of the Independent Accountant shall be shared equally by
Stockholder Representative and the Parent.

  



  

(iv) All such Straddle Tax Returns, Pre-Closing Income Tax Returns and
Pre-Closing Other Tax Returns (collectively, the " _Pre-Closing Tax Returns_
") shall be prepared in accordance and consistently with the past practices of
the Company or the Subsidiaries, as applicable, unless otherwise required by
applicable Law. The Parent or Stockholder Representative, as applicable, shall
provide comments (if any) on or to such Pre- Closing Tax Returns reasonably
prior to the due date for such Pre-Closing Tax Return (taking into account
applicable extensions) and, if the Parent or Stockholder Representative, as
applicable, does not provide any written comments prior to the due date for
such Pre-Closing Tax Return (taking into account applicable extensions), the
Parent or Stockholder Representative, as applicable shall be deemed to have
accepted such Tax Return. Parent shall pay or cause to be paid any Taxes shown
as due on any Pre-Closing Tax Return.

  



  

Section 10.5 _Tax Controversies_. Notwithstanding any other provision of
this Agreement, this _Section 10.5_ shall control any Proceedings with respect
to Taxes or Tax Returns (a " _Tax Proceeding_ "). The Parent, on the one hand,
and Stockholder Representative, on the other, shall inform the other in
writing promptly after receipt of notice of any Tax Proceeding from any Tax
Authority which may be the subject of an indemnification claim pursuant to
_Section 10.1_ of this Agreement; _provided, however,_ a failure to give such
notice shall not affect a Party's rights to indemnification hereunder except
to the extent the indemnifying party is prejudiced by such failure. Such
notice shall include a copy of the relevant portion of any correspondence
received from the relevant Tax Authority and describe in reasonable detail the
nature of such Tax Proceeding. With respect to any Tax Proceeding for which
the Company Stockholders may have an indemnification obligation pursuant to
this Agreement, the Parent shall not enter into any settlement of, otherwise
compromise or abandon any such Tax Proceeding without the prior written
consent of Stockholder Representative, which consent shall not be unreasonably
withheld, conditioned or delayed, and the Parent shall keep Stockholder
Representative duly informed with respect to such Tax Proceedings.

  



  

   

  



  

Section 10.6 _Transfer Taxes_. All transfer, documentary, sales, use,
stamp, registration and other similar Taxes and fees (including any penalties
and interest) incurred in connection with the Merger will be paid fifty
percent by the Parent and fifty percent by the Company Stockholders (and such
portion shall be Company Transaction Expenses) when due, and the Parent and
Stockholder Representative shall cooperate in the execution of filing of all
necessary Tax Returns and other documentation with respect to all such Taxes
and fees.

  



  

Section 10.7 _Treatment as Purchase Price Adjustment_. For Tax purposes,
the Parties agree to treat all indemnification payments made under this
Agreement as adjustments to the Purchase Price unless otherwise required by
applicable Law.

  



  

Section 10.8 _Tax Sharing Agreements_. Other than with respect to
Commercial Tax Agreements, the Company shall cause all Tax allocation
agreements or Tax sharing agreements between the Company or any of Subsidiary,
on the one hand, and any Affiliate of the Company (other than a Subsidiary),
on the other hand, to be terminated as of the Closing Date.

  



  

Section 10.9 _Survival, Conflict of Provisions and Procedures_. The
covenants provided in this _Article X_ shall survive indefinitely. In the
event of any conflict between this _Article X_ and _Article XI_ , as it
relates to Taxes, this _Article X_ shall govern. Claims by, and payments to,
an indemnified party pursuant to _Section 10.1_ shall be made utilizing the
procedures set forth in _Section 11.3(a)_.

  



  

 **Article XI 
  
 INDEMNIFICATION**

  



  

Section 11.1 _Indemnification by the Company Stockholders_.

  



  

(a) The Company Stockholders shall, severally and not jointly (in
accordance with their Pro Rata Shares) indemnify, defend and hold harmless
Parent, Merger Subsidiary and the Surviving Corporation, each of their
respective successors and assigns and their respective directors, officers,
agents, representatives and employees (collectively, the " _Parent Indemnified
Parties_ ") from and against any and all, without duplication, liability,
loss, damage, claim, charge, action, suit, proceeding, investigation,
deficiency, Tax, interest, penalty, reasonable cost and reasonable expense
(including, without limitation, reasonable attorneys' fees) that (a) with
respect to any Third-Party Claim, are actually paid by an Indemnified Party
and (b) with respect to any claim that is not a Third-Party Claim, exclude any
punitive damages or damages pursuant to statute that provide for multiple-
based damages (a " _Loss_ ") to the extent imposed on, incurred or suffered by
or asserted against any Parent Indemnified Party, to the extent such Loss
results from or arises out of: any breach or inaccuracy of any of the
representations and warranties made by the Company in this Agreement or any
Ancillary Document, any failure of the Company to carry out, perform, satisfy
and discharge any of its covenants, agreements, undertakings, liabilities or
obligations under this Agreement or any Ancillary Document; (iii) any claim
made by any Company Stockholder, Optionholder or Warrantholder relating to
such Person's rights with respect to the Merger Consideration or any other
consideration hereunder, or the calculations and determinations set forth on
the Consideration Spreadsheet; (iv) any amounts paid to the holders of
Dissenting Shares, including any interest required to be paid thereon, that
are in excess of what such holders would have received hereunder had such
holders not been holders of Dissenting Shares; (v) Net Debt in excess of
$8,000,000; or (vi) any Company Transaction Expenses outstanding as of the
Closing to the extent not paid or satisfied by the Company or a Subsidiary at
or prior to the Closing; _provided, however,_ that the Parent Indemnified
Parties shall have the right to be indemnified, held harmless from, defended
or reimbursed under _Section 11.1(a)(i)_ in respect of the representations and
warranties made by the Company only if such right is asserted (whether or not
such Losses have actually been incurred) on or before the respective dates set
forth below:

  



  

   

  



    \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\t

For Representations and 
 \t\t\tWarranties Set Forth 
 \t\t\tin the Following Sections:

  \t\t\t



 \t\t\t \t\t\t|  \t\t\t

All Claims Must be 
 \t\t\tAsserted by:

  \t\t\t



 \t\t\t \t\t 
---|--- 
 \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\t

 _Section 4.1_ (first sentence only) (Due Organization), _Section 4.2_
(Capitalization), _Section 4.6(a)_ (Title to Assets), _Section 4.7(c)_ (Title
to Real Property) and _Section 4.17(b)_ (Title to Intellectual Property) (the
" _Fundamental Representations_ ")

 \t\t\t \t\t\t|  \t\t\t

The later of (i) the expiration of the duration of the claims period of the
Representations and Warranties Insurance Policy, and (ii) six years after the
Closing Date.

The later of (i) the expiration of the duration of the claims period of the
Representations and Warranties Insurance Policy, and (ii) within 60 days after
the expiration of the applicable statute of limitations (including
extensions).

 \t\t\t \t\t

Representations and Warranties Insurance Policy and (ii) 18 months after the
Closing Date.

 \t\t\t \t\t 
    



  

(b) Notwithstanding anything expressed or implied in this _Article XI_ to
the contrary, none of the Parent Indemnified Parties shall be entitled to
indemnification for any Losses arising from a claim for indemnification
pursuant to _Section 11.1(a)(i)_ from and after such time that the aggregate
amount of Losses for which the Indemnified Parties have been indemnified under
_Section 11.1(a)(i)_ hereof exceeds the Indemnification Escrow Amount (the "
_Cap_ "). Recovery for Losses incurred by Parent Indemnified Parties shall
come first from the Indemnification Escrow Fund in accordance with the terms
of this Agreement and the Escrow Agreement until the Indemnification Escrow
Fund has been fully exhausted or disbursed from the Indemnification Escrow
Fund, at which point the Parent Indemnified Parties' sole source of recovery
for claims under _Section 11.1(a)(i)_ shall be through the Representations and
Warranties Insurance Policy in accordance with the terms thereof. For purposes
of clarity and the avoidance of doubt, resort against the Indemnification
Escrow Fund shall be the Parent Indemnified Parties' sole and exclusive remedy
against the Company Stockholders for any breach or inaccuracy of any of the
representations and warranties made by the Company in this Agreement or any
Ancillary Document, except for claims based on Fraud or intentional
misrepresentation. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement
(including the preceding sentence), (i) in no event will any Parent
Indemnified Parties be required to bring a claim to recover Losses under the
Representations and Warranties Insurance Policy, and (ii) the existence of the
Representations and Warranties Insurance Policy or any claims relating thereto
shall not in any way limit any Parent Indemnified Parties' ability to recover
from the Indemnification Escrow Fund in accordance with the terms of this
Agreement and the Escrow Agreement. In the event of any payment by the insurer
under the Representations and Warranties Insurance Policy, the insurer shall
be subrogated to all of Parent's and the Company's respective rights of
recovery against any Person based upon, arising out of or relating to such
payment, but the Indemnifying Party's obligations shall remain subject to the
limitations set forth in this _Article XI_. In no event shall the liability of
any Company Stockholder under this Agreement exceed such Company Stockholder's
respective Pro Rata Share of the Merger Consideration actually received by
such Company Stockholder.

  



  

   

  



  

(c) Absent Fraud or intentional misrepresentation, an Indemnifying Party
shall not have any liability under _Section 11.1(a)(i)_ hereof unless the
aggregate amount of Losses incurred by the Parent Indemnified Parties and
indemnifiable hereunder based upon, attributable to or resulting from the
failure of any of the representations or warranties to be true and correct
exceeds the Basket and, in such event, the Indemnifying Party shall be
required to pay the entire amount of all such Losses (without deducting the
Basket amount from the calculation of such Losses).

  



  

Section 11.2 _Indemnification by Parent and Merger Subsidiary_. Parent
and Merger Subsidiary shall, jointly and severally, indemnify, defend and hold
harmless the Company Stockholders and their directors, officers, agents,
representatives and employees and their respective successors and permitted
assigns (collectively, the " _Company Indemnified Parties_ " and, together
with the Parent Indemnified Parties, collectively referred to as the "
_Indemnified Parties_ ") from and against any and all, without duplication,
Losses to the extent imposed on, incurred or suffered by or asserted against
any Company Indemnified Party, directly or indirectly, to the extent resulting
from, arising out of, or incurred with respect to (in each case except to the
extent waived or deemed waived by the Company in accordance with this
Agreement) any breach or inaccuracy of any of the representations and
warranties made by Parent or Merger Subsidiary in this Agreement or any other
agreement or instrument delivered by Parent or Merger Subsidiary pursuant to
this Agreement; or (b) any failure of Parent or Merger Subsidiary to carry
out, perform, satisfy and discharge any of its respective covenants,
agreements, undertakings, liabilities or obligations under this Agreement or
under any of the agreements and instruments delivered by Parent or Merger
Subsidiary pursuant to this Agreement; _provided, however,_ that the Company
Indemnified Parties shall have the right to be indemnified, held harmless
from, defended or reimbursed under _Section 11.2(a)_ in respect of the
representations and warranties made by Parent or Merger Subsidiary only if
such right is asserted (whether or not such Losses have actually been
incurred) on or before the date that is 18 months after the Closing Date.

  



  

   

  



  

Section 11.3 _Indemnification Procedures_.

  



  

(a) In order for an Indemnified Party to be entitled to any
indemnification provided for under this Agreement, including without
limitation with respect to any liabilities and obligations of the Company
existing as of the Effective Time required to be satisfied by the Company as
provided in _Section 7.5_ , the Indemnified Party shall deliver to the party
against whom indemnification is sought in accordance with _Section 11.1_ or
_Section 11.2_ , as the case may be (an " _Indemnifying Party_ "), notice of
its claim for indemnification with reasonable promptness after determining to
make such claim. The failure by any Indemnified Party to so notify the
Indemnifying Party, as the case may be, shall not relieve the Indemnifying
Party from any liability which it may have to such Indemnified Party under
this Agreement, except to the extent that the Indemnifying Party shall have
been materially and adversely prejudiced by such failure. If the Indemnifying
Party disputes its liability with respect to such claim, the Indemnifying
Party and the Indemnified Party shall proceed in good faith to negotiate a
resolution of such dispute and, if not resolved through negotiations, such
dispute shall be resolved by litigation in an appropriate court of competent
jurisdiction as provided in _Section 12.6_.

  



  

(b) If any claim for indemnification under _Section 11.1_ or _Section
11.2_ involves the claim of any third party against an Indemnified Party (a "
_Third-Party Claim_ "), the Indemnifying Party may, upon written notice as
provided above (which notice shall acknowledge that such Third-Party Claim is
an indemnifiable claim under this _Article XI_ ), assume control over the
defense thereof, with counsel reasonably satisfactory to the Indemnified
Party, and, after written notice from the Indemnifying Party to the
Indemnified Party of its assumption of the defense thereof, the Indemnifying
Party shall not be liable to such Indemnified Party for any legal or other
expenses subsequently incurred by the Indemnified Party in connection with the
defense thereof (but the Indemnified Party shall have the right, but not the
obligation, to participate at its own cost and expense in such defense by
counsel of its own choice) or for any amounts paid or foregone by the
Indemnified Party as a result of any settlement or compromise thereof that is
effected by the Indemnified Party (without the written consent of the
Indemnifying Party). If the Indemnifying Party elects not to, or fails to,
assume control over the defense of a Third-Party Claim, then the Indemnified
Party may assume such defense and the Indemnifying Party shall be required to
pay all legal or other expenses, including, without limitation, reasonable
attorneys' fees and disbursements, incurred by the Indemnified Party in such
defense, subject to the limitations set forth in _Section 11.1(b)_.

  



  

(c) Anything in this _Section 11.3_ notwithstanding, if both the
Indemnifying Party and the Indemnified Party are named as parties or subject
to such Third-Party Claim and either such party determines in good faith with
advice of counsel that there may be one or more legal defenses available to it
that are different from or additional to those available to the other party
that, if the Indemnified Party and the Indemnifying Party were to be
represented by the same counsel, would constitute a conflict of interest for
such counsel or prejudice the prosecution of the defenses available to such
Indemnified Party, then the Indemnifying Party may decline to assume the
defense on behalf of the Indemnified Party or the Indemnified Party may retain
the defense on its own behalf, and, in either such case, after written notice
to such effect is duly given hereunder to the other party, the Indemnifying
Party shall be relieved of any undertaking to assume the defense on behalf of
the Indemnified Party, but shall be required to pay all legal or other
expenses including, without limitation, reasonable attorneys' fees and
disbursements, incurred by the Indemnified Party in such defense, subject to
the limitations set forth in _Section 11.1(b)_.

  



  

   

  



  

(d) If the Indemnifying Party assumes the defense of any such Third-Party
Claim, the Indemnified Party shall cooperate fully with the Indemnifying Party
and shall appear and give testimony, produce documents and other tangible
evidence, allow the Indemnifying Party reasonable access to the books and
records of the Indemnified Party and otherwise provide reasonable assistance
to the Indemnifying Party in conducting such defense. No Indemnifying Party
shall, without the written consent of the Indemnified Party (which consent
shall not be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed), consent to entry
of any judgment or enter into any settlement or compromise which does not
include as an unconditional term thereof the giving by the claimant or
plaintiff to such Indemnified Party of a release from all liability in respect
of such Third-Party Claim. Provided that proper notice is duly given, if the
Indemnifying Party elects to assume the defense thereof but fails to promptly
and diligently contest the Third-Party Claim, then the Indemnified Party may
respond to, contest and defend against such Third-Party Claim (but the
Indemnifying Party shall have the right to participate at its own cost and
expense in such defense by counsel of its own choice) and may make in good
faith any compromise or settlement with respect thereto, and recover from the
Indemnifying Party the entire cost and expense thereof including, without
limitation, reasonable attorneys' fees and disbursements and all amounts paid
or foregone as a result of such Third-Party Claim, or the settlement or
compromise thereof, subject to the limitations set forth in _Section 11.1(b)_.
Whether or not the Indemnifying Party assumes the defense of a Third-Party
Claim, the Indemnified Party shall not admit any liability with respect to, or
settle, compromise or discharge, such Third-Party Claim without the
Indemnifying Party's prior written consent (which consent shall not be
unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed).

  



  

(e) Notwithstanding the foregoing provisions of this _Section 11.3_ , in
circumstances where _Section 11.3(c)_ does not apply and the Indemnifying
Party has diligently assumed the defense of the Third-Party Claim, the
Indemnified Party shall nonetheless have the right at its own cost and expense
to take over and assume the control (as to itself) of the defense or
settlement of the Third-Party Claim if the Indemnified Party is dissatisfied
with the prosecution of the defense of such Third-Party Claim. The
Indemnifying Party shall not be liable under this _Article XI_ for any
settlement or compromise effected without its consent, and further subject to
the limitations set forth in _Section 11.1(b)_.

  



  

(f) Any indemnity payment under this Agreement shall be treated as an
adjustment to the Purchase Price and Merger Consideration for Tax purposes,
unless a final determination (which shall include the execution of an IRS Form
870-AD or successor form) with respect to the Indemnified Party or any of its
Affiliates causes any such payment not to be treated as an adjustment to the
Purchase Price and Merger Consideration for United States federal income Tax
purposes.

  



  

   

  



  

(g) The Indemnification Escrow Fund shall expire and terminate on the date
that is 18 months after the Closing Date pursuant to the terms of the Escrow
Agreement, and upon such expiration and termination, the Escrow Agent, upon
receipt of joint written instructions from Parent and the Stockholder
Representative, shall pay any amount remaining in the Indemnification Escrow
Fund to the Company Stockholders as set forth in the Escrow Agreement in
accordance with their Pro Rata Shares; _provided, however,_ that the Escrow
Agent shall retain and not distribute to the Company Stockholders (and the
Indemnification Escrow Fund shall not expire or terminate with respect to)
such portion of the Indemnification Escrow Fund as is equal to the aggregate
amount of any outstanding Losses for which Parent Indemnified Parties have
made an indemnification claim or claims by providing notice thereof pursuant
to this _Article XI_ and which has or have not yet been resolved pursuant to
this _Article XI_.

  



  

Section 11.4 _Survival of Representations and Warranties_. All
representations, warranties and covenants made by the Company in this
Agreement or in any document delivered pursuant hereto shall be deemed to have
been made on the date of this Agreement (except as otherwise provided herein)
and, if a Closing occurs, as of the Closing Date and Effective Time. The
representations and warranties of Parent, Merger Subsidiary and the Company
will survive the Closing and will remain in effect until, and will expire as
provided in, _Section 11.1(a)_ and _Section 11.2_.

  



  

Section 11.5 _Exclusive Remedy_. After the Closing, the indemnification
provisions of this _Article XI_ , including recovery against the
Indemnification Escrow Fund and the Representations and Warranties Insurance
Policy, will provide the sole and exclusive remedy for any breach of any
representation, warranty, covenant or obligation or other claim arising out of
this Agreement or the transaction contemplated hereby, except for claims based
on Fraud or intentional misrepresentation. Notwithstanding anything in this
Agreement to the contrary, (a) no limitations (including the limitations set
forth in this _Article XI_ ), qualifications or procedures in this Agreement
shall be deemed to apply to any claim for Losses under the Representations and
Warranties Insurance Policy and (b) nothing herein shall prevent Parent or any
Affiliate thereof from making any claim under the Representations and
Warranties Insurance Policy.

  



  

Section 11.6 _Fraud and Intentional Misrepresentation_. None of the
limitations set forth in this _Article XI_ shall apply to claims based on
Fraud or intentional misrepresentation.

  



  

Section 11.7 _Materiality_. For purposes of this _Article XI_ (including
the determination of whether there has been any breach or inaccuracy in the
representation or warranty and the determination of the amount of any Loss
that is subject to indemnification), each representation and warranty in this
Agreement shall be read without regard to, and without giving effect to, the
term "material" or "Company Material Adverse Effect" or "in all material
respects" or other similar qualification contained in, or otherwise applicable
to, such representation or warranty.

  



  

 **Article XII 
  
 MISCELLANEOUS**

  



  

Section 12.1 _Stockholder Representative_.

  



  

   

  



  

(a) By approving this Agreement and the transactions contemplated hereby
or by executing and delivering a Letter of Transmittal, each Company
Stockholder shall have irrevocably authorized and appointed Stockholder

in-fact to act on behalf of such Person with respect to this Agreement and the
Escrow Agreement and to take any and all actions and make any decisions
required or permitted to be taken by Stockholder Representative pursuant to
this Agreement or the Escrow Agreement, including the exercise of the power
to:

  



  

(i) give and receive notices and communications;

  



  

(ii) authorize delivery to Parent of cash from the Purchase Price

the Indemnification Escrow Fund in satisfaction of claims for indemnification
made by Parent pursuant to this Agreement;

  



  

(iii) agree to, negotiate, enter into settlements and compromises of, and
comply with orders or otherwise handle any other matters described in _Section
3.11_ ;

(ix) take all actions necessary or appropriate in the good faith judgment
of Stockholder Representative for the accomplishment of the foregoing.

  



  

Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Stockholder Representative shall have no
obligation to act on behalf of the Company Stockholders except as expressly
provided herein, in the Escrow Agreement and in the Stockholder Representative
Engagement Agreement, and for purposes of clarity, there are no obligations of
the Stockholder Representative in any ancillary agreement, schedule, exhibit
or the Company Disclosure Letter. The Stockholder Representative shall be
entitled to: (i) rely upon the Consideration Spreadsheet, (ii) rely upon any
signature believed by it to be genuine, and (iii) reasonably assume that a
signatory has proper authorization to sign on behalf of the applicable Company
Stockholder or other party.

  



  

   

  



  

(b) Parent shall be entitled to deal exclusively with Stockholder
Representative on all matters relating to this Agreement (including, without
limitation, all matters related to indemnification) and shall be entitled to
rely conclusively (without further evidence of any kind whatsoever) on any
document executed or purported to be executed on behalf of any Company
Stockholder by Stockholder Representative, and on any other action taken or
purported to be taken on behalf of any Company Stockholder by Stockholder
Representative, as being fully binding upon such Person and such Person's
successors. Notices or communications to or from Stockholder Representative
shall constitute notice to or from each of the Company Stockholders. Any
decision or action by Stockholder Representative hereunder, including any
agreement between Stockholder Representative and Parent relating to the
defense, payment or settlement of any claims for indemnification hereunder,
shall constitute a decision or action of all Company Stockholders and shall be
final, binding and conclusive upon each such Person. No Company Stockholder
shall have the right to object to, dissent from, protest or otherwise contest
the same and all defenses which may be available to any Company Stockholder to
contest, negate or disaffirm the action of the Stockholder Representative
taken in good faith under this Agreement, the Escrow Agreement or the
Stockholder Representative Engagement Agreement are waived. The provisions of
this Section, including the power of attorney granted hereby, and the powers,
immunities and rights to indemnification granted to the Stockholder
Representative Group hereunder: (i) are independent and severable, are
irrevocable and coupled with an interest and shall not be terminated by any
act of any one or more Company Stockholders, or by operation of Law, whether
by death or other event and (ii) shall survive the delivery of an assignment
by any Company Stockholder of the whole or any fraction of his, her or its
interest in the Indemnification Escrow Fund.

  



  

(c) Stockholder Representative may resign at any time, and may be removed
for any reason or no reason by the vote or written consent of a majority in
interest of the Company Stockholders according to each Company Stockholder's
Pro Rata Share (the " _Majority Holders_ "); _provided, however,_ in no event
shall Stockholder Representative resign or be removed without the Majority
Holders having first appointed a new Stockholder Representative who shall
assume such duties immediately upon the resignation or removal of Stockholder
Representative. In the event of the death, incapacity, resignation or removal
of Stockholder Representative, a new Stockholder Representative shall be
appointed by the vote or written consent of the Majority Holders. Notice of
such vote or a copy of the written consent appointing such new Stockholder
Representative shall be sent to Parent, such appointment to be effective upon
the later of the date indicated in such consent or the date such notice is
received by Parent; provided, that until such notice is received, Parent,
Merger Subsidiary and the Surviving Corporation shall be entitled to rely on
the decisions and actions of the prior Stockholder Representative as described
in _Section 12.1(a)_ above. The immunities and rights to indemnification shall
survive the resignation or removal of the Stockholder Representative or any
member of the Advisory Group and the Closing and/or any termination of this
Agreement and the Escrow Agreement.

  



  

(d) Certain Company Stockholders and Optionholders have entered into an
engagement agreement (the " _Stockholder Representative Engagement Agreement_
") with the Stockholder Representative to provide direction to the Stockholder
Representative in connection with its services under this Agreement, the
Escrow Agreement and the Stockholder Representative Engagement Agreement (such
Company Stockholders and Optionholders, including their individual
representatives, collectively hereinafter referred to as the " _Advisory
Group_ "). Neither the Stockholder Representative nor its members, managers,
directors, officers, contractors, agents and employees nor any member of the
Advisory Group (collectively, the " _Stockholder Representative Group_ ")
shall be liable to the Company Stockholders or Optionholders for actions taken
pursuant to this Agreement, the Escrow Agreement or the Stockholder
Representative Engagement Agreement, except to the extent such actions shall
have been determined by a court of competent jurisdiction to have constituted
gross negligence or involved Fraud, intentional misconduct or bad faith (it
being understood that any act done or omitted pursuant to the advice of
counsel, accountants and other professionals and experts retained by
Stockholder Representative shall be conclusive evidence of good faith). The
Company Stockholders shall severally and not jointly (in accordance with their
Pro Rata Shares), indemnify, defend and hold harmless the Stockholder
Representative Group from and against, compensate it for, reimburse it for and
pay any and all losses, liabilities, claims, actions, damages, fees, fines,
judgments, amounts paid in settlement and expenses (including reasonable
attorneys' fees and disbursements, costs of other skilled professionals and in
connection with seeking recovery from insurers) arising out of and in
connection with its activities as Stockholder Representative under this
Agreement, the Escrow Agreement and the Stockholder Representative Engagement
Agreement (collectively, the " _Representative Losses_ "), in each case as
such Representative Loss is suffered or incurred. The Representative Losses
shall be satisfied: (i) from the Stockholder Representative Escrow Fund; and
(ii) from any distribution of the Indemnification Escrow Fund otherwise
distributable to the Company Stockholders at the time of distribution; (iii)
to the extent the amount of the Representative Losses exceeds amounts
available to Stockholder Representative under (i) and (ii), directly, from the
Company Stockholders, severally and not jointly (in accordance with their Pro
Rata Shares). As soon as practicable after the date on which the final
obligation of Stockholder Representative under this Agreement and the Escrow
Agreement have been discharged or such other date as Stockholder
Representative deems appropriate, the Escrow Agent shall pay any amounts
remaining in the Stockholder Representative Escrow Fund to the Company
Stockholders in accordance with their Pro Rata Shares, as set forth in the
Escrow Agreement. The Company Stockholders acknowledge that the Stockholder
Representative shall not be required to expend or risk its own funds or
otherwise incur any financial liability in the exercise or performance of any
of its powers, rights, duties or privileges or pursuant to this Agreement, the
Escrow Agreement, the Stockholder Representative Engagement Agreement or the
transactions contemplated hereby or thereby. Furthermore, the Stockholder
Representative shall not be required to take any action unless the Stockholder
Representative has been provided with funds, security or indemnities which, in
its determination, are sufficient to protect the Stockholder Representative
against the costs, expenses and liabilities which may be incurred by the
Stockholder Representative in performing such actions.

  



  

   

  



  

Section 12.2 _Amendment_. This Agreement may be amended by action taken
by Merger Subsidiary, the Company and Parent at any time before or after
obtaining the Company Stockholder Approval; _provided, however,_ that after
obtaining the Company Stockholder Approval no amendment shall be made that
under applicable Law requires the approval of such Company Stockholders
without the approval of such Company Stockholders. This Agreement may not be
amended except by an instrument in writing signed on behalf of each of the
Parties.

  



  

Section 12.3 _Extension; Waiver_. At any time prior to the Effective
Time, each Party may, to the extent legally allowed, (i) extend the time for
the performance of any of the obligations or other acts of the other Party
hereto, (ii) waive any inaccuracies in the representations and warranties
contained herein or in any document, certificate or writing delivered pursuant
hereto by the other Party hereto or (iii) subject to the proviso contained in
_Section 12.2_ , waive compliance with any of the agreements or conditions
contained herein by the other Party. Any agreement on the part of any Party to
any such extension or waiver shall be valid only if set forth in an instrument
in writing signed on behalf of such Party. The failure of any Party hereto to
assert any of its rights hereunder shall not constitute a waiver of such
rights.

  



  

   

  



  

Section 12.4 _Entire Agreement; Assignment_. This Agreement, including
all Schedules and Exhibits attached hereto, (i) constitutes the entire
agreement among the Parties with respect to the subject matter hereof and
supersedes all other prior agreements and understandings, both written and
oral, among the Parties or any of them with respect to the subject matter
hereof and thereof, and (ii) shall not be assigned by operation of law or
otherwise prior to the Effective Time.

  



  

Section 12.5 _Notices_. All notices, requests, claims, demands and other
communications hereunder shall be in writing and shall be given (and shall be
deemed to have been duly given upon receipt) by delivery in person, by

certified mail (postage prepaid, return receipt requested) to the respective
Parties as follows; provided that with respect to notices delivered to the

Section 12.6 _Governing Law; Consent to Jurisdiction; Arbitration_.

  



  

(a) This Agreement, and all claims or causes of action (whether at law, in
contract or in tort) that may be based upon, arise out of or relate to this
Agreement or the negotiation, execution or performance hereof, shall be
governed by and construed in accordance with the Laws of the State of
Delaware, without giving effect to any choice or conflict of law provision or
rule that would cause the application of the Laws of any jurisdiction other
than the State of Delaware. Each of the Parties (i) consents to submit itself
to the personal jurisdiction of any federal court located in the State of
Delaware or any Delaware state court sitting in Wilmington, Delaware in the
event any dispute arises out of this Agreement or any of the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement, and, in connection with any such matter, to
service of process by notice as otherwise provided herein, (ii) agrees that it
will not attempt to deny or defeat such personal jurisdiction by motion or
other request for leave from any such court and (iii) agrees that it will not
bring any action relating to this Agreement or any of the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement in any court other than a federal court sitting
in the State of Delaware or a Delaware state court.

  



  

(b) Any controversy or claim arising out of or relating to this contract,
or the breach thereof, shall be settled by single-arbitrator arbitration
administered by the American Arbitration Association in accordance with its
Procedures for Large, Complex Commercial Disputes including the Optional Rules
for Emergency Measures of Protection, and judgment on the award rendered by
the arbitrator may be entered in any court having jurisdiction thereof. Unless
otherwise agreed to by the Parties, the arbitration shall be held in New
Castle County, Delaware and the substantive and procedural laws of Delaware
shall apply, except for any choice of law provisions. The arbitration shall be
conducted in English. Although the arbitrator(s) need not apply formal rules
of evidence, the arbitration will be guided by the Federal Rules of Evidence.
The arbitrator shall render an award together with a reasoned decision. The
arbitrator may award costs and attorney's fees if the arbitrator determines
that the position of one Party was not substantially justified. The arbitrator
may not award punitive damages, nor may the arbitrator award multiple damages
even if permitted by applicable law. Any demand for arbitration must be made
within one year of discovery, or the claim will be deemed waived. This
arbitration provision and any award made pursuant to an arbitration convened
pursuant to it may be enforced in the United States District Court with
jurisdiction over New Castle County, Delaware, or, if such court lacks
jurisdiction, then the state courts of Delaware with jurisdiction over New
Castle County.

  



  

   

  



  

Section 12.7 _Specific Performance_. The Parties hereto agree that
irreparable damage would occur in the event any of the provisions of this
Agreement were not performed in accordance with the terms hereof and that the
Parties shall be entitled to specific performance of the terms hereof, in
addition to any other remedy at law or equity.

  



  

Section 12.8 _Descriptive Headings_. The descriptive headings herein are
inserted for convenience of reference only and are not intended to be part of
or to affect the meaning or interpretation of this Agreement.

  



  

Section 12.9 _Parties in Interest_. This Agreement shall be binding upon
and inure solely to the benefit of each Party, and except as provided in the
following sentence, nothing in this Agreement, express or implied, is intended
to or shall confer upon any other person any rights, benefits or remedies of
any nature whatsoever under or by reason of this Agreement.

  



  

Section 12.10 _Execution of this Agreement_. This Agreement may be
executed in two or more counterparts, each of which shall be deemed to be an
original, but all of which shall constitute one and the same agreement. The
exchange of copies of this Agreement and of signature pages by electronic
transmission (including by exchanging PDF copies) shall constitute effective
execution and delivery of this Agreement as to the Parties and may be used in
lieu of the original Agreement for all purposes.

  



  

Section 12.11 _Severability_. If any term or other provision of this
Agreement is invalid, illegal or incapable of being enforced by any rule of
law or public policy, all other conditions and provisions of this Agreement
shall nevertheless remain in full force and effect so long as the economic or
legal substance of the transactions contemplated hereby is not affected in any
manner adverse to any Party. Upon such determination that any term or other
provision is invalid, illegal or incapable of being enforced, the Parties
hereto shall negotiate in good faith to modify such term or provision so as to
effect the original intent of the Parties as closely as possible in an
acceptable manner to the end that the transactions contemplated hereby are
fulfilled to the extent possible.
