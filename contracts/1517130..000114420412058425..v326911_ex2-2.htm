(a) _Share Ownership_. Seller is the sole registered owner of the
Company Shares. Seller owns the Company Shares free and clear of any Liens.
To the Knowledge of Seller, the Founder and the Company has not granted any

3.2 _Organization of Each Member of the Company Group_. The Seller
and each member of the Company Group is a corporate or other entity duly
organized and validly existing under the Laws of its jurisdiction. Each member
of the Company Group is duly qualified to do business in the jurisdictions in
which the property owned, leased or operated by such entity or the nature of
the business which it conducts requires qualification, or if not so
qualified, such failure or failures, in the aggregate, would not have
a Material Adverse Effect on such member of the Company Group. No member of
the Company Group owns or is a party to any agreement to acquire, directly or
indirectly, any authorized capital or any other equity securities or interest
of any Person, other than of a Subsidiary or Affiliate listed in Section
3.1(b) of the Disclosure Letter, or ordinary cash management investments

(a) Subject to obtaining any necessary shareholder approvals, the
Founder and the Company has all necessary power and authority to enter
into this Agreement and the other Transaction Documents to which the Founder
or the Company is a party and to consummate the Transactions. Subject to
obtaining any necessary shareholder approvals, all corporate action necessary
to be taken by the Board of Directors or comparable governing body of the
Founder or the Company to authorize the delivery and performance of this
Agreement, the other Transaction Documents and all other documents and
instruments delivered by the Founder or the Company in connection with the
Transactions has been duly and validly taken. This Agreement and the other
Transaction Documents to which the Founder or the Company is a party, when
executed and delivered by the Founder or the Company, will constitute the
valid and binding obligations of the Founder or the Company, enforceable in
accordance with their respective terms, except (i) as enforceability may be
limited by applicable bankruptcy, insolvency, reorganization, moratorium,
fraudulent transfer or similar Laws of general application now or hereafter in
effect affecting the rights and remedies of creditors and by general
principles of equity (regardless of whether enforcement is sought in a
proceeding at law or in equity), (ii) as enforceability of any
indemnification provision may be limited by federal and state securities
laws and public policy of the United States, the Cayman Islands, the British
Virgin Islands or the PRC, and (iii) as enforceability may be limited by the
absence of shareholder approval.

  



  

(b) Subject to obtaining any necessary shareholder approvals,
neither the execution and delivery of this Agreement or any other
Transaction Document by the Seller, the Founder or the Company nor, assuming
shareholder approvals, the consummation of the Transactions by the Seller,
the Founder or the Company will (i) conflict with, result in a breach or
violation of or constitute (or with notice or lapse of time or both
constitute) a default under, (A) the Memorandum and Articles of Association of
the Company, (B) the certificate of incorporation, articles of association or
any other charter documents of any member of the Company Group, or (C) any Law
or Material Contract to which the Founder or the Company is a party or by
which it (or any of its properties or assets) is subject or bound; (ii)
result in the creation of, or give any Person the right to create, any Lien
upon the assets of the Founder or the Company; or (iii) terminate or modify,

3.4 _Consents and Approvals_. Subject to the provisions of the
Memorandum and Articles of Association of the Company, other than as set
forth in Section 3.4 of the Disclosure Letter, the execution and delivery of
this Agreement and the other Transaction Documents by the Seller, the Founder
and the Company, and the performance of and the consummation of the
Transactions by the Seller, the Founder and the Company, does not and will
not require any consent, approval, authorization or other action by, or filing
with or notification to, any Governmental Authority, except as would not
reasonably be expected to have Company Material Adverse Effect.

  



  

3.5 _Licenses, Permits, Etc_. Each member of the Company Group
possesses or will possess prior to the Closing all material Permits necessary
for the ownership and operation of their businesses, which necessary Permits
are described or are as set forth in Section 3.5 of the Disclosure Letter.

Company Group have previously been delivered to China Growth. All such
Permits are in full force and effect. Each member of the Company Group
has complied and will comply, and have caused or will cause their respective
officers, directors and employees to comply, in all material respect, with
all terms of such Permits, and will take or cause to be taken any and all
actions necessary to ensure that all such Permits remain in full force and
effect and that the terms of such Permits are not violated through the Closing
Date. No member of the Company Group is in default under any of such Permits
and no event has occurred and no condition exists which, with the giving of
notice, the passage of time, or both, would constitute a default thereunder.
Neither the execution and delivery of this Agreement, the other Transaction
Documents or any of the other documents or instruments contemplated hereby or
thereby nor the consummation of the Transactions nor compliance by any member
of the Company Group with any of the provisions hereof or thereof will result
in any suspension, revocation, impairment, forfeiture or nonrenewal of any
such Permit applicable to the business of any member of the Company Group,
except as would not reasonably be expected to have a Company Material Adverse
Effect.

  



  

3.6 _Taxes, Tax Returns and Audits_. The Company and each member of
the Company Group has filed on a timely basis (taking into account any
extensions received from the relevant taxing authorities) all returns and
reports pertaining to all Taxes that are or were required to be filed by the
Company or member of the Company Group with the appropriate taxing authorities
in all jurisdictions in which such returns and reports are or were required
to be filed, and all such returns and reports are true, correct and
complete in all material respects. All Taxes that are due from or may be
asserted against the Company or any member of the Company Group (including
deferred Taxes) in respect of or attributable to all periods ending on or
before the Closing Date have been or will be fully paid, deposited or
adequately provided for by the Company or member of the Company Group or are
being contested in good faith by appropriate proceedings. No issues have been
raised (or are currently pending) by any taxing authority in connection with
any of the returns and reports referred to above which might be determined
adversely to the Company or member of the Company Group. None of the members
of the Company Group nor the Company has given or requested to give waivers or
extensions of any statute of limitations with respect to the payment of
Taxes. There are no Tax Liens affecting the Company or member of the Company
Group or their respective assets which have not been satisfied or discharged
by payment or concession by the relevant taxing authority. Section 3.6 of the
Disclosure Letter sets forth an accurate and complete list of the Tax
obligations and liabilities that each member of the Company Group had at the
date of the signing of this Agreement.
