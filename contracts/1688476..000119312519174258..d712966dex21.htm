this Agreement, (a) at the Effective Time (as defined below), King Sub shall
be merged with and into Crown in accordance with the DGCL and the separate
corporate existence of King Sub shall thereupon cease, (b) Crown shall be the

2

    

  _Corporation_ ") such that immediately following the Merger, the Surviving
Corporation will be a wholly owned subsidiary of King and (c) the Merger shall
have such other effects as provided in this Agreement and in the DGCL.

1.2 _Closing_. The closing of the Merger (the " _Closing_ ") shall take

1.3 _Effective Time_. As soon as practicable following, and on the date
of, the Closing, Crown and King Sub will cause a certificate of merger
relating to the Merger (the " _Certificate of Merger_ ") to be executed,

time as may be agreed by the Parties in writing and specified in the
Certificate of Merger (such date and time, the " _Effective Time_ ").

ARTICLE II

 

MERGER CONSIDERATION; EFFECT OF THE MERGER ON CAPITAL STOCK

 

2.1 _Merger Consideration; Conversion of Shares of King Sub Common Stock;
Conversion of Shares of Crown Common Stock_. At the Effective Time, by virtue
of the Merger and without any action on the part of the Parties or any holder
of any capital stock of Crown, each share of common stock, par value $0.01 per
share, of King Sub issued and outstanding immediately before the Effective
Time shall be converted into and become one validly issued, fully paid and
non-assessable share of common stock, par value $0.01 per share, of the
Surviving Corporation, and each share of Crown Common Stock issued and
outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time other than Excluded Shares
(such shares of Crown Common Stock, the " _Eligible Shares_ ") shall
automatically be converted into the right to receive that number of validly
issued, fully paid and nonassessable shares of King Common Stock equal to
1.6149 (the " _Exchange Ratio_ ") (such number of shares of King Common Stock,
the " _Merger Consideration_ "). At the Effective Time, all Excluded Shares
shall, as a result of the Merger and without any action on the part of the
Parties or any holder of such Excluded Shares, be cancelled and shall cease to
exist, and no consideration shall be paid or delivered in exchange therefor.

2.2 _Cancellation of Shares of Crown Common Stock_. At the Effective
Time, by virtue of the Merger and without any action on the part of the
Parties or any holder of any capital stock of Crown, all of the Eligible
Shares shall represent the right to receive the aggregate
Merger Consideration pursuant to this _Article II_ , shall cease to be
outstanding, shall be cancelled and shall cease to exist, and each certificate
formerly representing any of the Eligible Shares (each, 

 



3

    

 a " _Certificate_ ") and each book-entry account formerly representing any
non-certificated Eligible Shares (each, a " _Book-Entry Share_ ") shall
thereafter represent only the right to receive the Merger Consideration and
the right, if any, to receive pursuant to _Section_ __ _ 3.5_ cash in lieu of
fractional shares into which such Eligible Shares have been converted
pursuant to this _Section_ __ _ 2.2_ and any dividends or other distributions
pursuant to _Section_ __ _ 3.3_; _provided_ , _that_ nothing in this
Agreement (including this _Article II_ and _Article III_ ) shall (a) affect
the right of the holders of shares of Crown Common Stock to receive any
dividend or other distribution that was declared on Crown Common Stock, and
the record date of which occurred, prior to the Effective Time in accordance
with the provisions of this Agreement or (b) give holders of Crown Common
Stock the right to receive any dividend or other distribution declared on King
Common Stock, and the record date of which occurred, prior to the Effective
Time in accordance with the provisions of this Agreement.

 

2.3 _Treatment of Long Term Incentive Awards_. This _Section_ __ _ 2.3_
shall govern the treatment of such Partys equity awards in connection with
the Transactions.

(a) _Crown Long Term Incentive Awards_.

(i) Each Crown Stock Option Award, whether vested or unvested, that is
outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time shall, at the Effective
Time, automatically and without any action on the part of the holders thereof,
be assumed by King and remain subject to the same terms and conditions as were
applicable to such Crown Stock Option Award, but shall be converted into an
option to purchase that number of shares of King Common Stock (rounded down to
the nearest whole share) equal to the product of (x) the number of shares of
Crown Common Stock subject to such Crown Stock Option Award immediately prior
to the Effective Time and (y) the Exchange Ratio, at an exercise price per
share of King Common Stock (rounded up to the nearest whole cent) equal to (A)
the exercise price per share of such Crown Stock Option Award divided by (B)
the Exchange Ratio (a " _Converted Option Award_ ").

 

(ii) Each Crown Performance Share Award other than a Vested Crown
Performance Share Award that is outstanding immediately prior to the
Effective Time shall, at the Effective Time, automatically and without any
action on the part of the holders thereof, be assumed by King and remain
subject to the same terms and conditions (including the Time-Based
Vesting Schedule (as defined in the applicable award agreement pursuant to
which the Crown Performance Share Award was granted but excluding continued
performance-based vesting requirements)) as were applicable to such Crown
Performance Share Award, but shall be converted into an award with respect to
a number of shares of King Common Stock (rounded up or down to the nearest
whole share) equal to the product of (x) the number of shares of Crown Common
Stock subject to such Crown Performance Share Award and (y) the Exchange
Ratio (a " _Converted Performance Share Award_ "). For purposes of the
immediately preceding sentence, the number of shares of Crown Common Stock
subject to such Crown Performance Share Award shall be deemed to be the
number of shares subject to the Crown Performance Share Award with performance
deemed achieved at target performance levels. Each Vested Crown Performance
Share Award outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time shall, at the
Effective Time, be deemed to have been settled with shares of Crown Common
Stock, and the holder of such Vested Crown Performance Share Award shall have
the right to receive the Merger Consideration in the manner set forth in 
_Section_ __ _ 2.1_.

 



4

    

(iii) Each Crown RSU Award that is outstanding immediately prior to the
Effective Time shall, at the Effective Time, automatically and without any
action on the part of the holders thereof, be assumed by King and remain
subject to the same terms and conditions as were applicable to such Crown RSU
Award, but shall be converted into an award with respect to a number of
shares of King Common Stock (rounded up or down to the nearest whole share)
equal to the product of (x) the number of shares of Crown Common Stock subject
to such Crown RSU Award and (y) the Exchange Ratio (a " _Converted RSU Award_
"). Following the Effective Time, each Converted RSU Award shall continue to
be governed by the same terms and conditions (including, as applicable,
vesting and forfeiture terms) as were applicable to the Crown RSU Award
immediately prior to the Effective Time.

(iv) Each Crown Restricted Stock Award that is outstanding immediately
prior to the Effective Time shall, automatically and without any action on the
part of the holder thereof, be assumed by King and remain subject to the same
terms and conditions as were applicable to such Crown Restricted Stock Award,
but shall be converted into an award with respect to a number of shares of
King Common Stock (rounded up to the nearest whole share) equal to the product
of (x) the number of shares of Crown Common Stock subject to such Crown
Restricted Stock Award and (y) the Exchange Ratio (a " _Converted Restricted
Share Award_ ").

 

(b) _Crown Actions_. At or prior to the Effective Time, Crown and the
Crown Board (and the compensation committee of the Crown Board), as

necessary to effectuate the treatment of Crown Options, Crown RSU Awards,
Crown Performance Share Awards, and Crown Restricted Stock Awards,
(collectively, the " _Crown Equity Awards_ ") pursuant to _Section_ __ _
2.3(a)_.

 

(c) _King Actions_. King shall take all actions that are necessary for the
treatment of Crown Equity Awards pursuant to _Section_ __ _ 2.3(a)_,
including the reservation, issuance and listing of King Common Stock as

Awards_ ") following the Effective Time (and giving effect to this _Section_
__ _ 2.3_) is required under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended (the "
_Securities Act_ "), King shall file with the Securities and Exchange
Commission (the " _SEC_ ") as soon as reasonably practicable on or after the
Closing Date a registration statement on Form S-8 with respect to such
interests of King Common Stock, and shall use its reasonable best efforts to
maintain the effectiveness of such registration statement for so long as the
relevant Crown Stock Plan or other Crown Benefit Plans, Crown Equity Awards
or Converted Awards, as applicable, remain outstanding or in effect and such
registration of interests therein or the shares of King Common Stock issuable
thereunder continues to be required.

 

(d) _Future Grants of Equity Awards_. Notwithstanding anything in
_Section_ __ _ 2.3(a)_ to the contrary, but subject to _Section_ __ _
7.1(a)_ to the extent the terms of any Crown Equity Award (i) granted on or
after the date of this Agreement and not in violation of this Agreement or
(ii) mutually agreed by the Parties and a holder of any Crown Equity Award
(or Converted Award) expressly provide for treatment in connection with the
occurrence of the Effective Time that is different from the treatment
prescribed by this  _Section_ __ _ 2.3_, then in each case

 



5

    

 of clause (i) and (ii), the terms of such Crown Equity Award (or Converted
Award), as applicable or so agreed by the Parties and such holder, shall
control (and the applicable provisions of this _Section_ __ _ 2.3_ shall not
apply).

agreement among King, the stockholders of Crown party to the
Crown Registration Rights Agreement and the stockholders of King party to the
King Stockholders Agreement resolving any inconsistencies between the
registration rights granted pursuant to the Crown Registration Rights
Agreement and the King Stockholders Agreement.

3.1 _Exchange Agent_. King shall deposit or cause to be deposited with an
exchange agent selected by King with Crowns prior approval (which approval
shall not to be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed) to serve as the
exchange agent (the " _Exchange Agent_ "), for the benefit of the holders of
Eligible Shares, (a) at or prior to the Effective Time, an aggregate number
of shares of King Common Stock to be issued in non-certificated book-entry
form sufficient to deliver the number of shares of King Common Stock required
to be delivered in respect of Eligible Shares pursuant to _Section_ __ _
2.1_ and (b) as promptly as reasonably practicable following the Effective
Time, an aggregate amount of cash in U.S. Dollars sufficient to deliver

Effective Time, any dividends or other distributions, if any, to which the
holders of Eligible Shares may be entitled pursuant to _Section_ __ _ 3.3_
with both a record and payment date after the Effective Time and prior to the
surrender of such Eligible Shares (such shares of King Common Stock, cash and
the amount of any dividends or other distributions deposited with the Exchange
Agent pursuant to this _Section_ __ _ 3.1_ being the " _Exchange Fund_ ").
The Exchange Fund shall not be used for any purpose other than a purpose
expressly provided for in this Agreement. The cash portion of the Exchange
Fund may be deposited or invested by the Exchange Agent as reasonably
directed by King; _provided_ , _that_ no such deposit or investment (or any
loss resulting therefrom) shall affect the amount of cash payable to former
holders of Crown Common Stock pursuant to

 



6

    

 the provisions of this _Article III_. Any interest and other income
resulting from such deposit may become part of the Exchange Fund, and any
amounts in excess of the amounts payable pursuant to this Agreement shall be
promptly returned to King.

3.2 _Procedures for Surrender_.

 

(a) With respect to Certificates, as promptly as reasonably practicable
(but in any event within three (3) Business Days) after the Effective Time,
King shall cause the Exchange Agent to mail to each holder of record of each
such Certificate (i) a notice advising such holder of the effectiveness of the
Merger, (ii) a letter of transmittal in customary form specifying that
delivery shall be effected, and risk of loss and title to a Certificate shall
pass, only upon delivery of the Certificate (or affidavit of loss in lieu of a
Certificate as provided in  _Section_ __ _ 3.7_) to the Exchange Agent or
transfer of Book-Entry Shares not held through DTC (each, a " _Non-DTC Book-
Entry Share_") to the Exchange Agent (including customary provisions with
respect to delivery of an "agents message" with respect to Non-DTC Book-Entry
Shares) (the " _Letter of Transmittal_ ") and (iii) instructions for
surrendering a Certificate (or affidavit of loss in lieu of a Certificate as
provided in _Section_ __ _ 3.7_) in exchange for the aggregate Merger
Consideration payable in respect thereof to the Exchange Agent. Upon
surrender to the Exchange Agent of a Certificate (or affidavit of loss in
lieu of a Certificate as provided in _Section_ __ _ 3.7_) together with a
duly executed and completed Letter of Transmittal and such other documents as
may reasonably be required pursuant to such instructions, King shall cause
the Exchange Agent to mail to each holder of record of any such Certificate in
exchange therefore, as promptly as reasonably practicable thereafter, (A) a
statement reflecting the number of whole shares of King Common Stock, if any,
that such holder is entitled to receive in non-certificated book-entry form
pursuant to _Article II_ in the name of such record holder and (B) a check in
the amount (after giving effect to any required Tax withholdings as provided
in _Section_ __ _ 3.8_) of (x) any cash in lieu of fractional shares that
such holder is entitled to receive pursuant to  _Section_ __ _ 3.5_ plus (y)
any unpaid cash dividends and any other dividends or other distributions that
such holder has the right to receive pursuant to this _Article III_. Any
Certificate that has been so surrendered shall be cancelled by the Exchange
Agent.

(b) With respect to Non-DTC Book-Entry Shares, as promptly as reasonably
practicable (but in any event within three (3) Business Days) after the
Effective Time, King shall cause the Exchange Agent to mail to each holder of
record of a Non-DTC Book-Entry Share (i) a notice advising such holder of the
effectiveness of the Merger, (ii) a Letter of Transmittal and (iii)
instructions for transferring the Non-DTC Book-Entry Shares in exchange for
the aggregate Merger Consideration payable in respect thereof to the Exchange
Agent to the Exchange Agent. Upon surrender to the Exchange Agent of Non-DTC
Book-Entry Shares by book-receipt of an "agents message" by the Exchange
Agent in accordance with the terms of the Letter of Transmittal and
accompanying instructions, King shall cause the Exchange Agent to mail to
each holder of record of any such Non-DTC Book-Entry Shares in exchange
therefore, as promptly as reasonably practicable (but in any event within
three (3) Business Days) after the Effective Time, (A) a statement reflecting
the number of whole shares of King Common Stock, if any, that such holder is
entitled to receive in non-certificated book-entry form pursuant to
_Article II_ in the name of such record holder and (B) a check in the amount
(after giving effect to any required Tax withholdings as provided in _Section_
__ _ 3.8_) of (x) any cash in lieu of fractional shares that such holder is
entitled to receive pursuant to _Section_ __ _ 3.5_ plus (y) any unpaid cash
dividends and any other dividends or other distributions that such holder has
the right to receive pursuant to this _Article III_. 

 



7

    

(c) With respect to Book-Entry Shares held through DTC, Crown and King
shall cooperate to establish procedures with the Exchange Agent and DTC to
ensure that the Exchange Agent will transmit to DTC or its nominees as soon as
practicable after the Effective Time, upon surrender of Eligible Shares held
of record by DTC or its nominees in accordance with DTCs customary surrender
procedures, the aggregate Merger Consideration issuable and payable in respect
thereof, cash in lieu of fractional shares that such holder is entitled to
receive pursuant to  _Section_ __ _ 3.5_, if any, and any unpaid cash
dividends and any other dividends or other distributions, in each case, that
such holder has the right to receive pursuant to this _Article III_.

 

(d) No interest will be paid or accrued on any amount payable for Eligible
Shares pursuant to this _Article III_. 

3.3 _Distributions with Respect to Unexchanged Shares of Crown Common
Stock_. All shares of King Common Stock to be issued pursuant to the Merger
shall be deemed issued and outstanding as of the Effective Time and whenever a
dividend or other distribution is declared by King in respect of King Common
Stock, the record date for which is at or after the Effective Time, that
declaration shall include dividends or other distributions in respect of all
shares of King Common Stock issuable pursuant to this Agreement. No dividends
or other distributions in respect of shares of King Common Stock with
a record date at or after the Effective Time shall be paid to any holder of
any unsurrendered Certificate until the Certificate (or affidavit of loss in
lieu of a Certificate as provided in _Section_ __ _ 3.7_) is surrendered
for exchange in accordance with this _Article III_. Subject to applicable
Law, there shall be issued or paid to the holder of record of the whole shares
of King Common Stock issued in exchange for Eligible Shares in accordance with
_Article II_ without interest, (a) at the time of such surrender, the
dividends or other distributions with a record date at or after the Effective
Time theretofore payable with respect to such whole shares of King Common
Stock and not paid, and (b) at the appropriate payment date, the dividends or
other distributions payable with respect to such whole shares of King Common
Stock with a record date at or after the Effective Time and prior to surrender
but with a payment date subsequent to surrender.

3.4 _No Transfers_. From and after the Effective Time, there shall be no
transfers on the stock transfer books of Crown of the shares of Crown Common
Stock that were outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time. From and
after the Effective Time, the holders of Certificates or Book-Entry Shares
shall cease to have any rights with respect to such shares of Crown Common
Stock except as otherwise provided herein or by applicable Law. If, after the
Effective Time, Certificates are presented to King for any reason, they shall
be cancelled and exchanged as provided in this Agreement.

3.5 _Fractional Shares_. Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the
contrary, no fractional shares of King Common Stock will be issued upon the
conversion of shares of Crown Common Stock pursuant to _Section_ __ _ 2.1_.
All fractional shares of King Common Stock that a holder of Eligible Shares
would be otherwise entitled to receive pursuant to _Section_ __ _ 2.1_ but
for this _Section_ __ _ 3.5_, shall be aggregated and such holder shall be
entitled to receive a cash payment, without interest, in lieu of any such
fractional share, equal to the product (rounded to the nearest

 



8

    

 whole cent) of (a) the amount of such fractional share interest in a share
of King Common Stock to which such holder would, but for this _Section_ __ _
3.5_, be entitled under _Section_ __ _ 2.1_, and (b) an amount equal to the
average of the daily volume weighted average price per share of King Common
Stock on the NYSE (as such daily volume weighted average price per share is
reported by Bloomberg L.P. or, if not reported therein, in another
authoritative source mutually selected by King and Crown) calculated for the
ten (10) consecutive Trading Days ending on the second (2nd) full Trading Day
immediately prior to (and not including) the Closing Date. No holder of
Eligible Shares shall be entitled by virtue of the right to receive cash in
lieu of fractional shares of King Common Stock described in this _Section_ __
_ 3.5_ to any dividends, voting rights or any other rights in respect of any
fractional share interests in a share of King Common Stock to which such
holder would, but for this _Section_ __ _ 3.5_, be entitled under _Section_
__ _ 2.1_. The payment of cash in lieu of fractional shares of King Common
Stock is not a separately bargained-for consideration but merely represents a
mechanical rounding-off of the fractions in the exchange.

3.6 _Termination of Exchange Fund_. Any portion of the Exchange Fund
(including the proceeds of any deposit of the Exchange Fund and any shares of
King Common Stock) that remains unclaimed as of the date that is twelve (12)
months after the Closing Date shall be delivered to King. Any holder of
Eligible Shares who has not theretofore complied with this _Article III_
shall thereafter look only to King for delivery of the Merger Consideration,
cash in lieu of fractional shares of King Common Stock, if any, and any unpaid
cash dividends and any other dividends or other distributions, in each case,
that such holder has the right to receive pursuant to this _Article III_.

 

3.7 _Lost, Stolen or Destroyed Certificates_. In the event that any
Certificate shall have been lost, stolen or destroyed, upon the making of an
affidavit of that fact by the Person claiming such Certificate to be lost,
stolen or destroyed and the posting by such Person of a bond in customary
amount and upon such terms as may be required as indemnity against any claim
that may be made against it with respect to such Certificate, the Exchange
Agent will issue in exchange for such lost, stolen or destroyed Certificate,
the Merger Consideration, cash in lieu of fractional shares of King Common
Stock, if any, and any unpaid cash dividends and any other dividends or other
distributions, in each case, payable or issuable pursuant to this _Article
III_ , as if such lost, stolen or destroyed Certificate had been surrendered.

 

3.8 _Withholding Rights_. Each of King, LLC Sub, the Exchange Agent and
any other withholding agent shall be entitled to deduct and withhold from the
consideration otherwise payable pursuant to this Agreement to any holder of
shares of Crown Common Stock and Crown Equity Awards such amounts as it is
required to deduct and withhold with respect to the making of such payment
under the Code or any other applicable state, local or foreign Tax Law. To the
extent that amounts are so withheld by King, the Exchange Agent or such other
withholding agent, as applicable, such withheld amounts (a) shall be timely
remitted by King, the Exchange Agent or such other withholding agent, as
applicable, to the applicable Governmental Entity, and (b) shall be treated
for all purposes of this Agreement as having been paid to the holder of
shares of Crown Common Stock and Crown Equity Awards in respect of which such
deduction and withholding was made by King, the Exchange Agent, or such other
withholding agent.

 



9

    

3.9 _Adjustments to Prevent Dilution_. Notwithstanding anything in this
Agreement to the contrary, if, from the date of this Agreement to the earlier
of the Effective Time and termination in accordance with _Article IX_ , the
issued and outstanding shares of Crown Common Stock or securities convertible
or exchangeable into or exercisable for shares of Crown Common Stock or the
issued and outstanding shares of King Common Stock or securities convertible
or exchangeable into or exercisable for shares of King Common Stock, shall
have been changed into a different number of shares or securities or a
different class by reason of any reclassification, stock split (including a
reverse stock split), stock dividend or distribution, recapitalization,
merger, issuer tender or exchange offer, or other similar transaction, or a
stock dividend or rights offering with a record date within such period shall
have been declared, then the Merger Consideration shall be equitably adjusted
to provide the holders of shares of Crown Common Stock and King Common Stock
the same economic effect as contemplated by this Agreement prior to such
event, and such items, so adjusted shall, from and after the date of such
event, be the Merger Consideration. Nothing in this _Section_ __ _
3.9_ shall be construed to permit the Parties to take any action except to
the extent consistent with, and not otherwise prohibited by, the terms of this
Agreement.

 

3.10 _No Liability_. None of Crown, King, or the Exchange Agent shall be
liable to any Person in respect of any portion of the Merger Consideration
delivered to a public official pursuant to any applicable abandoned property,
escheat or similar Law. If any Certificate or Book-Entry Share has not been
surrendered prior to seven (7) years after the Effective Time, or immediately
prior to such earlier date on which any shares of King Common Stock, any cash
in lieu of fractional shares of King Common Stock and any unpaid cash
dividends and any other dividends or other distributions, in each case, that
a holder of any Eligible Shares has the right to receive pursuant to this
_Article III_ in respect of such Certificate or Book-Entry Share would
otherwise escheat to or become property of any Governmental Entity, any such
shares, cash, dividends or other distributions in respect of such Certificate
or Book-Entry Share shall, to the extent permitted by applicable Law, become
the property of King, free and clear of all claims or interests of any Person
previously entitled thereto.

any Contract binding upon such Party or any of its Subsidiaries, except, in
the case of clause (ii) or (iii) above, as would not, individually or in the

Party.

 

5.5 _Reports; Internal Controls_.

 

(a) Such Party has filed or furnished, as applicable, on a timely basis,
all forms, schedules, prospectuses, statements, certifications, reports and
documents required to be filed or furnished by it with the SEC pursuant to the
Exchange Act or the Securities Act since January 1, 2017 (the " _Applicable
Date_ ") (the forms, schedules, prospectuses, statements, reports and
documents filed or furnished to the SEC since the Applicable Date and those
filed or furnished to the SEC subsequent to the date of this Agreement,
including any amendments thereto, such Partys " _Reports_ "). Each of such
Partys Reports, at the time of its filing or being furnished (and, in the
case of registration statements and proxy statements, on the dates of
effectiveness and the dates of mailing, respectively), complied, or if not
yet filed or furnished, will comply in all material respects with the
applicable requirements of the Securities Act, the Exchange Act and the
Sarbanes-Oxley Act and the rules and regulations thereunder. As of
their respective dates (or, if amended or superseded by a filing prior to the
date of this Agreement, then as of the date of such filing), such Partys
Reports did not, and any of such Partys Reports filed with or furnished to
the 

 



14

    

 SEC subsequent to the date of this Agreement will not, contain any untrue
statement of a material fact or omit to state a material fact required to be
stated therein or necessary to make the statements made therein, in light of
the circumstances in which they were made, not misleading. No Subsidiary of
such Party is subject to periodic reporting requirements of the Exchange Act
other than as part of such Partys consolidated group or required to file any
form, report or other document with the SEC, the NYSE, any other stock
exchange or comparable Governmental Entity other than routine and ordinary
filings (such as filings regarding ownership holdings or transfers).

 

(b) Such Party is, and has been at all times since the Applicable Date, in
compliance in all material respects with the applicable listing and corporate
governance rules and regulations of the NYSE. Except as permitted by the
Exchange Act, including Sections 13(k)(2) and 13(k)(3) thereunder, or the
rules and regulations promulgated by the SEC, neither such Party nor any of
its Affiliates has made, arranged or modified (in any material way) any
extensions of credit in the form of a personal loan to any executive officer
or director of such Party.

 

(c) Except as set forth on Section 5.5 of such Partys Disclosure Letter,
since the Applicable Date, such Party has maintained disclosure controls and
procedures required by Rule 13a-15(e) or 15d-15(e) under the Exchange Act.
Such disclosure controls and procedures are effective to ensure that
information required to be disclosed by such Party under the Exchange Act is
recorded and reported within the time periods specified in the Exchange Act
and all such information required to be disclosed under the Exchange Act is
accumulated and communicated to the management of such Party, as appropriate,
to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure.

 

(d) Neither Party is a party to, or has any commitment to become a party
to, any joint venture, partnership agreement or any similar Contract
(including any Contract relating to any transaction, arrangement or
relationship between or among such Party, on the one hand, and any
unconsolidated Affiliate, including any structured finance, special purpose or
limited purpose entity or Person, on the other hand (such as any agreement
described in Section 303(a)(4) of Regulation S-K promulgated under the
Exchange Act)) where the purpose or effect of such arrangement is to avoid
disclosure of any material transaction involving, or material liabilities of,
such Party in such Partys consolidated financial statements.

 

(e) Such Party maintains "internal control over financial reporting" (as
defined in Rule 13a-15(f) or 15d-15(f), as applicable, under the Exchange
Act). Such internal control over financial reporting is effective in providing
reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the
preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with
United States generally accepted accounting principles (" _GAAP_ ") and
includes policies and procedures that (i) pertain to the maintenance of
records that in reasonable detail accurately and fairly reflect the
transactions and dispositions of the assets of such Party, (ii) provide
reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit
preparation of financial statements in accordance with GAAP, and that receipts
and expenditures of such Party are being made only in accordance with
authorizations of management and directors of such Party, and (iii)
provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of
unauthorized acquisition, use or disposition of such Partys assets that could
have a material effect on its financial statements. The records, systems,
controls, data and information of such Party and its Subsidiaries that are
used in the systems of disclosure controls and procedures and of financial
reporting controls and

 



15

    

 procedures described above are recorded, stored, maintained and operated
under means that are under the exclusive ownership and direct control of such
Party or a wholly owned Subsidiary of such Party or its accountants, except
as would not reasonably be expected to adversely affect or disrupt, in any
material respect, such Partys systems of disclosure controls and procedures
and of financial reporting controls and procedures or the reports generated
thereby.

(f) Since the Applicable Date, none of such Partys auditors, such
Partys board of directors and the audit committee of the board of directors
of such Party has received any oral or written notification of (i) any
"significant deficiency" in the design or operation of its internal controls
over financial reporting that are reasonably likely to adversely affect such
Partys ability to record, process, summarize and report financial information
and has identified for such Partys auditors, such Partys board of directors
and the audit committee of the board of directors of such Party any "material
weakness" in internal controls over financial reporting and (ii) any fraud,
whether or not material, that involves management or other employees who have
a significant role in such Partys internal controls over financial
reporting. Since the Applicable Date, no material complaints from any source
regarding accounting, internal accounting controls or auditing matters, and no
concerns from such Partys employees regarding questionable accounting or
auditing matters, have been received by such Party. Since the Applicable Date,
no attorney representing such Party or any of its Subsidiaries, whether or not
employed by such Party or any of its Subsidiaries, has reported evidence of a
material violation of securities Laws or breach of fiduciary duty or similar
violation by such Party or any of its officers, directors, employees or agents
to such Partys chief legal officer, audit committee (or other committee
designated for the purpose) pursuant to the rules adopted pursuant to Section
307 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act or such Partys policy contemplating such
reporting, including in instances not required by those rules.

5.6 _Financial Statements_. The financial statements of such Party
included in the Reports of such Party at the time filed (and, in the case of
registration statements and proxy statements, on the dates of effectiveness
and the dates of mailing, respectively) complied as to form in all material
respects with applicable accounting requirements and with the published rules
and regulations of the SEC with respect thereto, were prepared in all material
respects in accordance with GAAP during the periods involved (except as may be
indicated in the notes thereto or, in the case of unaudited statements, as
permitted by Form 10-Q of the SEC), and fairly present in all material
respects (subject in the case of unaudited statements to normal, recurring
audit adjustments which are not material, and to any other adjustments
described therein, including the notes thereto) the consolidated financial
position of such Party and its consolidated Subsidiaries as at the dates
thereof and the consolidated results of their operations and cash flows for
the periods then ended.

Agreement, (ii) incurred in the Ordinary Course since the date of such Partys
most recent consolidated balance sheets included in such Partys Reports
filed prior to the date of this Agreement, or (iii) incurred in connection
with or contemplated by this Agreement, there are no obligations or
liabilities of such Party or any of its Subsidiaries that would be required
by GAAP to be set forth on a consolidated balance sheet of such Party, whether
or not accrued, contingent or otherwise, except as would not, individually or
in the aggregate, reasonably be expected to have a Material Adverse Effect
on such Party.

(c) Neither such Party nor any of its Subsidiaries is a party to or subject
to the provisions of any material judgment, order, writ, injunction, decree
or award of any Governmental Entity, except as would not, individually or in

such Party. There has not been since the Applicable Date nor are there
currently any internal investigations or inquiries being conducted by such
Party, such Partys board of directors (or any committee thereof) or any third

deceptive conduct or other misfeasance or malfeasance issues.

writing) claims (other than routine claims for benefits) or Proceedings by a
Governmental Entity by, on behalf of or against any Benefit Plan or any trust

17

    

(c) Each Benefit Plan that is intended to be qualified under Section
401(a) of the Code has received a determination or opinion letter from the
Internal Revenue Service to the effect that such plan is qualified and the
plans related trust is exempt from federal income Taxes under Sections
401(a) and 501(a) of the Code, respectively, and to the Knowledge of such
Party, nothing has occurred that would be reasonably expected to materially
adversely affect the qualification or Tax exemption of any such Benefit Plan.
Except as would not, individually or in the aggregate, reasonably be expected
to have a Material Adverse Effect, with respect to each Benefit Plan, neither
such Party nor any of its Subsidiaries has engaged in a transaction in
connection with which such Party or any of its Subsidiaries reasonably could
be subject to either a civil penalty assessed pursuant to Section 409 or
502(i) of ERISA or a Tax imposed pursuant to Section 4975 or 4976 of the Code.

(f) Except as set forth in Section 5.9(f) of such Partys Disclosure

accelerate the time of payment or vesting, or increase the amount of
compensation due to any such Service Provider, (iii) directly or indirectly
cause either such Party to transfer or set aside any assets to fund

in cash or property or the vesting of property) to any "disqualified
individual" (as such term is defined in Treasury Regulation Section 1.280G-1)
that would, individually or in combination with any other such payment,
constitute an "excess parachute payment" (as defined in Section 280G(b)(l) of
the Code).

 

(g) Neither such Party nor any of its Subsidiaries has any obligation to
provide, and no Benefit Plan or other agreement of such Party of any of its

contract, _provided_ that if Crown (acting under the direction of the Crown
Board) or King (acting under the direction of the Special Committee), as
applicable, determines in good faith after consultation with such Partys
legal counsel that the failure to waive a particular standstill provision
would be a breach of such Partys fiduciary duties under applicable Law, then
such Party may waive such standstill provision, solely to the extent
necessary to permit a third party to make and pursue an Acquisition Proposal;
or

 

(vi) resolve, agree or publicly propose to, or permit the relevant Party,
any of its Subsidiaries or any of its or their Representatives to agree or

the Person who made such Acquisition Proposal, _provided_ _that_ such
information has previously been made available to, or is made available to,

time such information is made available to such Person and that, prior to
furnishing any such information, Crown or King, as applicable, receives from
the Person making such Acquisition Proposal an executed confidentiality
agreement containing terms that are generally not less restrictive to the
other party than the terms in the Confidentiality Agreement are on Crown or
King, as applicable ( _provided_ _that_ such confidentiality agreement need
not include any "standstill" terms), and which confidentiality agreement does
not prohibit compliance with either of Crown or King with this _Section_ __ _
7.2(b)(i)_; and

 

(ii) participate in any discussions or negotiations with any such Person
regarding such Acquisition Proposal;

 

in each case, if, and only if, prior to taking any action described in clauses
(i) or (ii) above, the Crown Board or the Special Committee, as applicable,
determines in good faith after consultation with its outside legal counsel
that, based on the information then available and after consultation with its
financial advisor, (A) such Acquisition Proposal either constitutes a
Superior Proposal or could reasonably be expected to result in a Superior
Proposal and (B) failure to engage in such activities would reasonably be
expected to be inconsistent with the relevant directors fiduciary duties
under applicable Law.

 

(c) _Representatives_. Any violation of the restrictions contained in
_Section_ __ _ 7.2(a)_ by any of a Partys Representatives shall be deemed
to be a breach of _Section_ __ _ 7.2(a)_ by such Party. The Parties shall use
reasonable best efforts to ensure that their respective Representatives are
aware of the provisions of _Section_ __ _ 7.2(a)_.

 



38

    

(d) _Notice of Acquisition Proposals_. Crown and King each shall promptly
(and, in any event, within twenty-four (24) hours) give notice to the other
Party if (i) any inquiries, proposals or offers with respect to an Acquisition
Proposal are received by, (ii) any information is requested in connection
with any Acquisition Proposal from, or (iii) any discussions or negotiations
with respect to an Acquisition Proposal are sought to be initiated or
continued with, it or any of its Representatives, setting forth in such notice
the name of such Person and the material terms and conditions of any
proposals or offers (including, if applicable, complete copies of any written
requests, proposals or offers, including proposed agreements) and thereafter
shall keep the other Party reasonably informed, on a current basis (and, in

including any committee thereof (including, as applicable, the Special
Committee), shall not:

to withhold, withdraw, qualify or modify) the Crown Recommendation or the King

case, within ten (10) Business Days after the commencement of such tender
offer or exchange offer (or, if earlier, prior to the Crown Stockholders
Meeting or King Stockholders Meeting, as applicable) (for the avoidance of
doubt, the taking of no position or a neutral position by the Crown Board or
the King Board, as applicable, in respect of the acceptance of any such
tender offer or exchange offer as of the end of such period shall constitute a
failure to recommend against acceptance of any such offer);

 

(D) approve or recommend, or publicly declare advisable or publicly propose
to approve or recommend, or publicly propose to enter into, any letter of
intent, memorandum of understanding, agreement in principle, acquisition
agreement, merger agreement, option agreement, joint venture agreement,

agreement referred to in _Section_ __ _ 7.2(b)_ entered into in compliance
with _Section_ __ _ 7.2(b)_) relating to any Acquisition Proposal (an "
_Alternative Acquisition Agreement_ ", and any of the actions set forth in

7.2(e)(i)_, a " _Change of Recommendation_ "); or

 



39

    

(E) cause or permit Crown or King, as applicable, to enter into
an Alternative Acquisition Agreement.

(ii) Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the contrary, prior to
the time, but not after, in the case of Crown, the Requisite Crown Vote is
obtained or, in the case of King, the Requisite King Vote is obtained, if an
unsolicited, bona fide written Acquisition Proposal received after the date of
this Agreement that did not arise from or in connection with a breach of such
Partys obligations set forth in _Section_ __ _ 7.2(a)_ is received by Crown
or King, as applicable, and is not withdrawn, and the Crown Board or the
Special Committee, as applicable, determines in good faith, after
consultation with its outside legal counsel and its financial advisor that (A)
such Acquisition Proposal constitutes a Superior Proposal and (B) failure to
consider such Acquisition Proposal would reasonably be expected to be
inconsistent with the relevant directors fiduciary duties under applicable
Law, the Crown Board or the King Board (at the recommendation of the Special
Committee), as applicable, may effect a Change of Recommendation; _provided_
, _however_ , that, prior to taking such action, Crown has given King or King
has given Crown, as applicable, written notice of such action and the basis
therefor four (4) Business Days in advance, which notice shall set forth in
writing that the Crown Board or the King Board (at the recommendation of the
Special Committee), as applicable, intends to consider whether to take such
action (such notice, the " _Board Recommendation Notice_ ") and comply in
form, substance and delivery with the provisions of _Section_ __ _ 7.2(d)_.
After giving such Board Recommendation Notice and prior to making a Change of
Recommendation as described above, Crown or King, as applicable, shall
negotiate in good faith with the other Party (to the extent the other Party
wishes to negotiate), to make such revisions to the terms of this Agreement as
would cause such Acquisition Proposal to cease to be a Superior Proposal. At
the end of the four (4) Business Day period, prior to and as a condition to
making a Change of Recommendation as described above, the Crown Board or the
Special Committee, as applicable, shall take into account any adjustments
or revisions to the terms of this Agreement irrevocably proposed in writing
by the other Party and any other information offered by the other Party in
response to the Board Recommendation Notice, and shall have determined in good
faith after consultation with its outside legal counsel and its financial
advisor that (A) the Superior Proposal would continue to constitute a Superior
Proposal, if such changes offered in writing by the other Party were to be
given effect, and (B) failure to pursue such Superior Proposal would
reasonably be expected to be inconsistent with the relevant directors
fiduciary duties under applicable Law. Any amendment to the financial terms
and any other material amendment to any Acquisition Proposal will be deemed
to be a new Acquisition Proposal for purposes of _Section_ __ _ 7.2(d)_ and
this _Section_ __ _ 7.2(e)(ii)_ and require a new Board Recommendation
Notice, except that references in this _Section_ __ _ 7.2(e)(ii)_ to "four
(4) Business Days" shall be deemed to be references to "two (2) Business Days"
and such two (2) Business Day period shall expire at 11:59 p.m. (New
York Time) on the second (2nd) Business Day immediately following the day on
which such new Board Recommendation Notice is delivered (it being understood
and agreed that in no event shall any such additional two (2) Business Day
period be deemed to shorten the initial four (4) Business Day period).

(iii) Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the contrary, prior to
the time, but not after, in the case of Crown, the Requisite Crown Vote is
obtained or, in the case of King, the Requisite King Vote is obtained, the
Crown Board or the King Board (at the recommendation of the Special
Committee), as applicable, may effect a Change of Recommendation if (A) an
Intervening Event has occurred, and (B) prior to taking such action,

 



40

    

 the Crown Board or the Special Committee, as applicable, determines in good
faith, after consultation with its outside legal counsel and its financial
advisor, that failure to take such action in response to such Intervening
Event would reasonably be expected to be inconsistent with the relevant
directors fiduciary duties under applicable Law; _provided_ , _however_ ,
that prior to making such Change of Recommendation, Crown has given King or
King has given Crown, as applicable, a Board Recommendation Notice four (4)
Business Days in advance, which notice shall comply in form, substance and
delivery with the provisions of _Section_ __ _ 7.2(d)_ and include a
reasonably detailed description of such Intervening Event. After giving such
Board Recommendation Notice and prior to effecting a Change of Recommendation,
Crown or King, as applicable, shall negotiate in good faith with the
other Party (to the extent the other Party wishes to negotiate), to make such
revisions to the terms of this Agreement as would cause such Effect to cease
to be an Intervening Event. At the end of the four (4) Business Day period,
prior to and as a condition to effecting a Change of Recommendation, the
Crown Board or the Special Committee, as applicable, shall take into account
any adjustments or revisions to the terms of this Agreement irrevocably
proposed in writing by the other Party and any other information offered by
the other Party in response to the Board Recommendation Notice, and shall have
determined in good faith after consultation with its outside legal counsel and
its financial advisor that (I) such Intervening Event remains in effect and
(II) the failure to effect a Change of Recommendation in response to such
Intervening Event would reasonably be expected to be inconsistent with the
relevant directors fiduciary duties under applicable Law if such adjustments
or revisions irrevocably offered in writing by the other Party were to be
given effect.

 

(f) _Certain Permitted Disclosure_. Nothing contained in this _Section_ __
_ 7.2_ shall prohibit Crown or King, as applicable, from (i) complying with
its disclosure obligations under applicable United States federal or state Law
with regard to an Acquisition Proposal or (ii) making any "stop, look and
listen" or similar communication of the type contemplated by Rule 14d-9(f)
under the Exchange Act pending disclosure of its position thereunder;
_provided_ , _that_ , the foregoing notwithstanding, neither King nor Crown
may effect a Change of Recommendation except in accordance with _Section_ __ _
7.2(e)(ii)_ or _Section_ __ _ 7.2(e)(iii)_.

 

(g) _Existing Discussions_. Crown and King each shall, and shall cause
their respective Subsidiaries and shall use its reasonable best efforts to
cause their respective Representatives to, immediately cease and cause to be
terminated any existing activities, discussions or negotiations with any
Person conducted heretofore with respect to any Acquisition Proposal, or
proposal that would reasonably be expected to lead to an Acquisition Proposal.
Crown and King, as applicable, shall promptly deliver a written notice to each
such Person providing only that each of Crown and King, as applicable,
is ending all discussions and negotiations with such Person with respect to
any Acquisition Proposal, or proposal or transaction that would reasonably be
expected to lead to an Acquisition Proposal, which notice shall also request
the prompt return or destruction of all confidential information concerning
Crown and any of its Subsidiaries or King and any of its Subsidiaries, as
applicable, heretofore furnished to such Person by or on behalf of Crown or
King, as applicable, or any of their respective Subsidiaries, as applicable.
Crown and King, as applicable, will promptly terminate all physical and
electronic data access previously granted to such Persons.

of all comments from the SEC and of any request by the SEC for any amendment

respect to the Registration Statement or Proxy/Prospectus. Each of King and
Crown shall advise the other, promptly after receipt of notice thereof, of the
time of effectiveness of the Registration Statement, the issuance of any stop
order relating thereto or the suspension of the qualification of shares of
King Common Stock for offering or sale in any jurisdiction, and each of King

(c) Each of Crown and King agrees, as to itself and its Subsidiaries, that
none of the information supplied or to be supplied by it or its Subsidiaries
for inclusion or incorporation by reference in (i) the Registration Statement
will, at the time the Registration Statement becomes effective under the
Securities Act, contain any untrue statement of a material fact or omit to
state any material fact required to be stated therein or necessary to make the

 thereunder. If, at any time prior to the Effective Time, either Party
obtains knowledge of any information pertaining to it or previously provided
by it for inclusion in the Registration Statement or the Proxy/Prospectus
that would require any amendment or supplement to the Registration Statement
or the Proxy/Prospectus so that any of such documents would not include any
untrue statement of a material fact or omit to state any material fact
necessary in order to make the statements therein, in the light of the
circumstances under which they were made, not misleading, such Party shall
promptly advise the other Party and the Parties shall cooperate in the prompt
filing with the SEC of any necessary amendment or supplement to the
Proxy/Prospectus and the Registration Statement and, as required by applicable
Law, in disseminating the information contained in such amendment or
supplement to the Crown stockholders and the King stockholders.

(d) Each of Crown and King will provide their respective legal counsel with

from the SEC with respect thereto, and such other documents related to the
Crown Stockholders Meeting, the King Stockholders Meeting or the issuance of
the shares of King Common Stock in respect of the Merger all comments
reasonably and promptly proposed by the other Party or its legal counsel and
each Party agrees that all information relating to King and its Subsidiaries
included in the Proxy/Prospectus or the Registration Statement shall be in
form and content satisfactory to King, acting reasonably, and all information
relating to Crown and its Subsidiaries included in the Proxy/Prospectus or the

extent required by Law, in accordance with _Section_ __ _ 7.4(c)_, or if, as

(as set forth in the Proxy/Prospectus), there are insufficient shares of
Crown Common Stock represented (either in person or by proxy) and voting to
adopt this Agreement or to constitute a quorum necessary to conduct the

best efforts to solicit from the stockholders of Crown proxies in favor of the
proposal to adopt this Agreement and to secure the Requisite Crown Vote (it
being understood that the foregoing shall not require the Crown Board to
recommend in favor of the adoption of this Agreement, if a Change 

 



43

    

 of Recommendation has been effected in accordance with _Section_ __ _
7.2(e)(ii)_ or _Section_ __ _ 7.2(e)(iii)_). Unless this Agreement has been
terminated in accordance with its terms, Crowns obligation to call, give

to effect a Change of Recommendation in accordance with _Section_ __ _
7.2(e)(ii)_ or _Section_ __ _ 7.2(e)(iii)_, use reasonable best efforts to
solicit from the stockholders of King proxies in favor of the Share
Issuance and to secure the Requisite King Vote (it being understood that the
foregoing shall not require the King Board to recommend in favor of the Share
Issuance, if a Change of Recommendation has been effected in accordance with 
_Section_ __ _ 7.2(e)(ii)_ or _Section_ __ _ 7.2(e)(iii)_). Unless this
Agreement has been terminated in accordance with its terms, Kings obligation
to call, give notice of, convene and hold the King Stockholders Meeting in
accordance with this _Section_ __ _ 7.4(b)_ shall not be limited or otherwise
affected by the making, commencement, disclosure, announcement or submission
of any Acquisition Proposal or Superior Proposal, or by any Change of
Recommendation.

(c) Crown and King shall cooperate and use their reasonable best efforts
to schedule and convene the Crown Stockholders Meeting and the King
Stockholders Meeting on the same date. Crown and King each agrees (i) to
provide the other reasonably detailed periodic updates concerning proxy

Business Days prior to the date the Crown Stockholders Meeting or the King
Stockholders Meeting, as applicable, is scheduled, (A) Crown or King, as
applicable, has not received proxies representing the Requisite Crown Vote or
the Requisite King Vote, as applicable, whether or not a quorum is present or

and refraining from taking any action that would reasonably be expected to

(b) Crown and King shall jointly develop and consult and cooperate in all
respects with one another, and consider in good faith the views of one
another, in connection with the form and content of any analyses, appearances,
presentations, memoranda, briefs, arguments, opinions and proposals made with,

with the Transactions (including the Proxy/Prospectus and the Registration
Statement). Neither Crown nor King shall permit any of its officers or other
Representatives to participate in any substantive meeting, telephone call
or conference with any Governmental Entity in respect of any Filing,
investigation or otherwise relating to the Transactions unless, to the extent
reasonably practicable, it consults with the other Party in advance and, to
the extent permitted by such Governmental Entity, gives the other Party the

reasonable best efforts to furnish to each other all information required for
any Filing, other than confidential or proprietary information not directly
related to the Transactions, and to give the other Party reasonable prior
notice of any such Filing and, to the extent practicable, keep the other Party

Governmental Entity in connection with the Transactions and the material
communications between such Party and such Governmental Entity, and, to the

advance, and consider in good faith the views of the other in connection with
any such Filing or communication.

 



45

    

 Each of the Parties shall promptly furnish the other with copies of all
correspondence, Filings (except for the Parties initial HSR Act notification
filings) and material communications between them and their Representatives,
on one hand, and any such Governmental Entity or its respective staff on the
other hand, with respect to the Transactions in order for such other Party to
meaningfully consult and participate in accordance with this _Section_ __ _
7.5_, _provided_ _that_ materials furnished pursuant to this _Section_ __ _
7.5_ may be redacted as necessary to address reasonable attorney-client or
other privilege or confidentiality concerns. Subject to applicable Law, each
of Crown and King and their respective Subsidiaries shall not agree to any
actions, restrictions or conditions with respect to obtaining any Consent in
connection with the Transactions, and neither Party shall directly or
indirectly agree to extend any applicable waiting period (including under the
HSR Act) or enter into any agreement with a Governmental Entity related to
this Agreement or the Transactions, in each case, without the prior written
consent of the other Party. In exercising the foregoing rights, each of Crown
and King shall act reasonably and as promptly as reasonably practicable.

 

(c) Subject to _Section_ __ _ 7.1(b)_ of such Partys Disclosure Letter,
neither King nor Crown shall, and each of them shall cause their respective
Subsidiaries not to, take any action, including acquiring any asset, property,
business or Person (by way of merger, consolidation, share exchange,
investment, other business combination, asset, stock or equity purchase, or
otherwise), in each case, that could reasonably be expected to materially
impair, adversely affect or materially delay obtaining any Consent or making
any Filing contemplated by this _Section_ __ _ 7.5_ or the timely receipt
thereof.

(d) Without limiting the generality of the undertakings pursuant to this 
_Section_ __ _ 7.5_, but on the terms and subject to the conditions set forth
in this Agreement, including _Section_ __ _ 7.5(e)_, each of Crown and King
agree to take or cause to be taken the following actions: 

(i) subject to applicable Law, the prompt provision to each and every
federal, state, local or foreign court or Governmental Entity with
jurisdiction over enforcement of any applicable Antitrust Law (each, a "
_Governmental Antitrust Entity_ ") of non-privileged information and documents
requested by any Governmental Antitrust Entity or that are necessary, proper
or advisable to permit consummation of the Transactions;

 

(ii) the prompt use of its reasonable best efforts to take all reasonably
necessary, proper or advisable steps to (A) avoid the entry of, and (B)
resist, vacate, modify, reverse, suspend, prevent, eliminate or remove any
actual, anticipated or threatened temporary, preliminary or permanent
injunction or other order, decree, decision, determination or judgment
entered or issued, or that becomes reasonably foreseeable to be entered or
issued, in any Proceeding or inquiry of any kind, in the case of each of the
foregoing clauses (A) and (B), that would reasonably be expected to
delay, restrain, prevent, enjoin or otherwise prohibit or make unlawful the
consummation of the Transactions, including (I) the defense through litigation
(excluding any appeals) on the merits of any claim asserted in any court,
agency or other Proceeding by any person or entity (including any
Governmental Antitrust Entity) seeking to delay, restrain, prevent, enjoin or
otherwise prohibit consummation of the Transactions and (II) (x) proposing,
negotiating, committing to and agreeing to sell, lease, license, divest or
otherwise dispose of, or hold separate pending such disposition, (y) agreeing
to restrictions or actions that after the Effective Time would limit Kings or
its Subsidiaries freedom of action or operations

 



46

    

 with respect to, or its ability to retain, one or more of its or its
Subsidiaries businesses, product lines or assets or (z) agreeing to enter
into, modify or terminate existing contractual relationships, contractual
rights or contractual obligations, and promptly effecting the sale, lease,
license, divestiture, disposal and holding separate of, assets, operations,
rights, product lines, licenses, businesses or interests therein of Crown or
King or either of their respective Subsidiaries (and the entry into agreements
with, and submission to orders of, the relevant Governmental Antitrust Entity
giving effect thereto or to such restrictions or actions) (such sale, lease,
license, defense through litigation, divestiture, disposal and holding
separate or other action described in clauses (I) or (II), a " _Regulatory
Remedy_ ") if such Regulatory Remedy should be reasonably necessary, proper
or advisable so as to permit the consummation of the Transactions on a
schedule as close as possible to that contemplated herein. Nothing in this
_Section_ __ _ 7.5(d)_ shall require either King or Crown to effectuate
or agree to effectuate any Regulatory Remedy unless such Regulatory Remedy is
conditioned upon the Closing.

 

(e) Notwithstanding anything in this _Section_ __ _ 7.5_ to the contrary,
neither this  _Section_ __ _ 7.5_ nor the "reasonable best efforts" standard
herein shall require, or be construed to require, Crown or King or any of
their respective Subsidiaries or other Affiliates to (i) waive any of
the conditions set forth in _Article VIII_ as they apply to such Party, (ii)
take, effect or agree to any Regulatory Remedy unless such Regulatory Remedy
is conditioned upon the occurrence of the Closing or is effective on or after
the Closing or (iii) take, effect or agree to any Regulatory Remedy that
individually or in the aggregate with any other Regulatory Remedy to be taken,
effected or agreed to, would reasonably be expected to have a material adverse
effect on the business, operations, financial condition or results of
operations of Crown and its Subsidiaries, taken as a whole, or King and its
Subsidiaries, taken as a whole, in each case, from and after the Effective
Time (a " _Burdensome Effect_ "), it being understood that for purposes of
clause (iii) any proceeds received, or expected to be received, from effecting
a Regulatory Remedy shall not be taken into consideration in making such
determination.

 

(f) For the avoidance of doubt, Crown and King shall use reasonable best
efforts to cooperate with each other and work in good faith in formulating
any Regulatory Remedy.

7.6 _Status Notifications_. Subject to applicable Law and except as
otherwise required by any Governmental Entity, Crown and King each shall keep

47

    

 with, the King Credit Facility to join or otherwise add Crown and its
Subsidiaries as loan parties to the King Credit Facility, in each case
effective simultaneously or substantially contemporaneously with the
consummation of the Transactions; and (ii) the Parties hereto shall cooperate
in good faith to mutually determine and use reasonable best efforts to

_ 7.8_, Crown and King each shall (and shall cause its Subsidiaries to),
upon request by the other, use reasonable best efforts to furnish the other
with all information concerning itself, its Subsidiaries, directors, officers
and stockholders and such other matters as may be reasonably necessary or
advisable in connection with the preparation of the Proxy/Prospectus, the

made by or on behalf of King, Crown or any of their respective Subsidiaries
to any third party or any Governmental Entity in connection with the
Transactions, and shall (and shall cause its Subsidiaries to), upon giving of
reasonable notice by the other Party, use reasonable best efforts to afford
the other Partys officers and other authorized Representatives reasonable
access, during normal business hours following reasonable advance notice

Partys independent accountants upon receipt of any required consents from
such accountants and subject to the execution of customary access letters), as
well as properties, offices and other facilities, and, during such period,
each shall (and shall cause its Subsidiaries to) use reasonable best efforts
to furnish promptly to the other all information concerning its business,
properties and personnel as may reasonably be requested, including in

behalf of King, Crown or any of their respective Subsidiaries to any third
party or any Governmental Entity in connection with the Transactions.

(b) The foregoing provisions of this  _Section_ __ _ 7.8_ shall not
require and shall not be construed to require either Crown or King to permit
any access to any of its Service Providers, agents, Contracts, books or
records, or its properties, offices or other facilities, or to permit any
inspection, review, sampling or audit, or to disclose or otherwise make
available any information that in the reasonable judgment of Crown or King, as
applicable, would (i) unreasonably interfere with such Partys or its
Subsidiaries business operations, (ii) result in the disclosure of any trade
secrets of any third parties, competitively sensitive information,

 



48

    

 information concerning the valuation of Crown, King or any of their

King, as applicable, objects to any request submitted pursuant to and in
accordance with this _Section_ __ _ 7.8_ and withholds information on the
basis of the foregoing clauses (ii) through (v), Crown or King,
as applicable, shall inform the other Party as to the general nature of what
is being withheld and shall use reasonable best efforts to make appropriate
substitute arrangements to permit reasonable disclosure that does not suffer
from any of the foregoing impediments. Each of Crown and King, as it deems
advisable and necessary, may reasonably designate competitively sensitive
material provided to the other as "Outside Counsel Only Material" or with
similar restrictions. Such materials and the information contained therein
shall be given only to the outside legal counsel of the recipient, or
otherwise as the restriction indicates, and be subject to any additional
confidentiality or joint defense agreement between the Parties. All requests
for information made pursuant to this _Section_ __ _ 7.8_ shall be directed
to the Person designated by Crown or King, as applicable. All information
exchanged or made available shall be governed by the terms of the
Confidentiality Agreement.

(c) To the extent that any of the information or material furnished
pursuant to this _Section_ __ _ 7.8_ or otherwise in accordance with the
terms of this Agreement may include material subject to the attorney-client
privilege, work product doctrine or any other applicable privilege, including
those concerning pending or threatened Proceedings, the Parties understand
and agree that they have a commonality of interest with respect to such
matters and it is their desire, intention and mutual understanding that the
sharing of such material is not intended to, and shall not, waive or diminish
in any way the confidentiality of such material or its continued protection
under the attorney-client privilege, work product doctrine or other applicable
privilege. All such information that is entitled to protection under the
attorney-client privilege, work product doctrine or other applicable privilege

or any listing agreement with any national securities exchange may be issued
prior to such consultation if the Party making the release or statement has
used its reasonable best efforts to consult with the other Party on a timely
basis and (b) each Party may issue public announcements or make other public
disclosures regarding this Agreement or the Transactions that consist solely
of information previously disclosed in press releases or public statements

of this  _Section_ __ _ 7.10_ shall not apply to (x) any disclosure of

7.11 _Employee Benefits_.

 

(a) From and after the Effective Time, the King Benefit Plans and the Crown
Benefit Plans in effect as of the Effective Time shall remain in effect with
respect to current and former Service Providers of King or Crown and their
Subsidiaries, respectively, covered by such plans at the Effective Time, until
such time as King, with the input of the post-Closing integration team and
a third party independent employee benefits consultant, shall otherwise
determine, subject to applicable Laws and the terms of such plans, and taking
into account the best features of each of the Crown Benefit Plans and King
Benefit Plans such that the employees will not be detrimentally impacted, as
determined on an aggregate basis. During the period from and after the
Effective Time in which a Crown Benefit Plan listed on Section 5.9(a) of the
Crown Disclosure Letter is maintained at Crown or at any Subsidiary of King,
King shall honor and perform, or cause Crown (or such Subsidiary of King) to
honor and perform such Crown Benefit Plans in accordance with its terms as in
effect from time to time. Without limiting the foregoing, nothing herein
shall prohibit any amendment, modification or termination of any King Benefit
Plan or Crown Benefit Plan from and after the Effective Time to the extent
allowed under the terms of any such plans, including but not limited to any
such action that may be (i) required by applicable Laws (including any
applicable qualification requirements of Sections 401(a) of the Code and as
necessary to avoid the imposition of taxes under Section 409A of the Code);
(ii) necessary as a technical matter to reflect the Transactions contemplated
hereby, or (iii) required for King to provide for or permit investment in its
securities.

 

(b) For at least one (1) year following the Effective Time, King shall
cause (i) each Service Provider of Crown and its Subsidiaries at the
Effective Time who continues to remain employed with King or its Subsidiaries
following the Effective Time and (ii) each Service Provider of King and its
Subsidiaries at the Effective Time who continues to remain

 



50

    

 employed with King or its Subsidiaries following the Effective Time
(collectively, the " _Continuing Employees_ ") with compensation and benefits
that are comparable to the compensation and benefits provided to each such
Continuing Employee prior to the Effective Time. With respect to any Benefit
Plans in which any Continuing Employee first becomes eligible to participate
on or after the Effective Time and in which such Continuing Employees did not
participate prior to the Effective Time (the " _New Plans_ "), (i) each
Continuing Employee shall be immediately eligible to participate, without any
waiting time, in any and all New Plans to the extent coverage under such New
Plan replaces coverage under a comparable Benefit Plan in which such
Continuing Employee participated immediately before the replacement, (ii) for
purposes of each New Plan providing medical, dental, pharmaceutical and/or
vision benefits to any Continuing Employee, King shall cause all pre-existing
condition exclusions and actively-at-work requirements of such New Plan to be
waived for such employee and his or her covered dependents except to the
extent such pre-existing conditions and actively-at-work requirements would
apply under the analogous Benefit Plan, and King shall cause any eligible
expenses incurred by such employee and his or her covered dependents under a
Benefit Plan during the portion of the plan year prior to the Effective Time
to be taken into account under such New Plan for purposes of satisfying
all deductible, co-insurance, co-payment and maximum out-of-pocket
requirements applicable to such employee and his or her covered dependents
for the applicable plan year as if such amounts had been paid in accordance
with such New Plan, and (iii) recognize all service of the Continuing
Employees with King and Crown and their respective affiliates and
predecessors, for purposes of eligibility to participate, vesting credit,
entitlement to benefits and levels of benefits in any New Plan in which such
Continuing Employees may be eligible to participate after the Effective Time,
to the extent such service is taken into account under the applicable New
Plan, except where such credit would result in a duplication of benefits.

 

(c) King and Crown expressly agree that the Transactions contemplated by
this Agreement shall constitute a "change in control" or "change of control"
for purposes of (i) all King Benefit Plans, policies, programs or agreements
(including but not limited to employment agreements and award agreements under
the King Stock Plan that includes the term "change in control" or "change of
control", as applicable); and (ii) all Crown Benefit Plans, policies programs
or agreements (including, but not limited to employment agreements and award

Section 1313 of the Code.

 

(b) Each of King and Crown shall use its reasonable best efforts and will

7.14 _Indemnification; Directors_ __ _and Officers_ __ _Insurance_.

 

(a) From and after the Effective Time, King shall indemnify and hold
harmless to the fullest extent as such individuals would be indemnified as of
the date of this Agreement under applicable Law, Crowns Organizational
Documents and any indemnification agreements in effect as of the date of this
Agreement, each present and former (determined as of the Effective Time)
director and officer of Crown or any of its Subsidiaries or any Person who
prior to or at the Effective Time served at the request of Crown or any of its
Subsidiaries as a director or officer of another Person in which Crown or any
of its Subsidiaries has an equity investment, in each case, when acting in
such capacity (the " _Indemnified Parties_ "), against any costs or expenses
(including reasonable attorneys fees, costs and expenses),
judgments, inquiries, fines, losses, claims, damages or liabilities incurred
in connection with, arising out of or otherwise related to any Proceeding, in
connection with, arising out of or otherwise related to matters existing 

 



53

    

 or occurring at or prior to the Effective Time, whether asserted or claimed
prior to, at or after the Effective Time, including in connection with (i)
this Agreement or the Transactions, and (ii) actions to enforce this
provision or any other indemnification or advancement right of any Indemnified
Party, and King shall also advance expenses as incurred to the fullest extent
that such individual would have been entitled to under applicable Law,
Crowns Organizational Documents and any indemnification agreements in effect
as of the date of this Agreement; _provided_ _that_ any Person to whom
expenses are advanced provides an undertaking to repay such advances if it is
ultimately determined by final adjudication that such Person is not entitled
to indemnification.

 

(b) Prior to the Effective Time, Crown shall and, if Crown is unable to,
King shall, as of the Effective Time, obtain and fully pay the premium for
"tail" insurance policies for the extension of (i) the directors and
officers liability coverage of Crowns existing directors and officers
insurance policies, and (ii) Crowns existing fiduciary liability insurance
policies, in each case for a claims reporting or discovery period of six (6)
years from and after the Effective Time (the " _Tail Period_ ") from one or
more insurance carriers with the same or better credit rating as Crowns
insurance carrier as of the date of this Agreement with respect to directors
and officers liability insurance and fiduciary liability insurance
(collectively, " _D andO Insurance_") with terms, conditions, retentions and
limits of liability that are at least as favorable to the insureds as Crowns
existing policies with respect to matters existing or occurring at or prior to
the Effective Time (including in connection with this Agreement or the
Transactions). If Crown and King for any reason fail to obtain such "tail"
insurance policies as of the Effective Time, King shall continue to maintain
in effect for the Tail Period the DandO Insurance in place as of the date of
this Agreement with terms, conditions, retentions and limits of liability that
are at least as favorable to the insureds as provided in Crowns existing
policies as of the date of this Agreement, or King shall purchase comparable
DandO Insurance for the Tail Period with terms, conditions, retentions and
limits of liability that are at least as favorable as provided in Crowns
existing policies as of the date of this Agreement; _provided_ , _that_ in no
event shall the aggregate cost of the DandO Insurance exceed during the Tail
Period 300% of the current aggregate annual premium paid by Crown for such
purpose; and _provided_ , _further_ , that if the cost of such insurance
coverage exceeds such amount, King shall obtain a policy with the greatest
amount of DandO Insurance available for a cost not exceeding such amount.

 

(c) Any Indemnified Party wishing to claim indemnification under this
_Section_ __ _ 7.14_, upon learning of any such Proceeding, shall promptly
notify King thereof in writing, but the failure to so notify shall not relieve
King of any liability it may have to such Indemnified Party except to the
extent such failure materially prejudices the indemnifying party. In the
event of any Proceeding: (i) King shall have the right to assume the defense
thereof (it being understood that by electing to assume the defense thereof,
King will not be deemed to have waived any right to object to the Indemnified
Partys entitlement to indemnification hereunder with respect thereto or
assumed any liability with respect thereto), except that if King elects not to
assume such defense or legal counsel or the Indemnified Party advises
that there are issues which raise conflicts of interest between King and the
Indemnified Party, the Indemnified Party may retain legal counsel satisfactory
to them, and King shall pay all reasonable and documented fees, costs and
expenses of such legal counsel for the Indemnified Party promptly as
statements therefor are received; _provided_ , _however_ , that King shall be
obligated pursuant to this _Section_ __ _ 7.14(c)_ to pay for only one firm
of legal counsel for all Indemnified Parties in any jurisdiction unless the
use of one legal counsel for such Indemnified Parties would present such legal
counsel with a conflict of interest

 



54

    

 ( _provided_ , _that_ the fewest number of legal counsels necessary to avoid
conflicts of interest shall be used); (ii) the Indemnified Parties shall
cooperate in the defense of any such matter if King elects to assume such
defense, and King shall cooperate in the defense of any such matter if King
elects not to assume such defense; (iii) the Indemnified Parties shall not be
liable for any settlement effected without their prior written consent if
King elects to assume such defense and King shall not be liable for any
settlement effected without its prior written consent if King elects not to
assume such defense; (iv) King shall not have any obligation hereunder to any
Indemnified Party if and when a court of competent jurisdiction shall
ultimately determine, and such determination shall have become final, that the
indemnified action of such Indemnified Party in the manner contemplated hereby
is prohibited by applicable Law; and (v) all rights to indemnification in
respect of any such Proceedings shall continue until final disposition of all
such Proceedings.

 

(d) During the Tail Period, all rights to indemnification and exculpation
from liabilities for acts or omissions occurring at or prior to the Effective
Time and rights to advancement of expenses relating thereto now existing in
favor of any Indemnified Party as provided in the Organizational Documents of
Crown and its Subsidiaries or any indemnification agreement between such
Indemnified Party and Crown or any of its Subsidiaries, in each case, as in
effect on the date of this Agreement, shall survive the Transactions unchanged
and shall not be amended, restated, repealed or otherwise modified in any
manner that would adversely affect any right thereunder of any such
Indemnified Party.

(e) If King or any of their respective successors or assigns (i) shall
consolidate with or merge into any other Person and shall not be the
continuing or surviving Person of such consolidation or merger or (ii) shall
transfer all or substantially all of its properties and assets to any Person,
then, and in each such case, proper provisions shall be made so that the
successors and assigns of King shall assume all of the obligations set forth
in this _Section_ __ _ 7.14_.

 

(f) The rights of the Indemnified Parties under this _Section_ __ _ 7.14_
shall survive consummation of the Merger and are in addition to any rights
such Indemnified Parties may have under the Organizational Documents of Crown
or any of its Subsidiaries, or under any indemnification agreements or other
applicable Contracts of Crown or Laws.

 

(g) This _Section_ __ _ 7.14_ is intended to be for the benefit of, and
from and after the Effective Time shall be enforceable by, each of the
Indemnified Parties, who shall be third-party beneficiaries of this _Section_
__ _ 7.14_.

 

7.15 _Takeover Statutes_. If any "fair price", "moratorium", "control
share acquisition" or other similar anti-takeover statute or regulation
(each, a " _Takeover Statute_ ") is or may become applicable to the
Transactions, each of Crown and King and the King Board and Crown Board,
respectively, shall grant such approvals and take such actions as are
necessary and legally permissible so that the Transactions may be consummated
as promptly as practicable on the terms contemplated by this Agreement and
otherwise act to eliminate or minimize the effects of such statute or
regulation on the Transactions.

7.16 _Section 16 Matters_. Crown and King, and the Crown Board and the
King Board (or duly formed committees thereof consisting of non-employee
directors (as such term is defined for the purposes of Rule 16b-3 promulgated
under the Exchange Act)), shall, prior to the

 



55

    

 Effective Time, take all such actions as are reasonably necessary or
appropriate to cause the Transactions and any other dispositions of equity
securities of Crown or King (including derivative securities) or acquisitions
of shares of King Common Stock (including derivative securities) in connection
with the Transactions by any individual who is subject to the reporting
requirements of Section 16(a) of the Exchange Act with respect to Crown or
King or will become subject to such reporting requirements with respect to
King, to be exempt under Rule 16b-3 promulgated under the Exchange Act, to the
extent permitted by applicable Laws.

 

7.17 _Stockholder Litigation_. Each of Crown and King shall promptly
advise the other Party of any litigation commenced after the date of this
Agreement against such Party or any of its directors (in their capacity as
such) by any stockholders of such Party (on their own behalf or on behalf of
such Party) relating to this Agreement or the Transactions, and shall keep
the other Party reasonably informed regarding any such litigation. Each of
Crown and King shall give the other Party the opportunity to participate in
the defense or settlement of any such stockholder litigation, and no such
settlement shall be agreed to without the other Partys prior written consent
(which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed).

 

7.18 _King Sub Stockholder Consent_. King, in its capacity as the sole
stockholder of King Sub, will immediately following the execution of this
Agreement, execute and deliver to King Sub and Crown a written consent

Directors pursuant to this _Section_ __ _ 2.01_, the Company shall take all

Section 2.02 _Investor Holdco Sell-Downs; Distributions of Investor
Holdco Company Shares_.

(a) In the event Investor Holdco proposes to effect a private block sale
or resale or to demand or participate in a registered offering of Company
Shares held by Investor Holdco (which such sale shall be proportionate among
members of Investor Holdco) (a " _Sell-Down_ "), Investor Holdco shall
promptly provide written notice to (i) each Holder and (ii) each equityholder
of Investor Holdco (collectively, the " _Other Selling Holders_ "), specifying
the number and percentage of Company Shares then held by Investor Holdco to be
sold in such Sell-Down, the number of Company Shares each Other Selling
Holder shall be obligated to sell in such Sell-Down (calculated on a pro rata
basis based on such Other Selling Holders beneficial ownership of Company
Shares) and all other material terms and conditions of the Sell-Down (the "
_Sell-Down Notice_ "). Each Other Selling Holder shall be obligated to
participate in such Sell-Down, unless such Other Selling Holder delivers a
written notice to Investor Holdco by the close of business on the date which
is three Business Days after the Sell-Down Notice is delivered to such Other
Selling Holder, which such notice shall include the number of Company Shares
such Other Selling Holder elects to exclude from such Sell-Down (the "
_Excluded Company Shares_ ", and such notifying Other Selling Holder, the "
_Non-Participating Holder_"). Any Other Selling Holder that does not deliver
such notice shall be obligated to participate in the Sell-Down with respect
to the number of Company Shares set forth in the Sell-Down Notice. If any
Other Selling Holder does not participate in such Sell-Down, Investor Holdco
shall, unless prohibited by applicable Law, promptly distribute the Excluded
Company Shares to the Non-Participating Holder, _provided_ , that (i) the Non-
Participating Holder complies with the provisions of _Section_ __ _ 2.02(b)_
and (ii) the Excluded Company Shares shall be subject to the same restrictions
on voting, transfer, market stand-off and lock-up provisions to which the
Company Shares of Investor Holdco to be sold in the Sell-Down are subject in
this Agreement and/or with respect to such Sell-Down (the " _Transaction
Transfer Restrictions_ "). Subject to compliance with applicable Law, the
Excluded Company Shares may be sold or otherwise disposed of by a Non-
Participating Holder so long as no Transaction Transfer Restriction period is
in effect. Investor Holdco shall provide further notice to such Non-
Participating Holder or its representatives of its

 



11

    

 intention to effect a Sell-Down not more than 30 calendar days prior to the
intended date for the completion of such Sell-Down, in which event the Non-
Participating Holder, after receiving notice of such Sell-Down, shall
(notwithstanding its earlier election in respect of Excluded Company Shares)
have the right to participate in such Sell-Down with Investor Holdco on the
same terms and conditions as Investor Holdco pro rata based on the Non-
Participating Holders beneficial ownership of Company Shares, and, if not
participating in such Sell-Down, shall not sell or otherwise dispose of the
Excluded Company Shares (or other Company Shares beneficially owned by such
holder) during such 30 calendar day period following delivery of such notice
and such longer transfer, market stand-off or lock up provision that Investor
Holdco shall become subject to in connection with such Sell-Down.

 

(b) Any Person who receives a distribution of Company Shares shall, to the
extent not already a party hereto, execute and deliver a joinder agreement,
in form and substance reasonably acceptable to the Company, agreeing to be
bound by the terms and conditions of this Agreement as if such Person were a
party hereto, whereupon such Person will be treated as a Holder for all
purposes of this Agreement, with the same benefits and obligations hereunder
as the distributing Holder with respect to the distributed Registrable
Securities.

 

ARTICLE III

REGISTRATION RIGHTS 

Section 3.01 _Demand Registration_.

 

(a) _Demand Rights_. At any time after the Effective Date, any Holders
that collectively and beneficially own at least (A) 20% of the total
Registrable Securities or (B) 10% of the total Registrable Securities,
provided that for the purposes of this clause (B), they beneficially own
Registrable Securities equivalent to at least 50% of the
Registrable Securities beneficially owned by them, as of the Effective Date
(each such Holder, a " _Demand Party_ "), may, subject to _Section_ __ _
3.11_, make a written request (a " _Demand Notice_ ") to the Company for
Registration of all or part of the Registrable Securities held by the Demand
Party (i) on Form S-1 (a " _Long-Form Registration_ ") or (ii) on Form S-3 (a
" _Short-Form Registration_ ") if the Company qualifies to use such short form
(any such requested Long-Form Registration or Short-Form Registration, a "
_Demand Registration_ "). Each Demand Notice shall specify the aggregate
amount of Registrable Securities held by the Demand Party to be registered and
the intended methods of disposition thereof, _provided_ that in the case of a
Demand Notice from Investor

 



12

    

 Holdco, the aggregate amount of Registrable Securities shall include
Registrable Securities from each member of Investor Holdco on a pro rata basis
based on each such members beneficial ownership of Registrable Securities,
unless such member otherwise directs Investor Holdco to include less than its
pro rata share of Registrable Securities in accordance with _Section_ __ _
2.02_. Subject to  _Section_ __ _ 3.11_, after delivery of such Demand
Notice, the Company (x) shall file promptly (and, in any event, within (i)
ninety (90) days in the case of a request for a Long-Form Registration or (ii)
thirty (30) days in the case of a request for a Short-Form Registration, in
each case, following delivery of such Demand Notice) with the SEC a
Registration Statement relating to such Demand Registration (a " _Demand
Registration Statement_ "), and (y) shall use its reasonable best efforts to
cause such Demand Registration Statement to promptly be declared effective
under (x) the Securities Act and (y) the "Blue Sky" laws of such
jurisdictions as any Participating Holder or any underwriter, if any,
reasonably requests. Notwithstanding any provisions contained herein,
including but not limited to _Section_ __ _ 3.02(b)_, the Company shall not
be obligated to maintain a registration statement pursuant to a Demand
Registration effective for more than (x) 360 days plus the length of any
period in which either a Demand Suspension or Shelf Suspension is in effect
instituted by the Company pursuant to  _Section_ __ _ 3.01_(d) or _Section_
__ _ 3.02(d)_, respectively, during such 360 day period or (y) such shorter
period when all of the Registrable Securities covered by such registration
statement have been sold pursuant thereto.

(b) _Demand Withdrawal_. The Demand Party may withdraw its Registrable
Securities from a Demand Registration at any time prior to the effectiveness
of the applicable Demand Registration Statement. Upon delivery of a notice by
the Demand Party to such effect, the Company shall cease all efforts to secure
effectiveness of the applicable Demand Registration Statement and promptly
notify each other Participating Holder of such withdrawal. Subject to Section
3.08(c), the Demand Holders shall reimburse the Company for all its reasonable
out-of-pocket Registration Expenses incurred in connection with the attempted
Demand Registration. If the Demand Holders reimburse the Company for its
reasonable out-of-pocket Registration Expenses incurred in connection with the
attempted Demand Registration, the attempted Demand Registration shall not
count as a Demand Registration for purposes of  _Section_ __ _ 3.11_.

 



13

    

(c) _Demand Company Notice_. Subject to  _Section_ __ _ 3.11_, promptly
upon delivery of any Demand Notice (but in no event more than five (5)
Business Days thereafter), the Company shall deliver a written notice (a "
_Demand Company Notice_ ") of any such Registration request to (i) all
Holders (other than the Demand Party) and the Company shall include in such
Demand Registration all such Registrable Securities of such Holders which the
Company has received written requests for inclusion therein within ten (10)
Business Days after the date that such Demand Company Notice has been
delivered except for such Registrable Securities that are withdrawn from such
Demand Registration by written notice of the Holder thereof at any time prior
to the effectiveness of the applicable Demand Registration Statement. All
requests made pursuant to this _Section_ __ _ 3.01(c)_ shall specify the
aggregate amount of Registrable Securities of such Holder to be registered. 

(d) _Delay in Filing; Suspension of Registration_. If the Company shall
furnish to the Participating Holders a certificate signed by the Chief
Executive Officer or equivalent senior executive officer of the Company
stating that the filing, effectiveness or continued use of a Demand
Registration Statement would require the Company to make an
Adverse Disclosure, then the Company may delay the filing (but not the
preparation of) or initial effectiveness of, or suspend use of, the Demand
Registration Statement (a " _Demand Suspension_ "); _provided_ , _however_ ,
that the Company, unless otherwise approved in writing by the Holders of a
majority of the Company Shares that elected to participate in the registration
in respect of any Demand Suspension, shall not be permitted to exercise
aggregate Demand Suspensions and Shelf Suspensions more than twice, or for
more than an aggregate of 90 days, in each case, during any 12-month period;
_provided_ , _further_ , that in the event of a Demand Suspension, such
Demand Suspension shall terminate at such earlier time as the Company would
no longer be required to make any Adverse Disclosure. Each Participating
Holder shall keep confidential the fact that a Demand Suspension is in effect,
the certificate referred to above and its contents unless and until otherwise
notified by the Company, except (A) for disclosure to such Participating
Holders employees, agents and professional advisers who reasonably need to
know such information for purposes of assisting the Participating Holder with
respect to its investment in the Company Shares and agree to keep it
confidential, (B) for disclosures to the extent required in order to comply
with reporting obligations to its limited partners or other direct or
indirect investors who have agreed to keep such information confidential, (C)
if and to the extent such matters are publicly disclosed by the Company or any
of its Subsidiaries or any other Person that, to the actual knowledge of
such Participating Holder, was not subject to an

 



14

    

 obligation or duty of confidentiality to the Company and its Subsidiaries
and (D) as required by law, rule or regulation. In the case of a Demand
Suspension, the Participating Holders agree to suspend use of the applicable
Prospectus and any Issuer Free Writing Prospectus in connection with any sale
or purchase of, or offer to sell or purchase, Registrable Securities, upon
delivery of the notice referred to above. The Company shall immediately
notify the Participating Holders upon the termination of any Demand
Suspension, amend or supplement the Prospectus and any Issuer Free Writing
Prospectus, if necessary, so it does not contain any untrue statement or
omission and furnish to the Participating Holders such numbers of copies of
the Prospectus and any Issuer Free Writing Prospectus as so amended or
supplemented as any Participating Holder may reasonably request. The Company
agrees, if necessary, to supplement or make amendments to the Demand
Registration Statement if required by the registration form used by the
Company for the applicable Registration or by the instructions applicable to
such registration form or by the Securities Act or the rules or
regulations promulgated thereunder, or as may reasonably be requested by the
Demand Party.

(e) _Underwritten Offering_. If the Demand Party so requests, an offering
of Registrable Securities pursuant to a Demand Registration shall be in the
form of an Underwritten Offering, and the Demand Party shall have the right to
select the managing underwriter or underwriters to administer the offering.
If the Demand Party intends to sell the Registrable Securities covered by its
demand by means of an Underwritten Offering, the Demand Party shall so advise
the Company as part of its Demand Notice, and the Company shall include such
information in the Demand Company Notice.

(f) _Priority of Securities Registered Pursuant to Demand Registrations_.
If the managing underwriter or underwriters of a proposed Underwritten
Offering of the Registrable Securities included in a Demand Registration
advise the Board of Directors in writing that, in its or their opinion,
the number of securities requested to be included in such Demand Registration
exceeds the number which can be sold in such offering without being likely to
have a significant adverse effect on the price, timing or distribution of the
securities offered or the market for the securities offered, the securities
to be included in such Demand Registration (i) _ first_, shall be allocated
pro rata among the Holders that have requested to participate in such Demand
Registration based on each Holders Pro Rata Percentage ( _provided_ that any
securities thereby allocated to a Holder that exceed such Holders request
shall be

 



15

    

 reallocated among the remaining requesting Holders in like manner), (ii)
_second_ , and only if all the securities referred to in clause (i) have been
included in such Registration, the number of securities that the Company
proposes to include in such Registration that, in the opinion of the managing
underwriter or underwriters, can be sold without having such adverse effect
and (iii) _ third_, and only if all of the securities referred to in clause
(ii) have been included in such Registration, any other securities eligible
for inclusion in such Registration that, in the opinion of the managing
underwriter or underwriters, can be sold without having such adverse effect.

Section 3.02 _Shelf Registration_.

 

(a) _Filing_. The Company shall use its reasonable best efforts to
continue to qualify for Registration on Form S-3 for secondary sales. If, at
any time, there is no Shelf Registration Statement on Form S-3 covering all of
the Registrable Securities and the Company is eligible to Register on Form
S-3 (the " _S-3 Eligibility Date_"), the Company shall promptly notify, in
writing, Investor Holdco, or if Investor Holdco is no longer a Holder of
Registrable Securities, then the Holders, of such eligibility and its
intention to file and maintain a Shelf Registration Statement on Form S-3
covering the Registrable Securities held by Investor Holdco, or if Investor
Holdco is no longer a Holder of Registrable Securities, then the Holders, (the
" _Eligibility Notice_ "). Promptly following receipt of such Eligibility
Notice (but in no event more than ten (10) days after receipt of such
Eligibility Notice), each of Investor Holdco, or if Investor Holdco is no
longer a Holder of Registrable Securities, then the Majority Holders (Investor
Holdco or the Majority Holders, as applicable, in such capacity, the "
_Initial S-3 Holder_"), shall deliver a written notice to the Company, which
notice shall specify the aggregate amount of Registrable Securities held by
the Initial S-3 Holder to be covered by such Shelf Registration Statement and
the intended methods of distribution thereof (the " _S-3 Shelf Notice_"). An
S-3 Shelf Notice delivered by Investor Holdco, or, if Investor Holdco is no
longer a Holder of Registrable Securities, then the Majority Holders shall
include, with respect to Registrable Securities to be registered on behalf of
the Sponsors, Registrable Securities pro rata from each Sponsor based on each
such Holders beneficial ownership of Registrable Securities, unless such
Holder otherwise directs the Demand Party to include less than its pro
rata share of Registrable Securities in accordance with _Section_ __ _
2.02_. Following delivery of the S-3 Shelf Notices, the Company (x) shall file
promptly (and, in any event, within the earlier of (i) thirty (30) days of
receipt of the S-3 Shelf Notices and (ii) forty (40) days after delivery of
the Eligibility Notice)

 



16

    

 with the SEC such Shelf Registration Statement (which shall be an automatic
Shelf Registration Statement if the Company qualifies at such time to file
such a Shelf Registration Statement) relating to the offer and sale of all
Registrable Securities requested for inclusion therein by the Initial S-3
Holder and, to the extent requested under _Section_ __ _ 3.02(c)_, the
other Holders from time to time in accordance with the methods of
distribution elected by such Holders (to the extent permitted in this
_Section_ __ _ 3.02_) and set forth in the Shelf Registration Statement and
(y) shall use its reasonable best efforts to cause such Shelf Registration
Statement to be promptly declared effective under the Securities Act
(including upon the filing thereof if the Company qualifies to file an
automatic Shelf Registration Statement);  _provided_ , _however_ , that if
the Initial S-3 Holder reasonably believes that the Company will become S-3
eligible and delivers a S-3 Shelf Notice prior to the S-3 Eligibility Date,
the Company shall not be obligated to file (but shall be obligated to prepare)
such Shelf Registration Statement on Form S-3.

(b) _Continued Effectiveness_. Subject to  _Section_ __ _ 3.01(a)_, the
Company shall use its reasonable best efforts to keep any Shelf Registration
Statement covering the Registrable Securities continuously effective under the
Securities Act in order to permit the Prospectus forming a part thereof to be
usable by Shelf Holders until the earliest of (i) the date as of which all
Registrable Securities have been sold pursuant to the Shelf Registration
Statement or another Registration Statement filed under the Securities Act
(but in no event prior to the applicable period referred to in Section 4(3) of
the Securities Act and Rule 174 thereunder), (ii) the date as of which each of
the Shelf Holders is permitted to sell its Registrable Securities without
Registration pursuant to Rule 144 without volume limitation or other
restrictions on transfer thereunder, (iii) such shorter period as Investor
Holdco, or, if Investor Holdco is no longer a Holder of Registrable
Securities, then Shelf Holders holding a majority of the Registrable
Securities subject to the Shelf Registration Statement, shall agree in writing
(such period of effectiveness, the " _Shelf Period_ "). Subject to _Section_
__ _ 3.02(d)_, the Company shall not be deemed to have used its reasonable
best efforts to keep the Shelf Registration Statement effective during the
Shelf Period if the Company voluntarily takes any action or omits to take any
action that would result in Shelf Holders not being able to offer and sell
any Registrable Securities pursuant to such Shelf Registration Statement
during the Shelf Period, unless such action or omission is (x) a Shelf
Suspension permitted pursuant to  _Section_ __ _ 3.02(d)_ or (y) required by
applicable law, rule or regulation.

 



17

    

(c) _Company Notices_. Promptly upon delivery of any S-3 Shelf Notice
pursuant to _Section_ __ _ 3.02(a)_ (each, a " _Shelf Notice_ ") (but in no
event more than five (5) Business Days thereafter), the Company shall deliver
a written notice of such Shelf Notice to the Holders (other than the Initial
S-3 Holder) and the Company shall include in such Shelf Registration all such
Registrable Securities of such other Holders which the Company has received a
written request for inclusion therein within five (5) Business Days after such
written notice is delivered to such other Holders (each such Holder delivering
such a request together with the Initial S-3 Holder, if applicable, a " _Shelf
Holder_ "); _provided_ , _that_ , except in connection with an Underwritten
Shelf Take-Down the Company shall not include in such Shelf
Registration Registrable Securities of any Holder in an amount in excess of
such Holders Pro Rata Percentage. If the Company is permitted by applicable
law, rule or regulation to add selling stockholders to a Shelf Registration
Statement without filing a post-effective amendment, a Holder may request the
inclusion of an amount of such Holders Registrable Securities not to exceed
such Holders Pro Rata Percentage in such Shelf Registration Statement at any
time or from time to time after the filing of a Shelf Registration Statement,
and the Company shall add such Registrable Securities to the Shelf
Registration Statement as promptly as reasonably practicable, and such Holder
shall be deemed a Shelf Holder.

 

(d) _Suspension of Registration_. If the Company shall furnish to the
Shelf Holders a certificate signed by the Chief Executive Officer or
equivalent senior executive officer of the Company stating that the continued
use of a Shelf Registration Statement covering the Registrable Securities
would require the Company to make an Adverse Disclosure, then the Company may
suspend use of the Shelf Registration Statement (a " _Shelf Suspension_ ");
_provided_ , _however_ , that the Company unless otherwise approved in writing
the Holders of a majority of the Company Shares that demanded the
registration, in respect of any Demand Suspension, shall not be permitted to
exercise aggregate Demand Suspensions and Shelf Suspensions more than twice,
or for more than an aggregate of 90 days, in each case, during any 12-month
period; _provided_ _further_ that in the event of a Shelf Suspension, such
Shelf Suspension shall terminate at such earlier time as the Company would no
longer be required to make any Adverse Disclosure. Each Shelf Holder shall
keep confidential the fact that a Shelf Suspension is in effect, the
certificate referred to above and its contents unless and until otherwise
notified by the Company, except (A) for disclosure to such Shelf Holders
employees, agents and professional advisers who

 



18

    

 reasonably need to know such information for purposes of assisting the
Holder with respect to its investment in the Company Shares and agree to keep
it confidential, (B) for disclosures to the extent required in order to
comply with reporting obligations to its limited partners or other direct or
indirect investors who have agreed to keep such information confidential, (C)
if and to the extent such matters are publicly disclosed by the Company or
any of its Subsidiaries or any other Person that, to the actual knowledge of
such Shelf Holder, was not subject to an obligation or duty of confidentiality
to the Company and its Subsidiaries and (D) as required by law, rule or
regulation. In the case of a Shelf Suspension, the Holders agree to suspend
use of the applicable Prospectus and any Issuer Free Writing Prospectus in
connection with any sale or purchase of, or offer to sell or purchase,
Registrable Securities, upon delivery of the notice referred to above. The
Company shall immediately notify the Shelf Holders upon the termination of any
Shelf Suspension, amend or supplement the Prospectus and any Issuer Free
Writing Prospectus, if necessary, so it does not contain any untrue statement
or omission and furnish to the Shelf Holders such numbers of copies of the
Prospectus and any Issuer Free Writing Prospectus as so amended or
supplemented as any Shelf Holder may reasonably request. The Company agrees,
if necessary, to supplement or make amendments to the Shelf Registration
Statement if required by the registration form used by the Company for the
applicable Registration or by the instructions applicable to such registration
form or by the Securities Act or the rules or regulations promulgated
thereunder, or as may reasonably be requested by the Initial S-3 Holder.

 

(e) _Shelf Take-Downs_.

 

(i) An offering or sale of Registrable Securities pursuant to a Shelf
Registration Statement (each, a " _Shelf Take-Down_ ") may be initiated by
Investor Holdco, or if Investor Holdco is no longer a Holder of Registrable
Securities, by any Shelf Holder (in such capacity, the " _Initiating Shelf
Take-Down Holder_ ") in respect of such Initiating Shelf Take-Down Holders
Registrable Securities included in such Shelf Registration Statement. Except
as set forth in _Section_ __ _ 3.02(e)(iii)_ with respect to Marketed
Underwritten Shelf Take-Downs, the Initiating Shelf Take-Down Holder shall
not be required to permit the offer and sale of Registrable Securities by
other Shelf Holders in connection with any such Shelf Take-Down initiated by
such Initiating Shelf Take-Down Holder.

 



19

    

(ii) Subject to _Section_ __ _ 3.11_, if the Holders of a majority of the
Registrable Securities included in the Shelf Registration Statement elect by
written request to the Company, a Shelf Take-Down shall be in the form of an
Underwritten Offering (an " _Underwritten Shelf Take-Down Notice_ ") and the
Company shall amend or supplement the Shelf Registration Statement for such
purpose as soon as practicable. Such Holders shall have the right to select
the managing underwriter or underwriters to administer such offering. The
provisions of _Section_ __ _ 3.01(f)_ shall apply to any Underwritten
Offering pursuant to this _Section_ __ _ 3.02(e)_.

 

(iii) If the plan of distribution set forth in any Underwritten Shelf Take-
Down Notice includes a customary "road show" (including an "electronic road
show") or other substantial marketing effort by the Company and the
underwriters over a period expected to exceed 48 hours (a " _Marketed
Underwritten Shelf Take-Down_ "), promptly upon delivery of such Underwritten
Shelf Take-Down Notice (but in no event more than three (3) Business Days
thereafter), the Company shall deliver a written notice (a " _Marketed
Underwritten Shelf Take-Down Notice_ ") of such Marketed Underwritten Shelf
Take-Down to all Shelf Holders (other than the Initiating Shelf Take-Down
Holder), and the Company shall include in such Marketed Underwritten Shelf
Take-Down all such Registrable Securities of such Shelf Holders that
are Registered on such Shelf Registration Statement for which the Company has
received written requests, which requests must specify the aggregate amount of
such Registrable Securities of such Holder to be offered and sold pursuant to
such Marketed Underwritten Shelf Take-Down, for inclusion therein within
three (3) Business Days after the date that such Marketed Underwritten Shelf
Take-Down Notice has been delivered.

 

(iv) For so long as no black-out period as described in and subject to
the terms of _Section_ __ _ 3.04_ with respect to a Marketed Underwritten
Offering is then in effect, a Shelf Holder may initiate a Shelf Take-Down with
respect to the Registrable Securities of such Shelf Holder so long as such
Shelf Take-Down is not in the form of an Underwritten Offering.

Section 3.03 _Piggyback Registration_.

 

(a) _Participation_. If the Company at any time proposes to file a
Registration Statement with respect to any offering of Company Shares for its
own account or for the account of any other Persons (other than (i) a
Registration under _Section_ __ _ 3.01_ or _Section_ __ _ 3.02_, it being
understood that this clause (i) does not limit the rights of Holders to make
written requests pursuant to _Section_ __ _ 3.01_ or _Section_ __ _ 3.02_ or
otherwise limit the applicability thereof, (ii) a Registration Statement
on Form S-4 or S-8 (or such other similar successor forms then in effect

 



20

    

 under the Securities Act), (iii) a registration of securities solely
relating to an offering and sale to employees, directors or consultants of the
Company or its Subsidiaries pursuant to any employee stock plan or other
employee benefit plan arrangement, (iv) a registration not otherwise covered
by clause (iii) above pursuant to which the Company is offering to exchange
its own securities for other securities or (v) a Registration Statement
relating solely to dividend reinvestment or similar plans) (a " _Company
Public Sale_ "), then, (A) as soon as practicable (but in no event less than
10 days prior to the proposed date of filing of such Registration Statement),
the Company shall give written notice of such proposed filing to Investor
Holdco and all Demand Parties and shall offer Investor Holdco and all Demand
Parties the opportunity to Register under such Registration Statement such
number of Registrable Securities as Investor Holdco and such Demand Parties
may request in writing ( _provided_ that the number of Registrable Securities
Registered by Investor Holdco pursuant to this  _Section_ __ _ 3.03(a)_
shall be pro rata among members of Investor Holdco based on the Registrable
Securities beneficially owned by each such member of Investor Holdco, unless
such member of Investor Holdco otherwise directs Investor Holdco to include
less than its pro rata share of Registrable Securities in accordance with
_Section_ __ _ 2.02_) delivered to the Company within ten (10) days of
delivery of such written notice by the Company, and (B) subject to _Section_
__ _ 3.03(c)_, as soon as practicable after the expiration of such 10-day
period (but in no event less than fifteen (15) days prior to the proposed date
of filing of such Registration Statement), the Company shall give written
notice of such proposed filing to the remaining Holders, and such notice shall
offer each such Holder the opportunity to Register under such Registration
Statement such number of Registrable Securities as such Holder may request in
writing within ten (10) days of delivery of such written notice by the
Company. Subject to _Section_ __ _ 3.03(b)_ and (c), the Company shall
include in such Registration Statement all such Registrable Securities that
are requested by Holders to be included therein in compliance with the
immediately foregoing sentence (a " _Piggyback Registration_ "); _provided_
that if at any time after giving written notice of its intention to Register
any equity securities and prior to the effective date of the Registration
Statement filed in connection with such Piggyback Registration, the Company
shall determine for any reason not to Register or to delay Registration of
the equity securities covered by such Piggyback Registration, the Company
shall give written notice of such determination to each Holder that had
requested to Register its, his or her Registrable Securities in such
Registration Statement and, thereupon, (1) in the case of a

 



21

    

 determination not to Register, shall be relieved of its obligation to
Register any Registrable Securities in connection with such Registration,
without prejudice, however, to the rights of a Demand Party, to request that
such Registration be effected as a Demand Registration under _Section_ __ _
3.01_, and (2) in the case of a determination to delay Registering, in the
absence of a request by a Demand Party, that such Registration be effected as
a Demand Registration under _Section_ __ _ 3.01_, shall be permitted to delay
Registering any Registrable Securities, for the same period as the delay in
Registering the other equity securities covered by such Piggyback
Registration. If the offering pursuant to such Registration Statement is to be
underwritten, the Company shall so advise the Holders as a part of the written
notice given pursuant this  _Section_ __ _ 3.03(a)_, and each Holder making
a request for a Piggyback Registration pursuant to this _Section_ __ _
3.03(a)_ must, and the Company shall make such arrangements with the managing
underwriter or underwriters so that each such Holder may, participate in such
Underwritten Offering, subject to the conditions of _Section_ __ _ 3.03(b)_
and _(c)_. If the offering pursuant to such Registration Statement is to be on
any other basis, the Company shall so advise the Holders as part of the
written notice given pursuant to this _Section_ __ _ 3.03(a)_, and each
Holder making a request for a Piggyback Registration pursuant to this 
_Section_ __ _ 3.03(a)_ must, and the Company shall make such arrangements so
that each such Holder may, participate in such offering on such basis, subject
to the conditions of _Section_ __ _ 3.03(b)_ and  _(c)_. Each Holder shall
be permitted to withdraw all or part of its Registrable Securities from a
Piggyback Registration at any time prior to the effectiveness of such
Registration Statement.

 

(b) _Priority of Piggyback Registration_. If the managing underwriter or
underwriters of any proposed Underwritten Offering of Registrable Securities
included in a Piggyback Registration informs the Company and the Holders that
have requested to participate in such Piggyback Registration in writing that,
in its or their opinion, the number of securities which such Holders and any
other Persons intend to include in such offering exceeds the number which can
be sold in such offering without being likely to have a significant adverse
effect on the price, timing or distribution of the securities offered or the
market for the securities offered, then the securities to be included in such
Registration shall be (i) _ first_, the number of Registrable Securities
that, in the opinion of such managing underwriter or underwriters, can be
sold without having such adverse effect in such Registration, which such
number shall be allocated pro rata among the Holders that have requested to
participate in such Registration based on each Holders 

 



22

    

 Pro Rata Percentage ( _provided_ that any securities thereby allocated to a
Holder that exceed such Holders request shall be reallocated among the
remaining requesting Holders in like manner) and (ii) _ second_, and only if
all of the Registrable Securities referred to in clause (i) have been included
in such Registration, any other securities eligible for inclusion in such
Registration that, in the opinion of the managing underwriter or
underwriters, can be sold without having such adverse effect in such
Registration.

 

(c) _Restrictions on Holders_. Notwithstanding any provisions contained
herein, prior to the distribution by Investor Holdco of all its Registrable
Securities held as of the date hereof to its members, Holders other than
Investor Holdco or a Demand Party may not request Piggyback Registration of
Registrable Securities with respect to any offering of Company Shares for the
Companys account unless Investor Holdco or a Demand Party requests such
Piggyback Registration with respect to such offering.

 

(d) _No Effect on Demand Registrations_. No Registration of Registrable
Securities effected pursuant to a request under this _Section_ __ _ 3.03_
shall be deemed to have been effected pursuant to _Section_ __ _ 3.01_ or
_Section_ __ _ 3.02_ or shall relieve the Company of its obligations under 
_Section_ __ _ 3.01_ or _Section_ __ _ 3.02_.

Section 3.04 _Black-out Periods_.

(a) _Black-out  Periods for Holders_. In the event of a Company Public

on Form S-4 or S-8 or any successor form to such Forms or as part of any
Registration of securities for offering and sale to employees, directors or

than a Holder) any rights to demand or participate in a Registration, the
Company shall, and shall cause its Subsidiaries to, provide that the
agreement with respect thereto shall include such Persons agreement to comply

such Marketed Underwritten Offering (and if a Participating Majority agrees to
such request), the Holders shall execute a separate agreement to the foregoing
effect. The Company may impose stop-transfer instructions with respect to the

fact or omits to state a material fact necessary to make the statements
therein (in the case of such Prospectus, any preliminary Prospectus or any
Issuer Free Writing Prospectus, in light of the circumstances under which
they were made) not misleading, when any Issuer Free Writing Prospectus

hold harmless, to the full extent permitted by law, each of the Holders, each

documents incorporated by reference therein), any Issuer Free Writing
Prospectus or amendment or supplement thereto, or any other disclosure
document produced by or on behalf of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries

Registrable Securities ( _provided_ , _that_ , in such instance the Company
shall not be so liable if it has undertaken its reasonable best efforts to so
register or qualify such Registrable Securities) or (v) any actions
or inactions or proceedings in respect of the foregoing whether or not such
indemnified party is a party thereto, and the Company will reimburse, as

38

    

 party to the extent that any such Loss arises out of or is based upon (A) an
untrue statement or alleged untrue statement or omission or alleged omission
made in any such Registration Statement or other document in reliance upon
and in conformity with written information furnished to the Company by such
indemnified party expressly for use in the preparation thereof or (B) an
untrue statement or omission in a preliminary Prospectus relating to
Registrable Securities, if a Prospectus (as then amended or supplemented) that
would have cured the defect was furnished to the indemnified party from whom
the Person asserting the claim giving rise to such Loss purchased Registrable
Securities at least five (5) days prior to the written confirmation of the
sale of the Registrable Securities to such Person and a copy of such
Prospectus (as amended and supplemented) was not sent or given by or on behalf
of such indemnified party to such Person at or prior to the written
confirmation of the sale of the Registrable Securities to such Person. This
indemnity shall be in addition to any liability the Company may otherwise
have. Such indemnity shall remain in full force and effect regardless of any
investigation made by or on behalf of such Holder or any indemnified party and
shall survive the transfer of such securities by such Holder. The Company
shall also indemnify underwriters, selling brokers, dealer managers and
similar securities industry professionals participating in the distribution,
their officers and directors and each Person who controls such Persons (within
the meaning of the Securities Act and the Exchange Act) to the same extent as

and/or the Family Members of such

 



39

    

 natural Person, from and against any Losses resulting from (i) any untrue
statement of a material fact in any Registration Statement under which such
Registrable Securities of such Participating Holder were Registered under the
Securities Act (including any final, preliminary or summary Prospectus
contained therein or any amendment or supplement thereto or any documents
incorporated by reference therein) or any Issuer Free Writing Prospectus or
amendment or supplement thereto, or (ii) any omission to state therein a
material fact required to be stated therein or necessary to make the
statements therein (in the case of a Prospectus, preliminary Prospectus
or Issuer Free Writing Prospectus, in light of the circumstances under which
they were made) not misleading, in each case to the extent, but only to the
extent, that such untrue statement (or alleged untrue statement) or omission
(or alleged omission) is contained in any information furnished in writing by
such Participating Holder to the Company specifically for inclusion in such
Registration Statement, Prospectus, offering circular, Issuer Free Writing
Prospectus or other document and has not been corrected in a subsequent
writing prior to or concurrently with the sale of the Registrable Securities
to the Person asserting the claim. In no event shall the liability of such
Participating Holder hereunder be greater in amount than the dollar amount of
the net proceeds received by such Participating Holder under the sale of
Registrable Securities giving rise to such indemnification obligation.

 

(c) _Conduct of Indemnification Proceedings_. Any Person entitled to
indemnification under this  _Section_ __ _ 3.09_ shall (i) give prompt
written notice to the indemnifying party of any claim with respect to which it
seeks indemnification ( _provided_ , _that_ , any delay or failure to so
notify the indemnifying party shall relieve the indemnifying party of its
obligations hereunder only to the extent, if at all, that it is actually and
materially prejudiced by reason of such delay or failure) and (ii) permit such
indemnifying party to assume the defense of such claim with counsel
reasonably satisfactory to the indemnified party; _provided_ , _that_ , any
Person entitled to indemnification hereunder shall have the right to select
and employ separate counsel and to participate in the defense of such claim,
but the fees and expenses of such counsel shall be at the expense of such
Person unless (A) the indemnifying party has agreed in writing to pay such
fees or expenses, (B) the indemnifying party shall have failed to assume the
defense of such claim within a reasonable time after delivery of notice of
such claim from the Person entitled to indemnification hereunder and employ
counsel reasonably satisfactory to such Person, (C) the indemnified party
has reasonably concluded (based upon advice of its counsel) that there may be

 



40

    

 legal defenses available to it or other indemnified parties that are
different from or in addition to those available to the indemnifying party, or
(D) in the reasonable judgment of any such Person (based upon advice of its
counsel) a conflict of interest may exist between such Person and the
indemnifying party with respect to such claims (in which case, if the Person
notifies the indemnifying party in writing that such Person elects to employ
separate counsel at the expense of the indemnifying party, the indemnifying
party shall not have the right to assume the defense of such claim on behalf
of such Person). If the indemnifying party assumes the defense, the
indemnifying party shall not have the right to settle such action, consent to
entry of any judgment or enter into any settlement, in each case without the
prior written consent of the indemnified party, unless the entry of such
judgment or settlement (i) includes as an unconditional term thereof the
giving by the claimant or plaintiff to such indemnified party of an
unconditional release from all liability in respect to such claim or
litigation and (ii) does not include a statement as to or an admission of
fault, culpability or a failure to act by or on behalf of such indemnified
party, and _provided_ , _that_ , any sums payable in connection with such
settlement are paid in full by the indemnifying party. If such defense is not
assumed by the indemnifying party, the indemnifying party will not be subject
to any liability for any settlement made without its prior written consent,
but such consent may not be unreasonably withheld. It is understood that the
indemnifying party or parties shall not, except as specifically set forth in
this _Section_ __ _ 3.09(c)_, in connection with any proceeding or related
proceedings in the same jurisdiction, be liable for the reasonable fees,
disbursements or other charges of more than one separate firm admitted to
practice in such jurisdiction at any one time unless (x) the employment of
more than one counsel has been authorized in writing by the indemnifying party
or parties, (y) an indemnified party has reasonably concluded (based on the
advice of counsel) that there may be legal defenses available to it that are
different from or in addition to those available to the other indemnified
parties, or (z) a conflict or potential conflict exists or may exist (based
upon advice of counsel to an indemnified party) between such indemnified party
and the other indemnified parties, in each of which cases the indemnifying
party shall be obligated to pay the reasonable fees and expenses of
such additional counsel or counsels.

(d) _Contribution_. If for any reason the indemnification provided for
in paragraphs (a) and (b) of this _Section_ __ _ 3.09_ is unavailable to an
indemnified party or insufficient in respect of any Losses referred to
therein, then the indemnifying party shall contribute to the 

 



41

    

 amount paid or payable by the indemnified party as a result of such Loss in
such proportion as is appropriate to reflect the relative fault of the
indemnifying party on the one hand and the indemnified party or parties on
the other hand in connection with the acts, statements or omissions that
resulted in such losses, as well as any other relevant equitable
considerations. In connection with any Registration Statement filed with
the SEC by the Company, the relative fault of the indemnifying party on the
one hand and the indemnified party on the other hand shall be determined by
reference to, among other things, whether any untrue or alleged untrue
statement of a material fact or the omission or alleged omission to state a
material fact relates to information supplied by the indemnifying party or by
the indemnified party and the parties relative intent, knowledge, access to
information and opportunity to correct or prevent such statement or omission.
The parties hereto agree that it would not be just or equitable if
contribution pursuant to this _Section_ __ _ 3.09(d)_ were determined by pro
rata allocation or by any other method of allocation that does not take
account of the equitable considerations referred to in this _Section_ __ _
3.09(d)_. No Person guilty of fraudulent misrepresentation (within the meaning
of Section 11(f) of the Securities Act) shall be entitled to contribution
from any Person who was not guilty of such fraudulent misrepresentation. The
amount paid or payable by an indemnified party as a result of the Losses
referred to in _Section_ __ _ 3.09(a)_ and  _Section_ __ _ 3.09(b)_ shall
be deemed to include, subject to the limitations set forth above, any legal or
other expenses reasonably incurred by such indemnified party in connection
with investigating or defending any such action or claim. Notwithstanding the
provisions of this _Section_ __ _ 3.09(d)_, in connection with any
Registration Statement filed by the Company, a Participating Holder shall not
be required to contribute any amount in excess of the dollar amount of the
net proceeds received by such Holder under the sale of Registrable Securities
giving rise to such contribution obligation less any amount paid by such
Holders pursuant to _Section_ __ _ 3.09(b)_. If indemnification is available
under this _Section_ __ _ 3.09_, the indemnifying parties shall indemnify
each indemnified party to the full extent provided in _Section_ __ _ 3.09(a)_
and  _Section_ __ _ 3.09(b)_ hereof without regard to the provisions of this
_Section_ __ _ 3.09(d)_.

 

(e) _No Exclusivity_. The remedies provided for in this _Section_ __ _
3.09_ are not exclusive and shall not limit any rights or remedies which may
be available to any indemnified party at law or in equity or pursuant to any
other agreement.

 



42

    

(f) _Survival_. The indemnities provided in this  _Section_ __ _ 3.09_
shall survive the transfer of any Registrable Securities by such Holder.

 

Section 3.10 _Rules 144 and 144A and Regulation S_. The Company covenants
that it will file the reports required to be filed by it under the Securities
Act and the Exchange Act and the rules and regulations adopted by the SEC
thereunder (or, if the Company is not required to file such reports, it will,
upon the reasonable request of any Holder, make publicly available such
necessary information for so long as necessary to permit sales pursuant to
Rules 144, 144A or Regulation S under the Securities Act), and it will take
such further action as any Holder may reasonably request, all to the extent
required from time to time to enable the Holders to sell Registrable
Securities without Registration under the Securities Act within the limitation
of the exemptions provided by (i) Rules 144, 144A or Regulation S under the
Securities Act, as such Rules may be amended from time to time, or (ii) any
similar rule or regulation hereafter adopted by the SEC. Upon the reasonable
request of a Holder, the Company will deliver to such Holder a written
statement as to whether it has complied with such requirements and, if not,
the specifics thereof.

Section 3.11 _Limitation on Registrations and Underwritten Offerings_.
Notwithstanding the rights and obligations set forth in _Section_ __ _ 3.01_
and _Section_ __ _ 3.02_, in no event shall the Company be obligated to take
any action to (i) effect more than one Marketed Underwritten Offering in any
consecutive 180-day period; (ii) effect any Underwritten Offering unless
Holders propose to sell Registrable Securities in such Underwritten Offering
having a reasonably anticipated gross aggregate price (before deduction of
underwriter commissions and offering expenses) of at least $40,000,000 or 100%
of the Registrable Securities then held by such Holders (if the value of such
Registrable Securities is reasonably anticipated to have a net aggregate price
of less than $40,000,000); (iii) effect more than four (4) Demand
Registrations; or (iv) effect more than one (1) Demand Registration in any
180-day period.

Section 3.12 _Clear Market_. With respect to any Underwritten Offerings
of Registrable Securities by Investor Holdco, or, if Investor Holdco is no
longer a Holder of Registrable Securities, then by a Participating Majority,
the Company agrees not to effect (other than pursuant to the
Registration applicable to such Underwritten Offering or pursuant to a
Special Registration, or with the consent of Investor Holdco or the
Participating Majority, as applicable) any public sale or distribution, or to
file any Registration Statement (other than 

 



43

    

 pursuant to the Registration applicable to such Underwritten Offering or
pursuant to a Special Registration) covering any of its equity securities or
any securities convertible into or exchangeable or exercisable for such
securities, during the period not to exceed ten (10) days prior and sixty (60)
days following the effective date of such offering or such longer period up to
ninety (90) days as may be requested by the managing underwriter for such
Underwritten Offering. " _Special Registration_ " means the registration of
(A) equity securities and/or options or other rights in respect thereof solely
registered on Form S-4 or Form S-8 (or successor form) or (B) shares of equity
securities and/or options or other rights in respect thereof to be offered to
directors, employees, consultants, customers, lenders or vendors of the
Company or its Subsidiaries or in connection with dividend reinvestment plans.

 

Section 3.13 _In-Kind Distributions_. If any Holder seeks to effectuate
an in-kind distribution of all or part of its Company Shares to its direct or
indirect equityholders, the Company will reasonably cooperate with and assist
such Holder, such equityholders and the Companys transfer agent to
facilitate such in-kind distribution in the manner reasonably requested by
such Holder (including the delivery of instruction letters by the Company or
its counsel to the Companys transfer agent, the delivery of customary legal
opinions by counsel to the Company and the delivery of Company Shares without
restrictive legends, to the extent no longer applicable).

Section 4.02 _Injunctive Relief_. It is hereby agreed and acknowledged
that it will be impossible to measure in money the damage that would be
suffered if the parties fail to comply with any of the obligations herein
imposed on them and that in the event of any such failure, an aggrieved Person
will be irreparably damaged and will not have an adequate remedy at law. Any
such Person shall, therefore, be entitled (in addition to any other remedy to
which it may be entitled in law or in equity) to injunctive relief, including
specific performance, to enforce such obligations, and if any action should
be brought in equity to enforce any of the provisions of this Agreement, none
of the parties hereto shall raise the defense that there is an adequate remedy
at law.

_provided_ , that, notwithstanding the foregoing, the rights and obligations
of Investor Holdco set forth herein may be assigned, in whole or in part, by
Investor Holdco, to any transferee of Registrable Securities held by Investor
Holdco (including the members of Investor Holdco and their Affiliates) and to
any Affiliate of a member of Investor Holdco that otherwise acquires Company
Shares or Company Share Equivalents in accordance with this Agreement,

4.07_ is a " _Permitted Assignee_ " and all such Persons, collectively, are "
_Permitted Assignees_ "); _provided_ _further_ , that such transferee shall

delivery of a joinder agreement, in form and substance reasonably
acceptable to the Company, agreeing to be bound by the terms and conditions
of this Agreement as if such Person were a party hereto (together with any
other documents the Company reasonably determines are necessary to make such
Person a party hereto), whereupon such Person will be treated as a Holder for
all purposes of this Agreement, with the same rights, benefits and obligations
hereunder as the transferring Holder with respect to the transferred
Registrable Securities (except that if the transferee was a Holder prior to
such transfer, such transferee shall have the same rights, benefits and
obligations with respect to the such transferred Registrable Securities as
were applicable to Registrable Securities held by such transferee prior to
such transfer). Nothing herein shall operate to permit a transfer of
Registrable Securities otherwise restricted by the Limited Liability Company

agreement to which any Holder may be a party.

 Securities (a " _Conversion Security Issuer_ ") shall assume (in a writing
delivered to the Company and the Investor Holders), with respect to such
Conversion Securities, all rights and obligations of the Company hereunder

to the extent that any Registrable Securities issued by the Company continue
to be outstanding and held by a Holder following a Conversion Event) and this
Agreement shall apply with respect to such Conversion Securities, _mutatis
mutandis_. The Company will not effect any Conversion Event unless the issuer
of the Conversion Securities complies with this  _Section_ __ _ 4.07(b)_.

beneficiary thereof) any right, remedy or claim under or by virtue of this
Agreement.
