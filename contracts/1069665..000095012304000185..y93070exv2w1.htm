contrary, shares of Class A Common Stock outstanding immediately prior to

Immediately prior to the Effective Time, each option to purchase shares of Class A Common Stock granted under any stock option plan or purchase plan, program or similar arrangement that is outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time (each, an "Option") shall, whether vested or not vested, be converted into and become the right to receive from the Surviving Corporation, promptly following the Effective Time, an amount in cash equal to the product obtained by multiplying (A) the excess of the Merger Consideration payable for each share of Class A Common Stock over the exercise price of each such Option, by (B) the number of shares of Class A Common Stock for which such Option was exercisable immediately prior to the Effective Time, and when so converted, will automatically be cancelled and retired and will cease to exist.

comply with its fiduciary obligations to the Public Stockholders under
applicable law. Notwithstanding any Non-Termination Recommendation,
this Agreement shall be submitted to the stockholders of the Company at the
Company Stockholders Meeting for the purpose of adopting this Agreement and
the transactions contemplated hereby, and nothing contained herein shall

      |   |   | Companys Amended and Restated Certificate of
Incorporation and By-laws on the date of this Agreement. These provisions may
not be amended, repealed or otherwise modified for a period of six (6) years
following the Effective Time in any manner that would adversely affect the
rights under the Amended and Restated Certificate of Incorporation and By-
laws of individuals who on or prior to the Effective Time were directors or
officers of the Company or BandN LLC or served at the request of the Company or
BandN LLC as a director or officer of another corporation, partnership, joint
venture, trust, pension or other employee benefit plan or enterprise, unless

required by such applicable law, and except to make changes permitted
by applicable law that would enlarge the exculpation, rights

_provided, however_ , that if any claims are asserted or made within
such six-year period, all rights to indemnification (and to advancement of
expenses) hereunder in respect of such claims shall continue, without

foregoing persons (collectively, the "Indemnified Parties" and each,
an "Indemnified Party"), against all claims, losses, liabilities, damages,
judgments, fines, fees, costs or expenses, including reasonable attorneys
fees and disbursements, incurred in connection with any claim, action, suit,
proceeding or investigation, whether civil, criminal, administrative or
investigative, arising out of or pertaining to matters existing or occurring
at or prior to the Effective Time (including this Agreement and the
transactions and actions contemplated hereby), whether asserted or claimed
prior to, at or after the Effective Time, to the fullest extent
permitted under applicable law and the Certificate of Incorporation or By-
laws of the Company or indemnification agreements in effect on the
date hereof, including provisions relating to advancement of
expenses incurred in the defense of any claim, action, suit, proceeding
or investigation. Without limiting the foregoing, in the event that any
claim, action, suit, proceeding or investigation is brought against an
Indemnified Party (whether arising before or after the Effective Time), the
Indemnified Party may retain counsel reasonably satisfactory to the
Surviving Corporation, and the Surviving Corporation shall (and Barnes and
Noble shall cause the Surviving Corporation to) advance the fees and expenses
of such counsel for the Indemnified Party in accordance with the Certificate
of Incorporation or By-laws of the Company in effect on the date of this
Agreement.

shall cause the Surviving Corporation to) provide, for a period of not less
than six (6) years after the  ##### Table of Contents

     

      |   |   | Effective Time, the Companys current and former
directors and officers who are currently covered by the Companys existing
director and officer insurance policy with an insurance policy (including by
arranging for run-off coverage, if necessary) that provides coverage for
events occurring at or prior to the Effective Time (the "DandO Insurance") that
is no less favorable than the existing policy, or, if substantially
equivalent insurance coverage is unavailable, the most advantageous
DandO Insurance obtainable for an annual premium equal to 300% of the annual
premium currently in place for the Company for such insurance; _provided,
however_ , that the Surviving Corporation shall not be required to pay an
annual premium for the DandO Insurance in excess of 300% of the annual premium
currently in place for the Company for such insurance; _provided further,
however_ , that in lieu of the foregoing, any of the Barnes and Noble Parties
shall be permitted to procure "tail insurance coverage" to cover the
Companys current and former directors and officers who are currently covered
by the Companys existing director and officer insurance policy
that provides coverage for events occurring at or prior to the
Effective Time, which coverage shall be no less favorable than the
existing director and officer insurance policy, and the Surviving
Corporation shall (and Barnes and Noble shall cause the Surviving Corporation
to) maintain such coverage for a period of not less than six (6) years after
the Effective Time. In the event any claim is made against present or former
directors or officers of the Company or BandN LLC that is covered or
potentially covered by insurance, neither the Surviving Corporation nor
Barnes and Noble shall do anything that would forfeit, jeopardize, restrict or
limit the insurance coverage available for that claim until the final
disposition thereof.

former directors and officers who are currently covered by the Companys
existing director and officer insurance policy and shall be enforceable by
such persons, their heirs, assigns and representatives and are in addition
to, and not in substitution for, any other rights to indemnification or
contribution that any such person may have by contract or otherwise. In the
event the Surviving Corporation or any of its successors or assigns
(i) consolidates with or merges into any other person and shall not be the
continuing or surviving corporation or entity of such consolidation or
merger, or (ii) transfers or conveys all or substantially all of its
properties and assets to any Person, then, and in each such case, proper
provision shall be made so that the successors and assigns of the Surviving
Corporation, or at Barnes and Nobles option, Barnes and Noble, shall assume the
obligations set forth in this Section 4.8.

Barnes and Noble shall, or shall cause the Surviving Corporation to,
provide employee benefits to employees of the Company or BandN

employee benefits provided to Employees immediately prior to the Closing
Date. To the extent that service is relevant for purposes of eligibility or
vesting under any plan, program or arrangement established or maintained by
Barnes and Noble for the benefit of Employees that is comparable to a plan,
program or arrangement in which any such Employee was entitled to participate
prior to the Closing Date, such plan, program or arrangement shall credit
such Employees for service on or prior to the Closing with the Company
or BandN LLC, as the case may be, for purposes of eligibility or vesting, but
not for benefit accrual or level of benefits. Following the Closing Date,
matching contributions on behalf of the Employees shall be invested in the
same manner as such contributions are invested on behalf of similarly
situated employees of Barnes and Noble.

assume or guarantee payment of all obligations of the Company or BandN LLC
