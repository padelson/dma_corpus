established and maintained so as to qualify for such exemption.
No "prohibited transaction," within the meaning of Section 4975 of the Code
or Sections 406 and 407 of ERISA, and not otherwise exempt under Section 408

Subsidiaries and ERISA Affiliates has timely made all contributions and other
payments required by and due under the terms of each Company Employee Plan.

 6.5 _Working Capital Adjustment_. 

  

 (a) _Schedule 6.5(a)_ sets forth a statement detailing the Companys calculation of the Adjusted Working Capital Amount (such statement, the "Estimated Working Capital Statement" and the calculation of the Adjusted Working Capital Amount as set forth in the Estimated Working Capital Statement, the "Estimated Adjusted Working Capital Amount"), which shall have been delivered to Parent by the Company at least one (1) Business Day prior to the date hereof. The Estimated Working Capital Statement shall have been prepared by the Company in accordance with GAAP and shall present fairly, on a good faith basis and using the Companys commercially reasonable efforts, the estimated Adjusted Working Capital Amount as of the Closing Date. Such Estimated Working Capital Statement 

   ##### 

  

 

shall be certified by the Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer
of the Company as having been prepared in accordance with the foregoing
principles and shall serve as the basis for the calculation of the Adjusted
Working Capital Amount for purposes of calculating the Merger Consideration
at Closing. 

   

 (b) Within ninety (90) days of the Closing Date, Parent shall cause to be prepared and delivered to the Stockholders Representative an updated statement of the Adjusted Working Capital Amount as of the Closing Date (the "Closing Working Capital Statement") prepared in accordance with GAAP, which shall take into account any information not available to the parties at the time the Estimated Working Capital Statement shall have been delivered. 

  

 (c) Following the delivery by Parent of the Closing Working Capital Statement, the Stockholders Representative and his representatives shall be given all such access as they may reasonably require during Parents normal business hours (or such other times as the parties may agree) to those books and records of the Company and the Surviving Corporation in the possession of, and/or under the control of, Parent, and access to such personnel or representatives of the Company and Parent as they may reasonably require for the purposes of resolving any disputes or responding to any matters or inquiries raised concerning the Closing Working Capital Statement and/or the calculation of the Adjusted Working Capital Amount. 

  

 (d) The Stockholders Representative shall have thirty (30) days following the date of delivery by Parent to the Stockholders Representative of the Closing Working Capital Statement to provide Parent with a written certificate confirming that the Adjusted Working Capital Amount used in the calculation of the Merger Consideration is correct (the "Confirmation Certificate") or notifying Parent in writing of any good faith objections to specific components of the calculation of the Adjusted Working Capital Amount as set forth on the Closing Working Capital Statement (a "Working Capital Dispute Notice") setting forth a reasonably specific and detailed description of such objections and the reasons therefor. If a Confirmation Certificate is delivered by or on behalf of the Stockholders Representative pursuant to this _Section 6.5(d)_, the Adjusted Working Capital Amount used in the calculation of the Merger Consideration shall be deemed to be final and binding on the parties to this Agreement and the Indemnifying Parties. Furthermore, to the extent no objections are raised with respect to any components of the calculation of the Adjusted Working Capital Amount as set forth in the Closing Working Capital Statement, such components shall be deemed to be agreed to by the Stockholders Representative and not subject to further dispute or objection. 

  

 (e) If the Stockholders Representative shall object to all or a portion of the components of the Closing Working Capital Statement or Parents calculation of the Adjusted Working Capital Amount as reflected in the Working Capital Dispute Notice, a representative of Parent, on the one hand, and the Stockholders Representative, on the other, shall negotiate with one another and attempt in good faith to resolve any such objection within ten (10) days of the receipt by Parent of the Working Capital Dispute Notice. 

  

 (f) If Parent and the Stockholders Representative shall be unable to resolve any such dispute within such ten (10) day period, Parent and the Stockholders Representative (either together or separately) shall be entitled to submit the dispute to the Independent Auditor. Each of the parties to this Agreement shall, and shall cause their respective officers, directors, employees, and representatives to, provide full cooperation to the Independent Auditor. The Independent Auditor shall (i) act in its capacity as an expert and not as an arbitrator, (ii) consider only those matters as to which there is a dispute between the parties and (iii) be instructed to reach its conclusions regarding any such dispute within thirty (30) days after its appointment and provide a written explanation of its decision. In the event that Parent and the Stockholders Representative shall submit any dispute to the Independent Auditor, 

   ##### 

  

 

each such party may submit a "position paper" to the Independent Auditor
setting forth the position of such party with respect to such dispute, to be
considered by such Independent Auditor as it deems fit. All fees and expenses
relating to the engagement of the Independent Auditor shall be paid in equal
proportions by Parent and the Indemnifying Parties or in such other
proportions as the Independent Auditor determines to be appropriate having
regard to the respective merits of the parties positions. Parent may elect
to pay the fees and expenses for which the Indemnifying Parties are
responsible hereunder to the Independent Auditor (the "Stockholder Expenses"),
in which case Parent shall be reimbursed for such payment by deduction of the
amount of the Stockholder Expenses from the Working Capital Escrow Amount. 

   

 (g) If the Stockholders Representative does not deliver a Working Capital Dispute Notice in accordance with the procedures set forth in _Section 6.5(d)_ above ( _i.e_., within the thirty (30) day period specified therein), the Closing Working Capital Statement (together with Parents calculation of the Adjusted Working Capital Amount) shall be deemed to have been accepted by all of the parties to this Agreement and the Indemnifying Parties. In the event that the Stockholders Representative delivers a Working Capital Dispute Notice in accordance with the provisions above and Parent and the Stockholders Representative are able to resolve such dispute by mutual agreement, the Closing Working Capital Statement, together with the calculation of the Adjusted Working Capital Amount, to the extent modified by the mutual agreement of such parties, shall be deemed to have been accepted by all of the parties to this Agreement and the Indemnifying Parties. In the event that the Stockholders Representative delivers a Working Capital Dispute Notice in accordance with the provisions set forth above and Parent and the Stockholders Representative are unable to resolve such dispute by mutual agreement, the determination of the Independent Auditor shall be final and binding on the parties to this Agreement and the Indemnifying Parties, together with the calculation of the Adjusted Working Capital Amount, to the extent modified by the Independent Auditor, shall be deemed to have been accepted by all of the parties to this Agreement and the Indemnifying Parties. The provisions of _Section 7.6_ shall apply to any and all acts by the Stockholders Representative in connection with this _Section 6.5_. The Adjusted Working Capital Amount as finally determined pursuant to this _Section 6.5_ shall be referred to herein as the "Final Adjusted Working Capital Amount." 

  

 (h) In the event that it is determined that the Adjusted Working Capital Amount shall have been understated or overstated in the original calculation of the Merger Consideration for purposes of the payments made to the Indemnifying Parties at the Closing, Parent shall be (i) in the event that the Merger Consideration shall have been overstated, entitled to deduct, _first_ from the Working Capital Escrow Amount and _second_ , if the Working Capital Escrow Amount is insufficient to satisfy the entire amount of such overstatement, from the Indemnification Escrow Amount, the amount by which the Merger Consideration shall have been overstated (the amount of such overstatement, the "Overstated Amount"), and an amount, if any, equal to the difference between the Working Capital Escrow Amount and such overstatement shall be released to the Indemnifying Parties in accordance with their Pro Rata Portion and (ii) in the event that the Merger Consideration shall have been understated, required to deliver an amount of cash equal to the amount by which the Merger Consideration shall have been understated (the amount of such understatement, the "Understated Amount") to the Paying Agent for distribution pursuant to _Section 3.4_; _provided_ , _however_ , that notwithstanding the foregoing and for the avoidance of doubt, (A) in the event the Estimated Adjusted Working Capital Amount was greater than the Adjusted Working Capital Target, then in no event shall the Overstated Amount exceed the difference between (1) the Adjusted Working Capital Target and (2) the Final Adjusted Working Capital Amount, (B) in the event the Estimated Adjusted Working Capital Amount was less than the Adjusted Working Capital Target, then in no event shall the Understated Amount exceed the difference between (I) the Adjusted Working Capital Target and (II) the Estimated Adjusted Working Capital Amount and (C) if the Estimated Adjusted Working Capital Amount and the Final Adjusted Working Capital Amount are both greater than the Adjusted Working Capital Target, there will be no adjustment pursuant to this _Section_  

   ##### 

  

 

 _6.5_. In the event of an Overstated Amount, then such Overstated Amount,
subject to the limitations set forth in the foregoing sentence, shall be
treated as Losses for purposes of  _ARTICLE VII_ , and shall be borne by the
Indemnifying Parties in accordance with each Indemnifying Partys Pro Rata
Portion. 

   

 6.6 _Repayment of Company Debt_. At or prior to the Closing, the Company shall have taken all actions necessary for the repayment or prepayment of all of the Company Debt, including the obtaining of the Payoff Letters and ascertaining any applicable withholding Taxes to be withheld (based on appropriate documentation, including IRS Forms W-9 and W-8BEN) and making all appropriate arrangements for the prepayment or repayment thereof on the Closing Date, and all such Company Debt shall be reflected in the Spreadsheet. 

  

 6.7 _Termination of Plans_. Each of the Company and any ERISA Affiliate shall have terminated, effective as of no later than immediately preceding the Closing, any and all Tax qualified group severance, separation or salary continuation plans, programs or arrangements and any and all Company Employee Plans (unless Parent provides written notice to the Company no later than one (1) Business Day prior to the Closing Date that such plans shall not be terminated). The Company shall provide Parent with evidence that such Company Employee Plan(s) have been terminated (effective as of no later than immediately preceding the Closing) pursuant to resolutions of the Board of Directors of the Company, or such ERISA Affiliate, as the case may be. The form and substance of such resolutions shall be subject to review and approval of Parent, which approval shall not be unreasonably withheld or delayed. The Company also shall take such other actions in furtherance of terminating such Company Employee Plan(s) as Parent may reasonably require. In the event that termination of Company Employee Plans would reasonably be anticipated to trigger liquidation charges, surrender charges or other costs or fees, including without limitation, related to any plan termination, then such charges and/or fees shall be deemed to be Transaction Expenses, and the Company shall take such actions as are necessary to reasonably estimate the amount of such charges and/or fees and provide such estimate in writing to Parent. 

  

 6.8 _Intentionally Omitted_.

 

 6.9 _New Employment Arrangements_. Parent or a Subsidiary of Parent may offer certain Employees, and will offer the Key Employees, employment by Parent or a Subsidiary of Parent as a Continuing Employee. Such employment will: (i) be set forth in an offer letter in Parents or the relevant Subsidiarys standard form, (ii) be subject to and in compliance with Parents and the relevant Subsidiarys applicable policies and procedures, including employment background checks and the execution of Parents employee proprietary information agreement, (iii) have terms, including the position and salary, which will be determined by Parent, (iv) require, as a condition of employment, that Employees who hold security clearances with United States governmental agencies maintain and continue to hold such security clearances, (v) include, if applicable, a waiver by the Employee of any future equity-based compensation or future severance or other termination payment to which such Employee may otherwise have been eligible with the Company, and (v) supersede any prior express or implied employment agreements, arrangements, representations, or offer letter in effect prior to the Closing Date. 

  

 6.10 _New Employment Benefits_. Continuing Employees shall be eligible to receive employee benefits on the same basis as similarly situated Parent employees consistent with Parents/its relevant Affiliates applicable human resources policies and subject to the terms of Parents/its relevant Affiliates employee benefit plans. Parent will or will cause the Surviving Corporation or appropriate Subsidiary of Parent to give Continuing Employees full credit under such policies for prior service at the Company for purposes of eligibility and vesting; provided that such credit does not result in duplication of benefits. In furtherance of the foregoing, the Company shall assist to terminate effective as of the Closing Date all employment agreements and other arrangements with its employees and contractors as required by Parent. 

   ##### 

  

  

 6.11 _Terminating Employees_. The Company shall terminate the employment of each Terminating Employee set forth on _Schedule 6.11_ hereto no later than immediately prior to or on the Closing Date. The Company shall have used its commercially reasonable efforts to cause each such Terminating Employee to execute and return a valid release and waiver each in the form attached hereto as _Exhibit H_ (a "Terminating Employee Release"), copies of which Terminating Employee Releases shall have been distributed by the Company to all Terminating Employees on the Business Day prior to the Closing Date, and, if applicable, the Company shall not affirmatively and knowingly take any action to cause such Terminating Employee to revoke his or her Terminating Employee Release. Prior to any Terminating Employee or any employee of the Company whose employment with the Company is terminated on or prior to the Closing Date receiving or becoming entitled to receive any non-statutorily required severance payment, such Terminating Employee and such terminated employee must execute and return a Terminating Employee Release. 

  

 6.12 _Non-Competition Agreements_. Concurrent with execution of this Agreement, the Company shall cause those Key Employees set forth on _Exhibit A_ hereto to execute and deliver to Parent a Non-Competition Agreement in their capacities as Company Stockholders. 

  

 6.13 _Section 280G_. Prior to the Closing, the Company shall have submitted to the Company Stockholders for approval (in a manner, at such times, and in form and substance satisfactory to Parent) by such number of Company Stockholders as is required by the terms of Section 280G(b)(5)(B) of the Code, any payments and/or benefits that would separately or in the aggregate, constitute "parachute payments" (within the meaning of Section 280G of the Code and the regulations promulgated thereunder) (which determination shall be made by the Company, subject to review and approval by Parent), such that such payments and benefits shall not be deemed to be "parachute payments" under Section 280G of the Code, and prior to the Effective Time the Company shall deliver to Parent evidence reasonably satisfactory to Parent (i) that a Company Stockholder vote was solicited in conformance with Section 280G and the regulations promulgated thereunder, and the requisite Company Stockholder approval was obtained with respect to any payments and/or benefits that were subject to the Company Stockholder vote (the "280G Approval"), or (ii) that the 280G Approval was not obtained and as a consequence, that such "parachute payments" shall not be made or provided, pursuant to the waivers of those payments and/or benefits which were executed by the affected individuals prior to the date of this Agreement. 

  

 6.14 _Indemnification of Directors and Officers_. 

  

 (a) From and after the Effective Time, Parent shall, or shall cause the Surviving Corporation to, fulfill and honor in all respects the obligations of Company pursuant to any indemnification provision under the Charter Documents as in effect on the date of this Agreement. From the Effective Time until the sixth anniversary of the Effective Time, Parent shall, or shall cause the Surviving Corporation to fulfill and honor in all respects the obligations of Company pursuant to any indemnification agreement listed on _Section 6.14(a)_ of the Disclosure Schedule in effect between the Company and any Person who is or was a director or officer of the Company prior to the Effective Time. The Certificate of Incorporation and Bylaws of the Surviving Corporation will contain provisions with respect to the exculpation and indemnification and expense advancement that are substantially the same as were in effect as of immediately prior to the Effective Time for the Company, which provisions will not be amended, repealed or otherwise modified in any material respect in any manner that would adversely affect the rights thereunder of each current and former director or officer of the Company or the Subsidiaries until the earlier of (i) six (6) years from the Effective Time and (ii) such dates as the Surviving Corporation is dissolved or merged into another corporation in which case the majority stockholder or surviving corporation in such merger, respectively, shall assume the indemnification obligations in the first sentence above. 

   ##### 

  

  

 (b) Prior to the Closing, the Company may purchase, for the benefit of all officers and directors of the Company prior to the Effective Time, policies of directors and officers and fiduciary liability "tail" or "run-off" insurance providing for such coverage as the Company may determine in its sole discretion prior to the Closing; _provided, however_ , that any costs and expenses related thereto shall be considered a Transaction Expense. 

  

 (c) The provisions of this _Section 6.14_ are intended to be for the benefit of, and will be enforceable by, each current and former directors or officers of the Company or the Subsidiaries entitled to indemnification from the Company. 

  

 6.15 _No Solicitation by Company_. 

  

 (a) Commencing upon the date hereof and continuing at all times until the earlier of the termination of this Agreement pursuant to _ARTICLE VIII_ and the Effective Time, the Company shall not, and shall cause its Subsidiaries not to, directly or indirectly through any of its directors, officers or other employees, affiliates, representatives or other agents (including its financial, legal or accounting advisors (together, "Representatives"), (i) solicit, initiate, seek, knowingly encourage, knowingly promote or support any inquiry, proposal or offer from, (ii) furnish any information to, or (iii) participate in any discussions or negotiations with, any Person (other than Parent and its Representatives) regarding (A) any acquisition of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries or controlled affiliates, (B) any merger or consolidation with or involving the Company or any of its Subsidiaries or controlled affiliates, (C) any acquisition or sale (including any public offering) of any of the stock or assets of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries or controlled affiliates (other than the sale of assets in the ordinary course of business), (D) any strategic investment in or involving the Company or any of its Subsidiaries or affiliates (including, without limitation, any new investment round or recapitalization of the Company), or (E) any other similar transaction involving the Company or any of its Subsidiaries or controlled affiliates (each, a "Company Acquisition Proposal"). The Company hereby agrees that any action taken by one or more of the Companys Subsidiaries or its or their Representatives would constitute a breach of this _Section 6.15(a)_ if taken by the Company will constitute a breach of this provision by the Company. 

  

 (b) The Company shall immediately terminate, suspend or otherwise discontinue any and all discussions or other negotiations with any Persons regarding any Company Acquisition Proposal that are pending as of the date hereof, and shall not reinitiate or otherwise engage in any further discussions or other negotiations with any such Third Parties regarding any Company Acquisition Proposal unless this Agreement is terminated pursuant to _ARTICLE VIII_. The Company agrees not to release any such parties from any confidentiality agreement to which Company is a party.

of, resulting from or relating to: 

   

 (i) any inaccuracy in or breach of any representation or warranty of the Company contained in this Agreement, the Related Agreements to which the Company is a party or the Closing Certificates; 

  

 (ii) any nonfulfillment, nonperformance or other breach by the Company of any covenant, undertaking or other agreement of the Company that is contained in this Agreement, the Related Agreements to which the Company is a party or the Closing Certificates, or with respect to  _Section 6.15_, any breach by the Representatives;

Notwithstanding anything else to the contrary, the maximum aggregate Liability of the Indemnifying Parties under this Agreement shall be the Merger Consideration and payments under the Management Acquisition Bonus Plan actually received by the Indemnifying Parties, and the maximum aggregate Liability of any individual Indemnifying Party shall be such Indemnifying Partys Pro Rata Portion of the Merger Consideration and payments under the Management Acquisition Bonus Plan actually received by such Indemnifying Party. 

    ##### 

  

     

 (b) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained herein, a Parent Indemnified Party may not recover any Losses under _Section 7.2(a)(i)_ (other than Losses arising out of, in connection with or resulting from a breach or inaccuracy of the Specified Representations) unless and until all claims brought by the Indemnified Parties under _Section 7.2(a)(i)_ exceed $350,000 in the aggregate (the "Deductible"), at which time the Parent Indemnified Parties shall be entitled to recover all such Losses in excess of the Deductible. For purposes of clarity, the Deductible shall not apply to, or be counted against, any claim by a Parent Indemnified Parties for Losses pursuant to _Section 7.2(a)(i)_ arising out of, in connection with or resulting from a breach or inaccuracy of the Specified Representations or _Section 4.21_ ( _Brokers  and Finders Fees; Transaction Expenses_), or _Section 7.2(a)(ii)_ thorough _Section 7.2(a)(vii)_. 

   

 (c) For purposes of computing the amount of any Losses incurred by a Parent Indemnified Party, (i) there shall be deducted an amount equal to the amount of any insurance proceeds, indemnification payments or contribution payments actually received by any Parent Indemnified Party in connection with such Losses; _provided_ , _however_ , that no Parent Indemnified Party shall have any obligation to obtain or seek any such insurance proceeds, indemnification payments or contribution payments and (ii) the Indemnifying Parties shall have no liability attributable to any limitations on the Companys Tax attributes under Sections 269, 382, 383 or 384 of the Code. 

   

 (d) None of the Indemnifying Parties shall have any right of contribution from nor may any Indemnifying Party seek indemnification or advancement of expenses (under Contract, pursuant to applicable Law or otherwise) from, the Company, Parent, or the Surviving Corporation with respect to any Loss claimed by a Parent Indemnified Party, _provided_ , _however_ , that the parties agree that the provisions set forth in this _Section 7.3(d)_ shall in no way be interpreted to invalidate, or otherwise impair, the rights of any Company director or officer to seek indemnification pursuant to the terms set forth in _Section 6.14_ hereof, other than to the extent in derogation of such Indemnifying Parties indemnity obligations to the Parent Indemnified Persons under this _ARTICLE VII_. 

   

 (e) For purposes of this _ARTICLE VII_ , Losses shall not include special or punitive, damages (except to the extent such damages are awarded by a Governmental Authority in connection with a Third Party Claim). The amount of any Losses subject to indemnification under this  _ARTICLE VII_ shall be calculated net of any reserves included in the calculation of the Adjusted Working Capital Amount directly attributable to such Losses. 

   

 (f) Notwithstanding anything that may be deemed to be to the contrary set forth in this Agreement, nothing in this _ARTICLE VII_ or elsewhere in this Agreement shall limit the Liability of any Person (and neither the Escrow Fund nor the aggregate Merger Consideration and payments under the Management Acquisition Bonus Plan shall be the exclusive remedy) in respect of Losses arising out of, nor bar any action against such Person (and nothing herein shall serve as a defense thereto), in relation to, any fraud committed by such Person in relation to this Agreement, any Related Agreement, any Closing Certificate or the consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby, _provided_ , _however_ , that there shall not be any double recovery to the extent a claim is asserted pursuant to _Section 7.2(a)(v)_. 

   

 (g) Any payments required to be made to Parent, the Surviving Corporation or any other Parent Indemnified Party pursuant to this _ARTICLE VII_ shall, in each case, be made _first_ by resort to the Indemnification Escrow Amount contained in the Escrow Fund (to the extent that such fund is available at the time of such claim, and in all cases with respect to matters for which the General Indemnification Cap applies), and _second_ with respect to matters for which the General Indemnification Cap does not apply, if the balance of the Indemnification Escrow Amount contained in the Escrow Fund is insufficient or unavailable to satisfy the entire amount of such payments to be made to Parent (including as a result of the funds contained in the Escrow Fund being paid to the stockholders of the Company pursuant to the terms hereof) (the amount of such insufficiency, the "Shortfall Amount"), the 

  ##### 

  

    

Surviving Corporation or any other Parent Indemnified Party, as applicable,
and by recourse, (A) for Losses other than arising out of, in connection with
or related to the matters set forth in _Section 4.14_ ( _Intellectual
Property_ ), severally, to each Indemnifying Party in an amount equal to such
Indemnifying Partys Pro Rata Portion _multiplied by_ the Shortfall Amount
(which such result shall in no event exceed the portion of the
aggregate Merger Consideration and payments under the Management Acquisition
Bonus Plan actually received by such Indemnifying Party, or (B) in the case
of Losses arising out of, in connection with or related to the matters set
forth in _Section 4.14_ ( _Intellectual Property_ ), as described in 
_Section 7.3(a)_). 

   

 (h) The right to indemnification based on representations, warranties, covenants and obligations in this Agreement will not be affected by any investigation conducted with respect to, or any knowledge acquired (or capable of being acquired) at any time, whether before or after the execution and delivery of this Agreement or the Effective Time, with respect to the accuracy or inaccuracy of or compliance with, any such representation, warranty, covenant or obligation. The waiver of any condition based on the accuracy of any representation or warranty, or on the performance of or compliance with any covenant or obligation, will not affect the right to indemnification based on such representations, warranties, covenants and obligations. 

   

 (i) The representations and warranties made by the Company in this Agreement, the Related Agreements to which the Company is a party or the Closing Certificates, constitute the sole and exclusive representations and warranties of the Company to Parent in connection with the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, and Parent understands, acknowledges and agrees that all other representations and warranties of the Company of any kind or nature, express or implied, are specifically disclaimed by the Company, _provided_ , _however_ , that the foregoing shall not be construed to prohibit or limit a claim for fraud against the Person who committed such fraud as described in _Section 7.3(f)_ or pursuant to _Section 7.2(a)(v)_. If the Merger is consummated, (i) the indemnification provisions in this _ARTICLE VII_ shall be the sole and exclusive remedy of the Parent, other Parent Indemnified Parties and their respective Affiliates, for any and all claims against the Indemnifying Parties for Losses; _provided_ , _however_ , that this section shall not limit any right of such Persons to seek and obtain specific performance, injunctive relief or any other equitable remedies to which they may be entitled under the Related Agreements to which the Indemnifying Parties are parties, and (ii) all applicable statutes of limitations or other claims periods with respect to claims hereunder shall be revised to the claims periods and survival periods expressly set forth herein. Nothing in this _ARTICLE VII_ shall limit the liability of any party hereto (though excluding the Indemnifying Parties, who shall only be subject to liability as set forth herein to the extent that the Closing occurs) for any breach of any representation, warranty, covenant or agreement contained in this Agreement, any Related Agreement or any Closing Certificate or instrument delivered pursuant thereto if the Closing does not occur. 

   

 (j) The right to indemnification based on the matters disclosed on _Schedule 7.2(a)(vi)_ shall be subject to the limitations set forth on _Schedule 7.2(a)(vi)_. 

   

 7.4 _Claims for Indemnification; Resolution of Conflicts_. 

  

 (a) _Procedure for Claims_. 

   

 (i) In the event that a Parent Indemnified Party may have a right to indemnification under this _ARTICLE VII_ (though with respect to Third-Party Claims, additionally subject to the terms and conditions set forth in _Section 7.4(b)_ below), then Parent (on behalf of such Parent Indemnified Party) shall deliver to the Stockholders Representative a certificate (a "Claim Certificate") (with contemporaneous delivery to the Escrow Agent) (i) stating that a Parent Indemnified Party has suffered or incurred, or reasonably anticipates that it may suffer or incur and/or was required under 

   ##### 

  

    

GAAP to reserve or accrue, Losses, including the amount thereof, and
(ii) specifying in reasonable detail the basis for the claim(s), as well as
the individual items of such Losses included in the amount so stated and the
nature of the claim relating thereto (which, if not determinable at such
time, may be a reasonable good faith estimate thereof) (the aggregate
amount of such Losses in a Claim Certificate being referred to as the
"Claimed Amount"). The Stockholders Representative shall have thirty (30)
days after receipt of a Claim Certificate to deliver to Parent a certificate
(an "Objection Certificate") (with contemporaneous delivery to the Escrow
Agent), pursuant to which the Stockholders Representative shall, on behalf
of the Indemnifying Parties: (A) agree that the Parent Indemnified Party
is entitled to receive all of the Claimed Amount (in which case, if requested
by Parent, Parent and the Stockholders Representative shall deliver to the
Escrow Agent, within three (3) Business Days following delivery of the
Objection Certificate, a written notice executed by both such
parties instructing the Escrow Agent to distribute to Parent, out of the
Escrow Fund, an amount equal to the Claimed Amount or the applicable portion
thereof as determined by Parent, and, if in whole or in part against the
Indemnifying Parties, the Indemnifying Parties shall promptly cause to be
paid to Parent an amount equal to the product of (x) such Indemnifying
Partys Pro Rata Portion,  _multiplied by_ (y) the Claimed Amount (subject to
the limitations set forth in this _ARTICLE VII_ ), (B) agree that the Parent
Indemnified Party is entitled to receive part, but not all, of the Claimed
Amount (the "Agreed Amount") (in which case, if requested by Parent, Parent
and the Stockholders Representative shall deliver to the Escrow Agent,
within three (3) Business Days following delivery of the Objection
Certificate, a written notice executed by both such parties instructing the
Escrow Agent to distribute to Parent, out of the Escrow Fund, an amount equal
to the Agreed Amount or the applicable portion thereof as determined by
Parent, and, if in whole or in part against the Indemnifying Parties, the
Indemnifying Parties shall promptly cause to be paid to Parent an amount
equal to the product of (x) such Indemnifying Partys Pro Rata Portion,
_multiplied by_ (y) the Agreed Amount (subject to the limitations set forth
in this _ARTICLE VII_ )), or (C) contest that the Indemnified Party is
entitled to receive any of the Claimed Amount and specify, in reasonable
detail based on the information then known, any objections to the claims
in such Claim Certificate or the Claimed Amount. If the Stockholders
Representative fails to deliver an Objection Certificate within thirty (30)
days after receipt of a Claim Certificate, then the Stockholders
Representative shall be deemed, for and on behalf of the Indemnifying Parties,
to agree that the Parent Indemnified Party is entitled to receive all of the
Claimed Amount (in which case, if requested by Parent, Parent and the
Stockholders Representative shall deliver to the Escrow Agent, within three
(3) Business Days following delivery of the Objection Certificate, a written
notice executed by both such parties instructing the Escrow Agent to
distribute to Parent, out of the Escrow Fund, an amount equal to the Claimed
Amount or the applicable portion thereof as determined by Parent, and, if in
whole or in part against the Indemnifying Parties, the Indemnifying Parties
shall promptly cause to be paid to Parent an amount equal to the product
of (x) such Indemnifying Partys Pro Rata Portion, _multiplied by_ (y) the
Claimed Amount (subject to the applicable limitations contained herein)). 

  

 (ii) Notwithstanding the foregoing, to the extent permitted under _Section 7.3(g)_, any Parent Indemnified Party may make a claim directly against the Indemnifying Parties in respect of the Shortfall Amount. 

  

 (b) _Third Party Claims_. In the event that Parent becomes aware of a third party claim (other than a claim that is the subject of an Agreed-Upon Loss) (each, a "Third Party Claim") which Parent reasonably believes would result in a demand for indemnification pursuant to this  _ARTICLE VII_ , Parent shall timely notify the Stockholders Representative of such claim (the "Third Party Claim Notice"), and the Stockholders Representative shall (A) be entitled on behalf of the Indemnifying Parties, at its sole option and expense, to participate in, but not to determine or conduct, the defense of such Third Party Claim, and (B) have the right to receive copies of all pleadings, notices and material communications with respect to the Third-Party Claim to the extent that receipt of such documents does not affect any privilege or confidentiality obligations relating to any Parent Indemnified Party. The failure to so notify the Stockholders Representative shall not relieve the Indemnifying Parties 

  ##### 

  

    

of any Liability, except to the extent the Stockholders Representative
demonstrates that the defense of such Third Party Claim is actually
and materially prejudiced thereby or if such notice shall have occurred after
survival periods set forth in _Section 7.1_ with respect to such claims.
Parent shall have the right in its sole discretion to conduct the defense of,
and to settle, any Third Party Claim; _provided_ , _however_ , that except
with the consent of the Stockholders Representative in writing (not to be
unreasonably withheld or delayed; _provided_ , that the parties agree that
the Stockholders Representatives failure to provide consent based on the
amount of Losses, or whether the Indemnifying Parties have an obligation to
indemnify Parent or other Parent Indemnified Parties pursuant to this
Agreement, shall not, in and of itself, be considered unreasonable), no
settlement of any such Third Party Claim shall be determinative of the amount
of Losses relating to such matter or whether the Parent Indemnified Parties
are entitled to indemnification hereunder with respect thereto. In the
event that the Stockholders Representative has consented in writing to any
such settlement, the Indemnifying Parties shall have no power or authority to
object under any provision of this  _ARTICLE VII_ to the amount of any claim
by Parent against the Escrow Fund with respect to such settlement. Neither
the Stockholders Representative nor any Indemnifying Party may settle
or compromise any such Third Party Claim without the prior written consent of
the relevant Parent Indemnified Party(ies) (which consent shall not be
unreasonably withheld or delayed); _provided_  that, notwithstanding the
foregoing, any such Parent Indemnified Party shall be entitled to withhold
its consent, in its sole discretion, to any proposed settlement or compromise
that (i) does not include a provision whereby the plaintiff or claimant in
the matter releases such Parent Indemnified Party from all Liabilities with
respect thereto, (ii) would obligate such Parent Indemnified Party to pay an
amount related thereto in excess of the amount then available
for indemnification pursuant to this _ARTICLE VII_ or (iii) would reasonably
be expected to have an adverse impact on the reputation (business or
otherwise) of Parent or any of its Affiliates. 

   

 (c) _Resolution of Conflicts_. 

   

 (i) In case the Stockholders Representative shall timely deliver an Objection Certificate (including in the case of Third Party Claims that are not ultimately resolved between Parent and the Stockholders Representative), then for a period of thirty (30) days after delivery of such Objection Certificate, the Stockholders Representative and Parent shall attempt in good faith to agree upon the rights of the respective parties with respect to each of such claims objected to in the Objection Certificate. Either party may, but shall not be obligated to, initiate non binding mediation of the dispute with the assistance of a neutral arbitrator belonging to and under the rules of the CPR Institute for Dispute Resolution. The party requesting the mediation shall arrange for mediation services, subject to the approval of the other party, which shall not be unreasonably withheld. Mediation shall take place in Santa Clara County, California during reasonable business hours and upon reasonable advance written notice. Mediation may be scheduled to begin at any time, but with at least ten (10) Business Days written notice to all parties. If one party initiates mediation, the parties (A) shall participate in the mediation in good faith and shall commit reasonable time and energy to the mediation so as to promptly resolve the dispute or conclude that they cannot resolve the dispute and (B) shall not pursue other remedies while such mediation is proceeding. If the Stockholders Representative and Parent should so agree (whether by mediation or otherwise), a memorandum setting forth such agreement shall be prepared and signed by both parties and, in the case of a claim against the Escrow Fund, shall be furnished to the Escrow Agent instructing the Escrow Agent to distribute to Parent, out of the Escrow Fund, an amount equal to the Losses so agreed or the applicable portion thereof as determined by Parent. 

  

 (ii) Should Parent and the Stockholders Representative be unable to agree as to any particular item or items or amount or amounts specified in an Objection Certificate within the time periods specified in _Section 7.4(c)(i)_, then the Parent Indemnified Party shall be permitted to submit such dispute to a court of competent jurisdiction in accordance with  _Section 9.6_. Upon resolution of such dispute, or receipt of a final non-appealable order or determination from a court of competent jurisdiction 

   ##### 

  

    

setting forth the resolution of such dispute, then, if requested by Parent,
Parent and the Stockholders Representative shall deliver to the Escrow
Agent, within three (3) Business Days following such resolution or receipt, a
written notice executed by both such parties instructing the Escrow Agent to
distribute to Parent, out of the Escrow Fund, an amount equal to the Losses
so determined or the applicable portion thereof as determined by Parent, and,
if in whole or in part against the Indemnifying Parties, the Indemnifying
Parties shall promptly cause to be paid, as applicable, by wire transfer to
Parent an amount equal to the product of (x) such Indemnifying Partys Pro
Rata Portion, _multiplied by_ (y) the Losses determined in such resolution or
so ordered to be paid, if any (subject to the applicable limitations
contained herein). The Escrow Agent shall be entitled to rely on any such
final non-appealable order or determination from a court of competent
jurisdiction and distribute cash from the Escrow Fund in accordance with the
terms thereof. 

  

 (d) _Agreed Upon Losses_. _Section 7.4(c)_ shall not apply to claims made in respect of (A) any Additional Transaction Expenses, Company indebtedness for borrowed money (including the principal, interest and premium (if any)) that is not reflected in the Spreadsheet or contractual Additional Change-in-Control Payments, or (B) any Agent Interpleader Expenses or Agent Indemnification Expenses (each of (A) and (B), an "Agreed Upon Loss"). Notwithstanding  _Section 7.4(a)_, the Stockholders Representative hereby waives the right to object to any claims against the Escrow Fund or otherwise in respect of any Agreed Upon Loss. 

   

 (e) _Tax Returns_. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary, Parent shall be responsible for the preparation and filing of any Return with respect to the Company or any of its Subsidiaries that is required to be filed after the Closing Date (as well as the related costs of the preparation thereof, except to the extent such costs are otherwise determined to be indemnifiable Losses), including any amended or previously unfiled Return relating to any period filed in order to comply with applicable Law; _provided_ , _however_ , that Parent shall permit the Stockholders Representative (and any other tax or legal advisor to the Stockholders Representative, at the reasonable discretion of Stockholders Representative whom Stockholders Representative may engage to review such Return) to review and comment on each such material Return prior to such filing. Not less than thirty (30) days before the earlier of the due date of any such Return or the date on which such material Return is to be filed, Parent shall furnish a draft of such Return (as proposed to be filed) to Stockholders Representative for his review. Not less than twenty (20) days before the earlier of the due date of such Return or the date on which such Return is to be filed, Stockholders Representative shall forward to Parent any comments it may have relating to such Return, and Parent and the Stockholders Representative shall agree to resolve in good faith any disputes regarding such Return prior to the due date or the date such Return is intended to be filed by Parent. Any dispute regarding such Return that cannot be resolved by negotiation between Parent and the Stockholders Representative shall be resolved by the Independent Auditor no later than the day that is five (5) Business Days prior to the due date of such Return ( _provided_ , that, if such dispute has not been resolve prior to such day, Parent will exercise its good faith judgment with respect to the contents of such Return); _provided_ , _however_ , that in resolving a dispute with respect to a Return, the Independent Auditor shall be bound by the requirement that the Return be prepared in a manner consistent with past reporting practices of the Company or the applicable Subsidiary unless otherwise required in accordance with applicable Law (it being understood that a position taken on a Return is in accordance with applicable Law to the extent the position is determined to be more likely than not to be sustained). Each of the parties also agrees to the additional procedures set forth in _Schedule 7.2(a)(vi)_. 

   

 7.5 _Escrow Arrangements_. 

  

 (a) _Escrow_. From and after the Closing, the Indemnifying Parties agree that, subject to the other provisions of this _ARTICLE VII_ , the Escrow Fund shall be available to indemnify, defend and hold harmless the Parent Indemnified Parties from and against any and all Losses in respect of which 

  ##### 

  

    

such Parent Indemnified Parties may be indemnified, defended or held harmless
under this _ARTICLE VII_ ; _provided, however_ , that the Working Capital
Escrow Amount shall only be available to compensate the Parent Indemnified
Parties for any overstatement in the Merger Consideration as set forth in
_Section 6.5_ (which the parties agree shall be the first source of recourse
for any such overstatement). The Escrow Agent may execute this
Agreement following the date hereof and prior to the Closing, and such later
execution, if so executed after the date hereof, shall not affect the binding
nature of this Agreement as of the date hereof between the other signatories
hereto. 

   

 (b) _Satisfaction of Claims_. Recovery against the Indemnification Escrow Amount contained in the Escrow Fund shall be the Parent Indemnified Parties sole and exclusive remedy for indemnification claims under _Section 7.2(a)(i)_, except in the case of Losses arising out of or resulting from a breach or inaccuracy of the Specified Representations, or to which the General Indemnification Cap does not otherwise apply. The Indemnifying Parties shall, and do hereby, pledge and grant a security interest in the Escrow Fund. 

   

 (c) _Escrow Period; Distribution Upon Termination of Escrow Period_. Subject to the following requirements, the Escrow Fund shall be in existence immediately following the Effective Time. Fifty percent (50%) of the amount held in the Escrow Fund on the date that is the one (1) year anniversary of the Closing Date (less any amount which, in the reasonable judgment of Parent, is necessary to satisfy any unresolved claims specified in any Claim Certificate that is delivered to the Stockholders Representative prior to 5:00 p.m. Pacific on the one (1) year anniversary of the Closing Date with respect to facts and circumstances existing on or prior to 5:00 p.m. Pacific on the one (1) year anniversary of the Closing Date), shall be released from the Escrow Fund no later than 5:00 p.m. Pacific time on the fifth (5th) Business Day following the one (1) year anniversary of the Closing Date (the "First Escrow Release"). Any amounts remaining in the Escrow Fund on the date that is eighteen (18) months from the Closing Date shall be released from the Escrow Fund at 5:00 p.m., Pacific time as soon as commercially practicable and in no event later than the fifth (5th) Business Day after such date (less any amount which, in the reasonable judgment of Parent, is necessary to satisfy any unresolved claims specified in any Claim Certificate that is delivered to the Escrow Agent prior to 5:00 p.m. Pacific on the date that is eighteen (18) months from the Closing Date with respect to facts and circumstances existing on or prior to such date); _provided, however_ , that the Escrow Fund with respect to the Working Capital Escrow Amount shall terminate in accordance with _Section 6.5_. Following the termination of the Escrow Fund with respect to the Indemnification Escrow Amount, the Escrow Agent shall deliver to each of the Indemnifying Parties such Indemnifying Partys Pro Rata Portion (if any) of the remaining portion of the Escrow Fund not required to satisfy any then pending claims against the Escrow Fund and shall deliver to each of the Indemnifying Parties such Indemnifying Partys Pro Rata Portion (if any) of the remaining portion of the Indemnification Escrow Amount, if any, following resolution of all such claims. In the event that it is determined that the Adjusted Working Capital Amount shall have been understated in the original calculation of the Merger Consideration for purposes of the payments made to the Indemnifying Parties at the Closing, or overstated in an amount that is less than the Working Capital Escrow Amount, the Escrow Agent shall deliver to each Indemnifying Party such Indemnifying Partys Pro Rata Portion (if any) of the remaining portion of the Working Capital Escrow Amount not required to satisfy any overstatement pursuant to _Section 6.5_ as soon as commercially practicable following resolution by Parent and the Stockholders Representative of the Adjusted Working Capital Amount. 

   

 (d) _Protection of Escrow Fund_. 

   

 (i) The Escrow Agent shall hold and safeguard the Escrow Fund, shall treat such fund as a trust fund in accordance with the terms of this Agreement and shall hold and dispose of the Escrow Fund only in accordance with the terms of this _ARTICLE VII_. 

   ##### 

  

  

 (ii) The Indemnification Escrow Amount shall be invested in U.S. Treasury bills with maturities of not more than ninety (90) days and any interest paid on such Escrow Amount shall be added to the Escrow Fund and become a part thereof. For any period of time before such U.S. Treasury bills can be purchased by the Escrow Agent, after such bills mature, or in the event the Treasury Bills are yielding a negative return, the Indemnification Escrow Amount shall be invested in a U.S. Bank money market deposit account of the Escrow Agent, as described on _Schedule 7.5(d)(ii)_ hereto, and any interest paid on such Indemnification Escrow Amount shall be added to the Escrow Fund and become a part thereof and available for satisfaction of claims or otherwise distributed to the Indemnifying Parties in accordance with the terms hereof. Such interest will be treated for income tax purposes as earned by Parent, paid to the Indemnifying Parties as interest for the deferral of a portion of the Merger Consideration and payments under the Management Acquisition Bonus Plan and then contributed by the Indemnifying Parties to the Escrow Fund. 

  

 (e) _Escrow Agent s Duties_. 

   

 (i) The Escrow Agent shall be obligated only for the performance of such duties as are specifically set forth herein and as set forth in any additional written escrow instructions that the Escrow Agent may receive after the date of this Agreement that are signed by an officer of Parent and the Stockholders Representative, and may rely and shall be protected in relying or refraining from acting on any instrument reasonably believed to be genuine and to have been signed or presented by the proper party or parties. The Escrow Agent shall not be liable for any act done or omitted hereunder as Escrow Agent while acting in good faith and in the exercise of reasonable judgment, and any act done or omitted pursuant to the advice of legal counsel shall be conclusive evidence of such good faith. 

  

 (ii) The Escrow Agent is hereby expressly authorized to disregard any and all warnings given by any of the parties hereto or by any other person, excepting only orders or process of courts of law, and is hereby expressly authorized to comply with and obey orders, judgments or decrees of any court. In case the Escrow Agent obeys or complies with any such order, judgment or decree of any court, the Escrow Agent shall not be liable to any of the parties hereto or to any other person by reason of such compliance, notwithstanding any such order, judgment or decree being subsequently reversed, modified, annulled, set aside, vacated or found to have been entered without jurisdiction. 

  

 (iii) The Escrow Agent shall not be liable in any respect on account of the identity, authority or rights of the parties executing or delivering or purporting to execute or deliver this Agreement or any documents or papers deposited or called for hereunder. 

  

 (iv) The Escrow Agent shall not be liable for the expiration of any rights under any statute of limitations with respect to this Agreement or any documents deposited with the Escrow Agent. 

  

 (v) In performing any duties under this Agreement, the Escrow Agent shall not be liable to any party for damages, losses or expenses, except for gross negligence or willful misconduct on the part of the Escrow Agent. Subject to the foregoing sentence, the Escrow Agent shall not incur any such liability for (A) any act or failure to act made or omitted in good faith or (B) any action taken or omitted in reliance upon any instrument, including any written statement of affidavit provided for in this Agreement that the Escrow Agent shall in good faith believe to be genuine, nor will the Escrow Agent be liable or responsible for forgeries, fraud, impersonations, or determining the scope of any representative authority. In addition, the Escrow Agent may consult with legal counsel in connection with performing the Escrow Agents duties under this Agreement and shall be fully protected in any act taken, suffered, or permitted by him/her in good faith in accordance with the advice of counsel. The 

   ##### 

  

    

Escrow Agent is not responsible for determining and verifying the authority
of any person acting or purporting to act on behalf of any party to this
Agreement. 

  

 (vi) If any controversy arises between the parties to this Agreement, or with any other party, concerning the subject matter of this Agreement, its terms or conditions, the Escrow Agent will not be required to determine the controversy or to take any action regarding it. The Escrow Agent may hold all documents and the Indemnification Escrow Amount and may wait for settlement of any such controversy by final appropriate legal proceedings or other means as, in the Escrow Agents discretion, may be required, despite what may be set forth elsewhere in this Agreement. In such event, the Escrow Agent will not be liable for damages. Furthermore, the Escrow Agent may at its option, file an action of interpleader requiring the parties to answer and litigate any claims and rights among themselves. The Escrow Agent is authorized to deposit with the clerk of the court all documents and the Escrow Amounts held in escrow, except all costs, expenses, charges and reasonable attorney fees incurred by the Escrow Agent due to the interpleader action (the "Agent Interpleader Expenses") and which the parties agree to pay as follows: 50% to be paid to Parent and 50% to be paid by the Indemnifying Parties on the basis of the such Persons respective Pro Rata Portions (though in all cases, first from the Escrow Fund, to the extent not otherwise exhausted). Upon initiating such action, the Escrow Agent shall be fully released and discharged of and from all obligations and liability imposed by the terms of this Agreement. 

  

 (vii) The parties and their respective successors and assigns agree jointly and severally to indemnify and hold Escrow Agent harmless against any and all losses, claims, damages, liabilities and expenses, including reasonable costs of investigation, counsel fees, including allocated costs of in house counsel and disbursements that may be imposed on Escrow Agent or incurred by Escrow Agent in connection with the performance of its duties under this Agreement, including but not limited to any litigation arising from this Agreement or involving its subject matter, other than those arising out of the negligence or willful misconduct of the Escrow Agent (the "Agent Indemnification Expenses") as follows: 50% to be paid by Parent and 50% to be paid by the Indemnifying Parties on the basis of such Persons respective Pro Rata Portions (though in all cases, first from the Escrow Fund, to the extent not otherwise exhausted); _provided_ , _however_ , that in the event any Person fails to timely pay his or her Pro Rata Portion of the Agent Indemnification Expenses, the parties agree that Parent may at its option pay such Persons Pro Rata Portion of the Agent Indemnification Expenses and recover an equal amount (which shall be deemed an Agreed Upon Loss) from such Persons Pro Rata Portion of the Escrow Fund. 

  

 (viii) The Escrow Agent may resign at any time upon giving at least thirty (30) days written notice to the Parent and the Stockholders Representative; _provided_ , _however_ , that no such resignation shall become effective until the appointment of a successor escrow agent which shall be accomplished as follows: Parent and the Stockholders Representative shall use their commercially reasonable efforts to mutually agree on a successor escrow agent within thirty (30) days after receiving such notice. If the parties fail to agree upon a successor escrow agent within such time, the Escrow Agent shall have the right to appoint a successor escrow agent authorized to do business in the State of California. The successor escrow agent shall execute and deliver an instrument accepting such appointment and it shall, without further acts, be vested with all the estates, properties, rights, powers, and duties of the predecessor escrow agent as if originally named as escrow agent. Upon appointment of a successor escrow agent, the Escrow Agent shall be discharged from any further duties and liability under this Agreement. 

  

 (f) _Fees_. Notwithstanding the foregoing, all fees and expenses of the Escrow Agent for general administration and performance of its duties hereunder shall be paid by Parent in accordance with the standard fee schedule of the Escrow Agent. It is understood that the fees and usual charges agreed upon for services of the Escrow Agent shall be considered compensation for ordinary services as 

  ##### 

  

    

contemplated by this Agreement. In the event that the conditions of
this Agreement are not promptly fulfilled, or if the Escrow Agent renders any
service not provided for in this Agreement, or if the parties request a
substantial modification of its terms, or if any controversy arises, or if
the Escrow Agent is made a party to, or intervenes in, any
litigation pertaining to the Escrow Fund or its subject matter, the Escrow
Agent shall be reasonably compensated for such extraordinary services and
reimbursed for all costs, attorneys fees, including allocated costs of in
house counsel, and expenses occasioned by such default, delay, controversy or
litigation. 

   

 (g) _Successor Escrow Agents_. Any corporation into which the Escrow Agent in its individual capacity may be merged or converted or with which it may be consolidated, or any corporation resulting from any merger, conversion or consolidation to which the Escrow Agent in its individual capacity shall be a party, or any corporation to which substantially all the corporate trust business of the Escrow Agent in its individual capacity may be transferred, shall be the Escrow Agent under this Agreement without further act. 

   

 7.6 _Stockholders  Representative_. 

  

 (a) The Indemnifying Parties, by adopting this Agreement and/or approving the transactions contemplated hereby, by receiving the applicable portions of the Merger Consideration pursuant to this Agreement and/or by receiving a payment pursuant to the Management Acquisition Bonus Plan, irrevocably appoint the Stockholders Representative as their agent and attorney-in-fact to act on behalf of each of the Indemnifying Parties, in connection with and to facilitate the consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby, which shall include the power and authority: 

  

 (i) for the purposes of _ARTICLE VII_ , to give and receive notices and communications, to authorize delivery to any Parent Indemnified Party of cash from the Escrow Fund in satisfaction of claims by a Parent Indemnified Party, to agree to, negotiate, enter into settlements and compromises of, and bring suit and comply with orders and awards of courts with respect to such claims, and to take all actions necessary or appropriate in the judgment of the Stockholders Representative for the accomplishment of the foregoing. 

  

 (ii) to execute and deliver such waivers and consents in connection with this Agreement and the consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby and thereby as the Stockholders Representative, in its sole discretion, may deem necessary or desirable; 

  

 (iii) to enforce and protect the rights and interests of the Company Stockholders and to enforce and protect the rights and interests of all Indemnifying Parties arising out of or under or in any manner relating to this Agreement, and any other document contemplated hereby, and to take any and all actions which the Stockholders Representative believes are necessary or appropriate under this Agreement for and on behalf of the Indemnifying Parties; 

  

 (iv) to refrain from enforcing any right of the Indemnifying Parties or any of them and/or the Stockholders Representative arising out of or under or in any manner relating to this Agreement or any document contemplated hereby; _provided_ , _however_ , that no such failure to act on the part of the Stockholders Representative, except as otherwise provided in this Agreement, shall be deemed a waiver of any such right or interest by the Stockholders Representative or by the Indemnifying Parties unless such waiver is in writing signed by the waiving party or by the Stockholders Representative; and 

  

 (v) to make, execute, acknowledge and deliver all such other agreements, guarantees, orders, receipts, endorsements, notices, requests, instructions, certificates, stock powers, 

   ##### 

  

    

letters and other writings, and, in general, to do any and all things and to
take any and all action that the Stockholders Representative, in its sole
and absolute discretion, may consider necessary or proper or convenient in
connection with or to carry out the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement and all other documents contemplated hereby. 

  

 (b) The Stockholders Representative may resign upon written notice to the Surviving Corporation, with or without cause, and the holders of a majority interest of the Indemnity Escrow Amount shall appoint a successor. Additionally, the Stockholders Representative may be changed by the Indemnifying Parties upon 10 days prior written notice to Parent, signed by a majority in interest of the Indemnity Escrow Amount. The outgoing Stockholders Representative shall be entitled to immediate reimbursement of all Stockholders Representative Expenses pursuant to  _Section 7.6(f)_ (with any balance in the Stockholders Representative Fund to inure to the benefit of the succeeding Stockholders Representative, and with any remaining balance to be paid to the Indemnifying Parties based on their Pro Rata Portion, as described in _Section 7.6(f)_ ), and in all cases subject to the terms of this _Section 7.6_. The successor shall be entitled to all the rights, powers, immunities and privileges as was his or her predecessor, without the need of any further act or writing. No bond shall be required of the Stockholders Representative, and the Stockholders Representative shall not receive compensation for his or her services. Notices or communications to or from the Stockholders Representative shall constitute notice to or from each of the Indemnifying Parties. 

   

 (c) The Stockholders Representative shall not be liable for any act done or omitted hereunder as Stockholders Representative, whether or not in reliance upon any notice, direction, instruction, consent, statement or other document, except to the extent arising from the gross negligence or willful misconduct of the Stockholders Representative (and any action taken or omitted to be taken upon the advice of counsel shall be conclusive evidence of the absence of gross negligence or willful misconduct). 

   

 (d) A decision, act, consent or instruction of the Stockholders Representative with respect to the matters regarding the Escrow Fund contemplated by this _Section 7.6_ shall constitute a decision of all of the Company Stockholders and shall be final, binding and conclusive, and the Parent Indemnified Parties may rely upon any such decision, act, consent or instruction of the Stockholders Representative as being the decision, act, consent or instruction of each Indemnifying Party. The Parent Indemnified Parties are hereby relieved from any Liability to any Person for any acts done by them in accordance with such decision, act, consent or instruction of the Stockholders Representative. 

   

 (e) Parent and Sub, on behalf of all Parent Indemnified Parties, hereby agree that any notice, right, or obligation required to be delivered to, performed by, or asserted by the Indemnifying Parties regarding the Escrow Fund shall be delivered to, performed by or asserted by the Stockholders Representative. 

   

 (f) Each of the Indemnifying Parties, by adopting this Agreement and/or approving the transactions contemplated hereby, by receiving the applicable portions of the Merger Consideration pursuant to this Agreement and/or by receiving a payment pursuant to the Management Acquisition Bonus Plan, agrees to release and hold harmless, and indemnify, each Person who acts as Stockholders Representative with respect to all actions, decisions, elections or other determinations made by such Persons in the performance of their duties as the Stockholders Representative, except to the extent arising from the gross negligence or willful misconduct of any such Person (and any action taken or omitted to be taken upon the advice of counsel shall be conclusive evidence of the absence of gross negligence or willful misconduct). Such indemnity shall be paid first from the Stockholders Representative Fund to the extent then available, and thereafter directly from the Indemnifying Parties on a several and not joint basis. The availability of indemnity for Persons who act as the Stockholders Representative shall be 

  ##### 

  

    

subject to the same privileges as contemplated for directors of a Delaware
corporation under DGCL Section 145; provided, that solely the Indemnifying
Parties (and not the Parent, Company nor any other their affiliates) shall be
liable therefor. In addition, each Indemnifying Party agrees that the costs
and expenses incurred by the Stockholders Representative in the performance
of his or her duties hereunder (such costs and expenses, the "Stockholders
Representative Expenses") shall be paid for and be the responsibility of the
Indemnifying Parties in accordance with their Pro Rata Portions. Within one
(1) Business Day after the Closing, Parent shall deliver to the
Stockholders Representative an amount in cash equal to $250,000 (the
"Stockholder Representative Fund Amount") from the portion of the Merger
Consideration and payments under the Management Bonus Plan payable to the
Indemnifying Parties at Closing in accordance with their respective Pro Rata
Portions, to an account specified by the Stockholders Representative on or
prior to Closing Date as the fund for reimbursement of Stockholders
Representative Expenses (the "Stockholders Representative Fund"). Any
balance of the Stockholders Representative Fund not used for such
reimbursement by the Stockholders Representative or its successor(s), shall
be returned by the Stockholders Representative to the Indemnifying Parties
in accordance with their Pro Rata Portions, at such time as the Stockholders
Representative reasonably determines in his sole discretion that such
a balance is no longer needed to carry out the duties of the Stockholders
Representative hereunder. All Stockholders Representative Expenses shall be
paid first from the Stockholders Representative Fund, to the extent then
available, and thereafter directly from the Indemnifying Parties on a several
and not joint basis. Without limiting the right of the Stockholders
Representative to such reimbursement or such indemnity from the Stockholders
Representative Fund or directly from the Indemnifying Parties, following the
date on which the Escrow Fund is finally released to the Indemnifying Parties
and the satisfaction or resolution of all claims made by Parent
Indemnified Parties for Losses, the Stockholders Representative shall have
the right, but not the obligation, to recover any Stockholders
Representative Expenses not covered by the Stockholders Representative Fund
from the Escrow Fund prior to any distribution to the Indemnifying Parties
and prior to any such distribution, shall deliver to the Escrow Agent a
certificate setting forth the Stockholders Representative Expenses actually
incurred, but not to the extent covered by the Stockholders Representative
Fund. 

   

 (g) The parties agree that the Stockholders Representative shall have reasonable access, during normal business hours and upon reasonable notice, to information about the Company (as the Surviving Corporation) and Parent and the reasonable assistance of the Companys (as the Surviving Corporation) and Parents officers and employees to the extent required solely for purposes of performing his or her duties and exercising his or her rights under this Agreement upon execution of a non-disclosure agreement under which the Stockholders Representative agrees to treat confidentially and not disclose any nonpublic information from or about the Company (as the Surviving Corporation), Parent or their Affiliates to anyone (except on a need to know basis to individuals (identified to the company and Parent in writing in advance) who agree in writing to treat such information confidentially) or use such information for any other purpose.

 9.2 _Counterparts_. This Agreement may be executed in any number of counterparts, each of which shall be enforceable against the parties actually executing such counterparts, and all of which together shall constitute one instrument. A facsimile, telecopy or other reproduction of this Agreement may be executed by one or more parties hereto and delivered by such party by facsimile or any similar electronic transmission device pursuant to which the signature of or on behalf of such party can be seen. Such execution and delivery shall be considered valid, binding and effective for all purposes. At the request of any party hereto, all parties hereto agree to execute and deliver an original of this Agreement as well as any facsimile, telecopy or other reproduction hereof. 

  

 9.3 _Entire Agreement; Assignment_. This Agreement, the exhibits hereto, the Disclosure Schedule, the Confidentiality Agreement, the Related Agreements and the documents and instruments and other agreements among the parties hereto referenced herein: (a) constitute the entire agreement among the parties with respect to the subject matter hereof and supersede all prior agreements and understandings both written and oral, among the parties with respect to the subject matter hereof, (b) are not intended to confer upon any other Person any rights or remedies hereunder (other than _Section 6.14_, for which the Companys directors and officers shall be considered third party beneficiaries from and after the Closing), and (c) shall not be assigned by operation of Law or otherwise, except that Parent and Sub may assign their rights and delegate their obligations hereunder to their Affiliates as long as Parent remains ultimately liable for all of Parents and Subs obligations hereunder. 

  

 9.4 _Severability_. In the event that any provision of this Agreement or the application thereof, becomes or is declared by a court of competent jurisdiction to be illegal, void or unenforceable, the remainder of this Agreement will continue in full force and effect and the application of such provision to other Persons or circumstances will be interpreted so as reasonably to effect the intent of the parties hereto. The parties further agree to replace such void or unenforceable provision of this Agreement with a valid and enforceable provision that will achieve, to the extent possible, the economic, business and other purposes of such void or unenforceable provision. 

  

 9.5 _Other Remedies_. Except as otherwise set forth herein, any and all remedies herein expressly conferred upon a party will be deemed cumulative with and not exclusive of any other remedy conferred hereby, or by law or equity upon such party, and the exercise by a party of any one remedy will not preclude the exercise of any other remedy. 

  

 9.6 _Governing Law; Exclusive Jurisdiction; Venue_. This Agreement shall be governed by and construed in accordance with the laws of the State of Delaware, regardless of the laws that might otherwise govern under applicable principles of conflicts of laws thereof. Subject to  _ARTICLE VII_  

   ##### 

  

 

hereof, each of the parties hereto irrevocably consents to the
exclusive jurisdiction and venue of any court within Santa Clara County,
State of California, in connection with any matter based upon or arising out
of this Agreement or the matters contemplated herein, agrees that process may
be served upon them in any manner authorized by the laws of the State
of California for such persons and waives and covenants not to assert or
plead any objection which they might otherwise have to such jurisdiction,
venue and such process. Subject to _ARTICLE VII_ hereof, each party agrees
not to commence any legal proceedings related hereto except in such courts. 

   

 9.7 _Enforcement_. Each party hereto acknowledges that the other party will be irreparably harmed and that there will be no adequate remedy at law for any violation by any party of any of the covenants or agreements contained in this Agreement, including the confidentiality obligations set forth in _Section 6.1_. It is accordingly agreed that, in addition to any other remedies that may be available upon the breach of any such covenants or agreements, each party hereto shall have the right to injunctive relief to restrain a breach or threatened breach of, or otherwise to obtain specific performance of, the other partys covenants and agreements contained in this Agreement. 

  

 9.8 _Rules of Construction_. The parties hereto agree that they have been represented by counsel during the negotiation and execution of this Agreement and, therefore, waive the application of any Law, regulation, holding or rule of construction providing that ambiguities in an agreement or other document will be construed against the party drafting such agreement or document. 

  

 9.9 _USA Patriot Act Compliance_. To help the government fight the funding of terrorism and money laundering activities, federal law requires all financial institutions to obtain, verify and record information that identifies each person who opens an account. For a non-individual person such as a business entity, a charity, a trust or other legal entity the Escrow Agent will ask for documentation to verify its formation and existence as a legal entity. The Escrow Agent may also ask to see financial statements, licenses, identification and authorization documents from individuals claiming authority to represent the entity or other relevant documentation. The parties hereto each agree to provide all such information and documentation as to themselves as requested by Escrow Agent to ensure compliance with federal law.
