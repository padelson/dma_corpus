in breach of its Obligations, then the Company may at any time and from time to time, at the
Company&#146;s option, take any and all actions available hereunder or under applicable Law to enforce
its rights thereunder and hereunder in respect of such Obligations. Subject to and in furtherance
of the foregoing, the Guarantor acknowledges and agrees that the Company may, in its sole
discretion, bring and prosecute a separate action or actions against the Guarantor to enforce its
