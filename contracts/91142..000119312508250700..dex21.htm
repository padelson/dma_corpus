AGREEMENTS

In consideration of the mutual covenants, representations, warranties and
agreements set forth herein, and intending to be legally bound, Parent,
MergerCo, the Company and SpinCo (solely for purposes of Sections 5.8, 5.11,
5.12, 5.16 and 5.18 and Article VII) hereby agree as follows:

ARTICLE I

THE MERGER

1.1 _The Merger_. Upon the terms and subject to the satisfaction or waiver of
the conditions set forth in this Agreement, at the Effective Time,
the Company and MergerCo shall consummate the Merger pursuant to which (a)
the Company shall be merged with and into MergerCo and the separate corporate
existence of the Company shall thereupon cease, (b) MergerCo shall be the
successor or surviving entity in the Merger (the " _Surviving Entity_ ") and
shall continue to be governed by the laws of the State of Delaware, and (c)
the separate existence of MergerCo with all its rights, privileges,
immunities, powers and franchises shall continue unaffected by the Merger.
The Merger shall have the effects specified in Chapter 92A of the NRS and
Section 18-209 of the DLLCA.

1.2 _Certificate of Formation and Operating Agreement_. The Certificate of
Formation of MergerCo as in effect at the Effective Time shall be and
constitute the Certificate of Formation of the Surviving Entity until amended
or changed in accordance with the DLLCA. The operating agreement of MergerCo
effective as of December 5, 2008 and as in effect at the Effective Time (the "
_Operating Agreement_ ") shall be and constitute the operating agreement of
the Surviving Entity until further amended or changed in accordance with the
DLLCA and its terms.

1.3 _Effective Time_. On the Closing Date, MergerCo and the Company shall
duly execute and file articles of merger (the " _Articles of Merger_ ") with
the Secretary of State of the State of Nevada in accordance with the NRS and a
certificate of merger (the " _Certificate of Merger_ ") with the Secretary of
State of the State of Delaware in accordance with the DLLCA. The Merger shall
become effective on the date and time of such filings or such later date and
time as Parent and the Company shall have agreed to and shall be specified in
the Articles of Merger and the Certificate of Merger (such date and time, the
" _Effective Time_ ").



 

2 1.4 _Closing_. The closing of the Merger (the " _Closing_ ") shall occur as
promptly as practicable (but in no event later than the third Business Day)
after all of the conditions set forth in Article VI (other than conditions
which by their terms are required to be satisfied or waived at the Closing)
shall have been satisfied or, if permissible, waived by the party entitled to
the benefit of the same, and, subject to the foregoing, shall take place at
such time and on a date to be specified by the parties (the " _Closing Date_
"). The Closing shall take place at the offices of Reinhart Boerner Van
Deuren s.c., 1000 North Water Street, Milwaukee, Wisconsin 53202, or at such
other place as agreed to by the parties hereto.

1.5 _Tax-Free Reorganization_. For federal income tax purposes, the Merger is
intended to constitute a reorganization within the meaning of Section 368(a)
of the Code and the Treasury Regulations promulgated thereunder. No party
shall take any reporting position with any taxing authority or any other
action that is inconsistent with the Merger constituting a reorganization
within the meaning of Section 368(a) of the Code and the Treasury Regulations
promulgated thereunder.

ARTICLE II

CONVERSION OF SECURITIES;

EXCHANGE OF CERTIFICATES

2.1 _Effect on Securities_. As of the Effective Time, by virtue of the Merger
and without any action on the part of Parent, MergerCo or the Company or the
holders of any of the following securities:

(a) Each MergerCo Membership Unit issued and outstanding immediately prior to
the Effective Time shall remain outstanding as one Surviving Entity
Membership Unit following the Merger.

(b) Each share of Company Common Stock that is owned by the Company, by any
wholly owned Subsidiary of the Company or by Parent, MergerCo or any other
wholly owned Subsidiary of Parent shall automatically be canceled and retired
and shall cease to exist, and no cash or other consideration shall be
delivered or deliverable in exchange therefor.

(c) Each share of Company Common Stock issued and outstanding immediately
prior to the Effective Time (other than shares to be canceled in accordance
with Section 2.1(b) and Dissenting Shares as described in Section 2.4) (the "
_Company Merger Stock_ ") shall be converted into the right to receive (i)
the number of shares of Parent Class A Common Stock equal to the Class A
Exchange Ratio, (ii) the number of shares of Parent Common Stock equal to the
Closing Common Exchange Ratio and (iii) the number of Escrow Shares equal to
the Per Share Escrow Release Number, if any, upon release thereof pursuant to
the Escrow Agreement (clause (i) and (ii), together with any cash paid in lieu
of fractional shares with respect thereto in accordance with Section 2.2(i),
the " _Closing Merger Consideration_ " and clause (iii), together with any
cash paid in lieu of fractional shares with respect thereto in accordance with
Section 2.2(i) and the Closing Merger Consideration, the " _Merger
Consideration_ "). Upon  



 

3  such conversion, all such shares of Company Merger Stock shall no longer be
outstanding and shall automatically be canceled and retired and shall cease
to exist, and each Company Certificate previously evidencing such shares
shall thereafter represent only the right to receive the Merger Consideration.
The holders of Company Certificates previously evidencing shares of Company
Merger Stock shall cease to have any rights with respect to the Company
Merger Stock except as otherwise provided herein or by Law and, upon the
surrender of Company Certificates in accordance with the provisions of Section
2.2, shall only represent the right to receive the Merger Consideration for
their shares of Company Merger Stock.

(d) The Exchange Agent shall make all computations contemplated by this
Section 2.1 of this Agreement and all such computations shall be conclusive
and binding on the holders of Company Common Stock absent manifest error in
any such computation.

2.2 _Exchange of Certificates_.

(a) Parent shall appoint an agent (the " _Exchange Agent_ ") reasonably
acceptable to the Company for the purpose of exchanging certificates which
immediately prior to the Effective Time evidenced shares of Company Merger
Stock (the " _Company Certificates_ ") for the applicable Closing Merger
Consideration pursuant to an exchange agent agreement in form and substance
reasonably satisfactory to the Company. At the Effective Time, Parent shall
deposit, or shall cause to be deposited, with the Exchange Agent, Parent
Certificates representing the Closing Merger Consideration to be exchanged or
paid in accordance with this Article II, and Parent shall make available from
time to time after the Effective Time as necessary, cash in an amount
sufficient to pay any cash payable in lieu of fractional shares with respect
to the Closing Merger Consideration pursuant to Section 2.2(i) and any
dividends or distributions to which holders of shares of Company Merger Stock
may be entitled pursuant to Section 2.2(c). Parent shall send, or shall cause
the Exchange Agent to send, to each holder of record of shares of Company
Merger Stock, promptly after the Effective Time, (i) a letter of transmittal
for use in such exchange (which shall be in form and substance reasonably
satisfactory to Parent and the Company and shall specify that the delivery
shall be effected, and risk of loss and title in respect of the Company
Certificates shall pass, only upon proper delivery of the Company
Certificates to the Exchange Agent) and (ii) instructions to effect the
surrender of the Company Certificates in exchange for the applicable Closing
Merger Consideration, cash payable in respect thereof in lieu of any
fractional shares pursuant to Section 2.2(i) and any dividends or other
distributions payable in respect thereof pursuant to Section 2.2(c).

(b) Each holder of shares of Company Merger Stock that have been converted
into a right to receive the Merger Consideration and any dividends or
other distributions payable in respect thereof pursuant to Section 2.2(c),
upon surrender to the Exchange Agent of a Company Certificate or Company
Certificates, together with a properly completed letter of transmittal
covering such shares and such other documents as the Exchange Agent may
reasonably require, shall be entitled to receive the applicable Merger
Consideration payable in respect of such shares of Company Merger Stock. The
holder of such Company Certificate, upon its delivery thereof to the Exchange
Agent, shall also receive any dividends or other distributions to which such
holder is entitled pursuant to Section 2.2(c) and cash payable in respect
thereof in lieu of any fractional shares pursuant to Section 2.2(i). Company
Certificates surrendered shall forthwith be canceled as of the Effective Time.
Until so surrendered, each such Company Certificate, following the Effective
Time, shall represent for all purposes only the right  



 

4  to receive the applicable Merger Consideration, cash payable in respect
thereof in lieu of any fractional shares pursuant to Section 2.2(i) and
any dividends or other distributions payable in respect thereof pursuant to
Section 2.2(c). No interest shall be paid or accrued for the benefit of
holders of the Company Certificates on cash amounts payable upon the surrender
of such Company Certificates pursuant to this Section 2.2.

(c) Whenever a dividend or other distribution is declared or made after the
date hereof with respect to Parent Class A Common Stock or Parent Common
Stock with a record date after the Effective Time, such declaration shall
include a dividend or other distribution in respect of all shares of Parent
Class A Common Stock or Parent Common Stock, as applicable, issuable pursuant
to this Agreement, including the Escrow Shares. No dividends or other
distributions declared or made after the Effective Time with respect to Parent
Class A Common Stock or Parent Common Stock with a record date after the
Effective Time shall be paid to the holder of any unsurrendered Company
Certificate with respect to the Parent Class A Common Stock and Parent Common
Stock such holder is entitled to receive until the holder of such Company
Certificate shall surrender such Company Certificate in accordance with the
provisions of this Section 2.2. Subject to applicable Law, following surrender
of any such Company Certificate, there shall be paid to the record holder of
the certificates representing Parent Class A Common Stock or Parent Common
Stock issued in exchange therefor, without interest, at the time of such
surrender, the amount of dividends or other distributions with a record date
after the Effective Time theretofore paid with respect to such Parent Class A
Common Stock or Parent Common Stock.

(d) In the event that a transfer of ownership of shares of Company Merger
Stock is not registered in the stock transfer books or ledger of the Company,
or if any certificate for the applicable Merger Consideration is to be issued
in a name other than that in which the Company Certificate surrendered in
exchange therefor is registered, it shall be a condition to the issuance
thereof that the Company Certificate or Company Certificates so surrendered
shall be properly endorsed or otherwise be in proper form for transfer and
that the Person requesting such exchange shall have paid to the Exchange Agent
any transfer or other Taxes required as a result of the issuance of a
certificate for Parent Class A Common Stock or Parent Common Stock in any
name other than that of the registered holder of such shares of Company
Merger Stock, or establish to the reasonable satisfaction of the Exchange
Agent that such Tax has been paid or is not payable.

(e) After the Effective Time, there shall be no further registration of
transfers of shares of Company Common Stock. If, after the Effective Time,
any Company Certificate formerly representing shares of Company Common Stock
is presented to the Surviving Entity, it shall be canceled and exchanged for
the applicable Merger Consideration provided for, and in accordance with the
procedures set forth, in this Article II.

(f) None of Parent, MergerCo, the Company or any of their respective
Subsidiaries or Affiliates shall be liable to any holder of shares of Company
Merger Stock for any Merger Consideration delivered to a public official
pursuant to any applicable abandoned property, escheat or similar Law.

(g) Each of the Exchange Agent, the Surviving Entity, Parent and the Escrow
Agent shall be entitled to deduct and withhold from the Merger
Consideration otherwise payable  



 

5  to any holder of shares of Company Merger Stock, and from any cash dividends
or other distributions that the holder is entitled to receive under Section
2.2(c), such amounts as the Exchange Agent, the Surviving Entity, Parent or
the Escrow Agent is required to deduct and withhold with respect to the making
of such payment under the Code, or any provision of U.S. federal, state or
local tax Law or any other non-U.S. tax Law or any other applicable
requirement of Law. The Surviving Entity and Parent hereby agree to, and to
use commercially reasonable efforts to cause the Exchange Agent and the Escrow
Agent to, remit any such amounts to the appropriate Governmental Authority.
To the extent that amounts are so withheld by the Exchange Agent, the
Surviving Entity, Parent or the Escrow Agent and remitted to the applicable
Governmental Authority, such amounts withheld from the Merger Consideration
and such other amounts payable under Section 2.2(c) shall be treated for all
purposes of this Agreement as having been received by the holder of the shares
of Company Merger Stock in respect of which such deduction and withholding
was made by the Exchange Agent, the Surviving Entity, Parent or the Escrow
Agent.

(h) Any portion of the certificates evidencing the Parent Class A Common
Stock, Parent Common Stock, the cash to be paid in respect of fractional
shares pursuant to Section 2.2(i), and the cash or other property in respect
of dividends or other distributions pursuant to Section 2.2(c) supplied to
the Exchange Agent which remains unclaimed by the holders of shares of Company
Merger Stock for a period of time longer than twelve months after the
Effective Time shall be returned to Parent, upon demand, and any such holder
who has not exchanged his shares of Company Merger Stock for the applicable
Merger Consideration in accordance with this Section 2.2 prior to the time of
demand shall thereafter look only to Parent for delivery of the
applicable Merger Consideration, and payment of any cash payable in respect
thereof in lieu of any fractional shares pursuant to Section 2.2(i) and any
dividends or distributions with respect to Parent Class A Common Stock and
Parent Common Stock to which they were entitled pursuant to Section 2.2(c),
in each case, without interest.

(i) No certificates representing a fractional share of Parent Class A Common
Stock or Parent Common Stock shall be issued in exchange for shares of Company
Merger Stock upon the surrender for exchange of a Company Certificate. In lieu
of any such fractional share, each holder of shares of Company Merger Stock
who would otherwise have been entitled to a fraction of a share of Parent
Class A Common Stock or Parent Common Stock upon surrender of Company
Certificates for exchange (or in the case of a lost, stolen or
destroyed certificate, upon delivery of an affidavit in the manner provided
in Section 2.2(j)) shall be paid upon such surrender (and after taking into
account and aggregating shares of Parent Class A Common Stock represented by
all Company Certificates surrendered by such holder and separately taking
into account and aggregating shares of Parent Common Stock represented by all
Company Certificates surrendered by such holder) cash (without interest) in an
amount equal to the product obtained by multiplying (a) the fractional share
interest of Parent Class A Common Stock or Parent Common Stock, as applicable,
to which such holder (after taking into account and aggregating all shares of
Parent Class A Common Stock or Parent Common Stock, as applicable,
represented by all Company Certificates surrendered by such holder) would
otherwise be entitled by (b) the Closing Market Price (it being understood
that such Closing Market Price shall also be used with respect to any
fractional share of Parent Class A Common Stock). In addition, in lieu of the
release of any fractional Escrow Share pursuant to the Escrow Agreement, each
holder of shares of Company Merger Stock who would otherwise have
been entitled to a fraction of an Escrow Share (and after taking into account
and aggregating any fractional Escrow Shares to  



 

6  which such holder would otherwise be entitled) shall be paid at such time as
the fractional Escrow Share would otherwise have been released to such
holder pursuant to the Escrow Agreement a cash payment (without interest)
from Parent in an amount equal to the product obtained by multiplying (a) the
fractional share interest of an Escrow Share (and after taking into account
and aggregating any fractional Escrow Shares to which such holder would
otherwise be entitled) to which such holder would otherwise be entitled by (b)
the Closing Market Price. Upon payment by Parent for any fractional Escrow
Share, such fractional Escrow Share shall be canceled and retired and shall
cease to exist.

(j) In the event any Company Certificates shall have been lost, stolen
or destroyed, the Exchange Agent shall issue in exchange for such lost,
stolen or destroyed Company Certificates, upon the making of an affidavit of
that fact by the holder thereof, the applicable Merger Consideration and any
dividends or other distributions as may be required pursuant to this Article

stolen or destroyed Company Certificates.

2.3 _Escrow_. Immediately prior to the Effective Time, the Shareholders
Representative and Parent shall enter into an escrow agreement substantially

escrow agent (the " _Escrow Agent_ ") reasonably acceptable to the Company and
Parent. At the Effective Time, Parent shall deposit, or shall cause to be
deposited, with the Escrow Agent, Parent Certificates or a book-entry in
Escrow Agents account representing the Escrow Shares. The Escrow Shares shall
be held and distributed pursuant to the Escrow Agreement. 

2.4 _Dissenters  Rights_.

(a) Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the contrary, any shares of
Company Common Stock (" _Dissenting Shares_ ") which are issued and
outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time and which are held
by stockholders of the Company who have filed with the Company, before the
taking of the vote of the stockholders of the Company to adopt and approve
this Agreement, written objections to such approval stating their intention to
demand payment for such shares of Company Common Stock if the Merger is
consummated, and who have not voted such shares of Company Common Stock in
favor of the adoption and approval of this Agreement and have otherwise
complied in all respects with the applicable provisions of Sections 92A.300
through 92A.500 of the NRS (the " _Dissenters  Rights Provisions_"), will not
be converted as described in Section 2.1, but will thereafter constitute only
the right to receive payment of the fair value of such shares of Company
Common Stock in accordance with the Dissenters Rights Provisions; _provided_
, _however_ , that all shares of Company Common Stock held by stockholders who
shall have failed to perfect or who effectively shall have withdrawn or lost
their rights to appraisal of such shares of Company Common Stock under the
Dissenters Rights Provisions shall thereupon be deemed to have been canceled
and retired and to have been converted, as of the Effective Time, into the
right to receive the Merger Consideration, without interest, in the manner
provided in Section 2.2. Persons who have perfected statutory rights with
respect to Dissenting Shares as aforesaid will not be paid the
Merger Consideration by the Surviving Entity as provided in this Agreement
and will have only such rights as are provided by the Dissenters Rights
Provisions with respect to such Dissenting Shares. Notwithstanding anything in
this Agreement to the contrary, if Parent, MergerCo or the Company abandon or
are finally enjoined or prevented from carrying out, or the stockholders
rescind their adoption and  



 

7  approval of, this Agreement, the right of each holder of Dissenting Shares
to receive the fair value of such Dissenting Shares in accordance with
the Dissenters Rights Provisions will terminate, effective as of the time of
such abandonment, injunction, prevention or rescission. The Company shall give
Parent and MergerCo prompt notice of any demands received by the Company for
the exercise of dissenters rights with respect to shares of Company Common
Stock and Parent shall have the right to participate in all negotiations and
proceedings with respect to such demands. The Company shall not, except with
the prior written consent of Parent (which shall not be unreasonably
withheld), make any payment with respect to, or settle or offer to settle, any
such demands.

(b) Each dissenting stockholder who becomes entitled under the Dissenters
Rights Provisions to payment for Dissenting Shares shall receive payment
therefor after the Effective Time from the Surviving Entity (but only after
the amount thereof shall have been agreed upon or finally determined pursuant
to the Dissenters Rights Provisions), and such shares of Company Common Stock
shall be canceled.

filed on Form 5500 with accompanying schedules and attachments, (iii) the

Benefit Plan that have been adopted or approved nor has the Company or any
Company Subsidiary adopted or approved any new Company Benefit Plan since
December 31, 2007. There are, and for the last six years have been, no other
ERISA Affiliates of the Company other than SpinCo and the Company
Subsidiaries.

(b) All Company Benefit Plans that are intended to be qualified under Section
401(a) of the Code are so qualified in form and operation and have been
determined by the IRS to be so qualified, or have filed on a timely basis
with the IRS to obtain a determination letter under Section 401(a) of the
Code, and, to the Knowledge of the Company, nothing has occurred that would
materially and adversely affect the qualification of any such plan. All of
the Company Benefit Plans and the related trusts comply with and have been
administered in compliance in all material respects with, as applicable, (i)
the provisions of ERISA, (ii) all provisions of the Code, (iii) all other
applicable Laws and (iv) their terms and the terms of any collective
bargaining, collective labor agreements, insurance and annuity contracts and

disputes under the terms of, or in connection with, the Company Benefit Plans
other than routine claims for benefits. There has not been any non-exempt
prohibited transaction (within the meaning of Section 406 of ERISA or Section
4975 of the Code) with respect to any Company Benefit Plan, fiduciary, party
in interest or disqualified personnel with respect thereto. No litigation has
been commenced with respect to any Company Benefit Plan and, to the Knowledge
of the Company, no such litigation is threatened (other than routine claims
for benefits). There are no governmental audits or investigations pending or,
to the Knowledge of the Company, threatened in connection with any Company
Benefit Plan. All contributions and other payments required to be made by the
Company or any Company Subsidiary to any Company Benefit Plan (or to any
person pursuant to the terms thereof) have been made on a timely basis and all
other contributions, payments and unfunded benefit liabilities have been
fully accrued in accordance with GAAP.

(c) Except as set forth in Section 4.11(c) of the Company Disclosure Schedule,

the Company or any Subsidiary of the Company beyond their retirement or other
termination of service, other than pursuant to Section 4980B of the Code; and

party stop-loss insurance policy with respect to the Company Benefit Plan, the
Company or the Subsidiary of the Company, as applicable, has complied with all
terms of the insurance policy and has timely paid all premiums owing with

contemplated by this Agreement will not cancel, impair or reduce amounts
payable under any such insurance policy except as would not reasonably be
expected to have a Company Material Adverse Effect.

(e) Except as set forth in Section 4.11(e) of the Company Disclosure
Schedule, the execution and delivery of this Agreement and the Ancillary
Agreements do not, and the consummation of the transactions contemplated
hereby and thereby will not (either alone or in combination with any other
event) (i) entitle current or former employees, directors, officers or
consultants of the Company or any Subsidiary of the Company to any additional
compensation, severance or other benefits, or (ii) accelerate the time of
payment or vesting or trigger any payment or funding (through a grantor trust
or otherwise) of compensation or benefits under, increase the amount payable
or trigger any other material obligation pursuant to, any Company Benefit
Plan. No payment or benefit which has been, will or may be made by the
Company or any Subsidiary of the Company with respect to any current or former
employee in connection with the execution and delivery of this Agreement or
the consummation of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement is
reasonably likely to result in a material amount of "excess parachute
payments" within the meaning of Section 280G(b)(1) of the Code.

(f) No Company Benefit Plan is a "multiemployer pension plan" (as such term is
defined in Section 3(37) of ERISA) (a "Multiemployer Plan") or a plan that has
two or more contributing sponsors at least two of whom are not under common
control, within the meaning of Section 4063 of ERISA (a "Multiple Employer
Plan"). Neither the Company, any Company Subsidiary nor any ERISA Affiliate
has within the past six years contributed to or been required to contribute
to any Multiemployer Plan or Multiple Employer Plan or has withdrawn from any
Multiemployer Plan where such withdrawal has resulted or would result in any
"withdrawal liability" (within the meaning of Section 4201 of ERISA) that has
not been fully paid.

(g) No Company Benefit Plan is an employee pension benefit plan that is
subject to Title IV of ERISA, or Section 302 of ERISA or Section 412 or 4971
of the Code.

Belvidere Property upon Parents request. SpinCo, the Company and Parent
understand and agree that Parents review and comment on any document and
Parents access to the Belvidere Property does not create or result in any

can take into account and be based upon the industrial use of the
Belvidere Property, institutional controls or other use restrictions so long
as the Closure Letter complies with Environmental Laws and any requirements of
any Governmental Authority exercising jurisdiction over the Belvidere RCRA
Issue. In the event the Illinois EPA or any other Governmental Authority
reopens or requests any additional work be performed on, at, under or about
the Belvidere Property in connection with the Belvidere RCRA Issue after

addressing all matters raised in the reopener and any other work that may be

Effective Time, _other than_ a Release related to the Belvidere RCRA Issue (a
" _New Belvidere Issue_ "), the Company (prior to the Spin-Off) or SpinCo
(after the Spin-Off) agrees to use commercially reasonable efforts to correct
such violation. To the extent reasonably required to comply with Environmental
Laws, SpinCo shall correct a New Belvidere Issue by enrolling the Belvidere
Property into the Illinois Site Remediation Program (" _SRP_ ") and
conducting such actions as shall be required to obtain from the Illinois EPA a
focused No Further Remediation Letter (" _NFR_ ") covering such New Belvidere

33  understands and agrees that the NFR can take into account and be based upon
the industrial use of the Belvidere Property, institutional controls or other
use restrictions so long as the NFR complies with Environmental Laws and any
requirements of Illinois EPA. In the event the Illinois EPA or any other
Governmental Authority reopens or requests any additional work be performed in
connection with the New Belvidere Issue after issuance of an NFR, SpinCo
shall be solely responsible for addressing all matters raised in the reopener
and any other work that may be required.

(d) If, upon termination of the Escrow Agreement, neither SpinCo nor the
Company has obtained the Closure Letter and/or neither SpinCo nor the Company
has obtained an NFR in connection with a New Belvidere Issue (if any), SpinCo
shall reserve an amount equal to 110% of the amount deemed sufficient, in the
reasonable opinion of a third party environmental consultant engaged by
Parent, after consultation with SpinCo, to fund such actions as are necessary
to obtain the Closure Letter and the NFR, as applicable. In addition, if,
immediately prior to the end of the Survival Period for SpinCos
indemnification obligations under Article VII of this Agreement, neither
SpinCo nor the Company has sold the Belvidere Property to a third party
reasonably acceptable to Parent, SpinCo shall provide such further assurances
to Parent as Parents general counsel shall reasonably request, after
consultation and cooperation with SpinCo, to address (i) any identified risks
of Releases of any Hazardous Substance on, in, under, or migrating from the
Belvidere Property, which Hazardous Substance was present on, in or under the
Belvidere Property at or prior to the Effective Time, and (ii) any other
matters on, in, under, or migrating from the Belvidere Property that would
reasonably be expected to result in liability to Parent or the Surviving
Entity under Environmental Laws.

policy then maintained by Parent that provides coverage to Parents directors
and officers.

(c) In the event Parent or the Surviving Entity (i) consolidates with or
merges into any other Person and shall not be the continuing or surviving
corporation or entity of such consolidation or merger or (ii) transfers all or

Company Subsidiaries or any of their respective Affiliates, directors,
officers or employees (other than Parent and its directors, officers and
employees). Parent shall control the defense of any Transaction-Related Claim
to the extent involving Parent or MergerCo or any of their respective

Transaction-Related Claim, and the Company (and, after the Effective Time,
SpinCo or the Shareholders Representative) desires to accept and agree to

Shareholders Representative) will give prompt written notice to the Parent

continue to contest or defend such Transaction-Related Claim and, in such
event, the maximum liability of the Company, SpinCo or any other Indemnifying
Person as to such Transaction-Related Claim (pursuant to the
indemnification provisions of Article VII or otherwise) will not exceed the
amount of such settlement offer, plus costs and expenses paid or incurred by
the Parent Party through the date such settlement offer is  



 

35  given to the Parent Party. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in

million (based on the Average Closing Market Price) and (y) all of the Escrow

to, at or after the Effective Time, to the extent resulting from or arising

respective business operations which occurred prior to the Effective Time;



 

39 (g) the exercise by any stockholder of the Company of dissenters rights
pursuant to Section 2.4 (it being agreed that the determination of any
Damages resulting therefrom shall take into account, to the extent applicable,
the benefit to Parent of not having to pay any such stockholder any Merger
Consideration that such stockholder otherwise would have been entitled to
receive in the Merger, with the value of the Merger Consideration being based
on the Average Closing Market Price);

(h) any rights to indemnification, reimbursement or compensation from the

Organizational Documents, Contracts or otherwise and whether or not related to
claims pending on, or asserted after, the Closing Date;

harmless the Parent Indemnified Parties from, against and in respect of all

resulting from or arising out of, directly or indirectly, any breach of any

7.2 _Indemnification by Parent_. From and after the Effective Time, subject to
the limitations set forth in this Article VII, the Former Company Shareholders
and each of their respective officers, directors, employees, owners and
agents and their respective successors and assigns (the " _Company Indemnified
Parties_ ") shall be indemnified, defended, protected and held harmless by
Parent from, against and in respect of all Damages suffered, sustained,
incurred or paid by the Company Indemnified Parties, whether prior to, at or
after the Effective Time, to the extent resulting from or arising out of,
directly or indirectly:

(a) any inaccuracy in or breach of any representation or warranty of Parent or
MergerCo set forth in this Agreement or any Ancillary Agreement to
which Parent or MergerCo is a party (other than the Non-Surviving
Representations and Warranties); or

(b) any breach of any covenant or agreement on the part of Parent or MergerCo
set forth in this Agreement.



 

40 7.3 _Survival; Right to Indemnification Not Affected by Knowledge_. The
representations, warranties, covenants and agreements of the Company, Parent
and MergerCo in this Agreement or in any Ancillary Agreement (other than, with

Section 7.1 or indemnification claims against Parent under Section 7.2 and (b)
for a period of two years after the Closing Date with respect to
indemnification claims under Section 7.1 from the Escrow Shares (either such
period, as applicable, a " _Survival Period_ ") and shall thereafter terminate
and be of no further force or effect; _provided_ ,  _however_ , that the
right to receive payment of Tax benefits described in Section 7.5(c) or 7.6(c)
shall survive indefinitely. No claims for indemnification may be made by any
Indemnified Person under Section 7.1 or Section 7.2 after the end of the
applicable Survival Period, _provided_ , _however_ , that a claim for
indemnification under Section 7.1 or Section 7.2 as to which a Claim Notice is
delivered in accordance with Section 7.4 during the applicable Survival
Period shall, with respect only to such claim, continue in force and effect
beyond the end of the Survival Period pending resolution of such claim. The
Non-Surviving Representations and Warranties shall not survive beyond
the Effective Time. The representations and warranties of any party, and the
right to indemnification for the breach of any such representations and
warranties, shall not be affected by any investigation conducted or knowledge
obtained by any other party, regardless of when such investigation was
conducted or such knowledge was obtained.

7.4 _Indemnification Procedures_. All claims or demands for indemnification
under Sections 7.1 and 7.2 shall be asserted and resolved as follows:

(a) As soon as is reasonably practicable after any Parent Indemnified Party
or Company Indemnified Party becomes aware of any claim, event or circumstance
(a " _Claim_ ") that has or might give rise to an indemnification obligation
under Section 7.1 or Section 7.2 of this Agreement, such Parent Indemnified
Party or Company Indemnified Party, as the case may be (an " _Indemnified
Person_ "), shall give written notice thereof (a " _Claim Notice_ ") to the
party or parties from which indemnification is sought (the " _Indemnifying
Persons_ "). The Claim Notice shall describe the Claim in reasonable detail
and shall indicate the amount (estimated if necessary and to the extent
feasible) of the Damages that have been or may be suffered by the Indemnified
Person. The failure of any Indemnified Person to promptly give the
Indemnifying Persons a Claim Notice shall not preclude such Indemnified Person
from obtaining indemnification under this Article VII, except to the extent,
and only to the extent, that such Indemnified Persons failure has actually
prejudiced the rights or increased the Damages and obligations of any of the
Indemnifying Persons hereunder.

(b) With respect to any Claim Notice relating to a Claim made by a third party
against an Indemnified Person (a " _Third Party Claim_ "), the Indemnifying
Person shall have the right upon written notice (a " _Control Notice_ ") to
the Indemnified Person within 30 days after receipt from the Indemnified
Person of the Claim Notice, to conduct at its expense with counsel reasonably
satisfactory to the Indemnified Person the defense against such Third Party
Claim in its own name or, if necessary, in the name of the Indemnified Person;
_provided_ , _however_ , that (i) the Indemnifying Person may only assume
control of such defense if the Indemnifying Person acknowledges in writing to
the Indemnified Person that any Damages that may be assessed against the
Indemnified Person in connection with such suit or proceeding constitute
Damages for which the Indemnified Person shall be indemnified pursuant to
this Article VII, and (ii) the  



 

41  Indemnifying Person may not assume control of the defense of a suit or
proceeding (A) involving criminal liability or (B) in which any relief
other than monetary damages is sought against the Indemnified Person. Except
for the matters set forth in Subsections (A) and (B) of the prior sentence for
which the consent of the Indemnifying Person is not required, the Indemnified
Person shall not settle a Third Party Claim without the prior written consent
of the Indemnifying Person (such consent not to be unreasonably withheld or
delayed). In the event that the Indemnifying Person delivers a Control Notice,
the Indemnified Person will cooperate with and make available to the
Indemnifying Person such assistance and materials as may be reasonably
requested by it, and the Indemnified Person shall have the right at its
expense to participate in the defense assisted by counsel of its own
choosing. Without the prior written consent of the Indemnified Person (such
consent not to be unreasonably withheld or delayed), the Indemnifying Person
will not enter into any settlement of any Third Party Claim or cease to defend
against such Third Party Claim; _provided_ , that the Indemnified Person may
withhold its consent in its sole discretion if pursuant to or as a result of
such settlement or cessation, (i) injunctive or other equitable relief would
be imposed against the Indemnified Person or (ii) such settlement or
cessation would lead to material liability or create any material financial or
other obligation on the part of the Indemnified Person for which the
Indemnified Person is not entitled to indemnification hereunder. The
Indemnified Persons may employ one separate counsel (and one local counsel in
each applicable jurisdiction) and the reasonable out-of-pocket fees and
expenses of such counsel shall be paid by the Indemnifying Persons if the
named parties to the Third Party Claim (including any impleaded parties)
include the Indemnified Person or Indemnified Persons, as applicable, and the
Indemnified Person or Indemnified Persons, as applicable, reasonably
determines that the Indemnified Person or Indemnified Persons, as applicable,
and the Indemnifying Person have conflicting interests or different defenses
available with respect to such Third Party Claim, _provided_ , that the
Indemnifying Persons shall not be required to pay the fees and expenses of
more than one counsel for all Indemnified Persons (and one local counsel in
each applicable jurisdiction) in connection with any one Third Party Claim or
related group of Third Party Claims. If an offer is made to settle a Third
Party Claim, which offer the Indemnifying Person is permitted to settle under
this Section 7.4(b) only upon the prior written consent of the Indemnified
Person, and the Indemnifying Person desires to accept and agree to such
offer, the Indemnifying Person will give prompt written notice to the
Indemnified Person to that effect. If the Indemnified Person does not consent
to such firm offer within twenty calendar days after its receipt of such
notice, the Indemnified Person may continue to contest or defend such Third
Party Claim and, in such event, the maximum liability of the Indemnifying
Person as to such Third Party Claim will not exceed the amount of such
settlement offer, plus costs and expenses paid or incurred by the Indemnified
Person through the date such settlement offer is given to the Indemnified
Person to the extent such amount is otherwise indemnifiable hereunder.

(c) Notwithstanding the provisions of Section 9.6, each Indemnifying Person
hereby consents to the nonexclusive jurisdiction of any court in which
a claim or cause of action in respect of a Third Party Claim is brought
against any Indemnified Person for purposes of any such claim that such
Indemnified Person may have against the Indemnifying Person under this
Agreement with respect to such Third Party Claim.

(d) In accordance with Section 7.8, the Shareholders Representative shall act
as nominee for the Former Company Shareholders with respect to any claim for
indemnification under Section 7.1 against the Escrow Shares, and any reference
in this Section 7.4 to an  



 

42  Indemnifying Person with respect to the indemnification procedures for a
Claim against the Escrow Shares shall mean the Shareholders Representative
in such capacity pursuant to Section 7.8.

7.5 _Limits on Indemnification; Calculation of Damages_.

(a) The sole and exclusive source of satisfaction and payment for any
indemnification claims made by any Parent Indemnified Parties against the
Former Company Shareholders pursuant to Section 7.1 shall be a claim against
the Escrow Shares pursuant to the Escrow Agreement, and the Former Company
Shareholders and the Shareholders Representative, individually or as a group,
shall not have any obligation, responsibility or personal liability for the
satisfaction and payment of any indemnification obligations hereunder. This
limitation on indemnification by the Former Company Shareholders shall not
serve as a limit on the indemnification obligations of SpinCo under this
Agreement. The indemnification obligations pursuant to Section 7.1(i) shall be
satisfied within ten Business Days after a final determination (within the
meaning of Section 1313(a) of the Code) of the relevant Tax is made. In
pursuing the collection of Damages pursuant to Section 7.1, the Parent
Indemnified Parties shall proceed first against SpinCo (including any escrow
established by SpinCo pursuant to Section 5.18) prior to pursuing any claim
against the Escrow Shares pursuant to the Escrow Agreement; _provided_ ,
_however_ , that if SpinCo has not satisfied all Damages for which payment is
due with respect to a Claim within 15 days after the earlier of (i) an
agreement among SpinCo, the Shareholders Representative and the applicable
Parent Indemnified Parties as to such Damages that are due with respect to a
Claim or (ii) a final judgment with no further right to appeal
has established the right of the applicable Parent Indemnified Parties to
such Damages, then the Parent Indemnified Parties may proceed against the
Escrow Shares pursuant to the Escrow Agreement to collect such Damages.

(b) The amount of any indemnifiable Damages under this Article VII shall be
calculated after giving effect to any amount received by the
applicable Indemnified Person with respect to the applicable Claim under any
insurance coverage or any indemnity, contribution or other similar payment
received by the Indemnified Person from any third party with respect thereto,
but net of any expenses incurred by such Indemnified Person in collecting
such amount. The Indemnified Persons shall use their respective commercially
reasonable efforts to collect any amounts available under any such insurance
coverage or right to indemnification, contribution or other similar payment.
If any Indemnified Person receives an amount with respect to any Claim under
insurance coverage or right to indemnification, contribution or other similar
payment at any time subsequent to its receipt of any indemnification recovery
hereunder with respect to the same Damages, then such Indemnified Person shall
promptly pay to the Indemnifying Person the amount by which the insurance,
indemnification, contribution or other payments _plus_ the amount of any
indemnification payments for the same Damages made hereunder exceeds the total
amount of Damages suffered or incurred by the Indemnified Person with respect
to the same facts or circumstances giving rise to the right to indemnification
under this Article VII.

(c) The amount of any indemnifiable Damages under this Article VII shall be
calculated after giving effect to any Tax benefit (through an actual
reduction of Taxes or refund of Taxes paid) resulting from the applicable
Claim, _provided_ , that no indemnifiable Damages shall be reduced prior to
the taxable period in which the Indemnified Person realizes such Tax benefit
and, if such Tax benefit will be realized in periods after the indemnification
payment is due,  



 

43  the Indemnifying Person shall be required to pay the full indemnification
amount subject to the Indemnified Persons obligation to pay the amount
of such Tax benefit when realized to the Indemnifying Person (or, with
respect to any Claim satisfied from the Escrow Shares, to the Shareholders
Representative for the account of the Former Company Shareholders). The
Indemnified Persons shall use their reasonable best efforts to maximize the
amount of any Tax benefits in connection with the applicable Claim.

(d) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary herein, the Parent Indemnified
Parties shall not have any right to indemnification for Damages pursuant to
Section 7.1 to the extent that any such Damages result from or arise out of,
directly or indirectly, (i) any financial information supplied by Parent or
MergerCo for inclusion in the Form S-4 or the Joint Proxy Statement/Prospectus
or (ii) any information of Parent or MergerCo incorporated by reference in the
Form S-4 or the Joint Proxy Statement/Prospectus.

(e) SpinCo hereby waives any right to (i) seek contribution or other payment
from the Company with respect to any Damages for which SpinCo is required to
indemnify the Parent Indemnified Parties pursuant to this Article VII or (ii)
bring a claim against the current or former directors of the Company as result
of Damages for which SpinCo is required to indemnify the Parent Indemnified
Parties pursuant to this Article VII.

7.6 _Certain Tax Procedures_.

(a) Parent shall prepare or cause to be prepared and file or cause to be filed
all Tax Returns for the Surviving Entity that are filed after the
Closing Date which relate to a Pre-Closing Tax Period. Parent shall permit
the Shareholders Representative to review any such Tax Return described in
the preceding sentence which relates to a Pre-Closing Tax Period prior to
filing and shall make such revisions to such Tax Returns as are reasonably
requested by the Shareholders Representative.

(b) Any Tax refunds of the Surviving Entity that are received by Parent or
any of its Subsidiaries, including the Surviving Entity that relate to any
Pre-Closing Tax Period shall be for the account of the Former Company
Shareholders, and Parent shall pay over to the Shareholders Representative
any such refund within 15 days after receipt or entitlement thereto.

(c) Parent shall pay to the Shareholders Representative for the account of
the Former Company Shareholders the amount of any Tax benefits actually
realized by Parent or any of its Subsidiaries, including the Surviving Entity,
from Tax Benefit Items when realized by Parent or any of its Subsidiaries,
including the Surviving Entity. For the purposes of this Section 7.6(c), the
amount of the Tax benefit attributable to Tax Benefit Items will be based upon
the difference between net income Taxes actually paid and the net
income Taxes which would have been paid without the benefit of the Tax
Benefit Items. Parent shall provide the Shareholders Representative with
copies of all calculations of actual Tax benefits attributable to Tax Benefit
Items reasonably requested by the Shareholders Representative.

(d) Parent and the Shareholders Representative shall cooperate, as and to the
extent reasonably requested by the other party, in connection with the filing
of Tax Returns pursuant to this Section 7.6 and any audit, litigation or other
proceeding with respect to Taxes. Such cooperation shall include the retention
and (upon the other partys request) the provision of  



 

44  records and information that are reasonably relevant to any such audit,
litigation or other proceeding and making employees available on a
mutually convenient basis to provide additional information and explanation
of any material provided hereunder. Neither Parent nor any Subsidiary of
Parent shall agree to settle or concede any audit, litigation or other
proceeding with a taxing authority with respect to any Pre-Closing Tax Period
without the prior written consent of the Shareholders Representative.

(e) A Tax benefit described in Section 7.5(c) or Section 7.6(c) shall be
treated as realized only to the extent that Parent or its Subsidiaries have
not, by the due date (including extensions) of the Tax Return for the last
period from which losses or credits can be carried back, generated a loss or
credit to offset the income or Tax giving rise to such potential Tax benefit.

7.7  _Exclusive Remedy_. Except for the remedies that cannot be waived as a
matter of Law, as provided in Section 9.13 or for claims based on fraud, from
and after the Effective Time, indemnification pursuant to this Article VII
will be the exclusive remedy for any breach of this Agreement (including any
representation, warranty, covenant and agreement contained in this Agreement).

7.8 _Shareholders  Representative_.

(a) Upon approval of the Merger and this Agreement by the holders of the
Company Common Stock under applicable Law, each of the Former Company
Shareholders will be deemed to have irrevocably appointed SpinCo, as its, his
or her true and lawful attorney-in-fact and agent (the " _Shareholders 
Representative_"), with full power of substitution or resubstitution, to act
solely and exclusively on behalf of such Former Company Shareholder with
regard to matters pertaining to (i) the indemnification by the Former Company
Shareholders referred to in this Article VII, including the power to
compromise any Claim on behalf of such Former Company Shareholder, and (ii)
all matters under the Escrow Agreement or relating to the Escrow Shares.

(b) The appointment of the Shareholders Representative shall be deemed
coupled with an interest and shall be irrevocable, and Parent and any
other Person may conclusively and absolutely rely, without inquiry, upon any
action of the Shareholders Representative in all matters referred to herein.
By their appointment of the Shareholders Representative, the Former Company
Shareholders thereby confirm all that the Shareholders Representative shall
do or cause to be done by virtue of its appointment as the representative of
the Former Company Shareholders hereunder. The Shareholders Representative
shall act for the Former Company Shareholders on all of the matters set forth
in this Article VII and the Escrow Agreement in the manner the Shareholders
Representative believes to be in the best interest of the Former Company
Shareholders and consistent with the obligations of the Former Company
Shareholders under this Article VII and the Escrow Agreement, but the
Shareholders Representative shall not be responsible to any Former Company
Shareholder for any damages which the Former Company Shareholders may suffer
by the performance (including any damages arising out of the Shareholders
Representatives negligence) of the Shareholders Representatives duties
hereunder, other than damages arising from willful violation of applicable
Law or willful misconduct in the performance of such duties hereunder. The
Shareholders Representative shall not have any duties or responsibilities
except those expressly set forth in this Agreement or the Escrow Agreement,
and no implied covenants, functions,  



 

45  responsibilities, duties or liabilities shall be read into this Agreement or
shall otherwise exist against the Shareholders Representative.
The Shareholders Representative shall pay all of the expenses incurred by
the Shareholders Representative in performing its duties hereunder. The
Shareholders Representative shall be entitled to rely, and shall be fully
protected in relying, upon any statements furnished to it by any Former
Company Shareholder or Parent, or any other evidence deemed by the
Shareholders Representative to be reliable, and the Shareholders
Representative shall be entitled to act on the advice of counsel selected by
it.

(c) The Shareholders Representative is an intended beneficiary of this
Section 7.8.

enforcement of any judgment resulting from any suit, action or proceeding, and
each party hereby irrevocably and unconditionally agrees that all claims in
respect to any such suit, action or proceeding may be heard and determined in
a Delaware Court. Each party hereby irrevocably and unconditionally waives, to
the fullest extent it may legally and effectively do so, (a) any objection
which it may now or hereafter have to the laying of venue of any suit, action

suit, action or proceeding in any such court, and (c) the right to object,
with respect to such suit, action or proceeding, that such court does not have
jurisdiction over such party. Each party irrevocably consents to service or
process in any manner permitted by law.

Persons or circumstances, shall not be affected thereby, and to such end, the
provisions of this Agreement are agreed to be severable.



 

61 9.9 _Counterparts_. This Agreement may be executed in two or more
