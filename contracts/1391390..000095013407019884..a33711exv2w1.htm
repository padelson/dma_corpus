During the preparation of the Company Closing Balance Sheet and the Company Closing Statement and the period of any dispute with respect thereto (including with respect to the calculation of the Company Closing Net Working Capital and Company Closing Cash Amount) and/or the Buyer Closing Balance Sheet and/or the Buyer Closing Statement (including with respect to the calculation of the Buyer Closing Net Working Capital set forth thereon), Buyer and Buyer Sub shall (A) provide Seller and its representatives with reasonable access during normal business hours to the books, records (including work papers, schedules, memoranda and other documents), facilities and employees of Buyer, Buyer Sub, the Company, their respective Subsidiaries and the Business for such purpose, and, without limiting the generality of the foregoing, make reasonably available its employees of any of the foregoing (including employees who are knowledgeable with respect to the matters to be set forth in the Company Closing Balance Sheet, Buyer Closing Balance Sheet, the Company Closing Statement, the Buyer Closing Statement and/or any of the calculations set forth on any of the foregoing and employees who were involved in the preparation of the materials described in clause (B) below) to provide explanations with respect to the materials described in clause (B) below and to assist in the review of the foregoing and any Notice of Disagreement, and otherwise 

   ##### 

  

   

in connection with the matters contemplated by this _Section 1E_ (including
any dispute relating to the Company Closing Balance Sheet, the Buyer Closing
Balance Sheet, the Company Closing Statement, the Buyer Closing Statement
and/or any of the calculations set forth on any of the foregoing) and (B)
provide Seller and its representatives as promptly as practicable following
the Closing Date (but in no event later than thirty (30) days after the
Closing Date) with normal year-end closing financial information for the
white paper and packaging and newsprint businesses of Seller and its
Subsidiaries for the period ending as of the Adjustment Calculation Time.
Each of Buyer and its post-Closing Subsidiaries, on the one hand, and Seller,
on the other hand, shall cooperate fully with the other and
its representatives in connection with the preparation and/or review of the
Company Closing Balance Sheet, Buyer Closing Balance Sheet, the Company
Closing Statement, the Buyer Closing Statement and the calculations set forth
on the foregoing statements and documents, including the provision on a
timely basis of all other information necessary or useful in connection with

Disagreement. 

   

 (ii) During the twenty (20) days immediately following the expiration of the ninety (90) day period specified in _Section 1E(i)_ above, Seller and Buyer shall each be permitted to review the working papers of the other party with respect to the preparation of the Company Closing Balance Sheet, the Company Closing Statement, the Buyer Closing Balance Sheet and the Buyer Closing Statement; _provided_ that any such partys access to and review of any working papers of the other partys independent public accountants under this  _Section 1E_ shall be subject to the execution and delivery by the reviewing party of a customary hold harmless letter in favor of the providing partys independent public accountants, if required by such accountants. The Company Closing Balance Sheet, Buyer Closing Balance Sheet, the Company Closing Statement and the Buyer Closing Statement and the resulting calculation of the Closing Purchase Price therefrom shall become final and binding upon the parties upon expiration of such twenty (20) day period unless Seller or Buyer (or both) provides written notice of its disagreement (each, a " _Notice of Disagreement_ ") to the other prior to such date. Any Notice of Disagreement shall (x) specify in reasonable detail the nature and amount of any disagreement so asserted, and (y) only include disagreements based on mathematical errors or based on the Company Closing Balance Sheet, Buyer Closing Balance Sheet, the Buyer Closing Statement and/or the Company Closing Statement not being prepared and/or the calculations of Company Closing Net Working Capital, Company Closing Cash Amount and Buyer Closing Net Working Capital reflected and/or derived therefrom not be calculated in accordance with this Agreement. If a timely Notice of Disagreement is received by any of Seller and/or Buyer, as applicable, then the Company Closing Balance Sheet, the Buyer Closing Balance Sheet, the Company Closing Statement and the Buyer Closing Statement, the calculations of Company Closing Net Working Capital, Company Closing Cash Amount and Buyer Closing Net Working Capital reflected and/or derived therefrom and the resulting calculation of Closing Purchase Price (as revised in accordance with clause (1) or (2) below) shall become final and binding upon the parties on the earlier of (1) the date Buyer and Seller resolve in writing any and all differences they have with respect to any and all matters specified in any and all Notice of Disagreements and (2) the date any and all matters properly in dispute are finally resolved in writing by the Accounting Firm. During the thirty (30) days immediately following the expiration of the twenty (20) day period specified in the first sentence of this _Section 1E(ii)_, Buyer and Seller shall seek in good faith to resolve in writing any differences which they may have with respect to any matter specified in such Notice of Disagreement, and all such discussions related thereto shall (unless otherwise agreed by Buyer and Seller in writing) be governed by Rule 408 of the Federal Rules of Evidence and any applicable similar state rule. 

   ##### 

  

   

 (iii) At the end of such thirty (30) day period specified in _Section 1E(ii)_, Buyer and Seller shall submit to Ernst and Young LLP or, if they cannot or will not serve, such other independent accounting firm as may be mutually agreed to by Buyer and Seller (the " _Accounting Firm_ ") for review and resolution of any and all matters (but only such matters) which remain in dispute and which were properly included in any Notice of Disagreement. Buyer and Seller shall instruct the Accounting Firm to, and the Accounting Firm shall, make a final determination of the items included in the Company Closing Balance Sheet, the Buyer Closing Balance Sheet, the Company Closing Statement and the Buyer Closing Statement (to the extent such amounts are in dispute) in accordance with the guidelines and procedures set forth in this Agreement.

The Buyer and Seller shall also instruct the Accounting Firm to, and the Accounting Firm shall, make its determination based solely on presentations by the Buyer and Seller which are in accordance with the guidelines and procedures set forth in this Agreement ( _i.e._ , not on the basis of an independent review). The Company Closing Balance Sheet, the Buyer Closing Balance Sheet, the Company Closing Statement and the Buyer Closing Statement, and the resulting calculation of Closing Purchase Price shall become final and binding on the parties hereto on the date the Accounting Firm delivers its final resolution in writing to Buyer and Seller (which final resolution shall be requested by the parties to be delivered not more than forty-five (45) days following submission of such disputed matters).

If the Estimated Closing Purchase Price is greater than the Closing Purchase Price as finally determined under this _Section 1E_ (such excess, the " _Excess Amount_ "), Seller shall, within five (5) Business Days after the Closing Purchase Price becomes final and binding on the parties under this _Section 1E_, make payment to Buyer of the Excess Amount by delivering to Buyer for cancellation certificates for a number of shares of Buyer Common Stock which, when multiplied by the Average Trading Price equals the Excess Amount. 

   

 (v) Buyer agrees that following the Closing it will not take any, or permit any of its Subsidiaries to take any, actions with respect to the accounting books, records, policies and procedures of Buyer and its Subsidiaries (including any member of the Paper Group or any of its Subsidiaries) that is intended to obstruct or prevent the preparation of the Company Closing Statement as provided in this _Section 1E_. The parties agree that, from and after the Closing, the provisions of this _Section 1E_ and the arbitration provisions contemplated hereby shall be the exclusive remedy and exclusive forum of the parties with respect to the matters that are or that may be addressed through the working capital adjustment contemplated hereby. 

   

 1F. _Adjustment to Buyer Common Stock Deliverable to Seller_. (i) Notwithstanding any provision herein to the contrary, if any payment by Buyer and/or Buyer Sub to Seller under this Agreement consisting of shares of Buyer Common Stock (e.g., _Section 1C(ii)_ and _Section 1E(iv)_) would result in Seller and its Affiliates (at the time of any such contemplated payment and calculated assuming the repurchase and cancellation by Buyer of all shares of Post-Closing Buyer Common for which Conversion Rights have been 

   ##### 

  

   

exercised) collectively holding more than 49.00% of the Post-Closing Buyer
Common, then (A) in lieu of delivering to Seller the portion of any
such payment consisting of the aggregate number of shares of Buyer Common
Stock which would result in Seller and its Affiliates (at the time of any
such contemplated payment and calculated assuming the repurchase and
cancellation by Buyer of all shares of Post-Closing Buyer Common for which
Conversion Rights have been exercised) collectively holding more than 49.00%
of Post-Closing Buyer Common (such number of shares of Buyer Common Stock that
would cause Buyer to hold more than 49.00% of the Buyer Post-Closing Common,
as determined by Seller in good faith, the " _Cash Pay Shares_ "), but
without limiting any other payment due to Seller, Buyer shall, within 5
Business Days following the date on which any such payment consisting of Cash
Pay Shares is otherwise required to be made hereunder, at its election,
either (1) pay to Seller an amount in cash equal to the product of (x)
the aggregate number of Cash Pay Shares and (y) the Average Trading Price
(such product, the " _Alternative Payment Amount_ ") or (2) deliver to Seller
an Acceptable Note in an aggregate principal amount equal to the Alternative
Payment Amount, and (B) Buyer shall deliver to Seller as and when due the
remaining portion of any such payment consisting of the aggregate number of
shares of Buyer Common Stock which are not converted into the right to
receive the cash payment contemplated by the foregoing clause (A) of this
_Section 1F(i)_ (e.g., other than the Cash Pay Shares). To the extent not
paid in cash or delivery of the Acceptable Note within such five (5) Business
Day period, interest shall accrue on the Alternative Payment Amount at a rate
per annum equal to the Acceptable Note Rate until such Alternative Payment
Amount, together with such accrued but unpaid interest, is paid in full to
Seller in accordance with the immediately foregoing sentence and, if paid in
cash, shall be paid together with such accrued but unpaid interest and, if
paid by delivery of the Acceptable Note, the "Alternative Payment Amount" for
purposes of determining the principal amount of such Acceptable Note shall be
increased by the accrued but unpaid interest on such Alternative Payment
Amount. For purposes of this Agreement, " _Post-Closing Buyer Common_ " means
the aggregate number of issued and outstanding shares of Buyer Common Stock
as of immediately after the Closing (taking into account the shares of Buyer
Common Stock issued to Seller under this Agreement at the Closing (as
the same may be adjusted pursuant to this _Section 1F_), but (x) excluding
any and all shares of Buyer Common Stock issued upon exercise of the Buyer
Warrants and any and all shares of Buyer Common Stock issued to any officers
or employees of Buyer and/or any of its post-Closing Affiliates and (y)
calculated assuming the repurchase and cancellation by Buyer of all shares of
Post-Closing Buyer Common for which Conversion Rights have been exercised). 

   

 (ii) When used herein, an " _Acceptable Note_ " means a transferable unsecured promissory note issued by Buyer and each of its Domestic Subsidiaries to Seller reflecting Buyers and such Domestic Subsidiaries joint and several obligation to pay the Alternative Payment Amount to Seller, together with interest thereon, and including the following terms and conditions: (A) Sellers rights to receive amounts pursuant to the Acceptable Note shall be contractually subordinated only to the principal and interest repayment obligations of Buyer and Buyer Sub with respect to the aggregate amount of debt financing raised at Closing, without any refinancing thereof, and such subordination provisions shall be in form and substance reasonably satisfactory to Seller; (B) Buyer and its Domestic Subsidiaries shall be entitled to prepay the Acceptable Note in whole or in part in cash at any time without penalty; (C) interest shall accrue on unpaid balances under the Acceptable Note at a rate per annum (the " _Acceptable Note Rate_ ") that is 200 basis points higher (and a default rate of interest that is 400 basis points higher) than 

   ##### 

  

   

the highest interest rate payable by Buyer and its Subsidiaries with respect
to the debt financing raised by Buyer and its Domestic Subsidiaries at
Closing in connection with the Closing and shall be paid quarterly in cash
(and, to the extent not so paid in cash in any quarter, will accrue
and compound); (D) all principal and other obligations outstanding under any
such Acceptable Note shall become immediately due and payable upon the
earliest to occur of (1) 181 days after the scheduled maturity of the latest
maturity date of the debt financing raised by Buyer and its Subsidiaries at
Closing, (2) upon any change-of-control (to be defined as mutually agreed) of
Buyer or Buyer Sub, (3) upon any refinancing of the debt
financing outstanding as of immediately after the Closing and (4) upon other
customary repayment events and events of default (including cross-defaults
under the Debt Financing agreements); and (E) other terms and provisions in
form and substance reasonably satisfactory to Buyer and Seller. 

   

 (iii) Promptly after Buyer and/or Buyer Sub have received Debt Commitment Letters executed by the counterparties thereto or have otherwise received the debt financing for the transactions contemplated hereby, at the request of either Buyer or Seller, the parties shall work together in good faith to develop a form of Acceptable Note that is consistent with this _Section 8F_ and otherwise reasonably satisfactory to each of them. Buyer and Buyer Sub shall be jointly and severally responsible for Buyers payment obligations under this _Section 1F_.

Subsidiaries is required to pay in respect of such credit cards or payment
cards (other than amounts that Seller or its Subsidiaries would reimburse in

After the Closing, to the extent permitted by such Available Insurance Policies, Seller shall, or shall cause its Affiliates to, permit and assist the members of the Paper Group to, in so far as is commercially practicable, submit such Covered Paper Group Claims for processing in accordance with the Available Insurance Policies to the same extent as the members of the Paper Group were entitled prior to the Closing. It is understood and agreed that Buyer shall be responsible for satisfying any deductibles, self-insured retentions and other retained amounts on insurance coverage with respect to such Covered Paper Group Claims. Seller and its Subsidiaries shall provide Buyer and the Paper Group with reasonable cooperation regarding the processing of each Covered Paper Group Claim.

After the Closing, Buyer shall, or shall cause its post-Closing Affiliates to, permit and assist Seller and its Affiliates to, in so far as is commercially practicable, submit such Covered Seller Claims for processing in accordance with the Transferred Policies to the same extent as such Persons were entitled prior to the Closing. It is understood and agreed that Seller shall be responsible for satisfying any deductibles, self-insured retentions and other retained amounts on insurance coverage with respect to such Covered Seller Claims. Buyer and its Subsidiaries shall provide Seller and Sellers Post-Closing Affiliates with reasonable cooperation regarding the processing of any Covered Seller Claim.

 3E. _Exclusive Transaction_.

To the extent such accounts receivable are included as part of Company Closing Net Working Capital and are paid to Seller or one of its post-Closing Affiliates after the Adjustment Calculation Time, Seller shall remit such cash to Buyer promptly (but in any event within 10 Business Days) after receipt thereof. To the extent that any such accounts receivable (including such accounts receivable generated from the Business) are not included in the computation of Company Closing Net Working Capital, (x) Seller and its post-Closing Affiliates shall retain all rights to such accounts receivable and be entitled to retain any cash received in respect thereof and (y) Buyer shall, and shall cause its Subsidiaries (including the Paper Group and their respective Subsidiaries) to, promptly (but in any event within 10 Business Days) after receipt thereof, pay over to Seller and its post-Closing Affiliates all amounts received or collected by Buyer or any of its Subsidiaries in respect of such accounts receivable.

 (iii) _Post-Closing Receivables_. To the extent that any cash or asset to be retained by Seller is not paid or distributed to Seller or its post-Closing Affiliates prior to Closing and, after the Closing, any amount is paid to or received by Buyer, any member of the Paper Group or any of their respective Subsidiaries in respect of such cash or other asset, Buyer shall, or shall cause the Paper Group or any of their respective Subsidiaries to, pay to Seller or its designee the amount so received. If the Closing occurs, all cash collected after the Adjustment Calculation Time from notes and accounts receivable of Buyer and its Subsidiaries generated after the Adjustment Calculation Time from the conduct of the Business after the Adjustment Calculation Time by the members of the Paper Group and their respective Subsidiaries shall belong to, and if received by Seller or any of its post-Closing Affiliates shall be received for the benefit and the account of, Buyer, and Seller shall, and shall cause its post-Closing Affiliates to, promptly (but in any event within 10 Business Days) after receipt thereof, transfer and remit to Buyer all such amounts received by or paid to Seller or any such Affiliate.

 (iv) _Certain Liabilities_. To the extent that, prior to the Adjustment Calculation Time, any check that was written by Seller or any of its Subsidiaries (including the members of the Paper Group and their respective Subsidiaries) has not cleared in respect of the Business, but the liability in respect thereof is not included in the computation of Company Closing Net Working Capital, then Seller shall pay to the payee thereof (or, to the extent paid by Buyer or one of its Subsidiaries (including, after the Closing, the Paper Group and its Subsidiaries) shall reimburse Buyer and its Subsidiaries for) the amount of such check so paid (in the case of reimbursement to Buyer for such check) or so owed (in the case of payment to the oblige of such check). Except as set forth in the immediately foregoing sentence, from and after the Closing, Buyer shall, and shall cause its Subsidiaries (including Buyer, the members of the Paper Group and their respective Subsidiaries) to, pay and perform when due or obligated, all Business Liabilities.

Shareholder Meeting not more than 25 days after mailing of the Proxy
Statement (without adjournment) and solicit proxies as promptly as reasonably
practicable in accordance with applicable law for the purpose of seeking
Buyer Shareholder Approval once the Proxy Statement has been cleared by the
SEC.

 (iii) Buyer agrees that the Proxy Statement will comply in all material respects with all of the requirements of the Exchange Act and Buyer shall use its reasonable best efforts to seek to ensure that the Proxy Statement will not contain any untrue statement of a material fact or omit to state any material fact required to be stated therein or necessary in order to make the statements therein, in light of the circumstances under which they were made, not misleading, except that no 

   ##### 

  

   

representation or warranty is made by Buyer with respect to information

Buyer shall promptly correct any information provided by it for use in the
Proxy Statement if and to the extent that such information becomes false or

 (iii) From and after such time as such Debt Commitment Letters have been obtained, Buyer will provide prompt written notice to Seller following its receipt of notification by any financing source under the Debt Commitment Letters or in connection with any substitute debt or other financing of such sources refusal or intended refusal to provide the financing described in the applicable Debt Commitment Letters and, in each case, the stated reasons therefor (if any) and shall use reasonable best efforts (including institution of suit) to require the counterparties to such Debt Commitment Letters to perform their obligations under the Debt Commitment Letters (including by the provision to Buyer and Buyer Sub of the financing contemplated by the Debt Commitment Letters when required thereby).

Buyer and Buyer Sub each agrees that the Phase I Reports and the information contained therein are subject to the

termination of this Agreement in accordance with its terms and shall be

Buyer and Buyer Sub shall be responsible for paying all such fees and

then confidential), and (iii) Seller and its Affiliates may disclose such
terms as required pursuant to the provisions of any agreement to which Seller
or any of its Affiliates is a party (including the Indenture and the Senior

Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in the Confidentiality Agreement, the obligations of Buyer and its Affiliates (excluding, for the avoidance of doubt Seller and its post-Closing Affiliates), financing sources, agents and representatives under the Confidentiality Agreement shall continue with respect to Confidential Information of Seller and its post-Closing Affiliates with respect to Sellers Other Businesses. During the two (2) year period immediately following the Closing (other than with respect to protected trade secrets, which shall be considered Confidential Information of the Buyer and Buyer Sub for so long as such trade secrets remain protected trade secrets under applicable law), all Confidential Information of the Business or the Paper Group and their Subsidiaries shall be deemed Confidential Information of Buyer and Buyer Sub and not of Seller or any of its post-Closing Affiliates and Seller and its post-Closing Affiliates shall keep such Confidential Information confidential and without the prior written consent of Buyer shall not use or disclose such Confidential Information in any manner whatsoever other than to the extent required by applicable law or regulation and/or as contemplated by or permitted under any Ancillary Agreement;  _provided_ that this sentence shall have no force and effect unless and until the Closing is consummated. Except as set forth in the immediately preceding sentence, all of the confidentiality provisions of the Confidentiality Agreement shall continue in full force and effect after the Closing and will survive any termination of this Agreement. In the event of any termination of this Agreement, the terms of the Confidentiality Agreement shall continue in full force and effect and unamended by this Agreement. 

   

 8D. _Notification_. Prior to the Closing, each of Buyer and Seller shall promptly notify the other parties hereto if such Person obtains knowledge that any of the representations and warranties in this Agreement and the Seller Disclosure Letter are not true and correct in all material respects, or if such Person obtains knowledge of any material errors in, or omissions from, the Seller Disclosure Letter. Promptly after the date hereof, Seller shall identify to Buyer (i) each reportable transaction (as such term is defined in Treasury Regulation Section 1.6011-4) occurring prior to the Closing and involving the Paper Group and its Subsidiaries for which their participation has been or will be required to be disclosed under Treasury Regulation Section 1.6011-4 and (ii) Support Obligations of Seller and its Subsidiaries in effect with respect to the Business. 

   

 8E. _Consents_. To the extent that any contract or permit is not by its terms assignable or requires the consent of a third party or Governmental Entity in connection with the transactions contemplated herein, the execution and delivery of this Agreement shall not constitute a transfer, contribution or assignment thereof, an attempted transfer, contribution or assignment thereof, or an agreement to effect such transfer, contribution or assignment, if such transfer, contribution or assignment, attempted transfer, contribution or assignment, or agreement would constitute a breach thereof. Prior to Closing, each of Buyer and Seller shall use reasonable best efforts to obtain consents of third parties and Governmental Entities in connection with the transactions contemplated hereby and all fees and expenses related to all third party consents and Governmental Entities in connection with the transactions contemplated hereby (including with respect to Shared Contracts) shall be paid by the parties in accordance with their Responsible Share Percentages (with it being understood and agreed that, unless   ##### 

  

  

  

one party agrees to bear the portion of the consent fee or expense in excess
thereof, any consent fee or expense in excess of $5,000 shall not be agreed
to without the consent of both parties); _provided_ further that Sellers
obligations pursuant to this sentence shall be deemed satisfied at the
Closing to the extent any such fees and expenses are deducted from the Equity
Value Amount (including through the calculation of Shared Expense Amount), in
which case Buyer and Buyer Sub shall be responsible for paying all such fees
and expenses. Buyer acknowledges that, without hereby waiving the condition
set forth in _Section 2A(v)_ of this Agreement, certain consents in
connection with the transactions contemplated hereby may not be obtained by
the parties prior to Closing and Seller and its Subsidiaries shall not be
obligated to transfer, contribute or assign (or cause to be transferred,
contributed or assigned), in whole or in part, any contract, permit or other
asset to Buyer or any member of the Paper Group until such time as all
consents of any Person or Governmental Entity necessary for the legal transfer
and/or assumption thereof are obtained or delivered. If the transfer, sale or
assignment of any contract, permit or other asset intended to be transferred,
contributed or assigned hereunder, in whole or in part, is not consummated at
the Closing, then Seller and its Subsidiaries shall, unless otherwise agreed
in writing by Buyer, thereafter hold such contract, permit or other asset for
the use and benefit, insofar as commercially reasonably practicable and to
the extent it may lawfully do so, of Buyer (at Buyers expense), but only to
the extent of the portion of such contract, permit or other asset that is to
be transferred, contributed or assigned in accordance with this Agreement.
In addition, to the extent permitted by law and to the extent otherwise
permissible in light of the terms of such contract, permit or other asset,
Seller and its Subsidiaries retaining such contract, permit or other asset
shall take such other actions in order to place Buyer and the Paper
Group, after the Closing, insofar as commercially reasonably practicable and
to the extent it may lawfully do so, in the same position as if such
contract, permit or other asset had been transferred, contributed or assigned
as contemplated hereby and so that all the benefits and burdens relating
to such contract, permit or other asset, including possession, use, risk of
loss, potential for gain, and dominion, control and command over such asset,
are to inure from and after the Closing Date to Buyer and the Paper Group. To
the extent permitted by law and to the extent otherwise permissible in light
of the terms of such contract, permit or other asset, Buyer shall be entitled
to, and shall be responsible for, the management and the benefits and burdens
of any contract, permit, or other asset not yet transferred, contributed or
assigned to them as a result of a consent of another Person or Governmental
Entity having not yet been obtained. Each of the parties hereto agrees that
until a contract, permit or other asset is transferred, contributed, or
assigned to Buyer, Buyer shall indemnify and hold harmless Seller and its
Subsidiaries from such liabilities as though such contract, permit or other
asset had been transferred, contributed or assigned at the Closing. If any
consent necessary for the transfer, contribution or assignment of a
contract, permit or other asset is obtained after the Closing, the transfer,
contribution and/or assumption of the applicable contract, permit or other
asset shall be promptly effected in accordance with the terms of this
Agreement, without payment of additional consideration. 

   

 8F. _Reasonable Best Efforts_. Subject to the terms of this Agreement (including the limitations set forth in _Section 8E_ and this _Section 8F_), each of Buyer, Buyer Sub, Seller and the members of the Paper Group shall use its reasonable best efforts to cause the Closing to occur. The "reasonable best efforts" of the parties hereto shall not require any party or any of its Subsidiaries, Affiliates or representatives to expend any money to remedy any breach of any representation or warranty hereunder, to commence any litigation or arbitration proceeding, to offer or grant any material accommodation (financial or otherwise) or pay any material consent fee to any third party, to provide seller financing for the transactions contemplated hereby or to obtain any consent or approval from a Governmental Entity or other Person required for the transactions contemplated hereby (other than, with respect to Buyer and Buyer Sub, the Buyer Shareholder Approval); _provided_ that if (i) Seller or any of its Subsidiaries or Affiliates elects to remedy any breach of any of Sellers and/or the Paper Groups representations and warranties prior to Closing, neither Seller nor any member of the Paper Group shall be deemed to be in breach of such representation or warranty for purposes of determining Buyers and Buyer Subs obligations to consummate the transactions contemplated hereby pursuant to _Section 2B_ and (ii) Buyer or   ##### 

  

  

  

any of its Subsidiaries or Affiliates elects to remedy any breach of any of
Buyers and/or Buyer Subs representations and warranties prior to Closing,
neither Buyer nor Buyer Sub shall be deemed to be in breach of such
representation or warranty for purposes of determining Sellers and the Paper
Groups obligations to consummate the transactions contemplated hereby
pursuant to  _Section 2C_. 

   

 8G. _Regulatory Act Compliance_. Buyer and Seller shall each file or cause to be filed promptly following the date hereof (but in any event within thirty (30) days after date hereof), any notifications or the like required to be filed under the HSR Act and other anti-competition laws with respect to the transactions contemplated hereby. With respect to filings under the HSR Act, each of Buyer and Seller shall seek early termination of the waiting period under the HSR Act. Buyer and Seller shall use their respective reasonable best efforts to respond to any requests for additional information made by any agencies and to cause the waiting periods or other requirements under the HSR Act and all other applicable anti-competition laws to terminate or expire at the earliest possible date and to resist in good faith, at each of their respective cost and expense (including the institution or defense of legal proceedings), any assertion that the transactions contemplated hereby constitute a violation of the antitrust laws, all to the end of expediting consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby. Each of Buyer and the Seller shall consult with the other prior to any meetings, by telephone or in person, with the staff of the Federal Trade Commission, the United States Department of Justice or any other regulatory agency, and each of Buyer and Seller shall have the right to have a representative present at any such meeting. Each of Buyer and Seller shall promptly notify the other after becoming aware of any foreign antitrust or similar approval is required for consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby. Buyer and Seller shall each pay their Responsible Share Percentage of the filing fees for any filings under the HSR Act and pay such fees as they become due and payable; _provided_ that Sellers obligations pursuant to this sentence shall be deemed satisfied at the Closing to the extent any such fees and expenses are deducted from the Equity Value Amount (including through the calculation of Shared Expense Amount), in which case Buyer and Buyer Sub shall be responsible for paying all such fees and expenses. If a party pays an amount in excess of what it is required to pay pursuant to the foregoing sentence, it shall be entitled to reimbursement from the other party of such other partys share. 

   

 8H. _Further Assurances_. From time to time, as and when requested by any party, each party shall execute and deliver, or cause to be executed and delivered, all such documents and instruments and shall take, or cause to be taken, all such further or other actions, as such other party may reasonably deem necessary or desirable to consummate the transactions contemplated by this Agreement on the terms herein described. 

   

 8I. _Tax Matters_. 

    

 (i) Notwithstanding any other provision of this Agreement, with respect to any and all Transfer Taxes arising out of or in connection with the transactions effected pursuant to this Agreement, (a) the party charged by law with the duty of filing Tax Returns and making other filings shall do so in accordance with such laws and (b) each of Buyer and Seller shall pay their Responsible Share Percentages of such Transfer Taxes as they become due and payable; _provided_ that Sellers obligations pursuant to this sentence shall be deemed satisfied at the Closing to the extent any such fees and expenses are deducted from the Equity Value Amount (including through the calculation of Shared Expense Amount), in which case Buyer and Buyer Sub shall be responsible for paying all such fees and expenses. 

   

 (ii) From and after the Closing Date, Buyer and its Affiliates (including the members of the Paper Group) may amend any Tax Return previously filed with respect to the Business or any member of the Paper Group or its Subsidiaries for any Tax period ending on or prior to the Closing (i) to the extent such Tax Return is with respect to any entity that was at the time of filing 

   ##### 

  

   

such Tax Return and at the Closing treated as a C-corporation for U.S. federal
income tax purposes and (ii) in any other circumstance provided that the
filing of any such amended Tax Return shall not cause or result in any
increased liability for Taxes on the part of Seller or any owner (whether
direct or indirect) of Seller or any of Sellers Affiliates unless Seller
consents in writing (not to be unreasonably withheld where the
increased liability is not material); _provided_ , _however_ , that in no
event may Buyer or its Affiliates (excluding, for the avoidance of doubt,
Seller) amend any Income Tax Return of Seller or any owner (whether direct or
indirect) of Seller or any of Sellers Affiliates. 

   

 (iii) Buyer and Seller shall allocate the Estimated Closing Purchase Price in accordance with Section 1060 of the Code among the assets of Paper Group (including the capital stock and other equity interests of the members of the Paper Group and their respective Subsidiaries) based on an allocation delivered by Seller to Buyer at least 10 days prior to Closing and reasonably agreed upon by Buyer (the " _Allocation_ "). For purposes of the Allocation, the Estimated Closing Purchase Price shall mean an amount equal to the Estimated Closing Purchase Price plus any liabilities of the members of the Paper Group that are treated as assumed liabilities for U.S. federal income Tax purposes. To the extent that the Estimated Closing Purchase Price is adjusted after the Closing Date pursuant to _Section 1F_, Seller and Buyer shall revise and amend the Allocation in accordance with the character of each such adjustment. Seller and Buyer agree to prepare and file an IRS Form 8594 or such other form or statement as may be required by applicable law, rule or regulation, and any comparable state or local income Tax form, in a manner consistent with the Allocation. Seller and Buyer shall adhere to the Allocation for all purposes including any Tax Return filed by them after the Closing Date, including the determination by the Seller of taxable gain or loss on the sale of the Paper Group and its Subsidiaries and the determination by the Buyer of its Tax basis with respect to Paper Group and its Subsidiaries. Neither Buyer nor the Seller shall file any Tax Returns or, in a judicial or administrative proceeding, assert or maintain any Tax reporting position that is inconsistent with this Agreement or the Allocation, unless required to do so by applicable law. 

   

 (iv) From and after the Closing, Buyer shall not, and shall cause the members of the Paper Group and their respective Subsidiaries not to, make any election under Section 338 of the Code with respect to any member of the Paper Group and/or any of its Subsidiaries if such election would give rise to any liability to Seller or any of its Affiliates, including any Tax liability or any liability under this Agreement. 

  

 8J. _Employee Benefits Matters_. 

    

 (i) Effective as of immediately prior to the Closing, Seller shall terminate (or cause to be terminated) the employment of all Eligible Employees, other than employees receiving long-term disability benefits. Effective as of Closing or, with respect to any Eligible Employee with a right to reemployment under applicable law or a Collective Bargaining Agreement assumed by Buyer or its Subsidiary, at such time subsequent to Closing that such Eligible Employees present themselves to Buyer for employment, Buyer shall, or shall cause one of its Affiliates to, offer employment to each Eligible Employee (other than Eligible Employees receiving long-term disability benefits) on terms and conditions substantially comparable in the aggregate to those such employees had with Seller and its Subsidiaries immediately prior to the Closing. With respect to such Eligible Employees who are covered by a Collective Bargaining Agreement (collectively, " _Union Employees_ ") the terms of such offer shall be in accordance with the terms of the respective Collective Bargaining Agreements in effect as of the time such offer is made, and Buyer shall (or cause its Affiliates to, as appropriate) otherwise assume and thereafter be bound by and comply with each Collective Bargaining Agreement presently applying to the 

   ##### 

  

   

Union Employees and as may be amended from time to time, and such employees
shall be credited with their period of service with Seller, its Subsidiaries
(including Subsidiaries of any member of the Paper Group) and their
respective predecessors for purposes of the Collective Bargaining Agreements.
Each Eligible Employee who accepts Buyers offer of employment is referred to
herein as a " _Transferred Employee_." Notwithstanding the foregoing, Buyer
shall be under no obligation to enter into new individual
severance agreements with any Eligible Employee nor to match the terms of any
existing individual severance agreement after such agreement otherwise
expires in accordance with its terms. 

   

 (ii) Subject to Buyers compliance with _Section 8J(i)_ and _Section 8J(v)_ of this Agreement, Seller shall be solely responsible for any severance, change in control payments or parachute payments owed to Business Employees which are payable solely as a result of the consummation of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement pursuant to the terms of any agreements, plans or programs entered into or sponsored by Seller or any of its Subsidiaries prior to the Closing with any such Business Employees, except to the extent any such amounts are accrued for as a current liability in the computation Company Closing Net Working Capital. 

   

 (iii) Except as otherwise provided in this _Section 8J_, Buyer shall assume and become solely responsible for all employment and employee benefit-related matters, obligations, liabilities and commitments of Seller and its Subsidiaries with respect to all Business Employees and their dependents and beneficiaries (regardless of when or where such matters, obligations, liabilities and commitments arose or arise or were or are incurred), under or with respect to any Employee Benefit Plan sponsored or contributed to by Seller or a Business Subsidiary. Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, effective as of the Closing Date, (A) Buyer shall assume all obligations, liabilities and commitments of Seller and its Business Subsidiaries arising from workers compensation claims, whether characterized as medical or indemnity, or arising under any other similar government-mandated programs which are based on injuries incurred by Business Employees in the course of their employment, without regard to the date of occurrence of the injury or injuries giving rise to the workers compensation claim and (B) all obligations, liabilities and commitments of Seller and its Business Subsidiaries to Business Employees and their eligible dependents in respect of health insurance under COBRA, the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996 (" _HIPAA_ "), Sections 601 et seq. and Sections 701 et seq. of ERISA, Section 4980B and Sections 9801 et seq. of the Code and applicable state or similar laws. 

   

 (iv) Prior to the earlier of Closing or December 31, 2007, Seller shall make reasonable best efforts to review and amend, to the extent deemed necessary and permitted under the terms of any applicable Employee Benefit Plan, each Employee Benefit Plan or arrangement subject to section 409A of the Code to comply in all material respects with the final regulations under Section 409A of the Code. 

   

 (v) If any Salaried / Nonunion Employee or any Subsidiary Employee that is not a Union Employee (each, a " _Nonunion Employee_ ") is terminated without cause at any time within two years after the Closing, Buyer shall, or shall cause of its Affiliates to, pay severance pay to such employee that is at least as much as the maximum cash severance such employee would have received under the applicable severance pay plan of Seller as in effect as of the Closing Date (based on such employees salary immediately prior to the Closing Date or, if greater, such employees salary as of the date of termination) and aggregate service (taking service recognized under Sellers severance programs and post-Closing service with Buyer into account) as of the date of termination, and such other amount as may be required under applicable law. For purposes of this _Section 8J(v)_, "severance pay plan" does not include any individual severance 

   ##### 

  

   

agreements. In addition, Buyer hereby agrees that, for at least one year
following the Closing Date, Buyer will provide, or cause one of its
Affiliates to provide, to the Nonunion Employees compensation and employee
benefits that are in the aggregate substantially comparable to the
compensation and employee benefits provided to such employees
immediately prior to the Closing Date. 

   

 (vi) Buyer agrees that from and after the Closing Date, Buyer will, or will cause one of its Affiliates to, grant to all Transferred Employees and all Subsidiary Employees credit for any service with Seller, its Affiliates (including any member of the Paper Group and/or any of its Subsidiaries) and its predecessors earned prior to the Closing Date for purposes of (A) eligibility and vesting and (B) post-Closing paid time off accrual and determination of severance amounts under any benefit plan, program or arrangement established or maintained by Buyer or its Affiliates (the " _New Plans_ "). In addition, Buyer hereby agrees that Buyer and its Affiliates (x) shall waive and cause its Affiliates to waive for Transferred Employees and Subsidiary Employees all pre-existing condition exclusion and actively-at-work requirements and similar limitations, eligibility waiting periods and evidence of insurability requirements under any New Plans that are Employee Welfare Benefit Plans, and (y) shall cause any deductibles, co-insurance and out-of-pocket covered expenses incurred on or before the Closing Date by any Transferred Employee or Subsidiary Employee (or dependent or beneficiary thereof) to be taken into account for purposes of satisfying applicable deductible, coinsurance and maximum out-of-pocket provisions after the Closing Date under any New Plan that is an Employee Welfare Benefit Plan. Prior to the Closing, Seller shall cause its employees to provide all cooperation reasonably necessary for Buyer to establish any New Plans prior to Closing. 

   

 (vii) As of the Closing Date, Buyer shall assume and pay, or cause one of its Affiliates to assume and pay, when due, all liabilities and obligations of the Seller and its Affiliates relating to accrued paid time off of Transferred Employees and Subsidiary Employees to the extent such liabilities are not required by law or applicable Collective Bargaining Agreements to be paid out by Seller or such Affiliate as of the Closing Date. The respective Transferred Employee or Subsidiary Employee shall be entitled to either use such paid time off on terms substantially similar to those in effect under the applicable Collective Bargaining Agreement or paid time off policy of Seller or any of its Affiliates (including any member of the Paper Group and/or any of its Subsidiaries) as of the Closing Date, or, consistent with such applicable Collective Bargaining Agreement or paid time off policy, receive payment in respect of such accrued paid time off upon the Transferred Employees or Subsidiary Employees termination of employment with Buyer or any of its Affiliates. 

   

 (viii) Prior to the Closing Date, Seller shall establish 401(k) plans that mirror in all material respects the Savings Plan and the Retirement Savings Plan currently sponsored by Seller, (collectively, the " _Seller 401(k) Plans_ "). The 401(k) plans established by Seller pursuant to the immediately foregoing sentence are herein referred to as the " _Spun-off 401(k) Plans_." On the Closing Date, Seller shall assign to Buyer, and Buyer shall assume from Seller, sponsorship of such Spun-off 401(k) Plans. Effective as of the Closing Date, the Transferred Employees shall cease to participate in the Seller 401(k) Plans, and effective as of the Closing Date, Buyer shall provide to the Transferred Employees the right to participate in the Spun-off 401(k) Plans. As soon as is reasonably practicable following the Closing Date, Seller shall cause the trustee of the Seller 401(k) Plan to transfer the account balances of the Business Employees (including any outstanding loans) from the Seller 401(k) Plan to the Spun-off 401(k) Plan in accordance with the requirements of Code §§ 411(d)(6) and 414(l). Seller and Buyer shall use reasonable best efforts to effect such transfer of assets in a timely manner.

International Falls Pension Plan and the Boise Cascade, L.L.C. Pension Plan P and all liabilities and obligations arising thereunder or related thereto. Prior to the Closing Date, Seller shall spin off (within the meaning of Section 1.414(l)-1(n) of the Treasury Regulations) from each Seller Pension Plan that portion of each plan attributable to Business Employees (such plans the " _Spun-off Pension Plans_ "). Each of the Spun-off Pension Plans will be a mirror plan of each respective Seller Pension Plan in all material respects and Seller will not amend such plans other than is necessary to affect the spin-off. The spin-off from Seller Pension Plans, and the calculation of assets and liabilities under Seller Pension Plans, shall be accomplished by Seller with respect to the Business Employees in accordance with Section 414(l) of the Code. Effective as of the Closing Date, Seller shall assign to Buyer, and Buyer shall assume from Seller, sponsorship of such Spun-off Pension Plans and all liabilities and obligations arising thereunder or related thereto. Buyer shall take all actions necessary to satisfy requests of the Pension Benefit Guaranty Corporation, including the posting of bonds, letters of credit or other collateral, with respect to the Buyers assumption of the plans as described in this _Section 8J(viii)_. 

   

 (x) Effective as of the Closing, Buyer shall create, for Business Employees, plans (the " _Buyer s Supplemental Pension Plans_") that in the aggregate are substantially comparable to Sellers Supplemental Pension Plan and Sellers Supplemental Early Retirement Plan (collectively, the " _Seller s Supplemental Pension Plans_"), with substantial comparability to be determined after giving effect to amendments to Sellers Supplemental Pension Plans to comply with Section 409A). For purposes of determining benefits under the Buyers Supplemental Pension Plans, Buyer shall provide participants in the Buyers Supplemental Pension Plans with a past service credit reflecting such participants service for Seller and its Affiliates (including any member of the Paper Group and/or any of its Subsidiaries) and their respective predecessors, provided that any benefit accrued under the Buyers Supplemental Pension Plans shall not duplicate any benefit accrued under the Sellers Supplemental Pension Plans (which pursuant to this _Section 8J(x)_, will be assumed and satisfied by Buyer). From and after the Closing, Buyer shall assume and fully satisfy all obligations that exist as of the Closing Date under Sellers Supplemental Pension Plans with respect to Business Employees. 

   

 (xi) Effective as of the Closing Date, Buyer shall adopt a flexible benefit plan for the benefit of Business Employees that participate under Sellers flexible benefit plan (" _Business Flexible Benefit Plan_ "). The Business Flexible Benefit Plan shall be responsible for reimbursement of eligible health-care and dependent-care expenses incurred during the year in which the Closing occurs by Business Employees (and their respective spouses and eligible dependents), to the extent such expenses have not previously been reimbursed under Sellers flexible benefit plan. Similarly, on and after the Closing Date, Buyers health reimbursement account plan shall be responsible for reimbursement of eligible medical expenses incurred on or after January 1, 2007 by Business Employees (and their respective spouses and eligible dependents), to the extent such expenses have not previously been reimbursed under Sellers health reimbursement account plan. 

   

 (xii) Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, Seller shall (or shall cause one of its Affiliates to) retain all liability under (A) the management equity program of Forest Product Holdings, L.L.C. and (B) the Boise Cascade, L.L.C. 2004 Deferred Compensation Plan (and the deferred compensation agreements thereunder). 

   

 (xiii) Without limiting the other provisions of this _Section 8J_, Buyer shall assume Sellers liabilities and obligations to provide post-employment welfare benefit coverage to Business Employees who retired on or after October 29, 2004 or who have not yet retired, in accordance with all applicable collective bargaining agreements and Sellers post-employment welfare benefit plans; provided, however, that Buyer shall have the right (subject to applicable collective bargaining agreements) to modify or terminate such benefits at any time. 

   ##### 

  

  

 8K. _Facility Closings; Employee Layoffs_. For a period of ninety (90) days after the Closing Date, none of the Buyer, Buyer Sub, or any of their respective Subsidiaries (including any member of the Paper Group or any of its Subsidiaries) shall terminate Transferred Employees or Subsidiary Employees in such numbers as would trigger any liability for Seller and/or any of its Affiliates under the Worker Adjustment and Retraining Notification Act of 1988, 29 U.S.C. § 2101, et seq., as amended, or any similar foreign, state or local law, regulation or ordinance (collectively, " _WARN_ "). Buyer and Buyer Sub shall, and shall cause each member of the Paper Group and its Subsidiaries to, comply with any and all applicable notice or filing requirements under WARN. Provided that on or before the Closing Date, Seller has provided Buyer with a list of employee layoffs, by date and location, implemented by Seller in the 90-day period preceding the Closing Date, Buyer shall indemnify, defend and hold harmless Seller and its Affiliates from any and all WARN obligations or liabilities of Seller and/or any of its Affiliates arising as a result, in whole or in part, of actions taken by Buyer or its Affiliates on or after the Closing Date.

 (i) The indemnification provisions of each member of the Paper Groups and its Subsidiaries constitutive documents as in effect at the Closing shall not be amended, repealed or otherwise modified for a period of six (6) years from the Closing Date in any manner that would adversely affect the rights thereunder of individuals who at the Closing were directors, officers or employees of any such Person and/or the Business;  _provided_ , that all rights to indemnification in respect of any action pending or asserted or any claim made within such period shall continue until the disposition of such action or resolution of such claim. From and after the Closing, Buyer and Buyer Sub shall each assume, be jointly and severally liable for, and honor, guaranty and stand surety for, and shall cause the members of the Paper Group (and each of their Subsidiaries) to honor, in accordance with their respective terms, each of the covenants contained in this _Section 8M_.

 8N. _Expenses_. Except as otherwise provided in this Agreement, each of Buyer and Buyer Sub, on the one hand, and Seller, on the other hand, shall be solely responsible for payment of any fees and expenses incurred by it or its Affiliates in connection with the transactions contemplated hereby or otherwise required by applicable law. 

   

 8O. _Support Obligations_. 

    

 (i) Buyer recognizes that Seller and certain of its Affiliates have provided credit support to the Paper Group, their Subsidiaries and the Business and may have to (but shall not be obligated to) provide other credit support in connection with the transactions contemplated by this Agreement (collectively, the " _Support Obligations_ "). Buyer shall use reasonable best efforts to effect the full and unconditional release of Seller and its Affiliates from all Support Obligations, including by the issuance, to the beneficiaries thereof, in sufficient amount of letters of credit, guaranties, cash collateral and/or other credit support as would reasonably be expected to cause the release of the Support Obligations. 

   

 (ii) In connection with replacement of such Support Obligation by Buyer, Buyer and Seller shall cooperate to cause the beneficiary or beneficiaries of the Support Obligations to terminate and redeliver to Seller or its Affiliates, as applicable, as soon as practicable, each original copy of each original guaranty, letter of credit or other instrument constituting or evidencing such Support Obligations as well as to redeliver to Seller and its Affiliates, any cash collateral in respect of the Support Obligations and, as to any Support Obligations terminated after the Closing, promptly to redeliver such originals or cash to Seller or its Affiliates, as applicable, and in each case, to take such other actions as may be required to terminate such Support Obligations. 

   

 (iii) If Buyer is not successful in obtaining the complete and unconditional release of Seller and its Affiliates from the Support Obligations prior to the Closing, then Buyer shall continue to try to obtain such release after Closing and shall indemnify, defend and hold harmless Seller and its Affiliates from and against any and all Losses incurred by any such indemnified Persons in connection with the Support Obligations. Buyer shall, for so long as any Support Obligation remains outstanding, not, and shall cause each member of the Paper Group and their respective Subsidiaries not to, effect any amendments or modifications or any other changes to the contracts, guaranties or letters of credit to which any of such Support Obligations relate, or otherwise take any action that would effect any change to such contracts, guaranties or letters of credit, without Sellers prior written consent.

Buyer and Buyer Sub agree to take such actions such that any assignment, sale, transfer or conveyance in contravention of the preceding sentence shall be null and void _ab initio_. Buyer and Buyer Sub agrees to provide Seller with a copy of such assignment and assumption agreement prior to execution and prior to the assignment, sale, transfer or conveyance and a copy of the executed assignment and assumption agreement which shall be in the same form with such changes as Seller may reasonably request. Upon such an assignment, sale, transfer or conveyance pursuant to which the transferee assumes all of Buyers and Buyer Subs rights and obligations under this Agreement, Buyer and Buyer Sub shall have no further rights or obligations under this Agreement (except for obligations relating to breaches by Buyer and/or Buyer Sub occurring prior to the date of the assignment, sale, transfer or conveyance).

Business and one or more of Sellers Other Businesses (such contracts,
understandings and arrangements being collectively referred to herein as "
_Shared Contracts_ "). Buyer acknowledges and agrees that such Shared
Contracts shall be addressed by the parties as set forth in this _Section
8T_. 

   

 (ii) _Section 8T(ii)_ of the Seller Disclosure Letter (as amended after the date hereof with the agreement of Buyer and Seller) sets forth certain material Shared Contracts under which, except as set forth in the Ancillary Agreements, Buyer, the members of the Paper Group (and their Subsidiaries) and the Business shall cease to have any rights or obligations from and after the Closing.

 (iii) _Section 8T(iii)_ of the Seller Disclosure Letter (as amended after the date hereof with the agreement of Buyer and Seller) sets forth certain material Shared Contracts under which both the Business and Sellers Other Businesses perform obligations, have liabilities and/or receive benefits (the " _Ongoing Shared Contracts_ ").

 (iv) To the extent that a split contract with respect to such Ongoing Shared Contract is not obtained prior to Closing, then from and after the Closing until such Ongoing Shared Contract expires or is terminated, to the extent permitted by law and, unless waived by Seller, to the extent otherwise permissible in light of the terms of such Ongoing Shared Contract, then Seller shall cause Sellers Other Businesses and Buyer shall cause Buyer Sub, the members of the Paper Group, each of their respective Subsidiaries and the Business to perform obligations under each such Ongoing Shared Contract to which it is a party or bound and Seller and Buyer shall cooperate with each other and use reasonable best efforts such that the applicable members of the Paper Group and their Subsidiaries shall perform the obligations under, and receive the benefits of, such Ongoing Shared Contracts, in each case in the manner set forth on _Section 8T(iv)_ of the Seller Disclosure Letter (as amended after the date hereof with the consent of Buyer and Seller) or otherwise in a manner that as nearly as practicable approximates the obligations and benefits of the Business and Sellers Other Businesses with respect to such Ongoing Shared Contract during the term of the Ongoing Shared Contract prior to Closing. In the event that, after the Closing, Buyer performs its obligations under an Ongoing Shared Contract that has not been split and Seller or one of its Subsidiaries receives benefits under such Ongoing Shared Contract that are attributable to the operations of the Business after the Closing Date, Seller shall pay over such 

   ##### 

  

    

benefits to Buyer. In the event that, after the Closing, Seller performs
its obligations under an Ongoing Shared Contract that has not been split and
Buyer or one of its Subsidiaries receives benefits that are attributable to
the operation of one of Sellers Other Businesses after Closing, Buyer shall
pay over such benefits to Seller. Each of Buyer and Seller shall indemnify
the other for Losses such party or its Affiliates suffer as a result of any
breach of any Ongoing Shared Contract by such party. 

   

 (v) Buyer and Seller agree that, from and after the Closing, such party shall not, and shall cause its Affiliates not to, amend, waive, settle or compromise any material matter or claim related to any Ongoing Shared Contract without the prior written consent of the other. For all purposes of this _Section 8T_, upon an effective split of an Ongoing Shared Contract that each of Buyer and Seller has agreed to, such Ongoing Shared Contract shall be deemed terminated for purposes of this _Section 8T_. 

  

 8U. _Other Matters_.

 8W. _Conversion Rights_. Buyer shall take such action such that each issued and outstanding share of Buyer Common Stock that is held by a Person who has not voted in favor of the Purchase and Sale Transaction and who, in accordance with the Buyer Charter Documents, has exercised and not withdrawn his, her or its right to convert his, her or its share of Buyer Common Stock into cash upon consummation of the Purchase and Sale Transaction shall be paid from the Trust Fund the portion of the Trust Fund to which such holder is entitled, as determined in accordance with the Buyer Charter Documents or from Buyer to the extent any such amounts are distributed to Buyer; it being acknowledged and agreed that, to the extent any such amounts are distributed to Buyer, such amounts shall be held in trust by Buyer for the benefit of Persons validly exercising any such Conversion Rights.

to herein as " _Conversion Rights_." Buyer shall take such actions within its
control and not in contravention of the Buyer Charter Documents or applicable
law such that shares of Buyer Common Stock in respect of which Conversion
Rights have been exercised shall from and after the Closing represent only
the right to receive the portion of the Trust Fund to which such holder
is entitled, as determined in accordance with the Buyer Charter Documents,
and upon payment of any such amounts, Buyer shall cause such shares of Buyer
Common Stock to be canceled and no longer outstanding. 

   

 8X. _Noncompetition._ From and after the Closing, in consideration of the mutual covenants provided for herein but subject to the limitations set forth in the last sentence of this  _Section 8X_, during the period beginning on the Closing Date and ending on the earlier of the third anniversary of the Closing Date and, with respect to any Restricted Person, the date that a person or group of related persons (other than Madison Dearborn Capital Partners IV, L.P. or an Affiliate thereof) owns or acquires (directly or indirectly) equity securities of such Restricted Person that represent more than 50% of the ordinary voting power entitled to vote in the election of such Restricted Persons board of directors or managers (as applicable), Seller shall not, and shall cause its Subsidiaries (each a " _Restricted Person_ " and, collectively, the " _Restricted Persons_ ") not to, directly or indirectly, build and operate any greenfield plants for the production of uncoated free sheet paper or corrugated container board, anywhere within the United States; _provided_ that no Restricted Person shall be deemed to be taking an action in violation of this _Section 8X_ by virtue of its or their (w) engaging in Sellers Other Businesses or activities reasonably related thereto, (x) ownership of Buyer Common Stock as a result of the Purchase and Sale Transaction, (y) ownership of less than 5% of the outstanding stock of any publicly-traded corporation, or (z) acquisition of any Person (whether by asset purchase, stock purchase, merger or otherwise) engaged in a business that competes with the Business. The parties hereto agree that the covenant set forth in _Section 8X_ is reasonable with respect to its duration, geographical area and scope. If the final judgment of a court of competent jurisdiction declares that any term or provision of _Section 8X_ is invalid or unenforceable, the parties agree that the court making the determination of invalidity or unenforceability shall have the power to reduce the scope, duration or area of the term or provision, to delete specific words or phrases, or to replace any invalid or unenforceable term or provision with a term or provision that is valid and enforceable and that comes closest to expressing the intention of the invalid or unenforceable term or provision, and this Agreement shall be enforceable as so modified after the expiration of the time within which the judgment may be appealed.

 9C. _Assignment_. This Agreement and all of the provisions hereof shall be binding upon and inure to the benefit of the parties hereto and their respective heirs, successors and permitted assigns; _provided_ that neither this Agreement nor any of the rights, interests or obligations hereunder shall be assigned (including by operation of law) by any party hereto without the prior written consent of the other parties. Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, (i) Buyer acknowledges and agrees that Seller may from time to time assign, without the consent of any other party hereto, all or any portion of its rights, interests and/or obligations under this Agreement to a purchaser of assets of any division of Seller (however structured, including through the direct or indirect sale of equity securities or assets of Seller or one or more Subsidiaries) as long as the agreement by which any obligations of Seller hereunder are assumed are by such purchaser in a written instrument that includes Buyer as a third-party beneficiary thereof with respect to the obligations under this Agreement, (ii) each of the parties hereto acknowledges and agrees that any party hereto may cause any of its Affiliates to perform on its behalf any of such partys agreements and obligations hereunder and such performance by any of such partys Affiliates shall be deemed to have satisfied such partys obligations hereunder to perform such agreements and/or discharge such obligations (as applicable) and (iii) each party hereto may, without the consent of any other party hereto, assign in whole or in part its rights under this Agreement for collateral security purposes to such partys financing sources. 

   

 9D. _Severability_. Whenever possible, each provision of this Agreement shall be interpreted in such manner as to be effective and valid under applicable law, but if any provision of this Agreement is held by a court of competent jurisdiction to be prohibited by or unenforceable under applicable law, such provision shall be ineffective only to the extent of such prohibition or unenforceability, without invalidating the remainder of such provisions or the remaining provisions of this Agreement and such court shall have the authority to modify such unenforceable provision to the extent necessary to render it enforceable, preserving to the fullest extent permissible the intent of the parties. Notwithstanding the foregoing, to the extent that a representation or warranty of any party contained in this Agreement or the Seller Disclosure Letter (each, a " _Representation_ ") addresses a particular issue with specificity (a " _Specific Representation_ "), and no breach by such party exists under such Specific Representation, such party shall not be deemed to be in breach of any other Representation 

    ##### 

  

    

(with respect to such issue) that addresses such issue with less specificity
than the Specific Representation and if such Specific Representation is
qualified or limited by such partys knowledge, or in any other manner, no
other Representation shall supercede or limit such qualification in any
manner. Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, no
representation or warranty regarding or relating to (i) Tax matters is being
made, except as set forth in  _Section 4I_, (ii) employee benefit matters is
being made, except as set forth in _Section 4N_ , and (iii) environmental
matters is being made, except as set forth in _Section 4R_.

 9F. _Captions_. The captions used in this Agreement and descriptions of the Seller Disclosure Letter are for convenience of reference only and do not constitute a part of this Agreement and shall not be deemed to limit, characterize or in any way affect any provision of this Agreement, and all provisions of this Agreement shall be enforced and construed as if no caption or description of the Seller Disclosure Letter had been used in this Agreement. 

   

 9G. _Complete Agreement_. Except for the Confidentiality Agreement, this Agreement and the Ancillary Agreements contain the complete agreement between the parties and supersede any prior understandings, agreements or representations by or among the parties, written or oral, which may have related to the subject matter hereof in any way. 

   

 9H. _Seller Disclosure Letter_. 

    

 (i) The disclosures in the Seller Disclosure Letter are to be taken as relating to the representations and warranties of the Paper Group and their respective Subsidiaries as a whole, notwithstanding the fact that the Seller Disclosure Letter is arranged by sections corresponding to the sections in this Agreement or that a particular section of this Agreement makes reference to a specific section of the Seller Disclosure Letter and notwithstanding that a particular representation and warranty may not make a reference to the Seller Disclosure Letter.

In addition, matters reflected in the Seller Disclosure Letter are not necessarily limited to matters required by this Agreement to be reflected in the Seller Disclosure Letter. Such additional matters are set forth for informational purposes only and do not necessarily include other matters of a similar nature.

Further, neither the specification of any item or matter in any representation, warranty or covenant contained in this Agreement nor the inclusion of any specific item in the Seller Disclosure Letter is intended to imply that such item or matter, or other items or matters, are or are not in the ordinary course of business, and no party shall use the fact of setting forth or the inclusion of any such items or matter in any dispute or controversy between the parties as to whether any obligation, item or matter not described herein or included in the Seller Disclosure Letter is or is not in the ordinary course of business for purposes of this Agreement. 

   ##### 

  

   

 (ii) Prior to the Closing, Seller shall have the right from time to time to supplement, modify or update the Seller Disclosure Letter with respect to the representations and warranties in _Articles 4_ and _5_ hereof for matters first arising after the date of this Agreement or, with respect to representations and warranties qualified by Sellers knowledge (or similar knowledge qualifications), for matters of which the Seller first obtains knowledge after the date hereof, to ensure the correctness thereof. Any such supplements, modifications and updates shall not be deemed made for purposes of determining satisfaction of the condition to Closing in _Section 2B(i)_ hereof. From and after the Closing, references to the Seller Disclosure Letter shall be references to the Seller Disclosure Letter as so supplemented, modified and/or updated. 

   

 (iii) Prior to the Closing, the Buyer shall have the right, by written notice to Seller, to provide written notice of any updates or changes with respect to the representations and warranties in _Article 6_ hereof for matters first arising after the date of this Agreement or, with respect to representations and warranties qualified by the Buyers knowledge, for matters of which Buyer first obtains knowledge after the date hereof, to ensure the correctness thereof. Any such supplements, modifications and updates shall not be deemed made for purposes of determining satisfaction of the condition to Closing in _Section 2C(i)_ hereof. From and after the Closing, references to the representations and warranties made in _Article 6_ shall be deemed qualified by the matters addressed in any such written notice. 

   

 (iv) Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, Seller may update _Section 8J(i)_ of the Seller Disclosure Letter and _Section 8J(ii)_ of the Seller Disclosure Letter from time to time to reflect departures, new hires, and as otherwise agreed between Buyer and Seller.
