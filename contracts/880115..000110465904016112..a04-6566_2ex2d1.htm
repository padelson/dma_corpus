Company Capital Stock, in which case Parent shall instruct, assuming all
other conditions set forth in Sections 6.1 or 6.2 are satisfied or waived,

may extend the date by which it must give such instruction to the date when
such funds are available, but in no event later than May 21, 2004. In the

## 5.9 _Indemnification and Insurance_.

  

## 

  

### (a) For six years after the Effective Time, Parent shall indemnify,
defend and hold harmless to the fullest extent permitted by law the present
and former officers and directors of the Company or any Material Subsidiary
against all losses, claims, damages, fines, penalties and liability in
respect of acts or omissions occurring at or prior to the Effective Time
including amounts paid in settlement or compromise with the approval of
Parent (not to be unreasonably withheld or delayed); provided, however, in
the event any claim or claims are made or asserted within such six year
period, all rights to indemnification in respect of any such claim or claims
shall continue until the disposition thereof; and provided further, however,
no officer or director of the Company will be entitled to any indemnification
from Parent with respect to any action or matter (i) related to an action
taken deliberately which, if known by Parent, would have resulted in the
representations and warranties set forth in Article 3 of the Agreement
to have been false or misleading to the extent that the condition described
in Section 6.2(a), other than the provision thereof related to the
certificate signed by a Responsible Officer of the Company, would not have
been satisfied, as determined by final nonappealable judgment of a court of
competent jurisdiction (it being understood that the payment of expenses
incurred by a director or officer in advance of the final disposition of the
proceeding shall be paid by Parent, but only upon receipt of an undertaking
by the director or officer to repay all amounts advanced if it should be
ultimately determined that the director of officer is not entitled to be
indemnified under Section 5.9(a)) and (ii) asserted by any Person owning
Company Capital Stock or any equity owner in any Material Subsidiary
immediately prior to the Effective Time. Notwithstanding the foregoing,
Parent and Merger Sub agree that all rights to indemnification, exculpation
and advancement now existing in favor of any current or former officers or
directors of the Company or any Material Subsidiary, as provided in the
Companys or such Material Subsidiarys respective charter, bylaws
or partnership agreement (or similar organizational documents) shall survive
the Merger as obligations of the Surviving Corporation or applicable
Material Subsidiary and shall continue in full force and effect in accordance
with their terms and without amendment thereof.

  

### 

  

### (b) From and after the Effective Time, Parent shall cause to be
maintained in effect for not less than six years from the Effective Time the
current policies of the directors and officers liability insurance
maintained by the Company; provided, however, that: (i) Parent may substitute
therefor policies of at least the same coverage containing terms and
conditions which are no less advantageous; (ii) such substitution shall not
result in gaps or lapses in coverage with respect to matters occurring prior
to the Effective Time; and (iii) Parent shall not be required to pay an
annual premium in excess of 200% of the last annual premium paid by the
Company prior to the date hereof and if Parent is unable to obtain
the insurance required by this Section 5.9(b) it shall obtain as
much comparable insurance as possible for an annual premium equal to such
maximum amount.

  

### 

  

### (c) Following the Merger, if the Parent or any of its successors or
assigns (i) consolidates with or merges into any other Person and shall not
be the continuing or surviving corporation or entity of such consolidation or
merger, or (ii) transfers or conveys all or substantially all of its
properties and assets to any Person or Persons, then, and in each such case,
proper provision shall be made so that the successors and assigns of Parent
and any of their

  

###

### 

  

### successors and assigns, assume the obligations of the Parties, Parent and
the Surviving Corporation set forth in this Section 5.9.

### (d) This Section 5.9 shall survive the consummation of the Merger at the
Effective Time, is intended to benefit the Surviving Corporation and the
current and former officers and directors of the Company or any Material
Subsidiary and their respective heirs and representatives (each of whom may
enforce the provisions of this Section 5.9) and shall be binding on the
successors and assigns of Parent and the Surviving Corporation.

  

### 

  

## 5.10 _Stockholder Litigation_. The Company shall give Parent the
reasonable opportunity to participate in the defense or settlement of any
stockholder litigation against the Company and/or its directors relating to

unreasonably withheld or delayed.

  

## 

  

## 5.11 _Opinion of Financial Advisor_. A true, correct and complete copy of

to any liabilities related to the Spin-Off Assets and Liabilities and such

liabilities.  The other terms and conditions of the transfer of the Spin-Off
Assets and Liabilities

## 35

Company or any Subsidiary of the Company releasing such directors and
officers from any and all liabilities and claims, known or unknown, with
respect to acts or omissions of such Persons taken or failed to have been

Parent fails to provide to the Exchange Agent all of the cash comprising the
Merger Consideration as contemplated by Section 2.5(a) on or before May 21,
2004 solely because the funds contemplated by the financing commitment

nonavailability is due to the conditions set forth in such commitment

under the Companys Hedging Transactions on terms acceptable to Parent) and

covenants or agreements, or satisfaction of any of the conditions, contained
herein. Any agreement on the part of a Party to any such extension or waiver
shall be valid only if set forth in a written instrument signed by an
authorized representative of such Party. Except as provided in

## this Agreement, no action taken pursuant to this Agreement, including
any investigation by or on behalf of any Party, shall be deemed to constitute
a waiver by the Party taking such action of compliance with any
representations, warranties, covenants or agreements contained in this
Agreement. The waiver by any Party of a breach of any provision hereof shall
not operate or be construed as a waiver of any prior or subsequent breach of
the same or any other provisions hereof.

  

## 

  

## 8.11 _Confidentiality Agreement_. The Confidentiality Agreement shall
remain in full force and effect following the execution of this Agreement;
provided, however, that any standstill provisions contained therein are
hereby waived to the extent necessary for the Parties to consummate the
Merger in accordance with the terms of this Agreement.

  

## 

  

## 8.12 _Incorporation_. Exhibits and Schedules referred to herein are
attached hereto and by this reference incorporated herein for all purposes.

  

## 

  

## 8.13 _Specific Performance_. The parties recognize that in the event any
party should refuse to perform under the provisions of this Agreement,
monetary damages alone will not be adequate. Except as provided in Sections
7.3 and 7.4, the non-breaching party(ies) shall therefore be entitled, in
addition to any other remedies which may be available, including money
damages, to obtain specific performance of the terms of this Agreement. In
the event of any action to enforce this Agreement specifically, each party
hereby waives the defense that there is an adequate remedy at law.

  

## 

  

IN WITNESS WHEREOF, the Parties have caused this Agreement to be executed by
their duly authorized representatives, on the date first written above.
