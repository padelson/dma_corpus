Election.   (i) An election form ("Election Form"), together with the
other  transmittal materials described in Section 2.5, shall be mailed as
soon as  reasonably practicable but no later than five (5) Business Days

the  "Mailing Date." Each Election Form shall provide that a holder (or the 
beneficial owner through appropriate and customary documentation and 
instruction) of Company Shares will receive the Per Share Mixed 
Consideration with respect to all of such holder\'s Company Shares, unless 
such holder (or the beneficial owner through appropriate and customary 
documentation and instruction) elects to receive the Per Share Cash 
Consideration or the Per Share Stock Consideration with respect to all of 
such holder\'s Company Shares. Company Shares as to which no election of  Per
Share Stock Consideration or Per Share Cash Consideration is made  shall be

which the Per Share Cash Consideration election is made shall be  referred to
as the "Cash Election Shares"; and Company Shares as to which  the Per Share

Election Shares". The "Cash Election Amount" shall be equal to  the Per Share

plus the amount of the Per Share Mixed Consideration  consisting of cash
multiplied by the total number of Mixed Election Shares  (the "Mixed Cash
Consideration Election Amount"). The "Stock Election  Amount" shall be equal
to the Per Share Stock Consideration multiplied by  the total number of Stock
Election Shares plus the amount of the Per Share  Mixed Consideration

Any Company Share with respect to which the holder (or the  beneficial owner,
as the case may be) shall not have submitted to the  Exchange Agent an
effective, properly completed Election Form on or before  a date after the
Effective Date to be agreed upon by the parties hereto  (which date shall be
set forth on the Election Form), but in any event not  earlier than the
twentieth (20th) Business Day after the Mailing Date  (such deadline, the
"Election Deadline"), shall be converted into the Per  Share Mixed
Consideration as set forth in Section 2.4(b) and shall be  deemed to be a
Mixed Election Share.   (iii)The Buyer shall make available one or more
Election Forms as may  be reasonably requested by all Persons who become
holders (or beneficial  owners) of Company Shares between the Mailing Date
and the close of  business on the business day prior to the Election
Deadline, and the Buyer  shall provide to the Exchange Agent all information
reasonably necessary  for it to perform as specified herein.   (iv) Any
election shall have been properly made only if the Exchange  Agent shall have
actually received a properly completed Election Form by  the Election
Deadline. An Election Form shall be deemed properly completed  only if
accompanied by    13    one or more certificates (or customary
affidavits and indemnification  regarding the loss or destruction of such
certificates or the guaranteed  delivery of such certificates) representing
all Company Shares covered by  such Election Form, together with duly
executed transmittal materials  included with the Election Form. Any Election
Form may be revoked or  changed by the person submitting such Election Form
(or the beneficial  owner of the shares covered by such Election Form through
appropriate and  customary documentation and instruction) at or prior to the
Election  Deadline. In the event an Election Form is revoked prior to the
Election  Deadline and no other valid election is made by the Election
Deadline, the  Company Shares represented by such Election Form shall be
Mixed Election  Shares. Subject to the terms of this Agreement and of the
Election Form,  the Exchange Agent shall have reasonable discretion to
determine whether  any election, revocation or change has been properly or
timely made and to  disregard immaterial defects in the Election Forms, and
any good faith  decisions of the Exchange Agent regarding such matters shall
be binding  and conclusive. Neither the Buyer nor the Exchange Agent shall be
under  any obligation to notify any person of any defect in an Election
Form.   (b) Allocation. As soon as reasonably practicable after the
Effective Time, the Buyer shall cause the Exchange Agent to allocate the
Merger Consideration among the holders of Company Shares, which shall be
effected by the Exchange Agent as follows:   (i) Each Mixed Election Share
shall be converted into the right to receive an amount of cash and a number
of shares of the Buyer\'s Stock equal to the Per Share Mixed
Consideration.   (ii) If the Total Cash Merger Consideration is greater than
the aggregate Cash Election Amount, then:   (A) each Cash Election Share
shall be converted into the right  to receive an amount of cash equal to the
Per Share Cash  Consideration; and   (B) each Stock Election Share shall be
converted into the  right to receive (1) an amount in cash equal to the Total
Cash Merger  Consideration less the aggregate Cash Election Amount divided by
the  total number of Stock Election Shares, and (2) a number of shares of 
the Buyer\'s Stock equal to the Total Stock Merger Consideration less  the
aggregate Mixed Stock Consideration Election Amount divided by  the total
number of Stock Election Shares.   (iii) If the Total Cash Merger
Consideration is less than the Cash Election Amount then:   (A) each Stock
Election Share shall be converted into the  right to receive the Per Share
Stock Consideration; and   (B) each Cash Election Share shall be converted
into the right  to receive (1) an amount in cash equal to the Total Cash
Merger  Consideration less the aggregate Mixed Cash Consideration Election 
Amount divided by the total number of Cash Election Shares, and (2) a  number
of shares of the Buyer\'s Stock    14    equal to the Total Stock Merger
Consideration less the aggregate  Stock Election Amount divided by the total
number of Cash Election  Shares.   2.5 EXCHANGE PROCEDURES.   (a) After
the Effective Time, the Buyer shall cause an exchange agent selected by the
Buyer and reasonably acceptable to the Company (the "Exchange Agent") to mail

appropriate transmittal materials (which shall specify that delivery shall be
effected, and risk of loss and title to the certificates representing Company
Shares prior to such Effective Time shall pass, only upon proper delivery of
such certificates to the Exchange Agent). After the Effective Time, each
holder of Company Shares issued and outstanding at the Effective Time (other

or certificates representing such shares to the Exchange Agent and upon
surrender thereof and completion of all required allocation procedures
contained in this ARTICLE II receive in exchange therefor the number of
shares of the Buyer\'s Stock and the cash to which such holder is entitled

any holder of Company Shares for any amounts paid or properly delivered in

Law.   (b) To the extent permitted by applicable Law, former shareholders
of record of the Company shall be entitled to vote after the Total Stock

exchanged their certificates representing such Company Shares for
certificates representing the Buyer\'s Stock in accordance with the
provisions of this Agreement. Whenever a dividend or other distribution is
declared by the Buyer on the Buyer\'s Stock, the record date for which is at
or after the Effective Time, the declaration shall include dividends or other

Buyer\'s Stock to which such holder is entitled and any such undelivered
dividends (without any interest) shall be delivered and paid with respect to
each share represented by such certificates.   2.6 AVERAGE CLOSING PRICE

a merger or sale of the Company prior to terminating the ESOP in order to
conform such provisions to changes in Law and applicable IRS guidance;

additional material liability to the Buyer. Neither Company nor the

amount, and shall use reasonable efforts to set its loan loss reserve amount
in a manner satisfactory to the Buyer; provided, however, that such action is
consistent with GAAP consistently applied (as determined by the Company
acting in good faith) and any applicable Law and further provided that such
action by the Company shall not be deemed a default by the Company of
any provisions of this Agreement or be deemed to cause a Material Adverse
Effect on the Company, Company Bank or any other Subsidiary of the
Company.   (g) Expenses Prior to Effective Time. The Company shall

and other benefit  programs and other services paid by the Bank for Employee
in which  Employee participated immediately prior to the termination,
provided that  Employee\'s continued participation is possible under the
applicable terms,  conditions and eligibility requirements of such plans and
programs.  Employee\'s continued participation in such plans and programs
shall be at  no greater cost to Employee than the cost she bore for such
participation  immediately prior to termination. If Employee\'s participation
in any such  plan or program is barred, the Bank shall arrange upon
comparable terms,  and at no greater cost to Employee than the cost she bore

release described above, he shall receive any such  payments in accordance
with the payment provisions of the applicable  plan(s).   (d) Limitation on

under this Agreement or otherwise payable to Employee constitute "parachute
payments" within the meaning of Section 280G of the Internal Revenue Code of

the excise tax imposed by Section 4999 of the Code, the Bank shall reduce the
aggregate amount of such payments and benefits such that the present value
thereof (as determined under the Code and the applicable regulations) is
equal to 2.99 times Employee\'s "base amount" as defined in Section
280G(b)(3) of the Code.   9. Survival. The terms and conditions of Sections
6 and 7 shall survive termination of this Agreement and/or Employee\'s

Agreement unless specific reference is made to such sections.   10.

which legal remedies would be inadequate. Therefore, in addition to any legal
or other relief to which the Corporation may be entitled, (a) the Corporation
may seek legal and equitable relief, including but not limited
to, preliminary and permanent injunctive relief, (b) the Corporation will
be released of its obligations under this Agreement, including but not
limited to, payments pursuant to Section 5, and (c) Employee will indemnify

or modification is in writing and is signed by the parties.   13.
Severability. If a court of competent jurisdiction holds that any provision
or sub-part thereof contained in this Agreement is invalid, illegal
or unenforceable, that invalidity,    illegality or unenforceability
shall not affect any other provision in this Agreement. Additionally, if any
of the provisions, clauses or phrases set forth in Section 6 or 7 of this
Agreement are held unenforceable by a court of competent jurisdiction, then
the parties desire that such provision, clause or phrase be "blue-penciled"
or rewritten by the court to the extent necessary to render it

agreements contained in this Agreement shall apply to, be binding upon and

(a) Definition. For purposes of this Agreement, "Change in Control" shall
mean any of the following:   (i) Any "person" (as such term is used in
Section 13(d)(3) or  14(d)(2) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as
amended (the "Act"))  acquiring "beneficial ownership") (as such term is used
in Rule 13d-3  under the Act), directly or indirectly, of securities of
Capital Bank  Corporation, the parent holding company of the Bank ("CBC")
representing  fifty percent (50%) or more of the combined voting power of
CBC\'s then  outstanding voting securities (the "Voting Power"), but
excluding for this  purpose an acquisition by CBC or an "affiliate" (as
defined in Rule 12b-2  under the Act) or by an employee benefit plan of CBC
or of an affiliate.   (ii) The individuals who constitute the Board of
Directors of CBC  ("Board") on the effective date hereof or their successors
duly appointed  in the ordinary course (collectively, the "Incumbent
Directors") cease to  constitute at least a majority of the Board. Any
director whose nomination  is approved by a majority of the Incumbent
Directors shall be considered  an Incumbent Director; provided, however, that
no Director whose initial  assumption of office is in connection with an
actual or threatened  election contest relating to the election of the
directors of CBC shall be  considered an Incumbent Director.   (iii) The
shareholders of CBC approve a reorganization, share  exchange, merger or
consolidation related to CBC or the Bank following  which the owners of the
Voting Power of CBC immediately prior to the  closing of such transaction do
not beneficially own, directly or  indirectly, more than fifty percent (50%)
of the Voting Power of the Bank.   (iv) The shareholders of the Bank approve
a complete liquidation  or dissolution of the Bank, or a sale or other
disposition of all or  substantially all of the capital stock or assets of
the Bank, but  excluding for this purpose any sale or disposition of all or
substantially  all of the capital stock or assets of the Bank to an
"affiliate" (as  defined in Rule 12b-2 under the Act) of CBC.  Change in
Control shall not include a transaction, or series of transactions, whereby
CBC or the Bank becomes a subsidiary of a holding company if the shareholders
of the holding company are substantially the same as the shareholders of CBC
prior to such transaction or series of series of transactions.   (b) Change
in Control Termination. After the occurrence of a Change in Control, Employee
shall be entitled to receive payments and benefits pursuant to this Agreement
in the following circumstances:     (i) if within the period beginning
ninety (90) days prior to and  ending three (3) years after the occurrence of
a Change in Control, the  Bank terminates Employee\'s employment for any
reason other than Cause,  Disability, or death; or   (ii) if within three
(3) years after the occurrence of a Change  in Control, Employee terminates
her employment with the Bank for Good  Reason. For purposes of this Section
8(b), Good Reason shall include the  failure of CBC to obtain an agreement,
satisfactory to Employee, from any  successor or assign of CBC to assume and
agree to perform this Agreement.   (c) Change in Control Benefits. In the
event that Employee\'s employment with the Bank terminates under any of the
circumstances described above in this Section 8 at any time, Employee shall
be entitled to receive all accrued compensation and any pro rata bonuses to
which he may be entitled and which Employee may have earned up to the date of
termination and, upon Employee\'s execution of an enforceable general release
in a form prepared by the Bank, severance payments and benefits according to
the following schedule and terms:   (i) a severance payment equal to: 2.99
times the amount of  Employee\'s then current annual base salary plus the
amount of bonus paid  to Employee, if any, in the prior bonus year by the
Bank (excluding any  bonus paid by 1st State Bank or 1st State Bancorp,
Inc.), in the event the  termination occurs no later than twelve (12) months
after the occurrence  of a Change in Control; 2.0 times the amount of
Employee\'s then current  annual base salary plus the amount of bonus paid to
Employee, if any, in  the prior bonus year by the Bank (excluding any bonus
paid by 1st State  Bank or 1st State Bancorp, Inc.), in the event the
termination occurs more  than twelve (12) months but within (up to and
including) twenty-four (24)  months after the occurrence of a Change in
Control; or 1.0 times the  amount of Employee\'s then current annual base
salary plus the amount of  bonus paid to Employee, if any, in the prior bonus
year by the Bank  (excluding any bonus paid by 1st State Bank or 1st State
Bancorp, Inc.),  in the event the termination occurs more than twenty-four
(24) months but  within (up to and including) thirty-six (36) months after
the occurrence  of a Change in Control. The severance payment shall be paid
in  substantially equal monthly installments without interest, commencing
one  month after the date of termination.   (ii) a continuation of benefits
for the period of time Employee  receives the severance benefits described in
Section 8(c)(i) above as  follows: During such time, the Bank shall maintain
and Employee shall be  entitled to participate in all life insurance,
retirement, health,  accidental death and dismemberment, and disability plans
and other benefit  programs and other services paid by the Bank for Employee
in which  Employee participated immediately prior to the termination,
provided that  Employee\'s continued participation is possible under the
applicable terms,  conditions and eligibility requirements of such plans and
programs.  Employee\'s continued participation in such plans and programs
shall be at  no greater cost to Employee than the cost he bore for such
participation  immediately prior to termination. If Employee\'s participation
in any such  plan or program is barred, the Bank shall arrange upon
comparable terms,  and at no greater cost to Employee than the cost he bore
for such plans  and programs prior to termination, to     provide
Employee with benefits substantially similar to, or greater than,  those
which he is entitled to receive under any such plan or program; and   (iii)
a lump sum payment (or otherwise as specified by Employee  to the extent
permitted by the applicable plan) of any and all amounts  contributed to a
Bank pension or retirement plan which Employee is  entitled to under the
terms of any such plan. In the event Employee fails  to execute the general
release described above, he shall receive any such  payments in accordance
with the payment provisions of the applicable  plan(s).   (d) Limitation on
Payments. To the extent that any of the payments and benefits provided for
under this Agreement or otherwise payable to Employee constitute "parachute
payments" within the meaning of Section 280G of the Internal Revenue Code of
1986, as amended (the "Code"), and but for this Section 8 would be subject to
the excise tax imposed by Section 4999 of the Code, the Bank shall reduce the
aggregate amount of such payments and benefits such that the present value
thereof (as determined under the Code and the applicable regulations) is
equal to 2.99 times Employee\'s "base amount" as defined in Section
280G(b)(3) of the Code.   9. Survival. The terms and conditions of Sections
6 and 7 shall survive termination of this Agreement and/or Employee\'s
employment and shall not be affected by any change or modification of this
Agreement unless specific reference is made to such sections.   10.
Remedies. Employee agrees that his breach or threatened violation of Sections
6 and 7, will result in immediate and irreparable harm to the Corporation for
which legal remedies would be inadequate. Therefore, in addition to any legal
or other relief to which the Corporation may be entitled, (a) the Corporation
may seek legal and equitable relief, including but not limited
to, preliminary and permanent injunctive relief, (b) the Corporation will
be released of its obligations under this Agreement, including but not
limited to, payments pursuant to Section 5, and (c) Employee will indemnify
the Corporation for all expenses, including attorneys\' fees, in seeking to
enforce these paragraphs.   11. Waiver Of Breach. The Bank\'s or
Employee\'s waiver of any breach of a provision of this Agreement shall not
waive any subsequent breach by the other party.   12. Entire Agreement.
This Agreement: (i) supersedes all other understandings and agreements, oral
or written, between the parties with respect to the subject matter of this
Agreement; and (ii) constitutes the sole agreement between the parties with
respect to this subject matter. Each party acknowledges that: (i) no
representations, inducements, promises or agreements, oral or written, have
been made by any party or by anyone acting on behalf of any party, which are
not embodied in this Agreement; and (ii) no agreement, statement or promise
not contained in this Agreement shall be valid. No change or modification of
this Agreement shall be valid or binding upon the parties unless such change
or modification is in writing and is signed by the parties.     13.
Severability. If a court of competent jurisdiction holds that any provision
or sub-part thereof contained in this Agreement is invalid, illegal
or unenforceable, that invalidity, illegality or unenforceability shall not
affect any other provision in this Agreement. Additionally, if any of the
provisions, clauses or phrases set forth in Section 6 or 7 of this Agreement
are held unenforceable by a court of competent jurisdiction, then the parties
desire that such provision, clause or phrase be "blue-penciled" or rewritten
by the court to the extent necessary to render it enforceable.   14.
Parties Bound. The terms, provisions, covenants and agreements contained in
this Agreement shall apply to, be binding upon and inure to the benefit of
the Bank\'s successors and assigns. The Bank, at its discretion, may assign
this Agreement. Employee may not assign this Agreement without the
Bank\'s prior written consent.   15. Governing Law. This Agreement and the
employment relationship created by it shall be governed by North Carolina
law. The parties hereby consent to exclusive jurisdiction in North Carolina
for the purpose of any litigation relating to this Agreement and agree that
any litigation by or involving them relating to this Agreement shall be
conducted in the court of Wake County or the federal court of the United
States for the Eastern District of North Carolina.   IN WITNESS WHEREOF, the

FORM OF McGILL CONSULTING AGREEMENT  This AGREEMENT ("Agreement") is made
and entered into by JAMES C. McGILL ("McGill") and CAPITAL BANK (hereinafter
the "Bank"). Throughout the remainder of the Agreement, McGill and the Bank
may be collectively referred to as "the parties."   McGill tendered his
resignation from employment and any and all positions with 1st State Bank and
1st State Bancorp, Inc. and any of their respective subsidiaries and
affiliated entities, such resignations to be effective __________ ___, 200__
(the "Resignation Date"), and _______________, on behalf of itself and each
such subsidiary and affiliated entity, accepted such resignations. McGill
desires to provide consulting services to the Bank from his Resignation Date
through __________ ___, 200__ [the fourth anniversary of the Resignation
Date], and the Bank desires to enter into such consulting arrangement. The
parties have negotiated the terms of the consulting arrangement and have
agreed upon acceptable terms as described herein.   In consideration of the
above and the mutual promises set forth below, and other valuable
consideration to which McGill otherwise is not entitled, the receipt and
sufficiency of which is hereby acknowledged, the parties agree
as follows:   1. CONSULTING SERVICES. From the Resignation Date through
__________ ___, 200__ [the fourth anniversary of the Resignation Date],
McGill shall provide advice and consultation as requested by the Bank. In
performing these services, McGill will comply with all applicable
professional and industry standards and laws, regulations and rules and will
use his best efforts, skills and knowledge, and exercise the degree of skill
and care required by the highest levels of accepted professional
standards.   2. CONSULTING FEES. In consideration of his agreement to
provide consulting services and the other covenants contained herein, the
Bank shall pay McGill (or his estate in the event of his death) a consulting
fee of Two Hundred Fifty Thousand and No/100 Dollars ($250,000.00) per year
payable in equal bi-monthly installments. The Bank acknowledges and agrees
that such payments shall continue to be made during the term of this
Agreement without regard to whether McGill is unable to provide consulting
services by reason of his death or disability. In addition, the Bank shall
reimburse McGill for (a) the applicable COBRA premiums for McGill for such
period commencing on the Resignation Date and continuing until such time as
McGill is Medicare eligible and (b) the applicable cost of obtaining a
reasonable Medigap supplement policy for McGill for the period commencing at
the time McGill is Medicare eligible until the expiration of this
Agreement.   3. INDEPENDENT CONTRACTOR STATUS. The parties hereby
acknowledge and agree that McGill shall provide consulting services for the
Bank strictly as an independent contractor. Nothing in this Agreement shall
be construed to render him an employee, co-venturer, agent, or other
representative of the Bank. McGill shall not have the authority to negotiate
or enter into any contract or other undertaking or make any representation on
behalf of or binding on the Bank. McGill understands that he must comply with
all tax laws applicable to a self-employed    individual, including the
filing of any necessary tax returns and the payment of all income and self-
employment taxes. The Bank shall not be required to withhold from the
consulting fee any state or federal income taxes or to make payments for
Social Security ("FICA") tax, unemployment insurance, or any other
payroll taxes. The Bank shall not be responsible for, and shall not obtain,
worker\'s compensation, disability benefits insurance, or unemployment
security insurance coverage for McGill. From the Resignation Date forward,
McGill shall not be eligible for, or entitled to, and shall not participate
in, any of the Bank\'s compensation, pension, health, or other benefit plans,
if any such plans exist. Consistent with his duties and obligations under
this Agreement, McGill shall, at all times, maintain sole and exclusive
control over the manner and method by which he performs his consulting
services.   4. COMPANY INFORMATION.Except as necessary to perform consulting
services under this Agreement, McGill shall not, at any time, during or after
the period during which he performs services pursuant to this Agreement,
disclose, use or aid third parties in obtaining or using any confidential or
proprietary information belonging to the Bank and/or its parent, subsidiaries
and/or affiliates. Confidential or proprietary information is information
relating to the Bank or any aspect of its business which is not generally
available to the public, the Bank\'s competitors or other third parties, or
ascertainable through common sense or general business or technical
knowledge. If such information is sought from McGill by court order or other
mandatory government process, then McGill shall notify the Bank and, at its
expense, take all reasonably necessary steps to defend against such court
order or other mandatory process. Additionally, McGill shall permit the Bank
to participate with counsel of its choice in any related enforcement
proceedings. The provisions of this Section 4 shall survive any termination
of this Agreement. McGill shall return all of the Bank\'s property and
confidential or proprietary information in his possession, custody or control
(including but not limited to computer software and hardware, records, files
and other documents in whatever form they exist, whether electronic, hard
copy or otherwise, and all copies, notes, or summaries thereof) to the Bank
as requested by the Bank.   5. NON-SOLICITATION/NON-COMPETE. McGill
acknowledges that by virtue of McGill\'s past relationship with 1st State
Bancorp, Inc. and 1st State Bank and his consulting relationship with the
Bank, McGill shall have access to and control of confidential and proprietary
information concerning the Bank\'s and/or its parents\', subsidiaries\' or
affiliates\' (collectively, the "Bank") business and that the Bank\'s
business depends to a considerable extent on the individual skills, efforts,
and leadership of McGill. Additionally, McGill acknowledges that the
covenants contained in this Section 5: are reasonably necessary to protect
the legitimate business interests of the Bank; are described with sufficient
accuracy and definiteness to enable him to understand the scope of the
restrictions imposed on him; and were disclosed to him prior to
the commencement of his consulting relationship, such consulting relationship
being conditioned on his execution of an agreement containing such terms.
Accordingly and in consideration of the Bank\'s commitments to McGill under
this Agreement, McGill expressly covenants and agrees that he shall not,
without the prior consent of the Bank, during his consulting relationship and
for one (1) year following the cessation of his consulting relationship
regardless of the reason for the cessation:   (a) on McGill\'s own or
another\'s behalf, whether as an officer, director, stockholder, partner,
associate, owner, employee, consultant or otherwise:     (i) within any
city, metropolitan area or county in which the  Bank does business or is
located, engage in any business activity (or  assist others to engage in any
business activity) that directly competes  with the Bank;   (ii) solicit or
do business that is the same, similar to, or  otherwise in competition with
the business engaged in by the Bank from or  with persons or entities who are
customers of the Bank, who were customers  of the Bank at any time during the
last year of McGill\'s service to the  Bank, or to whom the Bank made
proposals for business at any time during  the last year of McGill\'s service
to the Bank; or   (iii) employ, offer employment to, or otherwise solicit
for  employment, any employee or other person who is then currently an
employee  of the Bank or who was employed by the Bank during the last year
of  McGill\'s service to the Bank.   (b) within any city, metropolitan area
or county in which the Bank does business or is located, be employed or
otherwise engaged by any entity that engages in the same, similar or
otherwise competitive business as the Bank, to provide the same or similar
services that McGill provided service to the Bank.   6. RELEASE. In

Agreement to which, McGill agrees, he otherwise would not be entitled, MCGILL

Capital Bank Corporation, a North Carolina corporation (the "Buyer").  
WHEREAS, concurrently herewith, the Buyer and the Company are entering into
an Merger Agreement of even date herewith (as amended from time to time, the

into the Buyer, with the Buyer as the surviving corporation (the "Merger");
and   WHEREAS, each Shareholder owns as of the date hereof the number of

constituting such Shareholder\'s "Shares"); and   WHEREAS, the Buyer has
entered into the Merger Agreement in reliance on and in consideration of,
among other things, each Shareholder\'s representations, warranties,
covenants and agreements hereunder.   NOW THEREFORE, in consideration of the
mutual covenants and agreements herein contained and other good and valuable
consideration, and intending to be legally bound hereby, the parties agree as
follows:   1. VOTING. Each Shareholder hereby revokes any and all previous
proxies with respect to such Shareholder\'s Shares and irrevocably agrees to
vote and otherwise act (including pursuant to written consent), with respect
to all of such Shareholder\'s Shares, for the approval and the adoption of
the Merger Agreement and all transactions contemplated thereby, including
without limitation all agreements related to the Merger and any actions
related thereto, and against any proposal or transaction which could prevent
or delay the consummation of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement
or the Merger Agreement, at any meeting or meetings of the shareholders of
the Company, and any adjournment, postponement or continuation thereof, at

Effective Time (as defined in the Merger Agreement), such Shareholder\'s
Shares specified on Schedule A are the only shares of Common Stock owned by
such Shareholder. Except as set forth on Schedule A, such Shareholder does

reorganization, moratorium or similar laws now or hereafter in effect
affecting the enforcement of creditors\' rights generally and except that the
availability of specific performance, injunctive relief and other equitable
remedies is subject to the discretion of the court before which any

OF AFFILIATE LETTER   _____________, 2005  Capital Bank Corporation P.O.
Box 18949 Raleigh, North Carolina 27619-8949   Re: Affiliate\'s
Agreement  Ladies and Gentlemen:   The undersigned is a shareholder of 1st
State Bancorp, Inc. (the "Company"), a Virginia bank holding company, and
will become a shareholder of Capital Bank Corporation ("CBC"), a North
Carolina bank holding company, pursuant to the transactions described in the
Merger Agreement, dated as of __________, 2005, by and between the Company
and CBC (the "Merger Agreement"), and the related Plan of Merger between the
Company and CBC. Under the terms of the Merger Agreement, the Company\'s
outstanding common stock ("Company Stock") will be exchanged for shares of
CBC\'s common stock ("CBC Stock") and/or cash consideration. This
Affiliate\'s Agreement represents an agreement between the undersigned and
CBC regarding certain rights and obligations of the undersigned in connection
with (i) the shares of Company Stock beneficially owned by the undersigned
and (ii) the shares of CBC Stock for which such shares of Company Stock will
be exchanged as a result of the merger of the Company with and into CBC (the
"Merger").   The execution and delivery of this Agreement by the undersigned
is a material inducement to CBC to consummate the Merger (as such term is
defined in the Merger Agreement). In consideration of the Merger and the
mutual covenants contained herein, the undersigned and CBC hereby agree as
follows:   1. AFFILIATE STATUS. The undersigned understands and agrees that
as to the Company he, she or it may be deemed an "affiliate" as that term is
used in Rule 145 of the rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange
Commission ("SEC") under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended (the "1933
Act").   2. COVENANTS AND WARRANTIES OF UNDERSIGNED. The undersigned
represents, warrants and agrees that:   (a) CBC has informed the
undersigned that the issuance of shares of CBC Stock has been registered
under the 1933 Act on a Registration Statement on Form S-4, and that any
distribution by the undersigned of CBC Stock has not been registered under
the 1933 Act and that such shares received pursuant to the Merger can only be
sold by the undersigned (1) following registration under the 1933 Act, or (2)
in conformity with the volume and other applicable requirements of Rules 144
or 145(d) promulgated by the SEC as the same now exist or may    hereafter
be amended, or (3) to the extent some other exemption from registration under
the 1933 Act might be available.   (b) The undersigned is aware that CBC and
the Company intend to treat the Merger as a tax-free reorganization under
Section 368 of the Internal Revenue Code, as amended (the "Code"), for
federal income tax purposes. The undersigned agrees to treat the transaction
in the same manner as CBC and the Company for federal income tax purposes.
The undersigned acknowledges that Section 1.368-1(b) of the U.S. federal
income tax regulations requires "continuity of interest" in order for the
Merger to be treated as a tax-free reorganization under Section 368 of the
Code. Continuity of interest may not be preserved if stock of an acquired
company is disposed of before an acquisition to the acquired or acquiring
company or to persons related to either the acquired or acquiring companies
for consideration other than stock of the acquiring company, if a shareholder
of the acquired company received certain distributions from the acquired
company with respect to his stock in connection with the acquisition, or if
stock of the acquiring company issued in the Merger is disposed of in
connection with the Merger to the acquiring company or to persons related to
the acquiring company. Accordingly, the undersigned declares that in
connection with the Merger (i) the undersigned has not and will not dispose
of any of the stock of either the Company or CBC to either the Company or CBC
(other than in exchange for the Merger Consideration), to a person related to
the Company (within the meaning of Section 1.368-1(e)(1)(i)(sixth sentence)
of the U.S. federal income tax regulations) or to a person related to CBC
(within the meaning of Section 1.368-1(e)(3) of such regulations), (ii)
the undersigned has not and will not receive any dividend or other
distribution with respect to the stock of the Company attributable directly
or indirectly to funds provided by CBC, and (iii) the undersigned will not
dispose of any CBC stock received in the Merger to CBC or to a person related
to CBC within the meaning of Section 1.368-1(e)(3) of the U.S. federal income
tax regulations.   3. RESTRICTIONS ON TRANSFER. The undersigned understands
and agrees that stop transfer instructions with respect to the shares of CBC
Stock received by the undersigned pursuant to the Merger will be given to the
CBC transfer agent and that there will be placed on the certificates for such
shares, or shares issued in substitution thereof, a legend stating
substantially as follows:   "The shares represented by this certificate may
not be  sold, transferred or otherwise disposed of except or  unless (1)
covered by an effective registration  statement under the Securities Act of
1933, as amended,  or an exemption therefrom, (2) in accordance with (i) 
Rule 145(d) (in the case of shares issued to an  individual who is not an
affiliate of the issuer) or  (ii) Rule 144 (in the case of shares issued to
an  individual who is an affiliate of the issuer) of the  Rules and
Regulations of such Act, or (3) in accordance  with a legal opinion
satisfactory to counsel for the  issuer that such sale or transfer is
otherwise exempt  from the registration requirements of such Act. For 
avoidance of doubt, it is understood that a legal  opinion is neither
required by law nor this legend and  it shall be in the issuer\'s sole
discretion whether or  not to require that a legal opinion be delivered to
it  prior to any such, transfer or other disposition."    Such legend
will also be placed on any certificate representing CBC securities issued
subsequent to the original issuance of the CBC Stock pursuant to the Merger
as a result of any stock dividend, stock split, or other recapitalization as
long as the CBC Stock issued to the undersigned pursuant to the Merger
has not been transferred in such manner to justify the removal of the
legend therefrom. If the provisions of Rules 144 and 145 are amended to
eliminate restrictions applicable to the CBC Stock received by the
undersigned pursuant to the Merger, or at the expiration of the restrictive
period set forth in Rule 145(d), CBC, upon the request of the undersigned,
will cause the certificates representing the shares of CBC Stock issued to
the undersigned in connection with the Merger to be reissued free of any
legend relating to the restrictions set forth in Rules 144 or 145(d) upon
receipt by CBC of an opinion of its counsel to the effect that such legend
may be removed.   4. UNDERSTANDING OF RESTRICTIONS ON DISPOSITIONS. The
undersigned has carefully read the Merger Agreement and this Affiliate\'s
Agreement and discussed their requirements and impact upon the ability to
sell, transfer, or otherwise dispose of the shares of CBC Stock received by
the undersigned, to the extent he or it believes necessary, with his
counsel.   5. TRANSFER UNDER RULE 145(D). If the undersigned desires to sell
or otherwise transfer the shares of CBC Stock received by him or it in
connection with the Merger at any time during the restrictive period set
forth in Rule 145(d), the undersigned will provide the necessary
representation letter to the transfer agent for CBC Stock together with such
additional information as the transfer agent may reasonably request.   6.
ACKNOWLEDGMENTS. The undersigned recognizes and agrees that the foregoing
provisions also may apply to (i) the undersigned\'s spouse, if that spouse
has the same home as the undersigned, (ii) any relative of the undersigned
who has the same home as the undersigned, (iii) any trust or estate in which
the undersigned, such spouse, and any such relative collectively own at least
a 10% beneficial interest or of which any of the foregoing serves as trustee,
executor, or in any similar capacity, and (iv) any corporation or
other organization in which the undersigned, such spouse, and any such
relative collectively own at least 10% of any class of equity securities or
of the equity interest. The undersigned further recognizes that, under
certain circumstances, any sale of CBC Stock by the undersigned within a
period of less than six months following the effective time of the Merger may
subject the undersigned to liability pursuant to Section 16(b) of the
Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended.   7. INJUNCTIVE RELIEF. Each
of the parties acknowledge that (i) the covenants and the restrictions
contained in this Agreement are necessary, fundamental, and required for the
protection of CBC and to preserve for CBC the benefits of the Merger; (ii)
such covenants relate to matters which are of a special, unique, and
extraordinary character that gives each of such covenants a special, unique,
and extraordinary value; and (iii) a breach of any such covenants or any
other provision of this Agreement shall result in irreparable harm and
damages to CBC which cannot be adequately compensated by a monetary award.
Accordingly, it is expressly agreed that in addition to all other remedies
available at law or in equity, CBC shall be entitled to the immediate remedy
of a temporary restraining order, preliminary injunction, or such other form
of injunctive or equitable relief as may be used by any court of
competent jurisdiction to    restrain or enjoin any of the parties hereto
from breaching any such covenant or provision or to specifically enforce the
provisions hereof.   8. MISCELLANEOUS. This Affiliate\'s Agreement is the
complete agreement between CBC and the undersigned concerning the subject
matter hereof. Any notice required to be sent to any party hereunder shall be
sent by registered or certified mail, return receipt requested, using the
addresses set forth herein or such other address as shall be furnished in
writing by the parties. This Affiliate\'s Agreement shall be governed by the
laws of the State of North Carolina, without regard to principles of
conflicts of laws.   This Affiliate\'s Agreement is executed as of the _____
