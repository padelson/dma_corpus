NOW, THEREFORE, in consideration of the premises, and of the representations,
warranties, covenants and agreements contained herein, the parties hereto
agree as follows:

ARTICLE I

 

 _THE MERGER_

but subject to the satisfaction or waiver of such conditions at the Closing),
at the offices of Wachtell, Lipton, Rosen and Katz, 51 West 52nd Street, New
York, New York 10019, _provided_ , that if the Marketing Period has not ended

the Company (it being understood that such date may be conditioned upon the
simultaneous completion of the Financing) and (ii) the first Business Day

of the foregoing clauses (i) and (ii), to the satisfaction or (to the extent
permitted by applicable Law) waiver of all of the conditions set forth in
Article VI (other than those conditions that by their nature are to be
satisfied at the Closing, but subject to the satisfaction or waiver of such
conditions at the Closing) as of the date determined pursuant to this
proviso) or (b) at such other date, time or place as agreed to in writing by
Parent and the Company. The date on which the Closing actually occurs is
referred to herein as the " _Closing Date_." For the avoidance of doubt, a
condition may only be waived in writing by the party or parties entitled to
such condition under this Agreement.

 Section 1.3. _Effective Time_. Subject to the terms and conditions
hereof, on the Closing Date, the Company and Parent will cause a certificate
of merger (the " _Certificate of Merger_ ") to be duly executed, acknowledged
and filed with the Secretary of State of the State of Delaware in accordance

applicable Law.

 

Section 2.4. _Directors_. The directors of Merger Sub immediately prior

Shares that immediately prior to the Effective Time are held by the Company in
treasury or by Parent or Merger Sub (collectively, " _Cancelled Shares_ ")
shall at the Effective Time automatically be cancelled and shall cease to
exist, and no consideration shall be delivered or deliverable in exchange
therefor. Shares that immediately prior to the Effective Time are held by any

share, of the Surviving Corporation such that the ownership percentage of any
such Subsidiary in the Surviving Corporation immediately following the
Effective Time shall equal the ownership percentage of such Subsidiary in the
Company immediately prior to the Effective Time.

 

(c) _Conversion of Merger Sub Common Stock_. At the Effective Time, each
share of common stock, par value $0.01 per share, of Merger Sub issued and

Shares a cash amount sufficient to pay the aggregate Merger Consideration
(such cash being hereinafter referred to as the " _Exchange Fund_ "). The
Exchange Fund shall not be used for any purpose except as set forth herein.
The Paying Agent shall invest the Exchange Fund as reasonably directed by
Parent; _provided_ , that such investments shall be in short-term obligations
of, or guaranteed in full by, the United States of America with maturities no
more than thirty (30) days or in commercial paper obligations rated A-1 or
P-1 or better by Moodys Investors Service, Inc. or Standard and Poors
Corporation. Any interest and other income resulting from such investments
shall be payable to Parent or the Surviving Corporation and any amounts in
excess of the amounts payable under this Article II shall be promptly returned
to the Surviving Corporation. To the extent that there are any losses with
respect to any such investments, Parent shall, or shall cause the Surviving
Corporation to, promptly replace or restore the cash in the Exchange Fund so
as to ensure that the Exchange Fund is at all times maintained at a level
sufficient for the Paying Agent to pay the aggregate Merger Consideration
under this Article II. No investment losses resulting from investment of the
funds deposited with the Paying Agent shall diminish the rights of any holder
of Shares to receive the Merger Consideration as provided herein.

(b) _Exchange Procedures_.

 

(i) _Letter of Transmittal_. As soon as reasonably practicable after the
Effective Time (but in any event no later than five (5) Business Days after
the date on which the Effective Time occurs), Parent shall, or shall cause the
Surviving Corporation to, cause the Paying Agent to mail to each Record Holder
of a certificate (a " _Certificate_ ") or book-entry share (a " _Book-Entry
Share_ ") that immediately prior to the Effective Time represented Shares,
which Shares were converted into the right to receive the Merger Consideration
pursuant to Section 2.6(a), (A) a letter of transmittal (which shall be in
customary form and with such other provisions as Parent and the Company shall
reasonably agree, and which shall specify that delivery shall be effected, and
risk of loss and title shall pass, only upon delivery of such Certificates
(or affidavits of loss in lieu thereof as provided in Section 2.7(e)) or
transfer of such Book-Entry Shares to the Paying Agent (including customary
provisions with respect to delivery of an "agents message" with respect to
Book-Entry Shares)) and (B) instructions for effecting the surrender of
Certificates (or affidavits of loss in lieu thereof as provided in Section
2.7(e)) or Book-Entry Shares to the Paying Agent in exchange for payment of
the Merger Consideration therefor.

(ii) _Payment for Shares_. Upon surrender to the Paying Agent of
Certificates (or affidavits of loss in lieu thereof as provided in Section
2.7(e)) or Book-Entry Shares, together with, in the case of Certificates, such
letter of transmittal, duly completed and validly executed in accordance with
the instructions thereto, or, in the case of Book-Entry Shares, receipt of an
"agents message" by the Paying Agent, and such other customary documents as
may reasonably be required by the Paying Agent, the holder of
such Certificates or Book-Entry Shares shall be entitled to receive in
exchange therefor, and the Paying Agent shall be required to deliver to each
such holder, a check in the amount of cash (after giving effect to any
required withholding taxes as provided in Section 2.7(g)) that such holder
has the right to receive pursuant to Section 2.6(a). No interest will be paid
or accrued on any amount payable in respect of Certificates or Book-Entry
Shares. If payment of the Merger Consideration is to be made to a Person
other than the Person in whose name a surrendered Certificate or, in the case
of a Book-Entry Share, a surrendered Share is registered, it will be a
condition of payment that the Certificate or, in the case of a Book-Entry
Share, the Share so surrendered be endorsed properly or otherwise be in proper
form for transfer and that the Person requesting such payment has paid all
transfer and other Taxes required by reason of the payment of the
Merger Consideration to a Person other than the registered holder of the
Certificate or, in the case of a Book-Entry Share, the Share surrendered and
has established to the reasonable satisfaction of the Paying Agent and the
Surviving Corporation that such Taxes have been paid or are not applicable.

(c) _Closing of Transfer Books_. From and after the Effective Time, the
stock transfer books of the Surviving Corporation shall be closed and there
shall be no further registration of transfers on the stock transfer books of
the Surviving Corporation of the Shares that were outstanding immediately
prior to the Effective Time. Until surrendered as contemplated by Section
2.7(b), each Certificate and Book-Entry Share (other than Excluded Shares)
shall, from and after the Effective Time, represent only the right to receive
the Merger Consideration, without interest thereon, as contemplated by
Section 2.6(a). If, after the Effective Time, Certificates or, in the case of
Book-Entry Shares, such Shares are presented to the Surviving Corporation,
Parent or the Paying Agent for transfer or any other reason, they shall be
cancelled and exchanged for the Merger Consideration as provided in this
Article II.

 

(d) _Termination of Exchange Fund_. Any portion of the Exchange Fund
(including the proceeds of any investments thereof) that remains unclaimed by
the Record Holders of Shares one year after the Effective Time shall be
delivered to the Surviving Corporation. Any Record Holder of Shares (other
than Excluded Shares) who has not theretofore complied with this Article II
shall thereafter look only to the Surviving Corporation and Parent, which
shall remain responsible for payment of the Merger Consideration for such
Shares as provided in this Article II, without any interest
thereon. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary herein, none of the
Surviving Corporation, Parent, Merger Sub, the Paying Agent or any other
Person shall be liable to any Record Holder of Shares for any amount properly
delivered to a public official pursuant to applicable abandoned property,
escheat or similar Laws.

(e) _Lost, Stolen or Destroyed Certificates_. In the event that any
Certificate shall have been lost, stolen or destroyed, upon the making of an
affidavit of that fact by the holder thereof, and if determined by Parent in
its sole discretion, the posting by such holder of a bond in

 



5 ##### Table of Contents

  

 customary amount and upon such terms as may be required by Parent as
indemnity against any claim that may be made against it, the Surviving
Corporation or the Paying Agent with respect to such Certificate, Parent will
cause the Surviving Corporation or the Paying Agent to pay in exchange for
such lost, stolen or destroyed Certificate the Merger Consideration payable in
respect of the Shares previously evidenced by such lost, stolen or destroyed
Certificate, without any interest thereon.

(f) _Dissenting Shares_. Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to
the contrary, if required by the DGCL (but only to the extent required
thereby), Shares that are issued and outstanding immediately prior to the
Effective Time (other than Cancelled Shares and Converted Shares) and that are
held by holders of such Shares who have not voted in favor of the adoption of
this Agreement or consented thereto in writing and who have properly exercised
appraisal rights with respect thereto in accordance with, and who have
complied with, Section 262 of the DGCL (the " _Dissenting Shares_ ") will not
be converted into the right to receive the Merger Consideration, and holders
of such Dissenting Shares will be entitled to receive payment of the fair
value of such Dissenting Shares in accordance with the provisions of such
Section 262 unless and until any such holder fails to perfect or effectively
withdraws or loses its rights to appraisal and payment under the DGCL. If,
after the Effective Time, any such holder fails to perfect or effectively
withdraws or loses such right, such Dissenting Shares will thereupon be
treated as if they had been converted into and had become exchangeable for, at
the Effective Time, the right to receive the Merger Consideration, without
any interest thereon. At the Effective Time, any holder of Dissenting Shares
shall cease to have any rights with respect thereto, except the rights
provided in Section 262 of the DGCL and as provided in the previous sentence.
The Company will give Parent prompt notice of any written demands received by
the Company for appraisals of Shares, including any holders written notice of
its intent to demand payment pursuant to Section 262 of the DGCL that the
Company receives, withdrawals of such demands and any other instruments served
pursuant to Section 262 of the DGCL and received by the Company. Parent shall
have the right to direct and control all negotiations and proceedings with
respect to any such demands, withdrawals or attempted withdrawals of such
demands; _provided_ that, after the date hereof until the Effective Time,
Parent shall consult with the Company with respect to such negotiations and
proceedings. The Company shall not, except with the prior written consent of
Parent, and prior to the Effective Time, Parent shall not, except with the
prior written consent of the Company, make any payment with respect to any
demands for appraisal or offer to settle or compromise, or settle or
compromise or otherwise negotiate, any such demands, or approve any withdrawal
of any such demands, or waive any failure to timely deliver a written demand
for appraisal or otherwise to comply with Section 262 of the DGCL, or agree
to do any of the foregoing.

(g) _Withholding Rights_. Each of Parent, the Surviving Corporation and
the Paying Agent shall be entitled to deduct and withhold from the
consideration otherwise payable pursuant to this Agreement (including pursuant
to Sections 2.6(a) and 2.8) such Taxes as it is required to deduct and
withhold with respect to the making of such payment under the Internal
Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the " _Code_ "), or the rules and
regulations promulgated thereunder, or under any other applicable provision of
Law. To the extent that amounts are so deducted and withheld by Parent, the
Surviving Corporation or the Paying Agent, as the case may be, and timely paid
over to the appropriate Governmental Entity, such deducted and withheld
amounts shall be treated for all purposes of this Agreement as having been
paid to the Person in respect of which such deduction and withholding was made
by Parent, the Surviving Corporation or the Paying Agent, as the case may be.

outstanding and unexercised immediately prior to the Effective Time shall, as
of the Effective Time, become fully vested (to the extent unvested) and be
converted into the right to receive an amount in cash equal to the product of

by Parent and a holder of any Company Restricted Stock Awards with respect to
such holders Company Restricted Stock Awards, each award in respect of a
Share subject to vesting, repurchase or other lapse restriction (each, a "
_Company Restricted Stock Award_ ") that is outstanding immediately prior to
the Effective Time shall, as of the Effective Time, either (i) become fully
vested, in the case of any Company Restricted Stock Award that vests solely
based on continued service, or (ii) vested to the extent provided for in the
award agreement applicable to such Company Restricted Stock Award, in the case
of any Company Restricted Stock Award that vests in whole or in part based on
performance conditions and for which the applicable performance period is not
complete as of immediately prior to the Effective Time, and shall be cancelled
and converted automatically into the right to receive an amount in cash
equal to the Merger Consideration in respect of each vested Share subject to
such Company Restricted Stock Award. For purposes of clause (ii), the
determination of actual performance and the number of Shares underlying the
Company Restricted Stock Award that vest as of the Effective Time shall be
made by the Company Board (or an authorized committee thereof) prior to the
Effective Time.

 

(c) Except as otherwise agreed to in writing prior to the Effective Time by

that is outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time shall, as of the
Effective Time, either (i) become fully vested, in the case of any Company RSU
Award that vests solely based on continued service, or (ii) vested to the

Award, in the case of any Company RSU Award that vests in whole or in part
based on performance conditions and for which the applicable performance
period is not complete as of immediately prior to the Effective Time, and

Share subject to such Company RSU Award. For purposes of clause (ii), the
determination of actual performance and the number of Shares underlying the
Company RSU Award that vest as of the Effective Time shall be made by the
Company Board (or an authorized committee thereof) prior to the Effective
Time.

as reasonably practicable after the Closing Date, but in any event within five
(5) Business Days thereafter.

 

(e) Prior to the Effective Time, the Company Board or any authorized
committee thereof shall adopt such resolutions as may reasonably be
appropriate or required in its discretion to effectuate the actions
contemplated by this Section  2.8.

that, between the date of this Agreement and the Effective Time, the Company
changes the number of Shares issued and outstanding as a result of a
reclassification, stock split or reverse stock split, stock dividend or stock
distribution, recapitalization, combination, merger, issuer tender or
exchange offer, or other similar transaction, the Merger Consideration shall
be correspondingly adjusted to reflect such change and to provide the holders
of Shares the same economic effect as contemplated by this Agreement prior to
such action, and as so adjusted shall, from and after the date of such event,
be the Merger Consideration.

 _REPRESENTATIONS AND WARRANTIES OF PARENT AND MERGER SUB_

 

Except as set forth in the disclosure letter delivered by Parent to the
Company prior to entering into this Agreement (the " _Parent Disclosure
Schedule_ ") (it being acknowledged and agreed that (i) disclosure of any item
in any section or subsection of the Parent Disclosure Schedule, whether or not
an explicit cross reference appears, shall be deemed disclosure with respect
to any other section or subsection to which the relevance of such item is
reasonably apparent on the face of such disclosure, and (ii) the mere
inclusion of an item in the Parent Disclosure Schedule as an exception to a
representation or warranty shall not be deemed an admission that such item
represents a material exception or material fact, event or circumstance or
that such item is material or constitutes a Parent Material Adverse Effect or
that the inclusion of such item in the Parent Disclosure Schedule is
required), Parent and Merger Sub jointly and severally hereby represent and
warrant to the Company as follows:

 

Section 4.1. _Organization_. Parent is a limited partnership, and Merger
Sub is a corporation, and each is duly organized, validly existing and in
good standing (with respect to jurisdictions that recognize that concept)
under the Laws of its respective jurisdiction of organization and each has all
requisite corporate or similar power and authority to own, lease and operate
its properties, rights and assets and to carry on its business as now being
conducted, except where the failure to be in good standing or to have such
corporate or similar power and authority would not constitute a Parent
Material Adverse Effect. Each of Parent and Merger Sub is duly qualified or
licensed to do business and is in good standing (with respect to jurisdictions
that recognize that concept) as a foreign corporation (or other applicable
entity) in each jurisdiction where the ownership, leasing or operation of its
properties, rights or assets or conduct of its business requires such
qualification or licensing, except in such jurisdictions where the failure to
be so qualified or licensed or to be in good standing would not constitute a
Parent

 Material Adverse Effect. For purposes of this Agreement, a "Parent Material
Adverse Effect" means any fact, circumstance, change, event, occurrence or
effect that, individually or in the aggregate, materially impairs, materially
delays or prevents, or would reasonably be expected to materially impair,
materially delay or prevent, Parent or Merger Sub from consummating the
Merger. Parent has made available to the Company true, complete and correct
copies of the certificate of incorporation and bylaws (or similar organization
documents) of Parent and Merger Sub, in each case as in effect as of the date
of this Agreement. Except as would not constitute a Parent Material Adverse
Effect, neither Parent nor Merger Sub is in violation of any provision of its
certificate of incorporation or bylaws (or similar organization documents).

 

Section 4.2. _Capitalization; Merger Sub_.

 

(a) The authorized capital stock of Merger Sub consists solely of 100
shares of common stock, par value $0.01 per share, all of which are validly
issued and outstanding. All of the issued and outstanding capital stock of
Merger Sub is, and at the Effective Time will be, owned by Parent or a wholly
owned Subsidiary of Parent free and clear of all Liens.

 

(b) Merger Sub has been formed solely for the purpose of the Merger and
prior to the Effective Time will have engaged in no other business activities
and will have owned no assets and incurred no liabilities or obligations other
than in connection with the transactions contemplated hereby and activities
incidental to its formation.

 

Section 4.3. _Authority_. Each of Parent and Merger Sub has the
requisite corporate power and authority to execute and deliver this Agreement
and to perform its obligations hereunder and to consummate the Merger and the
other transactions contemplated hereby. The execution and delivery of this
Agreement by Parent and Merger Sub and the consummation by each of Parent and
Merger Sub of the Merger and the other transactions contemplated hereby have
been duly authorized by all necessary actions on the part of each of Parent
and Merger Sub. Concurrently with the execution of this Agreement, New
Imagitas, Inc., a North Carolina corporation and a wholly owned Subsidiary of
Parent, in its capacity as the sole stockholder of Merger Sub, has adopted
this Agreement and approved the Merger and the other transactions
contemplated hereby, and no other actions on the part of Parent or Merger Sub
or any other Subsidiary of Parent, including any vote of the stockholders of
Parent, are necessary to authorize the consummation of the Merger and the
other transactions contemplated hereby. This Agreement has been duly and
validly executed and delivered by each of Parent and Merger Sub and (assuming
the due and valid authorization, execution and delivery of this Agreement by
the Company) constitutes a valid and binding obligation of each of Parent and
Merger Sub, enforceable against each of them in accordance with its terms,
except as limited by the Enforceability Exceptions.

 

Section 4.4. _Consents and Approvals; No Violations_. Except for
filings, permits, authorizations, consents and approvals set forth in Section

bylaws, or similar organizational documents, of Parent or Merger Sub, (ii)
require Parent or Merger Sub to make any notice to, or filing with, or obtain

action by any Person under, constitute a default, or an event that, with or
without notice, lapse of time or both, would constitute a default under, or
cause or permit the termination, cancellation or acceleration of any right or
obligation under, or the loss of a benefit under, any provision of
any Contract to which Parent or Merger Sub is a party, or result in the
creation or imposition of any Lien on any property, right or asset of Parent
or Merger Sub, with such exceptions, in the case of each of clauses (ii) and
(iii), as would not constitute a Parent Material Adverse Effect.

Section 4.5. _Information Supplied_. None of the written information
supplied or to be supplied by or on behalf of Parent or Merger Sub
specifically for inclusion or incorporation by reference in the Proxy
Statement will, at the time the Proxy Statement is first mailed to the
Companys stockholders or at the time of the Stockholders Meeting, contain any
untrue statement of a material fact or omit to state any material fact
required to be stated therein or necessary in order to make the statements
therein, in light of the circumstances under which they are made, not
misleading. Notwithstanding the foregoing, neither Parent nor Merger Sub makes
any representation or warranty with respect to statements made or incorporated
by reference in the Proxy Statement based on information supplied by or on
behalf of the Company or its Subsidiaries.

 

Section 4.6. _Litigation_. There is no Action pending or, to the
Knowledge of Parent, threatened in writing against Parent or any of its
Subsidiaries (including Merger Sub), or any of their properties, rights or
assets, for which an adverse result would constitute a Parent Material Adverse
Effect. There is no Order imposed upon or, to the Knowledge of Parent,
threatened in writing against Parent or any of its Subsidiaries (including
Merger Sub), or any of their properties, rights or assets, that constitutes a
Parent Material Adverse Effect.

 

Section 4.7. _Financing_.

 

(a) Parent is party to and has accepted a fully executed commitment letter,
dated July 2, 2017 (attached hereto as Exhibit C, together with all exhibits
or schedules thereto, the " _Debt Commitment Letter_ "), from the Lenders
party thereto pursuant to which the Lenders have agreed, subject to the terms
and conditions thereof, to provide the full amount of the debt financing set
forth therein. The debt financing committed pursuant to the Debt Commitment
Letter is collectively referred to in this Agreement as the " _Financing_."

 

(b) Parent and Merger Sub have delivered to the Company true, complete and
correct copies of the executed Debt Commitment Letter and any fee letters
related thereto, subject, in the case of such fee letters, to redaction solely
of fee and other economic provisions that are customarily redacted in
connection with transactions of this type and that do not adversely affect
the availability or amount of the Financing.

 



25 ##### Table of Contents

  

(c) Except as expressly set forth in the Debt Commitment Letter, as of
the date of this Agreement, there are no conditions precedent to the
obligations of the Lenders to provide the Financing or any contingencies that
would permit the Lenders to reduce the total amount of the Financing,
including any condition or other contingency relating to the availability of
the Financing pursuant to any "flex" provision. As of the date of this
Agreement, neither Parent nor Merger Sub has any reason to believe that it
will be unable to satisfy on a timely basis all terms and conditions to be
satisfied by it in the Debt Commitment Letter on or prior to the Closing Date,
nor does Parent or Merger Sub have knowledge that any of the Lenders will not
perform its obligations thereunder. As of the date of this Agreement, there
are no side letters, understandings or other agreements, contracts or
arrangements of any kind relating to the Debt Commitment Letter that could
adversely affect the availability of the Financing contemplated by the Debt
Commitment Letter.

(d) The Financing, when funded in accordance with the Debt Commitment
Letter, together with available cash at the Company and its Subsidiaries and
other available cash or other funds of Parent and its Subsidiaries, shall, in
the aggregate, provide Parent and its Subsidiaries with cash proceeds (after
netting out original issue discount and similar premiums and charges after
giving effect to the maximum amount of flex (including original issue discount
flex) provided under the Debt Commitment Letter and any related fee letter) on
the Closing Date sufficient for the satisfaction of all of Parents and
Merger Subs obligations under this Agreement and under the Debt Commitment
Letter, including the payment of the aggregate Merger Consideration (including
the amounts payable pursuant to Sections 2.7 and 2.8) and any fees and
expenses of or payable by Parent, Merger Sub or the Surviving Corporation, and
for any repayment or refinancing of any outstanding Indebtedness of Parent,
the Company and/or any of their respective Subsidiaries contemplated by this
Agreement or the Debt Commitment Letter.

(e) As of the date of this Agreement, the Debt Commitment Letter is (i) a
legal, valid, binding and enforceable obligation of Parent and, to the
Knowledge of Parent, of each of the other parties thereto (except as limited
by the Enforceability Exceptions) and (ii) in full force and effect. Assuming
satisfaction or waiver (to the extent permitted by Law) of the conditions to
Parents and Merger Subs obligations to consummate the Merger, as of the date
of this Agreement, (i) no event has occurred which (with or without notice,
lapse of time or both) would constitute a failure to satisfy a condition by
Parent under the terms and conditions of the Debt Commitment Letter and (ii)
neither Parent nor Merger Sub has any reason to believe that any of the
conditions to the Financing will not be satisfied by Parent on a timely basis
or that the Financing will not be available to Parent or one or more of its
Subsidiaries on the Closing Date. Parent has paid in full any and all
commitment fees or other fees required to be paid pursuant to the terms of
the Debt Commitment Letter on or before the date of this Agreement, and will
pay (or cause to be paid) in full any such amounts due on or before the
Closing Date. The Debt Commitment Letter has not been modified, amended or
altered as of the date of this Agreement and, as of the date of this
Agreement, none of the commitments under the Debt Commitment Letter has been
withdrawn or rescinded in any respect, and, to the Knowledge of Parent, no
withdrawal or rescission thereof is contemplated. To the Knowledge of Parent,
no modification of, or amendment to, the Debt Commitment Letter is currently
contemplated except for the addition of Lenders, lead arrangers, bookrunners,
agents or similar entities who have not executed the Debt Commitment Letter
as of the date hereof.

Parent or any other financing or other transactions be a condition to any of
Parents or Merger Subs obligations under this Agreement.

 

Section 4.8. _Share Ownership_. As of the date hereof, neither Parent
nor any of its Subsidiaries (including Merger Sub) is the beneficial owner of
any Share. As of the date hereof and at all times thereafter and prior to the
time that is immediately prior to the Effective Time, neither Parent nor any
of its Subsidiaries (including Merger Sub) is or will be an "interested
stockholder" (as defined in the Companys certificate of incorporation) (and

Affiliates other than those the fees and expenses of which will be paid by
Parent, Merger Sub or their Affiliates.

 

Section 4.10. _Solvency_. Neither Parent nor Merger Sub is entering into
the transactions contemplated by this Agreement with the actual intent to

Parent have been prepared in good faith based upon assumptions that were, at
the time made, and continue to be, at the Effective Time, reasonable, after
giving effect to all of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement,
including the Financing and the payment of the aggregate Merger Consideration
(including the amounts payable pursuant to Sections 2.7 and 2.8) and any
other repayment or refinancing of debt that may be required in connection with
the consummation of the Merger and the other transactions contemplated by this
Agreement, and payment of all related fees and expenses, the
Surviving Corporation and its Subsidiaries, taken as a whole, will be
Solvent. For purposes of this Section 4.10, the term " _Solvent_ " means, with
respect to any Person as of a particular date, that on such date, (a) the sum
of the assets, at a fair valuation, of such Person exceeds its debts, (b)
such Person has not incurred debts beyond its ability to pay such debts as
such debts mature, and (c) such Person does not have unreasonably small
capital with which to conduct its business. For purposes of this Section
4.10, "debt" means any liability whether or not reduced to judgment,
liquidated, unliquidated, fixed, contingent, matured, unmatured, disputed,
undisputed, legal, equitable, secured or unsecured.

destroy all confidential information furnished to such Person by or on
behalf of the Company in connection with any such Acquisition Proposal and
(y) not terminate, amend, release or modify any provision of any standstill
agreement to which it or any of its Subsidiaries is a party, except that the
Company may grant a limited waiver, amendment or release under any
confidentiality or standstill agreement to the extent necessary to allow for a
confidential Acquisition Proposal to be made to the Company or the Company
Board so long as the Company promptly (and in any event within twenty-four
(24) hours thereafter) notifies Parent thereof (including the identity of such
counterparty (except to the extent prohibited by any Contract in effect as of
the date hereof)) after granting any such limited waiver, amendment or
release as provided in Section 5.2(e).

(b) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in Section 5.2(a)
or elsewhere in this Agreement, at any time following the date hereof and
prior to the time the Stockholder Approval is obtained, if the Company
receives a written, unsolicited and _bona fide_ Acquisition Proposal that
did not result from a breach of this Section 5.2, the Company and its
Representatives may contact in writing the Person or group of Persons making
such written Acquisition Proposal to request clarification of the terms and
conditions thereof so as to determine whether such Acquisition Proposal
constitutes, or could reasonably be expected to result in, a Superior
Proposal, and may (i) provide information to such Person or group of Persons
if the Company has entered into with such Person or group of Persons a
confidentiality agreement containing terms that are not less favorable in any
material respect to the Company than those contained in the Confidentiality
Agreement, except that such confidentiality agreement need not contain any
standstill or similar provision (an " _Acceptable Confidentiality Agreement_
"); _provided_ , that the Company shall make available to Parent and Merger

that is provided to any such Person or group of Persons which was not
previously made available to Parent or Merger Sub substantially concurrently
(and in any event within twenty-four (24) hours thereafter), and (ii) engage
or participate in any discussions or negotiations with such Person or group of
Persons, if prior to taking any action described in clause (i) or (ii) above,

 Board determines in good faith after consultation with its financial advisor
and outside legal counsel that such Acquisition Proposal constitutes, or would
reasonably be expected to result in, a Superior Proposal and (B) the Company
Board determines in good faith after consultation with its outside legal
counsel that failure to take such action would be reasonably likely to be
inconsistent with its fiduciary obligations under applicable Law. It is
understood and agreed that any contacts, disclosures, discussions or
negotiations permitted under this Section 5.2(b) (including a public
announcement that the Company or the Company Board has made any
determination required under this Section 5.2(b) to take or engage in any
such actions ( _provided_ that the Company Board expressly publicly reaffirms
the Company Recommendation in connection with such disclosure)), shall not
constitute a Change of Recommendation or otherwise constitute a basis for
Parent to terminate this Agreement pursuant to Section 7.4.

 

(c) Except as set forth in this Section 5.2(c) or in Section 5.2(d),
neither the Company Board nor any committee thereof shall (1) withhold,

(5) fail to publicly reaffirm the Company Recommendation within ten (10)
Business Days of the public disclosure of an Acquisition Proposal (other than
of the type referred to in the following clause (6)) with any Person other
than Parent and Merger Sub (provided that if the Stockholders Meeting is
scheduled to be held within ten (10) Business Days from the date of such
public disclosure, promptly and in any event prior to the date which is
two (2) Business Days before the date on which the Stockholders Meeting is
scheduled to be held), or (6) fail to recommend, in a
Solicitation/Recommendation Statement on Schedule 14D-9 under the Exchange
Act, against any Acquisition Proposal that is a tender offer or exchange
offer subject to Regulation 14D promulgated under the Exchange Act within ten
(10) Business Days after the commencement (within the meaning of Rule 14d-2
under the Exchange Act) of such tender offer or exchange offer (or, if the
Stockholders Meeting is scheduled to be held within ten (10) Business Days
from the date of such commencement, promptly and in any event prior to the
date which is two (2) Business Days before the date on which the Stockholders
Meeting is scheduled to be held) (any of the foregoing, a " _Change of
Recommendation_ "); _provided_ , that any communication made in accordance
with Section 5.2(d)(ii), or the failure by the Company Board to take a
position with respect to an Acquisition Proposal referred to in the preceding
clause (5) or a tender offer or exchange offer referred to in the preceding
clause (6), shall not be deemed a Change of Recommendation if
such communication is made or such position is taken prior to the tenth
(10th) Business Day after the commencement (within the meaning of Rule 14d-2
under the Exchange Act) of such tender offer or exchange offer or the public
disclosure of such Acquisition Proposal, as applicable (or such earlier time
as referenced above). Notwithstanding the foregoing or anything to the
contrary set forth in this Agreement, prior to the time the Stockholder
Approval is obtained, the Company Board may (A) effect a Change of
Recommendation if the Company Board has received an unsolicited, written _bona
fide_ Acquisition Proposal after the date hereof that the Company Board has
determined in good faith, after consultation with its outside legal counsel
and financial advisor, constitutes a Superior Proposal and did not result from
a material breach by the Company of this Section 5.2 or (B) effect a Change of
Recommendation contemplated by clauses (1) or (2) of the definition thereof,
if, upon the occurrence of an Intervening Event, the

 Company Board has determined in good faith, after consultation with its
outside legal counsel, that failure to do so would be reasonably likely to be
inconsistent with its fiduciary obligations under applicable Law, and:

(i) the Company shall have provided prior written notice to Parent,
at least three (3) Business Days in advance, that it intends to effect a
Change of Recommendation (a " _Notice of Change of Recommendation_ "), which
notice shall specify in reasonable detail the basis for the Change of
Recommendation and, if the proposed Change of Recommendation is in response
to a Superior Proposal, the identity of the Person or group of Persons making
such Superior Proposal and the material terms thereof (containing a copy of
any proposed agreement in respect of the Superior Proposal that is the basis
of the proposed action of the Company Board (or, if there is no such proposed
agreement, a written summary of the material terms and conditions of the
Superior Proposal) and the identity of the party making such Superior
Proposal) or, if the proposed Change of Recommendation is in response to an
Intervening Event, reasonable detail regarding the Intervening Event;

 

(ii) after providing such notice and prior to effecting such Change of
Recommendation, the Company shall have negotiated with Parent and Merger Sub
in good faith (to the extent Parent and Merger Sub desire to negotiate) during
such three (3) Business Day period to make such adjustments in the terms and
conditions of this Agreement so that (A) the Superior Proposal ceases to be a
Superior Proposal or (B) the Change of Recommendation in response to the
Intervening Event is no longer applicable; and

 

(iii) following the end of such three (3) Business Day period, the Company
Board shall have determined in good faith, after consultation with its
outside legal counsel and, with respect to Clause (A) below, its financial
advisor, taking into account any changes to this Agreement proposed in writing
by Parent in response to the Notice of Change of Recommendation, that (A) the
Superior Proposal giving rise to the Notice of Change of Recommendation
continues to be a Superior Proposal or (B) in the case of an Intervening
Event, the failure of the Company Board to effect a Change of Recommendation
would continue to be reasonably likely to be inconsistent with its fiduciary
obligations under applicable Law.

 

Any amendment to the financial terms or any other material change to the terms
of a Superior Proposal shall require the Company to deliver a new Notice of
Change of Recommendation and the Company shall be required to comply again
with the requirements of clauses (i)-(iii) above; _provided_ , _however_ ,
that references to the three (3) Business Day period above shall then be
deemed to be references to a two (2) Business Day period following receipt by
Parent of any such new Notice of Change of Recommendation.

 

(d) Nothing contained in this Section 5.2 or elsewhere in this Agreement
shall be deemed to prohibit the Company or the Company Board or any committee
thereof from (i) complying with its disclosure obligations under applicable
Law or the NYSE, including taking and disclosing to its stockholders a
position contemplated by Rule 14d-9 or Rule 14e-2(a) under the Exchange Act
(or any similar communication to stockholders), or (ii) making any

 "stop-look-and-listen" communication to stockholders of the Company
pursuant to Rule 14d-9(f) under the Exchange Act (or any similar
communications to stockholders of the Company, including any such similar
communication in response to an Acquisition Proposal that is not a tender
offer or exchange offer); _provided_ , _however_ , that, (x) except as
provided in the next sentence, any disclosure made as permitted in clause (i)
of this Section 5.2(d) (other than any "stop-look-and-listen" or similar
communication) that relates to an Acquisition Proposal shall be deemed to be a
Change of Recommendation unless the Company Board expressly publicly
reaffirms the Company Recommendation in connection with such disclosure, and
(y) neither the Company nor the Company Board (or any committee thereof) shall
be permitted to recommend any Acquisition Proposal (including that the
stockholders of the Company tender any securities in connection with any
tender offer or exchange offer that is an Acquisition Proposal) or otherwise
effect a Change of Recommendation with respect thereto, except as permitted
by Section 5.2(c). It is understood and agreed that any "stop-look-and-
listen" or similar communication permitted under clause (ii) of this Section
5.2(d) made prior to the tenth (10th) Business Day after the commencement
(within the meaning of Rule 14d-2 under the Exchange Act) of such tender offer
or exchange offer (or, if earlier, no fewer than two (2) Business Days prior
to the date on which the Stockholders Meeting is scheduled to be held) shall
not constitute a Change of Recommendation or otherwise constitute a basis for
Parent to terminate this Agreement pursuant to Section 7.4. The Company shall
in no event be deemed to violate this Section 5.2 or to have effected a Change
of Recommendation as a result of responding to any unsolicited proposal or
inquiry solely by advising the Person making such proposal or inquiry of the
terms of this Section 5.2.

(e) The Company shall promptly (and, in any event, within twenty-four (24)
hours) notify Parent orally and in writing if, from and after the date hereof,
any Acquisition Proposal or Inquiry (including any request for non-public
information in connection therewith) is received by the Company, any of its
Subsidiaries or any of its or their Representatives, indicating (except to the
extent prohibited by any Contract in effect as of the date hereof) the
identity of the Person or group of Persons making such Acquisition Proposal,
Inquiry or request and the material terms and conditions of any such
Acquisition Proposal (including, if applicable, providing copies of any
written Inquiries and any proposed agreements related thereto), and
thereafter shall keep Parent reasonably informed of the status and material
terms of any such Acquisition Proposal, Inquiry or request (including any
material modifications or amendments thereto). Without limiting the foregoing,
the Company shall promptly (and in any event within twenty-four (24) hours)
notify Parent orally and in writing (i) if the Company determines to begin
providing non-public information or to engage in negotiations or
discussions concerning an Acquisition Proposal in accordance with Section
5.2(b) and (ii) thereafter of any change to the financial and other material
terms and conditions of any Acquisition Proposal and otherwise keep Parent
reasonably informed of the status and material terms of any such Inquiry,
Acquisition Proposal, discussions or negotiations on a reasonably current
basis, including by providing a copy of all proposals, offers or drafts of
proposed agreements. Neither the Company nor any of its Subsidiaries shall,
after the date of this Agreement, enter into any confidentiality or similar
agreement that would prohibit it from providing such information to Parent.

required by the Exchange Act in connection with the Merger and the other
transactions contemplated hereby, and Parent and the Company shall cooperate
with each other in connection with the preparation of the Proxy Statement and
any such other filings. Except as permitted by Section 5.2, the Proxy
Statement shall include the Company Recommendation; _provided_ , that if
the Company Board shall have effected a Change of Recommendation in
accordance with Section 5.2, then in submitting this Agreement to the
Companys stockholders, the Company Board may submit this Agreement to the
Companys stockholders without the Company Recommendation, in which event the
Company Board may communicate the basis for its lack of recommendation to the
Companys stockholders in the Proxy Statement or an appropriate amendment
thereof or supplement thereto. Parent agrees to provide or cause to be
provided all information with respect to itself, its Affiliates and their
respective Representatives as may be reasonably requested by the Company for

Statement or the transactions contemplated hereby. The Company shall use its
reasonable best efforts to (i) promptly provide responses to the SEC with
respect to all comments received on the Proxy Statement from the SEC (with
the assistance of, and after consultation with, Parent as provided by Section
5.3(c)), (ii) make any amendments or filings as may be necessary in connection
therewith and (iii) have the Proxy Statement cleared by the SEC staff as soon
as reasonably practical after such filing. The Company shall cause the
definitive Proxy Statement to be mailed as promptly as reasonably practicable

or that the Company may commence mailing the Proxy Statement.

(c) Subject to applicable Law, prior to filing or mailing the Proxy
Statement or filing any other required filings (or, in each case, any
amendment thereof or supplement thereto) or responding to any comments of the
SEC with respect thereto, the Company shall (unless and until a Change of
Recommendation has occurred or in connection with the matters described in
Section 5.2) provide Parent with an opportunity to review and comment on
(which comments shall be made promptly) such document or response and shall
consider in good faith including in such document or response comments
reasonably proposed by Parent.

(d) If, at any time prior to the receipt of the Stockholder Approval, any
information relating to the Company or Parent, or any of their respective
Affiliates, should be discovered by the Company or Parent which, in the
reasonable judgment of the Company or Parent, as the case may be, should
be set forth in an amendment of, or a supplement to, the Proxy Statement, so
that

 any of such documents would not contain any untrue statement of a material
fact or omit to state any material fact required to be stated therein or
necessary in order to make the statements therein, in light of the
circumstances under which they were made, not misleading, the party that
discovers such information shall promptly notify the other parties hereto, and
the Company and Parent shall cooperate in the prompt filing with the SEC of
any necessary amendment of, or supplement to, the Proxy Statement and, to the
extent required by applicable Law, in disseminating the information contained
in such amendment or supplement to the stockholders of the Company. Nothing in
this Section 5.3(d) shall limit the rights or obligations of any party under
any other paragraph of this Section 5.3.

in connection with the Merger will comply as to form and substance in all
material respects with the applicable requirements of the Exchange Act.

this Section 5.4, the " _Stockholders Meeting_ ") as promptly as reasonably
practicable following clearance of the Proxy Statement by the SEC to consider
and vote upon the adoption of this Agreement; _provided_ , that the Company
may postpone or adjourn to a later date the Stockholders Meeting (i) with the
written consent of Parent (which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld,
conditioned or delayed), (ii) for the absence of a quorum, (iii) to allow
reasonable additional time to solicit additional proxies to the extent the
Company reasonably believes necessary in order to obtain the Stockholder
Approval, whether or not a quorum is present, (iv) if required by applicable
Law or (v) to allow reasonable additional time for the filing and
dissemination of any supplemental or amended disclosure which the Company
Board has determined in good faith (after consultation with outside legal
counsel and subject to Section 5.3(c)) is necessary under applicable Law and
for such supplemental or amended disclosure to be disseminated and reviewed
by the Companys stockholders prior to the Stockholders Meeting to the extent
so determined to be necessary; _provided_ , _further_ , that in no event shall
the Stockholders Meeting be postponed or adjourned to a date that is more
than thirty (30) days after the date on which the Stockholders Meeting was
originally scheduled to be held without the prior written consent of Parent.
Unless there has been a Change of Recommendation pursuant to Section 5.2, the
Company shall use its reasonable best efforts to lawfully obtain the
Stockholder Approval, including actively soliciting proxies in favor of the
adoption of this Agreement at the Stockholders Meeting. Unless this Agreement
is terminated in accordance with its terms, the Company shall not submit to
the vote of its stockholders any other Acquisition Proposal.

 

(b) The Company shall keep Parent informed with respect to proxy
solicitation results as reasonably requested by Parent and shall provide such
information and reasonable cooperation as Parent may reasonably request in
connection therewith. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this
Agreement, unless this Agreement is terminated in accordance with its terms,
the Company shall remain obligated to provide the information and cooperation
described in the immediately preceding sentence and duly call, give notice of,
convene and hold the Stockholders Meeting and mail the Proxy Statement (and
any amendment or supplement thereto that maybe required by applicable Law) to
the Companys stockholders in accordance with Section 5.3 and this Section
5.4, notwithstanding any Change of Recommendation.

Effective Time (collectively, the " _Continuing Employees_ ") with (i) a base
salary or regular hourly wage (whichever is applicable) no lower than that in
effect for the applicable Continuing Employee as of immediately prior to the
Effective Time, (ii) an annual target cash incentive compensation opportunity
that is no less favorable than the annual target cash incentive compensation
opportunity in effect for the applicable Continuing Employee as of immediately
prior to the Effective Time, and (iii) other compensation opportunities
and employee benefits that are, in each case, no less favorable in the
aggregate than the other compensation opportunities and employee benefits,
respectively, provided to the applicable Continuing Employee as of immediately
prior to the Effective Time, it being understood that the Surviving
Corporation may provide cash incentive compensation opportunities in lieu of
equity compensation awards.

 Effective as of the Effective Time, the Surviving Corporation hereby
expressly assumes the Company Benefit Plans and agrees to perform the
obligations of the Company thereunder in accordance with the terms and
conditions thereof (including the amendment and termination provisions).

(b) Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, during the
Continuation Period, the Surviving Corporation shall provide each Continuing
Employee whose employment is terminated by Parent or one of its Subsidiaries
with severance in amounts and on terms and conditions that are no less
favorable than the severance protections provided to each such Continuing
Employee under the Company Benefit Plans as of the date of this Agreement (or,
if greater, those applicable to similarly situated employees of Parent).

 

(c) Parent will cause any employee benefit plans of Parent and its
Subsidiaries in which the Continuing Employees are entitled to participate
after the Closing Date to take into account for purposes of eligibility,
vesting and benefit accruals (other than benefit accruals under any defined
benefit pension plan, for purposes of any retiree medical or retiree
life insurance plan, or as would result in a duplication of benefits),
service prior to the Effective Time by such employees to the Company and its
Subsidiaries (and any predecessors) as if such service were with Parent or its
Subsidiaries.

 

(d) With respect to any employee benefit plans maintained by Parent and its
Subsidiaries for the benefit of the Continuing Employees following the
Closing Date, Parent shall, and shall cause the Surviving Corporation and its
Subsidiaries to, (i) waive any eligibility requirements or pre-existing
condition limitations or waiting period requirements with respect to any such
plan providing medical, dental, pharmaceutical or vision benefits to any
Continuing Employee to the same extent waived under the analogous Company
Benefit Plan prior to the Closing Date, and (ii) give effect, in determining
any deductible, co-insurance and maximum out-of-pocket limitations, to
any eligible expenses paid by such employees during the calendar year in
which the Effective Time occurs under analogous Company Benefit Plans.

 

(e) Immediately prior to the Effective Time, the Company shall pay to each
employee of the Company who is employed as of immediately prior to the
Effective Time and who is then participating in any bonus plans or incentive
plans maintained by the Company with respect to the Companys fiscal year
during which the Closing occurs (the " _Annual Bonus Plans_ "), a prorated
bonus under the Annual Bonus Plans for the period from the beginning of such
fiscal year through the Closing Date (the " _Bonus Period_ ") equal to the
greater of (i) such employees bonus entitlement for the Bonus Period under
the Annual Bonus Plans based on the actual level of achievement of the
applicable performance goals for the period beginning on the first day of such
fiscal year and ending as of the end of the month immediately preceding the
month in which the Effective Time occurs (excluding costs relating to the
Merger, as applicable), as determined by the Company Board in its sole
discretion and (ii) such employees bonus entitlement for the Bonus Period
under the Annual Bonus Plans assuming target performance through the Closing
Date. The Surviving Corporation shall establish bonus plans or incentive plans
with respect to the remainder of the fiscal year in which the Effective Time
occurs on terms consistent with Section 5.8(a).

(f) Nothing in this Agreement shall confer upon any Continuing Employee
or other service provider any right to continue in the employ or service of
Parent, the Surviving Corporation or any Affiliate of Parent, or shall
interfere with or restrict in any way the rights of Parent, the Surviving
Corporation or any of their respective Affiliates, which rights are hereby
expressly reserved, to discharge or terminate the services of any Continuing
Employee at any time for any reason whatsoever, with or without cause. In no
event shall the terms of this Agreement be deemed to (i) establish, amend, or
modify any Company Benefit Plan or any other employee benefit plan, program,
agreement or arrangement maintained or sponsored by Parent, the Surviving
Corporation or their Affiliates, or (ii) alter or limit the ability of
Parent, the Surviving Corporation or any of their respective Subsidiaries or
Affiliates to amend, modify or terminate any Company Benefit Plan in
accordance with its terms after the Closing Date. Without limiting Section
8.9, nothing in this Section 5.8 shall create any third party beneficiary
rights in any Continuing Employee or current or former service provider of the
Company or its Affiliates (or any beneficiaries or dependents thereof).

 

Section 5.9. _Expenses_. Except as otherwise provided in this
Agreement, whether or not the Merger is consummated all costs and expenses
incurred in connection with this Agreement and the Merger and the other
transactions contemplated by this Agreement shall be paid by the party
incurring such expense.

 

Section 5.10. _Indemnification; Directors  and Officers Insurance_.

(a) From and after the Effective Time, Parent shall cause the Surviving
Corporation to, and the Surviving Corporation shall, indemnify and hold
harmless, to the fullest extent permitted under applicable Law, each present
and former director and officer of the Company and its Subsidiaries and each
fiduciary of a Company Benefit Plan (collectively, together with such
persons heirs, executors or administrators, the " _Indemnified Parties_ ")
against any costs or expenses (including reasonable attorneys fees),
judgments, fines, losses, claims, damages, liabilities and amounts paid in
settlement incurred in connection with any actual or threatened Action,
whether civil, criminal, administrative or investigative, arising out of,
related to or in connection with any action or omission occurring or alleged
to have occurred whether before or at the Effective Time (including in
connection with such Indemnified Parties service as a director or officer of
the Company or any of its Subsidiaries or a fiduciary of a Company Benefit
Plan), whether asserted or claimed prior to, at or after the Effective Time
including, for the avoidance of doubt, in connection with (i) the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement and (ii) actions to enforce this provision or
any other indemnification, exculpation or advancement right of any
Indemnified Party. Without limiting the foregoing, Parent, for a period of six
(6) years from and after the Effective Time, shall cause, unless otherwise
required by applicable Law, the Charter and Bylaws to contain provisions no
less favorable to the Indemnified Parties with respect to limitation of
liabilities of directors and officers and indemnification than those set forth
as of the date of this Agreement in the certificate of incorporation and
bylaws of the Company, which provisions shall not be amended, repealed or
otherwise modified in a manner that would adversely affect the rights
thereunder of the Indemnified Parties. In addition, from and after the
Effective Time, each of Parent and the Surviving Corporation shall advance
costs and expenses (including attorneys fees) as incurred by any Indemnified
Party promptly (and in any event within ten (10) days) after receipt by Parent
of a written request for such advance to the fullest extent permitted under
applicable Law; provided, that the Person to whom expenses

 



44 ##### Table of Contents

  

 are advanced provides an undertaking to repay such advances if it is
ultimately determined (after exhausting all available appeals) that such
Person is not entitled to indemnification. Any Indemnified Party wishing to
claim indemnification under this Section 5.10(a), upon learning of any claim,
action or proceeding in respect of which such indemnification will be sought,
shall notify the Surviving Corporation thereof in writing;  _provided_ , that
the failure to so notify the Surviving Corporation shall not affect the
indemnification obligations of the Surviving Corporation or Parent under this
Section 5.10(a), except to the extent such failure to notify
materially prejudices the Surviving Corporation.

(b) Prior to the Effective Time, the Company shall obtain (and,
following the Effective Time, the Surviving Corporation shall, and Parent
shall cause the Surviving Corporation to, maintain with reputable and
financially sound carriers) and fully pre-pay the premium for the
extension of (i) the directors and officers liability coverage of the
Companys existing directors and officers insurance policies, and (ii) the
Companys existing fiduciary liability insurance policies, in each case for a
claims reporting or discovery period (whichever is greater) of six (6) years
from and after the Effective Time with respect to any claim arising from facts
or events that existed or occurred at or prior to the Effective
Time (collectively, " _D andO Insurance_") with terms, conditions, retentions,
coverage limits and limits of liability that are at least as favorable as the
coverage provided under the Companys existing policies in effect on the
date hereof. If the Company and the Surviving Corporation for any reason fail
to obtain such "tail" insurance policies as of the Effective Time, the
Surviving Corporation shall, and Parent shall cause the Surviving Corporation
to, continue to maintain in effect for a period of six (6) years from and
after the Effective Time the DandO Insurance in place as of the date hereof with
terms, conditions, retentions, coverage limits and limits of liability that
are at least as favorable as the coverage provided in the Companys existing
policies as of the date hereof. In lieu of the foregoing described in this
Section 5.10(b) at Parents election in its sole discretion, the Surviving
Corporation shall, and Parent shall cause the Surviving Corporation to,
purchase comparable DandO Insurance for such six-year period with terms,
conditions, retentions and limits of liability that are at least as favorable
as the coverage provided under the Companys existing policies as of the date
hereof. Notwithstanding the foregoing, (x) in no event shall the Company or
the Surviving Corporation be required to expend for any such policies pursuant
to this Section 5.10(b) an annual premium amount in excess of 300% of the
aggregate of the annual premiums currently paid by the Company for such
insurance, and (y) if the annual premiums of such insurance coverage exceed
such maximum amount, the Company or the Surviving Corporation shall obtain a
policy with the greatest coverage available for such maximum amount.

 

(c) If Parent or the Surviving Corporation or any of their successors or
assigns shall (i) consolidate with or merge into any other corporation or
entity and shall not be the continuing or surviving corporation or entity of
such consolidation or merger or (ii) transfer all or substantially all of its
properties and assets to any individual, corporation or other entity, then,
in each such case, proper provisions shall be made so that such surviving or
acquiring Person(s), as the case may be, shall assume all of the obligations
set forth in this Section 5.10.

 

(d) The provisions of this Section 5.10 are intended to be for the benefit
of, and shall be enforceable by, each of the Indemnified Parties.

 



45 ##### Table of Contents

  

(e) The rights of the Indemnified Parties under this Section 5.10 shall be
in addition to any rights such Indemnified Parties may have under the
certificate of incorporation or bylaws or comparable governing documents of
the Company or any of its Subsidiaries, under any applicable Contracts or Laws
or otherwise. All rights to indemnification, exculpation from liabilities for
acts or omissions occurring at or prior to the Effective Time and rights to
advancement of expenses relating thereto now existing in favor of any
Indemnified Party (whether asserted or claimed prior to, at or after the
Effective Time) as provided in the certificate of incorporation or bylaws or
comparable governing documents of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries or
any Contract or otherwise between such Indemnified Party and the Company or
any of its Subsidiaries shall survive the Merger and continue in full force
and effect (and shall be so maintained) and shall not be amended, repealed or
otherwise modified in any manner that would adversely affect any
right thereunder of any such Indemnified Party. Nothing in this Agreement is
intended to, shall be construed to or shall release, waive or impair any
rights to insurance claims under any policy that is or has been in existence
with respect to the Company or any of its Subsidiaries or any Indemnified
Party, it being understood and agreed that the indemnification provided for in
this Section 5.10 is not prior to, or in substitution for, any such claims
under any such policies.

 

Section 5.11. _Section 16 Matters_. Prior to the Effective Time,
the Company shall take all steps reasonably necessary to cause any
dispositions of equity securities (including derivative securities) of the
Company in connection with this Agreement and the transactions contemplated
hereby by each individual who is a director or officer of the Company to be
exempt under Rule 16b-3 promulgated under the Exchange Act.

 

Section 5.12. _Financing_.

 

(a) Parent and Merger Sub shall use reasonable best efforts to take, or
cause to be taken, all actions, and shall use reasonable best efforts to do,
or cause to be done, all things necessary, proper or advisable to obtain the
proceeds of the Financing on the terms and conditions described in the Debt
Commitment Letter (including, as necessary, the "flex" provisions contained
in any related fee letter) as promptly as possible but in any event prior to
the date upon which the Merger is required to be consummated pursuant to the
terms hereof, including by using its reasonable best efforts to (i) maintain
in effect the Debt Commitment Letter and comply with its obligations
thereunder in all material respects, (ii) negotiate definitive agreements with
respect to the Financing (the " _Definitive Agreements_ ") consistent with
the terms and conditions contained in the Debt Commitment Letter (including,
as necessary, the "flex" provisions contained in any related fee letter) or,
if available, on other terms that (A) are acceptable to Parent in its sole
discretion, (B) would not reasonably be expected to delay (taking into account
the expected timing of the Marketing Period) or adversely affect the ability
of Parent to consummate the transactions contemplated hereby and (C) would
otherwise be permitted by Section 5.12(b) and comply with its obligations
thereunder, and (iii) taking into account the expected timing of the Marketing
Period, satisfy (or, if reasonably required to obtain the Financing, seek the
waiver of) on a timely basis all conditions in the Debt Commitment Letter and
the Definitive Agreements that are within the control of Parent and its
Subsidiaries. In the event that all conditions contained in the Debt
Commitment Letter or the Definitive Agreements (except those that, by their
nature, are to be satisfied at the Closing) have been satisfied or waived,
Parent and Merger Sub shall use their reasonable best efforts to cause the 

 



46 ##### Table of Contents

  

 Lenders thereunder to comply with their respective obligations, including to
fund the Financing required to consummate the transactions contemplated by
this Agreement and to pay related fees and expenses on the Closing Date. Each
of Parent and Merger Sub shall use its reasonable best efforts to comply with
its respective obligations, and enforce its respective rights, under the Debt
Commitment Letter and Definitive Agreements in a timely and diligent manner.
Parent and Merger Sub shall give the Company prompt notice of any material
breach by any party to the Debt Commitment Letter or Definitive Agreements of
which Parent or Merger Sub, as applicable, has obtained Knowledge.

 

(b) Neither Parent nor Merger Sub shall, without the prior written consent
of the Company: (i) permit any amendment or modification to, or any waiver of
any provision or remedy under, the Debt Commitment Letter (including any
amendment to add Lenders, lead arrangers, bookrunners, agents or similar
entities who have not executed the Debt Commitment Letter as of the date
hereof) if such amendment, modification, waiver or remedy (A) adds any new (or
adversely modifies any existing) conditions to the consummation of all or any
portion of the Financing, (B) reduces the amount of the Financing to an
amount that, together with available cash at the Company and its Subsidiaries
and other available cash or other funds of Parent and its Subsidiaries, would
on the Closing Date be less than the amount required to consummate
the transactions contemplated hereby, (C) adversely affects in a material
respect the ability of Parent or Merger Sub, as applicable, to enforce its
rights against the other parties to the Debt Commitment Letter or the
Definitive Agreements, in each case, as so amended, replaced, supplemented or
otherwise modified, relative to the ability of Parent or Merger Sub, as
applicable, to enforce its rights against the other parties to the Debt
Commitment Letter as in effect on the date hereof or (D) could otherwise
reasonably be expected to prevent, materially impede or materially delay the
consummation of the Merger and the other transactions contemplated by this
Agreement (taking into account the expected timing of the Marketing Period);
or (ii) terminate the Debt Commitment Letter unless such Debt Commitment
Letter is replaced at such time with a new commitment letter that would
satisfy the preceding clause (i). Parent and Merger Sub shall promptly deliver
to the Company copies of any amendment, modification, waiver or replacement
of the Debt Commitment Letter.

(c) In the event that any portion of the Financing becomes unavailable,
regardless of the reason therefor, Parent and Merger Sub will (i) use
reasonable best efforts to obtain alternative debt financing (in an amount
sufficient, when taken together with the available portion of the Financing,
available cash at the Company and its Subsidiaries and other available funds
or cash to Parent and its Subsidiaries, to consummate the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement and to pay related fees and expenses) from the
same or other sources on terms and conditions that are not less favorable to
Parent and its Subsidiaries than the terms and conditions contemplated in the
Debt Commitment Letter as of the date hereof, and which do not include
any terms or conditions to the consummation of such alternative debt
financing that would reasonably be expected to make the funding of such
alternative debt financing less likely to occur than the conditions set forth
in the Debt Commitment Letter as of the date hereof, and (ii) promptly notify
the Company of such unavailability and the reason therefor. For the purposes
of this Agreement, the term "Debt Commitment Letter" shall be deemed to
include any commitment letter (or similar agreement) with respect to any
alternative or replacement financing arranged in compliance herewith (and any
Debt Commitment Letter remaining in effect at the time in question). Parent
and Merger Sub shall provide the Company with prompt 

 



47 ##### Table of Contents

  

 oral and written notice of any breach or default by any party to the Debt
Commitment Letter or any Definitive Agreement of which Parent or Merger Sub
obtain Knowledge and the receipt of any written notice or other written
communication from any Lender with respect to any breach, default, termination
or repudiation by any party to the Debt Commitment Letter or any Definitive
Agreement of any provision thereof. Parent and Merger Sub shall keep the
Company reasonably informed on a current basis of the status of its efforts to
consummate the Financing. The foregoing notwithstanding, and without limiting
the effect of Section 7.5(f) and Section 8.7, compliance by Parent and Merger
Sub with this Section 5.12 shall not relieve Parent and Merger Sub of their
obligations to consummate the transactions contemplated by this Agreement
whether or not the Financing is available. Without limiting the effect
of Section 7.5(f) and Section 8.7, in no event shall the receipt or
availability of any funds or financing (including, for the avoidance of doubt,
the Financing) by Parent or any Affiliate of Parent or any other financing or
other transactions be a condition to any of Parents or Merger Subs
obligations under this Agreement.

 

Section 5.13. _Financing Cooperation_.

 

(a) Prior to the Closing, the Company shall use its reasonable best efforts
to, and shall cause its Subsidiaries to use their reasonable best efforts to,
and shall use its reasonable efforts to cause its and their Representatives
to, provide all cooperation reasonably requested by Parent necessary and
customary for the arrangement of the Financing ( _provided_ , that such
requested cooperation does not unreasonably interfere with the ongoing
operations of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries), including by (i) if
requested by Parent, participating in a reasonable number of meetings
(including meetings with prospective Lenders), presentations, road shows, due
diligence sessions and sessions with rating agencies, at reasonable times and
with reasonable advance notice, (ii) to the extent required by the Financing
and requested by Parent, using reasonable efforts to facilitate the pledging
of, and perfection of security interests in, collateral, effective no earlier
than the Effective Time, (iii) furnishing Parent and the Lenders as promptly
as reasonably practicable following the delivery of a request therefor to the
Company by Parent (which notice shall state with specificity the information
requested) such financial and other information regarding the Company as is
readily available to the Company at such time and is customarily required in
connection with the execution of financings of a type similar to the
Financing, including the financial statements of the Company and its
consolidated Subsidiaries required by condition paragraph 4 in Exhibit C to
the Debt Commitment Letter (such financial statements, the " _Required
Financial Information_ "), (iv) if requested by Parent, using reasonable best
efforts to assist Parent in connection with Parents preparation of customary
pro forma financial statements as required by condition paragraph 5 in Exhibit
C to the Debt Commitment Letter; _provided_ , that (x) Parent shall be
responsible for the preparation of such pro forma financial statements and
any pro forma adjustments giving effect to the Merger and the other
transactions contemplated herein and (y) the Companys assistance shall relate
solely to the financial information and data derived from the
Companys historical books and records, (v) in each case following Parents
reasonable request, using reasonable best efforts to assist Parent and Merger
Sub in the preparation of (A) confidential information memoranda (including a
version that does not include material non-public information) and other
customary marketing materials required in connection with financings similar
to the Financing, (B) materials for rating agency presentations and (C)
definitive documentation for the Financing, (vi) following Parents reasonable
request, using reasonable best efforts to cause directors and officers who
will continue to hold such offices and positions from and after the Effective
Time to execute

 



48 ##### Table of Contents

become effective until the Effective Time with respect to entering into the
definitive documentation for the Financing and otherwise as necessary to
authorize consummation of the Financing, and (vii) if requested by Parent,
provide, at least two (2) Business Days prior to the Closing Date, all
documentation and other information as is required by applicable "know your
customer" and anti-money laundering rules and regulations including the USA
PATRIOT Act to the extent requested by Parent in writing at least nine (9)
Business Days prior to the anticipated Closing Date. Notwithstanding anything
to the contrary contained in this Section 5.13 or otherwise, neither the
Company nor any of its Subsidiaries shall be required to take or permit the
taking of any action pursuant to this Section 5.13 that would: (i)
require the Company, its Subsidiaries or any Persons who are directors or
officers of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries to pass resolutions or
consents to approve or authorize the execution of the Financing that is
effective prior to the Effective Time or execute or deliver any certificate,
opinion, document, instrument or agreement or agree to any change or
modification of any existing certificate, opinion, document, instrument or
agreement that is effective prior to the Effective Time, (ii) cause any
representation or warranty in this Agreement to be breached by the Company or
any of its Subsidiaries, (iii) require the Company or any of its Subsidiaries
to pay any commitment or other similar fee or incur any other expense,
liability or obligation in connection with the Financing prior to the Closing
or have any obligation of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries under any
certificate, document, instrument or agreement be effective until the
Closing, (iv) cause any director, officer employee or stockholder of the
Company or any of its Subsidiaries to incur any personal liability, (v)
conflict with the organizational documents of the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries or any Laws, (vi) reasonably be expected to result in a material
violation or breach of, or a default (with or without notice, lapse of time,
or both) under, any Contract to which the Company or any of its Subsidiaries
is a party, (vii) provide access to or disclose information that the Company
or any of its Subsidiaries determines would jeopardize any attorney-client
privilege or other applicable privilege of the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries, (viii) require the Company or any of its Subsidiaries to

it and prepared in the ordinary course of its financial reporting practice and
(b) would not otherwise be available to it or capable of being prepared by it
without undue burden or otherwise with the use of its commercially reasonable
efforts or (ix) require the Company or any of its Subsidiaries to enter into
any instrument or agreement that is effective prior to the occurrence of the
Closing or that would be effective if the Closing does not occur. Nothing
contained in this Section 5.13 or otherwise shall require the Company or any
of its Subsidiaries, prior to the Closing, to be an issuer or other obligor
with respect to the Financing. Parent shall, promptly upon request by the
Company, reimburse the Company for all reasonable out-of-pocket costs incurred
by the Company or any of its Subsidiaries or their respective Representatives
in connection with the arrangement of the Financing and any action taken by
them pursuant to this Section 5.13 and shall indemnify and hold harmless the
Company and its Subsidiaries and their respective Representatives from and
against any and all losses suffered or incurred by them in connection with the
arrangement of the Financing, any action taken by them at the request of
Parent pursuant to this Section 5.13 and any information used in connection
therewith (other than information provided in writing by the Company or its
Subsidiaries specifically in connection with its obligations pursuant to this
Section 5.13).

 

(b) The Company shall use its reasonable best efforts to deliver or cause
to be delivered to Parent on or prior to the second (2nd) Business Day prior
to the Effective Time, a

 



49 ##### Table of Contents

  

 copy of a payoff letter (subject to delivery of funds as arranged by
Parent), in customary form and substance, from the Administrative Agent (as
defined in the Specified Credit Agreement) under the Specified Credit
Agreement. The Company shall, and shall cause its Subsidiaries, as applicable,
to, deliver all notices (which notices shall be subject to the consummation of
the Financing) and take all other reasonable actions required to facilitate
the termination of commitments under the Specified Credit Agreement, the
repayment in full of all Obligations (as defined in the Specified Credit
Agreement, but other than contingent obligations for which no claim has been
made and any other obligations that survive the termination of the Specified
Credit Agreement pursuant to the terms thereof) then outstanding thereunder
and the release of any Liens and termination of all guarantees (if any) in
connection therewith, in each case, on the Closing Date in connection with
such repayment (each such termination, repayment or release, a " _Credit
Agreement Termination_ "); _provided_ that (x) in no event shall this Section
5.13(b) require the Company or any of its Subsidiaries to cause any Credit
Agreement Termination unless the Closing shall have occurred and (y) Parent
shall provide, or cause to be provided, all funds required to effect all such
repayments and cash collateralization, backstop or replacement of letters of
credit.

(c) If requested by Parent in writing, the Company shall use its
reasonable best efforts to, and shall cause its Subsidiaries to use their
reasonable best efforts to, (i) issue one or more notices of optional
redemption (including, if and to the extent permitted under the Existing
Notes and Existing Indenture, any notice to extend the redemption date) for
all of the outstanding aggregate principal amount of the Existing Notes
pursuant to the Existing Indenture, in order to effect a redemption of the
Existing Notes on (or at Parents election, following) the Closing Date;
_provided_ that such redemption notice shall provide that the obligation to
redeem the Existing Notes shall be subject to and conditioned upon the
occurrence of the Closing Date and the deposit of funds contemplated in the
next sentence, and (ii) provide any other cooperation reasonably requested by
Parent to facilitate the redemption of the Existing Notes (and/or, if elected
by Parent, satisfaction and discharge of the Existing Notes and the Existing
Indenture) effective as of (or at Parents election, following) and
conditioned upon the occurrence of the Closing Date (including delivering any
notices, requests, certificates and legal opinions or orders required to be
delivered to the trustee under the Existing Indenture in connection with the
notice of optional redemption or satisfaction and discharge (but solely to the
extent such notices, requests, certificates, opinions and orders would
not conflict with applicable Law and would be accurate in light of the facts
and circumstances at the time delivered)). The Company shall provide Parent
with a reasonable opportunity to review and comment on such notices, requests,
certificates and orders and any other document that purports to effect, amend
or modify the terms of the redemption. Parent shall deposit, or cause to be
deposited, funds with the Existing Notes Trustee sufficient to fund the
Discharge no later than the redemption time specified in the applicable
redemption notice, or, in the case of a satisfaction and discharge, the time
of such satisfaction and discharge (in each case, subject to the occurrence of
the Closing Date and the receipt by Parent of financing in an amount
sufficient to effect such redemption in full). The redemption (or, if
applicable, satisfaction and discharge) of the Existing Notes and Existing
Indenture pursuant to this Section 5.13(c), and the release of all guarantees
in connection therewith, are referred to collectively as the " _Discharge_."

(d) For the avoidance of doubt, the parties hereto acknowledge and agree
that the provisions contained in this Section 5.13 represent the sole
obligation of the Company, its

 Subsidiaries and their respective Representatives with respect to
cooperation in connection with the arrangement of any financing (including any
Financing) to be obtained by Parent, Merger Sub or any of their Affiliates
with respect to the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, the Discharge
and the repayment of the Specified Credit Agreement and no other provision of
this Agreement (including the Exhibits and Schedules hereto) shall be deemed
to expand or modify such obligations.

(e) All non-public or otherwise confidential information regarding the
Company or its Subsidiaries obtained by Parent or its Representatives pursuant
to this Section 5.13 shall be kept confidential and otherwise treated in
accordance with the Confidentiality Agreement or other confidentiality
obligations that are substantially similar to those contained in the
Confidentiality Agreement (which, with respect to the Lenders, shall be
satisfied by the confidentiality provisions applicable thereto under the Debt
Commitment Letter). The Company hereby consents to the use of its and its
Subsidiaries logos in connection with the Financing; _provided_ , that such
logos are used solely in a manner that is reasonable and customary and that is
not reasonably likely to harm or disparage the Company or its Subsidiaries in
any respect.

 

Section 5.14. _Transaction Litigation_. The Company, on the one hand,
and Parent and Merger Sub, on the other hand, shall keep the other reasonably
informed on a current basis with respect to any Transaction Litigation,
reasonably consult with the other and give consideration to the others advice
regarding such Transaction Litigation, and give each other the opportunity to
participate in the defense, settlement or prosecution of any Transaction
Litigation; _provided_ , that (x) the Company shall in any event control such
defense, settlement or prosecution and (y) and the disclosure of information
in connection therewith shall be subject to the provisions of Section 5.6,
including regarding attorney-client privilege or other applicable privilege;
_provided_ , _further_ , that neither party shall compromise, settle, come to
an arrangement regarding or agree to compromise, settle or come to an
arrangement regarding any Transaction Litigation or consent to the same unless
the other party shall have consented in writing (such consent not to be
unreasonably withheld, delayed or conditioned).

 

Section 5.15. _Resignation of Directors_. At the Closing, except
as otherwise may be agreed by Parent, the Company shall use its reasonable
best efforts to deliver to Parent the resignation of all members of the
Company Board who are in office immediately prior to the Effective Time, which
resignations shall be effective as of immediately prior to (but conditioned
on the occurrence of) the Effective Time.

 

Section 5.16. _State Takeover Statutes_. The Company and the Company
Board shall (a) take all action necessary to ensure that no Takeover Statute
is or becomes applicable to the Merger and (b) if any Takeover Statute becomes
applicable to the Merger, take all action necessary to ensure that the Merger
may be consummated as promptly as practicable on the terms contemplated by
this Agreement and otherwise to eliminate or minimize the effect of such
Takeover Statute on the Merger.

 

Section 5.17. _Conduct of Parent and Merger Sub_. During the period from
the date hereof until the Effective Time (or such earlier date on which this
Agreement may be terminated), except (x) as required by applicable Law or (y)

Section 8.7. _Specific Performance_. The parties agree that
irreparable damage for which monetary damages, even if available, would not
be an adequate remedy, would occur in the event that the parties hereto do not
perform the provisions of this Agreement in accordance with its specified
terms or otherwise breach or threaten to breach such provisions. The parties
acknowledge and agree that, subject in all respects to the terms and
conditions of this Section 8.7, the parties hereto shall be entitled, in

breaches or threatened breaches of this Agreement and to enforce specifically

injunction. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement, the

hereof. If any provision of this Agreement, or the application thereof to any
Person or any circumstance, is determined by a court of competent
jurisdiction to be invalid or unenforceable, (a) a suitable and equitable
provision shall be substituted therefor in order to carry out, so far as may

enforceable by the parties and their respective permitted successors and
assigns. Notwithstanding the foregoing, Parent and Merger Sub may assign
their respective rights and obligations hereunder to a wholly owned Subsidiary
of Parent without such consent; _provided_ , that no such assignment shall (a)
adversely impact the Company or the holders of Shares or Company Equity
Awards or (b) relieve Parent or Merger Sub of their respective obligations
under this Agreement.

 _Execution Version_ 

 

 _VOTING AGREEMENT_

 

VOTING AGREEMENT, dated as of July 2, 2017 (this " _Agreement_ "), by and
between Red Ventures Holdco, LP (" _Parent_ "), a North Carolina limited
partnership, and Ben Holding S.a r.l. (the " _Stockholder_ ").

 

WHEREAS, concurrently herewith, Bankrate, Inc., a Delaware corporation (the "
_Company_ "), Parent and Baton Merger Corp., a Delaware corporation and an
indirect wholly owned Subsidiary of Parent (" _Merger Sub_ "), are entering
into an Agreement and Plan of Merger (as it may be amended or modified from
time to time, the " _Merger Agreement_ ") pursuant to which Merger Sub will
merge with and into the Company on the terms and conditions set forth therein,
with the Company surviving such merger (the " _Merger_ ") and, in connection
therewith, the shares of common stock, par value $0.01 per share, of the
Company (" _Company Common Stock_ ") issued and outstanding immediately prior
to the Effective Time, other than Excluded Shares, will, without any further
action on the part of the holder thereof, be cancelled and extinguished and
automatically converted into the right to receive the Merger Consideration as
set forth in the Merger Agreement;

 

WHEREAS, as of the date hereof, the Stockholder is the record or beneficial
owner of, and has the right to vote and dispose of, certain shares of Company
Common Stock (such Company Common Stock, together with any other capital stock
of the Company acquired by the Stockholder after the date hereof, whether
acquired directly or indirectly, upon the exercise of options, conversion
of convertible securities, upon a stock dividend or distribution, upon a
split-up, reverse stock split, recapitalization, combination, reclassification
or otherwise, and any other securities issued by the Company that are entitled
to vote on the adoption of the Merger Agreement held or acquired by the
Stockholder and which the Stockholder has the right to vote and dispose of,
being collectively referred to herein as the " _Shares_ ");

 

WHEREAS, obtaining the Stockholder Approval is a condition to the consummation
of the Merger; and

 

WHEREAS, as an inducement to Parent to enter into the Merger Agreement and
incur the obligations therein, Parent has required that the Stockholder enter
into this Agreement.

NOW, THEREFORE, in consideration of the foregoing, the mutual covenants and
agreements set forth herein, and other good and valuable consideration, the
receipt and sufficiency of which is hereby acknowledged, the parties hereto
agree as follows:

 

Section 1. _Agreement to Vote; Restrictions on Voting and Dispositions_.

 

(a) _Agreement to Vote Company Common Stock_. The Stockholder hereby
irrevocably and unconditionally agrees that from the date hereof until the
Expiration Time, at any meeting (whether annual or special and each adjourned
or postponed meeting) of the Companys stockholders, however called, or in
connection with any written consent of the Companys stockholders, the
Stockholder will (x) appear at such meeting or otherwise cause all of the
Shares to be counted as present thereat for purposes of calculating a quorum
and (y) vote or cause to be voted (including by written consent,
if applicable) all of the Shares, (1) in favor of ##### Table of Contents

  

 the adoption of the Merger Agreement, the Merger and the other transactions
contemplated by the Merger Agreement, including any proposal to adjourn or
postpone such meeting of the Companys stockholders (which is not opposed by
Parent) to a later date if there are not sufficient votes to adopt the Merger
Agreement on the date on which such meeting is held, (2) against any other
Acquisition Proposal and (3) against any other action or agreement that would
reasonably be expected to result in a material breach of any covenant,
agreement, representation or warranty or other obligation of the Company set
forth in the Merger Agreement or prevent, materially impair or materially
delay the consummation of the Merger. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary
contained in this Agreement, the aggregate number of Shares subject to this
Section 1(a) shall be automatically reduced (on a pro rata basis with
each other stockholder of the Company who has executed a similar voting
agreement with Parent in connection with the Merger Agreement and the
transactions contemplated thereby, if any (the " _Other Voting Agreements_ "))
to the extent necessary in order that the aggregate number of Shares subject
to this Section 1(a), together with all other shares of Company Common Stock
(and any other voting securities of the Company) subject to the Other Voting
Agreements, represents no more than 39.9% of the shares of Company Common
Stock (and any other voting securities of the Company) outstanding and
entitled to vote at any such meeting (or to deliver a consent, as applicable)
referenced in this Section 1(a), and the Stockholder shall be entitled, in
its discretion, to vote all remaining Shares not subject to this Section 1(a)
as a result of the application of this sentence in any manner it chooses.

 

(b) _Restrictions on Transfers_. The Stockholder hereby agrees that, from
the date hereof until the Expiration Time, the Stockholder shall not,
directly or indirectly, sell (including short sales), transfer, give, pledge,
grant a security interest in, encumber, assign, grant any option for the sale
of, enter into a "put equivalent position" (as defined by Rule 16a-1(h) under
the Exchange Act) or otherwise transfer or dispose (including by operation of
law) of any Shares (collectively, " _Transfer_ "), or enter into any
agreement, arrangement or undertaking with respect to any Transfer of any
Shares, other than to any affiliate; _provided_ that as a condition to such
Transfer, such affiliate shall agree in a signed writing reasonably acceptable
to Parent to be bound by and comply with all the provisions of
this Agreement. Any Transfer in violation of this Agreement shall be void.

(c) _Transfer of Voting Rights_. The Stockholder hereby agrees that the
Stockholder shall not deposit any Shares in a voting trust, grant any proxy or
power of attorney or enter into any voting agreement or arrangement in
contravention of the obligations of the Stockholder under this Agreement with
respect to any of the Shares.

(d) _Inconsistent Agreements_. The Stockholder hereby agrees that it
shall not enter into any agreement, contract or arrangement with any Person
prior to the Expiration Time, directly or indirectly, to vote, grant a proxy
or power of attorney or give instructions with respect to the voting of the
Shares in any manner which is inconsistent with this Agreement. The
Stockholder has waived, and will not modify or revoke any such waiver with
respect to, its consent right under Section 5(b) of the Stockholder Agreement
in connection with the transactions contemplated by the Merger Agreement.

(e) _Proxy_. Without limiting the obligations of the Stockholder under
this Agreement, the Stockholder hereby irrevocably appoints as its proxy and
attorney-in-fact the

 



2 ##### Table of Contents

  

 officers of Parent, and any individual who shall hereafter succeed to any
such officer of Parent, and any other Person designated in writing by Parent
(collectively, the " _Proxy Holders_ "), each of them individually, with full
power of substitution, to vote the Shares in accordance with this Agreement
and, in the discretion of the Proxy Holders, with respect to any proposed
postponements or adjournments of meetings of the Companys stockholders at
which any of the matters described in this Agreement are to be considered, in
each case only in the event the Stockholder fails to be counted as present or
fails to vote all of the Shares in accordance with this Agreement. This proxy
is coupled with an interest and shall be irrevocable, and the Stockholder
shall take such further action or execute such other instruments as may be
reasonably necessary to effectuate the intent of this proxy and hereby
revokes any proxy previously granted by the Stockholder with respect to the
Shares. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement, the proxy
granted by this Section 1(e) shall terminate and be of no further force and
effect upon the Expiration Time.

the Stockholder_.

warrants to Parent as follows:

Entity, including any amendment to any Schedule 13D under the Exchange Act),
and no permit, authorization, consent or approval of, a Governmental Entity is
necessary on the part of the Stockholder for the execution, delivery and
performance of this Agreement by the Stockholder or the consummation by the
Stockholder of the transactions contemplated hereby, except where the failure
to make or obtain such filing, permit, authorization, consent or approval
would not, individually or in the aggregate, reasonably be expected to
materially impair the Stockholders ability to perform its obligations under
this Agreement in any material respect.

 

(ii) _Due Authorization_. This Agreement has been duly executed and
delivered by the Stockholder and the execution, delivery and performance of
this Agreement by the Stockholder and the consummation of the transactions

Stockholder has not (a) entered into any voting agreement or voting trust
with respect to any Shares or entered into any other contract relating to the
voting of the Shares or (b) appointed or granted a proxy or power of attorney
with respect to any Shares in any manner which is inconsistent with this

 by the Stockholder nor the consummation by the Stockholder of the
transactions contemplated hereby or compliance by the Stockholder with any of
the provisions hereof shall (1) conflict with or violate any provision of the
organizational documents of the Stockholder, (2) result in any breach or
violation of, or constitute a default (or an event which, with notice or lapse
of time or both, would become a default) under, or give to others any rights
of termination, amendment, acceleration or cancellation of, or result in the
creation of a Lien on any property or asset of any of the Stockholder pursuant
to any Contract to which the Stockholder is a party or by which
the Stockholder or any property or asset of the Stockholder is bound or
affected, or (3) violate any Law or Order applicable to the Stockholder or any
of its properties or assets, except in the case of clauses (1), (2) or (3)
for violations, breaches or defaults that would not, individually or in the
aggregate, materially impair the Stockholders ability to perform its
obligations hereunder on a timely basis. Subject to Section 4, the Stockholder
has irrevocably waived any consent right it may have under Section 5(b) of
the Stockholder Agreement in connection with the transactions contemplated by
the Merger Agreement.

the sole record and beneficial owner of all of the Shares, in each case free
and clear of Liens, and has the power to vote or direct the vote with respect
to the Shares. As used in this Agreement, the terms " _beneficial owner_ _,_ "
" _beneficially own_ " and " _beneficial ownership_ " shall have the meaning
set forth in Rule 13d-3 promulgated by the Securities and Exchange Commission
under the Exchange Act; _provided_ , that, for purposes of determining whether
a Person is a beneficial owner of any Shares, a Person shall be deemed to be
the beneficial owner of any Shares which may be acquired by such Person
pursuant to any contract, arrangement or understanding or upon the exercise of
conversion rights, exchange rights, warrants or options, or otherwise
(irrespective of whether the right to acquire such Shares is exercisable
immediately or only after the passage of time, including the passage of time
in excess of 60 days, the satisfaction of any conditions, the occurrence of
any event or any combination of the foregoing). No Person has any contractual
or other right or obligation to purchase or otherwise acquire any of such
Shares and the Stockholder has not assigned any rights associated with any
Shares to any Person.

(vi) _Absence of Litigation_. As of the date hereof, there is no Action
pending or, to the knowledge of the Stockholder, threatened against or
affecting the Stockholder before or by any Governmental Entity, except, as
would not reasonably be expected, either individually or in the aggregate, to
materially impair the ability of the Stockholder to perform its obligations
hereunder in any material respect.

(vii) _Reliance_. The Stockholder understands and acknowledges that
Parent is entering into the Merger Agreement in reliance upon the
Stockholders execution and delivery of this Agreement and the

Agreement and their respective successors and permitted assigns, any legal or
equitable right, remedy or claim under or with respect to this Agreement or
any provision of this Agreement.

to create, and creates, a contractual relationship and is not intended to
create, and does not create, any agency, partnership, joint venture or any
like relationship between the parties hereto. Except as expressly set forth in
this Agreement, nothing contained in this Agreement shall be deemed, upon
execution, to vest in Parent any direct or indirect ownership or incidence of

benefits of and relating to the Shares shall remain vested in and belong to
the Stockholder, and Parent shall not have any authority to manage, direct,
superintend, restrict, regulate, govern or administer any of the policies or
operations of the Stockholder or exercise any power or authority to direct
the Stockholder in the voting of any of the Shares, except as otherwise
provided in this Agreement. Nothing in this Agreement shall be interpreted as
creating or forming a "group" with any Person, including Parent, for purposes
of Rule 13d-5(b)(1) of the Exchange Act or any other similar provision of
applicable Law or of conferring upon Parent beneficial ownership of any Shares
at any time prior to the Effective Time.

severable and the invalidity or unenforceability of any provision shall not

provision of this Agreement, or the application thereof to any Person or any
circumstance, is determined by a court of competent jurisdiction to be
invalid or unenforceable, (a) a suitable and equitable provision shall be
substituted therefor in order to carry out, so far as may be valid and
enforceable, the intent and purpose of such invalid or unenforceable
provision and (b) the remainder of this Agreement and the application of such

(j) _Specific Performance_. The parties agree that irreparable damage for
which monetary damages, even if available, would not be an adequate remedy,
would occur in the event that the parties hereto do not perform the provisions
of this Agreement in accordance with its specified terms or otherwise breach
such provisions. The parties acknowledge and agree that prior to the valid
termination of this Agreement in accordance with Section 4, the parties hereto
shall be entitled, in addition to any other remedy to which they are entitled
under this Agreement, to an injunction, specific performance and other
equitable relief to prevent breaches of this Agreement and to enforce
specifically the terms and provisions hereof in the Chosen Courts. Without
limiting the foregoing, each of the parties agrees that it will not oppose
the granting of an injunction, specific performance and other equitable relief
on the basis that (i) there is adequate remedy at law or (ii) an award of
specific performance is not an appropriate remedy for any reason at law or in
equity. Any party seeking an order or injunction to prevent breaches and to
enforce specifically the terms and provisions of this Agreement in accordance
with this Section 5(j) shall not be required to provide any bond or other
security in connection with any such order or injunction.

of its rights under this Agreement or otherwise shall not constitute a waiver
of such rights.

contract or in tort) that may be based upon, arise out of or relate to this
Agreement, or the negotiation, execution or performance hereof, shall be
governed by and construed in accordance with the laws of the State of Delaware
without regard to principles of conflicts of law.

 

(m) _Submission to Jurisdiction_. Each party hereto agrees that it shall
bring any Action between the parties arising out of or related to this
Agreement or the transactions contained in or contemplated by this Agreement

Exhibit B



 



AMENDED AND RESTATED CERTIFICATE OF INCORPORATION

OF

 

BANKRATE, INC.



 

 _FIRST_ : The name of the corporation (which is hereinafter referred to as
the "Corporation") is Bankrate, Inc.

 

 _SECOND_ : The name and address of the registered agent in the State of
Delaware is Corporation Service Company, 2711 Centerville Road, Suite 400,
Wilmington, New Castle County, Delaware 19801.

_THIRD_ : The purpose of the Corporation is to engage in any lawful act
or activity for which corporations may be organized under the General
Corporation Law of the State of Delaware, as from time to time amended (the
"DGCL").

 

 _FOURTH_ : The total number of shares of capital stock which the Corporation
shall have authority to issue is 1,000, all of which shares shall be common
stock having a par value per share of $0.01.

_FIFTH_ : In furtherance and not in limitation of the powers conferred by
law, subject to any limitations contained elsewhere in this certificate of
incorporation, bylaws of the Corporation may be adopted, amended or repealed
by a majority of the board of directors of the Corporation, but any bylaws
adopted by the board of directors may be amended or repealed by the
stockholders entitled to vote thereon. Election of directors need not be by
written ballot.

 

 _SIXTH_ : A director of the Corporation shall not be personally liable either
to the Corporation or to any of its stockholders for monetary damages for
breach of fiduciary duty as a director, except to the extent such exemption
from liability or limitation thereof is not permitted under the DGCL. Any
amendment or modification or repeal of the foregoing sentence or of the
DGCL shall not adversely affect any right or protection of a director of the
Corporation hereunder in respect of any act or omission occurring prior to the
time of such amendment, modification or repeal. If the DGCL hereafter is
amended to further eliminate or limit the liability of a director, then a
director of the Corporation, in addition to the circumstances in which a
director is not personally liable as set forth in the preceding sentence,
shall not be liable to the fullest extent permitted by the amended DCGL.

_SEVENTH_ :

 

 _Section 1_. _Nature of Indemnity_. Each person who was or is made a party
or is or was threatened to be made a party to or is or was otherwise involved
(including involvement as a witness) in any action, suit or proceeding,
whether ##### Table of Contents

  

 civil, criminal, administrative or investigative (hereinafter a "
_proceeding_ "), by reason of the fact that he or she (or a person of whom he
or she is the legal representative), is or was a director, officer,
fiduciary, or agent of the Corporation or, while a director, officer, or
fiduciary of the Corporation, is or was serving at the request of the
Corporation as a director, officer, fiduciary, employee or agent of
another corporation or of a partnership, joint venture, trust or other
enterprise, including service with respect to employee benefit plans, whether
the basis of such proceeding is alleged action in an official capacity as a
director, officer, or fiduciary or in any other capacity while serving as a
director, officer, fiduciary, employee, or agent, shall be indemnified and
held harmless by the Corporation to the fullest extent which it is empowered
to do so by the DGCL (but, in the case of an amendment of the DGCL, only to
the extent that such amendment permits the Corporation to provide broader
indemnification rights than said law permitted the Corporation to provide
prior to such amendment) against all expense, liability and loss (including
attorneys fees, judgments, fines, excise taxes or penalties arising under the
Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974) actually and reasonably
incurred or suffered by such person in connection with such proceeding and
such indemnification shall continue to such person who has ceased to be a
director, officer, or fiduciary and shall inure to the benefit of his or her
heirs, executors and administrators, provided, however, that except as
provided in Section 2 of this Article SEVENTH, the Corporation shall
indemnify any such person seeking indemnification in connection with a
proceeding (or part thereof) initiated by such person only if such proceeding
(or part thereof) was authorized at any time or from time to time by the
Board of Directors of the Corporation. The foregoing proviso shall not apply
(i) to counterclaims or affirmative defenses asserted by a person seeking
indemnification in an action brought against such person or (ii) to any
proceeding brought by a person seeking indemnification or payment under any
directors and officers liability insurance covering such person or seeking
enforcement of such persons rights to indemnification under this
Article SEVENTH. The right to indemnification conferred in this Article
SEVENTH shall be a contract right and, subject to Sections 2 and 5 of this
Article SEVENTH, shall include the right to payment by the Corporation of the
expenses incurred in defending any such proceeding in advance of its final
disposition. The Corporation may, by action of the Board of Directors of the
Corporation, provide indemnification to employees and agents of the
Corporation with the same scope and effect as the foregoing indemnification
of directors and officers.

_Section 2_. _Limitation of Director Liability_. To the fullest extent
permitted by the DGCL, as the same exists or may hereafter be amended, a
director of the Corporation shall not be personally liable to the Corporation
or its stockholders for monetary damages for breach of fiduciary duty as a
director, except for any liability imposed by law (as in effect from time to
time) (i) for any breach of the directors duty of loyalty to the Corporation
or its stockholders, (ii) for any act or omission not in good faith or which
involved intentional misconduct of a knowing violation of law or (iii) under
Section 174 of the DGCL or (iv) for any transaction from which the director
derived an improper personal benefit.

_Section 3_. _Right of Claimant to Bring Suit_. If a claim under Section 1
of this Article SEVENTH is not paid in full by the Corporation within thirty
days after a written claim has been received by the Corporation, the claimant
may at any time thereafter bring suit against the Corporation to recover
the unpaid amount of the claim and, if successful in whole or in part, the
claimant shall be entitled to be paid also the expense of prosecuting such
claim. It shall be a defense to any such action (other than an action brought
to enforce a claim for expenses incurred in defending any proceeding in
advance of its final disposition where the required undertaking, if any is
required, has been tendered to the Corporation) that the claimant has not met
the standards of conduct which make it permissible under the DGCL for the
Corporation to indemnify the claimant for the amount claimed, but the burden
of proving such defense shall be on the Corporation. Neither the failure of
the Corporation (including its Board of Directors, independent legal counsel,
or its stockholders) to have made a determination prior to the commencement of
such action that indemnification of the claimant is proper in the
circumstances because he or she has met the applicable standard of
conduct set forth in the DGCL, nor an actual determination by the Corporation
(including its Board, independent legal counsel, or its stockholders) that the
claimant has not met such applicable standard of conduct, shall be a defense
to the action or create a presumption that the claimant has not met the
applicable standard of conduct.

_Section 4_. _Nonexclusivity of this Article_. The rights to indemnification
and the payment of expenses incurred in defending a proceeding in advance of
its final disposition conferred in this Article SEVENTH shall not be exclusive
of any other right which any person may have or hereafter acquire under any
statute, provision of the certificate of incorporation, bylaw, agreement, vote
of stockholders or disinterested directors or otherwise.

 

 _Section 5_. _Insurance_. The Corporation may maintain insurance, at its
expense, to protect itself and any director, officer, employee or agent of
the Corporation or another corporation, partnership, joint venture, trust or
other enterprise against any such expense, liability or loss, whether or not
the Corporation would have the power to indemnify such person against such
expense, liability or loss under the DGCL.

_Section 6_. _Expenses_. Expenses incurred by any person described in
Section 1 of this Article SEVENTH in defending a proceeding shall be paid by
the Corporation in advance of such proceedings final disposition unless
otherwise determined by the Board of Directors of the Corporation in the
specific case upon receipt of an undertaking by or on behalf of the relevant
director or officer to repay such amount if it shall ultimately be determined
that he is not entitled to be indemnified by the Corporation. Such
expenses incurred by other employees and agents may be so paid upon such
terms and conditions, if any, as the Board of Directors of the Corporation
deems appropriate.

_Section 7_. _Service for Subsidiaries_. Any person serving as a director,
officer, employee or agent of another corporation, partnership, limited
liability company, joint venture or other enterprise, at least fifty percent
(50%) of whose equity interests are owned, directly or indirectly, by
the Corporation, shall be conclusively presumed to be serving in such
capacity at the request of the Corporation.

 

 _Section 8_. _Employees and Agents_. Persons who are not covered by the
foregoing provisions of this Article SEVENTH and who are or were employees or
agents of the Corporation, or who are or were serving at the request of the
Corporation as employees or agents of another corporation, partnership, joint
venture, trust or other enterprise, may be indemnified to the extent
authorized at any time or from time to time by the Board of Directors of the
Corporation.

 

 _Section 9_. _Contract Rights_. The provisions of this Article SEVENTH shall
be deemed to be a contract right between the Corporation and each director,
officer, or fiduciary who serves in any such capacity at any time while this
Article SEVENTH and the relevant provisions of the DGCL or other applicable
law are in effect, and such rights shall continue as to a director, officer,
or fiduciary who has ceased to be a director, officer, or fiduciary and shall
inure to the benefit of such directors, officers, or fiduciarys heirs,
executors and administrators. Any repeal or modification of this Article
SEVENTH or any such law that adversely affects any right of any director,
officer, or fiduciary, or former director, officer, or fiduciary, shall be
prospective only and shall not affect any rights or obligations then existing
with respect to any state of facts or proceeding then existing.

_Section 10_. _Merger or Consolidation_. For purposes of this Article
SEVENTH, references to "the Corporation" shall include, in addition to the
resulting corporation, any constituent corporation (including any constituent
of a constituent) absorbed in a consolidation or merger which, if its
separate existence had continued, would have had power and authority to
indemnify its directors, officers, and employees or agents, so that any person
who is or was a director, officer, employee or agent of such
constituent corporation, or is or was serving at the request of such
constituent corporation as a director, officer, employee or agent of another
corporation, partnership, joint venture, trust or other enterprise, shall
stand in the same position under this Article SEVENTH with respect to the
resulting or surviving corporation as he or she would have with respect to
such constituent corporation if its separate existence had continued.

 

 _EIGHTH_ : To the fullest extent permitted by the DGCL, the Corporation
acknowledges that: (i) each Exempted Stockholder (as defined below),
director employed by an Exempted Stockholder or one of its affiliates,
officer affiliated with an Exempted

 



-4- ##### Table of Contents

  

 Stockholder or one of its affiliates and any other officer or director of
the Corporation specifically designated by an Exempted Stockholder or one of
its affiliates (collectively, the " _Exempted Persons_ ") shall have no duty
(contractual or otherwise) not to, directly or indirectly, engage in the same
or similar business activities or lines of business as the Corporation or any
of its subsidiaries, including those deemed to be competing with the
Corporation or any of its subsidiaries; and (ii) in the event that any
Exempted Person acquires knowledge of a potential transaction or matter that
may be a corporate opportunity for the Corporation, then such Exempted Person
shall have no duty (contractual or otherwise) to communicate or present such
corporate opportunity to the Corporation or any of its subsidiaries, as the
case may be, and shall not be liable to the Corporation or its affiliates
or stockholders for breach of any duty (contractual or otherwise) by reason
of the fact that such Exempted Person, directly or indirectly, pursues or
acquires such opportunity for itself, directs such opportunity to another
person, or does not present such opportunity to the Corporation. For purposes
of this Article EIGHTH, the term " _Exempted Stockholder_ " shall mean all
stockholders of the Corporation other than stockholders who are also officers
or employees of the Corporation or any subsidiary of the Corporation or who
are permitted transferees of any such person.
