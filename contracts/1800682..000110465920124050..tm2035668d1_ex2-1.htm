Company's Subsidiaries on the Closing Date, in each case that are that deemed
contributed in accordance with the Intended Tax Treatment (the " _Tax Basis
Balance Sheet_ ") _provided_ that, notwithstanding anything in this paragraph

of the Tax Positions; and (4) consult with and keep one another informed with
respect to the status of, and any discussion, proposal or submission

as applicable, state and local Tax purposes, they intend that (A)
the Domestication qualify as a "reorganization" under Section 368(a)(1)(F) of

described in Revenue Ruling 73-427, through which JAWS shall be deemed to have
acquired a number of units in the Company equal to the Acquired Company
Units, (ii) it is intended that such acquisition of units be treated as a
transaction described in Revenue Ruling 99-5 (Situation 1), wherein (i) JAWS
is deemed to purchase a pro rata portion of the assets of the Company from
the Seller in a transaction governed by Section 1001 of the Code in exchange
for the Company Cash Consideration and assumption of a pro rata portion of
the indebtedness of each Group Company, and (ii) JAWS and the Seller are each
deemed to contribute their respective interests in the assets of the Company
to a new partnership in a transaction governed by Section 721 of the Code and

treated as a contribution under Section 721 of the Code, and (C) this
Agreement is intended to constitute and hereby is adopted as a "plan of
reorganization" with respect to the Domestication within the meaning of
Treasury Regulations Section 1.368-2(g) and 1.368-3(a) for purposes
of Sections 354, 361 and 368 of the Code and the Treasury Regulations
thereunder.

  



  

(ii) If, in connection with the preparation and filing of the
Registration Statement / Proxy Statement, the SEC requests or requires
that tax opinions be prepared and submitted in such connection, JAWS and the
Company shall deliver to Kirkland and Ellis and Goodwin Procter LLP,
respectively, customary Tax representation letters satisfactory to its
counsel, dated and executed as of the date that the Registration Statement /
Proxy Statement shall have been declared effective by the SEC and such other
date(s) as determined reasonably necessary by such counsel in connection with
the preparation and filing of the Registration Statement / Proxy
Statement, and, if required, Kirkland and Ellis LLP shall furnish an opinion,
subject to customary assumptions and limitations, to the effect that the
Intended Tax Treatment should apply to the Domestication.

  



  

(f)  The Parties shall cause the Company to elect the
"traditional method" described in Treasury Regulations Section 1.704-3(b)
with respect to any assets contributed, or deemed, contributed to the Company
by the Company in connection with the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement.

  



  

(g)   _JAWS Taxable Year_. The Parties agree to treat the

under applicable Law, but if any term or other provision of this Agreement is
held to be invalid, illegal or unenforceable under applicable Law, all other
provisions of this Agreement shall remain in full force and effect so long

within State of New York, New York County), for the purposes of any
Proceeding, claim, demand, action or cause of action (a) arising under this
Agreement or under any Ancillary Document or (b) in any way connected with or
related or incidental to the dealings of the Parties in respect of this
Agreement or any Ancillary Document or any of the transactions contemplated
hereby or any of the transactions contemplated thereby, and irrevocably and
unconditionally waives any objection to the laying of venue of any such
Proceeding in any such court, and further irrevocably and unconditionally
waives and agrees not to plead or claim in any such court that any such
Proceeding has been brought in an inconvenient forum. Each Party
hereby irrevocably and unconditionally waives, and agrees not to assert, by
way of motion or as a defense, counterclaim or otherwise, in any Proceeding
claim, demand, action or cause of action against such Party (i) arising under
this Agreement or under any Ancillary Document or (ii) in any way connected
with or related or incidental to the dealings of the Parties in respect of
this Agreement or any Ancillary Document or any of the transactions
contemplated hereby or any of the transactions contemplated thereby, (A)
any claim that such Party is not personally subject to the jurisdiction of
the courts as described in this _Section 9.16_ for any reason, (B) that such
Party or such Party's property is exempt or immune from the jurisdiction of
any such court or from any legal process commenced in such courts (whether

the Proceeding, claim, demand, action or cause of action in any such court is
brought against such Party in an inconvenient forum, (y) the venue of
such Proceeding, claim, demand, action or cause of action against such Party
is improper or (z) this Agreement, or the subject matter hereof, may not be
enforced against such Party in or by such courts. Each Party agrees that
service of any process, summons, notice or document by registered mail to
such party's respective address set forth in _Section 9.4_ shall be
effective service of process for any such Proceeding, claim, demand, action
or cause of action. Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the
contrary, each Party (on behalf of itself and its respective Subsidiaries and
its and their respective Affiliates and any of their respective former,
current or future general or limited partners, stockholders, equityholders,
members, managers, directors, officers, employees, agents or Affiliates)
hereby irrevocably and unconditionally agrees that it will not bring or
support any litigation, cause of action, cross-claim or third-party claim of
any kind or description, whether in law or in equity, whether in contract or
in tort or otherwise, against any Company Refinancing Debt Source in any way
relating to this Agreement or any of the transactions contemplated hereby, in
any forum other than the federal and New York state courts located in the
Borough of Manhattan within the City of New York (and the appellate courts
thereof), and that the provisions of _Section 9.15_ relating to the waiver
of jury trial shall apply to any such litigation, cause of action, claim,
cross-claim or third-party claim.

  



  

Section 9.17   _Remedies_. Except as otherwise expressly provided
herein, any and all remedies provided herein will be deemed cumulative with
and not exclusive of any other remedy conferred hereby, or by law or equity
upon such Party, and the exercise by a Party of any one remedy will not
preclude the exercise of any other remedy. The Parties agree that irreparable
damage for which monetary damages, even if available, would not be an
adequate remedy, would occur in the event that the Parties do not
perform their respective obligations under the provisions of this Agreement
(including failing to take such actions as are required of them hereunder to
consummate the transactions contemplated by this Agreement) in accordance with
their specific terms or otherwise breach such provisions. It is accordingly
agreed that the Parties shall be entitled to seek an injunction or
injunctions, specific performance and other equitable relief to prevent
breaches of this Agreement and to enforce specifically the terms and
provisions of this Agreement, in each case, without posting a bond or
undertaking and without proof of damages and this being in addition to any
other remedy to which they are entitled at law or in equity. Each of the
Parties agrees that it will not oppose the granting of an injunction,
specific performance and other equitable relief when expressly available
pursuant to the terms of this Agreement on the basis that the other parties
have an adequate remedy at law or an award of specific performance is not an
appropriate remedy for any reason at law or equity.

Section 9.18   _Trust Account Waiver_. Reference is made to the final
prospectus of JAWS, filed with the SEC (File Nos. 333-237874 and 333-238241)
on May 18, 2020 (the " _Prospectus_ "). Each of the Seller and the Company
acknowledges and agrees and understands that JAWS has established a trust
account (the " _Trust Account_ ") containing the proceeds of its initial
public offering (the " _IPO_ ") and from certain private placements occurring
simultaneously with the IPO (including interest accrued from time to time
thereon) for the benefit of JAWS's public shareholders (including
overallotment shares acquired by JAWS's underwriters, the  " _Public
Shareholders_ "), and JAWS may disburse monies from the Trust Account only in
the express circumstances described in the Prospectus. For and in
consideration of JAWS entering into this Agreement, and for other good and
valuable consideration, the receipt and sufficiency of which is hereby
acknowledged, the Company hereby agrees on behalf of itself and its
Representatives that, notwithstanding the foregoing or anything to the
contrary in this Agreement, none of the Company nor any of it Representatives
does now or shall at any time hereafter have any right, title, interest or
claim of any kind in or to any monies in the Trust Account or distributions
therefrom, or make any claim against the Trust Account (including any
distributions therefrom), regardless of whether such claim arises as a result
of, in connection with or relating in any way to, this Agreement or any
proposed or actual business relationship between JAWS or any of its
Representatives, on the one hand, and, the Company or any of its
Representatives, on the other hand, or any other matter, and regardless of
whether such claim arises based on contract, tort, equity or any other theory
of legal liability (any and all such claims are collectively referred to
hereafter as the " _Trust Account Released Claims_ "). The Company, on its
own behalf and on behalf of its Representatives, hereby irrevocably waives
any Trust Account Released Claims that it or any of its Representatives may
have against the Trust Account (including any distributions therefrom) now or
in the future as a result of, or arising out of, any negotiations, or
Contracts with JAWS or its Representatives and will not seek recourse against
the Trust Account (including any distributions therefrom) for any reason
whatsoever (including for an alleged breach of any agreement with JAWS or its
Affiliates).

Section 9.19   _Waiver_. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary
contained herein, the JAWS Parties and each of its Representatives thereof
(a) hereby waives any claims or rights against any Company Refinancing Debt
Source relating to or arising out of this Agreement, the Company Refinancing
Debt and the transactions contemplated hereby and thereby, whether at law or
in equity and whether in tort, contract or otherwise, (b) hereby agrees not
to bring or support any suit, action or proceeding against any
Company Refinancing Debt Source in connection with this Agreement, the
Company Refinancing Debt and the transactions contemplated hereby and
thereby, whether at law or in equity and whether in tort, contract or
otherwise, and (c) hereby agrees to cause any suit, action or proceeding
asserted against any Company Refinancing Debt Source by or on behalf of the
JAWS Parties or any of its Representatives thereof in connection with this
Agreement, the Company Refinancing Debt and the transactions contemplated
hereby and thereby to be dismissed or otherwise terminated. Notwithstanding
the foregoing, nothing in this _Section 9.19_ shall limit the assertion by
any Group Company of express rights of such Group Company set forth in any
debt commitment letter or other definitive documentation related to the
Company Refinancing Debt.
