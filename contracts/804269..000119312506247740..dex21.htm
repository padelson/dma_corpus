other date as the Seller and the Buyer mutually may agree in writing. The day
on which the Closing takes place is referred to as the " _Closing Date_ ".

(b) At the Closing, (i) the Buyer shall deliver to the Seller, by wire

Statement is not reasonably acceptable to the Buyer, the Seller and the Buyer
shall use their respective commercially reasonable efforts to resolve any

(b) As soon as reasonably practicable after the Closing Date, but in no event

Accounting Firm.

matter hereafter arising or discovered which if existing or known at the date
of this Agreement would have been required to be set forth or described in
such Disclosure Schedules and also with respect to events or conditions
arising after the date hereof and prior to Closing which, if the same had
existed as of the date of this Agreement, would have been required to be set
forth or described in the Disclosure Schedules. No such supplemental or
amended disclosure shall be given any effect for purposes of determining
whether or not the conditions set forth in _Article VIII_ have been satisfied;
_provided_ ,  _however_ , that if the conditions set forth in _Article VIII_
are not satisfied but the Buyer waives such conditions, then any such
disclosure shall be deemed to constitute an exception to the representations

Closing, and any and all Actions that could be asserted by the Seller or any
of its Affiliates (other than the Company and its Subsidiaries) against the
Company or any of its Subsidiaries, whether or not asserted or claimed as of
the date hereof or as of the Closing Date, shall be released without any

Subsidiaries and Affiliates to not, directly or indirectly, own, manage,
operate, Control or participate in the ownership, management, operation or
Control of any business, whether in corporate, proprietorship or partnership
form or otherwise, engaged in the indirect automotive dealer finance business
(a " _Restricted Business_ ") in North America; _provided_ , _however_ , that
the restrictions contained in this _Section 6.6(a)_ shall not prohibit the
Seller or any of its Affiliates from (i) acquiring, directly or indirectly,
less than 5% in the aggregate of the outstanding capital stock of any
publicly traded company engaged in a Restricted Business or (ii) having
contact or relationships with any customers of the Company or its Subsidiaries
unrelated to the Restricted Business. For the avoidance of any doubt, none of
the provisions of this _Section 6.6(a)_ shall apply to an Affiliate or
Subsidiary of the Seller after it has ceased to be an Affiliate or Subsidiary
of the Seller. The parties hereto specifically acknowledge and agree that the
remedy at Law for any breach of the foregoing will be inadequate and that the
Buyer, in addition to any other relief available to it, shall be entitled to
temporary and permanent injunctive relief without the necessity of proving
actual damage or posting any bond whatsoever.

(b) For a period from the Closing Date to the third (3rd) anniversary of the
Closing Date, the Seller shall not, and the Seller shall cause each of its
Subsidiaries and Affiliates to not, directly or indirectly, solicit, induce
or encourage any employee of the Company or its Subsidiaries to leave such
employment. The provisions of this _Section 6.6(b)_ shall not be violated if
the Seller or any of its Affiliates (i) solicits for employment any employee
involved in the Restricted Business who has not been employed by the Buyer or
its Affiliates for at least twelve (12) months at the time of such
solicitation or (ii) solicits for employment any employees involved in the
Restricted Business by way of any general advertisement that is not
specifically directed to the employees involved in the Restricted Business.
For the avoidance of any doubt, none of the provisions of this  _Section
6.6(b)_ shall apply to an Affiliate or Subsidiary of the Seller after it has
ceased to be an Affiliate or Subsidiary of the Seller.



 

32 (c) If this Agreement is terminated prior to Closing, the Buyer will not, for
a period of three (3) years thereafter, without the prior written consent of
the Seller, solicit any person who is an employee of the Company or its
Subsidiaries, at the date hereof or at any time hereafter that precedes such
termination, to terminate his or her employment with the Company or its
Subsidiaries. The provisions of this _Section 6.6(c)_ shall not be violated
if the Buyer (i) solicits for employment any employee of the Company or its
Subsidiaries, at the date hereof or at any time hereafter that precedes such
termination, who has not been employed by the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries for at least twelve (12) months at the time of such solicitation
or (ii) solicits for employment any employees of the Company or its
Subsidiaries, at the date hereof or at any time hereafter that precedes such
termination, by way of any general advertisement that is not specifically
directed to such employees. The Buyer agrees that any remedy at law for any
breach by the Buyer of this _Section 6.6(c)_ would be inadequate, and that
the Seller and the Company would be entitled to injunctive relief in such a
case. If it is ever held that this restriction on the Buyer is too onerous and
is not necessary for the protection of the Company or its Subsidiaries, the
Buyer agrees that any court of competent jurisdiction may impose such lesser
restrictions which such court may consider to be necessary or appropriate
properly to protect the Company. 

(d) _Reformation_. In the event that the provisions of _Section 6.6(a)_,
_(b)_ , or _(c)_ should ever be deemed to exceed the time or geographic
limitations or any other limitations permitted by applicable Laws, then such
provisions shall be deemed reformed to the maximum extent permitted by
applicable Laws.

(e) _Reasonable Restraint_. It is agreed by the parties hereto that the
foregoing covenants in this _Section 6.6_ impose a reasonable restraint on
the parties in light of the activities and business of the parties on the date
of the execution of this Agreement and the current plans of the Buyer with
respect to the conduct of the Restricted Business subsequent to the Closing.
Each of the parties acknowledges that its agreements and the covenants set
forth in this _Section 6.6_ are a material inducement to the other parties
agreement to execute and deliver this Agreement and to consummate the
transactions contemplated hereby. Each of the parties further acknowledges
that the covenants set forth in this _Section 6.6_ contain limitations as to
time, geographic area and scope of activity to be restrained that are
reasonable and do not impose a greater restraint than is necessary to protect
the good will or other business interests of the other parties and, subsequent
to the Closing, the Company and its Subsidiaries. All of the covenants in this
_Section 6.6_ shall be construed as an agreement independent of any other
provision in this Agreement, and the existence of any claim or cause of action
of the Seller against the Buyer or the Buyer against the Seller, whether
predicated on this Agreement or otherwise, shall not constitute a defense to
the enforcement by the Seller, the Buyer, the Company or its Subsidiaries of
such covenants. It is specifically agreed that the restricted period during
which the agreements and covenants of the Seller and the Buyer made in this
_Section 6.6_ shall survive and shall be computed by excluding from such
computation any time during which the Seller or the Buyer, as the case may be,
is in violation of any provision of this _Section 6.6_. The
covenants contained in this _Section 6.6_ shall not be affected by any
breach of any other provision hereof by any party hereto.

Section 6.7 _Confidentiality_. Each of the parties shall hold, and shall
cause its Representatives to hold, in confidence all documents and information
furnished to it by or on behalf of the other parties in connection with the
transactions contemplated hereby pursuant to the terms of the confidentiality
agreement dated October 27, 2006, between the Buyer and the Seller (the "
_Confidentiality Agreement_"), which shall continue in full force and effect
until the Closing Date, at



 

33 which time such Confidentiality Agreement and the obligations of the parties
under this _Section 6.7_ shall terminate; _provided_ , _however_ , that the
Buyer may disclose the terms of this Agreement and file or disclose this
Agreement as required by applicable Law or stock exchange rule. If for any
reason this Agreement is terminated prior to the Closing Date, the
Confidentiality Agreement shall nonetheless continue in full force and effect
in accordance with its terms.

Section 6.8 _Consents and Filings; Further Assurances_.

(a) Each of the parties shall use all commercially reasonable efforts to
take, or cause to be taken, all appropriate action to do, or cause to be done,
all things necessary, proper or advisable under applicable Law or otherwise to

as promptly as practicable, including to (i) obtain from Governmental
Authorities and other Persons all consents, approvals, authorizations,

transactions contemplated by this Agreement, (ii) taking such further actions

submissions, with respect to this Agreement required under any applicable

shall agree to participate in any meeting with any Governmental Authority in
respect of any filings, investigation or other inquiry unless it consults with
the other parties in advance and, to the extent permitted by such Governmental
Authority, gives the other parties the opportunity to attend and participate
at such meeting. Subject to the Confidentiality Agreement, the parties will
coordinate and cooperate fully with each other in exchanging such information
and providing such assistance as the other parties may reasonably request in
connection with the foregoing. Subject to the Confidentiality Agreement, the
parties will provide each other with copies of all correspondence, filings or
communications between them or any of their Representatives, on the one hand,
and any Governmental Authority or members of its staff, on the other hand,
with respect to this Agreement and the transactions contemplated hereby.

(c) The Seller and the Company covenant and agree to obtain the release of the
Common Stock from any Encumbrance prior to or simultaneously in
connection with the Closing, in form and substance reasonably satisfactory to
the Buyer.

enter into a formal transition services agreement with respect to services
provided prior to the Closing Date (including, without limitation, payroll,
benefits and insurance services) by the Seller or its Affiliates to the
Company and its Subsidiaries, the parties will use their reasonable best
efforts to negotiate in good faith such an agreement, which agreement shall be
on commercially reasonably terms and have a term not to exceed 90 days.

Section 6.9 _Public Announcements_. The parties hereto shall consult with each
other before issuing, and provide each other the opportunity to review and

and shall use their reasonable best efforts to obtain the release of the
Seller or its Affiliates that are a party to each of the guarantees,
performance bonds, bid bonds and other similar agreements listed in _Schedule
6.10 of the Disclosure Schedules_ (the " _Guarantees_ "). In the event any of
the Guarantees are not released prior to or at the Closing, the Buyer will
provide the Seller at the Closing with a guarantee that indemnifies and holds
the Seller and its Affiliates that are a party to each such Guarantee
harmless for any and all payments required to be made under, and costs and
expenses incurred in connection with, such Guarantee by the Seller or its
Affiliates that are a party to such Guarantee until such Guarantee

Section 6.11 _Directors  and Officers Indemnification_.

(a) From and after the Closing and for a period of six (6) years therefrom,
the Buyer shall cause the Company and its Subsidiaries to indemnify, defend
and hold harmless each person who is now, or has been at any time prior to the
date hereof or who becomes prior to the Closing Date, an officer or director
of the Company or its Subsidiaries (the " _D andO Indemnified Parties_")
against any and all losses, damages, liabilities, deficiencies, claims,
interest, awards, judgments, penalties, costs and expenses (including
reasonable attorneys fees, costs and other out-of-pocket expenses incurred
in investigating, preparing or defending the foregoing) arising out of or
relating to any threatened or actual Action based upon or arising out of or
relating to the fact that such person is or was a director or officer of the
Company or any of its Subsidiaries whether pertaining to any matter existing
or occurring on or prior to the Closing Date and whether asserted or claimed
prior to, on or after the Closing Date (the " _D andO Indemnified Liabilities_")
including all DandO Indemnified Liabilities based on, or arising out of, or
relating to, this Agreement or the transactions contemplated hereby, in each
case to the fullest extent a corporation is permitted under applicable Law to
indemnify its own directors or officers (and the Buyer shall cause the
Company and its Subsidiaries to pay expenses in advance of the final
disposition of any such Action to each DandO Indemnified Party upon receipt from
each such DandO Indemnified Party of a written undertaking to reimburse the
Company and its Subsidiaries for such advancement upon the determination of a
court of competent jurisdiction that such DandO Indemnified Party is not
entitled to indemnification in respect of such threatened or actual Action).
Without limiting the foregoing, in the event any such Action is brought
against any DandO Indemnified Party (whether arising before or after the Closing
Date), (i) the DandO Indemnified Party may retain counsel satisfactory to
it and reasonably satisfactory to the Buyer, and the Buyer shall cause the
Company and its Subsidiaries to pay all fees and expenses of such counsel for
the DandO Indemnified Party as statements therefor are received and (ii) the
Buyer shall cause the Company and its Subsidiaries and each DandO Indemnified
Party will use all reasonable efforts to assist in the vigorous defense of any
such matter; _provided_ , that neither the Company, any of its Subsidiaries
nor the Buyer shall be liable for any settlement effected or agreed judgment
entered into with the consent of a Dand O Indemnified Party without its prior
written consent. Any DandO Indemnified Party wishing to claim indemnification
under this _Section 6.11_ shall promptly notify the Buyer upon learning of
any such Action (but the failure so to notify shall not relieve a party from
any liability which it may have under this _Section 6.11_, except to the
extent such failure prejudices such party). The parties hereto agree that all
rights to indemnification hereunder, including provisions relating to advances
of expenses incurred in defense of any such Actions existing in favor of the
DandO Indemnified Parties with respect to matters occurring on or prior to the
Closing Date shall continue in full force and effect for a period of not less
than six (6) years from the Closing Date; _provided_ , _however_ , that all
rights to indemnification in respect of any DandO Indemnified Liabilities
asserted or made within such period shall continue until the disposition of
such DandO Indemnified Liabilities. Notwithstanding anything contained herein,
neither the Buyer, the Company nor any of the Companys Subsidiaries shall be
liable for any DandO



 

35 Indemnified Liabilities or any other amounts to the DandO Indemnified Parties,
including (without limitation) any obligation to advance or reimburse
expenses hereunder, in respect of any threatened or actual Action which is
asserted by or through the Seller or any present or future Affiliate of the
Seller (excluding the Company and any of its Subsidiaries), or which is based
upon, arises as a result of, or relates to, the fact that such person is or
was a director or officer or employee of the Seller or any of its Affiliates
other than the Company or any of its Subsidiaries or which is based upon,
arises as a result of, or relates to, the actions, activities and/or
businesses of the Seller or any of its Affiliates other than the Company or
any of its Subsidiaries.

(b) For six (6) years from the Closing Date, the Seller shall maintain
officers and directors liability insurance covering the persons who are
presently covered by its officers and directors liability insurance
policies (copies of which have heretofore been delivered to the Buyer) with
respect to actions and omissions occurring prior to the Closing Date,
providing coverage not less favorable than that provided by such insurance in
effect on the date hereof. The Seller and the Buyer shall (or the Buyer shall
cause the Company and its Subsidiaries to) each pay one-half of the premiums
related to such insurance.

(c) The Buyer hereby waives, to the fullest extent permitted under applicable
Law, for itself and its successors and assigns, any and all rights,
claims and causes of Action it may have, from and after the Closing, against
any DandO Indemnified Party relating to any DandO Indemnified Liability. The
Seller hereby waives and releases, to the fullest extent permitted under
applicable Law, for itself and its successors and assigns, and for its
Affiliates and their respective successors and assigns (who the Seller shall
cause to confirm such obligations in writing to the Buyer on or before the
Closing Date), any and all rights, claims, obligations and causes of Action
it may have, from and after the Closing, against any DandO Indemnified Party
relating to any DandO Indemnified Liability.

(d) For six (6) years from the Closing Date, the Company shall not take any
action directly or indirectly to disaffirm or adversely affect the provisions
that provide for indemnification of and reimbursement of expenses to DandO
Indemnified Parties contained in the articles of organization and bylaws and
any other written agreements of the Company and its Subsidiaries.

(e) All claims that could reasonably be expected to give rise to a claim for
DandO Indemnified Liabilities that have ever been made against any of the DandO
Indemnified Parties are set out on _Schedule 6.11(e) of the Disclosure
Schedules_.

Section 6.12 _Employee Benefits_.

(a) The Seller shall not, and shall cause the Company and its Subsidiaries to
not, enter into any Executive Retention Letters, Upper Management
Retention Letters, Management Retention Letters, or Salesperson Retention
Letters, with any persons other than those persons set forth in _Schedule
6.12(a) of the Disclosure Schedules_ and in the amounts set forth in such
schedule. The Buyer acknowledges that the Seller has committed to pay certain
bonuses to certain employees of the Company, for which neither the Buyer, the
Company nor any of its Subsidiaries shall have any liability or obligation
whatsoever.

(b) From and after the Closing Date, the Buyer shall assume the Sellers
obligations with respect to any current or former officer, director, employee
or consultant of the Company or its Subsidiaries under the Long-Term Incentive
Plan maintained by the Seller, as amended as set forth in _Schedule 6.12(b) of
the Disclosure Schedules_ , but only to the extent that any



 

36 payment is owed under the terms of such Long-Term Incentive Plan after the
Closing Date, without regard to any amendments or modifications made to such
plans after the Closing Date and without regard to any benefits that might
accrue under such plans after the Closing Date, but not exceeding the amount
accrued therefor on the Final Closing Statement. Notwithstanding any
provision of this Agreement to the contrary, the Seller shall amend the Long-
Term Incentive Plan maintained by the Seller: (i) as may reasonably be
requested by the Buyer to prevent the Company, its Subsidiaries and the Buyer
from being treated as a successor for any purposes under such Long-Term
Incentive Plan; and (ii) with the consent of the Buyer to effectuate the
purposes of this _Section 6.12(b)_.

(c) The Buyer shall, or shall cause the Company and its Subsidiaries, as
applicable, to honor all unused vacation (which is accrued on the Final
Closing Statement) and holiday, sickness and personal days accrued by the
employees of the Company and its Subsidiaries under the policies and practices
of the Company and its Subsidiaries as of the Closing Date. In the event of
any change in the welfare benefits provided to any employee of the Company or
its Subsidiaries under any Employee Plan as of the Closing Date, the Buyer
shall, or shall cause the Company and its Subsidiaries, as applicable, to (i)
waive all limitations as to preexisting conditions, exclusions and waiting
periods with respect to participation and coverage requirements applicable to
the affected employees and their covered dependents under such plan (except to
the extent that such conditions, exclusions or waiting periods would apply
under the Companys or Subsidiarys then existing plans absent any change in
such welfare coverage plan) and (ii) at the Buyers discretion either (A)
provide for each employee or his or her covered dependents with credit for
any co-payments and deductibles paid prior to any such change in coverage
satisfying any applicable deductible or out-of-pocket requirements under such
new or changed plan, or (B) reimburse each employee for any co-payments or
deductibles paid by such employee and his or her covered dependents prior to
the Closing Date which would have otherwise been covered under the Employee
Plans in the year of Closing. The Buyer shall, or shall cause the Company and
its Subsidiaries, to provide each affected employee with credit for service
with the Company and its Affiliates and their respective predecessors for
eligibility, vesting and benefit accrual purposes, under each benefit plan of
the Buyer (" _Buyer Plans_ ") in which such affected employee is eligible to
participate after the Closing Date, except for benefit accrual under any
retirement plan or to the extent that such credit would result in a
duplication of benefits with respect to the same period of service with the
Company and its Affiliates.

(d) The Seller agrees, to the extent requested by the Buyer, that (i) to the
extent any employee of the Company or Subsidiary who becomes an employee of
the Buyer on the Closing Date, and who is not otherwise fully vested in his or
her accrued benefit as of the Closing Date under any Employee Plan that is
intended be qualified under section 401(a) of the Code (the " _Seller 401(k)
Plan_ "), the Seller will on or before the Closing Date take all necessary
actions (including, but not limited to, adoption of plan amendments) to cause
each such employee to be fully vested as of the Closing Date and to
effectuate any of the actions required or otherwise contemplated by this
paragraph, and as approved by the Buyer, and/or (ii) shall cause the rollover
or transfer (as requested by the Buyer) of: (i) the account balances of the
current and former employees of Company or Subsidiary who participate under
the Sellers 401(k) Plan including, without limitation, outstanding loans of
such persons and (ii) assets having a value equal to said account balances to
a profit-sharing plan maintained by the Buyer that is qualified under Section
401(a) of the Code and that includes a cash or deferred arrangement that
qualifies under Section 401(k) of the Code (the " _Buyer s 401(k) Plan_"),
_provided_ that the Buyer has provided to Seller the latest IRS determination,
opinion, notification or similar letter as evidence Buyers 401(k) Plan is
tax-qualified. The assets transferred shall consist of the assets allocated
under the Sellers 401(k) Plan to the accounts of current and former employees
of either Company or any Subsidiary, including without limitation, promissory



 

37 notes evidencing outstanding loans of such persons. The Seller agrees to adopt
any other amendments reasonably requested by Buyer to any Employee Plan on or
before the Closing Date to prevent the Company, its Subsidiaries and the Buyer
from being treated as a successor for any purposes under any such Employee
Plan or as necessary to comply with the Code or ERISA in such regard.

(e) On the Closing Date, the Seller shall terminate the Companys and its
Subsidiarys participation in any and all Employee Plans, including, but not
limited to, the Sellers 401(k) Plan. The Buyer shall not have any obligations
or liabilities under the Sellers 401(k) Plan with respect to any matching or
other contributions due and owing after the Closing Date, other than to
reimburse the Seller for any matching amounts that are accrued on the Final
Closing Statement. The Buyer shall receive from the Seller such satisfactory
evidence or confirmation that the participation of the employees of the
Company and its Subsidiaries in each of the Employee Plans have been
terminated, as set forth in this paragraph, pursuant to duly authorized
corporate action, and if the board of directors of the Seller shall hold a
meeting or otherwise execute a unanimous consent on or before the Closing
Date to effectuate the requirements of this paragraph, the Seller shall
deliver to the Buyer resolutions or a consent of the Sellers board of
directors (the form and substance of such resolutions shall be subject to
review and approval of the Buyer) effectuating the termination of
participation by employees of the Company and its Subsidiaries in the Employee
Plans as set forth above. If requested by the Buyer, the Seller shall amend
the Sellers 401(k) Plan and any underlying loan agreements on or before the
Closing Date to the extent necessary to avoid a default of any Sellers 401(k)
Plan loans as a result of the termination of employment by the employees of
the Company and its Subsidiaries, which amendment shall be subject to review
and approval of the Buyer, and the Seller shall provide to the Buyer an
executed duplicate original of any such amendment on the Closing Date and
evidence on or before the Closing satisfactory to the Buyer that any such
amendment has been duly adopted by the Seller through proper corporate action.

(f) Seller shall be solely responsible for providing continuation health
coverage, as required under the Consolidated Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act
of 1985, as amended (" _COBRA_ "), to all employees of the Company and its
Subsidiary and their eligible dependents who have experienced a qualifying
event before the Closing Date.

(g) Nothing contained in this _Section 6.12_ shall be construed to create
any beneficiary rights in any employee or former employee (including any
dependent thereof) of the Company or its Subsidiaries in respect of continued
employment for any specified period, nor to require the Buyer, the Company or
its Subsidiaries to continue any specific employee benefit plans.

Section 6.13 _Exclusivity_. The Seller and the Company shall not, and shall
cause the Sellers Affiliates, the Companys Subsidiaries and each of their
respective officers, directors, employees and Representatives to not, directly
or indirectly, (a) initiate, solicit, encourage, engage in discussions,

by Seller, the Company or otherwise) or take any action intended or designed
to facilitate any inquiries or the making or implementation of any proposal
or offer (other than with the Buyer) with respect to an acquisition,
consolidation or similar transaction, or any purchase of all or any
significant portion of the assets or capital stock of the Company or any of
its Subsidiaries, or any possible business combination therewith (whether by
way of merger, purchase of capital stock, purchase of assets or otherwise)
(any such combination, acquisition, proposal or offer being hereinafter
referred to as an " _Acquisition Proposal_ "), (b) provide any information or
data with respect to the Company or its Subsidiaries to, other than the Buyer,
any Person relating to an Acquisition Proposal, (c) enter into an agreement,
letter of intent or other writing with any Person, other than the Buyer,

statement, recommendation or

Seller and the Company shall, and shall cause each of its Affiliates and
Subsidiaries and each of their respective Representatives to, immediately

of any inquiries, proposals or offers, requests for information or requests
for discussions or negotiations regarding any Acquisition Proposal or any
