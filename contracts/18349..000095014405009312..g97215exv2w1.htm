I. THE MERGER 

   

 (A) Structure of the Merger. On the Effective Date (as defined in Article VII), Riverside will merge (the "Merger") with and into Synovus, with Synovus being the surviving corporation (the "Surviving Corporation") under the name Synovus Financial Corp. pursuant to the applicable provisions of the Georgia Business Corporation Code ("Georgia Act"). On the Effective Date, the articles of incorporation and bylaws of the Surviving Corporation shall be the articles of incorporation and bylaws of Synovus in effect immediately prior to the Effective Date. 

  

 Also on the Effective Date, or as soon thereafter as is practicable, the parties shall cause Riverside Bank, a wholly-owned subsidiary of Riverside, to be merged with and into Bank of North Georgia, a wholly-owned subsidiary of Synovus, with Bank of North Georgia as the resulting bank of the merger. After the merger the former offices of Riverside Bank will operate as branch offices of Bank of North Georgia. 

   ##### 

  

  

 (B) Effect on Outstanding Shares. Immediately prior to the Merger: (1) each outstanding share of Riverside Class A Common Stock shall remain outstanding and unchanged; and (2) each outstanding share of Riverside Class B Common Stock shall be converted on a one-for-one basis into a share of Riverside Class A Common Stock. The shares of Riverside Class A Common Stock described in clause (1) above and the shares of Riverside Class A Common Stock of Riverside to be issued pursuant to clause (2) above are hereinafter collectively referred to as "Riverside Stock." 

  

 By virtue of the Merger, automatically and without any action on the part of the holder thereof, each share of Riverside Stock issued and outstanding on the Effective Date shall be converted into and exchangeable for the right to receive 1.0312 shares of Synovus Common Stock ("Per Share Exchange Ratio"). 

  

 As of the Effective Date, each share of Riverside Common Stock held as treasury stock of Riverside shall be canceled, retired and cease to exist, and no payment shall be made in respect thereof. 

  

 No fractional shares of Synovus Common Stock shall be issued in connection with the Merger. Each holder of Riverside Stock who would otherwise have been entitled to receive a fraction of a share of Synovus Common Stock shall receive, in lieu thereof, cash (without interest) in an amount equal to such fractional part of a share of Synovus Common Stock multiplied by the closing price per share of Synovus Common Stock on the New York Stock Exchange ("NYSE") on the last business day immediately preceding the Effective Date. 

  

 Each holder of Riverside Stock will be entitled to ten (10) votes for each share of Synovus Common Stock to be received by him/her on the Effective Date pursuant to a set of resolutions adopted by the Board of Directors of Synovus on September 6, 2005, in accordance with and subject to those certain Articles of Amendment to Synovus Articles of Incorporation, dated April 24, 1986. Synovus shall provide Riverside with certified copies of such resolutions prior to the Effective Date. 

  

 The shares of Synovus Common Stock issued and outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Date shall remain outstanding and unchanged after the Merger. 

  

 If, between the date of this Agreement and the Effective Date, the outstanding shares of Synovus Common Stock shall be increased, decreased, changed into or exchanged for a different number or class of shares by reason of any reorganization, reclassification, recapitalization, stock dividend, stock split, reverse stock split, or other like changes in Synovus capitalization, then an appropriate and proportionate adjustment shall be made to the Per Share Exchange Ratio so as to prevent the dilutive effect of such transaction on a percentage of ownership basis. 

   ##### 

  

  

 (C) General Procedures. Certificates which represent shares of Riverside Stock that are outstanding on the Effective Date (each, a "Certificate") and are converted into shares of Synovus Common Stock pursuant to the Plan shall, after the Effective Date, be deemed to represent shares of the Synovus Common Stock into which such shares have become converted and shall be exchangeable by the holders thereof in the manner provided in the transmittal materials described below for new certificates representing the shares of Synovus Common Stock into which such shares have been converted. 

  

 As promptly as practicable after the Effective Date, Synovus shall send to each holder of record of shares of Riverside Stock outstanding on the Effective Date transmittal materials for use in exchanging the Certificates for such shares for certificates for shares of the Synovus Common Stock into which such shares of the Riverside Stock have been converted pursuant to the Plan. Upon surrender of a Certificate, duly endorsed as Synovus may require, the holder of such Certificate shall be entitled to receive in exchange therefor the consideration set forth in paragraph (B) of Article I and such Certificate shall forthwith be canceled. No dividend or other distribution payable after the Effective Date with respect to the Synovus Common Stock shall be paid to the holder of any unsurrendered Certificate until the holder thereof surrenders such Certificate, at which time such holder shall receive all dividends and distributions, without interest thereon, previously withheld from such holder pursuant hereto. After the Effective Date, there shall be no transfers on the stock transfer books of Riverside of shares of Riverside Stock which were issued and outstanding on the Effective Date and converted pursuant to the provisions of the Plan. If after the Effective Date, Certificates are presented for transfer to Riverside, they shall be canceled and exchanged for the shares of Synovus Common Stock deliverable in respect thereof as determined in accordance with the provisions of paragraph (B) of Article I and in accordance with the procedures set forth in this paragraph. In the case of any lost, mislaid, stolen or destroyed Certificate, the holder thereof may be required, as a condition precedent to the delivery to such holder of the consideration described in paragraph (B) of Article I, to deliver to Synovus a bond in such sum as Synovus may direct as indemnity against any claim that may be made against the exchange agent, Synovus or Riverside with respect to the Certificate alleged to have been lost, mislaid, stolen or destroyed. 

  

 After the Effective Date, holders of Riverside Stock shall cease to be, and shall have no rights as, stockholders of Riverside, other than to receive shares of Synovus Common Stock into which such shares have been converted, fractional share payments pursuant to the Plan and any dividends or distributions with respect to such shares of Synovus Common Stock. 

  

 Notwithstanding the foregoing, neither Synovus nor Riverside nor any other person shall be liable to any former holder of shares of Riverside Stock for any amounts paid or property delivered in good faith to a public official pursuant to applicable abandoned property, escheat or similar laws. 

   ##### 

  

  

 (D) Options. On the Effective Date, each option granted by Riverside to purchase shares of Riverside Stock (each a "Riverside Stock Option"), whether vested or unvested, which is outstanding and unexercised immediately prior thereto, shall be assumed by Synovus and converted automatically into an option to purchase shares of Synovus Common Stock (each a "Synovus Stock Option") in an amount and at an exercise price determined as provided below (and otherwise having the same duration and other terms as the original option): 

  

       | (1)  |   | The number of shares of Synovus Common Stock
to be subject to the new option shall be equal to the product of the number
of shares of Riverside Stock subject to the original option multiplied by the
Per Share Exchange Ratio, provided that any fractional shares of Synovus
Common Stock resulting from such multiplication shall be rounded down to the
nearest whole share; and  
---|---|---|--- 
      
    | (2)  |   | The exercise price per share of Synovus Common Stock
under the new option shall be equal to the exercise price per share of
Riverside Stock under the original option divided by the Per Share Exchange
Ratio, provided that such exercise price shall be rounded up to the nearest
cent.  
   

  

 The adjustment provided herein with respect to any options which are "incentive stock options" (as defined in Section 422 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 (the "Code")) shall be and is intended to be effected in a manner which is consistent with Section 424(a) of the Code. 

  

 Within thirty (30) days after the Effective Date, Synovus shall notify each holder of an option to purchase Riverside Stock of the assumption of such options by Synovus. Such notice will effect the revisions to the options, which shall be effective as of the Effective Date. No payment shall be made for fractional interests. From and after the date hereof, no additional options to purchase Riverside Stock shall be granted. Synovus shall take all corporate action necessary to reserve for issuance a sufficient number of shares of Synovus Common Stock for delivery upon exercise of the Synovus Stock Options. As soon as practicable after the Effective Date, Synovus shall file a registration statement on Form S-8 (or any successor or other appropriate forms) with respect to the shares of Synovus Common Stock subject to any Synovus Stock Options held by persons who are or were directors, officers or employees of Riverside. 

  

 (E) Dissenting Shareholders. Any holder of shares of Riverside Stock who perfects such holders dissenters rights in accordance with the Georgia Act shall be entitled to receive from the Surviving Corporation the value of such shares in cash as determined pursuant to such provision of the Georgia Act; provided, that no such payment shall be made to any dissenting shareholder unless and until such dissenting shareholder has complied with the applicable provisions of the Goergia Act and surrendered to the Surviving Corporation the certificate or 

   ##### 

  

 

certificates representing the shares for which payment is being made. In the
event that after the Effective Date a dissenting shareholder of Riverside
fails to perfect, or effectively withdraws or loses, such holders right to
appraisal of and payment for such holders shares, the Surviving Corporation
shall issue and deliver the consideration to which such holder of shares of
Riverside Stock is entitled under paragraph (B) of this Article I (without
interest) upon surrender by such holder of the certificate or certificates
representing the shares of Riverside Stock held by such holder.

 (R) Riverside will, within thirty (30) days after the date hereof, engage a firm satisfactory to Synovus to conduct: (a) a Phase I environmental site assessment of the banking facilities currently owned by Riverside upon which Riverside is conducting a banking business, which assessment shall meet the standards of ASTM E1527-00 and shall include at a minimum a site history, on-site inspection, asbestos sampling of presumed asbestos containing material, evaluation of surrounding properties and soil tests if the results of the Phase I indicate a need therefor; and (b) a transaction screen that meets the standards of ASTM E 1528 for the property that Riverside leases, and in addition, Riverside agrees to conduct a Phase I assessment of the leased property if, in Synovus reasonable judgment, the transaction screen indicates potential environmental liabilities associated with the leased properties accruing to Riverside or Riversides successor.

Delivery of the Phase I assessments and transaction screen satisfactory to Synovus is an express condition precedent to the consummation of the Merger. Within fifteen (15) days after receipt of these reports, Synovus shall notify Riverside in writing whether or not, in the reasonable judgment of Synovus, any potential liabilities identified in such reports could reasonably be expected to have or result in a Material Adverse Effect on Riverside. In the event that Synovus determines, in its reasonable judgment, any potential liabilities identified in such reports could reasonably be expected to have or result in a Material Adverse Effect on Riverside, such written notification shall include a statement by Synovus regarding whether or not it intends to terminate this Agreement based upon the results of such reports.

Without limiting the foregoing, in any case in which approval by Synovus is required to effectuate any indemnification, Synovus shall direct, at the election of the Indemnified Party, that the determination of any such approval shall be made by independent counsel mutually agreed upon between Synovus and the Indemnified Party; 

  

 (2) Any Indemnified Party wishing to claim indemnification under paragraph (T)(1) above upon learning of any such liability or litigation, shall promptly notify Synovus thereof. In the event of any such litigation (whether arising before or after the Effective Date), (a) Synovus shall have the right to assume the defense thereof, and Synovus shall not be liable to such Indemnified Parties for any legal expenses of other counsel or any other expenses subsequently incurred by such Indemnified Parties in connection with the defense thereof, except that if Synovus elects not to assume such defense or counsel for the Indemnified Parties advises that there are substantive issues which raise conflicts of interest between Synovus and the Indemnified Parties, the Indemnified Parties may retain counsel satisfactory to them, and Synovus shall pay all reasonable fees and expenses of such counsel for the Indemnified Parties promptly as statements therefor are received; provided, that Synovus shall be obligated pursuant to this paragraph (T)(2) to pay for only one firm of counsel for all Indemnified Parties in any jurisdiction, (b) the Indemnified Parties will cooperate in the defense of any such litigation, and (c) Synovus shall not be liable for any settlement effected without its prior written consent, which will not unreasonably be withheld; and provided further, that Synovus shall not have any obligation hereunder to any Indemnified Party when and if a court of competent jurisdiction shall determine, and such determination shall have become final, that the indemnification of such Indemnified Party in the manner contemplated hereby is prohibited by applicable law; 

  

 (U) in the case of Synovus, it will make available to Riverside 25,000 shares of Synovus Common Stock to be distributed on the Effective Date in the discretion of Riversides executive management to key employees of Riverside in the form of restricted stock awards; and 

  

 (V) prior to the Effective Date, Riverside will use its best efforts to take all steps required to exempt the transactions contemplated by this Agreement from any applicable state anti-takeover law.
