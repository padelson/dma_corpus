Certificate to be lost, mislaid, stolen or destroyed (together with such
holders duly executed Letter of Transmittal), (ii) such customary contractual
indemnity as Parent may reasonably require, (iii) any other documents

thereof) that remains unclaimed by the former stockholders of the Company for

similar Laws) for payment of their claim for the Common Stock Settlement
Payments, without any interest thereon.

IRS Forms W-8 or W-9, as applicable, or similar information from
the Stockholders and any other recipients or payments hereunder prior to such
Stockholder being entitled to receive any such payments. To the extent such
amounts are so deducted or withheld and properly remitted to the appropriate
Governmental Authority, such amounts shall be treated for all purposes under
this Agreement as having been paid to the Person to whom such amounts would
otherwise have been paid.

 

 _No Liability for Abandoned Property_. Any other provision of this Agreement
notwithstanding, neither Parent, the Company nor the Surviving Corporation
shall be liable to any Company Holder for any amounts paid or property
delivered in good faith to a public official pursuant to any applicable
abandoned property, escheat or similar Law.

 

 _Forfeiture_. If and to the extent any Stockholder fails to deliver a Letter
of Transmittal and the related Stock Certificate or Lost Certificate
Affidavit and such other items as required under _Section 3.07(c)_ to the
Paying Agent within one (1) year of the Closing Date, then any Merger
Consideration in respect thereof shall, to the extent permitted by
any applicable Law, become the property of the Surviving Corporation, free
and clear of all claims or interest of any Person previously entitled thereto
(other than the claims of the applicable Stockholder and its heirs, assigns
and transferees hereunder), and such Stockholder shall look only to the
Surviving Corporation for payment of such amounts.

 

 _Rights of Former Stockholders_. At the Effective Time, the stock transfer
books of the Company shall be closed, and no transfer of Common Stock or
Company Restricted Stock by

 



27  any such holder shall thereafter be made or recognized. Until surrendered
for exchange in accordance with the provisions of _Section 3.07_, each Stock
Certificate theretofore representing a share of Common Stock (other than any
Excluded Share) shall from and after the Effective Time represent for all
purposes only the right to receive the Aggregate Common Stock Payments or
Aggregate Restricted Stock Payments, as applicable, in respect of a share of
Common Stock as set forth in this _Article III_. The Merger Consideration
payable in accordance with the terms of this _Article III_ shall be deemed to
have been paid in full satisfaction of all rights pertaining to the Common
Stock, Company Restricted Stock and Company Options. If, after the Effective
Time, Stock Certificates or lost Stock Certificates pursuant to _Section
3.07(b)_ are presented to the Surviving Corporation for transfer or any other
reason, they shall be canceled and exchanged as provided in this _Article
III_.

_Post-Closing Adjustment_.

 

(a) _Post-Closing Statement_. As soon as practicable, but in no event later
than seventy-five (75) days following the Closing Date, Parent shall cause to
be prepared and delivered to the Company Holders Representative a statement
(the " _Post-Closing Statement_ ") that sets forth in reasonable detail: (i) a
consolidated balance sheet of the Company and its Subsidiaries (without
giving effect to the transactions contemplated herein) (the " _Closing Balance
Sheet_ "); (ii) Parents calculation of the Closing Net Worth, including
Parents calculation of the Outstanding Company Indebtedness, if any, and the
Transaction Expenses (the " _Applicable Closing Net Worth_ "); (iii) Parents
calculation of the Tax Benefit Amount based on the Transaction Expenses as set
forth in the Post-Closing Statement (the " _Applicable Tax Benefit Amount_
"); (iv) Parents calculation of the Deferred Tax Asset Amount (" _Applicable
DTA_ "); and (v) Parents calculation of the Post-Closing Adjustment.

 

(b) The Post-Closing Statement and the Closing Balance Sheet contained therein
(which Post-Closing Statement shall include, for the avoidance of doubt, the
Applicable Closing Net Worth (including Parents calculation of the
Outstanding Company Indebtedness, if any, and the Transaction Expenses), the
Applicable Tax Benefit Amount and Applicable DTA) shall each be prepared as of
the Calculation Time, in the same format as the Reference Closing Statement
and the Reference Balance Sheet, respectively, and in accordance with the
Accounting Methodologies.

 

(c) _Disputes_.

 

(i) If the Company Holders Representative shall have any disagreement with
respect to the Post-Closing Statement, including the calculation of any of
the line items in the Closing Balance Sheet, the Applicable Closing Net Worth,
the Applicable Tax Benefit Amount, Applicable DTA or the Post-Closing
Adjustment, the Company Holders Representative will give written notice to
Parent within sixty (60) days following the delivery of the Post-Closing
Statement to the Company Holders Representative (the " _Notice of
Disagreement_ "). The Notice of Disagreement shall specify, in reasonable
detail, the amount of the proposed adjustment for each line item in dispute
(each, a " _Disputed Item_ "), the substance of any disagreement asserted, and
the basis therefor. The failure by the Company Holders Representative to
deliver a Notice of Disagreement within such sixty (60) day period will
constitute the Company Holders Representatives acceptance of the Post-
Closing Statement and the Post-Closing 

 



28  Adjustment as determined by Parent. If Parent and the Company Holders
Representative agree on the Post-Closing Statement and the Post-Closing
Adjustment, they shall so signify in writing. Any item contained in the Post-
Closing Statement for which the Company Holders Representative has not
delivered to Parent a Notice of Disagreement within such sixty (60) day period
shall be deemed final and binding on the Parties.

 

(ii) If the Notice of Disagreement is timely delivered by the Company Holders
Representative as provided herein, Parent, on the one hand, and the Company
Holders Representative, on the other hand, will, during the fifteen (15) days
following delivery of the Notice of Disagreement, use their reasonable efforts
to reach agreement on any Disputed Items set forth in the Notice of
Disagreement. For the purposes of complying with this _Section 3.13(c)_,
between the date of delivery of the Post-Closing Statement and the date on
which the Post-Closing Statement becomes final and binding pursuant to this
_Section 3.13(c)_, Parent shall provide the Company Holders Representative
and its representatives upon prior written request of the Company Holders
Representative, reasonable access to the Companys work papers and any work
papers of the Companys independent accountants, in each case, to the extent
used in the preparation of the Post-Closing Statement or the Reference Balance
Sheet, and Parent shall make reasonably available to the Company Holders
Representative and its representatives relevant Company personnel responsible
for the preparation of the Post-Closing Statement, in each case for the
purpose of assisting in the Company Holders Representatives review of
the Post-Closing Statement; _provided_ that, the independent accountants of
the Company shall not be obligated to make any work papers available to the
Company Holders Representative unless and until the Company Holders
Representative has signed a customary agreement relating to access to work
papers in form and substance reasonably acceptable to such independent
accountants. If the Company Holders Representative and Parent reach a written
agreement with respect to all of the Disputed Items, the Company Holders
Representative and Parent shall mutually revise the Post-Closing Statement to
effect such agreement and the resulting calculation of the Closing Balance
Sheet, the Applicable Closing Net Worth, or the Post-Closing Adjustment, as
applicable in accordance therewith, and such revised Post-Closing Statement
shall be final and binding upon the Parties.

 

(iii) If Parent and the Company Holders Representative are unable to reach
agreement on the Disputed Items within fifteen (15) days after the Company
Holders Representatives delivery of the Notice of Disagreement to Parent,
Parent and the Company Holders Representative will promptly refer the
Disputed Items for determination and resolution to a nationally-recognized
accounting firm to be mutually agreed by Parent and the Company Holders
Representative; _provided_ that, if Parent and the Company Holders
Representative do not mutually agree on such Person within five (5) Business
Days of the end of such fifteen (15) day period, Parent or the Company
Holders Representative may request the American Arbitration Association (or
successor thereof) to select a qualified, nationally-recognized accounting
firm having no material business relationship with any Party or Stockholder
that would reasonably be expected to result in a conflict of interest under
applicable professional responsibility rules (such accounting firm so agreed
or selected, the " _Independent Expert_ "). For the avoidance of

 



29  doubt, the Independent Expert shall act as an expert, not as an arbitrator,
and the determination of the Independent Expert, and this agreement to submit
to the determination of the Independent Expert, shall be governed by and
construed in accordance with Article 76 of the New York Civil Practice Law and
Rules. Each of the Company Holders Representative and Parent agree to enter
into a customary engagement letter with the Independent Expert.

(iv) At the time of submission of the Disputed Items to the Independent
Expert, Parent and the Company Holders Representative will each submit a
written statement setting forth in such detail as they deem appropriate their
respective positions with respect to only the Disputed Items. Parent and the
Company Holders Representative shall also have the opportunity to submit a
written response to the other partys written statement, not later than ten
(10) days following the date of receipt of the other partys initial written
statement. There will be no ex parte communications between Parent or the
Company Holders Representative and the Independent Expert with respect to the
Disputed Items, other than written answers by the parties to written questions
from the Independent Expert. All written communications to or from the
Independent Expert and Parent or the Company Holders Representative will be
delivered simultaneously to the other party. In determining the Disputed
Items, the Independent Expert (1) shall be bound solely by the Accounting
Methodologies and the Reference Closing Statement and (2) shall consider only
the Disputed Items. The determination of the Independent Expert with respect
to each Disputed Item shall be within the range represented by Parents and
the Company Holders Representatives respective positions as set forth in
their respective written communications and the Notice of Disagreement. Parent
and the Company Holders Representative shall use reasonable efforts to cause
the Independent Expert to deliver to Parent and the Company Holders
Representative, as promptly as practicable, and in any event within thirty
(30) days after referral of the disputed matters to the Independent Expert,
a written report setting forth its determination with respect to each of the
Disputed Items. The determination of the Independent Expert shall be final,
binding and conclusive, shall not be subject to appeal and shall be deemed to
have been accepted by Parent and the Company Holders Representative, subject
only to manifest error. The fees and expenses of the Independent Expert shall
be borne by Parent, on the one hand, and by the Company Holders
Representative (solely on behalf of the Company Holders), on the other hand,
in inverse proportion as they may prevail on the matters resolved by the
Independent Expert, which allocation shall be calculated on an aggregate basis
based on the relative dollar values of the amounts in dispute and shall be
determined by the Independent Expert at the time the Independent Expert
renders its determination on the merits of the matters submitted to it.

 

(v) The Post-Closing Statement, (1) as agreed upon by Parent and the Company
Holders Representative or deemed accepted by the Company Holders
Representative, or (2) as finally determined by the Independent Expert
pursuant to this _Section 3.13(c)_, shall be referred to herein as the "
_Final Closing Statement_." The Closing Balance Sheet, (A) as agreed upon by
Parent and the Company Holders Representative or deemed accepted by the
Company Holders Representative or (B) as finally determined by the
Independent Expert pursuant to this  _Section 3.13(c)_, shall be referred to
herein as the " _Final Closing Balance Sheet_." The Applicable Closing Net
Worth, (I) as agreed upon by

 



30  Parent and the Company Holders Representative or deemed accepted by the
Company Holders Representative or (II) as finally determined by the
Independent Expert pursuant to this  _Section 3.13(c)_, shall be referred to
herein as the " _Final Closing Net Worth_." The Applicable Tax Benefit Amount,
(X) as agreed upon by Parent and the Company Holders Representative or deemed
accepted by the Company Holders Representative or (Y) as finally determined
by the Independent Expert pursuant to this _Section 3.13(c)_, shall be
referred to herein as the " _Final Tax Benefit Amount_." The Applicable
DTA, (i) as agreed upon by Parent and the Company Holders Representative or
deemed accepted by the Company Holders Representative or (ii) as finally
determined by the Independent Expert pursuant to this _Section
3.13(c)_, shall be referred to herein as the " _Final DTA_."

(d) _Post-Closing Adjustment_. The Post-Closing Adjustment shall be paid to
Parent or to the Company Holders as follows:

(i) If the Post-Closing Adjustment is a positive amount, then Parent shall
promptly (and no later than five (5) Business Days following final
determination thereof) pay to each Company Holder through the Paying Agent
pursuant to the Paying Agent Agreement in cash an amount equal to the product
of (A) the Post-Closing Adjustment multiplied by (B) such Company Holders
Specified Percentage in accordance with the instructions provided in such
Company Holders Letter of Transmittal; _provided_ that, any amount to be paid
to an Optionholder or to a holder of Company Restricted Stock pursuant to
this paragraph shall instead be paid to the Surviving Corporation and then
promptly (but in no event later than four (4) Business Days after such
determination) remitted by the Surviving Corporation to any such Optionholder
or holder of Company Restricted Stock by check, direct deposit or wire
transfer of immediately available funds.

 

(ii) If the Post-Closing Adjustment is a negative amount, then, subject to the
Letter Agreement, Parent and the Company Holders Representative shall
promptly (and no later than four (4) Business Days following the final
determination thereof) provide a joint written instruction to the Escrow Agent
to deliver promptly from the Adjustment Escrow Account to Parent an amount
equal to the lesser of the Post-Closing Adjustment and the Adjustment Escrow
Amount, up to the full amount of the Adjustment Escrow Amount.

 

(iii) If the Post-Closing Adjustment is zero, no payment in respect thereof
will be made.

 

(iv) Payments of the Post-Closing Adjustment as a result of this _Section
3.13_ will be deemed adjustments to the Merger Consideration.

(e) _Adjustment Escrow Account Release_. Promptly after determination of the
Post-Closing Adjustment in accordance with this _Section 3.13_ and related
payment of the Post-Closing Adjustment, if any, all amounts held in the
Adjustment Escrow Account (to the extent not utilized pursuant to the terms of
this _Section 3.13_) shall be released by the Escrow Agent from the
Adjustment Escrow Account and distributed to the Company Holders on a pro rata
basis based on their respective Specified Percentages pursuant to the terms of
the Escrow Agreement; 

 



31   _provided_ that any amount to be delivered to an Optionholder or to a
holder of Company Restricted Stock pursuant to this paragraph shall be
delivered to the Surviving Corporation and then promptly (but in no event
later than four (4) Business Days after such delivery) remitted by the
Surviving Corporation to any such Optionholder or holder of Company Restricted
Stock by check, direct deposit or wire transfer of immediately available
funds. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained herein, for the
avoidance of doubt, payment to any Company Holder pursuant to _Section
3.13(d)_ or ( _e_ ) shall only be made in the event such Company Holder
has delivered to Parent those materials required to be delivered pursuant to
_Section 3.06(b)_ and _Section 3.07(b)_, as the case may be.

 

 _REPRESENTATIONS AND WARRANTIES OF THE COMPANY_

 

Except as set forth in the disclosure schedule delivered by the Company to
Parent concurrently with the execution of this Agreement (the " _Company
Disclosure Schedule_ "), the Company hereby represents and warrants to Parent
and Merger Sub as of the date hereof and as of the Closing Date as follows:

 

 _Organization, Standing and Power_.

 

(a) The Company is a corporation duly organized, validly existing and in good
standing under the Laws of the State of Delaware and has all requisite
corporate power and authority to own or lease all of its properties and assets
and to carry on its business as it is now being conducted. The Company is duly
qualified to do business or licensed and is in good standing in each
jurisdiction in which the nature of the business conducted by it or the
character or location of the properties or assets owned or leased by it makes
such licensing or qualification required by Law, except where the failure to
be so qualified, licensed or in good standing would not have a Company
Material Adverse Effect. The Company is not organized or qualified as a
foreign corporation in any jurisdiction.

 

(b) Each of the Companys Subsidiaries is duly organized, validly existing and
in good standing under the Law of the jurisdiction of its organization, has
all requisite power and authority to own or lease all of its properties and
assets and to carry on its business as it is now being conducted, and is duly
licensed or qualified to do business and is in good standing in
each jurisdiction in which the nature of the business conducted by it or the
character or location of the properties and assets owned or leased by it makes
such licensing or qualification required by Law, except where the failure to

Material Adverse Effect. _Section 4.01(b)_ of the Company Disclosure Schedule
sets forth the jurisdictions in which each Subsidiary of the Company is
organized and qualified as a foreign entity.

(c) The Company has made available to Parent complete and correct copies of
the Organizational Documents of the Company and each of its Subsidiaries,

is a party and to perform its

 



32  obligations hereunder and thereunder and to consummate the transactions
contemplated hereby and thereby. This Agreement and each Related Agreement to
which the Company is a party has been duly executed and delivered by the
Company and, assuming due authorization, execution and delivery hereof and
thereof by the other parties hereto and thereto, constitutes a legal, valid
and binding obligation of the Company, enforceable against the Company in
accordance with its terms, except as may be limited by bankruptcy, insolvency,
fraudulent transfer, reorganization, moratorium or other similar Law of
general application affecting or relating to the enforcement of creditors
rights generally or general principles of equity, whether considered in a
proceeding at Law or in equity (the " _Bankruptcy and Equity Exception_ ").

 

 _Noncontravention_.

(a) None of the execution and delivery by the Company of this Agreement and
each Related Agreement to which it is a party, the consummation by the Company
of the transactions contemplated hereby and thereby or compliance by the
Company with any of the terms or provisions hereof and thereof will (i)
conflict with or violate any provision of the Companys or any of its
Subsidiaries Organizational Documents or (ii) (1) assuming that the
authorizations, consents and approvals referred to in _Section 4.08_ are
obtained and the filings referred to in _Section 4.08_ of the Company
Disclosure Schedule are made, violate any Law applicable to the Company or any
of its Subsidiaries or by which any of their respective properties or assets
are bound, (2) with or without notice, lapse of time or both, violate, breach
or constitute a default under any of the terms, conditions or provisions of
any Material Contract or Permit or accelerate or give rise to a right of
termination, modification, cancellation or acceleration of any Material
Contract or Permit or (3) result in the creation of any Lien (other than any
Permitted Lien) on any properties or assets of the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries, except, in the case of clause (ii) (other than in respect of
Material Contracts), for such violations, defaults, accelerations, rights,
losses and Liens as would not reasonably be expected to be material to the
Company and its Subsidiaries, taken as a whole.

(b) The affirmative vote (in person or by proxy) at a meeting of the
Stockholders (or a written consent in lieu thereof) of the holders of a
majority of the outstanding shares of Common Stock in favor of the adoption of
this Agreement (the " _Stockholder Approval_ ") is the only vote of the
holders of any class or series of capital stock or debt or equity securities
of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries which is necessary to adopt and
approve this Agreement or approve the transactions contemplated hereby.

 

(c) Concurrent with the execution of this Agreement, the Company has delivered
to Parent a copy of the executed actions by written consent of the Identified
Company Stockholders (the " _Stockholder Written Consents_ ") which,

the Identified Company Stockholders under and in accordance with Section
262\.

other supporting documents in connection therewith, required to be filed
with or submitted to the appropriate insurance regulatory authorities of the
jurisdiction in which it is domiciled or commercially domiciled on forms
prescribed or permitted by such authority (collectively, the " _SAP

transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial

except, in each case, for any deficiencies that, individually or in the
aggregate, would not reasonably be expected to be material to the Company and

been conducted in all material

 



34  respects in the Ordinary Course of Business, (b) no action has been taken

Governmental Authority, gives the other party the opportunity to attend and
participate in such meeting.

no event shall any Party be required to agree to take or enter into any
action which is not conditioned upon the Closing and (y) each Party may redact

_Section 6.02(b)(i)_ and the notification and report form pursuant to the HSR
Act pursuant to  _Section 6.02(b)(ii)_, any arrangement imposed by a

the Company or any of its Subsidiaries) shall be permitted under applicable

delineated in clauses (i)-(iii) above, if imposed by any such domiciliary
state regulator would be reasonably likely, together with all other
arrangements imposed by any such domiciliary state regulator pursuant to
clauses (i)-(iii) above, individually or in the aggregate, to have a material
and adverse impact on the aggregate economic benefits, taken as a whole, that
Parent and Merger Sub would otherwise reasonably expect to derive from the
consummation of the Merger had Parent, Merger Sub or any of their Affiliates
not been obligated to agree to or take such action (each of the arrangements
delineated in clauses (i)-(iii) above after taking into effect the following
proviso, a " _Burdensome Condition_ "); _provided_ , _however_ , that none of

the States of Arkansas, Florida, Indiana, Louisiana, Mississippi, South

referenced in this _Section 6.02_ hereof or in any amendment or supplement
thereto or (III) any arrangement imposed by statute generally on insurance
companies licensed or domiciled in the States of Arkansas, Florida, Indiana,

(X) a regulatory order or similar instrument applicable only to Parent, Merger
Sub or any of their Affiliates or any Insurance Company Subsidiary or (Y) a
condition or other restriction on any regulatory approval order or similar
instrument granted or proposed to be granted to Parent, Merger Sub or any of

Commitment Letters prior to Closing.

(l) The Company, in consultation with Parent, will use its reasonable best
efforts to obtain as promptly as practicable following the date hereof all
consents, approvals and waivers required by third parties so that all the

Schedule (the " _Third Party Approvals_ ") will remain in full force and
effect immediately following the Closing; _provided_ that, Parent and the
Company shall consult in good faith in preparing the documentation for such
Third Party Approvals. The Parties agree that in the event any costs or
expenses become payable to a counterparty (or any of its Affiliates) to a
Material Contract set forth on _Section 6.02(d)_ of the Company Disclosure
Schedule in connection with the procurement of the Third Party Approval
in respect of such Material Contract, such cost shall be borne solely by
Parent to the extent approved in writing in advance by Parent. If Parent

records held by them relating to the Business for a period of seven (7) years
from and after the Closing Date (or longer if required by applicable Law) and
shall make such records (or copies) and officers, management,
employees, advisors and representatives available, at reasonable times and
upon reasonable advance written notice, to the Stockholders and any of their
respective Affiliates or representatives as may be reasonably required by such
Person solely to the extent relating to and solely for use in

 



58  connection with any insurance claims by, Actions or Tax audits against,

preparation of financial statements of, any Stockholder or any of their
respective Affiliates; _provided_ that, from and after the Closing Date, such
Person shall, and shall cause its Affiliates and its and their respective
representatives to, keep all such information confidential and not otherwise
use or disclose any such records for any other reason or to any other Person
(except where such disclosure, upon the advice of outside counsel, is required
by applicable Law and only to the extent required by such Law and upon
prior notice to the Surviving Corporation). Notwithstanding anything to the
contrary contained in this _Section 6.04_, (a) no such access or examination
shall be permitted to the extent that it would reasonably be expected to cause
the Surviving Corporation or any of its Subsidiaries to lose the benefit of
an attorney-client or other legal privilege or obligation of confidentiality
or non-disclosure or conflict with any confidentiality obligations to which
the Surviving Corporation or any of its Subsidiaries is bound, in each case
with respect to information to be disclosed; _provided_ , _however_ , that
Parent shall request, but shall not be required to obtain, a waiver of any
such confidentiality obligations upon such Stockholders reasonable prior
written request; and _provided_ , _further_ , that Parent shall use
commercially reasonable efforts to seek alternative means to disclose such
information as nearly as possible without affecting attorney-client privilege
or conflicting with such confidentiality obligations (it being understood that
such commercially reasonable efforts shall not require Parent or any of its
Subsidiaries to pay any consideration or amend or modify any Contract) and
(b) none of Parent, the Surviving Corporation or its Subsidiaries shall be
required to provide access under this _Section 6.04_ with respect to any
business records or other information or employees relating to a dispute or
litigation with other Parties, the Company Holders or their Affiliates.

_Access to Information_.

 

(a) During the period from the date of this Agreement until the Closing or
earlier termination of this Agreement, and subject to applicable Law and
_Section 6.06_, Parent shall be entitled, through its representatives
(including its employees, legal advisors, financing sources, consultants and
accountants), to have such access to the properties, businesses, operations,
books and records of the Company and its Subsidiaries as it reasonably
requests in connection with Parents efforts to consummate the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement. Any such access and examination shall be
conducted on reasonable advance written notice, during regular business hours
and under reasonable circumstances and shall be subject to restrictions under
applicable Law. The Company shall cause the officers, employees, consultants,
agents, accountants, attorneys and other representatives of the Company and
its Subsidiaries to reasonably cooperate with Parent and Parents
representatives in connection with such access and examination, and Parent and
its representatives shall reasonably cooperate with the Company and its
Subsidiaries and their respective officers, employees, consultants, agents,
accountants, attorneys and other representatives and shall use their
commercially reasonable efforts to minimize any disruption to the Business.
Prior to the Closing, Parent and Parents representatives may contact and
communicate with employees of the Company and its Subsidiaries to the extent
necessary in connection with the consummation of the transactions contemplated
hereby without the prior written consent of the Company; _provided_ that,
such requested communication does not unreasonably interfere with the ongoing
operations of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries. Notwithstanding anything
herein to the contrary, no such access or examination shall be permitted to
the extent that it would (i) unreasonably disrupt the

 



59  operations of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries or (ii) would
reasonably be expected to cause the Company or any of the Companys
Subsidiaries to lose the benefit of an attorney-client or other legal
privilege or obligation of confidentiality or non-disclosure or conflict with
any confidentiality obligations to which the Company or any of the Companys
Subsidiaries is bound, in each case with respect to information to be
disclosed; _provided_ , _however_ , that the Company shall request, but shall
not be required to obtain, a waiver of any such confidentiality obligations
upon Parents reasonable prior written request; and  _provided_ , _further_ ,
that the Company shall use commercially reasonable efforts to seek alternative
means to disclose such information as nearly as possible without affecting
attorney-client privilege or conflicting with such confidentiality
obligations (it being understood that such commercially reasonable efforts
shall not require the Company or any of its Subsidiaries to pay any
consideration or amend or modify any Contract). Notwithstanding anything to
the contrary contained herein, prior to the Closing, (A) without the prior
written consent of the Company, Parent shall not, and shall cause its
officers, employees, legal advisors, consultants, agents, accountants and
other representatives not to, contact any customer, supplier, distributor,
independent contractor, landlord, lessor or bank of the Company or any of the
Companys Subsidiaries, other than in the ordinary course of Parents
business, with respect to the Company, any of the Companys Subsidiaries or
the transactions contemplated by this Agreement and (B) Parent shall have no
right to perform invasive or subsurface investigations of the properties or
facilities of the Company or any of the Companys Subsidiaries without the
prior written consent of the Company. The Parties shall cooperate with respect
to preparation and timely submission of Tax Returns in respect of Transfer
Taxes arising in connection with the transactions contemplated by
this Agreement and any Related Agreement. The Company does not make any
representation or warranty as to the accuracy of any information (if any)
provided pursuant to this _Section 6.05_ and neither Parent nor Merger Sub
may rely on the accuracy of any such information, in each case other than as
expressly set forth in the Companys representations and warranties contained
in _Article IV_. No investigation pursuant to this _Section 6.05_ or
otherwise by Parent, Merger Sub or their representatives shall be deemed to
modify any of the Companys representations and warranties contained in
_Article IV_.

 

(b) Each of Parent and Merger Sub acknowledges that the information provided
to Parent and Merger Sub in connection with this Agreement and the
transactions contemplated hereby is subject to the terms of the
Confidentiality Agreement, the terms of which are incorporated herein by
reference.

applicable Law, the Party intending to make

each case, who are subject to customary confidentiality obligations, (iii)
disclosure by a Party is required to enforce its rights and remedies under
this Agreement, (iv) disclosure is required by a Party to comply with its

to which disclosure is made pursuant to the foregoing.

(c) Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the contrary, following
Closing, the Company Holders Representative shall be permitted to: (i) after
the public announcement of the Merger, publicly announce that it has been
engaged to serve as the Company Holders Representative in connection with
the Merger as long as such announcement does not disclose any of the other
terms of the Merger, this Agreement or any Related Agreement, or any other
transaction contemplated by this Agreement or any Related Agreement;
_provided_ that, any such public announcement shall be subject to the Parents
prior review and consent (such consent not be unreasonably withheld,

the terms of this _Section 6.06_ or (B) to be bound by obligations of

those imposed on the Company Holders Representative pursuant to this _Section
6.06_.

 

 _Indemnification of Directors and Officers_.

 

(a) Parent agrees that for a period of six (6) years from and after the
Effective Time, it shall cause the Surviving Corporation and its Subsidiaries
to indemnify, defend and hold harmless, to the fullest extent permitted under
applicable Law and the Organizational Documents

 



61  of the Company and its Subsidiaries as in effect on the date hereof, all
past and present (as of the Closing Date) directors and officers of the
Company and its Subsidiaries (collectively, the " _D andO Indemnitees_") with
respect to all acts or omissions by them in their capacities as such or taken
at the request of the Company or any of the Companys Subsidiaries occurring
at or prior to the Closing. Parent agrees that all rights of the DandO
Indemnitees to advancement of expenses, indemnification and exculpation from
liabilities for acts or omissions occurring on or prior to the Closing Date as
provided in the certificate of incorporation or bylaws (or comparable
Organizational Documents) of the Company and any of the Companys
Subsidiaries, in each case, as in effect on the date hereof, and any
indemnification agreements of the Company or any of the Companys Subsidiaries
as set forth in _Section 6.07(a)_ of the Company Disclosure Schedule, or as
otherwise provided for in the Companys or any of the Companys Subsidiaries
Organizational Documents as in effect on the date hereof, shall survive the
Closing Date and shall continue in full force and effect in accordance with
their terms for no less than six (6) years following the Effective Time. Such
rights shall not be amended or otherwise modified during such six (6) year
period in any manner that would adversely affect the rights of any of the DandO
Indemnitees, unless such modification is required by Law or approved by each
such DandO Indemnitee. In addition, for a period of six (6) years from and after
the Effective Time, Parent shall cause the Surviving Corporation and its
Subsidiaries, as the case may be, to advance, pay or reimburse any expenses of
any DandO Indemnitee under this _Section 6.07_ as incurred to the fullest
extent permitted under applicable Law ( _provided_ that, the person to whom
expenses are advanced provides an undertaking to repay such advances to the
extent required by applicable Law and the Organizational Documents of the
Company and its Subsidiaries as in effect on the date hereof).

(b) For a period of six (6) years from and after the Effective Time, except as
required by applicable Law, Parent shall cause (i) the Organizational
Documents of the Surviving Corporation to contain provisions no less favorable
to the DandO Indemnitees with respect to limitation of liabilities, advancement
of expenses and indemnification than are set forth as of the date hereof in
the certificate of incorporation and bylaws of the Company and (ii) the
Organizational Documents of each Subsidiary of the Surviving Corporation to
contain provisions no less favorable to the DandO Indemnitees with respect to
limitation of liability, advancement of expenses and indemnification than are
set forth in such document as of the date hereof.

 

(c) For a period of six (6) years from and after the Effective Time, Parent
shall cause the Surviving Corporation to, reasonably cooperate in the defense
of any claim that is subject to the limitation of liability, advancement of
expenses or indemnification as contemplated by this _Section 6.07_ and to
provide access to properties and individuals as reasonably requested and
furnish or cause to be furnished records, information and testimony, and
attend such conferences, discovery proceedings, hearings, trials or appeals,
as may be reasonably requested in connection therewith.

 

(d) The Surviving Corporation shall, and shall cause its Subsidiaries to,
provide or maintain in effect for six (6) years from and after the Effective
Time, through the purchase of "run-off" coverage or otherwise, directors and
officers and corporate liability insurance covering those individuals who are
covered by the directors and officers and corporate liability insurance
policy or policies provided for directors and officers of the Company and the
Companys Subsidiaries as of the date hereof (the " _D andO Policy_") on terms 

 



62  comparable in all respects to the DandO Policy and such coverage shall contain
minimum aggregate limits of liability for directors and officers and
corporate liability insurance coverage for directors and officers of the
Company and its Subsidiaries with the amount of coverage at least equal to
that of the DandO Policies and deductibles no larger than those of the DandO
Policy; _provided_ , _however_ , that if such "run-off" or other coverage is
not available at a cost not greater than three hundred percent (300%) of the
annual premiums paid as of the date hereof under the DandO Policy (the "
_Insurance Cap_ ") (which premiums are set forth in _Section 6.07(d)_ of the
Company Disclosure Schedule), then the Surviving Corporation and its
Subsidiaries shall be required to obtain as much coverage as is possible under
substantially similar policies for such annual premiums as do not exceed the
Insurance Cap. The Surviving Corporations obligations under this paragraph
may be satisfied by the purchase of a "tail" insurance policy that provides
for the coverage described above.

 

(e) The obligations of Parent and the Surviving Corporation under this
_Section 6.07_ shall not be terminated or modified in such a manner as to
adversely affect any DandO Indemnitee to whom this _Section 6.07_ applies
without the consent of each affected DandO Indemnitee (it being expressly agreed
that the DandO Indemnitees to whom this _Section 6.07_ applies shall be third
party beneficiaries of this _Section 6.07_). The provisions of this _Section
6.07_ (i) are intended to be for the benefit of, and shall be enforceable by,
each DandO Indemnitee, his, her or its heirs and his or her representatives and
(ii) are in addition to, and not in substitution for, any other rights to
indemnification or contribution that any such Person may have by Law, Contract
or otherwise.

 

(f) In the event that the Surviving Corporation or any of its successors or
assigns (i) consolidates or merges with or into any other Person and is not
the continuing or surviving entity of such consolidation or merger or (ii)
transfers or conveys all or substantially all of its properties and assets to
any Person, then, and in each such case, proper provision shall be made by
Parent and the Surviving Corporation so that the successors and assigns of the
Surviving Corporation shall assume all of the obligations thereof set forth in
this _Section 6.07_.

 

(g) Nothing in this Agreement is intended to, shall be construed to or shall
release, waive or impair any rights to directors and officers insurance
claims under any policy that is or has been in existence with respect to the
Company or any of the Companys Subsidiaries or any of their respective
directors or officers, it being understood and agreed that
the indemnification provided for in this _Section 6.07_ is not prior to or
in substitution for any such claims under such policies.

 

(h) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary set forth herein, this _Section
6.07_ will not affect any rights or remedies otherwise available to any
Indemnified Party pursuant to _Article IX_.

_Employee Benefits_.

 

(a) During the period commencing at the Closing and ending on the first (1st)
anniversary of the Closing Date, Parent shall, or shall cause the Surviving
Corporation to, provide each continuing employee and officer of the Company
and its Subsidiaries with (i) at least the same base salary or wage level as
in effect immediately prior to the Effective Time and (ii) employee benefits,
bonus opportunities, perquisites and other terms as are provided to similarly
situated employees of Parent. Until the first (1st) anniversary of the
Closing Date,

 



63  Parent and the Company agree to keep in effect all severance and retention
plans, practices and policies that are applicable to employees and officers of
the Company and its Subsidiaries as of the date hereof and set forth in
_Section 6.08(a)_ of the Company Disclosure Schedule.

(b) For purposes of eligibility, vesting and entitlement to benefits,
including the determination of the level of vacation and severance pay
benefits under the benefit and compensation plans, programs, agreements and
arrangements of Parent, the Surviving Corporation or any of their respective
subsidiaries in which employees are eligible to participate following the
Closing (the " _Parent Plans_ "), Parent and the Surviving Corporation shall
credit each employee with his or her years of service with the Company, its
Subsidiaries and any predecessor entities, to the same extent as such employee
was entitled immediately prior to the Closing to credit for such service under
any similar Plan, except where such crediting would result in duplication of
benefits and for purposes of benefit accrual under any defined benefit
pension plan. The Parent Plans (other than dental benefits) shall credit such
employees for any deductibles and out-of-pocket expenses paid prior to the
Closing Date in satisfying any deductibles and out-of-pocket expenses in the
applicable plan year to which such deductibles and out-of-pocket expenses
relate.

(c) The Parties acknowledge and agree that all provisions contained in this
_Section 6.08_ with respect to employees of the Company and its Subsidiaries
are included for the sole benefit of the respective Parties and shall not
create any right (i) in any other Person, including any employee, former
employee or any participant or any beneficiary thereof in any Plan or Parent
Plan, except for the rights of an Optionholder or a holder of Company
Restricted Stock pursuant to Section 3.03 and Section 3.04 of this Agreement,
or (ii) to continued employment with the Company, any of its Subsidiaries,
Parent, the Surviving Corporation or any Affiliate of Parent. Nothing
contained in this  _Section 6.08_ is intended to be or shall be considered
to be an amendment or adoption of any plan, program, agreement, arrangement or
policy of the Company, any of its Subsidiaries, Parent, the Surviving
Corporation or any Affiliate of Parent nor shall it interfere with any such
Persons right to amend, modify or terminate any Plan (subject to the
foregoing provisions of this _Section 6.08_) or to terminate the employment
of any employee of the Company or its Subsidiaries for any reason; _provided_
that, the Surviving Corporation and its Subsidiaries shall be subject to the
provisions of _Section 6.08(a)_.

 

 _Subsequent Financial Statements_. From the date hereof until the Closing
Date, within twenty-five (25) days after the end of each calendar month, the
Company shall deliver to Parent an unaudited consolidated balance sheet of the
Company and its Subsidiaries as of the end of such month and a consolidated
income statement of the Company and its Subsidiaries for the portion of the
calendar year ended as of the end of such month, in each case, prepared in
accordance with the Accounting Methodologies (collectively, the " _Interim
Balance Sheets_ "); _provided_ , _however_ , that solely with respect to any
Interim Balance Sheet relating to a monthly period ending December 31st, the
Company shall deliver such Interim Balance Sheet within sixty (60) days after
the end of such calendar month. The Parties agree that any Interim Balance
Sheet delivered to Parent pursuant to this _Section 6.09_ shall be
exclusively for informational purposes, and shall not form the basis for any
claim, action, suit, proceeding or demand asserting Damages by any Person
whether pursuant to this Agreement or otherwise.

 



64 _Resignation of Company Directors_. The Company shall cause to be delivered to
Parent at or prior to the Closing a written resignation substantially in the

from each director of the Company and its Subsidiaries, which resignations
shall be effective as of the Effective Time.

[Intentionally Omitted].

to require each Optionholder who desires to exercise such Optionholders
Company Options between the date hereof and the Effective Time to execute and
become party to the Management Stockholders Agreement referenced in clause
(i) or (ii), as applicable, of the definition of Stockholders Agreement, which
shall include a waiver of any rights to demand appraisal under Section 262 of
the DGCL of the shares of Common Stock to be issued to such Optionholder
in connection with such exercise of Company Options.

 _Indemnification by Company Holders_. Following the Closing, the Company
Holders shall (severally, and not jointly, based on each Company Holders
Specified Percentage), subject to the provisions of this _Article IX_ and the
Escrow Agreement, indemnify and hold harmless each Parent Indemnified Party
from and against any and all Liabilities, damages, penalties, Taxes,
losses, amounts paid in settlement, and reasonable out-of-pocket costs and
expenses related thereto (including reasonable attorneys fees and reasonable
and documented out-of-pocket expenses and costs incurred in enforcing any of
the respective rights under this Agreement) (collectively, " _Damages_ "),
incurred by such Parent Indemnified Party, whether or not involving a Third
Party Claim, arising out of or resulting from:

 

(a) any inaccuracy in or breach of any representation or warranty of the
Company contained in _Article IV_ (except in the case of  _Section 4.05(c)_,
without giving effect to any materiality or Company Material Adverse Effect or
other similar qualifier contained therein for purposes of determining whether
an inaccuracy or breach has occurred and the amount of Damages attributable
thereto); or

(b) any breach of any covenant or agreement of the Company (for the period
prior to the Closing) contained in this Agreement.

_Indemnification by Parent_. Following the Closing, Parent shall, subject to
the provisions of this _Article IX_ , indemnify and hold harmless each
Company Holder Indemnified Party from and

 



68  against any and all Damages, incurred by such Company Holder Indemnified
Party, whether or not involving a Third Party Claim, arising out of or
resulting from:

 

(a) any inaccuracy in or breach of any representation or warranty of Parent or
Merger Sub contained in _Article V_ (in each case, without giving effect to
any materiality, Parent Material Adverse Effect or other similar qualifier
contained therein for purposes of determining whether an inaccuracy or breach
has occurred and the amount of Damages attributable thereto); or

 

(b) any breach of any covenant or agreement of Parent, Merger Sub or,
following the Closing, the Surviving Corporation contained in this Agreement.

_Indemnification Process_.

 

(a) Any Parent Indemnified Party or Company Holder Indemnified Party making a
claim for indemnification under _Section 9.01_ or  _Section 9.02_ (an "
_Indemnified Party_ ") may seek indemnification by giving written notice to
the applicable party or parties from whom indemnification is sought (the "
_Indemnifying Party_ "), specifying in reasonable detail (i) the
representation and warranty or covenant or other agreement that is alleged to
have been breached or to have given rise to indemnification, (ii) the facts
constituting the basis for such allegation and (iii) if known, the aggregate
amount of the Damages for which a claim is being made under _Section 9.01_ or
_Section 9.02_ or, to the extent that such Damages are not known or have not
been incurred at the time such claim is made, a good faith estimate of the
aggregate potential amount of such Damages. In the event that any claim for
indemnification hereunder results from or is in connection with a Third Party
Claim, the Indemnified Party shall provide written notice of such Third Party
Claim to the Indemnifying Party, which notice shall include the information
specified in clauses (i)-(iii) above (a " _Third Party Claim Notice_ ") as
soon as practicable after the Indemnified Party first receives notice of the
claim but in any event not later than seven (7) days following such notice;
_provided_ that, the Indemnified Party shall not be limited in seeking
indemnification pursuant to this _Article IX_ by any failure to provide such
notice of the existence of a claim to the Indemnifying Party except to the
extent that such Indemnifying Party is prejudiced as a result of such failure.
Any such notice pursuant to this first sentence of this _Section 9.03(a)_
or Third Party Claim Notice shall be given, if by a Parent Indemnified Party,
in accordance with the Escrow Agreement. To the extent there is any conflict
between this Agreement and the Escrow Agreement in respect of the mechanics
for distribution of the Indemnity Escrow Amount, the terms of the Escrow
Agreement will control.

(b) _Third Party Claims_.

 

(i) Except as otherwise provided in _Section 9.03(b)(ii)_, in the case of any
claim, action, suit, proceeding or demand asserted by a Person that is not a
party to this Agreement or its Affiliate (or a successor thereof) (a " _Third
Party Claim_ "), the Indemnifying Party may elect (at the expense of such
Indemnifying Party and with reputable counsel of its own choosing) by written
notice to the Indemnified Party delivered within fifteen (15) days from the
date of receipt of a Third Party Claim Notice, to assume and control the
defense of such Third Party Claim. If the Indemnifying Party does not assume
control of such defense in accordance with the terms hereof, the Indemnified
Party shall control such defense without prejudice to its rights hereunder.
The party not controlling any such defense may participate in such defense at
such partys sole cost and expense (including the costs and expenses of
counsel).

 



69 (ii) Notwithstanding _Section 9.03(b)(i)_, the Indemnifying Party shall have
no right to assume the defense of any Third Party Claim (A) in the event that
the Indemnified Party shall in good faith determine after consultation with
outside counsel that the Indemnified Party may have available to it one or
more defenses or counterclaims that are inconsistent with one or more of the
defenses or counterclaims that may be available to the Indemnifying Party in
respect of a Third Party Claim that would make it inappropriate for the same
counsel to represent both the Indemnifying Party and the Indemnified Party,
(B) if the Indemnified Party reasonably determines, after prior consultation
with the Company Holders Representative, that the amount of the Third Party
Claim if successful would be likely to exceed the Indemnifying Partys
Liability under this Agreement (including the amount then available in the
Indemnity Escrow Account) or (C) if such Third Party Claim seeks or could
reasonably be expected to result in the imposition of criminal penalties
against the Indemnified Party, which in each such case the reasonable and
documented out-of-pocket costs and expenses of counsel to the Indemnified
Party will be subject to the indemnity provided for in  _Section 9.01_ or
_Section 9.02_. If the Indemnifying Party fails to take reasonable steps
necessary to defend diligently a Third Party Claim after notifying the
Indemnified Party of its assumption of the defense and investigation of such
Third Party Claim, the Indemnified Party may assume such defense, and the
reasonable and documented out-of-pocket costs and expenses of counsel to the
Indemnified Party will be subject to the indemnity provided for in  _Section
9.01_ or _Section 9.02_, as applicable. Notwithstanding anything to the
contrary contained herein, in no event shall the Indemnifying Party be
responsible for the fees of more than one counsel for all Indemnified
Parties in each applicable jurisdiction. The party conducting the defense of
any Third Party Claim shall keep the other party advised of all significant
developments with respect to such Third Party Claim.

 

(iii) Neither the Indemnified Party nor the Indemnifying Party shall enter
into any settlement, compromise or consent to judgment with respect to such
Third Party Claim unless consented to by the Indemnified Party and the
Indemnifying Party in writing, which consent will not be unreasonably
withheld, conditioned or delayed; _provided_ that, the Indemnifying Party who
conducts the defense of a Third Party Claim may enter into any settlement,
compromise or consent to judgment the relief for which (A) consists solely of
monetary damages which shall be paid in full by the Indemnifying Party and
does not require any admission or acknowledgement of fault of the Indemnified
Party or its Affiliates and (B) which procures a full and unconditional
release of the Indemnified Party with respect to such Third Party Claim.

 

(iv) The Indemnified Party and the Indemnifying Party shall make reasonably
available to each other and their respective representatives all relevant
business records and other documents reasonably available to them that are
necessary or appropriate for the defense of any Third Party Claim, subject to
any bona fide claims of attorney-client privilege, and the Indemnified Party
shall use commercially reasonable efforts to assist, and to cause the
employees and counsel of such party to assist, at the cost of the Indemnifying
Party, in the defense of such Third Party Claim.

 



70 (c) For purposes of this _Section 9.03_, (i) any notices to be provided
or received by any Company Holder as an Indemnifying Party or Indemnified
Party pursuant to this _Section 9.03_ shall be provided or received, as
applicable, by the Company Holders Representative on behalf of the applicable
Company Holder(s) and (ii) the Company Holders Representative shall have the
sole and exclusive right and authority to make indemnification claims on
behalf of the Company Holders pursuant to the terms hereof and, as the context
may require, references herein to the Indemnified Party shall be construed
accordingly.

_Limitations on Indemnification_.

 

(a) _De Minimis Limitation and Deductible_. No claim for indemnification under
_Section 9.01(a)_ may be made by the Parent Indemnified Parties and no claim
for indemnification under _Section 9.02(a)_ may be made by the Company Holder
Indemnified Parties, and no payment in respect of such a claim for
indemnification shall be required from any Company Holder or Parent, as
applicable, (i) for any Damages arising from any individual claim under such
Sections, as applicable, (treating claims resulting from the same facts and
circumstances as an individual claim) that does not exceed twenty-five
thousand dollars ($25,000) (the " _De Minimis Limitation_ ") and (ii) until
the aggregate amount of Damages which the Parent Indemnified Parties or the
Company Holder Indemnified Parties, as applicable, have incurred on a
cumulative basis exceeds the Deductible, after which the Parent Indemnified
Parties or the Company Holder Indemnified Parties, as applicable, shall be
indemnified, subject to _Section 9.04(b)_, for all such Damages in excess of
the Deductible, as applicable; _provided_ that the foregoing De Minimis
Limitation and Deductible shall not apply to, and the Parent Indemnified
Parties or the Company Holder Indemnified Parties, as applicable, shall be
entitled to indemnification without regard to satisfaction of the De Minimis
Limitation and Deductible with respect to, claims for breach of any
Fundamental Representation.

(b)  _Maximum Damages_. Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement or the
Escrow Agreement to the contrary, subject to _Section 9.04(c)_ and without
derogation to the rights of any Parent Indemnified Party pursuant to the
Policy, the maximum aggregate amount of Damages against which (i) the Parent
Indemnified Parties shall be entitled to be indemnified by the Company Holders
under _Section 9.01_ shall be the remaining Indemnity Escrow Amount (if any)
and (ii) the Company Holder Indemnified Parties shall be entitled to be
indemnified by Parent under _Section 9.02_ shall be one million two hundred
seventy five thousand dollars ($1,275,000).

 

(c) _Types of Damages_. The Parties expressly acknowledge and agree that there
shall be no indemnification by an Indemnifying Party for any punitive,
exemplary, treble, consequential, incidental, special or indirect damages,
except, in each case, to the extent constituting direct, market-measured or
general damages or to the extent paid or payable to a claimant in respect of a
Third Party Claim.

(d) _Tax Benefit_. The amount of any Damages subject to indemnification under
this _Article IX_ shall be calculated net of any Tax benefit actually
realized by the Indemnified Party from the incurrence or payment of such
Damages (through a refund or reduction in Tax Liability) in the taxable year
immediately following the year in which the indemnification payment is made
or an earlier year.

 



71 (e) _Indemnity Escrow Account_. Without derogation to the rights of any
Indemnified Parties pursuant to the Policy, any indemnification of a Parent
Indemnified Party for any and all Damages pursuant to _Section 9.01_ shall be
paid solely and exclusively by release of remaining funds (if any) to such
Parent Indemnified Party from the Indemnity Escrow Account in accordance with
the terms of this Agreement and the Escrow Agreement.

(f) _Mitigation_. Any Indemnified Party shall use commercially reasonable
efforts to mitigate the amount of its Damages upon and after becoming aware of
any facts or circumstances that would reasonably be expected to result in any
Damages that are indemnifiable hereunder. Except to the extent otherwise
required by Law, Parent and the Surviving Corporation shall not, without the
prior consent of the Company Holders Representative, which consent shall not
be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed, take, or allow to be taken,
any action after the Closing that could increase any Company Holders
liability for Taxes.

(g)  _No Duplication_. Any liability for indemnification under this Agreement
shall be determined without duplication of recovery by reason of the state of
facts giving rise to such liability constituting a breach of more than one
representation, warranty, covenant or agreement.

(h) _Net Amounts_. The amount of any Damages sustained by an Indemnified Party
shall be reduced by any amount actually received by such Indemnified Party or
its Affiliates with respect thereto (i) under any insurance coverage relating
thereto (other than the Policy) and (ii) from any non-Affiliate Person alleged
to be responsible for any Damages, in each case, net of any reasonable and
documented out-of-pocket costs, expenses or premiums incurred in connection
with securing or obtaining such recovery under such insurance coverage or from
such non-Affiliate Person (including any increased premiums resulting
therefrom). The Indemnified Parties shall use reasonable best efforts to
collect any amounts available under insurance policies or recoverable from
non-Affiliate Persons with respect to Damages incurred by such Indemnified
Party. If the Indemnified Party or its Affiliates receive any amounts under
insurance policies, or from any non-Affiliate Person alleged to be responsible
for any Damages, in each case in connection with a matter giving rise to
an indemnification payment, but subsequent to such indemnification payment by
the Indemnifying Party, then such Indemnified Party shall promptly reimburse
the Indemnifying Party for any payment made or out-of-pocket expense incurred
by such Indemnifying Party in connection with providing such indemnification
payment up to the amount received by the Indemnified Party or its Affiliates,
net of any reasonable and documented out-of-pocket costs, expenses or premiums
incurred in connection with securing or obtaining such recovery under such
insurance coverage or from such non-Affiliate Person (including any increased
premiums resulting therefrom).

 

(i) _Final Closing Statement_. No Damages may be claimed hereunder by an
Indemnified Party, and no claims for Taxes may be claimed by Parent, to the
extent that such Damages or Taxes have been reflected or accrued or reserved
for as a Liability on the Final Closing Statement or otherwise taken into
account in the preparation or determination of the Final Closing Statement or
the Post-Closing Adjustment, if any, pursuant to _Section 3.13_.

(j) _Subrogation_. Except with respect to Taxes, in the event of payment by
or on behalf of any Indemnifying Party to any Indemnified Party pursuant to a
claim or demand in a

 



72  notice of a claim for indemnification pursuant to this _Article IX_ , such
Indemnifying Party shall be subrogated to and shall stand in the place of such
Indemnified Party as to any events or circumstances in respect of which such
Indemnified Party may have any right, defense or claim relating to such claim
or demand against any claimant or plaintiff asserting such claim or demand.
Such Indemnified Party shall cooperate with such Indemnifying Party in a
reasonable manner, and at the cost of such Indemnifying Party, in presenting
any subrogated right, defense or claim. The Policy shall contain a waiver of
all rights of subrogation to recover against the Company Holders except with
respect to Fraud.

_Survival_. The representations and warranties of the Company, Parent and
Merger Sub contained in this Agreement shall survive the Closing until the
Release Date (the " _Survival Period_ "). Any and all claims for
indemnification under this _Article IX_ arising out of any inaccuracy in or
breach of any representation or warranty of the Company, Parent or Merger Sub
must be made prior to the end of the Survival Period, it being understood that
in the event notice of any claim for indemnification submitted in compliance
with _Section 9.01(a)_ or  _Section 9.02(a)_ shall have been given within
the Survival Period, the representations and warranties with respect to such
indemnification claim shall survive until such time as such claim is finally
resolved, whether or not litigation has been commenced at such time to
resolve such claim. The covenants and agreements of the Parties under this
Agreement shall survive the Closing until the seven (7) year anniversary of
the Closing Date unless a shorter period of performance is specified with
respect to such covenant or agreement (and any pre-Closing covenants shall
survive the Closing for the Survival Period), it being understood that in the
event notice of any claim for indemnification submitted in compliance with 
_Section 9.01(b)_ or _Section 9.02(b)_ shall have been given within the
applicable survival period, the covenants and agreements solely with respect
to such indemnification claim shall survive until such time as such claim
is finally resolved, whether or not litigation has been commenced at such
time to resolve such claim.

_Treatment of Indemnification Payments_. In the event any claim for
indemnification under this _Article IX_ has been finally determined, the
amount of such final determination shall be paid if the Indemnified Party is
a: (i) Parent Indemnified Party, by the Escrow Agent to the Parent
Indemnified Party, pursuant to the terms and conditions of the Escrow
Agreement and (ii) Company Holder Indemnified Party, unless otherwise directed
by the Company Holders Representative, by Parent to the Paying Agent by wire
transfer of immediately available funds within fifteen (15) days after the
date upon which any underlying claims are finally resolved, for the benefit
of, and for further distribution to, the Company Holders, and the Paying Agent
shall promptly distribute such amount to the Company Holders on a pro rata
basis based on their respective Specified Percentages in accordance with the
written instructions of the Company Holders Representative, and Parent shall
be entitled to rely exclusively upon the written instructions of the Company
Holders Representative in paying such indemnification amounts; _provided_
that, at the request of the Company Holders Representative, a portion of any
such amount that is subject to employment tax withholding shall be paid to
the Surviving Corporation for payment through the Surviving Corporations
payroll system no later than the first regularly scheduled payroll date that
is at least four (4) Business Days following such request. Any claim, and the
liability for and amount of Damages therefor, shall be deemed to be "finally
determined" for purposes of this _Article IX_ and _Section 10.16(g)_ when the
parties hereto have so determined by mutual agreement or, if disputed, when a
final and non-appealable Order by a Governmental Authority has been entered
with respect to such claim. The Parties agree that any indemnification
payments made pursuant to this _Article IX_ shall be treated as an adjustment
to the Merger Consideration.

 



73 _Sole Remedy_. Following the Closing, the Parties acknowledge and agree that
the provisions of this _Article IX_ shall be the sole and exclusive remedy
for any breach of or inaccuracy in any representation or warranty, or breach
or failure to perform any covenant or agreement, contained in this Agreement,
except for (a) any claim of Fraud asserted against any Person who committed
such Fraud or against any Person who is responsible for Damages under this
_Article IX_ for such Fraud it being understood that (i) each Company Holder
shall be responsible (on a several and not joint basis) for any Fraud
committed by the Company or the Companys officers prior to the Closing and
(ii) no Company Holder will be responsible for the Fraud committed by any
other Company Holder, other than the Fraud of such other Company Holder
committed solely in its capacity as an officer of the Company, (b) claims for
equitable remedies under _Section 10.12(b)_ or (c) the matters referenced in
_Section 3.13_, which, in the case of the foregoing clauses (b) and (c)
shall be governed solely by such sections. Notwithstanding anything to the
contrary contained in this Agreement, no breach of or inaccuracy in any
representation or warranty, or breach or failure to perform any covenant or
agreement, contained in this Agreement shall give rise to any right on the
part of any party to rescind this Agreement or any Related Agreement or any of
the transactions contemplated hereby or thereby.

 

 _No Claim Against the Surviving Corporation_. Each Company Holder, solely in
its capacity as a Company Holder, waives any right of contribution against
the Surviving Corporation with respect to any indemnity claim arising out of
this Agreement to the extent that the Company, the Surviving Corporation or
any Parent Indemnified Party is determined to be entitled to indemnification
hereunder for such claim.

_Procedures Related to Tax Contests_. Notwithstanding the terms of  _Section
9.03(b)(i)_, if any deficiency, proposed adjustment, adjustment, assessment
audit, examination or other administrative or court proceeding, suit, dispute
or other claim commenced or initiated against the Surviving Corporation
or any of its Subsidiaries by any Tax authority following the Closing (a "
_Tax Contest_ "), would, if successful, require the Company Holders to fully
indemnify Parent pursuant to _Section 9.01_, the Company
Holders Representative shall have the right (but not the obligation), upon
timely written notice (which notice shall acknowledge the Company Holders
indemnification obligation with respect to such Tax Contest), to elect to
control, defend, settle, compromise, or contest such Tax Contest; _provided_
that, notwithstanding anything to the contrary set forth herein, (a) the
Company Holders Representative shall keep Parent reasonably informed of any
proceedings, events and developments related to or in connection with such
Tax Contest, (b) Parent shall be entitled to receive copies of all
correspondence and documents related to such Tax Contest, (c) the Company
Holders Representative shall consult with Parent and shall not enter into
any settlement with respect to any such Tax Contest without Parents prior
written consent, which will not be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or
delayed and (d) at its own cost and expense, Parent shall have the right to
participate in (but not control) the defense of such Tax Contest. Parent shall
give the Company Holders Representative written notice of any Tax Contest
within fifteen (15) days of receiving notice of such Tax Contest which may
give rise to any indemnity obligation of the Company Holders under _Section
9.01_. Failure to give prompt notice shall not affect the indemnification
obligations thereunder in absence of prejudice. Parent shall
reasonably cooperate with the Company Holders Representative in pursuing
such Tax Contest.

 



74  Parents out-of-pocket expenses incurred in connection with such
cooperation, including the cost of counsel, shall be reimbursed solely and
exclusively from the Indemnity Escrow Account. If the Company Holders
Representative does not elect to control such Tax Contest, Parent shall
control such Tax Contest but shall provide the Company Holders Representative
the same rights that Parent has in the event the Company Holders
Representative elects to control such Tax Contest pursuant to clauses (a)
through (c) above.

_Release of Indemnity Escrow Account_. On the date that is the fifteen (15)
month anniversary of the Closing Date (the " _Release Date_ "), all remaining
amounts held in the Indemnity Escrow Account, less the aggregate amount of all
claims, if any, claimed by the Parent Indemnified Parties (such claims, the "
_Outstanding Claims_ ") properly made in accordance with this _Article IX_ and
not fully paid or satisfied prior to the Release Date (the amount of which
will be retained in the Indemnity Escrow Account in accordance with the
Escrow Agreement) shall be promptly released by the Escrow Agent from the
Indemnity Escrow Account to the Company Holders on a pro rata basis based on
their respective Specified Percentages pursuant to the terms of the Escrow
Agreement. At any time after the Release Date, when an Outstanding Claim is
finally resolved and paid to the Parent Indemnified Party from the Indemnity
Escrow Account for less than the full amount that was reserved in respect of
such Outstanding Claim, the Escrow Agent will promptly release to the Company
Holders from the Indemnity Escrow Account following such distribution to the
Parent Indemnified Party an amount equal to the remaining funds then held in
the Indemnity Escrow Account, less the amounts reserved in respect of any then
remaining Outstanding Claims, which distribution to the Company Holders shall
be made on a pro rata basis based on their respective Specified Percentages
pursuant to the terms of the Escrow Agreement. Notwithstanding the foregoing,
any amount to be delivered to an Optionholder or to a holder of Company
Restricted Stock pursuant to this paragraph shall be delivered to the
Surviving Corporation for payment through Surviving Corporations payroll
system no later than the first regularly scheduled payroll date that is at
least four (4) Business Days following the Surviving Corporations receipt of
such funds.

 _Amendment/Waiver_. This Agreement may be amended, supplemented or changed
only by a written instrument signed by each of the Parties. Each provision in
this Agreement may be waived only by a written instrument making specific
reference to this Agreement signed by the Party against whom enforcement of
any such provision so waived is sought. No action taken pursuant to
this Agreement, including any investigation by or on behalf of any Party,
shall be deemed to constitute a waiver by the Party taking such action of
compliance with any representation, warranty, covenant or agreement contained
herein. The waiver by any Party of a breach of any provision of this
Agreement shall not operate or be construed as a further or continuing waiver
of such breach or as a waiver of any other or subsequent breach. No failure on
the part of any Party to exercise, and no delay in exercising, any right,
power or remedy hereunder shall operate as a waiver thereof, nor shall any
single or partial exercise of such right, power or remedy by such Party
preclude any other or further exercise thereof or the exercise of any
other right, power or remedy.

_Assignment_. No assignment of this Agreement or of any rights or obligations
hereunder may be made, directly or indirectly (by operation of law or
otherwise), by (i) the Company, without the prior written consent of Parent,
(ii) any of Parent or Merger Sub without the prior written consent of the
other Parties (but not including, after the Closing, the Surviving
Corporation) or (iii) the Company Holders Representative without the prior
written consent of Parent. Any attempted assignment without obtaining such
required consent shall be null and void.

 

 _Entire Agreement_. This Agreement (including the Confidentiality Agreement,
the Company Disclosure Schedule and the Parent Disclosure Schedule and the
documents attached thereto), the Related Agreements and the Stockholder
Written Consents represent the entire understanding and agreement among the
Parties with respect to the subject matter hereof and supersedes all other
prior agreements and understandings, both written and oral, among the Parties
with respect to the subject matter hereof.

_Fulfillment of Obligations_. Any obligation of any Party under this
Agreement, which obligation is performed, satisfied or fulfilled by an
Affiliate of such Party, shall be deemed to have been performed, satisfied or
fulfilled by such Party.

 

 _Parties in Interest_. This Agreement shall be binding upon and inure solely
to the benefit of each Party and its successors and permitted assigns and,
except as provided in _Section 6.07_, _Article IX_ , this _Section 10.06_,
_Section 10.13_ and _Section 10.14_, nothing in this Agreement, express or
implied, is intended to or shall confer upon any other person any rights,
benefits or remedies of any nature whatsoever under or by reason of this
Agreement. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Company Holders are third party
beneficiaries 

 



77  of _Article III_ , _Section 9.10_ and _Section 10.13_ (it being understood
that only the Company Holders Representative may take any action in respect
of such Sections (other than _Section 10.13_) following the Closing on
behalf of the Company Holders). For the avoidance of doubt, in the event of
Parent or Merger Subs breach of this Agreement, damages to the Company shall
include, to the extent proven, the loss of the benefit of the bargain to the
Company and the Company Holders.

_Expenses_. Except as otherwise expressly provided in this Agreement, whether
or not the transactions contemplated by this Agreement are consummated, all
direct and indirect costs and expenses incurred in connection with this
Agreement and the transactions contemplated hereby shall be borne by the
party incurring such expenses.

_Governing Law/Jurisdiction/Waiver of Jury Trial_.

 

(a) Except as otherwise set forth in _Section 3.13_, this Agreement, and all
claims or causes of action (whether in contract, tort or otherwise) that may
arise out of or relate to this Agreement or the negotiation, execution or
performance of this Agreement (including any claim or cause of action arising
out of or relating to any representation or warranty made in this
Agreement) shall be governed by and construed in accordance with the Laws of
the State of Delaware, regardless of the Laws that might otherwise govern
under applicable principles of conflicts of laws.

 

(b) Except as otherwise set forth in _Section 3.13_, each of the Parties
hereby irrevocably and unconditionally (i) submits, for itself and its
property, to the exclusive jurisdiction and venue of the Delaware Court of
Chancery (or, only if the Delaware Court of Chancery does not have
jurisdiction over a particular matter, the Superior Court of the State of
Delaware (and the Complex Commercial Litigation Division thereof if such
division has jurisdiction over the particular matter), or if the Superior
Court of the State of Delaware does not have jurisdiction, any federal or
state court of the U.S. sitting in the State of Delaware) (" _Delaware
Courts_ "), and any appellate court from any decision thereof, in any Action
arising out of or relating to this Agreement, including the negotiation,
execution or performance of this Agreement and agrees that all claims in
respect of any such Action shall be heard and determined in the Delaware
Courts, (ii) waives, to the fullest extent it may legally and effectively do
so, any objection which it may now or hereafter have to the laying of
venue of any Action arising out of or relating to this Agreement or the
negotiation, execution or performance of this Agreement in the Delaware
Courts, including any objection based on its place of incorporation, (iii)
waives, to the fullest extent permitted by Law, the defense of an
inconvenient forum to the maintenance of such Action in any such court and
(iv) agrees that a final judgment in any such Action shall be conclusive and
may be enforced in other jurisdictions by suit on the judgment or in any
other manner provided by Law. Each of the Parties consents and agrees that
service of process, summons, notice or document for any action permitted
hereunder may be delivered by registered mail addressed to it at the
applicable address set forth in _Section 10.01_ or in any other manner
permitted by applicable Law.

(c) THE PARTIES HEREBY IRREVOCABLY AND UNCONDITIONALLY WAIVE ANY RIGHT TO
TRIAL BY JURY IN ANY ACTION ARISING OUT OF OR RELATING TO THIS AGREEMENT OR
ANY TRANSACTION CONTEMPLATED HEREBY OR THE ACTIONS OF THE PARTIES IN THE
NEGOTIATION, EXECUTION, PERFORMANCE AND ENFORCEMENT OF THIS

 



78  AGREEMENT, WHETHER NOW EXISTING OR HEREAFTER ARISING, AND WHETHER SOUNDING
IN CONTRACT, TORT OR OTHERWISE. THE PARTIES AGREE THAT ANY OF THEM MAY FILE A
COPY OF THIS PARAGRAPH WITH ANY COURT AS WRITTEN EVIDENCE OF THE KNOWING,
VOLUNTARY AND BARGAINED FOR AGREEMENT AMONG THE PARTIES IRREVOCABLY TO WAIVE
TRIAL BY JURY AND THAT ANY ACTION WHATSOEVER BETWEEN OR AMONG THEM RELATING TO
THIS AGREEMENT OR ANY TRANSACTION CONTEMPLATED HEREBY SHALL INSTEAD BE TRIED
IN A COURT OF COMPETENT JURISDICTION BY A JUDGE SITTING WITHOUT A JURY.

_Counterparts_. This Agreement may be executed in any number of counterparts
(including by means of facsimile or email in .pdf format), each of which will
be deemed to be an original copy of this Agreement and all of which, when
taken together, will be deemed to constitute one and the same agreement.

_Severability_. If any term or other provision of this Agreement is invalid,
illegal, or incapable of being enforced by any Law or public policy, all
other terms or provisions of this Agreement shall nevertheless remain in full
force and effect so long as the economic or legal substance of the
transactions contemplated hereby is not affected in any manner materially
adverse to any Party (or to the Company Holders). Upon such determination that
any term or other provision is invalid, illegal or incapable of being
enforced, the Parties shall negotiate in good faith to modify this Agreement
so as to effect the original intent of the Parties as closely as possible in
an acceptable manner in order that the transactions contemplated hereby are
consummated as originally contemplated to the greatest extent possible.

 

 _Further Assurances_. Subject to the terms and conditions of this Agreement,
from time to time, at the request of any Party and without additional
consideration, each other Party shall execute and deliver to such requesting
Party such documents and take such other action as such requesting Party may
reasonably request in order to consummate the transactions contemplated by
this Agreement.

_Remedies_.

 

(a) Except as otherwise provided in this Agreement, any and all remedies
herein expressly conferred upon a Party will be deemed cumulative with and
not exclusive of any other remedy expressly conferred hereby, and the exercise
by a Party of any one such remedy will not preclude the exercise of any other
such remedy.

 

(b) Each of the Parties agrees that irreparable damage would occur in the
event of a breach of this Agreement by any Party (including by any Party
failing to take such actions as are required of it hereunder to consummate the
Merger), money damages may be inadequate and there may be no adequate remedy
at Law. Accordingly, the Parties agree that, subject to and without limiting 
_Section 10.12(c)_ below (if applicable), each of the Parties shall have the
right, in addition to any other rights and remedies existing in its favor at
Law or in equity, to enforce its rights and each Partys respective
obligations hereunder by an Action or Actions for specific performance,
injunctive and/or other equitable relief (without posting of bond or other
security). Each of the Parties agrees that it shall not oppose the granting of
an injunction, specific 

 



79  performance and other equitable relief when expressly available pursuant to
the terms of this Agreement, and hereby waives (i) any defenses in any Action
for an injunction, specific performance or other equitable relief, including
the defense that the other Parties have an adequate remedy at Law or an award
of specific performance is not an appropriate remedy for any reason at Law or
equity, and (ii) any requirement under Law to post a bond, undertaking or
other security as a prerequisite to obtaining equitable relief.

(c) To the extent any Party brings any Action before any Governmental
Authority to enforce specifically the performance of the terms and provisions
of this Agreement prior to the Termination Date, the Termination Date shall
automatically be extended by (i) the amount of time during which such Action
is pending, _plus_ twenty (20) Business Days, or (ii) such other time period
established by the court presiding over such Action.

 

 _Non-Recourse_. Notwithstanding anything that may be expressed or implied in
this Agreement, Parent and Merger Sub agree and acknowledge that no recourse
under this Agreement or any documents or instruments delivered in connection
with this Agreement shall be had against any former, current or future
director, officer, employee, incorporator, Affiliate, member, manager,
partner, equity holder, agent, attorney or representative of any Company
Holder or any Affiliate or permitted assignee of any Company Holder (excluding
any Company Holder who may be deemed to be a Non-Recourse Party of another
Company Holder other than in its role as a Company Holder itself)
(collectively, " _Non-Recourse Parties_ "), as such, whether by the
enforcement of any assessment or by any legal or equitable proceeding, or by
virtue of any statute, regulation or other applicable Law, it being expressly
agreed and acknowledged that no personal liability whatsoever shall attach to,
be imposed on or otherwise be incurred by any Non-Recourse Parties, as such,
for any obligation of any Company Holder under this Agreement or
any documents or instruments delivered in connection with this Agreement for
any claim based on, in respect of or by reason of such obligations or their
creation, or otherwise by reason of this Agreement or its negotiation or
execution or the transactions contemplated hereby, and Parent and Merger Sub
(and at and following the Closing the Surviving Corporation) waives and
releases all such liabilities, claims and obligations against any such Non-
Recourse Parties. Non-Recourse Parties are expressly intended as third party
beneficiaries of this provision of this Agreement.

_Waiver of Conflicts_.

 

(a) It is acknowledged by each of the Parties that each of the Company and
certain Affiliates of TPG and Calera have retained Skadden to act as their
counsel in connection with the transactions contemplated hereby and that
Skadden has not acted as counsel for any other Party in connection with the
transactions contemplated hereby and that none of the other Parties has the
status of a client of Skadden for conflict of interest or any other purposes
as a result thereof. Each Party hereby agrees that, in the event that any
dispute arises after the Closing between Parent, the Surviving Corporation or
any of their respective Subsidiaries or Affiliates, on the one hand, and any
of TPG or Calera or their respective Affiliates, on the other hand, Skadden
may represent either or both of TPG and Calera in such dispute even though the
interests of TPG and Calera may be directly adverse to Parent, the Surviving
Corporation or any of their respective Subsidiaries or Affiliates, and even
though Skadden formerly may have represented the Company or any of the
Companys Subsidiaries in any matter substantially 

 



80  related to such dispute. Each of the Company (on behalf of itself and the
Surviving Corporation), Parent and Merger Sub acknowledges and agrees that, in
connection with any future dispute between Parent, the Surviving Corporation
or any of their respective Subsidiaries or Affiliates, on the one hand, and
any of TPG or Calera or their respective Affiliates, on the other hand, with
respect to the negotiation, documentation and consummation of the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement, as to all communications among
Skadden, the Company, any of the Companys Subsidiaries, TPG and Calera that
relate in any way to the negotiation, documentation and consummation of
the transactions contemplated by this Agreement (" _Privileged Deal
Communications_ "), the attorney-client privilege and the expectation of
client confidence belongs to TPG or Calera, as applicable, and may be
controlled by such Person and shall not pass to or be claimed by Parent, the
Surviving Corporation or any of their respective Subsidiaries or Affiliates.

(b) The Parties understand and agree that the Parties have each undertaken
commercially reasonable efforts to prevent the disclosure of confidential or
attorney-client privileged information. Notwithstanding those efforts, the
Parties further understand and agree that the consummation of the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement may result in the inadvertent
disclosure of information that may be confidential or subject to a claim of
privilege. The Parties further understand and agree that any disclosure of
information that may be confidential or subject to a claim of privilege will
not prejudice or otherwise constitute a waiver of any claim of privilege.
Accordingly, following the Closing each of Parent and the Surviving
Corporation agrees to use commercially reasonable efforts to return promptly
any communications among Skadden, the Company, any of the Companys
Subsidiaries, TPG and Calera that relate in any way to the negotiation,
documentation and consummation of the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement inadvertently disclosed to the appropriate Person upon becoming
aware of its existence. Notwithstanding the foregoing, in the event that a
dispute arises between Parent, the Surviving Corporation or any of their
respective Affiliates, on the one hand, and a third party (other than a Party,
TPG or Calera or their respective Affiliates), on the other hand, after the
Closing, the Surviving Corporation may assert the attorney-client privilege to
prevent disclosure of confidential communications by Skadden to such third
party.

(c) The Parties agree that the protections afforded to TPG and Calera above
shall not be considered, and is not, a waiver by Parent, the Surviving
Corporation or any of their respective Subsidiaries or Affiliates of any
attorney client privilege that they may have over the Privileged Deal
Communications solely as against any third party (other than a Party, TPG or
Calera or their respective Affiliates). Notwithstanding the foregoing, in the
event that a dispute arises between Parent, the Surviving Corporation or any
of their respective Affiliates, on the one hand, and a third party (other
than a Party, TPG or Calera or their respective Affiliates), on the other
hand, after the Closing, the Surviving Corporation (i) may assert the
attorney-client privilege to prevent disclosure of
confidential communications by Skadden to such third party and (ii) shall not
waive any attorney-client privilege under the Privileged Deal Communications
as against any third party without the prior written consent of TPG and
Calera. In the event that Parent, the Surviving Corporation or any of its
Subsidiaries is required under applicable Law, or by order of or request by
any Governmental Authority (any such requirement, order or request, a " _Legal
Request_ ") to produce, or otherwise access or obtain a copy of all or a
portion of such confidential communications by Skadden, Parent, the Surviving
Corporation and its Subsidiaries, subject to compliance with the following
sentence, shall be entitled to access or obtain a copy of

 



81  and disclose such communications to the extent necessary to comply with any
such Legal Request. In the event of any Legal Request, Parent shall promptly
following such Legal Request, notify the Company Holders Representative in
writing so that the Company Holders Representative can seek a protective
order and Parent agrees to use all commercially reasonable efforts (at the
sole cost and expense of the Company Holders Representative) to assist
therewith.

(d) Skadden shall be a third party beneficiary for purposes of this _Section
10.14_.

in any manner for any act or omission of the Company Holders Representative
in such capacity. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary herein, except for

Holders Representative hereunder.

(e) The grant of authority provided for in this  _Section 10.16_ (i) is

the death, incompetency, bankruptcy or liquidation of any Company Holder and
shall be binding on any successor thereto, and (ii) shall survive the payment
of all or any portion of the Merger Consideration hereunder and the Escrow
Amount.

 

(f) At the Closing, pursuant to _Section 3.06(a)(ix)(5)_, the Parent shall
wire one million dollars ($1,000,000) (the " _Expense Fund Amount_ ") to the
Company Holders Representative, which amount will be used for the purposes of
paying directly, or reimbursing the Company Holders Representative for, any
reasonable and documented out-of-pocked third party expenses incurred by the
Company Holders Representative in connection with the exercise of its duties
and obligations pursuant to this Agreement or any Related Agreement. The
Company Holders will not receive any interest or earnings on the Expense Fund
Amount and hereby irrevocably transfer and assign to the Company Holders
Representative any interest, right or title that they may otherwise have had
in any respect of any such interest or earnings. The Company Holders
Representative will not be liable for any loss of principal of the Expense
Fund other than as a result of its bad faith, gross negligence or willful
misconduct. The Company Holders Representative will hold these funds
separate from its corporate funds, will not use these funds for its operating
expenses or any other corporate purposes and will not make these funds
available to its creditors in the event of bankruptcy other than as required
by a non-appealable Order from a Governmental Authority. Contemporaneous with
or as soon as practicable following the completion of the Company
Holders Representatives duties, the Company Holders Representative will
deliver the balance of the Expense Fund to the Paying Agent for the benefit
of, and for further distribution to, the Company Holders on a pro rata basis
based on their respective Specified Percentages pursuant to written
instructions of the Company Holders Representative; _provided_ that a portion
of any such amount that is subject to employment tax withholding shall be paid
to the Surviving Corporation for payment through the Surviving Corporations
payroll system no later than the first regularly scheduled payroll date that
is at least four (4) Business Days following the Surviving Corporations
receipt of such funds.

 



86 (g) The Company Holders Representative will incur no liability of any kind
with respect to any action or omission by the Company Holders Representative
in connection with the Company Holders Representatives services pursuant to
this Agreement or any Related Agreement, except in the event of liability
resulting from the Company Holders Representatives bad faith, gross
negligence or willful misconduct. The Company Holders Representative shall
not be liable for any action or omission taken based on the written advice of
outside counsel. The Company Holders will indemnify, defend and hold harmless
the Company Holders Representative from and against any and all losses,
liabilities, damages, claims, penalties, fines, forfeitures, actions, fees,
costs and reasonable and documented out-of-pocket expenses (including the
fees and expenses of outside counsel and experts) (collectively, "
_Representative Losses_ ") incurred by the Company Holders Representative
arising out of, in connection with or resulting from the Company Holders
Representatives performance of its duties and obligations pursuant this
Agreement or any Related Agreement in each case as such Representative Loss is
suffered or incurred; _provided_ that, in the event that any such
Representative Loss is finally adjudicated to have been caused by the bad
faith, gross negligence or willful misconduct of the Company Holders
Representative, the Company Holders Representative will promptly reimburse
the Company Holders the amount of such indemnified Representative Loss to the
extent attributable to such bad faith, gross negligence or willful misconduct.
If not paid directly to the Company Holders Representative by the Company
Holders and subject to the proviso set forth in the prior sentence, any such
Representative Losses may be recovered by the Company Holders Representative
from (i) the Expense Fund Amount, and (ii) the funds in the Adjustment Escrow
Account and the Indemnity Escrow Account at such time as the remaining
amounts in the Adjustment Escrow Account or the Indemnity Escrow Account would
otherwise be distributable to the Company Holders pursuant to the terms of
this Agreement or the Escrow Agreement; _provided_ that, while this section
permits the Company Holders Representative to be paid from the Expense Fund,
the Adjustment Escrow Account and the Indemnity Escrow Account, this does not
relieve the Company Holders from their obligation to promptly pay, in
accordance with their Specified Percentages, such Representative Losses as
they are suffered or incurred, nor does it prevent the Company Holders
Representative from seeking any remedies available to it at Law or otherwise.
In no event will the Company Holders Representative be required to advance
its own funds on behalf of the Company Holders or otherwise. The Company
Holders acknowledge and agree that the foregoing indemnities will survive
the resignation or removal of the Company Holders Representative.
Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the contrary, any restrictions
or limitations on indemnity contained elsewhere in this Agreement are not
intended to be applicable to the indemnities provided to the Company Holders
Representative under this _Section 10.16_ and the terms of the SRS Letter
Agreement.
