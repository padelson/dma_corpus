from and after the Effective Time, be the initial directors of the Surviving
Corporation, each to hold office in accordance with the certificate of

earlier death, resignation or removal in accordance with the certificate of
incorporation and bylaws of the Surviving Corporation. The officers of Merger
Sub immediately prior to the Effective Time, from and after the Effective

hereinafter referred to as the " _Effective Time_."

ARTICLE 2

 

CONVERSION OF SECURITIES IN THE MERGER

 

2.1 _Conversion o_ _f Securities_. At the Effective Time, by virtue of the
Merger and without any action on the part of Parent, Merger Sub, the Company
or the holders of any of the following securities:

(a) _Conversion of Company Common Stock_. Subject to any applicable
withholding Tax in accordance with _Section 2.2(f)_ and _Section 2.1(d)_ ,
each Share issued and outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time
(other than Shares to be cancelled in accordance with  _Section_ _ _ _2.1(b)_
and other than Dissenting Shares) will be converted into the right to receive
the Merger Consideration, payable net to the holder in cash, without interest,
upon surrender of the Certificate formerly representing such Shares in
accordance with _Section_ _ _ _2.2_. At the Effective Time, all of the Shares
shall cease to be outstanding, shall be cancelled and shall cease to exist,
and each Certificate that immediately prior to the Effective Time represented
any of the Shares (other than Shares to be cancelled in accordance with
_Section_ _ _ _2.1(b)_ and other than Dissenting Shares) shall thereafter
represent only the right to receive the Merger Consideration, without
interest and subject to any applicable withholding Tax in accordance with
_Section 2.2(f)_.

(b)  _Cancellation of Treasury Stock and Parent-Owned Stock_. All Shares that
are held in the treasury of the Company, and all Shares owned of record by
Parent, Merger Sub or any of their respective wholly-owned Subsidiaries, will
be cancelled and will cease to exist, with no payment being made with respect
thereto.

(c) _Merger Sub Common Stock_. Each share of common stock, par value $0.001
per share, of Merger Sub (the " _Merger Sub Common Stock_ ") issued and
outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time will be converted into and
become one newly and validly issued, fully paid and nonassessable share of
common stock, par value $0.001 per share, of the Surviving Corporation, and
such shares shall constitute the only outstanding shares of capital stock of
the Surviving Corporation. From and after the Effective Time, all
certificates representing Merger Sub Common Stock shall be deemed for all
purposes to represent the number of shares of common stock of the Surviving
Corporation into which they were converted in accordance with the preceding
sentence.

 

(d) _Changes in Stock_. If at any time during the period between the date of
this Agreement and the Effective Time, any change in the outstanding shares
of capital stock of the Company,

 



-3-  or securities convertible into or exchangeable into or exercisable for
shares of such capital stock, shall occur as a result of any reclassification,
recapitalization, stock split (including a reverse stock split) or
subdivision or combination, exchange or readjustment of shares, or any stock
dividend or stock distribution with a record date during such period, merger
or other similar transaction, the Merger Consideration shall be equitably
adjusted so as to provide Parent and the holders of Shares the same economic
effect as contemplated by this Agreement prior to such event; _provided_ ,
that nothing in this _Section 2.1(d)_ shall be construed to permit the
Company to take any action with respect to its securities that is prohibited
by the terms of this Agreement.

2.2 _Payment for Securities; Surrender of Certificates_.

(a) _Paying Agent_. At or prior to the Effective Time, Parent will designate a
reputable bank or trust company, reasonably acceptable to the Company, to act
as the paying agent for purposes of effecting the payment of the Merger
Consideration in connection with the Merger (the " _Paying Agent_ "). At or
immediately after the Effective Time, Parent or Merger Sub will deposit, or
cause to be deposited, with the Paying Agent the aggregate Merger
Consideration to which holders of Shares will be entitled at the Effective
Time pursuant to this Agreement, together with the aggregate Option Payments
and RSU Payments (except to the extent that any such Option Payments or RSU
Payments are to be made through the payroll of the Surviving Corporation)
(collectively, the " _Payment Fund_ "). Such funds will be invested by the
Paying Agent as directed by Parent, in its sole discretion, pending payment
thereof by the Paying Agent to the holders of the Shares. Earnings from such
investments will be the sole and exclusive property of Parent, and no part
of such earnings will accrue to the benefit of holders of Shares.

(b) _Procedures for Surrender_. As promptly as practicable after the
Effective Time (and in any event, within five (5) Business Days thereafter),
Parent will cause the Paying Agent to mail to each holder of record of a
certificate or certificates that represented Shares (the " _Certificates_ ")
or non-certificated Shares represented by book-entry (" _Book_ __ _-Entry_
_Shares_ "), in each case, which Shares were converted into the right to
receive the Merger Consideration at the Effective Time pursuant to this
Agreement: (i) a letter of transmittal, which will specify that delivery will
be effected, and risk of loss and title to the Certificates (if any) will
pass, only upon delivery of such Certificates to the Paying Agent, and will
otherwise be in such form and have such other provisions as Parent or the
Paying Agent may reasonably specify and (ii) instructions for effecting the
surrender of the Certificates or Book-Entry Shares in exchange for payment of
the Merger Consideration. Upon surrender of Certificates and Book-Entry
Shares for cancellation to the Paying Agent or to such other agent or agents
as may be appointed by Parent, and upon delivery of a letter of transmittal,
duly executed and in proper form, with respect to such Certificates or Book-
Entry Shares, and such other documents as the Paying Agent may reasonably
require, the holder of such Certificates or Book-Entry Shares will be entitled
to receive the Merger Consideration for each Share formerly represented by
such Certificates and for each Book-Entry Share. Any Certificates and Book-
Entry Shares so surrendered will forthwith be cancelled. All cash paid upon
the surrender for exchange of Certificates and Book-Entry Shares will be
deemed to have been paid in full satisfaction of all rights pertaining to
Shares formerly represented by such Certificates or Book-Entry Shares. If
payment of the Merger Consideration is to be made to a Person other than the
Person in whose name any surrendered Certificate is registered, it will be a
condition precedent of payment that the Certificate so surrendered will be
properly endorsed or will be otherwise in proper form for transfer, and the
Person requesting such payment will have paid any transfer or similar Taxes
required by reason of the payment of the Merger Consideration to a Person
other than the registered holder of the Certificate so surrendered or will
have established to the satisfaction of the Paying Agent that such Taxes
either have been paid or are not payable. Any other transfer or similar Taxes
incurred in connection with the Transactions contemplated by this Agreement
will be paid by Parent. Payment of the Merger Consideration with respect to
Book-Entry Shares will only be made to the Person in whose name such

 



-4-  Book-Entry Shares are registered. Until surrendered as contemplated hereby,
each Certificate or Book-Entry Share will be deemed at any time after the
Effective Time to represent only the right to receive the Merger
Consideration in cash as contemplated by this Agreement, without interest.

(c) _Transfer Books; No Further Ownership Rights in Shares_. At the Effective
Time, the stock transfer books of the Company will be closed and thereafter
there will be no further registration of transfers of Shares on the records of
the Company. From and after the Effective Time, the holders of Certificates
and Book-Entry Shares outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time will
cease to have any rights with respect to such Shares except as otherwise
provided for herein or by applicable Law. If, after the Effective Time,
Certificates are presented to the Surviving Corporation for any reason, then
(subject to compliance with the exchange procedures of _Section_ _ _ _2.2(b)_
) they will be cancelled and exchanged as provided in this Agreement.

(d) _Termination of Fund; Abandoned Property; No Liability_. At any time
following the first anniversary of the Effective Time, the Surviving
Corporation will be entitled to require the Paying Agent to deliver to it any
portion of the Payment Fund (including any interest accrued with respect
thereto) not disbursed to holders of Certificates or Book-Entry Shares,
Company Options or Company RSUs, and thereafter such holders will be entitled
to look only to the Surviving Corporation (subject to abandoned property,
escheat or other similar Laws) only as general creditors thereof with respect
to the Merger Consideration payable upon due surrender of their Certificates
or Book-Entry Shares, Company Options or Company RSUs and compliance with the
procedures in _Section_ _ _ _2.2(b)_ , without interest. If, immediately
prior to such time on which any payment in respect hereof would escheat to or
become the property of any Governmental Entity pursuant to any applicable
abandoned property, escheat or similar Laws, any holder of Certificates or
Book-Entry Shares has not complied with the procedures in _Section_ _ _
_2.2(b)_ to receive payment of the Merger Consideration to which such holder
would otherwise be entitled, the payment in respect of such Certificates or
Book-Entry Shares, Company Options or Company RSUs will, to the extent
permitted by applicable Law, become the property of the Surviving Corporation,
free and clear of all claims or interest of any Person previously entitled
thereto. Notwithstanding the foregoing, neither the Surviving Corporation nor
the Paying Agent will be liable to any holder of a Certificate or Book-Entry
Shares for Merger Consideration delivered to a public official pursuant to any
applicable abandoned property, escheat or similar Law. 

(e) _Lost, Stolen or Destroyed Certificates_. In the event that any
Certificates have been lost, stolen or destroyed, the Paying Agent will issue
in exchange for such lost, stolen or destroyed Certificates, upon the making
of an affidavit of that fact by the holder thereof, in form and substance
reasonably acceptable to Parent, the Merger Consideration payable in respect
thereof pursuant to _Section_ _ _ _2.1(a)_ hereof; _provided_ , _however_ ,
that Parent or the Paying Agent may, in its discretion and as a condition
precedent to the payment of such Merger Consideration, require the owners of
such lost, stolen or destroyed Certificates to deliver a customary indemnity
against any claim that may be made against Parent, Merger Sub, the Surviving
Corporation or the Paying Agent with respect to the Certificates alleged to
have been lost, stolen or destroyed.

(f) _Withholding Rights_. Each of Parent, the Surviving Corporation and the
Paying Agent, as applicable, shall be entitled to deduct and withhold from
the consideration otherwise payable pursuant to this Agreement to any holder
of Shares and from any Option Payments or RSU Payments such amounts as Parent,
the Surviving Corporation or the Paying Agent, as applicable, is required to
deduct and withhold with respect to the making of such payment under the Code
or any other applicable state, local or foreign Tax Law. To the extent that
amounts are so withheld, such withheld amounts (i) shall be remitted to the
applicable Governmental Entity and (ii) shall be treated for all purposes of
this Agreement as having been paid to the holder of Shares or other Person in
respect of which such deduction and withholding was made.

 



-5- 2.3 _Dissenting Shares_. Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the
contrary, Shares outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time and held
by a holder who is entitled to demand and has properly demanded appraisal for
such Shares in accordance with, and who complies in all respects with, Section
262 of the DGCL (such Shares, the " _Dissenting Shares_ ") will not be
converted into the right to receive the Merger Consideration, and will instead
represent the right to receive only the payment provided by Section 262 of the
DGCL. If any such holder fails to perfect or otherwise waives, withdraws or
loses his, her or its right to appraisal under Section 262 of the DGCL, then
the right of such holder to receive such payment in respect of such Dissenting
Shares will cease and such Dissenting Shares will be deemed to have been
converted, as of the Effective Time, into and will be exchangeable solely for
the right to receive the Merger Consideration, without interest. The Company
will give Parent prompt notice of any demands received by the Company for
appraisal of Shares, attempted withdrawals of such demands and any other
instruments served pursuant to the DGCL and received by the Company relating
to rights to be paid the fair value of Dissenting Shares, and Parent will
have the right to participate in and direct all negotiations and Proceedings
with respect to such demands. The Company will not, except with the prior
written consent of Parent, make any payment with respect to, or settle or
compromise or offer to settle or compromise, any such demands, or approve any
withdrawal of any such demands, or agree to do any of the foregoing. Any
portion of the Merger Consideration made available to the Paying Agent
pursuant to _Section 2.2(a)_ to pay for Shares for which appraisal rights
have been perfected as described in this _Section 2.3_ shall be returned to
Parent, upon demand; _provided_ , that the parties acknowledge that,
notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement, Parent shall not
be required under this _Section 2.3_ or otherwise to deposit with the Paying
Agent any cash to pay any Merger Consideration with respect to Shares as to
which its holder has purported to deliver a notice or demand of
appraisal that has not been withdrawn prior to the Closing Date. Parent shall
pay additional cash to the Paying Agent to the extent required to pay the
Merger Consideration in respect of the foregoing Shares if and when such
Shares cease to be Dissenting Shares.

2.4 _Treatment of Company Options, Company RSUs and Company RSAs; Stock_
_Plans_.

 

(a) _Treatment of Company Options_. Prior to the Effective Time, the Company
Board (or, if appropriate, any committee thereof) will adopt resolutions and
take all other actions necessary and appropriate to provide that: (i)
immediately prior to the Effective Time, each unexpired and unexercised option
to purchase Shares (the " _Company Options_ "), under any employee,
consultant or director stock option, stock purchase or equity compensation
plan, arrangement or agreement of the Company, including the CompanyÂ’s Amended
and Restated 2005 Stock Incentive Plan and the CompanyÂ’s 2014
Equity Incentive Award Plan, (the " _Company Stock Option Plans_ "), whether
or not then exercisable or vested, will vest (in the case of a Company Option
that is subject to a performance-based vesting condition, vesting will be
determined in accordance with the terms and conditions applicable to the
award) and be cancelled and, in exchange therefor, each former holder of any
such cancelled Company Option will only be entitled to receive, in
consideration of the cancellation of such Company Option and in full
settlement therefor, a payment in cash of an amount equal to the product of
(A) the total number of Shares previously subject to such Company Option and
(B) the excess, if any, of the Merger Consideration over the exercise price
per Share previously subject to such Company Option (such amounts payable
hereunder being referred to as the " _Option Payments_ "); (ii) from and after
the Effective Time, any such cancelled Company Option will no longer be
exercisable by the former holder thereof, but will only entitle such holder to
the payment of the Option Payment; and (iii) if the exercise price per Share
of any such Company Option is equal to or greater than the Merger
Consideration or, in the case of a Company Option that is subject to a
performance-based vesting condition, to the extent the applicable performance-
based vesting condition has not been satisfied as of immediately prior to the
Effective Time and such portion of the Company Option is not required
(pursuant to the terms and conditions applicable to the award) to become
vested in connection with the transactions contemplated by this Agreement,
such Company Option shall be cancelled immediately prior to the Effective
Time without any payment being made in respect thereof.

 



-6- (b) _Treatment of Company RSUs_. Prior to the Effective Time, the Company
Board (or, if appropriate, any committee thereof) will adopt resolutions and
take all other actions necessary and appropriate to provide that: (i)
immediately prior to the Effective Time, each outstanding award of restricted
stock units granted pursuant to any Company Stock Option Plan (the " _Company
RSUs_ "), will vest (in the case of a Company RSU that is subject to a
performance-based vesting condition, vesting will be determined in accordance
with the terms and conditions applicable to the award) and become free of any
restrictions and will be cancelled in exchange for the right to receive a
payment equal to the Merger Consideration (such amounts payable hereunder
being referred to as the " _RSU Payments_ "); (ii) from and after the
Effective Time, any such cancelled Company RSUs will only entitle the former
holder thereof to the payment of the RSU Payment; and (iii) in the case of any
Company RSU that is subject to a performance-based vesting condition, to the
extent the applicable performance-based vesting condition has not been
satisfied as of immediately prior to the Effective Time and such portion of
the Company RSU is not required (pursuant to the terms and conditions
applicable to the award) to become vested in connection with the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement, such Company RSU shall be cancelled
immediately prior to the Effective Time without any payment being made in
respect thereof. To the extent any such cancelled Company RSU is subject to a
deferred payment schedule pursuant to the applicable distribution provisions
of Section 409A of the Code so that the RSU Payments cannot be paid to the
holder within such period without the holderÂ’s incurrence of a penalty Tax
and interest penalties under Section 409A of the Code, then any RSU Payments
otherwise payable to the holder of such cancelled Company RSU will be
distributed in accordance with Section 409A of the Code and the
applicable Treasury Regulations thereunder.

(c) _Treatment of Company RSAs_. Prior to the Effective Time, the Company
Board (or, if appropriate, any committee thereof) will adopt resolutions and
take all other actions necessary and appropriate to provide that, immediately
prior to the Effective Time, each outstanding award of Company Common Stock
granted pursuant to any Company Stock Option Plan that is subject to
restrictions based on performance or continuing service (the " _Company RSAs_
"), will vest (treating for this purpose any performance-based vesting
condition to which such Company RSA is subject as having been attained at
"maximum" level), become free of any restrictions and be converted into the
right to receive the Merger Consideration in accordance with _Section 2.1(a)_.

 

(d) _Payments through Payroll_. Any Option Payment or RSU Payment to which an
employee or former employee of the Company becomes entitled pursuant _Section
2.4(a)_ or _Section 2.4(b)_ , as well as payments made to holders of Company
RSAs that accelerate pursuant to _Section 2.4(c)_ (to the extent any
withholding is required in accordance with _Section 2.2(f)_ ), shall be made
through the Surviving CorporationÂ’s payroll no more than two (2) Business Days
following the Effective Time.

 

(e) _Termination of Company Stock Option Plans_. At the Effective Time, all
Company Stock Option Plans will be terminated, and no further Company
Options, Company RSUs or other rights with respect to Shares will be granted
thereunder.

(f) _Treatment of Company ESPP_. As soon as practicable following the date of
this Agreement, the Company shall take such action as may be necessary to: (i)
cause any offering period (or similar period during which shares may be
purchased) underway as of the date hereof under the Company ESPP to be the
final offering period under the Company ESPP, such that no new offering period
will commence under the Company ESPP after the date hereof and the current
offering period underway shall be terminated no later than the Business Day
immediately preceding the anticipated Closing Date (the " _Final Exercise
Date_ "); (ii) make any pro-rata adjustments that may be necessary to

 



-7-  reflect the shortened offering period (or similar period), but otherwise
treat such shortened offering period (or similar period) as a fully effective
and completed offering period for all purposes under the Company ESPP; (iii)
cause each participantÂ’s shares purchase right under the Company ESPP (the "
_Company ESPP Rights_ ") to be exercised as of the Final Exercise Date; (iv)
ensure no new participants enroll in the Company ESPP after the date hereof
and that no current participant in the Company ESPP can increase his or her
payroll deductions from those in effect on the date hereof; and (v) terminate
the Company ESPP as of the Effective Time. On the Final Exercise Date, the
funds credited as of such date under the Company ESPP within the associated
accumulated payroll withholding account for each participant under the Company
ESPP shall be used to purchase Shares in accordance with the terms of
the Company ESPP, and each share purchased thereunder immediately prior to
the Effective Time shall be cancelled at the Effective Time and converted into
the right to receive the Merger Consideration in accordance with _Section 2.1_
, subject to withholding of applicable income and employment withholding
Taxes. Any accumulated contributions of each participant under the Company
ESPP as of immediately prior to the Effective Time shall, to the extent not
used to purchase Shares in accordance with the terms and conditions of the
Company ESPP (as amended pursuant to this _Section 2.4(f)_ ), be refunded to
such participant as promptly as practicable following the Effective Time
(without interest). No further Company ESPP Rights shall be granted or
exercised under the Company ESPP after the Final Exercise Date. The Company
shall provide timely notice to participants of the setting of the Final
Exercise Date and termination of the Company ESPP in accordance with the
Company ESPP.

(g) _Corporate Actions_. At or prior to the Effective Time, the Company, the
Company Board and the compensation committee of the Company Board, as
applicable, shall adopt any resolutions and take any actions which are
necessary to effectuate the provisions of this _Section_ _ _ _2.4_. The
Company shall take all actions necessary to ensure that from and after the
Effective Time neither Parent nor the Surviving Corporation will be required
to deliver to any Person any Shares or other Equity Interests of the Company,
the Surviving Corporation or any other Person pursuant to or in settlement of
Company Options, Company RSUs, Company RSAs or other rights with respect to
Shares.

Company will cause the other Company Representatives to:

i. (A) immediately cease and cause to be terminated any solicitation,

Representatives by or on behalf of the Company; and

ii. not, directly or indirectly: (A) solicit, initiate, seek or knowingly

inquiry, expression of interest, proposal, offer or request for information
that would reasonably be expected to result in an Acquisition Proposal, (D)
enter into any agreement, letter of intent, memorandum of understanding,

in accordance with the terms of this Agreement) (each, an " _Alternative
Acquisition Agreement_ "), (E) submit any Acquisition Proposal or any matter
related thereto to the vote of the stockholders of the Company or (F)
resolve or agree to do any of the foregoing; _provided_ , that
notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this _Section 5.3_ , if the
Company receives any inquiry, expression of interest, proposal or offer that
constitutes or would reasonably be expected to lead to an Acquisition
Proposal from any Third Party, the Company may inform such Third Party that
the Company is contractually prohibited from engaging in discussions with, or
otherwise responding to, such Third Party in response thereto. Any violation
of the restrictions set forth in this _Section 5.3_ by any Company
Representative shall constitute a breach of this _Section 5.3_ by the Company.

 

(b) The Company shall promptly (and in any event within twenty-four (24)
hours) advise Parent orally and in writing in the event that the Company
receives any Acquisition Proposal or any inquiry, expression of interest,
proposal, offer or request for information that would

 



-32-  reasonably be expected to result in an Acquisition Proposal, and in
connection with such notice, provide to Parent the material terms and
conditions (including the identity of the Third Party making any such
Acquisition Proposal and copies of any proposed Alternative Acquisition
Agreements, including copies of any related financing commitments) received by
the Company with respect to any such Acquisition Proposal. The Company
shall (i) promptly (and in any event within twenty-four (24) hours) notify
Parent of any change to the price of or other material change to the terms of
any such Acquisition Proposal (including any determination by the Company
Board pursuant to _Section 5.3(c)_ ) and (ii) provide to Parent as soon as
practicable (and in any event within twenty-four (24) hours) after receipt
from any Third Party of any written indication of interest (or amendment
thereto) and copies of any proposed Alternative Acquisition Agreement
(including any drafts thereof) and any proposed financing commitments related
thereto (including drafts thereof).

 

(c) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in _Section_ _ _
_5.3(a)_ , if at any time on or after the date of this Agreement, but prior
to the time (but not after) the Company Stockholder Approval is obtained, (i)
the Company has received a bona fide written Acquisition Proposal from a Third
Party, (ii) such Acquisition Proposal did not result from a breach (other
than a _de minimus_ breach) of any of the provisions of this _Section 5.3_ ,
(iii) the Company Board determines in good faith, after consultation with its
financial advisors and outside counsel, that such Acquisition Proposal
constitutes or is reasonably likely to lead to a Superior Proposal and (iv)
after consultation with its outside counsel, the Company Board determines in
good faith that the failure to take such actions would reasonably be expected
to be inconsistent with its fiduciary duties to the stockholders of the
Company under applicable Law, then the Company may take the following actions:
(A) furnish information with respect to the Company to the Person making such
Acquisition Proposal and/or (B) participate in discussions or negotiations
with the Person making such Acquisition Proposal regarding such Acquisition
Proposal; _provided_ , that (i) prior to furnishing any such information or
engaging in such negotiations or discussions, the Company receives from such
Third Party an executed Acceptable Confidentiality Agreement, (ii) the Company
will provide to Parent any information concerning the Company provided to such
other Person which was not previously provided to Parent or the Parent
Representatives substantially currently with such information being provided
to such other Person, and (iii) the Company shall give Parent written notice
of such determination promptly after the Company Board makes such
determination and in any event prior to furnishing any such information or
engaging in such negotiations or discussions.

 

(d) Subject to _Section_ _ _ _5.3(e)_ and _Section 5.3(f)_ , from the date
hereof until the earlier of the Effective Time and the termination of this
Agreement in accordance with its terms, neither the Company Board nor any
committee thereof will (i) withhold, withdraw or qualify (or modify in a
manner adverse to Parent) (or publicly propose to withhold, withdraw, qualify
or so modify) the approval, recommendation or declaration of advisability by
the Company Board or any such committee of this Agreement, the Merger or any
of the other transactions contemplated hereby, (ii) approve, recommend, or
otherwise declare advisable (or publicly propose to approve, recommend or
otherwise declare advisable) any Acquisition Proposal, (iii) submit any
Acquisition Proposal or any matter related thereto to the vote of the
stockholders of the Company or (iv) authorize, commit, resolve or agree to
take any such actions (each such action set forth in clauses (i) through (iv)
being referred to as a " _Change of Board Recommendation_ ").

 

(e) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this _Article 5_ ,
if (i) the Company has received a bona fide written Acquisition Proposal from
a Third Party that is binding and has been irrevocably committed to by such
Third Party in writing and that did not result from a breach (other than a _de
minimus_ breach) of the provisions of this _Section 5.3_  and that the
Company Board determines in good faith, after consultation with outside
counsel and its financial advisors, constitutes a Superior Proposal, after
giving effect to all of the adjustments to the terms and conditions of this
Agreement that have been delivered to the Company by Parent in writing during
the Notice Period

 



-33-  provided pursuant to this _Section 5.3(e)_ , that are binding and have been
irrevocably committed to by Parent in writing and (ii) the Company Board
determines in good faith, after consultation with its financial advisors and
its outside counsel, that a failure to cause the Company to enter into an
Alternative Acquisition Agreement with respect to such Superior Proposal would
reasonably be expected to be inconsistent with its fiduciary duties to the
stockholders of the Company under applicable Law, then, prior to the time (but
not after) the Company Stockholder Approval is obtained, the Company Board may
terminate this Agreement pursuant to _Section 7.1(d)_ to enter into an
Alternative Acquisition Agreement with respect to such Superior Proposal;
_provided_ , _however_ , that the Company may not terminate this Agreement
pursuant to _Section 7.1(d)_ , and any purported termination pursuant to 
_Section 7.1(d)_ will be void and of no force or effect, unless the Company
pays the Breakup Fee in accordance with _Section_ _ _ _7.2(b)_ ; and
_provided_ , _further_ , that the Company Board may not terminate
this Agreement pursuant to _Section 7.1(d)_ unless:

i. the Company has provided prior written notice to Parent, at least four
Business Days in advance (the " _Notice Period_ "), of the CompanyÂ’s intention
to take such action with respect to such Superior Proposal (it being
understood that the delivery of such notice and any amendment or
update thereto and the determination to so deliver such notice, update or
amendment will not, by itself, constitute a Change of Board Recommendation or
otherwise give rise to a Triggering Event), which notice will specify the
material terms and conditions of such Superior Proposal (including the
identity of the party making such Superior Proposal), and the Company has
contemporaneously provided a copy of the relevant proposed transaction
agreements with the party making such Superior Proposal, including any
definitive agreement with respect to such Superior Proposal and any related
financing commitments;

ii. prior to terminating this Agreement to enter into an Alternative
Acquisition Agreement with respect to such Superior Proposal, the Company
will, and will cause the Company Representatives to, during the Notice Period,
negotiate with Parent in good faith (to the extent Parent desires to
negotiate) to make such adjustments in the terms and conditions of this
Agreement so that such Acquisition Proposal ceases to constitute a Superior
Proposal; and

 

iii. the Company Board shall have considered any adjustments to this Agreement
(including a change to the price terms hereof) and any other agreements that
may be proposed in writing by Parent (the " _Proposed Changed Terms_ ") and
shall have determined in good faith (after consultation with its financial
advisors and its outside counsel) that the Superior Proposal would continue
to constitute a Superior Proposal if such Proposed Changed Terms were to be
given effect. In the event of any revisions to the price of or other material
revisions to the terms of a Superior Proposal, the Company will be required
to deliver a new written notice to Parent and to comply with the requirements
of this _Section 5.3(e)_ with respect to such new written notice; _provided_
, that the Notice Period for any subsequent notice will be shortened from
four Business Days to three Business Days.

(f) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained herein, prior to the
time (but not after) the Company Stockholder Approval is obtained, solely in
response to an Intervening Event, the Company Board may make a Change of Board
Recommendation under clause (i) of the definition thereof if the Company Board
has determined in good faith, after consultation with its outside legal
counsel and taking into account the results of any negotiations with Parent as
contemplated by subsection

 



-34-  (ii) below and any offer from Parent contemplated by subsection (iii) below,
that the failure to take such action would reasonably be expected to be
inconsistent with its fiduciary duties to the stockholders of the Company
under applicable Law; _provided_ , _however_ , that the Company Board may not
withdraw, modify or amend the Company Board Recommendation in a manner adverse
to Parent pursuant to the foregoing unless:

 

i. the Company shall have provided prior written notice to Parent, at least
four Business Days in advance (the " _Intervening Event Notice Period_ "), of
the CompanyÂ’s intention to make a Change of Board Recommendation (it being
understood that the delivery of such notice and any amendment or update
thereto and the determination to so deliver such notice, update or amendment
shall not, by itself, constitute a Change of Board Recommendation or otherwise
give rise to a Triggering Event), which notice shall specify the Company
BoardÂ’s reason for proposing to effect such Change of Board Recommendation
(including a description of such Intervening Event in reasonable detail);

ii. prior to effecting such Change of Board Recommendation, the Company
shall, and shall cause the Company Representatives to, during the Intervening
Event Notice Period negotiate with Parent in good faith (to the extent Parent
desires to negotiate) to make such adjustments in the terms and conditions of
this Agreement in such a manner that would obviate the need for the Company
Board to effect such Change of Board Recommendation; and

 

iii. Parent shall not have, within the Intervening Event Notice Period, made a
written, binding and irrevocable (through the expiration of such period)
offer to modify the terms and conditions of this Agreement, which is set forth
in a definitive written amendment to this Agreement delivered to the Company
and executed on behalf of Parent and Merger Sub, that the Company Board has
in good faith determined (after consultation with its outside legal counsel
and its financial advisor) would obviate the need for the Company Board to
effect such Change of Board Recommendation.

 

(g) Nothing contained in this Agreement shall prohibit the Company (i) from
taking and disclosing to the stockholders of the Company a position
contemplated by Rule 14eÂ–2(a) promulgated under the Exchange Act or complying
with the provisions of Rule 14dÂ–9 promulgated under the Exchange Act or (ii)
making any disclosure to the stockholders of the Company that the
Company Board determines to make in good faith (after consultation with its
outside counsel) in order to fulfill its fiduciary duties under, or in order
to otherwise comply with, applicable Law; _provided_ , _however_ , that any
such disclosure shall be deemed a Change of Board Recommendation unless any
such disclosure (A) includes the Company Board Recommendation, without any
modification thereof, (B) does not contain a Change of Board Recommendation
and (C) expressly rejects any applicable Acquisition Proposal; and,
_provided_ , _further_ , that no Change of Board Recommendation may be made
except in accordance with the terms of _Section 5.3_.

 

5.4 _Stockholder_ _Approval; Preparing of Proxy Statement_.

 

(a) The Company shall use its reasonable best efforts file with the SEC a
preliminary Proxy Statement that complies in all material respects with the
provisions of the Exchange Act and the rules and regulations thereunder and
other applicable Law as soon as practicable following the date hereof (and in
any event will use reasonable best efforts to file the preliminary Proxy
Statement no later than fifteen Business Days after the date of this
Agreement), _provided_ that Parent promptly provides such information
regarding Parent and Merger Sub that the Company may reasonably request for
inclusion in the Proxy Statement.

 



-35- (b) The Company shall use its reasonable best efforts to respond promptly to
any comments from the SEC or the staff of the SEC on the Proxy Statement. The
Company shall use its reasonable best efforts to cause the Proxy Statement to
be mailed to its stockholders as promptly as practicable (and in any event
within five (5) Business Days following the later of (i) the resolution of
any comments from the SEC or the staff of the SEC with respect to the
preliminary Proxy Statement and (ii) the expiration of the ten day waiting
period provided in Rule 14a-6(a) promulgated under the Exchange Act (such
later date, the " _Clearance Date_ ")). No filing of, or amendment or
supplement to, or written response to staff comments on, the Proxy Statement
will be made by the Company, without providing Parent and its counsel a
reasonable opportunity to review and comment thereon and giving reasonable
consideration in good faith to such comments (it being understood that Parent
and its counsel shall provide any comments thereon as soon as reasonably
practicable in order to provide the Company and its counsel sufficient
opportunity to review and consider such comments in advance of any such
filing, amendment or supplement). If at any time prior to the Company
Stockholder Meeting (or any adjournment or postponement thereof) any
information relating to the Company or Parent, or any of their respective
Affiliates, directors or officers, is discovered by the Company or Parent
which is required to be set forth in an amendment or supplement to the Proxy
Statement, so that the Proxy Statement would not include any misstatement of
a material fact or omit to state any material fact necessary in order to make
the statements therein, in light of the circumstances under which they were
made, not misleading, the party that discovers such information shall
promptly notify the other parties hereto and the Company shall use its
reasonable best efforts to promptly file an appropriate amendment or
supplement describing such information with the SEC and, to the extent
required by applicable Law, disseminate such amendment or supplement to the
stockholders of the Company. The Company shall notify Parent promptly of the
receipt of any comments from the SEC or the staff of the SEC and of any
request by the SEC or the staff of the SEC for amendments or supplements to
the Proxy Statement or for additional information and shall supply Parent with
copies of all correspondence between the Company or any of its
Representatives, on the one hand, and the SEC or the staff of the SEC, on the
other hand, with respect to the Proxy Statement.

(c) The Company shall use its reasonable best efforts to duly call, establish
a record date for, give notice of, convene and hold a meeting of its
stockholders, for the purpose of voting upon the adoption of this Agreement
(the " _Company Stockholder Meeting_ "), so that the Company Stockholder
Meeting occurs as soon as possible following the Clearance Date, in accordance
with applicable Law and the Company Charter and Company Bylaws. The Company
shall not adjourn, postpone, cancel, recess or reschedule the Company
Stockholder Meeting; _provided_ , that the Company may postpone or adjourn
the Company Stockholder Meeting without the prior written consent of Parent
(but after consultation with Parent) (i) if as of the time for which the
Company Stockholder Meeting is originally scheduled (as set forth in the
Proxy Statement) there are insufficient shares of Voting Common Stock
represented (either in person or by proxy) to constitute a quorum necessary to
conduct the business of the Company Stockholder Meeting or to the extent that
at such time the Company has not received proxies sufficient to allow the
receipt of the Company Stockholder Approval at the Company Stockholder Meeting
or (ii) to allow time for the filing and dissemination of, and a
sufficient period for evaluation by the CompanyÂ’s stockholders of, any
supplemental or amended disclosure document to the extent that the Company
Board has determined in good faith (after consultation with the CompanyÂ’s
outside legal counsel) is necessary or required under applicable Law. Except
to the extent that the Company Board shall have effected a Change of Board
Recommendation as permitted by _Section 5.3(e)_ or _Section 5.3(f)_ , the
Company shall use reasonable best efforts to obtain the Company Stockholder
Approval and shall include in the Proxy Statement the Company Board
Recommendation. Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, unless this
Agreement has been terminated in accordance with its terms, the Company shall
submit this Agreement for adoption by its stockholders at the Company
Stockholder Meeting whether or not a Change of Board Recommendation shall have
occurred.

 

(d) Immediately following the execution of this Agreement, Parent shall
execute and deliver, in accordance with Section 228 of the DGCL and in its
capacity as the sole stockholder of Merger Sub, a written consent adopting
this Agreement.

 



-36- 5.5 _Appropriate Action; Consents; Filings_.

 

(a) Subject to the terms of this Agreement, the Company and Parent will use
their respective reasonable best efforts to (i) take, or cause to be taken,
all appropriate action and do, or cause to be done, all things necessary,
proper or advisable under applicable Law or otherwise to consummate and make
effective the transactions contemplated by this Agreement as promptly as
practicable and (ii) obtain from any Governmental Entities any consents,
licenses, permits, waivers, approvals, authorizations or orders required to be
obtained by Parent or the Company or any of their respective Subsidiaries, or
to avoid any action or proceeding by any Governmental Entity (including,
without limitation, those in connection with the HSR Act), in connection with
the authorization, execution and delivery of this Agreement and the
consummation of the transactions contemplated herein, including the Merger;
_provided_ , __ that the Company and Parent will cooperate with each other in

filing with, any Governmental Entity is required, in connection with the
consummation of the Merger and (y) seeking any such actions, consents,
approvals or waivers or making any such filings. The Company and Parent will

filing under the rules and regulations of any applicable Law in connection

this Agreement (including any consent under any Contract, which by its terms
requires consent in connection with the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement), or (ii) required to be disclosed in the Company Disclosure
Schedule. If requested by Parent, the Company shall request and use
commercially reasonable efforts to obtain customary payoff letters, Lien
terminations and instruments of discharge, relating to any Indebtedness of the
Company to be paid off, terminated or discharged at the Closing.

 

(b) In furtherance and not in limitation of _Section 5.5(a)_ , each party
hereto agrees to make any appropriate filings, if necessary or advisable,
pursuant to the HSR Act or other applicable Competition Laws with respect to
the Merger as promptly as practicable and in any event within ten (10)
Business Days of the date of this Agreement (unless otherwise mutually agreed
between the parties). Each of Parent, Merger Sub and the Company will (i)
cooperate and coordinate with the other in the making of any filings or
submissions that are required to be made under any applicable Laws or
requested to be made by any Governmental Entity in connection with the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement, (ii) supply the other or its
outside counsel with any information that may be required or requested by any
Governmental Entity in connection with such filings or submissions, (iii)
supply any additional information that may be required or requested by the
Federal Trade Commission, the Department of Justice or other Governmental
Entities in which any such filings or submissions are made as promptly as
practicable, (iv) use their reasonable best efforts to cause the expiration
or termination of the applicable waiting periods under any applicable Laws as
soon as reasonably practicable and (v) take, or cause to be taken, all actions
and do, or cause to be done, all things necessary, proper or advisable to
obtain any consents, licenses, permits, waivers, approvals, authorizations or
orders required under or in connection with any applicable Laws or from any
Governmental Entity, and to enable all waiting periods under applicable Laws
to expire, and to avoid or eliminate each and every impediment under
applicable Laws asserted by any Governmental Entity, in each case, to cause
the Merger and the other transactions 

 



-37-  contemplated hereby to occur as promptly as practicable following the date
of this Agreement (and prior to the Outside Date), including but not limited
to (A) promptly complying with any requests for additional information
(including to certify that such party has "substantially complied" with any
request for additional information or documentary material issued by a
Governmental Entity under 15 U.S.C. Section 18(a)(e) in conjunction with the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement as promptly as practicable) by any
Governmental Entity, (B) if necessary to obtain clearance by any Governmental
Entity before the Outside Date, committing to, taking and effecting,
by consent decree, hold separate order or otherwise, the sale, divestiture,
license or other disposition of any business or assets, (in each case
conditioned on the consummation of the Merger) and (C) contesting, defending
and appealing any lawsuit or other legal proceeding, whether judicial or
administrative, threatened or pending preliminary or permanent injunction or
other order, decree or ruling or statute, rule, regulation or executive order
that would adversely affect the ability of any party hereto to consummate the
transactions contemplated hereby and taking any and all other actions to
prevent the entry, enactment or promulgation thereof. Notwithstanding anything
to the contrary in this Agreement, nothing contained in this Agreement shall
require Parent or its Subsidiaries or the Company to take, or agree to take,
any actions specified in this _Section 5.5_ that, individually or in the
aggregate, would reasonably be expected to have a material adverse effect on
Parent and its Subsidiaries, taken as a whole, or a Company Material Adverse
Effect. Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, Parent will not, and
will not permit any of its Subsidiaries to, enter into, significantly expand
or publicly announce an agreement to form a joint venture, strategic alliance
or strategic partnership with a major domestic air carrier or to acquire any
assets, business or company if such agreement, individually or in the
aggregate, would reasonably be expected to cause any of the conditions set
forth in _Section 6.1(b)_ or _Section 6.1(c)_ not to be satisfied or would
reasonably be expected to have the effect of preventing or delaying past the
Outside Date the consummation of the Merger.

(c) Without limiting the generality of anything contained in this _Section
5.5_ , each party hereto will: (i) give the other parties prompt notice of

investigation or Proceeding; and (iii) promptly inform the other parties of
any communication to or from the Federal Trade Commission, the Department of
Justice, the FAA, the DOT, the FCC, the DHS, the TSA or any other
Governmental Entity regarding the Merger. Each party hereto will consult and
cooperate with the other parties and will consider in good faith the views of
the other parties in connection with any filing, analysis, appearance,
presentation, memorandum, brief, argument, opinion or proposal made or
submitted in connection with the Merger or any of the other transactions
contemplated by this Agreement. In addition, except as may be prohibited
by any Governmental Entity or by any Law, in connection with any such
request, inquiry, investigation or Proceeding, each party hereto will permit
authorized Representatives of the other parties to be present at each meeting
or conference relating to such request, inquiry, investigation or Proceeding
and to have access to and be consulted in connection with any document,
opinion or proposal made or submitted to any Governmental Entity in connection
with such request, inquiry, investigation or Proceeding.

5.6 _Certain Notices_. From and after the date of this Agreement until the
Effective Time, each party hereto will promptly notify the other party hereto
of (a) any written notice or other written communication received by such
party from any Person alleging that the consent, approval, permission or

disclosed pursuant to any Section of this Agreement or that relate to the
consummation of the Merger or any of the

 



-38-  other transactions contemplated by this Agreement, (d) the occurrence, or
non-occurrence, of any event that would be likely to cause any condition to
the obligations of any party to effect the Merger or any other transaction
contemplated by this Agreement not to be satisfied or (e) the failure of such
party to comply with or satisfy any covenant, condition or agreement to be
complied with or satisfied by it pursuant to this Agreement which would
reasonably be expected to result in any condition to the obligations of any
party to effect the Merger or any other transaction contemplated by this
Agreement not to be satisfied; ___provided_ , _however_ , that the
delivery of any notice pursuant to this _Section_ _ _ _5.6_ will not (A)
limit or otherwise affect any of the representations, warranties, covenants,
obligations or conditions contained in this Agreement, (B) otherwise prejudice
in any way the rights and remedies contained in this Agreement, (C) be deemed
to affect or modify such partyÂ’s reliance on the representations, warranties,
covenants and agreements made by the other parties in this Agreement or (D) be
deemed to amend or supplement the Company Disclosure Schedule or prevent or
cure any misrepresentation, breach of warranty or breach of covenant by such
party.

 

5.7 _Public Announcements_. Each of the Company, Parent and Merger Sub agrees
that no public release or announcement concerning the transactions
contemplated hereby will be issued by any party without the prior written
consent of the Company and Parent (which consent will not be unreasonably
withheld, delayed or conditioned), except as such release or announcement may
be required by applicable Law or the rules or regulations of any applicable
United States securities exchange or Governmental Entity to which the relevant
party is subject, in which case the party required to make the release or
announcement will use its commercially reasonable efforts to allow each other
party reasonable time to comment on such release or announcement in advance of
such issuance. The Company, Parent and Merger Sub agree that the press release
announcing the execution and delivery of this Agreement will be a joint
release of, and will not be issued prior to the approval of each of, the
Company and Parent.

 

5.8 _Employee Benefit Matters_.

 

(a) For a period of one year following the Effective Time, Parent will
provide, or will cause to be provided, to each employee of the Company who
continues to be employed by Parent and Parent Subsidiaries (individually, a "
_Company Employee_ " and collectively, " _Company Employees_ ") in the same
geographic location at which such employee is employed as of the Closing Date
who is not at the applicable time covered by a CBA (individually, a "
_Continuing Employee_ " and collectively, the " _Continuing Employees_ ") base
salary rate, commission, target bonus opportunity and benefits on terms at
least as favorable in the aggregate as the corresponding cash compensation
opportunities and benefits provided to the Continuing Employee by the Company
immediately prior to the Effective Time. The employment terms and conditions
of each Company Employee whose employment is covered by a CBA at the
applicable time shall be governed by the applicable CBA.

 

(b) To satisfy the continuing benefit obligation of _Section 5.8(a)_ , Parent
may either (i) continue Company Benefit Plans with respect to Continuing
Employees, (ii) permit Continuing Employees and, as applicable, their eligible
dependents, to participate in the employee benefit plans, programs or policies
(including without limitation any plan intended to qualify within the
meaning of Section 401(a) of the Code and any vacation, sick, or personal
time off plans or programs) of Parent, or (iii) a combination of clauses (i)
and (ii). To the extent Parent elects to have Continuing Employees and their
eligible dependents participate in its employee benefit plans, program or
policies following the Effective Time, Parent shall, and shall cause the
Surviving Corporation to, treat, and cause the applicable benefit plans in
which Continuing Employees are entitled to participate to treat (subject to
any required approval of the applicable insurance provider), the service of
Continuing Employees with the Company or any of its predecessors to the extent
previously recognized by the Company as of the date hereof attributable to
any period before the Effective Time as service rendered to Parent, the
Surviving Corporation, or any Subsidiary of Parent for purposes of eligibility
to participate, vesting and for other 

 



-39-  appropriate benefits including the applicability of minimum waiting periods
for participation, but excluding benefit accrual (including minimum pension
amount), equity incentive plans and eligibility for early retirement under
any benefit plan of Parent or eligibility for retiree welfare benefit plans or
as would otherwise result in a duplication of benefits. Without limiting the
foregoing, Parent shall cause any pre-existing conditions or actively at work
or similar limitations, eligibility waiting periods, evidence of insurability
requirements or required physical examinations under any health or similar
plan of Parent to be waived with respect to Continuing Employees and their
eligible dependents (subject to any required approval of the applicable
insurance provider); _provided_ , _however_ , that with respect to preexisting
conditions, such conditions shall be waived to the extent waived under
the corresponding plan in which Continuing Employees participated immediately
prior to the date Continuing Employees and their eligible dependents are
transitioned to ParentÂ’s health or similar plans. Parent shall also use
commercially reasonable efforts to cause any deductibles paid by Continuing
Employees under any of the CompanyÂ’s health plans in the plan year in which
Continuing Employees and their eligible dependents are transitioned to
ParentÂ’s health or similar plans to be credited towards deductibles under the
health plans of Parent or any Subsidiary of Parent.

(c) For the terms of the agreements or arrangements, Parent shall honor, and
shall cause the Company or the Surviving Corporation, as applicable, to honor,
in accordance with their terms, the employment, severance and change in
control agreements and arrangements that are listed on  _Section_ _ _
_5.8(c)_ of the Company Disclosure Schedule.

(d) Nothing in this Agreement will require the continued employment of any
Person. No provision of this Agreement will constitute an amendment of, or
will prevent Parent or the Surviving Corporation from amending or terminating,
any Company Benefit Plan or benefit plans of any Parent or
Parent Subsidiaries.

(e) The Company and Parent acknowledge and agree that all provisions contained
in this  _Section_ _ _ _5.8_ with respect to employees are included for the
sole benefit of the respective parties and will not create any right in any
other Person, including any employees, former employees, any participant in
any Company Benefit Plan or any beneficiary thereof, nor will require the
Company to continue or amend any particular benefit plan after the
consummation of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement for any
employee or former employee of the Company, and any such plan may be amended
or terminated in accordance with its terms and applicable Law.

(f) Notwithstanding any provision in this Agreement to the contrary, nothing
in this _Section 5.8_ shall create any third party beneficiary rights in any
Company Employee or current or former Service Provider (or any beneficiaries
or dependents thereof).

 

5.9 _Indemnification of Directors and Officers_.

 

(a) For a period of six years from and after the Effective Time, Parent and
the Surviving Corporation will indemnify and hold harmless all past and
present directors and officers of the Company (as applicable) to the same
extent such Persons are required to be indemnified as of the date of this
Agreement by the Company pursuant to applicable Law, the Company Charter, the
Company Bylaws and indemnification agreements as in effect on the date of
this Agreement and Made Available to Parent with any directors and officers of
the Company arising out of acts or omissions in their capacity as directors or
officers of the Company occurring at or prior to the Effective Time. Parent
and the Surviving Corporation will advance expenses (including reasonable
legal fees and expenses) incurred in the defense of any Proceedings with
respect to the matters subject to indemnification pursuant to this _Section
5.9(a)_ to the same extent such Persons are required to be advanced expenses
by, and in accordance with the procedures set forth in, the Company Charter
and the Company Bylaws and indemnification agreements as in effect on the
date of this Agreement and Made Available to Parent with any directors and
officers of the Company.

 



-40- (b) For a period of six years from and after the Effective Time, Parent will
cause the certificate of incorporation and bylaws of the Surviving
Corporation to contain provisions no less favorable with respect to
exculpation and indemnification of directors and officers of the Company for
periods at or prior to the Effective Time than are currently set forth in the
Company Charter and the Company Bylaws.

(c) For six years from and after the Effective Time, Parent will cause the
Surviving Corporation to maintain for the benefit of the CompanyÂ’s directors
and officers, as of the date of this Agreement and as of the Effective Time,
an insurance and indemnification policy that provides coverage for
events occurring prior to the Effective Time (the " _D andO Insurance_") that
is substantially equivalent to and in any event not less favorable in the
aggregate than the CompanyÂ’s existing policy (accurate and complete copies
which have been Made Available to Parent) or, if substantially equivalent
insurance coverage is unavailable, the best available coverage; _provided_ ,
_however_ , that the Surviving Corporation will not be required to pay an
annual premium for the DandO Insurance in excess of 300% of the last annual
premium paid prior to the date of this Agreement (which annual premium is
hereby represented and warranted by the Company to be as set forth in _Section
5.9(c)_ of the Company Disclosure Schedule). The Company shall have the right
to obtain prior to the Effective Time (and the provisions of the immediately
preceding sentence will be deemed to have been satisfied if the Company has
obtained prior to the Effective Time) prepaid "tail" insurance policies on
terms and conditions providing at least substantially equivalent benefits as
the DandO Insurance currently maintained by the Company for the benefit of its
directors and officers, which provides such directors and officers with
coverage for an aggregate period of six years with respect to claims arising
from facts or events that occurred on or before the Effective Time, including
in respect of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement. If such
prepaid policies have been obtained prior to the Effective Time, Parent will
cause the Surviving Corporation to maintain such policies in full force and
effect and continue to honor the obligations thereunder.

 

(d) In the event Parent or the Surviving Corporation (i) consolidates with or
merges into any other Person and will not be the continuing or surviving
corporation or entity of such consolidation or merger or (ii) transfers all or
substantially all of its properties and assets to any Person, then proper
provision will be made so that such continuing or surviving corporation or
entity or transferee of such assets, as the case may be, will assume the
obligations set forth in this _Section 5.9_.

(e) The obligations under this _Section 5.9_ will (i) continue,
notwithstanding any six-year limitation referred to above, until the final
disposition of any action, suit, proceeding or investigation brought or
commenced during such six-year period and (ii) not be terminated or modified
in such a manner as to adversely affect any indemnitee to whom this _Section
5.9_ applies without the consent of such affected indemnitee (it being
expressly agreed that the indemnitees to whom this _Section 5.9_  applies
will be third-party beneficiaries of this _Section 5.9_ ).

5.10 _State Takeover Laws_. The Company and the Company Board shall take no
action to cause any "control share acquisition," "fair price," "business
combination" or other anti-takeover Laws to become applicable to this
Agreement, the Merger (including the acquisition of Shares pursuant thereto),
the Support Agreement or any of the transactions contemplated hereby or
thereby. If any "control share acquisition," "fair price," "business
combination" or other anti-takeover Laws becomes or is deemed to be
applicable to the Company, Parent, Merger Sub or the Merger, including the
acquisition of Shares pursuant thereto, this Agreement, the Support Agreement
or any other transaction contemplated hereby or thereby, then the Company
Board will take all action necessary to render such Law inapplicable to the
foregoing.

Sub to comply with its obligations under this Agreement.

5.12 _Section_ _ _ _16 Matters_. Prior to the Effective Time, the Company

covered Person of the Company for purposes of Section 16 of the Exchange Act
(" _Section_ _ _ _16_ ") of Shares (including Company RSAs), Company RSUs or
Company Options pursuant to this Agreement and the Merger will be an
exempt transaction for purposes of Section 16\.

5.13 _Stock Exchange Delisting; Deregistration_. Prior to the Closing Date,
the Company and Parent will cooperate and use their respective reasonable
best efforts to cause the delisting of the shares of Company Common Stock from
NASDAQ and the deregistration of such shares as promptly as practicable
following the Effective Time in compliance with applicable Law.

5.14 _Stockholder Litigation_. The Company will promptly provide Parent with
any pleadings and correspondence relating to any Proceedings involving the
Company or any of its officers or directors relating to this Agreement, the
Support Agreement or the transactions contemplated hereby or thereby
(including derivative claims) and will keep Parent reasonably informed
regarding the status of any such Proceedings. The Company will cooperate with,
and to the extent reasonably practicable, give Parent the opportunity to
consult and participate with respect to the defense or settlement of any such
Proceeding, and no such settlement will be agreed to without the prior written
consent of Parent (such consent not to be unreasonably withheld, delayed or
conditioned).

 

5.15 _Director Resignations_. At the Closing, the Company shall deliver to
Parent evidence reasonably satisfactory to Parent of the resignation,
effective at the Effective Time, of each director of the Company in office as
of immediately prior to the Effective Time.

 

5.16 _FIRPTA Certificate_. Not earlier than thirty days prior to the Closing
Date, the Company shall deliver to Parent a statement, issued by the Company
in accordance with Treasury Regulations section 1.1445-2(c)(3) and sworn under
penalty of perjury, certifying that the Company has not been a U.S. real
property holding corporation at any time during the period specified by
Treasury Regulations section 1.1445-2(c)(3).

5.17  _Termination of 401(k) Plan_. If requested by Parent in writing not
later than ten (10) calendar days prior to Closing, the Company will adopt, or
will cause to be adopted, all necessary corporate resolutions (which shall be
subject to ParentÂ’s reasonable and timely review and approval) to terminate
each 401(k) Plan sponsored or maintained by the Company, effective as of no
later than one day prior the Effective Time (but such termination may be
contingent upon the Closing). For this purpose, the term " _401(k) Plan_ "
means any Company Benefit Plan that is intended to be qualified under Code
Section 401(a) which includes a cash or deferred arrangement intended to
qualify under Code Section 401(k). The Company shall provide Parent with a
copy of resolutions duly adopted by the Company Board so terminating any such
401(k) Plan.

(d) In no event shall the Company be required to pay the Breakup Fee to Parent

Company shall pay to Parent and Merger Sub its costs and expenses (including
reasonable attorneyÂ’s fees and disbursements) in connection with such suit,

material breach of _Section 5.3_ ), in the event that the Breakup Fee is paid
or payable pursuant to this _Section 7.2_ , ParentÂ’s right to receive payment
of the Breakup Fee shall be the sole and exclusive remedy of Parent and its
Affiliates and Representatives against the Company and its Affiliates and
Representatives under this Agreement or arising out of or related to this
Agreement or the transactions contemplated hereby, and upon payment of such
amount, none of the Company or any of its Affiliates or Representatives shall
have any liability or obligation relating to or arising out of this Agreement
or the transactions contemplated hereby, in each case whether based on
contract, tort or strict liability, by the enforcement of any assessment, by
any legal or equitable proceeding, by virtue of any statute, regulation or
applicable Law or otherwise.

Sub; _provided_ , _however_ , that, after adoption of this Agreement by such
stockholders, no amendment may be made which, by Law or in accordance with the
rules of any relevant stock exchange, requires further approval by such
stockholders without obtaining such further approval. This Agreement may not
be amended except by an instrument in writing signed by the parties hereto.

7.4  _Waiver_. At any time prior to the Effective Time, Parent and Merger
Sub, on the one hand, and the Company, on the other hand, may (i) extend the
time for the performance of any of the obligations or other acts of the
other, (ii) waive any Uncured Inaccuracies in the representations and
warranties of the other contained herein or in any document delivered pursuant
hereto and (iii) waive compliance by the other with any of the agreements or
conditions contained herein. Any such extension or waiver will be valid only
if set forth in an instrument in writing signed by the party or parties to be
bound thereby, but such extension or waiver or failure to insist on strict
compliance with an obligation, covenant, agreement or condition will not
operate as a waiver of, or estoppel with respect to, any subsequent or other
failure.

disposition of a Proceeding, except as to Proceedings to enforce rights to
advancement, Expenses relating to a Proceeding (or part thereof) instituted
against the Corporation by such Indemnitee. Section 4. _Not Exclusive Remedy_. The rights to indemnification and to

Incorporation, provision of the Bylaws of the Corporation, agreement, vote of
stockholders or disinterested directors or otherwise.

_Article IX_ shall be contract rights and such rights shall continue as to an
Indemnitee who has ceased to be a director, officer or employee of the
Corporation and shall inure to the benefit of the IndemniteeÂ’s heirs,
executors and administrators.

Section 6. _Amendment or Repeal_. Any repeal or modification of the
provisions of this _Article IX_ by the stockholders of the Corporation shall
