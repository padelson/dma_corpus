Authority, and are true, correct and complete in all material respects, (ii)
all Taxes due and owing (whether or not shown as due on any Tax Returns) have

by any Tax Authority in a jurisdiction in which Springfield does not file a
Tax Return that it is or may be subject to taxation in that jurisdiction, (ii)
Springfield is not a party to any Tax-Sharing Agreement, and is not otherwise

Section 1.6011-4.

has been, disregarded as an entity separate from its owner for federal income
tax purposes. The classification for federal income tax purposes of
Springfield will not change after the Closing by reason of any action taken by
a Contributing Party on or before the Closing Date or by reason of any action
taken on or before the Closing Date by any Person who was at the time such
action was taken an Affiliate of a Contributing Party. The Contributing
Parties have not reported the co-ownership arrangement for the Springfield

(d) Qualifying Income. In the 12 month period ended December 31, 2015, more
than 90% of the gross income (as determined for federal income tax purposes)
of the businesses conducted by Springfield and the Springfield Assets would
have been qualifying income, within the meaning of Section 7704(d) of the
Code, if the co-ownership arrangement for the Springfield Assets had been
reported as a partnership for federal income tax purposes. The Contributing
Parties expect that more than 90% of the gross income of the business that is
to be conducted by Springfield and the Springfield Assets in the remainder of
2016 following the Closing Date will be qualifying income, provided that no
significant change occurs after the Closing Date with respect to the methods
by which the Springfield Assets generate revenue. No action has been taken, or
is contemplated, by a Contributing Party or Springfield that is expected to
result in a significant change in the methods by which the Springfield Assets
generate revenue.

the warranty in this Section.

writing to the Indemnifying Party specifying in reasonable detail the nature
of and specific basis for such claim. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the
Indemnified Party's failure to provide notice under this Section 9.4 will not
relieve the Indemnifying Party from the liability hereunder with respect to
such matter except in the event and only to the extent that the Indemnifying
Party is materially prejudiced by such failure or delay. Such notice shall
include a formal demand for indemnification under this Agreement.

Section 9.5 Right to Contest and Defend. The Indemnifying Party shall be
entitled at its cost and expense to contest and defend by all appropriate
legal proceedings any Indemnity Claim with respect to which it is called upon
to indemnify the Indemnified Party under the provisions of this Agreement;
provided that notice of the intention to so contest shall be delivered by the
Indemnifying Party to the Indemnified Party within 20 days from the date of
receipt by the Indemnifying Party of notice by the Indemnified Party of the
assertion of the Indemnity Claim. Any such contest may be conducted in the
name and on behalf of the Indemnifying Party or the Indemnified Party as may
be appropriate. Such contest shall be conducted by reputable counsel (in the
reasonable opinion of the Indemnifying Party) employed by the Indemnifying
Party and not reasonably objected to by the Indemnified Party, but the
Indemnified Party shall have the right but not the obligation to participate
in such proceedings and to be represented by counsel of its own choosing at
its sole cost and expense. The Indemnifying Party shall have full authority to
determine all action to be taken with respect such proceedings; provided,
however, that the Indemnifying Party will not have the authority to subject
the Indemnified Party to any obligation whatsoever, other than the performance
of purely ministerial tasks or obligations not involving material expense. If
the Indemnifying Party does not elect to contest any such Indemnity Claim, the
Indemnifying Party shall be bound by the result obtained with respect to such
claim by the Indemnified Party. If the Indemnifying Party shall have assumed
the defense of an Indemnity Claim, the Indemnified Party shall agree to any
settlement, compromise or discharge of an Indemnity Claim that the
Indemnifying Party may recommend and that by its terms obligates the
Indemnifying Party to pay the full amount of the liability in connection with
such Indemnity Claim, which fully and completely releases the Indemnified
Party in connection with such Indemnity Claim and which would not otherwise
adversely affect the Indemnified Party.

Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Indemnifying Party shall not be entitled to
assume the defense of any Indemnity Claim (and shall be liable for the
reasonable fees and expenses of counsel incurred by the Indemnified Party in
defending such Indemnity Claim) if the Indemnity Claim seeks an order,
injunction or other equitable relief or relief for other than money damages
against the Indemnified Party which the Indemnified Party reasonably
determines, upon the advice of outside counsel, cannot be separated from any
related claim for money damages. If such equitable relief or other relief
portion of the Indemnity Claim can be so separated from that for money
damages, the Indemnifying Party shall be entitled to assume the defense of the
portion relating to money damages. 

Section 9.6 Cooperation. The Indemnified Party agrees to cooperate with the
Indemnifying Party with respect to all aspects of the defense of any Indemnity
Claims covered by the indemnification set forth in this Article IX, including
the prompt furnishing to the Indemnifying Party of any correspondence or other
notice relating thereto that the Indemnified Party may receive, permitting the
names of the Indemnified Party to be utilized in connection with such defense,
the making available to the Indemnifying Party of any files, records or other
information of the Indemnified Party that the Indemnifying Party reasonably
considers relevant to such defense and the making available to the
Indemnifying Party of any employees of the Indemnified Party; provided,
however, that in connection therewith the Indemnifying Party agrees to use
reasonable efforts to minimize the impact thereof on the operations of the
Indemnified Party and further agrees to maintain the confidentiality of all
files, records and other information furnished by the Indemnified Party
pursuant to this Section 9.6, unless otherwise required by Law or the listing
standards of the New York Stock Exchange or any other applicable exchange or
quotation system. In no event shall the obligation of the Indemnified Party to
cooperate with the Indemnifying Party as set forth in the immediately
preceding sentence be construed as imposing upon the Indemnified Party an
obligation to hire and pay for counsel in connection with the defense of any
claims covered by the indemnification set forth in this Article IX; provided,
however, that the Indemnified Party may, at its own option, cost and expense,
hire and pay for counsel in connection with any such defense. The Indemnifying
Party agrees to keep any such counsel hired by the Indemnified Party
reasonably informed as to the status of any such defense, but the Indemnifying
Party shall have the right to retain sole control over such defense to the
extent provided above.

Section 9.7 Payment of Losses. The indemnification required hereunder shall be
made by monthly payments of the amount thereof during the course of the
investigation or defense, within 30 days as and when reasonably specific bills
are received or Loss is incurred and reasonable evidence thereof is delivered.
In calculating any amount to be paid by an Indemnifying Party by reason of the
indemnification provisions of this Agreement, the amount to be paid shall be
reduced by (i) any insurance proceeds related to indemnified Losses realized
by the Indemnified Party and (ii) any amounts related to indemnified Losses
recovered by the Indemnified Party under contractual indemnities from third
parties.

Section 9.8 Limitations on Indemnification.

(a) To the extent the Partnership Indemnified Parties are entitled to
indemnification for Losses pursuant to Section 9.3(a) (other than for Losses
related to a breach of the representations and warranties in Section 4.6),
Anadarko shall not be liable for those Losses unless the aggregate amount of
Losses exceeds 1.0% of the sum of (i) the Cash Consideration, plus (ii) $37.5
million (the sum of (i) and (ii) being the "Aggregate Consideration") (the
"Deductible"), and then only to the extent of any such excess.

(b) In addition, to the extent the Partnership Indemnified Parties are
entitled to indemnification for Losses pursuant to Section 9.3(a), Anadarko
shall not be liable for such Losses that exceed, in the aggregate, 25% of the
Aggregate Consideration less the Deductible. 

(c) Notwithstanding Section 9.8(a) and (b), to the extent the Partnership
Indemnified Parties are entitled to indemnification for Losses arising from a
breach of the representations and warranties in Sections 4.6 and 4.7, pursuant
to Section 9.3(b), 9.3(c), 9.3(d), or 9.3(e), or for claims arising from
fraud, Anadarko shall be fully liable for such Losses without respect to the
Deductible in Section 9.8(a) and the limitations in Section 9.8(b).

(d) To the extent the Anadarko Indemnified Parties are entitled to
indemnification for Losses pursuant to Section 9.2(a), the Partnership shall
not be liable for those Losses unless the aggregate amount of Losses exceeds,
in the aggregate, the Deductible, and then only to the extent of any such
excess. In addition, to the extent the Anadarko Indemnified Parties are
entitled to indemnification for Losses pursuant to Section 9.2(a), the
Partnership shall not be liable for such Losses that exceed, in the aggregate,
10% of the Aggregate Consideration less the Deductible.

(e) Notwithstanding Section 9.8(d), to the extent the Anadarko Indemnified
Parties are entitled to indemnification for Losses pursuant to Section 9.2(b)
or for claims arising from fraud, the Partnership shall be fully liable for
such Losses without respect to the Deductible and the limitations in Section
9.8(d).

Section 9.9 Sole Remedy. Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary,
after the Closing, this Article IX contains the Anadarko Indemnified Parties'
and the Partnership Indemnified Parties' exclusive remedy against each other
with respect to breaches of the representations, warranties, covenants and
agreements of the Parties contained in Article IV and Article V and in the
covenants in this Agreement to be performed prior to the Closing, in each case
other than claims or causes of action arising from fraud. All references in
this Article IX to such breaches of such representations, warranties,
covenants and agreements include any affirmation of such representations,
warranties, covenants and agreements contained in the certificates delivered
at Closing by the Contributing Parties pursuant to Section 3.2(b) or by the
Recipient Parties pursuant to Section 3.3(d).

Section 9.10 Treatment of Indemnification Payments. For all Tax purposes, the
Parties agree to treat (and will cause each of their respective Affiliates to
treat) any indemnification payment made under this Article IX as an adjustment
to the Cash Consideration.

Section 9.11 Express Negligence Rule. THE INDEMNIFICATION PROVISIONS PROVIDED
FOR IN THIS AGREEMENT HAVE BEEN EXPRESSLY NEGOTIATED IN EVERY DETAIL, ARE
INTENDED TO BE GIVEN FULL AND LITERAL EFFECT, AND SHALL BE APPLICABLE WHETHER
OR NOT THE LIABILITIES, OBLIGATIONS, CLAIMS, JUDGMENTS, LOSSES, COSTS,
EXPENSES OR DAMAGES IN QUESTION ARISE OR AROSE SOLELY OR IN PART FROM THE
GROSS, ACTIVE, PASSIVE OR CONCURRENT NEGLIGENCE, STRICT LIABILITY, OR OTHER
FAULT OF ANY INDEMNIFIED PARTY. ANADARKO AND THE CONTRIBUTING PARTIES AND THE
RECIPIENT PARTIES ACKNOWLEDGE THAT THIS STATEMENT COMPLIES WITH THE EXPRESS
NEGLIGENCE RULE AND CONSTITUTES CONSPICUOUS NOTICE. NOTICE IN THIS CONSPICUOUS
NOTICE IS NOT INTENDED TO PROVIDE OR ALTER THE RIGHTS AND 

OBLIGATIONS OF ANADARKO AND THE PARTIES, ALL OF WHICH ARE SPECIFIED ELSEWHERE
IN THIS AGREEMENT.

giving notice in accordance with this Section 11.2.

Section 11.3 Severability. If any term or other provision of this Agreement or
in any other document delivered pursuant hereto shall, for any reason, be held
to be invalid, illegal, or incapable of being enforced under applicable Law,
or public policy, all other conditions and provisions of this Agreement shall
nevertheless remain in full force and effect. Upon such determination that any
term or other provision of this Agreement is invalid, illegal, or incapable of
being enforced, the Parties shall negotiate in good faith to modify this
Agreement so as to effect the original intention of the Parties as closely as
possible in a mutually acceptable manner in order that the transactions
contemplated herein are consummated as originally contemplated to the fullest
extent possible.

Section 11.4 Governing Law; Consent to Jurisdiction. This Agreement shall be
governed by and construed and enforced in accordance with the laws of the
State of Texas, excluding any conflicts-of-law rule or principle that might
refer the construction or interpretation of this Agreement to the laws of
another state. The Parties hereto irrevocably submit to the jurisdiction of
the courts of the State of Texas and the federal courts of the United States
of America located in Harris County, Texas over any dispute between the
Parties arising out of this Agreement or the transaction contemplated hereby,
and each Party irrevocably agrees that all such claims in respect of such
dispute shall be heard and determined in such courts. The Parties hereto
irrevocably waive, to the fullest extent permitted by Law, any objection which
they may now or hereafter have to the venue of any dispute arising out of this
Agreement or the transaction contemplated hereby being brought in such court
or any defense of inconvenient forum for the maintenance of such dispute. Each
Party agrees that a judgment in any such dispute may be enforced in other
jurisdictions by suit on the judgment or in any other manner provided by Law.

Section 11.5 Parties in Interest. This Agreement shall be binding upon and
inure solely to the benefit of each Party hereto and their successors and
permitted assigns, and nothing in this Agreement, express or implied, is
intended to confer upon any other Person any rights or remedies of any nature
whatsoever under or by reason of this Agreement, except for express language
with respect to the Partnership Indemnified Parties and the Anadarko
Indemnified Parties contained in the indemnification provisions of Article IX.

Section 11.6 Assignment. Neither this Agreement nor any of the rights,
interests, or obligations hereunder may be assigned, by operation of Law or
otherwise, by any Party without the prior written consent of the other
Parties, and any attempted assignment without such consent shall be void.

Section 11.7 No Amendment or Waiver. No amendment, supplement, modification or
waiver of this Agreement shall be binding unless executed in writing by the
Party to be bound thereby. No waiver of any of the provisions of this
Agreement or a breach hereof shall be deemed 

or shall constitute a waiver of any other provision hereof (regardless of
whether similar), nor shall any such waiver constitute a continuing waiver
unless otherwise expressly provided.

Section 11.8 Counterparts. This Agreement may be executed in two or more
counterparts, each of which shall be deemed an original, but all of which
together shall constitute one and the same instrument. Facsimile copies of
signatures shall constitute original signatures for all purposes of this
Agreement and any enforcement hereof.

and the Ancillary Documents supersede any previous understandings or
agreements among the Parties, whether oral or written, with respect to their
subject matter. This Agreement, the Exhibits and Schedules hereto and the
Ancillary Documents contain the entire understanding of the Parties with
respect to the subject matter hereof and thereof. No understanding,
representation, promise or agreement, whether oral or written, is intended to
