                          AGREEMENT AND PLAN OF MERGER

     AGREEMENT  AND PLAN OF  MERGER  dated  effective  October  29,  2003  (this
"Agreement")  by  and  among:  Starcraft  Corporation,  an  Indiana  corporation
("Parent");  Wheel  to  Wheel  Acquisition  Company,  LLC,  an  Indiana  limited
liability company ("Acquisition  Subsidiary");  Wheel to Wheel, Inc., a Michigan
corporation  (the  "Company"),  the  shareholders  of the Company  listed on the
signature pages attached to this Agreement (the "Shareholders");  and Jeffrey P.
Beitzel,    as    representative   of   the   Shareholders   (the   "Shareholder
Representative").

                              W I T N E S S E T H:


     WHEREAS,  the Company and Company  Subsidiaries are engaged in the business
(the  "Business")  of  aftermarket-parts  manufacturing  and  marketing,  up-fit
customization and specialized  packages,  pace cars, show cars, and second-stage
engineering, design, consulting, and product development for automotive original
equipment  manufacturers  including,  but not limited to the  specific  licensed
products for GM SPO including  Corvette,  Hummer H2 and other accessory products
(the "Products").

     WHEREAS,  the Board of Directors of Company and Parent have determined that
it is in the best interests of their  respective  companies and  shareholders to
merge the Company with and into Acquisition Subsidiary, subject to the terms and
subject to the conditions set forth in this Agreement; and

     WHEREAS,  the  Shareholders  own,  and  will own  immediately  prior to the
Closing (as defined below),  of record and  beneficially,  all of the issued and
outstanding  shares of  Company's  voting,  $5.00 par value,  common  stock (the
"Company  Common  Stock"),  and,  subject  to the terms and  conditions  of this
Agreement,  the Shareholders have agreed, in their capacity as Shareholders,  to
enter into this Agreement and consummate the transactions contemplated hereby.

     NOW THEREFORE,  in consideration of the promises and the mutual agreements,
covenants,  representations and warranties herein contained,  the parties hereto
agree as follows:

                                    ARTICLE I
                                   THE MERGER

SECTION 1.01 The Merger.  Upon the terms and subject to the conditions set forth
in this Agreement,  and in accordance with the Indiana Business  Corporation Law
(the "IBCL") and the Michigan  Business  Corporation  Act (the  "MBCA"),  at the
Effective  Time  (as  defined  below)  Company  will be  merged  with  and  into
Acquisition  Subsidiary,  Company's separate corporate existence will cease, and
the  Acquisition  Subsidiary  will  continue as the  surviving  company and as a
wholly-owned subsidiary of Parent (the "Merger").  The Acquisition Subsidiary as
the surviving  company  after the Merger is sometimes  referred to herein as the
"Surviving Company".

SECTION 1.02  Effective  Time.  The parties shall  prepare,  execute and deliver
articles of merger, a certificate of merger and/or other  appropriate  documents
necessary to effectuate  the Merger (in any such case, the "Articles of Merger")
in  accordance  with the relevant  provisions of the IBCL and MBCA and file same
with the  Secretary  of State of the State of Indiana and the State of Michigan.
The Merger shall become effective upon the filing of the Articles of Merger with
the  Secretary  of State of the State of Indiana or at such  subsequent  time or
date as Parent  and the  Company  shall  agree and  specify in the  Articles  of
Merger.  The time at which the Merger  becomes  effective is referred to in this
Agreement as the "Effective Time".

SECTION  1.03  Effects  of the  Merger.  At and after the  Effective  Time,  the
Surviving Company shall succeed to and possess, without further act or deed, all
of the  estate,  rights,  privileges,  powers and  franchises,  both  public and
private, and all of the property,  real, personal, and mixed, of the Company and
Acquisition Subsidiary;  all debts due to the Company and Acquisition Subsidiary
shall be vested in the Surviving Company; all claims, demands, property, rights,
privileges,  powers and  franchises  and every other interest of the Company and
Acquisition  Subsidiary  shall be as  effectively  the property of the Surviving
Company as they were of the Company and  Acquisition  Subsidiary,  respectively;
the title to any real  estate  vested by deed or  otherwise  in the  Company and
Acquisition  Subsidiary  shall not revert or be in any way impaired by reason of
the  Merger,  but  shall be  vested  in the  Surviving  Company;  all  rights of
creditors  and all  liens  upon any  property  of the  Company  and  Acquisition
Subsidiary  shall  be  preserved  unimpaired,  limited  in lien to the  property
affected  by such  lien at the  Effective  Time of the  Merger;  and all  debts,
liabilities,  and  duties  of  the  Company  and  Acquisition  Subsidiary  shall
thenceforth  attach to the Surviving  Company and may be enforced  against it to
the same extent as if such debts,  liabilities  and duties had been  incurred or
contracted  by it. No private  letter ruling is or has been applied for with the
Internal Revenue Service ("IRS"), and the parties shall each rely upon their own
(and only their own) tax,  financial,  and legal advice in  connection  with the
effects of Merger and tax consequences  related thereto.  The parties intend for
the Merger to qualify as a tax-free  reorganization under ss.368(a)(1)(A) of the
Internal  Revenue Code of 1986,  as amended  ("Code") and agree not to knowingly
take any action or enter into any transaction  prior to or following the Closing
that  results in the Merger not meeting  the  requirements  of a  reorganization
under ss.368(a)(1)(A) of the Code by final action of the IRS that is not subject
to appeal.

SECTION 1.04 Articles of Incorporation and By-laws.

     (a)  The  Articles  of  Organization,   as  amended,   of  the  Acquisition
Subsidiary,  as in effect  immediately prior to the Effective Time, shall be the
Articles of Organization of the Surviving  Company until  thereafter  changed or
amended as provided therein or by applicable law.

     (b) The Operating Agreement and By-laws of the Acquisition  Subsidiary,  as
in  effect  immediately  prior to the  Effective  Time,  shall be the  Operating
Agreement  and By-laws of the  Surviving  Company  until  thereafter  changed or
amended as provided therein or by applicable law.

SECTION 1.05 Directors.  Subject to Section 5.03B,  the directors of Acquisition
Subsidiary immediately prior to the Effective Time shall be the directors of the
Surviving  Company  until the earlier of their  resignation  or removal or until
their respective successors are duly elected and qualified, as the case may be.

SECTION 1.06 Officers. Subject to Section 5.03B, the officers of the Acquisition
Subsidiary  immediately prior to the Effective Time shall be the officers of the
Surviving  Company  until the earlier of their  resignation  or removal or until
their respective successors are duly elected and qualified, as the case may be.

SECTION 1.07  Cancellation  and  Conversion of the Capital Stock and  Membership
Interests of the Company and Acquisition  Subsidiary.  At the Effective Time, by
virtue of the  Merger  and  without  any action on the part of the holder of any
shares of  capital  stock or  membership  interests  of the  Company,  Parent or
Acquisition Subsidiary:

     (a)  Membership  Interests  of  Acquisition  Subsidiary.  Each  issued  and
outstanding  membership  interest of Acquisition  Subsidiary  shall be converted
into  and  shall  become  one  validly  issued,  fully  paid  and  nonassessable
membership interest of the Surviving Company.

     (b) Cancellation of Treasury Stock. Each share of Company Common Stock that
is owned by the Company as treasury  stock  immediately  prior to the  Effective
Time shall automatically be canceled and retired and shall cease to exist.

     (c)  Cancellation  of the Company Stock Options.  Immediately  prior to the
Effective  Time, each Company Stock Option,  whether or not then  exercisable or
vested, shall automatically be cancelled and retired and shall cease to exist.

     (d)  Conversion  of the  Company  Common  Stock.  All of the  shares of the
Company Common Stock issued and outstanding  immediately  prior to the Effective
Time (other than shares to be canceled in accordance with Section 1.07(b)) shall
be exchanged for shares of voting common stock, no par value, of the Parent (the
"Parent Common Stock") in the Merger  Exchange  described in Section 2.01.  Each
share of Parent Common Stock issued in the Merger  Exchange shall be issued with
one (1) common share purchase right pursuant to the Parent's  Rights  Agreement,
dated  as of  August  12,  1997,  as  amended  from  time to time  (the  "Rights
Agreement").

SECTION 1.08 Exchange Procedure.

     (a) Exchange Procedure. At the Effective Time, all shares of Company Common
Stock shall no longer be  outstanding  and shall  automatically  be canceled and
shall cease to exist. At Closing,  each Shareholder shall surrender to Company a
certificate or certificates  that immediately prior to Closing and the Effective
Time represented all such  Shareholder's  shares (a  "Certificate"),  and at the
Effective  Time the  Certificate  shall  cease to have any rights  with  respect
thereto,  except the right to receive Parent Common Stock in the Merger Exchange
in accordance  with Section 2.01. At the Effective Time, and upon surrender of a
Certificate to Parent for  cancellation,  the  Shareholder  shall be entitled to
receive and shall receive in exchange  therefor stock  certificates of Parent in
the amount of Parent  Common  Stock  described  in and  determined  pursuant  to
Sections 2.01, and the Certificate so surrendered shall forthwith be canceled.

     (b) No Further  Ownership Rights in Company Common Stock. All Parent Common
Stock  issued in exchange  for,  and upon the  surrender  of, a  Certificate  in
accordance  with  the  terms of this  Article  I shall be  deemed  to have  been
exchanged in full  satisfaction  of all rights of Shareholder  pertaining to the
Certificate  and to the shares of Company Common Stock  formerly  represented by
such Certificate.

                                   ARTICLE II
                                 MERGER EXCHANGE

SECTION 2.01 The Merger Exchange.

     (a)  Determination  of Merger  Exchange.  The total amount of Parent Common
Stock to be exchanged  (the "Merger  Exchange") for all of the shares of Company
Common  Stock shall be Three  Million Five Hundred  Fifty  Thousand  (3,550,000)
shares of Parent  Common Stock.  The Parent Common Stock issued to  Shareholders
shall be validly issued, fully paid, and non-assessable  shares of Parent Common
Stock,  and  shall  have  the  same  rights  as each and  every  other  share of
authorized Parent Common Stock, including, without limitation, voting rights and
dividend rights.

     (b)  Calculation  of the Merger  Exchange.  On the Closing Date, the Merger
Exchange shall be consummated as follows:  each Shareholder of the Company shall
receive  in  exchange  for  all  of the  Company  Common  Stock  owned  by  each
Shareholder  an amount of Parent  Common Stock in respect  thereof  equal to the
product  obtained by  multiplying  (i) that  percentage of all of the issued and
outstanding  Company Common Stock owned by such  Shareholder,  by (ii) the total
number of shares of Parent  Common  Stock issued in  connection  with the Merger
Exchange.   For  example,  a  Shareholder  with  one-third  of  the  issued  and
outstanding Company Common Stock shall receive in exchange therefor one-third of
the Parent  Common  Stock to be issued in the  Merger  Exchange,  to-wit:  (1/3)
(3,550,000)  = 1,183,333  shares of Parent Common  Stock.  Percentages  shall be
rounded up or down to the nearest whole percentage,  with a percentage ending in
.50% rounded down.

     (c) Private Placement.  At Closing,  the Parent Common Stock shall not have
been  registered  under  applicable  Federal  or  State  securities  laws.  Each
Shareholder will receive Parent Common Stock in a private  placement exempt from
registration  under  applicable  provisions  of the  Securities  Act of 1933, as
amended ("Securities Act"), and regulations thereunder, and Indiana and Michigan
securities  laws.  Accordingly,   such  shares  shall  be  "legended,"  will  be
restricted  securities as defined in Rule 144 under the  Securities  Act and the
recipient's  resale of the Parent  Common Stock will be governed by, among other
provisions,  SEC Rule 144, this  Agreement and by Parent's  Policy on Securities
Trades by Company Personnel (as applicable),  a copy of which has been furnished
to or has been made available to Shareholders.  A Shareholder shall not sell his
or her  Parent  Common  Stock  without  registration  (as set  forth  herein  or
otherwise)  under the Securities Act and any applicable Blue Sky laws, or unless
an exemption from  registration is available and the Shareholder has provided to
Parent an opinion of counsel  satisfactory to the Parent that such  registration
is not required in connection with any such transaction.

     (d) Share  Transfer  Matters.  The  ability  of the  Shareholders  to sell,
transfer or hypothecate their shares of Parent Common Stock shall be governed by
Federal and State securities laws, this Agreement  (including  Schedule 2.01(d),
which all parties agree to), and Parent's Policy on Securities Trades by Company
Personnel  (as  applicable).  Parent agrees in good faith to use best efforts to
file and to  cause to  become  effective  (at the  times  provided  in  Schedule
2.01(d)) registration statements under the Securities Act registering all Parent
Common  Stock  then held by each of the  Shareholders  for  public  re-sale,  in
accordance with the terms of Schedule 2.01(d) (the "Registration  Rights"). Each
Shareholder  shall  cooperate in all respects  with the  reasonable  requests of
Parent to effect such  registration  and shall comply with the provisions of the
Registration  Rights  applicable to  Shareholders.  Parent shall likewise comply
with the provisions of the Registration Rights applicable to it.

                                  ARTICLE III
                  REPRESENTATIONS AND WARRANTIES OF THE COMPANY
                              AND THE SHAREHOLDERS

     The Company and only those  Shareholders  listed on Schedule 3.02(b) with a
percentage  of  Company  Common  Stock in  excess  of ten  (10%)  percent  ("Key
Shareholders")  hereby  represent and warrant,  as of the date of this Agreement
and as of the  Closing  Date,  as  follows,  each of which  representations  and
warranties shall be deemed to be independently  material and to have been relied
upon by Parent and Acquisition Subsidiary:

SECTION  3.01  Organization;   Good  Standing.  The  Company  and  each  Company
Subsidiary (as defined below) is duly  organized,  validly  existing and in good
standing  under the laws of the State of Michigan,  and Company and each Company
Subsidiary has full power and authority, corporate and other, to own and operate
its property  (including the operation of leased property) and to carry on their
business,  including  the  Business  as it is now being  conducted,  and is duly
qualified  or licensed as a foreign  corporation  to do business  and is in good
standing in each  jurisdiction  in which the character of the property  owned or
the  nature  of the  business  transacted  by it  makes  such  qualification  or
licensing necessary,  except that if the Company is not so qualified in any such
jurisdiction,  it can become  qualified  without any Material Adverse Effect (as
defined  below).   True  and  complete  copies  of  the  Company's  Articles  of
Incorporation and By-laws (including all amendments thereto),  and the formative
documents of each Company  Subsidiary,  have been delivered or made available to
Parent.

SECTION 3.02 Capitalization; Title to Shares.

     (a) The  Company's  authorized  capital  stock  consists  solely  of  fifty
thousand  (50,000)  shares of Company Common Stock.  As of the date hereof,  (i)
nine  thousand five hundred  forty  (9,540)  shares of Company  Common Stock are
issued and outstanding,  and (ii) there are no Company Stock Options (as defined
below) issued and outstanding.  The Company has nine thousand five hundred forty
(9,540)  issued and  outstanding  shares of common  stock  entitled to vote with
respect to the Merger, which common stock is the only class of equity securities
of the Company issued and  outstanding  and entitled to vote with respect to the
Merger.  All  outstanding  shares of  Company  Common  Stock are and will on the
Closing Date be validly issued, fully paid and non-assessable.  The Shareholders

SECTION 3.09 Company Agreements.

     (a)  Except  for  violations,   breaches,  or  defaults  which  would  not,
individually or in the aggregate,  have a Material  Adverse  Effect,  and to the

or in any  geographic  area or to employ or solicit the employment of any person
or requiring the Company to maintain the confidentiality of any information,  or

Shareholders  that is the subject of Section 5.09A,  together with the amount of

SECTION 3.10 Real Property.

     (a) Company has  furnished or made  available to Parent a true and complete
list of all real  property  interests  now owned or ever owned by the Company or
any Company  Subsidiary  (the "Owned Real  Property")  and any  contract for the
purchase or sale of real property to which the Company or any Company Subsidiary
is a party  or is  bound.  The  Company  or a  Company  Subsidiary  has good and
marketable  fee  simple  title  to the  Owned  Real  Property,  subject  only to
Permitted Liens. Each parcel of Owned Real Property and all improvements located
thereon (i) complies in all material respects with all covenants, conditions and
restrictions of record affecting such property,  (ii) is not presently  occupied
or used by any party  other  than its  owner,  and (iii) is not  subject  to any
option to  purchase  or lease,  right of first  refusal  to  purchase  or lease,
reversionary   interest  or  other  instrument  or  Lien,  whether  recorded  or
unrecorded,  which  would  prohibit  or require the consent or waiver of another
party to the transactions contemplated hereby or any subsequent sale or lease of
the  property.  There are no taxes  currently  levied  against  the  Owned  Real
Property which are due and payable and have not been paid. No party has provided
goods or services to or in connection  with the Owned Real  Property  which will
result in any mechanic's, materialmens', supplier's or other Lien as a result of
the wrongful failure to pay for the same prior to Closing.

     (b) Company has  furnished or made  available to Parent a true and complete
list of Company and Company  Subsidiary real property leases (the "Real Property
Leases")  which  constitute  all leases,  subleases or licenses of real property
(the "Leased Real Property" and together with the Owned Real Property, the "Real
Property"),  whether  written  or oral,  to which  the  Company  or any  Company
Subsidiary  is or was a party,  or is or was bound.  The Company or each Company
Subsidiary  has valid and  enforceable  leasehold  interests  in the Leased Real
Property,  free and clear of all Liens (other than Permitted  Liens).  Each Real
Property  Lease  affords  the  Company  or  Company   Subsidiary   peaceful  and
undisturbed  possession  of the Leased Real Property  covered  thereby and there
exists no event of default or event, occurrence, condition or act (including the
transactions  contemplated  by this Agreement) on the part of the Company or, to
the knowledge of the Company,  on the part of the lessor  thereunder which, with
the giving of notice, the lapse of time or the happening of any further event or
condition,  would  become a material  default  under such lease,  give rise to a
right in the lessor to terminate  the lease or change any of the material  terms
thereof or render the lessee liable to incur any  expenditure  under such lease.
The monthly rental rates payable by the Company or Company Subsidiary under each
lease do not exceed the fair market  monthly rental rates charged by lessors for
similarly  situated  properties within the respective real estate market of such
Real Property Lease.

     (c) To the  knowledge of the Company,  the Real  Property and  improvements
thereon  may  lawfully  be used in  connection  with the  Business.  Except  for
violations,  breaches,  or  defaults  which  would not,  individually  or in the
aggregate,  have a Material  Adverse Effect,  the Real Property and improvements
are in compliance with all applicable laws, rules, regulations and ordinances of
all  Governmental  Entities  including,  but not limited to,  zoning,  building,
health,  safety and  Environmental  Laws and the  Company has not  received  any
notices of violations with respect thereto.

SECTION  3.11  Machinery  and  Equipment.  All  machinery,  equipment  and other
tangible  assets,  including,  but not limited to,  computer  equipment,  of the
Company and any Company  Subsidiary  utilized in the operation of their business
including the Business,  and are in good  operating  condition and in a state of
good  repair  sufficient  for the  conduct  of  normal  operations  without  the
necessity  of any known  capital  expenditure  in excess  of One  Hundred  Fifty
Thousand ($150,000) Dollars.  The Company's and Company  Subsidiary's assets and
properties  (including  leased  assets and  properties,  if any) are adequate to
enable the  Company  and each  Company  Subsidiary  to conduct  their  business,
including the  Business,  as now being  conducted.  The Company  and/or  Company
Subsidiaries do not have any commitment or plan to make any capital  expenditure
in excess of Two Hundred Thousand ($200,000) Dollars.

SECTION  3.12  Inventories.  The  inventories  of the Company  and each  Company
Subsidiary  consist of raw  materials,  work in process and finished  goods of a
quality  and  quantity  usable or salable in the  ordinary  course of  business,
except  for any (a) slow  moving  or  obsolete  inventory  or (b)  inventory  of
below-standard quality, all of which inventory is immaterial or has been written
off or written down to realizable  value. The valuation at which the inventories
of the Company are carried on the Unaudited  Financial  Statements  reflects the
normal  inventory  valuation  policy of the Company  (applied in accordance with
GAAP)    which    states    that    inventory    at   the    lower    of    cost
(first-in-first-out-method)   or  market  and  the  Company's   regular  costing
standards with respect to work in process and finished goods inventory.

SECTION 3.13 Accounts  Receivable.  All accounts receivable result from and will
result from bona fide sales made by the Company or a Company  Subsidiary  are in
the  ordinary  course of business  consistent  with past  practice and have been
collected or will be  collectible  in the ordinary  course after  provision  for
doubtful accounts and other reserves required by GAAP.

SECTION 3.14 Intellectual Property Rights.  Except for violations,  breaches, or
defaults  which would not,  individually  or in the  aggregate,  have a Material
Adverse Effect, and to the knowledge of the Company,  (a) the Company owns or is
validly  licensed or otherwise has the right to use, all  Intellectual  Property
Rights  used or held  for use by the  Company  or  Company  Subsidiary,  and all
goodwill  associated  therewith  on or with  respect to the Products in the same
manner in which any such Intellectual  Property Right have been or are now being
used,  (b)  the  Company  or  Company   Subsidiary   has  not  infringed   upon,
misappropriated or otherwise  violated any Intellectual  Property Right or other
proprietary  information of any other person,  (c) there is no claim,  demand or
proceeding  pending or  threatened,  that pertains to or challenges the right of
the Company or Company Subsidiary to use any of the Intellectual Property Rights
(including  any claim that the  Company or Company  Subsidiary  must  license or
refrain  from  using  any  Intellectual  Property  Rights  or other  proprietary
information of any other person),  (d) the Company or Company Subsidiary has not
granted any license or other right and has no obligation to grant any license or
other  right with  respect  thereto,  (e) no other  person has  infringed  upon,
misappropriated  or otherwise  violated any  Intellectual  Property Right of the
Company or Company  Subsidiary,  (f) the  Company or Company  Subsidiary  is the

has not breached any such license, and (i) the Company or Company Subsidiary has
paid all amounts that have heretofore  become due and payable in respect of such

and  software  (other than  over-the-counter  software  available to the general

owned  by the  Company  or  Company  Subsidiary,  free and  clear  of all  Liens
whatsoever  (except  Permitted  Liens) and the  consummation of the transactions
contemplated  by this Agreement will not give rise to any Lien on such assets or
properties.  There  are not and on the  Closing  Date  there  will  not be,  any
outstanding agreements,  options, commitments or rights with, to or in any third
party to acquire or use any of the Company's assets or properties.

or such  Shareholder  pursuant hereto or the right of such  Shareholder to enter
into this Agreement or any such other  documents or instruments or to consummate

would be likely to have a Material  Adverse Effect on the ability of the Company
or such  Shareholder  to perform his or her  respective  obligations  under this
Agreement or any such other documents or  instruments.  To the knowledge of such
Shareholder, there is no fact or facts existing which are reasonably expected to
result in, nor is there any basis for, any such  action,  suit,  arbitration  or
other proceeding or investigation. Such Shareholder is not a party to or subject
to any order,  writ,  injunction,  decree,  judgment or other restriction of any
Governmental  Entity which is reasonably  likely to prevent or materially  delay

arrangement  or  transaction  to  which  the  Company  or any  of the  Company's
Subsidiaries assets or properties are bound.

SECTION  3.07A  Securities  Law  Matters.  Each  Shareholder  acknowledges  that
investment  in the Parent  Common  Stock  involves a high  degree of risk and is
suitable only for sophisticated  investors,  and that they have been informed by
Parent  that the  Parent  Common  Stock is being  offered  in  reliance  upon an
exemption from registration provided by the Securities Act and an exemption from
registration under applicable Blue Sky laws. Shareholder is acquiring the Parent
Common  Stock  for  his  or her  own  investment  and  not  with  a view  to the
distribution  or resale  thereof to anyone else. The Parent has disclosed to the
Shareholder,  that the Parent Common Stock is a restricted security,  as defined
in Rule 144 under the Securities Act,  transferability is limited,  and that the
Shareholder  may be  required  to  continue  to bear the  economic  risk of this
investment  for an  indefinite  period as the Parent  Common  Stock has not been
registered under the Securities Act or any Blue Sky laws and therefore cannot be
offered or sold until  subsequently  registered  under such acts (as provided in
Schedule  2.01(d)  or  otherwise)  or an  exemption  from such  registration  is
available.  Shareholder  is an  "accredited  investor"  within  the  meaning  of
Regulation  D under the  Securities  Act and the Indiana and  Michigan  Blue Sky
Laws, or otherwise has such  knowledge and  experience in financial and business
matters such that Shareholder, either alone or with such Shareholder's purchaser
representative  (who  is the  Shareholder  Representative  for  purposes  of the
transactions  contemplated  in this  Agreement),  is capable of  evaluating  the
merits and risks of an investment in Parent.  Shareholder  has had access to all
public filings with the Securities and Exchange  Commission made by Parent,  and
has received the opportunity to ask questions and receive answers  regarding the
merits and risks of investing in the Parent  Common  Stock.  On the date hereof,
Shareholder  does not own  directly or  beneficially,  either  alone or with any
group (as defined  under  Section 13(d) of the Exchange Act) more than 1% of the
issued and outstanding Parent Common Stock. Each Shareholder agrees to each term
and condition of the Registration Rights in Schedule 2.01(d).

is  now  being  conducted  and  is  duly  qualified  or  licensed  as a  foreign
corporation to do business and is in good standing in each jurisdiction in which
the character of the property owned or the nature of the business  transacted by
it makes  such  qualification  or  licensing  necessary,  except  that if not so
qualified in any such jurisdiction, it can become qualified without any Material
Adverse Effect. True and complete copies of their respective formative documents
(including all amendments  thereto),  as in effect on the date hereof, have been
delivered or made available to Company and Shareholders.

outstanding,  the relative rights of each class of Capital Stock,  the number of
shares of Parent  Common  Stock  reserved  for  issuance  under any Parent Stock

presently  outstanding any security  convertible into or exchangeable for shares
of Capital  Stock of the Parent,  nor has the Parent  entered into any agreement
with  respect  to  any  of the  foregoing.  The  Parent  has  no  obligation  to
repurchase, redeem or otherwise acquire any shares of Capital Stock of, or other
equity or voting interests in the Parent.  There are no irrevocable  proxies and
no voting  agreements  to which the Parent is a party with respect to any shares
of the Capital Stock or other voting securities of the Parent.

     (c) The Merger and the transactions contemplated by this Agreement will not
trigger any rights to the Parent Shareholders (as hereinafter defined) under the
Parent's Rights Agreement.

     (d) The Parent  Common  Stock to be  received  by the  Shareholders  in the
Merger Exchange shall be free and clear of all Liens and the consummation of the
transaction  contemplated  by this  Agreement  will not give  rise to any  Liens
therein.

SECTION 4.03 Subsidiaries. Parent has delivered or made available to Company and
Shareholders  a true and  complete  list of  Parent  subsidiaries  (the  "Parent
Subsidiaries").  Parent  owns of record  and  beneficially  one  hundred  (100%)

any Parent  Subsidiary owns, nor has Parent or any Parent Subsidiary ever owned,
directly or indirectly, any capital stock of or other equity or voting interests
in any other corporation, partnership, limited liability company, joint venture,
association  or other entity,  or  disregarded  entity for purposes of the Code,
domestic or non-domestic.

SECTION  4.04  Authority  Relative  to this  Agreement.  Each of the  Parent and
Acquisition  Subsidiary  has the full legal  right,  power and capacity to enter
into this  Agreement  and the  documents  and  instruments  to be  executed  and
delivered by it pursuant hereto and to perform fully its  obligations  hereunder
and  thereunder.   The  execution,   delivery  and  performance  by  Parent  and
Acquisition  Company of this  Agreement and the documents and  instruments to be
executed and  delivered by it pursuant  hereto have been duly  authorized by all
requisite Board of Directors corporate action and no other corporate proceedings
shall be necessary to approve this Agreement or the documents and instruments to
be  executed  and  delivered  by  it  pursuant  hereto,  or  to  consummate  the
transactions  contemplated  hereby or thereby,  except for  submission to Parent
Shareholders  for approval.  This Agreement and the documents and instruments to

Governmental  Entity,  is necessary for the  consummation  by the Company of the
transactions   contemplated  by  this  Agreement,   provided  further,  however,
consummation by the Company of the  transactions  contemplated by this Agreement
are subject to requirements of Parent's  Articles of  Incorporation  and Bylaws,
and the Exchange Act and the NASDAQ Stock  Market,  as they relate to the Parent
shareholders'  (the  "Parent  Shareholders")  consent,  solicitation  of  Parent
Shareholders proxies, and Parent Shareholders approval of this Agreement;

     (b) Neither the execution  and delivery of this  Agreement or the documents
and  instruments to be executed and delivered  pursuant hereto by the Parent and

constitute  (with or  without  due notice or lapse of time or both) a default or

provided by an agreement  either  written or oral, the terms of which Parent has
disclosed to or made available to Company and  Shareholders,  or made any bonus,

SECTION 4.09 Parent Agreements.

     (a)  Except  for  violations,   breaches,  or  defaults  which  would  not,
individually or in the aggregate,  have a Material  Adverse  Effect,  and to the
knowledge of the Parent,  the Parent is not and to the  knowledge of the Parent,
no other party to any Parent  Agreement  (defined below) is in default under any
Parent  Agreement  (defined  below) that would have a Material  Adverse  Effect.
Parent Agreement is defined as all Parent  contracts,  including but not limited
to, executory agreements (including dealer and distributor agreements), purchase
orders  (other than purchase  commitments  for raw materials and supplies in the
ordinary   course  of  business),   bailment   agreements,   equipment   leases,
commitments,   contracts,  employment  agreements,   repurchase  or  floor  plan
financing   agreements,   warranties,   guarantees,   understandings   or  other
agreements,  whether written, or verbal, which involve or may involve any of the

the Parent (or which,  following  the  Closing,  could  restrict  the ability of
Parent) to compete in any  business  or in any  geographic  area or to employ or
solicit the  employment  of any person or  requiring  the Parent to maintain the
confidentiality  of any  information,  or (e) which  relate to any  indebtedness
(which  term  shall  include  indemnification  obligations,  capital  leases and
operating  leases) of the Parent that is  outstanding  or may be incurred or any
guarantees of or by the Parent of indebtedness of any other person.

SECTION 4.10 Real Property.

     (a) A list of all real  property  interests  now owned or ever owned by the
Parent or any Parent  Subsidiary  (the "Parent Real  Property") and any contract
for the  purchase  or sale of real  property  to which the  Parent or any Parent
Subsidiary  is a party or is bound,  has been  delivered  or made  available  to
Company  and  Shareholders.  The  Parent  or a  Parent  Subsidiary  has good and
marketable  fee  simple  title  to the  Parent  Real  Property  subject  only to
Permitted  Liens.  Each parcel of Parent  Real  Property  and all  improvements,
located  thereon  (i)  complies in all  material  respects  with all  covenants,
conditions and  restrictions  of record  affecting  such  property,  (ii) is not
presently  occupied or used by any party other than its owner,  and (iii) is not
subject to any option to purchase or lease,  right of first  refusal to purchase
or lease, reversionary interest or other instrument or Lien, whether recorded or
unrecorded,  which  would  prohibit  or require the consent or waiver of another
party to the transactions contemplated hereby or any subsequent sale or lease of
the  property.  There are no taxes  currently  levied  against  the Parent  Real
Property which are due and payable and have not been paid. No party has provided
goods or services to or in connection  with the Parent Real Property  which will
result in any mechanic's, materialmens', supplier's or other Lien as a result of
the wrongful failure to pay for the same prior to Closing.

     (b) Parent has delivered or made  available to Company and  Shareholders  a
list of all the real  property  leases  (the  "Parent  Leased  Real  Property"),
subleases or licenses of real  property,  whether  written or oral, to which the
Parent or any Parent Subsidiary is or was a party or is or was bound. The Parent
or Parent Subsidiary has valid and enforceable leasehold interests in the Parent
Leased Real Property free and clear of all Liens (other than  Permitted  Liens).
Each lease  affords the Parent or Parent  Subsidiary  peaceful  and  undisturbed
possession of the Parent Leased Real Property  covered  thereby and there exists
no event of  default  or event,  occurrence,  condition  or act  (including  the
transactions  contemplated  by this  Agreement) on the part of the Parent or, to
the knowledge of the Parent,  on the part of the lessor  thereunder  which, with
the giving of notice, the lapse of time or the happening of any further event or
condition,  would  become a material  default  under  such  Parent  Leased  Real
Property,  give rise to a right in the lessor to  terminate  the lease or change
any of the  material  terms  thereof or render  the  lessee  liable to incur any
expenditure  under such lease.  The monthly  rental rates  payable by the Parent
under each lease do not exceed the fair market  monthly  rental rates charged by
lessors for similarly  situated  properties  within the  respective  real estate
market of such Parent Leased Real Property.

     (c) To the  knowledge  of the Parent,  the Parent Real  Property and Parent
Leased Real Property and improvements thereon may lawfully be used in connection
with the business of the Parent.  Except for violations,  breaches,  or defaults
which  would not,  individually  or in the  aggregate,  have a Material  Adverse
Effect,  the Parent  Real  Property  and Parent  Leased  Real  Property  and all
improvements  thereon  are  in  compliance  with  all  applicable  laws,  rules,
regulations  and  ordinances of all  Governmental  Entities  including,  but not
limited to, zoning,  building,  health,  safety and  Environmental  Laws and the
Parent has not received any notices of violations with respect thereto.

SECTION  4.11  Machinery  and  Equipment.  All  machinery,  equipment  and other
tangible  assets,  including,  but not limited to,  computer  equipment,  of the
Parent or Parent  Subsidiary  utilized in the  operation  of its business are in
good  operating  condition  and in a state  of good  repair  sufficient  for the
conduct  of  normal  operations  without  the  necessity  of any  known  capital
expenditure  in excess of Twenty  Thousand  ($20,000)  Dollars.  The Parent's or
Parent's  Subsidiary's  assets  and  properties  (including  leased  assets  and
properties,  if any) are adequate to enable the Parent or the Parent  Subsidiary
to  conduct  its  business  as now being  conducted.  The Parent  and/or  Parent
Subsidiaries do not have any commitment or plan to make any capital  expenditure
in excess of One Hundred Twenty Thousand ($120,000) Dollars.

SECTION 4.12 Inventories.  The inventories of the Parent and Parent Subsidiaries
consist of raw  materials,  work in process and finished  goods of a quality and
quantity  usable or salable in the ordinary  course of business,  except for any
(a) slow  moving  or  obsolete  inventory  or (b)  inventory  of  below-standard
quality, all of which inventory is immaterial or has been written off or written
down to realizable  value.  The valuation at which the inventories of the Parent
are carried on the Parent  Financial  Statements  reflects the normal  inventory
valuation  policy of the Parent  (applied in accordance  with GAAP) which states
that  inventory at the lower of cost  (first-in-first-out-method)  or market and
the  Parent's  regular  costing  standards  with  respect to work in process and
finished goods inventory.

SECTION 4.13 Accounts Receivable. All accounts receivable of the Parent and each
Parent  Subsidiary  result from and will result from bona fide sales made by the
Parent and each Parent Subsidiary in the ordinary course of business  consistent
with  past  practice  and have  been  collected  or will be  collectible  in the
ordinary  course  after  provision  for  doubtful  accounts  and other  reserves
required by GAAP.

SECTION 4.14 Intellectual Property Rights.  Except for violations,  breaches, or
defaults  which would not,  individually  or in the  aggregate,  have a Material
Adverse  Effect,  and to the  knowledge of the Parent,  (a) the Parent or Parent
Subsidiary  owns or is validly  licensed or otherwise  has the right to use, all
Intellectual  Property  Rights  used or held  for use by the  Parent  or  Parent
Subsidiary and all goodwill associated therewith in the same manner in which any
such Intellectual  Property Right have been or is now being used, (b) the Parent
or Parent  Subsidiary  has not  infringed  upon,  misappropriated  or  otherwise
violated any Intellectual Property Right or other proprietary information of any
other person, (c) there is no claim, demand or proceeding pending or threatened,
that pertains to or challenges  the right of the Parent or Parent  Subsidiary to
use any of the Intellectual Property Rights (including any claim that the Parent
or Parent  Subsidiary  must  license  or  refrain  from  using any  Intellectual
Property Rights or other proprietary  information of any other person),  (d) the
Parent or Parent  Subsidiary  has not granted any license or other right and has
no obligation  to grant any other  license or other right with respect  thereto,
(e) no other person has infringed upon,  misappropriated  or otherwise  violated
any Intellectual Property Right of the Parent or any Parent Subsidiary,  (f) the
Parent or Parent  Subsidiary  is the  licensee  under  fully  paid,  enforceable

and  effect,  (h) the  Parent or Parent  Subsidiary  has not  breached  any such

Governmental  Entity or any other person necessary to enable the Parent and each
Parent  Subsidiary  to carry on its  business  as now  conducted  and to own and
operate its properties  (including  leased  property) as now owned and operated,
except  for  those  licenses  that are  not,  individually  or in the  aggregate

will remain in full force and effect following  consummation of the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement.

SECTION  4.16  Title to Assets.  All of the  Parent's  and Parent  Subsidiaries'
assets and  properties  and all assets and  properties  necessary or required in
connection  with the  operation of its business  will,  on the Closing  Date, be
owned by the Parent or Parent Subsidiary,  as applicable,  free and clear of all
Liens  whatsoever   (except   Permitted  Liens)  and  the  consummation  of  the
transactions  contemplated  by this  Agreement will not give rise to any Lien on
such assets or properties.  There are not and on the Closing Date there will not
be, any outstanding  agreements,  options,  commitments or rights with, to or in
any third party to acquire or use any of the Parent's or Parent's  Subsidiaries'
assets or properties,  as applicable.  SECTION 4.17 Corporate Minute Books; Bank

SECTION 4.18 Taxes.

     (a)  Except  for  violations,   breaches,  or  defaults  which  would  not,

knowledge  of the Parent,  to the extent  that it would have a Material  Adverse

Controlled  Entity") under Section 414(b),  (c), (m) or (o) of the Code, for the
benefit of any current or former directors,  officers,  employees or consultants

               5500  required  to be filed  with the IRS  with  respect  to each

               Plans  are  in  compliance  in all  material  respects  with  all
               applicable  provisions  of  ERISA  and the  Code  and  all  other
               applicable   law.  The  Parent  has  timely  filed  all  required
               documents  and reports,  including  IRS Form 5500,  for each such
               Parent Benefit Plan with all applicable governmental  authorities
               and  has  timely   furnished   all  required   documents  to  the
               participants or  beneficiaries  of each such Parent Benefit Plan.
               No individuals have been improperly  excluded from  participating
               in any Parent Benefit Plan;

          (ii) Neither the Parent nor any  Commonly  Controlled  Entity has ever
               maintained, contributed to or been obligated to contribute to any
               Parent  Benefit  Plan  that is  subject  to  Title IV of ERISA or
               Section 412 of the Code;

          (iii)With  respect  to any  Parent  Benefit  Plan that is an  employee
               welfare benefit plan, there are no understandings,  agreements or
               undertakings,  written or oral,  that would prevent any such plan
               (including  any such  plan  covering  retirees  or  other  former
               employees) from being amended or terminated  without liability to
               the Parent on or at any time after the Effective Time;

          (iv) Each Parent  Benefit  Plan that is an "employee  pension  benefit
               plan"  within the  meaning  of Section  3(2) of ERISA and that is
               intended to be qualified  under Section  401(a) of the Code,  has
               received a favorable  determination letter from the IRS and there
               are not any circumstances which could result in revocation of any

properties,  or  affairs of Parent or Parent  Subsidiaries  shall not affect the
representations  and  warranties  of the  Company  and the  Shareholders  herein
contained at Article III and Article III.A. respectively,  and Parent and Parent
Subsidiary at Article IV. The respective  representations  and warranties of the
parties  herein  contained  shall  survive the Closing for a period of three (3)
years (referred to herein as "General  Representations"),  with the exception of
(i)  representations  and  warranties of the Company and the  Shareholders  with
respect to Section 3.06 ("Financial  Statements"),  Section 3.18 ("Taxes"),  and
Section  3.23  ("Product  Liability")  which  shall  survive the Closing for the
applicable statute of limitations, and the representations and warranties of the
Company and the Key Shareholders in Section 3.27 ("Environmental Matters") which
shall survive Closing  indefinitely,  and (ii) representations and warranties of
each  Shareholder  as set forth in Article  III.A hereof  (referred to herein as
"Personal Representations"),  which shall survive the Closing indefinitely,  and
(iii) the  representations  and  warranties  of Parent set forth in Section 4.06
("Financial  Statements"),  Section 4.18  ("Taxes")  and Section 4.24  ("Product
Liability"),  and  covenants  and  agreements  in  Section  5.09A  ("Release  of
Guarantees")   shall  survive  the  Closing  for  the   applicable   statute  of
limitations,  and (iv) the representations and warranties of Parent set forth in
Section 4.27 ("Environmental Matters") shall survive the Closing indefinitely.

SECTION 8.02  Indemnification by the Shareholders.  The Shareholders  severally,
and  not  jointly,  shall  indemnify,   defend  and  hold  Parent,   Acquisition
Subsidiary,  the Surviving  Company and their  respective  officers,  directors,
employees, agents, subsidiaries and affiliates harmless from and against any and
all liabilities,  losses, damages, claims, fines, penalties, costs and expenses,
including,  without  limitation,   reasonable  attorneys'  and  accounting  fees
(collectively,   "Losses")  incurred  by  Parent,  Acquisition  Subsidiary,  the
Surviving  Company or any of their respective  officers,  directors,  employees,
agents,  subsidiaries  or  affiliates,  arising out of or resulting from (i) any
breach of any representation or warranty made by the Company or the Shareholders
contained  in this  Agreement,  and (ii) the  nonperformance  or  breach  of any
covenant,  agreement  or  obligation  to be  performed  by  the  Company  or the
Shareholders under this Agreement;  provided,  however,  that (x) no Shareholder
shall be required to indemnify  for Losses in excess of the  percentage  of such
Losses equal to the  percentage  of the total Parent  Common Stock issued in the
Merger that is received by such  Shareholder in the Merger Exchange as reflected
on Schedule  3.02(b),  except for Losses  arising out of or  resulting  from the
breach of such  Shareholder's  Personal  Representations,  which shall not be so
limited,  and (y) no  Shareholder  shall be required to indemnify for any Losses
arising out of or resulting from the breach of any other Shareholder's  Personal
Representations,  and (z) Losses  shall be reduced  by any Tax  Benefit  (or net
insurance  proceeds after deducting any costs of collection)  received by Parent
or  the  Surviving  Company  in  connection  with  the  claims  giving  rise  to
indemnification  hereunder. The obligations of the Shareholders pursuant to this
Article  VIII shall be several  among the  Shareholders  as  provided in Section
8.04.  Notwithstanding  the  foregoing,  if any  claim  for  indemnification  is
asserted by Parent and/or the Surviving  Company against the  Shareholders,  and
the Parent  and/or the Surviving  Company is covered by an insurance  policy for
such Losses,  Parent and/or the Surviving  Company shall use their  commercially
reasonable efforts to seek indemnification under the applicable insurance policy
or policies; provided, however, Parent and/or the Surviving Company shall not be
obligated to commence any legal proceedings  against any insurance  provider for
indemnification  hereunder.  Parent and/or the Surviving  Company shall give the
Shareholder Representative notice of their intention to seek indemnification for
such Losses from applicable insurance policies.  In the event that Parent and/or
the Surviving Company are unable to collect sufficient  insurance proceeds to be
fully  indemnified  for their  respective  Losses,  Parent  and/or the Surviving
Company  shall be entitled to receive  indemnification  pursuant to this Article
VIII  and  shall,  as  promptly  as  practicable,   assign  to  the  Shareholder
Representative,  without  recourse,  their respective claims for the uncollected
Losses  against the insurance  provider or providers.  Notwithstanding  anything
contained herein to the contrary,  the indemnification rights under this Article
VIII are the sole  remedies  that the  Parent  may seek or  assert  against  the
Shareholders,  and as to  Non-Key  Shareholders  ("Shareholders  Other  Than Key
Shareholders")  such  indemnification  rights  shall be limited to a breach of a
warranty or representation under Article III.A.

     For  purposes of this  Agreement,  "Tax  Benefit"  shall mean (i) an actual
reduction in taxes payable,  (ii) an actual refund of taxes  previously paid, or
(iii) the present value of any future refund, future credit, reduction in future
taxes  payable as a result of an increased  net  operating  loss or other future
reduction in an otherwise required tax payment,  including in each such case any
interest paid (or in the case of a future refund,  payable) thereon. The present
value of the amounts  described in clause (iii) of the preceding  sentence shall
be computed  (A) using the tax rate  applicable  to the highest  level of income
with respect to such tax under the applicable tax law on the date prescribed for
payment of the  indemnity  payment  (taking into  account,  if  applicable,  the
character  of the  income  which is  reduced  by the loss or  similar  item) and
assuming  sufficient  income in all  applicable tax periods to use such benefit,
and (B) using as a  discount  rate the  interest  rate on such date  imposed  on
corporate  deficiencies  paid  within  thirty  (30) days of a notice of proposed
deficiency under Section 6621(a) of the Code.

SECTION 8.03 Indemnification by Parent and Acquisition Subsidiary.  Parent, each
Parent Subsidiary,  and Surviving Company shall jointly and severally indemnify,
defend and hold the Shareholders and their respective  affiliates  harmless from
and against  any and all Losses  incurred  by any of the  Shareholders  or their
affiliates arising out of or resulting from (i) any breach of any representation
or warranty made by Parent or Acquisition Subsidiary contained in this Agreement
or in a Parent Disclosure Schedule, and (ii) the nonperformance or breach of any
covenant,  agreement or  obligation  to be  performed  by Parent or  Acquisition
Subsidiary under this Agreement;  provided,  however, Losses shall be reduced by
any Tax  Benefit  (or net  insurance  proceeds  after  deducting  any  costs  of
collection)  received by  Shareholders in connection with the claims giving rise
to indemnification  hereunder.  Notwithstanding anything contained herein to the
contrary,  the  indemnification  rights  under  this  Article  VIII are the sole
remedies  that the  Company  and  Shareholders  may seek or assert  against  the
Parent, Acquisition Subsidiary, Surviving Company or any Parent Subsidiary.

SECTION 8.04 Limitation on Indemnification. Neither the Shareholders pursuant to
Section  8.02  nor  Parent,  Acquisition  Subsidiary  or the  Surviving  Company
pursuant to Section 8.03 shall be obligated to indemnify  the other  against any
Losses until Parent,  Acquisition  Subsidiary and the Surviving Company,  on one
hand, or the Shareholders,  on the other hand, have incurred aggregate Losses in
excess  of the  standard  of  Material  Adverse  Effect  as  applicable  in this
Agreement and as defined in Section 12.17 and One Million  ($1,000,000)  Dollars
(the  "Basket"),  except that the Basket shall not be  applicable  to claims for
indemnification for breaches of the Shareholders  representations  under Section
3.02A, or the Parent's  representations under Section 4.02 and Section 5.09A, in
which case the other  party  shall be entitled to receive the full amount of its
Losses. At such time as the aggregate Losses (including Losses arising out of or
resulting  from  Section  3.02A,  Section  4.02 and Section  5.09A)  incurred by
Parent,  Acquisition Subsidiary or the Surviving Company, on one hand, or Losses
incurred by the Shareholders,  on the other hand, shall exceed the Basket,  then
such party  shall be  entitled  to receive the amount of its Losses in excess of
the Basket.

SECTION 8.05 Indemnification Procedures.

     (a) If Parent,  Acquisition Subsidiary or the Surviving Company, on the one
hand, or the Shareholders, on the other hand (the "Indemnitee"), asserts a claim
for indemnity against the other party, (the "Indemnitor"),  the Indemnitee shall
provide the Indemnitor with written notice of such claim,  stating the amount of
the Losses,  if known and method of  computation  thereof,  all with  reasonable
particularity  and including  documentary  proof,  if available and containing a
reference to the  provisions of this Agreement in respect of which such right of
indemnification  is claimed or arises;  provided,  however,  that  failure to so
notify the Indemnitor  shall not relieve the Indemnitor from any liability which
it may have on account of the claim,  except to the extent the Indemnitor  shall
have been prejudiced by such failure. Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement
to the  contrary,  if the parties are unable to resolve the claim  within  sixty
(60) days, the parties agree to submit to mediation pursuant to Indiana ADR Rule
2.7.

     (b) If an  Indemnitee  shall  receive  notice  of any  claim or  proceeding
initiated by a third party which is or may be subject to indemnification  (each,
a "Third Party  Claim"),  the  Indemnitee  shall  promptly  give the  Indemnitor
written notice of such Third Party Claim; provided,  however, that failure to so
notify the Indemnitor  shall not relieve the Indemnitor from any liability which
it may have on  account  of the Third  Party  Claim,  except to the  extent  the
Indemnitor  shall  have  been  prejudiced  by such  failure.  In such  event the
Indemnitee  shall permit the  Indemnitor,  at its option,  to participate in the
defense  of such Third  Party  Claim by counsel of its own choice and at its own
expense. If, however,  the Indemnitor  acknowledges in writing its obligation to
indemnify the Indemnitee  hereunder against all Losses that may result from such
Third Party Claim and the Indemnitee is reasonably satisfied that the Indemnitor
has sufficient funds available to pay any Losses resulting from such Third Party
Claim,  then the  Indemnitor  shall be  entitled,  at its option,  to assume and
control  the  defense  of such claim by counsel of its own choice and at its own
expense,  provided  that the  Indemnitor  and its  counsel  shall  proceed  with
diligence and good faith with respect  thereto.  Notwithstanding  the foregoing,
the  Indemnitee  shall  have the right to employ  separate  counsel in any Third
Party Claim and the fees and expenses of such counsel shall be at the expense of
such  Indemnitor if (i) the Indemnitor has failed to promptly assume the defense
and employ  counsel or (ii) the named  parties  to any such  Third  Party  Claim
(including any impleaded parties) include such Indemnitee and any Indemnitor and
such Indemnitee  shall have been advised by its counsel that there is a conflict
of interest  between the  Indemnitor  and such  Indemnitee  with respect to such
Third Party Claim or with respect to any legal  defense  which may be available;
provided,  however,  that the Indemnitor  shall not in such event be responsible
hereunder for the fees and expenses of more than one firm of separate counsel in
connection with any claim or proceeding.

     (c) In the event  the  Indemnitor  exercises  its  right to  undertake  the
defense of any Third  Party  Claim,  the  Indemnitee  shall  cooperate  with the
Indemnitor  in such  defense and make  available  to the  Indemnitor  witnesses,
pertinent  records,  materials and  information  in its  possession or under its
control  relating  thereto  as  are  reasonably  requested  by  the  Indemnitor.
Similarly,  in the event the Indemnitee is,  directly or indirectly,  conducting
the defense against any Third Party Claim,  the Indemnitor  shall cooperate with
the Indemnitee in such defense and make  available to the Indemnitee  witnesses,
pertinent  records,  materials and  information  in its  possession or under its
control relating thereto as are reasonably requested by the Indemnitee. No Third
Party Claim may be settled by the Indemnitor  without the written consent of the
Indemnitee,  which  consent  shall  not be  unreasonably  withheld  or  delayed;
provided, however, that the Indemnitor may settle such Third Party Claim without
the  consent  of the  Indemnitee  so  long as the  settlement  (x)  includes  an
unconditional  release  of the  Indemnitee,  in form  and  substance  reasonably
satisfactory  to the  Indemnitee,  from the third party  claimant,  (y) does not
impose any  liabilities or obligations on the Indemnitee and (z) with respect to
any  non-monetary  provision  of any  settlement  of a claim  in  which  Parent,
Acquisition  Subsidiary or the  Surviving  Company is the  Indemnitee,  does not
impose  conditions  upon the Indemnitee  which, in the  Indemnitee's  good faith
judgment,  could have a material  adverse  effect on the  business,  operations,
assets, properties or prospects of the Indemnitee. No Third Party Claim which is
being  defended  in good  faith  by the  Indemnitee  alone or  jointly  with the
Indemnitor,  shall be settled by the Indemnitee  without the written  consent of
the  Indemnitor,  which consent shall not be  unreasonably  withheld;  provided,
however,  that the  Indemnitee  may settle such claim without the consent of the
Indemnitor so long as the  settlement (x) includes an  unconditional  release of
the Indemnitor, in form and substance reasonably satisfactory to the Indemnitor,
from the claim by the  Indemnitee  and the third party claimant and (y) does not
impose any liabilities or obligations on the Indemnitor.

                                   ARTICLE IX
                            TERMINATION OF AGREEMENT


SECTION 9.01 Events of  Termination.  This Agreement shall be terminated and the
transactions  contemplated  hereby  abandoned,  at any time prior to the Closing
Date:

     (a) by the mutual consent of Parent and the Shareholder Representative;

     (b) by either Parent or Acquisition Subsidiary, if there is a breach of any
Company or Shareholder representation, warranty, covenant or agreement contained
in this Agreement which is likely to have a Material Adverse Effect;

     (c) by the Shareholder  Representative,  if there is a breach of any Parent
representation,  warranty,  covenant or agreement  contained  in this  Agreement
which is likely to have a Material Adverse Effect;

     (d) by either  Parent or  Acquisition  Subsidiary,  on the one hand, or the
Shareholder  Representative,  on the other hand, if the Closing has not occurred
on or prior to the Closing Date (as same may be  extended);  provided,  however,
that if the Closing  has not  occurred as a result of the breach by any party of
its  representations,  warranties,  covenants  or  agreements  contained in this
Agreement,  then the party  responsible for such breach shall not have the right
to terminate this Agreement pursuant to this clause (d); or

     (e) by either  Parent or  Acquisition  Subsidiary,  on the one hand, or the
Shareholder  Representative,  on the other hand, if any of the  following  shall
occur:  (i) any  suspension or limitation of trading in securities  generally on
any  national  securities  exchange  (such as  NASDAQ)  lasting  for  more  than
twenty-four (24) hours or (ii) any banking  moratorium  declared by U.S. Federal
or New York authorities.

SECTION 9.02 Effect of  Termination.  In the event that either party shall elect
to terminate this Agreement pursuant to any provision contained herein expressly
giving such party the right to terminate this  Agreement,  this Agreement  shall
forthwith  terminate and have no further effect and neither party shall have any
further  obligation or liability (except with respect to those provisions hereof
which expressly survive any termination of this Agreement).  Notwithstanding the
foregoing,  the termination of this Agreement  pursuant to any provision  hereof
shall not relieve any party of any liability for a breach of any  representation
or warranty or the  nonperformance  of any covenant or obligation  hereunder and
any such termination  shall not be deemed to be a waiver of any available remedy
for any such breach or nonperformance.

                                   ARTICLE X
                                  FINDER'S FEES

     The Company and the Shareholders,  on the one hand and Parent, on the other
hand,  represent  and warrant to each other that they  respectively  have had no
dealings with any finder,  broker,  financial  advisor or  investment  banker in
connection with the  transactions  contemplated  by this Agreement,  except that
Parent has engaged  Starshak  Welnhofer & Co. to  evaluate  the  fairness of the
merger to the Parent and its  shareholders.  The Shareholders will indemnify and
hold Parent harmless from and against any and all liabilities (including but not
limited  to  reasonable  attorneys'  fees)  to which  it or the  Company  may be
subjected by reason of any  compensation  or amounts due or to become due to any
finder's, broker's,  financial advisor's,  investment banker's or similar fee or
commission  with respect to the  transactions  contemplated by this Agreement to
the extent such fee is attributable to any action undertaken by the Shareholders
or the Company.  Parent and Acquisition  Subsidiary  shall jointly and severally
indemnify  and hold the  Shareholders  harmless  from  and  against  any and all
liabilities  (including but not limited to reasonable  attorneys' fees) to which
any of them may be  subjected  by reason of any  finder's,  broker's,  financial
advisor's,  investment banker's or similar fee or commission with respect to the
transactions   contemplated  by  this  Agreement  to  the  extent  such  fee  is
attributable to any action undertaken by Parent or Acquisition  Subsidiary.  The
provisions of this Article X shall survive any termination of this Agreement.

                                   ARTICLE XI

                                  MISCELLANEOUS

SECTION  12.01  Expenses.  Irrespective  of whether the Closing is effected  and
except as otherwise expressly provided herein, Parent and Acquisition Subsidiary
shall pay all costs and expenses that they incur, and, the Company shall pay all
costs  and  expenses  that  the  Company  and   Shareholders   (if  any)  incur,
respectively,  including,  but not  limited  to,  legal,  accounting,  financial
advisory  and  investment  banking  fees  and  expenses,  with  respect  to  the
negotiation  and  execution  of  this  Agreement  and  any  other  documents  or
instruments to be executed and delivered  pursuant hereto and the performance of
any covenants to be performed by such party and  satisfaction  of any conditions
to be  satisfied  by such  party  which are  contained  herein or  therein.  The
provisions  of  this  Section  12.01  shall  survive  any  termination  of  this
Agreement.

SECTION  12.02  Entire  Agreement.  This  Agreement,  together  with the Company
Disclosure  Schedules and Parent  Disclosure  Schedules and Schedules hereto and
the documents and  instruments  to be executed and  delivered  pursuant  hereto,
constitute  the entire  understanding  and  agreement  by and among the  parties
hereto  with  respect to the  subject  matter  hereof and  supersedes  all prior
negotiations,  agreements and understandings  among such parties with respect to
the subject matter hereof.

SECTION 12.03 Amendments and Waivers.  Any term of this Agreement may be amended
and the observance of any term of this Agreement may be waived (either generally
or in a particular instance and either retroactively or prospectively),  only by
an instrument in writing and signed by the party against whom such  amendment or
waiver is sought to be enforced;  provided,  however, that any such amendment or
waiver signed by the Shareholder  Representative  shall be binding on all of the
Shareholders  as provided in Section 12.15.  The waiver by any party hereto of a
breach of any provision of this Agreement shall not operate or be construed as a
further  or  continuing  waiver  of such  breach  or as a waiver of any other or
subsequent  breach.  No failure on the part of any party hereto, to exercise and
no delay in exercising,  any right, power or remedy hereunder shall operate as a
waiver thereof, nor shall any single or partial exercise of such right, power or
remedy by any party hereto,  preclude any other or further  exercise  thereof or
the exercise of any other right, power or remedy.

SECTION  12.04  Successors  and Assigns.  Neither this  Agreement nor any rights
hereunder may be assigned by any party without the prior written  consent of the
other parties  hereto.  This Agreement  shall be binding upon and shall inure to
the benefit of the parties hereto and their respective  successors and permitted
assigns.

SECTION 12.05 Governing Law. This  Agreement,  including the validity hereof and
the rights and  obligations  of the parties  hereunder  and all  amendments  and
supplements hereof and all waivers and consents hereunder, shall be construed in

Indiana without giving effect to any choice of law or conflicts of law provision
or rule that would cause the application of the domestic substantive laws of any
other jurisdiction.

SECTION 12.06  Severability.  If any provision of this Agreement,  as applied to
any part or to any  circumstance,  shall be adjudged by a court to be invalid or
unenforceable,  the same  shall in no way  affect  any other  provision  of this
Agreement,  the application of such provision in any other  circumstances or the
validity or enforceability of this Agreement.

SECTION 12.07 No Third-Party Beneficiaries.  Nothing in this Agreement,  express
or implied, shall create or confer on any person other than the parties or their
respective successors and permitted assigns, any rights,  remedies,  obligations
or liabilities, except as expressly provided herein.

SECTION 12.08 Attorneys' Fees. If any action at law or in equity is necessary to
enforce  or  interpret  the terms of this  Agreement  or any other  document  or
instrument to be executed or delivered  pursuant  hereto,  the prevailing  party
shall be entitled to reasonable  attorneys'  fees,  costs and  disbursements  in
addition to any other relief to which such party may be entitled.

SECTION  12.09  Remedies.  In  case  any one or  more  of the  covenants  and/or
agreements  set forth in this  Agreement  shall have been  breached by any party
hereto,  the party or  parties  entitled  to the  benefit of such  covenants  or
agreements may, except as may otherwise be expressly provided in this Agreement,
proceed to protect and enforce  their rights  either by suit in equity and/or by
action at law, including,  but not limited to, an action for damages as a result
of any such  breach  and/or  an  action  for  specific  performance  of any such
covenant or  agreement  contained  in this  Agreement.  The  rights,  powers and
remedies of the parties under this Agreement are cumulative and not exclusive of
any other  right,  power or remedy  which such  parties may have under any other
agreement or law. No single or partial assertion or exercise of any right, power
or remedy of a party hereunder shall preclude any other or further  assertion or
exercise  thereof.  From and after the Closing Date, the provision  contained in
Article VIII herein shall be the sole and exclusive  remedy for monetary damages
arising out of or resulting from the breach of any representations or warranties
made pursuant to Articles III,  III.A or IV of this  Agreement,  absent fraud or
intentional misrepresentations.

SECTION 12.10  Captions.  The headings and captions  used in this  Agreement are
used  for  convenience  only  and  are not to be  considered  in  construing  or
interpreting this Agreement.

SECTION  12.11  Counterparts.  This  Agreement  may be executed by  facsimile or
counterparts,  each of which shall be deemed an original, but all of which taken
together shall constitute one and the same instrument.

SECTION 12.12 Certain References.  Whenever the context may require, any pronoun
used in this Agreement shall include the  corresponding  masculine,  feminine or
neuter forms and the singular  form of nouns,  pronouns and verbs shall  include
the plural and vice  versa.  The terms  "herein",  "hereof"  or  "hereunder"  or
similar terms as used in this Agreement  refer to this entire  Agreement and not
to the particular  provision in which the term is used. Unless otherwise stated,
all references herein to Articles, Sections, subsections or other provisions are

Agreement. All references to the term "business day" shall mean any day on which

SECTION 12.13  Interpretation.  This Agreement shall be construed  reasonably to
carry out its intent without presumption against or in favor of either party.

SECTION 12.14 Consent to Jurisdiction and Service of Process.  Each Shareholder,

Shareholder.  Each Shareholder  further  designates and appoints the Shareholder
Representative  as its agent for service of process with respect to any disputes
regarding  or arising  out of this  Agreement  or any  transaction  contemplated
hereby.  Any Shareholder  other than  Shareholder  Representative  who is not an

taken in good faith. Each Shareholder hereby authorizes the other parties hereto

                               REGISTRATION RIGHTS


     Share  Transfer  Matters.  Except for the permitted  transfers of shares of
Merger  Stock  provided in this  Schedule  2.01(d),  without  the prior  written
consent of the Parent (to be provided by an executive  officer who is not one of
the Shareholders),  the Shareholders shall not transfer any additional shares of
Merger Stock prior to the second anniversary of the Closing.

     Shelf Registrations. Following the Closing Date, Parent shall in good faith
use its best  efforts to prepare  and file two "shelf"  registration  statements
with respect to all shares of Parent Common Stock issued to the  Shareholders in
connection with the Merger Exchange (the "Merger Stock") on an appropriate  form
for a re-sale  offering  of all of the Merger  Stock to be made on a  continuous
basis  pursuant to Rule 415 under the  Securities  Act (the "Shelf  Registration
Statements"), as provided herein.

     Prior to the second  anniversary date of the Closing,  the Shareholders may
sell,  through  registration as set forth in this Schedule or otherwise pursuant
to SEC Rule 144, in the  aggregate a maximum  total of 800,944  shares of Merger
Stock, consisting of 200,944 total shares by the three (3) minority Shareholders
and 200,000 shares each for the three (3) principal Shareholders.

     The  first  Shelf  Registration   Statement  ("Initial  Shelf  Registration
Statement")  shall allow for the  registration for public resale by Shareholders
of an  aggregate  of 800,944  shares of the Merger Stock issued in the Merger in
the following amounts:

     By the three (3) minority  Shareholders:  200,944  shares of Parent  Common
Stock.

     By each of the other three principal Shareholders: 200,000 shares of Parent
Common Stock (600,000 shares total).

     The Initial Shelf Registration  Statement shall provide for the public sale
by the  Shareholders,  in their  discretion,  either in the public  market or in
negotiated   transactions  from  time  to  time;  provided  that  the  principal
Shareholders  shall remain restricted from Selling more than 100,000 shares each
without the consent of the Parent prior to the first anniversary of Closing.  If
otherwise  approved in Parent's  discretion,  the Initial Shelf Registration may
include the registration for public resale of shares held by any other director,
officer or affiliate of Parent or their  associates.  Parent shall in good faith
use its best  efforts to cause the Initial  Shelf  Registration  Statement to be
declared  effective on or before March 31, 2004.  Parent shall in good faith use
its best efforts to keep such Initial Shelf Registration  Statement continuously
effective  for a period from the date such  registration  is initially  declared
effective through the second  anniversary of the Closing Date. The Initial Shelf
Registration shall additionally  provide for the Shareholders to make resales of
the Merger Stock under SEC Rule 144, subject to the limitations on the amount of
shares resold as set forth in this paragraph.

     The second Shelf  Registration  Statement  ("Secondary  Shelf  Registration
Statement")  shall  allow for the  registration  for public  resale by the three
principal Shareholders of the remaining balance of such principal  Shareholders'
shares of Merger Stock and not otherwise transferred prior to the effective date
of the Secondary Shelf Registration Statement.

     The Secondary  Shelf  Registration  Statement  shall provide for the public
sale by the  selling  Shareholders,  in their  discretion,  either in the public
market or in negotiated transactions from time to time. If otherwise approved in
Parent's   discretion,   the  Secondary  Shelf   Registration  may  include  the
registration for public resale of shares held by any other director,  officer or
affiliate of Parent or their associates. Parent shall in good faith use its best
efforts to cause the  Secondary  Shelf  Registration  Statement  to be  declared
effective by the second  anniversary  of the Closing Date.  Parent shall in good
faith use its best efforts to keep such Secondary Shelf  Registration  Statement
continuously effective for a period of no less than two (2) years. The Secondary
Shelf  Registration  shall  additionally  provide for the  Shareholders  to make
resales of the Merger Stock under SEC Rule 144.

     Registration   Procedures.   In  connection  with  the  Shelf  Registration
Statements,  Parent shall prepare and file with the SEC registration  statements
on such  form(s) as counsel for Parent deems  appropriate  and which shall allow
for the shelf registrations for public resale and valid sale by the Shareholders
of all Merger  Stock  owned by such  Shareholders.  Upon  written  request  from
Parent,  each Shareholder shall promptly (within 10 business days) inform Parent
of the number of shares held by such Shareholder for which such Shareholder does
not desire  registration  to be effected.  Absent  response from a  Shareholder,
Parent  shall  assume  that  all  shares  of  Parent  Common  Stock  which  such
Shareholder is entitled to have included under the applicable Shelf Registration
Statement,  shall be so included.  Parent will,  prior to filing a  registration
statement or prospectus or any amendment or supplement  thereto,  furnish to the
Shareholders copies of such registration  statement as proposed to be filed, and
thereafter  furnish to such  Shareholder(s)  such number of conformed  copies of
such registration statement, each amendment and supplement thereto (in each case
including all exhibits thereto and documents incorporated by reference therein),
the  prospectus  included  in  such  registration   statement   (including  each
preliminary  prospectus),  and such other documents as such  Shareholder(s)  may
reasonably  request,  in order to facilitate the disposition of the Merger Stock
owned by such  Shareholder(s).  After the filing of the registration  statement,
Parent  will  promptly  notify  each  Shareholder  of any stop  order  issued or
threatened by the SEC and take all  reasonable  actions  required to prevent the
entry of such stop order or to remove it if  entered.  Parent  will  immediately
notify  each  Shareholder  at any time when a  prospectus  relating  thereto  is
required to be delivered under the Securities Act, of the occurrence of an event
requiring the  preparation  of a supplement  or amendment to such  prospectus so
that, as  thereafter  delivered to the  purchasers  of such Merger  Stock,  such
prospectus  will not contain an untrue  statement of a material  fact or omit to
state any material fact  required to be stated  therein or necessary to make the
statements  therein,  in light of the circumstances  under which they were made,
not  misleading,  and  promptly  make  available  to each  Shareholder  any such
supplement or amendment.

     Shareholder Information.  Parent in good faith may require each Shareholder
to reasonably  promptly furnish in writing to Parent such information  regarding
such selling  Shareholder,  the Merger Stock held by him or her and the intended
method of  distribution  of the  Merger  Stock as  Parent  may from time to time
reasonably  request  and such other  information  as may be legally  required in
connection with such registration.

     Supplemental  or Amended  Prospectus.  Each  Shareholder  agrees that, upon
receipt  of any  notice  from  Parent  of a desire  to  supplement  or amend the
prospectus,  such Shareholder will forthwith  discontinue  disposition of Merger
Stock pursuant to the  registration  statement  covering such Merger Stock until
such Shareholder's receipt of the copies of a supplemented or amended prospectus
(which Parent shall  undertake to prepare,  file and provide to  Shareholders as
promptly as practicable)  and, if so directed by Parent,  such  Shareholder will
deliver to Parent all copies of the most recent prospectus  covering such Merger
Stock at the time of receipt of such  notice.  Each  Shareholder  agrees that it
will  immediately  notify  Parent at any time when a prospectus  relating to the
registration  of such  Merger  Stock  is  required  to be  delivered  under  the
Securities  Act of the  happening  of an  event of which  such  Shareholder  has
knowledge  as a  result  of  which  information  previously  furnished  by  such
Shareholder  to Parent in writing for inclusion in such  prospectus  contains an
untrue statement of a material fact or omits to state any material fact required
to be stated therein or necessary to make the statements  therein not misleading
in light of the circumstances in which they were made.

     Registration  Expenses.  In  connection  with  any  registration  statement
required to be filed  hereunder,  Parent shall pay Parent's legal and accounting
fees and expenses  incurred in connection  with the  registration  hereunder not
attributable to Shareholders'  conduct inconsistent with this Agreement.  Unless
otherwise  agreed  by  Parent  and  Shareholders,  Shareholders  shall  pay  any
registration  or  filing  fees,  underwriting  fees,  discounts  or  commissions
attributable to the sale of Merger Stock, or any  out-of-pocket  expenses of any
Shareholder (including Shareholder's legal and accounting fees and expenses) not
attributable  to  Parent's  conduct  inconsistent  with this  Agreement,  or any
transfer taxes relating to the sale of the Merger Stock.

     Indemnification  by Parent.  Parent  agrees to  indemnify,  defend and hold
harmless each Shareholder,  their agents and affiliates from and against any and
all Losses caused by any untrue  statement of a material  fact  contained in any
registration statement or prospectus relating to the Merger Stock (as amended or
supplemented)  or any  preliminary  prospectus,  or  caused by any  omission  or
alleged  omission to state therein a material fact required to be stated therein
or necessary to make the statements therein, in light of the circumstances under
which they were made, not  misleading,  except insofar as such Losses are caused
by any such untrue  statement or omission  based upon  information  furnished in
writing to Parent by any Shareholder or on any Shareholder's  behalf relating to
such Shareholder for inclusion therein.

     Indemnification by Shareholders.  Each Shareholder shall indemnify and hold
harmless Parent, its officers,  directors,  employees,  agents, subsidiaries and
affiliates from and against any and all Losses caused by any untrue statement of
a material fact contained in any registration  statement or prospectus  relating
to the Merger Stock (as amended or supplemented) or any preliminary  prospectus,
or caused by any omission or alleged  omission to state  therein a material fact
required to be stated  therein or necessary to make the statements  therein,  in
light of the circumstances under which they were made, not misleading,  but only
with respect to information relating to such Shareholder furnished in writing by
such  Shareholder or on such  Shareholder's  behalf relating to such Shareholder
for use in any  registration  statement  or  prospectus  relating  to the Merger
Stock, or any amendment or supplement thereto, or any preliminary prospectus.

     Indemnification Proceedings. Article VIII of the Agreement shall govern the
indemnification procedures hereunder.

     Rule 144. Each  Shareholder  covenants that he or she will file any reports
required to be filed by Shareholder  under the Securities Act and the Securities
Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the "Exchange  Act"),  to the extent  required
from  time to  time  in  connection  with  any  sale  of  Merger  Stock  without
registration  under  the  Securities  Act  pursuant  to (a) Rule 144  under  the
Securities  Act,  as such  Rule may be  amended  from  time to time,  or (b) any
similar rule or regulation adopted by the SEC.

     Demand   Registration   Rights.   To  the  extent  any  of  the   principal
Shareholders'  employment  with Parent  shall be  terminated  by Parent  without
cause, as such term is defined in the applicable Employment  Agreements,  before
the date the Secondary Shelf  Registration  Statement  becomes  effective,  such
terminated  Shareholder may immediately  require Parent to accelerate the filing
of the Secondary Shelf Registration  Statement and to in good faith use its best
efforts  to cause the  Secondary  Shelf  Registration  Statement,  at least with
respect to the terminated  Shareholder's  shares,  to become effective on a date
identified  by the  Shareholder  (not earlier than the date which is ninety (90)
days after the Shareholder's termination date) and remain effective continuously
thereafter  for a period  of at least  two (2)  years.  The  provisions  of this
paragraph  shall be  included  in the  Employment  Agreements  of the  principal
Shareholders.

     Restrictions on Public Sale by Shareholders. To the extent not inconsistent
with  applicable  law, each  Shareholder  whose  securities  are included in the
Initial and Secondary  Shelf  Registration  Statements  agrees not to effect any
sale or  distribution  of the Merger Stock being  registered,  or any securities
convertible into or exchangeable or exercisable for such securities, including a
sale pursuant to Rule 144 under the Securities Act, during the 14 days prior to,
and during the 90-day period  beginning on, the effective date of a registration
statement (except the Initial and Secondary Shelf Registration  Statements),  if
and to the extent requested in writing by Parent in good faith.

     Material  Disclosure.  If Parent determines in its good faith judgment that
the filing of the Initial or Secondary Shelf Registration  Statements or the use
of any related  prospectus would require the disclosure of material  information
that Parent has a bona fide business  purpose for preserving as  confidential or
the  disclosure  of which would  significantly  impede the  Parent's  ability to
consummate a  significant  transaction,  and that Parent is not  otherwise  then
required by applicable securities laws or regulations to disclose,  upon written
notice of such determination by Parent, the rights of the Shareholders to offer,
sell or distribute any Merger Stock  pursuant to the Initial or Secondary  Shelf
Registration  Statements  or to require  Parent to take any public  action  with
respect to the  registration  of any Merger  Stock  pursuant  to the  Initial or
Secondary Shelf Registration Statements shall be suspended (without liability or
penalty to Parent)  until the date,  determined  by Parent in good  faith,  that
suspension of such rights is no longer necessary.

     No Report Filing. If all reports required to be filed by Parent pursuant to
the Exchange Act have not been filed by the required date, despite Parent's best
efforts to do so, without regard to any extension, or if the consummation of any
business  combination by Parent has occurred or is probable for purposes of Rule
3-05 or Article 11 of Regulation S-X under the Exchange Act, upon written notice
thereof by Parent to the Shareholders,  the rights of the Shareholders to offer,
sell or distribute any Merger Stock  pursuant to the Initial or Secondary  Shelf
Registration  Statements or to require Parent to take action with respect to the
registration  of any Merger  Stock  pursuant to the Initial or  Secondary  Shelf
Registration  Statements  shall be  suspended  (without  liability or penalty to
Parent) until the date on which Parent has, exercising diligence and good faith,
filed such reports or obtained and filed the financial  information  required by
Rule 3-05 or Article 11 of  Regulation  S-X to be  included or  incorporated  by
reference,  as  applicable,  in the  Initial  or  Secondary  Shelf  Registration
Statements,  and Parent shall in good faith notify the  Shareholders as promptly
as practicable when such suspension is no longer required.
