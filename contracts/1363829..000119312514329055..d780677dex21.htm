standing under the laws of the jurisdiction of its incorporation. Each of
Target and its Subsidiaries is duly authorized, licensed and qualified to
conduct business and is in good standing under the laws of each jurisdiction
where such authorization, license and qualification is required, except where
the lack of such authorization, license or qualification would not and would
not reasonably be expected to have a Material Adverse Effect. Each of Target

Subsidiaries will have good, valid and marketable title to, or a
valid leasehold interest in, the material tangible assets it uses regularly
in the conduct of its businesses, free and clear of all Liens. Such assets, in
conjunction with the Transition Services Agreement, are sufficient for the
continued conduct immediately after the Closing by Buyer of the business of
Target and its Subsidiaries in substantially the same manner as conducted
immediately prior to Closing.

Subsidiary of Target (i) its name and jurisdiction of incorporation, (ii) the

stock, (iii) the number of issued and outstanding shares of each class of its
capital stock, the names of the holders thereof, and the number of shares
held by each such holder, (iv) the number of shares of its capital stock held

duly authorized and are validly issued, fully paid, and nonassessable. Target
or a Subsidiary of Target holds of record and owns beneficially all of the
outstanding shares of capital stock of each Subsidiary of Target, free and
clear of all Liens. All of the shares of capital stock of each Subsidiary of
Target were issued in compliance with applicable Laws. None of such shares
were issued in violation of any agreement, arrangement or commitment to which
Seller, Target or any Subsidiary of Target is a party or is otherwise bound or
in violation of any preemptive or similar rights of any Person. There are no
outstanding or authorized options, warrants, purchase rights, subscription
rights, conversion rights, exchange rights, or other contracts or commitments
that could require Seller, Target or any Subsidiary of Target to issue, sell,
or otherwise cause to become outstanding any capital stock of any Subsidiary
of Target. There are no outstanding or authorized stock appreciation, phantom
stock, profit participation, or similar rights with respect to any Subsidiary
of Target. Except for the Subsidiaries set forth in §4(f) of the Disclosure
Schedule, neither Target nor any of its Subsidiaries owns or has any right to
acquire, directly or indirectly, any outstanding capital stock of, or other

(g) _Financial Statements_.

 

(i) Attached hereto as _Exhibit B_ are the following financial statements
(collectively the " _Financial Statements_ "): (i) all audited balance sheets
and statements of income, changes in stockholders equity, and cash flow as of
and for the fiscal years ended December 31, 2011, 2012 and 2013, for Target
and its Subsidiaries; (ii) all statutory annual statements for Target and
each of its Subsidiaries as of and for the years ended December 31, 2011, 2012
and 2013, including the exhibits, schedules, interrogatories, notes,
electronic pages and actuarial opinions thereto, (iii) all consolidating
unaudited balance sheets and statements of income, changes in shareholders
equity, and cash flow as of and for the calendar quarter ended June 30, 2014
(the " _Most Recent Fiscal Quarter End_ ") for Target and each of its
Subsidiaries, and (iv) all unaudited statutory quarterly statements for Target
and each

 



13  of its Subsidiaries as of and for the Most Recent Fiscal Quarter End, in
each case, as applicable, as filed with the Governmental Authority charged
with supervision of insurance or reinsurance companies in Targets or any of
its Subsidiaries jurisdictions of domicile, including each jurisdiction in
which Target or any of its Subsidiaries is deemed to be or is commercially
domiciled (the items in (iii) and (iv) collectively, the " _Most Recent
Financial Statements_ "). Except as set forth on §4(g) of the Disclosure
Schedule, the Financial Statements (including the notes thereto) have been
prepared in accordance with SAP for the insurance company entities and GAAP
for the non-insurance company entities applied on a consistent basis
throughout the periods covered thereby and present fairly the financial
condition of Target and its Subsidiaries as of such dates and the results of
operations of Target and its Subsidiaries for such periods; _provided,
however_ , that the Most Recent Financial Statements are subject to normal
year-end adjustments and lack footnotes as permitted by SAP and GAAP, as
applicable (the effect of which will not be materially adverse). The
Financial Statements required to be filed with any Governmental Authority were
timely filed, except where extensions were granted, and complied in all
material respects with all applicable Laws when filed, and, to the Knowledge
of Seller, no material deficiency has been asserted by a Governmental
Authority that has not been cured or otherwise resolved to the satisfaction of
such Governmental Authority without imposition of any material penalty,
condition or obligation on Target or any of its Subsidiaries. The annual
Financial Statements have been audited by independent auditors. Neither Target
nor any of its Subsidiaries has any material liabilities, obligations or
commitments of any nature whatsoever, asserted or unasserted, known or
unknown, absolute or contingent, accrued or unaccrued, matured or unmatured or
otherwise, except (i) those which are adequately reflected or reserved against
in the balance sheets as of the Most Recent Fiscal Quarter End, and (ii)
those which have been incurred in the Ordinary Course of Business since the
Most Recent Fiscal Quarter End and which are not, individually or in the
aggregate, material in amount. The minute books and stock record books of
Target and each of its Subsidiaries, all of which have been made available to
Buyer, are complete and correct and have been maintained in accordance with
sound business practices. At the Closing, all of such books and records will
be in the possession of Target or the Subsidiaries.

(ii) Each of the Target and its Subsidiaries maintains a standard system of
accounting established and administered in accordance with GAAP or SAP. Each
of Target and its Subsidiaries maintains a system of internal control over
financial reporting sufficient to provide reasonable assurance that: (i)
transactions are executed in accordance with managements general or specific
authorizations; (ii) transactions are recorded as necessary to permit
preparation of the financial statements in conformity with GAAP or SAP, as
applicable, and to maintain asset accountability; (iii) access to assets is
permitted only in accordance with managements general or specific
authorization; and (iv) the recorded accountability for assets is compared
with the existing assets at reasonable intervals and appropriate action is
taken with respect to any differences. Management of each of Target and its
Subsidiaries has disclosed to their respective auditors and audit committees
(if any): (x) any significant deficiencies and material weaknesses in the
design or operation of internal control over financial reporting that are
reasonably likely to adversely affect such companys ability to record,
process, summarize and report financial information and (y) any fraud
that involves management or other employees who have a significant role in
such companys internal control over financial reporting.

 



14 (iii) Notwithstanding the foregoing, Buyer acknowledges it is aware (i) that
Target and its Subsidiaries are currently investigating the value and
liquidity of the collateral assets related to the reinsurance agreements
between Target, on the one hand, and each of Redwood and Freestone, on the
other, that are subject to the collateral asset substitution contemplated by
§5(h) of this Agreement (the " _Collateral Assets_ "), (ii) of the results and
effects of the commutation of the Redwood reinsurance agreement with Target;
and (iii) of the results and effects of the Freestone liquidation
(collectively, " _Financial Statement Exclusions_ "), and none of these items
are reflected in Targets Financial Statements attached as _Exhibit B_. Buyer
hereby agrees that no actions or omissions by Seller, Target or their
Subsidiaries related to the Financial Statement Exclusions or their impact on
the Financial Statements, or exclusion therefrom, could constitute a breach of
any representation or warranty in this §4(g).

 

(h) _Events Subsequent to the Most Recent Fiscal Month End_. Except as set
forth on §4(h) of the Disclosure Schedule, since the Most Recent Fiscal Month
End, there has not been any Material Adverse Change. Without limiting the
generality of the foregoing, since that date (i) none of Target and its
Subsidiaries has engaged in any practice, taken any action, or entered
into any transaction outside the Ordinary Course of Business, and (ii) none
of Seller, Target or any of Targets Subsidiaries has taken any action that if
taken after the Effective Date would have constituted a breach of §5(c),
except to the extent related to item number six on Annex V, provided that any
Material Contracts and Reinsurance Agreements entered into, amended or
terminated since June 30, 2014 are otherwise disclosed in the Disclosure
Schedule and except as set forth on §4(h) of the Disclosure Schedule.

(i) _Permits; Legal Compliance_. Except as set forth on §4(i) of the
Disclosure Schedule, each of Target and its Subsidiaries has and maintains in
good standing and full force and effect all material federal, state,
municipal, local and foreign governmental approvals, authorizations,
certificates of authority, consents, franchises, licenses, qualifications,
accreditations, listing, permits and rights (collectively, " _Permits_ ")
necessary for it to own, lease or operate its properties and assets and to
carry on its business in the manner and in all such jurisdictions as now
conducted. Except as set forth on §4(i) of the Disclosure Schedule, each of
Target and its Subsidiaries is, and since July 1, 2011 has been, in compliance
with all applicable Laws and the terms of the Permits (including rules,
regulations, codes, plans, injunctions, judgments, orders, decrees, rulings,
and charges thereunder) of federal, state, local, and foreign Governmental
Authorities and no revocation, lapse, limitation, suspension or cancellation
of any of the Permits is pending or, to the Knowledge of Seller, threatened.
Except as set forth on §4(i) of the Disclosure Schedule, since July 1, 2011,
none of Seller, Target or any of Targets Subsidiaries has received notice
from any Governmental Authority asserting any actual or alleged violation of,
or material noncompliance with, any applicable Law or Permit.

(j)  _Tax Matters_.

(i) Except as set forth on §4(j) of the Disclosure Schedule, (A) each of
Target and its Subsidiaries has filed all Tax Returns that it was required to
file, and such Tax Returns are true, complete and correct and (B) each of
Target and its Subsidiaries has paid all Taxes due and owing and has complied
with all Tax Laws regarding withholding and information reporting. No claim
has been made by any taxing authority in any jurisdiction where Target or one
of its Subsidiaries does not file Tax Returns that such entity is, or may be,
subject to Tax by that jurisdiction.

 



15 (ii) §4(j) of the Disclosure Schedule lists all Income Tax Returns filed with
respect to Target or any of its Subsidiaries for calendar years 2011 through
2013, indicates which of those Income Tax Returns have been audited, and
indicates which of those Income Tax Returns are currently the subject of
audit. Seller has delivered to Buyer correct and complete copies of all such
federal Income Tax Returns and all examination reports, and statements of
deficiencies assessed against or agreed to by Target or any of Targets
Subsidiaries for such calendar years. All deficiencies asserted, or
assessments made, against Target or any of its Subsidiaries as a result of any
examinations by any taxing authority have been fully paid. Except as noted in
§4(j) of the Disclosure Schedule, there are no pending or threatened audits
or examinations by any taxing authority. There are no Liens for Taxes upon the
assets of Target or any of its Subsidiaries.

(iii) None of Target and its Subsidiaries has waived any statute of
limitations in respect of Taxes or agreed to any extension of time with
respect to a Tax assessment or deficiency. None of Target and its Subsidiaries
is a party to, bound by, or has requested, a closing agreement, offer in
compromise, private letter ruling, or similar agreement or ruling with or by
any taxing authority.

 

(iv) Each of Target and its Subsidiaries is a party to a Tax sharing
agreement, a copy of which has been made available to Buyer (the " _Tax
Sharing Agreement_ "). Neither Target nor any of its Subsidiaries has made any
net payment to Seller or its Affiliates under the Tax Sharing Agreement
between June 30, 2014 and the date of this Agreement. In conjunction with the
Closing, the Tax Sharing Agreement shall be terminated as to Target and its
Subsidiaries as of the Closing Date and they shall have no further rights or
liabilities thereunder after such date.

 

(v) None of Target and its Subsidiaries has been a member of an affiliated,
combined, consolidated or unitary group for Tax purposes (except the group of
which Seller is the parent). None of Target and its Subsidiaries has any
liability for Taxes of any Person as a transferee or successor, by contract,
or otherwise. None of Target and its Subsidiaries is required to, or has taken
any action that could, defer a liability for Taxes of Target or one of its
Subsidiaries from any taxable period (or portion thereof) ending on or before
the Closing Date to any taxable period (or portion thereof) beginning after
the Closing Date.

 

(vi) None of Target and its Subsidiaries is a party to any contract,
agreement, plan or arrangement covering any person that, individually
or collectively, could give rise to the payment of any amount that would not
be deductible by reason of Section 280G of the Code or would constitute
compensation in excess of the limitation set forth in Section 162(m) of the
Code. Each "nonqualified deferred compensation plan" (as defined under
Section 409A(d)(1) of the Code) of Target and its Subsidiaries has been
operated and administered in compliance with Section 409A of the Code and, if
any amendments were reasonably necessary, has been timely amended to comply
with Section 409A of the Code. None of Target and its Subsidiaries is, or has
been, a party to, or a promoter of, a "reportable transaction" within the
meaning of Section 6707A(c)(1) of the Code and Treasury Regulations Section
1.6011-4(b).

 



16 (vii) Except as set forth on §4(j)(i)(5) of the Disclosure Schedule, the
amount of each of Target and its Subsidiaries liability for Taxes for all
periods ending on or before the Most Recent Fiscal Quarter End does not, in
the aggregate, exceed the amount of accruals for Taxes (excluding reserves for
deferred Taxes) reflected on the Financial Statements, other than a necessary
true-up of the accrual to actual for the year ended December 31, 2013 and the
Most Recent Fiscal Quarter End. Except to the extent directly related to the
Financial Statement Exclusions since the Most Recent Fiscal Quarter End,
neither Target nor any of its Subsidiaries has engaged in any transaction or
taken any other action, other than in the Ordinary Course of Business, that
would affect such accruals for Taxes.

 

(viii) Seller has provided to Buyer a balance sheet, calculated on a Tax basis
as was used in determining the deferred income tax amounts under SSAP 101 and
GAAP, for Target and each of its Subsidiaries, as of December 31, 2013. The
adjusted Tax basis of the assets reflected on the balance sheet is true and
correct for federal Income Tax purposes as of the date of such balance sheet,
except for any true-ups of the accrual at December 31, 2013 to actual 2013
federal Income Tax Return and without regard to basis differences related to
investments in Subsidiaries.

 

(k) _Real Property_.

(i) None of Target and its Subsidiaries owns any Real Property.

(ii) §4(k)(ii) of the Disclosure Schedule sets forth the address of
each parcel of Leased Real Property, and a true and complete list of all
Leases for each such parcel of Leased Real Property. Seller has delivered to

its Subsidiaries (i) owes any brokerage commissions or finders fees with
respect to any Lease, (ii) has subleased, licensed or otherwise granted any
Person the right to use or occupy any Lease or any material portion thereof or

Subsidiaries with respect to any of its Intellectual Property and (ii) all
material software owned or licensed by any of Target and its Subsidiaries.
Except as set forth on §4(l) of the Disclosure Schedule, Target and its
Subsidiaries have the valid right to use all Intellectual Property used in or
necessary for the conduct of their businesses, in each case, free and clear
of Liens. To the Knowledge of Seller, the conduct of the businesses of Target
and its Subsidiaries as currently and formerly conducted has not infringed,
misappropriated, diluted or otherwise violated, and does not infringe,
misappropriate, dilute or otherwise violate the Intellectual Property or
other rights of any Person. To the Knowledge of Seller, no Person has
infringed, misappropriated, diluted or otherwise violated, or is currently
infringing, misappropriating, diluting or otherwise violating, any
Intellectual Property of Target or any of its Subsidiaries. Except as set
forth in §4(l) of the Disclosure Schedule, none of Seller, Target or any of
their respective Affiliates has any 

 



17  obligation to provide any compensation to any Person for the use of any
Intellectual Property that is used in the business of Target and its
Subsidiaries as conducted as of the date hereof (excluding any commercially
available, off-the-shelf software product that is licensed under a "click
wrap," "shrink wrap", volume or similar license agreement for aggregate (x)
one-time license fees of less than $10,000 per authorized installation or
concurrent user or (y) annual license fees of less than $1,000 per authorized
installation or concurrent user). Each of Target and its Subsidiaries has

and agreements to which Target or any of its Subsidiaries is a party that:
(i) involve pecuniary payment(s) or other consideration to or from Target or
any of its Subsidiaries in excess of US $500,000 during any future period of
one year or less or (ii) are Material Contracts. Seller has provided to Buyer
a correct and complete copy of each such contract and agreement (as amended to
date) required to be listed in §4(m) of the Disclosure Schedule and, to the
Knowledge of Seller, each such contract and agreement is valid and binding on
the parties thereto in accordance with its terms and is in full force and
effect. Except as disclosed in §4(m) of the Disclosure Schedule, none of
Target, any of its Subsidiaries, or, to the Knowledge of Seller, any other
party to any such contract or agreement is in breach of or default under (or
is alleged to be in breach of or default under), or has provided or received
any notice of any intention to terminate, any such contract or agreement, and
no event or circumstance has occurred that, with notice or lapse of time or
both, would constitute an event of default under any such contract or
agreement or result in a termination thereof or would cause or permit the
acceleration or other changes of any right or obligation or the loss of any
benefit thereunder.

(n) _Litigation_. §4(n) of the Disclosure Schedule sets forth each instance

period between the execution of this Agreement and the Closing.

(a) _General_. Each of the Parties will use commercially reasonable efforts to
take such actions and to do such things reasonably necessary in order to
consummate and make effective the transactions contemplated by this Agreement
(including satisfaction, but not waiver, of the Closing conditions set forth
in §7 below).

 

(b) _Notices and Consents_. Each of the Parties will (and Seller will cause
each of Target and each Target Subsidiary to) give any notices to, make any
filings with, and use commercially reasonable efforts to obtain any
authorizations, consents, and approvals of Governmental Authorities in
connection with the matters referred to in §3(a)(ii), §3(b)(ii) and §4(c)
above. Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, each of the Parties
will (and Seller will cause each of Target and Targets Subsidiaries to) (i)
make any filings that they may be required to file with the Federal Trade
Commission and the Antitrust Division of the United States Department of
Justice under the Hart-Scott-Rodino Act or other antitrust laws, use
commercially reasonable efforts to obtain (and Seller will cause each of
Target and Targets 

 



19  Subsidiaries to use commercially reasonable efforts to obtain) a waiver from
the applicable waiting period, and make (and Seller will cause each of Target
and Targets Subsidiaries to make) any further filings pursuant thereto that
may be reasonably necessary in connection therewith; and (ii) file any
required forms, filings or reports that they may be required to file to obtain
the DOI Approvals and use commercially reasonable efforts to obtain the DOI
Approvals. The initial filing with respect to each Form A approval required
from any Governmental Authority shall be made promptly (and in any event no

in this Agreement, without limiting the generality of the other undertakings
pursuant to this §5, each of Seller, Target and Buyer shall cooperate with
each other and use, and shall cause their respective Affiliates to use, their
respective commercially reasonable efforts to promptly provide to a
Governmental Authority non-privileged information, documents or testimony
requested by such Governmental Authority that are required in order to permit
consummation of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement. Subject to
applicable Laws relating to the sharing of information, each of Seller, Target
and Buyer shall, to the extent reasonably practicable, promptly notify each
other of any communication it receives from any Governmental Authority,
permit the other party to review in advance any proposed communication by such
party to any Governmental Authority and provide each other with copies of all
correspondence, filings or communications between such party or any of its
representatives, on the one hand, and any Governmental Authority or members of
the staff of any Governmental Authority, on the other hand, in each case to
the extent relating to the matters that are the subject of this Agreement; 
_provided_ , _however_ , that nothing in §5(a) and §5(b) shall require either
Seller or Buyer to provide or cause to be provided to the other confidential
information submitted to any Governmental Authority or the portions
of notices or other communications received from or with Governmental
Authority relating or referring to confidential information. To the extent
reasonably practicable, Buyer shall not agree to participate in any meeting
with any Governmental Authority, or submit any request to engage in any
discussions with a Governmental Authority with respect to holding or
participating in any meeting with such Governmental Authority, in each case
relating to the matters that are the subject of this Agreement unless it
consults with Seller and Target in advance and, to the extent permitted by
such Governmental Authority, gives Seller and Target the opportunity to attend
and participate at such meeting. Subject to the Confidentiality
Agreement, Seller, Target and Buyer shall coordinate and cooperate fully with
each other in exchanging such information and providing such assistance as the
other party may reasonably request in connection with the foregoing (including
in seeking early termination of any applicable waiting periods under the
Hart-Scott-Rodino Act); _provided_ , _however_ , that the foregoing shall not
require Seller, Target, any Target Subsidiary, Buyer or any of their
respective Affiliates (i) to disclose any information that in the reasonable
judgment of Seller, Target, such Target Subsidiary, Buyer or any of their
respective Affiliates (as the case may be) would result in the disclosure of
any trade secrets of third parties or violate any of its obligations with
respect to confidentiality or (ii) to disclose any privileged information or
confidential competitive information of Seller, Target, any Target Subsidiary,
Buyer or any of their respective Affiliates. Neither Party shall be required
to comply with any provision of §5(a) and §5(b) to the extent that such
compliance would be prohibited by applicable Laws. Notwithstanding anything to
the contrary set forth in §5(a) and §5(b), or any other section of this
Agreement, none of Seller, Buyer or any of their respective Affiliates shall
be required to, and Target and its Subsidiaries may not, without the prior
written consent of

 



20  Buyer, become subject to, consent to, or offer or agree to, or otherwise
take any action with respect to, any requirement, condition, limitation,
understanding, agreement or order (i) to sell, license, assign, transfer,
divest, hold separate or otherwise dispose of any material assets, business or
portion of a business of any of Seller, Target, Buyer, or any of their
respective Subsidiaries or Affiliates, or (ii) which imposes any material
restriction, requirement or limitation on the operation of the business or
portion of the business of Seller, Target, Buyer or any of their respective
Subsidiaries or Affiliates.

 

(c) _Operation of Business_. Except with Buyers prior written consent, Seller
will not (i) cause or permit Target or any of Targets Subsidiaries to engage
in any practice, take any action, or enter into any transaction outside the
Ordinary Course of Business; or (ii) take, and will cause Target and its
Subsidiaries not to take, any action that is listed on Annex V attached
hereto (provided that with respect to paragraphs 6, 9, 10, 11, 13, 14, 18 and
20 of Annex V, Buyers consent shall not be unreasonably withheld).

 

(d) _Full Access_. Seller will permit, and Seller will cause each of Target
and Targets Subsidiaries to permit, representatives of Buyer (including
legal counsel and accountants), upon reasonable prior notice, to have full
access at reasonable times, and in a manner that does not materially interfere
with the normal business operations of Target or its Subsidiaries, to
all premises, properties, key personnel, books, records (including Tax
records), contracts, and documents of or pertaining to each of Target and
Targets Subsidiaries. Buyer will hold any confidential information it
receives from any of Seller, Target, and Targets Subsidiaries in the course
of the reviews contemplated by this §5(d) subject to the terms of the
Confidentiality Agreement. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained
herein, Seller and Target shall not be required prior to the Closing to
disclose, or cause its Affiliates or its or its Affiliates respective
representatives prior to the Closing to disclose, to Buyer or any of its
Affiliates or any of their respective representatives (or provide access to
any offices, properties, books or records of Target or any of its Affiliates
that could result in the disclosure to such Persons or others of) any
information that is subject to attorney-client privilege.

 

(e) _Notice of Developments_.

 

(i) Seller shall give prompt written notice to Buyer of any development that
has resulted in or could reasonably be expected to result in a breach of any
of the representations and warranties in §4 above.

(ii) Each Party shall give prompt written notice to the other of any
development that has resulted in or could reasonably be expected to result in
a breach of any of its own representations and warranties in §3 above.

 

(iii) No disclosure by either Party pursuant to §5(e)(i) or (ii), however,
shall be deemed to amend or supplement Annex I, Annex II, or the Disclosure
Schedule or to prevent or cure any misrepresentation or breach of warranty.

(f) _Exclusivity_. Seller will not (and Seller will not cause or permit
Target or any of its Subsidiaries to) directly or indirectly solicit,
initiate, or encourage the submission of any proposal or offer from any Person
relating to the acquisition of all or substantially all of the capital stock
or assets of Target or any of its Subsidiaries (including any acquisition
structured as a merger, consolidation, share exchange or loss portfolio
transfer).

 



21 (g) _Intercompany Agreements and Accounts_. Except as otherwise contemplated
by this Agreement, prior to Closing, Seller shall, and shall cause its
Affiliates to, (i) obtain all required regulatory approvals to terminate all
Intercompany Agreements and settle all Intercompany Accounts effective
immediately prior to the Closing, (ii) terminate all Intercompany Agreements
without any further liability to or obligation of Target or any of its
Subsidiaries thereunder, effective immediately prior to the Closing, and (iii)
settle, discharge, pay, terminate and extinguish in full all Intercompany
Accounts, effective immediately prior to the Closing. Prior to the Closing,
all amounts paid by Target or its Subsidiaries, on the one hand, to Seller or
any of its Affiliates, on the other hand, pursuant to any Intercompany
Agreement shall be determined in an amount consistent with past practice and
shall not exceed $2,900,000 per month on average for the month of July 2014
through the month immediately preceding the month in which the Closing occurs.
The amount to be paid by Target and its Subsidiaries to Seller or any of its
Affiliates pursuant to any Intercompany Agreement with respect to the month in
which the Closing occurs shall be estimated by Seller in good faith in a
manner consistent with past practice to the extent practical and shall not
exceed an amount equal to $2,900,000 multiplied by the number of days elapsed
in the month in which the Closing occurs and divided by the total number of
days in such month. Seller shall provide Buyer with a schedule (in the same
format as submitted in relation to Annex IV(m)) setting forth the payments to
be made pursuant to each Intercompany Agreement at least five Business Days
prior to any such payments being made and shall promptly respond to any
reasonable questions Buyer may have with respect to any such schedule.
Notwithstanding the foregoing, (A) all payments to be made by Target or any of
its Subsidiaries to Seller or any of its Affiliates with respect to any
Taxes shall be made solely in accordance with §10(c) below, and (B) all
payments to be made by Seller, Target or any of their Affiliates under the
Seller Reinsurance Agreements shall be made in accordance with the terms of
such agreements or the Commutation Agreement. None of Target or its
Subsidiaries shall owe any release, termination or other non-ordinary course
fee or payment to Seller or any of its Affiliates in connection with the
settlement, discharge, payment, termination or extinguishment of all
Intercompany Agreements and Intercompany Accounts at or prior to the Closing.

(h) _Collateral Asset Substitution_. On or before the Closing Date, Seller
shall complete the Collateral Asset substitution described in _Exhibit D_ ,
including retention of any rights related to pursuit or prosecution of any
litigation rights related to the substituted collateral assets as
contemplated by §6(b)(i).

(i) _Asset Contribution_. Prior to the Closing, Seller shall, and shall cause
each of its Affiliates (other than Target and its Subsidiaries) to, contribute
to Target free and clear of all Liens and for no consideration any and all
tangible personal property owned by Seller or such Affiliates that are
primarily used in the business of Target or any of its Subsidiaries. Such
assets shall include all furniture, computers, office equipment, supplies,
telephones and other tangible personal property primarily used by any
individual currently employed by Seller or one of its Affiliates who
primarily performs services on behalf of Target or one of its Subsidiaries and
who

 



22  Buyer intends to hire following the Closing, excluding cell phones or cell
phone plans. Buyer and Seller shall cooperate in good faith to determine the
specific assets to be contributed to Target prior the Closing pursuant to
this §5(i). Buyer shall have the right to reject any such tangible personal
property that it does not wish to acquire as part of the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement.

 

6\. _Post-Closing Covenants_. The Parties agree as follows with respect to the
period following the Closing.

 

(a) _General_. In case at any time after the Closing any further action is
reasonably necessary to carry out the purposes of this Agreement, each of the
Parties will use commercially reasonable efforts to take such further action
(including the execution and delivery of such further instruments and
documents) as the other Party reasonably may request, all at the sole cost
and expense of the requesting Party (unless the requesting Party is entitled
to indemnification therefor under §8 below).

(b)  _Collateral Asset Related Litigation_.

(i) Seller shall retain all rights of Target and its Subsidiaries to file,
commence, prosecute, pursue, settle or defend any pending or proposed action,
suit, proceeding, charge, complaint, claim, or demand expressly set forth in
schedule attached as _Exhibit E_ (each such matter, a " _Litigation
Proceeding_ "). In the event and for so long as Target or any of its
Subsidiaries is prosecuting, pursuing or defending against such Litigation
Proceedings, such Litigation Proceeding shall be deemed for purposes of this
Agreement to be Third Party Claims for which Seller, as Indemnifying Party,
has elected to assume the prosecution and/or defense (including the filing or
commencement) of a Litigation Proceeding, and Buyer shall retain all rights
with respect thereto as the Indemnified Party, in each case as set forth in
§8(d) hereof. Buyer shall cause the employees of Target and its Subsidiaries
who prior to the Closing were employees of Seller to act at the reasonable
direction and expense of Seller should Seller desire to commence,
prosecute, counterclaim or otherwise pursue any Litigation Proceeding. Such
direction shall not unreasonably interfere with the performance by such
employees of their job function for Target or its Subsidiaries. Seller shall
provide Buyer with notice regarding any material developments regarding any
Litigation Proceeding. Seller shall be solely entitled to any and all
recoveries, including insurance proceeds, associated with any Litigation
Proceeding. Seller shall (i) be solely responsible for all out-of-pocket
fees, expenses and Adverse Consequences incurred by Target or any of its
Subsidiaries after June 30, 2014 and prior to the Closing with respect to any
Litigation Proceeding, and shall reimburse Target and its Subsidiaries for
any such amounts prior to the Closing, (ii) be solely responsible for the
payment of all reasonable out-of-pocket fees and expenses incurred by Buyer or
its Affiliates (including Target and its Subsidiaries) after the Closing
arising with respect to any Litigation Proceeding, and (iii) indemnify,
defend and hold harmless Buyer and its Affiliates (including Target and its
Subsidiaries) as set forth in §8(b)(iv).

 

(ii) Buyer shall have an obligation to cooperate with Seller and its counsel
in the filing of a Litigation Proceeding after the Closing on Sellers
behalf, and in defense or contest of any Litigation Proceeding involving in
any way the Target, make available its personnel, and provide such testimony
and access to its books and records as shall be reasonably necessary in
connection with the filing, defense or contest, all at the sole cost of
Seller.

 



23 (iii) The attorney-client privilege, attorney work product protection, and
expectation of client confidence arising from legal counsels representation
of Target or any of its Subsidiaries prior to the Closing Date of the
Agreement concerning any subject matter with respect to any Litigation
Proceeding (and all information and documents covered by such privilege or
protection) shall belong to and be controlled by Seller and waived only by
Seller, and not Target, and shall not pass to or be claimed or used by Buyer
or Target.

 

(iv) In the event that a dispute arises between Buyer or Target and a third
party (other than Seller) relating to any Litigation Proceeding, Buyer shall
assert the attorney-client privilege and attorney work product protection as
appropriate on behalf of Seller to prevent disclosure of privileged or
protected materials to such third party; provided, however, that such
privilege or protection may be waived only with the prior written consent of
Seller.

(c) _Transition_. For a period of up to one year from and after the Closing
Date, Seller shall provide the transitions services in accordance with the
terms of the Transition Services Agreement, the form of which is attached as
_Exhibit C_. Seller and Buyer shall negotiate in good faith prior to
the Closing Date to define the specific transition services to be provided
after the Closing Date that are consistent with the services historically
provided by Seller and its Affiliates to Target and its Subsidiaries, it being
understood that Buyer shall not be required to receive any transition service
it does not wish to receive, and any payment to Seller in exchange for
providing any transition service shall be limited to the actual cost to Seller
of providing such service.

 

(d) _Covenant Not to Compete; Confidentiality_. For a period of one year from
and after the Closing Date, Seller will not, and will cause its Affiliates
not to, provide or offer to provide to any Person that is a policy holder or
customer of Target or any of its Subsidiaries as of the Closing Date any
product or service that is competitive with a product or service such Person
was obtaining from Target or any of its Subsidiaries on the Closing Date. For
a period of three (3) years from and after the Closing, Seller shall, and
shall cause its Affiliates to, hold in confidence any and all information,
whether written or oral, concerning Target or its Subsidiaries, except to the
extent that Seller can show that such information (i) is generally available
to and known by the public through no fault of Seller, any of its Affiliates
or their respective representatives; or (ii) is lawfully acquired by Seller
or any of its Affiliates from and after the Closing from sources which are not
prohibited from disclosing such information by a legal, contractual or
fiduciary obligation.

 

(e) _Change of Name_. Promptly following the Closing (and in any event no
later than five (5) days thereafter), Buyer shall (i) cause to be filed with
the South Carolina Secretary of State an amendment to the constituent
documents of Target and Targets South Carolina domiciled Subsidiaries, so as
to change Target and such Target Subsidiaries names to remove "Companion"
therefrom and (ii) immediately cease using such name except as permitted by
the Transition Services Agreement and as set forth in this Agreement. Promptly
following the 

 



24  Closing (and in any event no later than ninety (90) days thereafter), Buyer
shall (i) cause to be filed with the appropriate Governmental Authorities an
amendment to the constituent documents of Targets Subsidiaries domiciled
other than in the State of South Carolina, so as to change such Target
Subsidiaries names to remove "Companion" therefrom and (ii) immediately cease
using such name except as permitted by the Transition Services Agreement and
as set forth in this Agreement. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary set
forth in this Agreement, Target and its Subsidiaries shall be permitted to
continue to use and reflect "Companion" on all historic policy forms and
historic books and records of Target and its Subsidiaries.

(f) _Books and Records_. Seller and its Affiliates shall have the right to
retain copies of all books, data, files, information and records in any media
(including, for the avoidance of doubt, Tax Returns and other information and
documents relating to Tax matters) of each of Target and the Target
Subsidiaries and their respective businesses relating to periods ending on or
prior to the Closing Date (i) as required by any legal or regulatory
authority, including any applicable Law or regulatory request or (ii) as may
be necessary for Seller and its Affiliates to perform their respective
obligations pursuant to this Agreement, in each case subject to compliance
with all applicable privacy Laws. From and after the Closing Date,
with respect to all original books, data, files, information and records of
each of Target and the Target Subsidiaries existing as of the Closing Date,
Buyer shall, and shall cause each of Target and the Target Subsidiaries to,
(A) comply in all material respects with all applicable Laws relating to the
preservation and retention of records, (B) apply preservation and retention
policies that are no less stringent than those generally applied by Buyer and
(C) for at least six (6) years after the Closing Date or, if notice of an
extension is received from Seller, until the expiration of the applicable
statute of limitations for Tax purposes, whichever is later, preserve and
retain all such original books, data, files, information and records.

reimburse Seller for the severance payments set forth in _Exhibit F_.

arising out of, with respect to or by reason of such inaccuracy or breach
subject to the following limitations: (A) except in the case of Sellers
fraud, Seller shall not have any obligation to indemnify Buyer or its

any breach or non-fulfillment of any covenant, agreement or obligation to
be performed by Seller pursuant to this Agreement (provided, however,
Sellers total indemnification obligation in respect of all such breaches or
non-fulfillments in the aggregate shall not exceed an amount equal to the
Purchase Price); (B) any Tax owed by Target or any of its Subsidiaries for
any period prior to the Closing Date as contemplated by §10(c) below; (C) any

against Target or any of its Subsidiaries under the Code or ERISA (regardless
of the time period to which such liability, obligation or Tax relates) as a
result of Targets or any such Subsidiaries status as a member of Sellers
controlled 

 



28  group of corporations (as defined in Sections 414(b) of the Code and
4001(a)(14)(A) of ERISA) prior to the Closing; (E) any Litigation Proceeding;
(F) the Sale and Purchase Agreement dated as of June 11, 2014 between AmFed

the removal or diversion of any assets from any trust, custodial, segregated
or other account in which Freestone or any liquidator, receiver or other
successor to Freestone has a residual interest; and (H) any additional matter
set forth on Annex VI hereto.

 

(c) _Indemnification Provisions for Seller s Benefit_. In the event of any
inaccuracy in or breach of any of the representations, warranties, and
covenants of Buyer contained herein, and if Seller makes a written claim for
indemnification against Buyer within the applicable survival period pursuant
to §8(a) above, then Buyer shall indemnify Seller from and against
any Adverse Consequences Seller shall suffer based upon, arising out of, with
respect to or by reason of such inaccuracy or breach; subject to the following
limitations: (i) except in the case of Buyers fraud, Buyer shall not have
any obligation to indemnify Seller from and against any Adverse Consequences
caused by the inaccuracy in or breach of any representation or warranty of
Buyer until Seller has suffered Adverse Consequences by reason of all such
inaccuracies and breaches in excess of $1,750,000, after which point Buyer
will be obligated only to indemnify Seller from and against Adverse
Consequences in excess of such amount, (ii) except in the case of Buyers
fraud, under no circumstances shall Buyers total indemnification obligation
in respect of all such inaccuracies and breaches in the aggregate exceed an
amount equal to twelve and one-half percent (12.5%) of the Purchase Price,
(iii) Buyers total indemnification obligation in respect of any breach or
non-fulfillment of any covenant, agreement or obligation to be performed by
Buyer pursuant to this Agreement shall not exceed an amount equal to the
Purchase Price, and (iv) in the case of Buyers fraud, under no circumstances
shall Buyers total indemnification obligation exceed an amount equal to the
Purchase Price. For purposes of this §8(c), any inaccuracy in or breach of any
representation or warranty shall be determined without regard to
any materiality, Material Adverse Effect, Material Adverse Change or other
similar qualification contained in or otherwise applicable to any
representation or warranty.

 

(d) _Matters Involving Third Parties_.

 

(i) If any third party shall notify either Party (the " _Indemnified Party_ ")
with respect to any matter (a " _Third Party Claim_ ") which may give rise to
a claim for indemnification against the other Party (the " _Indemnifying
Party_ ") under this §8, then the Indemnified Party shall promptly (and in any
event within twenty (20) Business Days after receiving notice of the Third
Party Claim) notify the Indemnifying Party thereof in writing. The failure to
give such prompt notice shall not relieve the Indemnifying Party of its
indemnification obligations, except and only to the extent that the
Indemnifying Party forfeits rights and defenses by reason of such failure.

(ii) The Indemnifying Party will have the right at any time to assume and
thereafter conduct the defense (including settlement) of the Third Party Claim
with counsel of his or its choice; _provided, however_ , that the Indemnifying
Party will not consent to the entry of any judgment or enter into any
settlement with respect to the Third Party Claim without the prior written
consent of the Indemnified Party (which consent will not be unreasonably
withheld) unless the judgment or proposed settlement involves only the payment
of money damages fully indemnified hereunder and does not impose an
injunction or other equitable relief upon the Indemnified Party.

 



29 (iii) Unless and until an Indemnifying Party assumes the defense of the Third
Party Claim as provided in §8(d)(ii) above, however, the Indemnified Party
may defend against the Third Party Claim in any manner the Indemnified Party
reasonably deems appropriate.

 

(iv) In no event will the Indemnified Party consent to the entry of any
judgment or enter into any settlement with respect to the Third Party Claim
without the prior written consent of the Indemnifying Party which consent will
not be unreasonably withheld.

(v) This §8(d) shall not apply to any Third Party Claim with respect to
Taxes, which shall be governed by §10(c).

(e) _Determination of Adverse Consequences_. All indemnification payments
under this §8 shall be paid by the Indemnifying Party net of any insurance
coverage that may be available to the Indemnified Party and shall be adjusted
to take into account the time cost of money (using the Applicable Rate as the
discount rate). All indemnification payments under this §8 shall be deemed
adjustments to the Purchase Price.

 

(f) _Exclusive Remedy_. Subject to §10(k), and except for claims arising from
fraud or willful misconduct, Buyer and Seller acknowledge and agree that the
foregoing indemnification provisions in this §8 shall be the exclusive remedy
of Buyer and Seller with respect to the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement.

 

(g) _Indemnified Party s Prior Knowledge_. The representations, warranties
and covenants of the Indemnifying Party, and the Indemnified Partys right to
indemnification with respect thereto, shall not be affected or deemed waived
by reason of any investigation made by or on behalf of the Indemnified Party,
or by reason of the fact that the Indemnified Party knew or should have known
that any such representation, warranty or covenant is, was or might be
inaccurate or breached or by reason of the Indemnified Partys waiver of any
closing condition, as the case may be.

 

9\. _Termination_.

(a)  _Termination of Agreement_. The Parties may terminate this Agreement as
provided below:

(i) Buyer and Seller may terminate this Agreement by mutual written consent
at any time prior to the Closing;

(ii) Buyer may terminate this Agreement by giving written notice to Seller at
any time prior to the Closing in the event (A) Seller has within the then
previous ten (10) Business Days given Buyer any notice pursuant to §5(e)(i) or
(ii) above and (B) the development that is the subject of the notice has had
or would reasonably be expected to have a Material Adverse Effect that cannot
be cured before the Closing Date;

 



30 (iii) Buyer may terminate this Agreement by giving written notice to Seller at
any time prior to the Closing (A) in the event Seller has breached any
representation, warranty, or covenant contained in this Agreement in a manner
that would result in or would reasonably be expected to result in the failure
to satisfy any condition specified in §7(a) above, Buyer has notified Seller
of the breach, and the breach has continued without cure for a period of
thirty (30) days after the notice of breach or (B) if the Closing shall not
have occurred on or before the End Date, by reason of the failure to satisfy
any condition precedent under §7(a) above (unless the failure results
primarily from Buyer itself breaching any representation, warranty, or
covenant contained in this Agreement); and

 

(iv) Seller may terminate this Agreement by giving written notice to Buyer at
any time prior to the Closing (A) in the event Buyer has breached any
representation, warranty, or covenant contained in this Agreement in a manner
that would result in or would reasonably be expected to result in the failure
to satisfy any condition specified in §7(b) above, Seller has notified Buyer
of the breach, and the breach has continued without cure for a period of
thirty (30) days after the notice of breach or (B) if the Closing shall not
have occurred on or before the End Date, by reason of the failure to satisfy
any condition precedent under §7(b) above (unless the failure results
primarily from Seller breaching any representation, warranty, or covenant
contained in this Agreement).

 

(b) _Effect of Termination_. If either Party terminates this Agreement
pursuant to §9(a) above, all rights and obligations of the Parties hereunder
shall terminate without any liability of either Party to the other Party
(except for any liability of a Party then in breach).

 

10\. _Miscellaneous_.

(a)  _Press Releases and Public Announcements_. Neither Party shall issue any
press release or make any public announcement relating to the subject matter
of this Agreement prior to the Closing without the prior written approval of
the other Party;  _provided, however_ , that either Party may make any public
disclosure it believes in good faith is required by applicable law or any
listing or trading agreement concerning its publicly-traded securities (in
which case the disclosing Party will use its best efforts to advise the other
Party prior to making the disclosure).

(b) _No Third-Party Beneficiaries_. Except as contemplated by §8 above, this
Agreement shall not confer any rights or remedies upon any Person other than
the Parties and their respective successors and permitted assigns.

 

(c) _Tax Matters_.

(i) Seller shall prepare and file or cause to be prepared and filed all Tax
Returns of or with respect to Target and its Subsidiaries that (A) are
required to be filed on or before the Closing Date, or (B) are required to be
filed after the Closing Date with respect to any taxable period (or portion
thereof) ending on or before the Closing Date and shall control

 



31  any audits or proceedings with respect to such Tax Returns. Buyer shall
prepare all Tax Returns of or with respect to Target and its Subsidiaries that
are required to be filed after the Closing Date with respect to any taxable
period (or portion thereof) beginning on or before and ending after the
Closing Date and shall control any audits or proceedings with respect to such
Tax Returns. Any such Tax Return shall be prepared in a manner consistent
with past practice (unless otherwise required by Law) and shall be submitted
by Seller or Buyer to the other Party, as applicable (together with schedules,
statements and, to the extent requested by the other Party,
supporting documentation) at least thirty (30) days prior to the due date
(including extensions) of such Tax Return. The filing Party shall consider in
good faith any comments or objections of the other Party that are delivered in
writing to such filing Party with ten (10) days of delivery of such Tax
Return. Seller and Buyer shall provide each other with such cooperation and
information as either of them reasonably may request of the other in filing
any Tax Return or in connection with any audit or other proceeding in respect
of Taxes of Target or any of its Subsidiaries.

(ii) Seller shall be responsible for payment of, and indemnification with
respect to, all Taxes attributable to taxable periods (or portions thereof)
ending on or before the Closing Date. Seller shall pay such amounts to Buyer
at least five (5) days prior to the due date for payment of such Taxes and
Sellers indemnification obligations described in the previous sentence shall
survive until sixty (60) days after any applicable statute of limitations. In
the case of Taxes that are payable with respect to a taxable period that
begins on or before and ends after the Closing Date (each such period, a "
_Straddle Period_ "), the portion of any such Taxes that are treated as
attributable to the portion of such period that ends on the Closing Date shall
be determined on a "closing of the books" basis, _provided_ , _however_ ,
that Taxes imposed on a periodic basis (e.g., property taxes) shall be
apportioned between the two portions of the taxable period on a daily basis.
There shall be no Straddle Period for Income Tax purposes. If the Closing
Date is not at month end, Seller and Buyer shall include Target and its
Subsidiaries income statement results in its Income Tax filing for each full
month that such party owns Target and its Subsidiaries. In the Closing month,
Seller and Buyer shall include Target and its Subsidiaries income statement
results in its Income Tax filing using a pro-rata allocation of the full month
income statement results based on the number of days in the month through the
Closing Date to the total days in the month for Sellers Income Tax filings
and based on the number of days in the month post the Closing Date to the
total days in the month for Buyers Income Tax filings.

 

(iii) Seller shall cause Target and its Subsidiaries not to make any payment
under any tax sharing or similar agreement to which Target or any of its
Subsidiaries is a party or otherwise bound between the date of this Agreement
and the Closing without the prior written consent of Buyer, which shall not be
withheld if such proposed payment is in the Ordinary Course of Business
and consistent with the principles of the Tax Sharing Agreement.

(iv) For purposes of the final settlement of Income Taxes for the
short period Income Tax Returns ending on the Closing Date, Seller shall
prepare an estimate of the Income Taxes for the 2014 year through the Closing
Date based on the total income statement results of Target and its
Subsidiaries for all full months of its ownership in Target and Subsidiaries
plus an estimate of the prorata share of the amount of income for the full
month of

 



32  the Closing Date allocated based on the number of days in the month through
the Closing Date to the total number of days in the Closing month, and shall
furnish such estimate and the computation thereof to the Buyer for its review
and approval, which shall not be withheld if such proposed payment is in the
Ordinary Course of Business and consistent with the principles of the Tax
Sharing Agreement. The total estimated final Income Tax amount as calculated
by Seller consistently with the principles of the Tax Sharing Agreement, and
as reviewed and approved by Buyer, will be settled with Target and its
Subsidiaries as part of the final settlements on the Closing Date. No
further settlements with respect to Income Taxes will be made between Seller,
Buyer, and Target and its Subsidiaries after the Closing.

(d)  _Code §338 Election_. None of Buyer, Target, nor any of their Affiliates
shall make any election under Code §338 with respect to the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement.

 

(e) _Asset Basis Step-Down_. Prior to the earlier of (i) December 1, 2014 and
(ii) receipt of the last DOI Approval, Seller shall prepare and deliver to
Buyer a statement setting forth its good faith estimate of the "attribute
reduction amount" for Target under Treasury Regulations §1.1502-36(d) as a
result of or arising from the transactions contemplated by this Agreement
without giving effect to the limitation set forth in this §10(e), together
with any supporting documentation and information reasonably requested by
Buyer. Seller shall consider in good faith any questions, comments
or corrections that Buyer may reasonably raise with respect to such estimate
and Seller and Buyer shall, prior to the Closing Date, seek to agree in good
faith on any revisions to such estimate that are appropriate in response to
Buyers questions, comments or corrections. In the event that Seller and
Buyer are unable to agree upon the good faith estimate of such attribute
reduction amount, they shall mutually engage a national recognized independent
auditing firm to resolve any disagreement prior to the Closing Date. The
attribute reduction amount agreed to by Seller and Buyer, or determined by
such independent auditing firm, shall be the " _Estimated Asset Basis Step-
Down Amount_." In the event that any of the Target Shares are "loss shares"
for purposes of Treasury Regulations §1.1502-36 as of the Closing Date and the
"attribute reduction amount" for Target under Treasury Regulations
§1.1502-36(d) would otherwise exceed the Asset Basis Step-Down Cap, then
Seller shall elect in accordance with Treasury Regulations §1.1502-36(d)(6)(A)
to reduce its basis in the Target Shares by such amount as is sufficient to
reduce such attribute reduction amount to the Asset Basis Step-Down Cap.

(f) _Entire Agreement_. This Agreement (including the documents referred to
herein) constitutes the entire agreement among the Parties and supersedes any
prior understandings, agreements, or representations by or among the Parties,
written or oral, to the extent they relate in any way to the subject matter
hereof.

 

(g) _Succession and Assignment_. This Agreement shall be binding upon and
inure to the benefit of the Parties named herein and their respective

may (i) assign any or all of its rights and interests hereunder to one or
more of its Affiliates and (ii) designate one or more of its Affiliates to
perform its obligations hereunder; _provided further, however_ , in any and
all events that Buyer shall remain fully responsible for the observance and

which were procured at Targets or any of its Subsidiaries request: (i) all
material actuarial reports and studies prepared as of any date on or after
July 1, 2011 by third party actuaries relating to the business and operations
of Target and any of its Subsidiaries, and all material attachments, addenda,
supplements and modifications thereto, and (ii) the quarterly actuarial
reports prepared by Targets internal actuaries, and all material attachments,

on or after December 31, 2013. To the Knowledge of Seller, all information and
data furnished by Seller, Target and its Subsidiaries to their actuaries in
connection with the preparation of such actuarial reports were accurate in
all material respects for the periods covered by such reports. Except to the
extent directly related to the Financial Statement Exclusions, all reserve
liabilities, including reserves for uncollectible reinsurance, as established
or reflected on the Financial Statements, were determined in all material
respects in accordance with generally accepted actuarial standards
consistently applied, are fairly stated in accordance with sound actuarial
principles, determined in accordance with the provisions of insurance
policies and contracts of each of Target and its Subsidiaries, and are in
compliance with the requirements of SAP and applicable Laws.

 

(b) Seller has made available to Buyer true and complete copies of all
examination reports (and has notified Buyer of any pending
examinations) conducted by an insurance regulator with respect to Target or
any of its Subsidiaries that have been finalized since July 1, 2011, unless
the most recent examination report for a Company or Subsidiary was received
prior to that date, in which case a true and complete copy of each such
earlier examination report. All material deficiencies or violations noted in
such examination reports have been cured or resolved to the satisfaction of
the applicable insurance regulators without imposition of any material
penalty, condition or obligation.

(c) _Reinsurance and Insurance Contracts_.

 

(i) §4(q) of the Disclosure Schedule sets forth a true and complete list of
all material reinsurance, coinsurance or retrocession treaties, agreements,
slips, binders, cover notes and similar arrangements in force as of the date
of this Agreement to which any of Target or its Subsidiaries is a party or
otherwise bound, excluding facultative certifications (each, a " _Reinsurance
Agreement_ "). Except as set forth in §4(q) of the Disclosure Schedule and for
such events or circumstances as have not been and could not reasonably be
expected to be, individually or in the aggregate, material to Target and its
Subsidiaries, taken as a whole, with respect to each Reinsurance Agreement:
(A) there has been no separate contract, agreement or understanding between
Target or its Subsidiaries and any other party to such Reinsurance
Agreement that would under any circumstances reduce, limit, mitigate or
otherwise affect any actual or potential loss to the parties under any such
Reinsurance Agreement; (B) Target and each of its Subsidiaries that is a party
thereto, and to the Knowledge of Seller, any other party  thereto complies and has complied with any applicable requirements set forth

its Subsidiaries has appropriate controls in place to monitor the use of

(ii) Seller has made available to Buyer all Reinsurance Agreements and all
Insurance Contracts to which any of Target or any of its Subsidiaries is a
party or otherwise bound with a premium amount equal to or greater than
$250,000. For purposes of this Agreement, " _Insurance Contracts_ " shall mean
all insurance contracts, policies, binders, certificates and similar
arrangements. Other than Seller Reinsurance Agreements, except as set forth on
§4(q) of the Disclosure Schedule, each Insurance Contract is valid and binding
on Target or its applicable Subsidiary, and to the Knowledge of Seller,
each other party thereto, and is in full force and effect and no party is in
default thereunder. Except as set forth on §4(q) of the Disclosure Schedule,
to the Knowledge of Seller, there are no events or conditions which
constitute, or, after notice or lapse of time or both, will constitute, a
default on the part of any counterparty under such Insurance Contract. Except
as set forth on §4(q) of the Disclosure Schedule, to the Knowledge of Seller,
no counterparty under an Insurance Contract is insolvent or the subject of a
rehabilitation, liquidation, conservatorship, receivership, bankruptcy or
similar proceeding.

 

(iii) Except as set forth in §4(q) of the Disclosure Schedule, all Insurance
Contracts are and have been issued, to the extent required by applicable

for objection, and all such forms comply with applicable Laws. Except as
set forth in §4(q) of the Disclosure Schedule, all premium rates with respect
to the Insurance Contracts, to the extent required by applicable Laws, have
been filed with and approved by all applicable insurance regulators or were
not objected to by any such regulators within any period provided for

(iv) §4(q) of the Disclosure Schedule sets forth a true and complete list of

agreements under which Target cedes business to Seller, including fronting
agreements, Reinsurance Agreements, Agent Contracts, guaranties, trust or
similar agreements, and contracts relating to collateral in connection with
the program (collectively, a " _Fronting Program_ "). Each Fronting
Program is collateralized as shown in §4(q) of the Disclosure Schedule as of
the Most Recent Fiscal Quarter End. Other than the Florida Consent Order and
state insurance Law restrictions on collateral, such collateral or other
security is not subject to any restrictions that would prevent Target from
ultimately using such collateral or any security to pay any and all
obligations Target or any of its Subsidiaries may have in connection with the
applicable Fronting Program. Except as set forth on §4(i) of the Disclosure  Schedule, to the Knowledge of Seller, no counterparty to any contract that
is part of each Fronting Program is unable to timely pay all amounts due under
each such contract, is insolvent, or the subject of a rehabilitation,
liquidation, conservatorship, receivership, bankruptcy or similar proceeding.
Except as set forth in §4(q) of the Disclosure Schedule, each of Target and
its Subsidiaries maintains a system to monitor and control each Fronting
Program and to provide reasonable assurances that: (a) each program is being
operated in material compliance with all contracts applicable to such program

in connection with each such program are executed in accordance with
managements specific and general authorizations; and (c) collateral and other

any of its Subsidiaries and (ii) none of Target nor any of its Subsidiaries
has adopted any board resolution at the request of any insurance regulator or
other Governmental Authority, in the case of each of clauses (i) and

its Subsidiaries to issue or enter into Insurance Contracts or Agency  Contracts, (2) requires the divestiture of any material investment of Target
or any of its Subsidiaries, (3) limits in any material respect the ability of

kind or character, (4) requires any material investment of Target or any of
its Subsidiaries to be treated as a non-admitted asset (or the local
equivalent) or (5) could otherwise have a Material Adverse Effect on the

except for such failures to be so licensed or such violations that have been
cured, otherwise resolved or settled through agreements with the applicable
insurance regulators or that are barred by an applicable statute of
limitations.

(i) §4(q) sets forth (a) a true and complete list of the all material
agreements and contracts between or among Target and each of its
Subsidiaries, on the one hand, and each Target Agent, on the other, and each
agreement or contract under which any Person is entitled to receive contingent
compensation based on the profitability to Target or any of its Subsidiaries
of any business produced, underwritten, managed, serviced or otherwise

guidelines governing the types of investment permitted for each such company
(the " _Investment Guidelines_ "). All Investment Guidelines comply with
applicable Laws and applicable SAP. Except for the Collateral Assets, Target
and each of its Subsidiaries (a) is in full compliance with its respective
Investment Guidelines and (b) has invested all of its respective investment
assets in compliance with its respective Investment Guidelines and
