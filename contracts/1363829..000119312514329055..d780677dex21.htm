shall prepare and deliver to Buyer a statement setting forth its good faith estimate of the &#147;attribute reduction amount&#148; for Target under Treasury Regulations &#167;1.1502-36(d) as a result of or arising from the transactions contemplated
by this Agreement without giving effect to the limitation set forth in this &#167;10(e), together with any supporting documentation and information reasonably requested by Buyer. Seller shall consider in good faith any questions, comments or
corrections that Buyer may reasonably raise with respect to such estimate and Seller and Buyer shall, prior to the Closing Date, seek to agree in good faith on any revisions to such estimate that are appropriate in response to Buyer&#146;s
questions, comments or corrections. In the event that Seller and Buyer are unable to agree upon the good faith estimate of such attribute reduction amount, they shall mutually engage a national recognized independent auditing firm to resolve any
disagreement prior to the Closing Date. The attribute reduction amount agreed to by Seller and Buyer, or determined by such independent auditing firm, shall be the &#147;<U>Estimated Asset Basis Step-Down Amount</U>.&#148; In the event that any of
the Target Shares are &#147;loss shares&#148; for purposes of Treasury Regulations &#167;1.1502-36 as of the Closing Date and the &#147;attribute reduction amount&#148; for Target under Treasury Regulations &#167;1.1502-36(d) would otherwise exceed
the Asset Basis Step-Down Cap, then Seller shall elect in accordance with Treasury Regulations &#167;1.1502-36(d)(6)(A) to reduce its basis in the Target Shares by such amount as is sufficient to reduce such attribute reduction amount to the Asset
Basis Step-Down Cap. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:6pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:8%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">(f) <U>Entire Agreement</U>. This Agreement (including the documents referred to herein) constitutes the entire
