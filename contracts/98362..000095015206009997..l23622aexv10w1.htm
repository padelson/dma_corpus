 (a) Subject to the terms and conditions set forth in this Agreement, on the Deferred Closing Date, Timken Alloy shall sell, transfer, convey, assign and deliver to the Company or a designee of Buyer, and the Company or such designee shall purchase and accept from Timken Alloy, the Sheffield Assets and the Timken Alloy Distribution Business as a going concern (the "Deferred Closing" ). If the Estimated Deferred Closing Book Value is less than $4,010,327, then Timken shall pay, or cause Timken Alloy to pay, on the Deferred Closing Date, to the Company or a designee of Buyer by wire transfer of immediately available 

    ##### 

  

    

funds, an amount in cash equal to such shortfall ("Sheffield
Shortfall Amount" ), to an account or accounts designated by the Company or
Buyer at least one (1) Business Day prior to the Deferred Closing Date. At
least three (3) but no more than five (5) Business Days prior to the Deferred
Closing Date, Timken shall cause to be prepared and delivered to Buyer a
certificate setting forth in reasonable detail its good faith reasonable
estimate of the Deferred Closing Book Value (the "Estimated Deferred Closing
Book Value" ). The Estimated Deferred Closing Book Value shall be subject to
review by Buyer, and Timken and Buyer will cooperate and negotiate in good
faith to resolve any dispute regarding the Estimated Deferred Closing Book
Value; _provided_ that if any item of dispute regarding the Estimated
Deferred Closing Book Value is not resolved by agreement in writing between
Timken and Buyer prior to the Deferred Closing Date, then Timkens reasonable
estimate for such disputed item together with the resolved disputed items and
the undisputed items contained in the Estimated Deferred Closing Book Value
shall be deemed the Estimated Deferred Closing Book Value for purposes of
determining any payment due to the Company at the Deferred Closing pursuant

 (b) Within thirty (30) days following the Deferred Closing Date, Buyer, at its option, shall be entitled to prepare and deliver to Timken its determination of the Deferred Closing Book Value (the "Buyer Book Value Determination"). Within fifteen (15) days following receipt by Timken of the Buyer Book Value Determination, Timken shall deliver written notice to Buyer containing a reasonably detailed description of any dispute it has with respect to the content of the Buyer Book Value Determination. If Timken does not notify Buyer of a dispute with respect to the Buyer Book Value Determination within such fifteen (15) day period, the Buyer Book Value Determination will be final, conclusive and binding on the parties. In the event of such notification of a dispute, Buyer and Timken shall negotiate in good faith to resolve such dispute. If Buyer and Timken, notwithstanding such good faith effort, fail to resolve such dispute within ten (10) days after Timken provides Buyer with written notice of its objections, then Buyer and Timken jointly shall engage the Independent Auditor to determine the Deferred Closing Book Value, which determination shall be final, conclusive and binding on the parties. If the Deferred Closing Book Value as set forth in the Buyer Book Value Determination (if Timken does not object within the applicable time period), the Deferred Closing Book Value as determined by the Independent Auditor or the Deferred Closing Book Value as mutually agreed upon by the Buyer and Timken pursuant to this Section 2.9(b) (as the case may be, the "Final Book Value"), is less than the Estimated Deferred Closing Book Value, Timken shall pay, or cause Timken Alloy to pay, to the Company, or a designee of the Buyer, by wire transfer of immediately available funds, an amount in cash equal to the Estimated Deferred Closing Book Value less the Final Book Value. If the Final Book Value exceeds the Estimated Deferred Closing Book Value, then the Company shall pay to Timken an amount equal to such excess up to but not exceeding the Sheffield Shortfall Amount. For purposes of complying with the terms set forth in this _Section 2.9_, each party shall cooperate with and make available to the other parties and their respective representatives all information, records, data and working papers, and shall permit access to its facilities and personnel, as may be reasonably required in connection with the preparation and analysis of the Final Book Value and the resolution of any disputes hereunder. 

   

 (c) Upon the terms and subject to the conditions set forth in this Agreement, at the Deferred Closing, the Company or a designee of the Buyer shall assume the obligations 

    ##### 

  

    

for future performance arising after the Deferred Closing Date under the
Sheffield Purchase Orders and the Sheffield Consignment Agreements, it being
understood that none of the Company, the Buyer or its designee shall assume,
and do not hereby agree to pay, discharge or perform, any Losses relating in
any manner to or arising from any beach or default of Timken Alloy of any
Sheffield Purchase Order or Sheffield Consignment Agreement occurring on or
prior to the Deferred Closing Date regardless of whether Timken or Timken
Alloy discloses such breach or default pursuant to this Agreement or
otherwise. 

   

 (d) To the extent that the Sheffield Purchase Orders and the Sheffield Consignment Agreements are capable of assignment, Timken Alloy shall, at the Deferred Closing, assign to the Company or a designee of the Buyer the benefit (subject to the burden) of the Sheffield Purchase Orders and the Sheffield Consignment Agreements. In so far as the benefit (subject to the burden) of any of the Sheffield Purchase Orders or the Sheffield Consignment Agreements cannot be assigned by Timken Alloy to the Company at the Deferred Closing without the agreement or consent of a third party or a Governmental Authority, Timken Alloy will use its commercially reasonable efforts to obtain such agreements or consents prior to the Deferred Closing, and if such agreements or consents cannot be obtained prior to the Deferred Closing: 

   

 (i) Timken Alloy shall use its commercially reasonable efforts (with the cooperation of the Company) to procure that such Sheffield Purchase Orders and Sheffield Consignment Agreements are novated or assigned within 30 days after the Deferred Closing; 

  

 (ii) unless and until any such contracts shall be novated or assigned or completed, Timken Alloy shall continue its corporate existence and shall hold the benefit of such contract upon trust for the Company, or a designee of the Buyer, absolutely and shall either account to the Company, or a designee of the Buyer, or pay to the credit of a specially designated trust bank account maintained separately from all other accounts of Timken Alloy and account to the Company, or a designee of the Buyer, as soon as reasonably practicable thereafter, for any sums or other benefits received by Timken Alloy in relation thereto and the Company, or a designee of the Buyer, shall indemnify Timken Alloy against all Losses which may be incurred or suffered by Timken Alloy arising out of or in connection with any post-Deferred Closing obligations under such Sheffield Purchase Orders and Sheffield Consignment Agreements (other than such as may be suffered or incurred by reason of any existing breach of contract by Timken Alloy) provided that the Company, or a designee of the Buyer, shall have the right to perform, in place of Timken Alloy, any such contract as sub-contractor, agent, licensee or sub-licensee (as the case may be) to the extent that such performance may be permitted by any such contract; and 

  

 (iii) unless and until any such Sheffield Purchase Orders and Sheffield Consignment Agreements shall be novated or assigned, Timken Alloy shall (so far as it lawfully may so do and provided it is reasonable so to do) act under the direction of the Company, or a designee of the Buyer, in all matters relating to such orders and contracts for so long as Timken Alloy is required and authorized so to do by the Company, or a designee of the Buyer. 

   ##### 

  

  

 (e) Except as expressly provided in _Sections 2.9(c)_ and _(g)_ and subject to the indemnification provisions set forth in _Sections_ _2.9(d)(ii)_ and _9.2(b)_ of this Agreement, neither the Buyer, nor any Person designated by the Buyer to whom any of the Sheffield Assets shall be transferred, nor the Company, shall have any liability or obligation whatsoever for any Liability of Timken Alloy, all of which will be retained by Timken Alloy. 

   

 (f) Timken shall, or shall cause Timken Alloy to, from time to time after the Deferred Closing at the request of Buyer, without further consideration, execute and deliver further instruments of transfer and assignment and other documents or certificates and take such other action as Buyer or its designee may reasonably request to more effectively transfer, convey and assign to Buyer or its designee the Sheffield Assets and all rights thereto. 

   

 (g) The parties intend that article 5 of the United Kingdom Value Added Tax (Special Provisions) Order 1995 shall apply to the sale of the Sheffield Assets and the Timken Alloy Distribution Business and agree to use all reasonable endeavors to secure that the sale is treated as neither a supply of goods nor a supply of services under that article. If, nevertheless, any United Kingdom value added tax ("VAT") is payable on the sale of the Sheffield Assets under this Agreement and HM Revenue and Customs have so confirmed in writing after full disclosure of all material facts, the Company or the Buyer or its designee shall pay to Timken Alloy the amount of that VAT (together with any interest and penalties thereon) within thirty (30) days following receipt of a valid VAT invoice from Timken Alloy. If the Company or Buyer or its designee pays Timken Alloy an amount in respect of VAT under this _Section 2.9(g)_ and HM Revenue and Customs rule in writing that all or part of it was not properly chargeable, Timken Alloy shall repay the amount or relevant part of it to the Company or Buyer or its designee. Timken Alloy shall make the repayment promptly after the ruling, unless it has already accounted to HM Revenue and Customs for the VAT. In that case, Timken Alloy shall apply for a refund of the VAT, use reasonable endeavors to obtain it as speedily as practicable, and pay to the Company or Buyer or its designee the amount of the refund and any interest when and to the extent received from HM Revenue and Customs. 

   

 (h) Notwithstanding any other provision of this Agreement, Timken Alloy and the Buyer or its designee intend that Timken Alloy should retain the records referred to in section 49 of United Kingdom Value Added Tax Act 1994 ("VAT Records") and accordingly (i) Timken Alloy shall immediately following the Deferred Closing make a request to HM Revenue and Customs for a direction that the VAT Records be preserved by Timken Alloy; (ii) Timken Alloy shall promptly following the Deferred Closing notify the Buyer or its designee of the result of that request and, if HM Revenue and Customs do not grant it, shall deliver the VAT Records to the Buyer or its designee as soon as reasonably practicable; and (iii) Timken Alloy shall preserve the VAT Records in the United Kingdom for such period as may be required by law, so long as it preserves the VAT Records, permit the Buyer or its designee reasonable access to them to inspect or make copies (at the Buyer or designees cost) of them and not at any time cease to preserve the VAT Records without giving the Buyer or its designee a reasonable opportunity to inspect and remove such of them as the Buyer or its designee wishes.

If Timken does not notify Buyer of a dispute with respect to the Closing Working Capital Statement within such forty-five (45) day period, the Closing Working Capital Statement will be final, conclusive and binding on the parties. In the event of such notification of a dispute, Buyer and Timken shall negotiate in good faith to resolve such dispute. If Buyer and Timken, notwithstanding such good faith effort, fail to resolve such dispute within thirty (30) days after Timken provides Buyer with written notice of its objections, then Buyer and Timken jointly shall engage the firm of PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP to resolve such dispute, and if PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP is unwilling or unable to serve in such capacity, then Buyer and Timken jointly shall engage the firm of Deloitte and Touche LLP, and if Deloitte and Touche LLP is unwilling or unable to serve in such capacity, Timken and Buyer shall select, within ten (10) days after notification that Deloitte and Touche LLP is unwilling or unable to serve in such capacity, a mutually acceptable nationally recognized independent accounting firm to resolve such dispute (any such firm serving in such capacity pursuant to this sentence is referred to herein as the "Independent Auditor").

As soon as practicable thereafter, but in no event later than thirty (30) days after such presentation, Buyer and Timken shall cause the Independent Auditor to choose one of the parties positions as to each disputed item based solely upon the presentation by Buyer and Timken and any additional information requested by the Independent Auditor. The parties shall share equally the fees and 

      ##### 

  

    

expenses of the Independent Auditor. All determinations made by the
Independent Auditor will be final, conclusive and binding on the parties,
absent manifest error or fraud. The scope of the Independent Auditors review
of any dispute between Timken and Buyer regarding the Closing Working Capital
Statement shall be limited solely to the resolution of Timkens objections set
forth in Timkens notice of objection and Timken shall have no right to
change, revise or otherwise modify the Closing Working Capital Statement
except as agreed to by Buyer or as required by the Independent Auditor. For
purposes hereof, "Final Working Capital" shall equal (i) the Working Capital
set forth in the Closing Working Capital Statement delivered by Buyer, if
Timken does not timely deliver a notice of objection in accordance with the
provisions hereof (or agrees that it does not object to the Closing Working
Capital Statement), (ii) the Working Capital as mutually agreed upon by Buyer
and Timken upon the resolution of any dispute regarding Working
Capital pursuant hereto or (iii) the Working Capital as determined by the
Independent Auditor, if the Independent Auditor is engaged pursuant to this
_Section 2.10(b)_.

Such payment is to be made within five (5) Business Days of the date on which the Final Working Capital is finally determined pursuant to _Section 2.10(b)_. 

   

 (e) If the Final Working Capital (as finally determined pursuant to _Section 2.10(b)_) is greater than the Estimated Working Capital, then the Purchase Price will be adjusted upward by the amount of such excess and Buyer and the Company, jointly and severally, shall pay or cause to be paid an amount in cash equal to such excess, by bank wire transfer of immediately available funds, to an account designated in writing by Timken to Buyer. Such payment is to be made within five (5) Business Days from the date on which the Final Working Capital is finally determined pursuant to _Section 2.10(b)_.

 7.6 _Tax Matters_. 

  

 (a) _Preparation of Tax Returns_. 

   

 (i) Timken shall prepare, or cause to be prepared, in accordance with the provisions of this  _Section 7.6_, all Tax Returns relating to (A) income Taxes of the Company and its Subsidiaries for all taxable periods ending on or prior to the Closing Date required to be filed by the Company and its Subsidiaries (or an Affiliate of the Company or its Subsidiaries) on or after the Closing Date and (B) income Taxes that are paid on a consolidated, unitary, combined or similar basis with respect to Tax Returns that include the Company or its Subsidiaries, on the one hand, and Timken or any of its Affiliates (other than the Company and its Subsidiaries) on the other hand (individually "Consolidated Tax Returns", and, together with the returns described in clause (A) above, the "Income Tax Returns"). Timken shall provide to the Buyer for review an extract of each Income Tax Return to the extent relevant to the Buyer under this Agreement no later than forty-five (45) days prior to the date on which such Income Tax Return is required to be filed with the proper taxing authority (taking into account any applicable valid extension). The Buyer shall have the right to review or to cause to be reviewed all non-privileged information used to prepare such extract of such Tax Return and Timken shall make reasonably available to the Buyer and its representatives the accountants who participated in the preparation of each such Income Tax Return. Timken shall consider in good faith any reasonable comments by the Buyer that are submitted no less than thirty (30) days prior to the due date of such Tax Return. Timken and the Buyer agree to consult and resolve in good faith any issues arising as a result of the Buyers review of such Tax Return and mutually to consent to the filing of such Tax Return as promptly as possible. Upon completion of any Income Tax Return (other than Consolidated Tax Returns) in accordance with the provisions hereof, the Buyer shall file (or cause to be filed) such Income Tax Return (other than Consolidated Tax Returns) and Timken shall make (or cause to be made) all payments required 

    ##### 

 

  

to be made as set forth in such Income Tax Return on behalf of the Company to
the extent that such payments were not accrued in the calculation of Final
Working Capital, all as required by applicable Law. Neither the Buyer, the
Company or its Subsidiaries, nor any of their respective Affiliates, shall
file, amend or revoke any Tax Return or Tax election of the Company or its
Subsidiaries with respect to a period ending on or prior to the Closing Date,
without Timkens prior written consent. If Timken determines that the Company
or its Subsidiaries is entitled to file or make a formal or informal claim
for refund or file an amended Tax Return providing for a refund with respect
to a period for which it is obligated to prepare or cause to be prepared the
original of such Tax Return pursuant to this _Section 7.6(a)_, Timken shall
be entitled to file or make such claim or amended Tax Return on behalf of the
Company or its Subsidiaries and Timken will be entitled to control
the prosecution of such refund claims after the Closing. Timken shall be
entitled to any Tax refunds or reductions in Tax liability, including
interest paid therewith, in respect of Taxes paid by the Company or its
Subsidiaries with respect to a taxable period or portion thereof ending on
or before the Closing Date. After the Closing, Timken, at Timkens expense,
may require the Buyer to cause the Company or its Subsidiaries to file for a
Tax refund to which Timken would be entitled pursuant to the preceding
sentence, provided that the Buyer believes that it is more likely than not
that such a refund claim is warranted. Timken shall be entitled to control the
prosecution of such claim at its own expense, and the Buyer will cooperate
with Timken in any such Tax refund matters. 

   

 (ii) The Buyer shall prepare and file, or cause to be prepared and filed, in accordance with the provisions of this _Section 7.6_, all Tax Returns relating to Taxes of the Company and its Subsidiaries for all taxable periods that begin prior to and end after the Closing Date (a "Straddle Period") required to be filed by the Company and its Subsidiaries (or any Affiliate of the Company or its Subsidiaries) on or after the Closing Date (the "Straddle Period Tax Returns"). The Buyer shall provide or cause to be provided to Timken for review a draft of each Straddle Period Tax Return no later than forty-five (45) days prior to the date on which such Straddle Period Tax Return is required to be filed with the proper taxing authority (taking into account any applicable valid extension). Timken shall have the right to review or to cause to be reviewed all non-privileged information used to prepare each Straddle Period Tax Return and the Buyer shall make reasonably available to Timken and its representatives the Buyers accountants who participated in the preparation of each Straddle Period Tax Return The Buyer shall consider in good faith any reasonable comments by Timken that are submitted no less than thirty (30) days prior to the due date of such Tax Return. The Buyer and Timken agree to consult and resolve in good faith any issue arising as a result of Timkens review of such Straddle Period Tax Return and mutually to consent to the filing of such Straddle Period Tax Return as promptly as possible. 

  

 (iii) Except as specifically provided in _Sections_ _7.6(a)(i)_ and _(ii)_ , the Buyer shall prepare and file (or cause to be prepared and filed) all other Tax Returns required to be filed by or on behalf of the Company and its Subsidiaries with respect to any taxable period whether commencing or ending prior to, on or after the Closing Date. Any such Tax Return that includes periods ending on or before the Closing Date shall be on a basis consistent with the last previous such Tax Return filed in respect of the Company and its Subsidiaries, unless the Buyer concludes that it is more likely than not that the position will not be sustained. To the extent that any Tax payable pursuant to any such Tax Return is attributable to any period prior to the Closing, Timken shall be responsible for the payment of such Tax to the extent not 

   ##### 

  

    

accrued in the calculation of Final Working Capital (if any such Tax Return
relates to a Straddle Period, the Taxes due pursuant to such Tax Return shall
be apportioned between the Buyer and Timken as provided in _Section
7.6(a)(iv)_ hereof). 

  

 (iv) Liability for Taxes of the Company and its Subsidiaries attributable to any Straddle Period shall be apportioned between the Buyer and Timken as follows: (A) in the case of sales or use Taxes, value-added Taxes, employment Taxes and any Tax measured on or by income, receipts or profits earned during a Straddle Period, Timken shall be responsible for all Taxes for the taxable period prior to the Closing to the extent not accrued in the calculation of Final Working Capital and the Buyer shall be responsible for all Taxes for the taxable period following the Closing, and (B) in the case of all other Taxes, Timken shall be responsible for such amount as is equal to the total amount of such Taxes multiplied by a fraction, the numerator of which shall be the number of days in the taxable period ending on the Closing Date and the denominator of which shall be the total number of days in such taxable period, to the extent that such amount is not accrued in the calculation of Final Working Capital, and the Buyer shall be responsible for the remainder of such Taxes. For purposes of this _Section 7.6(a)(iv)_, any exemption, deduction, credit or other item that is calculated on an annual basis shall be allocated on a pro rata basis. 

  

 (v) Nothing set forth in this _Section 7.6(a)_ shall in any way limit the Companys or its Subsidiaries representations and warranties set forth in _Article IV_ of this Agreement or the Indemnified Persons rights to indemnification pursuant to _Article IX_ of this Agreement. 

  

 (b) _Timing Adjustment_. In the event that a final determination (which shall include the execution of an IRS Form 870-AD or successor form) results in a timing difference (e.g., an acceleration of income or delay of deductions) that would increase Timkens liability for Taxes pursuant to this Agreement or otherwise or results in a timing difference (e.g., an acceleration of deductions or delay of income) that would increase the Buyers liability for Taxes pursuant to this Agreement or otherwise, the Buyer or Timken, as the case may be, shall promptly make payments to Timken or the Buyer, as the case may be, as and when the Buyer or Timken, as the case may be, actually realizes any Tax benefits as a result of such timing difference (or under such other method for determining the present value of any such anticipated Tax benefits as agreed to by the parties). Such Tax benefit for federal, state and local income Tax purposes shall be computed for any year using the Buyers or Timkens, as the case may be, actual tax liability with and without giving effect to such timing difference. 

   

 (c) _Cooperation_. The parties shall cooperate fully, as and to the extent reasonably requested by the other parties, in connection with the preparation and filing of any Tax Returns with respect to or on behalf of the Company and its Subsidiaries or an Action with respect to any Tax Liability of the Company and its Subsidiaries (each, a "Tax Proceeding"). Such cooperation shall include the reasonable retention and provision of records and information which are reasonably relevant to any such Tax Return or Tax Proceeding and making employees available on a mutually convenient basis to provide additional information and explanation of any material provided hereunder. Notwithstanding the foregoing, with respect to any Tax Proceeding relating to a taxable period ending on or before the Closing Date or relating to or affecting a Consolidated Tax Return, Timken shall control all proceedings and   ##### 

  

  

  

may make all decisions taken in connection with such Tax Proceeding
(including selection of counsel) and may either pursue or forgo any and all
administrative appeals, proceedings, hearings and conferences with any taxing
authority with respect thereto and may pay the Tax claimed and sue for a
refund; _provided_ that Timken may not enter into any settlement that
adversely affects the Tax liability of the Buyer and its Affiliates without
the prior written consent of the Buyer (such consent not to be
unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed). The Buyer shall be entitled
to be reasonably informed of any such Tax Proceeding. With respect to any Tax
Proceeding other than those relating to a taxable period ending on or before
the Closing Date or relating to or affecting a Consolidated Tax Return, the
Buyer shall have the right to represent the interests of the Company in any
Tax Proceeding for any taxable period beginning after the Closing Date at its
sole cost and expense (subject to the provisions of _Article IX_);
_provided_ that the Buyer may not enter into any settlement that adversely
affects the Tax liability of Timken and its Affiliates or would result in an
indemnification obligation by Timken hereunder without the prior written
consent of Timken (such consent not to be unreasonably withheld, conditioned
or delayed). If, upon resolution of any Tax Proceeding, an additional payment
becomes due, the party so responsible for such payment in accordance with the
provisions of this _Section 7.6_ shall promptly make such payment. 

   

 (d) _Carryforwards and Carrybacks_. The Buyer shall cause the Company and its Subsidiaries to elect, when permitted by Law, to carry forward and to waive any right to carryback any net operating loss, credit or other item arising after the Closing Date that could, in the absence of such an election or waiver, be carried back to a taxable period of the Company or its Subsidiaries, ending on or before the Closing Date in which the Company or its Subsidiaries was included in a Consolidated Tax Return of Timken. If any net capital loss, foreign tax credit or research and development credit arising after the Closing Date shall be carried back to any such period, the Buyer shall indemnify Timken and its Affiliates for all reasonable costs and expenses incurred by Timken or its Affiliates in filing such claims or in connection with any audit of such claims and for any Losses resulting from the adjustment, reduction or disallowance of any such capital losses or credits. 

   

 (e) _Refunds_. Timken shall be entitled to retain, or receive immediate payment from the Buyer or any of its Affiliates of, any Tax refunds received or reductions in Tax liability, including interest paid therewith, with respect to a taxable period or portion thereof ending on or before the Closing Date relating to the Company and its Subsidiaries;  _provided_ , _however_ , that the Buyer shall be entitled to retain, or receive payment from Timken of, any such refund or credit to the extent that such refund or credit arises as a result of the use or application (as provided in _Section 7.6(d)_) of any net capital loss, foreign tax credit or research and development credit of the Company and its Subsidiaries generated during any post-Closing tax period and carried to any pre-Closing tax period of the Company and its Subsidiaries. Timken and the Buyer shall equitably apportion any refund or credit with respect to Taxes with respect to a Straddle Period in a manner consistent with the principles set forth in _Section 7.6(a)(iv)_. 

   

 (f) _Section 338(h)(10) Election_. 

   

 (i) Timken and the Buyer shall jointly make an election under Section 338(h)(10) of the Code and, if permissible, similar elections under any applicable state 

   ##### 

  

    

or local income tax Laws (collectively a "Section 338(h)(10) Election"), with
respect to the acquisition by the Buyer of the Shares. The Buyer, Timken, the
Company and OHandR shall report the transaction in a manner consistent with the
Section 338(h)(10) Election and agree not to take any action that could
cause such election to be invalid, and shall take no position contrary
thereto unless required to do so pursuant to a determination (as defined in
Section 1313(a) of the Code) or any similar state or local tax provision. 

  

 (ii) Upon the request of the Buyer, Timken shall execute and deliver to the Buyer within twenty (20) days of Buyers written request any and all forms necessary to effectuate the Section 338(h)(10) Election (including, without limitation, IRS Form 8023 and any similar forms under applicable state and local income tax Laws (the "Section 338 Forms"); _provided_ ,  _however_ , that upon Timkens delivery of an executed IRS Form 8023 as required hereby, the Buyer shall pay to Timken, in cash and as additional consideration, the amount of the Tax Adjustment as determined under clause (iv) below. The Buyer, Timken, the Company and OHandR shall each cause the Section 338 Forms to be duly executed by an authorized person and shall duly and timely file the Section 338 Forms in accordance with applicable tax Laws and the terms of this Agreement. 

  

 (iii) As soon as practicable after the Closing Date, Timken and the Buyer shall agree on the fair market value of the assets of the Company and OHandR and the allocation of the deemed sales price of the assets of the Company and OHandR resulting from the Section 338(h)(10) Election (as required pursuant to Section 338(h)(10) of the Code and regulations promulgated thereunder) among such assets (the "Section 338 Allocation"). The Buyer, Timken, the Company and OHandR shall file all Tax Returns consistently with the Section 338 Allocation. 

  

 (iv) As a condition precedent to Timken making a Section 338(h)(10) Election, the Buyer shall pay to Timken, in cash, the amount of additional consideration necessary to cause Timkens after-Tax net proceeds from the sale with the Section 338(h)(10) Election to be equal to the after-Tax net proceeds that Timken would have received had the Section 338(h)(10) Election not been made, taking into account all appropriate federal, state, and local implications, up to a maximum amount not to exceed $3,000,000 (the "Tax Adjustment"). The amount of the Tax Adjustment shall be paid to Timken prior to or at the time Timken signs IRS Form 8023 to make the Section 338(h)(10) Election. Timken shall provide the Buyer with a schedule computing the amount of the Tax Adjustment within twenty (20) days after the parties have agreed to the Section 338 Allocation. In making such calculations, the highest corporate federal and state tax rates to which Timken is subject shall be used and any other items of income, deduction, gain, loss, or credits of Timken shall be ignored. The Buyer shall have the right to review such schedule and Timken shall consider in good faith any reasonable comments by the Buyer that are submitted within ten (10) days after receipt of such schedule.

terms, the Company, Timken and Timken Alloy shall not, nor shall any of them
permit any of their respective Subsidiaries or any of their respective
officers, directors, employees, representatives or agents of the Company,

or negotiations with, or provide any information to or take any other action
with the intent to facilitate the efforts of, any Person concerning any
possible Acquisition Proposal or any inquiry or communication which might

consolidation, recapitalization, liquidation or other direct or indirect
business combination or reorganization of the Company or its Subsidiaries or
the issuance or acquisition of shares of capital stock or other securities of
the Company or its Subsidiaries, or the sale, lease, exchange, license

 (b) In addition to the other obligations of the Company set forth in this _Section 7.7_ , the Company shall promptly advise Buyer orally and in writing of any Acquisition Proposal, any request for information with respect to any Acquisition Proposal, or any inquiry with respect to or which would reasonably be expected to result in an Acquisition Proposal, the material terms and conditions of such request, Acquisition Proposal or inquiry, and the identity of the Person making the same.

 (a) For a period of 180 days following the Closing, Buyer, the Company and their respective Affiliates shall have the right to use the Names (as hereinafter defined) in connection with the Companys business, provided that such use is reasonably consistent with the use of such Names by the Company prior to the Closing. Without limiting the foregoing, Buyer, the Company and their respective Affiliates shall have the right to (i) sell inventory and (ii) use existing packaging, signs, labeling, containers, stationery, business forms, supplies, advertising and promotional materials and any similar materials bearing the Names; _provided_ , _however_ _,_ that when using the items listed in clause (ii) above in the context of entering into or conducting contractual relationships, Buyer, the Company and their respective Affiliates shall use their commercially reasonable efforts to inform other parties that Buyer, the Company or any of their respective Affiliates, rather than Timken or its Affiliates, is the party entering into or conducting the contractual relationship; _provided_ _further_ _,_ _however_ _,_ that personnel of Buyer, the Company and their respective Affiliates using the above items shall not, and shall have no authority to, hold themselves out as officers, employees or agents of Timken or any Affiliate of Timken. Buyer, the Company and their respective Affiliates shall comply in all material respects with all applicable Laws in any use of packaging or labeling containing the Names.

Prior to the Closing, Buyer shall submit to Timken its intended compensation and benefits package for the Salaried Employees in accordance with this paragraph for approval, which Timken shall not unreasonably withhold. In no event shall the obligation of the Buyer under this paragraph limit or restrict its right in any way to terminate the employment of any Non-Union Employee at any time following the Closing. For purposes of eligibility and vesting under any benefit plan of the Buyer or its Affiliates which is a "pension plan" within the meaning of Section 3(2) of ERISA (a "Buyer Pension Plan"), Buyer shall cause to be recognized all service credited to Non-Union Employees and Union Employees under the Employee Plans as of the Closing Date, other than to Non-Union Employees who, prior to December 22, 2006, elect to retire under The Timken-Latrobe-MPB-Torrington Retirement Plan effective as of the date of such election ("Retiring Non-Union Employees"). Buyer shall be under no obligation to cause the Retiring Non-Union Employees service to be so recognized under a Buyer Pension Plan. 

  

 (ii) Buyer shall assume the obligations of the Company under the collective bargaining agreement with the United Steel Workers of America (the "CBA"), to the extent that the CBA covers the Union Employees immediately prior to the date of Closing, for the remainder of the current term of the CBA and, in accordance therewith, shall maintain the Latrobe Steel Company Pension Plan for Hourly Paid Employees (the "Latrobe Hourly Plan") established for the benefit of the Union Employees under the terms of the CBA. As soon as practicable following the Closing Date, but no sooner than when Buyer has established a trust (or trusts) for such plan, Timken shall cause the trustee for the master trust holding the assets of the Latrobe Hourly Plan to transfer the assets of such plan in the form of cash (or other marketable assets acceptable to Buyer, which shall not include Timken stock of any class) from the master trust to a trust (or trusts) maintained or established by the Company for such plan that is tax-exempt under Section 501(a) of the Code. Such transfer shall be effected by (x) the transfer, on the Business Day immediately following the Closing Date to a trust established by Buyer, of an amount equal to ninety percent (90%) of the value of the assets of the Latrobe Hourly Plan, determined as of October 31, 2006, and (y) the further transfer, as soon as practicable but not later than December 22, 2006, of an amount equal to the difference between the value of the assets of the Latrobe Hourly Plan, determined by the trustee of such plan as of 

   ##### 

  

    

December 8, 2006, and the amount transferred pursuant to clause (x). Timken
shall cause the master trustee to provide Buyer with all
pertinent information, reports and records of the master trustee requested by
Buyer, documenting the value of the assets of the Latrobe Hourly Plan and the
transfer of same as set forth in this _Section 7.9(a)(ii)_. Notwithstanding
any other provision of this Agreement to the contrary, any transfer of the
Latrobe Hourly Plan assets shall be effected in accordance with all
applicable Laws. 

  

 (iii) Prior to and contingent on the Closing and the consent by the United Steel Workers of America, Timken shall cause the Company to transfer sponsorship of the Voluntary Investment Program for Hourly Employees of Latrobe Steel Company (the "Latrobe VIP") to Timken.

Except with respect to the Assumed Plans and subject to _Section 7.18(d)_ hereof, and to the extent that liability is imposed on the Company and its Subsidiaries by virtue of having been an ERISA Affiliate of Timken, Timken shall remain responsible for all liabilities and obligations relating to each Employee Plan including liabilities and obligations under Part 6 of Subtitle B of Title I of ERISA, whether such liabilities arise before, on or after the Closing Date. Timken shall offer continuation coverage under Part 6 of Subtitle B of Title I of ERISA to any Retiring Non-Union Employee upon such Retiring Non-Union Employees retirement. 

  

 (ii) Except as provided in _Section 7.9(b)(i)_, coverage for all Non-Union Employees and their respective spouses and dependents under the Employee Plans that are "welfare benefit plans" within the meaning of Section 3(1) of ERISA ("Seller Welfare Plans") shall cease to be effective on December 31, 2006, except for coverage for short-term disability and severance benefits, which shall cease to be effective as of the Closing Date. On and after January 1, 2007, Buyer shall cause the Company and its Subsidiaries to provide coverage and benefits for all Non-Union Employees and their respective eligible spouses and dependents under a plan or plans sponsored by Buyer, the Company or its Subsidiaries that are "welfare benefit plans" within the meaning of Section 3(1) of ERISA (such plans collectively, "Buyers Welfare Plans"), except for coverage for short-term disability and severance benefits, which shall be effective as of the Closing Date. The Buyer shall use commercially reasonable efforts to cause any applicable insurers or third party service providers to waive any pre-existing condition limitations and eligibility waiting periods with respect to Non-Union Employees and their respective spouses and dependents under the Buyers Welfare Plans (but only to the extent such pre-existing condition limitations and eligibility waiting periods were satisfied under the Employee Plans as of the Closing Date) and to recognize (or cause to be recognized) the dollar amount of all deductibles, co-payments, co-insurance and out-of-pocket limitations incurred with respect to Non-Union Employees and their respective spouses and 

   ##### 

  

    

dependents under the Employee Plans during the calendar year in which the
Closing occurs for purposes of satisfying the corresponding deductibles, co-
payment, co-insurance or out-of-pocket limitations for such calendar year
under the corresponding Buyer Welfare Plan in which the Non-Union Employees
become entitled to participate after the Closing Date. Coverage for all Union
Employees and their respective spouses and dependents under Seller Welfare
Plans shall be provided in accordance with Part 6 of the Transition Services
Agreement through December 31, 2006.

Affiliates who are reasonably expected to be helpful with respect to such
Action, provided that, such employees shall be made available in a manner so

Buyer shall replace any Back-Up Letter of Credit in effect at the Closing as promptly as practicable after the Closing but no later than December 15, 2006. From and after the Closing, the Buyer Indemnifying Persons shall indemnify, defend and hold harmless the Timken Indemnified Persons from and against any and all Losses arising out of or resulting from any payments made by such Timken Indemnified Persons under the Guarantees or Letters of Credit to the extent not replaced or reimbursed through a Back-Up Letter of Credit.

For as long as any Guarantee or Letter of Credit remains in effect, the Company shall deliver to Timken audited financial statements and quarterly unaudited financial statements of the Company and its consolidated subsidiaries at the same time as such financial statements are delivered to the Companys senior lenders. The Company shall also provide Timken with such other financial information with regard to the Company and its Subsidiaries as Timken may reasonably request in order for Timken to determine the proper accounting of its obligations under the Guarantee and with respect to the Letters of Credit. Timken shall keep such financial statements and other financial information confidential and shall not use such financial statements or other financial information for any purpose other than the purpose described in the immediately preceding sentence.

The Company shall pay or cause to be paid such 2006 bonuses in accordance with such calculation on or before March 15, 2007. If the 2006 Bonus Amount exceeds $2,858,000, then Timken shall pay the Company an amount equal to such excess within ten (10) Business Days after the Companys payment of the 2006 Bonus Amount to the employees of the Company and its Subsidiaries.

 9.4 _Assertion of Claims_. 

  

 (a) To bring a claim for indemnification under this _Article IX_, the Indemnified Person shall give the appropriate Indemnifying Person(s) written notice of the existence of any such claim, specifying the nature and basis of such claim and the amount thereof, to the extent known, and, if such claim arises from a Third Party Claim as defined in _Section 9.5_, accompanied by copies of all relevant documentation with respect to such Third Party Claim, including, without limitation, any summons, complaint or other pleading that may have been served, any written demand or any other document or instrument (each, a "Notice of Claim") in each case, as promptly as practicable after becoming aware of such claim. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the failure so to provide such Notice of Claim will not relieve the Indemnifying Person(s) from any Liability which they may have to the Indemnified Persons under this Agreement or otherwise (unless and only to the extent that such failure results in the loss or compromise in any material respect of any material rights or defenses of the Indemnifying Persons and the Indemnifying Persons were not otherwise aware of such action or claim). Notwithstanding the foregoing, no claim shall be brought under this _Article IX_ with respect to an Event of Indemnification described in  _Section 9.2(a)(i)_, _9.2(a)(ix)_ or _9.2(b)(i)_ unless an applicable Indemnified Person, at any time prior to the applicable Survival Date, gives an applicable Indemnifying Person a Notice of Claim with respect to such claim. If a Notice of Claim has been given on or prior to the applicable Survival Date, the relevant representations and warranties shall survive as to such claim until the claim has been finally resolved. 

   

 (b) In the case of a claim for indemnification not arising from a Third Party Claim, if the Indemnifying Person disputes its liability with respect to such claim, in whole or in part, the Indemnifying Person and the Indemnified Person shall proceed in good faith to negotiate a resolution of such dispute and, if not resolved through negotiations, such dispute shall be resolved by litigation in an appropriate court of competent jurisdiction in accordance with  _Section 11.11_. 

   

 9.5 _Defense of Third Party Claims_. Claims arising from the assertion of liability by third parties (each, a "Third Party Claim") shall be subject to _Section 9.4(a)_ and the following terms and conditions: 

  

 (a) Upon receipt of a Notice of Claim delivered in accordance with _Section 9.4(a)_ and relating to a Third Party Claim, the Indemnifying Person shall then have   ##### 

  

  

  

twenty (20) days to advise the Indemnified Person whether the Indemnifying
Person accepts the defense of such claim, and the Indemnifying Person shall
have no obligation to the Indemnified Person for legal fees incurred by the
Indemnified Person after the date of any assumption of the defense by the
Indemnifying Person; _provided_ , _however_ , that (i) an Indemnifying Person
may only assume control of such defense if it acknowledges in writing to the
Indemnified Person that any such Losses that may be assessed against the
Indemnified Person in connection with such Third Party Claim constitute
Losses for which the Indemnified Party shall be indemnified pursuant to this
_Article IX_ and (ii) the Indemnifying Person may not assume control of
the defense of any Action involving a Third Party Claim for criminal
liability or in which non-monetary equitable relief is sought against the
Indemnified Party. 

   

 (b) If the Indemnifying Person determines to accept the defense of such Third Party Claim, it shall defend such Third Party Claim with counsel of its own choice that is reasonably satisfactory to the Indemnified Person and at its own expense, provided that, the Indemnified Person shall have the right to be represented by its own counsel at its own expense, its participation to be subject to reasonable direction of counsel for the Indemnifying Person. If the Indemnifying Person fails to undertake the defense of any such Third Party Claim within twenty (20) days after the Indemnified Person has given written notice to the Indemnifying Person of the claim, then the Indemnified Person may defend such Third Party Claim at the sole cost of the Indemnifying Person and the Indemnifying Person may still participate in, but not control, the defense of such Third Party Claim at the Indemnifying Persons sole cost and expense, such participation to include the right to participate in but not control all significant decisions regarding such Third Party Claims (including the right to participate in but not control settlement discussions with respect thereto). 

   

 (c) The party controlling the defense of a Third Party Claim may settle such Third Party Claim on any terms which it may deem reasonable, provided that, (i) an Indemnifying Person shall not without the Indemnified Persons prior written consent, settle or compromise such proceeding, claim or demand, or consent to the entry of any judgment which does not include as an unconditional term thereof the delivery by the claimant or plaintiff to the Indemnified Person of a written release from all liability in respect of such proceeding, claim or demand and (ii) an Indemnified Person shall not without the Indemnifying Persons prior written consent, which consent will not be unreasonably be withheld or delayed, settle or compromise any such proceeding, claim or demand, or consent to the entry of any judgment. 

   

 9.6 _Exclusive Remedy_. Subject to _Section 9.3(b)_ and _Section 11.13_, the indemnification provisions of this _Article IX_ shall be the exclusive remedy following the Closing for any breaches or alleged breaches of any representation, warranty, covenant or agreement set forth in this Agreement. The Buyer Indemnified Persons expressly waive any and all rights and remedies against the Timken Indemnifying Persons under CERCLA and other Environmental Laws. Nothing in the immediately preceding sentence shall constitute a waiver of any of the Buyer Indemnified Parties rights under this Agreement. Subject to _Section 9.3(b)_, each of the parties hereto agrees not to bring any actions or proceedings, at Law, equity or otherwise, against any Indemnifying Person in respect of any breaches or alleged breaches of any representation, warranty, covenant or agreement contained in this Agreement except pursuant to the express provisions of this _Article IX_ and _Section 11.13_.

 9.7 _Survival of Representations, Warranties and Covenants_. The representations and warranties made by the parties in this Agreement shall survive the Closing Date (or, in the case of the representations and warranties made by Timken Alloy in _Article_ V, the Deferred Closing Date) for a period of eighteen (18) months; _provided_ , _however_ , that the representations and warranties set forth in _Sections_ _4.2_ , _4.4_ , _4.5_ ,  _4.8(b)_ , _4.9,_ _4.17_ (other than _Section 4.17(g))_, _4.30_ ,  _5.2_ , _5.4_ , _5.7_ , _6.3_ , _6.5_ , and _6.10_ and the first sentence of _Section 4.10_ shall survive the Closing until sixty (60) days following the expiration of the applicable statute of limitations (including any extension thereof);  _provided_ _further_ , _however_ , that the representations and warranties set forth in _Section 4.21_ and the indemnity set forth in _Section 9.2(a)(xviii)_ shall survive the Closing Date for a period of seven (7) years, the representations and warranties set forth in _Section 4.17(g)_ shall survive the Closing Date for a period of three (3) years and the representations and warranties set forth in _Section 6.8_ shall terminate at Closing. For convenience of reference, the date upon which any representation or warranty contained herein shall terminate is referred to herein as the "Survival Date." Unless otherwise expressly set forth in this Agreement, the covenants and agreements set forth in this Agreement shall survive the Closing and remain in effect indefinitely. 

  

 9.8 _Environmental Claims_. 

  

 (a) Provided that it does not disrupt Buyers business in any material respect, the Buyer Indemnified Persons agree to cooperate with Timken and to take all commercially reasonable actions to avoid and minimize Losses that would otherwise be subject to indemnification under Article IX regarding Environmental Laws or Hazardous Substances. During the indemnity period, Buyers claims for indemnification related to contamination arising out of sampling or testing or solicitation or importuning of any Governmental Authority to require any environmental correction, investigation, monitoring or remediation shall apply only if there is a reasonable basis to believe that there is a violation of an Environmental Law necessitating such sampling, testing, solicitation or importuning, or if required by any Governmental Authority. 

   

 (b) In addition to any other limitations on indemnification that may apply, with respect to any claim for indemnification Buyer Indemnified Persons may assert regarding Environmental Laws or Hazardous Substances, Timken shall not have any obligation with respect to such claim to the extent that the Losses for which indemnification is sought (i) arise out of any action not required by Environmental Law or by a Governmental Authority or any action to meet a cleanup standard that is more stringent or costly than required by Environmental Law for the continued use of any property as it was last used by the Company or for any other industrial purpose reasonably consistent with such use that occurred as of the Closing Date (unless the Buyer Indemnified Persons agree to reimburse Timken for the excess costs), or (ii) are ordinary costs of any post-Closing construction, demolition, capital improvements, repair or replacement of equipment or renovation of facilities on the Real Property, including any asbestos abatement obligations arising from such activities. 

   

 (c) It is a condition precedent to any right of Buyer Indemnified Persons to indemnification regarding Environmental Laws or Hazardous Substances that before beginning any investigation, sampling, testing, remediation or other action for which the costs are anticipated to be $15,000 or more in the aggregate, Buyer Indemnified Persons shall notify   ##### 

  

  

  

Timken as soon as reasonably practicable of such claim and afford Timken the
opportunity to evaluate the conditions giving rise to such claim and to
request that it take over such work. Provided that Timken has the resources
available to do so and is capable of performing the work within a
commercially reasonable timeframe, all as reasonably determined after taking
into account potential disruption of Buyers business in any material
respect, Buyer shall afford Timken the opportunity to perform the
investigation, sampling, testing, remediation or other action required under
Environmental Law (including any negotiation with Governmental Authorities
regarding the same) that is the subject of the indemnification claim of the
Buyer Indemnified Persons. 

   

 (d) In the event Timken undertakes the work referred to in _Section 9.8(c)_, Timken shall cause such work to be performed in a commercially, reasonable timeframe and with a qualified environmental professional, all subject to Buyers reasonable oversight participation and reasonable approval. Timken shall use all commercially reasonable efforts to avoid any undue interference with operations of Buyer, and, subject to an access agreement in customary form, Buyer shall afford Timken and its agents reasonable access to the Real Property to undertake such work and shall work with Timken to minimize the costs to Timken provided that such cost minimization does not materially disrupt Buyers business. 

   

 (e) If Timken does not assume control for undertaking actions pursuant to _Section 9.8(d)_ or if Buyer refuses to grant its approval for Timken to undertake actions pursuant to  _Section 9.8(d)_, then the Buyer Indemnified Persons shall undertake (subject to Timkens right to participate and receive information) to complete such actions subject to all other provisions and limitations in this Agreement, including this _Section 9.8_. 

   

 (f) While Timken has an indemnification obligation for environmental matters hereunder, Buyer Indemnified Persons shall, at Timkens reasonable request, impose reasonable environmental deed or use restrictions, and/or accept Timkens installation of reasonable engineering controls on the Real Property, provided that such restrictions or controls do not prevent or inhibit any industrial use of the Real Property reasonably consistent with such use that occurred as of the Closing Date.. 

   

 9.9 _Insurance_. The amount of any Losses suffered by Indemnified Persons shall be reduced by any insurance proceeds which such party or its representatives actually receives in respect of or as a result of such Losses or the facts or circumstances relating thereto net of any increased costs to such Indemnified Person for insurance premiums attributable to such claim,  _provided_ , _however_ , that no Indemnified Person shall be obligated to seek any payment pursuant to the terms of any insurance policy in respect of any Loss.
