consistent with the Working Capital example set forth in <U>Section&nbsp;4.8(d)</U> of the Disclosure
Schedule (&#147;<B>Estimated Working Capital</B>&#148;). If the Working Capital Target exceeds the Estimated
Working Capital, the Purchase Price shall be reduced by an amount equal to the amount by which the
Working Capital Target exceeds the Estimated Working Capital. If the Estimated Working Capital
exceeds the Working Capital Target, the Purchase Price shall be increased by an amount equal to
the amount by which the Estimated Working Capital exceeds the Working Capital Target. The
Estimated Working Capital shall be subject to review by Buyer, and Timken and Buyer will cooperate
and negotiate in good faith to resolve any dispute regarding the Estimated Working Capital;
<U>provided</U> that if any item of dispute regarding the Estimated Working Capital is not
resolved by agreement in writing between Timken and Buyer prior to the Closing Date, then Timken&#146;s

forth the Working Capital as of the Closing prepared in a manner consistent with the Working
Capital example set forth in <U>Section&nbsp;4.8(d)</U> of the Disclosure Schedule. Within forty-five
(45)&nbsp;days following receipt by Timken of the Closing Working Capital Statement, Timken shall
deliver written notice to Buyer containing a reasonably detailed description of any dispute it has
with respect to the content of the Closing Working Capital Statement; <U>provided</U>,
<U>however</U>, that Timken may not dispute the accounting principles and adjustments used in
preparing the Closing Working Capital Statement if they are consistent with the Working Capital
example set forth in <U>Section&nbsp;4.8(d)</U> of the Disclosure Schedule. If Timken does not notify
Buyer of a dispute with respect to the Closing Working Capital Statement within such forty-five
(45)&nbsp;day period, the Closing Working Capital Statement will be final, conclusive and binding on
the parties. In the event of such notification of a dispute, Buyer and Timken shall negotiate in
good faith to resolve such dispute. If Buyer and Timken, notwithstanding such good faith effort,
fail to resolve such dispute within thirty (30)&nbsp;days after Timken provides Buyer with written
notice of its objections, then Buyer and Timken jointly shall engage the firm of
PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP to resolve such dispute, and if PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP is unwilling
or unable to serve in such capacity, then Buyer and Timken jointly shall engage the firm of
Deloitte &#038; Touche LLP, and if Deloitte &#038; Touche LLP is unwilling or unable to serve in such

one of the parties positions as to each disputed item based solely upon the presentation by Buyer

Person shall give the appropriate Indemnifying Person(s) written notice of the existence of any
such claim, specifying the nature and basis of such claim and the amount thereof, to the extent
known, and, if such claim arises from a Third Party Claim as defined in <U>Section&nbsp;9.5</U>,
accompanied by copies of all relevant documentation with respect to such Third Party Claim,
including, without limitation, any summons, complaint or other pleading that may have been served,
any written demand or any other document or instrument (each, a &#147;<B>Notice of Claim</B>&#148;) in each case,
as promptly as practicable after becoming aware of such claim. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the
failure so to provide such Notice of Claim will not relieve the Indemnifying Person(s) from any
Liability which they may have to the Indemnified Persons under this Agreement or otherwise (unless
and only to the extent that such failure results in the loss or compromise in any material respect
of any material rights or defenses of the Indemnifying Persons and the Indemnifying Persons were
not otherwise aware of such action or claim). Notwithstanding the foregoing, no claim shall be
brought under this <U>Article&nbsp;IX</U> with respect to an Event of Indemnification described in
<U>Section&nbsp;9.2(a)(i)</U>, <U>9.2(a)(ix)</U> or <U>9.2(b)(i)</U> unless an applicable
Indemnified Person, at any time prior to the applicable Survival Date, gives an applicable
Indemnifying Person a Notice of Claim with respect to such claim. If a Notice of Claim has been
given on or prior to the applicable Survival Date, the relevant representations and warranties
shall survive as to such claim until the claim has been finally resolved.

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<B>11.8 </B><U><B>Governing Law</B></U>. This Agreement shall be governed by, and construed and enforced
in accordance with, the Laws of the State of New York without regard to its rules of conflict of
laws, and the Laws of England and Wales with respect to the matters set forth in <U>Sections</U>
<U>2.9(d)</U>, <U>(g)</U> and <U>(h)</U>.

unenforceable in any jurisdiction shall, as to that jurisdiction, be ineffective to the extent of
such invalidity or unenforceability without rendering invalid or unenforceable the remaining terms
and provisions of this Agreement or affecting the validity or enforceability of any of the terms or
provisions of this Agreement in any other jurisdiction. If any provision of this Agreement is so
broad as to be unenforceable, the provision shall be interpreted to be only so broad as is
enforceable.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<B>11.10 </B><U><B>Mutual Drafting</B></U>. This Agreement is the result of the joint efforts of Buyer and
Timken, and each provision hereof has been subject to the mutual consultation, negotiation and

presumption of that party&#146;s involvement in the drafting thereof.

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<B>11.11 </B><U><B>Consent to Jurisdiction and Service of Process</B></U>. The parties hereto hereby
submit to the jurisdiction of the courts of State of New York or the courts of the United States
located in the State of New York in respect of the interpretation and enforcement of the provisions
of this Agreement and any Related Agreement, certificate or other document delivered in connection
herewith and hereby waive, and agree not to assert, any defense in any action, suit or proceeding
for the interpretation or enforcement of this Agreement and any Related Agreement, certificate or
other document delivered in connection herewith, that they are not subject thereto or that such
action, suit or proceeding may not be brought or is not maintainable in such courts or that this
Agreement may not be enforced in or by such courts or that their property is exempt or immune from
execution, that the suit, action or proceeding is brought in an inconvenient forum, or that the
venue of the suit, action or proceeding is improper. Service of process with respect thereto may
be made upon Buyer by mailing a copy thereof by registered or certified mail, postage prepaid, to
such party at its address as provided in <U>Section&nbsp;11.3</U> hereof.

cumulative. The transactions contemplated by this Agreement are unique transactions and any
failure on the part of any party to complete the transactions contemplated by this Agreement on the
terms of this Agreement will not be fully compensable in damages and the breach or threatened
breach of the provisions of this Agreement would cause the other parties hereto irreparable harm.
Accordingly, in addition to and not in limitation of any other remedies available to the parties
hereto for a breach or threatened breach of this Agreement, the parties shall be entitled to seek
specific performance of this Agreement and seek an injunction restraining any such party from such
