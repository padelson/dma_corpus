MERGER CONSIDERATION; EXCHANGE PROCEDURES

 

Section 3.1 _Holdings Exchange and Contribution_.

 

(a) At the Effective Time, in exchange for the consideration described in
Section 3.1(b), Holdings hereby agrees to distribute to the holders of the
Common Units the Holdings LP Units pro rata, with such distribution to be made
pursuant to Section 3.4(a) as a component of the Holdings Unitholder
Consideration (defined below). In addition, Holdings agrees to (i)
exchange with Inergy the Incentive Distribution Rights and (ii) contribute to
Inergy all of Holdings ownership interests in IPCH and Inergy Partners. The
exchange and contribution set forth in (i) and (ii) above are collectively
referred to herein as the "GP Exchange."

(b) At Closing, as consideration for the GP Exchange, Inergy will (i)
deposit or cause to be deposited with the Exchange Agent for exchange in
accordance with this Article III, through the Exchange Agent, 35,031,991 LP
Units, subject to adjustment for equity awards granted under the Holdings LTIP
(which together with the Holdings LP Units are referred to as the "New LP
Units") and 11,568,560 special units of Inergy having such rights, preferences
and limitations as are set forth in the Inergy Amended and Restated
Partnership Agreement (the "PIK Units"), (ii) provide cash to be paid in lieu
of any fractional New LP Unit or PIK Unit, as applicable, in accordance with
Section 3.4(e), and (iii) assume Holdings liabilities under the Holdings
Credit Agreements (the "Inergy Debt Assumption"). The New LP Units and PIK
Units and any cash paid in lieu of any fractional New LP Unit or PIK Unit are
collectively referred to herein as the "Holdings Unitholder Consideration."
Holdings hereby acknowledges and agrees that the deposit of the Holdings
Unitholder Consideration and the Inergy Debt Assumption shall constitute
complete satisfaction of all sums due to Holdings with respect to the GP
Exchange.

 

(c) Upon the GP Exchange, without further action by Inergy prior to the
Effective Time, the Incentive Distribution Rights shall be cancelled and have
no further force or effect and the 789,202 LP Units owned by IPCH and the
2,837,034 LP Units and 0.71% general partner interest in Inergy owned by
Inergy Partners shall be converted into Class A Units of equivalent value. 



 

A-9 Section 3.2 _Holdings Unitholder Consideration_. Subject to the provisions of
this Agreement, at the Effective Time, by virtue of the Merger and without any
action on the part of Inergy, Holdings or any holder of Common Units:

 

(a) All of the limited liability company interests in MergerCo outstanding
immediately prior to the Effective Time shall be converted into and become
limited partner interests in Holdings, which limited partner interests shall
be duly authorized and validly issued, fully paid (to the extent required
under the Holdings Partnership Agreement and the Holdings Amended and
Restated Partnership Agreement) and non-assessable (except to the extent such
non-assessability may be affected by Sections 17-303, 17-607 and 17-804 of the
DRULPA), and shall be held by New NRGP LP and Holdings GP in proportion to
their respective NRGP Nonparticipating Limited Partner Units.

(b) The general partner interest and NRGP Nonparticipating Limited Partner
Units in Holdings issued and outstanding immediately prior to the Effective
Time shall remain outstanding and unchanged subject to such changes as are set
forth in the Holdings Amended and Restated Partnership Agreement, and Holdings
GP shall continue to be the sole general partner of Holdings.

(c) Each Common Unit issued and outstanding immediately prior to the Effective
Time shall be converted into the right to receive 0.770 LP Units, except that
with respect to the 11,568,560 LP Units to which the PIK Recipients otherwise
would be entitled pursuant to the Merger, the respective PIK Recipients shall
instead receive the PIK Units in accordance with _Annex C_. Such right to
receive 0.770 LP Units shall be satisfied upon the receipt of the Holdings
Unit Consideration as provided in Section 3.4.

 

(d) All Common Units, when converted as a result of and pursuant to the
Merger, shall cease to be outstanding and shall automatically be canceled and
cease to exist. At the Effective Time, each holder of a certificate
representing Common Units (a "Certificate") and each holder of non-
certificated Common Units represented by book-entry ("Book-Entry Units")
shall cease to be a unitholder of Holdings and (except as set forth in
Section 3.3) cease to have any rights with respect thereto, except the right
to receive (i) such holders portion of the Holdings Unitholder Consideration,
including any cash to be paid in lieu of any fractional New LP Unit or PIK
Unit, as applicable, in accordance with Section 3.4(e), and the right to be
admitted as a limited partner of Inergy in connection therewith, and (ii) any
distributions in accordance with Section 3.4(c), and in each case, to be
issued or paid in consideration therefor in accordance with Section 3.4.

 

Section 3.3 _Rights As Unitholders; Unit Transfers_. At the Effective Time,
holders of Common Units shall cease to be, and shall have no rights as,
unitholders of Holdings, other than to receive (a) any distribution with
respect to such Common Units with a record date occurring prior to the
Effective Time that may have been declared or made by Holdings on such Common
Units in accordance with the terms of this Agreement or prior to the date of
the Original Agreement and which remains unpaid at the Effective Time and (b)
the consideration provided under this Article III. After the Effective Time,
there shall be no transfers on the unit transfer books of Holdings with
respect to the Common Units.

 Section 3.4 _Exchange of Certificates_.

(a) _Exchange Agent_. Promptly after the Effective Time, Inergy and Holdings
shall deposit or shall cause to be deposited with the Exchange Agent for the
benefit of the holders of Common Units, for exchange in accordance with this
Article III, through the Exchange Agent, the Holdings Unitholder
Consideration required by this Article III (with Holdings depositing or
causing to be deposited the Holdings LP Units and the PIK Units and Inergy
depositing the remainder of the Holdings Unitholder Consideration). Inergy
agrees to make available to the Exchange Agent, from time to time as needed,
cash sufficient to pay any distributions pursuant to Section 3.3(a) and
Section 3.4(c) and to make payments in lieu of any fractional New LP Units and
PIK Units, as applicable, pursuant to Section 3.4(e). Any cash, New LP Units
and PIK Units deposited with the Exchange Agent (including as payment for any
fractional New LP Units and PIK Units in accordance with Section 3.4(e) 



 

A-10  and any distributions in accordance with Section 3.4(c)) shall hereinafter
be referred to as the "Exchange Fund." The Exchange Agent shall, pursuant to
irrevocable instructions, deliver the Holdings Unitholder Consideration
contemplated to be paid for Common Units pursuant to this Agreement out of the
Exchange Fund. Except as contemplated by Sections 3.4(c) and 3.4(e), the
Exchange Fund shall not be used for any other purpose.

(b) _Exchange Procedures_. Promptly after the Effective Time, Inergy shall
instruct the Exchange Agent to mail to each record holder of Common Units as
of the Effective Time (i) a letter of transmittal (which shall specify that in
respect of certificated units, delivery shall be effected, and risk of loss
and title to the Certificates shall pass, only upon proper delivery of the
Certificates to the Exchange Agent, and shall be in customary form and agreed
to by Inergy and Holdings prior to the Effective Time) and (ii) instructions
for use in effecting the surrender of the Certificates or Book-Entry Units in
exchange for the Holdings Unitholder Consideration payable in respect of the
Common Units represented by such Certificates or Book-Entry Units. Promptly
after the Effective Time, upon surrender of Certificates, if any,
for cancellation to the Exchange Agent together with such letters of
transmittal, properly completed and duly executed, and such other documents
(including in respect of Book-Entry Units) as may be required pursuant to such
instructions, the holders of Common Units shall be entitled to receive in
exchange therefor (A) New LP Units or PIK Units, as applicable, representing,
in the aggregate, the whole number of New LP Units or PIK Units, as
applicable, that such holder has the right to receive pursuant to this
Article III (after taking into account all Common Units then held by such
holder) and (B) a check in the amount equal to the aggregate amount of cash
that such holder has the right to receive pursuant to this Article
III, including cash payable in lieu of any fractional New LP Units and PIK
Units pursuant to Section 3.4(e) and distributions pursuant to Section 3.4(c).
No interest shall be paid or accrued on any Holdings Unitholder Consideration
or on any unpaid distributions payable to holders of Certificates or Book-
Entry Units. In the event of a transfer of ownership of Common Units that is
not registered in the transfer records of Holdings, the Holdings Unitholder
Consideration payable in respect of such Common Units may be paid to a
transferee, if the Certificate representing such Common Units or evidence of
ownership of the Book-Entry Units are presented to the Exchange Agent, and in
the case of both certificated and book-entry Common Units, accompanied by all
documents required to evidence and effect such transfer and the Person
requesting such exchange shall pay to the Exchange Agent in advance any
transfer or other Taxes required by reason of the delivery of the
Holdings Unitholder Consideration in any name other than that of the record
holder of such Common Units, or shall establish to the satisfaction of the
Exchange Agent that such Taxes have been paid or are not payable. Until the
required documentation has been delivered and Certificates, if any, have been
surrendered, as contemplated by this Section 3.4, each Certificate or Book-
Entry Unit shall be deemed at any time after the Effective Time to represent
only the right to receive, upon such surrender, the Holdings Unitholder
Consideration payable in respect of the Common Units and any cash in lieu of
fractional units pursuant to Section 3.4(e) and any distributions to which
such holder is entitled pursuant to Section 3.3. 

(c) _Distributions with Respect to Unexchanged Common Units_. No distributions
declared or made with respect to LP Units or PIK Units with a record date
after the Effective Time shall be paid to the holder of any Common Units with
respect to the New LP Units or PIK Units, as applicable, that such holder
would be entitled to receive in accordance herewith and no cash payment in
lieu of fractional New LP Units or PIK Units, as applicable, shall be paid to
any such holder until such holder shall deliver the required documentation and
surrender any Certificate as contemplated by this Section 3.4. Subject
to applicable Law, following compliance with the requirements of Section
3.4(b), there shall be paid to such holder of the New LP Units or PIK Units,
as applicable, issuable in exchange therefor, without interest, (i) promptly
after the time of such compliance, the amount of any cash payable in lieu of
fractional New LP Units or PIK Units, as applicable, to which such holder is
entitled pursuant to Section 3.4(e) and the amount of distributions with a
record date after the Effective Time theretofore paid with respect to the New
LP Units or PIK Units, as applicable, and payable with respect to such New LP
Units or PIK Units, as applicable, and (ii) at the appropriate payment date,
the amount of distributions with a record date after the Effective Time but
prior to such surrender and a payment date subsequent to such compliance
payable with respect to such New LP Units or PIK Units, as applicable.

 



 

A-11 (d) _Further Rights in Holdings Units_. The Holdings Unitholder Consideration
issued upon conversion of a Common Unit in accordance with the terms hereof
(including any cash paid pursuant to Section 3.3, Section 3.4(c) or Section
3.4(e)) shall be deemed to have been issued in full satisfaction of all rights
pertaining to such Common Unit.

(e) _Fractional LP Units_. No certificates or scrip of the New LP Units or PIK
Units, as applicable, representing fractional New LP Units or PIK Units, as
applicable, or book-entry credit of the same shall be issued upon the exchange
of Common Units in accordance with Section 3.4(b), and such fractional
interests will not entitle the owner thereof to vote or to have any rights as
a holder of any New LP Units or PIK Units, as applicable. Notwithstanding any
other provision of this Agreement, each holder of Common Units exchanged in
connection with the Merger who would otherwise have been entitled to receive
a fraction of a New LP Unit or PIK Unit, as applicable (after taking into
account all Common Units exchanged by such holder), shall receive, in lieu
thereof, cash (without interest, rounded up to the nearest whole cent) in an
amount equal to the product of (i) the volume weighted average trading price
of the LP Units as reported by Bloomberg during the 20 trading day period
ending on the third trading day immediately preceding the date on which
the Effective Time shall occur and (ii) the fraction of a New LP Unit or PIK
Unit, as applicable, that such holder would otherwise be entitled to receive
pursuant to this Article III. As promptly as practicable after the
determination of the amount of cash, if any, to be paid to holders of
fractional interests, the Exchange Agent shall so notify Inergy, and Inergy
shall deposit such amount with the Exchange Agent and shall cause the Exchange
Agent to forward payments to such holders of fractional interests subject to
and in accordance with the terms hereof.

(f) _Termination of Exchange Fund_. Any portion of the Exchange Fund
constituting New LP Units, PIK Units or cash that remains undistributed to the
holders of Common Units after 180 days following the Effective Time shall be
delivered to Inergy upon demand by Inergy and, from and after such delivery,
any former holders of Common Units who have not theretofore complied with this
Article III shall thereafter look only to Inergy for the Holdings Unitholder
Consideration payable in respect of such Common Units, any cash in lieu
of fractional New LP Units or PIK Units, as applicable, to which they are
entitled pursuant to Section 3.4(e) and any distributions with respect to the
New LP Units or PIK Units, as applicable, to which they are entitled pursuant
to Section 3.4(c), in each case, without any interest thereon. Any amounts
remaining unclaimed by holders of Common Units immediately prior to such time
as such amounts would otherwise escheat to or become the property of any
governmental entity shall, to the extent permitted by applicable Law, become
the property of Inergy, free and clear of any Liens, claims or interest of any
Person previously entitled thereto.

 

(g) _No Liability_. To the fullest extent permitted by Law, neither Inergy,
Holdings, nor the Surviving Entity shall be liable to any holder of Common
Units for any New LP Units (or distributions with respect thereto), PIK Units,
or cash from the Exchange Fund delivered to a public official pursuant to any
abandoned property, escheat or similar Law.

 

(h) _Lost Certificates_. If any Certificate shall have been lost, stolen or
destroyed, upon the making of an affidavit of that fact by the Person
claiming such Certificate to be lost, stolen or destroyed and, if required by
Inergy, the posting by such Person of a bond, in such reasonable amount as
Inergy may direct, as indemnity against any claim that may be made against it
with respect to such Certificate, the Exchange Agent shall pay in exchange
for such lost, stolen or destroyed Certificate the Holdings Unitholder
Consideration payable in respect of the Common Units represented by such
Certificate and any distributions to which the holders thereof are entitled
pursuant to Section 3.3.

(i) _Withholding_. Each of Inergy, the Surviving Entity and the Exchange
Agent shall be entitled to deduct and withhold from the consideration
otherwise payable pursuant to this Agreement to any holder of Common Units
such amounts as Inergy, the Surviving Entity or the Exchange Agent is
required to deduct and withhold under the Code or any provision of state,
local, or foreign Tax Law, with respect to the making of such payment;
provided, however, that Inergy, the Surviving Entity or the Exchange Agent, as
the case may be, shall provide reasonable notice to the applicable holders of
Common Units prior to withholding any amounts pursuant to this



 

A-12  Section 3.4(i). To the extent that amounts are so deducted and withheld by
Inergy, the Surviving Entity or the Exchange Agent, such amounts shall be
treated for all purposes of this Agreement as having been paid to the holder
of Common Units in respect of whom such deduction and withholding was made by
Inergy, the Surviving Entity or the Exchange Agent, as the case may be.

 

(j) _Book Entry and Admission of Holders of New LP Units and PIK Units as
Additional Limited Partners of Inergy_. All New LP Units and PIK Units to be
issued in connection with the Merger shall be issued in book entry form,
without physical certificates. Upon the issuance of New LP Units and PIK
Units, as applicable, to the holders of Common Units in accordance with
this Section 3.4 and the compliance by such holders with the requirements of
Section 10.4 of the Inergy Amended and Restated Partnership Agreement, Inergy
GP shall consent to the admission of such holders as limited partners of
Inergy and reflect such admission on the books and records of Inergy.

Section 3.5 _Anti-Dilution Provisions_. In the event of any subdivisions,
reclassifications, recapitalizations, splits, combinations or distributions in
the form of equity interests with respect to the Common Units or the LP Units
(in each case, as permitted pursuant to Section 4.3), the number of New LP
Units or PIK Units, as applicable, to be issued in connection with the Merger
and the volume weighted average trading price of the LP Units determined in
accordance with Section 3.4(e) will be correspondingly adjusted to provide
the holders of the New LP Units or PIK Units, as applicable, the same economic
effect as contemplated by this Agreement prior to such event.

 

Section 3.6 _Unit Options and Restricted Units_.

 

(a)(i) Except as provided in Sections 3.6(b) and 3.6(c), at the Effective
Time, each right to purchase Common Units (a "Holdings Unit Option"), whether
vested or unvested, and each Common Unit subject to a forfeiture period (a
"Holdings Restricted Unit") outstanding immediately prior to the Effective
Time shall be assumed by Inergy and converted into an option to purchase LP
Units or an Inergy Restricted LP Unit, as applicable, in accordance with this
Section 3.6(a) to be issued pursuant to the Amended and Restated Inergy Long-
Term Incentive Plan (the "Inergy LTIP"). Each Holdings Unit Option and
Holdings Restricted Unit as so assumed and converted shall continue to have,
and be subject to, the same terms and conditions as set forth in the Amended
and Restated Inergy Holdings, L.P. Long Term Incentive Plan (the "Holdings
LTIP") and any agreements thereunder immediately prior to the Effective Time,
except that, as of the Effective Time, (A) (i) each Holdings Unit Option as so
assumed and converted shall be exercisable for that number of whole LP Units
equal to the product of the number of Common Units that were subject to such
Holdings Unit Option immediately prior to the Effective Time multiplied by
0.770, rounded down to the nearest whole number of LP Units, and (ii) the per
unit exercise price for the LP Units subject to such assumed Holdings Unit
Option as so assumed and converted shall be equal to the quotient determined
by dividing the exercise price per Common Unit of such Holdings Unit Option
immediately prior to the Effective Time by 0.770, rounded up to the nearest
whole cent and (B) each Holdings Restricted Unit as so assumed shall be
converted into that number of Inergy Restricted LP Units with respect to whole
LP Units equal to the product of the number of Common Units that were subject
to such Holdings Restricted Unit immediately prior to the Effective Time
multiplied by 0.770, rounded down to the nearest whole number of LP Units. It
is intended that Holdings Unit Options assumed and converted into options to
acquire LP Units in accordance with the foregoing shall be converted in a
manner that satisfies the requirements of Treasury Regulation §
1.409A-1(b)(5)(v)(D) so as not to be treated as the grant of a new stock right
or change in the form of payment for purposes of Treasury Regulations §§

following the Effective Time.

 

(ii) As soon as practicable after the Effective Time, Inergy shall deliver to
the participants in the Holdings LTIP appropriate notice setting forth such
participants rights pursuant thereto and the grants pursuant to the Holdings
LTIP shall continue in effect on the same terms and conditions (subject to the
adjustments required by this Section 3.6 after giving effect to the Merger).

(iii) The Holdings GP Board (or appropriate committee thereof) shall, prior
to or as of the Effective Time, take all necessary actions, if any, pursuant
to and in accordance with the terms of the Holdings LTIP

 



 

A-13  and the instruments evidencing Holdings Unit Options or the Holdings
Restricted Units, as applicable, to provide for the assumption and conversion
of Holdings Unit Options into options to acquire LP Units or the Holdings
Restricted Units into Inergy Restricted LP Units, as applicable in accordance
with this Section 3.6 without the consent of the holders of the Holdings Unit
Options or the Holdings Restricted Units, as applicable. 

(b) Prior to the Effective Time and except as provided in Section 3.6(c), the
Holdings GP Board (or, if appropriate, any committee thereof) and the Inergy
GP Board (or, if appropriate, any committee thereof) shall adopt appropriate
resolutions and take all other actions necessary to provide that, effective at
the Effective Time, each right to purchase Common Units outstanding
immediately prior to the Effective Time (a "Holdings Unit Purchase Right")
under the Holdings Unit Purchase Plan shall be assumed by Inergy and shall
continue in effect on the same terms and conditions as in effect
immediately prior to the Effective Time (subject to the adjustments in this
Section 3.6(b)), and each such Holdings Unit Purchase Right shall be converted
automatically into a right to purchase LP Units (a "New LP Purchase Right").

number of LP Units determined under the terms and conditions of the Holdings
Unit Purchase Plan, as provided for herein. Effective at the Effective Time,
Inergy (i) shall assume the Holdings Unit Purchase Plan, (ii) shall amend the
Holdings Unit Purchase Plan to substitute references to LP Units for

make such other changes as shall be necessary to assume the Holdings Unit
Purchase Plan and New LP Purchase Right pursuant to this Section 3.6(b), and

LP Purchase Rights. The Holdings Unit Purchase Plan shall terminate

in the Amended and Restated Inergy Employee Unit Purchase Plan pursuant
to their elections in effect under the Holdings Unit Purchase Plan
immediately prior to its termination unless such election is otherwise changed

Purchase Plan.

 

(c) To the extent any employee of Inergy GP, LLC holds rights to purchase
Common Units prior to the Effective Time that will be, but for application of
this Section 3.6(c), converted into rights to purchase LP Units pursuant to
Sections 3.6(a) and 3.6(b), the Holdings GP Board (or, if appropriate, any
committee thereof) and/or the Inergy GP Board (or, if appropriate,
any committee thereof) will take such actions as may be necessary or
appropriate to avoid the imposition of additional taxes on such employees
pursuant to Section 409A of the Code.

 

(d) Inergy shall take all action necessary, on or prior to the Effective Time,
to authorize and to reserve for issuance a sufficient number of LP Units for
delivery under the Inergy LTIP and the Holdings Unit Purchase Plan in
accordance with this Section 3.6. As soon as practicable after the Effective
Time, Inergy shall file a registration statement on Form S-8 (or
any successor or other appropriate forms), with respect to the LP Units
subject to the assumed Holdings Unit Options and New LP Purchase Rights, and
shall use all reasonable efforts to maintain the effectiveness of such
registration statement or registration statements (and maintain the current
status of the prospectus or prospectuses contained therein) for so long as
such options remain outstanding.

applicable stock exchange rules and the Holdings Partnership Agreement, all
action necessary to call, hold and convene promptly after the date hereof an
appropriate meeting of the holders of Common Units of Holdings to consider
and vote upon the approval of the Merger, the approval and adoption of this
Agreement, and any other matters required to be approved by Holdings
unitholders for consummation of the Merger (including any adjournment or
postponement, the "Holdings Meeting"). Subject to Section 6.6(c), the Holdings
GP Board shall recommend approval of the Merger, this Agreement and the
transactions contemplated hereby to the holders of Common Units
(the "Holdings Recommendation"), and Holdings shall take all reasonable
lawful action to solicit such approval by the holders of Common Units.
Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the contrary, in the event of a
Holdings Change in Recommendation (as defined in Section 6.6(c)), Holdings
shall not be required to call, hold or convene the Holdings Meeting.

 

Section 6.3 _Registration Statement_.

 

(a) Each of Inergy and Holdings agrees to cooperate in the preparation of a
registration statement on Form S-4 (the "Registration Statement") (including
the proxy statement and prospectus and other proxy solicitation materials of
Holdings constituting a part thereof (the "Proxy Statement") and all related
documents) to be filed by Inergy with the SEC in connection with the issuance
of New LP Units and the PIK Units in the Merger as contemplated by this
Agreement. Provided Holdings has cooperated as required above, Inergy agrees
to file the Registration Statement with the SEC as promptly as practicable.
Each of Holdings and Inergy agrees to use all commercially reasonable best
efforts to cause the Registration Statement to be declared effective under the
Securities Act as promptly as practicable after filing thereof. Inergy also
agrees to use commercially reasonable best efforts to obtain all necessary
state securities law or "Blue Sky" permits and approvals required to carry out

 



 

A-21  the transactions contemplated by this Agreement. Each of Inergy and Holdings
agrees to furnish to the other party all information concerning Inergy, Inergy
GP and its Subsidiaries or Holdings, Holdings GP and its Subsidiaries, as
applicable, and the officers, directors and unitholders of Inergy and Holdings
and any applicable Affiliates, as applicable, and to take such other action as
may be reasonably requested in connection with the foregoing.

(b) Each of Holdings and Inergy agrees, as to itself and its Subsidiaries,
that (i) none of the information supplied or to be supplied by it for
inclusion or incorporation by reference in the Registration Statement will, at
the time the Registration Statement and each amendment or supplement thereto,
if any, becomes effective under the Securities Act, contain any untrue
statement of a material fact or omit to state any material fact required to be
stated therein or necessary to make the statements therein, in light of the
circumstances under which they were made, not misleading, and (ii) the Proxy
Statement and any amendment or supplement thereto will, at the date of mailing
to Holdings unitholders and at the time of the Holdings Meeting, not contain
any untrue statement of a material fact or omit to state any material
fact required to be stated therein or necessary to make the statements
therein, in light of the circumstances under which they were made, not
misleading. Each of Holdings and Inergy further agrees that if it shall become
aware prior to the Closing Date of any information that would cause any of
the statements in the Registration Statement to be false or misleading with
respect to any material fact, or omit to state any material fact necessary to
make the statements therein, in light of the circumstances under which they
were made, not false or misleading, it will promptly inform the other party
thereof and take the necessary steps to correct such information in an
amendment or supplement to the Registration Statement.

 

(c) Inergy will advise Holdings, promptly after Inergy receives notice
thereof, of the time when the Registration Statement has become effective or
any supplement or amendment has been filed, of the issuance of any stop order
or the suspension of the qualification of the New LP Units and the PIK Units
for offering or sale in any jurisdiction, of the initiation or threat of
any proceeding for any such purpose, or of any request by the SEC for the
amendment or supplement of the Registration Statement or for additional
information.

 

(d) Holdings will use its commercially reasonable best efforts to cause the
Proxy Statement to be mailed to its unitholders as soon as practicable after
the effective date of the Registration Statement; _provided, however_ , that
Holdings shall not be obligated to cause such mailing to occur in the event of
a Holdings Change in Recommendation.

 

Section 6.4 _Press Releases_. Prior to the termination of this Agreement
pursuant to Article VIII or a Holdings Change in Recommendation, if any, each
of Holdings and Inergy will not, without the prior approval of the Holdings GP
Board and Holdings Conflicts Committee in the case of Holdings and the Inergy
GP Board and Inergy Special Committee in the case of Inergy, issue any press
release or written statement for general circulation relating to the
transactions contemplated hereby, except as otherwise required by applicable
Law or the rules of the NYSE, in which case it will consult with the other
party before issuing any such press release or written statement.

Section 6.5  _Access; Information_.

(a) Upon reasonable notice and subject to applicable Laws relating to the
exchange of information, each party shall, and shall cause its Subsidiaries
to, afford the other parties and their officers, employees, counsel,
accountants and other authorized representatives, access, during normal
business hours throughout the period prior to the Effective Time, to all of
its properties, books, contracts, commitments and records, and to its
officers, employees, accountants, counsel or other representatives, and,
during such period, it shall, and shall cause its Subsidiaries to,
furnish promptly to such Person and its representatives (i) a copy of each
material report, schedule and other document filed by it pursuant to the
requirements of federal or state securities law (other than reports or
documents that Holdings or Inergy or their respective Subsidiaries, as the
case may be, are not permitted to disclose under applicable Law) and (ii) all
other information concerning the business, properties and personnel of it as
the other may reasonably request. Neither Holdings nor Inergy nor any of
their respective Subsidiaries shall be required to provide access to or to
disclose information where such access or disclosure

 



 

A-22  would jeopardize the attorney-client privilege of the institution in
possession or control of such information or contravene any Law, fiduciary
duty or binding agreement entered into prior to the date of the Original
Agreement. The parties hereto will make appropriate substitute disclosure
arrangements under the circumstances in which the restrictions of the
preceding sentence apply.

 

(b) Inergy and Holdings, respectively, will not use any information obtained
pursuant to this Section 6.5 (to which it was not entitled under Law or any
agreement other than this Agreement) for any purpose unrelated to (i) the
consummation of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement or (ii) the
matters contemplated by Section 6.6 in accordance with the terms thereof, and
will hold all information and documents obtained pursuant to this Section 6.5
in confidence. No investigation by either party of the business and affairs of
the other shall affect or be deemed to modify or waive any representation,
warranty, covenant or agreement in this Agreement, or the conditions to either
partys obligation to consummate the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement.

 

Section 6.6 _Acquisition Proposals; Change in Recommendation_.

 

(a) Commencing on the sixty-first (61st) calendar day after the Proxy
Statement is first filed with the SEC, none of Holdings GP, Holdings and its
Subsidiaries shall, and they shall use their commercially reasonable best
efforts to cause their Representatives not to, directly or indirectly, (i)
knowingly initiate, solicit or encourage the submission of any
Acquisition Proposal, or (ii) participate in any discussions or negotiations
regarding, or furnish to any person any non-public information with respect
to, any Acquisition Proposal. Notwithstanding the foregoing, but subject to
the limitations in Section 6.6(b), nothing contained in this Agreement shall
prohibit Holdings GP, Holdings, their Subsidiaries or any of their
Representatives from furnishing any information to, including information
pertaining to Inergy, or entering into or participating in discussions or
negotiations with, any person that makes a solicited (prior to the 61st
calendar day after the Proxy Statement is first filed with the SEC) or an
unsolicited written Acquisition Proposal that did not result from a knowing
and intentional breach of this Section 6.6 (a "Receiving Party"), if (i) the
Holdings GP Board, after consultation with its outside legal counsel and
financial advisors, determines in good faith (A) that such Acquisition
Proposal constitutes or is likely to result in a Superior Proposal, and (B)
that failure to take such action would be inconsistent with its fiduciary
duties under the Holdings Partnership Agreement and applicable Law and (ii)
prior to furnishing any such non-public information to such Receiving Party,
Holdings receives from such Receiving Party an executed Confidentiality
Agreement, _provided, however_ , that if Holdings receives an Acquisition
Proposal that includes an Inergy Acquisition Proposal, Holdings may, in its
discretion, respond to a Receiving Party to indicate that Holdings cannot
entertain an Acquisition Proposal that includes an Inergy Acquisition
Proposal.

 

(b) Holdings may provide any Receiving Party with any non-public information
or data pertaining to Inergy (the "Inergy Non-Public Information") only if
Holdings has not knowingly and intentionally breached this Section 6.6 and
then only if (i) the Holdings GP Board determines in good faith, after
consultation with its outside legal counsel and financial advisors that the
provision of such Inergy Non-Public Information to the Receiving Party could
possibly lead to a Holdings Change in Recommendation and (ii) Holdings shall
have first (A) required the Receiving Party to execute a
Confidentiality Agreement, which Confidentiality Agreement shall, to the
extent Inergy Non-Public Information is to be furnished to the Receiving
Party, expressly provide that Inergy shall be a third party beneficiary of
such Confidentiality Agreement with respect to the enforcement thereof in
respect of the Inergy Non-Public Information to be so furnished, (B) furnished
a copy of such Confidentiality Agreement to Inergy and (C) notified Inergy of
the identity of such Receiving Party. Holdings shall promptly provide or make
available to Inergy any non-public information concerning Holdings or any of
its Subsidiaries that is provided or made available to any Receiving Party
pursuant to this Section 6.6 which was not previously provided or made
available to Inergy. Inergy shall provide to Holdings and any Receiving Party
that has executed a Confidentiality Agreement any Inergy Non-Public
Information that Holdings reasonably requests in exercising its rights under
this Section 6.6. Holdings shall not provide to any Receiving Party, and
Inergy shall not be required to provide to any Receiving Party, in each case
pursuant to this Section 6.6, any information pertaining to Inergy where
Holdings knows that the provision of such information would (x) jeopardize
the attorney-client privilege of the institution in possession or control of
such information or (y) contravene any Law or binding agreement entered into
prior to the date of the Original Agreement.



 

A-23 (c) Except as otherwise provided in this Section 6.6(c), the Holdings GP Board
shall not (1) (a) withdraw, modify or qualify in any manner adverse to Inergy
the Holdings Recommendation or (b) publicly approve or recommend, or publicly
propose to approve or recommend, any Acquisition Proposal (any action
described in this clause (1) being referred to as a "Holdings Change in
Recommendation"); or (2) approve, adopt or recommend, or publicly propose to
approve, adopt or recommend, or allow Holdings or any of its Subsidiaries to
execute or enter into, any letter of intent, memorandum of understanding,
agreement in principle, merger agreement, acquisition agreement, option
agreement, joint venture agreement, partnership agreement, or other similar
contract or any tender or exchange offer providing for, with respect to, or
in connection with, any Acquisition Proposal. Notwithstanding the foregoing,
at any time prior to obtaining the Holdings Unitholder Approval, the Holdings
GP Board may make a Holdings Change in Recommendation if it has concluded in
good faith, after consultation with its outside legal counsel and financial
advisors, that failure to make a Holdings Change in Recommendation would be
inconsistent with its fiduciary duties under the Holdings Partnership
Agreement and applicable Law; _provided, however_ , that the Holdings GP
Board shall not be entitled to exercise its right to make a Holdings Change in
Recommendation pursuant to this sentence unless Holdings and Holdings GP have:
(w) complied in all material respects with this Section 6.6, (x) provided to
Inergy and the Inergy Special Committee two (2) Business Days prior written
notice (such notice, a "Notice of Proposed Recommendation Change") advising
Inergy that the Holdings GP Board intends to take such action and specifying
the reasons therefor in reasonable detail, including, if applicable, the terms
and conditions of any Superior Proposal that is the basis of the proposed
action and the identity of the Person making the proposal and
contemporaneously providing a copy of all relevant proposed transaction
documents for such Superior Proposal (it being understood and agreed that any
amendment to the terms of any such Superior Proposal shall require a new
Notice of Proposed Recommendation Change and an additional two (2) Business
Day period), (y) during such two (2) Business Day period, engaged in good
faith negotiations with Inergy to amend this Agreement in such a manner
that obviates the need for such Holdings Change in Recommendation, which
actions include, without limitation, providing such amendment(s) to this
Agreement to the Holdings Conflicts Committee for its review and
consideration, and (z) if applicable, provided to Inergy all materials and
information delivered or made available to the Person or group of persons
making any Superior Proposal in connection with such Superior Proposal (to the
extent not previously provided). Any Holdings Change in Recommendation shall
not change the approval of this Agreement or any other approval of the
Holdings GP Board, including in any respect that would have the effect of
causing any state (including Delaware) corporate takeover statute or other
similar statute to be applicable to the transactions contemplated hereby or
thereby, including the Merger. Notwithstanding any provision in this Agreement
to the contrary, Inergy and Inergy GP shall maintain, and cause their
Representatives to maintain, the confidentiality of all information received
from Holdings pursuant to this Section 6.6, subject to the exceptions
contained in the Confidentiality Agreement.

 

(d) In addition to the obligations of Holdings set forth in this Section 6.6,
Holdings shall as promptly as practicable (and in any event within 24 hours
after receipt) advise Inergy orally (such oral advice to be promptly confirmed
in writing) of any Acquisition Proposal or any matter giving rise to a
Holdings Change in Recommendation and the material terms and conditions
of any such Acquisition Proposal or any matter giving rise to a Holdings
Change in Recommendation (including any changes thereto) and the identity of
the Person making any such Acquisition Proposal. Holdings shall keep Inergy
informed on a reasonably current basis of material developments with respect
to any such Acquisition Proposal or any matter giving rise to a Holdings
Change in Recommendation.

 

(e) Nothing contained in this Agreement shall prevent Holdings or the Holdings
GP Board from taking and disclosing to the holders of Common Units a position
contemplated by Rule 14d-9 and Rule 14e-2(a) promulgated under the Exchange
Act (or any similar communication to limited partners) or from making any
legally required disclosure to unitholders. Any "stop-look-and-listen"
communication by Holdings or the Holdings GP Board to the limited partners of
Holdings pursuant to Rule 14d-9(f) promulgated under the Exchange Act (or any
similar communication to the limited partners of Holdings) shall not be
considered a failure to make, or a withdrawal, modification or change in any
manner adverse to Inergy of, all or a portion of the Holdings Recommendation.

  

 

A-24 Section 6.7 _Affiliate Arrangements_.

 

(a) Not later than the 15th day after the mailing of the Proxy Statement,
Holdings shall deliver to Inergy a schedule of each person that, to its
knowledge, is or is reasonably likely to be, as of the date of the Holdings
Meeting, deemed to be an "affiliate" of Holdings (a "Rule 145 Affiliate") as
that term is used in Rule 145 under the Securities Act.

 

(b) Holdings shall use its commercially reasonable best efforts to cause its
Rule 145 Affiliates not to sell any securities received under the Merger in
violation of the registration requirements of the Securities Act, including
Rule 145 thereunder.

 Section 6.8 _Takeover Laws_. Neither party shall take any action that would
cause the transactions contemplated by this Agreement to be subject to
requirements imposed by any Takeover Laws, and each of them shall take all
necessary steps within its control to exempt (or ensure the continued
exemption of) the transactions contemplated by this Agreement from, or if
necessary challenge the validity or applicability of, any rights plan adopted
by such party or any applicable Takeover Law, as now or hereafter in effect,
including, without limitation, Takeover Laws of any state that purport to
apply to this Agreement or the transactions contemplated hereby.

 

Section 6.9 _No Rights Triggered_. Each of Holdings and Inergy shall take all
steps necessary to ensure that the entering into of this Agreement and the
consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby and any other action or
combination of actions, or any other transactions contemplated hereby, do not
and will not result in the grant of any Rights to any person (a) in the case
of Holdings under the Holdings Partnership Agreement, and in the case of
Inergy under the Inergy Partnership Agreement or (b) under any material
agreement to which it or any of its Subsidiaries is a party.

Section 6.10 _Units Listed_. In the case of Inergy, Inergy shall use
its commercially reasonable best efforts to list, prior to the Closing, on
the NYSE, upon official notice of issuance, the New LP Units, including LP
Units subject to issuance upon the conversion of PIK Units into LP Units in
accordance with their terms.

Section 6.11 _Third Party Approvals._

 

(a) Inergy and Holdings and their respective Subsidiaries shall cooperate and
use their respective commercially reasonable best efforts to prepare all
documentation, to effect all filings, to obtain all permits, consents,
approvals and authorizations of all third parties necessary to consummate the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement and to comply with the terms and
conditions of such permits, consents, approvals and authorizations and to
cause the Merger to be consummated and the Inergy Amended and Restated
Partnership Agreement to be effective as expeditiously as practicable. Each of
Inergy and Holdings shall have the right to review in advance, and to the
extent practicable each will consult with the other, in each case subject to
applicable Laws relating to the exchange of information, with respect to, all
material written information submitted to any third party or any Regulatory
Authorities in connection with the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement. In exercising the foregoing right, each of the parties hereto
agrees to act reasonably and promptly. Each party hereto agrees that it
will consult with the other parties hereto with respect to the obtaining of
all material permits, consents, approvals and authorizations of all third
parties and Regulatory Authorities necessary or advisable to consummate the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement, and each party will keep the
other parties apprised of the status of material matters relating to
completion of the transactions contemplated hereby.

 

(b) Each party agrees, upon request, to furnish the other party with all
information concerning itself, its Subsidiaries, directors, officers and
unitholders and such other matters as may be reasonably necessary or advisable
in connection with the Registration Statement, the Proxy Statement or any
filing, notice or application made by or on behalf of such other party or any
of such Subsidiaries to any Regulatory Authority in connection with the
transactions contemplated hereby.



 

A-25 Section 6.12 _Indemnification; Directors  and Officers Insurance_.

(a) Without limiting any additional rights that any current and former
director, officer, trustee, employee, agent, or fiduciary may have under any
employment or indemnification agreement or under the Holdings Partnership
Agreement, Holdings Amended and Restated Partnership Agreement, the Holdings
GP LLC Agreement, or this Agreement or, if applicable, similar organizational
documents or agreements of any of Holdings Subsidiaries, from and after the
Effective Time, Inergy shall: (i) indemnify and hold harmless each person who
is at the date of the Original Agreement or during the period from the date
of the Original Agreement through the date of the Effective Time serving as a
director or officer of Holdings, Holdings GP or any of their Subsidiaries, or
as a fiduciary under or with respect to any employee benefit plan (within the
meaning of Section 3(3) of ERISA), (collectively, the "Indemnified Parties")
to the fullest extent authorized or permitted by applicable Law, as now or
hereafter in effect, in connection with any Claim and any losses, claims,
damages, liabilities, costs, Indemnification Expenses, judgments, fines,
penalties and amounts paid in settlement (including all interest, assessments
and other charges paid or payable in connection with or in respect of any
thereof) resulting therefrom; and (ii) promptly pay on behalf of or, within
ten (10) days after any request for advancement, advance to each of the
Indemnified Parties, any Indemnification Expenses incurred in defending,
serving as a witness with respect to or otherwise participating with respect
to any Claim in advance of the final disposition of such Claim, including
payment on behalf of or advancement to the Indemnified Party of any
Indemnification Expenses incurred by such Indemnified Party in connection
with enforcing any rights with respect to such indemnification and/or
advancement, in each case without the requirement of any bond or other
security. The indemnification and advancement obligations of Inergy pursuant
to this Section 6.12(a) shall extend to acts or omissions occurring at or
before the Effective Time and any Claim relating thereto (including with
respect to any acts or omissions occurring in connection with the approval of
this Agreement, including approval at the Holdings Meeting, and the
consummation of the Merger and the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement, including the consideration and approval thereof and the process
undertaken in connection therewith and any Claim relating thereto), and all
rights to indemnification and advancement conferred hereunder shall continue
as to a person who has ceased to be a director or officer of Holdings,
Holdings GP or any of their Subsidiaries or as a fiduciary under or with
respect to any employee benefit plan (within the meaning of Section 3(3) of
ERISA) before or after the date of the Original Agreement and shall inure to
the benefit of such persons heirs, executors and personal and legal
representatives. As used in this Section 6.12(a): (x) the term "Claim" means
any threatened, asserted, pending or completed action, whether instituted by
any party hereto, any Governmental Authority or any other person, that any
Indemnified Party in good faith believes might lead to the institution of any
action or proceeding, whether civil, criminal, administrative, investigative
or other, including any arbitration or other alternative dispute resolution
mechanism ("Action"), arising out of or pertaining to matters that relate to
such Indemnified Partys duties or service as a director or officer of
Holdings, Holdings GP, any of their Subsidiaries, or as a fiduciary under or
with respect to any employee benefit plan (within the meaning of Section 3(3)
of ERISA) maintained by any of the foregoing at or prior to the Effective
Time; and (y) the term "Indemnification Expenses" means reasonable attorneys
fees and all other reasonable costs, expenses and obligations (including
experts fees, travel expenses, court costs, retainers, transcript fees,
duplicating, printing and binding costs, as well as telecommunications,
postage and courier charges) paid or incurred in connection
with investigating, defending, being a witness in or participating in
(including on appeal), or preparing to investigate, defend, be a witness in or
participate in, any Claim for which indemnification is authorized pursuant to
this Section 6.12(a), including any Action relating to a claim for
indemnification or advancement brought by an Indemnified Party. Inergy shall
not settle, compromise or consent to the entry of any judgment in any actual
or threatened Action in respect of which indemnification has been or could be
sought by such Indemnified Party hereunder unless such settlement, compromise
or judgment includes an unconditional release of such Indemnified Party from
all liability arising out of such Action without admission or finding of
wrongdoing, or such Indemnified Party otherwise consents thereto.

(b) Without limiting the foregoing, Inergy agrees that all rights to
indemnification, advancement of expenses and exculpation from liabilities for
acts or omissions occurring at or prior to the Effective Time now existing in
favor of the Indemnitees as provided in the Holdings Partnership Agreement
(or, as applicable, the charter, bylaws, partnership agreement, limited
liability company agreement, or other organizational documents of any of

 



 

A-26  Holdings Subsidiaries) and indemnification agreements of Holdings, Holdings
GP or any of their Subsidiaries shall be assumed by Inergy and Inergy GP in
the Merger, without further action, at the Effective Time and shall survive
the Merger and shall continue in full force and effect in accordance with
their terms.

 

(c) For a period of six (6) years from the Effective Time, the Inergy Amended
and Restated Partnership Agreement shall contain provisions no less favorable
with respect to indemnification, advancement of expenses and limitations on
liability of directors and officers than are set forth in the Holdings
Partnership Agreement, which provisions shall not be amended, repealed
or otherwise modified for a period of six (6) years from the Effective Time
in any manner that would affect adversely the rights thereunder of individuals
who, at or prior to the Effective Time, were Indemnified Parties, unless such
modification shall be required by Law and then only to the minimum extent
required by Law.

(d) Inergy shall maintain for a period of at least six (6) years following
the Effective Time, the current policies of directors and officers liability
insurance maintained by Holdings, Holdings GP and their Subsidiaries (
_provided_ , that Inergy may substitute therefor policies of at least the
same coverage and amounts containing terms and conditions which are not less
advantageous to such directors and officers of Holdings and Holdings GP than
the terms and conditions of such existing policy from carriers with the same
or better rating as the carrier under the existing policy provided that such
substitution shall not result in gaps or lapses of coverage with respect to
matters occurring before the Effective Time) with respect to claims arising
from facts or events that occurred on or before the Effective Time, including
in respect of the Merger and the transactions contemplated by this Agreement;
_provided_ , that Inergy shall not be required to pay annual premiums in
excess of 300% of the last annual premium paid by Holdings or Holdings GP
prior to the date of the Original Agreement but in such case shall purchase as
much coverage as reasonably practicable for such amount.

 

(e) The provisions of Section 6.12(d) shall be deemed to have been satisfied
if prepaid "tail" policies have been obtained by Inergy for purposes of this
Section 6.12 from carriers with the same or better rating as the carrier of
such insurances as of the date of the Original Agreement, which policies
provide such directors and officers with the coverage described in Section
6.12(d) for an aggregate period of not less than six (6) years with respect to
claims arising from facts or events that occurred on or before the Effective
Time, including, in respect of the Merger and the transactions contemplated
by this Agreement.

(f) If Inergy, Inergy GP or any of their respective successors or assigns (i)
consolidates with or merges with or into any other person and shall not be the
continuing or surviving corporation, partnership or other entity of such
consolidation or merger or (ii) transfers or conveys all or substantially all
of its properties and assets to any person, then, and in each such case,
proper provision shall be made so that the successors and assigns of Inergy
and Inergy GP assume the obligations set forth in this Section 6.12.

 

(g) This Section 6.12 shall survive the consummation of the Merger and is
intended to be for the benefit of, and shall be enforceable by, the
Indemnified Parties and the Indemnitees and their respective heirs and
personal representatives, and shall be binding on Inergy, Inergy GP and their
respective successors and assigns.

 

Section 6.13 _Notification of Certain Matters_. Each of Holdings, Holdings GP,
Inergy GP and Inergy shall give prompt notice to the other of (a) any fact,
event or circumstance known to it that would cause or constitute a material
breach of any of its representations, warranties, covenants or agreements
contained herein, and (b) any change in its condition (financial or
otherwise) or business or any litigation or governmental complaints,
investigations or hearings, in each case to the extent such change,
litigation, complaints, investigations, or hearings results in, or would
reasonably be expected to result in, a Material Adverse Effect.

Section 6.14  _Rule 16b-3_. Prior to the Effective Time, Holdings shall take
such steps as may be reasonably requested by any party hereto to cause
dispositions of Holdings equity securities (including derivative securities)
pursuant to the transactions contemplated by this Agreement by each
individual who is a director or officer of Holdings GP to be exempt under Rule
16b-3 promulgated under the Exchange Act in accordance with that certain No-
Action Letter dated January 12, 1999 issued by the SEC regarding such
matters.

TERMINATION

 

Section 8.1 _Termination_. Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary,
this Agreement may be terminated and the Merger may be abandoned at any time
prior to the Effective Time whether before or after unitholder approval of
this Agreement:

 

(a) By the mutual consent of Inergy and Holdings in a written instrument,
including as a result of, but not limited to, a determination by each of the
Holdings GP Board and the Inergy GP Board that securing an investment in
Holdings by a strategic buyer is in the long term best interests of the
unitholders of both Holdings and Inergy.

 

(b) By either Inergy or Holdings upon written notice to the other, if:

 

(i) the Merger has not been consummated on or before December 31, 2010 (the
"Termination Date");  _provided_ that the right to terminate this Agreement
pursuant to this Section 8.1(b) shall not be available to a party whose
failure to fulfill any material obligation under this Agreement or other
material breach of this Agreement has been the primary cause of, or resulted
in, the failure of the Merger to have been consummated on or before such date;

 

(ii) any Regulatory Authority has issued a statute, rule, order, decree or
regulation or taken any other action, in each case permanently restraining,
enjoining or otherwise prohibiting the consummation of the Merger or making
the Merger illegal and such statute, rule, order, decree, regulation or other
action shall have become final and nonappealable ( _provided_  that the
terminating party is not then in breach of Section 6.1);

(iii) there has been a material breach of the Holdings Unitholder Support
Agreement; _provided_ that Holdings shall not be entitled to terminate this
Agreement pursuant to this Section 8.1(b)(iii) if Holdings has breached any of
its obligations under Section 6.6; 

(iv) there has been a material breach of or any material inaccuracy in any of
the representations or warranties set forth in this Agreement on the part of
any of the other parties (treating Inergy and Inergy GP as one party for the
purposes of this Section 8.1 and treating Holdings and Holdings GP as one
party for the purposes of this Section 8.1), which breach is not cured within
30 days following receipt by the breaching



 

A-30  party of written notice of such breach from the terminating party, or which
breach, by its nature, cannot be cured prior to the Termination Date (
_provided_ in any such case that the terminating party is not then in
material breach of any representation, warranty, covenant or other agreement
contained herein); _provided, however_ , that no party shall have the right to
terminate this Agreement pursuant to this Section 8.1(b)(iv) unless the
breach of a representation or warranty, together with all other such breaches,
would entitle the party receiving such representation not to consummate the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement under Section 7.4 (in the case of
a breach of representation or warranty by Inergy or Inergy GP) or Section 7.5
(in the case of a breach of representation or warranty by Holdings or Holdings
GP); or

 

(v) there has been a material breach of any of the covenants or agreements set
forth in this Agreement on the part of any of the other parties, which breach
has not have been cured within 30 days following receipt by the breaching
party of written notice of such breach from the terminating party, or which
breach, by its nature, cannot be cured prior to the Termination Date
(provided in any such case that the terminating party is not then in material
breach of any representation, warranty, covenant or other agreement contained
herein); _provided, however_ , that no party shall have the right to terminate
this Agreement pursuant to this Section 8.1(b)(v) unless the breach of
covenants or agreements, together with all other such breaches, would entitle
the party receiving the benefit of such covenants or agreements not to
consummate the transactions contemplated by this Agreement under Section 7.4.
(in the case of a breach of covenants or agreements by Inergy or Inergy GP) or
Section 7.5 (in the case of a breach of covenants or agreements by Holdings or
Holdings GP).

 

(c) By Inergy, upon written notice to Holdings, in the event that (i) Holdings
has materially breached Section 6.6; or (ii) a Holdings Change in
Recommendation has occurred.

(d) By Holdings, upon written notice to Inergy, in the event that if, at any
time after the date of this Agreement and prior to obtaining the Holdings
Unitholder Approval, Holdings receives an Acquisition Proposal and the
Holdings GP Board shall have concluded in good faith that such Acquisition
Proposal constitutes a Superior Proposal, the Holdings GP Board shall have
made a Holdings Change in Recommendation pursuant to Section 6.6(c) with
respect to such Superior Proposal, Holdings has not knowingly and
intentionally breached Section 6.6 of this Agreement, and the Holdings GP
Board concurrently approves, and Holdings concurrently enters into, a
definitive agreement with respect to such Superior Proposal and has paid the
Holdings Termination Fee pursuant to Section 9.1(b). 

(e) By Holdings, upon written notice to Inergy, if as a result of a Change in
U.S. Federal Income Tax Law, the the Holdings Conflicts Committee determines,
in its reasonable judgment, that consummation of the transactions contemplated
by Article III could materially increase the amount of U.S. federal income tax
due from any holder of Common Units as a result of owning or disposing of the
LP Units acquired pursuant to such transactions, as compared to U.S. federal
income tax due from such holder as a result of owning or disposing of any
Common Units in the event the transactions contemplated by Article III did
not occur; _provided_ that Holdings shall not have the right to terminate this
Agreement pursuant to this Section 8.1(e) in the event, within 30 days after
the receipt of such notice, Inergy has provided to Holdings the opinion
of nationally recognized tax counsel, reasonably acceptable to Holdings, to
the effect that such holder of Common Units should not be liable for such
increased tax as a result of owning or disposing of LP Units.

 

(f) By Inergy, upon written notice to Holdings, if as a result of a Change in
U.S. Federal Income Tax Law, the consummation of the transactions
contemplated by Article III could materially increase the amount of U.S.
federal income tax due from any holder of LP Units as a result of owning or
disposing of the LP Units, as compared to U.S. federal income tax due from
such holder in the event the transactions contemplated by Article III did not
occur; provided that Inergy shall not have the right to terminate this
Agreement pursuant to this Section 8.1(f) in the event, within 30 days after
the receipt of such notice, Holdings has provided to Inergy the opinion of
nationally recognized tax counsel, reasonably acceptable to Inergy, to the
effect that it is more likely than not that such holder of LP Units should not
be liable for such increased tax as a result of owning or disposing of LP
Units.



 

A-31 Section 8.2 _Effect of Termination_. In the event of the termination of this
Agreement as provided in Section 8.1, written notice thereof shall forthwith
be given by the terminating party to the other parties specifying the
provision of this Agreement pursuant to which such termination is made, and
except as provided in this Section 8.2, this Agreement (other than Article IX)
shall forthwith become null and void after the expiration of any applicable
period following such notice. In the event of such termination, there shall be
no liability on the part of Inergy, MergerCo or Holdings, except as set forth
in Section 9.1 of this Agreement and except with respect to the requirement to
comply with the Confidentiality Agreement; _provided_ that nothing herein
shall relieve any party from any liability or obligation with respect to any
fraud or intentional breach of this Agreement.

 

ARTICLE IX

 

MISCELLANEOUS

 

Section 9.1 _Fees and Expenses_.

 

(a) Whether or not the Merger is consummated, all costs and expenses incurred
in connection with this Agreement and the transactions contemplated hereby
shall be paid by the party incurring such costs or expenses, except as
otherwise provided in this Section 9.1.

 

(b) If this Agreement is terminated by Inergy pursuant to Section 8.1(c) or by
Holdings pursuant to Section 8.1(d), then Holdings shall pay to the Escrow
Agent for the benefit of Inergy the Holdings Termination Fee. If this
Agreement is terminated by Inergy pursuant to Section 8.1(b)(iv) or Section
8.1(b)(v) or by Holdings or Inergy pursuant to Section 8.1(b)(iii), then
Holdings shall pay to Inergy the Expenses of Inergy.

(c) In the event that (i) an Acquisition Proposal with respect to Holdings
has been proposed by any Person (meaning, for the purpose of this Section
9.1(c), a Person other than Inergy, Inergy GP and MergerCo) or any Person has
publicly announced its intention (whether or not conditional) to make such an
Acquisition Proposal or such an Acquisition Proposal or such intention has
otherwise become publicly known to the holders of Holdings Common Units
generally and in any event such proposal or intention is not subsequently
withdrawn prior to the termination of this Agreement, (ii) thereafter this
Agreement is terminated by either Holdings or Inergy pursuant to Section
8.1(b)(i) or Section 8.1(b)(iii) or by Inergy pursuant to Section 8.1(b)(iv)
or Section 8.1(b)(v) and (iii) within 12 months after the termination of this
Agreement, Holdings or any of its Subsidiaries enters into any definitive
agreement providing for an Acquisition Proposal, or an Acquisition Proposal
with respect to Holdings or any of its Subsidiaries is consummated, then
Holdings shall pay to the Escrow Agent for the benefit of Inergy, if and when
consummation of such Acquisition Proposal occurs, the Holdings
Termination Fee less all Expenses of Inergy previously paid to Inergy;
_provided_ that for purposes of this Section 9.1(c), "50%" shall be
substituted for "20%" in the definition of Acquisition Proposal.

 

(d) If this Agreement is terminated by Holdings pursuant to Section 8.1(b)(iv)
or Section 8.1(b)(v), then Inergy shall pay to Holdings the Expenses of
Holdings.

(e) Except as otherwise provided herein, any payment of the Holdings
Termination Fee or Expenses pursuant to this Section 9.1 shall be made by
wire transfer of immediately available funds to an account of the Inergy
Escrow Agent designated by Inergy or an account of the Holdings Escrow Agent
designated by Holdings, as applicable, within one Business Day after such
payment becomes payable; _provided, however_ , that any payment of the
Holdings Termination Fee by Holdings as a result of termination under Section
8.1(d) shall be made prior to or concurrently with termination of this
Agreement; _provided further, however,_ that any payment of the Holdings
Termination Fee pursuant to Section 9.1(c) shall be made contemporaneously
with the consummation of the Acquisition Proposal as provided in clause (iii)
of Section 9.1(c). The parties acknowledge that the agreements contained in
this Section 9.1 are an integral part of the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement, and that, without these agreements, none of the parties
would enter into this Agreement.



 

A-32 (f)(i) If the Merger is consummated, Inergy shall pay, or cause to be paid,
any and all property or transfer taxes imposed on either party in connection
with the Merger, (ii) expenses incurred in connection with filing, printing
and mailing the Proxy Statement and the Registration Statement shall be paid
by Inergy and (iii) any filing fees payable pursuant to, regulatory Laws and
other filing fees incurred in connection with this Agreement shall be paid by
the party incurring the fees. As used in this Agreement, "Expenses" includes
all out-of-pocket expenses (including all fees and expenses of counsel,
accountants, investment bankers, experts and consultants to a party hereto and
its affiliates) incurred by a party or on its behalf in connection with or
related to the authorization, preparation, negotiation, execution and
performance of this Agreement and the transactions contemplated hereby,
including the preparation, printing, filing and mailing of the Proxy Statement
and the Registration Statement and the solicitation of unitholder approvals
and all other matters related to the transactions contemplated hereby;
_provided_ that the amount of Expenses payable by one party to another under
this Section 9.1 shall not exceed 3.0 million exclusive of the Holdings
Termination Fee, as applicable.

(g) Any amounts paid to the Escrow Agent pursuant to this Article IX,
together with interest thereon (the "Escrow Fund"), shall be released by the
Escrow Agent to Inergy or to Holdings, as applicable, as follows:

 

(i) Prior to the end of the calendar year in which the payment was made to the
Escrow Agent, Inergy or Holdings, as applicable, shall submit to the Escrow
Agent a certificate demanding a portion of the Escrow Fund equal to no greater
than 70% of the maximum remaining amount which, in the good faith view of the
Inergy GP or Holdings GP, as applicable, may still be taken into the gross
income of Inergy or Holdings, as applicable, without exceeding the permissible
qualifying income (as defined in Section 7704 of the Code) limits for a
publicly traded partnership, after taking into consideration all
other sources of non-qualifying income (such maximum remaining amount, the
"Non-Qualifying Income Cushion"), and the Escrow Agent shall within one
Business Day thereafter, pay Inergy or Holdings, as applicable, the amount
demanded, by wire transfer of immediately available funds to an account
designated by Inergy or Holdings, as applicable;

(ii) During the calendar year following the date that the payment was made to
the Escrow Agent but prior to the passage of 30 Business Days following the
filing of the IRS Form 1065 for the prior year, Inergy or Holdings, as
applicable, shall submit to the Escrow Agent a certificate identifying the
actual Non-Qualifying Income Cushion from the prior year. If the payment
contemplated by clause (i) above was (A) less than 80% of the actual Non-
Qualifying Income Cushion, then Inergy or Holdings, as applicable, shall
submit to the Escrow Agent a certificate demanding a portion of the Escrow
Fund equal to an amount which, when combined with the payment contemplated by
clause (i) will equal 90% of the actual Non-Qualifying Income Cushion, and
the Escrow Agent shall within one Business Day thereafter, pay Inergy or
Holdings, as applicable, the amount demanded, (B) greater than or equal to
80%, but less than or equal to 90% of the actual Non-Qualifying
Income Cushion, then Inergy or Holdings, as applicable, shall notify the
Escrow Agent that it will not demand any additional payments from the Escrow
Account, and (C) greater than 90% of the actual Non-Qualifying Income Cushion,
then Inergy or Holdings, as applicable, shall deliver a certificate to such
effect to the Escrow Agent and return to the Escrow Fund an amount equal to
the excess of the payment contemplated by clause (i) over 80% of the Non-
Qualifying Income Cushion. Any payment under this clause (ii) shall be made
by the Escrow Agent, or by Inergy or Holdings, as applicable, as the case may
be, by wire transfer of immediately available funds to an account designated
by Inergy or Holdings, as applicable, or the Escrow Agent, as the case may
be; and

(iii) Within one Business Day following the earlier of (A) completion of the
procedures as contemplated by Section 9.1(g)(ii) above and (B) the passage of
30 days following the filing of the IRS Form 1065 for the prior year, the
Escrow Agent shall pay Holdings or Inergy, as applicable, the remainder, if
any, of the Escrow Fund, by wire transfer of immediately available funds to an
account designated by Holdings or Inergy, as applicable.

 

Each of Holdings and Inergy, as applicable, acknowledges and agrees that (x)
the amount of a payment, if any, pursuant to Section 9.1(g)(ii) above is
uncertain, and that depending on the amount of the demands made by Inergy or
Holdings, as applicable, pursuant to Section 9.1(g)(ii) above, the Escrow Fund
may be insufficient to 



 

A-33  permit payments to Holdings or Inergy, as applicable, pursuant to Section
9.1(g)(ii) above, and (y) it shall have no rights to any amounts in the Escrow
Fund (other than as contemplated by this subsection (g)) or to audit or
inquire into the amounts demanded by or paid to Inergy or Holdings, as
applicable.

(h) Holdings agrees that, notwithstanding any right that it or Inergy GP may
otherwise have, including pursuant to the Inergy Partnership Agreement, the
Inergy Amended and Restated Partnership Agreement, or otherwise, it hereby
waives and renounces for itself and its Affiliates, and shall cause Inergy GP
to waive and renounce, any distribution by Inergy to its partners of any
amount paid to Inergy by the Escrow Agent, together with an income allocation
associated with such distribution, it being understood that following payment
to Inergy from the Escrow Agent, Inergy will make a distribution to the
holders of LP Units who are unaffiliated with Holdings.

 

(i) This Section 9.1 shall survive any termination of this Agreement.

 

Section 9.2 _Waiver; Amendment_. Subject to compliance with applicable Law,
prior to the Closing, any provision of this Agreement may be (a) waived in
writing by the party benefited by the provision and approved by the Inergy GP
Board in the case of Inergy and by the Holdings GP Board in the case of
Holdings and executed in the same manner as this Agreement, or (b) amended or
modified at any time, whether before or after the Holdings Unitholder
Approval, by an agreement in writing between the parties hereto approved by
the Inergy GP Board in the case of Inergy and by the Holdings GP Board in the
case of Holdings and executed in the same manner as this Agreement, _provided_
, that after the Holdings Unitholder Approval, no amendment shall be made that
requires further Holdings Unitholder Approval without such approval. 

Section 9.3 _Counterparts_. This Agreement may be executed in one or
more counterparts, each of which shall be deemed to constitute an original.

Section 9.4  _Governing Law_. This Agreement shall be governed by, and
interpreted in accordance with, the Laws of the State of Delaware, without
regard to the conflict of law principles thereof (except to the extent that
mandatory provisions of federal or Delaware law govern).

Section 9.5 _Confidentiality_. Each of the parties hereto and
their respective agents, attorneys and accountants will maintain the
confidentiality of all information provided in connection herewith to the
extent required by, and subject to the limitations of, Section 6.5(b).

 

Section 9.6 _Notices_. All notices, requests and other communications
hereunder to a party shall be in writing and shall be deemed given if
personally delivered, telecopied (with confirmation) or mailed by registered

liability company, as the Withdrawing General Partner, IPCH Acquisition Corp.,
a Delaware corporation, and Inergy Holdings, L.P., a Delaware limited
partnership, together with any other Persons who become Partners in the

BACKGROUND

 

On January 7, 2004, the Managing General Partner, the Non-Managing General
Partner and the Limited Partners entered into that Second Amended and
Restated Agreement of Limited Partnership of the Partnership, as amended from
time to time (the " _Second Amended and Restated Partnership Agreement_ ").

 

On , 2010, the Partnership, Inergy GP LLC, the
Withdrawing General Partner, NRGP Limited Partner, LLC, Inergy Holdings, L.P.,
Inergy Holdings GP, LLC and NRGP MS, LLC entered in an Agreement and Plan of
Merger (the " _Agreement and Plan of Merger_ ") providing for, among other
things, the exchange of the outstanding Incentive Distribution Rights and
Common Units owned by Inergy Holdings, L.P. for new Common Units and Class B
Units, the exchange of the outstanding general partner interest and Common
Units owned by the Withdrawing General Partner for Class A Units, the exchange
of the outstanding Common Units owned by IPCH Acquisition Corp. for Class A
Units, the contribution by Inergy Holdings, L.P. of its interests in each
of IPCH Acquisition Corp. and the Withdrawing General Partner to the
Partnership in exchange for Common Units, the merger of NRGP MS, LLC with and
into Inergy Holdings L.P., with Inergy Holdings, L.P. surviving the merger and
the distribution by Inergy Holdings, L.P. of Common Units and Class B Units
in exchange for its outstanding common units.

This Agreement amends and restates the Second Amended and Restated

ARTICLE I

 

DEFINITIONS

 

Section 1.1 _Definitions_

 

The following definitions shall be for all purposes, unless otherwise clearly
indicated to the contrary, applied to the terms used in this Agreement.

" _Acquisition_ " means any transaction in which any Group Member acquires
(through an asset acquisition, merger, stock acquisition or other form of
investment) control over all or a portion of the assets, properties or
business of another Person for the purpose of increasing the operating
capacity or revenues of the Partnership Group from the operating capacity or
revenues of the Partnership Group existing immediately prior to such
transaction.



 

B-1 " _Additional Limited Partner_ " means a Person admitted to the Partnership
as a Limited Partner pursuant to Section 10.3 and who is shown as such on the
books and records of the Partnership.

 

" _Adjusted Capital Account_ " means the Capital Account maintained for each
Partner as of the end of each fiscal year of the Partnership, (a) increased
by any amounts that such Partner is obligated to restore under the standards
set by Treasury Regulation Section 1.704-1(b)(2)(ii)(c) (or is deemed
obligated to restore under Treasury Regulation Sections 1.704-2(g) and
1.704-2(i)(5)) and (b) decreased by (i) the amount of all losses and
deductions that, as of the end of such fiscal year, are reasonably expected to
be allocated to such Partner in subsequent years under Sections 704(e)(2) and
706(d) of the Code and Treasury Regulation Section 1.751-1(b)(2)(ii), and (ii)
the amount of all distributions that, as of the end of such fiscal year, are
reasonably expected to be made to such Partner in subsequent years
in accordance with the terms of this Agreement or otherwise to the extent
they exceed offsetting increases to such Partners Capital Account that are
reasonably expected to occur during (or prior to) the year in which such
distributions are reasonably expected to be made (other than increases as a
result of a minimum gain chargeback pursuant to Sections 6.1(c)(i) or
6.1(c)(ii)). The foregoing definition of Adjusted Capital Account is intended
to comply with the provisions of Treasury Regulation Section
1.704-1(b)(2)(ii)(d) and shall be interpreted consistently therewith. The "
_Adjusted Capital Account_ " of a Partner in respect of a Common Unit, a Class
A Unit, a Class B Unit or any other specified interest in the Partnership
shall be the amount which such Adjusted Capital Account would be if such
Common Unit, Class A Unit, Class B Unit or other interest in the Partnership
were the only interest in the Partnership held by a Partner from and after
the date on which such Common Unit, Class A Unit, Class B Unit or other
interest was first issued.

 

" _Adjusted Property_ " means any property the Carrying Value of which has
been adjusted pursuant to Sections 5.3(b)(i) or 5.3(b)(ii).

" _Affiliate_ " means, with respect to any Person, any other Person
that directly or indirectly through one or more intermediaries controls, is
controlled by or is under common control with, the Person in question. As used
herein, the term "control" means the possession, direct or indirect, of the
power to direct or cause the direction of the management and policies of a
Person, whether through ownership of voting securities, by contract or
otherwise.

 

" _Agreed Allocation_ " means any allocation, other than a Required
Allocation, of an item of income, gain, loss or deduction pursuant to the
provisions of Section 6.1, including, without limitation, a Curative
Allocation (if appropriate to the context in which the term " _Agreed
Allocation_ " is used).

 

" _Agreed Value_ " of any Contributed Property means the fair market value of
such property or other consideration at the time of contribution as
determined by the Managing General Partner using such reasonable method of
valuation as it may adopt. The Managing General Partner shall, in its
discretion, use such method as it deems reasonable and appropriate to
allocate the aggregate Agreed Value of Contributed Properties contributed to
the Partnership in a single or integrated transaction among each separate
property on a basis proportional to the fair market value of each Contributed
Property.

 

" _Agreement_ " means this Third Amended and Restated Agreement of Limited
Partnership of Inergy, L.P., as it may be amended, supplemented or restated
from time to time.

" _Agreement and Plan of Merger_ " has the meaning assigned to such term in
the Background to this Agreement.

" _Assignee_ " means a Non-citizen Assignee or a Person to whom one or more

Nothing contained in this Section 2.6(a) shall be construed as authorizing the
Managing General Partner to amend this Agreement except in accordance with
Article XIII or as may be otherwise expressly provided for in this Agreement.

(b) The foregoing power of attorney is hereby declared to be irrevocable and
a power coupled with an interest, and it shall survive and, to the maximum
extent permitted by law, not be affected by the subsequent death,
incompetency, disability, incapacity, dissolution, bankruptcy or termination

B-13  designation, powers of attorney and other instruments as the Managing
General Partner or the Liquidator deems necessary to effectuate this Agreement
and the purposes of the Partnership.

Partner or one or more of its Affiliates or one or more nominees shall be held
by the Managing General Partner or such Affiliate or nominee for the use and
benefit of the Partnership in accordance with the provisions of this
Agreement; _provided, however_ , that the Managing General Partner shall use
reasonable efforts to cause record title to such assets (other than those
assets in respect of which the Managing General Partner determines that the
expense and difficulty of conveyancing makes transfer of record title to the
Partnership impracticable) to be vested in the Partnership as soon as
reasonably practicable; _provided, further_ , that, prior to the withdrawal or
removal of the Managing General Partner or as soon thereafter as practicable,
the Managing General Partner shall use reasonable efforts to effect the
transfer of record title to the Partnership and, prior to any such transfer,
will provide for the use of such assets in a manner satisfactory to the
Managing General Partner. All Partnership assets shall be recorded as the

partner of the Partnership (within the meaning of Section 17-303(a) of the
Delaware Act) and shall not affect, impair or eliminate the limitations on
the liability of the Limited Partners or Assignees under this Agreement.

(b) The Managing General Partner may keep confidential from the Limited
Partners and Assignees, for such period of time as the Managing General

information the disclosure of which the Managing General Partner in good
faith believes (A) is not in the best interests of the Partnership Group, (B)
could damage the Partnership Group or (C) that any Group Member is required by

REDEMPTION OF PARTNERSHIP INTERESTS

 

Section 4.1 _Certificates_

 

Upon the Partnerships issuance of Common Units to any Person, the Partnership
shall issue one or more Certificates in the name of such Person evidencing
the number of such Units being so issued; _provided, however_ , with respect
to the issuance of any Class B Units, the Partnership shall issue Certificates
in accordance with Section 5.7(b)(iii). Upon the request of any Person owning
Class A Units or any other Partnership Securities other than Common Units, the
Partnership shall issue to such Person one or more certificates evidencing
such Class A Units or Partnership Securities other than Common Units.
Certificates shall be executed on behalf of the Partnership by the Chairman of
the Board, President or any Vice President and the Secretary or any Assistant
Secretary of the Managing General Partner. No Common Unit Certificate shall
be valid for any purpose until it has been countersigned by the Transfer
Agent; _provided, however_ , the Common Units may be certificated or

 



 

B-15  uncertificated as provided in the Delaware Act; provided, further, that if
the Managing General Partner elects to issue Common Units in global form, the
Common Unit Certificates shall be valid upon receipt of a certificate from
the Transfer Agent certifying that the Common Units have been duly registered
in accordance with the directions of the Partnership.

 

Section 4.2 _Mutilated, Destroyed, Lost or Stolen Certificates_

 

(a) If any mutilated Certificate is surrendered to the Transfer Agent, the
appropriate officers of the Managing General Partner on behalf of the
Partnership shall execute, and the Transfer Agent shall countersign and
deliver in exchange therefor, a new Certificate evidencing the same number and
type of Partnership Securities as the Certificate so surrendered.

 

(b) The appropriate officers of the Managing General Partner on behalf of the
Partnership shall execute and deliver, and the Transfer Agent shall
countersign a new Certificate in place of any Certificate previously issued if
the Record Holder of the Certificate:

 

(i) makes proof by affidavit, in form and substance satisfactory to the
Managing General Partner, that a previously issued Certificate has been lost,
destroyed or stolen;

(ii) requests the issuance of a new Certificate before the Managing General
Partner has notice that the Certificate has been acquired by a purchaser for
value in good faith and without notice of an adverse claim;

 

(iii) if requested by the Managing General Partner, delivers to the Managing
General Partner a bond, in form and substance satisfactory to the Managing
General Partner, with surety or sureties and with fixed or open penalty as the
Managing General Partner may reasonably direct, in its sole discretion, to
indemnify the Managing General Partner, the Partners, the Managing General
Partner and the Transfer Agent against any claim that may be made on account
of the alleged loss, destruction or theft of the Certificate; and

 

(iv) satisfies any other reasonable requirements imposed by the Partnership.

 

If a Limited Partner or Assignee fails to notify the Managing General Partner
within a reasonable time after he has notice of the loss, destruction or
theft of a Certificate, and a transfer of the Limited Partner Interests
represented by the Certificate is registered before the Partnership, the
Managing General Partner or the Transfer Agent receives such notification, the
Limited Partner or Assignee shall be precluded from making any claim against
the Partnership, the Managing General Partner or the Transfer Agent for such
transfer or for a new Certificate.

 

(c) As a condition to the issuance of any new Certificate under this Section
4.2, the Managing General Partner may require the payment of a sum sufficient
to cover any tax or other governmental charge that may be imposed in relation
thereto and any other expenses (including the fees and expenses of the
Transfer Agent) reasonably connected therewith.

 

Section 4.3 _Record Holders_

 

The Partnership shall be entitled to recognize the Record Holder as the
Partner or Assignee with respect to any Partnership Interest
and, accordingly, shall not be bound to recognize any equitable or other
claim to or interest in such Partnership Interest on the part of any other
Person, regardless of whether the Partnership shall have actual or other
notice thereof, except as otherwise provided by law or any applicable rule,
regulation, guideline or requirement of any National Securities Exchange on
which such Partnership Interests are listed for trading. Without limiting the
foregoing, when a Person (such as a broker, dealer, bank, trust company or
clearing corporation or an agent of any of the foregoing) is acting as
nominee, agent or in some other representative capacity for another Person in
acquiring and/or holding Partnership Interests, as between the Partnership on
the one hand, and such other Persons on the other, such representative Person
(a) shall be the Partner or Assignee (as the case may be) of record and
beneficially, (b) must execute and deliver a Transfer Application and (c)
shall be



 

B-16  bound by this Agreement and shall have the rights and obligations of a
Partner or Assignee (as the case may be) hereunder and as, and to the extent,
provided for herein.

 

Section 4.4 _Transfer Generally_

 

(a) The term " _transfer_ ," when used in this Agreement with respect to a
Partnership Interest, shall be deemed to refer to a transaction by which a
General Partner assigns its General Partner Interest to another Person who
becomes a General Partner, by which the holder of a Limited Partner Interest
assigns such Limited Partner Interest to another Person who is or becomes a
Limited Partner or an Assignee, and includes a sale, assignment, gift, pledge,
encumbrance, hypothecation, mortgage, exchange or any other disposition by law
or otherwise.

 

(b) No Partnership Interest shall be transferred, in whole or in part, except
in accordance with the terms and conditions set forth in this Article IV. Any
transfer or purported transfer of a Partnership Interest not made in
accordance with this Article IV shall be null and void.

 

(c) Nothing contained in this Agreement shall be construed to prevent a
disposition by any member of the Managing General Partner of any or all of
the issued and outstanding membership interests of the Managing General
Partner.

Section 4.5 _Registration and Transfer of Limited Partner Interests_

(a) The Partnership shall keep or cause to be kept on behalf of the
Partnership a register in which, subject to such reasonable regulations as it
may prescribe and subject to the provisions of Section 4.5(b), the Partnership
will provide for the registration and transfer of Limited Partner Interests.
The Transfer Agent is hereby appointed registrar and transfer agent for the
purpose of registering Common Units and transfers of such Common Units as
herein provided. The Partnership shall not recognize transfers of Certificates
evidencing Limited Partner Interests unless such transfers are effected in
the manner described in this Section 4.5. Upon surrender of a Certificate for
registration of transfer of any Limited Partner Interests evidenced by a
Certificate, and subject to the provisions of Section 4.5(b), the appropriate
officers of the Managing General Partner on behalf of the Partnership shall
execute and deliver, and in the case of Common Units, the Transfer Agent shall
countersign and deliver, in the name of the holder or the designated
transferee or transferees, as required pursuant to the holders instructions,
one or more new Certificates evidencing the same aggregate number and type of
Limited Partner Interests as was evidenced by the Certificate so
surrendered. 

(b) Except as otherwise provided in Section 4.9, the Partnership shall not
recognize any transfer of Limited Partner Interests until the Certificates
evidencing such Limited Partner Interests are surrendered for registration of
transfer and such Certificates are accompanied by a Transfer Application duly
executed by the transferee (or the transferees attorney-in-fact duly
authorized in writing). No charge shall be imposed by the Partnership for such
transfer; _provided_ , that as a condition to the issuance of any new
Certificate under this Section 4.5, the Partnership may require the payment
of a sum sufficient to cover any tax or other governmental charge that may be
imposed with respect thereto.

(c) Limited Partner Interests may be transferred only in the manner described
in this Section 4.5. The transfer of any Limited Partner Interests and the
admission of any new Limited Partner shall not constitute an amendment to this
Agreement. 

(d) Until admitted as a Substituted Limited Partner pursuant to Section 10.1,
the Record Holder of a Limited Partner Interest shall be an Assignee in
respect of such Limited Partner Interest. Limited Partners may include
custodians, nominees or any other individual or entity in its own or any
representative capacity.

 

(e) A transferee of a Limited Partner Interest who has completed and delivered
a Transfer Application shall be deemed to have (i) requested admission as a
Substituted Limited Partner, (ii) agreed to comply with and be bound by and to
have executed this Agreement, (iii) represented and warranted that such
transferee has the right, 



 

B-17  power and authority and, if an individual, the capacity to enter into this
Agreement, (iv) granted the powers of attorney set forth in this Agreement and
(v) given the consents and approvals and made the waivers contained in this
Agreement.

(f) The Managing General Partner and its Affiliates shall have the right at
any time to transfer their Common Units to one or more Persons.

Section 4.6 _Transfer of the Managing General Partner s General Partner
Interest_

(a) Subject to Section 4.6(c) below, prior to June 30, 2011, the Managing
General Partner shall not transfer all or any part of its General Partner
Interest to a Person unless such transfer (i) has been approved by the prior
written consent or vote of the holders of at least a majority of the
Outstanding Common Units (excluding Common Units held by the Managing General
Partner and their Affiliates) or (ii) is of all, but not less than all, of its
General Partner Interest to (A) an Affiliate of the Managing General Partner
(other than an individual) or (B) another Person (other than an individual)
in connection with the merger or consolidation of the Managing General Partner
with or into another Person (other than an individual) or the transfer by such
General Partner of all or substantially all of its assets to another Person
(other than an individual).

(b) Subject to Section 4.6(c) below, on or after June 30, 2011, a General
Partner may transfer all or any of its General Partner Interest without
Unitholder approval.

 

(c) Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, no transfer by a General
Partner of all or any part of its General Partner Interest to another Person
shall be permitted unless (i) the transferee agrees to assume the rights and
duties of such General Partner under this Agreement and to be bound by the
provisions of this Agreement, (ii) the Partnership receives an Opinion of
Counsel that such transfer would not result in the loss of limited liability
of any Limited Partner or of any member of the Operating Company or cause the
Partnership or the Operating Company to be treated as an association taxable
as a corporation or otherwise to be taxed as an entity for federal income tax
purposes (to the extent not already so treated or taxed), (iii) in the case of
the Managing General Partners General Partner Interest, such transferee also
agrees to purchase all (or the appropriate portion thereof, if applicable) of
the partnership or membership interest of the Managing General Partner as the
general partner or managing member, if any, of each other Group Member. In the
case of a transfer pursuant to and in compliance with this Section 4.6, the
transferee or successor (as the case may be) shall, subject to compliance with
the terms of Section 10.2, be admitted to the Partnership as a General Partner
immediately prior to the transfer of the Partnership Interest, and the
business of the Partnership shall continue without dissolution.

Section 4.7  _Transfer of Class B Units_

Prior to the second anniversary of the Effective Date, Class B Unitholders
shall not Transfer any Class B Units without the prior written consent of the
Partnership; provided, however, that these restrictions will not apply to
transfers to a grantor retained annuity trust, a family limited partnership or
other similar estate planning entities controlled by such holder or transfers
to a deceased holders estate.

Section 4.8 _Restrictions on Transfers_

(a) Except as provided in Section 4.8(c) below, but notwithstanding the other
provisions of this Article IV, no transfer of any Partnership Interests shall
be made if such transfer would (i) violate the then applicable federal or
state securities laws or rules and regulations of the Commission, any state
securities commission or any other governmental authority with jurisdiction
over such transfer, (ii) terminate the existence or qualification of the
Partnership or Operating Company under the laws of the jurisdiction of its
formation, or (iii) cause the Partnership or Operating Company to be treated
as an association taxable as a corporation or otherwise to be taxed as an
entity for federal income tax purposes (to the extent not already so treated
or taxed).

 



 

B-18 (b) The Managing General Partner may impose restrictions on the transfer of
Partnership Interests if a subsequent Opinion of Counsel determines that such
restrictions are necessary to avoid a significant risk of the Partnership or
Operating Company becoming taxable as a corporation or otherwise to be taxed
as an entity for federal income tax purposes. The restrictions may be imposed
by making such amendments to this Agreement as the Managing General Partner
may determine to be necessary or appropriate to impose such restrictions;
_provided, however_ , that any amendment that the Managing General Partner
believes, in the exercise of its reasonable discretion, could result in the
delisting or suspension of trading of any class of Limited Partner Interests
on the principal National Securities Exchange on which such class of Limited
Partner Interests is then traded must be approved, prior to such amendment
being effected, by the holders of at least a majority of the Outstanding
Limited Partner Interests of such class.

 

(c) Nothing contained in this Article IV, or elsewhere in this Agreement,
shall preclude the settlement of any transactions involving Partnership
Interests entered into through the facilities of any National Securities
Exchange on which such Partnership Interests are listed for trading.

 

Section 4.9 _Citizenship Certificates; Non-citizen Assignees_

 

(a) If any Group Member is or becomes subject to any federal, state or local
law or regulation that, in the reasonable determination of the Managing
General Partner, creates a substantial risk of cancellation or forfeiture of
any property in which the Group Member has an interest based on the
nationality, citizenship or other related status of a Limited Partner or
Assignee, the Managing General Partner may request any Limited Partner or
Assignee to furnish to the Managing General Partner, within 30 days after
receipt of such request, an executed Citizenship Certification or such other
information concerning his nationality, citizenship or other related status
(or, if the Limited Partner or Assignee is a nominee holding for the account
of another Person, the nationality, citizenship or other related status of
such Person) as the Managing General Partner may request. If a Limited
Partner or Assignee fails to furnish to the Managing General Partner within
the aforementioned 30-day period such Citizenship Certification or other
requested information or if upon receipt of such Citizenship Certification
or other requested information the Managing General Partner determines, with
the advice of counsel, that a Limited Partner or Assignee is not an Eligible
Citizen, the Partnership Interests owned by such Limited Partner or Assignee
shall be subject to redemption in accordance with the provisions of Section
4.10. In addition, the Managing General Partner may require that the status of
any such Partner or Assignee be changed to that of a Non-citizen Assignee and,
thereupon, the Managing General Partner shall be substituted for such Non-
citizen Assignee as the Limited Partner in respect of his Limited Partner
Interests.

 

(b) The Managing General Partner shall, in exercising voting rights in respect
of Limited Partner Interests held by it on behalf of Non-citizen Assignees,
distribute the votes in the same ratios as the votes of Partners (including
without limitation the Managing General Partner) in respect of Limited Partner
Interests other than those of Non-citizen Assignees are cast, either for,
against or abstaining as to the matter.

(c) Upon dissolution of the Partnership, a Non-citizen Assignee shall have
no right to receive a distribution in kind pursuant to Section 12.4 but shall
be entitled to the cash equivalent thereof, and the Partnership shall provide
cash in exchange for an assignment of the Non-citizen Assignees share of
the distribution in kind. Such payment and assignment shall be treated for
Partnership purposes as a purchase by the Partnership from the Non-citizen
Assignee of his Limited Partner Interest (representing his right to receive
his share of such distribution in kind).

(d) At any time after he can and does certify that he has become an Eligible
Citizen, a Non-citizen Assignee may, upon application to the General Partner,
request admission as a Substituted Limited Partner with respect to any Limited
Partner Interests of such Non-citizen Assignee not redeemed pursuant to
Section 4.10, and upon his admission pursuant to Section 10.1, the Managing
General Partner shall cease to be deemed to be the Limited Partner in respect
of the Non-citizen Assignees Limited Partner Interests.

 



 

B-19 Section 4.10 _Redemption of Partnership Interests of Non-citizen Assignees_

 

(a) If at any time a Limited Partner or Assignee fails to furnish a
Citizenship Certification or other information requested within the 30-day
period specified in Section 4.9(a), or if upon receipt of such Citizenship
Certification or other information the General Partner determines, with the
advice of counsel, that a Limited Partner or Assignee is not an Eligible
Citizen, the Partnership may, unless the Limited Partner or Assignee
establishes to the satisfaction of the Managing General Partner that such
Limited Partner or Assignee is an Eligible Citizen or has transferred his
Partnership Interests to a Person who is an Eligible Citizen and who
furnishes a Citizenship Certification to the Managing General Partner prior to
the date fixed for redemption as provided below, redeem the Partnership
Interest of such Limited Partner or Assignee as follows:

 

(i) The Managing General Partner shall, not later than the 30th day before the
date fixed for redemption, give notice of redemption to the Limited Partner
or Assignee, at his last address designated on the records of the Partnership
or the Transfer Agent, by registered or certified mail, postage prepaid. The
notice shall be deemed to have been given when so mailed. The notice shall
specify the Redeemable Interests, the date fixed for redemption, the place of
payment, that payment of the redemption price will be made upon surrender of
the Certificate evidencing the Redeemable Interests and that on and after
the date fixed for redemption no further allocations or distributions to
which the Limited Partner or Assignee would otherwise be entitled in respect
of the Redeemable Interests will accrue or be made.

 

(ii) The aggregate redemption price for Redeemable Interests shall be an
amount equal to the Current Market Price (the date of determination of which
shall be the date fixed for redemption) of Limited Partner Interests of the
class to be so redeemed multiplied by the number of Limited Partner Interests
of each such class included among the Redeemable Interests. The redemption
price shall be paid, in the discretion of the Managing General Partner, in
cash or by delivery of a promissory note of the Partnership in the principal
amount of the redemption price, bearing interest at the rate of 10% annually
and payable in three equal annual installments of principal together with
accrued interest, commencing one year after the redemption date.

 

(iii) Upon surrender by or on behalf of the Limited Partner or Assignee, at
the place specified in the notice of redemption, of the Certificate
evidencing the Redeemable Interests, duly endorsed in blank or accompanied by
an assignment duly executed in blank, the Limited Partner or Assignee or his
duly authorized representative shall be entitled to receive the payment
therefor.

(iv) After the redemption date, Redeemable Interests shall no longer
constitute issued and Outstanding Limited Partner Interests.

(b) The provisions of this Section 4.10 shall also be applicable to
Limited Partner Interests held by a Limited Partner or Assignee as nominee of
a Person determined to be other than an Eligible Citizen.

 

(c) Nothing in this Section 4.10 shall prevent the recipient of a notice of
redemption from transferring his Limited Partner Interest before the
redemption date if such transfer is otherwise permitted under this Agreement.
Upon receipt of notice of such a transfer, the Managing General Partner shall
withdraw the notice of redemption, provided the transferee of such Limited
Partner Interest certifies to the satisfaction of the Managing General Partner
in a Citizenship Certification delivered in connection with the Transfer
Application that he is an Eligible Citizen. If the transferee fails to make
such certification, such redemption shall be effected from the transferee on
the original redemption date.

CAPITAL CONTRIBUTIONS AND ISSUANCE OF PARTNERSHIP INTERESTS

 

Section 5.1 _Contributions by the Non-Managing General Partner and its
Affiliates_

 

(a) Immediately following the Effective Time, the Partnership hereby (i)
issues  Class A Units to IPCH Acquisition Corp. in exchange for
789,202 Common Units and (ii) issues  Class A Units to Inergy
Partners, LLC in exchange for 2,837,034 Common Units and its economic non-
managing general partner interest in the Partnership and (iii) cancels the
non-managing general partner interest, the Incentive Distribution Rights and
3,626,236 Common Units.

 

(b) Immediately following the Effective Time, the Withdrawing General Partner
does hereby withdraw as a general partner of the Partnership.

Section 5.2 _Interest and Withdrawal_

 

No interest on Capital Contributions shall be paid by the Partnership. No
Partner or Assignee shall be entitled to the withdrawal or return of its
Capital Contribution, except to the extent, if any, that distributions made
pursuant to this Agreement or upon termination of the Partnership may be
considered as such by law and then only to the extent provided for in this
Agreement. Except to the extent expressly provided in this Agreement, no
Partner or Assignee shall have priority over any other Partner or Assignee
either as to the return of Capital Contributions or as to profits, losses or
distributions. Any such return shall be a compromise to which all Partners
and Assignees agree within the meaning of Section 17-502(b) of the Delaware
Act.

 

Section 5.3 _Capital Accounts_

 

(a) The Partnership shall maintain for each Limited Partner (or a beneficial
owner of Partnership Interests held by a nominee in any case in which the
nominee has furnished the identity of such owner to the Partnership in
accordance with Section 6031(c) of the Code or any other method acceptable to
the Managing General Partner in its sole discretion) owning a Partnership
Interest a separate Capital Account with respect to such Partnership Interest
in accordance with the rules of Treasury Regulation Section 1.704-1(b)(2)(iv).
Such Capital Account shall be increased by (i) the amount of all Capital
Contributions made to the Partnership with respect to such Partnership
Interest pursuant to this Agreement and (ii) all items of Partnership income
and gain (including, without limitation, income and gain exempt from tax)
computed in accordance with Section 5.3(b) and allocated with respect to such
Partnership Interest pursuant to Section 6.1, and decreased by (x) the amount
of cash or Net Agreed Value of all actual and deemed distributions of cash or
property made with respect to such Partnership Interest pursuant to this
Agreement and (y) all items of Partnership deduction and loss computed in
accordance with Section 5.3(b) and allocated with respect to such Partnership
Interest pursuant to Section 6.1.

(b) For purposes of computing the amount of any item of income, gain, loss or
deduction which is to be allocated pursuant to Article VI and is to be
reflected in the Partners Capital Accounts, the determination, recognition
and classification of any such item shall be the same as its determination,
recognition and classification for federal income tax purposes (including,
without limitation, any method of depreciation, cost recovery or amortization
used for that purpose), provided, that:

 

(i) Solely for purposes of this Section 5.3, the Partnership shall be treated
as owning directly its proportionate share (as determined by the Managing
General Partner based upon the provisions of the Operating Company Agreement)
of all property owned by the Operating Company or any other Subsidiary that is
classified as a partnership for federal income tax purposes.

(ii) All fees and other expenses incurred by the Partnership to promote the
sale of (or to sell) a Partnership Interest that can neither be deducted nor
amortized under Section 709 of the Code, if any, shall, for purposes of
Capital Account maintenance, be treated as an item of deduction at the time
such fees and other expenses are incurred and shall be allocated among the
Partners pursuant to Section 6.1.



 

B-21 (iii) Except as otherwise provided in Treasury Regulation Section
1.704-1(b)(2)(iv)(m), the computation of all items of income, gain, loss and
deduction shall be made without regard to any election under Section 754 of
the Code which may be made by the Partnership and, as to those items
described in Section 705(a)(1)(B) or 705(a)(2)(B) of the Code, without regard
to the fact that such items are not includable in gross income or are neither
currently deductible nor capitalized for federal income tax purposes. To the
extent an adjustment to the adjusted tax basis of any Partnership asset
pursuant to Section 734(b) or 743(b) of the Code is required, pursuant to
Treasury Regulation Section 1.704-1(b)(2)(iv)(m), to be taken into account in
determining Capital Accounts, the amount of such adjustment in the Capital
Accounts shall be treated as an item of gain or loss.

(iv) Any income, gain or loss attributable to the taxable disposition of any
Partnership property shall be determined as if the adjusted basis of such
property as of such date of disposition were equal in amount to the
Partnerships Carrying Value with respect to such property as of such date.

(v) In accordance with the requirements of Section 704(b) of the Code, any
deductions for depreciation, cost recovery or amortization attributable to any
Contributed Property shall be determined as if the adjusted basis of such
property on the date it was acquired by the Partnership were equal to the
Agreed Value of such property. Upon an adjustment pursuant to Section 5.3(d)
to the Carrying Value of any Partnership property subject to depreciation,
cost recovery or amortization, any further deductions for such depreciation,
cost recovery or amortization attributable to such property shall be
determined (A) as if the adjusted basis of such property were equal to the
Carrying Value of such property immediately following such adjustment and (B)
using a rate of depreciation, cost recovery or amortization derived from the
same method and useful life (or, if applicable, the remaining useful life) as
is applied for federal income tax purposes; _provided, however_ , that, if
the asset has a zero adjusted basis for federal income tax purposes,
depreciation, cost recovery or amortization deductions shall be determined
using any reasonable method that the Managing General Partner may adopt.

 

(vi) If the Partnerships adjusted basis in a depreciable or cost recovery
property is reduced for federal income tax purposes pursuant to Section
48(q)(1) or 48(q)(3) of the Code, the amount of such reduction shall, solely
for purposes hereof, be deemed to be an additional depreciation or cost
recovery deduction in the year such property is placed in service and shall
be allocated among the Partners pursuant to Section 6.1. Any restoration of
such basis pursuant to Section 48(q)(2) of the Code shall, to the extent
possible, be allocated in the same manner to the Partners to whom such
deemed deduction was allocated.

(c) A transferee of a Partnership Interest shall succeed to a pro rata portion
of the Capital Account of the transferor relating to the Partnership Interest
so transferred.

(d)(i) In accordance with Treasury Regulation Section 1.704-1(b)(2)(iv)(f),
on an issuance of additional Partnership Interests for cash or Contributed
Property or the conversion of a Class B Unit to a Common Unit, the Capital
Account of all Partners and the Carrying Value of each Partnership property
immediately prior to such issuance or immediately after such conversion (with
respect to the conversion of a Class B Unit to a Common Unit) shall be
adjusted upward or downward to reflect any Unrealized Gain or Unrealized
Loss attributable to such Partnership property, as if such Unrealized Gain or
Unrealized Loss had been recognized on an actual sale of each such property
immediately prior to such issuance or on the date of such conversion and had
been allocated to the Partners in the same manner as any item of gain or loss
actually recognized during such period would have been allocated. Any such
Unrealized Gain or Unrealized Loss (or items thereof) shall be allocated (A)
if the operation of this sentence is triggered by the conversion of a Class B
Unit, first to the Partners holding converted Class B Units until the Capital
Account of each converted Class B Unit is equal to the Per Unit Capital Amount
for a then Outstanding Initial Common Unit, and (B) any remaining Unrealized
Gain or Unrealized Loss shall be allocated among the Partners in the same
manner as any item of gain or loss actually recognized would have been
allocated. If the Unrealized Gain or Unrealized Loss allocated as a result of
the conversion of a Class B Unit is not sufficient to cause the Capital
Account of each converted Class B Unit to equal the Per Unit Capital Amount
for a then Outstanding Initial Common Unit, then Capital Account balances
shall be reallocated between



 

B-22  the Partners holding converted Class B Units and the Partners holding Common
Units (other than converted Class B Units) so as to cause the Capital Account
of each converted Class B Unit to equal the Per Unit Capital Amount for a
then Outstanding Initial Common Unit, in accordance with Proposed Treasury
Regulation Section 1.704-1(b)(2)(iv)(s)(3). In determining such Unrealized
Gain or Unrealized Loss, the aggregate cash amount and fair market value of
all Partnership assets (including, without limitation, cash or cash
equivalents) immediately prior to the issuance of additional Partnership
Interests shall be determined by the Managing General Partner using such
reasonable method of valuation as it may adopt; _provided, however_ , that
the Managing General Partner, in arriving at such valuation, must take fully
into account the fair market value of the Partnership Interests of all
Partners at such time.

 

(ii) In accordance with Treasury Regulation Section 1.704-1(b)(2)(iv)(f),
immediately prior to any actual or deemed distribution to a Partner of any
Partnership property (other than a distribution of cash that is not in
redemption or retirement of a Partnership Interest), the Capital Accounts of
all Partners and the Carrying Value of all Partnership property shall be
adjusted upward or downward to reflect any Unrealized Gain or Unrealized Loss
attributable to such Partnership property, as if such Unrealized Gain or
Unrealized Loss had been recognized in a sale of such property immediately
prior to such distribution for an amount equal to its fair market value, and
had been allocated to the Partners, at such time, in the same manner as any
item of gain or loss actually recognized during such period would have been
allocated. In determining such Unrealized Gain or Unrealized Loss the
aggregate cash amount and fair market value of all Partnership assets
(including, without limitation, cash or cash equivalents) immediately prior to
a distribution shall (A) in the case of an actual distribution which is not
made pursuant to Section 12.4 or in the case of a deemed contribution and/or
distribution, be determined and allocated in the same manner as that provided
in Section 5.3(d)(i) or (B) in the case of a liquidating distribution
pursuant to Section 12.4, be determined and allocated by the Liquidator using
such reasonable method of valuation as it may adopt.

 

Section 5.4 _Issuances of Additional Partnership Securities_

 

(a) The Partnership may issue additional Partnership Securities and options,
rights, warrants and appreciation rights relating to the Partnership
Securities for any Partnership purpose at any time and from time to time to
such Persons for such consideration and on such terms and conditions as shall
be established by the Managing General Partner in its sole discretion, all
without the approval of any Limited Partners.

(b) Each additional Partnership Security authorized to be issued by the
Partnership pursuant to Section 5.4(a) may be issued in one or more classes,
or one or more series of any such classes, with such designations,
preferences, rights, powers and duties (which may be senior to existing
classes and series of Partnership Securities), as shall be fixed by the
Managing General Partner in the exercise of its sole discretion, including (i)
the right to share Partnership profits and losses or items thereof; (ii) the
right to share in Partnership distributions; (iii) the rights upon
dissolution and liquidation of the Partnership; (iv) whether, and the terms
and conditions upon which, the Partnership may redeem the Partnership
Security; (v) whether such Partnership Security is issued with the privilege
of conversion or exchange and, if so, the terms and conditions of such
conversion or exchange; (vi) the terms and conditions upon which each
Partnership Security will be issued, evidenced by certificates and assigned or
transferred; and (vii) the right, if any, of each such Partnership Security
to vote on Partnership matters, including matters relating to the relative
designations, preferences, rights, powers and duties of such Partnership
Security.

 

(c) The Managing General Partner is hereby authorized and directed to take all
actions that it deems necessary or appropriate in connection with (i) each
issuance of Partnership Securities and options, rights, warrants and
appreciation rights relating to Partnership Securities pursuant to this
Section 5.4, (ii) the admission of Additional Limited Partners and (iii) all
additional issuances of Partnership Securities. The Managing General Partner
is further authorized and directed to specify the relative rights, powers and
duties of the holders of the Units or other Partnership Securities being
so issued. The Managing General Partner shall do all things necessary to
comply with the Delaware Act and is authorized and directed to do all things
it deems to be necessary or advisable in connection with any future issuance
of Partnership Securities or in connection with the conversion of



 

B-23  the Non-Managing General Partner Interest into Units pursuant to the terms
of this Agreement, including compliance with any statute, rule, regulation or
guideline of any federal, state or other governmental agency or any, National
Securities Exchange on which the Units or other Partnership Securities are
listed for trading.

 

(d) Except with respect to Class B Units, no fractional Units shall be issued
by the Partnership.

 

Section 5.5 _Splits and Combinations_

 

(a) Subject to Section 5.5(d), the Partnership may make a Pro Rata
distribution of Partnership Securities to all Record Holders or may effect a
subdivision or combination of Partnership Securities so long as, after any
such event, each Partner shall have the same Percentage Interest in the
Partnership as before such event, and any amounts calculated on a per Unit
basis or stated as a number of Units (including the number of Common Units
into which the Class B Units may convert) are proportionately adjusted
retroactive to the beginning of the Partnership.

 

(b) Whenever such a distribution, subdivision or combination of Partnership
Securities is declared, the Managing General Partner shall select a Record
Date as of which the distribution, subdivision or combination shall be
effective and shall send notice thereof at least 20 days prior to such Record
Date to each Record Holder as of a date not less than 10 days prior to the
date of such notice. The Managing General Partner also may cause a firm of
independent public accountants selected by it to calculate the number of
Partnership Securities to be held by each Record Holder after giving effect to
such distribution, subdivision or combination. The Managing General Partner
shall be entitled to rely on any certificate provided by such firm as
conclusive evidence of the accuracy of such calculation.

 

(c) Promptly following any such distribution, subdivision or combination, the
Partnership may issue Certificates or uncertificated Partnership Securities
to the Record Holders of Partnership Securities as of the applicable Record
Date representing the new number of Partnership Securities held by such Record
Holders, or the Managing General Partner may adopt such other procedures as
it may deem appropriate to reflect such changes. If any such combination
results in a smaller total number of Partnership Securities Outstanding, the
Partnership shall require, as a condition to the delivery to a Record Holder
of such new Certificate or uncertificated Partnership Securities, the
surrender of any Certificate held by such Record Holder immediately prior to
such Record Date.

 

(d) Except with respect to Class B Units, the Partnership shall not issue
fractional Units upon any distribution, subdivision or combination of Units.
If a distribution, subdivision or combination of Units would result in the
issuance of fractional Units but for the provisions of Section 5.4(d) and this
Section 5.5(d), each fractional Unit (other than a fractional Class B Unit)
shall be rounded to the nearest whole Unit (and a 0.5 Unit shall be rounded to
the next higher Unit).

Section 5.6 _Fully Paid and Non-Assessable Nature of Limited Partner
Interests_

All Limited Partner Interests issued pursuant to, and in accordance with the
requirements of, this Article V shall be fully paid and non-assessable Limited
Partner Interests in the Partnership, except as such non assessability may be
affected by Section 17-607 of the Delaware Act.

 

Section 5.7 _Establishment of Class B Units_

 

(a) _General_. The Partnership hereby designates and creates a series of Units
to be designated as "Class B Units" and consisting of a total of 11,568,560
Class B Units, plus any additional Class B Units issued in kind as a
distribution pursuant to Section 5.7(b)(ii) (" _PIK Units_ "), having the same
rights and preferences, and subject to the same duties and obligations as the
Common Units, except as set forth in this Section 5.7 and Section 6.3.



 

B-24 (b) _Rights of Class B Units_. The Class B Units shall have the following
rights, preferences and privileges and shall be subject to the following
duties and obligations:

(i)  _Distributions_.

(A) Commencing with the Quarter ending on  , the holders of the
Class B Units as of an applicable Record Date shall be entitled to receive
Partnership distributions pursuant to Section 6.3 on a pro rata basis with
the Common Units; _provided, however_ , that such distributions shall be paid
in PIK Units. When any PIK Units are payable to a holder of Class B Units
pursuant to this Section 5.7(b), the Partnership shall issue the PIK Units to
such holder no later than forty-five (45) days after the end of each Quarter
(each such payment date, a " _Class B Distribution Payment Date_ "). The
number of PIK Units to be issued in connection with any Class B
Unit distribution shall be determined by dividing (i) the amount of cash paid
on one Common Unit with respect to such Quarter, by (ii) greater of (A) the
volume weighted average sales price of Common Units during the 20 trading day
period ending on the third trading day prior to the public announcement of
the transactions contemplated by the Agreement and Plan of Merger and (B) the
volume weighted average sales price of Common Units during the 20 trading day
period ending on the third day prior to the ex-dividend date for such
distribution. Unless otherwise expressly provided, references in this
Agreement to Class B Units shall include all PIK Units Outstanding as of the
date of such determination.

 

(B) Notwithstanding anything in this Section 5.7(b)(ii) to the contrary, with
respect to Class B Units that are converted into Common Units, the holder
thereof shall not be entitled to a Class B Unit distribution and a Common Unit
distribution with respect to the same period, but shall be entitled only to
the distribution to be paid based upon the class of Units held as of the
close of business on the applicable Record Date.

(C) On the Class B Distribution Payment Date, the Partnership shall issue to
such Class B Unitholder a certificate or certificates for the number of PIK
Units to which such Class B Unitholder shall be entitled. The issuance of the
PIK Units pursuant to this Section 5.7(b)(i) shall be deemed to have been
made on the first day of the Quarter following the Quarter in respect of which
such payment of PIK Units was due.

 

(ii) _Voting Rights_.

 

(A) The Class B Units shall have voting rights that are identical to the
voting rights of the Common Units and shall vote with the Common Units as a
single class, so that each Class B Unit will be entitled to one vote for each
Common Unit into which such Class B Units are convertible on each matter with
respect to which each Common Unit is entitled to vote. Each reference in this
Agreement to a vote of holders of Common Units shall be deemed to be a
reference to the holders of Common Units and Class B Units on an "as if"
converted basis, and the definition of "Unit Majority" shall correspondingly
be construed to mean at least a majority of the Common Units and the Class B
Units, on an "as if" converted basis, voting together as a single class during
any period in which any Class B Units are Outstanding.

 

(B) Notwithstanding any other provision of this Agreement, in addition to all
other requirements imposed by Delaware law, and all other voting rights
granted under this Agreement, the affirmative vote of the holders of a
majority of the Outstanding Class B Units, voting separately as a class based
upon one vote per Class B Unit, shall be necessary on any matter (including a
merger, consolidation or business combination) that adversely affects any of
the rights, preferences and privileges of the Class B Units in any respect or
amends or modifies any of the terms of the Class B Units; _provided_ ,
that the Partnership shall be able to amend this Section 5.7 so long as the
amendment does not adversely affect the holders of the Class B Units. Without
limiting the generality of the preceding sentence, such adverse effect,
amendment or modification includes any action that would:

(1) change the form of payment of distributions, defer the date from which
distributions on the Class B Units will accrue, cancel accrued and unpaid
distributions on the Class B Units or amend this Section 5.7;



 

B-25 (2) reduce the amount payable or change the form of payment to the holders of
the Class B Units upon the voluntary or involuntary liquidation, dissolution
or winding up of the Partnership; or

 

(3) make any distribution of any property other than PIK Units or other
Partnership Securities whose distribution is required or permitted by this
Section 5.7.

(iii) _Certificates_.

 

(A) The Class B Units shall be evidenced by certificates in such form as the
Board may approve and, subject to the satisfaction of any applicable legal,
regulatory and contractual requirements, may be assigned or transferred in a
manner identical to the assignment and transfer of other Units; unless and
until the Board determines to assign the responsibility to another Person,
the Partnership will act as the registrar and transfer agent for the Class B
Units. The certificates evidencing Class B Units shall be separately
identified and shall not bear the same CUSIP number as the certificates
evidencing Common Units.

(B) The certificate(s) representing the Class B Units may be imprinted with a
legend in substantially the following form:

"THIS SECURITY IS SUBJECT TO CERTAIN RESTRICTIONS ON TRANSFER AS SET FORTH IN
THE THIRD AMENDED AND RESTATED AGREEMENT LIMITED PARTNERSHIP OF THE
PARTNERSHIP, DATED AS OF , 2010, A COPY OF WHICH MAY BE OBTAINED
FROM THE PARTNERSHIP AT ITS PRINCIPAL EXECUTIVE OFFICES."

(iv) _Conversion_. Immediately, following the payment of the Quarterly cash
distribution on the Common Units, and the issuance of PIK Units in respect of
the Quarterly Class B Unit distribution, for the last Quarter of the four-
Quarter period following the Effective Date (the " _Initial Period_ "), 50% of
the Class B Units Outstanding that are held by each holder of a Class B Unit,
and all of the PIK Units issued during the Initial Period and Outstanding,
shall convert into Common Units at a conversion ratio of one Class B Unit or
PIK Unit for one Common Unit (the  _"Conversion Ratio"_ ). Immediately,
following the payment of the Quarterly cash distribution on the Common Units,
and the issuance of PIK Units in respect of the Quarterly Class B Unit
distribution, for the last Quarter of the eight-Quarter period following the
Effective Date (the " _Final Period_ "), the remainder of the Outstanding
Class B Units and all of the PIK Units issued during the Final Period and
Outstanding shall convert into Common Units at the Conversion Ratio.

(v) _Other Extraordinary Transactions Affecting the Partnership_. Prior to
the consummation of any recapitalization, reorganization, consolidation,
merger, spin-off or other business combination (not otherwise addressed in
this subsection) in which the holders of Common Units are to receive
securities, cash or other assets (a " _Partnership Event_ "), the Partnership
shall make appropriate provision to ensure that the holders of Class B Units
receive in such Partnership Event at least the same consideration as the
holders of Common Units. The Partnership may not consummate a Partnership
Event in which the consideration paid for each Class B Unit is different than
the consideration paid for each Common Unit without the prior written approval
of the holders of a majority of the Outstanding Class B Units. 



 

B-26 ARTICLE VI

 

ALLOCATIONS AND DISTRIBUTIONS

 

Section 6.1 _Allocations for Capital Account Purposes_

 

For purposes of maintaining the Capital Accounts and in determining the rights
of the Partners among themselves, the Partnerships items of income, gain,
loss and deduction (computed in accordance with Section 5.3(b)) shall be
allocated among the Partners in each taxable year (or portion thereof) as
provided herein below.

 

(a) _Net Income and Net Loss_. After giving effect to the special allocations
set forth in Sections 6.1(b) and (c), Net Income and Net Loss for each
taxable period and all items of income, gain, loss and deduction taken into
account in computing Net Income and Net Loss for such taxable period shall be
allocated to the Unitholders, Pro Rata.

 

(b) _Certain Special Allocations_. All IPCH/Inergy Partners Items shall be
allocated to the holders of the Common Units and Class B Units, Pro Rata.

(c) _Other Special Allocations_. Notwithstanding any other provision of
this Section 6.1, the following special allocations shall be made for such
taxable period:

(i)  _Partnership Minimum Gain Chargeback_. Notwithstanding any other
provision of this Section 6.1, if there is a net decrease in Partnership
Minimum Gain during any Partnership taxable period, each Partner shall be
allocated items of Partnership income and gain for such period (and, if
necessary, subsequent periods) in the manner and amounts provided in Treasury
Regulation Sections 1.704-2(f)(6), 1.704-2(g)(2) and 1.704-2(j)(2)(i), or any
successor provision. For purposes of this Section 6.1(c)(i), each Partners
Adjusted Capital Account balance shall be determined, and the allocation of
income or gain required hereunder shall be effected, prior to the application
of any other allocations pursuant to this Section 6.1(c)(i) with respect to
such taxable period (other than an allocation pursuant to Section 6.1(c)(v)
and Section 6.1(c)(vi)). This Section 6.1(c)(i) is intended to comply with the
Partnership Minimum Gain chargeback requirement in Treasury Regulation
Section 1.704-2(f) and shall be interpreted consistently therewith.

 

(ii) _Chargeback of Partner Nonrecourse Debt Minimum Gain_. Notwithstanding
the other provisions of this Section 6.1 (other than Section 6.1(c)(i)),
except as provided in Treasury Regulation Section 1.704-2(i)(4), if there is a
net decrease in Partner Nonrecourse Debt Minimum Gain during any Partnership
taxable period, any Partner with a share of Partner Nonrecourse Debt Minimum
Gain at the beginning of such taxable period shall be allocated items of
Partnership income and gain for such period (and, if necessary, subsequent
periods) in the manner and amounts provided in Treasury Regulation Sections
1.704-2(i)(4) and 1.704-2(j)(2)(ii), or any successor provisions. For purposes
of this Section 6.1(c)(ii), each Partners Adjusted Capital Account balance
shall be determined, and the allocation of income or gain required hereunder
shall be effected, prior to the application of any other allocations pursuant
to this Section 6.1(c)(ii), other than Section 6.1(c)(i) and other than an
allocation pursuant to Sections 6.1(c)(v) and 6.1(c)(vi), with respect to
such taxable period. This Section 6.1(c)(ii) is intended to comply with the
chargeback of items of income and gain requirement in Treasury Regulation
Section 1.704-2(i)(4) and shall be interpreted consistently therewith.

(iii) _Qualified Income Offset_. In the event any Partner unexpectedly
receives any adjustments, allocations or distributions described in Treasury
Regulation Section 1.704-1(b)(2)(ii)(d)(4), 1.704-1(b)(2)(ii)(d)(5), or
1.704-1(b)(2)(ii)(d)(6), items of Partnership income and gain shall be
specially allocated to such Partner in an amount and manner sufficient to
eliminate, to the extent required by the Treasury Regulations promulgated
under Section 704(b) of the Code, the deficit balance, if any, in its Adjusted
Capital Account created by such adjustments, allocations or distributions as
quickly as possible unless such deficit balance is otherwise eliminated
pursuant to Sections 6.1(c)(i) or 6.1(c)(ii).



 

B-27 (iv) _Gross Income Allocations_. In the event any Partner has a deficit
balance in its Capital Account at the end of any Partnership taxable period in
excess of the sum of (A) the amount such Partner is required to restore
pursuant to the provisions of this Agreement and (B) the amount such Partner
is deemed obligated to restore pursuant to Treasury Regulation Sections
1.704-2(g) and 1.704-2(i)(5), such Partner shall be specially allocated items
of Partnership gross income and gain in the amount of such excess as quickly
as possible; _provided_ , _however,_ that an allocation pursuant to this
Section 6.1(c)(iv) shall be made only if and to the extent that such Partner
would have a deficit balance in its Capital Account as adjusted after all
other allocations provided for in this Section 6.1 have been tentatively made
as if this Section 6.1(c)(iv) were not in this Agreement.

 

(v) _Nonrecourse Deductions_. Nonrecourse Deductions for any taxable period
shall be allocated to the Partners in accordance with their respective
Percentage Interests. If the Managing General Partner determines in its good
faith discretion that the Partnerships Nonrecourse Deductions must be
allocated in a different ratio to satisfy the safe harbor requirements of the
Treasury Regulations promulgated under Section 704(b) of the Code, the General
Partner is authorized, upon notice to the other Partners, to revise the
prescribed ratio to the numerically closest ratio that does satisfy
such requirements.

(vi) _Partner Nonrecourse Deductions_. Partner Nonrecourse Deductions for any
taxable period shall be allocated 100% to the Partner that bears the Economic
Risk of Loss with respect to the Partner Nonrecourse Debt to which such
Partner Nonrecourse Deductions are attributable in accordance with Treasury
Regulation Section 1.704-2(i). If more than one Partner bears the Economic
Risk of Loss with respect to a Partner Nonrecourse Debt, such Partner
Nonrecourse Deductions attributable thereto shall be allocated between or
among such Partners in accordance with the ratios in which they share such
Economic Risk of Loss.

(vii) _Nonrecourse Liabilities_. For purposes of Treasury Regulation Section
1.752-3(a)(3), the Partners agree that Nonrecourse Liabilities of the
Partnership in excess of the sum of (A) the amount of Partnership Minimum Gain
and (B) the total amount of Nonrecourse Built-in Gain shall be allocated
among the Partners in accordance with their respective Percentage Interests.

 

(viii) _Code Section 754 Adjustments_. To the extent an adjustment to the
adjusted tax basis of any Partnership asset pursuant to Section 734(b) or
743(c) of the Code is required, pursuant to Treasury Regulation Section
1.704-1(b)(2)(iv)(m), to be taken into account in determining Capital
Accounts, the amount of such adjustment to the Capital Accounts shall be
treated as an item of gain (if the adjustment increases the basis of the
asset) or loss (if the adjustment decreases such basis), and such item of gain
or loss shall be specially allocated to the Partners in a manner
consistent with the manner in which their Capital Accounts are required to be
adjusted pursuant to such Section of the Treasury Regulations.

 

(ix) _Curative Allocation_.

 

(A) Notwithstanding any other provision of this Section 6.1, other than the
Required Allocations, the Required Allocations shall be taken into account in
making the Agreed Allocations so that, to the extent possible, the net amount
of items of income, gain, loss and deduction allocated to each Partner
pursuant to the Required Allocations and the Agreed Allocations, together,
shall be equal to the net amount of such items that would have been allocated
to each such Partner under the Agreed Allocations had the Required Allocations
and the related Curative Allocation not otherwise been provided in this
Section 6.1. Notwithstanding the preceding sentence, Required Allocations
relating to (1) Nonrecourse Deductions shall not be taken into account except
to the extent that there has been a decrease in Partnership Minimum Gain
and (2) Partner Nonrecourse Deductions shall not be taken into account except
to the extent that there has been a decrease in Partner Nonrecourse Debt
Minimum Gain. Allocations pursuant to this Section 6.1(c)(ix)(A) shall only be
made with respect to Required Allocations to the extent the Managing General
Partner reasonably determines that such allocations will otherwise be
inconsistent with the economic agreement among the Partners. Further,
allocations pursuant to this Section 6.1(c)(ix)(A)shall be deferred with
respect to allocations pursuant to clauses



 

B-28  (1) and (2) hereof to the extent the Managing General Partner reasonably
determines that such allocations are likely to be offset by subsequent
Required Allocations.

 

(B) The Managing General Partner shall have reasonable discretion, with
respect to each taxable period, to (1) apply the provisions of Section
6.1(c)(ix)(A) in whatever order is most likely to minimize the economic
distortions that might otherwise result from the Required Allocations, and (2)
divide all allocations pursuant to Section 6.1(c)(ix)(A) among the Partners
in a manner that is likely to minimize such economic distortions.

(x) Items of income and gain allocated under the foregoing provisions of
Sections 6.1(c)(i), 6.1(c)(ii), 6.1(c)(iii) or 6.1(c)(viii) that are
IPCH/Inergy Partners Items shall, to the maximum extent possible, be allocated
to the holders of the Common Units and Class B Units, Pro Rata.

(xi) Any income, gain, loss, or deduction realized as a direct or indirect
result of the issuance of PIK Units to a Partner (the "Issuance Items") shall
be allocated among the Partners so that, to the extent possible, the net
amount of such Issuance Items, together with all other allocations under this
Agreement to each Partner, shall be equal to the net amount that would have
been allocated to each such Partner if the Issuance Items had not been
realized.

 

Section 6.2 _Allocations for Tax Purposes_

 

(a) Except as otherwise provided herein, for federal income tax purposes, each
item of income, gain, loss and deduction shall be allocated among the
Partners in the same manner as its correlative item of " _book_ " income,
gain, loss or deduction is allocated pursuant to Section 6.1.

 

(b) In an attempt to eliminate Book-Tax Disparities attributable to a
Contributed Property or Adjusted Property, items of income, gain, loss,
depreciation, amortization and cost recovery deductions shall be allocated for
federal income tax purposes among the Partners as follows:

 

(i) In the case of a Contributed Property, such items attributable thereto (A)
shall be allocated among the Partners in the manner provided under Section
704(c) of the Code that takes into account the variation between the Agreed
Value of such property and its adjusted basis at the time of contribution; and
(B) any item of Residual Gain or Residual Loss attributable to a Contributed
Property shall be allocated among the Partners in the same manner as its
correlative item of " _book_ " gain or loss is allocated pursuant to Section
6.1.

 

(ii) In the case of an Adjusted Property, such items shall (A) first, be
allocated among the Partners in a manner consistent with the principles of
Section 704(c) of the Code to take into account the Unrealized Gain or
Unrealized Loss attributable to such property and the allocations thereof
pursuant to Sections 5.3(d)(i) or 5.3(d)(ii), (B) second, in the event such
property was originally a Contributed Property, be allocated among the
Partners in a manner consistent with Section 6.2(b)(i)(A); and (C) third, any
item of Residual Gain or Residual Loss attributable to an Adjusted
Property shall be allocated among the Partners in the same manner as its
correlative item of " _book_ " gain or loss is allocated pursuant to Section
6.1.

 

(iii) The Managing General Partner shall apply the principles of Treasury
Regulation Section 1.704-3(d) to eliminate Book-Tax Disparities.

(c) For the proper administration of the Partnership and for the preservation
of uniformity of the Limited Partner Interests (or any class or classes
thereof), the Managing General Partner shall have sole discretion to (i) adopt
such conventions as it deems appropriate in determining the amount of
depreciation, amortization and cost recovery deductions; (ii) make special
allocations for federal income tax purposes of income (including, without
limitation, gross income) or deductions; and (iii) amend the provisions of
this Agreement as appropriate (x) to reflect the proposal or promulgation of
Treasury Regulations under Section 704(b) or Section 704(c) of the Code or (y)
otherwise to preserve or achieve uniformity of the Limited Partner Interests
(or any class or classes thereof). The Managing General Partner may adopt
such conventions, make such allocations and make such



 

B-29  amendments to this Agreement as provided in this Section 6.2(c) only if such
conventions, allocations or amendments would not have a material adverse
effect on the Partners, the holders of any class or classes of Limited
Partner Interests issued and Outstanding or the Partnership, and if such
allocations are consistent with the principles of Section 704 of the Code.

 

(d) The Managing General Partner in its discretion may determine to depreciate
or amortize the portion of an adjustment under Section 743(b) of the Code
attributable to unrealized appreciation in any Adjusted Property (to the
extent of the unamortized Book-Tax Disparity) using a predetermined rate
derived from the depreciation or amortization method and useful life applied
to the Partnerships common basis of such property, despite any inconsistency
of such approach with Treasury Regulation Section 1.167(c)-1(a)(6) or any
successor regulations thereto. If the Managing General Partner determines
that such reporting position cannot reasonably be taken, the Managing General
Partner may adopt depreciation and amortization conventions under which all
purchasers acquiring Limited Partner Interests in the same month would receive
depreciation and amortization deductions, based upon the same applicable rate
as if they had purchased a direct interest in the Partnerships property. If
the Managing General Partner chooses not to utilize such aggregate method, the
Managing General Partner may use any other reasonable depreciation and
amortization conventions to preserve the uniformity of the intrinsic tax
characteristics of any Limited Partner Interests that would not have a
material adverse effect on the Limited Partners or the Record Holders of any
class or classes of Limited Partner Interests.

(e) Any gain allocated to the Partners upon the sale or other taxable
disposition of any Partnership asset shall, to the extent possible, after
taking into account other required allocations of gain pursuant to this
Section 6.2, be characterized as Recapture Income in the same proportions and
to the same extent as such Partners (or their predecessors in interest) have
been allocated any deductions directly or indirectly giving rise to the
treatment of such gains as Recapture Income.

 

(f) All items of income, gain, loss, deduction and credit recognized by the
Partnership for federal income tax purposes and allocated to the Partners in
accordance with the provisions hereof shall be determined without regard to
any election under Section 754 of the Code which may be made by the
Partnership; _provided, however_ , that such allocations, once made, shall
be adjusted as necessary or appropriate to take into account those
adjustments permitted or required by Sections 734 and 743 of the Code.

 

(g) Each item of Partnership income, gain, loss and deduction, shall for
federal income tax purposes, be determined on an annual basis and prorated on
a monthly basis and shall be allocated to the Partners as of the opening of
the New York Stock Exchange on the first Business Day of each month;
_provided, however_ , that gain or loss on a sale or other disposition of any
assets of the Partnership or any other extraordinary item of income or loss
realized and recognized other than in the ordinary course of business, as
determined by the Managing General Partner in its sole discretion, shall be
allocated to the Partners as of the opening of the New York Stock Exchange on
the first Business Day of the month in which such gain or loss is recognized
for federal income tax purposes. The Managing General Partner may revise,
alter or otherwise modify such methods of allocation as it determines
necessary or appropriate in its sole discretion, to the extent permitted or
required by Section 706 of the Code and the regulations or rulings promulgated
thereunder.

 

(h) Allocations that would otherwise be made to a Limited Partner under the
provisions of this Article VI shall instead be made to the beneficial owner
of Limited Partner Interests held by a nominee in any case in which the
nominee has furnished the identity of such owner to the Partnership in
accordance with Section 6031(c) of the Code or any other method acceptable to
the Managing General Partner in its sole discretion.

Section 6.3 _Requirement and Characterization of Distributions; Distributions
to Record Holders_

(a) Subject to Section 5.7(b)(i) and Section 7.5(e), within 45 days
following the end of each Quarter, an amount equal to 100% of Available Cash
with respect to such Quarter shall, subject to Section 17-607 of the Delaware
Act, be distributed in accordance with this Article VI by the Partnership to
the Unitholders as of the Record Date selected by the Managing General
Partner in its reasonable discretion.



 

B-30 (b) Notwithstanding Section 6.3(a), in the event of the dissolution and
liquidation of the Partnership, all receipts received during or after the
Quarter in which the Liquidation Date occurs, other than from borrowings
described in (a)(ii) of the definition of Available Cash, shall be applied and
distributed solely in accordance with, and subject to the terms and
conditions of, Section 12.4.

(c) In the event of the dissolution and liquidation of the Partnership, all
receipts received during or after the Quarter in which the Liquidation Date
occurs shall be applied and distributed solely in accordance with, and subject
to the terms and conditions of, Section 12.4.

 

(d) The Managing General Partner shall have the discretion to treat taxes paid
by the Partnership on behalf of, or amounts withheld with respect to, all or
less than all of the Partners as if they had been distributed to the Partner
on whose behalf the taxes were held or paid.

 

(e) Each distribution in respect of a Partnership Interest shall be paid by
the Partnership, directly or through the Transfer Agent or through any other
Person or agent, only to the Record Holder of such Partnership Interest as of
the Record Date set for such distribution. Such payment shall constitute full
payment and satisfaction of the Partnerships liability in respect of such
payment, regardless of any claim of any Person who may have an interest in
such payment by reason of an assignment or otherwise.

 

(f) Subject to Section 5.7(b)(i), all IPCH/Inergy Partners Available Cash
shall be distributed to the holders of the Common Units and the Class B
Units, Pro Rata.

(g) Subject to Section 5.7(b)(i), all other distributions of cash and other
property shall be made to the Unitholders, Pro Rata.

Section 6.4 _Special Provisions Relating to Class B Unitholders_

 

(a) Subject to transfer restrictions in Section 4.7 of this Agreement, a
Unitholder holding a Conversion Common Unit shall provide notice to the
Partnership of any Transfer of the Conversion Common Unit by the earlier of
(i) thirty (30) days following such Transfer and (ii) the last Business Day of
the calendar year during which such transfer occurred, unless (x) the
transfer is to an Affiliate of such Unitholder or (y) by virtue of the
application of Section 6.2(b), the Partnership has previously determined,
based on advice of counsel, that the Conversion Common Unit should have, as
a substantive matter, like intrinsic economic and federal income tax
characteristics of an Initial Common Unit. In connection with the condition
imposed by this Section 6.4, the Partnership shall take whatever steps are
required to provide economic uniformity to the Conversion Common Unit in
preparation for a transfer of such Unit; _provided, however_ , that no such
steps may be taken that would have a material adverse effect on the
Unitholders holding Common Units represented by Common Unit Certificates (for
this purpose the allocations of income, gains, losses and deductions, and the
making of any guaranteed payments or any reallocation of Capital Account
balances among the Partners in accordance with Section 6.2(b) hereof and
Proposed Treasury Regulation Section 1.704-1(b)(2)(iv)(s)(4) with respect to
Class B Units or Common Units will be deemed not to have a material adverse
effect on the Unitholders holding Common Units).

 

(b) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary set forth in this Agreement, the
holders of the Class B Units (a) shall (i) possess the rights and obligations
provided in this Agreement with respect to a Limited Partner pursuant to
Article III and Article VII and (ii) in accordance with Sections 5.3(a) and
5.3(d)(i), have a Capital Account as a Partner all other provisions related
thereto and (b) shall not (i) be entitled to vote on any matters requiring the
approval or vote of the holders of Outstanding Units, except as provided in
Section 5.7 or (ii) be entitled to any distributions other than as provided
in Section 5.7 and Article VI.

disposition of all or substantially all of the assets of the Operating
Company, without the approval of holders of a Unit Majority; _provided,
however_ , that this provision shall not preclude or limit the Managing
General Partners ability to mortgage, pledge, hypothecate or grant a security
interest in all or substantially all of the assets of the Partnership or
Operating Company and shall not apply to any forced sale of any or all of the
assets of the Partnership or Operating Company pursuant to the foreclosure of,
or other realization upon, any such encumbrance. Without the approval of
holders of a Unit Majority, the Managing General Partner shall not, on behalf

payments it makes on behalf of the Partnership (including salary, bonus,

Affiliates of the Managing General Partner to perform services for the
Partnership or for the Managing General Partner in the discharge of its
duties to the Partnership), and (ii) all other necessary or appropriate
expenses allocable to the Partnership or otherwise reasonably incurred by the
Managing General Partner in connection with operating the

Affiliates, in each case for the benefit of employees of the Managing General

services performed, directly or indirectly, for the benefit of the
Partnership Group. The Partnership agrees to issue and sell to the Managing
General Partner or any of its Affiliates any Partnership Securities that the
Managing General Partner or such Affiliates are obligated to provide to

or employee practices. Expenses incurred by the Managing General Partner in
connection with any such plans, programs and practices (including the net cost
to the Managing General Partner or such Affiliates of Partnership Securities
purchased by the Managing General Partner or such Affiliates from the
Partnership to fulfill options or awards under such plans, programs and
practices) shall be reimbursed in accordance with Section 7.4(b). Any and all
obligations of the Managing General Partner under any employee benefit plans,
employee programs or employee practices adopted by the Managing General
Partner as permitted by this Section 7.4(c) shall constitute obligations of
the Managing General Partner hereunder and shall be assumed by any successor
Managing General Partner approved pursuant to Sections 11.1 to 11.2 or the
transferee of or successor to all of the Managing General Partners General
Partner Interest.

Section 7.5 _Outside Activities_

 

(a) For so long as it is a General Partner of the Partnership, the Managing
General Partner (i) agrees that its sole business will be to act as a general
partner or managing member of the Partnership and any other partnership or
limited liability company of which the Partnership or the Operating Company
is, directly or indirectly, a partner or member and to undertake
activities that are ancillary or related thereto (including being a limited
partner in the Partnership) and (ii) shall not engage in any business or
activity or incur any debts or liabilities except in connection with or
incidental to (A) its performance as general partner or managing member of
one or more Group Members or as described in or contemplated by the
Registration Statement or (B) the acquiring, owning or disposing of debt or
equity securities in any Group Member. 



 

B-34 (b) Except as specifically restricted by Section 7.5(a), each Indemnitee
(other than the Managing General Partner) shall have the right to engage in
businesses of every type and description and other activities for profit and
to engage in and possess an interest in other business ventures of any and
every type or description, whether in businesses engaged in or anticipated to
be engaged in by any Group Member, independently or with others, including
business interests and activities in direct competition with the business and
activities of any Group Member, and none of the same shall constitute a
breach of this Agreement or any duty express or implied by law to any Group
Member or any Partner or Assignee. Neither any Group Member, any Limited
Partner nor any other Person shall have any rights by virtue of
this Agreement, the Operating Company Agreement or the partnership
relationship established hereby or thereby in any business ventures of any
Indemnitee.

 

(c) Subject to the terms of Section 7.5(a) and Section 7.5(b), but otherwise
notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement, (i) the engaging
in competitive activities by any Indemnitees (other than the Managing General
Partner) in accordance with the provisions of this Section 7.5 is hereby
approved by the Partnership and all Partners, (ii) it shall be deemed not to
be a breach of the Managing General Partners fiduciary duties or any other
obligation of any type whatsoever of the Managing General Partner for the
Indemnitees (other than the Managing General Partner) to engage in
such business interests and activities in preference to or to the exclusion
of the Partnership and (iii) the Managing General Partner and the Indemnities
shall have no obligation to present business opportunities to the Partnership.

 

(d) The Managing General Partner and any of their Affiliates may acquire Units
or other Partnership Securities and, except as otherwise provided in this
Agreement, shall be entitled to exercise all rights of a General Partner or
Limited Partner, as applicable, relating to such Units or Partnership
Securities.

 

(e) The term " _Affiliates_ " when used in Section 7.5(a) and Section 7.5(d)
with respect to the General Partner shall not include any Group Member or any
Subsidiary of the Group Member.

(f) Anything in this Agreement to the contrary notwithstanding, to the extent
that provisions of Sections 7.7, 7.8, 7.9, 7.10 or other Sections of this
Agreement purport or are interpreted to have the effect of restricting the
fiduciary duties that might otherwise, as a result of Delaware or other
applicable law, be owed by the Managing General Partner to the Partnership and
its Limited Partners, or to constitute a waiver or consent by the Limited
Partners to any such restriction, such provisions shall be inapplicable and
have no effect in determining whether the Managing General Partner has
complied with their fiduciary duties in connection with determinations made by
it under this Section 7.5.

 

Section 7.6 _Loans from the Managing General Partner; Loans or Contributions
from the Partnership; Contracts with Affiliates; Certain Restrictions on the
Managing General Partner_

(a) The Managing General Partner or any of its Affiliates may lend to
any Group Member, and any Group Member may borrow from the Managing General
Partner or any of its Affiliates, funds needed or desired by the Group Member
for such periods of time and in such amounts as the Managing General Partner
may determine;  _provided, however_ , that in any such case the lending party
may not charge the borrowing party interest at a rate greater than the rate
that would be charged the borrowing party or impose terms less favorable to
the borrowing party than would be charged or imposed on the borrowing party
by unrelated lenders on comparable loans made on an arms-length basis
(without reference to the lending partys financial abilities or guarantees).
The borrowing party shall reimburse the lending party for any costs (other
than any additional interest costs) incurred by the lending party in
connection with the borrowing of such funds. For purposes of this Section

than another Group Member).

 

(b) The Partnership may lend or contribute to any Group Member, and any Group
Member may borrow from the Partnership, funds on terms and conditions
established in the sole discretion of the Managing General Partner; _provided,
however_ , that the Partnership may not charge the Group Member interest at a
rate less than the

 



 

B-35  rate that would be charged to the Group Member (without reference to the
Managing General Partners financial abilities or guarantees) by unrelated
lenders on comparable loans. The foregoing authority shall be exercised by
the Managing General Partner in its sole discretion and shall not create any
right or benefit. in favor of any Group Member or any other Person.

 

(c) The Managing General Partner may, or may enter into an agreement with any
of its Affiliates to, render services to a Group Member or to the Managing
General Partner in the discharge of its duties as general partner of the
Partnership. Any services rendered to a Group Member by the Managing General
Partner or any of its Affiliates shall be on terms that are fair and
reasonable to the Partnership; _provided, however_ , that the requirements of
this Section 7.6(c) shall be deemed satisfied as to (i) any transaction
approved by Special Approval, (ii) any transaction, the terms of which are no
less favorable to the Partnership Group than those generally being provided
to or available from unrelated third parties or (iii) any transaction that,
taking into account the totality of the relationships between the parties
involved (including other transactions that may be particularly favorable or
advantageous to the Partnership Group), is equitable to the Partnership Group.
The provisions of Section 7.4 shall apply to the rendering of services
described in this Section 7.6(c). 

(d) The Partnership Group may transfer assets to joint ventures, other
partnerships, corporations, limited liability companies or other business
entities in which it is or thereby becomes a participant upon such terms and
subject to such conditions as are consistent with this Agreement and
applicable law.

 

(e) Neither the Managing General Partner nor any of their Affiliates shall
sell, transfer or convey any property to, or purchase any property from, the
Partnership, directly or indirectly, except pursuant to transactions that are
fair and reasonable to the Partnership; _provided, however_ , that the
requirements of this Section 7.6(e) shall be deemed to be satisfied as to (i)
any transaction approved by Special Approval, (ii) any transaction, the terms
of which are no less favorable to the Partnership than those generally being
provided to or available from unrelated third parties, or (iii)
any transaction that, taking into account the totality of the relationships
between the parties involved (including other transactions that may be
particularly favorable or advantageous to the Partnership), is equitable to
the Partnership. With respect to any contribution of assets to the
Partnership in exchange for Partnership Securities, the Conflicts Committee,
in determining whether the appropriate number of Partnership Securities are
being issued, may take into account, among other things, the fair market
value of the assets, the liquidated and contingent liabilities assumed, the
tax basis in the assets, the extent to which tax-only allocations to the
transferor will protect the existing partners of the Partnership against a low
tax basis, and such other factors as the Conflicts Committee deems relevant
under the circumstances.

(f) The Managing General Partner and its Affiliates will have no obligation
to permit any Group Member to use any facilities or assets of the Managing
General Partner and its Affiliates, except as may be provided in contracts
entered into from time to time specifically dealing with such use, nor shall
there be any obligation on the part of the Managing General Partner or its
Affiliates to enter into such contracts.

 

(g) Without limitation of Sections 7.6(a) through 7.6(f), and notwithstanding
anything to the contrary in this Agreement, the existence of the conflicts of
interest described in the Registration Statement are hereby approved by all
Partners.

Section 7.7  _Indemnification_

(a) To the fullest extent permitted by law but subject to the limitations
expressly provided in this Agreement, all Indemnitees shall be indemnified
and held harmless by the Partnership from and against any and all losses,
claims, damages, liabilities, joint or several, expenses (including legal fees
and expenses), judgments, fines, penalties, interest, settlements or other
amounts arising from any and all claims, demands, actions, suits or
proceedings, whether civil, criminal, administrative or investigative, in
which any Indemnitee may be involved, or is threatened to be involved, as
a party or otherwise, by reason of its status as an Indemnitee; _provided_ ,
that in each case the Indemnitee acted in good faith and in a manner that such
Indemnitee reasonably believed to be in, or (in the case of a Person other
than the Managing General Partner) not opposed to, the best interests of the



 

B-36  Partnership and, with respect to any criminal proceeding, had no reasonable
cause to believe its conduct was unlawful. The termination of any action, suit
or proceeding by judgment, order, settlement, conviction or upon a plea of
nolo contendere, or its equivalent, shall not create a presumption that the
Indemnitee acted in a manner contrary to that specified above. Any
indemnification pursuant to this Section 7.7 shall be made only out of the
assets of the Partnership, it being agreed that the Managing General Partner
shall not be personally liable for such indemnification and shall have no
obligation to contribute or loan any monies or property to the Partnership
to enable it to effectuate such indemnification.

(b) To the fullest extent permitted by law, expenses (including legal fees
and expenses) incurred by an Indemnitee who is indemnified pursuant to
Section 7.7(a) in defending any claim, demand, action, suit or proceeding
shall, from time to time, be advanced by the Partnership prior to the final
disposition of such claim, demand, action, suit or proceeding upon receipt by
the Partnership of any undertaking by or on behalf of the Indemnitee to repay
such amount if it shall be determined that the Indemnitee is not entitled to
be indemnified as authorized in this Section 7.7.

(c) The indemnification provided by this Section 7.7 shall be in addition to
any other rights to which an Indemnitee may be entitled under any agreement,
pursuant to any vote of the holders of Outstanding Limited Partner Interests,
as a matter of law or otherwise, both as to actions in the Indemnitees
capacity as an Indemnitee and as to actions in any other capacity (including
any capacity under the Underwriting Agreement), and shall continue as to an
Indemnitee who has ceased to serve in such capacity and shall inure to the
benefit of the heirs, successors, assigns and administrators of the
Indemnitee.

(d) The Partnership may purchase and maintain (or reimburse the Managing
General Partner or its Affiliates for the cost of) insurance, on behalf of
the Managing General Partner, its Affiliates and such other Persons as the
Managing General Partner shall determine, against any liability that may be
asserted against or expense that may be incurred by such Person in connection
with the Partnerships activities or such Persons activities on behalf of the
Partnership, regardless of whether the Partnership would have the power to
indemnify such Person against such liability under the provisions of this
Agreement.

(e) For purposes of this Section 7.7, the Partnership shall be deemed to have
requested an Indemnitee to serve as fiduciary of an employee benefit plan
whenever the performance by it of its duties to the Partnership also imposes
duties on, or otherwise involves services by, it to the plan or participants
or beneficiaries of the plan; excise taxes assessed on an Indemnitee with
respect to an employee benefit plan pursuant to applicable law shall
constitute " _fines"_ within the meaning of Section 7.7(a); and action taken
or omitted by the Indemnitee with respect to any employee benefit plan in the
performance of its duties for a purpose reasonably believed by it to be in the
interest of the participants and beneficiaries of the plan shall be deemed to
be for a purpose which is in, or not opposed to, the best interests of the
Partnership.

(f) In no event may an Indemnitee subject the Limited Partners to personal
liability by reason of the indemnification provisions set forth in this
Agreement.

(g) An Indemnitee shall not be denied indemnification in whole or in part
under this Section 7.7 because the Indemnitee had an interest in the
transaction with respect to which the indemnification applies if the
transaction was otherwise permitted by the terms of this Agreement. 

(h) The provisions of this Section 7.7 are for the benefit of the Indemnitees,
their heirs, successors, assigns and administrators and shall not be deemed
to create any rights for the benefit of any other Persons.

(i) No amendment, modification or repeal of this Section 7.7 or any provision
hereof shall in any manner terminate, reduce or impair the right of any past,
present or future Indemnitee to be indemnified by the Partnership, nor the
obligations of the Partnership to indemnify any such Indemnitee under and in
accordance with the provisions of this Section 7.7 as in effect immediately
prior to such amendment, modification or repeal with respect to claims arising
from or relating to matters occurring, in whole or-in part, prior to such
amendment, modification or repeal, regardless of when such claims may arise or
be asserted.



 

B-37 Section 7.8 _Liability of Indemnitees_

 

(a) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary set forth in this Agreement, no
Indemnitee shall be liable for monetary damages to the Partnership, the
Limited Partners, the Assignees or any other Persons who have acquired
interests in the Partnership Securities, for losses sustained or liabilities
incurred as a result of any act or omission if such Indemnitee acted in good
faith. 

(b) Subject to its obligations and duties as Managing General Partner set
forth in Section 7.1(a), the Managing General Partner may exercise any of the
powers granted to it by this Agreement and perform any of the duties imposed
upon it hereunder either directly or by or through its agents, and the
Managing General Partner shall not be responsible for any misconduct or
negligence on the part of any such agent appointed by the Managing General
Partner in good faith.

(c) To the extent that, at law or in equity, an Indemnitee has duties
(including fiduciary duties) and liabilities relating thereto to the
Partnership or to the Partners, the Managing General Partner and any other
Indemnitee acting in connection with the Partnerships business or affairs
shall not be liable to the Partnership or to any Partner for its good faith
reliance on the provisions of this Agreement. The provisions of this
Agreement, to the extent that they restrict or otherwise modify the duties
and liabilities of an Indemnitee otherwise existing at law or in equity, are
agreed by the Partners to replace such other duties and liabilities of such
Indemnitee.

 

(d) Any amendment, modification or repeal of this Section 7.8 or any provision
hereof shall be prospective only and shall not in any way affect the
limitations on the liability to the Partnership, the Limited Partners, the
Managing General Partner, and the Partnerships and the Managing General
Partners directors, officers and employees under this Section 7.8 as in
effect immediately prior to such amendment, modification or repeal with
respect to claims arising from or relating to matters occurring, in whole or
in part, prior to such amendment, modification or repeal, regardless of when
such claims may arise or be asserted.

Section 7.9 _Resolution of Conflicts of Interest_

 

(a) Unless otherwise expressly provided in this Agreement or the Operating
Company Agreement, whenever a potential conflict of interest exists or arises
between the Managing General Partner or any of its Affiliates, on the one
hand, and the Partnership, the Operating Company, any Partner or any Assignee,
on the other, any resolution or course of action by the Managing
General Partner or its Affiliates in respect of such conflict of interest
shall be permitted and deemed approved by all Partners, and shall not
constitute a breach of this Agreement, of the Operating Company Agreement, of
any agreement contemplated herein or therein, or of any duty stated or
implied by law or equity, if the resolution or course of action is, or by
operation of this Agreement is deemed to be, fair and reasonable to the
Partnership. The Managing General Partner shall be authorized but not
required in connection with its resolution of such conflict of interest to
seek Special Approval of such resolution. Any conflict of interest and any
resolution of such conflict of interest shall be conclusively deemed fair and
reasonable to the Partnership if such conflict of interest or resolution is
(i) approved by Special Approval (as long as the material facts known to the
Managing General Partner or any of its Affiliates regarding any proposed
transaction were disclosed to the Conflicts Committee at the time it gave its
approval), (ii) on terms no less favorable to the Partnership than those
generally being provided to or available from unrelated third parties or (iii)
fair to the Partnership, taking into account the totality of the
relationships between the parties involved (including other transactions that
may be particularly favorable or advantageous to the Partnership). The
Managing General Partner may also adopt a resolution or course of action that
has not received Special Approval. The Managing General Partner (including the
Conflicts Committee in connection with any Special Approval) shall be
authorized in connection with its determination of what is "fair and
reasonable" to the Partnership and in connection with its resolution of any
conflict of interest to consider (A) the relative interests of any party to
such conflict, agreement, transaction or situation and the benefits and
burdens relating to such interest; (B) any customary or accepted industry
practices and any customary or historical dealings with a particular Person;
(C) any applicable generally accepted accounting practices or principles; and
(D) such additional factors as the Managing General Partner (including the
Conflicts Committee) determines in its sole



 

B-38  discretion to be relevant, reasonable or appropriate under the
circumstances. Nothing contained in this Agreement, however, is intended to
nor shall it be construed to require the Managing General Partner (including
the Conflicts Committee) to consider the interests of any Person other than
the Partnership. In the absence of bad faith by the Managing General Partner,
the resolution, action or terms so made, taken or provided by the Managing
General Partner with respect to such matter shall not constitute a breach of
this Agreement or any other agreement contemplated herein or a breach of any
standard of care or duty imposed herein or therein or, to the extent permitted
by law, under the Delaware Act or any other law, rule or regulation.

(b) Whenever this Agreement or any other agreement contemplated hereby
provides that the Managing General Partner or any of its Affiliates is
permitted or required to make a decision (i) in its "sole discretion" or
"discretion," that it deems "necessary or appropriate" or "necessary or
advisable" or under a grant of similar authority or latitude, except as
otherwise provided herein, the Managing General Partner or such Affiliate
shall be entitled to consider only such interests and factors as it desires
and shall have no duty or obligation to give any consideration to any
interest of, or factors affecting, the Partnership, the Operating Company, any
Limited Partner or any Assignee, (ii) it may make such decision in its sole
discretion (regardless of whether there is a reference to "sole discretion"
or "discretion") unless another express standard is provided for, or (iii) in
"good faith" or under another express standard, the Managing General Partner
or such Affiliate shall act under such express standard and shall not be
subject to any other or different standards imposed by this Agreement, the
Operating Company Agreement, any other agreement contemplated hereby or under
the Delaware Act or any other law, rule or regulation. In addition, any
actions taken by the Managing General Partner or such Affiliate consistent
with the standards of "reasonable discretion" set forth in the definition of
Available Cash shall not constitute a breach of any duty of the Managing
General Partner to the Partnership or the Limited Partners. The Managing
General Partner shall have no duty, express or implied, to sell or otherwise
dispose of any asset of the Partnership Group other than in the ordinary
course of business.

(c) Whenever a particular transaction, arrangement or resolution of a conflict
of interest is required under this Agreement to be "fair and reasonable" to
any Person, the fair and reasonable nature of such transaction, arrangement or
resolution shall be considered in the context of all similar or related
transactions.

 

(d) The Unitholders hereby authorize the Managing General Partner, on behalf
of the Partnership as a partner or member of a Group Member, to approve of
actions by the general partner or managing member of such Group Member similar
to those actions permitted to be taken by the Managing General Partner
pursuant to this Section 7.9.

 

Section 7.10 _Other Matters Concerning the Managing General Partner_

 

(a) The Managing General Partner may rely and shall be protected in acting or
refraining from acting upon any resolution, certificate, statement,
instrument, opinion, report, notice, request, consent, order, bond, debenture
or other paper or document believed by it to be genuine and to have been
signed or presented by the proper party or parties.

 

(b) The Managing General Partner may consult with legal counsel, accountants,
appraisers, management consultants, investment bankers and other consultants
and advisers selected by it, and any act taken or omitted to be taken in
reliance upon the opinion (including an Opinion of Counsel) of such Persons as
to matters that such General Partner reasonably believes to be within
such Persons professional or expert competence shall be conclusively
presumed to have been done or omitted in good faith and in accordance with
such opinion.

 

(c) The Managing General Partner shall have the right, in respect of any of
its powers or obligations hereunder, to act through any of its duly
authorized officers, a duly appointed attorney or attorneys-in-fact or the
duly authorized officers of the Partnership.

 

(d) Any standard of care and duty imposed by this Agreement or under the
Delaware Act or any applicable law, rule or regulation shall be modified,
waived or limited to the extent permitted by law, as required to permit



 

B-39  the Managing General Partner to act under this Agreement or any other
agreement contemplated by this Agreement and to make any decision pursuant to
the authority prescribed in this Agreement, so long as such action is
reasonably believed by the Managing General Partner to be in, or not
inconsistent with, the best interests of the Partnership.

 

Section 7.11 _Purchase or Sale of Partnership Securities_

 

The Managing General Partner may cause the Partnership to purchase or
otherwise acquire Partnership Securities other than Class B Units. As long as
Partnership Securities are held by any Group Member, such Partnership
Securities shall not be considered Outstanding for any purpose, except as
otherwise provided herein. The Managing General Partner or any of its
Affiliates may also purchase or otherwise acquire and sell or otherwise
dispose of Partnership Securities for their own account, subject to the
provisions of Articles IV and X.

 

Section 7.12 _Registration Rights of the Managing General Partner and its
Affiliates_

 

(a) If (i) the Managing General Partner or any Affiliate of the Managing
General Partner (including for purposes of this Section 7.12, any Person that
is an Affiliate of the Managing General Partner at the date of this Agreement
notwithstanding that it may later cease to be an Affiliate of the General
Partner) holds Partnership Securities that it desires to sell and (ii) Rule
144 of the Securities Act (or any successor rule or regulation to Rule 144) or
another exemption from registration is not available to enable such holder of
Partnership Securities (the " _Holder_ ") to dispose of the number of
Partnership Securities it desires to sell at the time it desires to do so
without registration under the Securities Act, then upon the request of such
General Partner or any of its Affiliates, the Partnership shall file with the
Commission as promptly as practicable after receiving such request, and use
all reasonable efforts to cause to become effective and remain effective for a
period of not less than six months following its effective date or such
shorter period as shall terminate when all Partnership Securities covered by
such registration statement have been sold, a registration statement under the
Securities Act registering the offering and sale of the number of Partnership
Securities specified by the Holder; _provided, however_ , that the
Partnership shall not be required to effect more than three registrations
pursuant to this Section 7.12(a); and provided further, that if the Conflicts
Committee determines in its good faith judgment that a postponement of the
requested registration for up to six months would be in the best interests of
the Partnership and its Partners due to a pending transaction, investigation
or other event, the filing of such registration statement or the effectiveness
thereof may be deferred for up to six months, but not thereafter. In
connection with any registration pursuant to the immediately preceding
sentence, the Partnership shall promptly prepare and file (x) such documents
as may be necessary to register or qualify the securities subject to such
registration under the securities laws of such states as the Holder shall
reasonably request; _provided, however_ , that no such qualification shall be
required in any jurisdiction where, as a result thereof, the Partnership
would become subject to general service of process or to taxation or
qualification to do business as a foreign corporation or partnership doing
business in such jurisdiction solely as a result of such registration,
and (y) such documents as may be necessary to apply for listing or to list
the Partnership Securities subject to such registration on such National
Securities Exchange as the Holder shall reasonably request, and do any and all
other acts and things that may reasonably be necessary or advisable to enable
the Holder to consummate a public sale of such Partnership Securities in such
states. Except as set forth in Section 7.12(c), all costs and expenses of any
such registration and offering (other than the underwriting discounts and
commissions) shall be paid by the Partnership, without reimbursement by the
Holder.

 

(b) If the Partnership shall at any time propose to file a registration
statement under the Securities Act for an offering of equity securities of
the Partnership for cash (other than an offering relating solely to an
employee benefit plan), the Partnership shall use all reasonable efforts to
include such number or amount of securities held by the Holder in such
registration statement as the Holder shall request. If the proposed offering
pursuant to this Section 7.12(b) shall be an underwritten offering, then, in
the event that the managing underwriter or managing underwriters of such
offering advise the Partnership and the Holder in writing that in their
opinion the inclusion of all or some of the Holders Partnership Securities
would adversely and materially affect the success of the offering, the
Partnership shall include in such offering only that number or amount, if
any, of securities held by



 

B-40  the Holder which, in the opinion of the managing underwriter or managing
underwriters, will not so adversely and materially affect the offering. Except
as set forth in Section 7.12(c), all costs and expenses of any such
registration and offering (other than the underwriting discounts and
commissions) shall be paid by the Partnership, without reimbursement by the
Holder.

 

(c) If underwriters are engaged in connection with any registration referred
to in this Section 7.12, the Partnership shall provide indemnification,
representations, covenants, opinions and other assurance to the underwriters
in form and substance reasonably satisfactory to such underwriters. Further,
in addition to and not in limitation of the Partnerships obligation under
Section 7.7, the Partnership shall, to the fullest extent, permitted by law,
indemnify and hold harmless the Holder, its officers, directors and each
Person who controls the Holder (within the meaning of the Securities Act) and
any agent thereof (collectively, " _Indemnified Persons_ ") against any
losses, claims, demands, actions, causes of action, assessments, damages,
liabilities (joint or several), costs and expenses (including interest,
penalties and reasonable attorneys fees and disbursements), resulting to,
imposed upon, or incurred by the Indemnified Persons, directly or indirectly,
under the Securities Act or otherwise (hereinafter referred to in this Section
7.12(c) as a " _claim_ " and in the plural as " _claims_ ") based upon,
arising out of or resulting from any untrue statement or alleged untrue
statement of any material fact contained in any registration statement under
which any Partnership Securities were registered under the Securities Act or
any state securities or Blue Sky laws, in any preliminary prospectus (if used
prior to the effective date of such registration statement), or in any summary
or final prospectus or in any amendment or supplement thereto (if used during
the period the Partnership is required to keep the registration statement
current), or arising out of, based upon or resulting from the omission or
alleged omission to state therein a material fact required to be stated
therein or necessary to make the statements made therein not misleading;
_provided, however_ , that the Partnership shall not be liable to any
Indemnified Person to the extent that any such claim arises out of, is
based upon or results from an untrue statement or alleged untrue statement or
omission or alleged omission made in such registration statement, such
preliminary, summary or final prospectus or such amendment or supplement, in
reliance upon and in conformity with written information furnished to the
Partnership by or on behalf of such Indemnified Person specifically for use in
the preparation thereof.

 

(d) The provisions of Sections 7.12(a) and 7.12(b) shall continue to be
applicable with respect to the Managing General Partner (and any of the
Managing General Partners Affiliates) after they cease to be Partners of the
Partnership, during a period of two years subsequent to the effective date of
such cessation and for so long thereafter as is required for the Holder to
sell all of the Partnership Securities with respect to which it has requested
during such two-year period inclusion in a registration statement otherwise
filed or that a registration statement be filed; _provided, however_ , that
the Partnership shall not be required to file successive registration
statements covering the same Partnership Securities for which registration was
demanded during such two-year period. The provisions of Section 7.12(c) shall
continue in effect thereafter. 

(e) Any request to register Partnership Securities pursuant to this Section
7.12 shall (i) specify the Partnership Securities intended to be offered and
sold by the Person making the request, (ii) express such Persons present
intent to offer such shares for distribution, (iii) describe the nature or
method of the proposed offer and sale of Partnership Securities, and (iv)
contain the undertaking of such Person to provide all such information and
materials and take all action as may be required in order to permit the
Partnership to comply with all applicable requirements in connection with the
registration of such Partnership Securities.

Section 7.13 _Reliance by Third Parties_

 

Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement, any Person dealing
with the Partnership shall be entitled to assume that the Managing General
Partner and any officer of the Managing General Partner authorized by the
Managing General Partner to act on behalf of and in the name of the
Partnership has full power and authority to encumber, sell or otherwise use in
any manner any and all assets of the Partnership and to enter into any
authorized contracts on behalf of the Partnership, and such Person shall be
entitled to deal with the Managing General Partner or any such officer as if
it were the Partnerships sole party in interest, both legally and
beneficially. Each Limited Partner hereby waives any and all defenses or other
remedies that may be available against such Person to contest, negate or
disaffirm any action of the Managing General Partner or any 



 

B-41  such officer in connection with any such dealing. In no event shall any
Person dealing with the Managing General Partner or any such officer or its
representatives be obligated to ascertain that the terms of the Agreement
have been complied with or to inquire into the necessity or expedience of any
act or action of the Managing General Partner or any such officer or its
representatives. Each and every certificate, document or other instrument
executed on behalf of the Partnership by the Managing General Partner or its
representatives shall be conclusive evidence in favor of any and every Person
relying thereon or claiming thereunder that (a) at the time of the
execution and delivery of such certificate, document or instrument, this
Agreement was in full force and effect, (b) the Person executing and
delivering such certificate, document or instrument was duly authorized and
empowered to do so for and on behalf of the Partnership and (c) such
certificate, document or instrument was duly executed and delivered in
accordance with the terms and provisions of this Agreement and is binding upon
the Partnership.

Partner Interest will be deemed to be the lowest quoted closing price of the

actual price paid by such transferee.

that the Partnership is required or elects to withhold and pay over to any
taxing authority any amount resulting from the allocation or distribution of
income to any Partner or Assignee (including, without limitation, by reason
of Section 1446 of the Code), the amount withheld may at the discretion of the

By transfer of a Limited Partner Interest in accordance with Article IV, the
transferor shall be deemed to have given the transferee the right to seek
admission as a Substituted Limited Partner subject to the conditions of, and

authority to convey to a purchaser or other transferee who does not execute
and deliver a Transfer Application (a) the right to negotiate such Certificate
to a purchaser or other transferee and (b) the right to transfer the right to
request admission as a Substituted Limited Partner to such purchaser or other
transferee in respect of the transferred Limited Partner Interests. Each
transferee of a Limited Partner Interest (including any nominee holder or an
agent acquiring such Limited Partner Interest for the account of another
Person) who executes and delivers a Transfer Application shall, by virtue of
such execution and delivery, be an Assignee and be deemed to have applied to
become a Substituted Limited Partner with respect to the Limited Partner
Interests so transferred to such Person. Such Assignee shall become a
Substituted Limited Partner (x) at such time as the Managing General Partner
consents thereto, which consent may be given or withheld in the
Managing General Partners discretion, and (y) when any such admission is
shown on the books and records of the Partnership. If such consent is
withheld, such transferee shall be an Assignee. An Assignee shall have an
interest in the Partnership equivalent to that of a Limited Partner with
respect to allocations and distributions, including liquidating distributions,
of the Partnership. With respect to voting rights attributable to Limited
Partner Interests that are held by Assignees, the Managing General Partner
shall be deemed to be the Limited Partner with respect thereto and shall, in
exercising the voting rights in respect of such Limited Partner Interests on
any matter, vote such Limited Partner Interests at the written direction of
the Assignee who is the Record Holder of such Limited Partner Interests. If no
such written direction is received, such Limited Partner Interests will not be
voted. An Assignee shall have no other rights of a Limited Partner. 

Section 10.2 _Admission of Successor General Partners_

 

A successor General Partner approved pursuant to Sections 11.1 or 11.2 or the
transferee of or successor to such General Partner Interest pursuant to
Section 4.6 who is proposed to be admitted as a successor General Partner
shall be admitted to the Partnership as the Managing General Partner,
effective immediately prior to the withdrawal or removal of the predecessor
or transferring General Partner pursuant to Sections 11.1 or 11.2, or the
transfer of such General Partners General Partner Interest pursuant to
Section 4.6; provided, however, that no such successor shall be admitted to
the Partnership until compliance with the terms of Section 4.6 has occurred
and such successor has executed and delivered such other documents or
instruments as may be required to effect such admission. Any such successor
shall, subject to the terms hereof, carry on the business of the members of
the Partnership Group without dissolution.

Section 10.3 _Admission of Additional Limited Partners_

(a) A Person (other than the General Partners or a Substituted Limited
Partner) who makes a Capital Contribution to the Partnership in accordance
with this Agreement shall be admitted to the Partnership as an Additional
Limited Partner only upon furnishing to the Managing General Partner (i)
evidence of acceptance in form satisfactory to the Managing General Partner
of all of the terms and conditions of this Agreement, including the power of
attorney granted in Section 2.6, and (ii) such other documents or instruments
as may be required in the discretion of the Managing General Partner to
effect such Persons admission as an Additional Limited Partner.

(b) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Section 10.3, no Person
shall be admitted as an Additional Limited Partner without the consent of the
Managing General Partner, which consent may be given or withheld in the
Managing General Partners discretion. The admission of any Person as an
Additional Limited



 

B-44  Partner shall become effective on the date upon which the name of such
Person is recorded as such in the books and records of the Partnership,
following the consent of the Managing General Partner to such admission.

Section 10.4 _Amendment of Agreement and Certificate of Limited Partnership_

 

To effect the admission to the Partnership of any Partner, the Managing
General Partner shall take all steps necessary and appropriate under the
Delaware Act to amend the records of the Partnership to reflect such admission
and, if necessary, to prepare as soon as practicable an amendment to this
Agreement and, if required by law, the Managing General Partner shall prepare
and file an amendment to the Certificate of Limited Partnership, and the
Managing General Partner may for this purpose, among others, exercise the
power of attorney granted pursuant to Section 2.6.

(v) A final and non-appealable order of relief under Chapter 7 of the United
States Bankruptcy Code is entered by a court with appropriate jurisdiction

termination of the Managing General Partner.

If an Event of Withdrawal specified in Sections 11.1(a)(iv), 11.1(a)(v)
or 11.1(a)(vi)(A), 11.1(a)(vi)(B), 11.1(a)(vi)(C) or 11.1(a)(vi)(E) occurs,
the withdrawing Managing General Partner shall give notice to the Limited
Partners within 30 days after such occurrence. The Partners hereby agree that
only the Events of Withdrawal described in this Section 11.1 shall result in
the withdrawal of the Managing General Partner from the Partnership.



 

B-45 (b) Withdrawal of the Managing General Partner from the Partnership upon the
occurrence of an Event of Withdrawal shall not constitute a breach of this
Agreement under the following circumstances: (i) at any time during the period
beginning on the Closing Date and ending at 12:00 midnight, Eastern Standard
Time, on June 30, 2011, the Managing General Partner voluntarily withdraws by
giving at least 90 days advance notice of its intention to withdraw to the
Limited Partners; provided that prior to the effective date of such
withdrawal, the withdrawal is approved by Unitholders holding at least a
majority of the Outstanding Common Units (excluding Common Units held by the
Managing General Partner and its Affiliates) and the Managing General Partner
delivers to the Partnership an Opinion of Counsel (" _Withdrawal Opinion of
Counsel_ ") that such withdrawal (following the selection of the successor
Managing General Partner) would not result in the loss of the limited
liability of any Limited Partner or of a member of the Operating Company or
cause the Partnership or the Operating Company to be treated as an association
taxable as a corporation or otherwise to be taxed as an entity for federal
income tax purposes (to the extent not previously treated as such); (ii) at
any time after 12:00 midnight, Eastern Standard Time, on June 30, 2011, the

advance notice to the Unitholders, such withdrawal to take effect on the date
specified in such notice; (iii) at any time that the Managing General Partner
ceases to be the Managing General Partner pursuant to Section 11.1(a)(ii) or
is removed pursuant to Section 11.2; or (iv) notwithstanding clause (i)
of this sentence, at any time that the Managing General Partner voluntarily
withdraws by giving at least 90 days advance notice of its intention to
withdraw to the Limited Partners, such withdrawal to take effect on the date
specified in the notice, if at the time such notice is given one Person and
its Affiliates (other than the Managing General Partner and their Affiliates)
own beneficially or of record or control at least 50% of the Outstanding
Units. The withdrawal of the Managing General Partner from the Partnership
upon the occurrence of an Event of Withdrawal shall also constitute the
withdrawal of the Managing General Partner as general partner or managing
member, to the extent applicable, of the other Group Members. If the Managing
General Partner gives a notice of withdrawal pursuant to Section 11.1(a)(i),
the holders of a Unit Majority, may, prior to the effective date of such
withdrawal, elect a successor Managing General Partner. The Person so elected
as successor Managing General Partner shall automatically become the
successor general partner or managing member, to the extent applicable, of the
other Group Members of which the Managing General Partner is a general partner
or a managing member. If, prior to the effective date of the Managing General
Partners withdrawal pursuant to Section 11.1(a)(i), a successor is not
selected by the Unitholders as provided herein or the Partnership does not
receive a Withdrawal Opinion of Counsel, the Partnership shall be dissolved
in accordance with Section 12.1. Any successor Managing General Partner
elected in accordance with the terms of this Section 11.1 shall be subject to
the provisions of Section 10.2.

 

Section 11.2 _Removal of the Managing General Partner_

 

The Managing General Partner may be removed if such removal is approved by the
Unitholders holding at least 66 2/3% of the Outstanding Units (including
Units held by the Managing General Partner and its Affiliates). Any such
action by such holders for removal of the Managing General Partner must also
provide for the election of a successor Managing General Partner by the
Unitholders holding a Unit Majority (including Units held by the Managing
General Partners and its Affiliates). Such removal shall be effective
immediately following the admission of a successor Managing General Partner
pursuant to Section 10.2. The removal of the Managing General Partner shall
also automatically constitute the removal of the Managing General Partner as
general partner or managing member, to the extent applicable, of the other
Group Members of which the Managing General Partner is a general partner or a
managing member. If a Person is elected as a successor Managing General
Partner in accordance with the terms of this Section 11.2, such Person shall,
upon admission pursuant to Section 10.2, automatically become a
successor general partner or managing member, to the extent applicable, of
the other Group Members of which the Managing General Partner is a general
partner or a managing member. The right of the holders of Outstanding Units to
remove the Managing General Partner shall not exist or be exercised unless
the Partnership has received an opinion opining as to the matters covered by a
Withdrawal Opinion of Counsel. Any successor Managing General Partner elected
in accordance with the terms of this Section 11.2 shall be subject to the
provisions of Section 10.2.



 

B-46 Section 11.3 _Interest of Departing Partner and Successor General Partners_

 

(a) In the event of (i) withdrawal of a General Partner under circumstances
where such withdrawal does not violate this Agreement or (ii) removal of a
the Managing General Partner by the holders of Outstanding Units under
circumstances where Cause does not exist, if a successor General Partner is
elected in accordance with the terms of Sections 11.1 or 11.2, the
Departing Partner shall have the option exercisable prior to the effective
date of the departure of such Departing Partner to require its successor to
purchase its general partner interest (or equivalent interest), if any, in the
other Group Members (the " _Combined Interest_ ") in exchange for an amount
in cash equal to the fair market value of such Combined Interest, such amount
to be determined and payable as of the effective date of its departure. If the
Managing General Partner is removed by the Unitholders under circumstances
where Cause exists or if the Managing General Partner withdraws under
circumstances where such withdrawal violates this Agreement, and if a
successor Managing General Partner is elected in accordance with the terms of
Sections 11.1 or 11.2, such successor shall have the option, exercisable prior
to the effective date of the departure of such Departing Partner, to purchase
the Combined Interest of the Departing Partner for such fair market value of
such Combined Interest of the Departing Partner. In either event, the
Departing Partner shall be entitled to receive all reimbursements due such
Departing Partner pursuant to Section 7.4, including any employee-related
liabilities (including severance liabilities), incurred in connection with
the termination of any employees employed by the Managing General Partner for
the benefit of the Partnership or the other Group Members.

 

For purposes of this Section 11.3(a), the fair market value of a Departing
Partners Combined Interest shall be determined by agreement between the
Departing Partner and its successor or, failing agreement within 30 days after
the effective date of such Departing Partners departure, by an independent
investment banking firm or other independent expert selected by the Departing
Partner and its successor, which, in turn, may rely on other experts, and the
determination of which shall be conclusive as to such matter. If such parties
cannot agree upon one independent investment banking firm or other
independent expert within 45 days after the effective date of such departure,
then the Departing Partner shall designate an independent investment banking
firm or other independent expert, the Departing Partners successor shall
designate an independent investment banking firm or other independent expert,
and such firms or experts shall mutually select a third independent investment
banking firm or independent expert, which third independent investment banking
firm or other independent expert shall determine the fair market value of the
Combined Interest of the Departing Partner. In making its determination, such
third independent investment banking firm or other independent expert may
consider the then current trading price of Units on any National Securities
Exchange on which Units are then listed, the value of the Partnerships
assets, the rights and obligations of the Departing Partner and other factors
it may deem relevant.

 

(b) If the Combined Interest is not purchased in the manner set forth in
Section 11.3(a), the Departing Partner (or its transferee) shall become a
Limited Partner and its Combined Interest shall be converted into Common Units
pursuant to a valuation made by an investment banking firm or other
independent expert selected pursuant to Section 11.3(a), without reduction in
such Partnership Interest (but subject to proportionate dilution by reason of
the admission of its successor). Any successor General Partner shall indemnify
the Departing Partner (or its transferee) as to all debts and liabilities of
the Partnership arising on or after the date on which the Departing Partner
(or its transferee) becomes a Limited Partner. For purposes of this Agreement,
conversion of the Combined Interest of the Departing Partner to Common Units
will be characterized as if such General Partner (or its transferee)
contributed its Combined Interest to the Partnership in exchange for the newly
issued Common Units.

 

Section 11.4 _Withdrawal of Limited Partners_

 

No Limited Partner shall have any right to withdraw from the Partnership;
provided, however, that when a transferee of a Limited Partners Limited
Partner Interest becomes a Record Holder of the Limited Partner Interest so
transferred, such transferring Limited Partner shall cease to be a Limited
Partner with respect to the Limited Partner Interest so transferred. 



 

B-47 ARTICLE XII

 

DISSOLUTION AND LIQUIDATION

 

Section 12.1 _Dissolution_

 

The Partnership shall not be dissolved by the admission of Substituted Limited
Partners or Additional Limited Partners or by the admission of a successor
Managing General Partner in accordance with the terms of this Agreement. Upon
the removal or withdrawal of the Managing General Partner, if a successor
Managing General Partner is elected pursuant to Sections 11.1 or 11.2,
the Partnership shall not be dissolved and such successor Managing General
Partner shall continue the business of the Partnership. The Partnership shall
dissolve, and (subject to Section 12.2) its affairs shall be wound up, upon:

 

(a) an Event of Withdrawal of the Managing General Partner as provided in
Section 11.1(a) (other than Section 11.1(a)(ii)), unless a successor is
elected and an Opinion of Counsel is received as provided in Sections 11.1(b)
or 11.2 and such successor is admitted to the Partnership pursuant to Section
10.2;

 

(b) an election to dissolve the Partnership by the Managing General Partner
that is approved by the holders of a Unit Majority; 

(c) the entry of a decree of judicial dissolution of the Partnership pursuant
to the provisions of the Delaware Act; or 

(d) the sale of all or substantially all of the assets and properties of the
Partnership Group.

 

Section 12.2 _Continuation of the Business of the Partnership After
Dissolution_

 

Upon (a) dissolution of the Partnership following an Event of Withdrawal
caused by the withdrawal or removal of the Managing General Partner as
provided in Sections 11.1(a)(i) or 11.1(a)(iii) and the failure of the
Partners to select a successor to such Departing Partner pursuant to Sections
11.1 or 11.2, then within 90 days thereafter, or (b) dissolution of the
Partnership upon an event constituting an Event of Withdrawal as defined in
Sections 11.1(a)(iv), 11.1(a)(v) or 11.1(a)(vi), then, to the maximum extent
permitted by law, within 180 days thereafter, the holders of a Unit Majority
may elect to reconstitute the Partnership and continue its business on the
same terms and conditions set forth in this Agreement by forming a new limited
partnership on terms identical to those set forth in this Agreement and having
as the successor managing general partner a Person approved by the holders of
a Unit Majority. Unless such an election is made within the applicable time
period as set forth above, the Partnership shall conduct only activities
necessary to wind up its affairs. If such an election is so made, then:

(i) the reconstituted Partnership shall continue unless earlier dissolved in
accordance with this 

Article XII;

 

(ii) if the successor Managing General Partner is not the former Managing
General Partner, then the interest of the former Managing General Partner
shall be treated in the manner provided in Section 11.3; and

(iii) all necessary steps shall be taken to cancel this Agreement and the
Certificate of Limited Partnership and to enter into and, as necessary, to
file a new partnership agreement and certificate of limited partnership, and
the successor managing general partner may for this purpose exercise the
powers of attorney granted the Managing General Partner pursuant to Section
2.6; provided, that the right of the holders of a Unit Majority to approve a
successor Managing General Partner and to reconstitute and to continue the
business of the Partnership shall not exist and may not be exercised unless
the Partnership has received an Opinion of Counsel that (x) the exercise of
the right would not result in the loss of limited liability of any
Limited Partner and (y) neither the Partnership, the reconstituted limited
partnership nor the Operating Company would be treated as an association
taxable as a corporation or otherwise be taxable as an entity for federal
income tax purposes upon the exercise of such right to continue.



 

B-48 Section 12.3 _Liquidator_

 

Upon dissolution of the Partnership, unless the Partnership is continued under
an election to reconstitute and continue the Partnership pursuant to Section
12.2, the Managing General Partner shall select one or more Persons to act as
Liquidator. The Liquidator (if other than the Managing General Partner) shall
be entitled to receive such compensation for its services as may be approved
by holders of at least a majority of the Outstanding Common Units. The
Liquidator (if other than the Managing General Partner) shall agree not to
resign at any time without 15 days prior notice and may be removed at any
time, with or without cause, by notice of removal approved by holders of at
least a majority of the Outstanding Common Units. Upon dissolution, removal or
resignation of the Liquidator, a successor and substitute Liquidator (who
shall have and succeed to all rights, powers and duties of the original
Liquidator) shall within 30 days thereafter be approved by holders of at least
a majority of the Outstanding Common. The right to approve a successor or
substitute Liquidator in the manner provided herein shall be deemed to refer
also to any such successor or substitute Liquidator approved in the manner
herein provided. Except as expressly provided in this Article XII, the
Liquidator approved in the manner provided herein shall have and may
exercise, without further authorization or consent of any of the parties
hereto, all of the powers conferred upon the Managing General Partner under
the terms of this Agreement (but subject to all of the applicable limitations,
contractual and otherwise, upon the exercise of such powers, other than the
limitation on sale set forth in Section 7.3(b)) to the extent necessary or
desirable in the good faith judgment of the Liquidator to carry out the duties
and functions of the Liquidator hereunder for and during such period of time
as shall be reasonably required in the good faith judgment of the Liquidator
to complete the winding up and liquidation of the Partnership as provided for
herein.

 

Section 12.4 _Liquidation_

 

The Liquidator shall proceed to dispose of the assets of the Partnership,
discharge its liabilities, and otherwise wind up its affairs in such manner
and over such period as the Liquidator determines to be in the best interest
of the Partners, subject to Section 17-804 of the Delaware Act and the
following:

 

(a) _Disposition of Assets_. The assets may be disposed of by public or
private sale or by distribution in kind to one or more Partners on such terms
as the Liquidator and such Partner or Partners may agree. If any property is
distributed in kind, the Partner receiving the property shall be deemed for
purposes of Section 12.4(c) to have received cash equal to its fair market
value; and contemporaneously therewith, appropriate cash distributions must be
made to the other Partners. The Liquidator may, in its absolute discretion,
defer liquidation or distribution of the Partnerships assets for a
reasonable time if it determines that an immediate sale or distribution of
all or some of the Partnerships assets would be impractical or would cause
undue loss to the Partners. The Liquidator may, in its absolute discretion,
distribute the Partnerships assets, in whole or in part, in kind if it
determines that a sale would be impractical or would cause undue loss to the
Partners.

 

(b) _Discharge of Liabilities_. Liabilities of the Partnership include amounts
owed to the Liquidator as compensation for serving in such capacity (subject
to the terms of Section 12.3) and amounts to Partners otherwise than in
respect of their distribution rights under Article VI. With respect to any
liability that is contingent, conditional or unmatured or is otherwise
not yet due and payable, the Liquidator shall either settle such claim for
such amount as it thinks appropriate or establish a reserve of cash or other
assets to provide for its payment. When paid, any unused portion of the
reserve shall be distributed as additional liquidation proceeds.

(c) _Liquidation Distributions_. All property and all cash in excess of
that required to discharge liabilities as provided in Section 12.4(b) shall
be distributed to the Partners in accordance with, and to the extent of, the
positive balances in their respective Capital Accounts, as determined after
taking into account all Capital Account adjustments (other than those made by
reason of distributions pursuant to this Section 12.4(c)) for the taxable year
of the Partnership during which the liquidation of the Partnership occurs
(with such date of occurrence being determined pursuant to Treasury
Regulation Section 1.704-1(b)(2)(ii)(g)), and such distribution shall be made
by the end of such taxable year (or, if later, within 90 days after said date
of such occurrence).

 



 

B-49 Section 12.5 _Cancellation of Certificate of Limited Partnership_

 

Upon the completion of the distribution of Partnership cash and property as
provided in Section 12.4 in connection with the liquidation of the
Partnership, the Partnership shall be terminated and the Certificate of
Limited Partnership and all qualifications of the Partnership as a foreign
limited partnership in jurisdictions other than the State of Delaware shall
be canceled and such other actions as may be necessary to terminate the
Partnership shall be taken.

Section 12.6 _Return of Contributions_

The Managing General Partner shall not be personally liable for, and shall
have no obligation to contribute or loan any monies or property to the
Partnership to enable it to effectuate, the return of the Capital
Contributions of the Limited Partners or Unitholders, or any portion thereof,
it being expressly understood that any such return shall be made solely from
Partnership assets.

Section 12.7 _Waiver of Partition_

 

To the maximum extent permitted by law, each Partner hereby waives any right
to partition of the Partnership property.

 

Section 12.8 _Capital Account Restoration_

 

No Limited Partner shall have any obligation to restore any negative balance
in its Capital Account upon liquidation of the Partnership.

the Partnership and the Operating Company will not be treated as an
association taxable as a corporation or otherwise taxed as an entity for
federal income tax purposes;

 

(d) a change that, in the discretion of the Managing General Partner, (i) does
not adversely affect the Limited Partners (including any particular class of

in any material respect, (ii) is necessary or advisable to (A) satisfy any
requirements, conditions or guidelines contained in any opinion, directive,
order, ruling or regulation of any federal or state agency or judicial
authority or contained in any federal or state statute (including the Delaware
Act) or (B) facilitate the trading of the Limited Partner

1940, as amended, or "plan asset" regulations adopted under the Employee
Retirement Income Security Act of 1974, as amended, regardless of whether such

(a) Notwithstanding the provisions of Sections 13.1 and 13.2, no provision of
this Agreement that establishes a percentage of Outstanding Units (including
Units deemed owned by the Managing General Partner) required to take any

(d) Notwithstanding any other provision of this Agreement, except for
amendments pursuant to Section 13.1 and except as otherwise provided by
Section 14.3(b), no amendments shall become effective without the approval of
the holders of at least 90% of the Outstanding Units voting as a single class
unless the Partnership obtains an Opinion of Counsel to the effect that
such amendment will not affect the limited liability of any Limited Partner
under applicable law.

(e) Except as provided in Section 13.1, this Section 13.3 shall only be
amended with the approval of the holders of at least 90% of the Outstanding
Units.

 

Section 13.4 _Special Meetings_

 

All acts of Limited Partners to be taken pursuant to this Agreement shall be
taken in the manner provided in this Article XIII. Special meetings of the
Limited Partners may be called by the Managing General Partner or by Limited
Partners owning 20% or more of the Outstanding Partnership Securities of the
class or classes for which a meeting is proposed. Limited Partners shall call
a special meeting by delivering to the Managing General Partner one or more
requests in writing stating that the signing Limited Partners wish to call a
special meeting and indicating the general or specific purposes for which the
special meeting is to be called. Within 60 days after receipt of such a call
from Limited Partners or within such greater time as may be reasonably
necessary for the Partnership to comply with any statutes, rules, regulations,
listing, agreements or similar requirements governing the holding of a
meeting or the solicitation of proxies for use at such a meeting, the Managing
General Partner shall send a notice of the meeting to the Limited Partners
either directly or indirectly through the Transfer Agent. A meeting shall be
held at a time and place determined by the Managing General Partner on a date
not less than 10 days nor more than 60 days after the mailing of notice of the
meeting. Limited Partners shall not vote on matters that would cause the
Limited Partners to be deemed to be taking part in the management and control
of the business and affairs of the Partnership so as to jeopardize the Limited
Partners limited liability under the Delaware Act or the law of any
other state in which the Partnership is qualified to do business.



 

B-52 Section 13.5 _Notice of a Meeting_

 

Notice of a meeting called pursuant to Section 13.4 shall be given to the
Record Holders of the class or classes of Limited Partner Interests for which
a meeting is proposed in writing by mail or other means of written
communication in accordance with Section 16.1. The notice shall be deemed to
have been given at the time when deposited in the mail or sent by other means
of written communication.

Section 13.6 _Record Date_

 

For purposes of determining the Limited Partners entitled to notice of or to
vote at a meeting of the Limited Partners or to give approvals without a
meeting as provided in Section 13.11 the Managing General Partner may set a
Record Date, which shall not be less than 10 nor more than 60 days before (a)
the date of the meeting (unless such requirement conflicts with any rule,
regulation, guideline or requirement of any National Securities Exchange on
which the Limited Partner Interests are listed for trading, in which case the
rule, regulation, guideline or requirement of such exchange shall govern)
or (b) in the event that approvals are sought without a meeting, the date by
which Limited Partners are requested in writing by the Managing General
Partner to give such approvals.

 

Section 13.7 _Adjournment_

 

When a meeting is adjourned to another time or place, notice need not be given
of the adjourned meeting and a new Record Date need not be fixed, if the time
and place thereof are announced at the meeting at which the adjournment is
taken, unless such adjournment shall be for more than 45 days. At the
adjourned meeting, the Partnership may transact any business which might have
been transacted at the original meeting. If the adjournment is for more than
45 days or if a new Record Date is fixed for the adjourned meeting, a notice
of the adjourned meeting shall be given in accordance with this Article XIII.

 

Section 13.8 _Waiver of Notice; Approval of Meeting; Approval of Minutes_

 

The transactions of any meeting of Limited Partners, however called and
noticed, and whenever held, shall be as valid as if it had occurred at a
meeting duly held after regular call and notice, if a quorum is present,
either in person or by proxy, and if, either before or after the meeting,
Limited Partners representing such quorum who were present in person or by
proxy and entitled to vote, sign a written waiver of notice or an approval of
the holding of the meeting or an approval of the minutes thereof. All waivers
and approvals shall be filed with the Partnership records or made a part of
the minutes of the meeting. Attendance of a Limited Partner at a meeting
shall constitute a waiver of notice of the meeting, except when the Limited
Partner does not approve, at the beginning of the meeting, of the transaction
of any business because the meeting is not lawfully called or convened; and
except that attendance at a meeting is not a waiver of any right to disapprove
the consideration of matters required to be included in the notice of the
meeting, but not so included, if the disapproval is expressly made at the
meeting

Section 13.9 _Quorum_

 

The holders of a majority of the Outstanding Partnership Securities of the
class or classes for which a meeting has been called (including Limited
Partner Interests deemed owned by the Managing General Partner) represented in
person or by proxy shall constitute a quorum at a meeting of Limited Partners
of such class or classes unless any such action by the Limited Partners
requires approval by holders of a greater percentage of such Limited Partner
Interests, in which case the quorum shall be such greater percentage. At any
meeting of the Limited Partners duly called and held in accordance with this
Agreement at which a quorum is present, the act of Limited Partners holding
Outstanding Partnership Securities that in the aggregate represent a majority
of the Outstanding Partnership Securities entitled to vote and be present in
person or by proxy at such meeting shall be deemed to constitute the act of
all Limited Partners, unless a greater or different percentage is required
with respect to such action under the provisions of this Agreement, in which
case the act of the Limited Partners 



 

B-53  holding Outstanding Partnership Securities that in the aggregate represent
at least such greater or different percentage shall be required. The Limited
Partners present at a duly called or held meeting at which a quorum is
present may continue to transact business until adjournment, notwithstanding
the withdrawal of enough Limited Partners to leave less than a quorum, if any
action taken (other than adjournment) is approved by the required percentage
of Outstanding Partnership Securities specified in this Agreement (including
Outstanding Partnership Securities deemed owned by the Managing General
Partner). In the absence of a quorum any meeting of Limited Partners may be
adjourned from time to time by the affirmative vote of holders of at least a
majority of the Outstanding Partnership Securities entitled to vote at such
meeting (including Outstanding Partnership Securities deemed owned by the
Managing General Partner) represented either in person or by proxy, but no
other business may be transacted, except as provided in Section 13.7.

 

Section 13.10 _Conduct of a Meeting_

 

The Managing General Partner shall have full power and authority concerning
the manner of conducting any meeting of the Limited Partners or solicitation
of approvals in writing, including the determination of Persons entitled to
vote, the existence of a quorum, the satisfaction of the requirements of
Section 13.4, the conduct of voting, the validity and effect of any proxies
and the determination of any controversies, votes or challenges arising in
connection with or during the meeting or voting. The Managing General Partner
shall designate a Person to serve as chairman of any meeting and shall further
designate a Person to take the minutes of any meeting. All minutes shall be
kept with the records of the Partnership maintained by the Managing General
Partner. The Managing General Partner may make such other regulations
consistent with applicable law and this Agreement as it may deem advisable
concerning the conduct of any meeting of the Limited Partners or solicitation
of approvals in writing, including regulations in regard to the appointment of
proxies, the appointment and duties of inspectors of votes and approvals, the
submission and examination of proxies and other evidence of the right to vote,
and the revocation of approvals in writing.

 

Section 13.11 _Action Without a Meeting_

 

If authorized by the Managing General Partner, any action that may be taken at
a meeting of the Limited Partners may be taken without a meeting if an
approval in writing setting forth the action so taken is signed by Limited
Partners owning not less than the minimum percentage of the Outstanding
Limited Partner Interests (including Limited Partner Interests deemed owned by
the General Partner) that would be necessary to authorize or take such action
at a meeting at which all the Limited Partners were present and voted (unless
such provision conflicts with any rule, regulation, guideline or requirement
of any National Securities Exchange on which the Limited Partner Interests
are listed for trading, in which case the rule, regulation, guideline or
requirement of such exchange shall govern). Prompt notice of the taking of
action without a meeting shall be given to the Limited Partners who have not
approved in writing. The Managing General Partner may specify that any written
ballot submitted to Limited Partners for the purpose of taking any action
without a meeting shall be returned to the Partnership within the time
period, which shall be not less than 20 days, specified by the Managing
General Partner. If a ballot returned to the Partnership does not vote all of
the Limited Partner Interests held by the Limited Partners the Partnership
shall be deemed to have failed to receive a ballot for the Limited Partner
Interests that were not voted. If approval of the taking of any action by the
Limited Partners is solicited by any Person other than by or on behalf of the
Managing General Partner, the written approvals shall have no force and
effect unless and until (a) they are deposited with the Partnership in care of
the Managing General Partner, (b) approvals sufficient to take the action
proposed are dated as of a date not more than 90 days prior to the date
sufficient approvals are deposited with the Partnership and (c) an Opinion of
Counsel is delivered to the Managing General Partner to the effect that the
exercise of such right and the action proposed to be taken with respect to
any particular matter (i) will not cause the Limited Partners to be deemed to
be taking part in the management and control of the business and affairs of
the Partnership so as to jeopardize the Limited Partners limited liability,
and (ii) are otherwise permissible under the state statutes then governing the
rights, duties and liabilities of the Partnership and the Partners.

 



 

B-54 Section 13.12 _Voting and Other Rights_

 

(a) Only those Record Holders of the Limited Partner Interests on the Record
Date set pursuant to Section 13.6 (and also subject to the limitations
contained in the definition of " _Outstanding_ ") shall be entitled to notice
of, and to vote at, a meeting of Limited Partners or to act with respect to
matters as to which the holders of the Outstanding Limited Partner Interests
have the right to vote or to act. All references in this Agreement to votes
of, or other acts that may be taken by, the Outstanding Limited Partner
Interests shall be deemed to be references to the votes or acts of the Record
Holders of such Outstanding Limited Partner Interests.

(b) With respect to Limited Partner Interests that are held for a
Persons account by another Person (such as a broker, dealer, bank, trust
company or clearing corporation, or an agent of any of the foregoing), in
whose name such Limited Partner Interests are registered, such other Person
shall, in exercising the voting rights in respect of such Limited Partner
Interests on any matter, and unless the arrangement between such Persons
provides otherwise, vote such Limited Partner Interests in favor of, and at
the direction of, the Person who is the beneficial owner, and the Partnership
shall be entitled to assume it is so acting without further inquiry. The
provisions of this Section 13.12(b) (as well as all other provisions of this
Agreement) are subject to the provisions of Section 4.3.

 

ARTICLE XIV

each constituent business entity for, or into, cash, property or general or
limited partner interests, rights, securities or obligations of the Surviving

securities or rights of any constituent business entity are not to be
exchanged or converted solely for, or into, cash, property or general or
limited partner interests, rights, securities or obligations of the Surviving
Business Entity, the cash, property or general or limited partner
interests, rights, securities or obligations of any limited partnership,
corporation, trust or other entity (other than the Surviving Business Entity)
which the holders of such general or limited partner interests, securities or
rights are to receive in exchange for, or upon conversion of their general or
limited partner interests,



 

B-55  securities or rights, and (ii) in the case of securities represented by
certificates, upon the surrender of such certificates, which cash, property or

or consolidation;

(f) The effective time of the merger, which may be the date of the filing of
the certificate of merger pursuant to Section 14.4 or a later date specified
in or determinable in accordance with the Merger Agreement (provided, that if
the effective time of the merger is to be later than the date of the filing of
the certificate of merger, the effective time shall be fixed no later than
the time of the filing of the certificate of merger and stated therein); and

(g) Such other provisions with respect to the proposed merger or
consolidation as are deemed necessary or appropriate by the Managing General
Partner.

 

Section 14.3 _Approval by Limited Partners of Merger or Consolidation_

written consent, in either case in accordance with the requirements of Article
XIII. A copy or a summary of the Merger Agreement shall be included in
or enclosed with the notice of a special meeting or the written consent.

(b) Except as provided in Section 14.3(d), the Merger Agreement shall be
approved upon receiving the affirmative vote or consent of the holders of a
Unit Majority unless the Merger Agreement contains any provision that, if
contained in an amendment to this Agreement, the provisions of this Agreement
or the Delaware Act would require for its approval the vote or consent of a
greater percentage of the Outstanding Limited Partner Interests or of any
class of Limited Partners, in which case such greater percentage vote or
consent shall be required for approval of the Merger Agreement.

(c) Except as provided in Section 14.3(d), after such approval by vote

into, or convey all of the Partnerships assets to, another limited liability
entity which shall be newly formed and shall have no assets, liabilities or
operations at the time of such Merger other than those it receives from the
Partnership or other Group Member if (i) the Managing General Partner has
received an Opinion of Counsel that the merger or conveyance, as the case may
be, would not result in the loss of the limited liability of any Limited
Partner or any member in the Operating Company or cause the Partnership or the
Operating Company to be treated as an association taxable as a corporation or
otherwise to be taxed as an entity for federal income tax purposes (to the
extent not previously treated as such), (ii) the sole purpose of such merger
or conveyance is to effect a mere change in the legal form of the Partnership
into another limited liability entity and (iii) the governing instruments of
the new entity provide the Limited Partners and the Managing General Partner
with the same rights and obligations as are herein contained.

(a) At the effective time of the certificate of merger:

 

(i) all of the rights, privileges and powers of each of the business entities
that has merged or consolidated, and all property, real, personal and mixed,
and all debts due to any of those business entities and all other things and
causes of action belonging to each of those business entities, shall be vested
in the Surviving Business Entity and after the merger or consolidation shall
be the property of the Surviving Business Entity to the extent they were of

to the same extent as if the debts, liabilities and duties had been incurred
or contracted by it.

deemed to result in a transfer or assignment of assets or liabilities from
one entity to another.

(a) Notwithstanding any other provision of this Agreement, if at any time not
more than 20% of the total Limited Partner Interests of any class then
Outstanding, other than the Class A Units or Class B Units, is held by Persons
other than the Managing General Partner and its Affiliates, the Managing
General Partner shall then have the right, which right it may assign and
transfer in whole or in part to the Partnership or any Affiliate of the
Managing General Partner, exercisable in its sole discretion, to purchase all,
but not less than all, of such Limited Partner Interests of such class then
Outstanding held by Persons other than the Managing General Partner and its
Affiliates, at the greater of (x) the Current Market Price as of the date
three days prior to the date that the notice described in Section 15.1 is
mailed and (y) the highest price paid by a General Partner or any of its
Affiliates for any such Limited Partner Interest of such class purchased
during the 90-day period preceding the date that the notice described in

partner interest of such class for the 20 consecutive Trading Days (as
hereinafter defined) immediately prior to such date; (ii) " _Closing Price_ "

such sale takes place on such day, the average of the closing bid and asked
prices on such day, regular way, in either case as reported in the principal
consolidated transaction reporting system with respect to securities listed or
admitted for trading on the principal National Securities Exchange on which
such Limited Partner Interests of such class are listed or admitted to trading
or, if such Limited Partner Interests of such class are not listed or admitted
to trading on any National Securities Exchange, the last quoted price on such
day or, if not so quoted, the average of the high bid and low asked prices on
such day in the over-the-counter market, as reported by the

 



 

B-57  Nasdaq Stock Market or any other system then in use, or, if on any such day
such Limited Partner Interests of such class are not quoted by any such
organization, the average of the closing bid and asked prices on such day as
furnished by a professional market maker making a market in such Limited
Partner Interests of such class selected by the Managing General Partner, or

Interests of such class, the fair value of such Limited Partner Interests on
such day as determined reasonably and in good faith by the Managing General
Partner; and (iii) " _Trading Day_ " means a day on which the principal

banking institutions in New York City generally are open.

(b) If the Managing General Partner, any Affiliate of the Managing General
Partner or the Partnership elects to exercise the right to purchase Limited
Partner Interests granted pursuant to Section 15.1(a), the Managing General
Partner shall deliver to the Transfer Agent notice of such election to
purchase (the " _Notice of Election to Purchase_ ") and shall cause the
Transfer Agent to mail a copy of such Notice of Election to Purchase to the
Record Holders of Limited Partner Interests of such class (as of a Record
Date selected by the Managing General Partner) at least 10, but not more than
60, days prior to the Purchase Date. Such Notice of Election to Purchase shall
also be published for a period of at least three consecutive days in at least
two daily newspapers of general circulation printed in the English language
and published in the Borough of Manhattan, New York. The Notice of Election to
Purchase shall specify the Purchase Date and the price (determined in
accordance with Section 15.1(a)) at which Limited Partner Interests will be
purchased and state that the Managing General Partner, its Affiliate or the
Partnership, as the case may be, elects to purchase such Limited Partner
Interests, upon surrender of Certificates representing such Limited Partner
Interests in exchange for payment, at such office or offices of the Transfer
Agent as the Transfer Agent may specify, or as may be required by any National
Securities Exchange on which such Limited Partner Interests are listed or
admitted to trading. Any such Notice of Election to Purchase mailed to a
Record Holder of Limited Partner Interests at his address as reflected in the
records of the Transfer Agent shall be conclusively presumed to have been
given regardless of whether the owner receives such notice. On or prior to the
Purchase Date, the Managing General Partner, its Affiliate or the Partnership,
as the case may be, shall deposit with the Transfer Agent cash in an
amount sufficient to pay the aggregate purchase price of all of such Limited
Partner Interests to be purchased in accordance with this Section 15.1. If the
Notice of Election to Purchase shall have been duly given as aforesaid at
least 10 days prior to the Purchase Date, and if on or prior to the Purchase
Date the deposit described in the preceding sentence has been made for the
benefit of the holders of Limited Partner Interests subject to purchase as
provided herein, then from and after the Purchase Date, notwithstanding that
any Certificate shall not have been surrendered for purchase, all rights of
the holders of such Limited Partner Interests (including any rights pursuant
to Articles IV, V, VI and XII) shall thereupon cease, except the right to
receive the purchase price (determined in accordance with Section 15.1(a)) for
Limited Partner Interests therefor, without interest, upon surrender to the
Transfer Agent of the Certificates representing such Limited
Partner Interests, and such Limited Partner Interests shall thereupon be
deemed to be transferred to the Managing General Partner, its Affiliate or the
Partnership, as the case may be, on the record books of the Transfer Agent and
the Partnership, and the General Partner or any Affiliate of the Managing
General Partner, or the Partnership, as the case may be, shall be deemed to be
the owner of all such Limited Partner Interests from and after the Purchase
Date and shall have all rights as the owner of such Limited Partner Interests
(including all rights as owner of such Limited Partner Interests pursuant to
Articles IV, V, VI and XII).

 

(c) At any time from and after the Purchase Date, a holder of an Outstanding
Limited Partner Interest subject to purchase as provided in this Section 15.1
may surrender his Certificate evidencing such Limited Partner Interest to the
Transfer Agent in exchange for payment of the amount described in Section
15.1(a), therefor, without interest thereon.

notice, payment or report to be given or made to a Partner or Assignee
hereunder shall be deemed conclusively to have been given or made, and the
obligation to give such notice or report or to make such payment shall be
deemed conclusively to have been fully satisfied, upon sending of such

any assignment or otherwise. An affidavit or certificate of making of any
notice, payment or report in accordance with the provisions of this Section
16.1 executed by the Managing General Partner, the Transfer Agent or the

a Record Holder at the address of such Record Holder appearing on the books
and records of the Transfer Agent or the Partnership is returned by the United
States Postal Service marked to indicate that the United States Postal Service
is unable to deliver it, such notice, payment or report and any subsequent
notices, payments and reports shall be deemed to have been duly given or made
without further mailing (until such time as such Record Holder or another
Person notifies the Transfer Agent or the Partnership of a change in his
address) if they are available for the Partner or Assignee at the principal
office of the Partnership for a period of one year from the date of the giving
or making of such notice, payment or report to the other Partners and
Assignees. Any notice to the Partnership shall be deemed given if received by
the Managing General Partner at the principal office of the Partnership
designated pursuant to Section 2.3. The Managing General Partner may rely
and shall be protected in relying on any notice or other document from a
Partner, Assignee or other Person if believed by it to be genuine.

Section 16.5 _Creditors_

 

None of the provisions of this Agreement shall be for the benefit of, or shall
be enforceable by, any creditor of the Partnership. 

Section 16.6 _Waiver_

 

No failure by any party to insist upon the strict performance of any covenant,
duty, agreement or condition of this Agreement or to exercise any right or
remedy consequent upon a breach thereof shall constitute waiver of any such
breach of any other covenant, duty, agreement or condition.



 

B-59 Section 16.7 _Counterparts_

 

This Agreement may be executed in counterparts, all of which together shall
constitute an agreement binding on all the parties hereto, notwithstanding
that all such parties are not signatories to the original or the same

upon accepting the certificate evidencing such Unit or executing and
delivering a Transfer Application as herein described, independently of the
signature of any other party.

This Agreement shall be construed in accordance with and governed by the laws
of the State of Delaware, without regard to the principles of conflicts of
law.

Section 16.9 _Invalidity of Provisions_

unenforceable in any respect, the validity, legality and enforceability of
the remaining provisions contained herein shall not be affected thereby.

Section 16.10 _Consent of Partners_

Each Partner hereby expressly consents and agrees that, whenever in this
Agreement it is specified that an action may be taken upon the affirmative
vote or consent of less than all of the Partners, such action may be so taken
upon the concurrence of less than all of the Partners and each Partner shall
be bound by the results of such action.

the "Unitholders" and, individually, a "Unitholder").

WITNESSETH:

 

WHEREAS, concurrently with the execution of this Agreement, Inergy, Inergy GP
LLC, a Delaware limited liability company and the managing general partner of
Inergy ("Inergy GP"), Inergy Partners, L.L.C., a Delaware limited liability
company and the non-managing general partner of Inergy ("Inergy Partners"),

Agreement and Plan of Merger, dated as of the date hereof (as amended,
supplemented, restated or otherwise modified from time to time, the "Merger
Agreement") pursuant to which, among other things, MergerCo will, subject to
the terms and conditions set forth herein, merge with and into Holdings, with
Holdings surviving (the "Merger"), such that following the Merger, New NRGP LP
will be the sole limited partner of Holdings, and each outstanding Common Unit
will be converted into the right to receive the merger
consideration specified therein;

WHEREAS, as of the date hereof, each Unitholder is the beneficial owner, in
the aggregate, of the number of Common Units set forth opposite such
Unitholders name on Schedule I hereto (the "Existing Units"); and

 

WHEREAS, as a material inducement to Inergy entering into the Merger

NOW THEREFORE, in consideration of the foregoing and the mutual
representations, warranties, covenants and agreements herein contained, and
intending to be legally bound hereby, the parties hereto agree as follows:

ARTICLE I

 

GENERAL

 Section 1.1 _Defined Terms_. The following capitalized terms, as used in
this Agreement, shall have the meanings set forth below. Capitalized terms
used but not otherwise defined herein shall have the meanings ascribed thereto
in the Merger Agreement.

"Affiliate" has the meaning set forth in Rule 405 of the rules and regulations
under the Securities Act, unless otherwise expressly stated herein. For
purposes of this Agreement, with respect to each Unitholder or other Person,
Affiliate shall not include Holdings or any Person that is directly or
indirectly, through one or more intermediaries, controlled by Holdings. For
the avoidance of doubt, no officer or director of Holdings, Holdings GP,
Inergy, Inergy GP or any of their controlled Affiliates shall be deemed to be
an Affiliate of a Unitholder or other Person by virtue of his or her status
as a director or officer of Holdings, Holdings GP, Inergy, Inergy GP or any of
their controlled Affiliates.



 

C-1 "Beneficial Ownership" by a Person of any securities includes ownership by
any Person who, directly or indirectly, including through any contract,
arrangement, understanding, relationship or otherwise, has or shares (i)
voting power which includes the power to vote, or to direct the voting of,
such security; and/or (ii) investment power which includes the power to
dispose, or to direct the disposition, of such security. The terms
"Beneficially Own" and "Beneficially Owned" shall have a correlative meaning.

 

"Existing Units" has the meaning ascribed to that term in the recitals to this
Agreement, subject to Section 4.2. For the avoidance of doubt, Existing Units
do not include any Common Units acquired by any Unitholder after the date
hereof, including Common Units acquired pursuant to any agreement, arrangement
or understanding or upon the exercise of conversion rights, exchange rights,
warrants or options, or otherwise (irrespective of whether the right to
acquire such securities is available or exercisable as of the date hereof).

 

"Transfer" means, directly or indirectly, to sell, transfer, assign, pledge,
encumber, hypothecate or similarly dispose of (by merger (including by
conversion into securities or other consideration), by tendering into any
tender or exchange offer, by testamentary disposition, by operation of law or
otherwise), either voluntarily or involuntarily, or to enter into
any contract, option or other arrangement or understanding with respect to
the voting of or sale, transfer, assignment, pledge, encumbrance,
hypothecation or similar disposition of (by merger, by tendering into any
tender or exchange offer, by testamentary disposition, by operation of law or
otherwise).

"Unitholder Agreement" means the Unitholder Agreement, dated April 14, 2005,
among Holdings (formerly, Inergy Holdings, LLC) and certain unitholders named
therein.

ARTICLE II

VOTING

 

Section 2.1 _Agreement to Vote_ _._ Each Unitholder hereby irrevocably and
unconditionally agrees that, during the term of this Agreement, at the
Holdings Meeting and at any other meeting of the unitholders of Holdings,
however called, including any adjournment or postponement thereof, and in
connection with any written consent of the unitholders of Holdings relating
to the Merger or an Acquisition Proposal, such Unitholder shall to the fullest
extent that the Existing Units are entitled to vote thereon or consent
thereto:

 

(a) appear at each such meeting or otherwise cause its Existing Units to be
counted as present thereat for purposes of calculating a quorum; and

(b) vote (or cause to be voted), in person or by proxy, or deliver (or cause
to be delivered) a written consent covering all of the Existing Units (i) in
favor of the approval and adoption of the Merger Agreement, the approval of
the Merger and any other action required in furtherance thereof submitted for
the vote or written consent of unitholders; (ii) against any Acquisition
Proposal; and (iii) against any action, agreement or transaction that would or
would reasonably be expected to materially impede, interfere with, delay,
postpone, discourage, frustrate the purposes of or adversely affect the
Merger or the other transactions contemplated by the Merger Agreement.

Nothing in this Section 2.1 shall require any Unitholder to take any action
inconsistent with his fiduciary obligations as an officer, manager or director
of Holdings or Holdings GP.

 

Section 2.2 _No Inconsistent Agreements_. Each Unitholder hereby covenants and
agrees that, except for this Agreement, such Unitholder (a) has not entered
into, and shall not enter into at any time while this Agreement remains in
effect, any voting agreement or voting trust governing its Existing Units that
remains in effect, (b) has not granted, and shall not grant at any time while
this Agreement remains in effect, a proxy, consent or power of attorney with
respect to voting its Existing Units that remains in effect (other than a
proxy or proxies to vote its Existing Units in a manner consistent with this
Agreement) and (c) shall not knowingly take any action at any time while this
Agreement remains in effect that would make any representation or warranty of
such Unitholder contained herein untrue or incorrect in any material respect
or have the effect of preventing or disabling such Unitholder from performing
any of its obligations under this Agreement in any material respect.

  

 

C-2 Section 2.3 _Proxy_. In order to secure the obligations set forth herein,
each Unitholder hereby irrevocably appoints during the term of this Agreement
as its proxy and attorney-in-fact, as the case may be John J. Sherman and
Laura L. Ozenberger, in their respective capacities as officers of Inergy or
Inergy GP, and any individual who shall hereafter succeed to any such officer
of Inergy or Inergy GP, as the case may be, and any other Person designated in
writing by Inergy or Inergy GP (collectively, the "Grantees"), each of them
individually, with full power of substitution, to vote or execute written
consents with respect to the Existing Units in accordance with Section 2.1
and, in the discretion of the Grantees, with respect to any proposed
postponements or adjournments of any annual or special meeting of the
Unitholders of Holdings at which any of the matters described in Section
2.1(b) are to be considered; _provided_ , that any exercise of this proxy by
such Grantees shall be subject to the approval of such exercise by the
Special Committee of the Inergy GP Board. To the fullest extent permitted by
law, this proxy is coupled with an interest and shall be irrevocable, and each
Unitholder will take such further action or execute such other instruments as
may be necessary to effectuate the intent of this proxy and hereby revokes any
proxy previously granted by such Unitholder with respect to the Existing Units
to the extent that such proxy is inconsistent with the provisions of this
Agreement. Inergy may terminate this proxy with respect to any Unitholder at
any time at its sole election by written notice provided to such Unitholder.

except that each Unitholder shall be permitted to Transfer up to 10% of such
Unitholders Existing Units, the Beneficial Ownership thereof and any other
interest therein; (ii) enter into any agreement, arrangement or understanding
with any Person, or take any other action, that violates or conflicts with or
would reasonably be expected to violate or conflict with, or result in or
give rise to a violation of or conflict with, Unitholders representations,
warranties, covenants and obligations under this Agreement; or (iii) take any
action that could restrict or otherwise affect Unitholders legal power,
authority and right to comply with and perform its covenants and obligations
under this Agreement. Any Transfer in violation of this provision shall be
null and void. Notwithstanding any Transfer of Existing Units by a Unitholder
in accordance with this Section 4.1, Inergy shall issue, and such Unitholder
shall accept, the PIK Units to be distributed to him pursuant to the Merger
Agreement.

 

Section 4.2 _Distributions, etc_. In the event of a unit split, unit
distribution, or any change in the Common Units by reason of any split-up,
reverse unit split, recapitalization, combination, reclassification, exchange
of

 



 

C-4  units or the like, the term "Existing Units" shall be deemed to refer to and
include the number of Common Units set forth opposite each Unitholders name
on Schedule I hereto as well as all such unit distributions and any
securities into which or for which any or all of such units may be changed or
exchanged or which are received in such transaction.

 

Section 4.3 _Further Assurances_. From time to time, during the term of this
Agreement, at Inergys request and without further consideration, each
Unitholder shall execute and deliver such additional documents and take all
such further action as may be reasonably necessary or advisable to effect the
actions and consummate the transactions contemplated by this Agreement.

Section 4.4 _Unitholder Capacity_. Each Unitholder has entered into this
Agreement solely in its capacity as a Beneficial Owner of Existing Units.
Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this Agreement: (i) none
of the provisions of this Agreement shall be construed to prohibit, limit or
restrict any Representative of a Unitholder who is an officer of Holdings GP
or Inergy GP or a member of the Inergy GP Board or Holdings GP Board from
exercising his or her fiduciary duties to Holdings or Inergy by voting
or taking any other action whatsoever in his or her capacity as an officer or
director, including with respect to the Merger Agreement and the transactions
contemplated thereby; and (ii) no action taken by Holdings or Inergy in
respect of the Merger Agreement and the transactions contemplated thereby
shall serve as the basis of a claim that a Unitholder is in breach of its
obligations hereunder notwithstanding the fact that such Unitholders
Representative, in his or her capacity as an officer or director of Holdings
GP or Inergy GP, has provided advice or assistance to Holdings or Inergy in
connection therewith.

 

Section 4.5 _Continued Ownership of Holdings GP and General Partner Interest
in Holdings._  

(a) During the term of this Agreement, each of the Unitholders agrees, except
as otherwise permitted in Section 4.1, not to Transfer its ownership interest
in the Existing Units or Beneficial Ownership thereof or any other interest
therein, and not to cause Holdings GP not to dissolve or liquidate.

 

(b) Each of the Unitholders agrees not to take any action that would
reasonably be expected to cause Holdings GP not to transfer its general
partner interest in Holdings, or Beneficial Ownership thereof or any other
interest therein.

Agreement as a whole and not to any particular provision of this Agreement,
and Section references are to this Agreement unless otherwise
specified. Whenever the words "include," "includes" or "including" are used
in this Agreement, they shall be deemed to be followed by the words "without
limitation." The meanings given to terms defined herein shall be equally
applicable to both the singular and plural forms of such terms. The table of
contents and headings contained in this Agreement are for reference purposes
only and shall not affect in any way the meaning or interpretation of this
Agreement. This Agreement is the product of negotiation by the parties having
the assistance of counsel and other advisers. It is the intention of the
parties that this Agreement not be construed more strictly with regard to one
party than with regard to the others.

Section 5.6 _Counterparts_. This Agreement may be executed by facsimile
and in counterparts, all of which shall be considered one and the same
agreement and shall become effective when counterparts have been signed by
each of the parties and delivered to the other parties, it being understood
that all parties need not sign the same counterpart.

Section 5.7 _Entire Agreement_. This Agreement, together with the schedule
annexed hereto, and, solely to the extent of the defined terms referenced
herein and as provided in Section 4.3 hereof, the Merger Agreement embodies
the complete agreement and understanding among the parties hereto with respect
to the subject matter hereof and supersede and preempt any prior
understandings, agreements or representations by or among the parties, written
and oral, that may have related to the subject matter hereof in any way.

 

Section 5.8 _Governing Law; Consent to Jurisdiction; Waiver of Jury Trial._

 

(a) This Agreement shall be governed by, and interpreted in accordance with,
the Laws of the State of Delaware, without regard to the conflict of law
principles thereof (except to the extent that mandatory provisions of federal
or Delaware law govern). The parties agree that irreparable damage would occur
and that the parties would not have any adequate remedy at law in the event
that any of the provisions of this Agreement were not performed in accordance
with their specific terms or were otherwise breached. It is accordingly agreed
that the parties shall be entitled to an injunction or injunctions to
prevent breaches of this Agreement and to enforce specifically the terms and
provisions of this Agreement in the Court of Chancery of the State of Delaware
(and any appellate court of the State of Delaware) and the Federal courts of
the United States of America located in the State of Delaware, this being in
addition to any other remedy to which they are entitled at law or in equity.
In addition, each of the parties hereto (i) consents to submit itself to the
personal jurisdiction of the Court of Chancery of the State of Delaware (and
any appellate court of the State of Delaware) and the Federal courts of the
United States of America located in the State of Delaware in the event any
dispute arises out of this Agreement or the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement, (ii) agrees that it will not attempt to deny or defeat such
personal jurisdiction by motion or other request for

 



 

C-7  leave from any such court and (iii) agrees that it will not bring any action
relating to this Agreement or the transactions contemplated by this Agreement
in any court other than the Court of Chancery of the State of Delaware or a
Federal court of the United States of America located in the State of
Delaware. Without limiting the foregoing, each party agrees that service of
process on such party as provided in Section 5.4 shall be deemed effective
service of process on such party.

(b) EACH PARTY HERETO HEREBY WAIVES, TO THE FULLEST EXTENT PERMITTED BY
APPLICABLE LAW, ANY RIGHT IT MAY HAVE TO A TRIAL BY JURY IN RESPECT OF ANY
SUIT, ACTION OR OTHER PROCEEDING ARISING OUT OF THIS AGREEMENT OR THE
TRANSACTIONS CONTEMPLATED HEREBY. EACH PARTY HERETO (I) CERTIFIES THAT
NO REPRESENTATIVE, AGENT OR ATTORNEY OF ANY OTHER PARTY HAS REPRESENTED,
EXPRESSLY OR OTHERWISE, THAT SUCH PARTY WOULD NOT, IN THE EVENT OF ANY ACTION,
SUIT OR PROCEEDING, SEEK TO ENFORCE THE FOREGOING WAIVER AND (II) ACKNOWLEDGES
THAT IT AND THE OTHER PARTIES HERETO HAVE BEEN INDUCED TO ENTER INTO THIS
AGREEMENT, BY, AMONG OTHER THINGS, THE MUTUAL WAIVER AND CERTIFICATIONS IN
THIS SECTION 5.8.

 

Section 5.9 _Amendment; Waiver_. This Agreement may not be amended except by
an instrument in writing signed by Inergy and each Unitholder. Each party may
waive any right of such party hereunder by an instrument in writing signed by
such party and delivered to Inergy and the Unitholders.

 

Section 5.10 Remedies.

 

(a) Each party hereto acknowledges that monetary damages would not be an
adequate remedy in the event that any covenant or agreement in this Agreement
is not performed in accordance with its terms, and it is therefore agreed
that, in addition to and without limiting any other remedy or right it may
have, the non-breaching party will have the right to an injunction, temporary
restraining order or other equitable relief in any court of competent
jurisdiction enjoining any such breach and enforcing specifically the terms
and provisions hereof. Each party hereto agrees not to oppose the granting of
such relief in the event a court determines that such a breach has occurred,
and to waive any requirement for the securing or posting of any bond in
connection with such remedy.

 

(b) All rights, powers and remedies provided under this Agreement or otherwise
available in respect hereof at law or in equity shall be cumulative and not
alternative, and the exercise or beginning of the exercise of any thereof by
any party shall not preclude the simultaneous or later exercise of any other
such right, power or remedy by such party.

 

Section 5.11 _Severability_. Any term or provision of this Agreement which is
determined by a court of competent jurisdiction to be invalid or
unenforceable in any jurisdiction shall, as to that jurisdiction, be
ineffective to the extent of such invalidity or unenforceability without
rendering invalid or unenforceable the remaining terms and provisions of this
Agreement or affecting the validity or enforceability of any of the terms or
provisions of this Agreement in any other jurisdiction, and if any provision
of this Agreement is determined to be so broad as to be unenforceable,
the provision shall be interpreted to be only so broad as is enforceable, in
all cases so long as neither the economic nor legal substance of the
transactions contemplated hereby is affected in any manner adverse to any
party or its equityholders. Upon any such determination, the parties shall
negotiate in good faith in an effort to agree upon a suitable and equitable
substitute provision to effect the original intent of the parties as closely
as possible and to the end that the transactions contemplated hereby shall be
fulfilled to the maximum extent possible.

Section 5.12  _Action by Inergy._ No waiver, consent or other action by or on
behalf of Inergy pursuant to or as contemplated by this Agreement shall have
any effect unless such waiver, consent or other action is expressly approved
by the Special Committee of the Inergy GP Board.



 

C-8 Section 5.13 _Successors and Assigns; Third Party Beneficiaries._ Neither
this Agreement nor any of the rights or obligations of any party under this
Agreement shall be assigned, in whole or in part (by operation of law or
otherwise), by any party without the prior written consent of the
other parties hereto. Subject to the foregoing, this Agreement shall bind and
inure to the benefit of and be enforceable by the parties hereto and their
respective successors and permitted assigns. Nothing in this Agreement,
express or implied, is intended to confer on any Person other than (a) the
parties hereto or (b) the parties respective successors and permitted assigns
any rights, remedies, obligations or liabilities under or by reason of this
Agreement.

 

IN WITNESS WHEREOF, the parties hereto have caused this Agreement to be signed
(where applicable, by their respective officers or other authorized Person
thereunto duly authorized) as of the date first written above.

Conflicts Committee of the Board of Directors of

 

Inergy Holdings GP, LLC

Two Brush Creek Boulevard, Suite 200

Kansas City, MO 64112

 

Dear Members of the Committee:

 

You have requested our opinion as to the fairness from a financial point of
view to the holders of the common units representing limited partner
interests (the "Common Units") of Inergy Holdings, L.P. ("Holdings"), other
than the Common Units held by Inergy Holdings GP, LLC ("Holdings GP") and its
affiliates, officers and directors, of the Consideration (as defined below)
to be received by such holders, in the aggregate, pursuant to the Agreement
and Plan of Merger, dated as of August 7, 2010 (the "Agreement"), by and among
Inergy, L.P. ("Inergy"), Inergy GP, LLC ("Inergy GP"), NRGP Limited Partner,
LLC ("New NRGP LP"), Holdings, Holdings GP, and NRGP MS, LLC ("MergerCo" and,
together with Inergy, Inergy GP, Inergy Partners, New NRGP LP, Holdings and
Holding GP, the "Parties").

The Agreement provides for a series of transactions, including the merger of
MergerCo with and into Holdings, as a result of which each issued and
outstanding Common Unit will be converted into the right to receive 0.770
common units of Inergy (the "LP Units"), except that certain affiliates of
Holdings holding Common Units will receive instead a combination of LP Units,
Class A Units of Inergy and Class B Units of Inergy The transactions
contemplated by the Agreement are referred to herein as the "Transactions."
The consideration to be received by the holders of Common Units pursuant to
the Agreement shall be referred to herein collectively as the "Consideration."
In connection with the Transactions, certain affiliated unitholders of
Holdings, who collectively beneficially own approximately 57.8% of Holdings,
have agreed with Inergy to vote for the Transactions pursuant to the Holdings
Unitholder Support Agreement, dated August 7, 2010 (the "Support Agreement").
The terms and conditions of the Transactions are set forth in more detail in
the Agreement, the form of Third Amended and Restated Agreement of Limited
Partnership of Inergy (the "Inergy Amended and Restated Partnership
Agreement") attached as an annex to the Agreement, the form of Second Amended
and Restated Agreement of Limited Partnership of Holdings (the "Holdings
Amended and Restated Partnership Agreement") attached as an annex to the
Agreement and the Support Agreement, as applicable.

 

Tudor, Pickering, Holt and Co. Securities, Inc. ("TudorPickering") and its
affiliates, as part of their investment banking business, are continually
engaged in performing financial analyses with respect to businesses and their
securities in connection with mergers and acquisitions, negotiated
underwritings, competitive biddings, secondary distributions of listed and
unlisted securities, private placements and other transactions as well as for
estate, corporate and other purposes. TudorPickering also engages in
securities trading and brokerage, private equity activities, equity research
and other financial services, and in the ordinary course of these activities,
TudorPickering and its affiliates may from time to time acquire, hold or sell,
for their own accounts and for the accounts of their customers, (i) equity,
debt and other securities (or related derivative securities) and financial
instruments (including bank loans and other obligations) of Holdings, any of
the other Parties and any of their

 



 

  ![LOGO](g18664g81y10.jpg)

 



 

D-1   ![LOGO](g18664g65j53.jpg)

 



 respective affiliates and (ii) any currency or commodity that may be
involved in the Transactions and the other matters contemplated by the
Agreement. In addition, TudorPickering and its affiliates and certain of its
employees, including members of the team performing services in connection
with the Transactions, as well as certain private equity funds associated or
affiliated with TudorPickering in which they may have financial interests,
may from time to time acquire, hold or make direct or indirect investments in
or otherwise finance a wide variety of companies, including Holdings, other
prospective purchasers and their respective affiliates. We have acted as
financial advisor to the Conflicts Committee of the Board of Directors of
Holdings GP (the "Conflicts Committee") in connection with, and have
participated in certain negotiations leading to, the Transactions. We expect
to receive fees for our services, the principal portion of which is
contingent upon the consummation of the Transaction, and Holdings has agreed
to reimburse our expenses and indemnify us against certain liabilities arising
out of our engagement. Other than with respect to this Transaction,
TudorPickering has not provided investment banking services to, or otherwise
had any material relationship with, Holdings, Inergy or any of their
respective affiliates. We may provide investment banking or other financial
services to Holdings, Inergy or any of the other Parties or their respective
unitholders, affiliates or portfolio companies in the future. In connection
with such investment banking or other financial services, we may receive
compensation.

 

In connection with this opinion, we have reviewed, among other things, (i) the
Agreement; (ii) the form of Holdings Amended and Restated Partnership
Agreement; (iii) the form of Inergy Amended and Restated Partnership
Agreement; (iv) the Support Agreement; (v) annual reports to unitholders and
Annual Reports on Form 10-K of Holdings and Inergy for the two years ended
September 30, 2009; (vi) certain interim reports to unitholders and Quarterly
Reports on Form 10-Q of Holdings and Inergy; (vii) certain current reports on
Form 8-K of Holdings and Inergy; (viii) draft earnings releases and draft
Quarterly Reports on Form 10-Q of Holdings and Inergy for the quarter ended
June 30, 2010; (ix) certain other communications from Holdings and Inergy to
their respective unitholders; (x) certain internal financial information and
forecasts for Holdings and Inergy prepared by the management of Holdings, as
reviewed, adjusted and approved for our use by the Conflicts Committee (the
"Forecasts"); (xi) certain publicly available research analyst reports with
respect to the future financial performance of Holdings and Inergy, which we
discussed with the senior management of Holdings and the Conflicts Committee;
and (xii) certain cost savings and operating synergies projected by
the management of Holdings to result from the Transactions, as reviewed and
approved for our use by the Conflicts Committee (the "Synergies"). We also
have held discussions with members of the senior management of Holdings and
the Conflicts Committee regarding their assessment of the strategic rationale
for, and the potential benefits of, the Transactions and the past and current
business operations, financial condition and future prospects of Holdings,
Inergy and their respective subsidiaries. In addition, we have (i) reviewed
the reported unit price and trading activity for the Common Units and LP
Units; (ii) compared certain financial and stock market information for
Holdings and Inergy with similar information for certain other companies the
securities of which are publicly traded; (iii) compared the financial terms of
the Agreement with the financial terms of certain recent business combinations
in the midstream sector of the energy industry, including business
combinations involving master limited partnerships; and (iv) performed such
other studies and analyses, and considered such other factors, as we
considered appropriate.

D-2   ![LOGO](g18664g65j53.jpg)

 



For purposes of our opinion, we have assumed and relied upon, without
assuming any responsibility for independent verification, the accuracy and
completeness of all of the financial, accounting, legal, tax and other
information provided to, discussed with or reviewed by or for us, or publicly
available. In that regard, we have assumed with your consent that the
Forecasts and Synergies have been reasonably prepared on a basis reflecting
the best currently available estimates and judgments of the senior management
of Holdings and the Conflicts Committee, and that such Forecasts and
Synergies will be realized in the amounts and time periods contemplated
thereby. We have also assumed that all governmental, regulatory or other
consents or approvals necessary for the consummation of the Transactions will
be obtained without any material adverse effect on Holdings, any of the other
Parties, the holders of Common Units or the expected benefits of the
Transactions in any way meaningful to our analysis and have assumed that the
Transactions will be consummated on the terms described in the Agreement,
without any waiver or modification of any material terms or conditions. In
addition, we have not made an independent evaluation or appraisal of the
assets and liabilities (including any contingent, derivative or off-balance-
sheet assets and liabilities) of Holdings or any of its subsidiaries or Inergy
or any of its subsidiaries and we have not been furnished with any such
evaluation or appraisal. Our opinion does not address any legal, regulatory,
tax or accounting matters.

Our opinion does not address the underlying business decision of Holdings to
engage in the Transactions, or the relative merits of the Transactions as
compared to any other alternative transaction that might be available to
Holdings. This opinion addresses only the fairness from a financial point of
view, as of the date hereof, to the holders of Common Units (other than
Holdings GP and its affiliates, officers and directors) of the Consideration
to be paid pursuant to the Agreement. We do not express any view on, and our
opinion does not address, any other term or aspect of the Agreement, the
Holdings Amended and Restated Partnership Agreement, the Inergy Amended and
Restated Partnership Agreement, the Support Agreement or the Transactions,
including, without limitation, the fairness of the Transactions to, or any
consideration received in connection therewith by, creditors or other
constituencies of Holdings or Inergy; nor as to the fairness of the amount or
nature of any compensation to be paid or payable to any of the officers,
directors or employees of Holdings or Inergy, or any class of such persons, in
connection with the Transactions, whether relative to the Consideration
pursuant to the Agreement or otherwise. We are not expressing any opinion as
to the price at which the Common Units will trade at any time. Our opinion is
necessarily based on economic, monetary, market and other conditions as in
effect on, and the information made available to us as of, the date hereof. We
assume no obligation to update, revise or reaffirm our opinion and expressly
disclaim any responsibility to do so based on circumstances, developments or
events occurring after the date hereof. Our financial advisory services and
the opinion expressed herein are provided for the information and assistance
of the Conflicts Committee in connection with its consideration of the
Transactions and such opinion does not constitute a recommendation as to how
any holder of Common Units should vote with respect to such Transactions or
any other matter. This opinion has been reviewed and approved by
TudorPickerings fairness opinion committee.

D-3   ![LOGO](g18664g65j53.jpg)

 



Based upon and subject to the foregoing, it is our opinion that, as of the
date hereof, the Consideration to be paid to the holders of outstanding Common
Units (other than Common Units held by Holdings GP and its affiliates,
officers and directors) pursuant to the Agreement is fair from a financial
point of view to such holders.
