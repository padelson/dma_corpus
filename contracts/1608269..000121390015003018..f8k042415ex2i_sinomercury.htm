AGREEMENT AND PLAN OF REORGANIZATION

  



  

THIS AGREEMENT AND PLAN OF REORGANIZATION is made and entered into as of
April 24, 2015, by and among Sino Mercury Acquisition Corp, a Delaware
corporation (" _Sino_ "), Wins Finance Holdings Inc., a Cayman Islands
exempted company and wholly owned subsidiary of Sino (" _Holdco_ "), Wins
Finance Group Limited, a British Virgin Islands international business company
(the " _Company_ "), and each of Wits Global Limited, Appelo Limited, Glowing
Assets Holdings Limited and Cosmic Expert Limited, each of which are
British Virgin Islands international companies and shareholders of the
Company that, collectively, own 100% of the Company's outstanding capital and
voting shares (" _Company Shareholders_ ").

  



  

RECITALS

  



  

A.  Upon the terms and subject to the conditions of this Agreement
and in accordance with the Delaware General Corporation Law (the " _DGCL_ "),
the Companies Law (2012 Revision) of the Cayman Islands (the " _Companies Law_
"), the International Business Companies Act of the British Virgin Islands ("
_IBCA_ "), and other applicable law, Sino and the Company intend to enter
into a business combination transaction by means of (1) a merger of Sino with
and into Holdco, with Holdco being the surviving entity (the " _Merger_ ")
and (2) immediately following the Merger, an exchange of 100% of the ordinary
shares of the Company by the Company Shareholders for ordinary shares of
Holdco and cash (which, at the election of the Company Shareholders, may be
converted in all or part into additional ordinary shares of Holdco) as
provided herein (the " _Share Exchange_ " and, together with the Merger, the
" _Transactions_ ").

  



  

B.  The board of directors (including any committee or subgroup
thereof) of each of Sino, Holdco and the Company has determined that the
Transactions are fair to, and in the best interests of, its respective company
and shareholders.

  



  

C.  Defined terms used in this Agreement are listed alphabetically
in Article IX, together with the Section and, if applicable, paragraph number
in which the definition of each such term is located.

  



  

NOW, THEREFORE, in consideration of the covenants, promises and
representations set forth herein, and for other good and valuable
consideration, the receipt and sufficiency of which are hereby acknowledged,
the parties agree as follows:

  



  

ARTICLE I.

  

THE TRANSACTIONS

  



  

1.1   _The Merger_. At the Effective Time (as defined in Section 1.3)
and subject to and upon the terms and conditions of this Agreement and the
applicable provisions of the DGCL and the Companies Law, Sino shall be merged
with and into Holdco, the separate corporate existence of Sino shall cease
and Holdco shall continue as the surviving corporation in the Merger ("
_Surviving Pubco_ "). At the Effective Time, the Merger shall be deemed to
occur immediately prior to the Share Exchange.

1.2   _The Share Exchange_. At the Effective Time and immediately
following the consummation of the Merger, and subject to and upon the terms
and conditions of this Agreement and the applicable provisions of the
Companies Law and the IBCA, all of the outstanding ordinary shares of the
Company shall be exchanged for ordinary shares of Surviving Pubco ("
_Surviving Pubco Ordinary Shares_ ") and cash (which, at the election of the
Company Shareholders, may be converted in all or part into additional
Surviving Pubco Ordinary Shares) as provided herein, and the Company shall
become a wholly owned subsidiary of Surviving Pubco.

  



  

1.3   _Effective Time; Closing_. Subject to the terms and conditions
of this Agreement, as soon as practicable on or after the Closing Date, the
parties hereto shall cause the Transactions to be consummated by filing (a)(i)
a certificate of merger (the " _Delaware Certificate of Merger_ ") with the
Secretary of State of the State of Delaware in accordance with the applicable
provisions of the DGCL and (ii) a plan of merger (the " _Plan of Merger_ "
and, together with the Delaware Certificate of Merger, the " _Certificates of
Merger_ ") with the Cayman Islands Registrar of Companies in accordance with
the applicable provisions of the Companies Law (the time of such filing, or
such later time as may be agreed in writing by the Company and Sino and
specified in the Plan of Merger being the " _Effective Time_ "); and (b) at
the Effective Time, shall cause the consummation of the Share Exchange as
provided herein. The consummation of each of the Merger and Share Exchange is
conditioned upon the consummation of the other. Unless this Agreement shall
have been terminated pursuant to Section 8.1, the consummation of the
Transactions (the " _Closing_ "), other than the filing of the Certificates of
Merger, shall take place at the offices of Graubard Miller, counsel to Sino,
405 Lexington Avenue, New York, New York 10174, at a time and date to be
specified by the parties, which shall be no later than the third (3rd)
business day after the satisfaction or waiver of the conditions set forth in
Article VI, or at such other time, date and location as the parties hereto
agree in writing (the " _Closing Date_ "). Closing signatures may be
transmitted by facsimile or by emailed PDF file.

  



  

1.4   _Effect of the Transactions_. At the Effective Time, the effect
of the Transactions shall be as provided in this Agreement and the applicable
provisions of the DGCL, the Companies Law, the IBCA and other applicable
provisions of law (collectively, the " _Applicable Law_ "). Without limiting
the generality of the foregoing, and subject thereto, at the Effective
Time, (a) all the issued and outstanding securities of Sino shall be
automatically converted into securities of Surviving Pubco as provided in
Section 1.6, (b) all the property, rights, privileges, powers and franchises
of Sino shall vest in Surviving Pubco, and all debts, liabilities and duties
of Sino shall become the debts, liabilities and duties of Surviving Pubco and
(c) the Company shall continue its existence as a wholly owned subsidiary of
Surviving Pubco.

  



  

1.5   _Governing Documents; Officers and Directors_. At the Effective
Time, (a) the Memorandum and Articles of Association of Holdco shall be in
the form annexed hereto as _Exhibit A_ and shall become the Memorandum of
Association of Surviving Pubco, (b) the Memorandum and Articles of
Association of the Company shall be amended and restated in the form annexed
hereto as _Exhibits B_ , (c) the board of directors of each of Surviving
Pubco and the Company shall consist of the directors identified on
_Schedule 1.5_ hereto and set forth in the Proxy Statement/Prospectus (as
defined in Section 5.1), (d) the officers of Surviving Pubco immediately

1.6   _Conversion of Sino Common Stock in the Merger_.

  



  

(a)   _Conversion_. Subject to the terms and conditions of this
Agreement, the following shall occur in the Merger:

  



  

(i)  Each share of common stock, par value $0.0001 per share, of
Sino issued and outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time (which,
for the avoidance of doubt, excludes any Sino Common Stock whose holder has
elected to receive a portion of the proceeds held in Sino's Trust Fund with
respect to such Sino Common Stock as provided for in Sino's Certificate of
Incorporation) (" _Sino Common Stock_ ") will be automatically converted into
one Surviving Pubco Ordinary Share and the holders thereof shall cease to
have any further rights as holders of Sino Common Stock. Each certificate that
evidenced Sino Common Stock immediately prior to the Merger (" _Sino Common
Certificate_ ") shall entitle the holder to the applicable number of
Surviving Pubco Ordinary Shares into which the Sino Common Stock is
convertible according to this Section 1.6(a)(i); provided, however, that each
Sino Common Certificate owned by a holder that has validly elected to receive
a portion of the proceeds held in Sino's Trust Fund (as defined in Section
3.25 hereof) shall entitle the holder thereof to receive only such portion
of the Trust Account as provided for in Sino's Certificate of Incorporation.

  



  

(ii)  Each right of Sino entitling the holder to automatically
receive one-tenth (1/10) of a share of Sino Common Stock upon consummation of
the Merger issued and outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time ("
_Sino Rights_ ") will automatically be converted into one-tenth (1/10) of a
Surviving Pubco Ordinary Share. Each certificate that evidenced Sino Rights
immediately prior to the Merger (" _Sino Rights Certificate_ " and together
with the Sino Common Certificates, the " _Sino Certificates_ ") shall entitle
the holder to the applicable number of Surviving Pubco Ordinary Shares into
which the Sino Rights are convertible according to this Section 1.6(a)(ii).

  



  

(iii) Each share of Sino Common Stock and each Sino Right held by Sino
or the Company immediately prior to the Effective Time shall be cancelled and
extinguished without any conversion or payment in respect thereof.

  



  

(iv) Certificates representing Surviving Pubco Ordinary Shares issuable
pursuant to Sections 1.6(a)(i) and 1.6(a)(ii) shall be issued to the holders
of Sino Certificates upon surrender of the applicable Sino Certificates in the
manner provided in Section 1.6(b) (or in the case of a lost, stolen or
destroyed certificate, upon delivery of an affidavit (and indemnity, if
required) in the manner provided in Section 1.10).

  



  

(v)  All of Surviving Pubco Ordinary Shares issued to the holders of
Sino Common Stock and Sino Rights upon consummation of the Merger shall be
deemed to have been issued in full satisfaction of all rights pertaining to
the outstanding Sino Common Stock and Sino Rights that were outstanding
immediately prior to the Effective Time and there shall be no further
registration of transfers on the records of Surviving Pubco of such shares of
Sino Common Stock or Sino Rights.

--- 

    



  

(b)   _Exchange Procedures_.

  



  

(i)  Prior to the Effective Time, Surviving Pubco shall appoint
Continental Stock Transfer and Trust Company (" _Continental_ "), as agent (the
" _Exchange Agent_ "), for the purpose of exchanging Surviving Pubco Ordinary
Shares for Sino Common Stock and Sino Rights. Upon surrender of the Sino
Certificates and delivery of a duly executed letter of transmittal to the
Exchange Agent, the holders of such Sino Certificates shall receive in
exchange therefor certificates representing Surviving Pubco Ordinary Shares
(" _Surviving Pubco Certificates_ ") into which their shares of Sino Common
Stock and Sino Rights shall be converted at the Effective Time and the Sino
Certificates so surrendered shall forthwith be canceled. Surviving Pubco shall
make available to the Exchange Agent, as necessary, Surviving Pubco
Certificates to be paid in respect of the Sino Certificates
surrendered. Until so surrendered, outstanding Sino Certificates will be
deemed, from and after the Effective Time, to evidence only the right to
receive the merger consideration to which the holder thereof is entitled
pursuant to Sections 1.6(a)(i) and 1.6(a)(ii).

  



  

(ii)  If certificates representing Surviving Pubco Ordinary Shares
are to be issued in a name other than that in which the Sino
Certificates surrendered in exchange therefor are registered, it will be a
condition of the issuance thereof that the Sino Certificates so
surrendered will be properly endorsed and otherwise in proper form for
transfer, accompanied by an instrument of transfer that is
reasonably satisfactory to Surviving Pubco and that the persons requesting
such exchange will have paid to Surviving Pubco, or any agent designated by
it, any transfer or other taxes required by reason of the issuance of
certificates representing Surviving Pubco Ordinary Shares in any name other
than that of the registered holder of the Sino Certificates so surrendered, or
established to the satisfaction of Surviving Pubco or any agent designated by
it that such tax has been paid or is not payable.

  



  

1.7   _Share Exchange_.

  



  

(a)   _Exchange_. All of the ordinary shares of the Company ("
_Company Ordinary Shares_ ") issued and outstanding immediately prior to the
Effective Time shall be exchanged at the Effective Time into the right of the
holders thereof to receive an aggregate of:

  



  

(i)  An amount of cash to be paid at the Closing (" _Cash
Consideration_ ") to the bank account(s) designated by each Company
Shareholder equal to (a) the cash remaining in Sino's Trust Fund (as defined
in Section 3.25) after giving effect to the payments required to the
shareholders of Sino who elect to have their shares converted to cash in
accordance with the provisions of Sino's Charter Documents _less_ (b)
$5,000,000; _provided, however_ , that the Cash Consideration shall not
exceed $25,000,000 in the aggregate; and

  



  

(ii)  A number of Surviving Pubco Ordinary Shares to be issued at the
Closing in the names directed by each Company Shareholder determined by
dividing (1) $168,000,000 less the Cash Consideration (including any Converted
Cash Consideration (as defined in the paragraph below)) by (2) the Surviving
Pubco Redemption Share Price (" _Stock Consideration_ ").

--- 

 


--- 

    



  

Notwithstanding anything to the contrary, each Company Shareholder may elect
by written notice delivered to Sino at least two business days prior to the
Closing to convert all or a portion of the Cash Consideration otherwise
payable to it (the " _Converted Cash Consideration_ ") into that number of
Surviving Pubco Ordinary Shares (the " _Additional Stock Consideration_ ")
determined by dividing the Converted Cash Consideration by the Surviving
Pubco Redemption Share Price.

  



  

The Cash Consideration (not including any Converted Cash Consideration) and
the Stock Consideration (including any Additional Stock Consideration) are
referred to herein together as the " _Exchange Consideration_."

  



  

(b)   _Determination of Amounts_. Subject to the terms and conditions
of this Agreement, at the Effective Time, by virtue of the Share Exchange and
this Agreement and without any action on the part of Surviving Pubco, Sino,
the Company or the Company Shareholders, each Company Ordinary Share issued
and outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time will be canceled and
the rights pertaining thereto will be automatically converted into the right
to receive the following portions of the Exchange Consideration:

(f)   _Exchange Procedures_.

  



  

(i)  At the Effective Time, the holders of Company Ordinary Shares
will surrender their Company Certificates representing all of the outstanding
Company Ordinary Shares to Surviving Pubco for cancellation together with any
related documentation reasonably requested by Surviving Pubco in connection
therewith. After the Effective Time, each outstanding Company Certificate will
be deemed for all corporate purposes to evidence only the right to receive
the applicable portion of the Exchange Consideration in accordance with the
provisions of this Article I.

  



  

(ii)  Any cash and Surviving Pubco Ordinary Shares comprising the
Exchange Consideration shall be issued to the holders of Company
Ordinary Shares upon surrender of the Company Certificates as provided for
herein or otherwise agreed by the parties. Upon surrender to Surviving Pubco
of the Company Certificates (or affidavits of loss in lieu thereof as provided
in Section 1.10, below) for cancellation, Surviving Pubco shall pay and
issue, or cause to be paid and issued, to each holder of the Company
Certificates such holder's allocable portion of the cash and Surviving Pubco
Ordinary Shares comprising the Exchange Consideration (subject to a portion
of Surviving Pubco Ordinary Shares being held in escrow pursuant to Section
1.11 below), for which their Company Ordinary Shares are exchangeable at the
Effective Time and any dividends or distributions payable pursuant to Section
1.7(f)(iii), and the Company Certificates so surrendered shall forthwith be
canceled. Until so surrendered, outstanding Company Certificates will be
deemed, from and after the Effective Time, to evidence only the right to
receive the allocable portion of the Exchange Consideration pursuant to this
Section 1.7.

  



  

(iii)  No dividends or other distributions declared or made with
respect to Surviving Pubco Ordinary Shares with a record date after
the Effective Time shall be paid to the holder of any unsurrendered Company
Certificates with respect to the shares of Surviving Pubco Ordinary Shares
represented thereby, and no cash payment in lieu of any fractional share shall
be paid to any such holder, until such holder surrenders such Company
Certificate in accordance with this Section 1.7(f).

  



  

1.8   _No Fractional Amounts_. No fraction of a Surviving Pubco
Ordinary Share will be issued by virtue of the Transactions, and each Person
who would otherwise be entitled to a fraction of a Surviving Pubco Ordinary
Share (after aggregating all fractional Surviving Pubco Ordinary Shares that
otherwise would be received by such holder) shall receive, in lieu of such
fractional share, an amount in cash without interest determined by
multiplying the Surviving Pubco Redemption Share Price by the fraction of a
Surviving Pubco Ordinary Share to which such holder would otherwise have been
entitled. The Cash Consideration payable to any holder of Company Ordinary
Shares by virtue of the Share Exchange shall be rounded up or down to the
nearest cent.

  



  

1.9   _Adjustments_. The number of Surviving Pubco Ordinary Shares
that Company Shareholders are entitled to be issued as a result of the Share
Exchange and the Surviving Pubco Redemption Share Price set forth in Section
1.7(a)(ii) shall be equitably adjusted to reflect appropriately the effect of
any stock split, reverse stock split, stock dividend (including any dividend
or distribution of securities convertible into Sino Common Stock), cash
dividends, reorganization, recapitalization, reclassification, combination,
exchange of shares or other like change with respect to the Sino Common Stock
occurring on or after the date hereof and prior to the Effective Time.

1.10   _Lost, Stolen or Destroyed Certificates_. In the event that any
Sino Certificates or Company Certificates shall have been lost, stolen or
destroyed, Surviving Pubco shall issue in exchange for such lost, stolen or
destroyed certificates, upon the making of an affidavit of that fact by the
holder thereof, the certificates representing Surviving Pubco Ordinary Shares
that the shares of Sino Common Stock and Sino Rights or Company Ordinary
Shares formerly represented by such lost certificates were converted into as
a result of the Transactions; provided, however, that as a condition precedent
to the issuance of such Surviving Pubco Ordinary Shares and other
distributions, the owner of such lost, stolen or destroyed certificates shall
indemnify Surviving Pubco against any claim that may be made against
Surviving Pubco with respect to the certificates alleged to have been lost,
stolen or destroyed.

  



  

1.11   _Escrow_. As the sole remedy for the indemnification
obligations set forth in Article VII of this Agreement, 10% of the Surviving
Pubco Ordinary Shares to be issued in the Share Exchange (the " _Escrow
Shares_ "), without giving effect to any Additional Stock Consideration,
shall be deposited in escrow (the " _Escrow Account_ "), which shall be
allocated between the Company Shareholders in the same proportion as their
proportionate share of the total Company Ordinary Shares outstanding
immediately prior to the Effective Time, all in accordance with the terms and
conditions of the escrow agreement to be entered into at the Closing between
Surviving Pubco, the Representative and Continental (or such other Person as
may be agreed by Surviving Pubco and the Representative), as escrow agent ("
_Escrow Agent_ "), substantially in the form of _Exhibit C_ hereto (the "
_Escrow Agreement_ "). The Escrow Agreement shall provide that on the earlier
of (a) the 30th day after the date Sino has filed with the SEC its Annual
Report for the year ending December 31, 2016 and (b) March 31, 2017 (the "
_Escrow Release Date_ "), the Escrow Agent shall release all Escrow Shares
then remaining in escrow, less that portion of the Escrow Shares applied or
reserved with respect to Escrow Claims. Any Escrow Shares that continue to be
held after the Escrow Release Date with respect to any unresolved Escrow
Claim shall be delivered to the recipients in the same proportions as
originally deposited into escrow, promptly upon such resolution, subject to
reduction, if any, for the indemnification obligation associated with such
resolved Escrow Claim.

  



  

1.12   _Committee and Representative for Purposes of Escrow
Agreement_.

  



  

(a)   _Committee_. Prior to the Closing, the board of directors of
Sino shall appoint a committee consisting of one or more of its then members
to act on behalf of Surviving Pubco to take all necessary actions and make all
decisions pursuant to the Escrow Agreement regarding Surviving Pubco' s right
to indemnification pursuant to Article VII hereof. In the event of a vacancy
in such committee, the board of directors of Sino or, after the consummation
of the Transaction, the board of directors of Surviving Pubco shall
appoint as a successor a Person who was a director of Sino prior to the
Closing Date or some other Person who would qualify as an
"independent" director of Surviving Pubco and who has not had a material
relationship with the Company prior to the Closing. Such committee
is intended to be the " _Committee_ " referred to in Article VII hereof and
the Escrow Agreement.

(the " _Representative_ ") to represent the interests of the Company
Shareholders for purposes of the Escrow Agreement, giving consents and
approvals hereunder and making those determinations hereunder that are
specifically reserved to the Representative by the terms hereof. If such
Person ceases to serve in such capacity, for any reason, those members of the
board of directors of Surviving Pubco who were members of the board of
directors of the Company prior to the Closing shall appoint as successor a
Person who was a former director of the Company or such other Person as
such members shall designate. Such Person or successor is intended to be the
" _Representative_ " referred to in Article VII hereof and the Escrow
Agreement.

  



  

1.13   _Sale Restriction_. Each Surviving Pubco Ordinary Share issued
to holders of Company Ordinary Shares as part of the Exchange Consideration
shall be subject to certain transfer restrictions, in accordance with the
terms of the twelve-month Lock-Up Agreement (the " _Lock-Up Agreement_ ") in
the form of _Exhibit D_ annexed hereto to be executed and delivered to Sino
by the holders of the Company Ordinary Shares. Certificates representing
Surviving Pubco Ordinary Shares issued as a result of the Share Exchange
shall bear a prominent legend to such effect.

  



  

1.14   _Company Shareholder Matters_.

  



  

(a)  By its execution of this Agreement, each Company Shareholder, in
its capacity as a shareholder of the Company, hereby approves and adopts this
Agreement and authorizes the Company, its directors and officers to take all
actions necessary for the consummation of the Merger, Share Exchange and the
other transactions contemplated hereby pursuant to the terms of this Agreement
and its exhibits. Such execution shall be deemed to be action taken by the
irrevocable written consent of the Company Shareholders for purposes of the
IBCA (" _Written Consent_ ").

  



  

(b)  Each Company Shareholder, for itself only, represents and
warrants as follows: (i) all Surviving Pubco Ordinary Shares to be
acquired by such Company Shareholder pursuant to this Agreement will be
acquired for its account and not with a view towards distribution thereof;
(ii) it understands that it must bear the economic risk of the investment in
Surviving Pubco Ordinary Shares, which cannot be sold by it unless it is
registered under the Securities Act, or an exemption therefrom is available
thereunder; (iii) it has had both the opportunity to ask questions and
receive answers from the officers and directors of Sino and Holdco and all
persons acting on Sino's and Holdco's behalf concerning the business and
operations of Sino and Holdco and to obtain any additional information to the
extent Sino or Holdco possesses or may possess such information or can acquire
it without unreasonable effort or expense necessary to verify the accuracy of
such information; (iv) it has had access to the Sino SEC Reports filed prior
to the date of this Agreement, (v) it is either (A) an "accredited investor"

and business matters to enable it to evaluate the merits and risks of an
investment in Sino; and (vi) it understands that the certificates representing
Surviving Pubco Ordinary Shares to be received by it may bear legends to the
effect that Surviving Pubco Ordinary Shares may not be transferred except
upon compliance with (1) the registration requirements of the Securities Act

Company Shareholder that is an entity, for itself, represents, warrants and

(c)  Each Company Shareholder, for itself, represents and warrants
that the execution and delivery of this Agreement by such Company Shareholder
does not, and the performance of its obligations hereunder will not, require
any consent, approval, authorization or permit of, or filing with or
notification to, any court, administrative agency, commission, governmental or
regulatory authority, domestic or foreign (a " _Governmental Entity_ "),
except (i) for applicable requirements, if any, of the Securities Act, the
Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (" _Exchange Act_ ") and the rules and
regulations thereunder, and (ii) where the failure to obtain such consents,
approvals, authorizations or permits, or to make such filings or
notifications, would not, individually or in the aggregate, reasonably be
expected to have a Material Adverse Effect (as defined in Section 9.1)
on such Company Shareholder or the Company or, after the Closing, Surviving
Pubco, or prevent consummation of the Transactions or otherwise prevent the
parties hereto from performing their obligations under this Agreement.

  



  

(d)  Each Company Shareholder for itself represents that (i) it is
not subject to any of the "Bad Actor" disqualifications described in Rule
506(d)(1)(i) to (viii) under Regulation D of the Securities Act (a "
_Disqualification Event_ "), except for a Disqualification Event covered by
Rule 506(d)(2) or (d)(3); and (ii) it owns the Company Ordinary Shares listed
on  _Schedule 2.3(a)_ as being owned by it free and clear of all Liens and

securities, nor has it granted any interest in such securities to any Person
of any nature.

  



  

1.15   _Taking of Necessary Action; Further Action_. If, at any time
after the Effective Time, any further action is necessary or desirable to
carry out the purposes of this Agreement and the Transactions, the then
current officers and directors of Sino or Surviving Pubco (as the case may
be) and the Company Shareholders shall take all such lawful and necessary
action.

Sino and administered by Continental (the " _Trust Fund_ "). The funds held
in the Trust Fund are held in trust pursuant to the Trust Agreement. The
Trust Agreement is valid and in full force and effect and enforceable in
accordance with its terms and has not been amended or modified. There are no
separate agreements, side letters or other agreements or understandings
(whether written or unwritten, express or implied) that would cause the
description of the Trust Agreement in the Sino SEC Reports to be inaccurate
in any material respect and/or that would entitle any Person (other than
stockholders of Sino holding shares of Sino Common Stock sold in Sino's
initial public offering who shall have elected to redeem their shares of Sino
Common Stock pursuant to the certificate of incorporation of Sino and those
Persons to be paid on or after the Closing in connection with the Trust
Fund Deductions) to any portion of the proceeds in the Trust Fund. Prior to
the Closing, none of the funds held in the Trust Account may be released
except (x) to pay income and other tax obligations from any interest income
earned in the Trust Fund and (y) to pay for working capital requirements from
interest income earned on the Trust Fund. Upon consummation of the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement and notice thereof to
Continental, Continental shall thereupon be obligated to release as promptly
as practicable all funds held in the Trust Fund to the shareholders of Sino
who elect to have their shares converted to cash in accordance with the
provisions of Sino's Charter Documents, to the Company Shareholders as payment
of the Cash Consideration pursuant to Section 1.7(a)(i) and to the Surviving
Pubco to pay any Trust Fund Deductions, at which point the Trust Fund shall
terminate. As of the Effective Time, those obligations of Sino to dissolve or
liquidate within a specified time period as contained in Sino's certificate
of incorporation will be terminated and Sino shall have no obligation
whatsoever to dissolve and liquidate the assets of Sino by reason of the
consummation of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, and no
stockholder of Sino shall be entitled to receive any amount from the Trust
Fund or the Surviving Pubco except, with respect to the Trust Fund only, to
the extent such stockholder has exercised its right to cause Sino to redeem
such stockholder's shares of Sino Common Stock for cash pursuant to Sino's
certificate of incorporation, or such stockholder is otherwise entitled to
receive repayment of loans or reimbursement of expenses as part of the Trust
Fund Deductions.

  



  

3.26   _Governmental Filings_. Except as set forth in _Schedule 3.26_
, each of Sino and Holdco has been granted and holds, and has made, all
Governmental Actions/Filings necessary to the conduct by Sino and Holdco of
its business (as presently conducted) or used or held for use by Sino and
Holdco, and true, complete and correct copies of which have heretofore been
delivered to the Company. No event has occurred or is continuing which
requires or permits, or after notice or lapse of time or both would
require or permit, and consummation of the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement or any ancillary documents will not require or permit (with or
without notice or lapse of time, or both), any modification or termination of
any such Governmental Actions/Filings except such events which, either
individually or in the aggregate, would not have a Material Adverse Effect
upon Sino or Holdco.

  



  

3.27   _Investment Company Act_. Sino is not an "investment company"
or a person directly or indirectly "controlled" by or acting on behalf of an
"investment company," in each case within the meaning of the Investment
Company Act of 1940, as amended.

3.28   _Sino Vote Required_. The vote of such holders of shares of
Sino Common Stock as set forth in the Registration Statement is required to
approve the Transactions (collectively, the " _Required Sino Vote_ "). Other
than the Required Sino Vote, there are no other votes of the holders of Sino
Common Stock or of any other class or series of the capital stock of
Sino necessary with respect to such matters.

  



  

3.29   _Representations and Warranties Complete_. Except for the
representations and warranties contained in Article II, each of Sino and
Holdco acknowledges that neither the Company nor any other Person on behalf of
the Company or any of its Affiliates has made, makes or shall be deemed to
make any other express or implied representation or warranty with respect to
the Company (or any of its Subsidiaries) or with respect to any other
information provided to Sino and the Company disclaims any such
representation or warranty. Neither the Company nor any other Person will
have or be subject to any liability or indemnification obligation to Sino or
any other Person resulting from the distribution to Sino, or its use of, any
such information.

  



  

3.30   _Survival of Representations and Warranties_. The
representations and warranties of Sino and Holdco set forth in this Agreement
shall survive until the Closing.

Act, and with all other applicable regulatory bodies, a registration
statement on Form S-4 with respect to the shares of Surviving Pubco Stock to
be issued in connection with the Merger and the Share Exchange (the "
_Registration Statement_ "), which shall include proxy materials for the
purpose of soliciting proxies from holders of Sino Common Stock to vote, at a

(the " _Special Meeting_ "), in favor of (i) the adoption of this Agreement

comply as to form in all material respects with the applicable requirements of
the Securities Act, Exchange Act, the Delaware General Corporation Law and
NASDAQ rules. Such proxy materials shall be in the form of a proxy
statement/prospectus to be used for the purpose of soliciting proxies from

(b)  Sino, Holdco and the Company, with the assistance of their
respective counsel, shall promptly respond to any SEC comments on
such filings and shall otherwise use reasonable best efforts to cause the

described in Section 5.1(a). Unless otherwise agreed in writing by the
Company, Sino agrees that its obligations to hold the Special Meeting
pursuant to this Section 5.1(a) shall exist irrespective of whether the board
of directors of Sino believes Sino's stockholders will vote to approve this
Agreement and the Transactions and shall not be affected by the commencement,
public proposal, public disclosure or communication to Sino of any alternative

such obligation. Neither the board of directors of Sino nor any committee or

request of the Company within five (5) Business Days or (vii) resolve or agree
to do any of the foregoing. Sino shall set a record date (the " _Sino Record

Meeting.

Statement or comments thereon and responses thereto or requests by the SEC
for additional information. No amendment or supplement to the Proxy
Statement/Prospectus or the Registration Statement shall be filed without the

any of their respective Affiliates, officers or directors should be discovered
by Sino, Holdco or the Company that should be set forth in an amendment or
supplement to the Registration Statement or the Proxy Statement/Prospectus so
that such documents would not include any misstatement of a material fact or

party hereto that discovers such information shall promptly notify the other
parties hereto and an appropriate amendment or supplement describing such
information shall be promptly filed with the SEC and, to the extent required
by law, disseminated to the shareholders of Sino, Holdco and the Company.

and such Additional Sino SEC Reports (including any financial statements or
schedules included therein) shall be prepared in accordance and comply in all
material respects with the requirements of the Securities Act or the Exchange
Act, as the case may be, and the rules and regulations of the SEC thereunder
applicable to such Additional Sino SEC Reports. The Additional Sino SEC

will not, at the time they are filed or subsequently amended, contain
any untrue statement of a material fact or omit to state a material fact
required to be stated therein or necessary in order to make the statements
therein, in light of the circumstances under which they were made, not
misleading. As used in this Section 5.2, the term "file" shall be broadly
construed to include any manner in which a document or information is
furnished, supplied or otherwise made available to the SEC.

  



  

5.3   _Required Information_.

  



  

(a)  In connection with the preparation of the Signing Form 8-K, the
Signing Press Release, the Proxy Statement/Prospectus, the Closing Form 8-K

such other reasonable purposes, the Company and Sino each shall, upon request
by the other, promptly furnish the other with all information concerning
themselves, their respective directors, officers, shareholders and Affiliates
and such other matters as may be reasonably necessary or advisable in
connection with the Transactions and the preparation of such document. Each
party represents and warrants to the others that all such information shall
be true and correct in all material respects as of the date of filing,
issuance or other submission or public disclosure of such document and the

submission or public disclosure of a Reviewable Document by either Sino or
the Company, the other party shall be given an opportunity to review and
comment upon such Reviewable Document and give its consent to the form
thereof, such consent not to be unreasonably withheld, provided that a party
may file, issue or otherwise submit a Reviewable Document without the consent
of the other party if it is advised by counsel in writing that such
Reviewable Document must be filed, issued or submitted in the form objected
to by the other party so that the filing, issuing or submitting party is in
compliance with Applicable Law.

(c)  Any language included in a Reviewable Document that reflects the
comments of the reviewing party, as well as any text as to which the
reviewing party has not commented upon after being given a reasonable
opportunity to comment, shall be deemed to have been approved by the
reviewing party and may henceforth be used by the other party in other
Reviewable Documents and in other documents distributed by the other party in
connection with the transactions contemplated by this Agreement without
further review or consent of the reviewing party (unless the reviewing party
subsequently notifies the other party of its objection to the use of such
comments or text in Reviewable Documents or other documents).

  



  

(d)  Prior to the Effective Time (i) Sino and the Company shall
notify each other as promptly as reasonably practicable upon becoming aware
of any event or circumstance which should be described in an amendment of, or

its representatives and the SEC with respect to any of the foregoing filings.

be entitled to participate in the defense of Third Party Claim at their
expense.

  



  

(b)   _Defense_. The Representative shall have the right, at its
option (subject to the limitations set forth in Section 7.2(c)) and at its
own expense, by written notice to the Committee, to assume the entire control
of, subject to the right of Surviving Pubco to participate (at its expense
and with counsel of its choice) in, the defense, compromise or settlement of
the Third Party Claim as to which such Notice of Claim has been given. If the
Representative is permitted and elect to assumes the defense of a Third Party
Claim:

  



  

(i)  the Representative shall diligently and in good faith defend
such Third Party Claim and shall keep Surviving Pubco reasonably informed of
the status of such defense; and

  



  

(ii)  Surviving Pubco shall cooperate fully in all respects with the
Representative in any such defense, compromise or settlement
thereof, including, without limitation, the selection of counsel, and
Surviving Pubco shall make available to the Representative all
pertinent information and documents under its control.

  



  

(c)   _Limitations of Right to Assume Defense_. The Representative
shall not be entitled to assume control of such defense and shall pay the
fees and expenses of counsel retained by Surviving Pubco if (i) the Third
Party Claim relates to or arises in connection with any criminal proceeding,
action, indictment, allegation or investigation; or (ii) the Third Party Claim
seeks an injunction or equitable relief against Surviving Pubco which is not
merely incidental to a primary damage claim or claims for monetary damages.

  



  

(d)   _Other Limitations_. Failure to give prompt Notice of Claim or
to provide copies of relevant available documents or to furnish relevant
available data shall not constitute a defense (in whole or in part) to any
claim for indemnification under this Article VII, except to the extent (and
only to the extent that) such failure shall have adversely affected the
ability of the Representative to defend against or reduce its liability or
caused or increased such liability or otherwise caused the damages for which
the Representative is obligated to be greater than such damages would have
been had Surviving Pubco given the Representative prompt notice hereunder. So
long as the Representative is defending any such action actively and in good
faith, Surviving Pubco shall not settle such action.

--- 

    



  

(e)   _Failure to Defend_. If the Representative, promptly after
receiving a Notice of Claim, fails to defend such Third Party Claim actively
and in good faith, Surviving Pubco, at the reasonable cost and expense of the
Representative, will (upon further written notice to the Company
Shareholders) have the right to undertake the defense, compromise or
settlement of such Third Party Claim as it may determine in its reasonable
discretion, provided that the Representative shall have the right to approve
any settlement, which approval will not be unreasonably withheld, delayed or
conditioned.

  



  

(f)   _Releases_. Anything in this Section 7.2 to the contrary
notwithstanding, the Company Shareholders shall not, without the written
consent of the Representative, settle or compromise any action or consent to
the entry of any judgment which does not include as an unconditional term
thereof the giving by the claimant or the plaintiff to Surviving Pubco of a
full and unconditional release from all liability and obligation in respect
of such action without any payment by Surviving Pubco or Surviving Pubco.

  



  

(g)   _Representative Consent_. Unless the Representative has
consented to a settlement of a Third Party Claim, the amount of the
settlement shall not be a binding determination of the amount of the Loss and
such amount shall be determined in accordance with the provisions of the
Escrow Agreement.

  



  

7.3   _Insurance Effect_. Notwithstanding any provision in this
Agreement to the contrary, all Losses for which an Indemnitee would otherwise
be entitled to indemnification under this Article VII shall be reduced by the
amount of insurance proceeds (net of premium, deductible, future premium
increases and any other increased insurance costs as a result of such payment
of proceeds), indemnification payments and other third-party recoveries
actually received by such Indemnitee in respect of any Losses. In the event
that any such insurance proceeds, indemnity payments or other third-party
recoveries are realized by an Indemnitee subsequent to receipt by such
Indemnitee of any indemnification payment hereunder in respect of the claims
to which such insurance proceeds, indemnity payments or other third-party
recoveries relate, appropriate refunds shall be made promptly by such
Indemnitee of all or the relevant portion of such indemnification payment.

  



  

7.4   _Limitations on Indemnification_.

  



  

(a)   _Survival_. The representations, warranties, covenants and
agreements in this Agreement or in any Schedule or certificate delivered in
connection with this Agreement shall survive the Closing until the Escrow
Release Date (the " _Survival Period_ "); provided, however, that any
indemnification claim made in writing prior to the termination of the Survival
Period shall be preserved despite the subsequent termination of the Survival
Period and any claim set forth in a Notice of Claim sent prior to the
expiration of such Survival Period shall survive until final resolution
thereof. Except as set forth in the immediately preceding sentence, (i) no
claim for indemnification shall be brought after the end of the Survival
Period, and (ii) the indemnification rights of Indemnitees under this Article
VII shall terminate and be of no further force or effect as of the termination
of the Survival Period.

  



  

   

53 
--- 

 


--- 

    



  

(b)   _Deductible_. No amount shall be payable under Article VII
unless and until the aggregate amount of all indemnifiable Losses otherwise
payable exceeds $2,000,000 (the " _Deductible_ "), in which event the amount
payable shall be the entirety of the Loss from the first dollar; provided,
however, that indemnification obligations under Section 7.1(a)(iii) shall not
be subject to the Deductible.

  



  

(c)   _Aggregate Amount Limitation_. The aggregate liability for
Losses hereunder shall not in any event exceed the value of the Escrow Shares
and Surviving Pubco shall not have any claim against the Company Shareholders
other than for any of such Escrow Shares.

  



  

(d)   _Duplication of Recovery_. Any Losses for which a Person is
entitled to indemnification under this Agreement shall be determined without
duplication of recovery by reason of the state of facts giving rise to such
Losses constituting a breach of more than one representation, warranty,
covenant or agreement.

  



  

7.5   _Exclusive Remedy_. The sole remedy of the Indemnitees with
respect to any and all claims for money damages arising out of or relating to
this Agreement shall be pursuant and subject to the requirements of the
indemnification provisions set forth in this Article VII (including Section
7.4(c)). Notwithstanding any of the foregoing, nothing contained in this
Article VII shall in any way impair, modify or otherwise limit an
Indemnitee's right to bring any claim, demand or suit against the other
party based upon such other party's actual fraud or intentional or willful
misconduct, it being understood that a mere breach of a representation and
warranty does not constitute fraud and that an Indemnitee may not pursue such
claim, demand or suit unless and only to the extent that all of the Escrow
Shares have been released.

  



  

7.6   _Adjustment to Exchange Consideration_. Amounts paid for
indemnification under Article VII shall be deemed to be an adjustment to the
Exchange Consideration paid by Surviving Pubco as a result of the
Transactions, except as otherwise required by Law.

  



  

7.7   _Representative Capacities; Application of Escrow Shares_. The
parties acknowledge that the Representative's obligations under this Article
VII are solely as a representative of the Company Shareholders in the manner
set forth in the Escrow Agreement with respect to the obligations to
indemnify the Indemnitees under this Article VII and that the
Representative shall have no personal responsibility for any expenses
incurred by him in such capacity and that all payments to Indemnitees as a
result of such indemnification obligations shall be made solely from, and to
the extent of, the Escrow Shares. Out-of-pocket expenses of the
Representative for attorneys' fees and other costs shall be borne in the first
instance by Surviving Pubco. The parties further acknowledge that all actions
to be taken by Surviving Pubco pursuant to this Article VII shall be taken on
its behalf by the Committee in accordance with the provisions of the Escrow
Agreement. The Escrow Agent, pursuant to the Escrow Agreement after the
Closing, may apply all or a portion of the Escrow Shares to satisfy any claim
for indemnification pursuant to this Article VII. The Escrow Agent will hold
the remaining portion of the Escrow Shares until final resolution of all
claims for indemnification or disputes relating thereto.

  



  

7.8   _Mitigation_. An Indemnitee shall use commercially reasonably
efforts to mitigate Losses suffered, incurred or sustained by it arising out
of any matter for which it is entitled to indemnification hereunder; provided
that no Indemnitee shall be required to (i) take any action or refrain from
taking any action that is contrary to any applicable Contract, order or law
binding on it or any Affiliate thereof or (ii) incur any out-of-pocket
expense in connection with such mitigation (other than de minimis
incidental expenses).

10.2   _Interpretation_. The definitions of the terms herein shall
apply equally to the singular and plural forms of the terms defined. Whenever
the context shall require, any pronoun shall include the corresponding
masculine, feminine and neuter forms. When a reference is made in this
Agreement to an Exhibit or Schedule, such reference shall be to an Exhibit or
Schedule to this Agreement unless otherwise indicated. When a reference is
made in this Agreement to Sections or subsections, such reference shall be to
a Section or subsection of this Agreement. Unless otherwise indicated the
words "include," "includes" and "including" when used herein shall be deemed
in each case to be followed by the words "without limitation." The table of
contents and headings contained in this Agreement are for reference purposes
only and shall not affect in any way the meaning or interpretation of this
Agreement. When reference is made herein to "the business of" an entity,
such reference shall be deemed to include the business of all direct and

10.3   _Counterparts; Facsimile Signatures_. This Agreement and each
other document executed in connection with the transactions contemplated
hereby, and the consummation thereof, may be executed in one or more
counterparts, all of which shall be considered one and the same document and
shall become effective when one or more counterparts have been signed by each

10.4   _Entire Agreement; Third Party Beneficiaries_. This Agreement
and the documents and instruments and other agreements among the parties
hereto as contemplated by or referred to herein, including the Exhibits and
Schedules hereto (a) constitute the entire agreement among the parties with
respect to the subject matter hereof and supersede all prior agreements and
understandings, both written and oral, among the parties with respect to the
subject matter hereof, it being understood that the letter of intent between
Sino and the Company dated January 1, 2015 is hereby terminated in its
entirety and shall be of no further force and effect (except to the extent
expressly stated to survive the execution of this Agreement and the
consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby); and (b) are not
intended to confer upon any other Person any rights or remedies hereunder
(except as specifically provided in this Agreement).

  



  

10.5   _Severability_. In the event that any provision of this
Agreement, or the application thereof, becomes or is declared by a court of
competent jurisdiction to be illegal, void or unenforceable, the remainder of
this Agreement will continue in full force and effect and the application of
such provision to other persons or circumstances will be interpreted so as
reasonably to effect the intent of the parties hereto. The parties further
agree to replace such void or unenforceable provision of this Agreement with
a valid and enforceable provision that will achieve, to the extent possible,
the economic, business and other purposes of such void or unenforceable
provision.

  



  

10.6   _Other Remedies; Specific Performance_. Except as otherwise
provided herein, any and all remedies herein expressly conferred upon a party
will be deemed cumulative with and not exclusive of any other remedy conferred
hereby, or by law or equity upon such party, and the exercise by a party of
any one remedy will not preclude the exercise of any other remedy. The
parties hereto agree that irreparable damage would occur in the event that
any of the provisions of this Agreement were not performed in accordance with
their specific terms or were otherwise breached. It is accordingly agreed that
the parties shall be entitled to seek an injunction or injunctions to prevent
breaches of this Agreement and to enforce specifically the terms and
provisions hereof in any court of the United States or any state having
jurisdiction, this being in addition to any other remedy to which they are
entitled at law or in equity.

  



  

10.7   _Governing Law_. This Agreement shall be governed by and
construed in accordance with the laws of the State of New York regardless of
the law that might otherwise govern under applicable principles of conflicts
of law thereof.

  



  

10.8   _Venue_.

  



  

(a)  The parties hereto agree that any action, proceeding or claim
arising out of or relating in any way to this Agreement shall be resolved
through final and binding arbitration in accordance with the International
Arbitration Rules of the American Arbitration Association (" _AAA_ "). The
arbitration shall be brought before the AAA International Center for Dispute
Resolution's offices in New York City, New York, will be conducted in English
and will be decided by a panel of three arbitrators selected from the AAA
Commercial Disputes Panel and that the arbitrator panel's decision shall be
final and enforceable by any court having jurisdiction over the party from
whom enforcement is sought. The cost of such arbitrators and arbitration
services, together with the prevailing party's legal fees and expenses, shall
be borne by the non-prevailing party or as otherwise directed by
the arbitrators. The Company and the Company Shareholders hereby appoint,
without power of revocation, Johnny Leung, as their respective agent to
accept and acknowledge on its behalf service of any and all process which may
be served in any arbitration, action, proceeding or counterclaim in any way
relating to or arising out of this Agreement. The Company further agrees to
take any and all action as may be necessary to maintain such designation and
appointment of such agent in full force and effect for a period of seven
years from the Closing Date.

(b)  EACH PARTY (ON BEHALF OF ITSELF AND, TO THE FULLEST EXTENT
PERMITTED BY LAW, ON BEHALF OF ITS EQUITY HOLDERS AND CREDITORS)
HEREBY WAIVES ANY RIGHT TO A TRIAL BY JURY IN RESPECT OF ANY CLAIM BASED
UPON, ARISING OUT OF OR IN CONNECTION WITH THIS AGREEMENT AND THE
TRANSACTIONS CONTEMPLATED BY THIS AGREEMENT.

holding or rule of construction providing that ambiguities in an agreement or
other document will be construed against the party drafting such agreement or
document.

  



  

10.10   _Assignment_. No party may assign either this Agreement or any of
its rights, interests, or obligations hereunder without the prior written
approval of the other parties. Subject to the first sentence of this Section
10.9, this Agreement shall be binding upon and shall inure to the benefit of
the parties hereto and their respective successors and permitted assigns.

performance of any of the obligations or other acts of the other parties
hereto, (ii) waive any inaccuracies in the representations and warranties
made to such party contained herein or in any document delivered pursuant
hereto and (iii) waive compliance with any of the agreements or conditions
for the benefit of such party contained herein. Any agreement on the part
of a party hereto to any such extension or waiver shall be valid only if set
forth in an instrument in writing signed on behalf of such party. Delay in
exercising any right under this Agreement shall not constitute a waiver of
such right.
