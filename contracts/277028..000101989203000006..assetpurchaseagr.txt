 AMENDED and RESTATED ASSET PURCHASE
AGREEMENT   AMENDED AND RESTATED ASSET PURCHASE AGREEMENT   This AMENDED
AND RESTATED ASSET PURCHASE AGREEMENT ("Agreement") is made and entered into
as of the 31st day of December 2002, ("Effective Date") by and between HOME
GOLD, INC., a South Carolina corporation ("Seller"); and EMMCO,LLC, a South
Carolina limited liability company ("Purchaser"). Seller and Purchaser are
sometimes referred to individually as "Party" and collectively as the
"Parties."   RECITALS   A. The purpose of this Agreement is to substitute
Emmco, LLC for Emmco Credit Corp, Inc. as Purchaser and to restate in amended
form that certain Asset Purchase Agreement dated November 19, 2002 between
Seller and Emmco Credit Corp., Inc. for the terms and conditions upon which
Purchaser will purchase the retail mortgage loan origination division
(the"Business") of Seller. The Business is sometimes hereinafter called
"HGI". It is generally described and defined by Seller as follows:   Seller
is a South Carolina corporation. It is primarily in the business of operating
a retail mortgage loan origination business. That retail mortgage loan
origination business is operated separately and constitutes HGI. All of
the assets (except for Excluded Assets, if any) of the Business are to be
sold by Seller to Purchaser pursuant to this Agreement.   HGI originates
mortgage loans secured by first and second lien mortgages (or deeds of
trust). Approximately seventy-five percent (75%) of the loans are to subprime
borrowers. The average loan is for approximately $80,000.00, and the monthly
origination volume currently is approximately $80 Million.   HGI operates a
number of retail loan origination centers (seventeen at the present time) at
locations noted below. HGI generates income from origination fees, the sale
of loans to third parties and interest income earned during the typically
short period during which HGI holds the notes prior to sale.   HGI has
adopted and implemented a marketing plan to generate loan production. The
marketing plan consists of the following:   1. HGI produces weekly direct
mailings to potential borrowers.  The mailing lists are compiled from data
collected from various sources  based on HGI\'s experience as to the profiles
of the most likely  borrowers. Two and a half weeks after the mailing, each
recipient of a  mailer is called by a telemarketer to follow up and
identify  prospective borrowers from whom loan applications can be
obtained.  Between 425 and 500 loan applications are generated each day in
this  manner. For some time, HGI was sending out 325,000 direct mailings
per  week, but in the last six months, that number has been cut in half
with    2   no associated loss in applications. Loan closings
attributable to  direct mailings result in approximately 45% of HGI\'s loan
closings.   2. HGI solicits loans through the Internet, utilizing both its 
own website and Internet mortgage loan leads from a variety of sources.  Loan
applications through that source result in approximately five  percent (5%)
of HGI\'s loan closing.   3. HGI does direct telemarketing consisting of
outbound calls  and cold calls from call centers. That telemarketing results
in  approximately 50% of the loan closings.   Presently, HGI has seventeen
office locations, each of which is equipped to solicit and accept home
mortgage loans. Those locations are:   Office Has Been Open

GENERAL. Each of the Parties will use its commercially  reasonable efforts to
take all action and to do all things necessary,  proper or advisable in order
to consummate and make effective the  transactions contemplated by this
Agreement (including satisfaction,  but not waiver, of the closing conditions
set forth in Sections 10 and  11 below).   4.2 NOTICES AND CONSENTS. Seller
will give any notices to  third parties and use its commercially reasonable
efforts to obtain any  third-party consents required by the matters referred
to in Section  5(b) below. Each of the Parties will give any notices to, make
any  filings with, and use its commercially reasonable efforts to obtain
any  required authorizations, consents, and approvals of Governmental 
Bodies.   4.3 MANAGEMENT OF BUSINESS. (a) Upon execution of this  Agreement
Ronald J. Sheppard, Chairman of the Board and CEO of Seller\'s  Parent shall
resign from the Board of Directors and from all offices in  Seller or
Seller\'s Affiliates. From the date this Agreement is executed  until the
Closing, Purchaser is hereby given the right to manage the  Business and
direct its operations, utilizing its business offices,  employees and the
Assets. Purchaser will use its commercially  reasonable efforts to maintain
the Business in the ordinary course of  such business and at not less than
the level of activity existing  during the third quarter of the calendar year
2002. Seller will pay  Purchaser management fees at the rate of Fifty
Thousand Dollars  ($50,000.00) per month from the execution of this Agreement
to the  Closing Date. Purchaser will use commercially reasonable efforts to 
maintain normal relations with Seller\'s customers (i.e., brokers, 
investment bankers, and others who purchase and sell loans to, for or  on
behalf of, Seller) up to the Closing. Purchaser as manager will  cause Seller
not to engage in any practice or undertake any policy not  in the ordinary
course of business pending the Closing which would have  the effect of
reducing the volume of its purchase and/or sale of  mortgage loans of a
quality similar to (or better than) the quality of  loans presently in the
pipeline to be purchased and sold.   (b) To the extent that Seller has
Agreements with  brokers and sales persons which are assignable at the
Closing,  Purchaser will designate which of such agreements it may wish  to
assume. In respect to those Agreements, Seller will execute    8   a
written assignment as of the Closing, assigning Seller\'s  interest in such
contracts which will be assumed.   4.4 INTENTIONALLY OMITTED.   4.5 NOTICE
OF DEVELOPMENTS. Each Party will give prompt notice  to the other Party of
any material adverse development causing a breach  of any of its own
representations and warranties in this Agreement. No  disclosure by any Party
pursuant to this Section 4.5, however, shall be  deemed to amend or
supplement the Schedules hereto or to prevent or  cure any such
misrepresentation, breach of warranty or breach of  covenant that might
otherwise have existed hereunder by reason of the  development.   4.6
ADMINISTRATION OF PENDING LOAN PURCHASES AND SALES. Prior  to the Closing,
Seller will have existing executory agreements in  relation to certain
mortgage loans. In regard thereto, the following  understandings and
allocations shall apply:   (A) FUNDED LOANS. All loans which have funded
prior  to the Closing Date shall be the sole property of Seller, and  all
rights (including the rights to income and profits  therefrom) and all
obligations related thereto shall remain  with Seller.    (B) UNFUNDED
LOANS. Purchaser shall review all  pending loans which are not likely to
close and be funded by  the Closing Date. Purchaser shall as soon as
reasonably  practicable notify Seller as to which of such loans Purchaser 
desires to accept or reject the assignment. For purposes of  completing all
agreements regarding loans in the pipeline  which Purchaser accepts, it may
be necessary for the purchases  and/or sales of such loans to close in the
name of Seller  although Purchaser will be administering the closing. 
Therefore, for valuable consideration, receipt of which is  hereby
acknowledged, Seller hereby appoints Purchaser as its  attorney-in-fact and
in its place, name and stead to (i)  complete each such purchase or sale,
(ii) enter into and  execute as attorney in fact for Seller all purchase
and/or  sales agreements and/or amendments thereto related to such 
transactions as have then been accepted by Purchaser, (iii)  enter into and
execute any agreements with third parties  (including escrow holders,
financial institutions, insurers,  government agencies, consultants,
inspectors, brokers,  contractors, accountants, attorneys, engineers and the
like)  as may be necessary to complete the respective transaction(s)  and
(iv) enter into and execute agreements with any financial  institution(s) in
any manner deemed necessary to complete the  monetary allocation(s) of funds
and make deposits and  withdrawals in conjunction therewith. This power of
attorney  herein granted is irrevocable and coupled with an interest and 
survives the Closing of the transactions contemplated by this  Agreement.  
4.7 EXISTING OFFICE LEASES. Presently, Seller is the  tenant/lessee of 8
office leases which will be assigned to Purchaser at  the Closing. Those
leases are generally described in Schedule 4.7  attached hereto and by this
reference made a part hereof. At the  Closing, the building leases to each of
the offices described on  Schedule 4.7 will be assigned by Seller to
Purchaser. Therefore, prior    9   to the Closing, Seller shall execute a
standard form assignment of each  of the Office Leases to Purchaser and
obtain the Landlord\'s consent  thereto (without changes to the respective
leases), or shall execute a  sublease with Purchaser on substantially the
same terms and conditions  as are contained in the respective office
lease(s). All rents and other  obligations accruing under each Lease assigned
to Purchaser will be  prorated as of the Closing Date. Seller shall be
responsible for all  rents and other obligations accruing up to the Closing
Date, and  Purchaser shall be responsible therefore after the Closing Date.
Seller  will cooperate with Purchaser and use commercially reasonable
efforts  in obtaining consents to assignments of all leases to be
assigned.   4.8. EQUIPMENT LEASES. Attached hereto is Schedule 4.8 which 
sets forth a schedule of all of the equipment leases to be assigned by 
Seller to Purchaser at the Closing. Upon the Closing, Seller will  deliver to
Purchaser an individual assignment of each such equipment  lease to be
assigned, together with the lessor\'s unconditional consent  to such lease
without any change in the lease\'s terms. The rent under  any such equipment
lease shall be prorated to the Closing Date.   4.9 ASSETS. In regard to the
Assets to be purchased by  Purchaser at the Closing, the Parties agree to do
the following:   (a) At the Closing, Seller will deliver to Purchaser  a
standard form bill of sale conveying to Purchaser title to  all of the
Equipment. Title is to be conveyed free and clear  of any Encumbrance by any
third party or by Seller or any of  Seller\'s Affiliates.   (b) At the
Closing, Seller will deliver to Purchaser  a standard form assignment
conveying to Purchaser all right,  title and interest to all of the
Intellectual Property, free  and clear of any Encumbrances except the claim
or lien of any  valid license agreement. (Said assignment also will include 
Seller\'s rights in all such license agreements, if any).   4.10 SERVICE
CONTRACTS. Seller has heretofore entered into the  Contracts as set forth on
Schedule 1(ii). At the Closing, each Contract  is to be assigned to Purchaser
(to the extent that it is assignable),  and any obligations to pay service
charges thereunder shall be accrued  to the Closing. Seller shall be
responsible for all charges accruing to  the Closing and Purchaser shall be
responsible for all charges accruing  after the Closing. The Parties
understand that Purchaser is not  assuming, and is not liable for, any
obligation, activity or event  related to any such Contract which accrues,
arises or is incurred prior  to the Closing.   4.11 EMPLOYEES. It is
anticipated that Purchaser will offer  employment to certain present
employees of the Business. Responsibility  for all such present employees of
Seller as of the Closing is as  follows:   (a) There is attached hereto
marked Schedule 4.11(a)  a list of Seller\'s present employees to whom
Purchaser intends  to tender an employment offers (said tender in each
instance  to be subject to the closing of the purchase and sale 
contemplated by this Agreement and subject to such terms and    10  
conditions as are acceptable to Purchaser). Such employment,  if it
commences, will commence as of the Closing Date.  Purchaser is to be
responsible for each such employee so  employed only after the Closing and
only in respect to express  written obligations made by Purchaser which
accrue or occur  after the Closing.   (b) Purchaser assumes no obligation
accruing or  occurring up to the Closing nor any obligation arising out of 
Seller\'s employment agreements with any employee. Thus, Seller  is to be
responsible for all wages, salaries, employment and  unemployment taxes,
workmen\'s compensation, health insurance,  vacation pay, sick leave or
allowance/pay, and pension/profit  sharing benefits (if any) up to the
Closing in respect to all  employees, and Purchaser will have no
responsibility therefor.  Purchaser\'s obligations will be limited to the
terms and  conditions of each new employment agreement it consummates  with
the employees it elects to contract. Additionally, the  parties understand
that Seller is not to be responsible or  liable for decisions which Purchaser
makes, or may make,  regarding the employment of (or refusal to employ) any
one or  more of the persons named on Schedule 4.11(a). In the event  that
Purchaser violates, or is alleged to violate, any  employment law applicable
to the employment or non-employment  of any such person(s) and Seller is made
a party to any action  or proceeding as a result thereof, Purchaser hereby
holds  Seller harmless for any loss pertaining to said action or 
proceeding.   (c) Seller shall be responsible to pay for all sums  owing to
all of its employees up to the Closing and shall be  responsible for
severance benefits, if any, owing to all such  employees.   (d) Except as
set forth in Section 4.11(a), Purchaser  shall have no responsibility for any
Employees of Seller at  any time (whether before or after the Closing) where
such  employees are not on Schedule 4.11(a) and employed by  Purchaser after
the Closing.   4.12 PROVIDING INFORMATION. Seller agrees to make available
to  Purchaser in a timely manner at Seller\'s place of business in
Columbia,  South Carolina, and its other offices listed on Schedule 4.7
attached  hereto during normal business hours access to physically review
all  documents, books of account, correspondence and other writings
relating  to the Business and reasonably requested by Purchaser. Purchaser is
to  be provided copies of any such written materials it may reasonably 
request which are reasonably related to this Agreement, the purchase of  the
Assets, Assumed Liabilities and the Business.   4.13 USE OF NAME. The
Parties understand that Seller is to  retain exclusive legal rights in all
states of the United States  wherein Seller is, or has been, doing business
under the names  "HomeGold, Inc." and any other names which Seller has
utilized in the  Business to use each and all such names.   4.14 OTHER
CONSENTS . At the Closing Seller will provide to  Purchaser the following:
(i) a certificate from the Secretary of  Carolina Investors, Inc. certifying
that its Board of Directors has  duly approved the transaction herein set
forth, and (ii) a certificate  from the Secretary of Seller that Seller\'s
Board of Directors and sole    11   shareholder (Seller\'s Parent) has

this provision) and reasonable costs of investigation,  actually incurred or

Affiliates, or any of its respective  officers, directors or employees
(collectively, "Purchaser Losses") as  a result of:   (i) the purchase,

retained by Seller or  liabilities other than the Assumed
Liabilities;     21   (ii) any and all actions, suits, proceedings,

against, without duplication, all costs, fees, Liabilities, Taxes,  charges,
claims, expenses and damages, including reasonable legal fees  and expenses
(both those incurred in connection with the defense or  prosecution of the

as a result of:   (i) any misrepresentation contained in or breach of  or

indemnifications.   Purchaser Losses and Seller Losses are referred to 
collectively as "Losses." Purchaser Covered Actions and Seller Covered

INDEMNITY PROCEDURE.   (i) Upon learning of the commencement of a Covered 
Action or the actual receipt by the Party claiming a right of 
indemnification (the "Indemnified Party") of information  relating to the
purported existence of facts or circumstances  which could result in the
commencement of a Covered Action or  other incurrence of Loss, the
Indemnified Party shall  promptly, but no later than ten (10) working days
after  learning of such commencement or receipt, give written notice 
thereof, with reasonable specificity of the facts as then  known, to the
Party or Parties having the indemnification  obligation (the "Indemnifying
Party" without regard to number)  provided, however, failure to give timely
notice shall not  release the Indemnifying Party of its obligations
hereunder  except, and only, to the extent the Indemnifying Party suffers 
actual prejudice as a proximate result of such failure.   (ii) The
Indemnifying Party shall have the right to  assume the defense of any\' such
Covered Action by giving  written notice (the "Assumption Notice") to the
Indemnified  Party within ten (10) working days after notice is given 
pursuant to Subsection (c)(i) above, which Assumption Notice  shall state
that (A) it agrees that the claimant is entitled  to indemnification
hereunder and that any resulting Loss is a  Purchaser Loss or a Seller Loss,
as the case may be, for which  it is or they are liable; and (B) it agrees to
assume the  defense thereof in the name and on behalf of the Indemnified 
Party with counsel reasonably satisfactory to the Indemnified  Party, in
either event at the sole cost and expense of the  Indemnifying Party;
provided, however, (1) all such costs and    22   expenses of the
foregoing counsel, if not paid by the  Indemnifying Party and instead paid by
the Indemnified Party  shall be Losses indemnifiable by the Indemnifying
Party under  Section 13(a) or (b), as the case may be, (2) the Indemnified 
Party, notwithstanding the timely delivery of an Assumption  Notice, may
participate in such Covered Action through counsel  separately selected and
paid for by the Indemnified Party, and  (3) if no Assumption Notice is timely
given, or despite the  giving of the Assumption Notice the defendants in any
Covered  Action include both the Indemnified Party and the Indemnifying 
Party, and the Indemnified Party shall have reasonably  concluded that there
may be legal defenses available to it  which are different from or additional
to those available to  the Indemnifying Party, or if there is a conflict of
interest  which would prevent counsel for the Indemnifying Party from  also
representing the Indemnified Party, the Indemnified Party  shall have the
right to select one separate counsel to conduct  the defense of such action
on its behalf, and all such costs  and expenses shall be paid by the
Indemnifying Party and, if  paid by the Indemnified Party, shall be Losses
under Section  13(a) or (b), as the case may be. The Indemnified Party may 
take such action with respect to a Covered Action as it may  deem appropriate
to protect against further damage or default,  including obtaining an
extension of time to answer the  complaint or other pleading or filing an
answer thereto.   (iii) Where Seller is the Indemnifying Party, Seller 
shall not consent to the entry of any judgment or enter into  any settlement
without the prior written consent of Purchaser,  which shall not be
unreasonably withheld or delayed. Where  Purchaser is the Indemnifying Party,
Purchaser shall not  consent to the entry of any judgment or enter into any 
settlement without the written consent of Seller, which shall  not be
unreasonably withheld or delayed.   (D) CERTAIN LIMITATIONS. The liability
of Seller and Purchaser for  claims under this Agreement shall be limited by
the following:    (i) The amount of Losses otherwise recoverable under 
this Section 13 shall be reduced to the extent to which any  Federal, state,
local or foreign tax liabilities of Seller or  Purchaser, as applicable, or
any of their respective  Affiliates, is decreased by reason of any Loss in
respect of  which such Seller or Purchaser, as applicable, shall be 
entitled to indemnity under this Agreement (taking into  consideration any
income or gain for tax purposes resulting  from the indemnity payment).  
(ii) Any payment required under this Section 13 paid  to the Purchaser or
Seller, as the case may be, shall be  treated by Purchaser and Seller as a
further adjustment of the  Purchase Price.    (iii) No Loss shall be
