                          AGREEMENT AND PLAN OF MERGER


AGREEMENT AND PLAN OF MERGER, dated as of July 23, 2004 (this "Agreement"),
among Ebro Puleva, S.A., a "sociedad anonima" organized under the laws of Spain
("Parent"), Ebro Puleva Partners G.P., a Delaware general partnership whose
general partners are Parent and Herba Foods S.L., a "sociedad limitada"
organized under the laws of Spain ("Sub"), and Riviana Foods Inc., a Delaware
corporation (the "Company") (Sub and the Company being hereinafter collectively
referred to as the "Constituent Corporations"). Capitalized terms not defined in
the context of the Section of this Agreement in which such terms first appear
shall have the meanings set forth in Section 9.3(b).

                                   WITNESSETH:

         WHEREAS, the respective Boards of Directors of Parent and the Company
and the general partners of the Sub have determined that the acquisition of the
Company by Parent is in the best interests of their respective corporations and
stockholders and have approved such acquisition on the terms and subject to the
conditions set forth herein;

         WHEREAS, in furtherance of such acquisition, Parent proposes to cause
Sub to make a tender offer (as it may be amended from time to time as permitted
under this Agreement, the "Offer") to purchase all of the outstanding shares
(the "Shares") of Common Stock, par value $1.00 per share, of the Company (the
"Company Common Stock") at a purchase price of $25.75 per Share the "Offer
Price"), net to the seller in cash, without interest thereon, upon the terms and
subject to the conditions set forth in this Agreement;

         WHEREAS, the Board of Directors of the Company has adopted resolutions
approving the Offer and the Merger (as defined below) and recommending that
holders of Shares accept the Offer and that the Company's stockholders approve
this Agreement and the transactions contemplated hereby;

         WHEREAS, the respective Boards of Directors of Parent and the Company
and the general partners of the Sub have approved and declared advisable the
merger of Sub and the Company (the "Merger"), upon the terms and subject to the
conditions set forth herein, whereby each issued and outstanding Share not owned
directly or indirectly by Parent or the Company will be converted into the right
to receive the Offer Price; and the Boards of Directors of the Company and the
general partners of the Sub have approved and adopted this Agreement and the
transactions contemplated hereby;

         WHEREAS, in order to induce Parent and Sub to enter into this
Agreement, concurrently herewith Parent, Sub and certain of the stockholders of
the Company set forth on Exhibit B-1 hereto (collectively, the "Significant
Stockholders") are entering into Stockholder Agreements dated as of the date
hereof (the "Stockholder Agreements") in the form attached hereto as Exhibit
B-2, pursuant to which each of the Significant Shareholders has agreed, among
other things, to tender all of their shares of Company Common Stock owned by
such Significant



                                       1
<PAGE>

Shareholder into the Offer and to take certain other actions in furtherance of
the Merger and to grant an irrevocable proxy to the Parent with respect thereto;
and

         WHEREAS, Parent, Sub and Company desire to make certain
representations, warranties, covenants and agreements in connection with the
Offer and the Merger and to prescribe various conditions to the Offer and the
Merger as set forth herein.

         NOW, THEREFORE, in consideration of the premises, representations,
warranties and agreements herein contained, and intending to be legally bound
hereby, the parties hereto agree as follows:

                                   ARTICLE I

                                    THE OFFER

         Section 1.1 THE OFFER.

                  (a) Provided that this Agreement shall not have been
terminated in accordance with Article VIII and none of the events set forth in
Exhibit A shall have occurred, as promptly as practicable but in no event later
than seven (7) business days following the public announcement by Parent and the
Company of the Offer and Merger, Sub shall, and Parent shall cause Sub to,
commence, within the meaning of Rule 14d-2 under the Securities Exchange Act of
1934, as amended (together with the rules and regulations thereunder, the
"Exchange Act"), the Offer at the Offer Price. The obligation of Sub to, and of
Parent to cause Sub to, consummate the Offer and accept for payment, and pay
for, any Shares tendered and not withdrawn pursuant to the Offer shall be
subject to the conditions set forth in Exhibit A (the "Offer Conditions") (any
of which may be waived in whole or in part by Parent and Sub in their sole
discretion, except as expressly provided in the Offer Conditions) and to the
rights of Parent and Sub to terminate this Agreement as provided in Section 8.1.
The conditions to the Offer set forth in Exhibit A are for the sole benefit of
Parent and Sub and may be asserted by Parent and Sub regardless of the
circumstances giving rise to any such conditions (other than as a result of any
action or inaction of Parent or Sub that constitutes a breach of this
Agreement). The initial expiration date of the Offer shall be the twentieth
(20th) business day following commencement of the Offer. The Offer Price shall
be net to the seller in cash, without interest thereon, upon the terms and
subject to the conditions of the Offer. Parent and Sub expressly reserve the
right, in their sole discretion, to modify the terms of the Offer, except that,
without the consent of the Company, Sub shall not (i) reduce the number of
Shares subject to the Offer, (ii) reduce the Offer Price, (iii) impose any
material conditions to the Offer other than the Offer Conditions or modify the
Offer Conditions (other than to waive any Offer Conditions to the extent
permitted by this Agreement); (iv) except as provided in the next sentence,
extend the Offer beyond any scheduled expiration date; (v) change the form of
consideration payable in the Offer (other than adding consideration); or (vi)
amend any other material terms of the Offer in a manner adverse to the holders
of Shares. Notwithstanding the foregoing, Sub may, without the consent of the
Company (i) extend the Offer, if at the scheduled or extended expiration date of
the Offer any of the Offer Conditions shall not be satisfied or waived, until
such time as such conditions are



                                       2
<PAGE>

satisfied or waived; provided, however, that notwithstanding anything herein to
the contrary, if any of the conditions to the Offer are not satisfied or waived
on any scheduled expiration date of the Offer, Parent and Sub shall be required
to extend the Offer until such condition or conditions are satisfied or waived
unless such condition or conditions could not reasonably be expected to be
satisfied by the Outside Date; provided, further, that in no event shall Parent
and Sub be required to extend the expiration date of the Offer beyond the
Outside Date; (ii) extend the Offer for any period required by any rule,
regulation, interpretation or position of the Securities and Exchange Commission
(the "SEC") or the staff thereof applicable to the Offer; (iii) extend the Offer
for any reason on one or more occasions for an aggregate period of not more than
15 business days beyond the latest expiration date that would otherwise be
permitted under clauses (i) and (ii) of this sentence if there shall not have
been tendered a sufficient number of Shares to enable the Merger to be effected
without a meeting of the Company's stockholders in accordance with Section 253
of the General Corporation Law of the State of Delaware, as amended (the
"DGCL"); and (iv) after the Acceptance Date, for one or more subsequent offering
periods of up to an additional twenty (20) business days in the aggregate
pursuant to Rule 14d-11 of the Exchange Act, in each case subject to the right
of Parent, Sub or the Company to terminate this Agreement pursuant to the terms
hereof. Subject to the foregoing and applicable law and upon the terms and
subject to the conditions of the Offer, Sub shall, and Parent shall cause it to,
accept for payment, as promptly as permitted under applicable securities laws,
and pay for (after giving effect to any required withholding tax), as promptly
as practicable after the date on which Sub first accepts shares for payment
pursuant to the Offer (such date, regardless of whether Parent and Sub elect to
provide for one or more subsequent offering periods pursuant to Rule 14d-11 of
the Exchange Act, the "Acceptance Date") all shares of Company Common Stock
validly tendered and not withdrawn pursuant to the Offer.

                  (b) The Offer shall be made by means of an offer to purchase
(the "Offer to Purchase") subject to the Offer Conditions set forth in Exhibit
A. On the date of commencement of the Offer, Parent and Sub shall file with the
SEC a Tender Offer Statement on Schedule TO (together with all supplements or
amendments thereto, the "Schedule TO") with respect to the Offer, which shall
contain as an exhibit or incorporate by reference the Offer to Purchase and a
related letter of transmittal and summary advertisement (such Schedule TO and
the documents included therein pursuant to which the Offer will be made,
together with any supplements or amendments thereto, the "Offer Documents"), and
Parent and Sub shall cause to be disseminated the Offer Documents to holders of
Shares as and to the extent required by applicable federal securities laws.
Parent and Sub agree that the Offer Documents shall comply in all material
respects with the Exchange Act and the Offer Documents, on the date first
published, sent or given to the Company's stockholders, shall not contain any
untrue statement of a material fact or omit to state any material fact required
to be stated therein or necessary in order to make the statements therein, in
light of the circumstances under which they were made, not misleading, except
that no covenant is made by Parent or Sub with respect to information supplied
by the Company or any of its stockholders specifically for inclusion or
incorporation by reference in the Offer Documents. Each of Parent, Sub and the
Company agrees to correct promptly any information provided by it for use in the
Offer Documents if and to the extent that the Offer Documents shall be, or have
become, false or misleading in any material respect, and Parent and Sub further
agree to take all steps necessary to cause the Schedule TO, as so corrected, to
be filed with the SEC and the other Offer Documents, as so corrected, to be


                                       3
<PAGE>

disseminated to holders of Shares, in each case as and to the extent required by
applicable federal securities laws. The Company and its counsel shall be given
reasonable opportunity to review and comment upon the Offer Documents prior to
their filing with the SEC or dissemination to the stockholders of the Company.
Parent and Sub agree to provide the Company and its counsel any comments Parent,
Sub or their counsel may receive from the SEC or its staff with respect to the
Offer Documents promptly after the receipt of such comments and to cooperate
with the Company and its counsel in responding to any such comments.

         Section 1.2 COMPANY ACTIONS.

                  (a) The Company hereby approves of and consents to the Offer
and represents and warrants that the Board of Directors of the Company, at a
meeting duly called and held on July 22, 2004, at which all directors were
present (in person or by telephone), duly and unanimously adopted resolutions:
(i) approving and adopting this Agreement, including the Offer, the Merger and
the other transactions contemplated hereby; (ii) taking all action necessary to
render the provisions of Section 203 of the DGCL and other state takeover
statutes inapplicable to the Offer, the Merger, this Agreement, the Stockholder
Agreements and the transactions contemplated hereby and thereby as contemplated
by Section 4.17 hereof; (iii) determining that this Agreement and the
transactions contemplated hereby, including the Offer and the Merger, are
advisable, fair to, and in the best interests of, the Company and the Company's
stockholders and that the consideration to be paid for each Share in the Offer
and the Merger is fair to the holders of Shares; and (iv) recommending that
holders of Shares accept the Offer, tender their Shares pursuant to the Offer
and approve this Agreement and the transactions contemplated hereby, including
the Merger. The Company hereby consents to the inclusion in the Offer Documents
of the recommendations of the Board of Directors of the Company described in
this Section 1.2(a); provided, however, that the Company's Board of Directors
may withdraw, modify or amend the recommendation if it determines in good faith
only after consultation with Goldman Sachs & Co. (the "Company Financial
Advisor") and receipt of and based upon advice from outside legal counsel to the
Company that the Board of Directors is required by fiduciary duties to the
Company's stockholders under applicable law to withdraw, modify or amend its
recommendations in response to a Superior Proposal as provided in Section 5.2
below. The Company represents and warrants to Parent and Sub that it has been
advised by each of its directors and executive officers that each such person
intends to tender all Shares owned by such person pursuant to the Offer.

                  (b) On the date on which the Offer Documents are filed with
the SEC, the Company shall file with the SEC a Tender Offer
Solicitation/Recommendation Statement on Schedule 14D-9 with respect to the
Offer (together with any amendments or supplements thereto, the "Schedule
14D-9") that will comply in all material respects with the provisions of all
applicable federal securities laws and that will contain the recommendations of
the Board of Directors of the Company and the opinion of the Company Financial
Advisor, in each case, described in Section 1.2(a), and the Company shall cause
to be disseminated the Schedule 14D-9 along with the Offer Documents to holders
of Shares as and to the extent required by applicable federal securities laws.
On the date filed with the SEC and on the date first published, sent or given to
the Company's stockholders, the Schedule 14D-9 shall not contain any untrue
statement of a material fact or omit to state any material fact required to be
stated



                                       4
<PAGE>

therein or necessary in order to make the statements therein, in light of the
circumstances under which they were made, not misleading, except that no
covenant is made by the Company with respect to information supplied by Parent
or Sub specifically for inclusion in the Schedule 14D-9. Each of the Company,
Parent and Sub agrees to correct promptly any information provided by it for use
in the Schedule 14D-9 if and to the extent that such information shall be, or
has become, false or misleading in any material respect, and the Company further
agrees to take all steps necessary to amend or supplement the Schedule 14D-9 and
to cause the Schedule 14D-9, as so corrected, to be filed with the SEC and
disseminated to holders of Shares, in each case as and to the extent required by
applicable federal securities laws. Parent and its counsel shall be given
reasonable opportunity to review and comment upon the Schedule 14D-9 prior to
its filing with the SEC or dissemination to holders of Shares. The Company
agrees to provide Parent and its counsel any comments the Company or its counsel
may receive from the SEC or its staff with respect to the Schedule 14D-9
promptly after the receipt of such comments and to cooperate with Parent, Sub
and their counsel in responding to any such comments.

                  (c) The Company hereby consents to the inclusion of the
recommendations of the Board of Directors of the Company and the opinion of the
Company Financial Advisor, in each case, described in Section 1.2(a) in, as
necessary, the proxy statement (including the form of proxies) ("Proxy
Statement") or information statement ("Information Statement") relating to the
vote of the Company's stockholders with respect to this Agreement (as amended,
supplemented or modified, the Proxy Statement and the Information Statement,
together the "Company Proxy Statement").

                  (d) In connection with the Offer and the Merger, the Company
shall cause its transfer agent or agents to furnish Sub promptly with mailing
labels containing the names and addresses of the record holders of Shares as of
a recent date and of those Persons becoming record holders subsequent to such
date, together with copies of all lists of stockholders, security position
listings and computer files and all other information in the Company's
possession or control regarding the beneficial owners of Shares and any
securities convertible into Shares, and shall furnish to Sub such information
and assistance (including updated lists of stockholders, security position
listings and computer files) as Parent may reasonably request in communicating
the Offer to the record and beneficial holders of Shares. Subject to the
requirements of applicable law, and except for such steps as are necessary to
disseminate the Offer Documents and any other documents necessary to consummate
the Merger, Parent and Sub and their agents shall hold in confidence the
information contained in any such labels, listings and files, will use such
information only in connection with the Offer and the Merger and, if this
Agreement shall be terminated, will, upon request, deliver, and will use their
reasonable efforts to cause their agents to deliver, to the Company all copies
of such information then in their possession or control.

                                   THE MERGER

         Section 2.1 THE MERGER. Upon the terms and subject to the conditions
hereof, and in accordance with the DGCL, Sub shall be merged with and into the
Company at the Effective Time (as hereinafter defined). Upon the Merger, the
separate partnership existence of Sub shall cease, and the Company shall
continue as the surviving corporation (the "Surviving Corporation") and shall
succeed to and assume all the rights and obligations of Sub in accordance with
the DGCL. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary herein, at the election of
Parent, any direct or indirect wholly-owned Subsidiary (as hereinafter defined)
of Parent may be substituted for Sub as a constituent corporation in the Merger.
In such event, the parties agree to execute an appropriate amendment to this
Agreement, in form and substance reasonably satisfactory to Parent and the
Company, in order to reflect such substitution.

         Section 2.2 EFFECTIVE TIME. If all the conditions to the Merger set
forth in Article VII of this Agreement have been fulfilled or waived and this
Agreement shall not have been terminated as provided in Article VIII hereof, the
parties hereto shall cause a certificate of merger, or if applicable, a
certificate of ownership and merger, (the "Certificate of Merger") to be
properly executed and filed in accordance with the DGCL and the terms of this
Agreement on the Closing Date and shall cause all other filings and records
required by applicable law in connection with the Merger. The Merger shall
become effective when the Certificate of Merger executed in accordance with the
relevant provisions of the DGCL, is filed with the Secretary of State of the
State of Delaware; provided, however, that, upon mutual written consent of the
Company and the Sub, the Certificate of Merger may provide for a later date and
time of effectiveness of the Merger. When used in this Agreement, the term
"Effective Time" shall mean the date and time at which the Certificate of Merger
is accepted for record or such later date and time of effectiveness of the
Merger established by the Certificate of Merger. The Certificate of Merger shall
be filed on the date of the Closing (as defined below).

         Section 2.3 EFFECTS OF THE MERGER. The Merger shall have the effects
set forth in the DGCL. Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, and
subject thereto, at the Effective Time, all the property, rights, privileges,
powers and franchises of the Company and Sub shall vest in the Surviving
Corporation, and all debts, liabilities and duties of the Company and Sub shall
become the debts, liabilities and duties of the Surviving Corporation.

         Section 2.4 CHARTER AND BY-LAWS; DIRECTORS AND OFFICERS.

                  (a) At the Effective Time, the Restated Certificate of
Incorporation of the Company (the "Company Charter"), as amended as set forth on
Exhibit C-1, shall be the Certificate of Incorporation of the Surviving
Corporation until thereafter changed or amended as provided therein or by
applicable law. At the Effective Time, the Restated By-laws of Company, in the
form attached hereto as Exhibit C-2, shall be the By-laws of the Surviving
Corporation until thereafter changed or amended as provided therein or by the
Company Charter.

                  (b) At the Effective Time the initial directors of the
Surviving Corporation shall be those persons set forth on Exhibit C-3 hereto,
until the earlier of their resignation, removal or death or until their
respective successors are duly elected and qualified, as the case



                                       6
<PAGE>

may be. The officers of the Company at the Effective Time shall be the initial
officers of the Surviving Corporation, until the earlier of their resignation,
removal or death or until their respective successors are duly elected and
qualified, as the case may be.

         Section 2.5 CONVERSION OF SHARES. As of the Effective Time, by virtue
of the Merger and without any action on the part of Sub, the Company or the
holders of any securities of the Constituent Corporations:

                  (a) Each issued and outstanding partnership interest of Sub,
shall be canceled and converted into and thereafter represent one validly
issued, fully paid and nonassessable share of common stock of the Surviving
Corporation, par value $1.00 per share, which newly issued shares shall
constitute all of the issued and outstanding capital stock of the Surviving
Corporation.

                  (b) All Shares that are held in the treasury of the Company
and all Shares owned by Parent or by any Subsidiary of Parent immediately prior
to the Effective Time shall be canceled, and no capital stock of Parent or other
consideration shall be delivered in exchange therefor.

                  (c) Subject to the provisions of Section 2.5(d), each Share
issued and outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time (other than
shares to be canceled in accordance with Section 2.5(b) and other than
Dissenting Shares (as defined in Section 2.5(d)) shall be canceled and converted
into the right to receive from the Surviving Corporation the Offer Price in
cash, without interest (the "Merger Consideration"), upon surrender of the
certificate representing such Share as provided in Section 2.6 of this
Agreement. All such Shares, when so converted, shall no longer be outstanding
and shall automatically be canceled and retired, and each holder of a
certificate representing any such Shares shall cease to have any rights with
respect thereto, except the right to receive the Merger Consideration.

                  (d) Notwithstanding any provision of this Agreement to the
contrary, if required by the DGCL but only to the extent required thereby,
Shares that are issued and outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time
that have not been voted for adoption of this Agreement and are held by holders
who have properly exercised appraisal rights with respect thereto in accordance
with Section 262 of the DGCL (the "Dissenting Shares") will not be converted
into the right to receive the Merger Consideration, and holders of such Shares
will be entitled to receive payment of the appraised value of such Shares in
accordance with the provisions of such Section 262 unless and until such holders
fail to perfect, or effectively withdraw or lose, their rights to appraisal and
payment under the DGCL. If, after the Effective Time, any such holder fails to
perfect, or effectively withdraws or loses, such right, then such Shares will
thereupon be treated as if they had been converted into, at the Effective Time,
the right to receive the Merger Consideration, without any interest thereon,
pursuant to Section 2.5(c). Prior to the Effective Time, the Company will give
Parent prompt written notice and copies of (i) any demands received by the
Company for appraisals of Shares and (ii) all written and electronic
communications between the Company and its representatives, on the one hand, and
the dissenting stockholders and their representatives, on the other hand
relating thereto.




                                       7
<PAGE>

The Company shall give Parent the opportunity to participate in and direct all
negotiations and proceedings with respect to such demands. The Company shall
not, except with the prior written consent of Parent, make any payment with
respect to any demands for appraisal or offer to settle, settle or otherwise
negotiate any such demands. Each Dissenting Share, if any, shall be canceled
after payment in respect thereof made to the holder thereof pursuant to the
DGCL.

         Section 2.6 EXCHANGE OF CERTIFICATES.

                  (a) Prior to the Effective Time, Parent shall designate a
United States bank or trust company (or such other Person or Persons as shall be
reasonably acceptable to Parent and the Company) to act as paying agent in the
Merger (the "Paying Agent"), and from time to time on, prior to or after the
Effective Time, Parent shall make available, or cause the Surviving Corporation
to make available, to the Paying Agent cash in amounts and at the times
necessary for the payment of the Merger Consideration upon surrender of
certificates representing Shares as part of the Merger pursuant to Section 2.5.
Such funds shall be invested by the Paying Agent as directed by Parent. Any and
all profits resulting from, or interest or income earned on or produced by, such
investments shall be payable as directed by Parent.

                  (b) As soon as reasonably practicable after the Effective
Time, the Paying Agent shall mail to each holder of record of a certificate or
certificates (the "Certificates") that immediately prior to the Effective Time
represented Shares which were converted into the right to receive the Merger
Consideration, (i) a letter of transmittal (which shall specify that delivery
shall be effected, and risk of loss and title to the Certificates shall pass,
only upon delivery of the Certificates to the Paying Agent and shall be in a
form and have such other provisions as Parent may reasonably specify) and (ii)
instructions for use in effecting the surrender of the Certificates in exchange
for the Merger Consideration as provided in Section 2.5. Upon surrender of a
Certificate for cancellation to the Paying Agent or to such other agent or
agents as may be appointed by Parent, together with such letter of transmittal,
duly completed and validly executed, and such other documents as may be
reasonably required by the Paying Agent, the holder of such Certificate shall be
entitled to receive in exchange therefor a check representing the amount of
cash, without interest, into which the Shares theretofore represented by such
Certificate shall have been converted pursuant to Section 2.5, and the
Certificate so surrendered shall forthwith be canceled. In the event of a
transfer of ownership of Shares that is not registered in the transfer records
of the Company, payment may be made to a Person other than the Person in whose
name the Certificate so surrendered is registered, if such Certificate shall be
properly endorsed or otherwise be in proper form for transfer and otherwise
accompanied by all documents required to evidence and effect such transfer and
the Person requesting such payment shall pay any transfer or other Taxes
required by reason of the payment to a Person other than the registered holder
of such Certificate or establish to the satisfaction of the Surviving
Corporation that such Tax has been paid or is not applicable. Until surrendered
as contemplated by this Section 2.6, each Certificate (other than Certificates
representing Dissenting Shares or Shares to be cancelled in accordance with
Section 2.5(b) above) shall be deemed for all purposes at any time after the
Effective Time to represent only the right to receive upon such surrender the
amount of cash, without interest, into which the Shares theretofore represented
by such Certificate shall have been converted pursuant to Section 2.5. No
interest will be paid or will accrue on the cash payable upon the surrender of
any Certificate.



                                       8
<PAGE>

Parent (or any affiliate thereof) or the Paying Agent shall be entitled to
deduct and withhold from the consideration otherwise payable pursuant to this
Agreement to any holder of Shares such amounts as Parent or the Paying Agent is
required to deduct and withhold with respect to the making of such payment under
the Code (as hereinafter defined) or under any provisions of state, local or
foreign Tax law. To the extent that amounts are so withheld by Parent or the
Paying Agent, such withheld amounts shall be treated for all purposes of this
Agreement as having been paid to the Person in respect of which such deduction
or withholding was made by Parent or the Paying Agent.

                  (c) All cash paid upon the surrender of Certificates in
accordance with the terms of this Article II shall be deemed to have been paid
in full satisfaction of all rights pertaining to the Shares theretofore
represented by such Certificates. At the Effective Time, the stock transfer
books of the Company shall be closed, and there shall be no further registration
of transfers on the stock transfer books of the Surviving Corporation of the
Shares that were outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time. If, after
the Effective Time, Certificates are presented to the Surviving Corporation or
the Paying Agent for any reason, then they shall be canceled and exchanged as
provided in this Article II.

                  (d) Promptly following the date that is six months after the
Effective Time, the Paying Agent shall deliver to Parent all cash, certificates
and other documents in its possession relating to the transactions contemplated
hereby, and the Paying Agent's duties shall terminate. Thereafter, each holder
of a Certificate (other than Certificates representing Dissenting Shares and
Certificates representing Shares to be canceled pursuant to Section 2.5(b))
shall look only to the Surviving Corporation (subject to abandoned property,
escheat or similar laws) and only as general creditors thereof, with respect to
any Merger Consideration that may be payable, without interest thereon, upon due
surrender of the Certificates held by such holder.

                  (e) Notwithstanding the foregoing, none of Parent, Sub, the
Company or the Paying Agent shall be liable to any Person in respect of any cash
delivered to a public official pursuant to any applicable abandoned property,
escheat or similar law. If any Certificates shall not have been surrendered
prior to seven years after the Effective Time (or immediately prior to such
earlier date on which any payment pursuant to this Article II would otherwise
escheat to or become the property of any Governmental Entity (as hereinafter
defined)), then the cash payment in respect of such Certificate shall, to the
extent permitted by applicable law, become the property of the Surviving
Corporation, free and clear of all claims or interests of any Person previously
entitled thereto.

                  (f) If any Certificate shall have been lost, stolen or
destroyed, upon the making of an affidavit of that fact by the Person claiming
such Certificate to be lost, stolen or destroyed and, if required by Parent or
the Paying Agent, the posting by such Person of a bond, in such reasonable
amount as Parent or the Paying Agent may direct as indemnity against any claim
that may be made against them with respect to such Certificate, the Paying Agent
will pay in exchange for such lost, stolen or destroyed Certificate the amount
of cash to which the holders thereof are entitled pursuant to this Article II.

         Section 2.7 STOCK PLANS. Immediately prior to the Effective Time, each
then outstanding stock option or similar right (collectively, the "Options"),
whether or not then vested or exercisable, shall be (or, if not previously
vested and exercisable, shall become), consistent with the plans and agreements
applicable to such Options (each, a "Stock Plan"), vested and exercisable and
such Options as of the Effective Time shall be canceled by the Company, and each
then vested Option shall no longer be exercisable but shall entitle the holder
thereof, in cancellation and settlement therefor, to a payment in cash by the
Company (subject to any applicable withholding taxes) (and, if necessary, Parent
shall provide funds to the Company sufficient for such payments), promptly
following the Effective Time, equal to the product of (a) the total number of
Shares subject to such vested Option and (b) the excess, if any, of the Merger
Consideration over the exercise price per Share subject to such vested Option
(such amounts payable hereunder being referred to as the "Cash Payment"). All
Stock Plans and any other plan, program or arrangement providing for the
issuance or grant of any other interest in respect of the capital stock of the
Company or any Subsidiary of the Company shall terminate as of the Effective
Time. The Company shall take all actions necessary to effectuate the provisions
of this Section 2.7, including obtaining all necessary consents to ensure that,
after the Effective Time, holders of Options will have no rights in respect of
such Options other than the rights of the holders of vested Options to receive
the Cash Payment in cancellation and settlement thereof. The Cash Payment shall
be made by check representing the applicable cash amount, without interest.

         Section 2.8 FURTHER ASSURANCES. If, at any time after the Effective
Time, the Surviving Corporation shall consider or be advised that any deeds,
bills of sale, assignments or assurances or any other acts or things are
necessary, desirable or proper (a) to vest, perfect or confirm, of record or
otherwise, in the Surviving Corporation its right, title or interest in, to or
under any of the rights, privileges, powers, franchises, properties or assets of
either of the Constituent Corporations acquired or to be acquired by the
Surviving Corporation as a result of, or in connection with, the Merger or (b)
otherwise to carry out the purposes of this Agreement, then the Surviving
Corporation and its proper officers and directors or their designees shall be
authorized to execute and deliver, in the name and on behalf of either of the
Constituent Corporations, all such deeds, bills of sale, assignments and
assurances and to do, in the name and on behalf of either Constituent
Corporation, all such other acts and things as may be necessary, desirable or
proper to vest, perfect or confirm the Surviving Corporation's right, title or
interest in, to or under any of the rights, privileges, powers, franchises,
properties or assets of such Constituent Corporation and otherwise to carry out
the purposes of this Agreement.

         Section 2.9 CLOSING. Subject to the terms and conditions of this
Agreement, the closing of the Merger (the "Closing") shall take place (a) at the
offices of Dewey Ballantine LLP, 1301 Avenue of the Americas, New York, New York
10019-6012 on the date that the last of the conditions set forth in Article VII
of this Agreement (other than (i) those that are waived by the party or parties
for whose benefit such conditions exist and (ii) any such conditions which, by
their terms, are not capable of being satisfied until the Closing Date) are
satisfied; or (b) at such other place, time and/or date as the parties hereto
may otherwise agree. The date upon which the Closing shall occur is referred to
herein as the "Closing Date."

Subsidiaries are duly qualified to do business, and are in good standing, in
each jurisdiction where the character of their properties owned or held under
lease or the nature of their activities makes such qualification necessary,

Subsidiaries of the Company, together with the jurisdiction of incorporation of
each Subsidiary of the Company, the percentage of the outstanding capital stock
of each Subsidiary owned by the Company and each other Subsidiary of the Company
and the name of any Person other than the Company or another Subsidiary of the

legal entity. There are no current or prospective obligations of the Company or
any of its Subsidiaries to provide funds to, or make any investment in (in the

                           (iv) 1,388,120 Shares were issuable upon exercise of
         outstanding Options granted under the Stock Plans as set forth on
         Section 4.2(b)(iv) of the Disclosure Schedule.

                  (c) Except as described on Section 4.2(c) of the Disclosure
Schedule, there are no options, warrants, calls, rights or agreements to which
the Company or any of its Subsidiaries is a party or by which any of them is

         independent nationally recognized financial advisor) and its legal
         advisors to negotiate in good faith with Parent and its advisors in an
         effort to make such adjustments in the terms and conditions of this

         of its fiduciary duties to the Company's stockholders under applicable

<PAGE>

         agreement with respect to such Takeover Proposal at any time before the
         day that is the fourth business day after Parent receives written
         notice from the Company stating that the Board of Directors of the
         Company has determined such Takeover Proposal constitutes a Superior
         Proposal and fulfills its obligations under (B) above and (G)

Proposal or such request, inquiry or proposal or with whom any discussions or
negotiations are taking place. Prior to furnishing nonpublic information to, or
entering into discussions or negotiations with, any other Person, the Company
shall enter into a customary confidentiality agreement with such Person (if the
Company has not already entered into a customary confidentiality agreement with
such Person), it being understood that such confidentiality agreement (i) shall
not include any provision calling for any exclusive right to negotiate with such
party or having the effect of prohibiting the Company from satisfying its
obligations hereunder and (ii) shall be no less favorable to the Company than

         Section 6.1 STOCKHOLDER MEETING.

                  (a) The Company will duly call, give notice of, convene and
hold a meeting of stockholders (the "Stockholder Meeting") for the purpose of
considering the approval of this Agreement and at such meeting call for a vote
and cause proxies to be voted in respect of the approval and adoption of this
Agreement (if such meeting is required). The Stockholder Meeting shall be held
as soon as practicable following the purchase of Shares pursuant to the Offer,
and, subject to Section 5.2(a)(iii) above the Company will, through its Board of
Directors, recommend to its stockholders the approval of this Agreement, not
withdraw or modify such recommendation, use its reasonable best efforts to
solicit from stockholders of the Company proxies in favor of the Merger and take
all other action necessary or, in the reasonable opinion of Parent, advisable to
secure any vote of stockholders required by the DGCL. The record date for the
Stockholder Meeting shall be a date subsequent to the date on which Parent or
Sub becomes a record holder of Company Common Stock purchased pursuant to the
Offer.

                  (b) The Company shall, at Parent's request, as soon as
practicable following the consummation of the Offer if the Stockholder Meeting
is required and if required by the Exchange Act, prepare and file a preliminary
Proxy Statement with the SEC and shall use its reasonable best efforts to
respond to any comments of the SEC or its staff and to cause the Proxy Statement
to be mailed to the Company's stockholders as promptly as practicable after
responding to all such comments to the satisfaction of the staff. Prior to such
filing, the Company shall afford Parent and its counsel a reasonable opportunity
to review and comment on the proposed form of the Company Proxy Statement, and
neither the Company Proxy Statement, nor any amendment or supplement to the
Company Proxy Statement, will be made by the Company without the approval of
Parent, which approval shall not be unreasonably withheld. The Company shall
notify Parent promptly of the receipt of any comments from the SEC or its staff
and of any request by the SEC or its staff for amendments or supplements to the
Proxy Statement or for additional information and will supply Parent with copies
of all correspondence between the Company or any of its representatives, on the
one hand, and the SEC or its staff, on the other hand, with respect to the Proxy
Statement or the Merger. If, at any time prior to the Stockholder Meeting, there
shall occur any event that should be set forth in an amendment or supplement to
the Proxy Statement, then upon learning of such event shall promptly inform the
Parent and, subject to the following sentence, the Company shall promptly
prepare and mail to its stockholders such an amendment or supplement. Parent and

                  (d) Notwithstanding the foregoing, if Sub, or any other direct
or indirect Subsidiary of Parent, shall acquire at least 90 percent of the
outstanding Shares and, provided that the conditions set forth in Article VII
shall have been satisfied or waived, the Company shall, at the request of
Parent, take all necessary and appropriate action to cause the Merger to become
effective as soon as practicable after such acquisition, without a meeting of
stockholders of the Company, in accordance with Section 253 of the DGCL.

         Section 6.2 ACCESS TO INFORMATION. The Company shall, and shall cause
each of its Subsidiaries to, afford to the accountants, counsel, financial
advisors and other representatives of Parent reasonable access to, during normal
business hours, and permit them to make such inspections as they may reasonably
require of, during the period from the date of this Agreement through the
Effective Time, all of their respective properties, books, contracts,
commitments and records (including accounting records and Tax Returns and the
work papers of independent accountants, if available and subject to the consent
of such independent accountants), and during such period, the Company shall, and
shall cause each of its Subsidiaries to, (a) furnish promptly to Parent a copy
of each report, schedule, registration statement and other document filed by it
during such period pursuant to the requirements of federal or state securities
laws, (b) furnish promptly to Parent all other information concerning its
business, properties and personnel as Parent may reasonably request and (c)
promptly make available to Parent, appropriate personnel of the Company and its
Subsidiaries and the Representatives in connection with such inspections. All
information obtained by Parent pursuant to this Section 6.2 shall be kept
confidential in accordance with the Confidentiality Agreement, dated May 4,
2004, between Parent and the Company.

         Section 6.3 DIRECTORS. Promptly upon acceptance for payment and payment
for any Shares by Sub pursuant to the Offer, Parent shall be entitled, to the
fullest extent permitted by law, to designate at its option up to that number of
directors, rounded to the nearest whole number, of the Board of Directors of the
Company, subject to compliance with Section 14(f) of the Exchange Act and Rule
4350 of the NASD Manual, as will give Parent representation on the Board of
Directors of the Company equal to the product of the total number of directors
on the Board of Directors of the Company (giving effect to the directors
appointed or elected pursuant to this sentence) multiplied by the percentage
that the aggregate number of Shares beneficially owned by Parent or any
affiliate of Parent (including for purposes of this Section 6.3 such Shares as
are accepted for payment and paid for pursuant to the Offer) bears to the number
of Shares then outstanding. In furtherance thereof, concurrently with such
acceptance for payment and payment for such Shares, the Company shall promptly
take all actions necessary to cause Parent's designees to be elected or
appointed to the Board of Directors of the Company in accordance with the terms
of this Section 6.3, including increasing the size of the Board of Directors of
the Company and/or securing the resignations of such number of directors as is
necessary to enable Parent's designees to be elected to the Board of Directors
of the Company in accordance with the terms of this Section 6.3. At such time,
the Company shall also cause, if requested by Parent, (a) each committee of the
Board of Directors of the Company, (b) the board of directors of each of the
Subsidiaries and (c) each committee of such Subsidiaries' board, to include
persons designated by Parent constituting up to the same percentage (rounded up
to the next whole number) of each such committee or board as Parent's designees
constitute on the Board of Directors of the Company. Notwithstanding the
foregoing, in the event that Parent's



                                       40
<PAGE>

designees are appointed or elected to the Board of Directors of the Company,
such Board of Directors shall have until the Effective Time at least three
directors who are directors on the date hereof and who are neither officers of
the Company nor designees, affiliates or associates (within the meaning of the
federal securities laws) of Parent (three or more of such directors, the
"Independent Directors"); provided, however, that in such event, if the number
of Independent Directors shall be reduced below three for any reason whatsoever,
the remaining Independent Director(s) shall designate a person or persons to
fill such vacancy or vacancies, each of whom shall be determined to be and
Independent Director for purposes of this Agreement; provided, further, that if
no Independent Directors remain, the other directors shall designate three
persons to fill the vacancies who shall be neither an officer, designee,
Affiliate or associate (as defined in Rule 12b-2 under the Exchange Act) of the
Company nor an officer, designee, Affiliate or associate of Parent, and such
persons shall be deemed to be Independent Directors for purposes of this
Agreement. Subject to applicable law, the Company shall promptly take all action
necessary to effect any such election or appointment, including mailing to its
stockholders the information required by Section 14(f) of the Exchange Act and
Rule 14f-1 promulgated thereunder, and the Company agrees to make such mailing
with the mailing of the Schedule 14D-9 (provided that Sub shall have provided to
the Company on a timely basis all information required to be included in the
Information Statement with respect to Sub's designees). Parent will supply the
Company any information with respect to itself and its nominees, officers,
directors and affiliates required by Section 14(f) and Rule 14f-1.
Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the contrary, following the time
directors designated by Parent constitute a majority of the Board of Directors
of the Company and prior to the Effective Time, the affirmative vote of a
majority of the Independent Directors shall be required to (i) amend or
terminate this Agreement on behalf of the Company, (ii) exercise or waive any of
the Company's rights or remedies hereunder or (iii) to the extent a decision of
the Company, extend the time for performance of Parent's or Sub's obligations
hereunder, and such affirmative majority vote shall be sufficient to take any
such action.

shall give prompt written notice to the other party of (a) any occurrence, or

         Notwithstanding any other term of the Offer or this Agreement, Sub
shall not be required to accept for payment or, subject to any applicable rules
and regulations of the SEC, including Rule 14e-l(c) under the Exchange Act

otherwise restrict, make more costly or prohibit the making of the Offer or the
consummation of the Offer or the Merger, (ii) result in a material delay in or

all of the Shares pursuant to the Offer or to effect the Merger, (iii) render

materiality or "Material Adverse Effect," shall not be true and correct, as if
such representations and warranties were made at the time of such determination
(except as to any such representation or warranty which speaks as of a specific
date, which must be untrue or incorrect as of such specific date) except where
the failure to be so true and correct, individually or in the aggregate, would
not reasonably be expected to have a Material Adverse Effect;

                  (d) the Company shall have failed to perform in any material
respect any obligation or to comply in any material respect with any obligation,
agreement or covenant of the Company to be performed or complied with by it

Material Adverse Effect on the Company or (B) the effect of making the Offer or
Merger illegal under any applicable law.

         The foregoing conditions are for the sole benefit of Parent or Sub and
(except for the Minimum Condition and the Antitrust Condition) may be waived by
Parent or Sub in whole or in part at any time and from time to time, in their
sole discretion, subject to the terms of this Agreement. The failure by Parent
or Sub at any time to exercise any of the foregoing rights shall not be deemed a
waiver of any such right, the waiver of any such right with respect to
particular facts and circumstances shall not be deemed a waiver with respect to
any other facts and circumstances, and each such right shall be deemed an
ongoing right that may be asserted at any time and from time to time.

meanings assigned to such terms in the Agreement to which it is attached, except
that the term "Agreement" shall be deemed to refer to the Agreement to which
this Exhibit A is attached.
