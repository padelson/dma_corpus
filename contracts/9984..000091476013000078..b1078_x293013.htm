Other Material Circumstances

   
---|--- 
 

  

  

To Seller´s Best Knowledge, since January 1, 2013 there has been no Material

Section 7

  |  

Seller's Liability

   
---|--- 
 

  

  

  

    

(1)

  |  

Damage Claim

   
---|--- 
 

  

  

Subject to the provisions of this Section 7, the Seller shall indemnify the
Purchaser 1, 2 and 3, and the Group Companies from all liabilities, costs and
expenses and other damages recoverable pursuant to Sections 249 et seq. of the
German Civil Code which arises out of any inaccuracy of any Warranty contained
in Section 6; provided that the Purchaser 1, 2 and 3 may at its choice and at
any time, instead of requesting the Seller to remedy the inaccuracy, claim
monetary damages.

  

  

  

    

(2)

  |  

Limitation of Liability

   
---|--- 
 

  

  

The Seller shall not be liable for any inaccuracy of a Warranty pursuant to
Section 7 (1), to the extent that

  

  

  

    

a)

  |  

the relevant matter has been reflected in the Closing Date Financial Schedules
and has been reflected in the calculation of the Final Purchase Price; or

   
---|--- 
 

  

  


 

  

 

 

 

 

  

 

\- 30 -  

  

 

 

 

 

  


 

  

  

    

b)

  |  

the facts resulting in an inaccuracy of the Warranty have been disclosed to
Purchaser 1, 2 and 3 in sufficient clarity in this Agreement and its Exhibits
or in the due diligence documents which Purchaser 1, 2 and 3 have been
provided with a data carrier (DVD) (contents of the data room as of September
18, 2013), which DVD will be kept by the Notary pursuant to Exhibit 7 (2) b);
provided however that the limitation in this Section 7 (2) b) shall not apply
with respect to a disclosure made only in the due diligence documents if the
damage in the individual case exceeds the amount of EUR 500,000. The
disclosure of facts resulting in an inaccuracy of a Warranty which occurred
after signing of this Agreement shall not release the Seller from the
liability under Section 7 (1). Sec. 442 of the German Civil Code shall not
apply. For the avoidance of doubt: the limitation of liability pursuant to
this section 7 (2) b) shall not apply for the Warranties in § 6 (15); or

   
---|--- 
 

  

  

  

    

c)

  |  

Purchaser 1, 2 and 3 or the Group Companies have received payment of the
damage pursuant to a third party indemnity or pursuant to an insurance policy
of the Group Companies, or have a valid claim for payment against such
insurance carrier and such carrier pays after the enforcement of such claim;
Purchasers 1, 2 and 3 agree to use their commercially reasonable efforts to
obtain a full recovery under such policies, provided that any non-refunded
costs of the Purchasers related to any such recovery shall reduce the amount
of the limitation of damages pursuant to Section 7 (2); or.

   
---|--- 
 

  

  

  

    

d)

  |  

the Seller is actually prejudiced by the Purchasers' 1, 2 and 3 failure to
give the Seller notice of a breach of warranty within 90 days of the date that
Purchaser 2's executive officers have actual knowledge of the breach of such
Warranty hereunder.

De Minimis, Threshold, Cap

   
---|--- 
 

  

  

The Purchaser 1, 2 and 3 shall have claims under the Warranties contained in
Section 6 (2) through (14) and (16) through (21) only if the loss exceeds an
amount of EUR 50,000 in each individual case and all losses arising out of any
inaccuracy of the Warranties exceed an aggregate amount of EUR 2,000,000 (in
the latter case only the amount exceeding EUR 2,000,000). The Seller's
aggregate liability for the inaccuracy of the Warranties contained in Section
6 (2) through (14) and (16) through (21) shall be limited to EUR 41,250,000.
For claims of Purchaser 1, 2 and 3 under the Warranties contained in Section 6
(1) and (15) the liability is limited to EUR 275,000,000.

  

  

  

    

(4)

  |  

Time Limitation

   
---|--- 
 

  

  

Any claims of the Purchaser 1, 2 and 3 pursuant to Section 7 (1) shall be
time-barred if not first made prior to the expiration of a period of 18 months
after the Closing Date, except for the Seller's obligation to transfer the
Shares to the Purchaser, free and clear of any encumbrances pursuant to
Section 6 (1) for which a limitation period of ten years after the Closing
Date shall apply. Excluded are the Warranties regarding environmental matters
pursuant to Section 6 (10), which shall be subject to a limitation period of
three years after the Closing Date. Excluded are also the warranties covering
the intellectual property rights pursuant to Section 6 (6) and the product
liability pursuant to Section 6 (16) which shall be subject to a limitation
period of two years after the Closing Date. Excluded are also the warranties
covering Taxes pursuant to section 6 (15) for which the limitation provision

Third Party Claims

   
---|--- 
 

  

  

  

    

a)

  |  

If any third party asserts a claim against the Group Companies which may
result in any liability of the Seller for the inaccuracy of any Warranty, the
Purchaser 1, 2 and 3 shall within 10 Business Days of receipt of such claim
notify the Seller thereof and grant the Seller the opportunity to reasonably
participate in the defense at its own cost, provided, that, failure to give
such notice shall not release the Seller from its obligations hereunder to the
extent the interests of the Seller have not been prejudiced by such failure,
i. e, the Seller shall be released from liability insofar as the lack of the
opportunity to defend the claim led to damages of the Seller caused by the
delay. In no event shall the Purchaser 1, 2 and 3 permit such third party
claim to be acknowledged or settled without the Seller's prior consent
(provided, however, that any such consent to a settlement may not be
unreasonably withheld or delayed). The Purchaser 1, 2 and 3 will, upon request
and as soon as reasonably practicable, provide to the Seller and its
representatives all documents and information and grant them access to the
management and employees of the Group Companies, to the extent reasonably
required by the Seller in order to make use of its rights under this Section 7
(5) which access shall not limit any of the Purchasers' 1, 2 and 3 rights or
privileges.

   
---|--- 
 

  

  

  

    

b)

  |  

Seller shall be entitled to, at its own costs and after written notification
to Purchasers 1, 2 and 3, to take over the conduct of a dispute with the owner
of a third party claim, if

   
---|--- 
 

  

  

    

  |  

(i)

  |  

Seller confirms towards Purchasers 1, 2 and 3 to pay unlimited damages for
this claim and

   
---|---|--- 
 

  

  

    

  |  

(ii)

  |  

Seller provides security for the anticipated costs (including settlement
costs) presumably arising in connection with the conduct of the dispute. In
case Seller takes over the conduct of the dispute, it shall be obliged to
carry on the case diligently and in proper from and to engage attorneys which
Purchasers 1, 2 and 3 could reasonably be expected to accept.

   
---|---|--- 
 

  

  

In case Seller takes over the defence against a third party claim pursuant to
the terms of this Agreement, Seller shall obtain Purchasers' 1, 2 and 3
written consent prior to any agreement of settlement with the owner of the
third party claim, unless Seller deposits, together with the settlement
agreement, the amount payable to the owner of the third party claim on a bank
account of the court and under the condition that such settlement does not
cause additional obligations of, or material disadvantages to, Purchasers 1, 2
and 3 or the Group Companies and contains a complete release of Purchasers 1,
2 and 3 and the Group Companies. Purchasers 1, 2 and 3 shall be entitled to
participate, at its own costs, in the dispute using its own legal counsels.
Purchasers 1, 2 and 3 are entitled to take over, at its own costs, the conduct
of the dispute by written notice to the Seller any time. In the case that a
Purchaser takes over any such case, other than as a result of Seller's failure
to take over such case in the first instance and provided Seller is not in
breach of this Section 7(5) b), , the Seller shall be released from its
respective liability.

  

  

  

    

c)

  |  

Fort the avoidance of doubt: Section 7 (5) shall not apply for claims
regarding the Warranties in Section 6 (15), for which only section 11 shall
apply.

   
---|--- 
 

  

  

  

    

(6)

  |  

Exclusion of other Remedies

   
---|--- 
 

  

  

The Purchaser 1, 2 and 3 rights arising out of any inaccuracy of the
Warranties contained in Section 6 shall be exclusively governed by this
Section 7; with respect to Taxes Section 11 remains unaffected. Any claims of
the Purchaser 1, 2 and 3 under the statutory representations and warranties
(Secs. 434 et seq. of the German Civil Code), claims of the Parties arising
out of a breach of any pre-contractual obligations (Sec. 311 (2) of the German
Civil Code) or contractual ancillary obligations not contained in this
Agreement and claims for frustration of contract (Sec. 313 of the German Civil
Code) are hereby excluded. In no event shall either Party be entitled to
terminate or otherwise withdraw from this Agreement, except for the
termination rights set forth in Section 13 and any statutory rights in the
event of a breach of the obligation to effect the Closing in accordance with
Section 5 (6). Any claims for fraud or willful misconduct shall remain
unaffected by this Section 7 (6).

§ 21 Instructions

  


 

  

The notary has in particular given instructions on the following issues:

  


 

  

    

\-

  |  

All agreements must be correctly and completely recorded; all stipulations
which are not recorded are potentially void and may put at risk the validity
of the entire agreement.

   
---|--- 
 

  


 

  

    

\-

  |  

All parties shall bear the costs of the notary without respect to the
agreements between the parties.

   
---|--- 
 

  


 

  

    

\-

  |  

The transfer of shares shall only be valid if all consents required by law and
the Articles of Association have been validly granted. Such consents shall be
obtained by the parties themselves.

   
---|--- 
 

  


 

  

    

\-

  |  

The Company may treat only such person as shareholder who is listed in the
shareholders' list registered with the commercial register.

   
---|--- 
 

  


 

  

    

\-

  |  

The law normally provides for a bona-fide-acquisition only, if the Seller is
listed in the shareholders' list registered with the commercial register, such
list has not been objected to for at least three years and the purchaser is
not in bad faith.

   
---|--- 
 

  


 

  

    

\-

  |  

The division of a share requires consent of the shareholders' meeting.

   
---|--- 
 

  


 

  

    

\-

  |  

With respect to the new shareholdings an amendment of the Articles of
Association may be appropriate.

   
---|--- 
 

  


 

  

    

\-

  |  

In the event of the consolidation or transfer of at least 95% of the shares of
the company in the hands of the purchaser or companies affiliated with him,
real property acquisition tax may be levied.

   
---|--- 
 

  


 

  

    

  |  

The notary does not advise on tax matters.

   
---|--- 
 

  


 

   
 

 

 

 

  

   

  

 

 

 

   
 


 

  

    

\-

  |  

If a company is dependent on another enterprise in accordance with Sections 16
and following German Stock Corporation Act (e.g. majority of shares or votes)
this has to be revealed to the concerned company and their shareholders.
Otherwise there might be claims to omission, compensation or withdrawal of
shares against the controlling enterprise. If a stock corporation is involved
there are further information obligations and sanctions in accordance with
Sections 20, 21 German Stock Corporation Act. Any necessary steps will be
arranged for by the parties themselves.

   
---|--- 
 

  


 

  

    

\-

  |  

Today's transfer of shares does not affect any intercompany agreements
(management control agreements or profit transfer agreements). Any necessary
steps will be arranged for by the parties themselves.

   
---|--- 
 

  


 

  

    

\-

  |  

The notary pointed out that he has no knowledge of foreign law, in particular
not foreign company law.

   
---|--- 
 

  


 

  

    

\-

  |  

The formation of companies and acquisition of interests in companies through
foreigners must be reported according to the External Trade Act and the
External Trade Regulation. More information can be obtained from the German
Federal Bank.

   
---|--- 
 

  


 

  

    

\-

  |  

Furthermore the notary pointed out that the corporate body that grants power
of attorney must also be released from the restrictions of Section 181 German
Civil Code and appropriate restrictions of any other applicable law. The
parties declare that these requirements are fulfilled.

   
---|--- 
 

  


 

  

    

\-

  |  

The permissibility and limits of the representation of foreign companies are
governed by the foreign law applicable to such companies of which the notary
has no knowledge.

   
---|---
