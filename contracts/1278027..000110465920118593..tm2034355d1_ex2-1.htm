ARTICLE III _ 
 CONSIDERATION_

  



  

Section 3.1 _Purchase Price_.

  



  

(a) In consideration of the purchase by Buyer of the Purchased
Assets, Buyer shall, in addition to Buyer's assumption of the
Assumed Liabilities, pay to Seller an aggregate amount (the " _Purchase
Price_ ") equal to (i) Five Hundred Fifty Million Dollars ($550,000,000) and
(ii) plus the amount, if any, by which the Closing Inventory exceeds the
Inventory Target, or minus the amount, if any, by which the Closing Inventory
is less than the Inventory Target.

  



  

(b) On the fifth (5th) Business Day before the anticipated Closing
Date, Seller shall estimate in good faith the amount of the Closing Inventory
and deliver to Buyer a certificate (the " _Closing Certificate_ ") setting
forth such estimates and the calculation of the Estimated Purchase Price. The
Closing Certificate shall be consistent with, and be prepared using, the
Accounting Policies and shall include reasonable supporting detail as to each
of the calculations contained therein. Prior to the Closing Date, and without
limitation of the provisions of Section 7.4, at Buyer's reasonable request,
Seller shall provide Buyer and its Representatives any information reasonably
requested and shall provide them access at all reasonable times to the
personnel, properties, books and records, in each case only during normal
business hours, relating exclusively to the Business, in each case for the
purpose of reviewing the Closing Certificate. Buyer and Seller shall
reasonably cooperate and act in good faith to resolve any disputes they may
have in respect of the Estimated Purchase Price and the Closing Certificate;
provided that in the event Buyer and Seller are unable to resolve any such
dispute prior to Closing, for purposes of paying the Estimated Purchase Price
at Closing, the Closing Certificate delivered by the Seller shall govern. As
used herein, " _Estimated Closing Inventory_ " means the estimate of the
Closing Inventory set forth in the Closing Certificate, and " _Estimated
Purchase Price_ " means an amount equal to the Purchase Price calculated as
set forth in _Section 3.1(a)_, assuming for purposes of such calculation at
the Closing that the Closing Inventory is equal to the Estimated Closing
Inventory. Subject to the terms and conditions of this Agreement, at the
Closing, Buyer shall pay and deliver the Estimated Purchase Price (as
calculated based upon the Closing Certificate) to Seller by means of a wire
transfer of immediately available cash funds to an account as directed by
Seller in writing prior to the Closing.

  



  

Section 3.2 _Post-Closing Adjustment to the Purchase Price_.

  



  

(a) Within sixty (60) days after the Closing Date, Seller shall
deliver to Buyer a certificate (the " _Preliminary Adjustment Statement_
") setting forth Seller's calculation of the Closing Inventory and the
Purchase Price, and the adjustment necessary to reconcile the Estimated
Purchase Price to the Purchase Price (the " _Post-Closing Adjustment_ "). The
Preliminary Adjustment Statement shall be consistent with, and be prepared
using, the Accounting Policies and shall include reasonable supporting
detail as to each of the calculations contained therein. Buyer shall
reasonably cooperate with Seller and its Representatives in
Seller's preparation of the Preliminary Adjustment Statement and the Post-
Closing Adjustment and, without limiting the generality of the foregoing,
shall provide Seller with reasonable access to the books and records and
necessary personnel of the Business to be made available during normal
business hours to Seller and its Representatives in such preparation.

  



  

   

20

 



    



  

(b) During the fifteen (15) days immediately following Buyer's
receipt of the Preliminary Adjustment Statement, Seller shall provide Buyer
with reasonable access to all books and records and all financial information
relevant to the preparation of the Preliminary Adjustment Statement and the
calculation of the Post-Closing Adjustment that are under control of or in the
possession of Seller (or its Representatives and advisors), including
Seller's working papers relating to same. If Buyer does not deliver to Seller
a written notice objecting to the Preliminary Adjustment Statement and the
Post-Closing Adjustment (a " _Notice of Objections_ "), within fifteen (15)
days after receipt of same, then the Preliminary Adjustment Statement and the
Post-Closing Adjustment as calculated by Seller (including the Closing
Inventory set forth therein) shall be deemed final and binding upon the
parties.

    



  

(c) If Buyer timely delivers a Notice of Objections to Seller,
then the parties shall meet and exchange information in a good faith
attempt to agree upon the calculation of the Purchase Price and the Post-
Closing Adjustment. If Seller and Buyer have not come to an agreement within
thirty (30) days following the delivery of the Notice of Objections, the
parties will engage and submit such calculations to final and binding
arbitration by PricewaterhouseCoopers or if such firm is unable or unwilling
to act, such other nationally recognized, independent public accounting firm
mutually agreed upon by Seller and Buyer in writing (the " _Independent
Accountant_ "), which determination of the Purchase Price and the Post-
Closing Adjustment shall be conclusive for all purposes and binding upon the
parties and upon which a judgment may be rendered by a court having proper
jurisdiction over the party against which such determination is to be
enforced. Buyer and Seller shall have the opportunity to present their
positions with respect to such disputed matters to the Independent Accountant
in accordance with this _Section 3.2_. The Independent Accountant shall: (i)
render its decision in writing based on and consistent with and using the
Accounting Policies, and (ii) rule only upon the objections raised in the
Notice of Objections which shall not have been resolved by the parties prior
to such submission and adopt a position that is either equal to Seller's
proposed position, equal to Buyer's proposed position or between the positions
proposed by Seller and Buyer, and accepting all other aspects of the
calculations which are not in dispute. Seller and Buyer shall request that
the Independent Accountant deliver its written decision setting forth such
calculation and the basis therefor as promptly as practicable and in any
event within thirty (30) days following its retention, solely in accordance
with the terms and provisions of this Agreement. The costs, fees and expenses
of the Independent Accountant pursuant to this _Section 3.2_ (including any
retainer and reasonable attorney fees) shall be apportioned between Seller and
Buyer based upon inverse proportion of the disputed amounts resolved in favor
of such party (i.e., so that the prevailing party bears a lesser amount of
such costs, fees and expenses) as determined by the Independent Accountant
and set forth in the written decision of the Independent Accountant; provided,
that, initially, any retainer charged by the Independent Accountant shall be
borne equally by Seller and Buyer. Other than the fees and expenses referred
to in the immediately preceding sentence, the fees and disbursements of
Seller's accountants shall be borne by Seller and the fees and disbursements
of Buyer's accountants shall be borne by Buyer.

  



  

(d) If the Purchase Price (as finally determined pursuant to
_Section 3.2_) is less than the Estimated Purchase Price, then Seller shall
pay to Buyer an amount equal to the Post-Closing Adjustment. If the Purchase
Price (as finally determined pursuant to _Section 3.2_) is greater than the
Estimated Purchase Price, then Buyer shall pay to Seller an amount equal to
the Post-Closing Adjustment. All payments by Seller or Buyer under this
_Section 3.2(d)_ shall be made within five (5) Business Days of the final
determination of the Purchase Price and the Post-Closing Adjustment pursuant
to _Section 3.2_ by wire transfer of immediately available funds. For Tax
purposes, any payment by Buyer or Seller under this Agreement, including
pursuant to _Article VIII_, shall be treated as an adjustment to the
Purchase Price unless a contrary treatment is required by Law.

  



  

   

21

 



    



  

Section 3.3 _Allocation of Purchase Price_. The Purchase Price
and Assumed Liabilities shall be separately allocated for Tax purposes among
the Foreign Purchased Assets and the U.S. Purchased Assets as of the
Effective Time. Buyer shall prepare and deliver to Seller for review
an allocation schedule setting forth Buyer's determination of such allocation
(the " _Allocation Schedule_ ") within sixty (60) days after the Purchase
Price is finally determined pursuant to _Section 3.2_, which Allocation
Schedule, to the extent it related to the U.S. Purchased Assets, shall be in
accordance with Section 1060 of the Code. Within thirty (30) days after
receipt of such Allocation Schedule, Seller will notify Buyer in writing of
any changes it proposes to the Allocation Schedule. Buyer and Seller will
endeavor in good faith to resolve any differences between them with respect to
the Allocation Schedule within thirty (30) days after Buyer's receipt of
written notice given by Seller pursuant to the preceding sentence and,
if they are able to do so, the Allocation Schedule shall become final;
provided, however, that in the event there are any adjustments to the
Purchase Price pursuant to this Agreement, Buyer and Seller shall agree upon a
revision to the Allocation Schedule that reflects the proportionate change
amongst those classes of assets (or assets that correspond to the Assumed
Liabilities), including goodwill, that caused the adjustment to the Purchase
Price. If Buyer and Seller are unable to resolve any dispute with respect to
the Allocation Schedule within thirty (30) days, then within ten (10) days of
the election of either the Seller or Buyer, such dispute shall be resolved by
the Independent Accountant in accordance with Section 3.2. Buyer and Seller
agree to file Internal Revenue Service (" _IRS_ ") Form(s) 8594 and all Tax
Returns in accordance with the Allocation Schedule, as adjusted pursuant to
the preceding sentence, and neither of them shall thereafter take a Tax
position on any Tax Return or otherwise that is inconsistent with such
allocation unless required to do so pursuant to an audit or other inquiry or
examination by the IRS or other Governmental Authority. Should a disagreement
arise with the IRS or other Governmental Authority with respect to
the agreed-upon allocation among the Purchased Assets, any party may
negotiate a change to such allocation that is inconsistent with the
Allocation Schedule if necessary to settle an examination dispute with the IRS
or other Governmental Authority, which shall be deemed to be done for
settlement purposes only, so as to not impact the other party's Tax Return
positions.

  



  

Section 3.4 _Withholding_. Notwithstanding any other provision
of this Agreement, and for the avoidance of doubt, (a) each payment made
pursuant to this Agreement shall be made net of any Taxes required by
applicable Law to be deducted or withheld from such payment and (b)
any amounts deducted or withheld from any such payment shall be remitted to
the applicable taxing authority and shall be treated for all purposes of this
Agreement as having been paid; _provided_ , _however_ , that prior to any such
withholding the withholding party will provide reasonable advance written
notice to the party in which payment is being withheld from and all parties
hereto will use commercially reasonable efforts to limit any required
withholding obligation.

  



  

   

22

 



    



  

Section 3.5 _Retained Technology License_. At the Closing,
Seller will execute and deliver an irrevocable, worldwide, royalty-free, non-
exclusive license agreement (in the form attached hereto as _Exhibit F_) to
Buyer with respect to any trade secrets owned or controlled by Seller or any
Affiliate that are actually used in connection with and reasonably necessary
for the operation or conduct of the Business on the Closing Date and that are
not included in the Acquired Intellectual Property (the " _Retained
Technology License "_).

actually occurs is referred to herein as the " _Closing Date_ ". The
transfers and deliveries described in this _ARTICLE VI_ shall be mutually

mutual agreement of the parties, the Closing may take place by conference
call and electronic (i.e., email/PDF) delivery. To the extent permitted by
Law and GAAP, for Tax and accounting purposes, the parties will treat the
Closing as being effective as of the Effective Time.

ARTICLE VII _ 
 COVENANTS_

  



  

Section 7.1 _Pre-Closing Covenants and Agreements_.

  



  

(a) During the period between the date of this Agreement until the
earlier to occur of the termination of this Agreement in accordance with 
_Section 7.1(f)_ or the Closing (the " _Pre-Closing Period_ "), except as
otherwise expressly provided for in this Agreement or the Disclosure
Schedules hereto, or except to the extent Buyer otherwise consents in writing
(which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld or delayed), Seller shall
(i) operate the Business and the Real Estate Subsidiaries in the ordinary
course of business, consistent with past practice, and, in any event, in
compliance with all applicable Laws, and (ii) use commercially reasonable
efforts to maintain and preserve relationships and goodwill with customers,
suppliers, licensees, creditors, Representatives, employees and others having
business dealings with the Business. Without limiting the generality of the
foregoing, during the Pre-Closing Period, without the prior written consent of
Buyer, which consent will not be unreasonably withheld or delayed, neither
Seller nor any of its Affiliates (including the Real Estate Subsidiaries)
shall take, or agree (whether in writing or otherwise) to take, any action
that would result in a breach of the representations and warranties in
_Section 4.4_ hereof if such action was taken from May 1, 2020 through the
date of this Agreement.

  



  

(b) During the Pre-Closing Period, the Seller shall provide, or shall
cause its Affiliates to provide, Buyer and its Representatives
with reasonable access during normal business hours to the personnel,
facilities, counsel, accountants, consultants, representatives, non-income
Tax Returns (to the extent relating solely to the Business), Assumed
Contracts, Real Estate Subsidiaries, Information Technology and books and
records (in compliance with applicable privacy Laws and subject to the
Confidentiality Agreement and the covenants set forth herein) of the
Business, including product cost sheets, price lists and product lists by SKU
and location to conduct such inspections as Buyer may reasonably request;
_provided_ , _however_ , that such access shall not permit
any Representatives of Buyer to conduct any environmental testing or sampling
prior to the Closing without the prior written consent of Seller (such
consent not to be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed). Any
inspection pursuant to this _Section 7.1(b)_ will be conducted in such a
manner so as not to interfere unreasonably with the conduct of the Business,
and in no event will any provision hereof be interpreted to require Seller to
permit any inspection or to disclose any information that Seller reasonably
determines may violate any Law, any of its obligations with respect to
confidentiality or that would result in the loss of an attorney-client or
work product privilege; _provided_ , _however_ , that if any information is so
restricted or withheld, Seller shall inform Buyer as to the general nature of
what is being restricted or withheld and use commercially reasonable efforts
to take those actions reasonably necessary so that Seller is able to provide
such information to Buyer and upon the Buyer's execution of a common interest
agreement or similar arrangement on terms mutually agreeable to the Buyer and
Seller, such information shall be provided to the Buyer. Buyer and its
Representatives will not contact any of the employees, customers or suppliers
of the Business without the prior written consent of Seller (not to be
unreasonably withheld), it being acknowledged that any and all such
contacts will be arranged by Seller and that Buyer and Seller will mutually
agree on the timing and manner of contact with all employees, customers or
suppliers.

(c) During the Pre-Closing Period, Seller and Buyer will cooperate in
good faith to (i) test the Information Technology included in the Purchased
Assets and prepare it for transition to the Buyer; and (ii) review, revise and
update, where appropriate, the schedules to the Transition Services
Agreement. Seller will provide, or cause it Affiliates to provide to, Buyer
with such access to facilities and Information Technology included in the
Purchased Assets as is reasonably necessary to allow Buyer to prepare for
separation and operation of the Business on the Closing Date.

  



  

(d) During the Pre-Closing Period, Seller shall (i) use commercially
reasonable efforts to obtain estoppel certificates from the parties to the
agreements set forth on Schedule 7.1(d) in form and substance reasonably
acceptable to Buyer; (ii) other than Permitted Encumbrances, prepare releases
of any deed of trust, mortgages or other security instruments encumbering the
Owned Real Property, in recordable form, if any; and (iii) cooperate with and
assist Buyer in good faith to enable Buyer to obtain, at its sole cost and
expense, from a nationally recognized title insurance company (the " _Title
Company_ ") reasonably satisfactory to Buyer, a fee owner's title insurance
policy with respect to the Owned Real Property, together with
endorsements reasonably requested by Buyer, insuring that the applicable Real
Estate Subsidiary has fee simple title to the Owned Real Property as of
Closing, subject only to Permitted Encumbrances. Without limiting the
forgoing, Seller shall deliver to the Title Company customary affidavits,
indemnities, or other items reasonably requested by the Title Company in
connection with the delivery of such owner's title insurance policy
(collectively, the " _Title Company Documents_ ").

  



  

(e) During the Pre-Closing Period and subject to the terms and
conditions of this Agreement, Seller and Buyer will use commercially
reasonable efforts to take or cause to be taken all actions and to do or
cause to be done all things necessary under the terms of this Agreement or
under applicable Laws to cause the satisfaction of the conditions set forth in
_ARTICLE VI_ and to consummate the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement, including using their respective commercially reasonable efforts to
obtain all authorizations, consents, Permits, waivers or other approvals of
all Governmental Authorities that may be or become necessary for the
performance of its obligations pursuant to this Agreement or consents of
third parties under Assumed Contracts or Permits required for
the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, and the parties shall
reasonably cooperate with each other with respect to each of the foregoing.

  



  

   

 | 51| 
---|---|--- 

 



    

  



   | (f)| This Agreement may be terminated: 
---|---|--- 
  



  

(i) by mutual written consent of Buyer and Seller at any time
prior to the Closing;

  



  

(ii) by Buyer or Seller, upon written notice to the other party,
if a Governmental Authority of competent jurisdiction has issued an
Order permanently enjoining or otherwise prohibiting the consummation of the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement, and such Order has become final
and non-appealable; provided, however, that the right to terminate this
Agreement pursuant to this _Section 7.1(f)(ii)_ shall not be available to
any party whose breach of any provision of this Agreement results in or causes
such Order;

  



  

(iii) by (A) Buyer if it is not then in breach of its obligations
under this Agreement and (I) there is a violation or breach of any of the
representations, warranties, covenants or agreements of Seller set forth in
this Agreement or (II) any of the representations or warranties of Seller
shall have become untrue, in either case such that the conditions set forth in
_Section 6.2_ would not be satisfied and, in either case, such breach,
violation or inaccuracy is not waived or, in the case of a breach of
any covenant or agreement under this Agreement that is curable, is not cured
by Seller prior to the earlier to occur of (x) within twenty (20) days after
being notified of same and (y) the Outside Date; or (B) Seller if it is not
then in breach of its obligations under this Agreement and (I) there is a
violation or breach of any of the representations, warranties, covenants or
agreements of Buyer set forth in this Agreement or (II) any of the
representations or warranties of Buyer shall have become untrue, in either
case such that the conditions set forth in _Section 6.3_ would not be
satisfied and, in either case, such breach, violation or inaccuracy is not
waived or, in the case of a breach of any covenant or agreement under this
Agreement that is curable, is not cured by Buyer prior to the earlier to
occur of (x) within twenty (20) days after being notified of the same and (y)
the Outside Date; or

  



  

(iv) by Buyer or Seller, if the Closing has not occurred (other
than through the failure of any party seeking to terminate this Agreement to
comply fully with its obligations under this Agreement) on or before the date
that is seventy-five (75) days following the date of this Agreement (the "
_Outside Date_ ").

  



  

If this Agreement is terminated pursuant to this _Section 7.1(f)_, then all
provisions of this Agreement shall thereupon become void without any liability
on the part of any party hereto to any other party hereto except that (x)
this _Section 7.1(f)_ and _Sections 7.5_ , _7.6(a)_ , and _ARTICLE IX_
shall survive any such termination and (y) nothing herein shall relieve any
party to this Agreement from any liability resulting from or arising out of
any breach of any agreement or covenant in this Agreement.

  



  

   

 | 52| 
---|---|--- 

 



    



  

(g) (i) During the Pre-Closing Period, any public disclosures or
announcements relating to this Agreement or the transactions contemplated
hereby and (ii) on and after the Closing, any public disclosures made in
connection with the announcement of the transactions contemplated herein and
the closing of such, will, in each case, be made only as may be agreed upon in
writing by Seller and Buyer (each such Person's agreement not to be
unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed), except as may be required by
Law or by any Governmental Authority or the rules of any stock exchange or
trading system; provided that the party required to make the public
disclosure or announcement shall, to the extent practicable, use commercially
reasonable efforts to allow the other party reasonable time to comment on
such disclosure or announcement in advance of such issuance. Seller
acknowledges that Buyer's Affiliates may be required to disclose the material
terms of this Agreement in, and file a copy of this Agreement as an attachment
to, a Current Report on Form 8-K and subsequent reports and other documents
filed with the Securities Exchange Commission.

  



  

Section 7.2 _Further Assurances; Misdirected Payments_. From time
to time after the Closing Date, without further consideration, Seller will,
and will cause its Affiliates to, execute and deliver, or cause to be
executed and delivered, such documents to Buyer and take such other action as
Buyer may reasonably request in order to vest in Buyer good title to the
Purchased Assets and to otherwise evidence consummation of the transaction
contemplated herein, including transferring to Buyer any asset contemplated by
this Agreement to be transferred to Buyer and which was not so transferred at
the Closing and for purposes of being reasonably cooperative with the Buyer
Indemnitees with respect to any RandW Proceedings. From time to time after the
Closing Date, without further consideration, Buyer will execute and deliver
or cause to be executed and delivered such documents to Seller and take such
other action as Seller may reasonably request in order to more effectively
evidence the consummation of the transaction contemplated herein. Buyer
has no intent to exploit the Foreign Purchased Assets in the United States
after Closing.

  



  

   

 | 53| 
---|---|--- 

 



    



  

Section 7.3 _Employees_.

  



  

(a) Effective on the Closing Date, Buyer shall offer employment to all
Business Employees at the same work location (or, for Business
Employees whose work location immediately prior to the Closing was the
corporate headquarters of Seller or otherwise, then at a work location within
the Northeast Ohio geographic region or where such employee worked), (i) for
Business Employees who are covered by the Union Contract, in compliance with
the terms and conditions of the Union Contract and (ii) for Business Employees
who are not covered by the Union Contract, (A) at the same salary or wages as
provided by Seller immediately prior to the Closing Date and (B) with
medical, dental, vision, life insurance, disability and 401(k) benefits (the "
_Covered Benefits_ ") that are substantially comparable in the aggregate as
provided by Seller immediately prior to the Closing Date and (C)
with incentive compensation opportunities that are substantially comparable
in the aggregate as provided by Buyer to similarly situated employees of
Buyer. Notwithstanding the foregoing, in respect of Business Employees on
disability leave or other approved leave of absence (other than vacation) as
of the Closing Date, the offers of employment to be made by Buyer pursuant
hereto shall not be made as of the Closing Date but as otherwise provided
below. If, within six (6) months of the Closing Date, such Business Employee
on disability leave or other approved leave of absence notifies Buyer that he
or she is capable of returning to work (and, if applicable is cleared for
return to work), then Buyer shall offer such Business Employee employment
pursuant to the terms above and the effective date of such Business
Employee's employment with Buyer will not be as of the Closing Date, but
rather the date on which such employee returns to work with Buyer (the "
_Delayed Hire Date_ "). If such Business Employee on disability leave or
other approved leave of absence does not make such notification to Buyer (or,
if applicable, is not cleared for work) within six (6) months after the
Closing Date, Buyer shall not be obligated to offer employment to such
Business Employee and such individual shall not be treated as a Business
Employee for any purpose under this Agreement. Seller makes no representation
as to whether such employees will accept employment with Buyer. In addition,
Buyer agrees that in connection with its employment of Business Employees,
Buyer shall: (i) for the twelve (12) month period following the Closing Date,
provide each such Business Employee with: (A) salary or wages which are no
less than the salary or wages provided by Seller immediately prior to the
Closing (and, in the case of Business Employees who are covered by the Union
Contract, in compliance with the terms and conditions of the Union Contract);
and (B)(x) in the case of Business Employees who are not covered by the Union
Contract, Covered Benefits that are substantially comparable in the aggregate
as provided by Seller immediately prior to the Closing Date and incentive
compensation opportunities that are substantially comparable in the aggregate
as provided by Buyer to similarly situated employees of Buyer, and (y) in the
case of Business Employees who are covered by the Union Contract, incentive
opportunities and employee benefits as required by the terms and conditions
of the Union Contract); (ii) for the twelve (12) month period following the
Closing Date, provide each such Business Employee with severance benefits that
are no less favorable than the severance amounts payable under the practice,
plan or policy in effect for such Business Employees immediately prior to the
Closing and disclosed on Schedule 7.3(a) (in the case of Business Employees
who are not covered by the Union Contract) or as required by the terms of the
Union Contract (in the case of Business Employees who are covered by the Union
Contract); (iii) give full credit for years of service with Seller, its
Affiliates or predecessors for purposes of eligibility and vesting under
Buyer's employee benefit plans, programs and arrangements (but not for
purposes of equity incentive plans or benefit accruals under any
defined benefit plan); (iv) waive any waiting periods for participation,
coverage or benefits; (v) waive any exclusions for benefits for pre-existing
conditions; and (vi) with respect to Buyer's group health plans, use
commercially reasonable efforts to provide credit for co-payments and
deductibles made by Business Employees under Seller's group health plans.
Buyer agrees to honor the 2020 merit increase in salary for all salaried
Business Employees effective January 4, 2021 as communicated to all such
employees in June 2020\. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary herein, to
the extent that a Business Employee is entitled under applicable Law, the
Union Contract, or any policy of Seller to be paid for any vacation days
accrued or earned but not yet taken by such Business Employee as of the
Closing Date, Seller shall discharge the Liability for such vacation days.
The parties shall cooperate reasonably and in good faith following the date
of this Agreement and prior to the Closing Date to agree to the terms of a
customary trust-to-trust transfer of account balances (including notes or
similar instruments reflecting participant loans) from Seller's 401(k) plan
to Buyer's 401(k) plan or similar defined contribution retirement plan
pursuant to Section 414(l) of the Code; _provided_ that, in the event that
the parties are unable to so agree, then, if necessary, Buyer shall amend its
401(k) plan or similar defined contribution retirement plan to ensure that it
will accept direct rollovers of eligible rollover distributions (and notes or
similar instruments reflecting participant loans) from the Seller Plans. Any
Business Employees who become employees of Buyer on the Closing Date shall
cease participation in the employee benefit plans maintained or contributed
to by Seller or any Affiliate of Seller, including the Seller Plans, in each
case effective as of the later of the Closing Date or as otherwise provided
under the terms of such employee benefit plan.

  



  

   

 | 54| 
---|---|--- 

 



    

  



  

(b) Seller shall take all steps necessary to provide that, immediately
prior to the Closing Date (but conditioned thereon), each Business Employee
shall become fully vested in each of the following: (i) any unvested matching
contributions and any other employer contributions under Seller's 401(k)
plan; (ii) the shares of unvested restricted stock of Seller held by any
of the Business Employees with respect to grants made in the 2017 and 2018
calendar years; (iii) with respect to any grants of performance units made to
Business Employees during the 2019 calendar year, the pro-rated number of
performance units which become  "Vesting Eligible Units" (based on actual
performance) calculated in accordance with Section 3(b) of such Business
Employee's 2019 Performance Units Agreement (and for the avoidance of doubt,
all grants other than the 2017, 2018, and pro-rated 2019 grants specified in
(ii) and (iii) of this Section 7.3(b) will be forfeited), (iv) any accrued
benefits under each of the Pension Plans and (v) with respect to any Business
Employee who would have vested in their accrued benefit under the Health
Retirement Account on or prior to (A) the second anniversary of the Closing
Date (in the case of Business Employees who are not covered by the Union
Contract) or (B) April 30, 2023, which is the expiration date of the Union
Contract (in the case of Business Employees who are covered by the Union
Contract), in each case, their accrued benefit under the Health Retirement
Account.

  



  

(c) Seller shall pay to the Business Employees (i) holiday bonuses for
the Business Employees for 2020 and (ii) a pro-rated portion of the aggregate
amount due with respect to short-term cash incentive compensation in respect
of the Business's target performance as of the Closing Date in relation to
Seller's 2021 fiscal year, determined based on the number of completed months
in Seller's 2021 fiscal year as of the Closing Date. For the avoidance of
doubt, Buyer will be responsible for delivering to all Business Employees the
remaining pro-rated targeted amount due with respect to short-term cash
incentive compensation in respect of the Business for the period beginning on
the Closing Date and ending April 30, 2021 (provided that if any such Business
Employee terminates employment with Buyer and its Affiliates prior to April
30, 2021, the remaining pro-rated targeted amount shall be calculated based
on the number of full calendar months elapsed between the Closing Date and the
date such Business Employee's employment is terminated and provided further,
that if any Business Employee's employment is terminated for cause prior to
the payment date, such Business Employee shall not be entitled to any payment
under this sentence). In the event that the Closing Date occurs after April
30, 2021, Seller will provide incentive payouts to the Business Employees
consistent with past business practice (i.e. paid in June based on actual
business results); however, Seller will not be responsible to make any
payments with respect to any short-term cash incentive compensation in
respect of the Business for Seller's 2022 fiscal year.

  



  

(d) Buyer shall, or shall cause an Affiliate to, provide COBRA
coverage to all Business Employees and their qualified beneficiaries who
incur a "qualifying event" in accordance with COBRA after the Closing Date.
Seller shall bear and be responsible for all liabilities and obligations
under COBRA for any of the Business Employees who do not accept and commence
employment with Buyer and any former employee whose services relate to the
Business or dependent of any Business Employee or former employee whose
"qualifying event" occurs on or prior to the Closing Date.

  



  

   

 | 55| 
---|---|--- 

 



    



  

(e) Notwithstanding any other provision of this Agreement, the parties
specifically agree that Seller shall bear no responsibility for any
penalty, fine or other amount payable which arises out of or results from the
violation of any applicable Laws (including any alleged or actual violations
of the Worker Adjustment and Retraining Notification Act, 29 U.S.C. § 2101 et
seq.) (the " _WARN Act_ ") relating to the actions of Buyer following the
Closing, which liability Buyer expressly retains. Buyer covenants that it
does not currently plan or contemplate any plant closings relating to the
Business or reductions in force or terminations of employees of the Business
that, in the aggregate, would trigger the WARN Act or any other similar Law,
rule, or regulation of any Governmental Authority.

  



  

(f) Nothing contained herein, express or implied, (i) is intended to
confer upon any Business Employee any right to continued employment for any
period, (ii) shall constitute an amendment to or any other modification of any
employee benefit plan or any program, policy or arrangement of Seller or
their Affiliates, or (iii) shall create any third party beneficiary rights in
any current or former employee of Seller or any of its Affiliates or any
beneficiary or dependent thereof.

  



  

(g) Prior to the Closing, Seller or its Affiliates shall provide any
union representing any Business Employees with all required notices relating
to the transactions contemplated by this Agreement in accordance with the
terms of any applicable collective bargaining agreement(s) and applicable
Law, and shall comply with and discharge all of its bargaining obligations
with respect to such union(s) relating to such transactions.

  



  

Section 7.4 _Access to Information_. Except in connection with any
dispute between the parties, following the Closing, upon reasonable advance
written notice to a party, each such party will, for any reasonable business
purpose, afford to the other party and its Representatives reasonable access
to the books and records relating to the Business that are acquired or
retained by the other party and exclusively relate to the pre-Closing
activities of the Business which access will be granted during normal business
hours; provided, however, that such access does not unreasonably disrupt the
normal operations of the party providing such access. Notwithstanding
anything contained in this _Section 7.4_, no party shall be required to
breach any duty of confidentiality owed to any person whether such duty
arises contractually, statutorily or otherwise.

Section 7.5 _Restrictive Covenants_.

  



  

(a) _Confidential Information_. Buyer acknowledges and agrees that
the Confidentiality Agreement remains in full force and effect and, in
addition, covenants and agrees to keep confidential, all confidential
knowledge, information, developments, methods and processes, trade secrets,
formulae, technology, specifications and know-how relating to the Business,
the Purchased Assets, the Real Estate Subsidiaries and information provided
to Buyer pursuant to this Agreement (" _Confidential Information_ ") in
accordance with the provisions of the Confidentiality Agreement. If this
Agreement is, for any reason, terminated prior to the Closing, the
Confidentiality Agreement and the provisions of this _Section 7.5(a)_ shall
nonetheless continue in full force and effect. If the Closing does occur, the
parties agree that the Confidentiality Agreement shall terminate automatically
at such time with no further action necessary by any party. After the
Closing, Seller shall, and shall cause each of its Affiliates to, treat all
Confidential Information relating to the Business as confidential, preserve
the confidentiality thereof, and not use or disclose to any Person such
information (except as expressly permitted by this Agreement or any of the
Transaction Documents), unless such information (i) is or becomes publicly
available or is now or hereafter disclosed in a manner making it publicly
available, in each case, through no act or omission in violation hereof, or
(ii) is required by applicable Law or the rules or regulations of any United
States securities exchange to be disclosed. If the disclosure of such
information is required by applicable Law or such rules and regulations,
Seller shall reasonably cooperate with and provide Buyer, at Buyer's sole cost
and expense, an opportunity to object to the disclosure and, if permissible,
shall give Buyer as much prior written notice as is reasonably
practicable under the circumstances. Promptly after the Closing, Seller (or
its Representatives, as applicable) shall request in writing the return or
destruction of all Confidential Information provided to any Person in
connection with such other Peron's interest in a possible transaction to
acquire the Business (or any portion thereof).

  



  

(b) _Seller Nonsolicitation_. In further consideration of the
consummation of the transactions contemplated herein, Seller covenants
and agrees that until the second (2nd) anniversary of the Closing Date, it
will not and it will cause its parent companies, Affiliates and subsidiaries
not to, without the prior written consent of Buyer, solicit, induce or attempt
to solicit or induce or hire, directly or indirectly, whether or not for
consideration, (x) any Business Employee of Buyer or (y) any management level
employee of Buyer or its subsidiaries with whom Seller came into contact or
learned about in connection with the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement (other than through general employee lists or rosters) (each such
employee, a " _Buyer Manager_ "), in each case unless (i) such Business
Employee or Buyer Manager is terminated by Buyer or (ii) more than six (6)
months shall have passed since such Business Employee or Buyer Manager
terminated his or her employment with Buyer or its Affiliates. The foregoing
covenant shall not prevent general solicitations for employees or public
advertisements of employment opportunities (including any recruitment efforts
conducted by any recruitment agency), provided that such general
solicitations, public advertisements and recruitment efforts are not directed
at any Business Employees or Buyer Managers of Buyer or its Affiliates.

  



  

(c) _Buyer Nonsolicitation_. In further consideration of the
consummation of the transactions contemplated herein, Buyer covenants
and agrees that until the second (2nd) anniversary of the Closing Date, it
will not and it will cause its parent companies, Affiliates and subsidiaries
not to, without the prior written consent of Seller, solicit, induce or
attempt to solicit or induce or hire, directly or indirectly, whether or not
for consideration, any management level employee of Seller or its subsidiaries
with whom Buyer came into contact or learned about in connection with the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement (other than through general
employee lists or rosters) unless (i) such employee is terminated by Seller or
its Affiliates or (ii) more than six (6) months shall have passed since such
employee terminated his or her employment with Seller or its Affiliates. The
foregoing covenant shall not prevent general solicitations for employees or
public advertisements of employment opportunities (including any recruitment
efforts conducted by any recruitment agency), provided that such general
solicitations, public advertisements and recruitment efforts are not directed
at any such employees of Seller or its Affiliates.

  



  

(d) _Use of Name_. Seller shall not, and shall cause its Affiliates
to not, use or take advantage of the "Crisco" name or any derivations thereof
after the Closing; _provided_ , that the foregoing will not restrict Seller or
its Affiliates from referencing Crisco products by name in recipes posted by
Seller or its Affiliates online or through other digital or
marketing mediums.

  



  

   

 | 57| 
---|---|--- 

 



    

  



  

(e) _Remedy for Certain Breaches_. The parties acknowledge and agree
that the covenants in _Section 7.5_ hereof were negotiated at arms' length,
are required for the fair and reasonable protection of the parties, that the
parties would not have entered into this Agreement had the other parties not
agreed to these covenants, that the restrictions contained herein are designed
to protect both the Business as purchased by Buyer and the ongoing business
of Seller, and that the benefits under this Agreement constitute adequate
consideration for the obligations of the parties under _Section 7.5_ hereof.
The parties further acknowledge and agree that a breach of any of the
covenants, obligations or agreements set forth in _Section 7.5_ hereof may
result in irreparable and continuing damage to the other parties for which
there will be no adequate remedy at law, and the parties agree that in the
event of any such breach, the non-breaching party shall be entitled to seek
injunctive relief to restrain such breach by the breaching party and to such
other and further relief (including damages) as is proper under the
circumstances.

  



  

(f) _Reformation of Agreement; Severability_. The parties intend the
covenants set forth in _Section 7.5_ hereof to be enforced as written.
However, in the event that any provision set forth in _Section 7.5_ hereof is
held by a court of competent jurisdiction to be invalid or unenforceable to
any extent, such court shall exercise its discretion in reforming such
provision so that the parties shall be subject to such restrictions and
obligations as the court deems reasonable under the circumstances and
enforceable by the parties. In the event that a provision or term of this
Agreement is found to be void or unenforceable to any extent and such court
does not exercise its discretion to reform such provision, it is the agreed
upon intent of the parties hereto that all remaining provisions or terms of
this Agreement shall remain in full force and effect to the maximum extent
permitted by law and that this Agreement shall be enforceable as if such void
or unenforceable provision or term had never been a part hereof.

  



  

Section 7.6 _Regulatory Act Compliance_.

  



  

(a) Buyer and Seller shall each file or cause to be filed, promptly
after the date of this Agreement (but in any event with an effective filing
date not later than October 30, 2020), any notifications or the like required
to be filed under the HSR Act and other antitrust or competitive Laws of any
applicable jurisdiction with respect to the transactions contemplated hereby.
Buyer and Seller shall bear the costs and expenses of the preparation of
their respective filings and Buyer shall pay all filing fees in
connection therewith. Buyer and Seller shall use their respective
commercially reasonable efforts to respond to any requests for
additional information made by any Governmental Authorities and to cause the
waiting periods or other requirements under the HSR Act and all other
applicable antitrust and competitive Laws to terminate or expire at the
earliest possible date (including with respect to filings under the HSR Act,
seeking early termination of the waiting period under the HSR Act) and to
resist in good faith (including the institution or defense of legal
proceedings), any assertion that the transactions contemplated hereby
constitute a violation of the antitrust or competition Laws of any applicable
jurisdiction, all to the end of expediting the consummation of the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement. Buyer, on the one hand, and
Seller, on the other hand, shall: (i) unless otherwise prohibited by
applicable Laws, promptly notify each other of any communication to that party
from the FTC, the DOJ or any other regulatory agency with respect to the
transactions contemplated hereby, and permit the other party to review in
advance any proposed written communication to the FTC, the DOJ or any other
Governmental Authority; (ii) unless otherwise prohibited by applicable
Laws, furnish the other party with copies of all correspondence, filings and
other communications (and memoranda setting forth the substance thereof)
between it, its Affiliates and their respective representatives, on the one
hand, and the FTC, DOJ or any other Governmental Authority, or member of
their respective staffs, on the other hand, with respect to the transactions
contemplated hereby (excluding documents and communications which are subject
to pre-existing confidentiality agreements or to attorney-client privilege);
and (iii) consult with the other prior to any meetings, by telephone or in
person, with the staff of the FTC, the DOJ or any other Governmental
Authority, and each of Buyer and Seller shall have the right, to the extent
permissible, to have a representative present at any such meeting. Each party
shall use its commercially reasonable efforts to obtain any clearance required
under the HSR Act or such other applicable Laws for the consummation of the
transactions contemplated hereby.

  



  

   

 | 58| 
---|---|--- 

 



    

  



  

(b) After the filing of the initial notification submitted pursuant to
the HSR Act or any other antitrust or competition Laws of any
applicable jurisdiction, each party shall be responsible for paying all out-
of-pocket fees and expenses incurred by such party or its Affiliates in
connection with or relating to the review of the transactions contemplated
hereby pursuant to the HSR Act or other antitrust or competition Laws or such
party's efforts to consummate the transactions contemplated hereby pursuant to
this Section 7.6.

  



  

Section 7.7 _UPC Codes_. Buyer covenants to renumber each Universal
Product Code or Global Trade Item Number included in the Retained Assets such
that Seller may keep the applicable prefix number (including, without
limitation, UPC prefix number 51500) in place with respect to the products
manufactured and sold by Seller or its Affiliates in connection with its
retained businesses, each within eighteen (18) months from the Closing Date
and Seller hereby grants Buyer and its Affiliates the right to use each
Universal Product Code or Global Trade Item Number included in the Retained
Assets as currently represented during such eighteen (18) month period.
Buyer shall pay all costs and expenses incurred in connection with such
conversion.

  



  

Section 7.8 _Payments, Invoices and Notices Received by Seller and
Buyer After the Closing_. To the extent Seller or any of its Affiliates
receive any payments (other than those payments received under this
Agreement), invoices or notices from third Persons, relating to the Purchased
Assets or Assumed Liabilities after the Closing Date, Seller will, and will
cause its Affiliates to, promptly remit any such payments or deliver any such
invoices or notices, to Buyer. To the extent that any such payments take the
form of a negotiable instrument, Seller or an applicable Affiliate will
endorse such negotiable instruments to the order of Buyer. To the extent Buyer
receives any payments, invoices or notices from third Persons relating to the
Retained Assets or Retained Liabilities after the Closing Date, Buyer will
promptly remit any such payments or deliver any such invoices or notices, to
Seller. To the extent that any such payments take the form of a negotiable
instrument, Buyer will endorse such negotiable instruments to the order of
Seller.

  



  

Section 7.9 _Assignment of Contracts and Permits_.

  



  

(a) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement, this
Agreement shall not constitute an agreement to assign or transfer any
Purchased Asset and associated Assumed Liability or any claim, right,
benefit, burden or cost arising thereunder or resulting therefrom if any
assignment or transfer or attempt to make such an assignment or transfer (i)
would be prohibited by Law or (ii) is not permitted without the consent,
approval or waiver of, or notice to, a third party or would constitute a
breach or violation thereof or affect adversely the rights of the Buyer or
Seller thereunder unless and until such consent, approval or waiver is
obtained or notice is provided. Prior to the Closing, Seller shall provide,
or cause to be provided, all commercially reasonable assistance to Buyer (not
including the payment of any consideration) reasonably requested by Buyer to
secure any such Consents from third parties.

  



  

   

 | 59| 
---|---|--- 

 



    

  



  

(b) If the Closing occurs and the circumstances described in the
_Section 7.9(a)_ exist, then Buyer and Seller agree to use their
commercially reasonable efforts to obtain such Consent and, for the avoidance
of doubt, the Closing shall occur notwithstanding the foregoing without any
adjustment to the Purchase Price on account thereof. To the extent any such
required Consent is not so obtained, Buyer and Seller agree to use their
commercially reasonable efforts to provide Buyer all of the practical economic
claims, rights and benefits arising under such Purchased Asset (whether by
subcontracting or otherwise) and Buyer agrees to satisfy all Assumed
Liabilities arising from such Purchased Asset, so that, in any case, Buyer
shall be solely responsible for such Assumed Liabilities from and after the
Closing Date; provided, however, that neither Seller nor Buyer shall be
required to pay any consideration for any such Consent. Buyer will bear any
related economic burden resulting from the implementation of any such
alternative arrangements pursuant to this _Section 7.9(b)_. To the extent
permitted by applicable Law, Seller shall (and shall cause its Affiliates to)
exercise, enforce and exploit, only at the direction and cost of and for the
benefit of Buyer any and all claims, rights and benefits associated with such
Purchased Asset. Once the Consent for the sale, assignment, assumption,
transfer, conveyance and delivery of a Purchased Asset is obtained, Seller
shall promptly assign, transfer, convey and deliver such Purchased Asset to
Buyer, and Buyer shall assume the obligations (solely to the extent they
constitute Assumed Liabilities) under such Purchased Asset assigned to Buyer
from and after the date of assignment to Buyer pursuant to a special-purpose
document of transfer.

  



  

Section 7.10 _Commingled Contracts_. Promptly after the date hereof,
unless otherwise requested by Buyer with respect to any Commingled Contract,
each of Seller and Buyer shall use, and shall cause their respective
Affiliates to use, commercially reasonable efforts to (i) cause the
counterparty to each Commingled Contract to enter into a new contract with
Buyer or its designee, on terms substantially similar to those contained in
such Commingled Contract, including with respect to pricing, in order for the
Business to receive the applicable benefits under such Commingled Contract
(each such new contract, a " _New Contract_ "), or (ii) if
practicable, assign to Buyer or its designee the benefits and obligations
under such Commingled Contract as they relate to the Business. If the parties
hereto are not able to obtain a New Contract with a counterparty to any such
Commingled Contract or assign such Commingled Contract prior to the Closing,
then (x) Seller, Buyer and their respective Affiliates shall continue, for a
period of twelve (12) months following the Closing, to use commercially
reasonable efforts to cause such counterparty to enter into a New Contract or
assign to Buyer or its designee the benefits and obligations under such
Commingled Contract as they relate to the Business, and (y) until such time
as a New Contract is executed or a Commingled Contract is so assigned, Seller
and Buyer shall use and shall cause their respective Affiliates to use
commercially reasonable efforts to secure an alternative arrangement
reasonably satisfactory to Buyer and Seller under which the Business would,
in compliance with applicable Law, obtain the benefits associated with the
applicable Commingled Contract as they relate to the Business for the term of
such Commingled Contract after the Closing. Buyer will bear any related
economic burden resulting from the implementation of any such alternative
arrangements pursuant to this _Section 7.10_. To the extent permitted by
applicable Law, Seller shall (and shall cause its Affiliates to)
exercise, enforce and exploit, only at the direction and cost of and for the
benefit of Buyer any and all claims, rights and benefits as they relate to
the Business with respect to the Commingled Contracts that have not yet been
assigned or replaced with a New Contract.

Section 7.11 _Tax Cooperation_. Buyer and Seller agree to retain and
furnish or cause to be furnished to each other, upon request, as promptly as
practicable, such working papers and information relating to the Purchased
Assets, Assumed Liabilities and the Business and to provide such assistance
as is reasonably necessary for the preparation and filing of all Tax Returns,
the making of any election related to Taxes, the preparation for any audit by
any taxing authority and the prosecution or defense of any claim, suit or
proceeding relating to any Tax Return at the cost of the requesting party.
Seller and Buyer shall reasonably cooperate with each other in the conduct of
any audit or other proceeding related to Taxes involving the Business and each
shall execute and deliver such powers of attorney and other documents as are
necessary to carry out the intent of this Section 7.11 at the cost of the
requesting party.

  



  

Section 7.12 _Payment of Certain Taxes; Prorations_. Seller agrees to
timely pay all real and personal property Taxes and all water, gas,
electricity and other utilities, local business or other license fees and
other similar periodic charges payable in respect of the Purchased Assets for
the period prior to and including the Closing Date and Buyer agrees to timely
pay such amounts on all Purchased Assets payable in respect of the period
thereafter. The parties agree to prorate all real and personal property Taxes
on the Closing Date based on the number of days in the period and in
accordance with the most recent tax bill and all such prorations shall be
final. To the extent practicable, utility meter readings for the Real
Property shall be determined as of the Closing Date. All
transfer, documentary, sales, use, stamp, registration, value added and other
such Taxes and fees (including any penalties and interest) incurred as a
result of the sale of the Purchased Assets and assumption of the Assumed
Liabilities in connection with this Agreement and the other Transaction
Documents (including any real property transfer Tax and any other similar Tax,
but excluding GST/HST, QST or PST) (collectively, " _Transfer Taxes_ ") shall
be borne by equally by Buyer and Seller. The parties shall cooperate in good
faith to pay such Transfer Taxes and fees when due and timely file any Tax
Return or other document with respect to such Transfer Taxes (" _Transfer Tax
Returns_ ") or fees, _provided_ that Buyer shall file any such Transfer Tax
Returns unless such Transfer Tax Returns must be filed by Seller under
applicable Law. A party's preparation of any such Transfer Tax Returns shall
be subject to the other party's approval, which approval shall not be
unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed.

  



  

Section 7.13 _Representation and Warranty Insurance Policy_. Buyer has
obtained and bound a Representation and Warranty Insurance Policy. Buyer shall
not amend the subrogation or third party beneficiary provisions contained in
the Representation and Warranty Insurance Policy without the prior written
consent of Seller; provided, that, in all events, the Representation and
Warranty Insurance Policy shall provide that (a) except in the case of Fraud
the insurer shall have no, and shall waive and not pursue any and all
subrogation rights against Seller and its Affiliates; and (b) Seller and its
Affiliates are third party beneficiaries of such waiver. Buyer shall pay or
cause to be paid all costs and expenses related to the Representation and
Warranty Insurance Policy, including the premium, underwriting fees, and
surplus lines Taxes related to such policy.

Section 7.14 _Tax Elections_.

  



  

(a) If applicable, Seller and Foreign Buyer may, on Closing,
jointly elect under one or more elections pursuant to subsection 167(1)
of GST/HST Act and/or section 75 of the QST Act ( " _GST/HST Election_ " or "
_QST Election_ ", as the case may be), that no GST/HST or QST be payable with
respect to the purchase and sale of all or some of the Foreign
Purchased Assets under this Agreement. Seller and Foreign Buyer shall make
such election(s) in prescribed form containing prescribed information and
Foreign Buyer shall, on a timely basis, file such election(s) in compliance
with the requirements of the applicable Law. Notwithstanding any other
provision of this Agreement, in the event that a GST/HST Election or QST
Election does not apply in respect of the sale of the Foreign Purchased
Assets, Foreign Buyer shall pay to Seller at the time such GST/HST and/or QST
becomes payable an amount in cash equal to the amount GST/HST and/or QST
collectable by Seller in connection with the sale and the transfer of such
Foreign Purchased Assets. If necessary, Seller shall ensure that it is
registered for QST for the purposes of collecting and remitting the
aforementioned QST amounts.

  



  

(b) At the Foreign Buyer's request, the Seller shall jointly with
the Foreign Buyer execute and file an election pursuant to subsection 20(24)
of the _Income Tax Act_ (Canada) (and corresponding provisions of any
applicable provincial legislation), in the manner and within the time
prescribed by applicable Law.

  



  

(c) Seller, and the Foreign Buyer agree that no amount of the
Purchase Price attributable to the Foreign Purchased Assets is or will be
allocated to or paid in respect of restrictive covenants under this
Agreement.

  



  

Section 7.15 _Exclusivity_. During the Pre-Closing Period, Seller
shall not, and shall not authorize or permit any of its Affiliates or any of
its or their officers, directors, employees, agents or representatives to,
directly or indirectly, (i) encourage, solicit, initiate, facilitate or
continue inquiries regarding an Acquisition Proposal; (ii) enter into
discussions or negotiations with, or provide any information to, any Person
concerning a possible Acquisition Proposal; or (iii) enter into any agreements
or other instruments (whether or not binding) regarding an Acquisition
Proposal. Seller shall immediately cease and cause to be terminated, and
shall cause its Affiliates and all of its and their officers, directors,
employees, agents or representatives to immediately cease and cause to be
terminated, all existing discussions or negotiations with any Persons
conducted heretofore with respect to, or that could lead to, an Acquisition
Proposal. If Seller receives an Acquisition Proposal during the Pre-Closing
Period and such Acquisition Proposal permits disclosure to third parties,
Seller will promptly inform Buyer as the receipt of such Acquisition Proposal.

ARTICLE VIII _ 
 INDEMNIFICATION_

  



  

Section 8.1 _Survival_. None of the representations, warranties,
covenants, or agreements contained in this Agreement or in any certificate
delivered at the Closing (other than the Fundamental Representations) shall
survive the Closing, such that no claim for breach of, inaccuracy in, or
nonperformance or nonfulfillment of any such representation (other than the
Fundamental Representations), warranty, covenant or agreement may be brought
after the Closing with respect thereto against any party, and there will be no
Liability in respect thereof, whether such Liability has accrued prior to or
after the Closing, on the part of any party; _provided_ , _however_ , the
covenants contained in this Agreement that by their terms apply or are to be
performed in whole or in part at or after the Closing shall survive until
fully performed in accordance with their respective terms (it being understood
that any claims for breaches of such covenants may be made at any time prior
to the expiration of the applicable statute of limitations). The
Fundamental Representations will survive for the longer of (a) the applicable
statute of limitations and (b) six (6) years following the Closing Date, in
each case, after which all causes of action and Liability with respect to such
Fundamental Representations shall terminate and be of no further force and
effect. Notwithstanding the foregoing, any claims asserted in writing by
notice of a claim hereunder and seeking to be indemnified within the periods
set forth in this Section 8.1 shall survive until such claim is finally and
fully resolved.

  



  

Section 8.2 _Indemnification by Seller_. From and after the
Closing, Seller shall indemnify and hold harmless Buyer and its Affiliates and
its and their respective directors, officers, employees, advisors, owners,
equityholders, agents and Representatives (the " _Buyer Indemnitees_
") against and from any and all Losses which any Buyer Indemnitee may incur
or suffer that arise out of or result from (i) any breach of or inaccuracy in
any Seller Fundamental Representation, (ii) any nonperformance, nonfulfillment
or breach of any covenant, obligation or agreement by Seller or its
Affiliates contained in this Agreement that by their terms apply or are to be
performed in whole or in part at or after the Closing, (iii) the Retained
Liabilities, and (iv) Seller's Fraud. Any breach or inaccuracy of the
Seller's representations and warranties herein and the calculation of Losses
related thereto, shall be determined without regard to any qualification
contained therein relating to "Material Adverse Effect" or materiality or any
other similar qualifiers.

  



  

Section 8.3 _Indemnification by Buyer_. From and after the
Closing, U.S. Buyer and Foreign Buyer shall severally but not jointly,
indemnify and hold harmless Seller and its Affiliates and its and their
respective directors, officers, employees, advisors, owners, equityholders,
agents and Representatives (the " _Seller Indemnitees_ ") against and from
any and all Losses which any Seller Indemnitee may incur or suffer that arise
out of or result from (i) any breach of or inaccuracy in any Buyer Fundamental
Representation; provided that any such breach or inaccuracy, and the
calculation of Losses related thereto, shall be determined without regard to
any qualification contained therein relating to "Material Adverse Effect" or
materiality or any other similar qualifiers, (ii) any nonperformance,
nonfulfillment or breach of any covenant, obligation or agreement by Buyer or
its Affiliates contained in this Agreement that by their terms apply or are
to be performed in whole or in part at or after the Closing, (iii)
the Assumed Liabilities, and (iv) Buyer's Fraud.

  



  

Section 8.4 _Claims_. Any Buyer Indemnitee or Seller Indemnitee
claiming it may be entitled to indemnification under _ARTICLE VIII_ (the "
_Indemnified Party_ ") shall give prompt written notice (a " _Claim Notice_
") to the other party (the " _Indemnifying Party_ ") of each matter, Action,
cause of action, claim, demand, fact or other circumstances upon which a claim
for indemnification (each a " _Claim_ ") hereunder may be based. Such notice
shall contain, with respect to each Claim, such facts and information as are
then reasonably available, the estimated amount of Losses and the specific
basis for indemnification hereunder. Failure to give prompt notice of a Claim
hereunder shall not affect the Indemnifying Party's obligations hereunder,
except to the extent the Indemnifying Party is actually and materially
adversely prejudiced by such failure.

  



  

   

63

 



    



  

Section 8.5 _Defense of Actions_.

  



  

(a) _Third Party Claims_. Other than with respect to (x) any Claim
for which a Buyer Indemnitee seeks recovery under the Representation and
Warranty Insurance Policy (a " _R andW Proceeding_"), which for the avoidance of
doubt, for all purposes of this Agreement, and notwithstanding anything to
the contrary herein or otherwise, Buyer or the RandW Carrier shall have
the sole and absolute right to control (whether directly or indirectly), or
(y) any Claim relating to a Retained Liability (a  " _Retained Liability
Proceeding_ "), which for the avoidance of doubt, for all purposes of this
Agreement, and notwithstanding anything to the contrary herein or otherwise,
Seller shall have the sole and absolute right to control (whether directly or
indirectly), the Indemnified Party shall permit the Indemnifying Party, at the
Indemnifying Party's option and expense, to assume the complete defense of
any Claim based on any Action, suit, claim, demand or assessment by any third
party with full authority to conduct such defense of the same and the
Indemnified Party will reasonably cooperate in such defense at the expense of
the Indemnifying Party; _provided_ that (i) the Indemnifying Party assumes
control of the applicable Claim in writing within twenty (20) Business Days
of receipt of the applicable Claim Notice, uses counsel that is reasonably
acceptable to the Indemnified Party, diligently prosecutes or defends such
claim in a commercially reasonable manner and irrevocably agrees in writing
that it is required to indemnify the Indemnified Party with respect to such
Claim, (ii) such third party claim does not seek to impose any Liability on
the Indemnified Party other than money Losses, (iii) such third party claim
does not involve any criminal Liability or other sanctions or matters that
would be reasonably expected to materially and adversely affect the Business,
the Purchased Assets or the Real Estate Subsidiaries, individually or taken as
a whole, (iv) such third party claim does not involve or is brought by a
Governmental Authority (excluding any third party claim with respect to
Taxes or brought by a Governmental Authority with respect to Taxes), Material
Customer or Material Supplier, (v) a reasonable likelihood does not exist of
a conflict of interest between the Indemnified Party and the Indemnifying
Party or there are no legal defenses available to the Indemnified Party that
are different from those available to the Indemnifying Party (each of clauses
(ii-v), a " _Control Event_ "); _provided further_ that the Indemnifying
Party will not, in defense of any such Claim, except with the written consent
of the Indemnified Party (such consent not to be unreasonably withheld,
conditioned or delayed), consent to the entry of any judgment or enter into
any settlement. After written notice to the Indemnified Party of the
Indemnifying Party's election to assume the defense of such Claim, the
Indemnifying Party shall be liable to the Indemnified Party for such legal or
other expenses subsequently incurred by the Indemnified Party in connection
with the defense thereof only (i) if incurred at the request of the
Indemnifying Party, (ii) if in the reasonable opinion of counsel to the
Indemnified Party, a conflict of interest exists between the interests of the
Indemnified Party and the Indemnifying Party that requires representation by
separate counsel, in which case the fees and expenses of one such separate
counsel of the Indemnified Party will be paid by the Indemnifying Party,
(iii) the Indemnifying Party has failed to diligently pursue such defense or
fails to prosecute such claim or (iv) during any period in which the
Indemnifying Party could no longer control all or any portion of the
defense thereof whether in connection with a Control Event or otherwise. As
to those third-party Claims with respect to which the Indemnifying Party does
not or cannot elect to assume control of the defense, the Indemnified Party
will afford the Indemnifying Party an opportunity to participate in such
defense (other than with respect to a RandW Proceeding), at the Indemnifying
Party's cost and expense, and will consult with the Indemnifying Party prior
to settling or otherwise disposing of any of the same. In the event of a
Retained Liability Proceeding, Seller as Indemnifying Party will not, in
defense of any such Claim, except with the written consent of the Indemnified
Party (such consent not to be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed),
consent to the entry of any judgment or enter into any settlement that would
result in any continuing Liability to Buyer or impose any injunctive relief
against the Business or any of the Purchased Assets.

  



  

   

64

 



    



  

(b) After any decision, judgment, award or other Order shall have
been rendered by a Governmental Authority, or a settlement shall have been
consummated (in accordance with this _ARTICLE VIII_), or the Indemnified
Party and the Indemnifying Party shall have arrived at a mutually binding
agreement with respect to a Claim hereunder, the Indemnified Party shall
forward to the Indemnifying Party notice of any sums due and owing (to the
extent not already advanced or reimbursed pursuant to this _ARTICLE
VIII_) by the Indemnifying Party pursuant to this Agreement with respect to
such matter. Upon the determination of liability, the appropriate party shall
within ten (10) days of such determination, pay the amount of such claim.

  



  

Section 8.6 _Limitation, Exclusivity_.

  



  

(a) No Claim shall be made or have any validity unless the
Indemnified Party shall have given written notice of such Claim to the
Indemnifying Party prior to the date set forth in _Section 8.1_ for such
Claim. Should the Closing occur, except as set forth in  _Section 3.2_, the
remedies provided for in this _ARTICLE VIII_ will be the sole and exclusive
remedies of the parties and their Affiliates and each of their respective
stockholders, equityholders, officers, directors, employees,
Affiliates, agents, Representatives, successors and assigns for any breach of
or inaccuracy in any representation, warranty, covenant or
obligation contained in this Agreement, in any Closing Certificate, the
certificate delivered pursuant to Section 6.2(c)(iii) or the certificate
delivered pursuant to Section 6.3(c)(iii); _provided_ , _however_ , that
nothing in this Agreement is intended to (i) waive any claims for Fraud, (ii)
limit any claims under the Representation and Warranty Insurance Policy or
(iii) prohibit a party from commencing an action or proceeding for specific
performance or injunction to which a party may be entitled (including any
action to require a party hereto to consummate the transactions contemplated
hereby).

  



  

(b) To the extent a Claim is brought with respect to a Seller
Fundamental Representation, Buyer agrees to first submit such Claim to the
RandW Carrier for coverage under the terms and conditions of the Representation
and Warranty Insurance Policy; provided that (i) Buyer shall only be required
to (1) use commercially reasonable efforts to seek coverage under the
Representations and Warranty Insurance Policy and (2) comply with the terms
and conditions of the Representations and Warranty Insurance Policy; provided
that any non-compliance with the preceding obligations that would not limit
the Buyer's recovery under the Representations and Warranty Insurance Policy
in respect of such Claim would not be deemed a breach of this _Section
8.6(b)_ and (ii) in no event will the Buyer be obligated to initiate
litigation against the RandW Carrier in order to recover under the
Representations and Warranty Insurance Policy. Subject to the foregoing
sentence, to the extent a Claim with respect to a Seller Fundamental
Representation is not paid (in whole or in part) under the Representations and
Warranty Insurance Policy the Buyer may pursue the unpaid portion of such
Claim against Seller in accordance with this _ARTICLE VIII_. Any
Losses payable by Seller pursuant to the terms of this _ARTICLE VIII_
associated with such Claim shall be reduced by any proceeds received under
the Representation and Warranty Insurance Policy with respect to such Claim.
Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the contrary, Buyer may submit
a Claim for a breach of a Seller Fundamental Representation against Seller at
any time (after first submitting such Claim under the Representation and
Warranty Insurance Policy as set forth in this _Section 8.6(b)_) for the
purpose of reserving its rights to bring such Claim prior to the expiration of
the applicable survival period set forth in _Section 8.1_.

  



  

   

65

 



    



  

Section 8.7 _Tax Treatment of Indemnity Payments_. Any indemnity
payment under this Agreement shall be treated as an adjustment to the
Purchase Price for Tax purposes to the extent permitted by applicable Tax
Law.

  



  

Section 8.8 _Mitigation_. Each party shall use commercially
reasonable efforts to mitigate any claim or liability that such party asserts
or could assert under this _ARTICLE VIII_ upon becoming aware of any such
claim or liability, including (x) by seeking full recovery under any title
insurance policies covering the Owned Real Property or (y) as set forth in
_Section 8.6(b)_, in each of clause (x) and (y), solely with respect to a
breach of a Seller Fundamental Representation; provided that no party shall
be required to seek recovery under any other insurance policies or "pass-
through" warranty coverage for any Losses to the same extent as they would if
such Losses were not subject to indemnification under this Agreement. Other
than with respect to the Representation and Warranty Insurance Policy (except
as otherwise set forth in _Section 8.6(b)_), the amount of Losses otherwise
recoverable hereunder shall be limited to the amount of any Losses that remain
after deducting therefrom any insurance proceeds and any indemnity,
contribution or other similar cash payment actually received by any
Indemnified Party from any third party with respect thereto after reduction
for the reasonable fees, expenses and costs (including any increases to
insurance premiums, deductibles, co-pay amount s or similar costs) incurred to
recover such amounts. If any Indemnified Party collects an amount in
discharge of a claim in respect of a Loss pursuant hereto and such Indemnified
Party subsequently recovers from a third party by way of insurance (excluding
the Representation and Warranty Insurance Policy, other than as expressly
set forth in _Section 8.6(b)_) or otherwise such that the Indemnified Party
has received an amount in connection therewith in excess of its related
Losses (such excess recovery, the " _Excess Recovery_ "), such Indemnified
Party shall (or, as appropriate, shall cause an Affiliate to) repay to the
Indemnifying Party or Indemnifying Parties an amount equal to the Excess
Recovery less any costs or expenses incurred by the Indemnified Party in
procuring the Excess Recovery (but no more than the amount paid by the
Indemnifying Party to the Indemnified Party pursuant to this _ARTICLE VIII_).

  



  

Section 8.9 _R andW Policy_. Notwithstanding anything to the
contrary, nothing in this Agreement shall limit, restrict or otherwise impair
the terms, conditions and coverage provided under the Representation and
Warranty Insurance Policy nor shall the terms of this Agreement limit a Buyer
Indemnitees' right to receive payment, make a claim or otherwise seek coverage
under the Representation and Warranty Insurance Policy; and for the avoidance
of doubt, no indemnification payment payable hereunder shall be
conditioned, withheld or delayed as a result of any Buyer Indemnitee not
having sought (other than with respect to Claims for a breach of a Seller
Fundamental Representation, which shall be pursued in accordance with _Section
8.6(b)_), realized or received any insurance proceeds.

Section 9.2 _Amendment and Waiver_. No amendment, modification, or
waiver of this Agreement or any provision hereof, including the provisions of
this sentence, shall be effective or enforceable as against a party hereto
unless made in a written instrument that specifically references this
Agreement and that is signed by the party waiving compliance.

  



  

   

67

 



    



  

Section 9.3 _Binding Effect_. This Agreement shall be binding
upon and shall inure to the benefit of Buyer, Seller and the respective
successors and permitted assigns of Buyer and Seller.

  



  

Section 9.4 _Interpretation_. When a reference is made in this
Agreement to a Section, such reference shall be to a Section of this Agreement
unless otherwise indicated. The headings contained in this Agreement are for
reference purposes only and shall not affect in any way the meaning or
interpretation of this Agreement. Terms defined in the singular shall have a
comparable meaning when used in the plural, and vice versa. Whenever the
words "include," "includes" or "including" are used in this Agreement, they
shall be deemed to be followed by the words "without limitation." References
to "hereof," "herein," or "hereby" shall refer to this entire Agreement
(including the schedules and exhibits hereto). All pronouns and
any variations thereof shall be deemed to refer to the masculine, feminine or
neuter, singular or plural, as the identity of the Person or Persons may
require. References to Laws shall be deemed to mean and include such Laws as
amended, modified or supplemented through the date of this Agreement or the
Closing Date, as applicable. The word "will" will be construed to have
the same meaning as the word "shall" and the word "extent" in the phrase "to
the extent" means the degree to which a subject or other thing extends, and
such phrase not mean simply "if". Unless the context indicates otherwise, the
word "or" is not exclusive. References to a Person are also to its permitted
successors and assigns. This Agreement and the other documents contemplated
herein shall be deemed to have been drafted by the parties, and neither
this Agreement nor any other document contemplated herein shall be construed
against any party as the principal draftsperson hereof or thereof.

  



  

Section 9.5 _Time is of the Essence_. Time is of the essence for
each and every provision of this Agreement. Whenever the last day for the
exercise of any privilege or the discharge or any duty hereunder shall fall
upon a day which is not a Business Day, the party having such privilege or
duty may exercise such privilege or discharge such duty on the next succeeding
day which is a regular Business Day.

  



  

Section 9.6 _Counterparts_. This Agreement, the Transaction
Documents and each other document delivered pursuant to this Agreement may be
executed in counterparts, and delivered by electronic mail with scan or
attachment signature, all of which when so executed and delivered shall be
considered one and the same agreement and shall become effective when one or
more counterparts have been signed by each of the parties and delivered to
the other parties. Each counterpart may consist of a number of copies hereof
or thereof each signed by less than all, but together signed by all, of the
parties. An electronic or other copy of a signature shall be deemed an
original for purposes of this Agreement.

  



  

Section 9.7 _Entire Agreement_. This Agreement, the Transaction
Documents, and the Schedules and Exhibits hereto and thereto constitute the
exclusive statement of the agreement among the parties hereto concerning the
subject matter hereof, and supersedes all other prior agreements, oral or
written, among or between any of the parties hereto concerning such subject
matter. All negotiations among or between any of the parties hereto are
superseded by this Agreement, and there are no representations, warranties,
promises, understandings or agreements, oral or written, in relation to the
subject matter hereof among or between any of the parties hereto other
than those expressly set forth or expressly incorporated herein.

Section 9.8 _Governing Law; Venue; Waiver of Jury Trial_. This
Agreement shall be governed by, and construed in accordance with, the laws of
the State of Delaware, regardless of the laws that might otherwise govern
under applicable principles of conflicts of laws thereof. Any and all Actions
brought, arising out of or based upon, in whole or in part, this Agreement
shall be brought in the Court of Chancery of the State of Delaware, of, if
the Court of Chancery of the State of Delaware is unavailable, any other court
of the State of Delaware, or if such courts will not have jurisdiction, any
federal court of the United States of America sitting in Delaware, and any
appellate court from any appeal thereof. The parties irrevocably submit to the
jurisdiction of these courts and irrevocably waive, to the full extent
permitted by applicable Law, any objection which they may have to the venue of
any such dispute brought in such court or any other defense of inconvenient
forum for the maintenance of such dispute. Each party hereto hereby
acknowledges and agrees that any controversy which may arise under this
Agreement is likely to involve complicated and difficult issues,
and therefore each party hereby irrevocably and unconditionally waives any
right such party may have to a trial by jury in respect of any litigation
directly or indirectly arising out of or relating to this Agreement or the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement. Each party certifies and
acknowledges that (a) no Representative, agent or attorney of any other party
has represented, expressly or otherwise that such other party would not, in
the event of litigation, seek to enforce the foregoing waiver, (b) such party
understands and has considered the implications of this waiver, (c) such party
makes this waiver voluntarily, and (d) such party has been induced to enter
into this Agreement by, among other things, the mutual waivers and
certifications in this _Section 9.8_.

  



  

Section 9.9 _Specific Performance_. Each party's obligations
under this Agreement are unique. If any party should breach its covenants
under this Agreement, the parties each acknowledge that it would be
impracticable to measure the resulting damages; accordingly, the non-
breaching party or parties, in addition to any other available rights or
remedies they may have under the terms of this Agreement, may sue in equity
for specific performance, and each party expressly waives the defense that a
remedy in damages will be adequate.

  



  

Section 9.10 _Assignment_. Neither this Agreement nor any of the
rights, interests or obligations hereunder shall be assigned by any of the
parties without the prior written consent of the other party; provided that
(i) Buyer may assign its right to purchase the Purchased Assets and delegate
its obligations to assume the Assumed Liabilities hereunder in whole or in
part to any of its Affiliates without the prior written consent of Seller,
(ii) Seller may assign any of its rights or obligations under this Agreement
in whole or in part to any of its Affiliates without the prior written
consent of Buyer, and (iii) Buyer may assign its rights and obligations under
this Agreement in whole or in part through a collateral assignment to any
lender providing financing in connection with the transactions contemplated
by this Agreement without the prior written consent of the Seller; _provided_
, that in each preceding instance Buyer or Seller as assignor, as applicable,
will remain obligated to the other party pursuant to the terms hereof. The
terms and conditions of this Agreement shall inure to the benefit of and be
binding upon the respective successors and permitted assigns of the parties
hereto.

  



  

Section 9.11 _Third Parties_. Except as may otherwise be expressly
stated herein, no provision of this Agreement is intended or shall be
construed to confer on any Person, other than the parties hereto, any rights
hereunder. Buyer Indemnitees and Seller Indemnitees and Nonparty Affiliates
who are not otherwise parties to this Agreement shall be third party
beneficiaries of this Agreement for purposes of  _ARTICLE VIII_ and _Section
9.17_, as applicable.

  



  

   

69

 



    



  

Section 9.12 _Schedules; Exhibits_. The Disclosure Schedules and
Exhibits referenced in this Agreement constitute an integral part of this
Agreement as if fully rewritten herein. Notwithstanding anything to the
contrary contained in this Agreement or in any of the sections of the
Disclosure Schedules, any information disclosed in one Section of the
Disclosure Schedules shall be deemed to be disclosed in such other sections
of the Disclosure Schedules and applicable to such other representations and
warranties to the extent that the disclosure is reasonably apparent from its
face to be applicable to such other Section of the Disclosure Schedules
and such other representations and warranties. The Disclosure Schedules may
include items and information that are not "material" relative to the entire
Business, taken as a whole, and such inclusion shall not be deemed to be an
acknowledgment or agreement that any such item or information (or any non-
disclosed item or information of comparable or greater significance) is
"material" or to further define the meaning of such term for purposes of this
Agreement or otherwise. All references in this document to  "this Agreement"
and the terms "herein," "hereof," "hereunder" and the like shall be deemed to
include all of such sections of the Disclosure Schedules and Exhibits.

  



  

Section 9.13 _Severability_. If any term or other provision of this
Agreement is invalid, illegal or incapable of being enforced by any rule of
law, or public policy, all other conditions and provisions of this Agreement
shall nevertheless remain in full force and effect so long as the economic or
legal substance of the transactions contemplated hereby are not affected in
any manner materially adverse to any party. Upon such determination that any
term or other provision is invalid, illegal or incapable of being enforced,
the parties shall negotiate in good faith to modify this Agreement so as to
effect the original intent of the parties as closely as possible in a
mutually acceptable manner in order that the transactions be consummated as
originally contemplated to the fullest extent possible.

  



  

Section 9.14 _Bulk Sale Laws_. Buyer hereby waives compliance by
Seller and its Affiliates with the provisions of the "bulk sales,"  "bulk
transfer" or similar Laws of any state or any jurisdiction outside the United
States that may otherwise be applicable with respect to the sale of any of
the Purchased Assets; it being understood that any Liabilities arising out of
the failure of Seller and its Affiliates to comply with the provisions of
such Laws which would not otherwise constitute Assumed Liabilities shall be
treated as Retained Liabilities.

  



  

Section 9.15 _Expenses_. Whether or not the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement are consummated, except as otherwise expressly
provided in this Agreement, Seller on the one hand, and Buyer, on the other
hand, shall pay all fees, costs and expenses incurred by such party or on its
behalf in connection with this Agreement and the transactions contemplated
hereby, including fees, costs and expenses of its financial consultants,
accountants and counsel.

  



  

   

70

 



    



  

Section 9.16 _Non-Recourse_. All claims, obligations, Liabilities,
or causes of action (whether in contract or in tort, in law or in equity, or
granted by statute) that may be based upon, in respect of, arise under, out
or by reason of, be connected with, or relate in any manner to this
Agreement, or the negotiation, execution, or performance of this Agreement
(including any representation, warranty, covenant or agreement made in, in
connection with, or as an inducement to, this Agreement), may be made only
against (and are those solely of) the Seller and the Buyer (collectively, the
" _Contracting Parties_ "). Except as set forth in any Contract currently in
effect between a Contracting Party and a Nonparty Affiliate, no Person who is
not a Contracting Party, including any current, former or future
representative or Affiliate of Seller or Buyer or any current, former or
future representative or Affiliate of any of the foregoing (collectively, "
_Nonparty Affiliates_ "), shall have any liability (whether in contract or in
tort, in law or in equity, or granted by statute) for any claims, causes of
action, obligations, or Liabilities arising under, out of, in connection
with, or related in any manner to this Agreement or based on, in respect of,
or by reason of this Agreement or its negotiation, execution, performance, or
breach, and, to the maximum extent permitted by Law, each Contracting Party
(and in the case of each of Seller and Buyer, on behalf of itself and any of
its subsidiaries and Affiliates, and their respective directors, officers,
employees, agents, advisors and Representatives) hereby waives and releases
all such Liabilities, claims, causes of action, and obligations against any
such Nonparty Affiliates. Without limiting the foregoing, to the
maximum extent permitted by Law, (a) each Contracting Party and in the case
of each of Seller and Buyer, on behalf of itself and any of its subsidiaries
and Affiliates, and their respective directors, officers, employees, agents,
advisors and Representatives, hereby waives and releases any and all rights,
claims, demands, or causes of action that may otherwise be available at law
or in equity, or granted by statute, to avoid or disregard the entity form of
a Contracting Party or otherwise impose liability of a Contracting Party on
any Nonparty Affiliate, whether granted by statute or based on theories of
equity, agency, control, instrumentality, alter ego, domination, sham, single
business enterprise, piercing the veil, unfairness, undercapitalization, or
otherwise, and (b) each Contracting Party (and in the case of each of Seller
and Buyer, on behalf of itself and any of its subsidiaries and Affiliates,
and their respective directors, officers, employees, agents, advisors and
representatives) disclaims any reliance upon any Nonparty Affiliates with
respect to the performance of this Agreement or any representation, warranty,
covenant or agreement made in, in connection with, or as an inducement to
this Agreement. Notwithstanding the foregoing, nothing in this _Section
9.16 _shall limit the ability of a party to bring a claim for Fraud against
another party.

  



  

Section 9.17 _Release_. Effective as of the Closing (but only if
the Closing actually occurs), except for (i) any rights or obligations under
this Agreement, the other Transaction Documents, or any other Contract
currently in effect entered into by any Releasing Party with any Released
Party in connection with its, his, or her entry into this Agreement and the
transactions contemplated hereby and thereby, including, for the avoidance of
doubt, any claims or rights relating to the Retained Assets or the Retained
Liabilities, and (ii) any claims that cannot be released as a matter of Law,
Seller, on behalf of itself and its Affiliates and its and their respective
successor or assign (collectively, the " _Releasing Parties_ "), hereby
irrevocably and unconditionally releases and forever discharges Buyer and its
respective Affiliates (including the Real Estate Subsidiaries) and SOWC Sub,
and each of the foregoing's respective past, present or future officers,
directors, employees, agents, general or limited partners, managers,
management companies, members, stockholders, equity holders, controlling
Persons, Representatives, or any heir, executor, administrator, successor or
assign of any of the foregoing (collectively, the " _Released Parties_ ") of
and from any and all Actions, causes of action, suits, proceedings,
executions, judgments, duties, debts, dues, accounts, bonds, contracts and
covenants (whether express or implied), and claims and demands whatsoever
whether in law or in equity (whether based upon contract, tort or otherwise)
which the Releasing Parties may have against each of the Released Parties, now
or in the future, in each case in respect of any cause, matter or thing
relating to the Business, the Real Estate Subsidiaries, SOWC Sub, the
Purchased Assets, the Assumed Liabilities or any actions taken or failed to
be taken by any of the Released Parties in any capacity related to or
affecting the Business, in each case occurring or arising prior to the
Closing.
