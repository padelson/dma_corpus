iv AGREEMENT AND PLAN OF MERGER, dated as of July 31, 2011 (the " _Agreement_
"), among Windstream Corporation, a Delaware corporation (" _Parent_ "), Peach
Merger Sub, Inc., a Delaware corporation and a direct wholly owned Subsidiary
of Parent (" _Merger Sub_ "), and PAETEC Holding Corp., a Delaware
corporation (the " _Company_ ").

_W_ _I_ _T_ _N_ _E_   _S_ _S_ _E_ _T_ _H_ :

WHEREAS, the respective Boards of Directors of Parent, Merger Sub and
the Company have determined that it is advisable and in the best interests of
Parent, Merger Sub and the Company, respectively, and the stockholders of
Parent, Merger Sub and the Company, respectively, for Parent and the Company
to engage in a business combination in order to advance their respective
long-term strategic business interests; and

WHEREAS, in furtherance of the foregoing, at the Effective Time (as defined
in Section 1.3) the parties hereto intend to effect a merger of Merger Sub
with and into the Company (the " _Merger_ "), with the Company being the
Surviving Corporation (as defined in Section 1.1), all in accordance with the
General Corporation Law of the State of Delaware (the " _DGCL_ ") and upon the
terms and subject to the conditions set forth herein; and

 

WHEREAS, the respective Boards of Directors of Parent, Merger Sub and the
Company have approved this Agreement and declared the Merger advisable, upon
the terms and subject to the conditions set forth in this Agreement, and
approved the consummation of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement;
and

WHEREAS, subject to the fiduciary duties of the Companys Board of Directors
under applicable Laws (as defined in Section 3.7(a)) and Section 5.4(d), the
Board of Directors of the Company has resolved to recommend to the Companys
stockholders the adoption of this Agreement and approval of the Merger and the
other transactions contemplated hereby, all upon the terms and subject to the
conditions set forth in this Agreement; and 

WHEREAS, concurrently with the execution and delivery of this Agreement and as
a condition and inducement to Parents and Merger Subs willingness to enter
into this Agreement, the stockholders of the Company listed on _Schedule A_
have entered into an agreement with Parent and Merger Sub, dated as of the
date of this Agreement, in the form attached hereto as _Exhibit A_ (the "
_Voting Agreement_ "), pursuant to which such stockholders have, among other
things, agreed to vote all of the shares of voting capital stock of the
Company that such stockholders own in favor of the adoption of this Agreement
and against any Alternative Transaction; and

WHEREAS, immediately following execution of this Agreement, Parent, as the
sole stockholder of Merger Sub, will act by written consent to adopt this
Agreement; and

WHEREAS, Parent, Merger Sub and the Company wish to make certain
representations, warranties, covenants and agreements in connection with the
Merger and to prescribe certain conditions to the consummation of the Merger
as set forth herein; and WHEREAS, for United States federal income Tax purposes, the Merger is intended
to qualify as a reorganization within the meaning of Section 368(a) of the
United States Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the " _Code_ "), and
this Agreement is hereby adopted as a plan of reorganization for purposes
of Section 368 of the Code; and

WHEREAS, terms used but not defined herein shall have the respective meanings
ascribed to such terms in Section 8.15, unless otherwise noted.

NOW THEREFORE, in consideration of the foregoing and the representations,
warranties, covenants and agreements contained herein, and intending to be
legally bound hereby, Parent, Merger Sub and the Company agree as follows:

ARTICLE I

_THE MERGER_

 

Section 1.1 _The Merger_. Upon the terms and subject to the conditions set
forth in this Agreement and in accordance with the DGCL, Merger Sub shall be
merged with and into the Company at the Effective Time. Following the Merger,
the separate corporate existence of Merger Sub shall cease, and the Company
shall continue as the surviving corporation (the " _Surviving Corporation_ ")
and a wholly owned subsidiary of Parent and shall succeed to and assume all
the rights and obligations of Merger Sub in accordance with the DGCL.

Section 1.2 _Closing_.

(a) The closing of the Merger (the " _Closing_ ") shall take place at 10:00
a.m., local time, at the offices of Skadden, Arps, Slate, Meagher and Flom LLP,
Four Times Square, New York, NY 10036, on a date to be specified by Parent and
the Company, which date shall not be later than the third (3rd) Business
Day following the satisfaction or waiver (to the extent permitted by Law) of
all of the conditions to Closing set forth in Article VI of this Agreement
(other than those conditions that by their nature are to be satisfied at the
Closing, but subject to the satisfaction or waiver (to the extent permitted
by Law) of those conditions); _provided_ , _however_ , that if the Commitment
Letter Termination Date has not occurred prior to the end of such third (3rd)
Business Day, then the Closing shall occur as soon as reasonably practicable
after such third (3rd) Business Day referenced above, but in no event later
than the first (1st) Business Day after the final day of the Marketing Period
(as defined in Section 1.2(b)); and _provided_ _further_ that if the
Commitment Letter Termination Date has not occurred prior to the end of such
third (3rd) Business Day referenced above and all or any portion of
the Financing (as defined in Section 4.14) contemplated by the Commitment
Letter (as defined in Section 4.14) becomes unavailable for any reason during
the Marketing Period, then the Closing shall occur as soon as reasonably
practicable after the date on which such Financing becomes unavailable but in
no event later than the later of (i) the first (1st) Business Day after the
final day of the Marketing Period and (ii) the tenth (10th) Business Day
after the date on which the Financing becomes unavailable (the " _Alternative
Financing Marketing Period_ "). Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Closing may
take place at such other

 



2  place, date and time as shall be agreed upon in writing by the parties
hereto. The date on which the Closing takes place shall be referred to herein
as the " _Closing Date_." As used in this Agreement, the term " _Business
Day_ " shall mean any day other than a Saturday, Sunday or a day on which
banks in New York City are authorized or obligated by Law or executive order
to close.

 

(b) For purposes of this Agreement, " _Marketing Period_ " shall mean the
first period of fifteen (15) consecutive Business Days commencing after the
date hereof throughout and on the last day of which (A) Parent shall have (and
its financing sources shall have access to) the Required Information, (B) the
conditions set forth in Section 6.1 shall be satisfied, other than conditions
that by their nature can only be satisfied at Closing, and (C) nothing has
occurred and no condition exists that would cause any of the conditions set
forth in Section 6.2 or Section 6.3 to fail to be satisfied assuming the
Closing were to be scheduled for any time during such fifteen (15) consecutive
Business Day period; _provided_ that if the Marketing Period has not ended on
or prior to December 16, 2011, the Marketing Period shall commence no earlier
than January 3, 2012, and _provided_ _further_ that the "Marketing Period"
shall not be deemed to have commenced if, prior to the completion of the
Marketing Period, (1) the Companys independent accounting firm shall have
withdrawn or qualified its audit opinion with respect to any audited financial
statements contained in the Required Information, (2) the Company shall have
publicly announced any intention to restate any financial information
included in the Required Information or that such restatement is under
consideration, in which case the Marketing Period shall be deemed not to
commence unless and until such restatement has been completed and the
applicable Required Information has been amended or the Company has
determined that no restatement is required, (3) the Company shall have failed
to file with the SEC any report required to be filed with the SEC when due, in
which case the Marketing Period will be deemed not to commence unless and
until such reports have been filed, and (4) the financial statements included
in the Required Information that is available to Parent on the first day of
any such fifteen (15) consecutive Business Day period would be required to be
updated under Rule 3-12 of Regulation S-X in order to be sufficiently current
on any day during such fifteen (15) consecutive Business Day period to permit
a registration statement using such financial statements to be declared
effective by the SEC on the last day of such fifteen (15) consecutive Business
Day period or to enable the Companys accountants to provide a customary
comfort letter at such time, in which case the Marketing Period shall not be
deemed to commence until the receipt by Parent of updated Required Information
that would be required under Rule 3-12 of Regulation S-X to permit a
registration statement using such financial statements to be
declared effective by the SEC on the last day of such new fifteen (15)
consecutive Business Day period or to enable the Companys accountants to
provide a customary comfort letter at such time. For purposes of calculating
the length of the Marketing Period, a Business Day shall not include November
25, 2011.

Section 1.3 _Effective Time_. Subject to the provisions of this Agreement, as
promptly as practicable on the Closing Date, the Company shall file with the
Secretary of State of the State of Delaware a certificate of merger (the "
_Certificate of Merger_ ") executed and acknowledged by the Company in
accordance with the relevant provisions of the DGCL and, as promptly as
practicable on or after the Closing Date, the parties shall make all other
filings or recordings required under the DGCL. The Merger shall
become effective upon the filing of the Certificate of Merger with the
Secretary of State of the State of

 



3  Delaware, or at such later date and time as Parent and the Company shall
agree and shall specify in the Certificate of Merger (the date and time that
the Merger becomes effective being the " _Effective Time_ ").

Section 1.4 _Effects of the Merger_. At and after the Effective Time, the
Merger shall have the effects set forth in this Agreement and the applicable
provisions of the DGCL. Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, and
subject thereto, at the Effective Time all the property, rights, privileges,
powers and franchises of Merger Sub and the Company shall vest in the
Surviving Corporation, and all debts, liabilities and duties of Merger Sub and
the Company shall become the debts, liabilities and duties of the Surviving
Corporation.

 

Section 1.5 _Certificate of Incorporation and Bylaws of the Surviving
Corporation_.

 

(a) At the Effective Time, the certificate of incorporation of the Company
shall be amended to read in its entirety as set forth in  _Annex I_ hereto
and, as so amended, shall be the certificate of incorporation of the Surviving
Corporation until thereafter changed or amended as provided by the DGCL or
therein.

 

(b) At the Effective Time, the bylaws of Merger Sub, as in effect immediately
prior to the Effective Time, shall become, subject to Section 5.11, the
bylaws of the Surviving Corporation, until thereafter changed or amended as
provided by the DGCL, the certificate of incorporation of the Surviving
Corporation or such bylaws, except that as of the Effective Time, such
bylaws shall be amended to reflect the name of the Company (or a variation
thereof) as the name of the Surviving Corporation.

 

Section 1.6 _Board of Directors; Officers_. The directors constituting the
Board of Directors of Merger Sub immediately prior to the Effective Time
shall, from and after the Effective Time, be the persons constituting the
Board of Directors of the Surviving Corporation, until the earlier of their
death, resignation or removal or until their respective successors are duly
elected and qualified, as the case may be. The officers of the Company
immediately prior to the Effective Time shall, from and after the Effective
Time, be the officers of the Surviving Corporation, until the earlier of their
death, resignation or removal or until their respective successors are duly
elected and qualified, as the case may be.

Section 1.7 _Subsequent Actions_. If, at any time after the Effective Time,
the Surviving Corporation shall determine or be advised that any deeds, bills
of sale, assignments, assurances or any other actions or things are necessary
or desirable to vest, perfect or confirm of record or otherwise in the
Surviving Corporation its right, title or interest in, to or under any of the
rights, properties or assets of either of the Company or Merger Sub acquired
or to be acquired by the Surviving Corporation as a result of, or in
connection with, the Merger or otherwise to carry out this Agreement, the
officers and directors of the Surviving Corporation shall be authorized to
execute and deliver, in the name and on behalf of either the Company or Merger
Sub, all such deeds, bills of sale, assignments and assurances and to take
and do, in the name and on behalf of each of such corporations or otherwise,
all such other actions and things as may be necessary or desirable to vest,
perfect or confirm any and all right, title and interest in, to and

 



4  under such rights, properties or assets in the Surviving Corporation or
otherwise to carry out this Agreement.

ARTICLE II

_CONVERSION OF SHARES; EXCHANGE OF CERTIFICATES_  

Section 2.1 _Effect on Stock_. At the Effective Time, by virtue of the Merger
and without any action on the part of the Company, Parent, Merger Sub or the
holders of any securities of the Company or Merger Sub:

(a) _Conversion of Company Common Stock_. Each issued and outstanding share
(other than shares to be cancelled in accordance with Section 2.1(b)) of
common stock, par value $0.01 per share, of the Company (" _Company Common
Stock_ ") shall be converted into and shall thereafter represent the right to
receive 0.460 fully paid and non-assessable shares (as the same may be
adjusted pursuant to Section 2.1(d), the " _Exchange Ratio_ ") of Parent
Common Stock (the " _Merger_ _Consideration_ "). All such shares of Company
Common Stock, when so converted, shall no longer be outstanding and shall
automatically be cancelled and shall cease to exist, and each holder of shares
of Company Common Stock represented by book-entry (" _Company Book-Entry
Shares_ ") or certificates that immediately prior to the Effective Time
represented shares of Company Common Stock (" _Certificates_ ") shall cease to
have any rights with respect thereto except the right to receive the Merger
Consideration, any cash in lieu of fractional shares of Parent Common Stock to
be issued or paid in consideration therefor and any dividends or other
distributions to which such holder shall become entitled upon surrender of
such Certificates or Company Book-Entry Shares, without interest.

(b) _Company, Parent and Merger Sub-Owned Shares_. Each share of Company
Common Stock that is issued and held by the Company or any of the Companys
direct or indirect wholly owned Subsidiaries, and each share of Company Common
Stock that is owned by Parent or Merger Sub, or their respective direct or
indirect wholly owned Subsidiaries, immediately prior to the Effective Time
shall automatically be cancelled and retired and shall cease to exist, and no
consideration shall be issued or delivered in exchange therefor.

(c) _Merger Sub Common Stock_. Each issued and outstanding share of common
stock, par value $0.01 per share, of Merger Sub shall be converted into one
validly issued fully paid and non-assessable share of common stock, par value
$0.01 per share, of the Surviving Corporation.

 

(d) _Adjustments_. If at any time during the period between the date of this
Agreement and the Effective Time, any change in the outstanding shares of
capital stock of Parent or the Company shall occur as a result of any
reclassification, recapitalization, stock split (including a reverse stock
split) or combination, exchange or readjustment of shares, or any stock
dividend or stock distribution with a record date during such period, the
Merger Consideration, the Exchange Ratio and any other similarly dependent
items shall be equitably adjusted to

 



5  provide to Parent, Merger Sub and the holders of Company Common Stock the
same economic effect as contemplated by this Agreement prior to such action;
_provided_ , _however_ , that nothing contained in this Section 2.1(d) shall
be deemed to permit any action that Parent or the Company is otherwise
prohibited from taking pursuant to this Agreement.

Section 2.2 _Exchange of Certificates_.

(a) _Exchange Agent_. Not less than ten (10) Business Days prior to the
mailing of the Proxy Statement (as defined in Section 3.12), Parent shall
designate a bank or trust company to act as exchange agent hereunder (the "
_Exchange Agent_ "), which Exchange Agent shall be reasonably acceptable to
the Company, for the purpose of exchanging Certificates and Company Book-Entry
Shares in accordance with the terms of this Agreement.

(b) _Deposit of Merger Consideration_. From time to time as needed, at or
after the Effective Time, Parent shall deposit with the Exchange Agent, for
the benefit of the equity holders of the Company entitled to receive the
Merger Consideration pursuant to this Agreement, (i) certificates or, at
Parents option, evidence of shares in book-entry form, representing shares of
Parent Common Stock (the " _Parent Certificates_ ") equal to the aggregate
Merger Consideration in such denominations as the Exchange Agent may
reasonably specify and (ii) cash sufficient to make payments in lieu of
fractional shares of Parent Common Stock pursuant to Section 2.2(f). Such
Parent Certificates and such cash so deposited, together with any dividends or
distributions with respect thereto, are hereinafter referred to as the "
_Exchange Fund_."

 

(c) _Exchange Procedures_.

(i) As soon as reasonably practicable after the Effective Time and in any
event not later than the second (2nd) Business Day following the Effective
Time, the Exchange Agent shall mail to each holder of record of a Certificate
or Company Book-Entry Shares whose shares were converted into the right to
receive the Merger Consideration pursuant to Section 2.1(a), (i) a letter of
transmittal in such form and having such other provisions as the Company and

title to the Certificates, if applicable, shall pass, only upon delivery of
the Certificates (or appropriate affidavits of loss in lieu thereof) to the
Exchange Agent), and (ii) instructions for use in effecting the surrender of
the Certificates (or appropriate affidavits of loss in lieu thereof) or

Company Book-Entry Shares, as applicable, representing Company Common Stock
together with a letter of transmittal, duly completed and validly executed in
accordance with the instructions thereto, and such other documents as may
customarily be required by the Exchange Agent, shall be entitled to receive
in exchange therefor, the following:

 



6 (A) the number of whole shares of Parent Common Stock, if any, into
which such holders shares of Company Common Stock represented by such
holders properly surrendered Certificates (or appropriate affidavits of loss
in lieu thereof) or Company Book-Entry Shares, as applicable, were converted
in accordance with this Article II, and such Certificates or Company Book-
Entry Shares so surrendered shall be forthwith cancelled, and

(B) a check in an amount of U.S. dollars (after giving effect to any required
withholdings pursuant to this Section 2.2(c)) equal to the amount of cash that
such holder has the right to receive in lieu of fractional shares of Parent
Common Stock pursuant to Section 2.2(f).

(ii) In the event of a transfer of ownership of Company Common Stock that is
not registered in the transfer records of the Company, a Parent Certificate
representing the proper number of shares of Parent Common Stock may be issued
to a person other than the person in whose name the Certificate or Company
Book-Entry Shares so surrendered are registered if such Certificate (if
applicable) shall be properly endorsed or otherwise be in proper form for
transfer and the person requesting such issuance shall pay any transfer or
other non-income Taxes (as defined in Section 3.15(k)) required by reason of
the issuance of shares of Parent Common Stock to a person other than the
registered holder of such Certificate or Company Book-Entry Shares or
establish to the reasonable satisfaction of Parent that any such Tax has been
paid or is not applicable.

(iii) Parent or the Exchange Agent shall be entitled to deduct and withhold
from the consideration otherwise payable under this Agreement to any holder of
Company Common Stock such amounts as Parent or the Exchange Agent are required
to withhold or deduct under the Code or any provision of federal, state,
local or foreign Laws regarding Taxes with respect to the making of such
payment. To the extent that amounts are so withheld by Parent or the Exchange
Agent, such withheld amounts shall be treated for all purposes of this
Agreement as having been paid to the holder of Company Common Stock in respect
of whom such deduction and withholding were made by Parent or the Exchange
Agent.

 

(iv) Until surrendered as contemplated by this Section 2.2, each Certificate
or Company Book-Entry Share shall be deemed at any time after the Effective
Time to represent only the right to receive upon such surrender the applicable
Merger Consideration as contemplated by this Article II and cash, if any, in
lieu of any fractional share of Parent Common Stock in accordance with
Section 2.2(f).

 



7 (v) No interest will be paid or will accrue on any cash payable to holders of
Certificates or Company Book-Entry Shares under the provisions of this Article
II.

(d) _Distributions with Respect to Unexchanged Shares_.

(i) No dividends or other distributions with respect to Parent Common Stock
with a record date on or after the Effective Time, or that are payable to the
holders of record thereof who become such on or after the Effective Time,
shall be paid to the holder of any unsurrendered Certificate or Company Book-
Entry Shares until such Certificate or Company Book-Entry Shares are
surrendered as provided in this Article II. All such dividends, other
distributions and cash in lieu of fractional shares of Parent Common Stock
that are to be paid in respect of the shares of Parent Common Stock to be
received upon surrender of such Certificate or Company Book-Entry Shares shall
be paid by Parent to the Exchange Agent and shall be included in the Exchange
Fund, in each case until the surrender of such Certificate or Company Book-
Entry Shares in accordance with this Article II.

(ii) Subject to the effect of applicable abandoned property, escheat or
similar Laws and Laws with respect to the withholding of Taxes, following
surrender of any such Certificate or Company Book-Entry Shares there shall be

of Parent Common Stock issued in exchange therefor, without interest, (i) at
the time of such surrender, the amount of dividends or other distributions
with a record date after the Effective Time previously paid with respect to
such whole shares of Parent Common Stock and the amount of any cash payable
in lieu of a fractional share of Parent Common Stock to which such holder is
entitled pursuant to Section 2.2(f) and (ii) at the appropriate payment date,
the amount of dividends or other distributions with a record date after the
Effective Time but prior to such surrender and with a payment date subsequent
to such surrender payable with respect to such whole shares of Parent Common
Stock. Parent shall make available to the Exchange Agent sufficient cash for
the purpose of satisfying its obligations under clause (i) of the immediately
preceding sentence.

(e) _No Further Ownership Rights in Company Common Stock_. The transfer of
shares of Parent Common Stock issued upon the surrender of Certificates or
Company Book-Entry Shares for the applicable Merger Consideration in
accordance with the terms of this Article II (including any cash paid in lieu
of fractional shares of Parent Common Stock pursuant to Section 2.2(f)) shall
be deemed payment in full satisfaction of all rights pertaining to the shares
of Company Common Stock previously represented by such Certificates or Company
Book-Entry Shares.

(f) _No Fractional Shares_.

(i) No Parent Certificates or scrip representing fractional shares of Parent
Common Stock shall be issued upon the surrender for exchange

 



8  of Certificates or Company Book-Entry Shares, no dividend or distribution of
Parent shall relate to such fractional share interests, and such fractional
share interests will not entitle the owner thereof to vote or to any rights
of a stockholder of Parent.

(ii) As promptly as practicable following the Effective Time, the Surviving
Corporation shall pay to the Exchange Agent, for the benefit of each holder of
record of Company Common Stock, an amount in cash, if any, equal to the
product obtained by multiplying (A) the fractional share interest to which
such holder (after taking into account all shares of Company Common Stock held
at the Effective Time by such holder) would otherwise be entitled by (B) the
closing price for a share of Parent Common Stock as reported on The NASDAQ
Stock Market LLC (" _NASDAQ_ ") (as reported in _The Wall Street Journal_ ,
or, if not reported thereby, any other authoritative source) on the day of the
Effective Time. To the extent that the Exchange Agent shall sell shares of
Parent Common Stock included in the Exchange Fund in order to satisfy Parents
obligation to pay cash in lieu of fractional shares of Parent Common Stock,
Parent shall pay any commissions, transfer Taxes and other out-of-
pocket transaction costs in connection with such sale, if any.

(g) _Termination of Exchange Fund_. Any portion of the Exchange Fund that
remains undistributed to the holders of the Certificates or Company Book-Entry
Shares for one year after the Effective Time shall be delivered to Parent upon
demand, and any holders of the Certificates or Company Book-Entry Shares who
have not theretofore complied with this Article II shall thereafter look only
to Parent for payment of, and only as a general creditor thereof, their claim
for Merger Consideration, any cash in lieu of fractional shares of Parent
Common Stock and any dividends or distributions with respect to Parent Common
Stock.

(h) _Closing of Transfer Books_. At the Effective Time, the stock transfer
books of the Company shall be closed, and there shall be no further
registration of transfers on the transfer books of the Surviving Corporation

for any reason, they shall be cancelled and exchanged as provided in this
Section 2.2.

 

(i) _No Liability_. None of the Company, Parent, Merger Sub, the Surviving
Corporation or the Exchange Agent shall be liable to any person in respect of
any shares of Parent Common Stock (or dividends or distributions with respect
thereto) or cash from the Exchange Fund, in each case, delivered to a public
official pursuant to any applicable abandoned property, escheat or similar
Law. If any Certificate or Company Book-Entry Shares shall not have been
surrendered prior to such date on which any Merger Consideration, any cash in
lieu of fractional shares of Parent Common Stock payable to the holder of such
Certificate or Company Book-Entry Shares pursuant to this Article II or any
dividends or distributions with respect to Parent Common Stock payable to the
holder of such Certificate or Company Book-Entry Shares would otherwise
escheat to or become the property of any Governmental Entity, any such Merger
Consideration or cash, dividends or distributions in respect of such
Certificate or Company Book-Entry Shares shall immediately prior to such time,
to the extent permitted by 

 



9  applicable Law, become the property of the Surviving Corporation, and any
holders of the Certificates or Company Book-Entry Shares who have not
theretofore complied with this Article II shall thereafter look only to
Parent for payment of, and only as a general creditor thereof, their claim for
Merger Consideration, any cash in lieu of fractional shares of Parent Common
Stock and any dividends or distributions with respect to Parent Common Stock
(in each case, without interest and subject to abandoned property, escheat,
and other similar Laws). Any Merger Consideration, any cash in lieu of
fractional shares of Parent Common Stock and any dividends or distributions
with respect to Parent Common Stock remaining unclaimed as of a date which is
immediately prior to such time as such amounts would otherwise escheat to or
become the property of any Governmental Entity shall, to the extent permitted
by applicable Law, become the property of the Surviving Corporation free and
clear of any claims or interests of any person previously entitled thereto.

 

(j) _Investment of Exchange Fund_. The Exchange Agent shall invest all cash
included in the Exchange Fund as directed by Parent. Any interest and other
income resulting from such investments shall be paid to Parent.

stolen or destroyed, upon the making of an appropriate affidavit of that fact
by the person claiming such Certificate to be lost, stolen or destroyed and,
if required by Parent or the Exchange Agent, the provision by such person of
an indemnity, in form and substance reasonably satisfactory to Parent or the
Exchange Agent, against any claim that may be made against it with respect to
such Certificate, the Exchange Agent will issue in exchange for such lost,
stolen or destroyed Certificate the Merger Consideration and, if applicable,
any cash in lieu of fractional shares of Parent Common Stock, and unpaid
dividends and distributions with respect to shares of Parent Common Stock
deliverable in accordance with this Article II in respect thereof.

Section 2.3 _Treatment of Equity-Based Grants_.

 

(a) _Stock Options_. At the Effective Time, each outstanding unexpired and
unexercised option to purchase or acquire a share of Company Common Stock
under the Company Equity Plans (each, a " _Company Stock Option_ "), whether
vested or unvested, shall be assumed by Parent and converted into an option to
purchase the number of shares of Parent Common Stock equal to the product of
(x) the Exchange Ratio multiplied by (y) the number of shares of Company
Common Stock which could have been obtained prior to the Effective Time upon
the exercise of each such Company Stock Option (with the product rounded down
to the nearest whole share), at an exercise price per share (rounded up to the
nearest cent) equal to the exercise price for each such share of Company
Common Stock subject to a Company Stock Option divided by the Exchange Ratio,
and all references to the Company in each award agreement or other document
evidencing such Company Stock Option shall be deemed to refer to Parent, where
appropriate. The other pre-existing terms of such Company Stock Options,
including vesting, shall continue to apply in accordance with their terms.
Each Company Stock Option assumed and converted pursuant to the terms of this
Section 2.3(a) shall be referred to as a " _Parent Exchange Option_." The
number of shares subject to any Parent Exchange Option and the exercise price
per share of such Parent Exchange Option shall be determined in a manner which
would not result in the

 



10  conversion of Company Stock Options into Parent Exchange Options being
treated as a new grant of stock options under Section 409A of the Code, and
the Company and Parent shall agree upon any adjustments to this Section
2.3(a) necessary to avoid such new grant of stock options.

(b) _Restricted Stock Units_. Except as set forth in Section 2.3(b) of the
Company Disclosure Letter, as of the Effective Time, each outstanding right to
receive Company Common Stock pursuant to a stock unit award granted under any
Company Equity Plan (each, a " _Restricted Stock Unit Award_ ") shall be
assumed by Parent and converted into a restricted stock unit with respect to a
number of shares of Parent Common Stock determined by multiplying the number
of shares of Company Common Stock subject to such Restricted Stock Unit Award
by the Exchange Ratio (with the product rounded down to the nearest whole
share). The other pre-existing terms of such Restricted Stock Unit Awards,
including vesting, shall continue to apply in accordance with their terms.
Each Restricted Stock Unit Award assumed and converted pursuant to the terms
of this Section 2.3(b) shall be referred to as a " _Parent Exchange Unit_."

 

(c) _Employee Stock Purchase Plans_. The Company shall take all actions
necessary, subject to applicable Law, pursuant to the terms of the Companys
Employee Stock Purchase Plan (the " _ESPP_ ") in order to (i) ensure that no
offering periods under the ESPP commence after the date hereof, (ii) if
necessary, shorten the offering period under the ESPP in effect at the
Effective Time (the " _Current Offering_ "), such that the Current Offering
shall terminate immediately prior to the Effective Time, (iii) if the action
specified in clause (ii) above is necessary, permit participants in the ESPP
to exercise, effective as of immediately prior to the Effective Time, any
purchase rights existing immediately prior to the Effective Time under the
ESPP to acquire shares of Company Common Stock at the purchase price
set forth in the ESPP, and (iv) refund to participants in the ESPP the funds
that remain in the participants accounts after any such purchase. The Company
shall take any and all actions (but subject to compliance with the terms and
conditions of awards and applicable Law in jurisdictions outside the United
States) as may be necessary to terminate the ESPP as of the Effective Time.

(d) _Warrants_. At the Effective Time, (i) each outstanding unexpired and
unexercised warrant to purchase or acquire a share of Company Common Stock
under the Company Agent Plans (each, an " _Agent Plan Warrant_ ") and (ii)
each other outstanding unexpired and unexercised warrant (each, a " _Non-Plan
Warrant_ ") to purchase or acquire a share of Company Common Stock (each Agent
Plan Warrant and each Non-Plan Warrant, a " _Company Warrant_ "), whether or
not then vested, shall be assumed by Parent and converted into a warrant to
purchase the number of shares of Parent Common Stock equal to the product of
(x) the Exchange Ratio multiplied by (y) the number of shares of Company
Common Stock underlying such Company Warrant (with the product rounded down to
the nearest whole share), at an exercise price per share (rounded up to the
nearest cent) equal to the exercise price for each such share of Company
Common Stock subject to such Company Warrant divided by the Exchange Ratio,
and all references to the Company in such Company Warrant shall be deemed to
refer to Parent, where appropriate. The other pre-existing terms of such
Company Warrants, including vesting, shall continue to apply in accordance
with their terms. Each Company Warrant assumed and

 



11  converted pursuant to the terms of this Section 2.3(d) shall be referred to
as a " _Parent Exchange Warrant_."

 

(e) _Manner of Effecting_. Prior to the Effective Time, the Company shall take
all actions necessary to effect the provisions of this Section 2.3 (other
than actions expressly required of Parent), including obtaining any required
consents. In connection with the issuance of Parent Exchange Options, Parent
Exchange Units and Parent Exchange Warrants, Parent shall assume each Company
Equity Plan. Prior to the Effective Time, Parent shall take all corporate
action necessary to reserve for issuance a sufficient number of shares of
Parent Common Stock for delivery in connection with the exercise or settlement
of the Parent Exchange Options, Parent Exchange Units and Parent Exchange
Warrants. As soon as reasonably practicable after the Effective Time, Parent
shall (i) issue to each holder of Parent Exchange Options, Parent Exchange
Units and Parent Exchange Warrants documents evidencing the assumption
pursuant to this Section 2.3 of the applicable Company Stock Options,
Restricted Stock Unit Awards and Company Warrants, (ii) issue appropriate
notices setting forth such holders rights pursuant to the foregoing
securities, including the effect of the Merger on such securities, (iii) file
a registration statement on Form S-8 (or any successor form) with the SEC with
respect to the shares of Parent Common Stock subject to Parent Exchange
Options and Parent Exchange Units, and (iv) file a registration statement with
the SEC on another appropriate form that Parent is eligible to use with
respect to the shares of Parent Common Stock subject to Parent
Exchange Warrants issued upon conversion of the Agent Plan Warrants.

such person to consummate the Merger in the manner contemplated hereby prior
to the Outside Date; _provided_ , _however_ , that no Effect caused by or

accumulated and communicated to the Companys management as appropriate to
allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure and to make the
certifications required pursuant to Sections 302 and 906 of the Sarbanes-

Section 3.21 _Regulatory Matters_.

(a) The Company and the Companys Subsidiaries hold all permits, approvals,
authorizations, certificates, registrations and licenses set forth in Section
3.21(a) of the Company Disclosure Letter issued by the FCC or the state
public service or public utility commissions or other similar state regulatory
bodies (" _State PSCs_ "), and all other material regulatory permits,
approvals, licenses and other authorizations, including franchises,
ordinances and other agreements granting access to public rights of way,
issued or granted to the Company or any of its Subsidiaries by a Governmental
Entity (the " _Company Licenses_ ") that are required for the Company
and each Subsidiary of the Company to conduct its business, as presently
conducted, except where the failure to hold Company Licenses has not had, and
would not reasonably be expected to have, individually or in the aggregate, a
Material Adverse Effect on the Company.

(b) Each Company License is valid and in full force and effect and has not
been suspended, revoked, cancelled or adversely modified, except where the
failure thereof to be in full force and effect, or the suspension, revocation,
cancellation or modification thereof, has not had, and would not reasonably be
expected to have, individually or in the aggregate, a Material Adverse Effect
on the Company. No Company License is subject to (i) any conditions or
requirements that have not been imposed generally upon licenses in the same
service, unless such conditions or requirements are set forth on the face of
the applicable authorization or have not had, and would not reasonably be
expected to have, individually or in the aggregate, a Material Adverse Effect
on the Company, or (ii) any pending proceeding by or before the FCC or State
PSCs to suspend, revoke or cancel such Company License, or any judicial review
of a decision by the FCC or State PSCs with respect thereto, unless such
pending proceeding or judicial review has not had, and would not reasonably be
expected to have, individually or in the aggregate, a Material Adverse Effect
on the Company. The Company has no knowledge of any event, condition or
circumstance that would preclude any Company License from being renewed in the
ordinary course (to the extent that such Company License is renewable by its
terms), except where the failure thereof to be renewed has not had, and would
not reasonably be expected to have, individually or in the aggregate, a
Material Adverse Effect on the Company.

 

(c) The licensee of each Company License is in compliance with such Company
License and has fulfilled and performed all of its obligations with respect
thereto, including all reports, notifications and applications required by the
Communications Act of 1934, as amended (the " _Communications Act_ "), or the
rules, regulations, written policies and orders of the FCC (together with the
Communications Act, the " _FCC Rules_ ") or similar state telecommunications
laws (the " _State Telecommunications Laws_ ") and the rules, regulations,
written policies and orders of State PSCs (collectively with the State
Telecommunications Laws, the, " _PSC Rules_ "), and the payment of all
regulatory fees and contributions, except (i) for exemptions, waivers or
similar concessions or allowances and (ii) where such failure of such

 



34  licensee to be in compliance, fulfill or perform its obligations or pay such
fees or contributions has not had, and would not reasonably be expected to
have, individually or in the aggregate, a Material Adverse Effect on the
Company.

(d) Section 3.21(d) of the Company Disclosure Letter sets forth a list of
all material regulatory permits, approvals, authorizations, certificates,
registrations and licenses issued or granted to the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries by the FCC or any PSC, in each case, that constitute Company
Licenses, together with the name of the entity holding such Company License.
The Company or a wholly owned Subsidiary of the Company directly or indirectly
owns one hundred percent (100%) of the equity interests and controls one
hundred percent (100%) of the voting power and decision-making authority of
each licensee of the Company Licenses, except where the failure to own such
equity or control such voting power and decision making authority of such
licensees has not had, and would not reasonably be expected to have,
individually or in the aggregate, a Material Adverse Effect on the Company. No
Company License, order or other agreement, obtained from, issued by or
concluded with any State PSC would impose restrictions of the ability of any
Subsidiary of the Company to make payments, dividends or other distributions
to the Company or any other Subsidiary of the Company that limits, or would
reasonably be expected to limit, the cash funding and management alternatives
of the Company on a consolidated basis in a manner disproportionate to
restrictions applied by other State PSCs.

(e) The Company does not have knowledge of any facts that would materially
impair, delay or preclude the Companys ability to obtain any Governmental
Consents.

 

(f) The Company is not aware of any pending FCC, FERC or State PSC regulatory
proceeding that has had or would reasonably be expected to have, individually
or in the aggregate, a Material Adverse Effect on the Company.

hereof, all transactions, agreements, arrangements or understandings between
the Company and the Companys affiliates or other persons (" _Company
Affiliate Transactions_ ") that are required to be disclosed in the Company
SEC Documents in accordance with Item 404 of the SECs Regulation S-K have
been so disclosed.

unanimously adopted a resolution or resolutions approving this Agreement, the
Merger and the other transactions contemplated hereby, and, assuming the
accuracy of Parents representation and warranty contained in Section 4.11,
such approval constitutes approval of the Merger and the other transactions
contemplated hereby by the Board of Directors of the Company under the
provisions of Section 203 of the DGCL, such that the restrictions on business
combinations contained in Section 203 of the DGCL do not apply to
this Agreement and the Merger or the other transactions contemplated hereby.

203 of the DGCL (which has been rendered inapplicable) is applicable to the
Merger or the other transactions contemplated hereby.

all material policies of insurance maintained by the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries. Such

 



35  policies are in full force and effect and all premiums due with respect to
such policies have either been paid or adequate provision for the payment by
the Company or one of its Subsidiaries thereof has been made, except for such
failures to be in full force and effect or to pay such premiums as have not
had and would not reasonably be expected to have, either individually or in
the aggregate, a Material Adverse Effect on the Company. 

Section 3.25 _Finders or Brokers_. Except for Bank of America Merrill Lynch,
Deutsche Bank Securities Inc. and Houlihan Lokey Financial Advisors, Inc., a
copy of each of whose engagement agreement has been provided to Parent,
neither the Company nor any of its Subsidiaries has employed any investment
banker, broker or finder in connection with the transactions contemplated by
this Agreement who might be entitled to any fee or any commission in
connection with or upon consummation of the Merger.

Subsidiaries is party to any agreement other than the Company Benefit Plans

or similar agreement involving, or settled by reference to, one or more rates,

pricing risk or value or any similar transaction or any combination of these
transactions.

all of its leased properties, free and clear of all Liens. Except as would
not reasonably be expected to have, individually or in the aggregate, a
Material Adverse Effect on the Company, (a) all leases under which the Company

force and effect against the Company or such Subsidiary and, to the knowledge
of the Company, the counterparties thereto, in accordance with their
respective terms, and (b) there is not, under any of such leases, any
existing default by the Company or any of its Subsidiaries which, with notice

any of its Subsidiaries is a party, in respect of real property leased by the
Company or any of its Subsidiaries are in full force and effect, neither the

and its Subsidiaries: (i) a list of all switch locations of the Company and

36  condition and repair, ordinary wear and tear excepted. With respect to each
Network Facility, except as set forth on Section 3.27(c) of the Company
Disclosure Letter, to the knowledge of the Company, any notices or other

refinance amounts anticipated to be outstanding under the Companys credit
facilities on the Closing Date and to consummate the Merger. As of the date of

47  occurrence of the Commitment Letter Termination Date, as set forth in the

a reorganization within the meaning of Section 368(a) of the Code, including
providing the representations, covenants and certificates referred to in
Sections 5.5(d)(iii) and 6.1(i) of this Agreement.

(b) Each of the Company and Parent shall report the Merger as a
reorganization within the meaning of Section 368(a) of the Code on its United
States federal income Tax return, unless otherwise required pursuant to a
"determination" within the meaning of Section 1313(a) of the Code.

 

(c) Each Tax Counsel (as defined in Section 5.5) shall be entitled to rely
upon representation letters from each of the Company, Parent, Merger Sub and
others, in each case, substantially in the form attached hereto as _Exhibit C_

5.5). Each such representation letter shall be dated as of the date of the
Tax Opinion.

Section 5.3 _Investigation_.

 

(a) The Company shall afford to Parent and to its officers, employees,
accountants, consultants, legal counsel, financial advisors and agents and
other representatives (collectively, " _Representatives_ ") reasonable access
during normal business hours, throughout the period prior to the earlier of
the Effective Time or the Termination Date, to its and its Subsidiaries
properties, contracts, commitments, books and records and any report, schedule
or other document filed or received by it pursuant to the requirements of
federal or state securities Laws and shall use all commercially
reasonable efforts to cause its Representatives to furnish promptly to Parent
such additional financial and operating data and other information as to its
and its Subsidiaries respective businesses and properties as Parent or its
Representatives may from time to time reasonably request (including
furnishing to Parent the Companys financial results in advance of filing any
Company SEC Documents containing such financial results), except that (i)
nothing herein shall require the Company or any of its Subsidiaries to
disclose any information to Parent that would cause a violation of any
agreement to which the Company is a party, would cause a risk of a loss of
privilege to the Company, or would constitute a violation of applicable Laws,
and (ii) in no event shall such access include the right to conduct
environmental testing or sampling of any kind without the Companys prior
written approval, which it may grant or withhold in its sole discretion.
Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, the Company shall use
commercially reasonable efforts

 



57  to provide to Parent copies of the financial and operating monthly reports

practicable after such reports become available following the completion of
each fiscal month of the Company occurring after the date hereof and prior to
the Effective Time.

(b) Parent shall afford the Company and its Representatives reasonable access
during normal business hours, throughout the period prior to the earlier of
the Effective Time or the Termination Date, to its and its Subsidiaries
properties, contracts, commitments, books and records at a level consistent
with such access provided for due diligence purposes prior to the date of this
Agreement or, in the event of a material change or development with respect
to Parent or its Subsidiaries (regardless of whether the underlying facts or
circumstances were previously disclosed to the Company or its Representatives
prior to the date of this Agreement), at a level reasonable under all of
the circumstances, except that nothing herein shall require Parent or any of
its Subsidiaries to disclose any information to the Company that would cause a
violation of any agreement to which Parent is a party, would cause a risk of a
loss of privilege to Parent, or would constitute a violation of applicable
Laws.

(c) The Company shall cooperate and participate, as reasonably requested by
Parent from time to time, in Parents efforts to oversee the integration of
the parties operations in connection with, and taking effect upon
consummation of, the Merger subject to applicable Law, including, without
limitation, providing such reports on operational matters and participating on
such teams and committees as Parent may reasonably request (including customer
billing and other data files for the purpose of system integration and testing
as well as compensation and payroll data files for the purpose of payroll
system integration and testing with respect to employees of the Company and
its Subsidiaries).

(d) The parties agree that each of them will treat any information received
pursuant to this Section 5.3 in accordance with the Non-Disclosure Agreement
between the Company and Parent, dated September 18, 2009, as amended on June
16, 2011 (the " _Non-Disclosure Agreement_ "). No representation as to the
accuracy of any information provided pursuant to this Section 5.3 is made, and
the parties may not rely on the accuracy of any such information other than
as expressly set forth in the representations and warranties in Articles III
and IV. No information obtained pursuant to this Section 5.3 shall be deemed
to modify any representation or warranty in Articles III or IV.

Section 5.4 _No Solicitation_.

 

(a) _No Solicitation_. The Company shall not, nor shall it permit any of its
Subsidiaries to, authorize or permit any of its officers, directors or
employees to, and shall use its reasonable best efforts to cause any
investment banker, financial advisor, attorney, accountant or other
representative retained by it or any of its Subsidiaries to not, directly, or
indirectly, (i) solicit or knowingly encourage (including by way of
furnishing any nonpublic information to any person) any inquiries with respect
to, or the making, submission or announcement of, any Alternative Transaction
Proposal (as defined in Section 5.4(f)(ii)), (ii) engage in any negotiations
concerning or furnish to any person (other than the parties to this Agreement
and their representatives) any information with respect to any possible
Alternative Transaction Proposal (except to disclose the existence of the
provisions of this Section 5.4), (iii) withdraw or modify,

 



58  or publicly propose to withdraw or modify, the Company Board Recommendation
(as defined in Section 5.5(c)) in a manner adverse to Parent (except to the
extent specifically permitted pursuant to Section 5.4(d)), (iv) approve,
endorse or recommend, or publicly propose to approve or recommend, any
Alternative Transaction (as defined in Section 5.4(f)(i)) (except to the
extent specifically permitted pursuant to Section 5.4(d)) (any of the actions
referred to in the foregoing clauses (iii) or (iv), whether taken by the
Companys Board of Directors or a committee thereof, an " _Adverse
Recommendation Change_ "), (v) enter into any letter of intent, agreement in
principle or similar document or any contract, agreement or commitment
(whether binding or not) contemplating or otherwise relating to any
Alternative Transaction Proposal, other than a confidentiality agreement that
the Company is permitted to enter into under Section 5.4(c), or (vi) take any
action to exempt any person (other than Parent or its Subsidiaries) or any
action taken by such person from any state takeover statute
(including Section 203 of the DGCL) or similarly restrictive provisions of
the Company Organizational Documents. The Company and its Subsidiaries shall
immediately cease, and shall cause its officers, directors and employees and
instruct any investment banker, financial advisor, attorney, accountant or
other representative retained by it to cease, any and all existing activities,
discussions or negotiations with any third parties conducted heretofore with
respect to any Alternative Transaction Proposal, and will use its
commercially reasonable efforts to enforce (and will not waive, terminate or
modify any provisions of) any confidentiality or standstill agreement (or any
similar agreement) relating to any such Alternative Transaction Proposal,
including by requesting the other party thereto to promptly return or destroy
any confidential information previously furnished thereto and using
commercially reasonable efforts to obtain injunctions or other equitable
remedies to prevent or restrain any breaches of such agreements and to
enforce specifically the terms thereof, except to the extent that the Board of
Directors of the Company concludes in good faith (after consultation with its
financial advisors and outside legal advisors) that enforcement of any such
confidentiality or standstill agreement (or similar agreement) would be
inconsistent with its fiduciary duties under applicable Law.

(b) _Notification of Alternative Transaction Proposals_. As promptly as
practicable (and in any event within two (2) Business Days) after receipt of
any Alternative Transaction Proposal or any request for nonpublic information
or inquiry that would reasonably be expected to lead to an Alternative
Transaction Proposal, the Company shall provide Parent with oral and written
notice of the material terms and conditions of such Alternative Transaction
Proposal, request or inquiry, and the identity of the person or group of
persons making any such Alternative Transaction Proposal, request or inquiry
and a copy of all written materials provided to it in connection with such
Alternative Transaction Proposal, request or inquiry. In addition, the
Company shall provide Parent as promptly as reasonably practicable (and in any
event within two (2) Business Days) with oral and written notice setting forth
all such information as is reasonably necessary to keep Parent informed in
all material respects of all oral or written communications regarding, and the
status and material details (including material amendments or proposed
material amendments) of, any such Alternative Transaction Proposal, request
or inquiry, and, without limitation of the other provisions of this Section
5.4, shall promptly provide to Parent a copy of all written materials
(including written materials provided by email or otherwise in electronic
format) subsequently provided by it in connection with such Alternative
Transaction Proposal, request or inquiry.

 



59 (c) _Permitted Actions in Connection with Certain Alternative Transaction
Proposals_. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in Section
5.4(a), in the event that, prior to the Company Stockholder Approval, the
Company receives an unsolicited, bona fide written Alternative Transaction
Proposal which is determined (in accordance with Section 5.4(f)(iii)) to be,
or, in the good faith determination of the Companys Board of Directors, is
reasonably likely to lead to, a Superior Proposal (as defined in Section
5.4(f)(iii)), it may then take the following actions (but only if and to the
extent that (x) its Board of Directors concludes in good faith (after
consultation with its financial advisors and outside legal advisors) that the
failure to take such action would be inconsistent with its fiduciary duties
under applicable Law, (y) the Company has given Parent at least two (2)
Business Days prior written notice of its intention to take such proposed
actions, the identity of the person or group of persons making
such Alternative Transaction Proposal, and a summary of the material terms
and conditions of such Alternative Transaction Proposal, and (z) it shall not
have breached in any material respect any of the provisions of this Section
5.4): 

(i) Furnish nonpublic information to the person or group of persons making
such Alternative Transaction Proposal; _provided_ that (A) prior to
furnishing any such nonpublic information, the Company receives from such
person or group of persons an executed confidentiality agreement containing
terms at least as restrictive with respect to such person or group of persons
as the terms contained in the Non-Disclosure Agreement is with respect to
Parent and (B) contemporaneously with furnishing any such nonpublic
information to such person or group of persons, the Company furnishes
such nonpublic information to Parent (to the extent such nonpublic
information has not been previously so furnished to Parent); and

(ii) Engage in discussions and negotiations with such person or group of
persons with respect to such Alternative Transaction Proposal.

 

(d) _Change of Recommendation; Termination_.

 

(i) Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the contrary, at any time
prior to obtaining the Company Stockholder Approval, the Companys Board of
Directors may, if it concludes in good faith (after consultation with its
financial advisors and outside legal advisors) that the failure to take such
action would be inconsistent with its fiduciary duties under applicable Law,
make an Adverse Recommendation Change (and, in the event the decision relates
to an Alternative Transaction Proposal that the Board of Directors of the
Company determines hereunder constitutes a Superior Proposal, terminate
this Agreement pursuant to Section 7.1(f)); _provided_ that prior to any such
Adverse Recommendation Change, (A) the Company shall have given Parent and
Merger Sub prompt written notice advising them of (x) the decision of
the Companys Board of Directors to take such action and the reasons therefor
and (y) in the event the decision relates to an Alternative Transaction
Proposal, a summary of the material terms and conditions of the Alternative
Transaction Proposal and other information required to be provided

 



60  with respect thereto pursuant to this Section 5.4, including the information
required to be provided pursuant to Section 5.4(b) and (c), (B) the Company
shall have given Parent and Merger Sub three (3) Business Days (the " _Notice
Period_ ") after delivery of such notice to propose revisions to the terms of
this Agreement (or make another proposal) and, during the Notice Period, the
Company shall, and shall direct its financial advisors and outside legal
advisors to, negotiate with Parent in good faith (to the extent Parent desires
to negotiate) to make such adjustments in the terms and conditions of this
Agreement so that, if applicable, such Alternative Transaction Proposal
ceases to constitute (in the good faith judgment of the Companys Board of
Directors, after consultation with its financial advisors and outside legal
advisors), a Superior Proposal or, if the Adverse Recommendation Change does
not involve an Alternative Transaction Proposal, to make such adjustments in
the terms and conditions of this Agreement so that such Adverse Recommendation
Change is otherwise not necessary, and (C) the Companys Board of Directors
in its good faith judgment shall have determined, after considering the
results of such negotiations and giving effect to the proposals made by Parent
and Merger Sub, if any, that such Alternative Transaction Proposal,
if applicable, continues to constitute a Superior Proposal or that such
Adverse Recommendation Change is otherwise still required; _provided_ ,
_further_ , that (1) if, during the Notice Period described in clause (B) of
this paragraph, any revisions are made to the Superior Proposal, if
applicable, and the Companys Board of Directors in its good faith judgment
determines (after consultation with its financial advisors and outside legal
advisors) that such revisions are material (it being understood that any
change in the purchase price or form of consideration in such Superior
Proposal shall be deemed a material revision), the Company shall deliver a new
written notice to Parent and shall comply with the requirements of this
Section 5.4(d) with respect to such new written notice except that the new
Notice Period shall be forty eight (48) hours ( _provided_ _that_ if such
forty eight (48) hour period would end on a day other than a Business Day,
then such period shall be extended to the close of business on the next
Business Day) instead of three (3) Business Days and (2) in the event the
Companys Board of Directors does not make the determination referred to in
clause (C) of this paragraph but thereafter determines to make an Adverse
Recommendation Change pursuant to this Section 5.4(d), the procedures referred
to in clauses (A), (B) and (C) above shall apply anew and shall also apply to
any subsequent withdrawal, amendment or change.

(ii) Notwithstanding any Adverse Recommendation Change by the Company, unless
such Adverse Recommendation Change is with respect to an Alternative
Transaction Proposal and the Company terminates this Agreement pursuant to
Section 7.1(f), the Company shall cause the adoption of this Agreement to be
submitted to a vote of the Companys stockholders at the Company Stockholders
Meeting.

(e)  _Compliance with Tender Offer Rules; Disclosure to Stockholders_.
Nothing contained in this Agreement shall prohibit the Company or its Board of
Directors from (x) taking and disclosing to their stockholders a position
contemplated by Rules 14d-9 and 14e-2(a) promulgated under the Exchange Act
or (y) making any disclosure to the stockholders of the

 



61  Company if, in the good faith judgment of the Board of Directors of the
Company (after consultation with its financial advisors and outside legal
advisor) failure to so disclose would be inconsistent with its fiduciary
duties under applicable Law; _provided_ that the Company shall not withdraw,
modify or change the Company Board Recommendation in a manner adverse to
Parent unless specifically permitted pursuant to the terms of Section 5.4(d).

(f) As used in this Agreement, the following terms shall have the following
meanings:

 

(i) " _Alternative Transaction_ " with respect to the Company, shall mean any
of the following transactions: (i) any transaction or series of related
transactions with one or more third persons involving: (A) any purchase from
the Company or acquisition (whether by way of a merger, share exchange,
consolidation, business combination, consolidation or similar transaction) by
any person or "group" of persons (as defined under Section 13(d) of the
Exchange Act and the rules and regulations thereunder) of more than a 20%
interest in the total outstanding voting securities of the Company or any of
its Subsidiaries or any tender offer or exchange offer that if consummated
would result in any person or group of persons beneficially owning 20% or more
of the total outstanding voting securities of the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries or any merger, consolidation, business combination or similar
transaction involving the Company or any of its Subsidiaries, or (B) any sale,
lease exchange, transfer, license, acquisition or disposition of more
than 20% of the fair market value of the assets, net income, net revenues or
cash flows of the Company and its Subsidiaries, taken as a whole, immediately
prior to such transaction, (ii) any liquidation or dissolution of the Company,
or (iii) any combination of the foregoing;

(ii) " _Alternative Transaction Proposal_ " shall mean any offer, inquiry,
proposal or indication of interest (whether binding or nonbinding) to any
person or its stockholders relating to an Alternative Transaction; and

 

(iii) " _Superior Proposal_ " means an unsolicited, bona fide written
Alternative Transaction Proposal made by a third person to acquire, directly
or indirectly, pursuant to a tender offer, exchange offer, merger,
consolidation or other business combination or acquisition transaction, (A)
all or substantially all of the assets of the Company or (B) over 50% of the
outstanding voting securities of the Company and as a result of which the
stockholders of the Company immediately preceding such transaction would hold
less than 50% of the aggregate equity interests in the surviving or resulting
entity of such transaction (or its ultimate parent), which the Companys Board
of Directors has in good faith determined (taking into account, among other
things, (1) its consultation with its financial advisors and outside
legal advisors, (2) all terms and conditions of such Alternative Transaction
Proposal and this Agreement (as it may be proposed to be amended by Parent),
and (3) the feasibility and certainty of consummation of the Alternative
Transaction Proposal

 



62  on the terms proposed, taking into account all legal, financial (including
the financing terms of any such proposal), regulatory and other aspects of
such Alternative Transaction Proposal (including conditions to consummation))
to be more favorable, from a financial point of view, to the Companys
stockholders, than the terms of this Agreement (as it may be proposed to be
amended by Parent).

 

(g) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary set forth in Section 5.4 or
elsewhere in this Agreement, if the Company receives a written Alternative
Transaction Proposal from any third person, the Company and/or its
Representatives may contact such third person in writing solely for the
purpose of clarifying the Alternative Transaction Proposal, _provided that_
the Company shall provide Parent with a copy of any such written request for
clarification at least twenty-four (24) hours prior to the time that the
Company sends such written request to the third person from whom the Company
received the written Alternative Transaction Proposal. In the event that
Parent has not provided comments to the Company regarding such written request
by the later of (i) twenty-four (24) hours after Parents receipt thereof or
(ii) the date and time on which the Company would be permitted to respond to
such Alternative Transaction Proposal pursuant to this Section 5.4, then such
written notice shall be deemed accepted by Parent for purposes hereof.

 

Section 5.5 _Preparation of SEC Documents; Company Stockholders  Meeting_.

 

(a) The Company shall use commercially reasonable efforts to prepare and
deliver to Parent, for inclusion in Parents Form S-4 to be filed by Parent
with the SEC, the Proxy Statement within thirty (30) days after the date of
this Agreement or such earlier date as is reasonably practicable. Parent shall
use commercially reasonable efforts to prepare and file with the SEC the Form
S-4, in which the Proxy Statement will be included as a prospectus, within
thirty (30) days after the date of this Agreement or such earlier date as is
reasonably practicable. Each of Parent and the Company shall use
commercially reasonable efforts to respond to any comments from the SEC and
have the Form S-4 declared effective under the Securities Act as promptly as
practicable after such filing. The Company will use all commercially
reasonable efforts to cause the Proxy Statement to be mailed to the Companys
stockholders as promptly as practicable after the Form S-4 is declared
effective under the Securities Act. Parent shall also take any action (other
than qualifying to do business in any jurisdiction in which it is not now so
qualified or filing a general consent to service of process) required to be
taken under any applicable state securities Laws in connection with the
issuance of Parent Common Stock, Parent Exchange Options, Parent
Exchange Units and Parent Exchange Warrants in the Merger and in connection
with the reservation for issuance of shares of Parent Common Stock that will
be subject to such Parent Exchange Options, Parent Exchange Units and Parent
Exchange Warrants, and the Company shall furnish all information concerning
the Company and the holders of Company Common Stock, Company Stock Options,
Restricted Stock Unit Awards and Company Warrants as may be reasonably
requested in connection with any such action. No filing of, or amendment or
supplement to, the Form S-4 and no response to SEC comments thereon shall be
made by Parent without the Companys prior consent (which shall not be
unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed) and without providing the
Company the opportunity to review and comment thereon, and Parent and Merger
Sub shall give reasonable and good faith consideration to any comments thereon
made by the Company and its counsel. Parent shall advise the Company promptly
after it receives oral or written notice of the time

 



63  when the Form S-4 has become effective or any supplement or amendment has
been filed, the issuance of any stop order, the suspension of the
qualification of the Parent Common Stock issuable in connection with the
Merger for offering or sale in any jurisdiction, or any oral or written
request by the SEC for amendment of the Proxy Statement or the Form S-4 or
comments thereon and responses thereto or requests by the SEC for
additional information, and will promptly provide the Company with copies of
any written communication from the SEC or any state securities commission. If
at any time prior to the Effective Time any information relating to Parent or
the Company, or any of their respective affiliates, officers or directors,
should be discovered by Parent or the Company which should be set forth in an
amendment or supplement to any of the Form S-4 or the Proxy Statement, so that
any of such documents would not include any misstatement of a material fact
or omit to state any material fact necessary to make the statements therein,
in the light of the circumstances under which they were made, not misleading,
the party which discovers such information shall promptly notify the other
parties hereto and an appropriate amendment or supplement describing such
information shall be promptly filed with the SEC and, to the extent required
by Law, disseminated to the stockholders of the Company.

 

(b) Subject to the exercise of the Companys rights with respect to a Superior
Proposal under Section 5.4(d), the Company shall use commercially reasonable
efforts to take all action necessary in accordance with applicable Laws and
the Company Organizational Documents to duly give notice of and schedule a
meeting of its stockholders, to be held within forty-five (45) after the Form
S-4 is declared effective under the Securities Act or on such earlier date as
is reasonably practicable, to consider the adoption of this Agreement and
approval of the Merger and the other transactions contemplated hereby (the "
_Company Stockholders  Meeting_"). Prior to the Company Stockholders
Meeting, the Company shall not approve or authorize any action to be submitted
to the stockholders of the Company for approval. Subject to Section 5.4(d),
the Company will use all commercially reasonable efforts to solicit from its
stockholders proxies in favor of the adoption of this Agreement and approval
of the Merger and the other transactions contemplated hereby, and will take
all other action necessary or advisable to secure the vote or consent of its
stockholders, as applicable, required by the rules of the NASDAQ or applicable
Laws and to obtain such approvals. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in
this Agreement, if on a date for which the Company Stockholders Meeting is
scheduled, the Company has not received proxies representing a sufficient
number of shares to obtain the Company Stockholder Approval, whether or not a
quorum is present, the Company shall, if Parent so reasonably requests,
adjourn the Company Stockholders Meeting (to the extent permitted by
applicable Law) for up to fifteen (15) Business Days (or such longer period
agreed to in writing by the Company) to solicit additional proxies. Subject
to the exercise of the Companys rights with respect to a Superior Proposal
under Section 5.4(d), the Company shall take commercially reasonable efforts
to ensure that the Company Stockholders Meeting is called, noticed,
convened, held and conducted, and that all proxies solicited in connection
with the Company Stockholders Meeting are solicited in compliance with
applicable Laws, the rules of the NASDAQ and the Company Organizational
Documents. Without the prior written consent of Parent (which shall not be
unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed), adoption of this Agreement and
approval of the Merger and the other transactions contemplated hereby is
the only matter, other than any say-on-golden parachute vote that may be
required pursuant to Section 14A(b)(2) of the Exchange Act and Rule 14a-21(c)
thereunder and a proposal to approve the adjournment of the Company
Stockholders Meeting, if necessary, to solicit additional proxies, in the
event that there are not sufficient votes

 



64  at the time of the Company Stockholders Meeting to obtain the Company
Stockholder Approval, which the Company shall propose to be acted on by the
Companys stockholders at the Company Stockholders Meeting. Except as
otherwise contemplated in Section 5.4(d), the Company agrees that its
obligations pursuant to this Section 5.5(b) shall not be affected by the
commencement, public proposal, public disclosure or communication to the
Company of any Alternative Transaction Proposal.

(c) Except to the extent expressly permitted by Section 5.4(d): (i) the Board
of Directors of the Company shall recommend that its stockholders vote in
favor of the adoption of this Agreement and approval of the Merger and the
other transactions contemplated hereby at the Company Stockholders Meeting,
(ii) the Proxy Statement shall include a statement to the effect that the
Board of Directors of the Company has recommended that the Companys
stockholders vote in favor of adoption of this Agreement and approval of the
Merger and the other transactions contemplated hereby at the Company
Stockholders Meeting (the " _Company Board Recommendation_ ") and (iii)
except as expressly permitted by Section 5.4(d), neither the Board of
Directors of the Company nor any committee thereof shall withdraw, amend or
modify, or propose or resolve to withdraw, amend or modify in a manner adverse
to Parent or Merger Sub, the recommendation of the Companys Board of
Directors that the stockholders of the Company vote in favor of the adoption
of this Agreement.

(d) Parent, with respect to the action identified in clause (i) below, and
the Company and Parent, with respect to the actions identified in clauses (ii)
and (iii) below, shall:

(i) promptly prepare and file with the NASDAQ a listing application covering
the shares of Parent Common Stock issuable in the Merger and the shares of
Parent Common Stock subject to Parent Exchange Options, Parent Exchange Units
or Parent Exchange Warrants and use all commercially reasonable efforts to
obtain, prior to the Effective Time, approval for the listing of such Parent
Common Stock, subject only to official notice of issuance; 

(ii) cooperate with each other in order to lift any injunctions or remove any
other impediment to the consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby;
and

(iii) cooperate with each other in obtaining a written opinion of its
respective legal counsel, Skadden, Arps, Slate, Meagher and Flom LLP, in the
case of Parent, and Hogan Lovells US LLP, in the case of the Company (" _Tax
Counsel_ "), substantially in the form attached hereto as _Exhibit B_ (each
such opinion, a " _Tax Opinion_ "), dated as of the Effective Time, to the
effect that, on the basis of facts, representations and assumptions set forth
in such opinion, the Merger will be treated as a reorganization within the
meaning of Section 368(a) of the Code and Parent and the Company each will be
treated as a party to the reorganization within the meaning of Section 368(b)
of the Code. Each of the Company, Parent and Merger Sub shall cooperate with
each Tax Counsel and shall deliver to each

 



65  Tax Counsel for purposes of each Tax Opinion customary representations and
covenants, including those contained in certificates of the Company, Parent,
Merger Sub and others, substantially in the form attached hereto as _Exhibit
C_.

(e) Subject to the limitations contained in Section 5.3, the Company
and Parent shall each furnish the other and to its counsel all such
information as may be required in order to effect the actions specified in
Section 5.5(d).

Section 5.6 _Employee Matters_.

(a) Except as otherwise provided herein, from and after the Effective Time,
Parent and Merger Sub shall honor all Company Benefit Plans and Company
Individual Agreements disclosed to Parent in accordance with their terms as in
effect immediately before the date hereof or as modified after the date
hereof through the Effective Time only as permitted by this Agreement;
_provided_ that nothing in this Agreement shall be deemed to limit or
otherwise impair Parents or the Surviving Corporations ability to amend or
terminate any Company Benefit Plan or Company Individual Agreement at any time
in accordance with its applicable terms.

(b) Subject to statutory or other legal requirements and information and
consultation obligations, for a period commencing at the Effective Time and
ending one year after the Effective Time, Parent, the Company and Merger Sub
agree that each employee of the Company or its Subsidiaries who continues in
employment with the Surviving Corporation or its Subsidiaries (the " _Company
Employees_ ") shall be provided with (i) a base salary or hourly wage rate
and commission, bonus opportunity and non-equity based incentives that are
comparable in the aggregate to those provided to such Company Employee
immediately prior to the Effective Time and (ii) welfare and
employee benefits plans, programs and arrangements (it being understood that
discretionary equity and equity based awards will remain discretionary) that
are substantially similar in the aggregate to those provided to substantially
similarly situated employees of Parent or its Subsidiaries _provided_ that
nothing contained in this Section 5.6, whether express or implied, shall be
deemed to create an obligation of Parent or any of its Subsidiaries to pay or
otherwise issue equity awards to any employee or officer of the Company or
otherwise create a right for such individuals to receive equity awards from
Parent or any of its Subsidiaries; _provided_ , _further_ , that until the
first anniversary of the Effective Time, Parent, Merger Sub and the Company
agree to honor and keep in effect all severance plans that are applicable to
employees and officers of the Company and its Subsidiaries as of the date of
this Agreement, to the extent previously provided to Parent. 

(c) Parent and its affiliates shall recognize the service of employees with
the Company and its Subsidiaries prior to Closing as service with Parent in
connection with any 401(k) savings plan and welfare benefit plan or policy
(including vacations and severance policies) maintained by Parent or one of
its affiliates which is made available following the Effective Time by Parent
or one of its affiliates for purposes of satisfying or determining any waiting
period, vesting, eligibility or benefit entitlement (but excluding benefit
accruals thereunder).

 



66 (d) Parent and its affiliates shall use commercially reasonable efforts to (i)
waive, or cause its insurance carriers to waive, all limitations as to pre-
existing and at-work conditions, if any, with respect to participation and
coverage requirements applicable to Company Employees under any group health
plan (as defined in Section 4980B of the Code) which is made available to
such employees following the Effective Time by Parent or one of its
affiliates, unless such conditions would not have been waived under the
comparable plans of the Company or its Subsidiaries in which such employees
participated immediately prior to the Effective Time, and (ii) provide credit
to Company Employees for any co-payments, deductibles and out-of-pocket
expenses paid by such employees under any group health plan (as defined in
Section 4980B of the Code) of the Company and its Subsidiaries during the
portion of the relevant plan year including the Effective Time for purposes of
any applicable co-payments, deductibles and out-of-pocket
expense requirements under any such group health plan of Parent and its
affiliates.

(e) Parent acknowledges that the Company shall be entitled to pay, as of the
Closing Date, a pro-rata portion of the annual cash incentive bonuses earned
by employees of the Company and its Subsidiaries in respect of the Companys
fiscal year ending December 31, 2011, based on actual performance through the
last day of the calendar month preceding the month in which the Closing Date
occurs extrapolated through the Closing Date, but otherwise determined
consistent with past practice, such portion determined by multiplying
the full bonus for each bonus-eligible employee by the quotient of the number
of days elapsed in the calendar year through the Closing Date divided by 365;
_provided_ , _however_ , that, in the event that the Closing Date occurs in
2012, (i) the payment of annual cash incentive bonuses shall be based on
actual performance through December 31, 2011 and shall be paid in accordance
with the Companys past practices, and (ii) the Company shall not be entitled
to pay any annual cash incentive bonuses in respect of fiscal year 2012 as of
the Closing Date. Any such bonuses shall be payable only to employees who
remain employed by the Company or its Subsidiaries as of the Closing Date.

 

(f) The provisions of this Section 5.6 shall not operate to require Parent to
duplicate any payments or benefits payable pursuant to any Company Benefit
Plans and Company Individual Agreements or other compensation or benefits
plans, policies, programs, agreements or other arrangements of the Surviving
Corporation.

 

(g) The parties acknowledge and agree that all provisions contained in this
Section 5.6 are included for the sole benefit of the parties hereto, and that
nothing in this Agreement, whether express or implied, shall create any third
party beneficiary or other rights (i) in any other Person, including any
employees or former employees of the Company or its Subsidiaries, or (ii) to
continued employment following the Closing Date. Notwithstanding anything in
this Section 5.6 to the contrary, nothing in this Agreement, whether express
or implied, shall be treated as an amendment or other modification of
any Company Benefit Plan or any benefit plan of Parent or shall limit the
right of the Surviving Corporation or Parent to amend, terminate or otherwise
modify any employee benefit plans following the Closing Date.

 

(h) As soon as reasonably practicable after the expiration or termination of
the applicable waiting period under the HSR Act, the Company will provide
personnel in Parents human resources and information technology departments
with access to information,

 



67  designated as "HR/IT personnel only", with respect to each Company Employee
regarding such Company Employees name, position, market location, date of
hire, current annual salary, hourly rate of pay and commission and/or bonus
arrangement (as applicable).

Section 5.7 _Notification of Certain Matters_. The Company shall give prompt
notice to Parent, and Parent shall give prompt notice to the Company, of (1)

be expected to have, individually or in the aggregate, a Material Adverse
Effect on it or (B) has caused, or would reasonably be expected to cause,
individually or in the aggregate, any condition set forth in Article VI to be
unsatisfied in any material respect at any time prior to the Effective Time;
or (2) any action, suit, proceeding, inquiry or investigation pending or, to
the knowledge of the Company or Parent, as applicable, threatened which
questions or challenges the validity of this Agreement; _provided_ , 
_however_ , that the delivery of any notice pursuant to this Section 5.7 shall
not limit or otherwise affect the remedies available hereunder to the party
receiving such notice nor shall the party giving such notice be prejudiced
with respect to any such matters solely by virtue of having given such
notice.

the parties hereto shall use all reasonable best efforts (subject to, and in
accordance with, applicable Law) to take promptly, or cause to be taken, all

promptly as practicable to any additional requests for information received
from the FCC or any State PSC by any party to an FCC Submission or PSC
Submission; it being understood and agreed that Parent and its Subsidiaries
shall have primary control and responsibility, with the assistance and
cooperation of the Company, over the FCC Submission and PSC Submission

applicant or petitioner and may be represented by its own counsel with respect
to each such filing and shall have a reasonable advance opportunity to

(iii) use all commercially reasonable efforts to cure, not later than the
Effective Time, any violations or defaults under the FCC Rules or any State

Governmental Entities in connection with the execution and delivery of this
Agreement and the consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby; and
(B) timely making all such required or appropriate filings and timely seeking
all required or appropriate consents, permits, clearances, authorizations or
approvals, and

actions and do, or cause to be done, all other things necessary, proper or
advisable to consummate and make effective the transactions contemplated

the Antitrust Division of the Department of Justice, the FCC, any State PSC,
or any other person, may assert under a Regulatory Law (as defined in Section
5.8(f)) with respect to the transactions contemplated hereby subject to
Section 5.8(f).

 



69 (c) The Parties shall keep each other reasonably apprised of the status of
matters relating to the completion of the Merger and work cooperatively in
connection with the efforts referenced above in obtaining all Governmental
Consents. In that regard, the Parties shall, without limitation: (i) promptly
notify each other of, and if in writing furnish each other with copies of
(or, in the case of oral communications, advise each other orally of), any
material communications from or with any Governmental Entity with respect to
the transactions contemplated by this Agreement; (ii) permit each other to
review and discuss in advance, and consider in good faith the views of each
other in connection with, any proposed written or oral communication with any
such Governmental Entity with respect to the transactions contemplated by
this Agreement, including but not limited to any analyses, appearances,
presentations, memoranda, briefs, arguments, material correspondence, and
proposals made or submitted to any Governmental Entity regarding the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement; (iii) use commercially
reasonable efforts to not participate in any meeting or substantive telephone
discussion with any such Governmental Entity with respect to the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement unless they consult with each other in advance
and, to the extent permitted by such Governmental Entity, give each other or
their outside counsel the opportunity to attend and participate thereat; (iv)
furnish each other with advance copies of all material correspondence,
filings (other than their premerger notification reports) and communications
between it and any such Governmental Entity with respect to the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement and provide to the other (or the others
respective advisors) upon request copies of all correspondence between such
party and any Governmental Entity and any document productions by such party
to any Governmental Entity in connection with the premerger notification
report filing and otherwise relating to the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement; and (v) furnish each other with such necessary information and
reasonable assistance as the other may reasonably request in connection with
its preparation of necessary filings or submissions of information to any
such Governmental Entity. Without limiting the generality of the foregoing,
the parties may, as they deem advisable and necessary, designate any
competitively sensitive materials provided to the other under this Section
5.8 as "outside counsel only." Such materials and the information contained
therein shall be given only to outside counsel of the recipient and will not
be disclosed by such outside counsel to employees, officers, or directors of
the recipient without the advance written consent of the party providing such
materials.

(d) In furtherance and not in limitation of the covenants of the parties
contained in this Section 5.8, if any administrative or judicial action or
proceeding, including any proceeding by a private party, is instituted (or
threatened to be instituted) challenging any transaction contemplated by this
Agreement as violative of any Regulatory Law (as defined in Section 5.8(f)
below), each of the Company and Parent shall cooperate in all respects with
each other and use all reasonable best efforts to contest and resist any such
action or proceeding and to have vacated, lifted, reversed or overturned any
decree, judgment, injunction or other order, whether temporary, preliminary or
permanent, that is in effect and that prohibits, prevents or restricts
consummation of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement.
Notwithstanding the foregoing or any other provision of this Agreement,
nothing in this Section 5.8 shall limit a partys right to terminate
this Agreement pursuant to Section 7.1(c) or 7.1(d) so long as such party
has, prior to such termination, complied with its obligations under this
Section 5.8.

(e) If any objections are asserted with respect to the transactions
contemplated hereby under any Regulatory Law or if any suit is instituted by
any Governmental 

 



70  Entity or any private party challenging any of the transactions contemplated
hereby as violative of any Regulatory Law, each of the Company and Parent
shall use all reasonable best efforts to resolve any such objections or
challenge as such Governmental Entity or private party may have to such
transactions under such Regulatory Law so as to permit consummation of the
transactions contemplated hereby by the Outside Date.

 

(f) Without limiting this Section 5.8, Parent and the Company agree to take
any and all steps and to make any and all undertakings necessary to avoid or
eliminate each and every impediment under any Regulatory Law that may be
asserted by any Governmental Entity with respect to the Merger so as to enable
the Closing to occur as soon as reasonably possible (and in any event,
no later than the Outside Date (as defined in Section 7.1(b)(i))), including,
without limitation, proposing, negotiating, committing to, and effecting by
consent decree, hold separate order, or otherwise, the sale, divestiture,
licensing or disposition of such assets or businesses of Parent (or its
Subsidiaries) or the Company (or its Subsidiaries) or otherwise taking or
committing to take actions that limit Parents or its Subsidiaries freedom of
action with respect to, or their ability to retain, any of the businesses,
product lines or assets of Parent (or its Subsidiaries) or the Company (or its
Subsidiaries) in each case, as may be required in order to obtain any
clearances or approvals required to consummate the Merger by the Outside
Date, or avoid the entry of, or to effect the dissolution of, any injunction,
temporary restraining order, or other order in any suit or proceeding, which
would otherwise have the effect of preventing or delaying the Closing; 
_provided_ , _however_ , that neither Parent and its Subsidiaries nor the
Company and its Subsidiaries shall be required to take any action that would
be materially adverse to the business, financial condition or the expected
benefits of the Merger to the Company and its Subsidiaries, taken as a whole,
or Parent and its Subsidiaries, taken as a whole. For purposes of this
Agreement, " _Regulatory Law_ " means: (i) the Sherman Act, as amended, the
Clayton Act, as amended, the HSR Act, the Federal Trade Commission Act, as
amended, and all other statutes, rules, regulations, orders, decrees,
administrative and judicial doctrines and other Laws that are designed or
intended to prohibit, restrict or regulate actions having the purpose or
effect of monopolization or restraint of trade or lessening competition,
whether in the communications industry or otherwise, through merger or
acquisition, and (ii) FCC Rules, PSC Rules and any applicable laws, rules,
regulations, practices and orders of any other Governmental Entities
regulating competition and/or the telecommunication and data communications
industry.

Section 5.9 _Takeover Statute_. If any "fair price," "moratorium," "control
share acquisition" or other form of antitakeover statute or regulation shall
become applicable to the transactions contemplated hereby, the Company and
its Board of Directors shall grant such approvals and take such actions as are
reasonably necessary so that the transactions contemplated hereby may be
consummated as promptly as practicable on the terms contemplated hereby and
otherwise act to eliminate or minimize the effects of such statute or
regulation on the transactions contemplated hereby.

Section 5.10 _Public Announcements_. The Company and Parent will consult with
and provide each other the opportunity to review and comment upon any press
release or other public statement or comment prior to the issuance of such
press release or other public statement or comment relating to this Agreement
or the transactions contemplated hereby and shall not issue any such press
release or other public statement or comment prior to such 

 



71  consultation except as may be required by Law or by obligations pursuant to
any listing agreement with any national securities exchange. Parent and the
Company agree to issue a press release announcing this Agreement.

Section 5.11 _Indemnification and Insurance_.

 

(a) Parent and Merger Sub agree that all rights to exculpation and
indemnification, including rights to the advancement of expenses, for acts or
omissions occurring at or prior to the Effective Time, whether asserted or
claimed prior to, at or after the Effective Time (including any matters
arising in connection with the transactions contemplated by this Agreement),
existing as of the date of this Agreement in favor of the current or former
directors, officers or employees, as the case may be (the " _Indemnified
Parties_ "), of the Company or its Subsidiaries as provided in their
respective certificate of incorporation or by-laws or in any agreement
disclosed to Parent prior to the date of this Agreement shall survive the
Merger and shall continue in full force and effect for a period of six (6)
years from and after the Effective Time. For a period of six (6) years from
and after the Effective Time, Parent and the Surviving Corporation shall (i)
honor and maintain the current provisions regarding indemnification of and the
advancement of expenses to officers and directors contained in the Company
Organizational Documents (or comparable organizational documents) of each of
the Company and its Subsidiaries, (ii) maintain in effect any indemnification
agreements of the Company and its Subsidiaries with any of their respective
directors, officers and employees existing as on the date hereof, and (iii)
jointly and severally indemnify, and advance expenses to, the Indemnified
Parties to the fullest extent permitted by applicable Law. For purposes of
the foregoing, in the event any claim is asserted within the six-year period
during which Parent is required to cause the Surviving Corporation to
indemnify, advance expenses and maintain the indemnification and advancement
arrangements of the Company and its Subsidiaries, all such rights in respect
of any such claim shall continue until final disposition thereof. At or before
the Effective Time, Parent shall purchase a "tail policy" of at least the same
coverage and amounts as the Companys current policies of directors and
officers liability insurance and fiduciary liability insurance and containing
terms and conditions which are, in the aggregate, no less advantageous to the
insured with respect to claims arising from facts or events that occurred on
or before the Effective Time and which cover a period of six (6) years from
the Effective Time; _provided_ , _however_ , that in no event shall the
Surviving Corporation be required to pay more than 300% of the annual premium
paid by the Company for such insurance for the fiscal year ending December 31,
2011 (the " _Maximum Amount_ ") in order to purchase such "tail policy", and
if the Surviving Corporation is unable to obtain the insurance required by
this Section 5.11 for equal to or less than the Maximum Amount, it shall
obtain as much comparable insurance as possible for an annual premium equal to
the Maximum Amount; _provided_ ,  _further_ , that if Parent fails to
purchase the requisite "tail policy" hereunder at or before the Effective
Time, then the Company may purchase such "tail policy" hereunder. If such
"tail policy" has been obtained by the Company prior to the Effective Time,
Parent shall cause such "tail policy" to be maintained in full force and
effect, for its full term, and cause all obligations thereunder to be honored
by the Surviving Corporation.

 

(b) Any Indemnified Party wishing to claim indemnification under paragraph (a)
of this Section 5.11, upon learning of any such Claim, shall promptly notify
Surviving Corporation thereof, but the failure to so notify shall not relieve
Parent or the Surviving Corporation of any liability it may have to such
Indemnified Party, except to the extent such failure materially prejudices
the Surviving Corporation. In the event of any such threatened or actual Claim
(whether asserted or arising at or before or after the Effective Time), (A)
Parent or the

 



72  Surviving Corporation shall have the right to assume the defense thereof,
with counsel reasonably acceptable to the Indemnified Parties (which
acceptance shall not be unreasonably withheld, delayed or conditioned), and
Parent and the Surviving Corporation shall not be liable to such Indemnified
Parties for any legal expenses of other counsel or any other expenses
subsequently incurred by such Indemnified Parties in connection with
the defense thereof, except that if Parent or the Surviving Corporation
elects not to assume such defense or counsel for the Indemnified Parties
advises that there are issues which raise conflicts of interest between Parent
or the Surviving Corporation and the Indemnified Parties, or between the
Indemnified Parties, the Indemnified Parties may retain counsel satisfactory
to them, and Parent or the Surviving Corporation shall pay all documented fees
and expenses of such counsel for the Indemnified Parties within twenty (20)
Business Days after statements therefor are received; _provided_ , _however_ ,
that Parent and the Surviving Corporation shall be obligated pursuant to this
paragraph (b) to pay for only one firm of counsel for all Indemnified Parties
(selected by a majority of the applicable Indemnified Persons) in any
jurisdiction except to the extent that any two or more Indemnified Parties
have a conflict of interest in such Claim, and (B) the Company and, after the
Effective Time, the Surviving Corporation shall (and Parent shall cause the
Surviving Corporation to) promptly pay expenses in advance of the final
disposition of any such threatened or actual Claim to each Indemnified Party
to the fullest extent permitted by applicable Law, subject to the receipt of
an undertaking by such Indemnified Party to repay such expenses if it is
ultimately determined that such Indemnified Party is not entitled to be
indemnified; _provided_ ,  _however_ , that neither the Company nor the
Surviving Corporation shall be liable for any settlement effected without its
prior written consent (which prior written consent shall not be unreasonably
withheld, conditioned or delayed);  _provided_ , _further_ , that the Company
and the Surviving Corporation shall have no obligation hereunder to any
Indemnified Party when and if a court of competent jurisdiction shall
ultimately determine, and such determination shall have become final and non-
appealable, that indemnification by them of such Indemnified Party in the
manner contemplated hereby is prohibited by applicable Law.

(c) Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the contrary, the
obligations under this Section 5.11 shall not be terminated or modified in
such a manner as to adversely affect any Indemnified Party to whom this
Section 5.11 applies without the consent of each such affected Indemnified
Party. The provisions of this Section 5.11 are intended to be for the
irrevocable benefit of, and to grant third party beneficiary rights to, each
of the Indemnified Parties and their heirs and legal representatives, and
shall be binding upon all successors of Parent and the Surviving Corporation.
Each of the Indemnified Parties and their respective heirs shall be entitled
to enforce the provisions of this Section 5.11.

(d) The rights of the Indemnified Parties and their heirs and legal
representatives under this Section 5.11 shall be in addition to any rights
such Indemnified Parties may have under the certificate of incorporation or
by-laws of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries, or under any other
applicable Laws.

 

(e) In the event that, following the Effective Time, Parent or the Surviving
Corporation or any of their respective successors or assigns (i) consolidates
with or

 



73  merges into any other person and shall not be the continuing or surviving
corporation or entity of such consolidation or merger, (ii) transfers or
conveys all or substantially all of its properties and assets to any person
or (iii) commences a dissolution, liquidation, assignment for the benefit of
creditors or similar action, then, and in each such case, to the extent
necessary, proper provision shall be made so that the successors and assigns
of Parent or the Surviving Corporation, as the case may be, assume the
applicable obligations set forth in this Section 5.11.

Section 5.12 _Control of Operations_. Nothing contained in this Agreement
shall be deemed to give Parent, directly or indirectly, the right to control
or direct the operations of the Company prior to the Effective Time. Prior to
the Effective Time, the Company shall exercise, consistent with the terms and
conditions of this Agreement, complete control and supervision over its and
its Subsidiaries operations.

 

Section 5.13 _Section 16 Matters_. Prior to the Effective Time, each of
Parent and the Company shall use all commercially reasonable efforts to
approve in advance in accordance with the procedures set forth in Rule 16b-3
promulgated under the Exchange Act and the Skadden, Arps, Slate, Meagher and
Flom LLP SEC No-Action Letter (January 12, 1999) any dispositions of Company
Common Stock (including derivative securities with respect to Company Common
Stock) to or acquisitions of Parent Common Stock (including derivative
securities with respect to Parent Common Stock) resulting from the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement by each officer or director of
Parent or the Company who is subject to Section 16 of the Exchange Act (or who
will become subject to Section 16 of the Exchange Act as a result of the
transactions contemplated hereby) with respect to equity securities of Parent
or the Company, respectively.

Section 5.14 _Financing Commitments and Debt Tender Offer_. Parent shall be
obligated to take the actions specified in Section 5.14(a) and, at Parents
written request, the Company shall be obligated to take the actions specified
in Section 5.14(b) only until such date (the " _Commitment Letter Termination
Date_ ") on which (i) the Company Supplemental Indentures in respect of the
2017 Notes and either of the 2015 Notes or the 2018 Notes and (ii) an
amendment (the " _Parent Credit Amendment_ ") to the Second Amended and
Restated Credit Agreement, dated as of October 19, 2009 (as amended,
supplemented or otherwise modified from time to time, the " _Parent Credit
Agreement_ "), among Parent, the lenders party thereto and JPMorgan Chase
Bank, N.A., as administrative agent and collateral agent (which amendment
shall provide for the waiver of Parents obligation to cause the Company and
its Subsidiaries to become guarantors under the Parent Credit Agreement, the
waiver of any breach of the Parent Credit Agreement that may result from
operation of the change of control provisions of the Company Indentures and
such other related amendments as may be incidental thereto or
otherwise necessary to effectuate the Merger, the Company Note Consent
Solicitation, the Debt Tender Offer or the other transactions contemplated
hereby) shall have been executed and become effective. Parent shall use its
commercially reasonable efforts to obtain the Parent Credit Amendment as soon
as reasonably practicable following the execution and delivery of this
Agreement.

 

(a) Parent shall use its commercially reasonable efforts to take, or cause to
be taken, all actions and to do, or cause to be done, all things necessary,
proper, or advisable to

 



74  consummate and obtain the Financing on the terms and conditions described in
the Commitment Letter, including using commercially reasonable efforts to (i)
maintain in effect the Commitment Letter, (ii) satisfy on a timely basis all
conditions applicable to Parent obtaining the Financing that are within its
control, (iii) negotiate definitive agreements with respect to the Financing
on the terms and conditions contained in the Commitment Letter, and (iv) to
the extent the Parent Credit Amendment shall not have been executed on or
prior to the third (3rd) Business Day following the satisfaction or waiver (to
the extent permitted by Law) of all of the conditions to Closing set forth in
Article VI of this Agreement (other than those conditions that by their nature
are to be satisfied at the Closing, but subject to the satisfaction or waiver
(to the extent permitted by Law) of those conditions), consummate
the Financing as soon as reasonably practicable prior to such third (3rd)
Business Day referenced above or during the Marketing Period. Parent shall pay
when due all commitment fees arising under the Commitment Letter as and when
they become payable. Parent acknowledges and agrees that obtaining the
Financing is not a condition to the Closing or the Merger. Without the
Companys prior written consent (which shall not be unreasonably conditioned,
withheld or delayed), Parent shall not agree to or permit any amendment,
replacement, supplement, or other modification of, or waive any of its
material rights under, the Commitment Letter, if such amendment, replacement,
supplement or other modification or waiver would reasonably be expected to
prevent, materially delay, or materially impede the consummation of the
Financing; _provided_ _that_ , for the avoidance of doubt, Parent may (without
the prior consent of the Company) replace and amend the Commitment Letter to
add lenders, lead arrangers, book runners, syndication agents, or similar
entities that had not executed the Commitment Letter as of the date of this
Agreement. Upon any such amendment, replacement, supplement, or modification
of any of the Commitment Letter in accordance with this Section 5.14(a), the
term " _Commitment Letter_ " shall mean the Commitment Letter as so amended,
replaced, supplemented, or modified in accordance with this Section 5.14(a),
and the term " _Financing_ " shall mean the financing contemplated by the
Commitment Letter as so amended, replaced, supplemented or modified; and

(b) The Company shall use its commercially reasonable efforts to commence, as
soon as reasonably practicable following the receipt of a written request from
Parent to do so (but in no event earlier than thirty (30) days after the date
of this Agreement), and to consummate as soon as reasonably practicable
thereunder, in accordance with applicable Law, an offer to purchase all of the
outstanding aggregate principal amount of each of the Company Notes
designated in such written request from Parent, together with, at Parents
option, a solicitation of consents to amend provisions of the Company
Indentures (collectively, the " _Debt Tender Offer_ "), on such terms
and conditions, including pricing terms, that are reasonably specified, from
time to time, by Parent, and Parent shall assist the Company in connection
therewith.

(i) Without Parents written consent, but subject to Section 5.14(b)(ii), the
Company shall not, and shall cause each of its Subsidiaries not to, amend,
waive, extend or agree to pay any amount in connection with any Debt Tender
Offer, defeasance or satisfaction and discharge with respect to the Company
Notes or the Company Indentures. Notwithstanding the foregoing, (A) the
closing of the Debt Tender Offer shall be conditioned on the occurrence of
the Closing and funded by amounts provided by Parent and/or one or more of its
Subsidiaries, and (B) the Company and its Subsidiaries shall not be required
to

 



75  take any action in violation of Law in connection with the Debt Tender
Offer. Immediately prior to the Effective Time, the Company shall accept for
payment, and thereafter Parent shall, or shall cause the Surviving
Corporation on Parents behalf to, promptly pay for all Company Notes that
have been properly tendered and not properly withdrawn pursuant to the Debt
Tender Offer and to deliver such Company Notes to the applicable trustee for
cancellation.

(ii) Parent and the Company shall reasonably cooperate with each other in the
preparation of all necessary and appropriate documentation (including, if
applicable, all mailings to the holders of the Company Notes and all reports
and statements required to be filed with the SEC) in connection with the Debt
Tender Offer. Such documentation shall be subject to the prior review of, and
comment by, each party and such partys legal counsel. If at any time prior to
the completion of the Debt Tender Offer any information in such documentation
is discovered by the Company or Parent that should be set forth in an
amendment or supplement to such documentation, so that such documentation
shall not contain any untrue statement of a material fact or omit to state any
material fact required to be stated therein or necessary in order to make the
statements therein, in the light of circumstances under which they are made,
not misleading, then the party that discovers such information shall promptly
notify the other party thereof, and an appropriate amendment or
supplement prepared by the parties (subject to the review of, and comment by,
their respective legal counsel) describing such information shall be
disseminated by or on behalf of the Company to the holders of the Company
Notes.

 

(iii) Parent and the Company shall, and shall cause their respective
Subsidiaries to, reasonably cooperate with each other in the Debt Tender
Offer process. The Company shall keep Parent reasonably informed regarding the
status, results and timing of the Debt Tender Offer. If the holders of the
requisite percentage of the aggregate principal amount of the outstanding
Company Notes needed to consent to amendments of the Company Indentures have
so consented, the Company shall promptly execute supplemental indentures to
each Company Indenture to effectuate such amendments that will become
operative only immediately upon the Effective Time and shall use commercially
reasonable efforts to cause the trustee under each such Company Indenture to
enter into each such applicable supplemental indenture prior to or
substantially simultaneously with the Closing.

(iv) At Parents written request, the Company shall, and shall cause its
Subsidiaries party to the applicable Company Indenture to, use commercially
reasonable efforts to promptly take all actions necessary and required to
effect the redemption of any Company Notes that otherwise would remain
outstanding at the Closing and the satisfaction and discharge of any Company
Indenture with respect to any such Company Notes, which satisfaction and
discharge shall be effective upon the Closing; and the Company shall
concurrently with the Closing (i) give irrevocable instructions to
the trustee under the applicable Company Indenture to mail a notice of
redemption to holders of

 



76  such Company Notes pursuant to such Company Indenture, (ii) deposit in trust
all required funds or U.S. Government Obligations (as defined in the
applicable Company Indenture) with respect to such redemption as set forth in
the applicable Company Indenture and give irrevocable instructions to the
trustee under such Company Indenture to apply the deposit toward the payment
of such Company Notes upon redemption, (iii) pay or cause to be paid all
other sums payable pursuant to such Company Indenture, and (iv) deliver to the
trustee under the applicable Company Indenture such "Officers Certificates,"
"Opinions of Counsel," any required accountants certificates and "Board
Resolutions" in connection with a redemption (as such terms are defined in the
applicable Company Indenture) in form and substance satisfactory to such
trustee as to satisfaction of all conditions precedent to such satisfaction

documentation shall not contain any untrue statement of a material fact or
omit to state any material fact required to be stated therein or necessary in
order to make the statements therein, in the light of circumstances under
which they are made, not misleading, then the party that discovers
such information shall promptly notify the other party, and an appropriate

of control provisions of the Company Indentures, have so consented, the
Company shall promptly execute supplemental indentures to each such Company
Indenture to effectuate the waiver (the " _Company Supplemental Indentures_ ")
and shall use commercially reasonable efforts to cause the trustee under each
such Company Indenture to enter into each such applicable Company
Supplemental Indenture as promptly as practicable.

(d) The Company shall execute (a) (i) a solicitation agent agreement with
J.P. Morgan Securities LLC as solicitation agent with respect to the Company
Note Consent Solicitation and (ii) a dealer manager agreement with J.P. Morgan

incurred by or on behalf of Parent or its Subsidiaries in connection with the
authorization, preparation, negotiation, execution and performance of this
Agreement and the transactions contemplated hereby (the " _Parent Expenses_
"); provided, however, that the amount of Parent Expenses required to be paid
under this Section 7.3(b) shall not exceed $15 million in the aggregate. In
the event that the Company Termination Fee later becomes payable by the
Company pursuant to Section 7.3(a) then the Parent Expenses to the extent
previously paid by the Company pursuant to this Section 7.3(b) shall be
credited against the Company Termination Fee then payable.

(c) _Interest and Costs; Other Remedies_. All payments under this Section 7.3
shall be made by wire transfer of immediately available funds to an account
designated by the party to receive payment. The Company acknowledges that the
agreements contained in this Section 7.3 are an integral part of the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement and that, without these
agreements, Parent and Merger Sub would not enter into this Agreement;
accordingly, if the Company fails to pay the Company Termination Fee in a
timely manner and, in order to obtain such payment, Parent makes a claim that
results in a judgment against the Company for failure to pay such amount, the
Company shall pay to Parent its reasonable costs and expenses (including
reasonable attorneys fees and expenses) in connection with such suit,
together with interest on the Company Termination Fee at the rate of interest
per annum publicly announced by JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A. (or any successor
thereto or other major money center commercial bank agreed to by the parties
hereto) as its prime rate at its principal office in New York City, as in
effect on the date such payment was required to be made. It is acknowledged
and agreed that payment of the Company Termination Fee is not a penalty, but
rather is liquidated damages in a reasonable amount that will compensate
Parent and Merger Sub in the circumstances in which the Company Termination
Fee is payable; _provided_ , _however_ , that the foregoing shall not limit
Parents or Merger Subs rights with respect to any liabilities or damages
incurred or suffered by such party to the extent recovery is otherwise
permitted under Section 7.2.

Section 7.4 _Amendment or Supplement_. At any time before or after approval
of the matters presented in connection with the Merger by the respective
stockholders of the Company and Parent and prior to the Effective Time, this
Agreement may be amended or supplemented in writing by the Company and Parent
with respect to any of the terms contained

 



87  in this Agreement, except that following approval by the stockholders of the
Company and Parent there shall be no amendment or change to the provisions
hereof which by Law or in accordance with the rules of any relevant stock
exchange requires further approval by such stockholders without such further
approval nor any amendment or change not permitted under applicable Law.

 

Section 7.5 _Extension of Time, Waiver, Etc._ At any time prior to the
Effective Time, the Company and Parent may:

 

(a) extend the time for the performance of any of the obligations or acts of
the other party;

 

(b) waive any inaccuracies in the representations and warranties of the other
party contained herein or in any document delivered pursuant hereto; or

(c) waive compliance with any of the agreements or conditions of the other
party contained herein. 

Notwithstanding the foregoing, no failure or delay by the Company or Parent in
exercising any right hereunder shall operate as a waiver thereof nor shall
any single or partial exercise thereof preclude any other or further exercise
of any other right hereunder. Any agreement on the part of a party hereto to
any such extension or waiver shall be valid only if set forth in an
instrument in writing signed on behalf of such party.

States located in the State of Delaware or in any other Delaware state
court, this being in addition to any other remedy to which they are entitled
at law or in equity. In addition, each of the parties hereto (a) consents to

Chancery Court lacks subject matter jurisdiction, any federal court located
in the State of Delaware or any other Delaware state court in the event any
dispute arises out of this Agreement or any of the transactions contemplated

jurisdiction, a federal or state court sitting in the State of Delaware.

 

(b) Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, the parties hereto
acknowledge and irrevocably agree (i) that any Action, whether in law or in

hereto submits for itself and its property with respect to any such Action to
the exclusive jurisdiction of such court, (ii) not to bring or permit any of
their affiliates to bring or support anyone else in bringing any such Action
in any other court, (iii) that service of process, summons, notice or
document by registered mail addressed to them at their respective addresses
provided in Section 8.7 shall be effective service of process against them for
any such Action brought in any such court, (iv) to waive and hereby waive, to
the fullest extent permitted by law, any objection which any of them may now

inconvenient forum to the maintenance of, any such Action in any such
court, (v) to waive and hereby waive any right to trial by jury in respect of
any such Action, (vi) that a final judgment in any such Action shall be
conclusive and may be enforced in other jurisdictions by suit on the judgment

governed by, and construed in accordance with, the laws of the State of New
York, without regard to the conflicts of law rules of such State that would
result in the application of the laws of any other State, and (viii) that the
Financing Sources are express third party beneficiaries of, and may enforce,
any provisions in this Agreement reflecting the foregoing agreements. For

HEREBY IRREVOCABLY WAIVES ALL RIGHT TO TRIAL BY JURY IN ANY ACTION, SUIT,
PROCEEDING OR COUNTERCLAIM (WHETHER BASED ON CONTRACT, TORT OR OTHERWISE)

COMPANY OR MERGER SUB IN THE NEGOTIATION, ADMINISTRATION, PERFORMANCE
AND ENFORCEMENT HEREOF.

action for specific performance that a remedy at law would be adequate and (b)
any requirement under any law to post security as a prerequisite to obtaining
equitable relief.

action is required to be taken hereunder by any of the parties hereto is not
a Business Day, such action shall be required to be taken on the next
succeeding day which is a Business Day.

invalid or unenforceable in any jurisdiction shall, as to that jurisdiction,
be ineffective to the

 



91  extent of such invalidity or unenforceability without rendering invalid or

other jurisdiction. If any provision of this Agreement is so broad as to be
unenforceable, such provision shall be interpreted to be only so broad as is
enforceable.

 

Section 8.12 _Entire Agreement; No Third-Party Beneficiaries_. This Agreement
(including the exhibits and schedules hereto), the Non-Disclosure Agreement
and the Voting Agreements constitute the entire agreement, and supersede all
other prior agreements and understandings, both written and oral, between the

party contained herein or any covenant or agreement of such party contained
