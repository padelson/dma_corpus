(other than conditions that by their nature are to be satisfied at the
Closing, but subject to the satisfaction or, to the extent permitted by
Applicable Law, waiver of such conditions by the party or parties entitled to

First Articles of Merger are accepted for record by the SDAT) as Parent and
the Company shall agree and specify in the First Articles of Merger. As used

26

 

    

(b) At the Effective Time, Merger Sub 1 shall be merged with and into the

subsidiary of Parent and shall continue to be governed by the laws of the
State of Maryland.

  



  

(c) From and after the Effective Time, the effects of the First Merger
shall be as provided in this Agreement, the First Articles of Merger, and the

rights, privileges, immunities, powers and franchises of the Company and
Merger Sub 1 shall vest in the Surviving Corporation, and all claims,
obligations, debts, liabilities and duties of the Company and Merger Sub 1
shall become the claims, obligations, debts, liabilities and duties of the
Surviving Corporation.

  



  

Section 2.03. _The Second Merger_.

  



  

(a) At the Closing and immediately following the First Merger, Merger Sub 2

Articles of Merger") as contemplated by the MGCL and the LLC Act with the
SDAT, in such form as required by, and executed in accordance with, the MGCL
and the LLC Act, and subject to, and taking into account, the provisions of
Section 3.02. The Second Merger shall become effective at such time as the
Second Articles of Merger are accepted for record by the SDAT on the Closing

the date the Second Articles of Merger are accepted for record by the SDAT)
as Parent and the Company shall agree and specify in the Second Articles of
Merger. As used herein, the "Second Merger Effective Time" shall mean the time
at which the Second Merger shall become effective. Unless otherwise agreed,
the parties shall cause the Second Merger Effective Time to occur on the
Closing Date.

  



  

(b) At the Second Merger Effective Time, the Surviving Corporation shall be
merged with and into Merger Sub 2 in accordance with the MGCL and the LLC Act
in the Second Merger, whereupon the separate existence of the Surviving
Corporation shall cease, and Merger Sub 2 shall be the surviving company (the
"Surviving Company") and a wholly owned direct subsidiary of Parent and shall
continue to be governed by the laws of the State of Maryland.

  



  

(c) From and after the Second Merger Effective Time, the effects of the
Second Merger shall be as provided in this Agreement, the Second Articles of
Merger, and the applicable provisions of the MGCL and the LLC Act. Without
limiting the generality of the foregoing, and subject thereto, at the Second
Merger Effective Time, all of the property, rights, privileges, immunities,
powers and franchises of the Surviving Corporation and Merger Sub 2 shall
vest in the Surviving Company, and all claims, obligations, debts,
liabilities and duties of the Surviving Corporation and Merger Sub 2 shall
become the claims, obligations, debts, liabilities and duties of the
Surviving Company.

  



  

(d) At the Second Merger Effective Time (i) each share of Surviving
Corporation common stock outstanding immediately prior to the Second Merger
Effective Time

  



    

27

 

    

shall be cancelled, and no consideration shall be paid with respect thereto,
and (ii) the limited liability company interests of Merger Sub 2 outstanding
immediately prior to the Second Merger Effective Time shall remain outstanding
and shall constitute the only outstanding limited liability company interests
of the Surviving Company.

  



  

Section 2.04. _Conversion of Shares._ At the Effective Time, by virtue of
the First Merger and without any action on the part of Parent, Merger Sub 1,
the Company, the holders of any securities of the Company or any other Person:

  



  

(a) each share of Company Stock outstanding immediately prior to the
Effective Time (each a "Company Share") (other than (x) Company Shares to be
cancelled pursuant to Section 2.04(b)(i) (the "Excluded Shares") and (y) the
Hook Stock Shares) shall, subject to Section 2.05 and Section 2.10, be
converted into the right to receive the following consideration:

  



  

(i) each Company Share with respect to which an election to receive a
combination of stock and cash (a "Mixed Election") has been effectively made
and not revoked or lost pursuant to Section 2.05 (each, a "Mixed Consideration
Electing Share") and each Non-Electing Company Share shall be converted into
the right to receive the combination (which combination shall hereinafter be
referred to as the "Mixed Consideration") of (x) $28.25 in cash (the "Per
Share Cash Amount") and (y) 0.5833 shares of validly issued, fully paid and
non-assessable shares of Parent Common Stock (the "Mixed Election Stock
Exchange Ratio");

  



  

(ii) each Company Share with respect to which an election to receive only
cash (a "Cash Election") has been effectively made and not revoked or lost
pursuant to Section 2.05 (each, a "Cash Electing Company Share") shall be
converted (provided that the Available Cash Election Amount equals or exceeds
the Cash Election Amount) into the right to receive in cash, without
interest, an amount (rounded to two decimal places) (the "Per Share Cash
Election Consideration") equal to the sum of (i) the Per Share Cash Amount
plus (ii) the product of the Mixed Election Stock Exchange Ratio
multiplied by the Parent Common Stock Reference Price; _provided_ , _however_
, that if (x) the product of the number of Cash Electing Company Shares and
the Per Share Cash Election Consideration (such product being the "Cash
Election Amount") exceeds (y) the difference between (I) the product of the
Per Share Cash Amount and the total number of Company Shares (other than
Excluded Shares and Hook Stock Shares) issued and outstanding immediately
prior to the Effective Time minus (II) the product of the number of Mixed
Consideration Electing Shares (including any Non-Electing Company Shares) and
the Per Share Cash Amount (such difference being the "Available Cash Election
Amount"), then each Cash Electing Company Share shall be converted into a
right to receive (1) an amount of cash (without interest) equal to the product
(rounded to two decimal places) of (p) the Per Share Cash Election
Consideration and (q) a fraction, the numerator of which shall be the
Available Cash Election Amount and the denominator of which shall be the Cash
Election Amount (such fraction being the "Cash Fraction") and (2) a number of
validly issued, fully paid and non-assessable shares of Parent Common Stock
equal to the product of (r) the Exchange Ratio and (s) one (1) minus the Cash
Fraction; and

  



    

28

 

    

(iii) each Company Share with respect to which an election to receive only
stock consideration (a "Stock Election") has been effectively made and not
revoked or lost pursuant to Section 2.05 (each, a "Stock Electing Company
Share") shall be converted (provided that the Cash Election Amount equals or
exceeds the Available Cash Election Amount), into a number of shares of
validly issued, fully paid and non-assessable shares of Parent Common Stock
(the "Exchange Ratio") equal to (i) the Mixed Election Stock Exchange Ratio
plus (ii) the quotient (rounded to four decimal places) of the Per Share Cash
Amount divided by the Parent Common Stock Reference Price; _provided_ ,
_however_ , that if the Available Cash Election Amount exceeds the Cash
Election Amount, then each Stock Electing Company Share shall be converted
into the right to receive (1) an amount of cash (without interest) equal to
the amount (rounded to two decimal places) of such excess divided by the
number of Stock Electing Company Shares and (2) a number of validly issued,
fully paid and non-assessable shares of Parent Common Stock equal to the
product (rounded to four decimal places) of (x) the Exchange Ratio and (y) a
fraction, the numerator of which shall be the Per Share Cash Election
Consideration minus the amount calculated in clause (1) of this paragraph and
the denominator of which shall be the Per Share Cash Election Consideration;

  



  

(b)  

  



  

(i) each share of Company Stock held immediately prior to the Effective
Time by Parent, Merger Sub 1 or Merger Sub 2 (other than any such shares that
are Fiduciary Shares) shall be cancelled, and no consideration shall be paid
with respect thereto; and

  



  

(ii) each share of Company Stock held immediately prior to the Effective
Time by any Subsidiary of the Company (any such shares, the "Hook Stock
Shares") shall be converted into the right to receive a number of validly
issued, fully paid and non-assessable shares of Parent Common Stock equal to
the Fixed Exchange Ratio.

  



  

(c) each share of common stock of Merger Sub 1 outstanding immediately
prior to the Effective Time shall be converted into and become one share of
common stock, par value $0.01 per share, of the Surviving Corporation with the
same rights, powers and privileges as the shares so converted and shall
constitute the only outstanding shares of capital stock of the Surviving
Corporation;

  



  

(d) all outstanding shares of Company Stock shall no longer be outstanding
and shall automatically be cancelled and retired and shall cease to exist,
and each share of Company Stock that was outstanding immediately prior to the
Effective Time shall thereafter represent only the right to receive the
applicable Merger Consideration, any dividends or other distributions pursuant
to Section 2.06(f) and any cash in lieu of any fractional shares of Parent
Common Stock pursuant to __Section _2.09_ , in each case to be issued or paid
in accordance with Section 2.06, without interest, as applicable; and

  



  

(e) effective upon the delivery of the Written Consent, no dissenters' or
appraisal rights will be available with respect to the Mergers and the other
Transactions, including any remedy under Section 3-201 _et seq._ of the MGCL.

  



    

29

 

    

Section 2.05.   _Election Procedures_. (a) Each Person who is a record
holder of Company Shares other than Excluded Shares as of the Effective Time
shall be entitled to specify the number of such holder's Company Shares with
respect to which such holder makes a Cash Election, a Stock Election or a
Mixed Election in accordance with (and subject to) this Section 2.05.

  



  

(b) Parent shall prepare and file as an exhibit to the Registration
Statement a form of election (the "Form of Election") in form and substance
reasonably acceptable to the Company. At least twenty (20) Business Days prior
to the anticipated Effective Time (the "Mailing Date"), Parent shall instruct
the Exchange Agent to mail the Form of Election with the
Information Statement/Prospectus to all Persons who are record holders of
Company Shares as of five (5) Business Days prior to the Mailing Date. The
Form of Election shall be used by each record holder of Company Shares (or, in
the case of nominee record holders, the beneficial owner through proper
instructions and documentation) to make a Cash Election, a Stock Election or a
Mixed Election. In the event that a holder fails to make a Cash Election, a
Stock Election or a Mixed Election with respect to any Company Shares held or
beneficially owned by such holder by the Election Deadline, then such holder
shall be deemed to have made a Mixed Election with respect to those Company
Shares (each such Company Share, a "Non-Electing Company Share"). During
the period from the mailing of the Form of Election and the Election
Deadline, Parent shall use its reasonable best efforts to make the Form of
Election available to all Persons who become at or prior to the Election
Deadline (or who are expected to become at or prior to the Election Deadline)
record holders of Company Shares.

  



  

(c) Any holder's election shall have been properly made only if the
Exchange Agent shall have received at its designated office by 5:00 p.m., New
York City time, on the date that is three (3) Business Days preceding the
Closing Date (the "Election Deadline"), a Form of Election properly completed
and signed and accompanied by any additional documents required by the
procedures set forth in the Form of Election. After a Cash Election, a Stock
Election or a Mixed Election is validly made with respect to any Company
Shares, no further registration of transfers of such Company Shares shall be
made on the stock transfer books of the Company, unless and until such Cash
Election, Stock Election or Mixed Election is properly revoked.

  



  

(d) Parent and the Company shall publicly announce the anticipated Election
Deadline at least five (5) Business Days prior to the anticipated Election
Deadline. If the Closing Date is delayed to a subsequent date, the Election
Deadline shall be similarly delayed to a subsequent date, and Parent and the
Company shall promptly announce any such delay and, when determined, the
rescheduled Election Deadline.

  



  

(e) Any Cash Election, Stock Election or Mixed Election may be revoked with
respect to all or a portion of the Company Shares subject thereto by the
holder who submitted the applicable Form of Election by written notice
received by the Exchange Agent prior to the Election Deadline. In addition,
all Cash Elections, Stock Elections and Mixed Elections shall automatically be
revoked if this Agreement is terminated in accordance with Article 10\. If a
Cash Election or Stock Election is revoked, the Company Shares as to which
such election previously applied shall be treated as Mixed Consideration
Electing Shares in accordance with Section 2.04(a)(i) unless a new election
is submitted by the holder within the

  



    

30

 

    

period during which elections are permitted to be made pursuant to Section
2.05(d). The accounts of holders of Uncertificated Shares will not be
credited at the Depository Trust Company, unless the holder so requests.

  



  

(f) The determination of the Exchange Agent (or the reasonable
determination of Parent, in the event that the Exchange Agent declines to
make any such determination) shall be conclusive and binding as to whether or
not Cash Elections, Stock Elections and/or Mixed Elections shall have been
properly made or revoked pursuant to this Section 2.05 and as to when Cash
Elections, Stock Elections, Mixed Elections and/or revocations were received
by the Exchange Agent. The Exchange Agent (or Parent, acting reasonably, in
the event that the Exchange Agent declines to make the following computation)
shall also make all computations contemplated by Section 2.04(c), and absent
manifest error this computation shall be conclusive and binding. The
Exchange Agent may, with the written agreement of Parent (subject to the
consent of the Company, which shall not be unreasonably withheld, delayed or
conditioned), make any rules as are consistent with this Section 2.05 for the
implementation of the Cash Elections, Stock Elections and Mixed Elections
provided for in this Agreement as shall be necessary or desirable to effect
these Cash Elections, Stock Elections and Mixed Elections.

  



  

(g) Without limitation of Section 8.02, each of Parent and the Company
shall solicit Cash Elections, Stock Elections and Mixed Elections under this
Agreement in compliance with, and shall make any and all filings that are
necessary or advisable under, all applicable rules and regulations of the
SEC.

  



  

Section 2.06. _Surrender and Payment_. (a) Prior to the Effective Time,
Parent shall appoint an exchange agent reasonably acceptable to the Company
(the "Exchange Agent") and enter into an exchange agent agreement with the
Exchange Agent for the purpose of exchanging (in each case, other than
Excluded Shares and Hook Stock Shares) for the Merger Consideration, (i)
certificates representing shares of Company Stock (each a "Certificate") or
(ii) uncertificated shares of Company Stock which immediately prior to the
Effective Time were registered to a holder on the stock transfer books of the
Company (the "Uncertificated Shares"). At or prior to the Effective Time,
Parent shall deposit with the Exchange Agent, for the benefit of the
holders of shares of Company Stock, for exchange in accordance with this
Section 2.06 through the Exchange Agent, (i) evidence of shares in book-entry
form representing the shares of Parent Common Stock issuable pursuant to
Section 2.04 and (ii) cash in immediately available funds in an amount
sufficient for the payment of all cash amounts payable pursuant to Section
2.04. Parent agrees to make promptly available, directly or indirectly, to
the Exchange Agent from time to time as needed additional cash sufficient to
pay any dividends or other distributions to which holders of Company Stock are
entitled pursuant to Section 2.06(f) and cash in lieu of any fractional
shares of Parent Common Stock to which such holders are entitled pursuant to
Section 2.09. Promptly after the Effective Time and in any event within three
(3) Business Days after the Closing Date, Parent shall send, or shall cause
the Exchange Agent to send, to each holder of shares of Company Stock
represented by a Certificate at the Effective Time a letter of transmittal
and instructions (which shall specify that delivery shall be effected, and
risk of loss and title shall pass, only upon proper delivery of the
Certificates or transfer of the Uncertificated Shares to the Exchange Agent
and which shall otherwise be in customary form and shall include customary
provisions with respect to delivery of an "agent's message" regarding the
book-entry

  



    

31

 

    

transfer of Uncertificated Shares) for use in such exchange. All evidence of
shares of Parent Common Stock in book-entry form and cash deposited with the
Exchange Agent pursuant to this Section 2.06 shall be referred to in this
Agreement as the "Exchange Fund." Parent shall cause the Exchange Agent to
deliver the Merger Consideration contemplated to be issued or paid
pursuant to this Article 2 out of the Exchange Fund in accordance herewith.
The Exchange Fund shall not be used for any other purpose. The Exchange Agent
shall invest any cash included in the Exchange Fund as directed by Parent;
_provided_ that no such investment or losses thereon shall affect the
dividends or other distributions to which holders of Company Stock are
entitled pursuant to Section 2.06(f) or cash in lieu of fractional interests
to which holders of Company Stock are entitled pursuant to Section 2.09. Any
interest and other income resulting from such investments shall be the
property of, and paid to, Parent upon termination of the Exchange Fund.

  



  

(b) Each holder of shares of Company Stock that have been converted into
the right to receive the Merger Consideration shall be entitled to receive,
upon (i) surrender to the Exchange Agent of a Certificate, together with a
properly completed letter of transmittal, or (ii) receipt of an "agent's
message" by the Exchange Agent (or such other evidence, if any, of transfer
as the Exchange Agent may reasonably request) in the case of a book-entry
transfer of Uncertificated Shares, in respect of each share of Company Stock
represented by such Certificate or Uncertificated Share (A) the applicable
Merger Consideration and (B) any cash in lieu of any fractional shares of
Parent Common Stock and any dividends and distributions with respect
thereto as contemplated by Section 2.09 and Section 2.06(f), as applicable.
The shares of Parent Common Stock constituting Merger Consideration shall, at
Parent's option, be in uncertificated book-entry form, unless a physical
certificate is required under Applicable Law.

  



  

(c) If any portion of the Merger Consideration (or cash in lieu of any
fractional shares of Parent Common Stock or any dividends and distributions
with respect thereto contemplated by Section 2.09 or Section 2.06(f), as
applicable) is to be paid to a Person other than the Person in whose name the
surrendered Certificate or the transferred Uncertificated Share is
registered, it shall be a condition to such payment that (i) either such
Certificate shall be properly endorsed or shall otherwise be in proper form
for transfer or such Uncertificated Share shall be properly transferred and
(ii) the Person requesting such payment shall pay to the Exchange Agent any
transfer or similar Taxes required as a result of such payment to a Person
other than the registered holder of such Certificate or Uncertificated Share
or establish to the satisfaction of the Exchange Agent that such transfer
or similar Taxes have been paid or are not payable.

  



  

(d) From and after the Effective Time, there shall be no further
registration of transfers of shares of Company Stock on the records of the
Company. If, after the Effective Time, Certificates or Uncertificated Shares
are presented to Parent, the Surviving Company or the Exchange Agent for any
reason, they shall be cancelled and exchanged for the applicable Merger
Consideration (and cash in lieu of any fractional shares of Parent Common
Stock and any dividends and distributions with respect to the Merger
Consideration as contemplated by Section 2.09 and Section 2.06(f), as
applicable) with respect thereto in accordance with the procedures set forth
in, or as otherwise contemplated by, this Article 2.

  



  

(e) Any portion of the Exchange Fund that remains unclaimed by the holders
of shares of Company Stock twelve (12) months following the Closing Date
shall be

  



    

32

 

    

delivered to Parent or as otherwise instructed by Parent, upon demand, and
any such holder who has not exchanged shares of Company Stock for the
applicable Merger Consideration in accordance with this Section 2.06 prior to
such time shall thereafter look only to Parent for payment of such Merger
Consideration (and cash in lieu of any fractional shares of Parent Common
Stock and any dividends and distributions with respect thereto as
contemplated by Section 2.09 and Section 2.06(f), as applicable), without any
interest thereon. Notwithstanding the foregoing, Parent and its Subsidiaries
(including, after the Closing, the Surviving Company and its Subsidiaries)
shall not be liable to any holder of shares of Company Stock for any amounts
properly paid to a public official in compliance with applicable abandoned
property, escheat or similar laws. Any amounts remaining unclaimed by holders
of shares of Company Stock immediately prior to such time when the amounts
would otherwise escheat to or become property of any Governmental Authority
shall become, to the extent permitted by Applicable Law, the property of
Parent free and clear of any claims or interest of any Person previously
entitled thereto.

  



  

(f) Following the surrender of any Certificates or the transfer of any
Uncertificated Shares as provided in this Section 2.06, and in any event
within two (2) Business Days of such surrender or transfer, the Exchange Agent
shall promptly pay, or cause to be paid, without interest, to the Person in
whose name the shares of Parent Common Stock constituting the Merger
Consideration have been registered, (i) in connection with the payment of the
Merger Consideration, (x) the amount of any cash payable in lieu of
fractional shares to which such Person is entitled pursuant to Section 2.09,
as applicable, and (y) the aggregate amount of all dividends or other
distributions payable with respect to such shares of Parent Common Stock with
a record date on or after the Effective Time that were paid prior to the time
of such surrender or transfer, and (ii) at the appropriate payment date
after the payment of the Merger Consideration, the amount of all dividends or
other distributions payable with respect to whole shares of Parent Common
Stock constituting the Merger Consideration with a record date on or after the
Effective Time and prior to the time of such surrender or transfer and with a
payment date subsequent to the time of such surrender or transfer. No
dividends or other distributions with respect to shares of Parent Common
Stock constituting the Merger Consideration, and no cash payment in lieu of
fractional shares pursuant to Section 2.09, as applicable, shall be paid to
the holder of any Certificates not surrendered or of any Uncertificated
Shares not transferred until such Certificates or Uncertificated Shares are
surrendered or transferred, as the case may be, as provided in this Section
2.06.

  



  

(g) The payment of any transfer, documentary, sales, use, stamp,
registration, value added and other Taxes and fees (including any penalties
and interest) incurred solely by a holder of Company Stock in connection with
the Mergers, and the filing of any related Tax Returns and other
documentation with respect to such Taxes and fees, shall be the sole
responsibility of such holder.

  



  

Section 2.07. _Company Equity Awards_.

  



  

(a) _Company Stock Options_. As of the Effective Time, each outstanding
option to purchase shares of Company Non-Voting Common Stock under any
Company Stock Plan that is outstanding and unexercised immediately prior to
the Effective Time (each, a "Company Stock Option") will be deemed to have
vested in full as of such time and

  



    

33

 

    

shall be cancelled and converted into the right to receive an amount in cash
equal to the positive difference, if any, calculated by subtracting the
aggregate exercise price of such Company Stock Option from the product of (i)
the aggregate number of shares of Company Non-Voting Common Stock subject to
such Company Stock Option and (ii) the Per Share Cash Election Consideration.

  



  

(b) _Company Restricted Stock and Company RSU Awards_. Upon the Company
Stockholder Approval, each share of Company Restricted Stock that is then
outstanding and unvested shall vest in full, subject to withholding of
applicable Taxes, and shall be treated in accordance with Section 2.04(a).
Upon the Company Stockholder Approval, each Company RSU Award (other than a
Prospective Company RSU Award) that is then outstanding and unvested shall
vest and settle in full, subject to withholding of applicable Taxes, and
shall be treated in accordance with Section 2.04(a).

  



  

(c) _Prospective Company Equity Award Grants._ For each Company Equity
Award that would have been granted following the date of the Company
Stockholder Approval but prior to the Effective Time to the extent permitted
by Section 6.01(l) of the Company Disclosure Schedule in the ordinary course
of business, any such Company Equity Award that would have otherwise been
granted in the form of Company Restricted Stock or a Company Stock Option
will instead be granted in the form of a Company RSU Award of substantially
equivalent grant date fair value (a "Prospective Company RSU Award"). Each
Prospective Company RSU Award that is then outstanding (after giving effect
to the payment of the Special Dividend) as of immediately prior to
the Effective Time shall, by virtue of the Mergers and without further action
on the part of the Company, Parent or the holder thereof, be assumed by
Parent and become, as of the Effective Time, an award (an "Assumed RSU Award")
with respect to shares of Parent Common Stock, on the same terms and
conditions (including applicable vesting and expiration provisions and
the obligation of Parent to settle such Assumed RSU Award in Parent Common
Stock) as applied to each Prospective Company RSU Award immediately prior to
the Effective Time, except that the number of shares of Parent Common Stock
subject to such Assumed RSU Award shall equal the product (rounded down to
the nearest whole share) of (x) the number of shares underlying such
Prospective Company RSU Award immediately prior to the Effective Time as
increased by accrued dividend equivalent payments, multiplied by (y)
the Exchange Ratio.

  



  

(d) _Company Subsidiary Employee Equity Awards_. The Company shall vest
and settle Company Subsidiary Employee Equity Awards in accordance with the
terms of the applicable Company Subsidiary Employee Equity Plan as of the date
hereof no later than immediately prior to the Effective Time.

  



  

(e) _Atlanta Capital, L.P. Long-Term Incentive Plan_. Prior to the
Effective Time, the Company will use reasonable best efforts to obtain the
consent of each Company Employee that holds an outstanding equity interest
granted under the Atlanta Capital, L.P. Long-Term Incentive Plan to vest and
settle each such equity interest in full as of or prior to the Effective Time
on terms to be approved by Parent, which approval shall not be unreasonably
withheld, conditioned or delayed. Parent shall cause the Surviving Company to
pay, no later than five (5) Business Days following the Effective Time, the
amounts owing in respect of such

  



    

34

 

    

settlement, without interest, to the extent such amounts have not been paid
prior to the Effective Time.

  



  

(f) _Company DSU Awards_. As of immediately prior to the Effective Time,
each Company DSU Award that is then outstanding shall be deemed to have
vested in full as of such time and shall be cancelled and converted into the
right to receive a cash amount equal to the Per Share Cash Election
Consideration (as increased by accumulated dividend amounts, including the
Special Dividend).

  



  

(g) _Delivery of Company Equity Award Consideration; Section 409A_. Parent
shall cause the Surviving Company to pay through the payroll system of the
Surviving Company (to the extent applicable) to each holder of a Company
Equity Award outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time (other than
a Prospective Company RSU Award) the applicable payment contemplated by this
Section 2.7, less any required withholding Taxes and without interest, no
later than the first payroll date of the Surviving Company following the
Effective Time. Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, with respect
to any Company Equity Award that constitutes nonqualified deferred
compensation subject to Section 409A of the Code and that the Company
determines prior to the Effective Time is not eligible to be terminated in
accordance with Treasury Regulation Section 1.409A-3(j)(4)(ix)(B), such
payment will be made at the earliest time permitted that will not trigger a
Tax or penalty under Section 409A of the Code.

  



  

(h) _S-8 Registration Statement_. From and after the Closing, Parent will
reserve for issuance the number of shares of Parent Common Stock that will
become subject to the Assumed RSU Awards and, effective as of the Closing,
will cause the offering and sale of shares of Parent Common Stock issuable
upon settlement thereof to be permitted by a Registration Statement on
Form S-8 or other appropriate form (the "S-8 Registration Statement") and
will use reasonable best efforts to maintain the effectiveness of the S-8
Registration Statement thereafter for so long as any of such Assumed RSU
Awards remains outstanding.

  



  

(i) _Board Actions_. Prior to the Effective Time, the Board of Directors
of the Company (and/or an authorized committee thereof) and the Board of
Directors of Parent (and/or an authorized committee thereof) shall adopt such
resolutions as are necessary to give effect to the transactions contemplated
by this Section 2.07.

  



  

(j) _Non-U.S. Company Equity Awards_. The Company and Parent may mutually
agree in writing to treat Company Equity Awards subject to non-U.S. Law in
another manner to take into account applicable non-U.S. law or Tax or
employment considerations; _provided _ that the Company and Parent shall use
commercially reasonable efforts to ensure such treatment corresponds as
closely as permitted by applicable Law to treatment of Company Equity Awards
that are subject to U.S. Law.

  



  

Section 2.08. _Adjustments_. Without limiting or affecting any of the
provisions of Section 6.01 or Section 7.01 (or any corresponding sections of
the Company Disclosure Schedule or Parent Disclosure Schedule, as applicable),
if, during the period between the date of this Agreement and the Effective
Time, any change in the outstanding shares of capital stock of

  



    

35

 

    

the Company or Parent shall occur as a result of any reclassification,
recapitalization, stock split (including reverse stock split), exchange or
readjustment of shares, subdivision or other similar transaction or event, or
any stock dividend thereon with a record date during such period (but, for
the avoidance of doubt, excluding any change that results from (i) the
exercise or settlement of compensatory equity awards of Parent or the Company
or (ii) the grant of equity-based compensation by Parent or the Company), the
Merger Consideration and any other amounts payable pursuant to this Agreement
shall be appropriately adjusted to eliminate the effect of such event on the
Merger Consideration, the Special Dividend Per Share Amount or any such other
amounts payable pursuant to this Agreement, as applicable.

  



  

Section 2.09. _Fractional Shares_. Notwithstanding anything in this
Agreement to the contrary, no fractional shares of Parent Common Stock shall
be issued in the Mergers. All fractional shares of Parent Common Stock that a
holder of shares of Company Stock would otherwise be entitled to receive as a
result of the Mergers shall be aggregated and, if a fractional share results
from such aggregation, such holder shall be entitled to receive, in lieu
thereof, an amount in cash, without interest, determined by multiplying
the fraction of the applicable share of Parent Common Stock to which such
holder would otherwise have been entitled by the Parent Closing Price.

  



  

Section 2.10. _Withholding Rights_. Notwithstanding any provision
contained herein to the contrary, each of the Exchange Agent, Parent, the
Surviving Corporation and the Surviving Company shall be entitled to deduct
and withhold from the consideration otherwise payable pursuant to this
Agreement such amounts as it is required to deduct and withhold with respect
to the making of such payment under any provision of any Applicable Law,
including federal, state, local or non-U.S. Tax law; _provided_ , _however_
, that Parent shall use its reasonable best efforts to provide the Company
with written notice prior to any such withholding (other than in the case of
any "backup withholding" pursuant to Section 3406 of the Code and the
corresponding Treasury Regulations) and will reasonably cooperate with the
Company's efforts to reduce or eliminate such withholding. If the Exchange
Agent, Parent, the Surviving Corporation or the Surviving Company, as the
case may be, so deducts and withholds any such amounts, such amounts shall be
treated for all purposes of this Agreement as having been paid to the Person
in respect of which the Exchange Agent, Parent, the Surviving Corporation or
the Surviving Company, as the case may be, made such deduction and
withholding. The Exchange Agent, Parent, the Surviving Corporation or the
Surviving Company, as applicable, shall pay, or shall cause to be paid, all
amounts so deducted or withheld to the appropriate Taxing Authority within the
period required under Applicable Law.

  



  

Section 2.11. _Lost Certificates_. If any Certificate shall have been
lost, stolen or destroyed, upon the making of an affidavit of that fact by
the Person claiming such Certificate to be lost, stolen or destroyed and, if
required by the Surviving Company, the posting by such Person of a customary
bond issued for a lost, stolen or destroyed Certificate, in such amount as the
Surviving Company may direct, as indemnity against any claim that may be made
against the Surviving Company with respect to such Certificate, the Exchange
Agent will issue, in exchange for such lost, stolen or destroyed Certificate,
the applicable Merger Consideration to be paid in respect of the shares of
Company Stock represented by such Certificate, as contemplated by this Article
2.

  



    

36

 

    

Section 2.12. _Further Assurances_. From and after the Second Merger
Effective Time, the officers and directors of the Surviving Company shall
execute and deliver, in the name and on behalf of the Surviving Corporation,
the Company and any of its Subsidiaries or the Merger Subs, any deeds, bills
of sale, assignments or assurances and to take and do, in the name and on
behalf of the Surviving Corporation, the Company and any of its Subsidiaries
or the Merger Subs, any other actions and things to vest, perfect or
confirm of record or otherwise in the Surviving Company any and all right,
title and interest in, to and under any of the rights, properties or assets
of the Company or the Surviving Corporation acquired or to be acquired by the
Surviving Company as a result of, or in connection with, the Mergers.

  



  

Section 2.13. _Tax Treatment._ Each of the parties intends that for U.S.
federal income tax purposes, the Mergers, taken together, will constitute an
integrated transaction that qualifies as a "reorganization" within the meaning
of Section 368(a) of the Code and the Treasury Regulations, and that this
Agreement be, and hereby is, adopted as a "plan of reorganization" for the
purposes of Sections 354, 361 and 368 of the Code and Treasury Regulations

organization and has all corporate or other organizational powers, as
applicable, required to carry on its business as now conducted, except for
those jurisdictions where failure to be so organized, validly existing and in
good standing or to have such power is not, and would not reasonably be
expected to be, individually or in the aggregate, material to the Company and
its Subsidiaries, taken as a whole. Each such Subsidiary is duly qualified to
do business and is in good standing in each jurisdiction where such
qualification is necessary, except for those jurisdictions where failure to
be so qualified is not, and would not reasonably be expected to be,
individually or in the aggregate, material to the Company and its
Subsidiaries, taken as a whole. Section 4.06(a) of the Company
Disclosure Schedule sets forth a true and complete list of each Significant

rights issued by or with the approval of the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries that are derivative of, or provide economic benefits
based, directly or indirectly, on the value or price of, any capital stock or
other voting securities of, or other ownership interests in, any Subsidiary
of the Company (the items in clauses (i) through (iii) being referred to
collectively as the "Company Subsidiary Securities"), other than Company
Subsidiary Securities directly or indirectly owned by the Company or any of
its wholly owned Subsidiaries. There are no outstanding obligations of the
Company or any of its Subsidiaries to repurchase, redeem or otherwise acquire
any Company Subsidiary Securities, or to make any material investment in any
other Person.

  



  

(c) Except for the capital stock or other voting securities of, or other
ownership interests in, Subsidiaries of the Company and publicly traded

or other ownership interests in, any Person (other than capital stock or
other voting securities of, or other ownership interests in, any Person owned
by the Company or any Subsidiary of the Company in a fiduciary, representative
or other capacity on behalf of other

  



    

42

 

    

Persons, whether or not held in a separate account). Neither the Company nor
any of its Subsidiaries is bound by any commitment or obligation to acquire
by any means, directly or indirectly, any capital stock or securities of any
Person, or to make any investment in, or contribution, loan or advance to,
any Person.

  



  

Section 4.07. _Regulatory Reports, SEC Filings and the Sarbanes-Oxley
Act_. (a) The Company and each of its Subsidiaries have timely filed with or
furnished all Filings, together with any amendments, required to be made with
respect thereto, that they were required to file or furnish (as applicable)
since January 1, 2018 with any Governmental Authority, have paid all fees and
assessments due and payable in connection therewith, and all such Filings
have complied in all material respects with the rules and regulations of such
Governmental Authority as in effect at the time of filing, except for the
failure to file or furnish any such Filing, make any such payment or the
failure to comply with such rules and regulations that in each case has not
had and would not reasonably be expected to have, individually or in the
aggregate, a Company Material Adverse Effect.

  



  

(b) As of its filing date (and as of the date of any amendment), each
Filing filed with or furnished to the SEC by the Company since January 1,
2018 (collectively, together with any exhibits and schedules thereto and other
information incorporated therein, and as amended from time to time, the
"Company SEC Documents") and filed prior to the date of this Agreement has
complied, and each Company SEC Document filed subsequent to the date of this
Agreement (assuming, in the case of each of the Registration Statement and
the Information Statement/Prospectus, that the representation and warranty set
forth in Section 5.09 is true and correct) will comply, in all material
respects with the applicable requirements of the Company Stock Exchange, the
Securities Act, the Securities Exchange Act and the Sarbanes-Oxley Act, as the
case may be.

  



  

(c) As of its filing date (or, if amended or superseded by a filing prior
to the date of this Agreement, on the date of such amended or superseding
filing), each Company SEC Document filed prior to the date of this Agreement
did not, and each Company SEC Document filed subsequent to the date of this
Agreement (assuming, in the case of each of the Registration Statement and
the Information Statement/Prospectus, that the representation and warranty
set forth in Section 5.09 is true and correct) will not, contain any untrue
statement of a material fact or omit to state any material fact necessary in
order to make the statements made therein, in light of the circumstances
under which they were made, not misleading.

  



  

(d) Each Company SEC Document that is a registration statement, as amended
or supplemented, as applicable, filed pursuant to the Securities Act, as of
the date such registration statement or amendment became effective, did not
contain any untrue statement of a material fact or omit to state any material
fact required to be stated therein or necessary to make the statements
therein, in light of the circumstances in which they were made, not
misleading.

  



  

(e) The Company is, and since January 1, 2018 has been, in compliance in
all material respects with (i) the applicable provisions of the Sarbanes-
Oxley Act and (ii) the applicable listing and corporate governance rules and
regulations of the Company Stock Exchange.

  



    

43

 

    

(f) The Company and its Subsidiaries have established and maintained since
January 1, 2018, and continue and maintain, disclosure controls and
procedures (as defined in Rule 13a-15 under the Securities Exchange Act). Such
disclosure controls and procedures are designed to ensure that all material
information relating to the Company, including its consolidated Subsidiaries,
is made known to the Company's principal executive officer and its principal
financial officer by others within those entities, particularly during the
periods in which the periodic reports required under the Securities Exchange
Act are being prepared. Such disclosure controls and procedures are effective
in timely alerting the Company's principal executive officer and
principal financial officer to material information required to be included
in the Company's periodic and current reports required under the Securities
Exchange Act. For purposes of this Agreement, "principal executive officer"
and "principal financial officer" shall have the meanings given to such terms
in the Sarbanes-Oxley Act.

  



  

(g) The Company and its Subsidiaries have established and maintained since
January 1, 2018, and continue and maintain, a system of internal controls
over financial reporting (as defined in Rule 13a-15 under the Securities
Exchange Act) ("internal controls"). Such internal controls are designed and
sufficient to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of the
Company's financial reporting and the preparation of the Company's
consolidated financial statements for external purposes in accordance with
GAAP. The Company has disclosed, based on its most recent evaluation of such
internal controls prior to the date of this Agreement, to the Company's
auditors and the audit committee of the Board of Directors of the Company (x)
all significant deficiencies and material weaknesses in the design or
operation of internal controls which are reasonably likely to adversely
affect the Company's ability to record, process, summarize and report
financial information and (y) any fraud, whether or not material, that
involves management or other employees who have a significant role in internal
controls. The Company has made available to Parent prior to the date of this
Agreement a true and complete summary of such disclosure provided to the
Company's auditors and the audit committee of the Board of Directors of the
Company since October 31, 2019 through the date of this Agreement.

  



  

(h) Since January 1, 2018, each of the principal executive officer and
principal financial officer of the Company (or each former principal
executive officer and principal financial officer of the Company, as
applicable) has made all certifications required by Rule 13a-14 and 15d-14
under the Securities Exchange Act and Sections 302 and 906 of the Sarbanes-
Oxley Act and any related rules and regulations promulgated by the SEC and

information relating to Parent, including its consolidated Subsidiaries, is
made known to Parent's principal executive officer and its principal
financial officer by others within those entities, particularly during the

individually or in the aggregate with Client Economic Term Changes made in

contravene any Applicable Law; _provided_ that each party shall, and shall
cause its respective Subsidiaries to, use commercially reasonable efforts to
make appropriate substitute disclosure arrangements under circumstances in

either party have access to individual performance or evaluation records,
medical histories or other similar information that in the reasonable opinion
of the other party the disclosure of which would reasonably be expected to
subject such party or any of its Subsidiaries to risk of liability.

other party's external auditors as soon as reasonably practicable to agree on
the necessary processes and procedures that are required to be undertaken by

effort by, any Third Party that the Company knows, or should reasonably be
expected to know, is seeking to make, or has made, a Company Acquisition
Proposal, (iii) (A) (1) fail to make, (2) withdraw or (3) qualify, amend or
modify in any manner adverse to Parent, the Company Board Recommendation (it
being understood that any failure to publicly and without qualification
either (x) recommend against such Company Acquisition Proposal or (y)
reaffirm the Company Board Recommendation, in each case, within ten (10)
Business Days after a Company Acquisition Proposal is made public or any
request by Parent to do so will be treated as a

  



    

82

 

    

withdrawal of the Company Board Recommendation that is adverse to Parent for
purposes hereof), (B) fail to make, or to include in the
Information Statement/Prospectus, the Company Board Recommendation or (C)

Acquisition Proposal, or (v) fail to enforce, amend or grant any waiver or
release under any standstill or similar agreement with respect to any class
of equity securities of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries ( _provided_
that if the Board of Directors of the Company determines in good faith that
failure to take such action would be reasonably likely to be inconsistent with
its duties under Applicable Law, then (I) the Company may waive any such
standstill or similar agreement to the extent necessary to permit the Person
bound by such provision or agreement to make a Company Acquisition Proposal to
the Board of Directors of the Company and (II) concurrently with such waiver
by the Company, any such waived standstill or similar provisions in the
Company Confidentiality Agreement shall immediately and automatically cease
to be of any force or effect). Any breach or willful breach of the
restrictions on the Company set forth in this Section 6.03(a) by any
Subsidiary of the Company or any of its or their respective
Representatives shall be deemed to be a breach or willful breach (as
applicable) of this Section 6.03(a) by the Company.

  



  

(b) Notwithstanding Section 6.03(a), if at any time prior to the receipt
of the Company Stockholder Approval (the "Company Approval Time"; it being
understood and agreed that the Company Approval Time shall be deemed to have
occurred upon delivery of the Written Consent) (and in no event on or after
the Company Approval Time), the Board of Directors of the Company receives a
_bona fide_ written Company Acquisition Proposal made after the date hereof
which has not resulted from a violation of this Section 6.03, the Board of
Directors of the Company may prior to the Company Approval Time (and in no
event on or after the Company Approval Time) and, subject to compliance with
this Section 6.03(b), Section 6.03(c) and Section 6.03(e), (i) engage in
negotiations or discussions with any Third Party that, subject to the
Company's compliance with Section 6.03(a), has made after the date of this
Agreement an unsolicited _bona fide_ written Company Acquisition Proposal that
the Board of Directors of the Company determines in good faith, after
consultation with a financial advisor of nationally recognized reputation and
outside legal counsel to the Company, constitutes or is reasonably likely to
lead to a Company Superior Proposal, (ii) thereafter furnish to such Third
Party and its Representatives and financing sources nonpublic information
relating to the Company or any of its Subsidiaries pursuant to a
confidentiality agreement with terms (including "standstill" or
similar terms) no less favorable to the Company than those contained in the
Company Confidentiality Agreement, a copy of which shall be provided,
promptly after its execution, to Parent for informational purposes; _provided_
that all such non-public information (to the extent that such information has
not been previously provided or made available to Parent) is provided or made
available to Parent, as the case may be, prior to or substantially
concurrently with the time it is provided or made available to such
Third Party, and (iii) following receipt of a Company Superior Proposal after
the date of this Agreement and prior to the Company Approval Time (and in no
event on or after the Company Approval Time), (A) make a Company Adverse

  



    

83

 

    

Recommendation Change and/or (B) terminate this Agreement in accordance with
Section 10.01(d)(i) in order to cause the Company to enter into an Alternate
Company Acquisition Agreement with respect to a Company Superior Proposal (a
"Company Superior Proposal Termination"), but in each case referred to in the
foregoing clauses (i) through (iii) only if the Board of Directors of the
Company determines in good faith by majority vote, after consultation with the
Company's outside legal counsel and a financial advisor of nationally
recognized reputation, that the failure to take such action would be
reasonably likely to be inconsistent with its duties under Applicable Law.
Nothing contained herein shall prevent the Board of Directors of the
Company from (A) complying with Rule 14e-2(a) under the Securities Exchange
Act with regard to a Company Acquisition Proposal, so long as any action
taken or statement made to so comply is consistent with this Section 6.03 or
(B) making any required disclosure to the stockholders of the Company if the
Board of Directors of the Company determines in good faith, after consultation
with its outside legal counsel, that failure to take such action would be
reasonably likely to be inconsistent with Applicable Law;  _provided_ that
any Company Adverse Recommendation Change involving or relating to a Company
Acquisition Proposal and/or Company Superior Proposal Termination may only be
made in accordance with the provisions of this Section 6.03(b),
Section 6.03(c) and Section 6.03(e) and, even if permitted by this sentence,
shall have the consequences set forth in this Agreement. For the avoidance of
doubt, issuing a "stop, look and listen" disclosure or similar communication
of the type contemplated by Rule 14d-9(f) under the Securities Exchange Act
shall not be a Company Adverse Recommendation Change.

  



  

(c) In addition to the requirements set forth in Section 6.03(b), the
Board of Directors of the Company shall not take any of the actions referred
to in clauses (i) through (iii) of Section 6.03(b), other than interacting
with the Person who made such Company Acquisition Proposal and its
Representatives solely to clarify the terms and conditions thereof, unless
the Company shall have first delivered to Parent written notice advising
Parent that the Company intends to take such action. In addition, the Company
shall notify Parent promptly (but in no event later than twenty-four (24)
hours) after receipt by the Company (or any of its Representatives) of (i)
any Company Acquisition Proposal made after the date hereof or (ii) any
written request made after the date hereof for information relating to the
Company or any of its Subsidiaries or for access to the business,
properties, assets, books or records of the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries by any Third Party that, to the knowledge of the Company or any
member of its Board of Directors, is considering making, or is reasonably
likely to make after the date hereof, a Company Acquisition Proposal, which
notice shall be provided in writing and shall identify the relevant Third
Party and, to the extent known, the material terms and conditions of, any
such Company Acquisition Proposal (including any material changes thereto).
The Company shall keep Parent reasonably informed, on a reasonably current
basis, of the status and details of any such Company Acquisition Proposal
(including any changes thereto) and shall promptly (but in no event later than
twenty-four (24) hours after receipt) provide to Parent copies of all
material correspondence and written materials sent or provided to the Company
or any of its Affiliates that describes any material terms or conditions of
any such Company Acquisition Proposal (as well as written summaries of
any material oral communications addressing such matters).

  



    

84

 

    

(d) Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the contrary, at any
time prior to the Company Approval Time (and in no event on or after the
Company Approval Time), the Board of Directors of the Company may effect a
Company Adverse Recommendation Change involving or relating to the occurrence
of a Company Intervening Event if the Board of Directors of the Company
determines in good faith, after consultation with the Company's outside legal
counsel and financial advisor, that the failure to take such action would be
reasonably likely to be inconsistent with its duties under Applicable Law;
_provided_ that (i) the Company shall (A) promptly notify Parent in writing
of its intention to take such action (which notice shall set forth in
reasonable detail a description of the Company Intervening Event and the
rationale for the Company Adverse Recommendation Change) and (B) negotiate in
good faith with Parent (to the extent Parent wishes to so negotiate) for five
(5) Business Days following such notice regarding revisions to the terms of
this Agreement proposed by Parent, and (ii) the Board of Directors of the
Company shall not effect any Company Adverse Recommendation Change involving
or relating to a Company Intervening Event unless, after the five (5)
Business Day period described in the foregoing clause (B), the Board of
Directors of the Company determines in good faith by majority vote, after
consultation with the Company's outside legal counsel and financial advisor,
that the failure to take such action would be reasonably likely to be
inconsistent with its duties under Applicable Law.

  



  

(e) Without limiting or affecting Section 6.03(a), Section 6.03(b) or
Section 6.03(c), the Board of Directors of the Company shall not make a
Company Adverse Recommendation Change and/or effect a Company Superior
Proposal Termination involving or relating to a Company Superior Proposal
unless (i) the Company promptly notifies Parent, in writing at least four (4)
Business Days before taking such action, that the Company intends to take
such action, which notice attaches the most current version of any proposed
agreement or a reasonably detailed summary of all material terms of such
Company Superior Proposal and the identity of the Third Party making such
Company Superior Proposal, (ii) if requested by Parent, during such four (4)
Business Day period, the Company and its Representatives have discussed and
negotiated in good faith with Parent regarding any proposal by Parent
to amend the terms of this Agreement in response to such Company Superior
Proposal and (iii) after such four (4) Business Day period, the Board of
Directors of the Company, after discussions with the Company's outside legal
counsel and financial advisor, determines in good faith by majority vote,
taking into account any proposal by Parent to amend the terms of this
Agreement, that such Company Acquisition Proposal continues to constitute a
Company Superior Proposal (it being understood and agreed that in the event
of any amendment to the financial terms or other material terms of any such
Company Superior Proposal, a new written notification from the Company
consistent with that described in clause (i) of this Section 6.03(e) shall be
required and a new notice period under clause (i) of this Section 6.03(e)
shall commence, during which notice period the Company shall be required to
comply with the requirements of this Section 6.03(e) anew, except that such
new notice period shall be for two (2) Business Days (as opposed to four (4)
Business Days)). After delivery of such written notice pursuant to the
immediately preceding sentence until the termination of this Agreement in
accordance with its terms, the Company shall promptly keep Parent informed of
all material developments affecting the material terms of any such Company
Superior Proposal (and the Company shall provide Parent with copies of any
additional written materials received that relate to such Company Superior
Proposal).

  



    

85

 

    

(f) For purposes of this Agreement, "Company Superior Proposal" means any
_bona fide_ , written, Company Acquisition Proposal (other than a Company
Acquisition Proposal which has resulted from a violation of this Section
6.03) (with all references to "15%" in the definition of Company Acquisition
Proposal being deemed to be references to "50%") on terms that the Board of
Directors of the Company determines in good faith by majority vote, after
consultation with a financial advisor of nationally recognized reputation and
the Company's outside legal counsel, and taking into account all the
terms and conditions of the Company Acquisition Proposal (including the
identity of the Person making the Company Acquisition Proposal and the
expected timing and likelihood of consummation, any governmental or other
approval requirements (including divestitures and entry into other
commitments and limitations), break-up fees, expense reimbursement provisions,
conditions to consummation, availability of necessary financing and all other
financial, regulatory, legal and other aspects of such Company Acquisition
Proposal), would result in a transaction (i) that, if consummated, is more
favorable to the Company's stockholders from a financial point of view than
the Transactions (taking into account any proposal by Parent to amend the
terms of this Agreement proposed pursuant to Section 6.03(e)), (ii) that is
reasonably capable of being completed on the terms proposed (taking into
account the identity of the Person making the Company Acquisition Proposal,
any approval requirements and all other financial, regulatory, legal and
other aspects of such Company Acquisition Proposal) and (iii) for which
financing, if a cash transaction (whether in whole or in part), is then fully
committed and reasonably determined to be available by the Board of Directors
of the Company.

  



  

(g) "Company Intervening Event" means any material event, circumstance,
development, change, occurrence or effect occurring or arising after the date
of this Agreement that (i) was not known or reasonably foreseeable, or the
material consequences of which were not known or reasonably foreseeable, in
each case to the Board of Directors of the Company as of or prior to the date
of this Agreement, and (ii) does not relate to (A) the receipt, existence, or
terms of a Company Acquisition Proposal, or (B) any event, development, or
change in circumstances resulting from a breach of this Agreement by the
Company or any action relating to any Closing Condition Regulatory Approvals
(including the status thereof) taken pursuant to or in compliance with
Section 8.01; _provided_ that, in any case, in no event shall any of the
following events constitute a Company Intervening Event: (1) any decline, in
and of itself, in the market price or trading volume of Parent Common Stock,
any changes in credit ratings and any changes in any analysts'
recommendations or ratings with respect to Parent or any of its
Subsidiaries (but not including, in each case, the underlying causes
thereof); (2) any failure, in and of itself, by Parent or any of its
Subsidiaries to meet any internal or published projections, forecasts,
estimates or predictions in respect of revenues, earnings or other
financial or operating metrics for any period (but not including, in each
case, the underlying causes thereof); and (3) compliance with or performance
under this Agreement or the transactions contemplated by this Agreement.

  



  

(h) The Company shall, and shall cause its Affiliates and its and its
Affiliates' respective Representatives to, cease immediately and cause to be
terminated any and all existing activities, discussions or negotiations, if
any, with any Third Party conducted prior to the date of this Agreement with
respect to any Company Acquisition Proposal and shall use its reasonable
best efforts to cause any such Third Party (and its agents or advisors) in
possession of

  



    

86

 

    

confidential information about the Company that was furnished by or on behalf
of the Company to such Persons to return or destroy all such information.

Agreement to the contrary, until termination of this Agreement (including a
Company Superior Proposal Termination), (x) in no event may the Company or
any of its Subsidiaries (A) enter into any agreement in principle, letter of
intent, term sheet, merger agreement, acquisition agreement, option
agreement, joint venture agreement, partnership agreement or other similar
instrument constituting or relating to a Company Acquisition Proposal (an
"Alternate Company Acquisition Agreement") (other than a confidentiality
agreement in accordance with Section 6.03(b) or an Alternate Company
Acquisition Agreement with respect to a Company Superior Proposal pursuant to
Section 6.03(b)), (B) except as required by Applicable Law, make, facilitate
or provide information in connection with any SEC or other Filings in
connection with the transactions contemplated by any Company Acquisition
Proposal or (C) seek any Consents in connection with the transactions
contemplated by any Company Acquisition Proposal and (y) the Company shall
otherwise remain subject to all of its obligations under this Agreement,
including, for the avoidance of doubt, the obligation to solicit the Company
Stockholder Approval; _provided that_ , for the avoidance of doubt, the
Company may effect a Company Superior Proposal Termination pursuant to the
terms of _Section 6.03(b)_ , upon which it shall have no obligation to
solicit the Company Stockholder Approval.

Deadline" means 5:00 p.m. Eastern Time on the first (1st) Business Day after

accordance with Applicable Law and the applicable Advisory Agreement, as
promptly as reasonably practicable after the date of this Agreement, the
Consent of each Client (other than a Fund) for which Consent to the assignment
or deemed assignment of such Client's Advisory Agreement with the Company or
any of its Subsidiaries is required by Applicable Law or by such Client's
Advisory Agreement as a result of the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement. In furtherance thereof, except in the case of an Affirmative
Consent Client, as promptly as reasonably practicable after the date of this
Agreement and provided that the same is not prohibited by the applicable
Advisory Agreement or Applicable Law, the Company shall, and shall cause its
Subsidiaries to, as applicable, send a written notice (the "Negative Consent

Agreement, which shall be in form and substance reasonably satisfactory to
Parent, to such Clients informing each Client: (i) of the transactions

transactions contemplated by this Agreement, which will result in an
assignment or deemed assignment of such Advisory Agreement; (iii) of the
intention of the Company or the applicable Subsidiary to continue to provide
the advisory services pursuant to the existing Advisory Agreement with such
Client after the Closing if such

  



    

87

any such Client shall be deemed a Non-Consenting Client unless and until such
Client has provided its written consent to the assignment or deemed
assignment of such Client's Advisory Agreement.

  



  

(b) _Private Funds_. The Company shall use commercially reasonable
efforts to obtain with respect to each Private Fund, in accordance with
Applicable Law and the applicable Fund Documents, as promptly as reasonably
practicable after the date of this Agreement, (i) the Consent of such Private

deemed assignment of such Private Fund's Advisory Agreement with the Company
or any of its Subsidiaries is required by Applicable Law or by such Private
Fund's Fund Documents as a result of the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement and (ii) any Additional Private Fund Consent applicable to such

to complete the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, which will
result in an assignment or deemed assignment of the Advisory Agreement with
the Private Fund, and (Y) to continue to provide the advisory services
pursuant to the existing Advisory Agreement with such Private Fund after the
Closing so long as a majority-in-interest (or such higher percentage as may be
required under the applicable Fund Documents) of the investors provide (and
do not withdraw) their consent to the assignment or deemed assignment of such
Private Fund's Advisory Agreement; _provided_ that

  



    

88

 

    

any Private Fund described in clause (A) shall be deemed a Non-Consenting
Client unless and until a majority-in-interest (or such higher percentage as
may be required under the applicable Fund Documents) of the investors provide
(and have not withdrawn) their written consent to the assignment or deemed
assignment of such Private Fund's Advisory Agreement, and any Private Fund
described in clause (B) shall be deemed a Non-Consenting Client unless and
until a majority-in-interest (or such higher percentage as may be required

above) in the applicable Private Fund informing each investor: (A) of the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement; (B) of the intention to complete

the investors consent or are deemed to have consented to the assignment;
and (D) that the consent of such investor will be deemed to have been granted
if such investor does not expressly object in writing to such assignment
within forty-five (45) days after the sending of the Private Fund Negative
Consent Notice; _provided _ that any Private Fund described in clause (ii)
shall be deemed a Non-Consenting Client unless and until a majority-in-
interest (or such higher percentage as may be required under the applicable
Fund Documents) of the investors shall be deemed in the aggregate to have
provided (and not withdrawn) their consent to the assignment or deemed
assignment of such Private Fund's Advisory Agreement. Notwithstanding the
foregoing, with respect to any Private Fund for which an Additional Private
Fund Consent is required, such Private Fund shall be deemed a Non-Consenting
Client until such Additional Private Fund Consent has been obtained or
deemed to have been obtained in accordance with Applicable Law and the
applicable Fund Documents and remains in full force and effect at Closing.

obtaining Consents in respect of Non-U.S. Retail Funds.

RIA Subsidiaries to, use their respective commercially reasonable efforts to,

(C) use commercially reasonable efforts to ensure that such Public Fund Board
(it being understood for all purposes of this Agreement that the Company does
not control any Public Fund Board) submits, as promptly as practicable
following the mailing of the proxy materials, to the shareholders of such
Public Fund for a vote at a shareholders meeting the proposal to approve the
Public Fund Shareholder Approval Items. The Company shall provide Parent with
drafts of the proxy materials (and any SEC comments thereto) on a timely basis
and Parent shall have the right to review in advance of submission to the SEC
the proxy materials (and any amendment or supplement thereto) to be furnished
to the shareholders of any Public Fund and to (1) approve information or data
that is provided by or on behalf of Parent or its Affiliates specifically for
inclusion in such proxy materials, and (2) provide reasonable comments on
such proxy materials which the Company (in coordination with the applicable
Public Fund and under the general direction of the applicable Public Fund
Board) will use commercially reasonable efforts to include therein.

  



  

(iii) As soon as possible following the date of this Agreement, the Company
shall use its commercially reasonable efforts to cause each Public Fund then
engaged in a public offering of its shares to (A) file supplements or
amendments to its prospectus forming a part of its registration statement
then currently in use, which supplements or amendments shall disclose the
transactions contemplated hereby to the extent required by Applicable Law,
and (B) make any other filing necessary under any Applicable Law to satisfy
in all material respects disclosure requirements in connection with the public
distribution of the shares of that Public Fund. Parent shall have the right
to provide reasonable comments on such materials to the same extent as
provided in Section 6.05(c)(ii).

  



  

(iv) The Company agrees that the information in the proxy materials to be
furnished to the shareholders of any Public Fund (other than information that
is or will be provided by or on behalf of Parent or any other third party
specifically for inclusion in such proxy materials) will not contain, as of
the date of such proxy materials, any untrue statement of a material fact, or
omit to state any material fact necessary to make the statements therein, in
light of the circumstances under which they were made, not misleading;
_provided that_ in the case of a Public Fund that is not sponsored by the
Company or its Subsidiaries, the foregoing agreement of the Company shall
apply only to information provided by it or its Subsidiaries in writing
specifically for inclusion in such proxy materials. Parent agrees that the
information provided by it (or on its behalf) in writing specifically for
inclusion in the proxy materials to be furnished to the shareholders of any
Public Fund will not contain, as of the date of such proxy materials, any
untrue statement of a material fact, or omit to state any material fact
necessary to make the statements therein, in light of the circumstances under
which they were made, not misleading.

(v) In addition to the agreements described in this Section 6.05(c) and
notwithstanding anything to the contrary, the Company may in its own
discretion, or upon the request of Parent (such request not to be unreasonably
denied or delayed), seek Interim Public Fund IAA Approval. The Company shall
reasonably consult with Parent prior to seeking an Interim Public Fund
IAA Approval in its own discretion. In addition, if it is reasonably likely
that the Closing will occur before the Public Fund Board Approval or Public
Fund Shareholder Approval has been obtained for a Public Fund, the Company and
Parent shall cooperate and use their commercially reasonable efforts to
obtain an Interim Public Fund IAA Approval in respect of such Public Fund. In
no event shall seeking or obtaining an Interim Public Fund IAA Approval in
respect of a Public Fund relieve the parties of their obligations under
Section 6.05(c)(i)-(iv) with respect to such Public Fund. The foregoing
notwithstanding, (i) an Interim Public Fund IAA Approval shall not constitute
Public Fund Board Approval in respect of a Public Fund and (ii) the parties
agree that a Public Fund shall be deemed a Consenting Client for all purposes
under this Agreement only if either (A) Public Fund Board Approval and Public
Fund Shareholder Approval (unless such approval is not required as provided
under Section 6.05(c)(i)(B)) has been obtained and is in full force and
effect at the Closing for the Public Fund IAA Approval.

  



  

(d) _Non-U.S. Retail Funds_. With respect to any Non-U.S. Retail Fund, as
promptly as practicable following the date of this Agreement, to the extent
required by Applicable Law or the terms of the existing Advisory Agreement
with such Fund, the Company shall (or shall cause one of its Subsidiaries to)
(i) provide notice of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement to
such Fund and, where required by Applicable Law, to the investors in such
Fund, and (ii) use commercially reasonable efforts to obtain any material
approval, consent, deemed approval, deemed consent or other similar action, if
any, that is required from or by the board of directors or other comparable
governing body of such Fund, the investors in such Fund or any regulating or
self-regulating authority for such Fund, so that, after the Closing, the
applicable Company RIA Subsidiary may continue to provide Investment Advisory
Services to such Non-U.S. Retail Fund following the Closing Date.

  



  

(e) Parent and Company agree that any new Client that is not a Fund that
enters into an Advisory Agreement with a Company RIA Subsidiary between the
date of this Agreement and the Closing shall be deemed a Consenting Client for
all purposes under this Agreement if (i) the Consent (or, as applicable,
deemed Consent) of such new Client to the assignment or deemed assignment
of such Client's Advisory Agreement with the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries as result of the Transactions has been obtained in accordance
with this Section 6.05 or (ii) the Company has disclosed in writing, in
accordance with Applicable Law, the assignment or deemed assignment of such
Client's Advisory Agreement with the Company or any of its Subsidiaries as
result of the Transactions to such new Client before such new Client became a
Client and, in any case under the foregoing _clauses (i)_ or _(ii)_ , such
new Client has not, prior to Closing, terminated in writing its Advisory
Agreement or revoked in writing its Consent.

  



  

(f) In connection with obtaining the Client consents and other actions
required by this Section 6.05, at all times prior to the Effective Time, the
Company shall take reasonable steps to keep Parent promptly informed of the
status of obtaining such Client consents (including notifying the Parent in
advance of any offer to make any Client Economic Term

  



    

91

 

    

Changes or Permitted Client Non-Economic Term Changes with respect to
Material Advisory Agreements and of the actual making of any Client Economic
Term Changes) and, upon Parent's reasonable request, make available to Parent
copies of all such executed Client consents and make available for Parent's
inspection the originals of such consents and any related materials and other
records relating to the Client consent process. Without limiting the
foregoing, in connection with obtaining the Client consents required under
this Section 6.05, Parent shall have the right to review in advance of
distribution any notices or other materials to be distributed by the Company
or any of its Subsidiaries to Clients and shall have the right to have its
reasonable comments reflected therein prior to distribution. In addition,
commencing with the first month-end that is two months following the date
hereof, the Company shall provide, within ten (10) Business Days after such
month-end, Parent with updated calculations of the Revenue Run Rate of all
Consenting Clients, individually and in the aggregate, as of such time
(calculated in accordance with clause (b) of the definition of Revenue Run
Rate) with reasonable supporting detail. In no event shall the Company or any
Subsidiary thereof be required to offer or grant any material accommodation
or material alteration of terms (financial or otherwise) in respect of any
Client for the purpose of obtaining the Client consents contemplated by this
Section 6.05.

  



  

Section 6.06.   _Client Consent Percentage._ On the date immediately
following the date upon which the Calculation Time occurs, the Company shall
deliver to Parent its good faith calculation of the Closing Revenue Run-Rate
and the Client Consent Percentage calculated based thereon, together with
reasonable supporting detail with respect to the calculations thereof. To the
extent reasonably requested by Parent, the Company shall promptly make
available (during normal business hours) to Parent the employees and
Representatives of the Company involved in, and records used in, preparing
the calculation of the Closing Revenue Run-Rate and the Client
Consent Percentage. The Company and Parent shall work in good faith to
resolve any disagreements with respect to the calculation of the Closing
Revenue Run-Rate and the Client Consent Percentage.

  



  

Section 6.07.   _280G Calculation._ As soon as practicable, but in no
event later than thirty (30) Business Days after the date hereof, the Company
will make available to Parent true and correct copies of preliminary Section
280G calculations (based on the assumptions set forth in the applicable
calculations) with respect to each "disqualified individual" (within the
meaning of Section 280G of the Code) who is reasonably likely to receive
payments or benefits in connection with the Transactions that would not be
deductible under Section 280G of the Code.

  



  

Section 6.08.   _Special Dividend_. Subject to Applicable Law and the
satisfaction or waiver of all of the conditions set forth in Article 9 (other
than conditions that by their nature are to be satisfied at the Closing, but
subject to the satisfaction or, to the extent permitted by Applicable Law,
waiver of such conditions by the party or parties entitled to the benefit
thereof at the Closing), prior to the Effective Time and in connection with
the Closing, subject to Applicable Law, the Company shall (a) declare and,
prior to the Effective Time, pay a cash dividend per share of Company Stock
equal to $4.25 (the "Special Dividend Per Share Amount") to holders of record
of shares of Company Stock (for the avoidance of doubt, excluding the holders
of Company Equity Awards that will be accelerated and/or converted after the
date hereof in connection with the Mergers; it being agreed that a holder of
a Company

  



    

92

 

    

Equity Award shall not benefit from the Special Dividend more than once in
respect of such Company Equity Award (or any shares underlying such award))
(the "Special Dividend") and (b) provide to the transfer agent for the
Company Stock all of the cash necessary to pay the Special Dividend to be
paid pursuant to this Section 6.08, which cash shall not form part of the
Exchange Fund; _provided_ , _however_ , that the Company shall have the right
to declare and pay all or any portion of the Special Dividend at any time
prior to the Effective Time. For the avoidance of doubt, in no event shall
Parent or any of its Affiliates have any obligation, or be subject to any
liability, to pay or fund the Special Dividend.

  



  

ARTICLE 7 _ 
 Covenants of Parent_

  



  

Section 7.01.   _Conduct of Parent_. From the date of this Agreement
until the earlier of the Effective Time and the valid termination of this
Agreement, except (x) as required by Applicable Law, (y) as set forth in
Section 7.01 of the Parent Disclosure Schedule, or (z) as otherwise required
or expressly permitted by this Agreement, unless the Company shall otherwise
consent in writing (which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld,
conditioned or delayed), Parent shall not, and shall cause each of its
Subsidiaries not to:

  



  

(a) adopt or propose any change to the Parent Organizational Documents
(whether by merger, consolidation or otherwise) in a manner that would be
materially adverse to the Company's stockholders;

  



  

(b) (i) merge or consolidate with any other Person or (ii) acquire
(including by merger, consolidation, acquisition of stock or assets or entry
into joint venture) any interest in any corporation, partnership, other
business organization or any division thereof or any assets, securities or
property (except in the ordinary course of business), in each case in this
clause (b) that, individually or in the aggregate, would, or would reasonably
be expected to, prevent, enjoin or delay beyond the End Date the receipt of
the Closing Condition Regulatory Approvals;

  



  

(c) adopt or propose a plan of complete or partial merger, liquidation,
consolidation, recapitalization, restructuring or other reorganization or
dissolution with respect to Parent, Merger Sub 1 or Merger Sub 2, or
resolutions providing for or authorizing such a merger, liquidation,
consolidation, recapitalization, restructuring or other reorganization or
dissolution with respect to Parent, Merger Sub 1 or Merger Sub 2;

  



  

(d) declare, set aside or pay or make any dividend or make any other
distribution (whether in cash, stock, property or any combination thereof) in
respect of Parent Common Stock or any shares of any Subsidiary of Parent's
capital stock or other securities, other than (A) in the case of Parent, (x)
regular cash dividends in the ordinary course of business consistent
with past practice (including with respect to record and payment dates) or
(y) subject to Section 2.08, stock dividends, (B) dividends or distributions
by a Subsidiary of Parent to Parent or a Subsidiary of Parent or (C) dividends
or distributions required pursuant to the terms of the Parent Organizational
Documents or any other Contract to which Parent or any of its Subsidiaries is
a party or is otherwise bound; or

  



    

93

 

    

(e) agree, resolve, authorize, commit or propose to do any of the
foregoing.

  



  

Section 7.02.   _Obligations of the Merger Subs_. Until the Effective
Time, Parent shall at all times be the direct owner of all of the outstanding
shares of capital stock of Merger Sub 1 and, until the Second Merger Effective
Time, Parent shall at all times be the direct owner of all of the outstanding
limited liability company interests of Merger Sub 2. Parent shall take all
action necessary to cause each of Merger Sub 1 and Merger Sub 2 to perform
its respective obligations under this Agreement and to consummate the Mergers
on the terms and conditions set forth in this Agreement. Promptly following
the execution of this Agreement, Parent shall cause (i) the sole stockholder
of Merger Sub 1 to execute and deliver a written consent approving the First
Merger in accordance with the MGCL and its organizational documents and
provide a copy of such written consent to the Company, and (ii) the sole
member of Merger Sub 2 to execute and deliver a written consent approving the
Second Merger in accordance with the LLC Act and its organizational documents
and provide a copy of such written consent to the Company. Thereafter, neither
Parent nor any of its Subsidiaries shall amend, modify or withdraw either
such consent.

  



  

Section 7.03.   _Director and Officer Liability_. (a) For a period of six
(6) years after the Effective Time, the Surviving Company and Parent shall
(with respect to Parent, only to the extent the Surviving Company is permitted
to do so under Applicable Law), jointly and severally, shall indemnify and
hold harmless and shall advance expenses as incurred, in each case to the
extent (subject to Applicable Law) such Persons are indemnified as of the
date of this Agreement by the Company pursuant to the Company
Organizational Documents, the governing or organizational documents of any
Subsidiary of the Company and/or the Voting Trust Agreement, each present and
former director and officer of the Company and its Subsidiaries and any Person
acting as a Voting Trustee under the Voting Trust Agreement (in each case,
when acting in such capacity) (collectively, the "Company Indemnified
Parties") against any costs or expenses (including reasonable attorneys'
fees), judgments, fines, losses, damages or liabilities incurred in
connection with any threatened or actual Proceeding, whether civil, criminal,
administrative or investigative, whether arising before or after the
Effective Time, arising out of the fact that such person is or was a director
or officer of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries or a Voting Trustee
under the Voting Trust Agreement and pertaining to matters existing or
occurring at or prior to the Effective Time, including the Transactions;
_provided_ , that in the case of advancement of expenses, any Company
Indemnified Party to whom expenses are advanced provides an undertaking to
repay such advances if it is ultimately determined that such Company
Indemnified Party is not entitled to indemnification; _provided_ , _further_ ,
that (i) such indemnification shall be subject to any limitation imposed from
time to time under Applicable Law and (ii) if any valid claim for
indemnification is made hereunder by a Company Indemnified Party prior to six
(6) years after the Effective Time, such indemnification obligation will
survive (solely with respect to such claim) until the final resolution of the
matter giving rise to such claim.

  



  

(b) For a period of six (6) years after the Effective Time, Parent shall
cause to be maintained in effect policies of directors' and officers'
liability insurance with terms, conditions, retentions and limits of liability
that are at least as favorable to the Company

  



    

94

 

    

Indemnified Parties as such policies maintained by the Company as of the date
hereof with respect to claims arising from facts or events which occurred at
or before the Effective Time; _provided_ , _however_ , that Parent shall not
be obligated to expend, on an aggregate basis, an amount in excess of 300% of
the current annual premium paid as of the date hereof by the Company for
such insurance (the "Premium Cap"), and if such premiums for such insurance
would at any time exceed the Premium Cap or such coverage is not otherwise
available, then Parent shall cause to be maintained policies of insurance
which, in Parent's good faith determination, provide the maximum coverage
available at an aggregate premium equal to the Premium Cap. In lieu of the
obligations set forth in the foregoing sentence, Parent or the Company may
obtain at or prior to the Effective Time a six (6)-year "tail" policy under
the Company's existing directors' and officers' insurance policy
providing equivalent coverage to that described in the preceding sentence if
and to the extent that the same may be obtained for an amount that, in the
aggregate, does not exceed the Premium Cap.

  



  

(c) The provisions of this Section 7.03 shall survive the Effective Time
and are intended to be for the benefit of, and shall be enforceable by, each
Company Indemnified Party and his or her heirs and representatives. If Parent
or the Surviving Company or any of their respective successors or assigns (i)
consolidates with or merges into any other person and is not the
continuing or surviving entity of such consolidation or merger, or (ii)
transfers all or substantially all of its assets to any other person, then in
each such case, Parent will cause, to the extent necessary, proper provision
to be made so that the successors and assigns of Parent or the Surviving
Company, as applicable, will assume the obligations set forth in this Section
7.03.

  



  

Section 7.04.   _Employee Matters_. (a) Parent shall or shall cause the
Surviving Company to provide each Company Personnel who is as of the
Effective Time in the service of Parent or the Surviving Company or a
Subsidiary of either ("Continuing Personnel"), during the period commencing
at the Effective Time and ending one (1) year thereafter (the "Continuation
Period"), with (i) base salary or base wage rate that is no less favorable
than the base salary or base wage rate provided to such Continuing Personnel
by the Company and its Subsidiaries immediately prior to the Effective Time,
and (ii) target annual incentive opportunities that are, in the aggregate, no
less favorable than the target annual incentive opportunities (taking into
account annual incentive compensation payable in either cash or the grant of
an equity award) provided to such Continuing Personnel by the Company and its
Subsidiaries immediately prior to the Effective Time; _provided_ that, Parent
or the Surviving Company, as applicable, may implement base salary and/or
target annual incentive opportunity reductions for Continuing Personnel to
the extent any such reductions are made for substantially all similarly
situated employees of Parent and its Subsidiaries, including the Surviving
Company, in response to or in connection with the COVID-19 pandemic and (ii)
employee health and welfare benefits (excluding defined benefit pension
benefits, retiree health and welfare and severance benefits) that are in the
case of Continuing Personnel employed by the Company and its Subsidiaries, at
the discretion of Parent, either substantially comparable in the aggregate to
those (1) provided to such Continuing Personnel by the Company and its
Subsidiaries immediately prior to the Effective Time, or (2) that are
generally made available to similarly situated employees of Parent and its
Subsidiaries from time to time. Additionally, Parent agrees that each
Continuing Personnel shall, during the Continuation Period, be provided with

  



    

95

 

    

severance benefits (including the payment of transitional or notice pay) that
are no less favorable than the severance benefits (including the payment of
transitional or notice pay) provided by the Company and its Subsidiaries to
such Continuing Personnel pursuant to the Company practices set forth in
Section 7.04(a) of the Company Disclosure Schedule.

  



  

(b) In the event any Continuing Personnel first becomes eligible to
participate under any Parent Employee Plan following the Effective Time,
Parent shall, or shall cause its Subsidiaries to use commercially reasonable
efforts: (i) to waive, or cause to be waived, any preexisting conditions,
exclusions, limitations and waiting periods with respect to participation and
coverage requirements applicable to such Continuing Personnel under any
Parent Employee Plan providing medical, dental or vision benefits to the same
extent such limitation would have been waived or satisfied under the
applicable Company Employee Plan such Continuing Personnel participated in
immediately prior to coverage under such Parent Employee Plan and (ii) provide
such Continuing Personnel with credit for any copayments and deductibles paid
under a Company Employee Plan during the calendar year in which the
Closing Date occurs for purposes of satisfying such year's co-payment and
deductible limitations under the relevant Parent Employee Plan in which such
Continuing Personnel is eligible to participate from and after the Closing
Date, to the same extent such credit was given under the Company Employee
Plan such Continuing Personnel participated in immediately prior to coverage
under such Parent Employee Plan in satisfying any applicable deductible or
out-of-pocket requirements under such Parent Employee Plan.

  



  

(c) As of the Effective Time, Parent shall, or shall cause its
Subsidiaries to, recognize all service of each Continuing Personnel prior to
the Effective Time with the Company and its Subsidiaries (including any
respective predecessors to the extent the Company has provided Parent with
all reasonably necessary records documenting such service with such
predecessors) for all purposes (except for equity compensation vesting),
under any benefit plan or arrangement of Parent, the Surviving Company or any
of their respective Subsidiaries providing benefits to such Continuing
Personnel after the Effective Time to the same extent such service credit
was granted under any benefit plan or arrangement of the Company or any of
its Subsidiaries. In no event shall anything contained in this Section
7.04(c) result in any duplication of benefits for the same period of service.

  



  

(d) Prior to the Closing Date, the Company shall take all actions that may
be necessary or appropriate to cause, as of the day immediately preceding the
Closing Date, each Company Employee Plan that, not later than five Business
Days prior to the Closing Date, Parent requests that the Company terminate;
_provided_ that such termination is permitted under Section 409A of the Code.
All resolutions, notices, participant communications or other documents
issued, adopted or executed in connection with the termination of such
Company Employee Plans shall be subject to Parent's prior review and approval.
Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Company shall not terminate any Company
Employee Plan that Parent has requested that the Company terminate if, not
later than five Business Days prior to the Closing Date, Parent requests that
the Company not terminate such Company Employee Plan.

  



  

(e) If at least five Business Days prior to the Effective Time, Parent
directs the Company to terminate the Company 401(k) Plan, the Company shall
do so, effective as of immediately prior to the Effective Time. The plan shall
be amended to provide for a profit

  



    

96

 

    

sharing contribution with respect to compensation earned through the
Effective Time and, in connection with the termination of such plan, Parent
shall permit each Continuing Personnel to make rollover contributions of
"eligible rollover distributions" (within the meaning of Section 401(a)(31)
of the Code, including all participant loans) in cash or notes (in the case of
participant loans) in an amount equal to the eligible rollover distribution
portion of the account balance distributed to each such Continuing Personnel
from such plan to an "eligible retirement plan" (within the meaning of Section
401(a)(31) of the Code) of Parent or any of its Subsidiaries (a "Parent
Qualified Plan"). If the Company 401(k) Plan is terminated as described
herein, the Continuing Personnel shall be eligible immediately upon the
Closing Date to commence participation in a Parent Qualified Plan.

  



  

(f) Notwithstanding what is set forth in Section 7.04(d), prior to the
Effective Time, the Board of Directors of the Company or the appropriate
committee thereof shall take all actions reasonably necessary, including
adopting any resolutions or amendments and providing any notices to
participants, (which resolutions, amendments and notices, if applicable, shall
be reasonably satisfactory to Parent) with respect to each Company ESPP to:
(i) cause the Plan Period (as defined in the applicable Company ESPP)
ongoing as of the date of this Agreement to be the final Plan Period under
such Company ESPP and the options under such Company ESPP to be exercised on
the earlier of (x) the scheduled purchase date for such Plan Period and (y)
the date that is ten Business Days prior to the Closing Date (with any
participant payroll deductions not applied to the purchase of shares of
Company Non-Voting Common Stock promptly returned to the participant), (ii)
prohibit any individual who is not participating in such Company ESPP as of
the date of this Agreement from commencing participation in such Company ESPP
following the date of this Agreement, (iii) prohibit participants in such
Company ESPP from increasing their payroll deductions from those in effect as
of the date of this Agreement and (iv) terminate such Company ESPP as of, and
subject to, the Effective Time.

  



  

(g) Without limiting the generality of Section 11.06, nothing contained in
this Section 7.04 or elsewhere in this Agreement, express or implied (i)
shall cause either Parent or any of its Affiliates to be obligated to continue
to employ any Person, including any Continuing Personnel, for any period of
time following the Effective Time, (ii) shall prevent Parent or its
Affiliates from revising, amending or terminating any Company Employee Plan or
any other employee benefit plan, program or policy in effect from time to
time, (iii) shall be construed as an amendment of any Company Employee Plan or
Parent Employee Plan, or (iv) shall create any third-party beneficiary rights
in any director, officer, employee or individual Person, including
any present or former employee, officer, director or individual independent
contractor of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries (including any
beneficiary or dependent of such individual).

  



  

Section 7.05.   _Section 15(f) of the Investment Company Act._ (a)
Parent acknowledges that the Company has entered into this Agreement in
reliance upon the benefits and protections provided by Section 15(f) of the
Investment Company Act. In furtherance (and not in limitation) of the
foregoing, Parent shall, and shall cause its Subsidiaries to, use reasonable
best efforts after the Effective Time to conduct its business to enable the
following to be true regarding Section 15(f) of the Investment Company Act in
relation to any Public Fund for which any Subsidiary of the Company provides
Investment Advisory Services: (a) for a period of not

  



    

97

 

    

less than three (3) years after the Effective Time, no more than 25% of the
members of the board of directors or trustees of any Public Fund sponsored by
the Company or any of its Subsidiaries shall be "interested persons" (as
defined in the Investment Company Act) of any investment adviser for such
Public Fund immediately prior to the Effective Time, or any investment
adviser for such Public Fund following the Effective Time, and (b) for a
period of not less than two (2) years after the Effective Time, neither
Parent nor any of its Affiliates shall impose an "unfair burden" (within the
meaning of the Investment Company Act, including any interpretations or no-
action letters of the SEC) on any Public Fund (whether or not sponsored by
the Company or any of its Subsidiaries) as a result of the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement or any express or implied terms, conditions or
understandings applicable thereto.

  



  

(b) For a period of three (3) years after the Closing Date, Parent shall
not engage, and shall cause its Affiliates not to engage, in any transaction
that would constitute an "assignment" (as that term is defined under
applicable provisions of the Investment Company Act and interpreted by the
SEC) to a third party of any Advisory Agreement between Parent or any of its
Affiliates and any Public Fund, without first using reasonable best efforts to
obtain from the counterparty to such transaction a covenant in all material
respects comparable to that contained in this Section 7.05.

  



  

Section 7.06.   _Registration Procedures and Expenses_. Parent shall use
its reasonable best efforts to file with the SEC, within one (1) Business Day
following the Closing, an automatic shelf registration statement (as defined
in Rule 405 under the Securities Act) on Form S-3 (an "Automatic Shelf
Registration Statement") (or, if Parent does not qualify as a well-
known seasoned issuer as defined in Rule 405 under the Securities Act, a
registration statement (which shall be on Form S-3 if Parent is then eligible
to use such form)) permitting the public resale of all shares of Parent Common
Stock issued pursuant to the Parent Share Issuance to the Voting Trust and/or
any of the Voting Trustees (the "Registrable Securities") on a delayed or
continuous basis pursuant to Rule 415 of the Securities Act in accordance with
the requirements of the Securities Act and the rules and regulations of the
SEC thereunder (such registration statement, the "Resale Registration
Statement").  If the Resale Registration Statement is not an Automatic Shelf
Registration Statement, Parent shall use its reasonable best efforts to cause
the Resale Registration Statement to be declared effective by the SEC as soon
as practicable after the filing thereof.  Parent shall use its reasonable
best efforts to maintain the effectiveness of the Resale Registration
Statement until the earlier of such time as (i) all Registrable Securities
have been sold pursuant thereto and (ii) all Registrable Securities may be
sold pursuant to Rule 144 under the Securities Act and any restrictive legend
on such Registrable Securities has been removed or will be removed upon
resale. Parent agrees to indemnify and hold harmless each holder of
Registrable Securities against any losses, claims, damages or liabilities to
which such holder may become subject by reason of any untrue statement of a
material fact contained in the Resale Registration Statement or any omission
to state therein a material fact required to be stated therein or
necessary to make the statements therein, in light of the circumstances in
which they were made, not misleading, except insofar as such losses, claims,
damages or liabilities arise out of or are based upon information furnished in
writing to Parent by or on behalf of such holder for use in the Resale
Registration Statement. Parent shall have the right to assume the defense and
settlement of any claim or suit for which Parent may be responsible for
indemnification under this Section 7.06. Parent shall pay the expenses
incurred

  



    

98

 

    

by it in complying with its obligations under this Section 7.06, including
all registration and filing fees, exchange listing fees, fees and expenses of
counsel for Parent, and fees and expenses of accountants for Parent, but
excluding any brokerage fees, selling commissions or underwriting discounts
incurred by the holders of Registrable Securities in connection with sales
under the Resale Registration Statement. Notwithstanding anything to the
contrary herein, (a) Parent shall promptly notify each holder of Registrable
Securities if (i) any stop order is issued or threatened by the SEC or any
state securities commission in respect of the Resale Registration Statement
or (ii) Parent believes, in its good faith judgment, that the Resale
Registration Statement or any prospectus issued pursuant to such registration
statement may contain an untrue statement of a material fact or omit to state
any material fact required to be stated therein or necessary to make the
statements therein, in light of the circumstances in which they were made,
not misleading; and (b) in such an event, each holder of Registrable
Securities acknowledges that public sales of Registrable Securities may not
be made pursuant to the Resale Registration Statement.

  



  

ARTICLE 8 _ 
 Covenants of Parent and the Company_

  



  

Section 8.01.   _Efforts_. (a) Subject to the terms and conditions of
this Agreement, each of the Company and Parent shall use reasonable best
efforts (subject to Section 8.01(c)) to take, or cause to be taken, all
actions and to do, or cause to be done, and assist and cooperate with the
other parties in doing, all things reasonably necessary, proper or advisable
to consummate and make effective as promptly as practicable the Transactions
(including (i) preparing and filing, as promptly as practicable, with
any Governmental Authority or other Third Party all documentation to effect
all necessary Filings (including Filings pursuant to the HSR Act, which shall
be made within fifteen (15) Business Days after the date of this Agreement)
(and, absent the prior written consent of the other party, not withdrawing
any such Filings) and resubmitting any such Filings as soon as is reasonably
practicable in the event such filings are rejected for any reason whatsoever
by the relevant Governmental Authority, (ii) making as promptly as
practicable (and, in any event, within thirty (30) days) after the date of
this Agreement, all Filings necessary, proper or advisable in connection with
obtaining the Closing Condition Regulatory Approvals, and (iii) using
reasonable best efforts (subject to Section 8.01(c)) to obtain, as promptly
as practicable, all Consents required to be obtained from any Governmental
Authority or other Third Party that are necessary, proper or advisable to
consummate the Transactions and the expiration or termination of any waiting
period that suspends consummation of the Transactions). To the extent
permitted by Applicable Law, the Company and Parent shall deliver as promptly
as practicable to the appropriate Governmental Authorities any additional
information and documentary material that may be requested by any
Governmental Authority in connection with the Transactions. Without
limiting the foregoing, none of the Company or Parent or their respective
Affiliates shall extend any waiting period under the HSR Act or other
Antitrust Laws or enter into any agreement with any Governmental Authority not
to consummate the Transactions, except with the prior written consent of the
other party (which shall not be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or
delayed).

  



  

(b) Each of the Company and Parent shall, to the extent permitted by
Applicable Law, (i) promptly notify the other party of any substantive
written communication made or received by the Company or Parent, as
applicable, with any Governmental Authority

relating to Antitrust Law (or any other Filings made pursuant to this Section
8.01) and regarding this Agreement, the Mergers or any of the other
Transactions, and, if permitted by Applicable Law, use reasonable best efforts
to permit the other party to review in advance any proposed written
communication to any such Governmental Authority and consider in good faith
such other party's (and any of their respective outside counsel's) comments
to such proposed written communication, (ii) not agree to participate in any
in-person meeting or substantive discussion with any Governmental Authority in
respect of any Filing, investigation or inquiry relating to Antitrust Law (or
any other Filings made pursuant to this Section 8.01) and regarding this
Agreement or any of the Transactions unless, to the extent reasonably
practicable, it consults with such other party in advance and, to the extent
permitted by such Governmental Authority, gives such other party the
opportunity to attend or participate, as applicable, and (iii) promptly
furnish the other party with copies of all substantive correspondence, filings
and written communications between it and its Affiliates and Representatives,
on the one hand, and such Governmental Authority or its respective staff, on
the other hand, with respect to this Agreement and the Transactions. Any
materials exchanged in connection with this Section 8.01 may be redacted or
withheld as necessary to address reasonable privilege or confidentiality
concerns, and to remove references concerning the valuation of the Company or
other competitively sensitive material; _provided_ , that the parties may, as
they deem advisable and necessary, designate any materials provided to the
other under this Section 8.01 as "outside counsel only."

  



  

(c) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary set forth in this Agreement,
and in furtherance and not in limitation of the foregoing, Parent shall, and
shall cause its Subsidiaries to, use reasonable best efforts to resolve,
avoid, or eliminate impediments or objections, if any, that may be asserted
by any Governmental Authority with respect to the Transactions so as to enable
the Mergers to occur prior to the End Date. Neither the Company nor any of
its Subsidiaries shall agree to take any action in connection with the
foregoing without Parent's prior written consent; _provided_ that, at the
written request of Parent, the Company shall, and shall cause its
Subsidiaries to, agree to take any action in connection with the foregoing so
long as such action is conditioned upon the occurrence of the Closing.

  



  

(d) In the event any Proceeding by any Governmental Authority or other
Third Party is commenced which questions the validity or legality of, or
otherwise challenges, the Transactions, or seeks damages in connection
therewith, Parent and the Company shall, subject to the provisions set forth
in this Section 8.01(d), reasonably cooperate and use reasonable best efforts
to defend against such Proceeding, and if an injunction or other Order is
issued in any such Proceeding, to use reasonable best efforts to have such
injunction or other Order lifted or extinguished, and to cooperate reasonably
regarding any other impediment to the consummation of the Transactions;
provided, that, unless Parent elects to do so, nothing in this Agreement shall
require Parent to commence any litigation against any Governmental Authority.
Parent shall, in consultation with the Company, be entitled to direct the
defense of the Transactions before any Governmental Authority and to take the
lead in the scheduling of, and strategic planning for, any meetings with, and
the conducting of negotiations with, Governmental Authorities regarding (x)
the expiration or termination of any applicable waiting period relating to
the Mergers under the HSR Act, (y) any other Antitrust Law or (z) obtaining
any Parent Governmental Authorization or Company Governmental Authorization
or any other Consent

  



    

100

 

    

from a Governmental Authority, so long as Parent's actions in connection
therewith are otherwise in accordance with Parent's obligations under this
Section 8.01.

  



  

(e) As soon as reasonably practicable following the date hereof, the
Company shall cause the Company Broker-Dealer Subsidiary to prepare and
submit a FINRA Application consistent with the requirements of FINRA Rule 1017
seeking approval of the change of ownership and control of the Company
Broker-Dealer Subsidiary contemplated by the Transactions and this Agreement.
The Form of the FINRA Application shall be subject to the approval of Parent,
which approval shall not unreasonably be withheld, conditioned or delayed.
Parent shall (and shall cause its Affiliates to) timely provide to the Company
all information required to complete the FINRA Application and respond to any
further FINRA requests.

  



  

(f) Parent acknowledges and agrees that, notwithstanding anything in this
Agreement to the contrary, the Company and the Company Broker-Dealer
Subsidiary shall not be obligated to take any action that could reasonably be
expected to give rise to any requirement for a FINRA Application pursuant to
FINRA Rule 1017(a)(5) for approval of any material change in business
operations of the Company Broker-Dealer Subsidiary in connection with the
transactions contemplated hereby prior to the Closing.

  



  

(g) As soon as reasonably practicable following the date hereof, the
Company shall cause the Company Broker-Dealer Subsidiary and any other
Subsidiary of the Company that is a participant in the NSCC or any other
clearing agency subsidiary of DTCC to submit to DTCC, on behalf of such
clearing agency subsidiary, written notification regarding the change of
ownership and control of the Company Broker-Dealer Subsidiary and any such
other Subsidiaries contemplated by the Transactions and this Agreement (the
"DTCC Notification") consistent with the requirements of the rules of NSCC or
such other clearing agency, if applicable.

  



  

(h) At least thirty (30) days prior to the Closing Date, the Company shall
cause the Company Broker-Dealer Subsidiary and each CPO/CTA Subsidiary to
submit written notification regarding the change of ownership and control of
such entities to any Self-Regulatory Organization of which it is a member and
to each state or other U.S. jurisdiction in which it is registered to act as a
Broker-Dealer (the "Other Regulatory Notifications").

  



  

(i) The Company and Parent shall reasonably cooperate with each other and
their respective Representatives in obtaining any other Consents that may be
required in connection with the Transactions; _provided_ that pursuing the
Consents described in Section 6.05 and Section 8.01(a) to Section 8.01(h)
shall be governed by Section 6.05 and Section 8.01(a) to Section 8.01(h),
respectively. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement,
nothing herein shall obligate or be construed to obligate the Company or any
of its Affiliates or Parent or any of its Affiliates to, and without Parent's
prior written consent neither the Company nor any of its Affiliates shall,
make, or cause to be made, any payment or other accommodation to any Third
Party in order to obtain the Consent of such Third Party (including any Client
Consent); _provided_ that pursuing the Consents described in Section 6.05 and
Section 8.01(a) to Section 8.01(h) shall be governed by Section 6.05 and
Section 8.01(a) to Section 8.01(h), respectively.

  



    

101

 

    

Section 8.02. _Certain Filings; SEC Matters_. (a) As promptly as
practicable following the date of this Agreement, Parent and the Company shall
jointly prepare, and Parent shall file with the SEC, a Registration Statement
on Form S-4 (together with all amendments and supplements thereto, the
"Registration Statement") relating to the registration of the shares of
Parent Common Stock to be issued to the stockholders of the Company (other
than the Voting Trust, the Voting Trustees and/or the holders of Voting Trust
Receipts) pursuant to the Parent Share Issuance, which Registration Statement
shall include an information statement/prospectus relating to the Transactions
and the issuance of such shares of Parent Common Stock (the "Information
Statement/Prospectus"). The Information Statement/Prospectus and the
Registration Statement shall comply as to form in all material respects with
the applicable provisions of the Securities Act and the Securities Exchange
Act and other Applicable Law.

  



  

(b) Each of the Company and Parent shall use its reasonable best efforts
to have the Registration Statement declared effective under the Securities
Act as promptly as practicable after its filing and keep the Registration
Statement effective for so long as necessary to consummate the Mergers.
Promptly after the Registration Statement is declared effective by the SEC,
the Company shall file the Information Statement/Prospectus with the SEC.
Each of the Company and Parent shall, as promptly as practicable after the
receipt thereof, provide the other party with copies of any written comments
and advise the other party of any oral comments with respect to the
Information Statement/Prospectus and the Registration Statement received by
such party from the SEC, including any request from the SEC for amendments or
supplements to the Information Statement/Prospectus and the
Registration Statement, and shall provide the other with copies of all
material or substantive correspondence between it and its Representatives, on
the one hand, and the SEC, on the other hand. Notwithstanding the foregoing,
prior to filing the Registration Statement or mailing the Information
Statement/Prospectus or responding to any comments of the SEC with respect
thereto, each of the Company and Parent shall provide the other party and its
counsel a reasonable opportunity to review such document or response
(including the proposed final version of such document or response) and
consider in good faith the comments of the other party in connection with any
such document or response. None of the Company, Parent or their respective
Representatives shall agree to participate in any material or substantive
meeting or conference (including by telephone) with the SEC, or any member of
the staff thereof, in respect of the Registration Statement or the
Information Statement/Prospectus unless it consults with the other party in
advance and, to the extent permitted by the SEC, allows the other party to
participate. Parent shall advise the Company, promptly after receipt of
notice thereof, of the time of effectiveness of the Registration Statement,
and the issuance of any stop order relating thereto or the suspension of the
qualification of shares of Parent Common Stock for offering or sale in any
jurisdiction, and each of the Company and Parent shall use its reasonable
best efforts to have any such stop order or suspension lifted, reversed or
otherwise terminated. Each of the Company and Parent shall use its reasonable
best efforts to take any other action required to be taken by it under the
Securities Act, the Securities Exchange Act, the MGCL, the LLC Act and the
rules of the Company Stock Exchange (solely in the case of the Company) and
the Parent Stock Exchange (solely in the case of Parent) in connection with
the filing and distribution of the Information Statement/Prospectus and the
Registration Statement.

  



    

102

 

    

(c) Parent shall use its reasonable best efforts to take, or cause to be
taken, all actions, and to do or cause to be done all things, necessary,
proper or advisable under Applicable Laws and the rules and policies of the
Parent Stock Exchange and the SEC to enable the listing of the Parent Common
Stock being registered pursuant to the Registration Statement on the Parent
Stock Exchange no later than the Effective Time, subject to official notice
of issuance. Parent shall also use its reasonable best efforts to obtain all
necessary state securities law or "blue sky" permits and approvals required to
carry out the Transactions ( _provided_ that in no event shall Parent be
required to qualify to do business in any jurisdiction in which it is not
now so qualified or file a general consent to service of process).

  



  

(d) Each of the Company and Parent shall, upon request, furnish to the
other all information concerning itself, its Subsidiaries, directors,
officers and (to the extent reasonably available to the applicable party)
stockholders and such other matters as may be reasonably necessary or
advisable in connection with any statement, Filing, notice or application made
by or on behalf of the Company, Parent or any of their respective
Subsidiaries, to the SEC, the Company Stock Exchange and/or the Parent Stock
Exchange in connection with the Transactions, including the Registration
Statement and the Information Statement/Prospectus. In addition, each of the
Company and Parent shall use its reasonable best efforts to provide
information concerning it necessary to enable the Company and Parent to
prepare required pro forma financial statements and related footnotes in
connection with the preparation of the Registration Statement and/or the
Information Statement/Prospectus.

  



  

(e) If at any time prior to the Election Deadline, any information
relating to the Company or Parent, or any of their respective Affiliates,
officers or directors, should be discovered by the Company or Parent that
should be set forth in an amendment or supplement to either of the
Registration Statement or the Information Statement/Prospectus, so that either
of such documents would not include any misstatement of a material fact or
omit to state any material fact necessary to make the statements therein, in
light of the circumstances under which they were made, not misleading, the
party that discovers such information shall promptly notify the other party
hereto and an appropriate amendment or supplement describing such information
shall promptly be prepared and filed with the SEC and, to the extent required
under Applicable Law, disseminated to the stockholders of the Company.

  



  

Section 8.03.   _Public Announcements_. The initial press release
concerning this Agreement and the Transactions shall be a joint press release
to be agreed upon by the Company and Parent. Following such initial press
release, Parent and the Company shall consult with each other before issuing
any additional press release, making any other public statement or scheduling
any press conference, conference call or meeting with investors or analysts
or making or distributing any broad-based employee communication, in each
case, with respect to this Agreement or the Transactions (collectively, a
"Release") and, except as may be required by Applicable Law or any listing
agreement with or rule of any national securities exchange or association,
shall not issue any such press release, make any such other public statement
or schedule any such press conference, conference call or meeting before such
consultation (and, to the extent applicable, shall reasonably in advance
provide copies of any such press release, statement or agreement (or any
scripts for any conference calls) to the other party and shall consider in
good faith the comments of the other party); _provided_ that the restrictions
set forth in

  



    

103

 

    

this Section 8.03 shall not apply to any Release (a) made or proposed to be
made by the Company in compliance with Section 6.03 with respect to the
matters contemplated by Section 6.03, (b) if such Release does not disclose
any non-public information regarding the Transactions beyond the scope of any
previously agreed Release to which the other party had been consulted or
(c) in connection with any dispute between the parties regarding this
Agreement or the Transactions.

  



  

Section 8.04.   _Notices of Certain Events_. Each of the Company and
Parent shall promptly advise the other of (i) any notice or other material
communication from any Person alleging that the consent of such Person is or
may be required in connection with the Transactions; (ii) subject to
__Section _11.14_ , any notice or other material communication from any
Governmental Authority in connection with the Transactions; (iii) any
Proceedings commenced or, to its knowledge, threatened against, relating to or
involving or otherwise affecting the Company or any of its Subsidiaries or
Parent and any of its Subsidiaries, as the case may be, that, if pending on
the date of this Agreement, would have been required to have been disclosed
pursuant to any Section of this Agreement or that relate to the consummation
of the Transactions; (iv) any change, event or fact that has had or would be
reasonably likely to have, individually or in the aggregate, a Company
Material Adverse Effect, in the case of the Company, or a Parent
Material Adverse Effect, in the case of Parent; or (v) any change, event or
fact that it believes would or would be reasonably likely to cause or
constitute a material breach of any of its representations, warranties or
covenants contained in this Agreement; _provided _ that no such notification
shall affect the representations, warranties, covenants or agreements of the
parties (or remedies with respect thereto) or the conditions to the
obligations of the parties under this Agreement; _provided, further_ , that a
failure to comply with this Section 8.04 shall not constitute the failure of
any condition set forth in Article 9 to be satisfied unless the underlying
change or event would independently result in the failure of a condition set
forth in Article 9 to be satisfied.

  



  

Section 8.05.   _Section 16 Matters_. Prior to the Effective Time, Parent
and the Company shall take all such steps as may be required (to the extent
permitted under Applicable Law) to cause any dispositions of Company Stock
(including derivative securities with respect to Company Stock) or
acquisitions of Parent Common Stock (including derivative securities with
respect to Parent Common Stock) resulting from the Transactions by each
individual who is subject to the reporting requirements of Section 16(a) of
the Securities Exchange Act with respect to the Company, or will become
subject to such reporting requirements with respect to Parent, to be exempt
under Rule 16b-3 promulgated under the Securities Exchange Act.

  



  

Section 8.06.   _Transaction Litigation_. The Company shall promptly
notify Parent of any stockholder demands, litigations, arbitrations or other
similar Proceedings (including derivative claims) commenced against it and/or
its respective directors or officers relating to this Agreement or any of the
Transactions or any matters relating thereto (collectively, "Transaction
Litigation") and shall keep Parent informed regarding any such Transaction
Litigation. The Company (i) shall give Parent the opportunity to participate
in the defense and settlement of any Transaction Litigation, (ii) keep Parent
reasonably apprised on a prompt basis of proposed strategy and other
significant decisions with respect to any Transaction Litigation, and Parent
may offer comments or suggestions with respect to such Transaction
Litigation, which the

  



    

104

 

    

Company shall consider in good faith. The Company shall not settle or offer,
compromise or agree to settle or compromise, or take any other action to
settle, compromise or moot, any Transaction Litigation without Parent's prior
written consent (which shall not be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or
delayed).

  



  

Section 8.07.   _Stock Exchange Delisting_. Each of the Company and
Parent agrees to cooperate with the other party in taking, or causing to be
taken, all actions necessary to delist the Company Non-Voting Common Stock
from the Company Stock Exchange and terminate its registration under the
Securities Exchange Act; _provided_ that such delisting and termination shall
not be effective until the Effective Time.

  



  

Section 8.08.   _Dividends_. Except with respect to the Special Dividend,
each of the Company and Parent shall coordinate with the other regarding the
declaration and payment of dividends in respect of Company Stock and Parent
Common Stock and the record dates and payment dates relating thereto, it
being the intention of the Company and Parent that no holder of Company Stock
or Parent Common Stock shall receive two (2) dividends, or fail to receive
one (1) dividend, for any single calendar quarter with respect to its shares
of Company Stock, on the one hand, and shares of Parent Common Stock any
holder of Company Stock receives pursuant to the First Merger, on the other.

  



  

Section 8.09.   _State Takeover Statutes_. Each of Parent, Merger Sub 1,
Merger Sub 2 and the Company shall (a) take all action necessary so that no
"moratorium," "control share acquisition," "fair price,"
"supermajority," "affiliate transactions" or "business combination statute or
regulation" or other similar state anti-takeover laws or regulations, or any
similar provision of the Company Organizational Documents or the Parent
Organizational Documents, as applicable, is or becomes applicable to the
Mergers or any of the other Transactions, and (b) if any such anti-takeover
law, regulation or provision is or becomes applicable to the Mergers or any
other Transactions, cooperate and grant such approvals and take such actions
as are reasonably necessary so that the Transactions may be consummated as
promptly as practicable on the terms contemplated hereby and otherwise act to
eliminate or minimize the effects of such statute or regulation on the
Transactions.

  



  

Section 8.10.   _Tax Matters_. (a) Notwithstanding anything to the
contrary, and without limiting Section 6.01, the Company shall not effect,
outside of the ordinary course of business, any internal reorganization or
restructuring involving the Company and/or any of its Subsidiaries without
first giving Parent prior written notice thereof and consulting with Parent in
good faith with respect thereto.

  



  

(b) Each of Parent and the Company shall (and shall cause its respective
Subsidiaries and Affiliates to) use its reasonable best efforts (i) to cause
the Mergers, taken together as an integrated transaction, to qualify as a
"reorganization" within the meaning of Section 368(a) of the Code with
respect to which each of Parent, Merger Sub 2 (in the event Merger Sub 2 is
treated as a corporation for U.S. federal income tax purposes at the Second
Merger Effective Time) and the Company, as applicable, will be a "party to
the reorganization" within the meaning of Section 368(b) of the Code,
including, in the case of Parent, treating Merger Sub 2 as an entity
disregarded as separate from Parent (within the meaning of Section 301.7701-3
of the Treasury Regulations) if such treatment is reasonably determined by
counsel

  



    

105

 

    

to Parent or the Company to be necessary for the Mergers to so qualify and
for such counsel to provide the Tax opinions described in Sections 9.02(f)
and 9.03(f), as applicable, and (ii) not to take or cause to be taken any
action reasonably likely to cause, or fail to take or agree not to take any
action if the failure to take such action would be reasonably likely to cause,
the Mergers, taken together, to fail to qualify as a "reorganization" under
Section 368(a) of the Code.

  



  

(c) Parent shall use its reasonable best efforts to obtain the Tax opinion
described in Section 9.02(f) and a similar Tax opinion dated the effective
date of the Registration Statement, including a Tax opinion satisfying the
requirements of Item 601 of Regulation S-K under the Securities Act. Parent
shall use its reasonable best efforts to cause its officers and the
officers of each of Merger Sub 1 and Merger Sub 2 to execute and deliver to
counsel of the Company and Parent letters of representation customary for
transactions of this type and reasonably satisfactory to counsel of the
Company and Parent for purposes of providing the Tax opinions described in
this Section 8.10 at such time and times as such counsel shall reasonably
request, including the effective date of the Registration Statement and at
the Closing.

  



  

(d) The Company shall use its reasonable best efforts to obtain the Tax
opinion described in Section 9.03(f) and a similar Tax opinion dated the
effective date of the Registration Statement, including a Tax opinion
satisfying the requirements of Item 601 of Regulation S-K under the
Securities Act. The Company shall use its reasonable best efforts to cause its
officers to execute and deliver to counsel of the Company and Parent letters
of representation customary for transactions of this type and
reasonably satisfactory to counsel of Company and Parent for purposes of
providing the Tax opinions described in this Section 8.10 at such time and
times as such counsel shall reasonably request, including the effective date
of the Registration Statement and at the Closing.

  



  

(e) Subject to adjustment as provided in Section 2.08, (i) the Merger
Consideration per Company Share (other than any Excluded Share and Hook Stock
Shares) shall be the Per Share Cash Amount and a number of validly issued,
fully paid and non-assessable shares of Parent Common Stock equal to the
Mixed Election Stock Exchange Ratio, subject to the election procedures
described in Sections 2.04 and 2.05, (ii) the Merger Consideration per Hook
Stock Share shall be a number of validly issued, fully paid and non-
assessable shares of Parent Common Stock equal to the Fixed Exchange Ratio and
(iii) the aggregate Merger Consideration for all Company Shares (other than
Excluded Shares) shall be (A) a number of shares of Parent Common Stock equal
to the product of (x) the Mixed Election Stock Exchange Ratio and (y) the
total number of Company Shares (other than Excluded Shares and Hook
Stock Shares) issued and outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time,
subject to cash in lieu of fractional shares of Parent Common Stock as
contemplated by Section 2.09, (B) an amount of cash equal to the product of
(x) the Per Share Cash Amount and (y) the total number of Company Shares
(other than Excluded Shares and Hook Stock Shares) issued and outstanding
immediately prior to the Effective Time and (C) a number of shares of Parent
Common Stock equal to the product of (x) the Fixed Exchange Ratio and (y) the
total number of Hook Stock Shares. Accordingly, based on the advice of their
respective counsel, each of Parent and the Company agree that, absent a
change of law (including any change in the official position regarding the
application or interpretation thereof by any Governmental Authority,
including the making or issuance of any rule, regulations, ruling (including a
private letter ruling) or other form of official

  



    

106

 

    

guidance) after the date hereof, (i) this Agreement provides for "fixed
consideration" within the meaning of Treasury Regulations Section
1.368-1(e)(2)(iii), such that Treasury Regulations Section 1.368-1(e)(2)(i)
shall apply for purposes of determining whether the Mergers, taken together,
satisfy the "continuity of interest" requirement under the Code and Treasury
Regulations, and (ii) the Tax opinions described in Sections 9.02(f) and
9.03(f) shall be based on the agreements set forth in clause (i) of this
sentence. Parent and the Company intend to report, for U.S. federal income tax
purposes, the Mergers, taken together, as an integrated transaction that
qualifies as a "reorganization" within the meaning of Section 368(a) of the
Code. Notwithstanding any provision in this Agreement to the contrary, none
of Parent, the Company or any Subsidiary of either Parent or the
Company shall have any liability or obligation to any holder of Company Stock
should the Mergers, taken together, fail to qualify as a "reorganization"
within the meaning of Section 368(a) of the Code.

  



  

Section 8.11.   _Treatment of Existing Indebtedness_. (a) Prior to the
Closing Date, the Company shall, as reasonably requested by Parent, (i)
deliver (or cause to be delivered) notices of the payoff, prepayment,
discharge and termination of any outstanding indebtedness or obligations of
the Company and each applicable Subsidiary of the Company under the Company
Credit Agreement and any other indebtedness for borrowed money of the Company
and any of its Subsidiaries (other than the Company Notes) (the
amounts outstanding under the Company Credit Agreement and under all other
indebtedness for borrowed money of the Company and its Subsidiaries (other
than the Company Notes), the "Company Indebtedness Payoff Amount"), (ii) take
all other actions within its control and reasonably required to facilitate
the repayment of the Company Indebtedness Payoff Amount, including the
termination of the commitments under the Company Credit Agreement
substantially concurrently with the Effective Time, subject to
Parent's compliance with its obligations under the following sentence, and
(iii) obtain customary payoff or termination letters or other similar
evidence with respect to the Company Credit Agreement and any other
indebtedness for borrowed money of the Company and any of its Subsidiaries
(other than the Company Notes), in each case, in a form reasonably acceptable
to Parent at least two (2) Business Days prior to the Closing Date (which
payoff letters shall be subject to customary conditions). Parent shall (x)
irrevocably pay off, or cause to be paid off, at or prior to the Effective
Time, the Company Indebtedness Payoff Amount (if any) and (y) take all
actions within its control to provide all customary cooperation as may be
reasonably requested by the Company to assist the Company in connection with
its obligations under this Section 8.11(a).

  



  

(b) The Company shall timely provide or cause to be provided, in
accordance with the provisions of the indenture, dated October 2, 2007, as
supplemented by the supplemental indentures relating thereto (the "Indenture")
relating to the Company Notes, to the trustee under the Indenture, any
notices, announcements, certificates, legal opinions or other documents and
instruments required pursuant to the Indenture to be provided in connection
with the Transactions prior to the Effective Time. Parent and its counsel
shall be given a reasonable opportunity to review and comment on any notice,
announcement, certificate, legal opinion or other document and instrument
referred to in this Section 8.11(b), in each case, before such document
or instrument is provided to the trustee under the Indenture, and such
documents and instruments shall be reasonably acceptable to Parent. The
Company shall not redeem the Company Notes without the prior written consent
of Parent.

  



    

107

 

    

Section 8.12.   _Determination of Base Date Revenue Run-Rate_. Within ten
(10) Business Days after the date of this Agreement, the Company will deliver
to Parent a written certificate in the form set forth under Section 8.12 of
the Company Disclosure Schedule, setting forth, as of the Base Date, (i) the
name of each Client (or account number in the case of natural person Clients),
(ii) whether such Client is a (A) Public Fund, (B) Private Fund, (C) Non-U.S.
Retail Fund or (D) not a Fund, (iii) the amount of Base Date Revenue Run-Rate
for each such Client, and (iv) the aggregate amount of Base Date Assets Under
Management and the aggregate amount of Base Date Revenue Run-Rate, in each
case for all Clients (the "Base Date Certificate"), in each case calculated
based upon the methodology used to calculate the estimates of Base Date Assets
Under Management and Base Date Revenue Run Rate set forth on Section 4.16(d)
of the Company Disclosure Schedule, together with reasonably detailed
supporting documentation therefor; _provided_ that with respect to the Non-
SMA Base RRR, the Base Date Certificate shall set forth, and utilize
for calculating Base Revenue Run-Rate, the same aggregate amount of Base Date
Assets Under Management as set forth on Section 4.16(d) of the Company
Disclosure Schedule. During the ten (10) Business Days immediately following
Parent's receipt of the Base Date Certificate, Parent and its Representatives
will be permitted to review the applicable books and records relating to the
preparation of the Base Date Certificate, and the Company will make reasonably
available the individuals responsible for the preparation of the Base Date
Certificate in order to respond to the reasonable inquiries related thereto.
Parent may notify the Company in writing (a "Disagreement Notice") within ten
(10) Business Days after receiving the Base Date Certificate if Parent
disagrees with any of the calculations of any item in the Base Date
Certificate, which Disagreement Notice shall set forth in reasonable detail
the basis for such dispute and Parent's calculations of such items (the
"Disputed Items"). During the five (5) Business Days immediately following
the delivery of a Disagreement Notice, Parent and the Company will seek in
good faith to resolve all Disputed Items. If at the end of such five (5)
Business Days period, Parent and the Company have been unable to resolve all
Disputed Items, then Parent and the Company will submit to KPMG US LLP (the
"Independent Expert") for review and resolution any and all Disputed Items
that remain in dispute. Parent and the Company will cause the Independent
Expert to make a final determination on such Disputed Items as well as any
related modifications to the Base Date Certificate within ten (10) Business
Days from such submission. The Independent Expert shall be authorized to
resolve only those Disputed Items remaining in dispute between the parties,
strictly pursuant to the principles set forth in this Agreement, within the
range of the difference between Parent's position with respect thereto and the
Company's position with respect thereto. The Independent Expert shall make a
written determination as to each such Disputed Item, which determination shall
be final and binding on the parties for all purposes hereunder absent
manifest error or fraud. The costs, fees and expenses of the Independent
Expert shall be borne equally by Parent, on the one hand, and the Company, on
the other hand.

(ii) there shall be in effect any Applicable Law that permanently enjoins,
prevents or prohibits the consummation of the Mergers and, if such Applicable
Law is an Order, such Order shall have become final and non-appealable;

(c) by Parent, if:

  



  

(i) a Company Adverse Recommendation Change shall have occurred; _provided_

covenant or agreement on the part of the Company set forth in this Agreement
shall have occurred that would cause any condition set forth in Section
9.02(a) or Section 9.02(c) not

  



    

112

 

    

to be satisfied, and such breach or failure to perform (A) is incapable of
being cured by the End Date or (B) has not been cured by the Company within
forty-five (45) days following written notice to the Company from Parent of
such breach or failure to perform, but Parent may terminate this Agreement
under this Section 10.01(c)(iii) only so long as Parent is not then in breach
of any of its representations, warranties, covenants or agreements set forth

in Section 9.03(a) or Section 9.03(c) not to be satisfied; or

  



  

(iv) the Company shall have willfully breached any of its obligations
under Section 6.03 or Section 6.04 in any material respect other than in the

immediately available funds the Company Termination Fee pursuant to
Section 10.03; or

  



  

(ii) any Governmental Authority that must provide a Consent to satisfy one
or more of the conditions set forth in Section 9.03(b) has denied such
Consent and such denial has become final and non-appealable; _provided_ that

(iii) a breach of any representation or warranty or failure to perform any
covenant or agreement on the part of Parent, Merger Sub 1 or Merger Sub 2 set
forth in this Agreement shall have occurred that would cause any condition set
forth in Section 9.03(a) or Section 9.03(c) not to be satisfied, and such
breach or failure to perform (A) is incapable of being cured by the End
Date or (B) has not been cured by Parent, Merger Sub 1 or Merger Sub 2, as
applicable, within forty-five (45) days following written notice to Parent

terminate this Agreement under this Section 10.01(d)(iii) only so long as the
Company is not then in breach of any of its representations, warranties,
covenants or agreements set forth in this Agreement, which breach by the
Company would cause any condition set forth in Section 9.02(a) or Section
9.02(c) not to be satisfied.

  



  

The party desiring to terminate this Agreement pursuant to this Section 10.01
(other than pursuant to Section 10.01(a)) shall give written notice of such

113

 

    

Section 10.02.   _Effect of Termination_. If this Agreement is terminated
pursuant to Section 10.01, this Agreement shall become void and of no effect
without liability of any party (or any stockholder or Representative of such
party) to the other parties hereto, except as provided in Section 10.03;
_provided_ that neither Parent nor the Company shall be released from
any liabilities or damages arising out of any (i) fraud by such party (ii)
the willful breach by such party of any representation or warranty on the
part of such party set forth in this Agreement or (iii) the willful breach by
such party of any covenant or agreement binding on such party set forth in
this Agreement (clauses (i)-(iii) collectively, "Willful Breach"). The
provisions of this Section 10.02, Section 10.03 and Article 11 (other than
Section 11.13) shall survive any termination hereof pursuant to Section
10.01. In addition, the termination of this Agreement shall not affect the
parties' respective obligations under the Company Confidentiality Agreement
and Parent Confidentiality Agreement.

(i) by Parent pursuant to Section 10.01(c)(i) or Section 10.01(c)(iv) or by
the Company or Parent pursuant to any other provision of Section 10.01 at a
time when this Agreement was terminable by Parent pursuant to Section
10.01(c)(i) or Section 10.01(c)(iv); or

  



  

(ii) by the Company or Parent pursuant to Section 10.01(b)(i) (without the
Company Stockholder Approval having been obtained), by the Company or Parent
pursuant to Section 10.01(b)(iii) or by Parent pursuant to Section
10.01(c)(iii) (without the Company Stockholder Approval having been obtained
or, if such termination is after the Company Stockholder Approval has been
obtained, as a result of a willful breach by the Company) and: (A) at or
prior to the time of termination of this Agreement, a Company
Acquisition Proposal shall have been publicly disclosed or announced (in each
case, and not publicly withdrawn) or made known to the management or board of
directors of the Company (in each case, and not publicly withdrawn), or any
Person shall have publicly announced (in each case, and not publicly
withdrawn) an intention (whether or not conditional) to make a Company
Acquisition Proposal; and (B) on or prior to the first (1st) anniversary of
such termination of this Agreement: (1) a transaction relating to a Company
Acquisition Proposal is consummated; or (2) a definitive agreement relating
to any Company Acquisition Proposal is entered into by the Company; or

  



  

(iii) by the Company pursuant to Section 10.01(d)(i);

  



  

then, in each case, the Company shall pay to Parent (or a Person designated
by Parent), in cash at the time specified in the following sentence, a fee in
the amount of $206,000,000 (the "Company Termination Fee"). The Company
Termination Fee shall be payable as follows: (i) in the case of Section
10.03(a)(i), in the event the Company Termination Fee is payable in connection
with a termination of this Agreement (A) by Parent, within five (5) Business
Days of such termination, and (B) by the Company, substantially
concurrently with, and as a condition to, such termination, (ii) in the event
the Company Termination Fee is payable under Section
10.03(a)(iii), substantially concurrently with, and as a condition to, such
termination and (iii) in the event the Company Termination Fee is payable
under Section 10.03(a)(ii), substantially concurrently with, and as a
condition to, the earlier of the consummation of the applicable

  



    

114

 

    

transaction and the entry into a definitive agreement with respect to the
applicable transaction. For purposes of Section 10.03(a)(ii)(B),
"Company Acquisition Proposal" shall have the meaning assigned thereto in
Section 1.01, except that references in the definition to "15%" shall be
replaced by "50%."

  



  

(b) Any payment of the Company Termination Fee shall be made by wire
transfer of immediately available funds to an account designated in writing
by Parent.

  



  

(c) The parties agree and understand that (x) in no event shall the
Company be required to pay the Company Termination Fee on more than one
occasion and (y) in no event shall Parent be entitled, pursuant to this
_Section 10.03_ , to receive an amount greater than an amount equal to (A)
the Company Termination Fee _plus_ (B) any Collection Expenses.
Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement, except in the
case of Willful Breach, (i) in circumstances where the Company Termination
Fee is payable or is paid pursuant to this _Section 10.03_ , such payment
shall be the sole and exclusive remedy for damages of Parent or its
Subsidiaries and their respective former, current or further partners,
stockholders, managers, members, Affiliates and Representatives, as
applicable, and none of the Company, any of its Subsidiaries or any of their
respective former, current or future partners, stockholders, managers,
members, Affiliates or Representatives, as applicable, shall have any further
liability or obligation relating to or arising out of this Agreement or the
Transactions and (ii) if Parent, Merger Sub 1 or Merger Sub 2 receives any
payments from the Company in respect of any breach of this Agreement and
thereafter Parent receives the Company Termination Fee pursuant to this
_Section 10.03_ , the amount of such Company Termination Fee shall be reduced
by the aggregate amount of such payments made by the Company prior to paying
the Company Termination Fee in respect of any such breaches. The
parties acknowledge that the agreements contained in this _Section 10.03_ are
an integral part of the Transactions, that, without these agreements, the
parties would not enter into this Agreement and that any amounts payable
pursuant to this _Section 10.03 _ do not constitute a penalty. Accordingly,
if any party fails to promptly pay any amount due pursuant to this _Section
10.03_ , such party shall also pay any reasonable and documented costs and
expenses (including reasonable legal fees and expenses) incurred by the party
entitled to such payment in connection with a legal action to enforce this
Agreement that results in a judgment for such amount against the party
failing to promptly pay such amount. Any amount not paid when due pursuant to
this _Section 10.03 _ shall bear interest from the date such amount is due
until the date paid at a rate equal to the prime rate as published in  _The
Wall Street Journal, Eastern Edition_ in effect on the date of such payment
(such interest, together with reasonable and documented costs and expenses of
enforcement as provided in the immediately preceding sentence, "Collection
Expenses").

applicable, a disclosure for purposes of), the corresponding section or
subsection of this Agreement, irrespective of whether or not any particular
section or subsection of this Agreement specifically refers to the Company
Disclosure Schedule or the Parent Disclosure Schedule, as applicable. The
parties hereto further agree that (other than with respect to any
items disclosed in Section 4.20(a) of the Company Disclosure Schedule, for
which an explicit reference in any other section shall be required in order
to apply to such other section) disclosure

  



    

117

 

    

of any item, matter or event in any particular section or subsection of
either the Company Disclosure Schedule or the Parent Disclosure Schedule
shall be deemed disclosure with respect to any other section or subsection of
the Company Disclosure Schedule or the Parent Disclosure Schedule, as
applicable, to which the relevance of such disclosure would be reasonably
apparent on its face to a reasonable person without any independent knowledge
regarding the matter(s) so disclosed, notwithstanding the omission of a
cross-reference to such other section or subsections.

  



  

(b) The parties hereto agree that in no event shall any disclosure (other
than statements of historical fact) contained in any part of any Company SEC
Document or Parent SEC Document entitled "Risk Factors," "Forward-Looking
Statements," "Cautionary Statement Regarding Forward-Looking Statements,"
"Special Note on Forward Looking Statements" or "Forward Looking Information"
or containing a description or explanation of "Forward-Looking Statements" or
any other disclosures in any Company SEC Document or Parent SEC Document that
are cautionary, predictive or forward-looking in nature be deemed to be an
exception to (or a disclosure for purposes of) any representations and
warranties of any party contained in this Agreement.

  



  

Section 11.06.   _Binding Effect; Benefit; Assignment_.

  



  

(a) The provisions of this Agreement shall be binding upon and shall inure
solely to the benefit of the parties hereto, except for: (i) only following
the Effective Time, the right of (x) the Company's stockholders to receive the
applicable Merger Consideration in respect of their shares of Company Stock
pursuant to Section 2.04 and to receive the Special Dividend in respect of
their shares of Company Stock pursuant to Section 6.07, and (y) the holders of
Company Equity Awards to receive the applicable consideration in respect of
their Company Equity Awards pursuant to Section 2.07, (ii) the right of the
Company Indemnified Parties to enforce the provisions of Section 7.03 and
(iii) the right of the holders of Registrable Securities to enforce the
provisions of Section 7.06. Except as provided in Section 7.03 and in this
Section 11.06, no provision of this Agreement is intended to confer any
rights, benefits, remedies, obligations or liabilities hereunder upon any
Person other than the parties hereto and their respective successors and
assigns.

  



  

(b) No party may assign, delegate or otherwise transfer (by operation of
law or otherwise) any of its rights or obligations under this Agreement
without the prior written consent of each other party hereto, except that
Parent may transfer or assign its rights and obligations under this
Agreement, in whole or from time to time in part, to any Person after the
Closing; _provided _ that such transfer or assignment shall not relieve
Parent, Merger Sub 1 or Merger Sub 2 of its obligations hereunder or
enlarge, alter or change any obligation of any other party hereto or due to
Parent, Merger Sub 1 or Merger Sub 2. Any assignment in contravention of the
preceding sentence shall be null and void _ab initio_.

  



  

Section 11.07.   _Governing Law_. This Agreement and all actions (whether in
contract or tort between or among the parties hereto) based on, arising out
of or relating to the negotiation, execution or performance of this Agreement
or the Transactions shall be governed by and construed in accordance with the
laws of the State of Delaware, regardless of the Applicable Law that
might otherwise govern under applicable principles of conflicts of law rules

  



    

118

 

    

thereof (other than with respect to matters that are required to be governed
by the MGCL or the LLC Act).

  



  

Section 11.08.   _Jurisdiction/Venue_. Each of the parties hereto agrees that
any suit, action or proceeding between or among the parties hereto seeking to
enforce any provision of, or based on any matter arising out of or in
connection with, this Agreement or the Transactions (whether brought by any
party or any of its Affiliates or against any party or any of its Affiliates)
shall be brought, tried and determined only in the Delaware Court of Chancery
and any state appellate court therefrom within the State of Delaware (or,
only if the Delaware Court of Chancery declines to accept jurisdiction over a
particular matter, any federal court within the State of Delaware). Each of
the parties hereto (i) irrevocably consents to the service of the summons and
complaint and any other process in any suit, action or proceeding relating to
the Transactions, on behalf of itself or its property, in accordance with
Section 11.01 or in such other manner as may be permitted by Applicable Law,
and agrees that nothing in this Section 11.08 shall affect the right of any
party to serve legal process in any other manner permitted by Applicable Law,
(ii) irrevocably and unconditionally consents and submits itself and its
property in any suit, action or proceeding to the exclusive general
jurisdiction of the Delaware Court of Chancery and any state appellate court
therefrom within the State of Delaware (or, only if the Delaware Court of
Chancery declines to accept jurisdiction over a particular matter, any federal
court within the State of Delaware) in any suit, action or proceeding seeking
to enforce any provision of, or based on any matter arising out of or in
connection with, this Agreement or the Transactions or for recognition and
enforcement of any judgment in respect thereof, (iii) agrees that it shall
not attempt to deny or defeat such personal jurisdiction by motion or other
request for leave from any such court, (iv) waives any objection that it may
now or hereafter have to the venue of any such suit, action or proceeding in
any such court or that such suit, action or proceeding was brought in an
inconvenient court and agrees not to plead or claim the same and (v)
agrees that it shall not bring any action relating to this Agreement or the
Transactions in any court other than the aforesaid courts. Each of Parent,
Merger Sub 1, Merger Sub 2 and the Company agrees that a final judgment in any
suit, action or proceeding in such court as provided above shall be
conclusive and may be enforced in other jurisdictions by suit on the judgment
or in any other manner provided by Applicable Law.

  



  

Section 11.09.   _WAIVER OF JURY TRIAL_. EACH PARTY ACKNOWLEDGES AND AGREES
THAT ANY CONTROVERSY WHICH MAY ARISE UNDER THIS AGREEMENT IS LIKELY TO
INVOLVE COMPLICATED AND DIFFICULT ISSUES, AND THEREFORE EACH SUCH PARTY HEREBY
IRREVOCABLY AND UNCONDITIONALLY WAIVES ANY RIGHT SUCH PARTY MAY HAVE TO A
TRIAL BY JURY IN RESPECT OF ANY LITIGATION DIRECTLY OR INDIRECTLY ARISING OUT
OF OR RELATING TO THIS AGREEMENT, THE MERGERS OR THE OTHER TRANSACTIONS. EACH
PARTY CERTIFIES AND ACKNOWLEDGES THAT (i) NO REPRESENTATIVE, AGENT OR
ATTORNEY OF ANY OTHER PARTY HAS REPRESENTED, EXPRESSLY OR OTHERWISE, THAT SUCH
OTHER PARTY WOULD NOT, IN THE EVENT OF LITIGATION, SEEK TO ENFORCE THE
FOREGOING WAIVER, (ii) EACH PARTY UNDERSTANDS AND HAS CONSIDERED THE
IMPLICATIONS OF THIS WAIVER, (iii) EACH PARTY MAKES THIS WAIVER VOLUNTARILY
AND (iv) EACH PARTY HAS BEEN INDUCED TO ENTER INTO THIS AGREEMENT BY, AMONG

  



    

119

 

    

OTHER THINGS, THE MUTUAL WAIVERS AND CERTIFICATIONS IN THIS SECTION 11.09.

  



  

Section 11.10.   _Counterparts; Effectiveness_. This Agreement may be signed
in any number of counterparts, including by e-mail with .pdf attachments,
each of which shall be an original, with the same effect as if the signatures
thereto and hereto were upon the same instrument. This Agreement shall become
effective when each party hereto shall have received a counterpart hereof
signed and delivered (by e-mail or otherwise) by all of the other parties
hereto. Until and unless each party has received a counterpart hereof signed
by the other party hereto, this Agreement shall have no effect and no party
shall have any right or obligation hereunder (whether by virtue of any other
oral or written agreement or other communication).

  



  

Section 11.11.   _Entire Agreement_. This Agreement (including, for the
avoidance of doubt, the Company Disclosure Schedule and the Parent Disclosure
Schedule), the Company Confidentiality Agreement, the Parent Confidentiality
Agreement and the Written Consent constitute the entire agreement between the
parties with respect to the subject matter of this Agreement and supersedes
all prior agreements and understandings, both oral and written, between the
parties with respect to the subject matter hereof.

  



  

Section 11.12.   _Severability_. If any term, provision, covenant or
restriction of this Agreement is held by a court of competent jurisdiction or
other Governmental Authority to be invalid, void or unenforceable, the
remainder of the terms, provisions, covenants and restrictions of this
Agreement shall remain in full force and effect and shall in no way be
affected, impaired or invalidated so long as the economic or legal substance
of the Transactions is not affected in any manner materially adverse to any
party. Upon such a determination, the parties shall negotiate in good faith
to modify this Agreement so as to effect the original intent of the parties
as closely as possible in an acceptable manner in order that the Transactions
be consummated as originally contemplated to the fullest extent possible.

  



  

Section 11.13.   _Specific Performance_. The parties acknowledge and agree
that irreparable harm would occur and that the parties would not have any
adequate remedy at law (even if monetary damages were available) (i) for any
breach of the provisions of this Agreement or (ii) in the event that any of
the provisions of this Agreement were not performed in accordance with their
specific terms. It is accordingly agreed that, except where this Agreement is
terminated in accordance with Section 10.01, the parties shall be entitled to
an injunction or injunctions to prevent breaches of this Agreement and to
specifically enforce the terms and provisions of this Agreement in the courts
referred to in Section 11.08, without proof of actual damages, and each party
further agrees to waive any requirement for the securing or posting of any
bond in connection with such remedy. The parties further agree that (x) by
seeking the remedies provided for in this Section 11.13, a party shall not in
any respect waive its right to seek any other form of relief that may be
available to a party under this Agreement, including, subject to Section
10.03(c), monetary damages and (y) nothing contained in this Section 11.13
shall require any party to institute any proceeding for (or limit any party's
right to institute any proceeding for) specific performance under this Section
11.13 before exercising any termination right under Section 10.01 or pursuing
damages nor shall the commencement of any action pursuant to this
Section 11.13 or anything contained in this Section 11.13 restrict or limit
any party's right to terminate this Agreement in accordance with the terms of
Section 10.01 or pursue

  



    

120

 

    

any other remedies under this Agreement that may be available then or
thereafter. The parties further agree not to assert that a remedy of specific
enforcement is unenforceable, invalid, contrary to Applicable Law or
inequitable for any reason, and not to assert that a remedy of monetary
damages would provide an adequate remedy for any such breach or that the
parties otherwise have an adequate remedy at law.

  



  

Section 11.14.   _Confidential Supervisory Information_. Notwithstanding any
other provision of this Agreement to the contrary, no disclosure,
representation or warranty shall be made (or other action taken) pursuant to
this Agreement that results in the disclosure of confidential supervisory
information (including confidential supervisory information as defined in 12
C.F.R. § 261.2(c) and as identified in 12 C.F.R. § 4.12(b)(8)) of a
Governmental Authority by any party to this Agreement to the extent
prohibited by Applicable Law. To the extent legally permissible, appropriate
substitute disclosures or actions, which may include the disclosure of
underlying facts or circumstances that do not themselves constitute
confidential supervisory information, shall be made or taken under
circumstances in which the limitations of the preceding sentence apply.
