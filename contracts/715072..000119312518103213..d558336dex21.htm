of Merger. The Bank Merger shall become effective as set forth in the
Certificate of Approval issued by the Georgia Department of Banking and
Finance (the " _GDBF_ ") and the Certificate of Merger Approval issued by the
Mississippi Commissioner of Banking and Consumer Finance (the " _MCB_ ") based
on articles of merger filed with each of the GDBF and the MCB and thereafter

documents and certificates as are necessary to effectuate the Bank Merger, the
" _Bank Merger Certificates_ ").

 

1.3 _Effects of the Merger_. At and after the Effective Time, the Merger shall

1.4 _Conversion of Seller Common Stock_. Subject to the provisions of this
Agreement, at the Effective Time, by virtue of the Merger and without any
action on the part of Seller, Buyer or the holder of any of the following
securities:

(a) Subject to  _Section_ _s 2.2_ and _2.3(e)_ , each share of the common
stock, no par value per share, of Seller (the " _Seller Common Stock_ ")
issued and outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time, except for
shares to be canceled pursuant to _Section_ __ _ 1.4(c)_ below and
Dissenting Shares, shall be converted automatically into the right to receive
the following consideration, in each case without interest:

 

(i) cash in the amount of $77.50 less any applicable withholding Taxes
(individually, the " _Per Share Cash Consideration_ " and collectively in the
aggregate, the " _Cash Consideration_ "); and

(ii) 32.87 shares (or fraction thereof) (the " _Exchange Ratio_ ") of validly
issued, fully paid and nonassessable shares of the common stock, $5.00 par
value per share, of Buyer (the " _Buyer Common Stock_ "), rounded to
the nearest four decimals (the " _Stock Consideration_ ," and together with
the Cash Consideration, the " _Merger Consideration_ ").

 



2 (b) All of the shares of Seller Common Stock converted into the right to
receive the Merger Consideration pursuant to this _Article I_ shall no longer
be outstanding and shall automatically be cancelled and shall cease to exist
as of the Effective Time, and each certificate previously representing any
such shares of Seller Common Stock (each, a " _Certificate_ ") registered to
a holder of Seller Common Stock shall thereafter represent only the right to
receive, in consideration therefor upon the surrender of such Certificates in
accordance with  _Section_ __ _ 2.3_, the Merger Consideration in the
combination of cash and whole shares of Buyer Common Stock, together with any
cash in lieu of fractional shares pursuant to _Section_ __ _ 2.3(e)_, into
which the shares of Seller Common Stock represented by such Certificate have
been converted pursuant to this _Section_ __ _ 1.4_ and _Section_ __ _
2.3(e)_ and any dividends or distributions with respect thereto which the
holder has the right to receive pursuant to _Section_ __ _ 2.3(b)_.
Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the contrary, if, between the
date of this Agreement and the Effective Time, the outstanding shares of
Buyer Common Stock or Seller Common Stock shall have been increased,
decreased, or changed into or exchanged for a different number or kind of
shares or securities as a result of a reorganization, recapitalization,
reclassification, stock dividend, stock split, reverse stock split, or other
similar change in capitalization with a record date during such period, an
equitable and proportionate adjustment, if necessary and without duplication,
shall be made to the Exchange Ratio per share and Merger Consideration
payable pursuant to this Agreement and any amounts payable to the holders of
Seller Equity Awards pursuant to this Agreement.

 

(c) At the Effective Time, all shares of Seller Capital Stock that are owned
by Seller or Buyer or any Subsidiary of Buyer or Seller (other than shares of
Seller Common Stock held (i) in trust accounts, managed accounts, mutual funds
and the like, or otherwise held in a fiduciary or agency capacity, that are
beneficially owned by third parties or (ii) as a result of debts previously
contracted) shall be cancelled and shall cease to exist, and neither the
Merger Consideration nor any other consideration shall be delivered in
exchange therefor.

 

1.5 _Buyer_ _Capital Stock_. At and after the Effective Time, each share of
Buyer Capital Stock issued and outstanding immediately prior to the Effective
Time shall remain issued and outstanding and shall not be affected by the
Merger.

1.6  _Treatment of Seller Equity Awards_ _._

(a) At the Effective Time, by virtue of the Merger and without any action on
the part of the holders thereof, each outstanding option to acquire shares of
Seller Common Stock (a " _Seller Stock Option_ ") issued pursuant to Sellers
equity-based compensation plans identified in  _Section_ __ _ 4.12(a)_ of
the Seller Disclosure Schedule (the " _Seller Stock Plans_ ") or otherwise
that is outstanding and has not been exercised as of immediately prior to the
Effective Time, whether vested or unvested, shall become fully vested and
shall be cancelled and converted automatically into the right to receive, in
full satisfaction of any rights in respect of the Seller Stock Option, a cash
payment (the " _Cash Out Amount_ ") from Buyer or Buyer Bank in an amount
equal to the product of (x) the excess, if any, of $1,550 (subject to
adjustment as provided in _Section_ __ _ 2.2(a)_) over the exercise price of
each such Seller Stock Option and (y) the number of shares of Seller Common
Stock subject to such option (with the aggregate Cash Out Amount payable to
the holder of such option rounded to the nearest cent), less applicable
withholding Taxes; _provided, however_ , that any such Seller Stock Option
marked with an * on _Section_ __ _ 1.6(a)_ of the Seller Disclosure Schedule
that vests upon a "Change of Control" under and as defined in Section 4(a)
thereof, regardless of the exercise price of such Seller Stock Option, shall
not vest and shall instead be treated as a Seller Stock Option to purchase
two-thirds the number of the shares of Seller Common Stock subject to such
option and with an exercise price equal to or greater than the Cash Out Amount
as described below. After the Effective Time, any Seller Stock Option to be
cancelled and paid out as described above shall no longer be exercisable, but
shall only entitle the holder to the payment of the Cash Out Amount, less
applicable withholding Taxes, without interest. In the event the exercise
price per share of Seller Common Stock subject to a Seller Stock Option is
equal to or greater than $1,550 (as adjusted, if at all, pursuant to
_Section_ __ _ 2.2(a)_), such Seller Stock Option shall no longer be
exercisable, shall be cancelled without payment of any consideration therefor
and shall have no further force or effect on and after the Effective Time.

 



3 (b) At the Effective Time, each outstanding award of shares of Seller Common
Stock subject to vesting, forfeiture, repurchase or other lapse restriction
(a " _Seller Restricted Share Award_ " and any such award, together with each
Seller Stock Option, a " _Seller Equity Award_ ") granted under the Seller
Stock Plans or otherwise, whether vested or unvested, that is outstanding as
of immediately prior to the Effective Time shall become fully vested and each
such outstanding share of Seller Common Stock shall be converted automatically
into and shall thereafter represent the right to receive the Merger
Consideration, less applicable withholding Taxes, without interest. At the
Effective Time, each outstanding right to receive or be distributed shares of
Seller Common Stock under the Seller Stock Plans or the Brand Group Holdings,
Inc. Deferred Compensation Plan (the " _Seller Deferred Compensation Plan_ "),
whether vested or unvested, shall vest in full and be settled or distributed
according to the terms of the plan or arrangement upon which it was granted
or distributable, and thereafter exchanged for the Merger Consideration.
Notwithstanding the foregoing, any deferrals credited to the Seller Deferred
Compensation Plan after the date hereof and related matching contributions or
other employer contributions that, in either case, are deemed invested in
Seller Common Stock shall be paid upon termination of the Seller Deferred
Compensation Plan (as provided in _Section_ __ _ 6.6(f)_, below) in cash
equal to the then fair market value of such Seller Common Stock, but otherwise
in accordance with the terms of the Seller Deferred Compensation Plan.

 

(c) At or as soon as practicable following the Effective Time (and in no event
later than fifteen (15) business days after the Effective Time), Buyer or
Buyer Bank shall deliver the Cash Out Amount to the holders of Seller Stock
Options and the Merger Consideration to the holders of Seller Restricted Share
Awards, in each case without interest, reduced by any Taxes withheld
pursuant to _Section_ __ _ 2.6_.

(d) At or prior to the Effective Time, Seller and Buyer, through their
respective board of directors or the appropriate committee thereof, shall
adopt any resolutions and take any other actions that are reasonably necessary
to effectuate the provisions of this _Section_ __ _ 1.6_.

 

1.7 _Treatment of ESPP_. In accordance with the terms of the Brand Group
Holdings, Inc. Employee Stock Purchase Plan (the " _ESPP_ "), the current
"Participation Period" under the ESPP, which begins January 1, 2018 and ends
March 31, 2018, shall terminate and all outstanding "Purchase Rights" under
the ESPP shall be exercised in accordance with its terms. Seller shall take
such actions as reasonably necessary to provide that (a) no new Participation
Period shall commence after the date hereof, (b) all outstanding "Purchase
Rights" shall be exercised, shares of Seller Common Stock delivered and the
ESPP terminated no later than the Effective Time, (c) any accumulated payroll
deductions under the ESPP shall be returned to the extent not used to exercise
Purchase Rights; and (d) no further Purchase Rights shall be granted or
exercised hereafter except as described herein.

1.8 _Articles of Surviving_ _Corporation and Surviving Bank_. At the
Effective Time, the articles of incorporation of Buyer, as in effect
immediately prior to the Effective Time (the " _Buyer_ _Articles_ "),
shall be the articles of incorporation of the Surviving Corporation until
thereafter amended in accordance with applicable law. At the effective time of
the Bank Merger, the charter of incorporation of Buyer Bank, as in effect
immediately prior to the Effective Time, shall be the charter of
incorporation of the Surviving Bank until thereafter amended in accordance
with applicable law.

 

1.9 _Bylaws_ _of Surviving_ _Corporation and Surviving Bank_. At the Effective
Time, the bylaws of Buyer, as in effect immediately prior to the Effective
Time (the " _Buyer_ _Bylaws_ "), shall be the bylaws of the Surviving
Corporation until thereafter amended in accordance with applicable law. At the
effective time of the Bank Merger, the bylaws of Buyer Bank, as in effect
immediately prior to the Effective Time, shall be the bylaws of the Surviving
Bank until thereafter amended in accordance with applicable law.

 



4 1.10 _Tax Consequences_. It is intended that the Merger and the Bank
Merger each constitute a "reorganization" within the meaning of Section
368(a) of the Code and that this Agreement shall constitute a "plan of
reorganization" for the purposes of Sections 354 and 361 of the Code. From and
after the date of this Agreement and until the Closing, each party hereto
shall use its reasonable best efforts to cause the Merger and the Bank Merger
each to qualify as a "reorganization" under Section 368(a) of the Code.

 

1.11 _Officers and Directors of Surviving_ _Corporation_ _and the Surviving
Bank_. 

(a) Prior to the Effective Time, the parties shall take all appropriate
actions so that, as of the Effective Time, and subject to and in accordance
with the Buyer Articles and Buyer Bylaws, the number of directors of the
Surviving Corporation shall be increased by one director and shall consist of
the directors of Buyer in office immediately prior to the Effective Time as
well as one current director of Seller selected by Buyer in its sole and
absolute discretion after consultation with Seller (the " _Seller Designee_
"), until the next annual meeting of the Surviving Corporations shareholders
and until their respective successors are duly elected, appointed or
qualified or until their earlier death, resignation or removal in accordance
with the articles of incorporation and bylaws of the Surviving Corporation.
The Surviving Corporations board of directors shall consider in good faith
the nomination for reelection of the Seller Designee at each subsequent annual
meeting of the Surviving Corporations shareholders through the 2021 annual
meeting (and may consider the nomination of the Seller Designee after the
2021 annual meeting). The officers of Buyer shall, from and after the
Effective Time, continue as the officers of the Surviving Corporation until
their successors shall have been duly elected, appointed or qualified or
until their earlier death, resignation or removal in accordance with the
articles of incorporation and bylaws of the Surviving Corporation.

 

(b) Prior to the effective time of the Bank Merger, the parties shall take all
appropriate actions so that, as of the effective time of the Bank Merger, and
subject to and in accordance with the charter of incorporation and bylaws of
Buyer Bank, the number of directors of the Surviving Bank shall be increased
by two directors and shall consist of the directors of Buyer Bank in
office immediately prior to the effective time of the Bank Merger as well as
Bartow Morgan, Jr. and one current director of Seller Bank selected by Buyer
Bank in its sole and absolute discretion after consultation with Seller Bank
(the " _Seller Bank Designees_ "), until the next annual meeting of the
Surviving Banks sole shareholder and until their respective successors are
duly elected, appointed or qualified or until their earlier death, resignation
or removal in accordance with the charter of incorporation and bylaws of the
Surviving Bank. Provided that, as to each Seller Bank Designee, he or she
remains qualified to serve as a director under applicable banking laws,
regulations and guidance, the Surviving Corporation shall reelect each of the
Seller Bank Designees at each subsequent annual meeting of the Surviving
Banks sole shareholder through the 2021 annual meeting (and may consider the
reelection of each of the Seller Bank Designees after the 2021 annual
meeting). The officers of Buyer Bank shall, from and after the effective time
of the Bank Merger, continue as the officers of the Surviving Bank until their
successors shall have been duly elected, appointed or qualified or
until their earlier death, resignation or removal in accordance with the
charter of incorporation and bylaws of the Surviving Bank.

ARTICLE II.

DELIVERY OF MERGER CONSIDERATION

 

2.1 _Deposit of Merger Consideration_. At or prior to the Closing, Buyer shall
deposit, or shall cause to be deposited, with Computershare Inc. (the "
_Exchange Agent_ "), for the benefit of the holders of Certificates, for
exchange in accordance with this _Article II_ , (i) certificates (or at
Buyers option, evidence of shares in book entry form) representing the
shares of Buyer Common Stock equal to the aggregate Stock Consideration and
(ii) immediately available funds equal to the aggregate Cash Consideration,
together with cash in lieu of any fractional shares with respect to the
Merger Consideration (such aggregate cash and

 



5  certificates for shares of Buyer Common Stock (or at Buyers option,
evidence of shares in book entry form), together with any dividends or
distributions with respect thereto, being hereinafter referred to as the "
_Exchange Fund_ "), to be issued pursuant to _Section_ __ _ 1.4_ and paid
pursuant to _Section_ __ _ 1.4_ and _Section_ __ _ 2.3(e)_ in exchange for
shares of Seller Common Stock outstanding as of immediately prior to the
Effective Time. The Exchange Agent shall not be entitled to vote or exercise
any other rights of ownership with respect to the shares of Buyer Common Stock
held by it from time to time hereunder, except that it shall receive and hold
all dividends and other distributions payable or distributable with respect to
such shares for the account of the persons entitled thereto.

 

2.2 _Potential Adjustment to the_ _Merger Consideration and the Cash Out
Amount_.

 

(a) If, (i) at any time after the date hereof and before the later of June 15,
2018 and the thirtieth (30th) day prior to the Effective Time (the " _Special
Asset Resolution Date_ "), Seller (or one of its Subsidiaries, as applicable)
has sold any asset set forth on  _Section_ __ _ 2.2_ of the Seller
Disclosure Schedule (each, a " _Special Asset_ " and, collectively, the "
_Special Assets_ ") (which Special Assets may be sold by Seller (or one of
its Subsidiaries, as applicable) without the prior consent of Buyer so long
as such sale is considered a "true sale" pursuant to GAAP) (1) for
consideration less than the book value of such Special Asset as of the date of
this Agreement (the " _Special Asset Value_ ") as set forth on _Section_ __ _
2.2_ of the Seller Disclosure Schedule (the " _Special Asset Losses_ "), or
(2) for consideration greater than the Special Asset Value of such Special
Asset (the " _Special Asset Gains_ "), or (ii) at the Effective Time, any
Special Asset remains as an asset of Seller (or one of its Subsidiaries, as
applicable) (a " _Continuing Special Asset_ " and, collectively, the "
_Continuing Special Assets_ "), then, notwithstanding anything in this
Agreement to the contrary, (1) the Exchange Ratio shall be adjusted to equal
the quotient of (y) the quotient of (A) (a) the product of (1) the Exchange
Ratio as set forth in _Section_ __ _ 1.4(a)(ii)_ multiplied by (2) $44.93,
multiplied by (3) 297,506.6 (the " _Common Shares Outstanding_ "), plus (b)
89.9% of the aggregate Special Asset Gains, less (c) 89.9% of the aggregate
Special Asset Losses, less (d) 89.9% of the aggregate Special Asset Value of
any Continuing Special Assets, divided by (B) the Common Shares Outstanding,
divided by (z) $44.93, (2) the Per Share Cash Consideration shall be adjusted
to equal the quotient of (A) (a) the product of (1) the Per Share Cash
Consideration as set forth in _Section_ __ _ 1.4(a)(i)_ multiplied by (2)
the Common Shares Outstanding, plus (b) 5.1% of the aggregate Special Asset
Gains, less (c) 5.1% of the aggregate Special Asset Losses, less (d) 5.1% of
the aggregate Special Asset Value of any Continuing Special Assets, divided by
(B) the Common Shares Outstanding and (3) the Cash Out Amount shall be
adjusted by adjusting the reference to $1,550 in subpart (x) of the formula
for calculating the Cash Out Amount to an amount equal to the quotient of (A)
(a) the product of (1) $1,550 multiplied by (2) 27,562 (the " _Options
Outstanding_ "), plus (b) 5.0% of the aggregate Special Asset Gains, less (c)
5.0% of the aggregate Special Asset Losses, less (d) 5.0% of the aggregate
Special Asset Value of any Continuing Special Assets, divided by (B) the
Options Outstanding, _provided, however,_ that, notwithstanding the results of
the calculations described in subpart (1), (2) and (3) of this sentence, in no
event shall the Exchange Ratio be increased from the Exchange Ratio as set
forth in _Section_ __ _ 1.4(a)(ii)_, the Per Share Cash Consideration be
increased from the Per Share Cash Consideration set forth in _Section_ __ _
1.4(a)(i)_ or the Cash Out Amount be increased from the Cash Out Amount set
forth in _Section_ __ _ 1.6(a)_. For the avoidance of doubt, Seller shall be
permitted to sell the Special Assets after the Special Asset Resolution Date,
but any such Special Asset shall be deemed a Continuing Special Asset for
purposes hereof and, accordingly, any proceeds, gains or losses associated
with any such sales shall be excluded from the calculations contemplated by
this  _Section_ __ _ 2.2(a)_.

(b) The amount of any and all Special Asset Losses pursuant to  _Section_ __
_ 2.2(a)_ shall be determined net of any Tax Benefits reasonably realizable
by the Buyer (or one of its Subsidiaries, as applicable) with respect to such
Special Asset Losses. The term " _Tax Benefit_ " means any Tax credit, refund
of Taxes paid or other reduction, however realized, in the amount of Taxes
that otherwise would have been paid, in each case computed using an assumed
Tax rate of 21.0%.

 



6 (c) Buyer shall, on the last day of each month during the period between April
1, 2018 and the Effective Time, provide Seller and Seller Bank with its good
faith estimate of the Effective Time, and Seller and Seller Bank shall be
permitted to rely on such good faith estimate of the Effective Time for
purposes of determining the Special Asset Resolution Date.

2.3 _Delivery of Merger Consideration._

 

(a) As soon as practicable, but in no event later than five (5) business days
after the Effective Time, the Exchange Agent shall mail to the former record
holders of shares of Seller Common Stock issued and outstanding immediately
prior to the Effective Time that have been converted into the right to receive
the Merger Consideration pursuant to _Section_ __ _ 1.4_ (other than
Dissenting Shares): (i) a letter of transmittal in customary form as
reasonably agreed by the parties hereto (which shall specify that delivery
shall be effected, and risk of loss of and title shall pass, only upon
delivery of the Certificates to the Exchange Agent) and (ii) instructions for
use in effecting the surrender to the Exchange Agent of Certificates for the
Merger Consideration. Upon proper surrender of a Certificate or Certificates
to the Exchange Agent for exchange and cancellation, together with such
letter of transmittal duly executed and completed in accordance with the
instructions thereto and any other documents reasonably required by the
Exchange Agent, the holder of such Certificate or Certificates shall be
entitled to receive in exchange therefor, as applicable, (i) the Merger
Consideration that such holder of the Certificates shall have become entitled
pursuant to the provisions of _Article I_ , including cash in lieu of any
fractional shares in accordance with the provisions of _Section_ __ _
2.3(e)_; and (ii) a check representing the amount of any dividends or
distributions that such holder is entitled to receive pursuant to  _Section_
__ _ 2.3(b)_, and the Certificate or Certificates so surrendered shall
forthwith be cancelled. Promptly upon receipt of such Certificate(s), letter
of transmittal and any other required document, the Exchange Agent, on behalf
of Buyer, shall deliver the Merger Consideration (in cash and in the form of
an uncertificated book-entry share of Buyer Common Stock, unless such holder
specifically requests a certificated share) to each such holder in exchange
for each such share plus a check in the amount (if any) equal to any cash
that such holder has the right to receive pursuant to _Section_ __ _ 2.3(b)_
and, if applicable, _Section_ __ _ 2.3(e)_ hereof. No interest will be paid
or accrued on any Merger Consideration, including on any cash payable in lieu
of fractional shares, or on any unpaid dividends and distributions payable to
holders of Certificates. Holders of record of shares of Seller Common Stock
who hold such shares as nominees, trustees or in other representative
capacities may submit multiple letters of transmittal, provided that such
representative certifies that each such letter of transmittal covers all the
shares of Seller Common Stock held by such representative for a particular
beneficial owner. Each Certificate so surrendered and all transmittal
materials shall be duly completed and endorsed as the Exchange Agent may
reasonably require. The Exchange Agent shall not be obligated to deliver the
Merger Consideration to which any former holder of Seller Common Stock is
entitled as a result of the Merger until such holder surrenders his, her or
its Certificate(s) (or affidavits of loss in lieu of such Certificate(s)) for
exchange as provided in this _Section_ __ _ 2.3_. After the Effective Time,
each Certificate shall be deemed for all corporate purposes (other than the
payment of dividends and other distributions to which the former holders of
Seller Common Stock may be entitled) to evidence only the right of the holder
thereof to receive the Merger Consideration in exchange for each such share as
provided in this _Article II_.

 

(b) No dividends or other distributions declared with respect to Buyer Common
Stock shall be paid to the holder of any unsurrendered Certificate with
respect to the shares of Buyer Common Stock represented thereby until the
holder thereof shall surrender such Certificate in accordance with this
_Article II_. After the surrender of a Certificate in accordance with this 
_Article II_ , the record holder thereof shall be entitled to receive any such
dividends or other distributions, without any interest thereon, which
theretofore had become payable with respect to the whole shares of Buyer
Common Stock which the shares of Seller Common Stock represented by such
Certificate have been converted into the right to receive.

 



7 (c) If any portion of the Merger Consideration is to be issued in a name other
than that in which the Certificate or Certificates surrendered in exchange
therefor is or are registered, it shall be a condition to such issuance that
the Certificate or Certificates so surrendered shall be properly endorsed (or
accompanied by an appropriate instrument of transfer) and otherwise in proper
form for transfer, and that the person requesting such issuance shall pay to
the Exchange Agent in advance any transfer or other Taxes required by reason
of such issuance in any name other than that of the registered holder of the
Certificate or Certificates surrendered, or required for any other reason, or
shall establish to the reasonable satisfaction of the Exchange Agent that such
Tax has been paid or is not payable.

 

(d) After the Effective Time, there shall be no transfers on the stock
transfer books of Seller of the shares of Seller Common Stock that
were issued and outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time. If,
after the Effective Time, Certificates representing such shares are presented
for transfer to the Exchange Agent, they shall be cancelled and exchanged for
the Merger Consideration and any dividends or distributions that such holder
is entitled to receive pursuant to _Section_ __ _ 2.3(b)_.

(e) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained herein, no
certificates or scrip representing fractional shares of Buyer Common Stock
shall be issued upon the surrender of Certificates for exchange, no dividend
or distribution with respect to Buyer Common Stock shall be payable on or
with respect to any fractional share, and such fractional share interests
shall not entitle the owner thereof to vote or to any other rights of a
shareholder of Buyer. In lieu of the issuance of any such fractional share,
Buyer shall pay to each former shareholder of Seller who otherwise would be
entitled to receive such fractional share an amount in cash (rounded to the
nearest cent) determined by multiplying (i) the volume weighted average price
of a share of Buyer Common Stock for a twenty (20) day period, starting with
the opening of trading on the twentieth (20th) trading day prior to the
Closing Date and ending with the closing of trading on the last trading day
prior to the Closing Date, as reported by the Stock Exchange, by (ii) the
fraction of a share (rounded to the nearest thousandth when expressed in
decimal form) of Buyer Common Stock to which such holder would otherwise be
entitled to receive pursuant to  _Section_ __ _ 1.4_.

(f) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary set forth in this Agreement,
shares of Seller Common Stock issued and outstanding immediately prior to the
Effective Time and held by a holder who has properly exercised and maintained
appraisal rights in respect of such shares in accordance with Article 13 of
the GBCC and did not vote for the adoption of this Agreement (such shares
being referred to collectively as the " _Dissenting Shares_ " until such time
as such holder fails to perfect, withdraws or otherwise loses such holders
appraisal rights under applicable law with respect to such shares) shall not
be converted into a right to receive the Merger Consideration but instead
shall be entitled to payment of such consideration as may be determined to be
due in accordance with Article 13 of the GBCC; _provided_ , _however_ , that
if, after the Effective Time, such holder fails to perfect, withdraws or
otherwise loses such holders right to appraisal pursuant to Article 13 of the
GBCC, or if a court of competent jurisdiction shall determine that such
holder is not entitled to the relief provided by Article 13 of the GBCC, such
shares of Seller Common Stock shall be treated as if they had been converted
as of the Effective Time into the right to receive the Merger Consideration
in accordance with _Section_ __ _ 1._ _4_ , without interest thereon, upon
surrender of such shares of Seller Common Stock. Seller shall give prompt
notice to Buyer of any demands received by Seller for appraisal, of any
withdrawals of such demands and of any other instruments served pursuant to
the GBCC and received by Seller relating to Article 13 of the GBCC, and Buyer
shall direct all negotiations and proceedings with respect to such demands.
Prior to the Effective Time, Seller shall not, without the prior written
consent of Buyer, make any payment with respect to, or settle or compromise or
offer to settle or compromise or otherwise negotiate, any such demand, or
agree to do any of the foregoing. 

(g) Any portion of the Exchange Fund that remains unclaimed by the
shareholders of Seller as of the first anniversary of the Effective Time
shall be delivered to Buyer. Any former shareholders of Seller who have not
theretofore complied with this _Article II_ shall thereafter look only to
Buyer for payment of the Merger Consideration and any unpaid dividends and
distributions on the Buyer Common

 



8  Stock deliverable in respect of each share of Seller Common Stock such
shareholder holds as determined pursuant to this Agreement, in each case,
without any interest thereon. Notwithstanding the foregoing, none of Seller,
its Subsidiaries, Buyer, Buyer Bank, the Exchange Agent or any other person
shall be liable to any former holder of shares of Seller Common Stock for any
amount delivered in good faith to a public official pursuant to applicable
abandoned property, escheat or similar laws. Any Merger Consideration
remaining unclaimed as of a date which is immediately prior to the time when
such amounts would otherwise escheat to or become property of any Governmental
Entity shall, to the extent permitted by applicable law, become property of
Buyer free and clear of any claims or interest of any person or entity
otherwise entitled thereto.

 

(h) In the event any Certificate shall have been lost, stolen or destroyed,
upon the making of an affidavit of that fact by the person claiming such
Certificate to be lost, stolen or destroyed and, if reasonably required by
Buyer, the posting by such person of a bond in such amount as Buyer may
determine is reasonably necessary as indemnity against any claim that may be
made against it with respect to such Certificate, the Exchange Agent, or if
the Merger Consideration payable with respect to such Certificate has been
returned to Buyer pursuant to _Section_ __ _ 2.3(g)_, Buyer, will issue the
Merger Consideration and any unpaid dividends and distributions in exchange
for such lost, stolen or destroyed Certificate.

(i) The payment of any transfer, documentary, sales, use, stamp,
registration, value added and other Taxes and fees (including any penalties
and interest) incurred solely by a holder of shares of Seller Common Stock in
connection with the Merger or the other transactions contemplated by this
Agreement, and the filing of any related return, declaration, report, claim
for refund, or information return or statement relating to Taxes, including
any schedule or attachment thereto, and including any amendment thereof (each
such document, a " _Tax Return_ ") and other documentation with respect to
such Taxes and fees, shall be the sole responsibility of such holder.

 

(j) From and after the Effective Time, the holders of Certificate(s) shall
cease to have any rights with respect to the shares of Seller Common Stock
represented thereby except as provided in this Agreement or by applicable law.
All rights to receive the Merger Consideration issued upon conversion of the
shares of Seller Common Stock pursuant to this _Article II_ shall be deemed
to have been issued in full satisfaction of all rights pertaining to such
shares of Seller Common Stock.

(k) The Exchange Agent shall invest the cash balances in the Exchange Fund in
a demand deposit account or as directed by Buyer. Any interest and other
income resulting from such investment shall be the sole and exclusive property
of Buyer and shall be paid to Buyer (or the Surviving Corporation) upon
termination of the Exchange Fund pursuant to _Section_ __ _ 2.3(g)_.

2.4 _Rights as Shareholders_. All shares of Buyer Common Stock to be issued
as Merger Consideration shall be deemed issued and outstanding as of the
Effective Time. Former shareholders of Seller and any other persons who are
entitled to receive Buyer Common Stock as a result of the Merger will be able
to vote after the Effective Time at any meeting of Buyer shareholders the
number of whole shares of Buyer Common Stock into which their shares of Seller
Common Stock are converted, regardless of whether they have exchanged their
Certificates. Whenever a dividend or other distribution is declared by Buyer
on the Buyer Common Stock with a record date after the Effective Time, the
declaration shall include dividends or other distributions on all shares of
Buyer Common Stock issuable hereunder, but no shareholder will be entitled to
receive his, her or its distribution of such dividends or other distributions
until physical exchange of such shareholders Certificate(s) shall have
been effected. Upon exchange of a shareholders Certificate(s), any such
person shall be entitled to receive from Buyer an amount equal to all
dividends or other distributions (without interest thereon, less the amount of
any Taxes that have been withheld by, imposed on or paid by Buyer or the
Exchange Agent with respect to such dividends) declared, and for which the
payment has occurred, on the shares represented thereby; _provided, however_ ,
that former shareholders of Seller shall not be entitled to receive any
dividend on their Buyer Common Stock with respect to any period for which
Buyer paid a dividend prior to the Effective Time.

 



9 2.5 _Bank Merger_. At the effective time of the Bank Merger, each share
of common stock, $100.00 par value per share, of Seller Bank (the " _Seller
Bank Common Stock_ ") issued and outstanding immediately prior to the
effective time of the Bank Merger shall automatically be canceled and there
shall be no conversion or exchange of, or consideration paid or issued for,
such Seller Bank Common Stock. The certificate(s) for such Seller Bank Common
Stock shall be surrendered and canceled. All of the shares of Buyer Bank
issued and outstanding immediately prior to the effective time of the Bank
Merger shall remain issued and outstanding after the effective time of the
Bank Merger and shall be unaffected by the Bank Merger.

 

2.6 _Withholding_. Each of Buyer, Buyer Bank, Seller, Seller Bank, the
Surviving Corporation and the Surviving Bank is entitled to deduct and
withhold, or cause the Exchange Agent to deduct and withhold, from any
consideration payable or otherwise deliverable pursuant to this Agreement to
any holder or former holder of shares of Seller Common Stock or Seller Equity
Awards such amounts as are required to be deducted or withheld therefrom
under the Code, or any provision of state, local or foreign Tax law or under
any other applicable legal requirement, and shall be further be entitled to
sell shares of Buyer Common Stock otherwise issuable pursuant to this
Agreement to satisfy any such withholding requirement (which Buyer Common
Stock shall be valued with respect to such withholding at the average of the
high and low trading prices thereof on the day of such sale). To the extent
such amounts are so deducted or withheld and remitted on a timely basis to the
appropriate Governmental Entities, such amounts shall be treated for all
purposes under this Agreement as having been paid to the person to whom
such amounts would otherwise have been paid. The parties hereto shall
reasonably cooperate to reduce or eliminate any such deduction or withholding
to the extent permissible under applicable law.

 

ARTICLE III.

 

REPRESENTATIONS AND WARRANTIES OF BUYER AND BUYER BANK

 

Except as disclosed in (a) the Buyer Reports filed after January 1, 2015, and
prior to the date hereof, but excluding any risk factors or forward-looking
disclosures set forth under the heading "Risk Factors," or under the heading
"Special Note Regarding Forward-Looking Statements" or any other disclosure
that is non-specific, cautionary, predictive or forward-looking in nature or
otherwise constitutes a "forward-looking statement" under applicable law or
(b) the correspondingly-enumerated section or subsection of the disclosure
schedule (the " _Buyer Disclosure Schedule_ ") delivered by Buyer and Buyer
Bank to Seller prior to the execution of this Agreement (which schedule sets
forth, among other things, items the disclosure of which is necessary or
appropriate either in response to an express disclosure requirement contained
in a provision hereof or as an exception to one or more representations or
warranties contained in this _Article III_ or to one or more of Buyers
covenants contained in _Article V_ , _provided, however_ , that,
notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the contrary, any disclosures
made with respect to a section of this _Article III_ shall be deemed to
qualify any other section of this _Article III_ (i) specifically referenced
or cross-referenced or (ii) to the extent it is reasonably apparent on its
face (notwithstanding the absence of a specific cross reference) from a
reading of the disclosure that such disclosure applies to such section),
Buyer and Buyer Bank, jointly and severally, hereby represent and warrant to
Seller and Seller Bank as follows:

 



10 3.1 _Corporate Organization_.

 

(a) Buyer is a corporation duly organized, validly existing and in good
standing under the laws of the State of Mississippi. Buyer has full corporate
and other power and authority to carry on its business as it is now being
conducted and is duly licensed or qualified to do business and is in good
standing in each jurisdiction in which the nature of the business conducted by
it or the character or location of the properties or assets owned or leased
by it makes such licensing or qualification necessary, except to the extent
that the failure to have such power or authority, or failure to be so
licensed, qualified or in good standing, would not reasonably be expected to
have a Material Adverse Effect on Buyer. Buyer has full power and authority
(including all licenses, franchises, permits and other governmental
authorizations which are legally required) to own, lease and operate its
properties and to engage in the business and activities now conducted by it,
except where the failure to have such licenses, franchises, permits and other
governmental authorizations would not, either individually or in
the aggregate, have a Material Adverse Effect on Buyer. As used in this
Agreement, the term " _Material Adverse Effect_ " means, with respect to
Buyer, Seller or the Surviving Corporation, as the case may be, a material
adverse effect on (i) the business, operations, assets, liabilities, results
of operations, or condition (financial or otherwise) of such party and its
Subsidiaries, taken individually or as a whole, or (ii) the ability of such
party to timely perform its obligations under this Agreement or consummate
the transactions contemplated hereby; _provided, however,_ that with respect
to clause (i), the following shall not be deemed to have or contribute to, or
be taken into account in determining whether there has been or would
reasonably be expected to be, a Material Adverse Effect: any change, state of
facts, circumstances or event caused by or resulting from (A) changes, after
the date hereof, in prevailing interest rates, currency exchange rates or
other economic or monetary conditions in the United States or elsewhere, (B)
changes, after the date hereof, in United States or foreign securities
markets, including changes in price levels or trading volumes, (C) changes or
events, after the date hereof, affecting the financial services industry
generally and not specifically relating to Buyer or Seller or their respective
Subsidiaries, as the case may be, (D) changes, after the date hereof,
in generally accepted accounting principles or regulatory accounting
requirements applicable to banks and their holding companies generally, (E)
changes, after the date hereof, in laws, rules or regulations of general
applicability or interpretations thereof by any Governmental Entity, (F)
actions of Buyer or Seller, as applicable, taken with the prior written
consent of the other or required hereunder or actions not taken by Buyer or
Seller, as applicable, to the extent such action is prohibited by this
Agreement without the prior written consent of the other party, which consent
has not been given, (G) the execution and delivery of this Agreement or the
consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby or the announcement
hereof or thereof, (H) any outbreak or escalation of major hostilities or any
act of terrorism within the United States or directed against its facilities
or citizens wherever located or any changes in global, national or regional
political conditions, (I) a failure, in and of itself, to meet earnings
projections or internal financial forecasts, but not including any underlying
causes thereof, or (J) solely as to Buyer, changes in the trading price of
Buyer Common Stock, in and of itself, but not including any underlying causes
thereof; _provided_ , _further_ , that, as to clauses (A), (C), (D), and (E),
such change, state of facts, circumstances or event does not have a
disproportionate effect on Buyer or Seller, as applicable, as compared to
other financial institutions and their holding companies.

(b) Buyer is a bank holding company registered under the Bank Holding Company
Act of 1956, as amended (the " _BHC Act_ "). True and complete copies of the
Buyer Articles and the Buyer Bylaws, as in effect as of the date of this
Agreement, have previously been made available by Buyer to Seller.

(c) Each Buyer Subsidiary, including Buyer Bank, (i) is duly organized,
validly existing and in good standing under the laws of its jurisdiction of
organization, (ii) is, in the case of Buyer Bank, a Mississippi banking
corporation, (iii) is duly qualified to do business and in good standing in
all jurisdictions (whether federal, state, local or foreign) where its
ownership or leasing of property or the conduct of its business requires it to
be so qualified, except where the failure to be so qualified or in good
standing would not reasonably be expected to have a Material Adverse Effect
on Buyer and (iv) has all requisite corporate, limited liability company or
trust, as applicable, power and authority to own or lease its properties and
assets and to carry on its business as now conducted, except to the
extent that the failure to have such power or authority would not reasonably
be expected to have a Material Adverse Effect on Buyer. As used in this
Agreement, the word " _Subsidiary_ " when used with respect to any party means
any bank, savings bank, corporation, partnership, limited liability company,
or other organization, whether incorporated or unincorporated, which is
consolidated with such party for financial reporting purposes under GAAP.

 



11 3.2 _Capitalization_.

 

(a) The authorized capital stock of Buyer consists of 150,000,000 shares of
Buyer Common Stock, of which, as of the date of this Agreement, 49,392,978
shares were issued and outstanding, and 5,000,000 shares of preferred stock,
$0.01 par value per share (such preferred stock, together with the Buyer
Common Stock, the " _Buyer Capital Stock_ "), none of which are issued and
outstanding. As of the date hereof, no shares of Buyer Capital Stock were
reserved for issuance except as disclosed in _Section_ __ _ 3.2(a)_ of the
Buyer Disclosure Schedule or for (i) 1,031,888 shares of Buyer Common Stock
reserved for issuance pursuant to the equity-based compensation plans of Buyer
disclosed in the Buyer Reports (the " _Buyer Stock Plans_ "; stock option
grants and restricted stock awards thereunder are referred to herein as "
_Buyer Equity Awards_ "). All of the issued and outstanding shares of Buyer
Capital Stock have been duly authorized and validly issued and are fully paid,
nonassessable and free of preemptive rights, with no personal liability
attaching to the ownership thereof. All of the Buyer Stock Plans have been
approved by the Buyers shareholders, to the extent such shareholder approval
is required under the requirements of the Stock Exchange or the Code. Except
as described in the Buyer Reports, as of the date of this Agreement, no trust
preferred securities (the " _Buyer Trust Preferred Securities_ ") or
subordinated debt securities of Buyer or any of its Subsidiaries are issued
or outstanding. As of the date of this Agreement, Buyer is not deferring
interest payments with respect to any of the Buyer Trust Preferred Securities
or related junior subordinated debt securities issued by it or any of its
affiliates.

 

(b) No bonds, debentures, notes or other indebtedness having the right to vote
on any matters on which shareholders may vote (" _Voting Debt_ ") of Buyer
are issued or outstanding.

(c) Except for (i) this Agreement and (ii) the Buyer Equity Awards issued
prior to the date of this Agreement and disclosed in the Buyer Reports and
otherwise pursuant to Buyer Benefit Plans, as of the date of this Agreement
there are no options, subscriptions, warrants, calls, rights, commitments
or agreements of any character to which Buyer or any of its Subsidiaries is a
party or by which Buyer or any of its Subsidiaries is bound obligating Buyer
or any of its Subsidiaries to issue, deliver or sell, or cause to be issued,
delivered or sold, additional shares of Buyer Capital Stock or shares of

Act is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods
specified in the SECs rules and forms and that such information is
accumulated and communicated to Buyers chief executive officer and
chief financial officer, as appropriate to allow timely decisions regarding
required disclosure, and (ii) internal control over financial reporting (as

evaluation prior to the date hereof, to Buyers outside auditors and the audit
committee of Buyers board of directors (x) any significant deficiencies and
material weaknesses in the design or operation of internal control over
financial reporting which are reasonably likely to adversely affect Buyers
ability to record, process, summarize and report financial information, and

standing in each jurisdiction in which the nature of the business conducted by
it or the character or location of the properties or assets owned or leased
by it makes such licensing or qualification necessary, except to the extent
that the failure to have such power or authority, or failure to be so
licensed, qualified or in good standing, would not reasonably be expected to
have a Material Adverse Effect on Seller. Seller has full power and authority
(including all licenses, franchises, permits and other governmental
authorizations which are legally required) to own, lease and operate its
properties and to engage in the business and activities now conducted by it,
except where the failure to have such licenses, franchises, permits and other

reasonably be expected to have a Material Adverse Effect on Seller and (iv)
has all requisite corporate, limited liability company or trust, as
applicable, power and authority to own or lease its properties and assets and

4.13 _Compliance with Applicable Law_.

 

(a) Seller and each of its Subsidiaries holds, and has at all times since
January 1, 2015 held, all material licenses, franchises, permits, patents,
trademarks and authorizations, and have made all filings, applications and
registrations with Governmental Entities, necessary for the lawful conduct of
their respective businesses under and pursuant to each (and have paid
all material fees and assessments due and payable in connection therewith),
all of which are in full force and effect, except where the failure to hold
such license, franchise, permit, patent, trademark or authorization in full
force and effect, to make such filing, application or registration or to pay
such fee or assessment would not, either individually or in the aggregate,
reasonably be expected to have a Material Adverse Effect on Seller. To the
knowledge of Seller, no suspension or cancellation of any such necessary
license, franchise, permit, patent, trademark or authorization is threatened.
Except for such noncompliance or default that, individually or in the
aggregate, would not reasonably be expected to have a Material Adverse Effect
on Seller, Seller and each of its Subsidiaries have since January 1, 2015
complied with, and are not in default under, any applicable law, statute,
order, rule, regulation, policy, agreement and/or guideline of any

or privacy, the USA PATRIOT Act, the Bank Secrecy Act, the Equal Credit

Practices Act, the Electronic Fund Transfer Act, the Dodd-Frank Wall Street
Reform and Consumer Protection Act, the Small Business Act of July 30, 1953,

nor any of its Subsidiaries has received any written notice from any
Governmental Entity or Regulatory Agency asserting that Seller or any of its
Subsidiaries is in violation of or default with respect to any of the

individually or in the aggregate, reasonably be expected to have a Material
Adverse Effect on Seller.

a Material Adverse Effect on Seller, and Seller has not received any written
notice from any third party asserting any such violation, misappropriation,
dilution or infringement. To the knowledge of Seller, no third party is
misappropriating, infringing, diluting or violating any Intellectual Property
owned by or licensed to or by Seller or any of its Subsidiaries, and no such
claims have been made against a third party by Seller or any of its

policies, agreements, and guidelines of any Governmental Entity or Regulatory
Agency) (the " _Seller Data_ "), against any unauthorized or improper use,
access, transmittal, interruption, modification or corruption, except where
the failure to have in place such policies and procedures has not had and
would not, either individually or in the aggregate, reasonably be expected to
have a Material Adverse Effect on Seller. Seller and Seller Bank are in
compliance with applicable confidentiality and data security laws, statutes,
orders, rules, regulations, policies, agreements, and guidelines of any
Governmental Entity or Regulatory Agency, and all industry standards
applicable to the Seller Data, including card association rules and the
payment card industry data security standards, except where such failure to be

aggregate, reasonably be expected to have a Material Adverse Effect on Seller.

currently are not any, and since January 1, 2015, have not been any
unauthorized access to or breaches of the security of (i) any of Sellers and
Seller Banks information technology systems, including the Seller-Owned

4.21 _Investment Securities_ _; BOLI_.

 

(a) Each of Seller and its Subsidiaries has good title to all securities and

contractual or statutory, that would impair the ability of Seller or its
Subsidiaries to freely dispose of such investment security at any time),
except to the extent such securities or commodities are pledged in the
ordinary course of business to secure obligations of Seller or its
Subsidiaries. Such securities and commodities are valued on the books of
Seller in accordance with GAAP in all material respects. Seller and its
Subsidiaries and their respective businesses employ investment, securities,
commodities, risk management and other policies, practices and procedures that

such Subsidiary, as the case may be, has a valid, perfected first Lien in or

necessary to comply in all material respects with applicable law in connection
with the purchase of BOLI. The value of such BOLI is and has been fairly and
accurately reflected in all material respects in the most recent balance
sheet included in the financial statements of Seller, in accordance with
GAAP. All BOLI is owned solely by Seller, Seller Bank or another Subsidiary of
Seller, and no other person has any ownership claims with respect to such BOLI

6.1 _Regulatory Matters_.

 

(a) Subject to the receipt of reasonable cooperation from Seller, Buyer shall
promptly prepare and file with the SEC, no later than forty-five (45)
business days after the date of this Agreement, the Approval
Document/Prospectus and the Form S-4, in which the Approval
Document/Prospectus will be included as a prospectus. The
Approval Document/Prospectus shall also include a proposal for the 280G Vote,
_provided_ that, subject to the reasonable cooperation of Buyer, Seller shall
be responsible for preparing the disclosures relating to the 280G Vote for
inclusion in the Approval Document/Prospectus and delivering such disclosures
to Buyer sufficiently in advance of the 45-day filing deadline to enable Buyer
and its counsel a reasonable amount of time to review, and discuss with
Seller and its counsel, such disclosures and to incorporate them into the
Approval Document/Prospectus. The parties shall use their respective

 



47  reasonable best efforts in consultation with their respective legal counsel
to have the Form S-4 declared effective under the Securities Act as promptly
as practicable after such filing, and Seller shall thereafter promptly mail
or deliver the Approval Document/Prospectus to its shareholders. Buyer shall
also use commercially reasonable efforts to obtain all necessary state
securities law or "Blue Sky" permits and approvals required to carry out the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement, and Seller shall promptly furnish
all information concerning Seller and the holders of Seller Capital Stock as
may be reasonably requested in connection with any such action. If at any
time (i) any event occurs with respect to any party or (ii) any change in the
information relating to any of the parties, or their respective affiliates,
officers or directors, supplied by a party for inclusion in the Approval
Document/Prospectus or the Form S-4 should be discovered by a party, which
event or changed information should be described or set forth in an amendment
or supplement to any of the Form S-4 or the Approval Document/Prospectus so
that such documents would not include any misstatement of a material fact or
omit to state any material fact necessary to make the statements therein,
in light of the circumstances under which they were made, not misleading,
then the party which discovers such event or information shall promptly notify
the other parties hereto and, to the extent required by law, rules or
regulations, an appropriate amendment or supplement describing such event or
information shall be promptly filed with the SEC and mailed, delivered or
otherwise made available to the shareholders of Seller.

 

(b) The parties hereto shall cooperate with each other and use their
respective reasonable best efforts to take, or cause to be taken, all actions
reasonably necessary, proper or advisable to comply with all legal
requirements applicable to the transactions contemplated hereby, including to
promptly prepare and file and cause their applicable Subsidiaries to promptly
prepare and file all necessary documentation to effect all applications,
notices, petitions and filings, to obtain as promptly as practicable all
permits, consents, waivers, approvals and authorizations of all third parties
and Governmental Entities or Regulatory Agencies which are reasonably
necessary or advisable to consummate the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement (including, without limitation, the Merger and the Bank Merger) or
to avoid any fee or penalty under any contract or agreement arising in
connection with the transactions contemplated hereby, and to comply with the
terms and conditions of all such permits, consents, waivers, approvals and
authorizations of all such Governmental Entities, Regulatory Agencies and
third parties. Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, as soon as
practicable and in no event later than forty-five (45) business days after the
date of this Agreement, Buyer and Seller shall, and shall cause their
respective Subsidiaries to, each prepare and file any applications, notices
and filings required to be filed with any Governmental Entity or Regulatory
Agency, including the FRB, FDIC, MCB or GDBF, in order to obtain the Requisite
Regulatory Approvals. The parties hereto agree that they will consult with
the other parties hereto with respect to the obtaining of all permits,
waivers, consents, approvals and authorizations of all third parties,
Governmental Entities and Regulatory Agencies necessary or advisable to
consummate the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, consider in good
faith the views of the others in connection with any proposed written or
material oral communication with any Governmental Entity or Regulatory Agency
related to the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, and each party
will keep the others apprised of the status of matters relating to completion
of the transactions contemplated herein. Buyer and Seller agree to promptly
furnish each other and each others counsel with all information concerning
themselves, their Subsidiaries, directors, trustees, officers and shareholders
and such other matters as reasonably may be necessary or advisable in
connection with the Approval Document/Prospectus, the Form S-4, the Requisite
Regulatory Approvals and any application, petition or other statement or
application made by or on behalf of Buyer, Buyer Bank, Seller or Seller Bank
or any of their affiliates to any Governmental Entity or Regulatory Agency in
connection with the transactions contemplated by this Agreement. Buyer and
Seller shall have the right to review in advance, and, to the extent
practicable, each will consult the other on, in each case subject
to applicable laws relating to the exchange of information, all the
information relating to Buyer or Seller, as the case may be, and any of their
respective Subsidiaries, which appears in any filing made with, or written
materials submitted to, any third party or any Governmental Entity or
Regulatory Agency in connection with the transactions contemplated by this

 



48  Agreement. In exercising the foregoing right, each of the parties hereto
shall act reasonably and as promptly as practicable. Each party shall consult
with the other in advance of any meeting or conference with any third party
or any Governmental Entity or Regulatory Agency in connection with the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement and, unless prohibited by such
Governmental Entity or Regulatory Agency, give the other party and
its counsel the opportunity to attend and participate in such meetings and
conferences, except to the extent such meetings and conferences relate to
confidential supervisory information. Each party will provide the other with
copies of any applications, notices, petitions or filings, and all
correspondence relating thereto, prior to filing, other than any portions of
material filed in connection therewith that contain confidential supervisory
information or other information filed under a claim of confidentiality and,
in each case, subject to applicable laws relating to the exchange of
information. Each party acknowledges and agrees that nothing in this
Agreement, including this _Section_ __ _ 6.1, Section_ __ _ 6.2_ and
_Section_ __ _ 6.9_, shall require any party to provide confidential
supervisory information to any other party.

 

(c) In furtherance and not in limitation of the foregoing, each of Buyer and
Seller shall use its reasonable best efforts to (i) avoid the entry of, or to
have vacated, lifted, reversed or overturned any decree, judgment, injunction
or other order, whether temporary, preliminary or permanent, that would
restrain, prevent or delay the Closing, and (ii) avoid or eliminate each
and every objection or impediment so as to enable the Closing to occur as
soon as possible, including proposing, negotiating, committing to and
effecting, by consent decree, hold separate order, or otherwise, the sale,
divestiture or disposition of businesses or assets of Buyer, Seller and their
respective Subsidiaries and committing to any Governmental Entity or
Regulatory Agency to maintain, and maintaining, capital levels and capital
ratios at a level specified by such Governmental Entity or Regulatory Agency,
and raising capital in connection therewith. Notwithstanding anything to the
contrary in this Agreement, nothing contained in this Agreement shall require
Buyer or Seller or their respective Subsidiaries to take, or agree to take,
and Seller and its Subsidiaries shall not be permitted to take or agree to
take, without Buyers written consent in its sole discretion, any actions
specified in this _Section_ __ _ 6.1(c)_ or agree to any condition
or restriction in connection with obtaining any Required Regulatory Approval
that, individually or in the aggregate, would reasonably be expected to have a
Material Adverse Effect on the Surviving Corporation and its Subsidiaries,
taken as a whole, after giving effect to the Merger and the Bank Merger
(including, for the avoidance of doubt, any determination by a Governmental
Entity or Regulatory Agency that the Bank Merger may not be consummated as
contemplated hereby immediately following the Effective Time) (a "
_Burdensome Condition_ "); _provided_ , that if required by Buyer, Seller and
Seller Bank shall take (or agree to take) any such action, or agree to any
such condition or restriction, so long as such action or such agreement with
respect to any condition or restriction is binding only in the event the
Closing occurs.

(d) Each of Buyer and Seller agrees, as to itself and its Subsidiaries, that
(i) none of the information supplied or to be supplied by it for inclusion or
incorporation by reference in the Form S-4 will, at the time the Form S-4 and
each amendment or supplement thereto, if any, is filed and becomes effective
under the Securities Act, contain any untrue statement of a material fact or
omit to state any material fact required to be stated therein or necessary to
make the statements therein not misleading and (ii) none of the information
supplied or to be supplied by it for inclusion or incorporation by reference
in the Approval Document/Prospectus and any amendment or supplement thereto
will, at the date it is filed with the SEC, at the date of mailing to
shareholders and at the time of the Seller Shareholders Meeting, contain any
untrue statement of a material fact or omit to state any material
fact required to be stated therein or necessary to make any statement
therein, in light of the circumstances under which such statement was made,
not misleading. Each of Buyer and Seller further agrees that if it becomes
aware that any information furnished by it would cause any of the statements
in the Form S-4 or the Approval Document/Prospectus to be false or misleading
with respect to any material fact, or to omit to state any material
fact necessary to make the statements therein not false or misleading, to
promptly inform the other party thereof and to take appropriate steps to
correct the Form S-4 or the Approval Document/Prospectus.

 



49 (e) To the extent permitted by applicable law, Seller and Buyer shall promptly
advise each other upon their (or their Subsidiaries) receiving any
communication from any Governmental Entity or Regulatory Agency whose consent
or approval is required for consummation of the transactions contemplated by
this Agreement that causes such party to believe that there is a reasonable
likelihood that any Requisite Regulatory Approval will not be obtained, that
the receipt of any such approval will be materially delayed or that a
Burdensome Condition might be imposed on any such Requisite Regulatory
Approval.

6.2 _Access to Information_.

 

(a) Upon reasonable notice and subject to applicable laws, each of Buyer and
Seller, for the purposes of verifying the representations and warranties of
the other and preparing for the Merger and the other matters contemplated by
this Agreement, shall, and shall cause each of their respective Subsidiaries
to, afford to the officers, employees, accountants, counsel, advisors and
other representatives of the other party, access, during normal business
hours during the period prior to the Effective Time and in a manner so as not
to interfere with normal business operations, to all of its properties, books,
contracts, commitments, personnel, information technology systems and records
and each shall reasonably cooperate with the other party in preparing to
execute after the Effective Time conversion or consolidation of systems and
business operations generally (including by entering into customary
confidentiality, non-disclosure and similar agreements with such service
providers and/or the other party), and, during such period, during normal
business hours and in a manner so as not to interfere with normal business
operations, each of Buyer and Seller shall, and shall cause its respective
Subsidiaries to, make available to the other party (i) a copy of each report,
schedule, registration statement and other document filed or received by it
during such period pursuant to the requirements of federal securities laws or
federal or state banking laws (other than reports or documents which it or any
of its Subsidiaries is not permitted to disclose under applicable law) and
(ii) all other information concerning its and its Subsidiaries business,
properties and personnel as the other party may reasonably request. Neither
Buyer nor Seller nor any of their respective Subsidiaries shall be required
to provide access to or to disclose information where such access or
disclosure would violate or prejudice the rights of Buyers or Sellers, as
the case may be, customers, jeopardize the attorney-client privilege of the
institution in possession or control of such information (after giving due
consideration to the existence of any common interest, joint defense or
similar agreement between the parties) or contravene any law, rule,
regulation, order, judgment, decree, fiduciary duty or binding agreement
entered into prior to the date of this Agreement. The parties hereto will
attempt to obtain waivers or make appropriate substitute disclosure
arrangements under circumstances in which the restrictions of the
preceding sentence apply.

(b) The Mutual Confidentiality and Nondisclosure Agreement, dated as of
December 11, 2017, entered into by and between Buyer and Seller (the "
_Confidentiality Agreement_ ") will remain in full force and effect following
the date of this Agreement, whether or not the Merger occurs, in accordance
with the terms thereof, and each of Buyer and Seller shall hold all
information furnished by or on behalf of the other party or any of such
partys Subsidiaries or representatives pursuant to this Agreement in
confidence to the extent required by, and in accordance with, the
provisions of the Confidentiality Agreement.

(c) No investigation by any of the parties or their respective representatives
shall affect or be deemed to modify or waive the representations and
warranties of the other party or parties set forth herein.

 



50 6.3 _Seller Shareholder Approv_ _al; Seller Adverse Recommendation
Change; Right to Match_.

(a) As soon as reasonably practicable after the Form S-4 is
declared effective for the purpose of obtaining the Requisite Seller Approval
required in connection with this Agreement, the Merger and, if so desired and
mutually agreed upon, other matters of the type customarily brought before an
annual or special meeting of shareholders to approve a merger agreement,
Seller shall take, in accordance with applicable law and the Seller Articles
and the Seller Bylaws, all action necessary to duly call, convene and hold a
meeting of its shareholders (including any adjournments, the " _Seller
Shareholders  Meeting_"). Subject to the remainder of this _Section_ __ _
6.3_, Seller shall recommend that Sellers shareholders approve this Agreement
and the transactions contemplated hereby (and shall include such
recommendation in the Approval Document/Prospectus), and Seller and its board
of directors shall otherwise use their respective reasonable best efforts to
obtain from the shareholders of Seller the Requisite Seller Approval. Except
as expressly permitted by this _Section_ __ _ 6.3_, and after compliance with
this Agreement, neither the board of directors of Seller nor any committee
thereof shall (i) withhold, withdraw, amend, modify or qualify (or propose
publicly to do any of the foregoing) in a manner adverse in any respect to the
interests of Buyer, its recommendation that Sellers shareholders approve this
Agreement and the transactions contemplated hereby or take any action or make
any statement in connection with the Seller Shareholders Meeting inconsistent
with such recommendation or approval or (ii) approve or recommend (or publicly
propose to approve or recommend) any Acquisition Proposal (a " _Seller
Adverse Recommendation Change_ "). For purposes hereof, a Seller Adverse
Recommendation Change shall include any failure by Sellers board of directors
to recommend against an Acquisition Proposal. Notwithstanding the foregoing
or anything to the contrary contained herein, subject to _Section_ __ _ 6.11_
and _Article VIII_ , at any time prior to, but not after, obtaining the
Requisite Seller Approval, if the board of directors of Seller, after
receiving the advice of its outside counsel and, with respect to financial
matters, its financial advisor, determines in good faith that it would be
reasonably likely to result in a violation of its fiduciary duties under
applicable law to continue to recommend this Agreement, then the board of
directors of Seller may effect a Seller Adverse Recommendation Change, and in
submitting this Agreement to its shareholders, the board of directors of
Seller may submit this Agreement to its shareholders without recommendation or
with such modified or qualified recommendation (although the resolutions
approving this Agreement as of the date hereof may not be rescinded or
amended), in which event the board of directors of Seller may communicate the
basis for its lack of a recommendation or such modified or qualified
recommendation to its shareholders in the Approval Document/Prospectus or an
appropriate amendment or supplement thereto;  _provided_ , that Seller and
its board of directors may not take any actions under this sentence unless (i)
Seller shall have complied in all respects with this _Section_ __ _ 6.3_ and
with  _Section_ __ _ 6.11_ and (ii)

(A) Seller gives Buyer at least five (5) business days prior written notice
of its intention to take such action and a reasonable description of the
event or circumstances giving rise to its determination to take such action
(including, in the event such action is taken by the board of directors of
Seller in response to an Acquisition Proposal with respect to Seller, the
latest material terms and conditions and the identity of the third party in
any such Acquisition Proposal, or any amendment or modification thereof, or
describe in reasonable detail such other event or circumstances if not in
response to an Acquisition Proposal with respect to Seller);

(B) in the event such action is taken by the board of directors of Seller in
response to an Acquisition Proposal with respect to Seller, Sellers board of
directors, after receiving the advice of its outside counsel and, with respect
to financial matters, its financial advisor, determines in good faith that
such Acquisition Proposal is a Superior Proposal that has not been withdrawn
and continues to be a Superior Proposal after taking into account all
adjustments to the terms of this Agreement that may be offered by Buyer under
this  _Section_ __ _ 6.3_;

(C) during such notice period and any additional notice periods, Seller has
negotiated, and has caused its Representatives to negotiate, in good faith
with Buyer to the extent Buyer wishes to negotiate (and nothing herein shall
create or imply that Buyer has any obligation to so negotiate) to enable Buyer
to propose revisions to the terms of this Agreement that obviate the need of
Sellers board of directors to effect a Seller Adverse Recommendation Change,
including, in the case of a Superior Proposal, by proposing such terms so as
to make such Superior Proposal no longer a Superior Proposal; and

 



51 (D) at the end of such notice period, the board of directors of Seller takes
into account any amendment or modification to this Agreement proposed by
Buyer and after receiving the advice of its outside counsel and, with respect
to financial matters, its financial advisor, determines in good faith that the
Acquisition Proposal continues to constitute a Superior Proposal and that it
would nevertheless be reasonably likely to result in a violation of its
fiduciary duties under applicable law to continue to recommend this Agreement.

 

Any material amendment to any Acquisition Proposal will be deemed to be a new
Acquisition Proposal for purposes of this _Section_ __ _ 6.3_ and will
require a new notice period as referred to in this _Section_ __ _ 6.3_;
_provided_ , that with respect to any such amendment, the applicable notice
period in this _Section_ __ _ 6.3_ shall be three (3) business days instead
of five (5) business days.

(b) Seller shall comply with the requirements of the Brand Group
Holdings, Inc. 401(k) and Employee Stock Ownership Plan (the " _Seller
Retirement Plan_ ") and all applicable laws with respect to obtaining the
Requisite Seller Approval and provide an information statement or similar
disclosure document describing this Agreement and the Merger to participants
in the Seller Retirement Plan. Participants in the Seller Retirement Plan will
then have the opportunity to indicate their approval or rejection of the
Merger and the transactions contemplated thereby. The trustee of the Seller
Retirement Plan shall then vote the shares of Seller Common Stock owned by the
Seller Retirement Plan at the Seller Shareholders Meeting in accordance with
the terms of the Seller Retirement Plan. Seller and Buyer agree to cooperate
in the preparation of such information statement or similar disclosure
document to be provided to the participants in the Seller Retirement Plan and
Buyer shall be given a reasonable opportunity to review and comment on
such document.

(c) Seller shall adjourn or postpone the Seller Shareholders Meeting if (i)
as of the time for which such meeting is originally scheduled there are
insufficient shares of Seller Common Stock represented (either in person or by
proxy) to constitute a quorum necessary to conduct the business of such
meeting, or (ii) on the date of such meeting Seller has not received proxies
representing a sufficient number of shares necessary to obtain the Requisite
Seller Approval; _provided_ , that Seller shall not be required to adjourn or
postpone the Seller Shareholders Meeting more than one (1) time.

(d) Provided each applicable "disqualified individual" agrees to the waiver
described below, Seller shall submit to its shareholders (either as a
proposal at the Special Shareholders Meeting or as an action by written
consent of shareholders) a proposal for approval by such number of
shareholders of Seller as is required by the terms of Section 280G(b)(5)(B)
of the Code so as to render the parachute payment provisions of Section 280G
of the Code inapplicable to any and all Payments, with such shareholder vote
intended to be obtained in a manner that satisfies all applicable
requirements of Section 280G(b)(5)(B) of the Code and the regulations
promulgated thereunder (the " _280G Vote_ "). In furtherance thereof, prior to
the submission of the 280G Vote to Sellers shareholders, Buyer and Seller
shall reasonably agree in form and substance on (i) the calculation of all
"parachute payments," including any "excess parachute payments" as defined in
Section 280G(b)(1) of the Code, (ii) the 280G Vote proposal and related
disclosures, and (iii) a waiver to be executed by each "disqualified
individual" as defined in Section 280G(c) of the Code prior to the 280G Vote,
providing for the waiver and relinquishment of any Payment subject to the
280G Vote with respect to which a favorable result is not obtained.

6.4 _Legal Conditions to Merger_ _._ Subject in all respects to _Sections_
_6.1_ and _6.3_ , Seller and Buyer shall, and shall cause their respective
Subsidiaries to, use their reasonable best efforts (a) to take, or cause to be
taken, all actions reasonably necessary, proper or advisable to comply
promptly with all legal requirements that may be imposed on such party or its
Subsidiaries with respect to the Merger and the

 



52  Bank Merger and, subject to the conditions set forth in _Article VII_
hereof, to consummate the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, and (b)
to obtain (and to cooperate with the other parties to obtain) any material
consent, authorization, order or approval of, or any exemption by, any
Governmental Entity or Regulatory Agency without the imposition of any
Burdensome Condition and any other third party that is required to
be obtained by Buyer, Seller or their respective Subsidiaries in connection
with the Merger, the Bank Merger and the other transactions contemplated by
this Agreement.

 

6.5 _Stock Exchange_ _Listing_ _._ Buyer shall cause the shares of Buyer
Common Stock to be issued in connection with the Merger to be authorized for
listing on the Stock Exchange, subject to official notice of issuance, prior
to the Effective Time.

 

6.6 _Employee Benefit Plans; Existing Agreements_ .

 

(a) During the period commencing at the Effective Time and ending on the first
anniversary thereof, Buyer shall provide each employee of Seller and its
Subsidiaries who continues to be employed by Buyer or its Subsidiaries
immediately following the Effective Time (a " _Continuing Employee_ ") with
base salary, incentive compensation opportunities and employee benefits that
are no less favorable in the aggregate than the base salary, incentive
compensation opportunities and employee benefits provided by Seller or any of
its Subsidiaries to such Continuing Employee immediately prior to the
Effective Time.

 

(b) Buyer shall provide to each Continuing Employee who has been employed by
Seller or any Subsidiary for at least six months (other than any employee who
is party to an employment agreement, severance agreement, retention agreement
or change-in-control agreement that provides for severance benefits)
whose employment terminates involuntary, other than for "cause," during the
period commencing at the Effective Time and ending on the six-month
anniversary thereof severance benefits equal to two weeks base salary (as
determined at the time of termination) for each full year of employment by
Seller and/or its Subsidiaries, including service with Buyer and its
Subsidiaries as the successor thereto, with proration for any partial year
of service, subject to a minimum of four (4) weeks severance and a maximum
of sixteen (16) weeks severance, _provided_ that, as a condition of the
receipt of such severance, an employee shall have entered into a release
of claims against the Surviving Corporation, the Surviving Bank, Seller, the
Subsidiaries of Seller and their respective affiliates in a form mutually
agreed to by Buyer and Seller and such release shall have become irrevocable
no later than sixty (60) days after termination of the employees employment.
As used herein, "cause" shall mean termination because of the employees
material personal dishonesty in the course and scope of his or her employment,
willful misconduct, breach of fiduciary duty involving personal profit,
intentional failure to perform stated duties or willful violation of any law,
rule, or regulation (other than traffic violations or similar violations),
"base salary" shall mean an employees annual salary or annual compensation
computed on an hourly basis, excluding bonuses, commissions, perquisites,
benefits or similar payments, and "year of employment" shall mean each full
12-month period of service from the latest date of hire. Any severance
hereunder shall paid in the form of a single lump sum cash payment as soon as
practicable (and no later than thirty (30) days) following the date on which
the release required hereunder shall be irrevocable, unless required to be
delayed under Section 409A(a)(2)(B)(i) of the Code.

 

(c) Buyer shall recognize all service of the Continuing Employees with Seller
and its Subsidiaries for purposes of eligibility and vesting under the Buyer
Benefit Plans and for purposes of benefits accrual under Buyer Benefit Plans
that provide for seniority-based severance, paid-time off or vacation pay;
_provided, however_ , that such service shall not be recognized to the
extent that such recognition would result in a duplication of benefits. Such
service also shall apply for purposes of satisfying any waiting periods,
evidence of insurability requirements, or the application of any preexisting
condition limitations. Each Buyer Benefit Plan shall waive pre-existing
condition limitations to the same extent waived under a corresponding

 



53  Seller Benefit Plan. To the extent practicable, Continuing Employees shall
be given credit for amounts paid under a corresponding benefit plan for
purposes of applying deductibles, copayments and out-of-pocket maximums as
though such amounts had been paid in accordance with the terms and conditions
of the Buyer Benefit Plans.

 

(d) Buyer hereby acknowledges that a "change in control" (or similar phrase)
within the meaning of the Seller Benefit Plans shall occur at the Effective
Time.

(e) At the Effective Time, Seller shall cease contributions to and terminate
the Seller Retirement Plan and shall (i) adopt written resolutions approved
in advance in writing by Seller and its legal counsel (a copy of which shall
be delivered to Buyer at the Closing) to terminate the Seller Retirement Plan
and fully vest all participants in their benefits thereunder, such
termination and vesting to be effective as of the day immediately prior to the
Effective Time; and (ii) deliver to Buyer, prior to the Closing, notice of the
Seller Retirement Plan termination to any trustees and custodians of the
Seller Retirement Plan and/or its assets. The Continuing Employees shall be
eligible to participate, effective as of the Closing Date, in a 401(k) plan
sponsored or maintained by Buyer or one of its Subsidiaries (the " _Buyer
401(k) Plan_ "). Buyer and Seller shall take any and all actions as may be
required, including amendments to the Seller Retirement Plan and/or Buyer
401(k) Plan, to permit each Continuing Employee who is a participant in the
Seller Retirement Plan to be eligible to commence participation in the Buyer
401(k) Plan as of the Closing Date, make rollover contributions to the Buyer
401(k) Plan of "eligible rollover distributions" (within the meaning
of Section 401(a)(31) of the Code) in an amount equal to the full account
balance distributable to such Continuing Employee from the Seller Retirement
Plan, and accept rollovers of any plan loans.

 

(f) At the Effective Time, Seller shall, and shall cause each of its
Subsidiaries to, adopt written resolutions approved in advance in writing by
Buyer and its legal counsel (a copy of which shall be delivered to Buyer at
the Closing) to terminate and liquidate in accordance with Treas. Reg.
1.409A-3(j)(ix)(B) (i) the provisions of any employment agreement entered
into by Seller or its Subsidiaries constituting a "nonqualified deferred
compensation plan" within the meaning of Section 409A(d)(1) of the Code, (ii)
the Seller Deferred Compensation Plan, and (iii) each of the individual
supplemental executive retirement plans set forth in Section 6.6(f) of the
Seller Disclosure Schedule, all such terminations and liquidations to be
effective immediately after the Effective Time and intended to be made in
full compliance with Section 409A of the Code. Each employee who is a party to
or participant in any such employment agreement, plan or arrangement shall
execute and deliver to Buyer at the Closing an acknowledgement and release
of claims in the form provided in _Section_ __ _ 6.6(f)_ of the Buyer
Disclosure Schedule.

(g) Nothing in this Agreement shall confer upon any employee, officer,
director or consultant of Seller or any of its Subsidiaries or affiliates any
right to continue in the employ or service of Buyer, the Surviving
Corporation, Seller, or any Subsidiary or affiliate thereof, or shall
interfere with or restrict in any way the rights of the Surviving Corporation,
Seller, Buyer or any Subsidiary or affiliate thereof to discharge or terminate
the services of any employee, officer, director or consultant of Seller or any
of its Subsidiaries or affiliates at any time for any reason whatsoever, with
or without cause. Nothing in this Agreement shall be deemed to (i) establish,
amend, or modify any Seller Benefit Plan, Buyer Benefit Plan or any other
benefit or employment plan, program, agreement or arrangement, or (ii) alter
or limit the ability of Buyer, the Surviving Corporation or any of its
Subsidiaries or affiliates to amend, modify or terminate any particular Seller
Benefit Plan, Buyer Benefit Plan or any other benefit or employment plan,
program, agreement or arrangement after the Effective Time. Without limiting
the generality of and subject to _Section_ __ _ 9.13_, nothing in this
Agreement, express or implied, is intended to or shall confer upon any
person, including any current or former employee, officer, director or
consultant of Seller or any of its Subsidiaries or affiliates, any right,
benefit or remedy of any nature whatsoever under or by reason of this
Agreement. 

 



54 6.7 _Indemnification; Directors  and Officers Insurance_.

 

(a) In the event of any threatened or actual claim, action, suit, proceeding
or investigation, whether civil, criminal or administrative, including,
without limitation, any such claim, action, suit, proceeding or investigation
in which any individual who is now, or has been at any time prior to the date
of this Agreement, or who becomes prior to the Effective Time, a director,
LLC manager or officer of Seller or any of its Subsidiaries, or who is or was
serving at the request of Seller or any of its Subsidiaries as a director, LLC
manager, officer or agent of another person (the " _Indemnified Parties_
"), is, or is threatened to be, made a party based in whole or in part on, or
arising in whole or in part out of, or pertaining to (i) the fact that such
person is or was a director, LLC manager, or officer of Seller or any of its
Subsidiaries or any of their predecessors or is or was serving at the request
of Seller or any of its Subsidiaries or any of their predecessors as a
director, LLC manager, officer or agent of another person or (ii) this
Agreement or any of the transactions contemplated hereby, whether in any case
asserted or arising before or after the Effective Time, the parties hereto
agree to cooperate and use their best efforts to defend against and respond
thereto as provided in this  _Section_ __ _ 6.7(a)_. From and after the
Effective Time, the Surviving Corporation shall indemnify, defend and hold
harmless, to the same extent as the Indemnified Parties would have been
indemnified under the Seller Articles and Seller Bylaws or any Subsidiary of
Seller as such documents were in effect on the date of this Agreement as if
the Indemnified Parties were officers or directors of Seller or any such
Subsidiary at all relevant times (except that no indemnity shall be provided
by Buyer hereunder with respect to any claim arising on account of an
Indemnified Partys service as an officer or director of another for-profit
entity), each such Indemnified Party against any losses, claims, damages,
liabilities, costs, expenses (including reasonable attorneys fees and court
costs and expenses in advance of the final disposition of any claim, action,
suit, proceeding or investigation to each Indemnified Party upon receipt of
an undertaking (in reasonable and customary form) to repay such advances if it
is ultimately determined that such Indemnified Party is not entitled to
indemnification hereunder), judgments, fines and amounts paid in settlement
in connection with any such threatened or actual claim, action, suit,
proceeding or investigation. Amounts otherwise required to be paid by Buyer to
the Indemnified Parties pursuant to this _Section_ __ _ 6.7(a)_ shall be
reduced by any amounts that such Indemnified Parties recover from any third
party. This indemnity shall be provided for six (6) years following the
Effective Time; or if there shall be any proceeding pending or threatened on
the sixth anniversary of the Effective Time, such indemnity shall continue in
full force and effect until such pending or threatened proceeding is finally
resolved.

 

(b) Subject to the following sentence, for a period of six (6) years after the
Effective Time, Buyer shall cause to be maintained in effect the current
policies of directors and officers and, if applicable, fiduciary liability
insurance maintained by Seller ( _provided_ , that Buyer may substitute
therefor policies with a substantially comparable insurer of at least the
same coverage and amounts containing terms and conditions which are no less
advantageous to the insured) with respect to claims against the then-present
and former officers and directors of Seller and its Subsidiaries arising from
facts or events which occurred at or before the Effective Time (including the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement); _provided, however_ , that Buyer
shall not be obligated to expend, in the aggregate, an amount in excess of
300% of the aggregate annual premium paid as of the date hereof by Seller for
such insurance (the " _Premium Cap_ "), and if such premium for such insurance
would at any time exceed the Premium Cap, then Buyer shall cause to be
maintained policies of insurance which provide the maximum coverage available
at an aggregate premium equal to the Premium Cap. In lieu of the foregoing,
Seller, in consultation with Buyer, may (and at the request of Buyer, Seller
shall) obtain at or prior to the Effective Time, at Buyers expense, a six-
year "tail" policy under Sellers existing directors and officers and, if
applicable, fiduciary liability insurance policy providing equivalent
coverage to that described in the preceding sentence if and to the extent that
the same may be obtained for an amount that, in the aggregate, does not exceed
the Premium Cap.

 



55 (c) In the event the Surviving Corporation or any of its successors or
assigns (i) consolidates with or merges into any other person and shall not
be the continuing or surviving corporation or entity of such consolidation or
merger, or (ii) transfers or conveys all or substantially all of its
properties or assets to any person, then, and in each such case, the
Surviving Corporation shall cause proper provision to be made so that the
successors and assigns of the Surviving Corporation will expressly assume the
obligations set forth in this  _Section_ __ _ 6.7_.

(d) The provisions of this _Section_ __ _ 6.7_ shall survive the Effective
Time and are intended to be for the benefit of, and shall be enforceable by,
each Indemnified Party and his or her heirs and representatives.

 

6.8 _Additional Agreements_ _._ If at any time after the Effective Time the
Surviving Corporation shall consider that any further assignments or
assurances in law or any other acts are necessary or desirable to carry out
the purposes of this Agreement, Seller and its proper officers and directors
shall be deemed to have granted to the Surviving Corporation an irrevocable
power of attorney to execute and deliver all such proper deeds, assignments
and assurances in law and to do all acts necessary or proper to vest, perfect
or confirm title to and possession of such rights, properties and assets in
the Surviving Corporation and otherwise to carry out the purposes of this
Agreement; and the officers and directors of the Surviving Corporation are
fully authorized in the name of Seller or otherwise to take any and all such
actions after the Effective Time.

6.9 _Current Information_ _._ During the period from the date hereof to the
Effective Time, the parties will cause one or more of each of their
designated representatives to confer on a monthly or more frequent basis with
representatives of the other party regarding each of its business, operations,
assets, liabilities, condition (financial or otherwise), results of
operations or matters relating to the completion of the transactions
contemplated hereby. Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, (i) in
such conferences with representatives of Buyer the designated
representative(s) of Seller and Seller Bank shall provide updates with
respect to loan charge-offs and sales of other real estate owned and the
status of any efforts to sell any Special Asset since the last conference,
(ii) within ten (10) days after the end of each calendar month, Seller shall
provide Buyer with (A) an unaudited consolidated balance sheet as of the end
of such month, together with unaudited consolidated statements of income,
shareholders equity and cash flows for the month and year-to-date period,
which unaudited consolidated financial statements will be prepared in
accordance with GAAP and will fairly present, in all material respects, the
financial position of Seller at the respective dates thereof and the results
of Sellers operations and cash flows for the periods indicated therein,
subject to the omission of footnotes and normal and year-end audit
adjustments as permitted by GAAP, none of which adjustments, to the extent
they relate to Sellers or Seller Banks capital ratios, will be material, and
(B) a schedule of loans charged-off during such month and other real estate
owned sold during such month. Within five (5) business days after filing
Seller shall provide Buyer copy of all reports, forms, correspondence,
registrations and statements, together with any amendments thereto, that
Seller or Seller Bank files during the period from the date of this Agreement
to the Effective Time with the Georgia Secretary, the GDBF, the FDIC, the FRB
and any other federal or state Governmental Entity having jurisdiction over
Seller and/or Seller Bank, other than any portions of material filed that
contain confidential supervisory information or other information filed under
a claim of confidentiality and, in each case, subject to applicable laws
relating to the exchange of information. Each party acknowledges and agrees
that nothing in this Agreement, including this _Section_ __ _ 6.9_, shall
require any party to provide confidential supervisory information to any
other party.

6.10 _Advice of Changes_. Seller and Buyer shall promptly advise the other of
any fact, change, event or circumstance known to it (i) that has had or is
reasonably likely to have a Material Adverse Effect on it or (ii) which it
believes would or would be reasonably likely to cause or constitute a material
breach of any of its representations, warranties, covenants or agreements
contained herein or that reasonably could be expected to give rise,
individually or in the aggregate, to the failure of a condition in _Article
VI_ _I_ ; 

 



56   _provided, however_ , that no such notification shall affect the
representations, warranties, covenants or agreements of the parties (or
remedies with respect thereto) or the conditions to the obligations of the
parties under this Agreement; _provided, further_ , that a failure to comply
with this _Section_ __ _ 6.10_ shall not constitute the failure of any
condition set forth in _Sections 7.2_ or _7.3_  to be satisfied, or otherwise
constitute a breach of this Agreement by the party failing to give such
notice, in each case unless the underlying breach would independently result
in the failure of a condition set forth in _Sections 7.2_ or  _7.3_ to be
satisfied.

6.11 _Non-Solicitation; __Acquisition Proposals_.

(a) Upon the execution of this Agreement, Seller shall, and shall cause its
Subsidiaries, affiliates, directors, officers, employees, agents and
representatives (including any investment banker, financial advisor, attorney,
accountant or other representative retained by Seller or any of its affiliates
(each a " _ _ _Representative_ "), to immediately cease and terminate any and
all existing discussions, negotiations or activities with any other parties
conducted heretofore (whether currently ongoing or not) with respect to
the possibility or consideration of any Acquisition Proposal. Upon the
request by Buyer, Seller shall request the return and destruction of all
confidential information provided to any such person. Except as otherwise
provided in  _Section_ __ _ 6.11(a)_, from the date of this Agreement
through the Effective Time, Seller shall not, shall cause each of its
Subsidiaries not to, and shall not authorize or permit any of its
Representatives to, directly or indirectly, (i) solicit, initiate, knowingly
facilitate or knowingly encourage (including by way of furnishing information
or assistance), or take any other action designed to solicit, initiate,
knowingly facilitate or encourage any inquiries or the making of any proposal
that constitutes, or is reasonably likely to lead to, any Acquisition Proposal
with respect to Seller, (ii) participate in any discussions, negotiations or
other communications regarding any Acquisition Proposal with respect to
Seller, (iii) except pursuant to _Section_ __ _ 6.3_ in connection with
making a Seller Adverse Recommendation Change, make or authorize any
statement, recommendation or solicitation in support of any Acquisition
Proposal with respect to Seller, or (iv) provide any confidential or nonpublic
information or data to any person relating to an Acquisition Proposal with
respect to Seller. Seller agrees that it will take the necessary steps
to inform its Representatives of the obligations undertaken in this _Section_
__ _ 6.11_.

(b) (i) Notwithstanding the foregoing _Section_ __ _ 6.11(a)_, but subject
to compliance with this _Section_ __ _ 6.3_ and this _Section_ __ _ 6.11_,
prior to the receipt the Requisite Seller Approval (but not after), Seller
may and may permit its Subsidiaries and its and its Subsidiaries
Representatives to engage in discussions and negotiations with, or provide any
nonpublic information or data to, any person in response to an unsolicited
bona fide written Acquisition Proposal with respect to Seller by such person
(that did not result from a breach of this _Section_ __ _ 6.11_) made after
the date of this Agreement to the extent that (x) Sellers board of
directors determines in good faith that the Acquisition Proposal constitutes
or is reasonably likely to result in a Superior Proposal and (y) Sellers
board of directors determines in good faith (after receiving the advice of its
outside counsel, and with respect to financial matters, its financial
advisors) that failure to take such actions would be reasonably likely to
result in a violation of its fiduciary duties under applicable law; _provided,
however_ , that, prior to providing any nonpublic information permitted to be
provided pursuant to the foregoing, Seller shall have provided notice to Buyer
of its intention to provide such information, and shall have provided such
information to Buyer if not previously provided to the other party, and shall
have entered into a confidentiality agreement with such third party on terms
no less favorable to it than the Confidentiality Agreement, which
confidentiality agreement shall not provide such person with any exclusive
right to negotiate with such party or prohibit disclosure to Buyer of the
terms and conditions of any Acquisition Proposal.

 



57 (ii) Seller shall promptly (but in no event later than twenty-four (24) hours)
notify Buyer after receipt of any Acquisition Proposal, any request for
nonpublic information relating to Seller or any of its Subsidiaries that would
reasonably be expected to lead to an Acquisition Proposal, or any inquiry from
any person seeking to have discussions, negotiations or other communications
relating to a possible Acquisition Proposal. Such notice shall, if made
orally, be confirmed in writing, and shall indicate the identity of the person
making the Acquisition Proposal, inquiry or request and the material terms
and conditions of any inquiries, requests, proposals or offers (including a
copy thereof if in writing and any related documentation or correspondence).
Seller shall also promptly, and in any event within twenty-four (24) hours,
notify Buyer if it enters into discussions or negotiations or engages in other
communications concerning any Acquisition Proposal or provides nonpublic
information or data to any person in accordance with this  _Section_ __ _
6.11(b)_ and keep Buyer informed of the status and terms of any such
proposals, offers, discussions or negotiations on a reasonably current basis
in the event of any material changes in the status or terms of any such
proposal, offer, discussion or negotiation, including by providing a copy of
all material documentation or correspondence relating thereto. If Seller
elects to make a Seller Adverse Recommendation Change, then Seller shall
comply with  _Section_ __ _ 6.3(a)_. Seller shall not release any third
party from or waive any provisions of, and shall use its reasonable best
efforts to enforce, any existing confidentiality or standstill agreements to
which it or any of its Subsidiaries is a party as of the date hereof in
accordance with the terms thereof.

(iii) Nothing contained in this  _Section_ __ _ 6.11_ shall prohibit either
party, its board of directors or any of its Subsidiaries from taking and
disclosing to its shareholders a position required by or otherwise complying
with Rule 14e-2(a), Item 1012(a) of Regulation M-A or Rule 14d-9 promulgated
under the Exchange Act; _provided, however_ , that compliance with such rules
shall not in any way limit or modify the effect that any action taken pursuant
to such rules has under any other provision of this Agreement.

 

(c) Unless this Agreement has been terminated in accordance with its terms,
Seller shall not, and shall cause its Subsidiaries and use its reasonable
best efforts to cause its and their officers, directors, managers, agents,
advisors and Representatives not to on its or any of its Subsidiaries or
affiliates behalf, enter into any letter of intent, memorandum
of understanding, agreement in principle, acquisition agreement, merger
agreement, or other agreement (other than a confidentiality agreement referred
to and entered into in accordance with _Section_ __ _ 6.11(b)_) relating to
any Acquisition Proposal.

(d) For purposes of this Agreement, the term " _Acquisition Proposal_ " means
any proposal, offer, third party indication of interest, inquiry, filing of
any regulatory application or notice (whether in draft or final form) or
disclosure of an intention to do any of the foregoing from any third party
relating to any (x) direct or indirect acquisition or purchase of more than
20% of the consolidated assets of Seller or more than 20% of any class of
equity or voting securities of Seller or any of its Subsidiaries whose assets,
individually or in the aggregate, constitute more than 20% of the
consolidated assets of Seller, (y) tender offer (including a self-tender) or
exchange offer that, if consummated, would result in such third party
beneficially owning more than 20% of any class of equity or voting securities
of Seller or any of its Subsidiaries whose assets, individually or in the
aggregate, constitute more than 20% of the consolidated assets of Seller or
(z) merger, consolidation, share exchange, business combination,
reorganization, recapitalization, liquidation, dissolution or similar
transaction involving Seller or any of its Subsidiaries whose assets,
individually or in the aggregate, constitute more than 20% of the consolidated
assets of Seller (other than, in the case of this clause (z) any such
transaction pursuant to which the shareholders of Seller immediately preceding
such transaction would continue to hold 80% or more of the equity or voting
interests in the surviving or resulting entity of such transaction (or, if
applicable, the ultimate parent thereof)), in each case other than the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement. For purposes of this Agreement,
the term " _Superior Proposal_ " means an unsolicited bona fide written
Acquisition Proposal that Sellers board of directors concludes in good faith,
after consultation with its outside legal counsel and financial advisor,
taking into account all legal, financial, regulatory and other aspects of
such Acquisition Proposal and the person making such Acquisition Proposal
(including any applicable termination fees,

 



58  expense reimbursement provisions and conditions to consummation) that
Sellers board of directors deems relevant as well as the terms and conditions
of this Agreement (as it may be proposed to be amended by Buyer), is (i) more
favorable to the shareholders of Seller from a financial point of view than
the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, and (ii) reasonably capable
of being completed on the terms proposed;  _provided_ that, for purposes of
this definition of Superior Proposal, the term Acquisition Proposal shall have
the meaning assigned to such term in the paragraph immediately above except
that the reference to "20% or more" in the definition of Acquisition Proposal
shall be deemed to be a reference to "50% or more."

6.12 _Assumption of Seller Debt_. Buyer agrees to execute and deliver, or
cause to be executed and delivered, by or on behalf of Buyer, the Surviving
Corporation or Buyer Bank (as the case may be), at or prior to the Effective
Time or at or prior to the effective time for the Bank Merger, as required,
one or more supplemental indentures, guarantees, and other instruments and
documentation required for the due assumption of Sellers and Seller Banks
obligations in respect of its outstanding 8.50% Subordinated Noted due 2024,
other indebtedness, Seller Trust Preferred Securities, guarantees, securities,
and other agreements to the extent required by the terms of such subordinated
notes, debt, Seller Trust Preferred Securities, guarantees, securities, and
other agreements.

6.13 _No Control of Other Party_ __ _s Business_. Nothing contained in this
Agreement shall give Buyer, directly or indirectly, the right to control or
direct the operations of Seller or its Subsidiaries prior to the Effective
Time, and nothing contained in this Agreement shall give Seller, directly or
indirectly, the right to control or direct the operations of Buyer or its
Subsidiaries prior to the Effective Time. Prior to the Effective Time, each of
Buyer and Seller shall exercise, consistent with the terms and conditions of
this Agreement, complete control and supervision over its and its
Subsidiaries respective operations. Subject to the foregoing, Seller and
Seller Bank shall cooperate with Buyer and Buyer Bank in connection with
planning for the efficient and orderly combination of the parties and the
operation of the Surviving Bank after the Bank Merger, and in preparing for
the consolidation of appropriate operating functions to be effective on the
Closing Date or such later date as Buyer may decide. Seller shall take, and
shall use its commercially reasonable efforts to cause its data processing
consultants and software providers to take, any action Buyer may reasonably
request prior to the Effective Time to facilitate the combination of
the operations of Seller Bank with Buyer Bank. Without limiting the
foregoing, Seller shall provide office space and support services (and other
reasonably requested support and assistance) in connection with the foregoing,
but only to the extent the provision of such services does not unreasonably
interfere with the normal operations of Seller.

6.14 _Adoption of Accounting Policies_. As soon as practicable after the
satisfaction or waiver of all conditions to the Closing set forth in _Article
VII_ and at such time as consummation of the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement seems reasonably assured and in any event prior to the Effective
Time (unless this Agreement is terminated pursuant to _Article VIII_ ), Seller
and Seller Bank shall take any and all necessary or appropriate actions to
adopt all Buyer accounting procedures and policies (including those policies
pertaining to charged-off and non-accrual assets); _provided_ , _however_ ,
that no such action taken by Seller or Seller Bank at the request of Buyer
pursuant to this section shall be deemed to be, or be deemed to cause, a
breach of any representation or warranty made by Seller or Seller Bank herein.

 

6.15 _Change of Method_. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in
this Agreement, before the Effective Time, Buyer may at any time change the
method of effecting the business combination contemplated by this Agreement if
and to the extent that it deems such a change to be necessary, appropriate or
desirable; _provided, however_ , that no such change shall (i) alter or
change the Exchange Ratio or the number of shares of Buyer Common Stock or
amount of cash received by holders of Seller Common Stock or the amount or
kind of Merger Consideration, (ii) adversely affect the federal income tax
consequences of the Merger or the Bank Merger to (A) holders of Seller Common
Stock as a result of receiving the Merger Consideration or (B) Buyer or
holders of Buyer Common Stock or (iii) materially impede or delay
consummation of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement in a timely
manner. In the event Buyer elects to make such a change, the parties agree to
execute appropriate documents to reflect the change.

 



59 6.16 _Takeover Statutes_. None of Buyer, Seller or their respective boards
of directors shall take any action that would cause any Takeover Statute to
become applicable to this Agreement, the Merger, the Bank Merger or any of the
other transactions contemplated hereby, and each shall take all necessary
steps to exempt (or ensure the continued exemption of) the Merger, the Bank
Merger and the other transactions contemplated hereby from any applicable
Takeover Statute now or hereafter in effect. If any Takeover Statute may
become, or may purport to be, applicable to the transactions contemplated
hereby, each party and the members of their respective boards of directors
will grant such approvals and take such actions as are necessary so that the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement may be consummated as promptly as
practicable on the terms contemplated hereby and otherwise act to eliminate or
minimize the effects of any Takeover Statute on any of the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement, including, if necessary, challenging the
validity or applicability of any such Takeover Statute.

6.17 _Shareholder Litigation_. Seller shall provide Buyer the opportunity to
participate in the defense or settlement of any shareholder litigation against
Seller and/or its directors relating to the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement throughout the course of any such litigation, and Buyer shall in
good faith consider the recommendations of Seller regarding such litigation.
Seller shall not settle any shareholder litigation without Buyers prior
written consent (such consent not to be unreasonably withheld or delayed).

 

6.18 _Disposition of Assets_. Subject to _Section_ __ _ 2.2_, at any time
prior to thirty (30) days before the Closing Date, Seller (or one of its
Subsidiaries, as applicable), shall be permitted to sell any or all of the
Special Assets (or the proceeds resulting from the sale of any such assets) to
the shareholders of Seller (including by selling the equity interests of a
Subsidiary of Seller, the sole assets of which are the Special Assets, to the
shareholders of Seller); _provided,_ that, within a reasonable time in advance
of any such sale, Seller shall provide to Buyer for its review and approval,
which approval shall not be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed, the
agreements, documents and instruments pursuant to which such sale or
distribution will be effected.

 

6.19 _Officer Agreements_. Both Buyer and Seller shall take such actions as
are reasonably necessary to terminate, effective as of the Effective Time,
the agreements between Seller and the respective executives set forth in
_Section_ __ _ 6.19_ of the Seller Disclosure in exchange for a cash payment
at Closing in a single lump sum in the amount set forth in _Section_ __ _
6.19_ of the Seller Disclosure opposite the executives name (net of
applicable tax withholdings). The termination and liquidation of such
agreements shall be made consistent with the provisions of Section 409A of
the Code for termination and liquidation of a plan in connection with a change
in control event under Section 409A of the Code, so as to avoid any additional
tax, interest or penalties in connection with the termination and liquidation

TERMINATION AND AMENDMENT

 

8.1 _Termination_ _._ This Agreement may be terminated at any time prior to
the Effective Time, whether before or after approval of this Agreement by the
shareholders of Seller:

(a) by mutual consent of Buyer and Seller in a written instrument, if the
board of directors of each so determines;

(b) by either Buyer (on behalf of itself and Buyer Bank) or Seller (on behalf
of itself and Seller Bank) (i) twenty (20) or more days after the date upon
which any application for a Requisite Regulatory Approval has been denied or
withdrawn at the request of the applicable Governmental Entity or Regulatory
Agency, unless within such 20-day period a petition for rehearing or an
amended application is filed or noticed, or (ii) twenty (20) or more days
after any petition for rehearing or amended application filed pursuant to
clause (i) is denied; _provided, however_ , that no party hereto shall have
the right to terminate this Agreement pursuant to _Section_ __ _ 8.1(b)(i)_
or _Section_ __ _ 8.1(b)(ii)_ if such denial or 

 



63  request or recommendation for withdrawal shall be due to the failure of the
party seeking to terminate this Agreement to perform or observe the covenants
and agreements of such party set forth in  _Section_ __ _ 6.1(b)_, _(c)_ or
_(e)_ ; and in each case the time period for appeals and requests for
reconsideration has run, or (iii) if any Governmental Entity or Regulatory
Agency that must grant a Requisite Regulatory Approval has denied approval of
the Merger or the Bank Merger and such denial has become final and
nonappealable or any Governmental Entity or Regulatory Agency of competent
jurisdiction shall have issued a final nonappealable order, injunction or
decree permanently enjoining or otherwise prohibiting or making illegal the
consummation of the Merger or the Bank Merger, unless the failure to obtain a
Requisite Regulatory Approval shall be due to the failure of the party seeking
to terminate this Agreement to perform or observe the covenants and
agreements of such party set forth herein;

(c) by either Buyer (on behalf of itself and Buyer Bank) or Seller (on behalf
of itself and Seller Bank) if (i) the Merger shall not have been consummated
on or before March 31, 2019 (the " _Termination Date_ "), unless a Requisite
Regulatory Approval is pending and has not been finally resolved, in which
event such date shall be automatically extended to June 30, 2019, or (ii) if a
vote of the shareholders of Seller is taken and Seller fails to obtain the
Requisite Seller Approval; _provided_ , that the failure of the Closing to
occur by such date shall not be due to the failure of the party seeking to
terminate this Agreement to perform or observe the covenants and agreements of
such party set forth herein;

 

(d) by either Buyer (on behalf of itself and Buyer Bank) or Seller (on behalf
of itself and Seller Bank) ( _provided_ , that the terminating party is not
then in material breach of any representation, warranty, covenant or other
agreement contained herein) if there shall have been a breach of any of the
covenants or agreements or any of the representations or warranties (or any
such representation or warranty shall cease to be true) set forth in this
Agreement on the part of Seller, in the case of a termination by Buyer, or
Buyer, in the case of a termination by Seller, which breach or failure to be
true, either individually or in the aggregate with all other breaches by such
party (or failures of such representations or warranties to be true), would
constitute, if occurring or continuing on the Closing Date, the failure of a
condition set forth in  _Section_ __ _ 7.2_, in the case of a termination by
Seller, or _Section_ __ _ 7.3_, in the case of a termination by Buyer, and
which is not cured by the earlier of the Termination Date and thirty (30)
days following written notice to Seller, in the case of a termination by
Buyer, or Buyer, in the case of a termination by Seller, or by its nature or
timing cannot be cured during such period;

 

(e) by Buyer (on behalf of itself and Buyer Bank), if (i) prior to such time
as the Requisite Seller Approval is obtained, Seller or its board of
directors (A) makes a Seller Adverse Recommendation Change (or publicly
discloses its intention to do so) or otherwise submits this Agreement to its
shareholders without a recommendation for approval, or recommends (or
publicly discloses its intention to do so) to its shareholders an Acquisition
Proposal other than the Merger or if Seller, its Subsidiaries or its
Representatives otherwise breaches, in any material respect, its obligations
under  _Section_ __ _ 6.11_ of this Agreement, or (B) materially breaches
its obligations under _Section_ __ _ 6.3_ or _Section_ __ _ 6.11_, or (ii) a
tender offer or exchange offer for more than 20% of the outstanding shares of
Seller Common Stock is commenced (other than by Buyer or a Subsidiary
thereof), and the board of directors of Seller recommends that the
shareholders of Seller tender their shares in such tender offer or exchange
offer or otherwise fails to recommend that such shareholders reject such
tender offer or exchange offer within the ten (10) business day period
specified in Rule 14e-2(a) under the Exchange Act; 

(f) by Buyer (on behalf of itself and Buyer Bank), if holders of more than
5.0% of the shares of Seller Common Stock outstanding at any time prior to
the Closing Date exercise their dissenters rights pursuant to Article 13 of
the GBCC; or

 



64 (g) by Seller (on behalf of itself and Seller Bank), at any time prior to the
receipt of the Requisite Seller Approval, for the purpose of entering into a
definitive agreement with respect to a Superior Proposal, _provided_ , that
Seller and its Subsidiaries and Representatives have not breached any of their
obligations under  _Sections 6.3_ or _6.11_ of this Agreement; and,
_provided_ , _further_ , that any such purported termination pursuant to this
_Section_ __ _ 8.1(g)_ shall be void and of no force or effect unless Seller
has paid the Termination Fee in accordance with _Section_ __ _ 8.3_.

The party desiring to terminate this Agreement pursuant to clause (b), (c),
(d), (e), (f) or (g) of this _Section_ __ _ 8.1_ shall give written notice of
such termination to the other party in accordance with _Section_ __ _ 9.4_,
specifying the provision or provisions hereof pursuant to which such
termination is effected.

8.2 _Effect of Termination_. In the event of termination of this Agreement by
either Buyer or Seller as provided in _Section_ __ _ 8.1_, this Agreement
shall forthwith become void and have no effect, and none of Buyer, Seller, any
of their respective Subsidiaries or any of the officers or directors of any
of them shall have any liability of any nature whatsoever hereunder, or in
connection with the transactions contemplated hereby, except that (i) _
Section_ __ _ 6.2(b)_, this  _Section_ __ _ 8.2_, _Section_ __ _ 8.3_ and
_Article IX_ (other than _Section_ __ _ 9.1_) shall survive any termination
of this Agreement, and (ii) notwithstanding anything to the contrary
contained in this Agreement, neither Buyer nor Seller shall be relieved or
released from any liabilities or damages (which, in the case of Seller, shall
include the loss to the holders of Seller Common Stock and Seller Equity
Awards of the economic benefits of the transactions contemplated hereby,
including the loss of the premium offered to the holders of Seller Common
Stock and Seller Equity Awards, it being understood that Seller shall be
entitled to pursue damages for such losses and to enforce the right to
recover such losses on behalf of its shareholders and the holders of Seller
Equity Awards in its sole and absolute discretion, and any amounts received by
Seller in connection therewith may be retained by Seller) arising out of its
fraud or willful and material breach of any provision of this Agreement.

8.3 _Termination Fee_.

 

(a) In the event that after the date of this Agreement and prior to the
termination of this Agreement a bona fide Acquisition Proposal with respect
to Seller shall have been made known to senior management of Seller or shall
have been made directly to its shareholders generally or any person reasonably
qualified to consummate an Acquisition Proposal shall have publicly announced
(and not irrevocably withdrawn at least five (5) business days prior to the
Seller Shareholders Meeting) an Acquisition Proposal with respect to Seller
and (x) (A) thereafter this Agreement is terminated by either Buyer or Seller
pursuant to _Section_ __ _ 8.1(c)_ without the Requisite Seller Approval
having been obtained or (B) thereafter this Agreement is terminated by Buyer
pursuant to _Section_ __ _ 8.1(e)_, and (y) prior to the date that is twelve
(12) months after the date of such termination, Seller enters into a
definitive agreement or consummates a transaction with respect to an
Acquisition Proposal with respect to Seller (whether or not the same
Acquisition Proposal as that referred to above), then Seller shall, on the
earlier of the date it enters into such definitive agreement and the date of
consummation of such transaction, pay Buyer, by wire transfer of same day
funds, a fee equal to $19,000,000 (the " _Termination Fee_ "); _provided_ ,
that for purposes of this _Section_ __ _ 8.3_, all references in the
definition of Acquisition Proposal to "20%" shall instead refer to "50%."

 

(b) In the event this Agreement is terminated by Buyer pursuant to _Section_
__ _ 8.1(e)_ or by Seller pursuant to  _Section_ __ _ 8.1(g)_, then
concurrently with such termination, if terminated by Seller, or within two (2)
business days after termination, if terminated by Buyer, Seller shall pay
Buyer, by wire transfer of same day funds, the Termination Fee, and such
termination shall not be deemed effective hereunder until payment by Seller of
such fee.

(c) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary herein, but without limiting the
right of any party to recover liabilities or damages in accordance with
_Section_ __ _ 8.2_, the maximum aggregate amount of fees payable by Seller
under this  _Section_ __ _ 8.3_ shall be equal to the Termination Fee, and
in no event shall any party be required to pay the Termination Fee more than
once.

 



65 (d) Each party acknowledges that the agreements contained in this  _Section_
__ _ 8.3_ are an integral part of the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement and that, without these agreements, each party would not enter into
this Agreement; accordingly, if Seller fails to pay promptly the Termination
Fee pursuant to this _Section_ __ _ 8.3_ and, in order to obtain such
payment, Buyer commences a suit which results in a judgment against Seller for
the fee set forth in this _Section_ __ _ 8.3_, Seller shall pay Buyer its
costs and expenses (including reasonable attorneys fees and expenses) in
connection with such suit, together with interest on the amount of the fee at
a rate per annum equal to the prime rate published in _The Wall Street
Journal_ on the date such payment was required to be made, plus 300 basis
points.

(e) The parties agree that the payment of the Termination Fee shall be the
sole and exclusive remedy available to Buyer and Buyer Bank with respect to
this Agreement in the event any such payment becomes due and payable and is
paid, and, upon payment of the Termination Fee, Seller and Seller Bank (and
Sellers and Seller Banks affiliates and its and their respective directors,
officers, employees, shareholders and representatives) shall have no further
liability to Buyer and Buyer Bank under this Agreement; _provided_ , 
_however_ , that Seller and Seller Bank shall not be relieved or released from
any liabilities or damages arising out of their willful and material breach of
this Agreement; _provided_ , _further_ , that the aggregate amount of
any damages determined by a court to be payable by Seller and Seller Bank
pursuant to the foregoing proviso shall be reduced by the amount of any
Termination Fee previously paid to Buyer pursuant to this _Section_ __ _
8.3_.

would reasonably be expected to know in the normal course of exercising his or
her duties based on applicable title or position, and the " _knowledge_ " of
Buyer means the actual knowledge of the senior executive officers of Buyer
and Buyer Bank (i.e., the senior executive vice president level and above) and
all facts of which any such person or persons would reasonably be expected to
know in the normal course of exercising his or her duties based on applicable
title or position; (ii) " _business day_ " means any day other than a
Saturday, a Sunday or a day on which banks in Tupelo, Mississippi or Atlanta,
Georgia are authorized by law or executive order to be closed; (iii) the term
" _person_ " means any individual, corporation (including not-for-profit),
general or limited partnership, limited liability company, joint venture,
estate, trust, association, organization, Governmental Entity or other entity
of any kind or nature; and (iv) an " _affiliate_ " of a specified person is
any person that directly or indirectly controls, is controlled by, or is
under common control with, such specified person. Any document or item will be
deemed "delivered," "provided" or "made available" to a party within the
meaning of this Agreement if such document or item is (i) made available to
such party specifically for review in person by

 



67  the other party or its representatives, (ii) contained and accessible to
such party for a continuous period of at least four (4) days immediately prior
to the execution of this Agreement (if to be delivered, provided or made
available prior to the date hereof) or the Closing Date (if to be delivered,
provided or made available prior to Closing) in the electronic data room
hosted by Intralinks, Inc. established by Seller in connection with the
transactions contemplated hereby to which Buyer and its designated
representatives had access rights during such period, or (iii) filed by Buyer

to "dollars" or "$" in this Agreement are to United States dollars.

The parties intend that each representation, warranty and covenant contained
herein shall have independent significance. If any party has breached any
representation, warranty, or covenant contained herein in any respect, the
fact that there exists another representation, warranty or covenant relating
to the same subject matter (regardless of the relative levels of specificity)
that the party has not breached shall not detract from or mitigate the fact
that the party is in breach of the first representation, warranty or
covenant. Further, it is understood and agreed that the specification of any
dollar amount in the representations and warranties contained in this
Agreement or the inclusion of any specific item in the Seller Disclosure
Schedule or the Buyer Disclosure Schedule is not intended to imply that such
amounts or higher or lower amounts, or the items so included or other items,
are or are not material or would have a Material Adverse Effect on Seller or
Buyer, as the case may be, and neither party shall use the fact of the
setting of such amounts or the fact of the inclusion of any such item in the
Seller Disclosure Schedule or the Buyer Disclosure Schedule in any dispute or
controversy between the parties as to whether any obligation, item or matter
not described in this Agreement or included in the Seller Disclosure Schedule
or the Buyer Disclosure Schedule is or is not material for purposes of this
Agreement.

 

9.6 _Amendment_ _._ Subject to compliance with applicable law, this Agreement
may be amended by the parties hereto at any time prior to the Effective Time,
whether before or after the approval of the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement by the shareholders of Seller; _provided,_ _however_ , that after
any approval of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement by the
shareholders of Seller, there may not be, without further approval of such
shareholders, any amendment of this Agreement that requires further approval
under applicable law. This Agreement may not be amended except by
an instrument in writing signed on behalf of each of the parties hereto.

9.7 _Extension; Waiver_ _._ At any time prior to the Effective Time, the
parties hereto may, to the extent legally allowed, (a) extend the time for the
performance of any of the obligations or other acts of Buyer and Buyer Bank,

waive any inaccuracies in the representations and warranties contained herein
or in any document delivered pursuant hereto on the part of Buyer and Buyer
Bank, in the case of Seller, or Seller and Seller Bank, in the case of Buyer,
and (c) waive compliance with any of the agreements on the part of Buyer and
Buyer Bank, in the case of Seller, or Seller and Seller Bank, in the case of
Buyer, or of such parties conditions contained herein; _provided,_  
_however_ , that after any approval of the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement by the shareholders of Seller, there may not be, without further
approval of such shareholders, any extension or waiver of this Agreement or
any portion thereof which requires further approval under applicable law. Any
agreement on the part of a party hereto to any such extension or waiver shall
be valid only if set forth in a written instrument signed on behalf of such
party, but such extension or waiver or failure to insist on strict compliance
with an obligation, covenant, agreement or condition shall not operate as a
waiver of, or estoppel with respect to, any subsequent or other failure.

 

9.8 _Counterparts_ _._ This Agreement may be executed in counterparts, all of
which shall be considered one and the same agreement, and shall become
effective when counterparts have been signed by each of the parties and
delivered to the other parties, it being understood that all parties need not
sign the same counterpart.

 



68 9.9 _Entire Agreement_ _._ This Agreement (including the documents and
the instruments referred to herein) together with the Confidentiality
Agreement constitutes the entire agreement among the parties and supersedes
all prior agreements and understandings, both written and oral, among the
parties with respect to the subject matter hereof.

9.10 _Governing La_ _w; Venue_ _._ This Agreement shall be governed
and construed in accordance with the laws of the State of Mississippi,
without giving effect to the principles of conflicts of laws thereof except
(a) that matters relating to the fiduciary duty of Sellers board of directors
shall be governed by the laws of the State of Georgia, without giving effect
to the principles of conflicts of laws thereof, and (b) to the extent
mandatory provisions of federal law apply. Any legal action or proceeding with
respect to this Agreement by one party against any other party shall be
brought only in any federal or state court located in the State of
Mississippi, which shall have exclusive jurisdiction and venue for such
purpose. By execution and delivery of this Agreement, the parties hereby
accept for themselves, and in respect of their property, generally and
unconditionally, the jurisdiction and venue of the aforesaid courts and waive
any objection to the laying of venue on the grounds of a lack of jurisdiction
or _forum non conveniens_ which they may now or hereafter have to the
bringing or maintaining of any such action or proceeding in such jurisdiction,
and agree that service of process upon any party in any such action or
proceeding will be effective if notice is given in accordance with _Section_
__ _ 9.4_.

9.11 _Waiver of Jury Trial_ _._ EACH PARTY ACKNOWLEDGES AND AGREES THAT ANY
CONTROVERSY WHICH MAY ARISE UNDER THIS AGREEMENT IS LIKELY TO INVOLVE
COMPLICATED AND DIFFICULT ISSUES, AND THEREFORE EACH SUCH PARTY HEREBY
IRREVOCABLY AND UNCONDITIONALLY WAIVES, TO THE FULLEST EXTENT PERMITTED
BY APPLICABLE LAW, ANY RIGHT SUCH PARTY MAY HAVE TO A TRIAL BY JURY IN
RESPECT OF ANY SUIT, ACTION OR OTHER PROCEEDING DIRECTLY OR INDIRECTLY ARISING
OUT OF OR RELATING TO THIS AGREEMENT OR THE TRANSACTIONS CONTEMPLATED BY THIS
AGREEMENT. EACH PARTY CERTIFIES AND ACKNOWLEDGES THAT: (I) NO REPRESENTATIVE,
AGENT OR ATTORNEY OF ANY OTHER PARTY HAS REPRESENTED, EXPRESSLY OR OTHERWISE,
THAT SUCH OTHER PARTY WOULD NOT, IN THE EVENT OF ANY ACTION, SUIT OR
PROCEEDING, SEEK TO ENFORCE THE FOREGOING WAIVER, (II) EACH PARTY UNDERSTANDS
AND HAS CONSIDERED THE IMPLICATIONS OF THIS WAIVER, (III) EACH PARTY MAKES
THIS WAIVER VOLUNTARILY, AND (IV) EACH PARTY HAS BEEN INDUCED TO ENTER INTO
THIS AGREEMENT BY, AMONG OTHER THINGS, THE MUTUAL WAIVERS AND CERTIFICATIONS
IN THIS _SECTION 9.11_.

9.12 _Publicity_ _._ Except as otherwise required by applicable law or the
rules of the Stock Exchange or as required under the rules and regulations of
the SEC, neither Seller nor Buyer shall, or shall permit any of their
respective Subsidiaries to, issue or cause the publication of any
press release or other public announcement with respect to, or otherwise make
any public statement concerning, the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement without the prior consent of Buyer, in the case of a proposed
announcement or statement by Seller or any of its Subsidiaries, or Seller, in
the case of a proposed announcement or statement by Buyer or any of its
Subsidiaries, in each case, which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld,
conditioned or delayed.

 

9.13 _Assignment; Third Party_ ___Beneficiaries_ _._ Neither this Agreement
nor any of the rights, interests or obligations of the parties hereto shall
be assigned by any of the parties hereto (whether by operation of law or
otherwise) without the prior written consent of the other parties hereto.
Subject to the preceding sentence, this Agreement will be binding upon, inure
to the benefit of and be enforceable by the parties and their respective
successors and assigns. Any purported assignment in contravention hereof shall

 



69  be null and void. Except for (i) as otherwise specifically provided in
_Section_ __ _ 6.6_, and (ii) from and after the Effective Time, but only if
the Effective Time shall occur, the rights of holders of Seller Common Stock
to receive the Merger Consideration as provided in _Article II_ , and the
rights of holders of Seller Equity Awards under _Section_ __ _ 1.6_, this
Agreement (including the documents and instruments referred to herein) is not
intended to confer upon any person other than the parties hereto any rights or
remedies hereunder. The representations and warranties in this Agreement are
the product of negotiations among the parties hereto and are for the sole
benefit of the parties. Any inaccuracies in such representations and
warranties are subject to waiver by the parties hereto in accordance herewith
without notice or liability to any other person. In some instances, the
representations and warranties in this Agreement may represent an allocation
among the parties hereto of risks associated with particular matters
regardless of the knowledge of any of the parties hereto. Consequently,
persons other than the parties hereto may not rely upon the representations
and warranties in this Agreement as characterizations of actual facts or
circumstances as of the date of this Agreement or as of any other date.

 

9.14 _Severability_ _._ Whenever possible, each provision or portion of any
provision of this Agreement shall be interpreted in such manner as to be
effective and valid under applicable law, but if any provision or portion of
any provision of this Agreement is held to be invalid, illegal or
unenforceable in any respect under any applicable law or rule in
any jurisdiction, such invalidity, illegality or unenforceability shall not
affect any other provision or portion of any provision in such jurisdiction,
and this Agreement shall be reformed, construed and enforced in such
jurisdiction such that the invalid, illegal or unenforceable provision or
portion thereof shall be interpreted to be only so broad as is enforceable.

9.15  _Delivery by Facsimile or Electronic Transmission_ _._ This Agreement
and any signed agreement or instrument entered into in connection with this
Agreement, and any amendments or waivers hereto or thereto, to the extent
signed and delivered by means of a facsimile machine or by e-mail delivery of
a ".pdf" format data file, shall be treated in all manner and respects as an
original agreement or instrument and shall be considered to have the same
binding legal effect as if it were the original signed version thereof
delivered in person. No party hereto or to any such agreement or instrument
shall raise the use of a facsimile machine or e-mail delivery of a ".pdf"
format data file to deliver a signature to this Agreement or any amendment or
waiver hereto or other such instrument or the fact that any signature or
agreement or instrument was transmitted or communicated through the use of a
facsimile machine or e-mail delivery of a ".pdf" format data file as a defense
to the formation of a contract, and each party hereto forever waives any such
defense.

9.16 _Specific Performance_. The parties hereto agree that irreparable damage
would occur in the event that any of the provisions of this Agreement were
not performed in accordance with their specific terms or were otherwise
breached. It is accordingly agreed that, subject to _Section_ __ _ 8.3_, the
parties shall be entitled to specific performance of the terms hereof,
including an injunction or injunctions to prevent breaches of this Agreement
and to enforce specifically the terms and provisions hereof in any action or
proceeding brought in accordance with  _Section_ __ _ 9.10_, this being in
addition to any other remedy to which they are entitled at law or in equity.
Each of the parties hereby further waives (a) any defense in any action for
specific performance that a remedy at law would be adequate and (b) any
requirement under any law to post security or a bond as a prerequisite to
obtaining equitable relief.

A-1 SUPPORT AGREEMENT

 

This SUPPORT AGREEMENT, dated as of March 28, 2018 (this " _Agreement_ "), is
made by and between Renasant Corporation, a Mississippi corporation ("
_Buyer_ "), Brand Group Holdings, Inc., a Georgia corporation (" _Seller_ "),
and the undersigned (the " _Undersigned_ ").

 

WHEREAS, the Undersigned is a significant shareholder of Seller, and the
beneficial holder of shares of common stock, no par value per share, of
Seller (the " _Seller Common Stock_ ");

WHEREAS, Buyer and Seller are considering the execution of an Agreement and
Plan of Merger (the " _Merger Agreement_ ") contemplating, among other things,
the acquisition of Seller through the merger of Seller with and into Buyer
(the " _Merger_ ");

 

WHEREAS, in consideration of the substantial expenses that Buyer and Seller
will incur in connection with the transactions contemplated by the Merger
Agreement and to induce Buyer and Seller to execute the Merger Agreement and
to proceed to incur such expenses, the Undersigned has agreed to enter into
this Agreement; and

 

WHEREAS, capitalized terms used herein without definition shall have the
respective meanings ascribed to them in the Merger Agreement; 

NOW, THEREFORE, the parties hereto agree as follows:

 

1. While this Agreement is in effect, the Undersigned shall not, directly or indirectly: (a) sell, assign, exchange, transfer, pledge or otherwise dispose of or encumber (any of the foregoing, a " _transfer_ ") (other than in connection with an ordinary bank loan) prior to the record date for the determination of shareholders entitled to give consent to approve the Merger Agreement or for the Seller Shareholders Meeting, as applicable, any or all of its shares of Seller Common Stock, or enter into any contract or agreement regarding any of the foregoing, (b) deposit any shares of Seller Common Stock into a voting trust or enter into a voting agreement or arrangement with respect to any shares of Seller Common Stock or grant any proxy with respect thereto, other than for the purpose of voting to approve the Merger Agreement and the Merger and matters related thereto and the 280G Vote or voting against any Acquisition Proposal (even if such Acquisition Proposal constitutes a Superior Proposal), or (c) exercise, or give notice of an intent to exercise, any of its registration rights arising under that certain Amended and Restated Shareholders Agreement dated as of September 21, 2016 by and among the Company and the shareholders party thereto (the " _Shareholders_ __ _Agreement_ "). For the avoidance of doubt, Buyer or Seller shall be entitled to withhold its approval to any transfer of any of the Undersigneds shares of Seller Common Stock if the transferee in any such transfer does not agree in writing to be bound by this Agreement to the same extent as the Undersigned. 

 

2. While this Agreement is in effect the Undersigned shall vote all of the shares of Seller Common Stock for which the Undersigned has sole voting authority, and shall use its reasonable efforts to cause to be voted all of the shares of Seller Common Stock for which the Undersigned has shared voting authority: (a) for the approval of the Merger Agreement and the Merger by written consent or at the Seller Shareholders Meeting (including any adjournments or postponements thereof), as applicable; (b) against any Acquisition Proposal (even if such Acquisition Proposal constitutes a Superior Proposal); (c) against any corporate action the consummation of which would reasonably be expected to (i) frustrate the purposes, or prevent or materially delay the consummation of, the transactions contemplated by the Merger Agreement or (ii) result in a breach of any covenant, representation or warranty or any other obligation or agreement of Seller or Seller Bank under the Merger Agreement, and (d) assuming the terms and conditions of Section 6.3(d) of the Merger Agreement have been satisfied, for approval of the 280G Vote. In addition, the Undersigned hereby waives, and agrees not to assert or perfect, any appraisal or dissenters rights that the Undersigned may have by virtue of its ownership of shares of Seller Common Stock. 3. The Undersigned hereby revokes any and all previous proxies granted with respect to its shares of Seller Common Stock. By entering into this Agreement, the Undersigned hereby grants a revocable proxy appointing Buyer as the Undersigneds attorney-in-fact and proxy, with full power of substitution, for and in the Undersigneds name, to vote, express consent or dissent, or otherwise to utilize such voting power in the manner contemplated by Section 2 above as Buyer or its proxy or substitute shall, in Buyers sole discretion, deem proper with respect to the Undersigneds shares of Seller Common Stock. The proxy granted by the Undersigned pursuant to this Section 3 is revocable and is granted in consideration of Buyer entering into this Agreement and the Merger Agreement and incurring certain related fees and expenses. The proxy granted by the Undersigned shall be revoked upon termination of this Agreement in accordance with its terms. 

4. The foregoing restrictions shall (i) apply to all shares of Seller Common Stock beneficially owned by the Undersigned on the date of this Agreement as well as all such shares of Seller Common Stock that the Undersigned purchases, acquires the right to vote or otherwise acquires beneficial ownership of after the date of this Agreement, but (ii) not apply to shares with respect to which the Undersigned may have voting power as a fiduciary for others. In addition, this Agreement shall only apply to actions taken by the Undersigned in its capacity as a shareholder of Seller and, if applicable, shall not in any way dictate how the Undersigned votes as a director of Seller in any manner or otherwise prohibit, limit or affect actions the Undersigned may take in his or her capacity as a director or officer of Seller. 

5. In its capacity as a shareholder of Seller, the Undersigned agrees that it will not, and will cause its officers, managers and directors, and will instruct and use commercially reasonable efforts to cause its representatives and partners not to, directly or indirectly, (i) initiate, solicit, knowingly encourage or knowingly facilitate inquiries or proposals with respect to an Acquisition Proposal, (ii) engage or participate in any negotiations with any person concerning any Acquisition Proposal, (iii) provide any confidential or nonpublic information or data to, have or participate in any discussions with or otherwise cooperate in any way with, any person in connection with any Acquisition Proposal or (iv) enter into any term sheet, letter of intent, memorandum of understanding, agreement in principle, acquisition agreement, merger agreement or other agreement (other than a confidentiality agreement referred to and entered into in accordance with Section 6.3 of the Merger Agreement) relating to any Acquisition Proposal, in each case, except to the extent that Seller is permitted to take such action pursuant to the Merger Agreement. The Undersigned will and will cause its officers, managers and directors, and will use its commercially reasonable efforts to cause its representatives and partners to, immediately cease and cause to be terminated any activities, discussions or negotiations conducted before the date of this Agreement with any person other than Buyer with respect to any Acquisition Proposal. The Undersigned will promptly (within twenty-four (24) hours) advise Buyer following its receipt of any Acquisition Proposal or any inquiry which could reasonably be expected to lead to an Acquisition Proposal, and the substance thereof (including the material terms and conditions of the Acquisition Proposal), and will keep Buyer apprised of any related material developments, discussions and negotiations on a reasonably current basis, including any amendments to or revisions of the terms of such inquiry or Acquisition Proposal, in each case to the extent Seller has not previously notified Buyer. All references herein to an Acquisition Proposal shall refer to an Acquisition Proposal with respect to Seller. 

6. The parties hereto acknowledge and agree that any remedy at law for breach of the foregoing provisions shall be inadequate and that, in addition to any other relief which may be available, the parties shall be entitled to temporary and permanent injunctive relief, or other equitable remedy, without having to prove actual damages. Each of the parties further waives any requirement under any law to post security or a bond as a prerequisite to obtaining equitable relief. 7. This Agreement may be executed in counterparts, all of which shall be considered one and the same agreement, and shall become effective when counterparts have been signed by both of the parties and delivered to the other party, it being understood that all parties need not sign the same counterpart. This Agreement, to the extent signed and delivered by means of a facsimile machine or by e-mail delivery of a ".pdf" format data file, shall be treated in all manner and respects as an original agreement or instrument and shall be considered to have the same binding legal effect as if it were the original signed version thereof delivered in person. No party hereto shall raise the use of a facsimile machine or e-mail delivery of a ".pdf" format data file to deliver a signature to this Agreement or the fact that any signature was transmitted or communicated through the use of a facsimile machine or e-mail delivery of a ".pdf" format data file as a defense to the formation of a contract, and each party hereto forever waives any such defense. 

 

8. As of the date hereof, the Undersigned has voting power (sole or shared) with respect to the number of shares of Seller Common Stock set forth below, and there are no other shares beneficially owned by the Undersigned not set forth below. The Undersigned has full corporate power and authority and legal capacity to execute and deliver this Agreement and to perform its obligations hereunder. This Agreement has been duly and validly executed and delivered by the Undersigned and constitutes the legal, valid and binding obligation of the Undersigned, enforceable against it in accordance with its terms. Neither the Undersigneds execution and delivery of this Agreement nor the compliance by it with any of the provisions hereof will conflict with or result in a breach, or constitute a default under any provision of, any agreement, document or instrument or any law applicable to Undersigned or its assets. No consent, approval or authorization of, or designation or filing with, any Governmental Entity, Regulatory Authority or other person (including, if applicable, the Undersigneds spouse) is required in connection with the Undersigneds execution and delivery of this Agreement and compliance with the provisions hereof. The Undersigned hereby represents and warrants to the Company that, as of the date of this Agreement, it has not exercised any of its registration rights under the Shareholders Agreement, the Company has fulfilled all of its requests for information, demands and other claims under the Shareholders Agreement and, to its knowledge, neither the Company nor any other shareholder party thereto is in default of the Shareholders Agreement (nor is there any event or occurrence that, with the giving of notice, the passage of time or both, would constitute a default under the Shareholders Agreement). 

9. The Undersigned may not assign any of its rights or obligations under this Agreement to any other person. 

10. EACH PARTY ACKNOWLEDGES AND AGREES THAT ANY CONTROVERSY WHICH MAY ARISE UNDER THIS AGREEMENT IS LIKELY TO INVOLVE COMPLICATED AND DIFFICULT ISSUES, AND THEREFORE EACH SUCH PARTY HEREBY IRREVOCABLY AND UNCONDITIONALLY WAIVES, TO THE EXTENT PERMITTED BY LAW AT THE TIME OF INSTITUTION OF THE APPLICABLE LITIGATION, ANY RIGHT SUCH PARTY MAY HAVE TO A TRIAL BY JURY IN RESPECT OF ANY LITIGATION DIRECTLY OR INDIRECTLY ARISING OUT OF OR RELATING TO THIS AGREEMENT OR THE TRANSACTIONS CONTEMPLATED BY THIS AGREEMENT. EACH PARTY CERTIFIES AND ACKNOWLEDGES THAT: (I) NO REPRESENTATIVE, AGENT OR ATTORNEY OF ANY OTHER PARTY HAS REPRESENTED, EXPRESSLY OR OTHERWISE, THAT SUCH OTHER PARTY WOULD NOT, IN THE EVENT OF LITIGATION, SEEK TO ENFORCE THE FOREGOING WAIVER, (II) EACH PARTY UNDERSTANDS AND HAS CONSIDERED THE IMPLICATIONS OF THIS WAIVER, (III) EACH PARTY MAKES THIS WAIVER VOLUNTARILY, AND (IV) EACH PARTY HAS BEEN INDUCED TO ENTER INTO THIS AGREEMENT BY, AMONG OTHER THINGS, THE MUTUAL WAIVERS AND CERTIFICATIONS IN THIS SECTION 11. 11. In the event that any party institutes any legal suit, action or proceeding against the other party to enforce the covenants contained in this Agreement (or obtain any other remedy in respect of any breach of this Agreement), the prevailing party in the suit, action or proceeding shall be entitled to receive in addition to all other damages to which it may be entitled, the costs incurred by such party in conducting the suit, action or proceeding, including reasonable attorneys fees and expenses and court costs. 

 

12. Any provision of this Agreement may be amended or waived if, but only if, such amendment or waiver is in writing and is signed, in the case of an amendment, by each party to this Agreement or, in the case of a waiver, by the party against whom the waiver is to be effective. This Agreement and all obligations of the parties hereunder shall automatically terminate upon the earlier of (a) the Effective Time, (b) the termination of the Merger Agreement in accordance with its terms, or (c) any amendment to the Merger Agreement which reduces the consideration payable to the Undersigned or otherwise materially and adversely impacts the Undersigned.
