hereinafter collectively referred to as " _Plans_ "). All Plans in which
Associated Employees participate are sponsored or maintained by Seller or an
Affiliate (other than the Company).

3.16 _Investment Representations_.

 

(a) Seller is an "accredited investor" (as such term is used in Rule 501 under
the Securities Act, as amended by the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and
Consumer Protection Act) and has such knowledge and experience in financial
and business matters as to be capable of evaluating the merits and risks of
its investment in Buyer Units, and it is able to bear the economic risk of
such an investment for an indefinite period of time. Seller was not formed for
the specific purpose of acquiring Buyer Units.

(b) The Consideration Units are being acquired (i) solely for investment for
the account of Seller and not as nominee or agent or otherwise on behalf of
any other Person, and (ii) not with a view to or with any present intention
to reoffer, resell, fractionalize, assign, grant any participating interest
in, transfer or otherwise distribute the Consideration Units in violation of
the Securities Act.

 



15 (c) Seller understands that the transfer of the Consideration Units to Seller
has not been registered under the Securities Act or any applicable state
securities Laws by reason of a specified exemption from the registration
provisions of the Securities Act and applicable state securities Laws, which
depends upon, among other things, the bona fide nature of Sellers investment
intent as expressed herein.

(d) Seller understands that Buyer is under no obligation to register the
Consideration Units for sale on Sellers behalf or to assist Seller in
complying with any exemption from registration under the Securities Act or
under applicable state securities Laws.

(e) Seller agrees that the certificates evidencing the Consideration Units
will be stamped or otherwise imprinted with a conspicuous legend in
substantially the following form:

The Units represented by this certificate have not been registered under the
Securities Act of 1933, as amended (the "Act") or any state securities laws.
These Units have been acquired for investment and not with a view to
distribution or resale, and may not be sold, pledged, hypothecated, donated
or otherwise transferred, whether or not for consideration, without an
effective registration statement under the Act and any applicable state
securities laws, or an opinion of counsel satisfactory to Inergy Midstream,
L.P. that such registration is not required with respect to the proposed
disposition thereof and that such disposition will not cause the loss of the
exemption(s) upon which Inergy Midstream, L.P. relied in issuing these Units
to the original purchaser thereof. 

(f) Seller agrees that a stop transfer order that gives effect to the
foregoing restrictive legend will be placed on the transfer books maintained
with respect to the Consideration Units for so long as transfers are
restricted under the Securities Act.

3.17 _No Other Warranties_. Except for the specific representations and
warranties of Seller expressly set forth in this _Section_ 3, there are no
other representations or warranties (including any warranty of
merchantability or warranty of fitness for a particular purpose), express or
implied, made by Seller, the Company or any of their employees, agents,
members, partners, managers or representatives relating to or concerning any
assets, properties, liabilities, obligations, financial condition,
operations, or other aspects or prospects of the Company and its business
(including the physical condition, structural integrity, suitability or
usability of any salt caverns for gas storage purposes), and all assets,
properties and business of the Company are being acquired by Buyer in AS IS,
WHERE IS CONDITION AND WITH ALL FAULTS.

3.18 _Reliance_. Seller has been actively involved in the management of the
Company and, in connection with its decision to sell the Interest pursuant to
this Agreement, is not relying upon any representation or warranty of Buyer
or the Company regarding the Company or its business, financial condition or
results of operations, except as expressly set forth herein.

 



16 4\. _Representations and Warranties of Buyer_. Buyer hereby makes the

correct on the date hereof, each of which shall be unaffected by any
investigation heretofore or hereafter made by Seller and each of which shall

has all requisite power and authority to own, operate and lease its assets and
to conduct its business as and where such business is now conducted.

execution and delivery by Buyer of this Agreement and the Transaction
Documents and the performance of its obligations hereunder and thereunder have
been duly approved by all necessary limited liability company action, and no
further approvals are required by the officers, directors, partners, managers,
members or equity holders of Buyer in connection therewith. This Agreement and
each of the Transaction Documents contemplated hereby to be entered into
by Buyer constitute (or, when executed, will constitute) the legal, valid and
binding obligations of Buyer, enforceable against Buyer in accordance with
their respective terms, except as enforcement may be limited by bankruptcy,
insolvency, reorganization, moratorium, or other similar Laws relating to or
affecting creditors rights generally and to general equity principles
(whether such enforceability is considered in a proceeding at Law or in
equity).

 

4.4 _No Creation of Violation, Default, Breach or Encumbrance_. The execution,
delivery and performance by Buyer of this Agreement and the Transaction
Documents do not, (i) violate (A) any applicable Law in any material respect,
or (B) any order, writ, injunction, decree, judgment or ruling of any

filing, recording, publication, registration or other action is necessary on
behalf of Buyer (y) to authorize Buyers execution, delivery and performance
of this Agreement or any other Transaction Document, or (z) for the legality,
validity, binding effect or enforceability with respect to Buyer of any of the
foregoing. 

4.6 _Reliance_. Buyer has been actively involved in the management of the
Company and, in connection with its decision to purchase the Interest
pursuant to this Agreement, is not relying upon any representation or warranty
of Seller or the Company regarding the Company or its business, financial

17 5\. _Covenants and Acknowledgements_.

 

5.1 _Proration of Taxes_. All ad valorem Taxes (including real property,
personal property and inventory) against or in respect of the assets of the
Company for the taxable period which includes the day before the date hereof
will be prorated between Seller and Buyer as of the end of the day before the
date hereof based on the ratio of the number of days in the portion of
any taxable period that includes the day before the date hereof and the
number of days in the entire Tax period. If the amount of such Taxes or
assessments cannot be ascertained as of the day before the date hereof,
proration will be made on the basis of the preceding year and to the extent
that such proration may be inaccurate Buyer and Seller agree to make such
payment to the other within ten business days after the Tax statements have
been received which are necessary to allocate such Taxes properly between
Buyer and Seller as of the end of the day before the date hereof; provided,
however, that Seller will have no responsibility for any increase in ad
valorem Taxes resulting from any increase in valuation assessments of
property resulting from the transactions contemplated by this Agreement.
Buyer will cause the Company to pay such Taxes when due and Buyers and
Sellers prorated portions thereof will be paid by Buyer and Seller upon the
Companys request to the extent not already paid by such Person. Ad valorem
Taxes include payments to be made by the Company in lieu of ad valorem Taxes

5.2 _Cooperation with Tax Filings_. Buyer and Seller will reasonably
cooperate, as and to the extent reasonably requested by the other party, in
connection with the filing of Tax Returns and any audit, litigation or other
proceeding with respect to Taxes relating to the Company or its assets, Buyer
and Seller acknowledge that the transfer of the Interest (other than the
proportionate share contributed in exchange for Buyer Units) will be treated
as an asset purchase for Federal and state income tax purposes. Accordingly,
Seller will file all Tax Returns for the period ending at the effective time
of the transfer of the Interest. Such cooperation includes the retention and
(upon the other partys request) the provision of records and information
reasonably relevant to any such audit, litigation or other proceeding and
making employees available on a mutually convenient basis to provide
additional information and explanation of any material provided under this
_Section_ 5.2. Buyer and Seller will (A) retain (or cause the Company to
retain) all books and records with respect to Tax matters relating to the
Company relating to any taxable period beginning before the date hereof until
the expiration of the statute of limitations (and, to the extent notified by
Seller, any extensions thereof) of the respective taxable periods, and abide
by all record retention agreements entered into with any taxing authority,
and (B) give the other party reasonable written notice prior to destroying or
discarding any such books and records and, if the other Party so requests,
allow the other party to take possession of such books and records. For those
Taxes for which the Company is deemed to continue as the same state Law entity
after the consummation of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, the
Company will not, and Buyer will not cause or allow the Company to, file any
amended Tax Returns for periods ending on or before the date hereof unless
required by Law; and if required by Law, Buyer will provide advance notice to
Seller of such filing and at least ten days to review and comment on (but not
approve) such filing.

Company directly related to the operations, activities or assets of the
Company for any taxable period or any portion of any taxable period ending

5.4 _Audited Financials_. Seller shall use commercially reasonable efforts to
provide or to cooperate with Buyer as it may reasonably request from Seller
in Buyers preparation of the financial statements necessary for Buyer to
timely meet its disclosure and filing requirements pursuant to the Securities
Act and the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, and to provide
direct access to the data required to prepare such financial statements for
auditing purposes. Data provided will be limited to such information that
Seller has readily available for up to three years prior to the year in which
the request is made and within the periods 2009 to 2012. All expenses for this
process, including the preparation of such financial statements, shall be
borne by Buyer; provided that Seller shall bear its internal costs concerning
the allocation of personnel to abide by its undertaking made in this _Section
5.4_.

5.5 _Expenses_. Each Party agrees to pay, without right of reimbursement from
any other Person (including the Company), the costs incurred by such party
incident to the preparation and execution of this Agreement and performance of
their respective obligations hereunder, including the fees and disbursements
of legal counsel, accountants and consultants employed by the respective
parties in connection with the transactions contemplated by this Agreement.
Buyer will be responsible for paying any and all sales taxes, transfer taxes,
stamp taxes and similar transfer (issuance) taxes that may be imposed by any
Governmental Authority as a result of the purchase and sale of the Interest
and issuance of the Consideration Units.

 

6\. _Indemnification_.

6.1 Sellers Indemnity. Subject to the provisions of this _Section 6_ ,
Seller, from and after the date hereof, will indemnify, defend and hold Buyer
and its partners, members, directors, officers, agents, employees,
representatives, successors and assigns, harmless from and against all damage,
loss, cost, obligation, claims, demands, assessments, judgments or liability
(whether based on contract, tort, product liability, strict liability or
otherwise), including taxes, and all expenses (including interest, penalties
and attorneys and accountants fees and disbursements) (collectively "
_Damages_ ") incurred in litigation or otherwise, and any investigation
relating thereto, by any of the above-named Persons, directly or indirectly,
resulting from or in connection with:

(a) any representation or warranty made by Seller in this Agreement or in any
Transaction Document not having been accurate and complete;

 

(b) any breach by Seller of any covenant or obligation made or undertaken in
this Agreement or in any Transaction Document; and

(c) any Action incident to any of the foregoing.

 

6.2 _Buyer s Indemnity_. Subject to the provisions of this _Section_ 6,
Buyer, from and after the date hereof, will indemnify, defend and hold Seller
and its partners, members, directors, officers, agents, employees,
representatives, successors and assigns, harmless from and against all Damages
incurred in litigation or otherwise, and any investigation relating thereto,
by any of the above-named Persons, directly or indirectly, resulting from or
in connection with:

 



19 (a) any representation or warranty made by Buyer in this Agreement or in
any Transaction Document not having been accurate and complete;

(b) any breach by Buyer of any covenant or obligation made or undertaken in
this Agreement or in any Transaction Document; and

(c) any Action incident to any of the foregoing.

6.3 Procedure. All claims for indemnification by Buyer or Seller under this
_Section_ 6 (the Party claiming indemnification and the Party against whom
such claims are asserted being the " _Indemnified Party_ " and the "
_Indemnifying Party_ ," respectively) must be asserted and resolved as
follows: 

(a) If any claim or demand for which an Indemnifying Party would be liable to
an Indemnified Party hereunder is asserted against or sought to be collected
from such Indemnified Party by a third party, such Indemnified Party will with
reasonable promptness give notice (the " _Claim Notice_ ") to the Indemnifying
Party of such claim or demand, specifying the nature of and specific basis
for such claim or demand and the amount or the estimated amount thereof to the
extent then feasible (which estimate will not be conclusive of the final
amount of such claim and demand). The Indemnifying Party will not be
obligated to indemnify the Indemnified Party under this Agreement with respect
to any such claim or demand if the Indemnified Party fails to notify the
Indemnifying Party thereof in accordance with the provisions of this
Agreement, and, as a result of such failure, the Indemnifying Partys ability
to defend against the claim or demand is materially prejudiced. The
Indemnifying Party will have ten days from the delivery or mailing of the
Claim Notice (the " _Notice Period_ ") to notify the Indemnified Party (i)
whether or not it disputes the liability of the Indemnifying Party to the
Indemnified Party hereunder with respect to such claim or demand, and (ii)
whether or not it desires, at the cost and expense of the Indemnifying Party,
to defend the Indemnified Party against such claim or demand; provided,
however, that any Indemnified Party is hereby authorized, but is not
obligated, prior to and during the Notice Period, to file any motion, answer
or other pleading that it deems necessary or appropriate to protect its
interests or those of the Indemnifying Party, subject to providing reasonable
advance notice to the Indemnifying Party of such action and a copy of any
documentation to be provided or submitted in connection therewith; provided,
that failure to deliver any such notice shall not be deemed a breach hereunder
except to the extent the Indemnifying Partys ability to defend against
the claim or demand is materially prejudiced. If the Indemnifying Party
notifies the Indemnified Party within the Notice Period that it desires to
defend the Indemnified Party against such claim or demand, the Indemnifying
Party will, subject to the last sentence of this paragraph, have the right to
control the defense against the claim by all appropriate proceedings and any
settlement negotiations and the Indemnified Party shall not compromise or
settle the claim without the Indemnifying Partys prior written consent. If
the Indemnified Party desires to participate in, but not control, any such
defense or settlement, it may do so at its sole cost

 



20  and expense. If the Indemnifying Party fails to respond to the Indemnified
Party within the Notice Period, elects not to defend the Indemnified Party, or
after electing to defend fails to commence or reasonably pursue such defense,
then the Indemnified Party may, but is not required to, undertake or continue
the defense of, and compromise or settle (exercising reasonable business
judgment), the claim or other matter all on behalf, for the account and at
the risk of the Indemnifying Party.

(b) If requested by the Indemnifying Party, the Indemnified Party agrees, at
the Indemnifying Partys expense, to cooperate with the Indemnifying Party and
its counsel in contesting any claim or demand that the Indemnifying Party
elects to contest.

 

(c) If any Indemnified Party has a claim against the Indemnifying Party
hereunder that does not involve a claim or demand being asserted against or
sought to be collected from it by a third party, the Indemnified Party will
send a Claim Notice with respect to such claim to the Indemnifying Party. If
the Indemnifying Party disputes such claim, such dispute will be resolved by
litigation in an appropriate court of competent jurisdiction.

6.4 _Time Limitations on Certain Obligations_.

Qualification), _3.3_ (Authority; Binding Effect), and _3.10_ (Tax Returns and
Tax Audits), may be made at any time.

(b) Buyer will have no liability for indemnification under this Agreement

for indemnification for the total of all Damages in excess of the Basket.
Subject to the last sentence of this  _Section 6.5(a_ ), Sellers aggregate

__3.3 (Authority; Binding Effect), and 3.10 (Tax Returns and Tax Audits);
provided that the first sentence of this Section 6.5(a) shall apply with
respect to any breach of any of Sellers representations and warranties
contained in _Section 3.10_ (Tax Returns and Tax Audits).

(b) Subject to the last sentence of this _Section 6.5(b_ ), Buyer will have no
liability for indemnification under _Section 6.2(a_ ) until the total of all
Damages with respect to such matters exceeds the Basket, and once such amount
has been exceeded, Buyer will be liable for indemnification for the total of
all Damages in excess of the Basket. Subject to the last sentence of this
_Section 6.5(b_ ), Buyers aggregate liability under _Section 6.2(a_ ) (but
excluding any liability for breach of any of Buyers representations and
warranties contained in  _Sections 4.1_ (Organization), _4.2_ (Due
Qualification) and _4.3_ (Authority; Binding Effect)) is limited to
$15,750,000. Notwithstanding the foregoing, this _Section 6.5(b_ ) will not
apply to any breach of any of Buyers representations and warranties
contained in _Sections 4.1_ (Organization), _4.2_ (Due Qualification) and
_4.3_ (Authority; Binding Effect).

(c) The Parties have agreed upon the amount of the Basket as a means of
applying a materiality standard to the amount of any claim that Buyer may have
against Seller, or that Seller may have against Buyer, resulting from a
breach of Sellers or Buyers representations and warranties, as the case may
be. Therefore, for purposes of determining whether any breach of the
representations or warranties of Seller or Buyer, as the case may be, has
occurred and for purposes of calculating the dollar amount of Damages to which
Buyer or Seller, as the case may be, is entitled to indemnification (including
the amounts needed to reach the Basket), each of Sellers and
Buyers representations and warranties that contain any qualification as to
materiality will be deemed and interpreted to be a representation or warranty
as to such items made without such qualification.

 

6.6 _Waiver of Punitive Damages_. No Party will be liable to another party for
any consequential, indirect, incidental, punitive, exemplary, special or
other similar damages or lost profits resulting from or arising out of this
Agreement or the transactions contemplated by this Agreement.

6.7 Costs. If any Action is brought for the enforcement or interpretation of
any of the rights or provisions of this Agreement (including the
indemnification provision), or because of an alleged dispute, breach, default
or misrepresentation in connection with any of the provisions of this
Agreement, the successful or prevailing party will be entitled to recover
reasonable attorneys fees and all other costs and expenses incurred in that
Action, in addition to any other relief to which it may be entitled.

 



22 6.8 _Exclusive Remedy_. Each Partys sole and exclusive remedy with respect to
all claims relating to the subject matter of this Agreement will be pursuant
to the indemnification provisions set forth in this _Section 6_.

7\. _Miscellaneous_.

7.1 _Choice of Law; Submission to Jurisdiction_. This Agreement shall be
subject to and governed by the Laws of the State of Delaware, excluding any
conflicts-of-law rule or principle that might refer the construction or

  _EXHIBIT C_

 

FORM OF CERTIFICATE OF NON-FOREIGN STATUS

MAY 14, 2012

Section 1445 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 provides that a transferee
of a U.S. real property interest must withhold tax if the transferor is a
foreign person. For U.S. tax purposes (including section 1445), the owner of a
disregarded entity (which has legal title to a U.S. real property interest
under local law) will be the transferor of the property and not the
disregarded entity. To inform the transferee that withholding of tax is not
required upon the disposition of a U.S. real property interest by Inergy,
L.P., a Delaware limited partnership (" _Transferor_ "), the undersigned
hereby certifies the following on behalf of Transferor:



     | (i) | Transferor is not a foreign corporation, foreign
partnership, foreign trust, or foreign estate (as those terms are defined in
the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 and Income Tax Regulations); 
---|---|--- 



     | (ii) | Transferor is not a disregarded entity as defined in Sec.
1.1445-2(b)(2)(iii); 
---|---|--- 
 



     | (iii) | Transferors U.S. Employer Identification Number is
43-1918951; and 
---|---|--- 



     | (iv) | Transferors office address is Two Brush Creek Boulevard,
Suite 200, Kansas City, Missouri 64112. 
---|---|--- 
 

Transferor understands that this certificate may be disclosed to the Internal
Revenue Service by the transferee and that any false statement contained
herein could be punished by fine, imprisonment or both.

Under penalties of perjury I declare that I have examined this certificate
and to the best of my knowledge and belief it is true, correct, and complete,
and I further declare that I have authority to sign this certificate on behalf
of Transferor.

 

IN WITNESS WHEREOF, the undersigned has duly executed this Certificate of Non-
Foreign Status as of the date first written above.
