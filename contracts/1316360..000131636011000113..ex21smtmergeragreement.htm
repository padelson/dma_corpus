(a) At least two (2) business days prior to the Closing Date, the Company

the Adjusted

Working Capital Amount (such statement, the "Estimated Working Capital
Statement" and the

calculation of the Adjusted Working Capital Amount as set forth in the
Estimated Working Capital

Statement, the "Estimated Adjusted Working Capital Amount") based on a balance
sheet that

the Company shall have prepared as an estimate of the Company's balance sheet
as of the Closing

Date (the "Closing Balance Sheet") and using the same methodology as in the
calculation of the

Adjusted Working Capital Target as described in Schedule 1(b). Such Estimated
Working Capital

Statement, subject to the approval of Parent (such approval not to be
unreasonably delayed,

conditioned or withheld), shall serve as the basis for the calculation of the
Adjusted Working

Capital Amount for purposes of calculating the Merger Consideration at
Closing.



(b) Within forty-five (45) days after the Closing Date, Parent may prepare and

deliver to the Securityholder Representative an updated statement of the
Adjusted Working Capital

Amount as of the Closing Date (the "Closing Working Capital Statement"), which
Closing

Working Capital Statement shall be prepared in accordance with GAAP as
consistently applied by

the Company together with reasonable supporting documentation and a written
explanation for any

variance from the Estimated Working Capital Statement. To the extent no
Closing Working

Capital Statement is delivered within such forty-five (45) day time period,
the Estimated Working















-12- 

Capital Statement shall be final and binding on the parties hereto, and the
Estimated Adjusted

Working Capital Amount shall be deemed to be the "Final Adjusted Working
Capital Amount."



(c) Following any delivery by Parent of the Closing Working Capital

Statement in accordance with Section 2.8(b), the Securityholder Representative
and his, her or its

representatives shall be given all such access as they may reasonably require
during Parent's

normal business hours (or such other times as the parties may agree) to those
books and records of

the Company and the Surviving Corporation in the possession of, and/or under
the control of,

Parent, and access to such personnel or representatives of the Company and
Parent as they may

reasonably require for the purposes of resolving any disputes or responding to
any matters or

inquiries raised concerning the Closing Working Capital Statement and/or the
calculation of the

Adjusted Working Capital Amount.



(d) The Securityholder Representative shall have thirty (30) days following

the date of delivery by Parent to the Securityholder Representative of the
Closing Working Capital

Statement to provide Parent with a written certificate confirming that
Parent's calculation of the

Adjusted Working Capital Amount as set forth in the Closing Working Capital
Statement is correct

(the "Confirmation Certificate") or notifying Parent in writing of any good
faith objections to

specific components of the calculation of the Adjusted Working Capital Amount
as set forth on the

Closing Working Capital Statement (a "Working Capital Dispute Notice"). If a
Confirmation

Certificate is delivered by or on behalf of the Securityholder Representative
pursuant to this

Section 2.8(d) or if within such thirty (30) day period no Confirmation
Certificate or Working

Capital Dispute Notice has been delivered by or on behalf of the
Securityholder Representative, the

Adjusted Working Capital Amount set forth in the Closing Working Capital
Statement shall be

deemed to be final and binding on the parties to this Agreement.



(e) If the Securityholder Representative shall object to all or a portion of
the

components of the Closing Working Capital Statement or Parent's calculation of
the Adjusted

Working Capital Amount as reflected in the Working Capital Dispute Notice, a
representative of

Parent, on the one hand, and the Securityholder Representative, on the other,
shall negotiate with

one another and attempt in good faith to resolve any such objection within
twenty (20) days of the

receipt by Parent of the Working Capital Dispute Notice.



(f) If Parent and the Securityholder Representative shall be unable to resolve

any such dispute within such twenty (20) day period, Parent and the
Securityholder Representative

(either together or separately) shall be entitled to submit the dispute to the
Independent Auditor.

Each of the parties to this Agreement shall, and shall cause their respective
officers, directors,

employees, and representatives to, provide full cooperation to the Independent
Auditor. The

Independent Auditor shall (i) act in its capacity as an expert and not as an
arbitrator, (ii) consider

only those matters as to which there is a dispute between the parties and
(iii) be instructed to reach

its conclusions regarding any such dispute within thirty (30) days after its
appointment and provide

a written explanation of its decision. In the event that Parent and the
Securityholder Representative

shall submit any dispute to the Independent Auditor, each such party may
submit a "position

paper" to the Independent Auditor setting forth the position of such party
with respect to such

dispute, to be considered by such Independent Auditor as it deems fit. All
fees and expenses















-13- 



relating to the engagement of the Independent Auditor shall be paid 50% by the
Parent and 50% by

the Securityholder Representative.



(g) If the Securityholder Representative does not deliver a Working Capital

Dispute Notice in accordance with the procedures set forth in Section 2.8(d)
above, the Closing

Working Capital Statement (together with Parent's calculation of the Adjusted
Working Capital

Amount) shall be deemed to have been accepted by all of the parties to this
Agreement. In the

event that the Securityholder Representative delivers a Working Capital
Dispute Notice in

accordance with the provisions above and Parent and the Securityholder
Representative are able to

resolve such dispute by mutual agreement, the Closing Working Capital
Statement, together with

the calculation of the Adjusted Working Capital Amount, to the extent modified
by the mutual

agreement of such parties, shall be deemed to have been accepted by all of the
parties to this

Agreement. In the event that the Securityholder Representative delivers a
Working Capital Dispute

Notice in accordance with the provisions set forth above and Parent and the
Securityholder

Representative are unable to resolve such dispute by mutual agreement, the
determination of the

Independent Auditor shall be final and binding on the parties to this
Agreement, together with the

calculation of the Adjusted Working Capital Amount, to the extent modified by
the Independent

Auditor, shall be deemed to have been accepted by all of the parties to this
Agreement. The

Adjusted Working Capital Amount as finally determined pursuant to this Section
2.8(g) shall be

referred to herein as the "Final Adjusted Working Capital Amount."



(h) In the event that it is determined that (i) the Final Adjusted Working

Capital Amount is less than the Estimated Adjusted Working Capital Amount (the
"Shortfall

Amount"), Parent and the Securityholder Representative shall instruct the
Escrow Agent to

promptly (but in no event more than five (5) business days following the
determination of the Final

Adjusted Working Capital Amount) release from the Escrow Fund and deliver to
Parent an amount

in cash equal to the Shortfall Amount, and (ii) the Final Adjusted Working
Capital Amount

exceeds the Estimated Adjusted Working Capital Amount (the "Excess Amount"),
Parent shall

promptly (but in no event more than five (5) business days following the
determination of the Final

Adjusted Working Capital Amount) pay to the Company Securityholders an amount
of cash equal

to the Excess Amount in accordance with their respective Pro Rata Portions in
accordance with

Section 2.9. In addition to the definition in the previous sentence, the
Shortfall Amount or Excess

Amount shall additionally include any amount by which the actual amounts of
items (A) through

(G) in the definition of Merger Consideration exceed or fall short of,
respectively, the amounts

deducted to determine the Merger Consideration at Closing; provided, however,
no amounts shall

be included in the Shortfall Amount or Excess Amount pursuant to this sentence
if such amounts

have already been accounted for in the Final Adjusted Working Capital Amount.



2.9 Surrender of Certificates.

this Agreement, Parent shall mail to each holder of record (as of the date
hereof) of a certificate or

certificates or an instrument or instruments (the "Certificates"), which

Company) and (B) instructions for use in effecting the surrender of the
Certificates in exchange for

cash constituting the Merger Consideration (less amounts of cash to be
deposited in the Escrow

Fund and the Representative Reimbursement Amount with respect to such Company

Securityholder in accordance with ARTICLE 8); provided, however, that Parent
shall be entitled to

rely upon, and shall rely upon, information provided by the Company regarding
Company Options

which are being converted into the right to receive Merger Consideration as

Upon surrender of

letter of transmittal, duly

completed and validly executed in accordance with the instructions thereto,
the holder of record of

such Certificates shall be entitled to receive at the Effective Time in
exchange therefor the amount

of cash constituting the Merger Consideration to which such holder is entitled

exchange therefor its

Closing Consideration, and the Certificates so surrendered shall forthwith be
cancelled. Until so

surrendered, outstanding Certificates will be deemed from and after the
Effective Time, for all

corporate purposes, to evidence the right to receive the Merger Consideration
into which such

securities shall have been so converted.

Surviving Corporation shall be entitled to deduct and withhold from any
consideration payable or

otherwise deliverable pursuant to this Agreement to any holder or former
holder of Company

Capital Stock or Company Options such amounts as may be required to be
deducted or withheld

therefrom under the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended the ("Code"). To
the extent such

amounts are so deducted or withheld and remitted to the appropriate

paid to the Person to whom such consideration would otherwise have been paid.



(c) No Liability. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Section

abandoned property, escheat or similar law.



2.10 No Further Ownership Rights in Company Capital Stock. All cash paid upon
the

of all rights pertaining

be no further

registration of transfers on the records of the Surviving Corporation of
shares of Company Capital

Stock or Company Options which were outstanding immediately prior to the

shall have been

lost, stolen or destroyed, the Parent shall transfer in exchange for such
lost, stolen or destroyed

Certificates, upon the making of an affidavit of that fact by the holder
thereof, such amount of cash

constituting the Merger Consideration; provided, however, that the Parent may,
in its discretion and

as a condition precedent to the issuance thereof, require the Person who is
the owner of such lost,

stolen or destroyed Certificates to provide an indemnification agreement in a
form and substance

reasonably acceptable to the Parent against Parent with respect to the
Certificates alleged to have

been lost, stolen or destroyed.

Company Securityholders hereunder, and any other applicable numbers or
amounts, shall be

adjusted to reflect appropriately the effect of any stock split, reverse stock
split, stock dividend

respect to Company

Capital Stock occurring or having a record date on or after the date hereof

Employee Plan has been established and maintained in accordance with its terms
and in

compliance with all applicable Legal Requirements, including but not limited

Code. Any Company Employee Plan intended to be qualified under Section 401(a)
of the Code is

subject to a favorable determination, notification, advisory and/or opinion
letter, as applicable, as to

its qualified status from the IRS and to the Company's Knowledge, nothing has
occurred that is

likely to adversely affect such qualified status. No "prohibited transaction,"
within the meaning of

Section 4975 of the Code or Sections 406 and 407 of ERISA, and not otherwise
exempt under

Section 408 of ERISA, has occurred with respect to any Company Employee Plan.
There are no

current actions, suits or claims pending, or, to the Knowledge of the Company,
threatened or

reasonably anticipated (other than routine claims for benefits) against any
Company Employee

Plan or against the assets of any Company Employee Plan. There are no audits,
inquiries or

proceedings pending or, to the Knowledge of the Company, threatened by any
Governmental

Entity with respect to any Company Employee Plan. Neither the Company nor any
ERISA

Affiliate is subject to any penalty or tax with respect to any Company

welfare benefits to any

person for any reason, except as may be required by COBRA or other applicable
Legal

Requirements.



(f) Effect of Transaction. Except as set forth on Section 3.12(f) of the

Company Disclosure Letter, the execution of this Agreement and the
consummation of the

transactions contemplated hereby will not (either alone or upon the occurrence
of any additional or

subsequent events) constitute an event under any Company Employee Plan or
Employee

Agreement or otherwise that will or may result in any payment (whether of
severance pay or

otherwise), acceleration, forgiveness of Indebtedness, vesting, distribution,
increase in benefits or

obligation to fund benefits with respect to any Employee. No payment or
benefit which will or

may be made by the Company or its ERISA Affiliates to any Employee will be
characterized as a

"parachute payment" within the meaning of Section 280G(b)(2) of the Code.



(g) Employment Matters. Neither the Company nor any of its Subsidiaries is

Requirements or collective

classification of employees,

consultants and independent contractors and the filings and withholdings
required therefor)

prohibited discrimination, equal employment, fair employment practices,
immigration status,

employee safety and health, and wages and hours, except for those conflicts,
defaults or violations

that, individually or in the aggregate, would not reasonably be expected to be
material to the

Company and its Subsidiaries, taken as a whole.

and complete list of all employees of the Company and the Subsidiaries,
including name, title, date

of hire, current base salary, date and amount of last increase and bonus or

negotiated by the

Company or any of its Subsidiaries. There is no labor dispute, strike or work
stoppage against the

Company or any of its Subsidiaries pending or, to the Knowledge of the
Company, threatened or

reasonably anticipated which may materially interfere with the respective
business activities of the

Company or any of its Subsidiaries. None of the Company, any of its
Subsidiaries or any of their

respective representatives or employees of the Company or its Subsidiaries has
committed any

material unfair labor practice in connection with the operation of the
respective businesses of the

Company or any of its Subsidiaries. There are no actions, suits, claims, or
proceedings pending, or,

to the Knowledge of the Company, threatened against the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries,

relating to any labor, safety or discrimination matters involving any employee
of the Company or

its Subsidiaries, including, without limitation, charges of material unfair
labor practices or

subleases, agreements for

the leasing, use or occupancy of the Leased Property, including all
amendments, terminations and

modifications thereof (the "Leases"). There is not, under any of the Leases,
any material default

by the Company or any of its Subsidiaries, nor, to the Knowledge of the
Company, by and other

party thereto. To the Knowledge of the Company, there are no other parties
occupying, or with a

right to occupy, the Leased Real Property other than the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries. The

Leased Real Property is in good operating condition (normal wear and tear
excepted).



3.14 Assets. With respect to the machinery, equipment, furniture, fixtures and
other

tangible property and assets purported to be owned, leased or used by the
Company or any of its

Subsidiaries which are material to the Company, the Company owns all such
assets free and clear

of all Liens, except Permitted Liens, and such assets are in good operating
condition (normal wear

and tear excepted). For purposes of clarity, this Section 3.15 does not relate
to real property (such

items being the subject of Section 3.13) or Intellectual Property Rights (such
items being solely the

subject of Section 3.8).

Environmental Laws.

The Parties agree that the only representations and warranties of the Company
in this Agreement

which relate to Environmental Laws or a Hazardous Material are those contained

except in each case (i) as enforcement may be limited by bankruptcy,
insolvency, fraudulent

conveyance, reorganization, moratorium and other laws affecting the rights of
creditors generally

and general equitable principles (whether considered in a proceeding in equity
or at law), and (ii) as

the remedy of specific performance and injunctive and other forms of equitable
relief may be

subject to equitable defenses and to the discretion of a court of competent
jurisdiction before which











-30- 



any proceeding may be brought. Neither the Company nor any of its Subsidiaries
has violated any

provision of, or committed or failed to perform any act which, with or without
notice, lapse of time

or both would constitute a material default under the provisions of, any
Company Material Contract

or give rise to a material liability of the Company or its Subsidiaries under
any material Contract.

The Company and its Subsidiaries have never been suspended or debarred from
bidding on

contracts or subcontracts for or with any Governmental Entity and no
suspension or debarment

actions have been commenced or, to the Knowledge of the Company, threatened

and its

Subsidiaries do not have in effect and are not required to have in effect any
security clearances in

connection with the operation of its business. Each Contract granting any
Third Party the right to

distribute Company Products or services is terminable by the Company on no
more than thirty (30)

days notice without liability or financial obligation of the Company or any of
its Subsidiaries.



3.17 Insurance. The Company maintains insurance of the type and in amounts

customarily carried by organizations conducting businesses or owning assets
similar to those of the

Company and in a similar stage of development. All premiums due and payable
under all such

policies have been paid, and the Company is otherwise in compliance in all
material respects with

the terms of such policies. The Company has no Knowledge of any threatened
termination of, or

premium increase with respect to, any such policy, except in accordance with
the terms thereof.



3.18 Absence of Certain Commercial Practices, Related Parties. None of the
Company,

its Subsidiaries, their respective directors, officers or employees, nor to
the Company's

Knowledge, its stockholders or agents, in each case acting on the Company's
behalf, have (a) given

or agreed to give any gift or similar benefit of more than nominal value to
any customer, supplier

or governmental employee or official or any other Person which is, or could
reasonably be

expected to be, in a position to materially help or materially hinder the
Company or its Subsidiaries

or assist the Company or its Subsidiaries in connection with any proposed
transaction, which gift or

similar benefit, if not given in the past, could reasonably be expected to
have adversely affected the

assets, business, prospects, condition (financial or otherwise) or results or
operations of the

Company or its Subsidiaries, or which, if not continued in the future, could
reasonably be expected

to adversely affect the assets, business, prospects, condition (financial or
otherwise) or results or

operations of the Company or its Subsidiaries, or (b) used any corporate or
other funds for unlawful

contributions, payments, gifts or entertainment, or made any unlawful
expenditures relating to

political activity to government officials or otherwise or established or
maintained any unlawful or

unrecorded funds. None of the Company, its Subsidiaries, their respective
directors, officers or

employees, nor to the Company's Knowledge, its stockholders or agents, in each
case acting on the

Company's behalf, have accepted or received any unlawful contributions,
payments, gifts or

expenditures. The rights, property and assets of the Company and its
Subsidiaries include all

rights, properties and other assets necessary for the conduct of the business
of the Company and its

Subsidiaries as conducted by the Company and its Subsidiaries as of the date
hereof and during the

past six months. Except as set forth in Section 3.18 of the Company Disclosure
Letter, the

Company's Knowledge, no officer or director of the Company or its Subsidiaries
(a) has any direct

or indirect interest in any material asset (including Intellectual Property)
used in the business of the

Company or its Subsidiaries; (b) is indebted to the Company or its
Subsidiaries; (c) is a party to

any Contract, transaction or business dealing involving the Company or its

employment, service as a

director, or ownership interest in the Company or the Subsidiaries) or that
competes directly with

the Company or its Subsidiaries; and (d) has any claim or right against the
Company or its

Subsidiaries (other than the Company Securityholders' rights under this
Agreement or rights to

receive compensation for services performed as an employee, director or
service provider of the

Company or its Subsidiaries).

and

warranties contained in this ARTICLE 3 (as modified by the Company Disclosure
Letter) or

contained in any certificate delivered by the Company pursuant to this

forecast regarding future

results or activities or the probable success or profitability of the Company

exceptions as are specifically identified in the disclosure letter (which
shall deemed to be the case

subsection, paragraph and

subparagraph numbers hereof or if the applicability or relevance of the

its business as now

which the nature of its business or the ownership or leasing of its properties
makes such

reasonably be expected to be material to Parent and its Subsidiaries, taken as
a whole.

proceedings

pending or, to the Knowledge of Parent, threatened against Parent or any of
its Subsidiaries, before

any court, governmental department, commission, agency, instrumentality or

(a) Subject to the terms and limitations contained in this Article 8, the
Escrow

Fund shall be available to compensate each of the Indemnified Parties for any
Losses actually

suffered or incurred by each such Indemnified Party resulting from (i) any
breach of any

representation or warranty of the Company contained in this Agreement or any
certificate delivered

by the Company pursuant to this Agreement, (ii) any failure by the Company to
perform or comply

with any covenant of the Company contained in this Agreement prior to the
Closing Date, (iii) any

Shortfall Amount pursuant to Section 2.8(h) and (iv) any claim by any holder
of Dissenting Shares

claiming consideration due in connection with the Merger in excess of the Per
Share Amount

payable to such holder as provided for in this Agreement.



(b) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained herein, the Escrow

Fund shall not be available to compensate any of the Indemnified Parties for
any Losses, and no

Indemnified Party shall be entitled to recover from the Escrow Fund, unless
and until the

Indemnified Parties have incurred Losses in excess of $2,500,000 in the
aggregate (the

"Deductible Amount"), after which the Escrow Fund, subject to the terms of
this ARTICLE 8,

shall be available to compensate each of the Indemnified Parties for any such
Losses, and, subject

to the terms of this ARTICLE 8, the Indemnified Parties shall be entitled to
seek recovery for such

Losses that are in excess of the Deductible Amount in the aggregate. The
Indemnified Parties shall















-46- 

have the right to recover any Losses pursuant to Section 8.3(a)(iii) or
8.3(a)(iv) from the Escrow

Fund without regard to the Deductible Amount.



(c) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained herein: (i) no claim

for any Loss related to or arising from (A) the value or condition of any Tax
asset or attribute of the

Company or its Subsidiaries or (B) the ability of Parent, the Surviving
Corporation or their

affiliates to utilize such Tax asset or attribute following the Effective
Time, shall be subject to a

claim for recovery by any Indemnified Party hereunder; (ii) any Losses
recoverable from the

Escrow Fund hereunder shall be reduced in amount by any Tax benefits,
insurance proceeds,

indemnification payments, contribution payments or reimbursements realized by
any Indemnified

Party in connection with such Losses or any of the circumstances giving rise
thereto, and Parent

and the Indemnified Parties shall, as a condition to receiving any amounts
from the Escrow Fund,

use all reasonable efforts to realize such benefits, proceeds payments or
reimbursements, (iii) no

Losses shall be recoverable from the Escrow Fund hereunder that (A) constitute
punitive or special

damages or (B) could have been avoided through reasonable efforts to mitigate
such Losses which

were not taken by Parent, the Surviving Corporation and/or the Indemnified
Parties, and (iv) the

amount of any Loss subject to recovery under this ARTICLE 8 shall be
calculated net of any

amounts specifically accrued or reserved for in the Company Balance Sheet. The
calculation of

Losses shall not include Losses arising from a change in any applicable law or
accounting principle

following the Effective Time.



(d) All Claims for recovery for any Loss or Losses from the Escrow Fund

shall be made pursuant to and in accordance with, and be governed by the terms
of, this Agreement

and the Escrow Agreement.



8.4 Exclusive Remedy. Except with respect to Losses directly related to Fraud
in

connection with this Agreement and the transactions contemplated hereby,
recovery from the

Escrow Fund shall be the sole and exclusive remedy of the Indemnified Parties
for any Losses

suffered or incurred by any Indemnified Party in connection with this
Agreement and the

transactions contemplated hereby. Except for amounts recovered by an
Indemnified Party from the

Escrow Fund for any Losses suffered or incurred by any Indemnified Party and
except with respect

to Losses directly related to Fraud in connection with this Agreement and the
transactions

contemplated hereby, no Company Securityholder shall be liable to Parent, the
Surviving

Corporation or any Indemnified Party for any damages or other remedies arising
out of, in

connection with or related to this Agreement or the transactions contemplated
hereby or any

representation, warranty, covenant or agreement contained herein.



8.5 Distribution of Escrow Fund. Upon the Escrow Termination Date, the Escrow
Fund

(the "Escrow Release Amount") shall promptly (but in any event, within five
(5) business days)

be delivered to the Company Securityholders; provided, however, that the
Escrow Fund shall not

terminate with respect to any amount that is reasonably necessary (based on
the facts and

circumstances existing at the time) to satisfy any unsatisfied claims for
Losses specified in any

Officer's Certificate delivered to the Escrow Agent and the Securityholder
Representative on or

prior to the Escrow Termination Date and in accordance with the provisions of
this Article 8. As

soon as all such claims have been resolved, the Escrow Agent shall immediately
deliver the













-47-



remaining portion of the Escrow Release Amount not required to satisfy such
claims to the

Company Securityholders. Deliveries from the Escrow Fund to the Company
Securityholders

pursuant to this Section 8.5 and the Escrow Agreement shall be made in
proportion to their

respective Pro Rata Portion of the remaining Escrow Amount, with each amount
rounded to the

nearest whole cent ($0.01).



8.6 Securityholder Representative.



(a) By virtue of the approval and adoption of this Agreement by the requisite

consent of the Company Securityholders, each of the Company Securityholders
(other than such

Company Securityholders, if any, who have perfected appraisal rights under
Delaware) shall be

deemed to have agreed to appoint Technology Crossover Management VI, L.L.C., a
Delaware

limited liability company, as its agent and attorney-in-fact (the
"Securityholder Representative")

for and on behalf of the Company Securityholders to give and receive notices
and communications,

to authorize payment to any Indemnified Party from the Escrow Fund in
satisfaction of claims by

any Indemnified Party, to object to such payments, to agree to, negotiate,
enter into settlements and

compromises of, and comply with orders of courts with respect to such claims,
to assert, negotiate,

enter into settlements and compromises of, and comply with orders of courts
with respect to, any

other claim by any Indemnified Party against any Company Securityholder or by
any such

Company Securityholder against any Indemnified Party or any dispute between
any Indemnified

Party and any such Company Securityholders, in each case relating to this
Agreement or the

transactions contemplated hereby, and to take all other actions that are
either (i) necessary or

appropriate in the judgment of the Securityholder Representative for the
accomplishment of the

foregoing or (ii) specifically mandated by the terms of this Agreement or the
Escrow Agreement.

Such agency may be changed by the Company Securityholders with the right to a
majority of the

Pro Rata Portions of the Escrow Fund from time to time. Notwithstanding the
foregoing, the

Securityholder Representative may resign at any time by providing written
notice of intent to

resign to the Company Securityholders, which resignation shall be effective
upon the earlier of

(A) thirty (30) calendar days following delivery of such written notice or (B)
the appointment of a

successor by the holders of a majority in interest of the Escrow Fund. No bond
shall be required of

the Securityholder Representative, and the Securityholder Representative shall
not receive any

compensation for its services.



(b) The Securityholder Representative shall not be liable for any act done or

omitted hereunder as Securityholder Representative while acting in good faith,
even if such act or

omission constitutes negligence on the part of such Securityholder
Representative. The

Securityholder Representative shall only have the duties expressly stated in
this Agreement and

shall have no other duty, express or implied. The Securityholder
Representative may engage

attorneys, accountants and other professionals and experts. The Securityholder
Representative may

in good faith rely conclusively upon information, reports, statements and
opinions prepared or

presented by such professionals, and any action taken by the Securityholder
Representative based

on such reliance shall be deemed conclusively to have been taken in good
faith. The Company

Securityholders shall indemnify the Securityholder Representative and hold the
Securityholder

Representative harmless against any loss, liability or expense incurred on the
part of the

Securityholder Representative (so long as the Securityholder Representative
was acting in good













-48-



faith in connection therewith) and arising out of or in connection with the
acceptance or

administration of the Securityholder Representative's duties hereunder,
including the reasonable

fees and expenses of any legal counsel retained by the Securityholder
Representative and travel

expenses ("Securityholder Representative Expenses"). The Representative
Reimbursement

Fund shall be available to reimburse the Securityholder Representative
Expenses actually incurred

by the Securityholder Representative promptly following the Securityholder
Representative's

delivery to the Escrow Agent of a certificate setting forth such
Securityholder Representative

Expenses actually incurred. Upon the Escrow Termination Date, the balance of
the Representative

Reimbursement Fund shall promptly be delivered to the Company Securityholders,
except with

respect to any amount necessary to satisfy any pending certified requests made
by the

Securityholder Representative for Securityholder Representative Expenses. As
soon as all such

Securityholder Representative Expenses have been properly paid, the Escrow
Agent shall

immediately deliver the remaining portion of the Representative Reimbursement
Amount to the

Company Securityholders. Deliveries from the Representative Reimbursement Fund
to the

Company Securityholders pursuant to this Section 8.6(b) and the Escrow
Agreement shall be made

in proportion to their respective Pro Rata Portion of the remaining
Representative Reimbursement

Amount, with each amount rounded to the nearest whole cent ($0.01). A
decision, act, consent or

instruction of the Securityholder Representative, including an amendment,
extension or waiver of

this Agreement pursuant to Sections 9.4 or 9.5 hereof, shall constitute a
decision of the Company

Securityholders and shall be final, binding and conclusive upon the Company
Securityholders.



(c) From and after the Effective Time, Parent shall cause Surviving

Corporation to provide the Securityholder Representative with reasonable
access to information

about the Surviving Corporation solely for purposes of performing its duties
and exercising its

rights under this Agreement.



8.7 Third-Party Claims. In the event that an Indemnified Party becomes aware
of a third

party claim (a "Third Party Claim") that the Indemnified Party reasonably
believes may result in

a demand against the Escrow Fund or for other indemnification pursuant to this
ARTICLE 8,

Parent shall promptly notify the Securityholder Representative of such claim
(but the failure to so

notify the Securityholder Representative shall not adversely affect the
Indemnified Parties right to

indemnification or compensation pursuant to this ARTICLE 8 except to the
extent such failure

materially prejudices the Securityholder Representative). The Securityholder
Representative may,

at his, her or its election and expense, undertake and conduct the defense of
such Third Party

Claim. Parent shall be entitled, to participate in, but not to determine or
conduct, the defense of

such Third Party Claim. If the Securityholder Representative undertakes the
defense of the Third

Party Claim, the Securityholder Representative shall obtain the prior written
consent of the

Indemnified Party (which shall not be unreasonably delayed, conditioned or
withheld) before

settling such claim. If the Securityholder Representative does not so elect to
undertake and conduct

the defense of such Third Party Claim, Parent shall undertake the defense of
and use all reasonable

efforts to defend such claim and shall consult with the Securityholder
Representative regarding the

strategy for defense of such claim, including with respect to Parent's choice
of legal counsel,

provided however, that Parent shall have the right in its reasonable
discretion to settle any such

claim; provided, further, that except with the prior written consent of the
Securityholder

Representative, which consent shall not be unreasonably delayed or withheld,
no settlement of any















-49- 



such Third Party Claim with third party claimants shall be determinative of
any Losses relating to

such matter.



8.8 No Other Representations and Warranties.



(a) Each of the Parent and Merger Sub acknowledges and agrees that it has

made its own inquiry and investigation into, and, based thereon, including the
representations and

warranties of the Company in this Agreement and any certificate delivered by
the Company

pursuant to this Agreement has formed an independent judgment concerning, the
Company and its

businesses and operations, and Parent and Merger Sub have been furnished with
or given full

access to such information about the Company and its businesses and operations
as they requested.

In connection with Parent's and Merger Sub's investigation of the Company and
its businesses and

operations, Parent, Merger Sub and their respective representatives have
received from the

Company or its representatives certain projections and other forecasts for the
Company and certain

estimates, plans and budget information. Parent and Merger Sub acknowledge and
agree that

(i) there are uncertainties inherent in attempting to make such projections,
forecasts, estimates,

plans and budgets; (ii) Parent and Merger Sub are familiar with such
uncertainties; and (iii) Parent

and Merger Sub are taking full responsibility for making their own evaluations
of the adequacy and

accuracy of all estimates, projections, forecasts, plans and budgets so
furnished to them or their

representatives.



(b) Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, the Indemnified Parties

shall have no claim or right to recovery pursuant to this ARTICLE 8 or
otherwise, and none of the

Indemnified Parties or any other person shall have or be subject to any
liability to Merger Sub,

Parent, the Indemnified Parties or any other person, with respect to (i)
except with respect to any

information, documents or materials included or referred to on the Company
Disclosure Letter, any

information, documents or materials furnished, delivered or made available by
the Company or its

affiliates, officers, directors, employees, agents or advisors to Parent or
Merger Sub, in certain

"data rooms", management presentations or any other form in contemplation of
the transactions

contemplated hereby or (ii) with respect to any projections, forecasts,
estimates, plans or budgets of

future revenue, expenses or expenditures, future results of operations (or any
component thereof),

future cash flows (or any component thereof) or future financial condition (or
any component

thereof) of the Company or the future business, operations or affairs of the
Company heretofore or

hereafter delivered to or made available to Parent, Merger Sub or their
respective representatives or

affiliates.



8.9 Subrogation. Except as provided in the next sentence, to the extent that
any

Indemnified Party is entitled to indemnification pursuant to this ARTICLE 8,
the Securityholder

Representative shall be entitled to exercise, and shall be subrogated to, any
rights and remedies

(including rights of indemnity, rights of contribution and other rights of
recovery) that any

Indemnified Party may have against any other Person with respect to any
Losses, circumstances or

matter to which such indemnification is directly or indirectly related. No
Company Securityholder

shall have any right of contribution, right of indemnity, or other right or
remedy against the

Surviving Corporation, Company or any Subsidiary of the Company in connection
with any

obligation of a Company Securityholder to indemnify any Indemnified Party in
connection with













-50- 



this Agreement or the transactions contemplated hereby or any right of an
Indemnified Party under

ARTICLE 8. The Indemnified Parties shall permit the Securityholder
Representative to use the

name of the Indemnified Party in any transaction or in any proceeding or other
matter involving

any such rights or remedies, and the Indemnified Party shall take such actions
as the Securityholder

Representative may reasonably request for the purpose of enabling the
Securityholder

Representative to perfect or exercise the right of subrogation of the
Indemnified Party under this

Section 8.9, unless in the reasonable judgment of Parent, such action could
have a material adverse

effect on the Surviving Corporation or the Company or its Subsidiaries.



ARTICLE 9.

Parent and the Company;



(b) by either the Company or Parent if the Merger shall not have been

consummated on or before the sixtieth (60th) day after the date of this
Agreement (the "End

Date"); provided, that, if the Closing shall have not occurred solely due to
the non-satisfaction of

the condition contained in Section 7.1(c), the End Date shall be extended to
the date that is two

hundred ten (210) days after the date of this Agreement; and provided,
however, that the right to

terminate this Agreement under this Section 9.1(b) shall not be available to
any party whose action

or failure to act (including the failure to act in compliance with Section
6.5) has been a principal

cause of or resulted in the failure of the Merger to occur on or before such
date and such action or

failure to act constitutes a breach of this Agreement;



(c) by either the Company or Parent if a Governmental Entity shall have

issued an order, decree or ruling or taken any other action (including the
failure to have taken an

action), in any case having the effect of permanently restraining, enjoining
or otherwise prohibiting

the Merger, which order, decree, ruling or other action is final and
nonappealable;



(d) by the Company, upon a breach of any representation, warranty, covenant

or agreement on the part of Parent set forth in this Agreement, or if any
representation or warranty

of Parent shall have become untrue, in either case such that the conditions
set forth in

Section 7.2(a) or Section 7.2(b) would not be satisfied as of the time of such
breach or as of the

time such representation or warranty shall have become untrue, provided that
the Company may

not terminate this Agreement under this Section 9.1(d) prior to thirty (30)
days following the

receipt of written notice by Parent from the Company of such breach (it being

-51- 



(e) by Parent, upon a breach of any representation, warranty, covenant or

agreement on the part of the Company set forth in this Agreement, or if any
representation or

warranty of the Company shall have become untrue, in either case such that the
conditions set forth

such breach or as of the

time such representation or warranty shall have become untrue, provided that
Parent may not

terminate this Agreement under this Section 9.1(e) prior to the thirty (30)
days following the

receipt of written notice by the Company from Parent of such breach (it being

9.2 Notice of Termination; Effect of Termination. Any termination of this
Agreement

under Section 9.1 will be effective immediately upon the delivery of a valid
written notice of the

shall survive the

termination of this Agreement and (b) if this Agreement is terminated by a
party because of the

breach of this Agreement by another party or because one or more of the
conditions to the

terminating party's obligations under this Agreement is not satisfied as a
result of the other party's

failure to comply with its obligations under this Agreement, then the
terminating party's right to

pursue all legal remedies will survive such termination unimpaired. No
termination of this

Agreement shall affect the obligations of the parties contained in the
Confidentiality Agreement, all

of which obligations shall survive termination of this Agreement in accordance
with their terms.

expenses whether or not

parties hereto, by action taken or authorized by their respective Boards of

10.2 Interpretation. When a reference is made in this Agreement to Exhibits,
such

reference shall be to an Exhibit to this Agreement unless otherwise indicated.
When a reference is

made in this Agreement to Sections, such reference shall be to a section of
this Agreement unless

otherwise indicated. For purposes of this Agreement, the words "include,"
"includes" and

"including," when used herein, shall be deemed in each case to be followed by
the words "without

limitation." The table of contents and headings contained in this Agreement
are for reference

purposes only and shall not affect in any way the meaning or interpretation of
this Agreement.

When reference is made herein to "the business of" an entity, such reference
shall be deemed to

include the business of all such entity and its Subsidiaries, taken as a
whole. An exception or

disclosure made in Company Disclosure Letter with regard to a representation
of the Company, or

in the Parent Disclosure Letter with regard to a representation of Parent or
Merger Sub, shall be

deemed made with respect to any other representation by such party to which
such exception or

disclosure is reasonably apparent. Any currency thresholds set forth herein
shall not be used as a

benchmark for the determination of what is or is not "material" or a "Material
Adverse Effect"

under this Agreement.



10.3 Counterparts. This Agreement may be executed in two or more counterparts,
all of

which shall be considered one and the same agreement and shall become
effective when one or

more counterparts have been signed by each of the parties and delivered to the
other party, it being

understood that all parties need not sign the same counterpart.



10.4 Entire Agreement; Third-Party Beneficiaries. This Agreement and the
documents

and instruments and other agreements among the parties hereto as contemplated
by or referred to

herein, including the Company Disclosure Letter and the Parent Disclosure
Letter (a) constitute the

entire agreement among the parties with respect to the subject matter hereof
and supersede all prior

agreements and understandings, both written and oral, among the parties with
respect to the subject

matter hereof, it being understood that the Confidentiality Agreement shall
continue in full force

and effect until the Closing and shall survive any termination of this
Agreement and (b) are not

intended to confer upon any other Person any rights or remedies hereunder
following the Effective

Time, except such provisions that act for the benefit of (i) the Company
Securityholders set forth in

ARTICLE 2, (ii) the Company Indemnified Parties set forth in Section 6.7, and
the Indemnified

Parties as set forth in ARTICLE 8.



10.5 Severability. In the event that any provision of this Agreement or the
application

thereof, becomes or is declared by a court of competent jurisdiction to be
illegal, void or

unenforceable, the remainder of this Agreement will continue in full force and
effect and the

application of such provision to other Persons or circumstances will be
interpreted so as reasonably

to effect the intent of the parties hereto. The parties further agree to
replace such void or

unenforceable provision of this Agreement with a valid and enforceable
provision that will achieve,

to the greatest extent possible, the economic, business and other purposes of
such void or

unenforceable provision.



















-55- 



10.6 Governing Law. This Agreement shall be governed by and construed in
accordance

with the laws of the State of Delaware regardless of the laws that might
otherwise govern under

applicable principles of conflicts of law thereof.



10.7 Waiver of Conflicts. The parties hereto (collectively, the "Consenting
Parties")

acknowledge that at all times relevant hereto up to the Closing, Wilson
Sonsini Goodrich and Rosati,

Professional Corporation ("Company Counsel") has represented only the Company.
If subsequent

to the Closing any dispute were to arise relating in any manner to this
Agreement or the Escrow

Agreement between the Securityholder Representative, on the one hand, and
another Consenting

Party, on the other hand (each a "Dispute"), the Consenting Parties consent to
Company Counsel's

representation of the Securityholder Representative in the Dispute(s). The
Consenting Parties

acknowledge that Company Counsel has been and will be providing legal advice
to the Company

in connection with the Merger and the other transactions contemplated by this
Agreement and the

Escrow Agreement and in such capacity will have obtained confidential
information of the

Company (the "Company Confidential Information"). The Company Confidential
Information

includes all communications, whether written or electronic, between Company
Counsel and the

directors, officers, stockholders, accounting firm, and/or employees of the
Company, all files,

attorney notes, drafts or other documents directly relating to this Agreement
or the Escrow

Agreement, which predate the Closing (collectively, the "Company Counsel Work
Product"). In

any Dispute, to the extent that any Company Confidential Information is in
Company Counsel's

possession at the Effective Time, such Company Confidential Information may be
used on behalf

of the Securityholder Representative and the Consenting Parties in connection
with such Dispute.

In any Dispute, the Consenting Parties waive the right to present any Company
Counsel Work

Product as evidence in any legal proceeding arising out of such Dispute. The
Consenting Parties

waive their right to access any Company Counsel Work Product, except as
reasonably necessary in

connection with a legal proceeding that is not a Dispute. The Consenting
Parties hereby consent to

the disclosure and use by Company Counsel for the benefit of the Company
Securityholders and

the Securityholder Representative in any action arising under this Agreement
of any information

(confidential or otherwise) disclosed to it by the Company (including its
directors, officers,

Company Securityholders, accounting firm, and/or employees of the Company)
prior to the

Effective Time. Except as expressly set forth above, this Section 10.7 shall
not grant any rights to

the Securityholder Representative with respect to the Company Confidential
Information except as

described herein.

IRREVOCABLY SUBMITS TO THE EXCLUSIVE JURISDICTION OF THE COURTS OF
