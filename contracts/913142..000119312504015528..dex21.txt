3.2(c)      AGREEMENT AND PLAN OF MERGER   THIS AGREEMENT AND PLAN OF
MERGER (this "Agreement") is made and entered into as of February 4, 2004, by
and among CABLE DESIGN TECHNOLOGIES CORPORATION, a Delaware corporation
("CDT"), BC MERGER CORP., a Delaware corporation and a direct wholly owned
subsidiary of CDT ("Merger Sub"), and BELDEN INC., a Delaware corporation
("Belden").   W I T N E S S E T H:   WHEREAS, the respective Boards of
Directors of CDT, Merger Sub and Belden have deemed it advisable and in the
best interests of their respective corporations and stockholders that CDT and
Belden engage in a business combination in order to advance their respective
long-term strategic business interests; and   WHEREAS, in furtherance
thereof, the Boards of Directors of each of CDT, Merger Sub and Belden have
approved this Agreement and the merger of Merger Sub with and into Belden
(the "Merger") so that Belden continues as the surviving corporation in the
Merger (sometimes referred to in such capacity as the "Surviving
Corporation"), upon the terms of and subject to the conditions set forth in
this Agreement and in accordance with the provisions of the Delaware General
Corporation Law (the "DGCL"); and   WHEREAS, the Board of Directors of
Belden has determined to recommend to its stockholders the approval and
adoption of this Agreement and the Merger; and   WHEREAS, the Board of
Directors of CDT has determined to recommend to its stockholders approval of
the CDT Charter Amendment (as defined in Section 1.7) and the issuance of
shares of CDT Common Stock (as defined in Section 2.1(a)) in connection with
the Merger (the "CDT Share Issuance"); and   WHEREAS, CDT, as the sole
stockholder of Merger Sub, has approved this Agreement and the Merger;
and   WHEREAS, for United States federal income tax purposes, it is intended
that the Merger shall qualify as a reorganization within the meaning of
Section 368(a) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the "Code"),
and this Agreement is intended to be, and is hereby, adopted as a plan of
reorganization within the meaning of Section 368 of the Code; and  
WHEREAS, the parties desire to make certain representations, warranties
and agreements in connection with the Merger and also to prescribe
certain conditions to the Merger.   NOW, THEREFORE, in consideration of the
foregoing and the mutual representations, warranties, covenants and
agreements set forth herein, and for other good and valuable consideration,
the receipt and sufficiency of which are hereby acknowledged, the parties
agree as follows:     ARTICLE I   THE MERGER   SECTION 1.1 The Merger.
Upon the terms of and subject to the conditions set forth in this Agreement,
and in accordance with the DGCL, at the Effective Time (as defined in Section
1.3), Merger Sub shall be merged with and into Belden, the separate corporate
existence of Merger Sub shall cease and Belden shall continue as the
Surviving Corporation in the Merger and shall succeed to and assume all the
property, rights, privileges, powers and franchises of Merger Sub in
accordance with the DGCL.   SECTION 1.2 Closing. The closing of the Merger
(the "Closing") shall take place at 10:00 a.m., New York time, on a date to
be specified by the parties, which shall be no later than the third business
day after satisfaction or waiver of all of the conditions set forth in
Article VII (other than delivery of items to be delivered at the Closing and
other than those conditions that by their nature are to be satisfied at the
Closing, it being understood that the occurrence of the Closing shall remain
subject to the delivery of such items and the satisfaction or waiver of such
conditions at the Closing) at the offices of Skadden, Arps, Slate, Meagher and
Flom LLP, Four Times Square, New York, NY 10036-6522, unless another time,
date or place is agreed to in writing by the parties hereto. The date on
which the Closing occurs is referred to herein as the "Closing Date."  
SECTION 1.3 Effective Time. Upon the terms of and subject to the
conditions of this Agreement, as soon as practicable on the Closing Date, the
parties shall cause the Merger to be consummated by filing a certificate of
merger executed in accordance with the relevant provisions of the DGCL (the
"Certificate of Merger") with the Secretary of State of the State of Delaware
(the "Secretary of State") and shall make all other filings or recordings
required under the DGCL. The Merger shall become effective at such time as
the Certificate of Merger is duly filed with the Secretary of State, or at
such subsequent date or time as Belden and CDT shall agree and specify in the
Certificate of Merger. The date and time at which the Merger becomes
effective as set forth in the Certificate of Merger is referred to herein as
the "Effective Time."   SECTION 1.4 Effects of The Merger. At the Effective
Time, the Merger shall have the effects set forth in this Agreement and in
the applicable provisions of the DGCL.   SECTION 1.5 Organizational
Documents of the Surviving Corporation. At the Effective Time, the Belden
Charter (as defined in Section 4.1(b)) shall be amended and restated in its
entirety to be identical to the certificate of incorporation of Merger Sub in
the form attached as Exhibit A hereto, and such amended Belden Charter shall
be the certificate of incorporation of the Surviving Corporation until
thereafter amended in accordance with the DGCL and as provided in such
certificate of incorporation; provided, however, that at the Effective Time,
Article I of the certificate of incorporation of the Surviving Corporation
shall be amended and restated in its entirety to read as follows: "The name
of the corporation is Belden Inc." After the Effective Time, the authorized
capital stock of the Surviving Corporation shall consist of 100 shares of
common stock, par value $.01 per share. At the Effective Time, the Belden By-
Laws (as defined in Section 4.1(b)) shall be amended and restated in their
entirety to be identical to the by-laws of Merger Sub, as in
effect immediately prior to the Effective Time,   2    in the form
attached as Exhibit B hereto and such by-laws shall be the by-laws of the
Surviving Corporation until thereafter amended in accordance with the DGCL
and as provided in such by-laws.   SECTION 1.6 Directors and Officers of the
Surviving Corporation. The initial directors of the Surviving Corporation
shall be the individuals designated as such on Schedule 1.6 hereto until
their respective successors are duly elected or appointed and qualified. The
initial officers of the Surviving Corporation shall be the individuals
designated as such on Schedule 1.6 hereto until their respective successors
are duly appointed.   SECTION 1.7 CDT Charter Amendment. Immediately prior
to the Effective Time, and upon the terms of and subject to the conditions
set forth in this Agreement and receipt of the CDT Charter Approval (as
defined in Section 3.3(c)), pursuant to the applicable provisions of the
DGCL, CDT shall cause the CDT Charter (as defined in Section 3.1(b)) to be
amended (the "CDT Charter Amendment") to change the name of CDT to "Belden
CDT Inc.," to increase the number of authorized shares of capital stock and
to provide for a reverse stock split of the shares of CDT Common Stock (the
"Reverse Stock Split") by filing a Certificate of Amendment substantially in
the form of Exhibit C hereto (the "CDT Certificate of Amendment") with the
Secretary of State in accordance with applicable provisions of the DGCL.  
SECTION 1.8 Alternative Structure. CDT and Belden may mutually agree
to revise the structure of the Merger provided for herein at any time prior
to receipt of either the Belden Stockholder Approval (as defined in Section
4.3(c)) or CDT Share Issuance Approval (as defined in Section 3.3(c)), or at
any time thereafter if, with appropriate disclosure, any required further
approval of the revised structure is obtained from the stockholders of CDT
and Belden, as applicable; provided, however, that under any such revised
structure the Merger would qualify as a reorganization within the meaning of
Section 368(a) of the Code or as a transfer qualifying under Section 351 of
the Code. CDT and Belden agree to consider in good faith the request of the
other party to revise the structure of the Merger from that set forth
herein.   ARTICLE II   EFFECTS OF THE MERGER; EXCHANGE OF CERTIFICATES  
SECTION 2.1 Effect on Capital Stock. Upon the terms and subject to
the conditions of this Agreement, at the Effective Time, by virtue of the
Merger and without any action on the part of CDT, Merger Sub, Belden or the
holders of any shares of common stock, par value $0.01 per share, of Belden
(together with any associated Belden Rights (as defined in Section 4.2(a)),
"Belden Common Stock"):   (a) Conversion of Belden Common Stock. Each share
of Belden Common Stock issued and outstanding immediately prior to the
Effective Time, other than any shares of Belden Common Stock to be canceled
pursuant to Section 2.1(c) shall automatically be converted into the right to
receive (i) 2.00 fully paid and nonassessable shares of common stock, par
value $0.01 per share, of CDT ("CDT Common Stock") if the Reverse Stock Split
has not been effected prior to the Effective Time, or (ii) 1.00 fully paid
and nonassessable share of CDT Common Stock if the Reverse Stock Split has
been effected prior to the Effective Time (in either case, the  
3    "Exchange Ratio") (the number of shares of CDT Common Stock set forth
in clause (i) or (ii), as applicable, together with the associated CDT Rights
(as defined in Section 3.2(a)), the "Merger Consideration") upon surrender of
the Certificate (as defined in Section 2.2(b)), which immediately prior to
the Effective Time represented such share of Belden Common Stock in the
manner provided in Section 2.2(b) (or, in the case of a lost, stolen or
destroyed Certificate, Section 2.2(h)). As a result of the Merger, at the
Effective Time, each holder of a Certificate shall cease to have any rights
with respect thereto, except the right to receive the Merger Consideration
payable in respect of the shares of Belden Common Stock represented by such
Certificate immediately prior to the Effective Time, any cash in lieu of
fractional shares payable pursuant to Section 2.1(e) and any dividends or
other distributions payable pursuant to Section 2.2(c), all to be issued or
paid, without interest, in consideration therefor upon the surrender of such
Certificate in accordance with Section 2.2(b) (or, in the case of a lost,
stolen or destroyed Certificate, Section 2.2(h)).   (b) Capital Stock of
Merger Sub. Each issued and outstanding share of common stock, par value
$0.01 per share, of Merger Sub shall be converted into one fully paid and
nonassessable share of common stock, par value $0.01 per share, of the
Surviving Corporation.   (c) Cancellation of Treasury Shares. Each share of
Belden Common Stock held as treasury stock by Belden, if any, shall
automatically be extinguished without any conversion, and no consideration
shall be delivered in respect thereof.   (d) Belden Options and Employee
Stock Purchase Plans. At the Effective Time, (i) all issued and outstanding
options to purchase Belden Common Stock under any Belden Stock Plan (as
defined in Section 4.2(a)) (each, a "Belden Option") shall be assumed by CDT
in accordance with Section 6.11(a), (ii) all shares of Belden Common Stock
issued pursuant to restricted stock grants under any Belden Stock Plan and
with respect to which restrictions have not lapsed, shall be treated as set
forth in Section 6.11(c), and (iii) all rights outstanding under Belden\'s
Employee Stock Purchase Plan and U.K. Share Ownership Plan, in each case as
amended to date (collectively, the "Belden Purchase Plans"), shall be treated
as set forth in Section 6.11(c).   (e) Fractional Shares. No fraction of a
share of CDT Common Stock will be issued by virtue of the Merger, but in lieu
thereof each holder of shares of Belden Common Stock who would otherwise be
entitled to receive a fraction of a share of CDT Common Stock (after
aggregating all fractional shares of CDT Common Stock that otherwise would be
received by such holder) shall, upon surrender of such holder\'s
Certificate(s), receive from CDT an amount of cash (rounded to the nearest
whole cent), without interest, equal to the product of: (i) such fraction,
multiplied by (ii) the average closing price of one share of CDT Common Stock
for the ten (10) most recent trading days that CDT Common Stock has traded
ending on the trading day one day prior to the Effective Time, as reported on
the New York Stock Exchange ("NYSE").   (f) Adjustments to Exchange Ratio.
The Exchange Ratio shall be adjusted to reflect fully the appropriate effect
of any stock split, reverse stock split (without duplication of the effects
on the Exchange Ratio contemplated by Section 2.2(a) as a result of the
Reverse Stock Split), stock dividend (including any dividend or distribution
of securities convertible into CDT Common Stock or Belden Common Stock),
reorganization, recapitalization, reclassification or   4    other like
change with respect to CDT Common Stock or Belden Common Stock having a
record date on or after the date hereof and prior to the Effective
Time. Notwithstanding the foregoing, no adjustment will be made to the
Exchange Ratio in respect of any Belden Dividends (as defined in Section
5.1(b)).   SECTION 2.2 Exchange of Shares and Certificates.   (a) Exchange
Agent. At or prior to the Effective Time, CDT shall engage Equiserve Trust
Company, N.A. (or such other institution reasonably satisfactory to Belden)
to act as exchange agent in connection with the Merger (the
"Exchange Agent"), pursuant to an agreement reasonably satisfactory to
Belden. Immediately prior to the Effective Time, CDT shall deposit with the
Exchange Agent, in trust for the benefit of the holders of shares of Belden
Common Stock, certificates representing the shares of CDT Common Stock
issuable pursuant to Section 2.1(a). In addition, CDT shall make available by
depositing with the Exchange Agent, as necessary from time to time after the
Effective Time as needed, cash in an amount sufficient to make the payments
in lieu of fractional shares pursuant to Section 2.1(e) and any dividends or
distributions to which holders of shares of Belden Common Stock may be
entitled pursuant to Section 2.2(c). All cash and CDT Common Stock deposited
with the Exchange Agent shall hereinafter be referred to as the "Exchange
Fund."   (b) Exchange Procedures. Promptly after the Effective Time, CDT
shall cause the Exchange Agent to mail to each holder of record of a
certificate or certificates that immediately prior to the Effective Time
represented outstanding shares of Belden Common Stock and that at the
Effective Time were converted into the right to receive the Merger
Consideration pursuant to Section 2.1 (the "Certificates"), (i) a letter of
transmittal (which shall specify that delivery shall be effected, and risk of
loss and title to the Certificates shall pass only upon delivery of the
Certificates to the Exchange Agent and shall be in such form and have such
other provisions as CDT and Belden may reasonably specify) and (ii)
instructions for use in effecting the surrender of the Certificates in
exchange for certificates representing whole shares of CDT Common Stock, cash
in lieu of any fractional shares pursuant to Section 2.1(e) and any dividends
or other distributions payable pursuant to Section 2.2(c). Upon surrender of
Certificates for cancellation to the Exchange Agent, together with such
letter of transmittal, duly completed and validly executed in accordance with
the instructions thereto, and such other documents as may reasonably be
required by the Exchange Agent, the holder of such Certificates shall be
entitled to receive in exchange therefor a certificate representing that
number of whole shares of CDT Common Stock (after taking into account
all Certificates surrendered by such holder) to which such holder is
entitled pursuant to Section 2.1 (which shall be uncertificated book entry
form unless a physical certificate is requested), payment in lieu of
fractional shares which such holder is entitled to receive pursuant to
Section 2.1(e) and any dividends or distributions payable pursuant to Section
2.2(c), and the Certificates so surrendered shall forthwith be canceled. In
the event of a transfer of ownership of Belden Common Stock which is not
registered in the transfer records of Belden, a certificate representing the
proper number of shares of CDT Common Stock may be issued to a Person (as
defined in Section 9.3(n)) other than the Person in whose name the
Certificate so surrendered is registered, if such Certificate shall be
properly endorsed or otherwise be in proper form for transfer and the Person
requesting such issuance shall pay any transfer or other taxes required by
reason of the issuance of shares of CDT Common Stock to a Person other than
the registered holder of such Certificate or establish to the reasonable 
5    satisfaction of CDT that such tax has been paid or is not applicable.
Until surrendered as contemplated by this Section 2.2(b), each Certificate
shall be deemed at any time after the Effective Time to represent only the
right to receive the Merger Consideration (and any amounts to be paid
pursuant to Section 2.1(e) or Section 2.2(c)) upon such surrender. No
interest shall be paid or shall accrue on any amount payable pursuant to
Section 2.1(e) or Section 2.2(c).   (c) Distributions with Respect to
Unexchanged Shares. No dividends or other distributions with respect to CDT
Common Stock with a record date after the Effective Time shall be paid to the
holder of any unsurrendered Certificate with respect to the shares of CDT
Common Stock represented thereby, and no cash payment in lieu of fractional
shares shall be paid to any such holder pursuant to Section 2.1(e), until
such Certificate has been surrendered in accordance with this Article II.
Subject to Applicable Law (as defined in Section 3.7(a)), following surrender
of any such Certificate, there shall be paid to the recordholder thereof,
without interest, (i) promptly after such surrender, the number of whole
shares of CDT Common Stock issuable in exchange therefor pursuant to this
Article II, together with any cash payable in lieu of a fractional share of
CDT Common Stock to which such holder is entitled pursuant to Section 2.1(e)
and the amount of dividends or other distributions with a record date after
the Effective Time theretofore paid with respect to such whole shares of CDT
Common Stock, and (ii) at the appropriate payment date, the amount of
dividends or other distributions with a record date after the Effective
Time and a payment date subsequent to such surrender payable with respect to
such whole shares of CDT Common Stock.   (d) No Further Ownership Rights in
Belden Common Stock. All shares of CDT Common Stock issued upon the surrender
for exchange of Certificates in accordance with the terms of this Article II
and any cash paid pursuant to Section 2.1(e) or Section 2.2(c) shall be
deemed to have been issued (and paid) in full satisfaction of all rights
pertaining to the shares of Belden Common Stock previously represented by
such Certificates. At the Effective Time, the stock transfer books of Belden
shall be closed and there shall be no further registration of transfers on
the stock transfer books of the Surviving Corporation of the shares of Belden
Common Stock which were outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time.
If, after the Effective Time, Certificates are presented to the Surviving
Corporation or the Exchange Agent for any reason, they shall be canceled and
exchanged as provided in this Article II.   (e) Termination of Exchange
Fund. Any portion of the Exchange Fund which remains undistributed to the
holders of Certificates six (6) months after the Effective Time shall be
delivered to CDT, upon demand, and any holders of Certificates who have not
theretofore complied with this Article II shall thereafter look only to CDT
for payment of their claim for the Merger Consideration, any cash in lieu of
fractional shares of CDT Common Stock pursuant to Section 2.1(e) and any
dividends or distributions pursuant to Section 2.2(c).   (f) No Liability.
None of CDT, Merger Sub, Belden or the Exchange Agent shall be liable to any
Person in respect of any shares of CDT Common Stock (or dividends or
distributions with respect thereto) or cash from the Exchange Fund delivered
to a public official pursuant to any applicable abandoned property, escheat
or similar law. If any Certificate shall not have been surrendered prior to
seven years after the Effective Time, or immediately prior to such
earlier date on which any shares of CDT Common Stock, any cash in lieu of
fractional shares of CDT Common Stock or any dividends or distributions with
respect to CDT Common   6    Stock issuable in respect of such
Certificate would otherwise escheat to or become the property of any
Governmental Entity (as defined in Section 3.3(e)), any such shares, cash,
dividends or distributions in respect of such Certificate shall, to the
extent permitted by Applicable Law, become the property of the Surviving
Corporation, free and clear of all claims or interest of any
Person previously entitled thereto.   (g) Withholding Rights. CDT or the
Exchange Agent shall be entitled to deduct and withhold from any
consideration payable pursuant to this Agreement to any Person who was a
holder of Belden Common Stock, options or other securities or rights
immediately prior to the Effective Time such amounts as CDT or the Exchange
Agent may be required to deduct and withhold with respect to the making of
such payment under the Code, or any provision of federal, state, local
or foreign tax law. To the extent that amounts are so withheld by CDT or
the Exchange Agent, such withheld amounts shall be treated for all purposes
of this Agreement as having been paid to the Person to whom such
consideration would otherwise have been paid.   (h) Lost, Stolen or
Destroyed Certificates. In the event any Certificates shall have been lost,
stolen or destroyed, the Exchange Agent shall issue in exchange for such
lost, stolen or destroyed Certificates, upon the making of an affidavit of
that fact by the holder thereof, such shares of CDT Common Stock as may be
required pursuant to Section 2.1(a), cash for fractional shares pursuant to
Section 2.1(e) and any dividends or distributions payable pursuant to
Section 2.2(c); provided, however, that CDT may, in its reasonable discretion
and as a condition precedent to the issuance thereof, require the owner of
such lost, stolen or destroyed Certificates to deliver an agreement of
indemnification in form reasonably satisfactory to CDT, or a bond in such sum
as CDT may reasonably direct as indemnity, against any claim that may be made
against CDT or the Exchange Agent in respect of the Certificates alleged to
have been lost, stolen or destroyed.   (i) Investment of Exchange Fund. The
Exchange Agent shall invest any cash included in the Exchange Fund as
directed by CDT on a daily basis provided that no such investment or loss
thereon shall affect the amounts payable to former stockholders of Belden
after the Effective Time pursuant to this Article II. Any interest and other
income resulting from such investment shall become a part of the Exchange
Fund, and any amounts in excess of the amounts payable pursuant to this
Article II shall promptly be paid to CDT.   ARTICLE III   REPRESENTATIONS
AND WARRANTIES OF CDT AND MERGER SUB   Except as set forth in the disclosure
schedule dated as of the date of this Agreement and delivered by CDT and
Merger Sub to Belden prior to the execution and delivery by CDT and Merger
Sub of this Agreement (the "CDT Disclosure Schedule"), each of CDT and Merger
Sub represents and warrants to Belden as set forth below. Each exception set
forth in the CDT Disclosure Schedule, and any other information included in
the CDT Disclosure Schedule, is identified by reference to, or has been
grouped under a heading referring to, a specific individual section or
subsection of this Agreement and shall be deemed to be disclosed solely for
purposes of such section or subsection, except to the extent that the
relevance of a disclosure in one section or subsection of the CDT Disclosure
Schedule to another section or subsection of the   7    CDT Disclosure
Schedule is reasonably apparent on its face. Inclusion of any information in
the CDT Disclosure Schedule shall not be construed as an admission that such
information is material to CDT or any of its Subsidiaries.   SECTION 3.1
Organization, Standing and Corporate Power; Charter
Documents; Subsidiaries.   (a) Organization, Standing and Corporate Power.
CDT is a corporation duly organized, validly existing and in good standing
under the laws of the State of Delaware, and has the requisite corporate
power and authority to carry on its business as currently conducted. Each
Subsidiary (as defined in Section 9.3(o)) of CDT is a corporation or other
legal entity duly organized, validly existing and in good standing (with
respect to jurisdictions that recognize such concept) under the laws of the
jurisdiction in which it is incorporated or otherwise organized, and has the
requisite corporate (or similar) power and authority to carry on its business
as currently conducted, except where the failure to be so organized, existing
or in good standing would not reasonably be likely to have a Material Adverse
Effect (as defined in Section 9.3(m)) on CDT. Each of CDT and its
Subsidiaries is duly qualified or licensed to do business and is in
good standing (with respect to jurisdictions which recognize such concept) in
each jurisdiction in which the nature of its business or the ownership,
leasing or operation of its properties makes such qualification or licensing
necessary, except for those jurisdictions where the failure to be so
qualified or licensed or to be in good standing would not reasonably be
likely to have a Material Adverse Effect on CDT.   (b) Charter Documents.
CDT and Merger Sub have delivered or made available to Belden prior to the
execution of this Agreement complete and correct copies of (A) the Amended
and Restated Certificate of Incorporation of CDT (including any certificates
of designation), currently in effect (the "CDT Charter"), and the by-laws of
CDT, as amended and currently in effect (the "CDT By-Laws," and, together
with the CDT Charter, the "CDT Organizational Documents"), (B)
the certificate of incorporation and by-laws of Merger Sub in effect on the
date of this Agreement, and (C) the certificate of incorporation and by-laws
or like organizational documents, as amended and currently in effect
(collectively, the "CDT Subsidiary Organizational Documents") of each
Subsidiary of CDT, and each such instrument is in full force and effect. CDT
is not in violation of the CDT Organizational Documents and no Subsidiary of
CDT is in violation of its CDT Subsidiary Organizational Documents, except
for violations that are not material to CDT and its Subsidiaries taken as a
whole.   (c) Subsidiaries. Section 3.1(c) of the CDT Disclosure Schedule
lists each Subsidiary of CDT and sets forth each such Subsidiary\'s capital
structure. Except as set forth in Section 3.1(c) of the CDT Disclosure
Schedule, all the outstanding shares of capital stock of, or other equity
interests in, each Subsidiary of CDT have been validly issued and are fully
paid and nonassessable and are owned directly or indirectly by CDT, free and
clear of all pledges, claims, liens, charges, encumbrances and security
interests of any kind or nature whatsoever (collectively, "Liens") and free
of any other restriction (including any restriction on the right to vote,
sell or otherwise dispose of such capital stock or other ownership
interests).   8     SECTION 3.2 Capital Structure.   (a) The
authorized capital stock of CDT consists of 100,000,000 shares of CDT Common

to date, are collectively referred to herein as the "CDT Stock Plans"),
complete and correct copies of which, in each case as amended, have been
filed as exhibits to the CDT SEC Documents (as defined in Section 3.4(a))
prior to the date of this Agreement or delivered to Belden; (F) 12,175,549

Section 3.2 or in Section 3.2(a) of the CDT Disclosure Schedule, there are no
other equity securities of CDT or securities exchangeable or convertible into

of CDT Common Stock subject to issuance under the CDT Stock Plans and the CDT

forth in the instruments pursuant to which they are issuable, will be
duly authorized, validly issued, fully paid and nonassessable. Except as
contemplated by this Agreement or as set forth in Section 3.2(b) of the CDT
Disclosure Schedule, there are no commitments or agreements of any character
to which CDT is bound obligating CDT to accelerate the vesting of any CDT
Option as a result of the Merger. There are no outstanding or authorized
stock appreciation, phantom stock, profit participation or other similar
rights with respect to CDT.   (c) No bonds, debentures, notes or other
evidences of indebtedness having the right to vote on any matters on which

applicable) in compliance in all material respects with (A) all applicable
securities laws and all other Applicable Laws and (B) all requirements set

(e) Since December 31, 2003 and through the date hereof, except (A) as

change in (x) the outstanding capital stock of CDT, (y) the number of CDT
Options outstanding, or (z) the number of other options, warrants or other
rights to purchase CDT capital stock.   (f) Except as set forth in Section
3.2(f) of the CDT Disclosure Schedule, neither CDT nor any Subsidiary of CDT
is a party to any agreement, arrangement or understanding restricting the
purchase or transfer of, relating to the voting of, requiring registration
of, or granting any preemptive or antidilutive rights with respect to, any
capital stock of CDT or any of its Subsidiaries or any securities of the type
referred to in Section 3.2(d) hereof.   (g) Other than its Subsidiaries, CDT
does not directly or indirectly beneficially own any securities or other
beneficial ownership interests in any other entity except for highly liquid
investments with an original maturity of three months or less at the date of
purchase, made in the ordinary course of business consistent with past
practice.   (h) The authorized capital stock of Merger Sub consists of 100
shares of common stock, par value $.01 per share, all of which shares are
issued and outstanding. CDT is the legal and beneficial owner of all of the
issued and outstanding shares of Merger Sub. Merger Sub was formed at the
direction of CDT on February 4, 2004, solely for the purposes of effecting
the Merger and the other transactions contemplated hereby. Except as required
by or provided for in this Agreement, Merger Sub (A) does not hold, nor has
it held, any assets, (B) does not have, nor has it incurred, any liabilities
and (C) has not carried on any business activities other than in connection
with the Merger and the transactions contemplated hereby. All of the
outstanding shares of capital stock of Merger Sub have been duly authorized
and validly issued, and are fully paid and nonassessable and not subject to
any preemptive rights.   10     SECTION 3.3 Authority; Board Approval;
Voting Requirements; No Conflict; Required Filings and Consents.   (a)
Authority. Subject to obtaining the CDT Share Issuance Approval and the CDT
Charter Approval, each of CDT and Merger Sub has all requisite
corporate power and authority to enter into this Agreement and to consummate
the transactions contemplated hereby. The execution and delivery of this
Agreement by CDT and Merger Sub, and the consummation by CDT and Merger Sub
of the transactions contemplated hereby, have been duly authorized by all
necessary corporate action on the part of CDT and Merger Sub, and no other
corporate proceedings on the part of CDT or Merger Sub and no stockholder
votes are necessary to authorize this Agreement or to consummate the
transactions contemplated hereby, other than with respect to approval of the
CDT Share Issuance, the CDT Share Issuance Approval, and with respect to
approval of the CDT Charter Amendment, the CDT Charter Approval. This
Agreement has been duly executed and delivered by CDT and Merger Sub.
Assuming the due authorization, execution and delivery of this Agreement by
Belden, this Agreement constitutes the legal, valid and binding obligation of
each of CDT and Merger Sub, enforceable against CDT and Merger Sub in

Charter Amendment, the Merger, the CDT Share Issuance and the
other transactions contemplated hereby, which adoption has not been rescinded

Charter Amendment and the CDT Share Issuance be submitted to its stockholders
for consideration in accordance with this Agreement.   (c) Voting
Requirements. The affirmative vote in favor of approval of (i) the CDT Share
Issuance by a majority of the votes cast thereon by holders of shares of CDT
Common Stock present in person or by proxy (the "CDT Share Issuance

the outstanding shares of CDT Common Stock entitled to vote thereon (the "CDT
Charter Approval"), in each case at a duly convened and held
CDT Stockholders\' Meeting (as defined in Section 6.1(b)) are the only votes
of the holders of any class or series of CDT\'s capital stock necessary to
approve the CDT Share Issuance, CDT Charter Amendment, this Agreement and the
Merger.   (d) No Conflict. Except as set forth in Section 3.3(d) of the
CDT Disclosure Schedule, the execution and delivery of this Agreement by CDT
and Merger Sub do not, and the consummation by CDT and Merger Sub of
the transactions contemplated hereby and compliance by CDT and Merger Sub
with the provisions of this Agreement will not, conflict with, or result in
any violation of, or default (with or without notice or lapse of time, or
both) under, require any consent, waiver or approval under, give rise to any
right of termination or other right, or the cancellation or acceleration of
any right or obligation or loss of a benefit under, or result in the  
11    creation of any Lien upon any of the properties or assets of CDT or
any of its Subsidiaries or any restriction on the conduct of CDT\'s business

rule or regulation applicable to CDT or any of its Subsidiaries or their
respective properties or assets, other than, in the case of clause (B), any
such conflicts, violations, defaults, rights, losses, restrictions or Liens,
or failure to obtain consents, waivers or approvals, which would not
reasonably be likely to have a Material Adverse Effect on CDT.   (e)
Required Filings or Consents. No consent, approval, order or authorization
of, action by or in respect of, or registration, declaration or filing with,
any federal, state, local or foreign government, any court, administrative,
regulatory or other governmental agency, commission or authority or any non-

of its Subsidiaries in connection with the execution and delivery of this
Agreement by CDT or Merger Sub, the approval of the CDT Charter Amendment or

Secretary of  State; and   (F) other consents, approvals, orders or

reasonably be  likely to have a Material Adverse Effect on CDT.   SECTION
3.4 SEC Documents; Financial Statements. Except as set forth in Section 3.4
of the CDT Disclosure Schedule:   (a) CDT has filed with the SEC all
registration statements, prospectuses, reports, schedules, forms, statements,
certifications and other documents (including exhibits and all other
information incorporated by reference therein) required to be so filed by CDT
since January 1, 2000 (excluding the Form S-4 and the Joint Proxy Statement,
the "CDT SEC Documents"). As of their respective dates, the CDT SEC Documents
and the offering circular, dated July 1, 2003, pursuant to which the CDT
Debentures were offered (the "CDT Offering Circular") complied in all
material respects with the applicable requirements of the Securities Act or
the Exchange Act, as the case may be, and the rules and regulations of the
SEC promulgated thereunder applicable to such CDT SEC Documents or CDT
Offering Circular, and none of the CDT SEC Documents, when filed, nor the CDT
Offering Circular, as of July 1, 2003 and at the date of issuance of the CDT
Debentures, contained any untrue statement of a material fact or omitted to
state a material fact required to be stated therein or necessary in order to
make the statements therein, in light of the circumstances under which they
were made, not misleading, except to the extent corrected by a subsequently
filed CDT SEC Document filed with the SEC prior to the date hereof.   (b)
The chief executive officer and chief financial officer of CDT have made all
certifications required by the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 (the "Sarbanes-
Oxley Act") and any related rules and regulations promulgated by the SEC, and
the statements contained in all such certifications were complete and correct
in all material respects as of the date made. Neither CDT nor any of
its officers has received notice from the SEC or the NYSE questioning or
challenging the accuracy, completeness, content, form or manner of filing or
submission of such certifications. CDT is, and through the Closing Date will
be, otherwise in material compliance with all applicable effective provisions
of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act and the applicable listing and corporate governance
rules of the New York Stock Exchange.   (c) The financial statements of CDT
included in (i) the CDT SEC Documents, including each CDT SEC Document filed
after the date hereof until the Effective Time, and (ii) the CDT Offering
Circular, complied, as of their respective dates of filing with the SEC or,
in the case of the CDT Offering Circular, as of July 1, 2003 and at the date
of issuance of the CDT Debentures, in all material respects with accounting
requirements and the published rules and regulations of the SEC applicable
with respect thereto, have been prepared in accordance with  
13    United States generally accepted accounting principles ("GAAP")
(except, in the case of unaudited statements, as permitted by Form 10-Q or
8-K of the SEC) applied on a consistent basis during the periods involved
(except as may be indicated in the notes thereto) and fairly present the
consolidated financial position of CDT and its consolidated Subsidiaries as
of the dates thereof and the consolidated results of their operations and
cash flows for the periods then ended (subject, in the case of unaudited
statements, to normal year-end audit adjustments which are not material).  
(d) Except as reflected or reserved against in the balance sheet of CDT dated
October 31, 2003 included in the Form 10-Q filed by CDT with the SEC
on December 15, 2003 (including the notes thereto, the "CDT Balance
Sheet"), neither CDT nor any of its Subsidiaries has any liabilities
(absolute, accrued, contingent or otherwise) which are required by GAAP to be
set forth on a consolidated balance sheet of CDT and its consolidated
Subsidiaries or in the notes thereto, other than (A) liabilities and
obligations incurred since October 31, 2003 in the ordinary course of
business which would not reasonably be likely to have a Material Adverse
Effect on CDT and (B) liabilities and obligations incurred in connection with
this Agreement or the transactions contemplated hereby. The inventory
reflected on the CDT Balance Sheet reflects the value of that inventory at
the lower of (x) the cost of that inventory or (y) the fair market value of
that inventory, and reflects write-offs and write-downs for damaged or
obsolete items, or items of below standard quality, in accordance with the
historical inventory policies and practices of CDT and GAAP.   (e) Neither
CDT nor any of its Subsidiaries is a party to, or has any commitment to
become a party to, any contract, agreement, arrangement or understanding
(including without limitation any contract or arrangement relating to any
transaction or relationship between or among CDT and any of its Subsidiaries,
on the one hand, and any unconsolidated Affiliate (as defined in Section
9.3(a)), including without limitation any structured finance, special purpose
or limited purpose entity or Person, on the other hand), where the result,
purpose or intended effect of such contract or arrangement is to
avoid disclosure of any material transaction involving, or material
liabilities of, CDT or any of its Subsidiaries in CDT\'s or its
Subsidiaries\' published financial statements.   SECTION 3.5 Information
Supplied. None of the information supplied or to be supplied by or on behalf
of CDT or Merger Sub for inclusion or incorporation by reference in (i) the
Form S-4 will, at the time the Form S-4 is filed with the SEC, at any time it
is amended or supplemented or at the time it becomes effective under the
Securities Act, contain any untrue statement of a material fact or omit to
state any material fact required to be stated therein or necessary in order
to make the statements therein, in light of the circumstances under which
they are made, not misleading or (ii) the Joint Proxy Statement will, at the
date it is first mailed to CDT\'s stockholders or at the time of the CDT
Stockholders\' Meeting, contain any untrue statement of a material fact
or omit to state any material fact required to be stated therein or necessary
in order to make the statements therein, in light of the circumstances under
which they are made, not misleading. The Joint Proxy Statement and the Form
S-4 will comply as to form in all material respects with the requirements of
the Securities Act and the Exchange Act and the rules and regulations
thereunder, except that no representation or warranty is made by CDT with
respect to information or statements with respect to Belden or its
Subsidiaries made or   14    incorporated by reference therein supplied
by or on behalf of Belden for inclusion or incorporation by reference in the
Joint Proxy Statement or the Form S-4.   SECTION 3.6 Absence of Certain
Changes or Events.   (a) Since July 31, 2003 through the date hereof, except
as and to the extent (i) disclosed in CDT\'s annual report for the fiscal
year ended July 31, 2003 filed with the SEC on Form 10-K, (ii) set forth in
Section 3.6(a) of the CDT Disclosure Schedule, or (iii) expressly
contemplated by this Agreement:   (A) CDT and its Subsidiaries have
conducted their business only  in the ordinary course consistent with past
practice;   (B) there has not been any split, combination or
reclassification  of any of CDT\'s capital stock or any declaration, setting
aside or  payment of any dividend on, or other distribution (whether in
cash,  stock or property) in respect of, in lieu of, or in substitution

1974, as amended ("ERISA"), or any other Applicable Laws and any employment
agreement, change-in-control agreement, consulting agreement or severance
agreement (such plans, agreements, programs or arrangements, collectively,
"Benefit Plans") with or for the benefit of any current or former employee,
officer or director of CDT or any of its Subsidiaries or any CDT ERISA
Affiliate (as defined in Section 3.9(e)) (the "CDT Benefit Plans"), no event
has occurred and there exists no condition or set of circumstances, that

ERISA, the Code or any other Applicable Laws. Section 3.9(a) of the CDT
Disclosure Schedule lists each material CDT Benefit Plan.   (b) Each CDT
Benefit Plan has been maintained, funded, administered and operated in all
material respects in accordance with its terms, with the applicable
provisions of ERISA, the Code and other Applicable Law and the terms of all
applicable collective bargaining agreements. Except as would not reasonably

including any material amendments thereto, that is capable of approval by, or
registration or qualification for special tax status with, the
appropriate taxation, social security or supervisory authorities in the
relevant country, state, territory or the like (each, an "Approval") has
received such Approval (or there remains a period of time in which to obtain
such Approval retroactive to the date of any material amendment that has not
previously received such Approval) and no event has occurred that would
reasonably be likely to result in the revocation of such Approval or the
imposition of sanctions by such authorities that would reasonably be likely
to be material to CDT and its Subsidiaries taken as a whole.   (c) Neither
CDT nor any of its Subsidiaries has entered into any agreement, arrangement
or understanding, whether written or oral, with any trade union, works
council or other employee representative body or any material number

program within its or their respective workforces.   17     (d) There
are no unresolved claims or disputes under the terms of, or in connection
with, any CDT Benefit Plan (other than routine claims for benefits), and no
action, legal or otherwise, has been commenced or, to the Knowledge of CDT,
threatened with respect to any claim or otherwise in connection with a
CDT Benefit Plan that, in each case, if determined in a manner adverse to CDT
or its Subsidiaries would reasonably be likely to result in a material cost
to, or otherwise have a material and adverse effect upon, the business or
operations of CDT and its Subsidiaries taken as a whole.   (e) Except as
set forth in Section 3.9(e) of the CDT Disclosure Schedule, the aggregate
value of the assets, based upon the actuarial assumptions used for funding
purposes in the most recent actuarial report prepared by such
plan\'s actuary, of each Funded Retirement Plan (as defined below) of CDT or
its Subsidiaries or any CDT ERISA Affiliate is equal to or greater than
the aggregate value of such Funded Retirement Plan\'s liabilities assessed on
an ongoing basis and calculated in accordance with the actuarial methods
and assumptions used in such valuation pursuant to such Funded Retirement
Plan and Applicable Law. Except as set forth in Section 3.9(e) of the CDT
Disclosure Schedule, no Funded Retirement Plan or any trust created
thereunder has incurred any "accumulated funding deficiency" (within the
meaning of Section 302 of ERISA and Section 412 of the Code), whether or not
waived, as of the last date of the most recent fiscal year of each Funded
Retirement Plan ended prior to the Effective Time. For purposes of this
Agreement, "Funded Retirement Plan" means, with respect to a party, a Benefit
Plan that is a "pension plan" within the meaning of Section 3(2) of ERISA
(whether or not such Benefit Plan is subject to ERISA) or other Applicable
Laws, including those under which the assets to satisfy the benefit
obligations are legally segregated from the general assets of such party or
its Subsidiaries and are not subject to the creditors of such party or its
Subsidiaries. None of CDT or any of its Subsidiaries or any other person or
entity under common control within the meaning of Section 414 of the Code
with CDT or any of its Subsidiaries (a "CDT ERISA Affiliate") has
incurred any liability under Title IV of ERISA or to any other governmental
entity under other Applicable Laws (other than for payment of premiums not
yet due to the Pension Benefit Guaranty Corporation ("PBGC")), which
liability has not been fully paid. No Funded Retirement Plan of CDT or any of
its Subsidiaries or any CDT ERISA Affiliate has been completely or partially
terminated or been the subject of a "reportable event" as defined in Section
4043 of ERISA. No proceeding by the PBGC to terminate a CDT Benefit Plan has
been instituted or, to the Knowledge of CDT, threatened.   (f) At no time
has CDT or any of its Subsidiaries or any CDT ERISA Affiliate participated in
and/or been obligated to contribute to any Benefit Plan that is a
"multiemployer plan" within the meaning of Section 3(37) of ERISA.   (g)
Except as set forth in Section 3.9(g) of the CDT Disclosure Schedule, no CDT
Benefit Plan provides health benefits (whether or not insured), with respect
to employees or former employees of CDT or any of its Subsidiaries
after retirement or other termination of service (other than coverage
mandated by Applicable Law or benefits the full cost of which is borne by the
employee or former employee).   (h) Except as set forth in Section 3.9(h)
of the CDT Disclosure Schedule, neither the negotiation and execution of this
Agreement nor the consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby will
(either alone or upon the occurrence of any additional or subsequent  
18    events) constitute an event under any CDT Benefit Plan that will or
is reasonably likely to result in any payment (whether of severance pay
or otherwise), acceleration of payment, forgiveness of indebtedness,
vesting, distribution, increase in benefits or obligation to fund benefits
with respect to any employee or former employee of CDT or any of its
Subsidiaries. Except as set forth in Section 3.9(h) of the CDT Disclosure
Schedule, there is no contract, agreement, plan or arrangement with an
employee or former employee of CDT or any of its Subsidiaries to which CDT or
any of its Subsidiaries is a party as of the date of this Agreement, that,
individually or collectively and as a result of the transaction contemplated
hereby (whether alone or upon the occurrence of any additional or subsequent
events) or otherwise, would reasonably be likely to give rise to the payment
of any amount that would not be deductible pursuant to Sections 280G or
162(m) of the Code.   (i) There have been no non-exempt "prohibited
transactions" as defined in Section 406 of ERISA or Section 4975 of the Code
with respect to any CDT Benefit Plan that would reasonably be likely to
result in penalties that are material to CDT; no fiduciary, as defined in
Section 3(21) of ERISA, has any material liability for breach of fiduciary
duty or any other failure to act or comply in connection with the
administration or investment of assets of any CDT Benefit Plan; and CDT, its
Subsidiaries and each CDT ERISA Affiliate have complied in all material
respects with the requirements of Part 6 of Subtitle B of Title I of ERISA
and Section 4980B of the Code and any similar state law ("COBRA").   SECTION

Section 3.10(c) of the CDT Disclosure Schedule, the unpaid Taxes of CDT and
its Subsidiaries (A) did not, as of the most recent financial statements
contained in CDT SEC Documents filed prior to the date of this Agreement,
materially exceed the reserve for Tax liability (rather than any reserve for
deferred Taxes established to reflect timing differences between book and Tax
income) set forth on the face of such financial statements (rather than in
any notes thereto), and (B) do not materially exceed that reserve as adjusted
for the passage of time since the date of such financial statements
in accordance with the past custom and practice of CDT and its Subsidiaries
in filing their Tax Returns.   19     (d) Except as set forth in
Section 3.10(d) of the CDT Disclosure Schedule, to CDT\'s Knowledge, no Tax
Authority has raised any material issue in connection with any Audit of CDT
or its Subsidiaries. Neither CDT nor any of its Subsidiaries has received
notice of any material claim made by a governmental authority in a
jurisdiction where CDT or any of its Subsidiaries, as applicable, does not
file a Tax Return, that CDT or such Subsidiary is or may be subject
to taxation by that jurisdiction.   (e) Except as set forth in Section
3.10(e) of the CDT Disclosure Schedule, there are no outstanding requests,

parent of which is CDT) under Treasury Regulation (S) 1.1502-6 (or any

or successor, by contract, or otherwise.   (g) Neither CDT nor any of its
Subsidiaries has: (A) agreed to make or is required to make any material
adjustment under Section 481(a) of the Code; (B) constituted either a
"distributing corporation" or a "controlled corporation" (within the meaning
of Section 355(a)(1)(A) of the Code) in a distribution of stock qualifying
for tax-free treatment under Section 355 of the Code (1) in the two years
prior to the date of this Agreement or (2) in a distribution which could
otherwise constitute part of a "plan" or "series of related
transactions" (within the meaning of Section 355(e) of the Code) in
connection with the Merger; or (C) taken any action, or failed to take any
action, or knows of any fact, agreement, plan or other circumstance, that
could reasonably be expected to prevent the Merger from qualifying as a
"reorganization" within the meaning of Section 368(a) of the Code.   (h)

of CDT\'s Subsidiaries that are not incorporated under the laws of the United

is used in Item  601(b)(10) of Regulation S-K of the SEC) with respect to CDT
and its  Subsidiaries;   (2) any Contract to which CDT or any of its
Subsidiaries is a  party, which is material to CDT and its Subsidiaries,
taken as a  whole, and which contains any covenant limiting or restricting
the  right of CDT or any of its Subsidiaries, or that would, after the

competing in any material line of business or in any  geographic area or with
any Person in any material line of business;  or   (3) any Contract or
group of Contracts with a Person (or group of  affiliated Persons) to which

their terms or (B) the failure to be in full force and effect or enforceable
would not reasonably be likely to be material to CDT. Neither CDT nor any of
its Subsidiaries, nor, to CDT\'s Knowledge, any counterparty to any CDT
Material Contract, has breached or violated any provision of, or committed or
failed to perform any act which, with or without notice, lapse of time
or both would constitute a default under the provisions of, any CDT

defaults which would not permit any other party to cancel or terminate such
CDT Material Contract, and would not permit any other party to seek material
damages or other remedies (for any or all of such breaches violations or
defaults, in the aggregate).   SECTION 3.19 Title to Assets. Except as
disclosed in Section 3.19 of the CDT Disclosure Schedule or as a result of

reasonably be likely to result in a material cost to, or otherwise have a
material and adverse effect upon, the business or operations of CDT and its
Subsidiaries taken as a whole; and (y) easements, covenants, conditions,
restrictions and other similar matters of record affecting title to such CDT
Owned Real Property which do not or would not materially impair the use or

cancellation or otherwise with respect to any insurance policies in force
naming CDT, any of its Subsidiaries or employees thereof as an insured or
beneficiary or as a loss payable payee, and each of CDT and such Subsidiaries

reservation of rights or have denied liability, and there exists no material
claim under such insurance policies that has not been properly filed by CDT
or any Subsidiary.   SECTION 3.21 Interested Party Transactions. Except as
set forth in Section 3.21 of CDT Disclosure Schedule, since the date of the

reported as a Certain Relationship or Related Transaction pursuant to
Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 57 or Item 404 of Regulation
S-K of the SEC.   SECTION 3.22 CDT Rights Agreement. CDT has taken all
action, if any, so that the execution of this Agreement, the consummation of

Agreement or enable, require or cause the CDT Rights to be exercised,
distributed or triggered.   SECTION 3.23 Value-Added Resellers, Distributors
and Suppliers. CDT has, and has caused its Subsidiaries to, use commercially

Disclosure Schedule, is identified by reference to, or has been grouped under

material to Belden or any of its Subsidiaries.   26     SECTION 4.1

"Belden SEC Documents"). As of their respective dates, the Belden SEC
Documents complied in all material respects with the applicable requirements
of the Securities Act or the Exchange Act, as the case may be, and the rules
and regulations of the SEC promulgated thereunder applicable to such Belden
SEC Documents, and none of the Belden SEC Documents, when filed, contained
any untrue statement of a material fact or omitted to state a material fact

relationship between or among Belden and any of its Subsidiaries, on the one
hand, and any unconsolidated Affiliate, including without limitation any
structured finance, special purpose or limited purpose entity or Person, on
the other hand), where the result, purpose or intended effect of such

involving, or material liabilities of, Belden or any of its Subsidiaries in
Belden\'s or its Subsidiaries\' published financial statements.   SECTION

Benefit Plan with or for the benefit of any current or former employee,
officer or director of Belden or any of its Subsidiaries or any Belden ERISA
Affiliate (as defined in Section 4.9(e)) (the "Belden Benefit Plans"), no
event has occurred and there exists no condition or set of circumstances,
that would reasonably be likely to have a Material Adverse  
34    Effect on Belden under ERISA, the Code or any other Applicable Law.
Section 4.9(a) of the Belden Disclosure Schedule lists each material Belden
Benefit Plan.   (b) Each Belden Benefit Plan has been maintained, funded,
administered and operated in all material respects in accordance with its
terms, with the applicable provisions of ERISA, the Code and other Applicable
Law and the terms of all applicable collective bargaining agreements, except
as would not reasonably be likely to have a Material Adverse Effect on
Belden, each Belden Benefit Plan, including any material amendments thereto,
that is capable of Approval has received such Approval (or there remains a
period of time in which to obtain such Approval retroactive to the date of
any material amendment that has not previously received such Approval) and no
event has occurred that would reasonably be likely to result in the
revocation of such Approval or the imposition of sanctions by such
authorities that would reasonably be likely to be material to Belden and its
Subsidiaries taken as a whole.   (c) Neither Belden nor any of its
Subsidiaries has entered into any agreement, arrangement or understanding,

or otherwise, has been commenced or, to the Knowledge of Belden, threatened

Subsidiaries would reasonably be likely to result in a material cost to, or
otherwise have a material and adverse effect upon, the business or operations
of Belden and its Subsidiaries taken as a whole.   (e) Except as set forth
in Section 4.9(e) of the Belden Disclosure Schedule, the aggregate value of
the assets, based upon the actuarial assumptions used for funding purposes in
the most recent actuarial report prepared by such plan\'s actuary, of each
Funded Retirement Plan of Belden or its Subsidiaries or any Belden ERISA
Affiliate is equal to or greater than the aggregate value of such Funded
Retirement Plan\'s liabilities assessed on an ongoing basis and calculated in
accordance with the actuarial methods and assumptions used in such valuation
pursuant to such Funded Retirement Plan and Applicable Law. Except as set
forth in Section 4.9(e) of the Belden Disclosure Schedule, no Funded
Retirement Plan or any trust created thereunder has incurred any "accumulated
funding deficiency" (within the meaning of Section 302 of ERISA and Section
412 of the Code), whether or not waived, as of the last date of the most
recent fiscal year of each Funded Retirement Plan ended prior to
the Effective Time. None of Belden or any of its Subsidiaries or any other
person or entity under common control within the meaning of Section 414 of
the Code with Belden or any of its Subsidiaries (a "Belden ERISA Affiliate")
has incurred any liability under Title IV of ERISA or to any other
governmental entity under Applicable Laws (other than for payment of premiums
not yet due to the PBGC), which liability has not been fully paid. No Funded
Retirement Plan of Belden, any of its Subsidiaries or any Belden ERISA
Affiliate has been completely or partially terminated or been the subject of

Knowledge of Belden, threatened.   35     (f) At no time has Belden or
any of its Subsidiaries or any Belden ERISA Affiliate participated in and/or
been obligated to contribute to any Benefit Plan that is a "multiemployer
plan" within the meaning of Section 3(37) of ERISA.   (g) Except as set
forth in Section 4.9(g) of the Belden Disclosure Schedule, no Belden Benefit
Plan provides health benefits (whether or not insured), with respect to
employees or former employees of Belden or any of its Subsidiaries after
retirement or other termination of service (other than coverage mandated by
Applicable Law or benefits, the full cost of which is borne by the employee
or former employee).   (h) Except as set forth in Section 4.9(h) of the
Belden Disclosure Schedule, neither the negotiation and execution of this
Agreement nor the consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby will
(either alone or upon the occurrence of any additional or subsequent events)
constitute an event under any Belden Benefit Plan that will or is reasonably
likely to result in any payment (whether of severance pay or otherwise),
acceleration of payment, forgiveness of indebtedness, vesting, distribution,
increase in benefits or obligation to fund benefits with respect to any
employee or former employee of Belden or any of its Subsidiaries. Except as
set forth in Section 4.9(h) of the Belden Disclosure Schedule, there is no
contract, agreement, plan or arrangement with an employee or former employee
of Belden or any of its Subsidiaries to which Belden or any of its
Subsidiaries is a party as of the date of this Agreement, that, individually
or collectively and as a result of the transaction contemplated hereby
(whether alone or upon the occurrence of any additional or subsequent events)
or otherwise, would reasonably be likely to give rise to the payment of any
amount that would not be deductible pursuant to Sections 280G or 162(m) of
the Code. Belden has received a definitive acknowledgement from C. Baker
Cunningham that the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, including,
without limitation, those contemplated by Section 6.13, do not and shall not
be deemed to constitute "Good Reason" under the Change of Control Employment
Agreement, dated as of July 31, 2001, by and between Belden and C. Baker
Cunningham.   (i) There have been no non-exempt "prohibited transactions" as
defined in Section 406 of ERISA or Section 4975 of the Code with respect to
any Belden Benefit Plan that would reasonably be likely to result in
penalties that are material to Belden; no fiduciary, as defined in Section
3(21) of ERISA, has any material liability for breach of fiduciary duty or
any other failure to act or comply in connection with the administration or
investment of assets of any Belden Benefit Plan; and Belden, its Subsidiaries
and each Belden ERISA Affiliate have complied in all material respects with
the requirements of COBRA.   SECTION 4.10 Taxes.   (a) Except as set forth
in Section 4.10(a) of the Belden Disclosure Schedule, each of Belden and its
Subsidiaries, including any predecessors thereof, has (A) duly and timely

required to be filed by or on behalf of it (taking into account all
applicable extensions) with the appropriate Tax Authority and all such Tax
Returns are true, correct and complete, (B) duly paid in full or
made provision in accordance with GAAP (or there has been paid or provision

Subsidiaries.   (c) Except as set forth in Section 4.10(c) of the Belden
Disclosure Schedule, the unpaid Taxes of Belden and its Subsidiaries (A) did
not, as of the most recent financial statements contained in the Belden SEC
Documents filed prior to the date of this Agreement, materially exceed the
reserve for Tax liability (rather than any reserve for deferred Taxes
established to reflect timing differences between book and Tax income) set
forth on the face of such financial statements (rather than in any notes
thereto), and (B) do not materially exceed that reserve as adjusted for the
passage of time since the date of such financial statements in accordance
with the past custom and practice of Belden and its Subsidiaries in filing
their Tax Returns.   (d) Except as set forth in Section 4.10(d) of the
Belden Disclosure Schedule, to Belden\'s Knowledge, no Tax Authority has
raised any material issue in connection with any Audit of Belden and its

Return, that Belden or such Subsidiary is or may be subject to taxation by
that jurisdiction.   (e) Except as set forth in Section 4.10(e) of the
Belden Disclosure Schedule, there are no outstanding requests, agreements,

any Person (other than Belden or any member of the group the common parent of
which is Belden) under Treasury Regulation (S) 1.1502-6 (or any similar
provision of state, local or foreign law), as a transferee or successor, by
contract, or otherwise.   (g) Neither Belden nor any of its Subsidiaries
has: (A) agreed to make or is required to make any material adjustment under
Section 481(a) of the Code; (B) constituted either a "distributing
corporation" or a "controlled corporation" (within the meaning of Section
355(a)(1)(A) of the Code) in a distribution of stock qualifying for tax-free
treatment under Section 355 of the Code (I) in the two years prior to the
date of this Agreement or (II) in a distribution which could otherwise
constitute part of a "plan" or "series of related transactions" (within the
meaning of Section 355(e) of the Code) in connection with the Merger; or (C)
taken any action, or failed to take any action, or knows of any fact,
agreement, plan or other   37    circumstance, that could reasonably be
expected to prevent the Merger from qualifying as a "reorganization" within

Rights Agreement. Belden has taken all action so that the execution of this
Agreement and the consummation of the Merger and other transactions
contemplated hereby do not and will not result in the grant of any rights to
any Person under the Belden Rights Agreement or enable, require or cause the
Belden Rights to be exercised, distributed or triggered. The Board of
Directors of Belden has approved an amendment to the Belden Rights
Agreement to provide that the Belden Rights will terminate upon the Effective
Time.   SECTION 4.23 Value-Added Resellers, Distributors and Suppliers.
Belden has, and has caused its Subsidiaries to, use commercially reasonable
efforts to maintain good working relationships with all of their respective
material customers, distributors, value-added resellers, dealers and
suppliers. Since September 30, 2003, neither Belden nor any of its
Subsidiaries has materially altered the conduct of its relations with value-
added resellers, distributors or suppliers, including without limitation,
sales terms and conditions, except in the ordinary course of business
consistent with past practice. Section 4.23 of the Belden Disclosure Schedule
sets forth a list of all material manufacturer representative, consulting and
supplier relationships where the termination by Belden or its Subsidiaries
would result in material payments or costs.   ARTICLE V   COVENANTS

all existing activities, discussions or negotiations with any third parties

similar agreement) relating to any such possible or proposed Alternative
Transaction.   (b) Notification of Alternative Transactions. As promptly
as practicable (and in any event within twenty-four (24) hours) after receipt
of any Alternative Transaction Proposal or any request for nonpublic
information or any inquiry relating to any Alternative Transaction Proposal,
CDT or Belden, as the case may be, shall provide the other party with oral
and written notice of the material terms and conditions of such Alternative
Transaction Proposal, request or inquiry, and the identity of the Person or
group making any such Alternative Transaction Proposal, request or inquiry.
In addition, CDT or Belden, as the case may be, shall provide the other party
as promptly as practicable with oral and written notice setting forth all
such information as is reasonably necessary to keep the other party informed
in all material respects of all material developments regarding the status
and terms (including material amendments or proposed material amendments) of,
any such Alternative Transaction Proposal, request or inquiry, and, without
limitation of the other provisions of this Section 5.2, shall promptly
provide to the other party a copy of all written materials (including written
materials provided by email or otherwise in electronic format) subsequently
provided by or to it in connection with such Alternative Transaction
Proposal, request or inquiry. CDT or Belden, as the case may be, shall
provide the other party with forty-eight (48) hours\' prior notice (or such
lesser prior notice as is provided to the members of its Board of Directors)
of any meeting of its Board of Directors at which its Board of Directors is
reasonably likely to consider any Alternative Transaction Proposal or
Alternative Transaction.   (c) Superior Proposals. Notwithstanding anything
to the contrary contained in Section 5.2(a), in the event that CDT or Belden,
as the case may be, receives an unsolicited, bona fide Alternative
Transaction Proposal which is determined (in accordance with Section 9.3(p))
to   48    be, or to be reasonably likely to lead to, a Superior
Proposal (as defined in Section 9.3(p)), it may then take the following
actions (but only (1) if and to the extent that (x) its Board of Directors
concludes in good faith, after receipt of advice of its outside legal
counsel, that the failure to do so could reasonably result in a breach of its
fiduciary obligations to its stockholders under Applicable Law, and (y) CDT
or Belden, as the case may be, has given the other party at least three (3)
business days\' prior written notice of its intention to take any of the
following actions and of the identity of the Person or group making such
Superior Proposal and the material terms and conditions of such Superior
Proposal and (2) if it shall not have breached in any material respect any of
the provisions of this Section 5.2):   (i) Furnish nonpublic information to
the Person or group making such  Superior Proposal, provided that (A) prior
to furnishing any such nonpublic  information, it receives from such Person
or group an executed  confidentiality containing terms at least as
restrictive as the terms  contained in the Confidentiality Agreement, dated
as of October 28, 2003,  between Belden and CDT (the "CDA") and (B)
contemporaneously with  furnishing any such nonpublic information to such
Person or group, it  furnishes such nonpublic information to the other party
hereto (to the  extent such nonpublic information has not been previously so
furnished to  such party); and   (ii) Engage in negotiations with such
Person or group with respect to  such Superior Proposal.   (d) Changes of
Recommendation.   (i) In response to the receipt of an unsolicited, bona
fide  Alternative Transaction Proposal which is determined (in accordance
with  Section 9.3(p)) to be a Superior Proposal, the Board of Directors of
CDT or  Belden, as the case may be, may withhold, withdraw, amend or modify
its  recommendation in favor of, in the case of Belden, approval and adoption
of  this Agreement and the Merger and, in the case of CDT, the CDT Charter 
Amendment and the CDT Share Issuance, and, in the case of a Superior 
Proposal that is a tender or exchange offer made directly to its 
stockholders, may recommend that its stockholders accept the tender or 
exchange offer (any of the foregoing actions, whether by a Board of 
Directors or a committee thereof, a "Change of Recommendation"), if all of 
the following conditions in clauses (1) through (5) are met:   (1) the
Superior Proposal has been made and has not been  withdrawn and continues to
be a Superior Proposal;   (2) the CDT Stockholders\' Meeting or Belden
Stockholders\'  Meeting, as the case may be, has not occurred;   (3) CDT or
Belden, as the case may be, has (A) provided to the  other party hereto five
(5) business days\' prior written notice which  shall state expressly (x)
that it has received a Superior Proposal,  (y) the material terms and
conditions of the Superior Proposal and the  identity of the Person or group
making the Superior Proposal, and (z)  that it intends to effect a Change of
Recommendation and the manner in  which it intends to do so, (B) made
available to the other party   49     hereto all materials and
information made available to the Person or  group making the Superior
Proposal in connection with such Superior  Proposal, and (C) during such five
(5) business day period, if  requested by the other party hereto, engaged in
good faith  negotiations to amend this Agreement in such a manner that the 
Alternative Transaction Proposal which was determined to be a Superior 
Proposal no longer is a Superior Proposal;   (4) The Board of Directors of
CDT or Belden, as the case may be,  has concluded in good faith, after
receipt of advice of its outside  legal counsel, that, in light of such
Superior Proposal, the failure  of the Board of Directors to effect a Change
of Recommendation is  reasonably likely to result in a breach of its
fiduciary obligations  to its stockholders under Applicable Law; and   (5)
The party whose Board of Directors is making the Change of  Recommendation
shall have complied with Section 5.2(c) and shall not  have breached in any
material respect any of the other provisions set  forth in this Section 5.2
or in Sections 6.1(b) through 6.1(d).   (ii) Without limiting the foregoing,
(1) the Board of Directors of CDT  may effect a Change of Recommendation (but
only insofar as the same  involves withholding, withdrawing, amending or
modifying its recommendation  in favor of the CDT Charter Amendment or the
CDT Share Issuance), (x) if  there shall have occurred and be continuing a
Material Adverse Change of  Belden since the date of this Agreement and (y)
CDT shall not have breached  in any material respect any of the provisions
set forth in this Section 5.2  or Section 6.1; and (2) the Board of Directors
of Belden may effect a  Change of Recommendation (but only insofar as the
same involves  withholding, withdrawing, amending or modifying its
recommendation in favor  of the Merger), (x) if there shall have occurred and
be continuing a  Material Adverse Change of CDT since the date of this
Agreement and (y)  Belden shall not have breached in any material respect any
of the  provisions set forth in this Section 5.2 or Section 6.1.   (e)
Continuing Obligation to Hold Stockholders\' Meeting; No Other
Vote. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this Agreement,
the obligation of CDT or Belden to call, give notice of, convene and hold the
CDT Stockholders\' Meeting or the Belden Stockholders\' Meeting, as the case
may be, shall not be limited or otherwise affected by the commencement,
disclosure, announcement or submission to it of any Alternative Transaction
Proposal with respect to it, or by any Change of Recommendation. At any such
meeting, neither CDT nor Belden shall submit to the vote of its respective
stockholders any Alternative Transaction, whether or not a Superior Proposal
has been received by it, or propose to do so.   (f) Compliance with Tender
Offer Rules. Nothing contained in this Agreement shall prohibit CDT or Belden
or their respective Boards of Directors from taking and disclosing to their
stockholders a position contemplated by Rules 14d-9 and 14e-2(a) promulgated
under the Exchange Act; provided that neither CDT nor Belden shall effect, or
disclose pursuant to such Rules or otherwise a position which constitutes, a
Change of Recommendation unless specifically permitted pursuant to the terms
of Section 5.2(d).   50     ARTICLE VI   ADDITIONAL AGREEMENTS  
SECTION 6.1 Preparation of SEC Documents; Stockholders\' Meetings.   (a) As
soon as practicable following the date of this Agreement, Belden and CDT
shall agree upon the terms of, prepare and file with the SEC the Joint Proxy
Statement, and CDT shall prepare and file with the SEC the Form S-4, in which
the Joint Proxy Statement will be included as a prospectus. Each of
Belden and CDT shall use commercially reasonable efforts to have the Form S-4
declared effective under the Securities Act as promptly as practicable after
such filing. Belden will use commercially reasonable efforts to cause the
Joint Proxy Statement, a copy of Belden\'s annual report on Form 10-K for the
year ended December 31, 2003 and a copy of CDT\'s annual report on Form 10-K
for the year ended July 31, 2003 to be mailed to Belden\'s stockholders, and
CDT will use commercially reasonable efforts to cause the Joint Proxy
Statement, a copy of Belden\'s annual report on Form 10-K for the year ended
December 31, 2003 and a copy of CDT\'s annual report on Form 10-K for the
year ended July 31, 2003 to be mailed to CDT\'s stockholders, in each case as
promptly as practicable after the Form S-4 is declared effective under the
Securities Act. CDT shall also take any action (other than qualifying to do
business in any jurisdiction in which it is not now so qualified or to file a
general consent to service of process) reasonably required to be taken under
any applicable state securities laws in connection with the issuance of
shares of CDT Common Stock in the Merger and, subject to the satisfaction of
the condition set forth in Section 7.2(e), the conversion of Belden Options
into options to acquire CDT Common Stock, and Belden shall furnish all
information concerning Belden and the holders of Belden Common Stock as may
be reasonably requested in connection with any such action. Each party shall
cooperate and provide the other party with a reasonable opportunity to review
and comment on any amendment or supplement to the Form S-4 or the Joint Proxy
Statement or any filing with the SEC incorporated by reference in the Form
S-4 or the Joint Proxy Statement, in each case prior to filing such with the
SEC, and each party shall provide the other party with a copy of all such
filings made with the SEC; provided, however, that each party shall be deemed
to have consented to the inclusion in the Form S-4, the Joint Proxy Statement
or any filing with the SEC incorporated by reference in the Form S-4 or the
Joint Proxy Statement of any information, language or content specifically
agreed to by such party or its counsel on or prior to the date hereof for
inclusion therein. CDT will advise Belden promptly after it receives notice
of (i) the time when the Form S-4 has become effective or any supplement or
amendment has been filed, (ii) the issuance of any stop order, (iii)
the suspension of the qualification of the CDT Common Stock issuable in
connection with the Merger for offering or sale in any jurisdiction, or (iv)
any request by the SEC for amendment of the Joint Proxy Statement or the Form
S-4 or comments thereon and responses thereto or requests by the SEC for
additional information. If at any time prior to the Effective Time any
information (including any Change of Recommendation) relating to Belden or
CDT, or any of their respective Affiliates, officers or directors, should be
discovered by Belden or CDT which should be set forth in an amendment or
supplement to any of the Form S-4 or the Joint Proxy Statement, so that any
of such documents would not include any misstatement of a material fact or
omit to state any material fact necessary to make the statements therein, in
light of the circumstances under which they were made, not misleading, the
party which discovers such information shall promptly notify the other
parties hereto and an appropriate amendment or   51    supplement
describing such information shall promptly be filed with the SEC and, to the
extent required by law, disseminated to the stockholders of Belden
and CDT.   (b) Each of CDT and Belden shall, as promptly as practicable
after the Form S-4 is declared effective under the Securities Act, take all
action necessary in accordance with Applicable Law and the CDT
Organizational Documents, in the case of CDT, and the Belden Organizational
Documents, in the case of Belden, to duly give notice of, convene and hold a
meeting of its stockholders to be held as promptly as practicable to
consider, in the case of Belden, the adoption and approval of this Agreement
and the Merger and the election of directors (the "Belden Stockholders\'
Meeting"), and, in the case of CDT, the CDT Share Issuance and the CDT
Charter Amendment (the "CDT Stockholders\' Meeting"). Subject to Section
5.2(d), each of CDT and Belden will use commercially reasonable efforts to
solicit from its stockholders proxies in favor of, in the case of Belden, the
adoption and approval of this Agreement and the Merger and, in the case of
CDT, the CDT Share Issuance and the CDT Charter Amendment, and will take all
other action reasonably necessary or advisable to secure the vote or consent
of its stockholders required by the rules of the NYSE or Applicable Law to
obtain such approvals. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in
this Agreement, CDT or Belden may adjourn or postpone the CDT Stockholders\'
Meeting or Belden Stockholders\' Meeting, as the case may be, to the extent
necessary to ensure that any necessary supplement or amendment to the Joint
Proxy Statement is provided to its respective stockholders in advance of a
vote on, in the case of Belden, the adoption and approval of this
Agreement and the Merger and, in the case of CDT, the CDT Share Issuance and
the CDT Charter Amendment, or, if, as of the time for which the CDT
Stockholders\' Meeting or Belden Stockholders\' Meeting, as the case may be,
is originally scheduled, there are insufficient shares of CDT Common Stock or
Belden Common Stock, as the case may be, represented (either in person or by
proxy) to constitute a quorum necessary to conduct the business of such
meeting. Each of CDT and Belden shall ensure that the CDT Stockholders\'
Meeting and the Belden Stockholders\' Meeting, respectively, is called,
noticed, convened, held and conducted, and that all proxies solicited in
connection with the CDT Stockholders\' Meeting or Belden Stockholders\'
Meeting, as the case may be, are solicited in compliance with Applicable Law,
the rules of the NYSE and, in the case of CDT, the CDT Organizational
Documents, and, in the case of Belden, the Belden Organizational Documents.
Without the prior written consent of Belden, the CDT Charter Amendment and
the CDT Share Issuance are the only matters which CDT shall propose to be
acted on by CDT\'s stockholders at the CDT Stockholders\' Meeting. Without
the prior written consent of CDT, the approval and adoption of this Agreement
and the Merger and the election of directors are the only matters which
Belden shall propose to be acted on by Belden\'s stockholders at the
Belden Stockholders\' Meeting.   (c) Each of CDT and Belden will use
commercially reasonable efforts to hold the CDT Stockholders\' Meeting and
Belden Stockholders\' Meeting, respectively, on the same date as the other

(i) the Board of Directors of each of Belden and CDT shall recommend that
its stockholders vote in favor of, in the case of Belden, the approval and

stockholders vote in favor of approval and adoption of this Agreement and the
Merger at the Belden Stockholders\' Meeting, and (iii) neither the Board of
Directors of CDT or Belden nor any committee thereof shall withdraw, amend or
modify, or propose or resolve to withdraw, amend or modify in a manner
adverse to the other party, the recommendation of its respective Board of
Directors that the respective stockholders of CDT or Belden vote in favor
of, in the case of Belden, the approval and adoption of this Agreement and
the Merger, and, in the case of CDT, the CDT Share Issuance and the CDT

Belden shall use commercially reasonable efforts to cause to be delivered to
the other party on or prior to the dates thereof two (2) letters from their
respective independent accountants, one dated approximately as of the date
the Form S-4 is declared effective and one dated approximately as of the
Closing Date, each addressed to the other party, in form and substance
reasonably satisfactory to the other party and customary in scope and
substance for comfort letters delivered by independent public accountants in
connection with registration statements similar to the Form S-4.   SECTION
6.3 Access to Information; Confidentiality.   (a) Subject to the CDA and
Applicable Law, each of Belden and CDT shall, and shall cause each of its

employees, accountants, counsel, financial advisors and other representatives
of such other party, reasonable access during normal business hours during
the period prior to the Effective Time to all their respective properties,
books, contracts, commitments, personnel and records (provided that such
access shall not interfere with the business or operations of such party)
and, during such period, each of Belden and CDT shall, and shall cause each
of its respective Subsidiaries to, furnish promptly to the other party (a) a
copy of each report, schedule, registration statement and other document
filed by it during such period pursuant to the requirements of federal or
state securities laws and (b) all other information concerning its
business, properties and personnel as such other party may reasonably

parties hereto under this Agreement.   (b) Each of Belden and CDT will
hold, and will cause its respective officers, employees, accountants,
counsel, financial advisors and other representatives and Affiliates to hold,
any nonpublic information in accordance with the terms of the CDA.  
SECTION 6.4 Commercially Reasonable Efforts.   (a) Upon the terms and
subject to the conditions set forth in this Agreement, each of the parties
agrees to use its commercially reasonable efforts to take, or cause to be
taken, all actions, and to do, or cause to be done, and to assist and
cooperate with the other parties in doing, all things necessary, proper or
advisable to consummate and make effective, in the most expeditious manner
practicable, the Merger and the other transactions contemplated by this  
53    Agreement, including (i) the obtaining of all necessary actions or
nonactions, waivers, consents, clearances and approvals from Governmental
Entities and the making of all necessary registrations and filings and the
taking of all steps as may be necessary to obtain an approval, clearance or
waiver from, or to avoid an action or proceeding by, any Governmental Entity,
including all filings required by the HSR Act (the initial filing required by
the HSR Act to be filed as soon as reasonably practicable following the
execution of this Agreement) and any applicable antitrust, competition or
similar laws of any foreign jurisdiction, (ii) the obtaining of all necessary
consents, approvals or waivers from third parties, (iii) the defending of any
lawsuits or other legal proceedings, whether judicial or administrative,
challenging this Agreement or the consummation of the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement, including seeking to have any stay or
temporary restraining order entered by any court or other Governmental Entity
vacated or reversed, and (iv) the execution and delivery of any additional
instruments necessary to consummate the transactions contemplated by, and to
fully carry out the purposes of, this Agreement. Subject to Applicable Laws
relating to the exchange of information and in addition to Section
6.4(b), CDT and Belden, or their respective counsel, shall have the right to
review in advance, and to the extent practicable each will consult the other
on, all the information relating to CDT and its Subsidiaries or Belden and
its Subsidiaries, as the case may be, that appears in any filing made with,
or written materials submitted to, any third party or any Governmental Entity
in connection with the Merger and the other transactions contemplated by this
Agreement.   (b) Each of Belden and CDT shall keep the other reasonably
apprised of the status of matters relating to the completion of the
transactions contemplated hereby and work cooperatively in connection with
obtaining all required approvals, consents or clearances of any Governmental
Entity (whether domestic, foreign or supranational). In that regard, each
party shall without limitation: (i) promptly notify the other of, and if in
writing, furnish the other with copies of (or, in the case of material oral
communications, advise the other orally of) any communications from or with
any Governmental Entity (whether domestic, foreign or supranational) with
respect to the Merger or any of the other transactions contemplated by this
Agreement, (ii) permit the other to review and discuss in advance, and
consider in good faith the views of the other in connection with, any
proposed written (or any material proposed oral) communication with any such
Governmental Entity, (iii) not participate in any meeting with any such
Governmental Entity unless it consults with the other in advance and to the
extent permitted by such Governmental Entity gives the other the opportunity
to attend and participate thereat, (iv) furnish the other with copies of all
correspondence, filings and communications (and memoranda setting forth the
substance thereof) between it and any such Governmental Entity with respect
to this Agreement and the Merger, and (v) furnish the other with
such necessary information and reasonable assistance as Belden or CDT may
reasonably request in connection with its preparation of necessary filings or
submissions of information to any such Governmental Entity. Each of Belden
and CDT may, as each deems advisable and necessary, reasonably designate any
competitively sensitive material provided to the other under this Section 6.4
as "outside counsel only." Such material and the information contained
therein shall be given only to the outside legal counsel of the recipient and
will not be disclosed by such outside counsel to employees, officers, or
directors of the recipient unless express permission is obtained in advance
from the source of the materials (Belden or CDT, as the case may be) or its
legal counsel.   54     (c) In connection with and without limiting the
foregoing, Belden and CDT shall (i) take all action necessary to ensure that
no state takeover statute or similar statute or regulation is or becomes
applicable to this Agreement or any of the transactions contemplated hereby
and (ii) if any state takeover statute or similar statute or regulation
becomes applicable to this Agreement or any of the transactions contemplated
hereby, take all action necessary to ensure that such transactions may be
consummated as promptly as practicable on the terms required by, or provided
for, in this Agreement and otherwise to minimize the effect of such statute
or regulation on the Merger and the other transactions contemplated by this
Agreement.   SECTION 6.5 Indemnification and Insurance.   (a) At the
Effective Time, the certificate of incorporation and by-laws of CDT will
contain provisions with respect to exculpation and indemnification that are
at least as favorable to the officers and directors of CDT (the
"Indemnified Parties") as those contained in the CDT Charter and the CDT By-
laws as in effect on the date hereof, which provisions will not be amended,
repealed or otherwise modified for a period of six years from the Effective
Time in any manner that would adversely affect the rights thereunder of
individuals who, immediately prior to the Effective Time, were directors,
officers, employees or agents of CDT, unless such modification is required by
law.   (b) Prior to the Effective Time, CDT shall purchase a directors\'
and officers\' and fiduciary liability insurance policy providing coverage
for a period of at least six (6) years following the Effective Time (i) for
persons who were officers and/or directors of Belden prior to the Effective
Time and (ii) for persons who were officers and/or directors of CDT prior to
the Effective Time and who are not officers or directors of CDT
immediately following the Effective Time, in each case for claims arising
after the Effective Time from facts or events which occurred at or prior to
the Effective Time, which policy shall provide for at least $30 million of
aggregate coverage on terms and conditions which are no less advantageous to
such covered persons than the directors\' and officers\' and fiduciary
liability insurance policy CDT maintained on the date hereof. Upon the
expiration of the directors\' and officers\' and fiduciary liability
insurance policy maintained by CDT on the date hereof, CDT shall renew such
policy or enter into a replacement policy, which, in either case, shall
provide for at least $30 million of aggregate coverage on terms and
conditions of coverage which are no less advantageous than those provided in
the policy maintained by CDT as of the date hereof.   (c) In the event that
CDT or any of its successors or assigns (i) consolidates with or merges into
any other Person and is not the continuing or surviving corporation or entity
of such consolidation or merger or (ii) transfers or conveys all or
substantially all of its properties and assets to any Person, then, and in
each such case, proper provision will be made so that the successors and
assigns of CDT assume the obligations set forth in this Section 6.5.   (d)
The provisions of this Section 6.5 are intended for the benefit of, and will
be enforceable by, each Indemnified Party and his or her heirs
and representatives, and are in addition to, and not in substitution for, any
other rights to indemnification or contribution that any such Indemnified
Party may have had by contract or otherwise.   55     SECTION 6.6 Fees
and Expenses. Except as set forth in Section 8.3, all fees and expenses
incurred in connection with the Merger, this Agreement and the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement shall be paid by the party incurring such fees
or expenses, whether or not the Merger is consummated, provided that Belden
shall pay any foreign, state or local real estate transfer or similar taxes
imposed on the stockholders of Belden as a result of the
transactions contemplated in this Agreement.   SECTION 6.7 Public
Announcements. CDT and Belden will consult with each other before issuing,
and will provide each other the opportunity to review, comment upon and
concur with, and use commercially reasonable efforts to agree on, any press
release or other public statements with respect to the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement, including the Merger, and shall not issue any
such press release or make any such public statement prior to
such consultation, except as either party may determine is required by
Applicable Law, court process or by obligations pursuant to any listing
agreement with any national securities exchange or stock market.   SECTION
6.8 Listing. CDT shall use all commercially reasonable efforts to cause the
CDT Common Stock issuable under Article II and those shares of CDT Common
Stock required to be reserved for issuance upon exercise of any
Belden Options assumed by CDT hereunder to be authorized for listing on the
NYSE, upon official notice of issuance.   SECTION 6.9 Tax-Free
Reorganization Treatment. Belden and CDT intend that the Merger will qualify
as a reorganization within the meaning of Section 368(a) of the Code, and
each shall, and shall cause its respective Subsidiaries to, use its
reasonable best efforts to cause the Merger to so qualify. Neither Belden nor
CDT shall knowingly take any action, cause any action to be taken, fail
to take any commercially reasonable action or cause any commercially
reasonable action to fail to be taken, which action or failure to act would
reasonably be expected to (i) prevent the Merger from qualifying as a
reorganization within the meaning of Section 368 of the Code or (ii) cause
Belden, Merger Sub or CDT to be unable to make the representations necessary
for counsel to render the tax opinions referred to in Section 7.1(g).  
SECTION 6.10 Conveyance Taxes. CDT and Belden shall cooperate in
the preparation, execution and filing of all returns, questionnaires,
applications or other documents regarding any real property transfer or
gains, sales, use, transfer, value added, stock transfer and stamp taxes, any
transfer, recording, registration and other fees or any similar taxes which
become payable in connection with the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement that are required or permitted to be filed on or before the
Effective Time.   SECTION 6.11 Equity Awards and Employee Benefits.   (a)
At the Effective Time and subject to the satisfaction of the condition set
forth in Section 7.2(e), each then outstanding Belden Option, whether or
not exercisable at the Effective Time, will be assumed by CDT. Each Belden
Option so assumed by CDT under this Agreement will continue to have, and be
subject to, the same terms and conditions set forth in the applicable Belden
Option (including any Belden Stock Plan under which such Belden Option was
issued and any applicable stock option agreement or other document evidencing
such Belden Option) immediately prior to the Effective Time, except that (i)
each Belden Option will be exercisable   56    for that number of whole
shares of CDT Common Stock equal to the product of the number of shares of
Belden Common Stock that were issuable upon exercise of such Belden Option
immediately prior to the Effective Time multiplied by the Exchange Ratio,
rounded down to the nearest whole number of shares of CDT Common Stock, (ii)
the per share exercise price for the shares of CDT Common Stock issuable upon
exercise of such assumed Belden Option will be equal to the
quotient determined by dividing the exercise price per share of such Belden
Option by the Exchange Ratio, rounded up to the nearest whole cent and (iii)
as of the Effective Time or such earlier time as provided in any Belden Stock
Plan as in effect on the date hereof, all Belden Stock Options issued under a
Belden Stock Plan which are either outstanding as of the date hereof or
issued as permitted under this Agreement prior to the Effective Time shall
vest in their entirety and become exercisable under the terms of such Belden
Stock Plan. As of the Effective Time, all references in the Belden Stock
Plans to Belden Common Stock shall thereafter be deemed to be references to
CDT Common Stock. As soon as reasonably practicable following the Effective
Time, CDT will issue to each holder of an assumed Belden Option a document
evidencing the foregoing assumption of such Belden Option by CDT. As soon as
reasonably practicable following the Effective time, but in no event later
than 10 days following the Effective Time, CDT shall file a registration
statement under the Securities Act on Form S-8 or another appropriate form
(and use its commercially reasonable efforts to maintain the effectiveness
thereof and maintain the current status of the prospectuses contained
therein) with respect to (i) Belden Options assumed by CDT pursuant hereto
and (ii) the shares of restricted CDT Common Stock contemplated by Section
6.11(c) or as set forth in Section 5.1(b) of the CDT Disclosure Schedule or
Section 5.1(b) of the Belden Disclosure Schedule, shall use its commercially
reasonable efforts to cause such registration statement to remain in effect
for so long as such assumed Belden Option shall remain outstanding and such
shares of restricted stock shall remain issuable or outstanding. Prior to the
Effective Time, CDT shall take all corporate action necessary to reserve for
issuance a sufficient number of shares of CDT Common Stock for delivery in
connection with the exercise of the converted Belden Options. The parties
shall use their commercially reasonable efforts to ensure that the conversion
of any Belden Options which are intended to be "incentive stock options" (as
defined in Section 422 of the Code) provided for in this Section 6.11(a)
shall be effected in a manner consistent with Section 424(a) of the Code.  
(b) Belden shall use reasonable best efforts to amend or supplement
the Belden Stock Plans, or seek waivers from any holder of outstanding
Belden Options, as necessary to provide that each Belden Option outstanding
immediately prior to the Effective Time shall be treated as set forth in
Section 6.11(a).   (c) As of the Effective Time, any restrictions or
limitations on transfer with respect to shares of restricted Belden Common
Stock issued under the Belden Stock Plans shall terminate or lapse and shall
not apply to any shares of CDT Common Stock issued in exchange for such
Belden Common Stock hereunder, so that such shares of CDT Common Stock shall
be freely transferable, subject to applicable securities laws. In addition,
Belden shall terminate the Belden Purchase Plans immediately prior to the
Effective Time. To the extent any offering period under the Belden Purchase
Plans is in progress prior to such termination, Belden shall ensure that such
offering period ends immediately prior to such termination, and that each
participant\'s accumulated contributions (including all contributions made
after the date hereof in accordance with the terms of the Belden Purchase
Plans) for such offering period are applied towards the purchase of Belden
Common Stock immediately prior to such termination unless the participant  
57    has previously withdrawn from such offering period in accordance
with the terms of such plan. Furthermore, as soon as reasonably practicable
after the Effective Time, all Continuing Employees (as defined in Section
6.11(f)) shall be permitted to participate in the CDT Purchase Plan in
accordance with the terms of such plan.   (d) At the Effective Time, each
then outstanding CDT Option will continue to have, and be subject to, the
terms and conditions thereof immediately prior to the Effective Time, except
that as of the Effective Time or such earlier time as provided in any CDT
Stock Plan as in effect on the date hereof, all CDT Stock Options issued
under a CDT Stock Plan which are either outstanding as of the date hereof or
issued as permitted under this Agreement prior to the Effective Time shall
vest in their entirety and become exercisable under the terms of such CDT
Stock Plan.   (e) As of the Effective Time, any restrictions or limitations
on transfer with respect to shares of restricted CDT Common Stock issued
under the CDT Stock Plans shall terminate or lapse, so that such shares of
CDT Common Stock shall be freely transferable, subject to applicable
securities laws.   (f) For one year following the Effective Time, CDT shall
provide or cause to be provided to those of its employees and employees of
the Surviving Corporation or any other Affiliate of CDT who were employees of
Belden or any of its Subsidiaries immediately prior to the Effective Time
("Continuing Employees"), employee welfare benefits that, in the aggregate,
are no less favorable than the employee welfare benefits package provided to
those Continuing Employees by Belden or any of its Subsidiaries immediately
prior to the execution of this Agreement.   (g) Following the Effective
Time, CDT shall recognize (or cause to be recognized) the service of each
Continuing Employee with Belden or any of its Subsidiaries for purposes of
(i) eligibility and vesting under any CDT Benefit Plan, (ii) determination of
benefits levels under any vacation or severance CDT Benefit Plan and (iii)
determination of "retiree" status under any CDT Benefit Plan, for which the
Continuing Employee is otherwise eligible and in which the Continuing
Employee is offered participation, in each case except where such crediting
would result in a duplication of benefits. To the extent CDT establishes or
designates a CDT Benefit Plan to provide group health benefits to Continuing
Employees, (x) each such CDT Benefit Plan shall waive pre-existing condition
limitations with respect to Continuing Employees to the same extent waived or
no longer applicable under the applicable group health plan of Belden and (y)
each Continuing Employee shall be given credit under the applicable
CDT Benefit Plan for amounts paid under the corresponding group health plan
of Belden or an Affiliate during the plan year in which the Effective Time
occurs for purposes of applying deductibles, co-payments and out-of-pocket
maximums for such plan year.   (h) Subject to Section 6.11(i), as of the
Effective Time, CDT shall assume and agree to perform in accordance with
their terms (i) all employment, severance and other compensation agreements
and arrangements existing as of the date hereof (and provided to CDT by
Belden prior to the date hereof) between Belden or any of its Subsidiaries
and any director, officer or employee thereof, and (ii) any such agreements
or arrangements entered into after the date hereof   58    and prior to
the Effective Time by Belden or any of its Subsidiaries in compliance with
the terms of this Agreement.   (i) Belden shall use its reasonable best
efforts to enter into and obtain written waivers reasonably acceptable to CDT
to the Change of Control Employment Agreements by and between Belden and
certain officers of Belden set forth in Schedule 6.11(i) upon the terms set
forth in Schedule 6.11(i) as soon as reasonably practicable, but in no event
later than the date upon which the Form S-4 is first filed with the SEC.
Belden shall promptly notify CDT of the execution of any such waiver
contemplated by Schedule 6.11(i) and shall provide an executed copy thereof
to CDT as soon as reasonably practicable thereafter. If Belden shall be
unable to obtain any of the written waivers contemplated by Schedule 6.11(i)
by the date upon which the Form S-4 is first filed with the SEC, Belden shall
promptly consult with CDT and the parties shall take all reasonable actions
to minimize the payments that may become payable under such Change of Control
Employment Agreements.   (j) The trust created by the Trust Agreement, dated
January 1, 1998, by and between Belden Wire and Cable Company and Bankers Trust
Company, shall be amended by the parties thereto in accordance with the terms
thereof as soon as reasonably practicable, but in no event later than the
date upon which the Form S-4 is first filed with the SEC, which amendment
shall provide that neither this Agreement nor any of the transactions
contemplated hereby shall or shall be deemed to give rise to or result in any
obligations thereunder of any party hereto or any of its respective
Subsidiaries.   SECTION 6.12 Consents of Accountants. Belden and CDT will
each use commercially reasonable efforts to cause to be delivered to each
other consents from their respective independent auditors, dated the date on
which the Form S-4 is filed with the SEC, is amended or supplemented, or
becomes effective or a date not more than two (2) days prior to such date, in
form reasonably satisfactory to the recipient and customary in scope and
substance for consents delivered by independent public accountants in
connection with registration statements on Form S-4 under the Securities
Act.   SECTION 6.13 Directors and Officers of CDT. The Board of Directors of
CDT shall take all action within its power so that:   (a) immediately
following the Effective Time, the (i) Board of Directors of CDT shall consist
of ten (10) directors, who shall be Lorne D. Bain, Christopher I. Byrnes, C.
Baker Cunningham, John M. Monter and Bernard G. Rethore (collectively the
"Belden Designated Directors") and Lance C. Balk, Bryan C. Cressey, Glenn
Kalnasy, Ferdinand C. Kuznik and Michael F.O. Harris (collectively the "CDT

expiring at CDT\'s first annual meeting of stockholders following the Closing
Date and (ii) the Chairman of the Board of Directors of CDT shall be Bryan C.
Cressey, who shall serve in such capacity until the first annual meeting
following the Closing Date;   (b) immediately following the Effective Time,
each committee of the Board of Directors shall be comprised of an equal
number of Belden Designated Directors and CDT Designated Directors;  
59     (c) immediately following the Effective Time, the persons named on
Schedule 6.13(c) hereto shall be appointed to, or continue to serve in, the
respective offices set forth thereon and shall have the duties set forth on
such schedule opposite such offices; and   (d) immediately following the
Effective Time, the CDT Bylaws shall be amended, effective at the Effective
Time, to provide that, until the third (3rd) anniversary of the Effective
Time, the affirmative vote, at a duly convened meeting of CDT\'s Board of
Directors, of at least seventy percent (70%) of CDT\'s entire Board of

Schedule 6.13(c) from his  respective position as set forth on such schedule,
or significantly  diminish his position, authority, duties or
responsibilities;   (ii) remove any director from CDT\'s Board of
Directors;   (iii) approve or recommend a merger (other than a merger of a 
wholly-owned Subsidiary of CDT with and into CDT), consolidation,

substantial portion of the assets of CDT and its Subsidiaries, taken as a 
whole;   (iv) acquire, by purchase, merger or otherwise, in one transaction
or  a series of related transactions, any equity or other ownership

$100,000,000;   (v) authorize for issuance or issue any equity securities or

compensation  plan approved by CDT\'s Board of Directors or compensation
committee thereof  or (B) any refinancing of existing indebtedness;   (vi)
purchase, redeem, prepay, acquire or retire for value any shares  of CDT\'s
capital stock or securities exercisable for or convertible into  shares of

principal amount not exceeding the principal amount so  refinanced and on
financial and other terms no less favorable to CDT than  such outstanding
Indebtedness); or   (ix) amend or modify, or adopt a by-law, or approve or
recommend to  the holders of CDT Common Stock any amendment to the CDT By-
Laws or the CDT  Charter, that is inconsistent with, the provisions of

(e) immediately following the Effective Time, the CDT Bylaws shall
be amended, effective at the Effective Time, to provide that, until the third
(3rd) anniversary of the Effective Time:   (i) the Board of Directors shall
consist of ten (10) directors;   (ii) if any Belden Designated Director

a list of those Persons who are, in Belden\'s reasonable judgment,
"affiliates" of Belden within the meaning of Rule 145 promulgated under the
Securities Act ("Rule 145 Affiliates"). Belden shall notify CDT in writing
regarding any change in the identity of its Rule 145 Affiliates prior to the
Closing Date. CDT shall be entitled to place appropriate legends on
the certificates evidencing any shares of CDT Common Stock to be received by
Rule 145 Affiliates in the Merger reflecting the restrictions set forth in
Rule 145 promulgated under the Securities Act and to issue appropriate stop
transfer instructions to the transfer agent for CDT Common Stock (provided
that such legends or stop transfer instructions shall be removed one year
after the Effective Time upon the request of any holder of shares of CDT
Common Stock issued in the Merger if such holder is not then a Rule 145
Affiliate).   SECTION 6.15 Notification of Certain Matters. Belden shall
give prompt notice to CDT, and CDT shall give prompt notice to Belden, of (a)
the occurrence, or failure to occur, of any event, which occurrence or
failure to occur would reasonably be likely to cause (i) any representation
or warranty of such party contained in this Agreement that is qualified as to
"materiality" or "Material Adverse Effect" to be untrue or inaccurate in any
respect or (ii) any other representation or warranty of such party contained
in this Agreement to be untrue or inaccurate in any material respect, in each
case at any time from and after the date of this Agreement until the
Effective Time, (b) any material failure of Belden and the Merger Sub or CDT,
as the case may be, or of any officer, director, employee or agent thereof,

with or satisfied by it under this Agreement, (c) any event occurring on or
after the date hereof that would have been required to be disclosed pursuant
to Article III or IV had such event occurred prior to the execution hereof,
or (d) any change in circumstances regarding CDT or Belden, as the case may
be, that comes to the attention of any person included in the definition of

that is materially more negative than that included in such party\'s most
recently filed periodic report. In addition, Belden shall give prompt notice
to CDT and CDT shall give prompt notice to Belden of any change or event
having, or which would reasonably be likely to have, a Material Adverse
Effect on such party or which would be reasonably likely to result in the
failure of any of the conditions set forth in Article VII to be

party of any material correction to any of the CDT SEC Documents or the
Belden SEC Documents, as the case may be, from and after the date hereof.

available hereunder to the party receiving such notice or the conditions to
such party\'s obligation to consummate the Merger.   SECTION 6.16 Section
16 Matters. Prior to the Effective Time, CDT and Belden shall use all
reasonable efforts to approve in advance in accordance with the procedures
set forth in Rule 16b-3 promulgated under the Exchange Act and the Skadden,
Arps, Slate, Meagher and Flom LLP SEC No-Action Letter (January 12, 1999) any
dispositions of Belden securities (including derivative securities with
respect to Belden securities) to or acquisitions of CDT securities (including
derivative securities with respect to CDT securities) resulting from the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement by each officer or director
of CDT or Belden who is subject to Section 16 of the Exchange Act (or who
will become subject to Section 16 of the Exchange Act as a result of the
transactions contemplated hereby) with respect to equity securities of Belden
or CDT.   SECTION 6.17 Rights Plans; State Takeover Laws.   (a) Prior to
the Effective Time, neither CDT nor Belden shall redeem the CDT Rights or the
Belden Rights or amend, modify (other than to delay any "distribution date"
therein or to render the CDT Rights or the Belden Rights inapplicable to the
Merger or any action permitted under this Agreement) or terminate the CDT
Rights Agreement or the Belden Rights Agreements unless (i) required to do so
by order of a court of competent jurisdiction or (ii) Belden\'s or CDT\'s
Board of Directors, as the case may be, has concluded in good faith, after
receipt of advice of its outside legal counsel, that, in light of a Superior
Proposal with respect to it, the failure to effect such
amendment, modification or termination could reasonably result in a breach of
its Board of Directors\' fiduciary obligations to its stockholders under
Applicable Law.   (b) Prior to the Effective Time, neither CDT nor Belden
shall take any action to render inapplicable, or to exempt any third party
from, any state takeover law or state law that purports to limit or restrict
business combinations or the ability to acquire or vote shares of capital
stock unless (i) required to do so by order of a court of competent
jurisdiction or (ii) Belden\'s or CDT\'s Board of Directors, as the case may
be, has concluded in good faith, after receipt of advice of its outside legal
counsel, that, in light of a Superior Proposal with respect to it, the
failure to take such action could reasonably result in a breach of its Board
of Directors\' fiduciary obligations to its stockholders under Applicable
Law.   SECTION 6.18 Reservation of CDT Common Stock. Effective at or prior
to the Effective Time, CDT shall reserve (free from preemptive rights) out of
its reserved but unissued shares of CDT Common Stock sufficient shares of CDT
Common Stock to provide for (i) the conversion of the issued and outstanding
shares of Belden Common Stock pursuant to this Agreement and (ii) the
issuance of CDT Common Stock upon the exercise of Belden Options assumed by
CDT under Section 6.11.   SECTION 6.19 Registration on Form S-3. CDT shall
use its reasonable efforts to cause to become effective as soon as
practicable its previously filed registration statement Form S-3 relating to
the offer and resale of the CDT Debentures and the shares of CDT Common Stock
issuable upon conversion of the CDT Debentures by the holders thereof, and
following such effectiveness, shall use its reasonable efforts to keep its
registration statement Form S-3 effective   63    until the Effective
Time. Each party shall also take any action (other than qualifying to do
business in any jurisdiction in which it is not now so qualified or to file a
general consent to service of process) required to be taken under any
applicable state securities laws in connection with the issuance of such
securities and the resale by the holders thereof, and shall furnish to the
other party all information concerning such other party and, to the
extent that CDT possesses such information, the holders of the CDT
Debentures, as may be reasonably requested in connection with any such
action. No filing of, or amendment or supplement to, its Form S-3 will be
made by CDT without Belden\'s prior consent (which shall not be unreasonably
withheld) and without providing Belden reasonable opportunity to review and
comment thereon. CDT will advise Belden promptly after it receives notice of
(i) the time when the Form S-3 has become effective or any supplement or
amendment has been filed, (ii) the issuance of any stop order, (iii) the
suspension of the qualification of the applicable securities for offering or
sale in any jurisdiction, or (iv) any request by the SEC for amendment of the
Form S-3 or comments thereon and responses thereto or requests by the SEC for
additional information. If at any time prior to the Effective Time any
information relating to Belden or CDT, or any of their respective Affiliates,
officers or directors, shall be discovered by Belden or CDT which should be
set forth in an amendment or supplement to the Form S-3 so that such document
would not include any misstatement of a material fact or omit to state any
material fact necessary to make the statements therein, in light of the
circumstances under which they were made, not misleading, the party which
discovers such information shall promptly notify the other parties hereto and
an appropriate amendment or supplement describing such information shall
promptly be filed with the SEC and, to the extent required by law,
disseminated to the holders of the CDT Debentures.   SECTION 6.20 Further
Assurances. At and after the Effective Time, the officers and directors of
the Surviving Corporation will be authorized to execute and deliver, in the
name and on behalf of Belden, any deeds, bills of sale, assignments or
assurances and to take any other actions and do any other things, in the name
and on behalf of Belden, reasonably necessary to vest, perfect or confirm of
record or otherwise in the Surviving Corporation any and all right, title and
interest in, to and under any of the rights, properties or assets of Belden
acquired or to be acquired by the Surviving Corporation as a result of, or in
connection with, the Merger.   SECTION 6.21 Stockholder Litigation. Each of
Belden and CDT shall give the other the reasonable opportunity to consult in
the defense of any stockholder litigation against Belden or CDT, as
applicable, and its directors relating to the transactions contemplated by
this Agreement.   SECTION 6.22 Reverse Stock Split. CDT shall use its
commercially reasonable efforts to take all actions necessary so that all
outstanding options, warrants and other securities of CDT, including, without
limitation, the CDT Debentures, that are convertible into, or exchangeable or
exercisable for, CDT Common Stock shall, from and after the effective time of
the Reverse Stock Split, be convertible into, or exchangeable or exercisable
for, a number of shares of CDT Common Stock that gives effect to the Reverse
Stock Split.   64     ARTICLE VII   CONDITIONS PRECEDENT   SECTION

Each of Belden and CDT acknowledges that the agreements contained in this
Section 8.3 are an integral part of the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement and that, without these agreements, the other party hereto would
not enter into this Agreement; accordingly, if Belden or CDT, as the case may
be, fails to pay in a timely manner the amounts due pursuant to this Section
8.3 and, in order to obtain such payment, the other party hereto makes a
claim that results in a judgment against the party failing to pay for the
amounts set forth in this Section 8.3, the party so failing to pay shall pay
to the other party its reasonable costs and expenses (including reasonable
attorneys\' fees and expenses) in connection with such suit, together with
interest on the amounts set forth in this Section 8.3 at the rate of interest
per annum publicly announced by JP Morgan Chase Bank as its prime rate at its
principal office in New York City, as in effect on the date such payment was
required to be made. Payment of the fees described in this Section 8.3
shall not be in lieu of damages incurred in the event of breach of this
Agreement, subject to Section 8.2. This entire Section 8.3 shall survive any
termination of this Agreement.   (d) Certain Definitions. For the purposes
of this Section 8.3 only, "Acquisition," with respect to a party hereto,
shall mean any of the following transactions (other than the Merger): (i) a
merger, consolidation, business combination, recapitalization, liquidation,

in writing at any time before or after the CDT Share Issuance Approval, the
CDT Charter Approval or the Belden Stockholder Approval; provided, however,
that after the Belden Stockholder Approval, the CDT Share Issuance Approval
or the CDT Charter Approval, there may not be, without further approval of
the stockholders of Belden or CDT, respectively, any amendment of this
Agreement that changes the amount or the form of the consideration to be
delivered to the holders of Belden Common Stock hereunder, or which by  
71    law or NYSE rule otherwise expressly requires the further approval

reference shall be to an Article or Section of, or an Exhibit to, this
Agreement unless otherwise indicated. Whenever the words "include,"

be followed by the words "without limitation." The words "hereof," "herein"
and "hereunder" and words of similar import when used in this Agreement shall
refer to this Agreement as a whole and not to any particular provision of
this Agreement. All terms defined in this Agreement shall have the defined
meanings when used in any certificate or other document made or delivered
pursuant hereto unless otherwise defined therein. The definitions contained
in this Agreement are applicable to the singular as well as the plural forms
of such terms and to the masculine as well as to the feminine and
neuter genders of such term. Any agreement, instrument or statute defined or
referred to herein or in any agreement or instrument that is referred to
herein means such agreement, instrument or statute as from time to time
amended, modified or supplemented, including (in the case of agreements or
instruments) by waiver or consent and (in the case of statutes) by succession

permitted successors and assigns. All references to dollar amounts shall be

Agreement may be executed in two or more counterparts, all of which shall be
considered one and the same agreement and shall become effective when one or
more counterparts have been signed by each of the parties and delivered to
the other parties.   SECTION 9.6 Entire Agreement; No Third-Party
Beneficiaries. This Agreement (including the CDA and the documents and
instruments referred to herein) (a) constitutes the entire agreement, and
supersedes all prior agreements and understandings, both written and oral,
among the parties with respect to the subject matter of this Agreement and
(b) except for the provisions of Section 5.5 (which are intended to benefit
the Indemnified Parties, including Indemnified Parties who or which are not
parties hereto), is not intended to confer upon any Person other than the
parties any rights or remedies.   SECTION 9.7 Governing Law. This Agreement
shall be governed by, and construed in accordance with, the laws of the State
of Delaware, regardless of the laws that might otherwise govern under
applicable principles of conflict of laws thereof.   77     SECTION 9.8
Assignment. Neither this Agreement nor any of the rights, interests or
obligations under this Agreement shall be assigned, in whole or in part, by
operation of law or otherwise by either of the parties hereto without the
prior written consent of the other party. Any assignment in violation of

enforceable by, the parties and their respective successors and assigns.  
SECTION 9.9 Consent to Jurisdiction. Each of the parties hereto (a) consents

such personal jurisdiction by motion or other request for leave from any such

shall not affect in any way the meaning or interpretation of this
Agreement.   SECTION 9.11 Severability. If any term or other provision of
this Agreement is invalid, illegal or incapable of being enforced by any rule
of law or public policy, all other conditions and provisions of this
Agreement shall nevertheless remain in full force and effect, insofar as the
foregoing can be accomplished without materially affecting the economic
benefits anticipated by the parties to this Agreement. Upon such
determination that any term or other provision is invalid, illegal or
incapable of being enforced, the parties hereto shall negotiate in good faith
to modify this Agreement so as to effect the original intent of the parties
as closely as possible to the fullest extent permitted by Applicable Law in
an acceptable manner to the end that the transactions contemplated hereby are
fulfilled to the extent possible.   SECTION 9.12 Failure or Indulgence Not
Waiver; Remedies Cumulative. No failure or delay on the part of any party
hereto in the exercise of any right hereunder shall impair such right or be
construed to be a waiver of, or acquiescence in, any breach of any
representation, warranty or agreement herein, nor shall any single or partial
exercise of any such right preclude any other or further exercise thereof or
of any other right. All rights and remedies existing under this Agreement are
cumulative to, and not exclusive of, any rights or remedies otherwise
available.   SECTION 9.13 Waiver of Jury Trial. EACH OF CDT, MERGER SUB AND

performed in accordance with their specific terms or were otherwise breached.
It is accordingly agreed that the parties shall be entitled to an injunction
or injunctions to prevent breaches of this Agreement and to enforce
specifically the terms and provisions of this Agreement in any federal court
located in the State of Delaware or in Delaware state court, this being in
addition to any other remedy to which they are entitled at law or in
equity.   {REMAINDER OF PAGE INTENTIONALLY LEFT BLANK}   79     IN
