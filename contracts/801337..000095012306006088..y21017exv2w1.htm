</DIV>


<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This AGREEMENT AND PLAN OF MERGER, dated as of April&nbsp;24, 2006 (this &#147;<B>Agreement</B>&#148;), is entered
into by and between Webster Financial Corporation, a Delaware corporation (&#147;<B>Webster</B>&#148;), and NewMil
Bancorp, Inc., a Delaware corporation (&#147;<B>NewMil</B>&#148;).
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;WHEREAS, the Boards of Directors of Webster and NewMil have determined that it is in the best
interests of their respective companies and stockholders to consummate the business combination
transaction provided for herein in which Webster will acquire NewMil through the merger of NewMil
with and into Webster (the &#147;<B>Merger</B>&#148;);
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;WHEREAS, prior to the consummation of the Merger, Webster and NewMil will cause Webster Bank,
N.A., a national association and a wholly owned subsidiary of Webster (&#147;<B>Webster Bank</B>&#148;), and NewMil
Bank, a Connecticut state-chartered savings bank and a wholly owned subsidiary of NewMil (&#147;<B>NewMil
Bank</B>&#148;), to enter into a merger agreement, substantially in the form attached hereto as <U>Exhibit
A</U> (the &#147;<B>Bank Merger Agreement</B>&#148;), providing for the merger (the &#147;<B>Bank Merger</B>&#148;) of NewMil Bank
with and into Webster Bank, with Webster Bank being the surviving bank of the Bank Merger
(&#147;<B>Surviving Bank</B>&#148;) and it is an integral part of and condition to the Merger that the Bank Merger
be consummated immediately after consummation of the Merger;
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;WHEREAS, the parties desire to make certain representations, warranties and agreements in
connection with the Merger and also to prescribe certain conditions to the Merger; and

</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;NOW, THEREFORE, in consideration of the mutual covenants, representations, warranties and
agreements contained herein, and intending to be legally bound hereby, the parties agree as

$.50 per share, of NewMil (&#147;<B>NewMil Common Stock</B>&#148;) issued and outstanding immediately prior to the
Effective Time shall, by virtue of this Agreement and without any action on the part of the holder
thereof, be converted into and exchangeable for that number of shares of common stock of Webster,
par value $.01 per share (&#147;<B>Webster Common Stock</B>&#148;), determined by dividing $41.00 by the Base Period
Trading Price (as defined below), as may be adjusted as provided below, computed to four decimal
places (the &#147;<B>Exchange Ratio</B>&#148;); <I>provided</I>, <I>however</I>, if the Base Period Trading Price shall be greater
than $50.25, the Exchange Ratio shall be fixed at 0.8159; <I>provided</I>, <I>further</I>, <I>however</I>, that if the
Base Period Trading Price is less than $44.85, than the Exchange Ratio shall be fixed at 0.9142.
The number of shares of Webster Common Stock issuable with respect to each share of NewMil Common
Stock, as determined as set forth herein, is called the &#147;<B>Merger Consideration</B>.&#148; For purposes of
this Agreement, the term &#147;<B>Base Period Trading Price</B>&#148; shall mean the average of the daily closing
prices per share for Webster Common Stock for the ten consecutive trading days on which shares of
Webster Common Stock are actually traded (as reported on the New York Stock Exchange) ending on the
third trading day prior to the Closing Date (as hereinafter defined). All of the shares of NewMil
Common Stock converted into Webster Common Stock pursuant to this Article&nbsp;I shall no longer be
outstanding and shall automatically be canceled and shall cease to exist, and each certificate
(each a &#147;<B>Certificate</B>&#148;) previously representing any such shares of NewMil Common Stock shall
thereafter represent the right to receive (i)&nbsp;the number of whole shares of Webster Common Stock
and (ii)&nbsp;cash in lieu of fractional shares (determined in accordance with Section&nbsp;2.2(f)) into
which the shares of NewMil Common Stock represented by such Certificate have been converted
pursuant to this Section&nbsp;1.4(a) hereof. Certificates previously representing shares of NewMil
Common Stock shall be exchanged for certificates representing whole shares of Webster Common Stock
and cash in lieu of fractional shares issued in consideration therefore upon the surrender of such
Certificates in accordance with Section&nbsp;2.2 hereof, without any interest thereon. If prior to the
Effective Time Webster should split or combine its common stock, or pay a dividend or other
distribution in such common stock, then the Exchange Ratio shall be appropriately adjusted to
reflect such split, combination, dividend or distribution.

Stock held directly or indirectly in trust accounts, managed accounts and the like or otherwise
held in a fiduciary capacity that are beneficially owned by third parties (any such shares, and
shares of Webster Common Stock which are similarly held, whether held directly or indirectly by
Webster or NewMil, as the case may be, being referred to herein as &#147;<B>Trust Account Shares</B>&#148;) and

</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Notwithstanding that NewMil believes that it has established all reserves and taken all
provisions for possible loan losses required by GAAP and applicable Laws, NewMil recognizes that
Webster may have different loan, accrual and reserve policies (including loan classifications and
levels of reserves for possible loan losses). In that regard, and in general, from and after the
date of this Agreement to the Effective Time, NewMil and Webster shall consult and cooperate with
each other in order to formulate the plan of integration for the Merger, including, among other
things, with respect to conforming, based upon such consultation, NewMil&#146;s loan, accrual and
reserve policies to those policies of Webster to the extent appropriate. Notwithstanding the
foregoing, NewMil will be under no obligation to implement any portion of the plan of integration
until such time as all Requisite Regulatory Approvals have been obtained.

Notwithstanding any other provision herein to the contrary, no amendment or supplement of the Proxy
Materials or the Registration Statement shall be made without the approval of both parties, which
approval shall not be unreasonably withheld or delayed. Webster will use reasonable best efforts
to allow NewMil to cause the Proxy Materials to be mailed to NewMil stockholders as promptly as

Proxy Materials have been approved by the SEC and the Registration Statement has become effective,

the SEC for amendment of the Proxy Materials or any amendment of the Registration Statement. If at

their respective affiliates, officers or directors, should be discovered by Webster or NewMil,

consents, approvals and authorizations or waivers thereof of all third parties and Governmental
Entities which are necessary or advisable to consummate the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement (including without limitation the Merger). Webster and NewMil shall cooperate with each
other to effect the foregoing. NewMil and Webster shall have the right to review in advance, and
to the extent practicable each will consult the other on, in each case subject to applicable Laws
relating to the exchange of information, all the information relating to NewMil or Webster, as the
case may be, which appears in any filing made with, or written materials submitted to, any third
