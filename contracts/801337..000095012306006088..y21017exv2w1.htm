AGREEMENT AND PLAN OF MERGER 

   

 This AGREEMENT AND PLAN OF MERGER, dated as of April 24, 2006 (this "Agreement"), is entered into by and between Webster Financial Corporation, a Delaware corporation ("Webster"), and NewMil Bancorp, Inc., a Delaware corporation ("NewMil"). 

  

 WHEREAS, the Boards of Directors of Webster and NewMil have determined that it is in the best interests of their respective companies and stockholders to consummate the business combination transaction provided for herein in which Webster will acquire NewMil through the merger of NewMil with and into Webster (the "Merger"); 

  

 WHEREAS, prior to the consummation of the Merger, Webster and NewMil will cause Webster Bank, N.A., a national association and a wholly owned subsidiary of Webster ("Webster Bank"), and NewMil Bank, a Connecticut state-chartered savings bank and a wholly owned subsidiary of NewMil ("NewMil Bank"), to enter into a merger agreement, substantially in the form attached hereto as _Exhibit A_ (the "Bank Merger Agreement"), providing for the merger (the "Bank Merger") of NewMil Bank with and into Webster Bank, with Webster Bank being the surviving bank of the Bank Merger ("Surviving Bank") and it is an integral part of and condition to the Merger that the Bank Merger be consummated immediately after consummation of the Merger; 

  

 WHEREAS, the parties desire to make certain representations, warranties and agreements in connection with the Merger and also to prescribe certain conditions to the Merger; and 

  

 WHEREAS, unless otherwise indicated, capitalized terms shall have the meanings set forth in Section 9.13; 

  

 NOW, THEREFORE, in consideration of the mutual covenants, representations, warranties and agreements contained herein, and intending to be legally bound hereby, the parties agree as follows: 

  

ARTICLE I 
 THE MERGER 

   

 1.1 The Merger. 

  

 Subject to the terms and conditions of this Agreement, in accordance with Delaware General Corporation Law ("DGCL"), at the Effective Time, NewMil will merge into Webster with Webster being the surviving corporation (hereinafter sometimes called the "Surviving Corporation") in the Merger. Upon consummation of the Merger, the separate corporate existence of NewMil shall cease. 

  

 1.2 Effective Time. 

  

 The Merger shall become effective on the date and at the time specified in the certificate of merger (the "Certificate of Merger") as filed with the Secretary of State of the State of Delaware. The term "Effective Time" shall be the date and time when the Merger becomes effective as set forth in the Certificate of Merger. 

  

 1.3 Effects of the Merger. 

  

 The Merger shall have the effects set forth in the DGCL. 

   ##### 

  

     

 1.4 Conversion of NewMil Common Stock. 

  

 (a) At the Effective Time, subject to Section 1.4(b), each share of common stock, par value $.50 per share, of NewMil ("NewMil Common Stock") issued and outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time shall, by virtue of this Agreement and without any action on the part of the holder thereof, be converted into and exchangeable for that number of shares of common stock of Webster, par value $.01 per share ("Webster Common Stock"), determined by dividing $41.00 by the Base Period Trading Price (as defined below), as may be adjusted as provided below, computed to four decimal places (the "Exchange Ratio"); _provided_ , _however_ , if the Base Period Trading Price shall be greater than $50.25, the Exchange Ratio shall be fixed at 0.8159; _provided_ , _further_ , _however_ , that if the Base Period Trading Price is less than $44.85, than the Exchange Ratio shall be fixed at 0.9142. The number of shares of Webster Common Stock issuable with respect to each share of NewMil Common Stock, as determined as set forth herein, is called the "Merger Consideration." For purposes of this Agreement, the term "Base Period Trading Price" shall mean the average of the daily closing prices per share for Webster Common Stock for the ten consecutive trading days on which shares of Webster Common Stock are actually traded (as reported on the New York Stock Exchange) ending on the third trading day prior to the Closing Date (as hereinafter defined). All of the shares of NewMil Common Stock converted into Webster Common Stock pursuant to this Article I shall no longer be outstanding and shall automatically be canceled and shall cease to exist, and each certificate (each a "Certificate") previously representing any such shares of NewMil Common Stock shall thereafter represent the right to receive (i) the number of whole shares of Webster Common Stock and (ii) cash in lieu of fractional shares (determined in accordance with Section 2.2(f)) into which the shares of NewMil Common Stock represented by such Certificate have been converted pursuant to this Section 1.4(a) hereof. Certificates previously representing shares of NewMil Common Stock shall be exchanged for certificates representing whole shares of Webster Common Stock and cash in lieu of fractional shares issued in consideration therefore upon the surrender of such Certificates in accordance with Section 2.2 hereof, without any interest thereon. If prior to the Effective Time Webster should split or combine its common stock, or pay a dividend or other distribution in such common stock, then the Exchange Ratio shall be appropriately adjusted to reflect such split, combination, dividend or distribution. 

   

 (b) At the Effective Time, all shares of NewMil Common Stock that are owned by NewMil as treasury stock and all shares of NewMil Common Stock that are owned directly or indirectly by Webster or NewMil, or any of their respective Subsidiaries, (other than shares of NewMil Common Stock held directly or indirectly in trust accounts, managed accounts and the like or otherwise held in a fiduciary capacity that are beneficially owned by third parties (any such shares, and shares of Webster Common Stock which are similarly held, whether held directly or indirectly by Webster or NewMil, as the case may be, being referred to herein as "Trust Account Shares") and other than any shares of NewMil Common Stock held by Webster or NewMil or any of their respective Subsidiaries in respect of a debt previously contracted (and such shares of NewMil Common Stock, and shares of Webster Common Stock which are similarly held, whether directly or indirectly by Webster or NewMil, being referred to herein as "DPC Shares")), shall be canceled and shall cease to exist and no cash or other consideration shall be delivered in exchange therefor. All shares of Webster Common Stock that are owned by NewMil or any of its Subsidiaries (other than Trust Account Shares and DPC Shares) shall become treasury stock of Webster. 

   

 1.5 Options. 

  

 At the Effective Time, each option granted by NewMil to purchase shares of NewMil Common Stock which is outstanding and unexercised immediately prior thereto shall be converted automatically into a right to purchase shares of Webster Common Stock in an amount and at an exercise price determined as provided below, and otherwise subject to the terms of the 2004 Amended and Restated 

   ##### 

  

    

Stock Option and Incentive Plan for Officers and Key Employees, the 2004
Amended and Restated Stock Option Plan for Outside Directors (collectively,
the "NewMil Stock Plans"): 

  

 (a) The number of shares of Webster Common Stock subject to the option immediately after the Effective Time shall be equal to the number of shares of NewMil Common Stock subject to the option immediately before the Effective Time, multiplied by the Exchange Ratio, provided that any fractional shares of Webster Common Stock resulting from such multiplication shall be rounded down to the nearest whole share; and 

   

 (b) The exercise price per share of Webster Common Stock under the option immediately after the Effective Time shall be equal to the exercise price per share of NewMil Common Stock under the option immediately before the Effective Time divided by the Exchange Ratio, provided that such exercise price shall be rounded up to the nearest cent. 

   

 The adjustment provided herein shall be and is intended to be effected in a manner which is consistent with Section 424(a) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the "Code"). The duration and other terms of the option immediately after the Effective Time shall be the same as the corresponding terms in effect immediately before the Effective Time, except that all references to NewMil in the NewMil Stock Plans shall be deemed to be references to Webster. Nothing herein shall be construed as preventing option holders from exercising the same before the Effective Time in accordance with the terms thereof. 

  

 1.6 Articles of Incorporation. 

  

 At the Effective Time, the certificate of incorporation of Webster, as in effect at the Effective Time, shall be the certificate of incorporation of the Surviving Corporation. 

  

 1.7 Bylaws. 

  

 At the Effective Time, the bylaws of Webster, as in effect immediately prior to the Effective Time, shall be the bylaws of the Surviving Corporation. 

  

 1.8 Directors and Officers. 

  

 At the Effective Time, the directors and officers of Webster immediately prior to the Effective Time shall be the directors and officers of the Surviving Corporation. 

  

 1.9 Tax Consequences. 

  

 It is intended that the Merger shall constitute a reorganization within the meaning of Section 368(a) of the Code, and that this Agreement shall constitute a "plan of reorganization" for purposes of the Code. 

  

ARTICLE II 
 EXCHANGE PROCEDURES 

   

 2.1 Webster to Make Shares Available. 

  

 At or prior to the Effective Time, Webster shall deposit, or shall cause to be deposited, with Websters transfer agent, American Stock Transfer and Trust Company, or such other bank, trust company or transfer agent as Webster may select and is reasonably acceptable to NewMil (the "Exchange Agent"), for the benefit of the holders of Certificates, certificates representing the shares 

   ##### 

  

    

of Webster Common Stock and the cash in lieu of fractional shares (such cash
and certificates for shares of Webster Common Stock being hereinafter referred
to as the "Exchange Fund") to be issued pursuant to Section 1.4 and paid
pursuant to Section 2.2(a) hereof (collectively, sometimes referred to herein
as the "Shares") in exchange for outstanding shares of NewMil Common Stock.
There shall be a written agreement between Webster and the Exchange Agent
in which the Exchange Agent expressly undertakes the obligation to issue the
Merger Consideration as provided herein. 

  

 2.2 Exchange of Shares. 

  

 (a) As soon as reasonably practicable, but no later than ten Business Days following the Effective Time, Webster shall cause the Exchange Agent to mail to each holder of record of a Certificate or Certificates a form letter of transmittal (which shall specify that delivery shall be effected, and risk of loss and title to the Certificates shall pass, only upon delivery of the Certificates to the Exchange Agent) and instructions for use in effecting the surrender of the Certificates in exchange for shares representing the shares of Webster Common Stock and the cash in lieu of fractional shares into which the shares of NewMil Common Stock represented by such Certificate or Certificates shall have been converted pursuant to this Agreement. Upon surrender of a Certificate for exchange and cancellation to the Exchange Agent, together with such letter of transmittal, duly executed, the holder of such Certificate shall be entitled to receive in exchange therefor (x) a certificate representing that number of whole shares of Webster Common Stock to which such holder of NewMil Common Stock shall have become entitled pursuant to the provisions of Article I hereof and (y) a check representing the amount of cash in lieu of fractional shares, if any, which such holder has the right to receive in respect of the Certificate surrendered pursuant to the provisions of Article I, and the Certificate so surrendered shall forthwith be canceled. Webster shall cause the Exchange Agent to issue checks to the holders of the Certificates within ten Business Days following receipt of the Certificate and the letter of transmittal as described above. No interest will be paid or accrued on the cash in lieu of fractional shares and unpaid dividends and distributions, if any, payable to holders of Certificates. 

   

 (b) No dividends or other distributions declared after the Effective Time with respect to Webster Common Stock and payable to the holders of record thereof shall be paid to the holder of any unsurrendered Certificate until the holder thereof shall surrender such Certificate in accordance with this Article II. After the surrender of a Certificate in accordance with this Article II, the record holder thereof shall be entitled to receive any such dividends or other distributions, without any interest thereon, which theretofore had become payable with respect to shares of Webster Common Stock represented by such Certificate. No holder of an unsurrendered Certificate shall be entitled, until the surrender of such Certificate, to vote the shares of Webster Common Stock into which his NewMil Common Stock shall have been converted. 

   

 (c) If any certificate representing shares of Webster Common Stock is to be issued in a name other than that in which the Certificate surrendered in exchange therefor is registered, it shall be a condition of issuance thereof that the Certificate so surrendered shall be properly endorsed (or accompanied by an appropriate instrument of transfer) and otherwise in proper form for transfer, and that the person requesting such exchange shall pay to the Exchange Agent in advance any transfer or other taxes required by reason of the issuance of a certificate representing shares of Webster Common Stock in any name other than that of the registered holder of the Certificate surrendered, or shall establish to the satisfaction of the Exchange Agent that such tax has been paid or is not payable. 

   

 (d) As of the Effective Time, there shall be no transfers on the stock transfer books of NewMil of the shares of NewMil Common Stock which were issued and outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time. If, after the Effective Time, Certificates representing such shares are 

    ##### 

  

    

presented for transfer to the Exchange Agent, they shall be canceled and
exchanged for the Merger Consideration as provided in this Article II. 

   

 (e) All of the shares of NewMil Common Stock exchanged for the Merger Consideration pursuant to this Article II shall no longer be outstanding and shall automatically be canceled and shall cease to exist, and each Certificate previously representing any such shares of NewMil Common Stock shall thereafter represent the right to receive the Merger Consideration for each share of Common Stock represented by such Certificate. 

   

 (f) No Webster stock certificates representing fractional shares of Webster Common Stock shall be issued upon the surrender for exchange of Certificates; no dividend or distribution by Webster shall relate to such fractional share interests; and such fractional share interests will not entitle the owner thereof to vote or to any rights as a stockholder of Webster. In lieu of any such fractional shares, each holder of a Certificate who would otherwise have been entitled to receive a fractional share interest in exchange for such Certificate shall receive an amount in cash equal to the product obtained by multiplying (A) the fractional share interest to which such holder (after taking into account all shares of NewMil Common Stock held by such holder at the Effective Time) would otherwise be entitled by (B) the Closing Webster Share Value. 

   

 (g) Any portion of the Exchange Fund that remains unclaimed by the stockholders of NewMil for six months after the Effective Time may be returned to Webster. Any stockholders of NewMil who have not complied with this Article II prior to such return shall thereafter look only to Webster for payment of cash deliverable in respect of each share of NewMil Common Stock such stockholder holds as determined pursuant to this Agreement, in each case, without any interest thereon. Notwithstanding the foregoing, none of Webster, NewMil, the Exchange Agent or any other person shall be liable to any former holder of shares of NewMil Common Stock for any amount properly delivered to a public official pursuant to applicable abandoned property, escheat or similar laws. 

   

 (h) In the event any Certificate shall have been lost, stolen or destroyed, upon the making of an affidavit of that fact by the person claiming such Certificate to be lost, stolen or destroyed and, if required by Webster, the posting by such person of a bond in such amount as Webster may reasonably direct as indemnity against any claim that may be made against it with respect to such Certificate, the Exchange Agent will issue in exchange for such lost, stolen or destroyed Certificate the cash deliverable in respect thereof.

ARTICLE VI 
 ADDITIONAL AGREEMENTS 

   

 6.1 Regulatory Matters. 

  

 (a) As promptly as reasonably practicable following the date hereof, Webster and NewMil shall cooperate in preparing and each shall cause to be filed with the SEC mutually acceptable Proxy Materials which shall constitute the proxy statement-prospectus relating to the matters submitted to the NewMil stockholders at the Special Meeting and Webster shall prepare and file with the SEC a registration statement on Form S-4 with respect to the issuance of Webster Common Stock in the Merger (such Form S-4, and any amendments or supplements thereto, the "Registration Statement"). The proxy statement-prospectus will be included as a prospectus in and will constitute a part of the Registration Statement as Websters prospectus. Each of Webster and NewMil shall use reasonable best efforts to have the Proxy Materials cleared by the SEC and the Registration Statement declared effective by the SEC and to keep the Registration Statement effective as long as is necessary to consummate the Merger and the transactions contemplated thereby. Webster and NewMil shall, as promptly as practicable after receipt thereof, provide the other party copies of any written comments and advise the other party of any oral comments, with respect to the Proxy Materials or to the Registration Statement received from the SEC. The parties 

    ##### 

  

    

shall cooperate and provide the other with a reasonable opportunity to review
and comment on any amendment or supplement to the Proxy Materials and the
Registration Statement prior to its filing with the SEC, respectively, and
will provide each other with a copy of all such filings made with the
SEC. Notwithstanding any other provision herein to the contrary, no amendment
or supplement of the Proxy Materials or the Registration Statement shall be
made without the approval of both parties, which approval shall not be
unreasonably withheld or delayed. Webster will use reasonable best efforts to
allow NewMil to cause the Proxy Materials to be mailed to NewMil stockholders
as promptly as practicable after the Registration Statement is declared
effective under the Securities Act. Each party will advise the other party,
promptly after it receives notice thereof, of the time when the Proxy
Materials have been approved by the SEC and the Registration Statement has
become effective, the issuance of any stop order, the suspension of the
qualification of the Webster Common Stock issuable in connection with the
Merger for offering or sale in any jurisdiction, or any request by the SEC
for amendment of the Proxy Materials or any amendment of the Registration
Statement. If at any time prior to the Effective Time any information
relating to Webster or NewMil, or any of their respective affiliates,
officers or directors, should be discovered by Webster or NewMil, which
should be set forth in an amendment or supplement to any of the Registration
Statement or the Proxy Materials so that any of such documents would not
include any misstatement of a material fact or omit to state any material
fact necessary to make the statements therein, in light of the circumstances
under which they were made, not misleading, the party which discovers
such information shall promptly notify the other party hereto and, to the
extent required by law, rules or regulations, an appropriate amendment or
supplement describing such information shall be promptly filed with the SEC
and disseminated to the stockholders of NewMil. 

   

 (b) Webster also shall take any action (other than qualifying to do business in any jurisdiction in which it is not now so qualified or to file a general consent to service of process) required to be taken under any applicable state securities laws in connection with the Merger and each of NewMil and Webster shall furnish all information concerning it and the holders of its Common Stock as may be reasonably requested in connection with any such action. 

   

 (c) Prior to the Effective Time, Webster take such action as is necessary in order to list on the New York Stock Exchange the additional shares of Webster Common Stock to be issued by Webster in exchange for the shares of NewMil Common Stock. 

   

 (d) Webster and NewMil will prepare and file all necessary documentation, to effect all applications, notices, petitions and filings, and to obtain as promptly as practicable all permits, consents, approvals and authorizations or waivers thereof of all third parties and Governmental Entities which are necessary or advisable to consummate the transactions contemplated by this Agreement (including without limitation the Merger). Webster and NewMil shall cooperate with each other to effect the foregoing. NewMil and Webster shall have the right to review in advance, and to the extent practicable each will consult the other on, in each case subject to applicable Laws relating to the exchange of information, all the information relating to NewMil or Webster, as the case may be, which appears in any filing made with, or written materials submitted to, any third party or any Governmental Entity in connection with the transactions contemplated by this Agreement; _provided, however,_ that nothing contained herein shall be deemed to provide either party with a right to review any information provided to any Governmental Entity on a confidential basis in connection with the transactions contemplated hereby. In exercising the foregoing right, each of the parties hereto shall act reasonably and as promptly as practicable. The parties hereto agree that they will consult with each other with respect to the obtaining of all permits, consents, approvals and authorizations of all third parties and Governmental Entities necessary or advisable to consummate the transactions contemplated by this Agreement and each party will keep the other apprised of the status of matters relating to contemplation of the transactions contemplated herein. 

     ##### 

  

     

 (e) Webster and NewMil shall promptly advise each other upon receiving any communication from any Governmental Entity whose consent or approval is required for consummation of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement which causes such party to believe that there is a reasonable likelihood that any Requisite Regulatory Approval) will not be obtained or that the receipt of any such approval will be materially delayed. 

   

 6.2 Access to Information. 

  

 (a) Upon reasonable notice and subject to applicable Laws relating to the exchange of information, NewMil shall accord to the officers, employees, accountants, counsel and other representatives of Webster, access, during normal business hours during the period prior to the Effective Time, to all its properties, books, contracts, commitments and records and, during such period, NewMil shall make available to Webster (i) a copy of each report, schedule, registration statement and other document filed or received by it during such period pursuant to the requirements of federal securities laws or federal or state banking laws and (ii) all other information concerning its business, properties and personnel as Webster may reasonably request. Webster shall receive notice of all meetings of the NewMil Board of Directors and any committees thereof, and of any management committees (in all cases, at least as timely as all NewMil representatives to such meetings are provided notice). Webster will hold all such information in confidence to the extent required by, and in accordance with, the provisions of the Confidentiality Agreement. 

   

 (b) No investigation by either of the parties or their respective representatives shall relieve any other party from any breach or violation of this Agreement and shall not have any effect for the purposes of determining the satisfaction of the conditions set forth in Article VII or compliance by NewMil with the covenants set forth in Section 5.1. 

   

 (c) NewMil shall provide Webster with true, correct and complete copies of all financial and other information provided to directors of NewMil in connection with meetings of their Boards of Directors or committees thereof. 

   

 6.3 Stockholder Meeting. 

  

 NewMil shall take all reasonable steps necessary to duly call, give notice of, convene and hold a meeting of its stockholders (the "Special Meeting") within 40 days after the Registration Statement is declared effective by the SEC. The Board of Directors of NewMil shall recommend to NewMils stockholders approval of this Agreement, including the Merger, and the transactions contemplated hereby, together with any matters incident thereto, and shall oppose any third party proposal or other action that is inconsistent with this Agreement or the consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby; _provided, however_ , that NewMil shall not be obligated to so recommend or oppose, as the case may be, and the Board of Directors shall be permitted to modify or withdraw any such recommendation if previously made, if the Board of Directors of NewMil determines in accordance with the terms of this Agreement to enter into a transaction which the NewMil Board of Directors determines is a Superior Competing Transaction or that the fiduciary duties of the Board of Directors under Delaware law prohibit it from fulfilling its obligations under the preceding sentence. Notwithstanding any change in the Board of Directors recommendation, unless otherwise directed in writing by Webster, this Agreement and the Merger shall be submitted to the stockholders of NewMil at the Special Meeting for the purpose of approving the Agreement and the Merger and nothing contained herein shall be deemed to relieve NewMil of such obligation, provided, however, that if the Board of Directors of NewMil shall have changed its recommendation in accordance with this Agreement, then in submitting this Agreement to NewMils stockholders, the Board of Directors of NewMil may submit this Agreement to the stockholders without recommendation (although the resolutions adopting this Agreement and the Plan of Merger as of the date hereof may not be rescinded or amended), in which event the Board of 

   ##### 

  

    

Directors of NewMil may communicate the basis for its lack of a
recommendation to the stockholders in the Proxy Materials or an
appropriate amendment or supplement thereto to the extent required by law. 

  

 6.4 Legal Conditions to Merger. 

  

 Subject to the exceptions set forth herein and applicable Law, each of Webster and NewMil shall use their reasonable best efforts (a) to take, or cause to be taken, all actions necessary, proper or advisable to comply promptly with all legal requirements which may be imposed on such party with respect to the Merger and, subject to the conditions set forth in Article VII hereof, to consummate the transactions contemplated by this Agreement and (b) to obtain (and to cooperate with the other party to obtain) any consent, authorization, order or approval of, or any exemption by, any Governmental Entity and any other third party, or any waiver thereof, which is required to be obtained by NewMil or Webster in connection with the Merger and the other transactions contemplated by this Agreement. 

  

 6.5 Employees. 

  

 (a) To the extent permissible under the applicable provisions of the Code and ERISA and the Webster Bank Employee Investment Plan, Webster shall recognize, solely for purposes of determining eligibility and vesting under the Webster Bank Employee Investment Plan, the service of any employees of NewMil who become employees of Webster or a Webster Subsidiary as of the Effective Time and such service shall also include any service with a predecessor of NewMil to the extent that such service was credited for eligibility and vesting purposes under the NewMil Bank 401(k) Profit Sharing Plan. No service with NewMil or any predecessor of NewMil shall be taken into account for any purpose under the Webster Bank Pension Plan or the Webster Bank Employee Stock Ownership Plan. 

   

 (b) If required by Webster in writing and delivered to NewMil not less than thirty calendar days before the Closing Date, NewMil shall, on or before the day immediately preceding the Closing Date, (i) terminate the NewMil Bank 401(k) Profit Sharing Plan and any other Plan that includes a qualified cash or deferred arrangement within the meaning of Code Section 401(k) (collectively, the "401(k) Plans") and no further contributions shall be made to any 401(k) Plan after such termination or (ii) freeze the 401(k) Plans and no further contributions shall be made to any 401(k) Plan after such freeze; or (iii) cause the 401(k) Plans to be merged into the Webster 401(k) Plan and the participants of the 401(k) Plans shall be governed by the terms of the Webster 401(k) Plan. NewMil shall provide to Webster (i) certified copies of resolutions adopted by the Board of Directors of NewMil (or other such party as may be authorized, under the terms of the Plan, to amend and terminate the Plan), as applicable, authorizing such termination, freeze or merger of the 401(k) Plans and (ii) an executed amendment to each 401(k) Plan in form and substance reasonably satisfactory to Webster to conform the plan document for such Plan with all applicable requirements of the Code, and regulations thereunder, with regard to termination, freeze or merger of the 401(k) Plans, or otherwise relating to the tax-qualified status of such 401(k) Plans. Webster and Webster Bank will not be obligated to make any matching or other employer contributions to any 401(k) Plan or any other plan after the Merger. Obligations of Webster or any Webster Subsidiary, with regard to any 401(k) Plan, shall be limited to those actions which are necessary to terminate, freeze or merge such 401(k) Plan (with the exception of the return of any amounts forfeited under any 401(k) Plan due to the termination of such 401(k) Plan). 

   

 (c) After the Effective Time, except to the extent that Webster or its Subsidiaries continues Plans in effect or as otherwise expressly provided in this Agreement, employees of NewMil who become employed by Webster or any of the Webster Subsidiaries will be eligible for employee benefits that Webster or such Webster Subsidiary, as the case may be, provides to its newly-hired employees generally and, except as otherwise required by this Agreement, on substantially the same basis as is applicable to such newly-hired employees, _provided_ that nothing in this Agreement shall 

    ##### 

  

    

require any duplication of benefits. To the extent permitted under applicable
Law and Websters group health, life insurance and disability plans, and paid
time off plans, Webster will or will cause Webster Bank to (i) give credit to
employees of NewMil, with respect to the satisfaction of the limitations as
to pre-existing condition exclusions, evidence of insurability requirements
and waiting periods for participation and coverage that are applicable under
such plans of Webster or Webster Bank, equal to the credit that any such
employee had received as of the Effective Time towards the satisfaction of
any such limitations and waiting periods under the comparable plans of NewMil
or NewMil Subsidiaries; (ii) give employees of NewMil who become employees of
Webster or a Webster Subsidiary as of the Effective Time and their
beneficiaries credit for amounts paid by such employees and their
beneficiaries under similar plans of NewMil and its respective affiliates
in connection with annual deductible, co-insurance and maximum out-of-pocket
expenses for purposes of satisfying applicable annual deductible, co-
insurance and maximum out-of-pocket expenses under Websters Plans; and (iii)
waive preexisting condition limitations to the same extent waived under the
corresponding Plan. 

   

 (d) NewMil full-time employees, other than any such employee who is a party to any written agreement relating to employment or severance, who (i) are not offered full-time employment with Webster as of the Closing Date or (ii) are offered and accept full-time employment with Webster as of the Closing Date and are subsequently involuntarily terminated (other than for cause) by Webster, shall receive credit for prior employment with NewMil as if such Person was employed by Webster for such period of time in accordance with the terms of the Webster Salary Continuation Policy, attached hereto as Schedule 6.5(d), and shall be eligible to receive severance benefits pursuant to such policy, excluding severance payments with respect to annual incentive or any other bonuses. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained herein, NewMil employees who are offered comparable full-time employment with Webster as of the Closing Date, but do not accept such employment shall not be eligible for severance. 

   

 6.6 Indemnification. 

  

 (a) In the event of any threatened or actual claim, action, suit, proceeding or investigation, whether civil, criminal or administrative, in which any Person who is now, or has been at any time prior to the date of this Agreement, or who becomes prior to the Effective Time, a director or officer or employee of NewMil (the "Indemnified Parties") is, or is threatened to be, made a party based in whole or in part on, or arising in whole or in part out of, or pertaining to (i) the fact that he is or was a director, officer or employee of NewMil or any of their respective predecessors or (ii) this Agreement or any of the transactions contemplated hereby, whether in any case asserted or arising before or after the Effective Time, the parties hereto agree to cooperate and defend against and respond thereto to the extent permitted by applicable Law and the articles of incorporation and bylaws of NewMil as in effect on the date hereof. It is understood and agreed that after the Effective Time, Webster shall indemnify and hold harmless, as and to the fullest extent permitted by applicable Law or the articles of incorporation and bylaws of Webster as in effect on the date hereof (subject to change as required by law), each such Indemnified Party against any losses, claims, damages, liabilities, costs, expenses (including reasonable attorneys fees and expenses in advance of the final disposition of any claim, suit, proceeding or investigation to each Indemnified Party to the fullest extent permitted by law upon receipt of any undertaking required by applicable Law), judgments, fines and amounts paid in settlement in connection with any such threatened or actual claim, action, suit, proceeding or investigation, and in the event of any such threatened or actual claim, action, suit, proceeding or investigation (whether asserted or arising before or after the Effective Time), the Indemnified Parties may retain counsel reasonably satisfactory to Webster; _provided, however,_ that (1) Webster shall have the right to assume the defense thereof and upon such assumption Webster shall not be liable to any Indemnified Party for any legal expenses of other counsel or any other expenses subsequently incurred by any Indemnified Party in connection with the defense thereof, except that if Webster elects not to 

    ##### 

  

    

assume such defense or counsel for the Indemnified Parties reasonably advises
the Indemnified Parties that there are issues which raise conflicts of
interest between Webster and the Indemnified Parties, the Indemnified Parties
may retain counsel reasonably satisfactory to Webster, and Webster shall pay
the reasonable fees and expenses of such counsel for the Indemnified
Parties, (2) Webster shall be obligated pursuant to this Section 6.6(a) to
pay for only one firm of counsel for each Indemnified Party, and (3) Webster
shall not be liable for any settlement effected without its prior written
consent (which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld or delayed).
Webster shall have no obligation to advance expenses incurred in connection
with a threatened or pending action, suit or preceding in advance of final
disposition of such action, suit or proceeding, unless (i) Webster would be
permitted to advance such expenses pursuant to the DGCL and (ii) Webster
receives an undertaking by the Indemnified Party to repay such amount if it is
determined that such party is not entitled to be indemnified by Webster
pursuant to the DGCL. Any Indemnified Party wishing to claim indemnification
under this Section 6.6, upon learning of any such claim, action, suit,
proceeding or investigation, shall notify Webster thereof; _provided, however_
, that the failure to so notify shall not affect the obligations of Webster
under this Section 6.6 except to the extent such failure to notify materially
prejudices Webster. Websters obligations under this Section 6.6 continue in
full force and effect for a period of six years from the Effective Time;
_provided, however,_ that all rights to indemnification in respect of any
claim asserted or made within such period shall continue until the final
disposition of such claim. Webster shall require any successor to expressly
assume its obligations under this Section 6.6(a). 

   

 (b) Webster shall purchase for the benefit of the persons serving as officers and directors of NewMil immediately prior to the Effective Time and who are, as of the date of this Agreement, individually covered by a directors and officers liability insurance policy, a similar directors and officers liability insurance coverage for at least three years after the Effective Time, under either NewMils policy in existence on the date hereof, or under a policy of similar coverage and amounts containing terms and conditions which are generally not less advantageous than Websters current policy, and in either case, with respect to acts or omissions occurring prior to the Effective Time which were committed by such officers and directors in their capacity as such;  _provided however,_ that in no event shall Webster be required to expend pursuant to this Section 6.6(b) more than an amount equal to 300% of the current annual amount expended by NewMil to maintain or procure insurance coverage pursuant hereto. In connection with the foregoing, NewMil agrees to provide such insurer or substitute insurer with such representations as such insurer may reasonably request with respect to the reporting of any prior claims. 

   

 6.7 Subsequent Interim and Annual Financial Statements. 

  

 NewMil will deliver to Webster its Quarterly Reports on Form 10-Q and Annual Reports on Form 10-K contemporaneously with their filing with the SEC. 

  

 6.8 Additional Agreements. 

  

 In case at any time after the Effective Time any further action is necessary or desirable to carry out the purposes of this Agreement, or to vest the Surviving Corporation or the Surviving Bank with full title to all properties, assets, rights, approvals, immunities and franchises of any of the parties to the Merger, or the constituent banks to the Bank Merger, as the case may be, the proper officers and directors of each party to this Agreement and Websters and NewMils Subsidiaries shall take all such necessary action as may be reasonably requested by Webster. 

  

 6.9 Advice of Changes. 

  

 Webster and NewMil shall promptly advise the other party of any change or event that, individually or in the aggregate, has or would be reasonably likely to have a Material Adverse Effect on 

   ##### 

  

    

it or to cause or constitute a material breach of any of its respective
representations, warranties or covenants contained herein. From time to time
prior to the Effective Time, each party will promptly supplement or amend its
disclosure schedule delivered in connection with the execution of this
Agreement to reflect any matter which, if existing, occurring or known at
the date of this Agreement, would have been required to be set forth or
described in such disclosure schedule or which is necessary to correct any
information in such disclosure schedule which has been rendered inaccurate
thereby. No supplement or amendment to such disclosure schedule shall have
any effect for the purpose of determining satisfaction of the conditions set
forth in Sections 7.2(a) or 7.3(a), as the case may be, or the compliance by
NewMil with the covenants set forth in Section 5.1. 

  

 6.10 Current Information. 

  

 During the period from the date of this Agreement to the Effective Time, NewMil will cause one or more of its designated representatives to confer on a regular and frequent basis (not less than monthly) with representatives of Webster and to report the general status of the ongoing operations of NewMil. NewMil will promptly notify Webster of any material change in the normal course of business or in the operation of the properties of NewMil and of any complaints, investigations or hearings (or communications indicating that the same may be contemplated) of any Governmental Entity, or the institution or the threat of litigation involving NewMil, and will keep Webster fully informed of such events. 

  

 6.11 Execution and Authorization of Bank Merger Agreement.

 (b) Promptly after the execution of this Agreement, NewMil shall ask all of its attorneys and other professionals to render current and correct invoices for all unbilled time and disbursements. NewMil shall accrue and/or pay all of such amounts which are actually due and owing as soon as possible. 

   

 (c) NewMil shall advise Webster monthly of all out-of-pocket expenses which NewMil has incurred in connection with this transaction. 

   

 (d) NewMil, in reasonable consultation with Webster, shall make all arrangements with respect to the printing and mailing of the Proxy Materials. NewMil shall, if Webster reasonably deems necessary, also engage a proxy solicitation firm to assist in the solicitation of proxies for the Special Meeting. NewMil agrees to cooperate as to such matters. 

  

 6.13 Rule 16B-3 Actions. 

  

 Webster and NewMil agree that, in order to most effectively compensate and retain NewMil Insiders (as defined below) in connection with the Merger, both prior to and after the Effective Time, it is desirable that NewMil Insiders not be subject to a risk of liability under Section 16(b) of the Exchange Act to the fullest extent permitted by applicable law in connection with the conversion of 

   ##### 

  

    

shares of NewMil Common Stock into shares of Webster Common Stock and NewMil
stock options into Webster stock options in the Merger, and for that
compensatory and retentive purpose agree to the provisions of this Section
6.13. Assuming that NewMil delivers to Webster the Section 16 Information (as
defined below) in a timely fashion, the Webster Board, or a committee of non-
employee directors thereof (as such term is defined for purposes of Rule
16b-3(d) under the Exchange Act), shall adopt a resolution providing that the
receipt by NewMil Insiders of Webster Common Stock in exchange for shares of
NewMil Common Stock and of Webster stock options in exchange for NewMil stock

 Subject to compliance with applicable Law, this Agreement may be amended by the parties hereto, by action taken or authorized by their respective Board of Directors, at any time before or after approval of the matters presented in connection with the Merger by the stockholders of NewMil; _provided, however,_ that after any approval of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement by NewMils stockholders, there may not be, without further approval of such stockholders, any amendment of this Agreement which reduces the amount or changes the form of the consideration to be delivered to NewMil stockholders hereunder other than as contemplated by this Agreement. This Agreement may not be amended except by an instrument in writing signed on behalf of each of the parties hereto.
