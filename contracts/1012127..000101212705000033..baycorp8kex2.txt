                    AMENDED AND RESTATED

                AGREEMENT AND PLAN OF MERGER

          THIS  AMENDED AND RESTATED AGREEMENT AND  PLAN  OF
MERGER,  dated  as of September 30, 2005 (this "Agreement"),
is  by  and  among  SLOAN GROUP LTD., a Bahamas  corporation
("Parent"),  SLOAN ACQUISITION CORP., a Delaware corporation
and  a wholly owned subsidiary of Parent ("Purchaser"),  and
BAYCORP   HOLDINGS,  LTD.,  a  Delaware   corporation   (the
"Company").

          WHEREAS,  the  Boards  of  Directors  of   Parent,
Purchaser and the Company have each determined that it is in
the  best  interests  of their respective  stockholders  for
Parent to acquire the Company upon the terms and subject  to
the conditions set forth herein (the "Acquisition");

          WHEREAS, in furtherance of such Acquisition, it is
proposed  that  Purchaser  shall,  and  Parent  shall  cause
Purchaser  to,  make a cash tender offer  (the  "Offer")  to
acquire  all  the issued and outstanding shares  of  Company
common  stock,  par  value $0.01 per  share  ("Shares")  for
$14.19  per  Share (such amount, or any greater  amount  per
Share  paid  pursuant  to the Offer, being  the  "Per  Share
Amount"),  net  to the seller in cash, upon  the  terms  and
subject to the conditions of this Agreement and the Offer;

          WHEREAS,  the  Company's Board of  Directors  (the
"Company  Board")  has  established a special  committee  of
independent directors (the "Special Committee") to  consider
the  Acquisition, and the Special Committee  has  engaged  a
financial advisor to assist the Special Committee;

          WHEREAS,  based  on  the  recommendations  of  its
Special   Committee,  the  Company  Board  has   unanimously
approved the Offer and resolved to recommend that holders of
Shares tender their Shares pursuant to the Offer;

          WHEREAS,  also in furtherance of such acquisition,
the Boards of Directors of Parent, Purchaser and the Company
have  each approved this Agreement and declared that  it  is
fair   and   in  the  best  interests  of  their  respective
stockholders  and  approved the Offer and  the  merger  (the
"Merger")  of  Purchaser  with  and  into  the  Company   in
accordance with the General Corporation Law of the State  of
Delaware  (the  "DGCL"), following the consummation  of  the
Offer  and upon the terms and subject to the conditions  set
forth herein;

          WHEREAS,  in order to induce Parent and  Purchaser
to  enter into this Agreement, certain stockholders  of  the
Company  (the "Stockholders") have entered into  Stockholder
Support  Agreements,  dated as of September  13,  2005  (the
"Stockholder  Support  Agreements"), providing  that,  among
other  things, the Stockholders will (i) tender their Shares
into the Offer and (ii) vote the Shares owned of record  and
beneficially by them in favor of the Merger, if  applicable,
and  the  other transactions contemplated by this Agreement;
and

          WHEREAS, on and as of the date hereof, the parties
to  the  Agreement and Plan of Merger dated as of  September
13, 2005 (the "Original Agreement") have agreed to amend and
restate the Original Agreement in full to read as set  forth
in this Agreement.

          NOW,  THEREFORE, in consideration of the foregoing
and  the  mutual covenants and agreements herein  contained,
and  intending to be legally bound hereby, Parent, Purchaser
and the Company hereby agree as follows:

                          ARTICLE I

                          THE OFFER


          SECTION 1.01   The Offer

          (a)   Subject to the conditions of this  Agreement
and  provided  that  this  Agreement  shall  not  have  been
terminated in accordance with its terms pursuant to  Article
VIII  and  none  of the events set forth in  paragraphs  (a)
through  (k)  of  Annex A hereto shall have occurred  or  be
existing,  Purchaser shall, and Parent shall cause Purchaser
to,  (i) "commence" (within the meaning of Rule 14d-2  under
the  Securities  Exchange  Act  of  1934,  as  amended  (the
"Exchange  Act")) the Offer as soon as practicable following
the  earlier  to occur of (x) the affirmative recommendation
of  the  Vermont Department of Public Service to the Vermont
Public  Service Board ("VPSB") that the consummation of  the
transactions   contemplated  by  this  Agreement   and   the
conversion of the Convertible Notes be approved by the  VPSB
without  a  public hearing and without any material  adverse
conditions,  or restrictions, revocations or limitations  of
rights,  or (y) the final approval of the VPSB, without  any
material adverse conditions, or restrictions, revocations or
limitations   of   rights,  of  the  consummation   of   the
transactions   contemplated  by  this  Agreement   and   the
conversion  of the Convertible Notes (the "VPSB  Approval"),
and  (ii) cause the Offer to remain open until the twentieth
business  day  after such commencement  of  the  Offer  (the
"Initial  Expiration Date").  Purchaser shall be  obligated,
and  Parent shall cause Purchaser, to accept for payment and
pay  for  Shares validly tendered and not properly withdrawn
pursuant  to the Offer, subject only to the satisfaction  of
each  of  the  conditions set forth in Annex A  hereto  (the
"Offer  Conditions").  At the Company's  request,  Purchaser
will,  and Parent shall cause Purchaser to, extend the Offer
after  the  Initial Expiration Date for one or more  periods
not  to  exceed  an  aggregate of 15 business  days  if  the
Minimum  Condition  (as  such term is  defined  in  Annex  A
hereto)  has  not  been satisfied at the Initial  Expiration
Date.   Subject  to  the  prior satisfaction  of  the  Offer
Conditions,   Purchaser  shall,  and  Parent   shall   cause
Purchaser  to, consummate the Offer in accordance  with  its
terms and accept for payment all Shares validly tendered and
not properly withdrawn by 9:00 A.M. Eastern Time on the next
business  day after the expiration of the Offer.   Purchaser
expressly  reserves the right to waive any Offer  Condition,
or increase the Per Share Amount payable in the Offer and to
make  any other changes in the terms and conditions  of  the
Offer;  provided, however, that, without the consent of  the
Company,  Purchaser shall not, and Parent shall  not  permit
Purchaser  to, (i) decrease the Per Share Amount  or  change
the  form of consideration payable in the Offer, (ii) reduce
the  number  of  Shares subject to the Offer,  (iii)  impose
conditions to the Offer in addition to the Offer Conditions,
(iv)  reduce or waive the Minimum Condition, or  (v)  change
the  Offer in a manner adverse to the holders of the Shares.
Notwithstanding  the foregoing, Purchaser may,  without  the
consent of the Company, (i) extend the Offer for one or more
periods  of  not more than 5 business days each  beyond  the
Initial Expiration Date, if, at any scheduled expiration  of
the  Offer,  any  of  the  Offer  Conditions  shall  not  be
satisfied or waived or (ii) extend the Offer for any  period
required  by any rule, regulation or interpretation  of  the
Securities and Exchange Commission (the "SEC") or the  staff
thereof,  applicable to the Offer (provided  that  Purchaser
shall


                              2

<Page>

keep  the  Company  reasonably informed  of  Purchaser's  or
Parent's  contact  with the SEC or the  staff  thereof  with
respect  to  the  Offer).  In addition, if, on  the  Initial
Expiration   Date,   the  sole  Offer  Condition   remaining
unsatisfied  is  the  failure  to  have  received  the  VPSB
Approval,  then  Purchaser shall,  and  Parent  shall  cause
Purchaser  to, extend the Offer from time to time until  the
earlier to occur of (i) November 30, 2005 and (ii) the fifth
business  day after receipt of the VPSB Approval.   The  Per
Share  Amount  shall, subject to applicable  withholding  of
taxes,  be  net  to the seller in cash, upon the  terms  and
subject  to  the conditions of the Offer.  Purchaser  shall,
and  Parent  shall cause Purchaser to, pay  for  all  Shares
validly   tendered  and  not  properly  withdrawn   promptly
following  the acceptance of Shares for payment pursuant  to
the   Offer.   Notwithstanding  the  immediately   preceding
sentence and subject to the applicable rules of the SEC  and
the  terms  and conditions of the Offer, Purchaser expressly
reserves  the right to delay payment for Shares in order  to
comply  in whole or in part with applicable Laws.  Any  such
delay shall be effected in compliance with SEC Rule 14e-1(c)
under  the  Exchange Act.  Purchaser may  extend  the  Offer
after  the  acceptance of Shares thereunder  for  a  further
period  of  time  by means of a subsequent  offering  period
under  SEC  Rule 14d-11 under the Exchange Act of  not  more
than  20  business days to meet the objective that there  be
validly tendered, in accordance with the terms of the Offer,
prior  to the expiration of the Offer (as so extended),  and
not  withdrawn, a number of Shares which, together with  the
25,000 Shares then owned by Parent, represents at least  90%
of  the  then issued and outstanding Shares.  If the payment
equal   to  the  Per  Share  Amount  in  cash  (the  "Merger
Consideration")  is to be made to a person  other  than  the
person  in  whose name the surrendered certificate  formerly
evidencing Shares is registered on the stock transfer  books
of  the Company, it shall be a condition of payment that the
certificate  so surrendered shall be endorsed properly  with
signature  guaranteed and otherwise be in  proper  form  for
transfer, and that the person requesting such payment  shall
have paid all transfer and other Taxes required by reason of
the  payment  of the Merger Consideration to a person  other
than  the  registered holder of the certificate surrendered,
or  shall  have established to the satisfaction of Purchaser
that such Taxes either have been paid or are not applicable.

          (b)   On  the  date of commencement of the  Offer,
Purchaser and Parent shall file with the SEC a Tender  Offer
Statement  on  Schedule  TO  (together  with  all  exhibits,
amendments and supplements thereto, the "Schedule TO")  with
respect to the Offer.  The Schedule TO and the Schedule 13E-
3  (as  defined in Section 1.03 below) shall comply  in  all
material  respects with the provisions of the Exchange  Act,
the  rules  and regulations promulgated thereunder  and  all
other   applicable   Laws,  and  shall  contain   or   shall
incorporate  by reference an offer to purchase  relating  to
the Offer (the "Offer to Purchase") and forms of the related
letter  of transmittal and any related summary advertisement
(the  Schedule  TO,  the Offer to Purchase  and  such  other
documents,  together  with  all  exhibits,  supplements  and
amendments thereto, being referred to herein collectively as
the  "Offer Documents").  Each of Parent, Purchaser and  the
Company  agrees to correct promptly any information provided
by  it for use in the Offer Documents and any Schedule 13E-3
that  shall have become false or misleading in any  material
respect, and Parent and Purchaser further agree to take  all
steps  necessary to cause the Schedule TO and  any  Schedule
13E-3, as so corrected, to be filed timely with the SEC, and
the   other  Offer  Documents,  as  so  corrected,   to   be
disseminated to holders of Shares, in each case  as  and  to
the  extent required by applicable federal securities  laws.
Parent  and Purchaser shall give the Company and its counsel
a  reasonable opportunity to review and comment on the Offer
Documents  and  any Schedule 13E-3 prior to  such  documents
being  filed  with  the SEC or disseminated  to  holders  of
Shares.  Parent and Purchaser shall provide the Company  and
its counsel with any


                              3

<Page>

comments that Parent, Purchaser or their counsel may receive
from  the  SEC  or  its  staff with  respect  to  the  Offer
Documents and any Schedule 13E-3 promptly after the  receipt
of  such  comments  and shall provide the  Company  and  its
counsel with a reasonable opportunity to participate in  the
response of the Parent and Purchaser to such comments.

          SECTION 1.02   Company Action

          (a)   Subject to Section 6.05(c), the Company  (i)
hereby  consents to the inclusion in the Offer Documents  of
the recommendation of the Company Board described in Section
3.04   and   (ii)   shall  not  withdraw  or   modify   such
recommendation in any manner adverse to Purchaser or Parent.
The  Company has been advised by its directors and executive
officers  that they intend to tender all Shares beneficially
owned  by  them to Purchaser pursuant to the Offer  and,  if
applicable, their respective Stockholder Support Agreements.

          (b)  On the date of commencement of the Offer, the
Company      shall     file     with     the      SEC      a
Solicitation/Recommendation  Statement  on  Schedule   14D-9
(together  with all amendments and supplements thereto,  the
"Schedule  14D-9"), which shall (i) comply in  all  material
respects with the provisions of the Exchange Act, the  rules
and regulations thereunder and all other applicable Laws and
(ii) contain the Fairness Opinion and, except as provided in
Section  6.05(c),  the recommendation of the  Company  Board
described  in  Section 3.04.  The Company shall  disseminate
the  Schedule  14D-9 to the extent required  by  Rule  14d-9
promulgated under the Exchange Act, and any other applicable
federal  securities laws.  Each of the Company,  Parent  and
Purchaser   agrees  to  correct  promptly  any   information
provided by it for use in the Schedule 14D-9 that shall have
become false or misleading in any material respect, and  the
Company further agrees to take all steps necessary to  cause
the Schedule 14D-9, as so corrected, to be filed timely with
the  SEC and disseminated to holders of Shares, in each case
as   and  to  the  extent  required  by  applicable  federal
securities  laws.   The Company shall give  Parent  and  its
counsel  a  reasonable opportunity to review and comment  on
the  Schedule 14D-9 prior to such document being filed  with
the  SEC  or disseminated to holders of Shares.  The Company
shall provide Parent and its counsel with any comments  that
the  Company or its counsel may receive from the SEC or  its
staff with respect to the Schedule 14D-9 promptly after  the
receipt  of such comments and shall provide Parent  and  its
counsel with a reasonable opportunity to participate in  the
response of the Company to such comments.

          (c)   The Company shall promptly furnish, or cause
its  transfer  agent to furnish, Parent and  Purchaser  with
mailing  labels  containing the names and addresses  of  all
record holders of Shares and with security position listings
of  Shares held in stock depositories, each as of  a  recent
date,  together with all other reasonably available listings
and  computer files containing names, addresses and security
position listings of record holders and beneficial owners of
Shares.   The Company shall promptly furnish, or  cause  its
transfer  agent to furnish, Parent and Purchaser  with  such
additional   information,  including,  without   limitation,
updated listings and computer files of stockholders, mailing
labels  and  security  position  listings,  and  such  other
assistance  in  disseminating the Offer  Documents  and  any
Schedule  13E-3 to holders of Shares as Parent or  Purchaser
may  reasonably  request.  Subject to  the  requirements  of
applicable  Law, and except for such steps as are  necessary
to  disseminate the Offer Documents and any other  documents
necessary to consummate the Offer or the Merger, Parent  and
Purchaser shall hold in confidence the information contained
in   such  labels,  listings  and  files,  shall  use   such

if this Agreement shall be terminated in


                              4

accordance  with Section 8.01, shall deliver to the  Company
all copies of such information then in their possession.



          SECTION 1.03   Other Actions

other  person required by SEC Rule 13e-3, shall each  timely

(together  with  all amendments and supplements  thereto,  a
"Schedule 13E-3") with the SEC.



                         ARTICLE II

                         THE MERGER

          SECTION 2.01   The Merger

          Upon  the terms and subject to the conditions  set
forth  in  Article VII, and in accordance with the DGCL,  at
the  Effective Time (as defined below), Purchaser  shall  be
merged  with  and  into the Company.  As  a  result  of  the
Merger, the separate corporate existence of Purchaser  shall
cease  and  the  Company  shall continue  as  the  surviving
corporation of the Merger (the "Surviving Corporation").

          SECTION 2.02   Effective Time

          As  promptly as practicable after the satisfaction
or,  if  permissible, waiver of the conditions set forth  in
Article VII, the parties hereto shall cause the Merger to be
consummated by filing a certificate of merger or certificate
of ownership and merger (in either case, the "Certificate of
Merger")  with  the  Secretary of  State  of  the  State  of
Delaware,  in such form as is required by, and  executed  in
accordance  with, the relevant provisions of the  DGCL  (the
date  and  time of such filing of the Certificate of  Merger
(or  such later time as may be agreed by each of the parties
hereto and specified in the Certificate of Merger) being the
"Effective Time").

          SECTION 2.03   Effect of the Merger

          At  the  Effective Time, the effect of the  Merger
shall  be  as provided in the applicable provisions  of  the
DGCL.  Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, and
subject  thereto, at the Effective Time, all  the  property,
rights, privileges, powers and franchises of the Company and
Purchaser shall vest in the Surviving Corporation,  and  all
debts,  liabilities, obligations, restrictions, disabilities
and duties of each of the Company and Purchaser shall become
the    debts,    liabilities,   obligations,   restrictions,
disabilities and duties of the Surviving Corporation.

          SECTION 2.04   Certificate of Incorporation; By-laws

          (a)   At  the  Effective Time, the Certificate  of
Incorporation of the Company shall be amended in the  Merger
to  be  identical  to  the Certificate of  Incorporation  of
Purchaser  as  in effect immediately prior to the  Effective
Time (except that such Certificate of Incorporation shall be
amended  to  provide  the name of the Surviving  Corporation
shall  be  the  name  of  the Company),  and  shall  be  the
Certificate  of  Incorporation of the Surviving  Corporation
until  thereafter  amended  as  provided  by  Law  and  such
Certificate of Incorporation.

          (b)   Unless otherwise determined by Parent  prior
to  the  Effective Time, subject to Section  6.07,   at  the
Effective  Time,  the  By-laws of Purchaser,  as  in  effect
immediately prior to the Effective Time, shall  be  the  By-
laws of the Surviving Corporation


                              5

<Page>

until thereafter amended as provided by Law, the Certificate
of  Incorporation of the Surviving Corporation and such  By-
laws.

          SECTION 2.05   Directors and Officers

          The  directors of Purchaser immediately  prior  to
the Effective Time, together with Frank Getman, shall be the
initial directors of the Surviving Corporation, each to hold
office  in  accordance with the Certificate of Incorporation
and  By-laws of the Surviving Corporation, and the  officers
of the Company immediately prior to the Effective Time shall
be  the  initial  officers of the Surviving Corporation,  in
each case until their respective successors are duly elected
or  appointed  and qualified or until their  earlier  death,
resignation or removal.

          SECTION 2.06   Conversion of Securities

          At the Effective Time, by virtue of the Merger and
without any action on the part of Purchaser, the Company  or
the holders of any of the following securities:

          (a)  each Share issued and outstanding immediately
     prior  to the Effective Time (other than any Shares  to
     be   canceled  pursuant  to  Section  2.06(b)  and  any
     Dissenting Shares (as defined below)) shall be canceled
     and shall be converted automatically into the right  to
     receive  an  amount  equal to the Merger  Consideration
     payable, without interest, to the holder of such Share,
     upon surrender, in the manner provided in Section 2.09,
     of the certificate that formerly evidenced such Share;

          (b)   each  Share  held  in the  treasury  of  the
     Company  and each Share owned by Purchaser,  Parent  or
     any  direct or indirect subsidiary of Parent or of  the
     Company  immediately prior to the Effective Time  shall
     be  canceled and retired without any conversion thereof
     and  no  payment  or distribution shall  be  made  with
     respect thereto; and

          (c)   each  share of common stock, $.01 par  value
     per   share,   of  Purchaser  issued  and   outstanding
     immediately  prior  to  the  Effective  Time  shall  be
     converted  into  and exchanged for one validly  issued,
     fully  paid  and nonassessable share of  common  stock,
     $.01  par value per share, of the Surviving Corporation
     ("Surviving Corporation Shares").

          SECTION 2.07   Treatment of Options

          (a)   Between the date of this Agreement  and  the
Effective Time, the Company shall take all necessary  action
(which  action shall be effective as of the Effective  Time)
to  (i) terminate the Company's 1996 Stock Option Plan, 2001
Non-Statutory  Stock  Option  Plan  and  each  stock  option
agreement  granted  otherwise than under  such  plans  which
shall  themselves constitute separate plans, each as amended
through  the  date  of  this  Agreement  (collectively,  the
"Company  Stock Option Plans") and (ii) cancel,  as  of  the
Effective  Time, each outstanding option to purchase  shares
of  Company  Common  Stock granted under the  Company  Stock
Option  Plans  (each,  a  "Company Stock  Option")  that  is
outstanding  and  unexercised,  whether  or  not  vested  or
exercisable,  as  of such date (in each  case,  without  the
creation  of  additional liability to  the  Company  or  any
Subsidiary).

          (b)   As of the Effective Time, each holder  of  a
Company Stock Option immediately prior to the Effective Time
shall  be  entitled to receive an amount  of  cash,  without
interest,  equal to the product of (i) the total  number  of
shares of Company Common Stock


                              6

<Page>

subject to such Company Stock Option multiplied by (ii)  the
excess,  if  any,  of  the  Merger  Consideration  over  the
exercise price per share of such Company Stock Option  (with
the  aggregate amount of such payment to the  holder  to  be
rounded  to  the nearest cent), less applicable  withholding
taxes, if any, required to be withheld with respect to  such
payment.   No holder of a Company Stock Option that  has  an
exercise  price per Share that is equal to or  greater  than
the  Merger  Consideration shall be entitled to any  payment
with  respect to such cancelled Company Stock Option  before
or after the Effective Time.


          SECTION 2.08    Dissenting Shares

          (a)    Notwithstanding  any  provision   of   this
Agreement to the contrary and to the extent available  under
the  DGCL, Shares that are outstanding immediately prior  to
the  Effective  Time and that are held by  stockholders  who
shall  have  neither  voted  in  favor  of  the  Merger  nor
consented  thereto  in writing and who shall  have  demanded
properly,   in  writing,  appraisal  for  such  Shares   and
otherwise perfected their rights of dissent and appraisal in
accordance  with Section 262 of the DGCL (collectively,  the
"Dissenting  Shares")  shall  not  be  converted  into,   or
represent  the  right to receive, the Merger  Consideration.
Such  stockholders shall be entitled to receive  payment  of
the  appraised  value  of  such  Shares  held  by  them   in
accordance  with the provisions of such Section 262,  except
that  all  Dissenting Shares held by stockholders who  shall
have  failed  to  perfect  or  who  effectively  shall  have
withdrawn  or lost their rights to appraisal of such  Shares
under  such  Section 262 shall thereupon be deemed  to  have
been converted into, and to have become exchangeable for, as
of  the  Effective  Time, the right to  receive  the  Merger
Consideration, without any interest thereon, upon surrender,
in  the  manner provided in Section 2.09, of the certificate
or certificates that formerly evidenced such Shares.

          (b)   The  Company  shall give Parent  (i)  prompt
notice of any demands for appraisal received by the Company,
withdrawals  of  such  demands, and  any  other  instruments
served pursuant to the DGCL and received by the Company  and
(ii)   the  opportunity  to  direct  all  negotiations   and
proceedings with respect to demands for appraisal under  the
DGCL.   The Company shall not, except with the prior written
consent  of  Parent, make any payment with  respect  to  any
demands for appraisal or offer to settle or settle any  such
demands.

          SECTION 2.09   Surrender of Shares; Stock Transfer
     Books


                              7

<Page>

          (a)  Promptly following the Effective Time, Parent
shall  make  available  to  the  Surviving  Corporation  for
deposit  with a bank or trust company designated  by  Parent
before the date of acceptance of Shares for payment pursuant
to  the Offer and reasonably acceptable to the Company  (the
"Paying Agent"), a cash amount equal to the aggregate Merger
Consideration to which holders of Shares shall  be  entitled
upon  consummation of the Merger, to be held for the benefit
of  and distributed to such holders in accordance with  this
Section.   The  Paying  Agent shall  hold  such  funds  (the
"Payment Fund") for delivery as contemplated by this Section
and  upon such additional terms as may be agreed upon by the
Paying  Agent,  the Company and Parent.  If for  any  reason
(including losses) the Payment Fund is inadequate to pay the
cash  amounts to which holders of Shares shall  be  entitled
under the terms of this Agreement, Parent shall in any event
remain  liable,  and shall make available to  the  Surviving
Corporation additional funds, for the payment thereof.   The
Payment  Fund  shall not be used for any purpose  except  as
expressly  provided  in  this Agreement.   Earnings  on  the
Payment  Fund, if any, shall belong solely to the  Surviving
Corporation  and holders of Shares shall have  no  right  to
such earnings.

          (b)    Promptly  after  the  Effective  Time,  the
Surviving  Corporation shall cause  to  be  mailed  to  each
person who was, at the Effective Time, a holder of record of
Shares entitled to receive the Merger Consideration pursuant
to  Section  2.06(a) a form of letter of transmittal  (which
shall  specify that delivery shall be effected, and risk  of
loss  and  title to the certificates evidencing such  Shares
(the  "Certificates") shall pass, only upon proper  delivery
of  the  Certificates to the Paying Agent) and  instructions
for  use  in  effecting the surrender  of  the  Certificates
pursuant  to such letter of transmittal.  Upon surrender  to
the Paying Agent of a Certificate, together with such letter
of  transmittal,  duly  completed and  validly  executed  in
accordance  with the instructions thereto,  and  such  other
documents  as may be required pursuant to such instructions,
the  holder of such Certificate shall be entitled to receive
in exchange therefor the Merger Consideration for each Share
formerly evidenced by such Certificate, and such Certificate
shall then be canceled.  No interest shall accrue or be paid
on  the  Merger Consideration payable upon the surrender  of
any  Certificate  for  the benefit of  the  holder  of  such
Certificate.    If   the  payment  equal   to   the   Merger
Consideration  is  to  be made to a person  other  than  the
person  in  whose name the surrendered certificate  formerly
evidencing Shares is registered on the stock transfer  books
of  the Company, it shall be a condition of payment that the
certificate  so  surrendered shall be endorsed  properly  or
otherwise be in proper form for transfer and that the person
requesting  such  payment shall have paid all  transfer  and
other  taxes required by reason of the payment of the Merger
Consideration  to a person other than the registered  holder
of the certificate surrendered, or shall have established to
the  satisfaction of Purchaser that such taxes  either  have
been paid or are not applicable.  If any holder of Shares is
unable to surrender such holder's Certificates because  such
Certificates have been lost, stolen, mutilated or destroyed,
such  holder  may deliver in lieu thereof an  affidavit  and
indemnity  bond  in  form  and  substance  and  with  surety
reasonably satisfactory to the Surviving Corporation.   Each
of  Parent,  Purchaser, the Surviving  Corporation  and  the
Paying  Agent shall be entitled to deduct and withhold  from
any amounts otherwise payable pursuant to this Agreement  in
respect  of Shares such amount as it is required  to  deduct
and  withhold  with respect to the making  of  such  payment
under  the  Code or any applicable Tax Law.  To  the  extent
that amounts are so withheld, such withheld amounts shall be
treated  for purposes of this Agreement as having been  paid
to  the  holder  of  the  Shares in respect  of  which  such
deduction and withholding was made.

          (c)   At any time following the ninth month  after
the  Effective  Time,  the Surviving  Corporation  shall  be
entitled  to require the Paying Agent to deliver to  it  any
funds which had been made available to the Paying Agent  and
not  disbursed  to  holders  of Shares  (including,  without
limitation,  the  remainder of  the  Payment  Fund  and  all
interest  and other income received by the Paying  Agent  in
respect of all funds made available to it), and, thereafter,
such  holders  shall  be  entitled to  look  solely  to  the
Surviving   Corporation  (subject  to  abandoned   property,
escheat  and  other similar Laws) only as general  creditors
thereof with respect to any Merger Consideration that may be
payable upon due surrender of the Certificates held by them.
Notwithstanding   the  foregoing,  neither   the   Surviving
Corporation  nor  the Paying Agent shall be  liable  to  any
holder of a Share for any Merger Consideration delivered  in
respect of such Share to a public official pursuant  to  any
abandoned property, escheat or other similar Law.

          (d)   At  the close of business on the day of  the
Effective  Time,  the stock transfer books  of  the  Company
shall  be  closed and thereafter there shall be  no  further
registration of transfers of


                              8

<Page>

Shares  on  the records of the Company.  From and after  the
Effective   Time,   the   holders  of   Shares   outstanding
immediately prior to the Effective Time shall cease to  have
any  rights with respect to such Shares except as  otherwise
provided herein or by applicable Law.


                         ARTICLE III

        REPRESENTATIONS AND WARRANTIES OF THE COMPANY

          As  an inducement to Parent and Purchaser to enter
into  this  Agreement,  the Company  hereby  represents  and
warrants to Parent and Purchaser that:

          SECTION 3.01   Organization and Qualification;
Subsidiaries

          (a)   Each  of the Company and each subsidiary  of
the  Company (each a "Subsidiary") is a corporation, limited
liability  company  or  other entity  duly  formed,  validly
existing  and  in  good  standing  under  the  laws  of  the
jurisdiction  of  its formation and has the requisite  power
and  authority and all necessary governmental  approvals  to
own,  lease and operate its properties and to carry  on  its
business as it is now being conducted.  Each of the  Company
and  each  Subsidiary is duly qualified  or  licensed  as  a
foreign  corporation  or  limited liability  company  to  do
business,  and  is  in good standing, in  each  jurisdiction
where  the  character  of the properties  owned,  leased  or
operated  by  it  or the nature of its business  makes  such
qualification  or  licensing  necessary,  except  for   such
failures to be so qualified or licensed and in good standing
that would not have a Company Material Adverse Effect.

          (b)    A  true  and  complete  list  of  all   the
Subsidiaries, together with the jurisdiction of formation of
each Subsidiary and the percentage of the outstanding equity
interests  of  each  Subsidiary owned by the  Company,  each
other  Subsidiary and each other holder of  equity,  is  set
forth  in Section 3.01(b) of the Company Disclosure Schedule
(the "Company Disclosure Schedule").  The Company Disclosure
Schedule  was prepared by the Company and delivered  by  the
Company  to  Parent and Purchaser on September 13,  2005  in
connection with the Original Agreement and remains unchanged
and  is  hereby  re-delivered as of the  date  hereof.   The
Company  Disclosure Schedule continues to be complete,  true
and accurate as of the date hereof.  Except as disclosed  in
Section  3.01(b)  of  the Company Disclosure  Schedule,  the
Company  does not directly or indirectly own any  equity  or
similar  interest  in, or any interest convertible  into  or
exchangeable  or  exercisable  for  any  equity  or  similar
interest in, any corporation, partnership, joint venture  or
other business association or entity.

          SECTION 3.02   Certificate of Incorporation and By-laws

          The  Company has heretofore furnished to Parent  a
complete   and   correct   copy  of   the   Certificate   of
Incorporation  and the By-laws or equivalent  organizational
documents, each as amended to date, of the Company and  each
Subsidiary.  Such Certificates of Incorporation, By-laws  or
equivalent  organizational documents are in full  force  and
effect.   Neither  the  Company nor  any  Subsidiary  is  in
violation  of  any of the provisions of its  Certificate  of
Incorporation,    By-laws   or   equivalent   organizational
documents.

          SECTION 3.03   Capitalization.

          (a)   The  authorized capital stock of the Company
consists of (i) 4,000,000 shares of common stock, par  value
$0.01 per share


                              9

<Page>

("Company  Common  Stock")  and  (ii)  1,000,000  shares  of
preferred   stock,  par  value  $0.01  per  share  ("Company
Preferred  Stock").  As of September 12, 2005,  (i)  571,364
Shares  are issued and outstanding, all of which are validly
issued,  fully paid and nonassessable.  528,641  Shares  are
reserved for future issuance pursuant to outstanding Company
Stock  Options (the "Company Stock Awards") granted pursuant
to  the Company Stock Option Plans.  As of the date of  this
Agreement,   no  shares  of  Company  Preferred   Stock   or
restricted shares of the Company's capital stock are  issued
and outstanding.  Except as set forth in Section 3.03(a)  of
the  Company  Disclosure Schedule,  there  are  no  options,
warrants  or  other  rights,  agreements,  arrangements   or
commitments of any character that are binding on the Company
or  any Subsidiary and that relate to the issued or unissued
capital  stock  of  the Company or any  Subsidiary  or  that
obligate the Company or any Subsidiary to issue or sell  any
shares  of  capital stock of, or other equity interests  in,
the  Company  or  any Subsidiary.  Section  3.03(a)  of  the
Company   Disclosure  Schedule  sets  forth  the   following
information  with  respect  to  each  Company  Stock   Award
outstanding as of the date of this Agreement: (i)  the  name
of  the  Company Stock Award recipient; (ii) the  particular
plan pursuant to which such Company Stock Award was granted;
(iii)  the  number of Shares subject to such  Company  Stock
Award;  (iv) the exercise or purchase price of such  Company
Stock  Award; (v) the date on which such Company Stock Award
was granted; (vi) the applicable vesting schedule; (vii) the
date  on  which  such  Company  Stock  Award  expires;   and
(viii)  whether the exercisability of or right to repurchase
of  such Company Stock Award will be accelerated in any  way
by  the  transactions  contemplated by this  Agreement,  and
indicates the extent of acceleration.  The Company has  made
available  to  Parent accurate and complete  copies  of  all
Company Stock Option Plans pursuant to which the Company has
granted   the  Company  Stock  Awards  that  are   currently
outstanding  and  the  forms of all stock  award  agreements
evidencing such Company Stock Awards.  The Company does  not
presently have and has not previously maintained an employee
stock  purchase  plan.  All Shares subject  to  issuance  as
aforesaid,   upon  issuance  on  the  terms  and  conditions
specified  in  the instruments pursuant to  which  they  are
issuable,  will  be duly authorized, validly  issued,  fully
paid   and   nonassessable.   There   are   no   outstanding
contractual obligations of the Company or any Subsidiary  to
repurchase,  redeem or otherwise acquire any Shares  or  any
capital stock of any Subsidiary or to provide funds  to,  or
make  any  investment  (in  the  form  of  a  loan,  capital
contribution or otherwise) in, any Subsidiary or  any  other
person.   Except  as  set forth in Section  3.03(a)  of  the
Company  Disclosure Schedule, there are  no  commitments  or
agreements  of any character to which the Company  is  bound
obligating  the  Company to accelerate the  vesting  of  any
Company  Stock Award as a result of the Offer or the Merger.
All   outstanding  Shares,  all  outstanding  Company  Stock
Awards, and all outstanding shares of capital stock of  each
Subsidiary have been issued and granted in compliance in all
material  respects with (i) all applicable  securities  laws
and  other  applicable  Laws and (ii) all  requirements  set
forth in applicable contracts.

          (b)   Each  outstanding share of capital stock  or
equity  interest  of  each Subsidiary  is  duly  authorized,
validly issued, fully paid and nonassessable, and, except as
set  forth  in  Section  3.03(b) to the  Company  Disclosure
Schedule, each share that is owned directly or indirectly by
the  Company  is owned by the Company or another  Subsidiary
free  and  clear  of all security interests, liens,  claims,
pledges,  options,  rights  of  first  refusal,  agreements,
limitations  on  the  Company's or any  Subsidiary's  voting
rights,  charges  and  other  encumbrances  of  any   nature
whatsoever.

          SECTION 3.04   Authority Relative to the Transactions

          The  Company has all necessary corporate power and
authority to execute and deliver this Agreement, to  perform
its    obligations   hereunder   and   to   consummate   the
Transactions.  The execution and delivery by the Company  of
this  Agreement and the consummation by the Company  of  the
Transactions  have been duly and validly authorized  by  all
necessary   corporate  action,  and   no   other   corporate
proceedings  on  the part of the Company  are  necessary  to
authorize  this Agreement or to consummate the  Transactions
(other  than,  with respect to the Merger, the approval  and
adoption  of this Agreement by the holders of a majority  of
the  then outstanding shares of Company Common Stock, if and
to the extent required by applicable Law, and the filing and
recordation  of appropriate merger documents as required  by
the  DGCL).   This  Agreement  has  been  duly  and  validly
executed and delivered by the Company and, assuming the  due
authorization, execution and delivery by the  other  parties
thereto, constitutes the legal, valid and binding obligation
of   the   Company,  enforceable  against  the  Company   in
accordance  with  its terms, subject to the  effect  of  any
applicable   bankruptcy,  insolvency   (including,   without
limitation,  all  Laws  relating to  fraudulent  transfers),
reorganization,   moratorium  or  similar   Laws   affecting
creditors'  rights generally and subject to  the  effect  of
general   principles  of  equity  (regardless   of   whether
considered  in  a  proceeding at law  or  in  equity).   The
Company  Board, at a meeting duly called and held, and  upon
the recommendation of the Special Committee comprised solely
of  independent  directors, has unanimously  (i)  determined
that   this  Agreement  and  the  transactions  contemplated
hereby,   including  each  of  the  Offer  and  the   Merger
(collectively, the "Transactions"), are fair to, and in  the
best  interests  of, the holders of Shares,  (ii)  approved,
adopted  and  declared  advisable  this  Agreement  and  the
Transactions (such approval and adoption having been made in
accordance  with  the  DGCL, including, without  limitation,
Section  203 thereof) and (iii) resolved, subject to Section
6.05(c), to recommend that the holders of Shares accept  the
Offer and tender their Shares pursuant to the Offer, and, if
required,   approve  and  adopt  this  Agreement   and   the
Transactions.   To  the knowledge of the Company,  no  state
takeover statute (other than Section 203(a) of the DGCL  and
New  Hampshire RSA 421-A) is applicable to the Merger or the
other Transactions.

          SECTION 3.05   No Conflict; Required Filings and
Consents

          (a)  The execution and delivery by the Company  of
this Agreement do not, and the performance by the Company of
this  Agreement will not, (i) conflict with or  violate  the
Certificate  of  Incorporation or By-laws or any  equivalent

Company   Disclosure  Schedule,  all  directors,   officers,
management   employees,  and  technical   and   professional

employment  during  such employment  and  for  a  reasonable
period  thereafter,  and  none  of  the  Transactions  shall
adversely affect the Company's rights thereunder.

execution  of  this  Agreement nor the consummation  of  any
Transaction shall constitute a default under, give  rise  to
cancellation rights under, or otherwise adversely affect any
of  the  rights of the Company or any Subsidiary  under  any
Material  Contract.   The  Company  has  furnished  or  made
available to Parent true and complete copies of all Material
Contracts, including any amendments thereto.

          SECTION 3.17   Insurance

          (a)   Section  3.17(a) of the  Company  Disclosure

years,  (i) the names of the insurer, the principal  insured
and  each  named  insured, (ii) the policy number,  (iii)  a

Subsidiary  is in material breach or default (including  any
such  breach  or  default with respect  to  the  payment  of
premiums or the giving of notice), and no event has occurred
which,  with  notice or the lapse of time, would  constitute
such   a  breach  or  default,  or  permit  termination   or
modification,  under the policy; and (iii) to the  knowledge
of  the  Company, no insurer on the policy has been declared
insolvent  or  placed  in receivership,  conservatorship  or
liquidation.

          (c)   At no time subsequent to March 31, 2002  has
the  Company or any Subsidiary (i) been denied any insurance

insurance coverage, or (iii) received notice from any of its
insurance  carriers  that  any insurance  premiums  will  be
subject to increase in an amount materially disproportionate
to the amount of the increases with respect thereto (or with

that is the equivalent thereto.

          SECTION 3.19   Interested Party Transactions

          Except as disclosed in the Company SEC Reports, no
director, officer or other affiliate of the Company  or  any
Subsidiary  has or has had, directly or indirectly,  (i)  an
economic interest in any person that has furnished or  sold,
or furnishes or sells, services or products that the Company

3.12 or 3.16 of the Company Disclosure Schedule; or (iv) any
contractual  or  other arrangement with the Company  or  any

("SOX"), neither the Company nor any Subsidiary has arranged
any  outstanding  "extensions of  credit"  to  directors  or
executive officers within the meaning of Section 402 of SOX.

Neither  the  proxy statement to be sent to the stockholders
of  the Company in connection with the Stockholders' Meeting
nor   the   information  statement  to  be  sent   to   such
stockholders,  as  appropriate  (such  proxy  statement   or

referred to herein as the "Proxy Statement"), shall, at  the
date  the  Proxy Statement (or any amendment  or  supplement
thereto) is first mailed to stockholders of the Company,  at
the  time  of the Stockholders' Meeting and at the Effective
Time,  contain any statement that, at the time and in  light
of  the  circumstances under which it was made, is false  or

statements  therein not false or misleading or necessary  to
correct  any  statement  in any earlier  communication  with

good  standing  under  the laws of the jurisdiction  of  its
incorporation   or  organization  and  has   the   requisite

documents as required by the DGCL).  This Agreement has been
duly  and  validly  executed and  delivered  by  Parent  and
Purchaser  and,  assuming due authorization,  execution  and
delivery  by the Company, constitutes the legal,  valid  and
binding   obligation  of  each  of  Parent  and   Purchaser,

limitation,  all  laws  relating to  fraudulent  transfers),
reorganization,   moratorium  or  similar   laws   affecting
creditors'  rights generally and subject to  the  effect  of
general   principles  of  equity  (regardless   of   whether
considered in a proceeding at law or in equity).

obtain  such consents, approvals, authorizations or permits,
or  to  make  such  filings  or  notifications,  would  not,

Adverse Effect and (iii) the VPSB Approval.

          Purchaser has, or shall have, sufficient funds  to
permit   Purchaser  to  consummate  all  the   Transactions,

                    ADDITIONAL AGREEMENTS

          SECTION 6.01   Stockholders' Meeting

          (a)   If  required by applicable Law in  order  to
consummate  the  Merger,  the Company,  acting  through  the
Company  Board, shall (i) in accordance with applicable  Law
and  the Company's Certificate of Incorporation and By-laws,
duly  call,  give notice of, convene and hold an  annual  or
special   meeting  of  its  stockholders  as   promptly   as
practicable  following consummation of  the  Offer  for  the
purpose  of considering and taking action on this  Agreement
and   the   Merger   (the   "Stockholders'   Meeting")   and
(ii)  (A)  include in the Proxy Statement, and,  subject  to
Section 6.05(c) hereof, not subsequently withdraw or  modify
in  any manner adverse to Purchaser or Parent, the unanimous
recommendation of the Company Board that the stockholders of
the  Company approve and adopt this Agreement and the Merger
and  (B)  cooperate with Purchaser and Parent, and  use  its
reasonable   best  efforts  to  obtain  such  approval   and
adoption.    At  the  Stockholders'  Meeting,   Parent   and
Purchaser shall cause all Shares then beneficially owned  by
them  and  their subsidiaries to be voted in  favor  of  the
approval and adoption of this Agreement and the Merger.

          (b)   Notwithstanding the foregoing, in the  event
that  Purchaser  shall  acquire at least  90%  of  the  then
outstanding Shares, the parties shall take all necessary and
appropriate action to cause the Merger to become  effective,
in accordance


                             32

<Page>

with  Section  253  of the DGCL, as promptly  as  reasonably
practicable after such acquisition, without a meeting of the
stockholders of the Company.

          SECTION 6.02   Proxy Statement

          If  approval  of  the  Company's  stockholders  is
required  by  applicable  Law  to  consummate  the   Merger,
promptly  following consummation of the Offer,  the  Company
shall  file  the  Proxy Statement with  the  SEC  under  the
Exchange  Act, and shall use its best efforts  to  have  the
Proxy   Statement  cleared  by  the  SEC  as   promptly   as
practicable.   Parent,  Purchaser  and  the  Company   shall
cooperate  with each other in the preparation of  the  Proxy
Statement and in responding to any comments of the SEC  with
respect  to the Proxy Statement or any requests by  the  SEC
for  any  amendment or supplement thereto or for  additional
information.  Each of Purchaser, Parent and the Company  and
its  respective counsel shall have a reasonable  opportunity
to  review and comment on (i) the Proxy Statement, including
all  amendments  and  supplements  thereto,  prior  to  such
documents  being  filed  with the  SEC  or  disseminated  to
holders  of  Shares and (ii) all responses to  requests  for
additional information and replies to comments from the  SEC
or  the  staff thereof prior to their being filed  with,  or
sent to, the SEC.  Each of the Company, Parent and Purchaser
agrees   to   use   its  reasonable  best   efforts,   after
consultation  with  the  other parties  hereto,  to  respond
promptly to all such comments of and requests by the SEC and
to cause the Proxy Statement and all required amendments and
supplements  thereto to be mailed to the holders  of  Shares
entitled  to  vote  at  the  Stockholders'  Meeting  at  the
earliest practicable time.

          SECTION 6.03   Company Board Representation; Section
14(f)

          (a)   Promptly  upon the purchase by Purchaser  of
Shares  pursuant  to  the  Offer  and  from  time  to   time
thereafter, Purchaser shall be entitled to designate  up  to
such  number  of  directors, rounded up to  the  next  whole
number,  on  the  Company  Board  as  shall  give  Purchaser
representation on the Company Board equal to the product  of
the  total number of directors on the Company Board  (giving
effect  to  the directors elected pursuant to this sentence)
multiplied  by the percentage that the aggregate  number  of
Shares  beneficially owned by Purchaser or any affiliate  of
Purchaser following such purchase bears to the total  number
of  Shares then outstanding, and the Company shall, at  such
time,   promptly  take  all  actions  necessary   to   cause
Purchaser's   designees  to  be  elected  or  appointed   as
directors of the Company, including increasing the  size  of
the  Company Board or securing the resignations of incumbent
directors,  or both.  At such times, the Company  shall  use
its best efforts to cause persons designated by Purchaser to
constitute  the  same  percentage as persons  designated  by
Purchaser shall constitute of the Company Board of (i)  each
committee of the Company Board, (ii) each board of directors
of  each  Subsidiary and (iii) each committee of  each  such
board,  in  each  case  only  to  the  extent  permitted  by
applicable Law and the rules of the American Stock Exchange.
Notwithstanding the foregoing, until the Effective Time, the
Company  shall use its best efforts to ensure that at  least
three members of the Company Board and each committee of the
Company  Board, as of the date hereof, who are not employees
of the Company shall remain members of the Company Board and
of such committees.

          (b)   The  Company shall promptly take all actions
required pursuant to Section 14(f) of the Exchange  Act  and
Rule 14f-1 promulgated thereunder to fulfill its obligations
under  this Section 6.03, and shall include in the  Schedule
14D-9  such information with respect to the Company and  its
officers  and  directors as is required under Section  14(f)
and  Rule  14f-1  to  fulfill such obligations.   Parent  or
Purchaser shall supply to


                             33

<Page>


the  Company, and be solely responsible for, any information
with respect to either of them and their nominees, officers,
directors and affiliates required by such Section 14(f)  and
Rule 14f-1.

          (c)   Following  the  election  of  designees   of
Purchaser  pursuant  to  this Section  6.03,  prior  to  the
Effective Time, any (i) amendment of this Agreement  or  the
Certificate  of Incorporation or By-laws of the  Company  or
any  Subsidiary, (ii) termination of this Agreement  by  the
Company, (iii) extension by the Company of the time for  the
performance  of  any of the obligations  or  other  acts  of
Parent  or  Purchaser, (iv) recommendation  to  the  Company
stockholders or any modification or withdrawal of  any  such
recommendation  in  connection with this  Agreement  or  the
Transactions  or  (v) waiver of any of the Company's  rights
hereunder, in each case, shall require the concurrence of  a
majority of the directors of the Company then in office  who
neither  were  designated by Purchaser nor are employees  of
the  Company  or  any  Subsidiary.  In the  event  that  the
independent directors of the Company Board deem it advisable
in  connection with the Transactions to retain outside legal
counsel,  such  directors shall be entitled to  retain  such
counsel  (not  to  exceed  two outside  law  firms)  at  the
reasonable expense of the Company.



          SECTION 6.04   Access to Information; Confidentiality

          (a)  Subject to applicable Law and confidentiality
agreements,  including  that certain Nondisclosure  and  No-
Trading  Agreement  between  Parent  and  the  Company  (the
"Confidentiality  Agreement"),  from  the   date   of   this
Agreement  until the Effective Time, the Company shall  (and
shall cause its Subsidiaries to):  (i) provide to Parent and
Parent's  Representatives  access,  during  normal  business
hours and upon reasonable notice by Parent, to the officers,
employees,  agents, properties, offices and other facilities
of  the  Company and its Subsidiaries and to the  books  and
records  thereof,  but only to the extent that  such  access
does  not  unreasonably  interfere  with  the  business  and
operations of the Company and its Subsidiaries, (ii) furnish
to  Parent  all monthly and quarterly statements of  revenue
and  expense, earnings, sales, trial balances and such other
similar statements as are regularly and customarily provided
to  senior  management  of  the Company  promptly  following
delivery  to  such  senior  management  and  (iii)   furnish
promptly to Parent such information concerning the business,
properties,  contracts, assets, liabilities,  personnel  and
other  aspects of such party and its Subsidiaries as  Parent
or its Representatives may reasonably request.

          (b)    Each  party  shall,  and  shall  cause  its
affiliates  and  Representatives to,  (i)  comply  with  the
Confidentiality  Agreement as if a party  thereto  and  (ii)
hold in strict confidence as Evaluation Material (as defined
in  the  Confidentiality Agreement) all nonpublic  documents
and information furnished or made available by one party  to
the   other(s)   and   their   respective   affiliates   and
Representatives.

          (c)     No   investigation   pursuant   to    this
Section 6.04 shall affect any representation or warranty  in
this  Agreement of any party hereto or any condition to  the
obligations  of the parties hereto or any condition  to  the
Offer.

          SECTION 6.05   No Solicitation of Transactions

          (a)   The  Company agrees that neither it nor  any
Subsidiary  nor  any Representative of it or any  Subsidiary
will,  directly  or  indirectly, (i)  solicit,  initiate  or
encourage


                             34

<Page>

(including  by way of furnishing nonpublic information),  or
take  any other action for the purpose of facilitating,  any
inquiries or the making of any proposal or offer (including,
without   limitation,  any  proposal   or   offer   to   its
stockholders)   that  constitutes,  or  may  reasonably   be
expected  to lead to, any Competing Transaction (as  defined
below),   or  (ii)  enter  into  or  maintain  or   continue
discussions  or negotiations with any person or  entity  for
the  purpose of facilitating such inquiries or to  obtain  a
proposal  or  offer  for a Competing Transaction,  or  (iii)
agree  to,  approve,  endorse  or  recommend  any  Competing
Transaction  or  enter into any letter of  intent  or  other
contract, agreement or commitment providing for or otherwise
relating to any Competing Transaction, or (iv) authorize  or
permit  any  Representative of the Company  or  any  of  its
Subsidiaries  to  take any such action.  The  Company  shall
notify  Parent as promptly as practicable (and in any  event
within  twenty-four (24) hours) after the  Company  receives
any  oral  or  written proposal or offer or any  inquiry  or
contact  with any person regarding a potential  proposal  or
offer  regarding  a  Competing Transaction,  specifying  the
material  terms and conditions thereof and the  identity  of
the  party making such proposal or offer (including material
amendments  or proposed material amendments).   The  Company
immediately  shall  cease and cause  to  be  terminated  all
existing  discussions  or  negotiations  with  any   parties
conducted   heretofore   with   respect   to   a   Competing
Transaction.  The Company shall not release any third  party
from,  or  waive  any  provision of, any confidentiality  or
standstill agreement to which it is a party.

          (b)   Notwithstanding anything to the contrary  in
this Section 6.05, the Company Board may furnish information
to,  and enter into discussions with, a person who has  made
an   unsolicited,  written,  bona  fide  proposal  or  offer
regarding a Competing Transaction, and the Company Board has
(i) determined, in its good faith judgment (after consulting
with  its  financial advisor), that such proposal  or  offer
constitutes or could lead to a Superior Proposal (as defined
below),  (ii)  determined, in its good faith judgment  after
consulting  with its outside legal counsel (who may  be  the
Company's regularly engaged outside legal counsel), that, in
light of such proposal or offer, the failure to furnish such
information  or enter into discussions would be inconsistent
with  its  fiduciary  duties  under  applicable  Law,  (iii)
provided  written notice to Parent of its intent to  furnish
information or enter into discussions with such person prior
to taking any such action and (iv) obtained from such person
an  executed  confidentiality agreement  on  terms  no  less
favorable  to  the  Company  than  those  contained  in  the
Confidentiality  Agreement (it being  understood  that  such
confidentiality  agreement and any related agreements  shall
not include any provision calling for any exclusive right to
negotiate   with  such  party  or  having  the   effect   of
prohibiting  the  Company  from satisfying  its  obligations
under this Agreement).

          (c)   Except as set forth in this Section 6.05(c),
neither  the  Company Board nor any committee thereof  shall
withdraw  or  modify,  or propose publicly  to  withdraw  or
modify,  in  a  manner adverse to Parent or  Purchaser,  the
approval or recommendation by the Company Board or any  such
committee  of this Agreement, the Offer, the Merger  or  any
other Transaction (a "Change in the Company Recommendation")
or  approve or recommend, or cause or permit the Company  to
enter  into  any letter of intent, agreement  or  obligation
with  respect  to, any Competing Transaction (except  for  a
confidentiality  agreement as provided  in  Section  6.05(b)
above).  Notwithstanding the foregoing, if the Company Board
determines, in its good faith judgment prior to the time  of
the  acceptance for payment of Shares pursuant to the  Offer
and after consulting with outside legal counsel (who may  be
the Company's regularly engaged outside legal counsel), that
the  failure  to make a Change in the Company Recommendation
would  be  inconsistent  with  its  fiduciary  duties  under
applicable Law, the Company Board may make a Change  in  the
Company Recommendation


                             35

<Page>

and/or  recommend a Superior Proposal, but  only  (i)  after
providing  written notice to Parent (a "Notice  of  Superior
Proposal")  advising  Parent  that  the  Company  Board  has
received a Superior Proposal, specifying the material  terms
and conditions of such Superior Proposal and identifying the
person making such Superior Proposal and indicating that the
Company  Board  intends to effect a Change  in  the  Company
Recommendation  and (ii) if Parent does  not  prior  to  the
earlier  of  (A)  three  (3) business  days  after  Parent's
receipt  of  the Notice of Superior Proposal or (B)  if  the
Offer,  as it may be extended, does not remain open  for  at
least three (3) business days after Parent's receipt of  the
Notice  of Superior Proposal, then such time period as  does
exist  prior to the expiration of the Offer and  before  any
acceptance for payment of any Shares, make an offer that the
Company Board determines, in its good faith judgment  (after
consulting  with its financial advisor) to be  at  least  as
favorable  to  the Company's stockholders as  such  Superior
Proposal.   Any  disclosure that the Company  Board  may  be
compelled to make with respect to the receipt of a  proposal
or  offer for a Competing Transaction or otherwise in  order
to  comply with its fiduciary duties under applicable Law or
Rule  14d-9 or 14e-2 will not constitute a violation of this
Agreement.

          (d)   A  "Competing Transaction" means any of  the
following  (other than the Transactions):  (i)  any  merger,
consolidation,   share   exchange,   business   combination,
recapitalization, liquidation, dissolution or other  similar
transaction  involving the Company or any  Subsidiary;  (ii)
any sale, lease, exchange, transfer or other disposition  of
all or substantially all of the assets of the Company or  of
any  Subsidiary; (iii) any sale, exchange, transfer or other
disposition   in   which  the  Company  or  any   Subsidiary
participates  (including taking any action  to  comply  with
Section  203  of  the  DGCL,  but  excluding  typical  stock
transfer   functions)  and  which  results  in  any   person
beneficially  owning  more  than  25%  of  the   outstanding
securities of any class of equity securities of the  Company
or  of  any Subsidiary; or (iv) any tender offer or exchange
offer  that,  if  consummated, would result  in  any  person
beneficially  owning  more  than  25%  of  the   outstanding
securities of any class of equity securities of the  Company
or of any Subsidiary.

          (e)   A  "Superior Proposal" means an  unsolicited
written  bona fide offer made by a third party with  respect
to  a  Competing Transaction (with all percentages contained
in  the  definition of "Competing Transaction" increased  to
50%  for purposes of this definition), in each case on terms
that  the  Company  Board  determines,  in  its  good  faith
judgment  (after consulting with its financial advisor)  and
taking  into  account all legal, financial,  regulatory  and
other aspects of the offer that it deems relevant (including
whether  the person proposing such Competing Transaction  is
reasonably  able  to finance the transaction),  to  be  more
favorable  to  the Company stockholders than the  Offer  and
Merger.

          SECTION 6.06   Employee Benefits Matters

          (a)   From and after the Effective Time and  until
December 31 of the calendar year in which the Effective Time
occurs, employees of the Company and its Subsidiaries  shall
be   offered   participation  in  employee  benefit   plans,
programs,  policies  and  arrangements  that  are  no   less
favorable  in  the  aggregate to those  provided  under  the
applicable  employee benefit plans (as  defined  in  Section
3(3)  of ERISA (excluding plans exempt under Section  201(2)
of  ERISA)),  programs,  policies and  arrangements  of  the
Company and its Subsidiaries in effect at the Effective Time
(collectively,  "Current  Plans"); provided,  however,  that
nothing contained in this Section 6.06(a) shall (i) obligate
or  commit  Parent  or  its  subsidiaries  to  continue  any
particular  Current  Plan after the  Effective  Time  or  to
maintain in effect any particular Current Plan or any  level
or type of


                             36

<Page>

benefits, (ii) obligate or commit Parent or its subsidiaries
to  provide  any  employee of the Company or any  Subsidiary
with   any  equity  compensation  pursuant  to  any   equity
compensation  plans, programs or arrangements  sponsored  or
provided  by Parent or any of its subsidiaries or affiliates
for  the benefit of its employees, or (iii) prohibit  Parent
or  its  subsidiaries from making any changes to any Current
Plans.

          (b)   Parent  will, or will cause the Company  and
the Subsidiaries to, credit each employee of the Company and
the  Subsidiaries as of the Effective Time with such  number
of  unused vacation days and other paid time off accrued  by
each employee with the Company and the Subsidiaries prior to
the   Effective  Time  in  accordance  with  the   Company's
personnel policies applicable to such employees on the  date
hereof,  copies of which have been made available to Parent;
provided that Parent may, in its sole discretion and to  the
extent  permitted  by  applicable  Law,  require  that  such
vacation  and  other paid time off be taken by the  employee
prior to December 31, 2006.

          (c)  Employees of the Company and its Subsidiaries
shall   receive  credit  for  purposes  of  eligibility   to
participate and vesting (but not for benefit accruals  under
any defined benefit pension plan) under any employee benefit
plan,  program  or arrangement established or maintained  by
the  Surviving Corporation for service accrued prior to  the
Effective  Time  with  the Company or any  Subsidiary  under
which  each  employee may be eligible to participate  on  or
after  the  Effective Time to the same extent recognized  by
the   Company  or  any  Subsidiary  under  comparable  plans
immediately prior to the Effective Time; provided,  however,
that  such  crediting  of  service  shall  not  operate   to
duplicate any benefit or the funding of any such benefit.

          (d)   With  respect to the welfare benefit  plans,
programs   and   arrangements   maintained,   sponsored   or
contributed  to  by  Parent or its subsidiaries  immediately
prior to the Effective Time ("Parent Welfare Benefit Plans")
in which an employee of the Company and the Subsidiaries may
be  eligible to participate on or after the Effective  Time,
Parent shall waive, or cause its insurance carrier to waive,
any   limitations  on  benefits  relating  to   pre-existing
conditions  (if  any)  with  respect  to  participation  and
coverage requirements applicable to employees of the Company
and  its Subsidiaries under Parent Welfare Benefit Plans  to
the  same  extent  such  limitations are  waived  under  any
comparable  plan  of  Parent or its subsidiaries  in  effect
immediately prior to the Effective Time and shall recognize,
for  purposes of annual deductible and out-of-pocket  limits
under  its medical and dental plans, deductible and  out-of-
pocket  expenses  paid by employees of the Company  and  its
Subsidiaries  in  the calendar year in which  the  Effective
Time occurs.



          SECTION 6.07   Directors' and Officers' Indemnification
and Insurance

          (a)   The  Certificate  of  Incorporation  of  the
Surviving  Corporation  shall  contain  provisions  no  less
favorable with respect to indemnification than are set forth
in   Article   Ninth   of  the  Company's   Certificate   of
Incorporation  as  in  effect  on  June  30,   2005,   which
provisions  shall  not  be amended,  repealed  or  otherwise
modified  for a period of six years from the Effective  Time
in  any  manner  that  would  affect  adversely  the  rights
thereunder of individuals who, at or prior to the  Effective
Time,  were  directors, officers, employees, fiduciaries  or
agents  of  the Company, unless such modification  shall  be
required by law.


                             37

<Page>

          (b)  Prior to the Effective Time, the Company will
purchase  and  pay for a directors' and officers'  liability
insurance  policy,  or  tail coverage  under  the  Company's
existing   directors'  and  officers'  liability   insurance
policy,  providing  coverage of not  less  than  six  years,
subject   to  substantially  the  same  limits,  terms   and
conditions as the policy in force immediately prior  to  the
Effective Time, with respect to matters occurring  prior  to
the  Effective  Time.  The total cost of the directors'  and
officers'  liability  coverage described  in  the  preceding
sentence  shall  not exceed 225% of the last annual  premium
payable  prior  to  the  date of this  Agreement  which  was
$55,000.  The Company and Parent shall cooperate to seek and
obtain  the insurance coverage contemplated by this  Section
6.07(b)  at  the  lowest  cost for a carrier  of  recognized
financial   standing  (which  shall  include  the  Company's
current  carrier).  If the cost of providing and maintaining
the  insurance  coverage  in accordance  with  this  Section
6.07(b)  would exceed the amount permitted by  this  Section
6.07(b),  (i) the Company shall notify the covered  officers
and  directors and Parent of the amount of such  excess  and
give  the covered officers and directors the opportunity  to
reimburse the Company the amount of such excess, and if  and
for  so  long  as  such reimbursement is made  the  Company,
Parent  and  the  Surviving Corporation  shall  continue  to
provide  and  maintain  insurance in  accordance  with  this
Section  6.07(b); and (ii) if and to the extent the  covered
officers  and  directors  do not reimburse  the  Company  in
accordance with the immediately preceding clause  (i),  then
the  Company  shall  provide (at  no  cost  to  the  covered
officers and directors) the greatest amount of substantially
equivalent insurance obtainable at a total cost of  225%  of
the  last annual premium payable prior to the date  of  this
Agreement which was $55,000.

          (c)    In   the  event  Parent  or  the  Surviving
Corporation or any of their respective successors or assigns
(i)  consolidates with or merges into any other  person  and
shall  not  be  the continuing or surviving  corporation  or
entity of such consolidation or merger or (ii) transfers all
or  substantially all of its properties and  assets  to  any
person, then, and in each such case, proper provision  shall
be  made so that the successors and assigns of Parent or the
Surviving Corporation, as the case may be, shall assume  the
obligations set forth in this Section 6.07.

          SECTION 6.08   Notification of Certain Matters

          The  Company shall give prompt notice  to  Parent,
and  Parent  shall  give prompt notice to  the  Company,  of
(a)  the  occurrence, or non-occurrence, of  any  event  the
occurrence, or non-occurrence, of which could reasonably  be
expected  to cause any representation or warranty  contained
in this Agreement to be untrue or inaccurate in any material
respect  and  (b)  any  failure of the  Company,  Parent  or
Purchaser,  as  the case may be, to comply in  any  material
respect with or satisfy in any material respect any covenant
or  agreement  to  be  complied  with  or  satisfied  by  it
hereunder;  provided,  however, that  the  delivery  of  any
notice  pursuant  to this Section 6.08 shall  not  limit  or
otherwise  affect  the remedies available hereunder  to  the
party giving or receiving such notice.



          SECTION 6.09   Further Action; Reasonable Best Efforts

          Upon  the  terms and subject to the conditions  of
this  Agreement, each of the parties hereto shall  (a)  make

other   required  submissions,  under  applicable   foreign,
federal  or state antitrust, competition or fair trade  Laws
with  respect to the Transactions and (b) use its reasonable
best  efforts to take, or cause to be taken, all appropriate
action,  and  to  do,  or  cause  to  be  done,  all  things
necessary,  proper  or advisable under  applicable  Laws  or
otherwise to consummate and make effective the Transactions,
including, without limitation, using its reasonable

best  efforts  to  obtain all Permits,  consents,  approvals

qualifications  and orders of Governmental  Authorities  and
parties  to  contracts with the Company and the Subsidiaries
as  are  necessary for the consummation of the  Transactions
and  to  fulfill the conditions to the Offer and the Merger;
provided  that neither Purchaser nor Parent will be required
by  this Section 6.09 to take any action, including entering
into  any  consent  decree, hold separate  orders  or  other
arrangements,  that  (i)  requires the  divestiture  of  any
assets  of any of Purchaser, Parent, the Company or  any  of
their   respective  subsidiaries  or  (ii)  limits  Parent's
freedom of action with respect to, or its ability to retain,
the  Company and the Subsidiaries or any portion thereof  or
any   of  Parent's  or  its  affiliates'  other  assets   or
businesses.  In case, at any time after the Effective  Time,
any  further action is necessary or desirable to  carry  out
the  purposes  of  this Agreement, the proper  officers  and
directors  of each party to this Agreement shall  use  their
reasonable best efforts to take all such action.

          SECTION 6.10   Subsequent Financial Statements

than  reports under Section 16 of the Exchange  Act)  to  be
filed with the SEC after the date of this Agreement prior to
any  such filing, it being understood that, in either  case,
Parent  shall have no liability by reason of being  provided
with any such documents.

          SECTION 6.11   Public Announcements

          The   initial  press  release  relating  to   this
Agreement shall be a joint press release the text  of  which
has  been  agreed  to  by each of Parent  and  the  Company.
Thereafter, unless otherwise required by applicable  Law  or
the  requirements  of the American Stock Exchange,  each  of
Parent  and  the Company shall each use its reasonable  best
efforts to consult with each other before issuing any  press
release  or  otherwise  making any  public  statements  with
respect to this Agreement, the Offer, the Merger or  any  of
the other Transactions.

the Effective Time, of the following conditions:

          (a)   Company Stockholder Approval.  If  required,
     this  Agreement and the Merger shall have been approved

     have  enacted, issued, promulgated, enforced or entered
     any  law, rule, regulation, judgment, decree, executive
     order or award


                             39

<Page>

     (an "Order") which is then in effect and has the effect
     of  making the Merger illegal or otherwise restricting,
     preventing or prohibiting consummation of the Merger.

          (c)    Governmental   Authority   Approval.    Any
     material   approval  or  consent  of  any  Governmental

     upon the completion of the Offer, the change in control
     of  the  Company and its subsidiaries, the consummation
     of  the  Merger  or the conversion of  the  Convertible

          (d)   Offer.  Purchaser or its permitted  assignee
     shall  have  purchased all Shares validly tendered  and
     not withdrawn pursuant to the Offer, provided, however,
     that  this  condition shall not be  applicable  to  the
     obligations  of Parent or Purchaser if,  in  breach  of
     this  Agreement  or the terms of the  Offer,  Purchaser
     fails to purchase any Shares that were validly tendered
     and not withdrawn pursuant to the Offer.

                        ARTICLE VIII

              TERMINATION, AMENDMENT AND WAIVER

          SECTION 8.01   Termination

          This Agreement may be terminated and the Offer and
the  Merger  may  be  abandoned at any  time  prior  to  the
Effective  Time, notwithstanding any requisite approval  and
adoption  of  this  Agreement by  the  stockholders  of  the
Company, as follows:

          (a)   if  no Shares have been accepted for payment
     pursuant  to  the Offer, by mutual written  consent  of
     Parent and the Company duly authorized by the Boards of
     Directors of Parent and the Company; or

          (b)   if  no Shares have been accepted for payment
     pursuant to the Offer, by either Parent or the  Company
     on  or after November 30, 2005; provided, however, that
     the  right  to  terminate  this  Agreement  under  this
     Section  8.01(b) shall not be available  to  any  party
     whose  failure  to  fulfill any obligation  under  this
     Agreement  has been the cause of, or resulted  in,  the
     failure of the Shares to have been accepted for payment
     on or before such date; or

          (c)   by  either  Parent or  the  Company  if  any
     Governmental  Authority  shall  have  enacted,  issued,
     promulgated,   enforced   or  entered   any   permanent
     injunction, order, decree or ruling which  is  then  in
     effect and has the effect of making consummation of the
     Merger  illegal or otherwise preventing or  prohibiting
     consummation of the Merger and such injunction,  order,
     decree  or  ruling  shall have become  final  and  non-
     appealable; or

          (d)   if  no Shares have been accepted for payment
     pursuant   to  the  Offer,  by  Parent  if  a   Company
     Triggering   Event  (as  defined  below)   shall   have
     occurred; or

          (e)   if  no Shares have been accepted for payment
     pursuant to the Offer, by the Company if it enters into
     a  definitive  agreement with  respect  to  a  Superior
     Proposal  (other  than a confidentiality  agreement  as
     permitted by Section 6.05(b)); provided, however,  that
     the Company shall


                             40

<Page>

     have first complied with the provisions of Section 6.05
     hereof,  including, without limitation, the  provisions
     of   Section  6.05(c),  and  simultaneously  with   the
     termination  under  this Section 8.01(e),  the  Company
     shall  pay Parent the aggregate amount due pursuant  to
     Section 8.03(b); or

          (f)   by Parent if due to a failure to satisfy any
     Offer  Condition, Purchaser shall have  (i)  failed  to
     commence   the   Offer  as  contemplated   by   Section
     1.01(a)(i) of this Agreement, (ii) terminated the Offer
     without   having  accepted  any  Shares   for   payment
     thereunder or (iii) failed to accept Shares for payment
     pursuant  to  the  Offer within 90 days  following  the
     commencement  of  the  Offer,  unless  such  action  or
     inaction  under  (i),  (ii) or (iii)  shall  have  been
     caused  by  or resulted from the failure of  Parent  or
     Purchaser to perform, in any material respect,  any  of
     their  material  covenants or agreements  contained  in
     this  Agreement, or the material breach  by  Parent  or
     Purchaser  of any of their material representations  or
     warranties contained in this Agreement; or

          (g)   by the Company, upon approval of the Company
     Board,  if Purchaser shall have (i) failed to  commence
     the Offer as contemplated by Section 1.01(a)(i) of this
     Agreement,  (ii)  terminated the Offer  without  having
     accepted  any  Shares for payment thereunder  or  (iii)
     failed  to  accept Shares for payment pursuant  to  the
     Offer within 90 days following the commencement of  the
     Offer,  unless such action or inaction under (i),  (ii)
     or (iii) shall have been caused by or resulted from the
     failure  of  the  Company to perform, in  any  material
     respect,  any  of its material covenants or  agreements
     contained  in this Agreement or the material breach  by
     the  Company of any of its material representations  or
     warranties contained in this Agreement.

For purposes of this Agreement, a "Company Triggering Event"
shall  be  deemed  to have occurred if:   (i)  a  Change  in
Company  Recommendation shall have occurred or  the  Company
Board  shall  have  resolved to make  a  Change  in  Company
Recommendation;   (ii)   the  Company   Board   shall   have
recommended  to the stockholders of the Company a  Competing
Transaction or shall have publicly announced it  intends  to
do  so  or  shall have entered into any letter of intent  or
similar  document or any agreement, contract  or  commitment
accepting any Competing Transaction; (iii) the Company shall
have   failed   to  include  in  the  Schedule   14D-9   the
recommendation of the Company Board in favor of  holders  of
Shares accepting the Offer and tendering their Shares in the
Offer;  (iv)  the  Company  Board  fails  to  reaffirm   its
recommendation in favor of holders of Shares  accepting  the
Offer  and  tendering their Shares in the Offer within  five
business  days  after Parent requests in writing  that  such
recommendation  be  reaffirmed; (v) the Company  shall  have
willfully  breached its obligations under Section  6.05;  or
(vi) a tender offer or exchange offer for 25% or more of the
outstanding  shares  of  capital stock  of  the  Company  is
commenced, and the Company Board fails to recommend  against
acceptance  of such tender offer or exchange  offer  by  its
stockholders  (including by taking no position with  respect
to  the acceptance of such tender offer or exchange offer by
its stockholders).

          SECTION 8.02   Effect of Termination

          In  the event of the termination of this Agreement
pursuant  to  Section 8.01, this Agreement  shall  forthwith
become  void,  and  there shall be no liability  under  this
Agreement on the part of any party hereto, except (a) as set
forth  in Section 8.03 and (b) nothing herein shall  relieve
any  party from liability for any willful breach of  any  of
its representations, warranties, covenants or agreements set
forth in this Agreement prior to such


                             41

<Page>

termination; provided, however, that the terms  of  Sections
6.04(b)  and  (c)  shall  survive any  termination  of  this
Agreement.

          SECTION 8.03   Fees and Expenses

          (a)  Except as set forth in this Section 8.03, all
Expenses (as defined below) incurred in connection with this
Agreement,  the Offer and the Merger shall be  paid  by  the
party incurring such expenses, whether or not the Offer, the
Merger or any other transaction is consummated.  "Expenses",
as  used  in  this Agreement, shall include  all  reasonable
out-of-pocket  expenses (including, without limitation,  all
reasonable   fees  and  expenses  of  counsel,  accountants,
auditors, investment bankers, experts and consultants  to  a
party  hereto and its affiliates) incurred by a party or  on
its  behalf  in  connection with  or  related  to  the  VPSB
Approval   or   the  approval  or  consent  of   any   other
Governmental   Authority,  the  authorization,  preparation,
negotiation,  execution and performance of  this  Agreement,
the  preparation, printing, filing and mailing of the  Offer
Documents,  the Schedule 14D-9 and the Proxy Statement,  the
solicitation  of stockholder tenders and all  other  matters
related  to  consummation of the Offer, the Merger  and  the
other transactions contemplated by this Agreement.

          (b)  The Company agrees that:

          (i)   if  Parent  shall terminate  this  Agreement
     pursuant to Section 8.01(d); or

          (ii)   if  (A)(1)  Parent  or  the  Company  shall
     terminate  this Agreement pursuant to Section  8.01(b),
     (2)  Parent shall terminate this Agreement pursuant  to
     Section  8.01(f),  or (3) the Company  shall  terminate
     this  Agreement pursuant to Section 8.01(g), (B)  prior
     to  any such termination, a Competing Transaction shall
     have  been  publicly  announced  with  respect  to  the
     Company  and such Competing Transaction shall not  have
     been publicly withdrawn at the time of such termination
     or  an  understanding, including without limitation  in
     the  form  of  a  letter  of  intent,  term  sheet   or
     otherwise,  has been reached in principle  (whether  or
     not  legally  binding) for a Competing Transaction  (an
     "Understanding"), and (C) within 12 months  after  such
     termination,  the Company enters into an  agreement  or
     Understanding  with respect to a Competing  Transaction
     or a Competing Transaction is consummated; or

          (iii)       if  any  person  (including,   without
     limitation,  the  Company  or any  affiliate  thereof),
     other  than  Parent or any affiliate of  Parent,  shall
     after  the date hereof have become the beneficial owner
     of  more  than 25% of the then-outstanding Shares,  and
     this  Agreement shall have been terminated pursuant  to
     Section 8.01(b), 8.01(f) or 8.01(g); or

          (iv) if the Company shall terminate this Agreement
     pursuant to Section 8.01(e); or

          (v)   if  the Company enters into an agreement  or
     Understanding with respect to a Competing  Transaction,
     or a Competing Transaction is consummated, in each case
     within   12  months  after  the  termination  of   this
     Agreement  pursuant to Section 8.01,  and  the  Company
     shall  not  theretofore have been required  to  pay  to
     Parent  an  amount  equal  to the  amount  of  Parent's
     Expenses  pursuant to Section 8.03(b)(i),  8.03(b)(ii),
     8.03(b)(iii) or 8.03(b)(iv);



                             42

<Page>

then  the Company shall pay to Parent promptly (but  in  any
event no later than one business day after the first of such
events shall have occurred) an amount equal to the amount of
Parent's  Expenses; provided that the Company shall  not  be
liable  for  any amount of Parent's Expenses  in  excess  of
$675,000 in the aggregate.

          (c)   The  Company  agrees that  if  Parent  shall
terminate  this Agreement pursuant to Section 8.01(f)  as  a
result of the failure to satisfy the conditions set forth in
paragraph  (h)  or (i) of Annex A hereto, then  the  Company
shall,  whether  or  not any payment  is  made  pursuant  to
Section  8.03(b), reimburse Parent for all of  its  Expenses
(such  payment  to be made not later than one  business  day
after submission of statements therefor).

          (d)   The Company acknowledges that the agreements
contained in this Section 8.03 are an integral part  of  the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement.  In  the  event
that  the  Company shall fail to pay the Fee or any Expenses
when due, the term "Expenses" shall be deemed to include the
costs  and expenses actually incurred or accrued by  Parent,
to  the  extent  such accrued expenses are,  in  fact,  paid
(including, without limitation, reasonable fees and expenses
of  counsel)  in  connection with the collection  under  and
enforcement of this Section 8.03.  Payment of the  fees  and
expenses described in this Section 8.03 shall not be in lieu
of  any  damages incurred in the event of willful breach  of
this Agreement.

          SECTION 8.04   Amendment

          Subject  to  Section 6.03, this Agreement  may  be
amended  by  the  parties hereto by action taken  by  or  on
behalf  of their respective Boards of Directors at any  time

approval and adoption of this Agreement and the Transactions
by  the stockholders of the Company, but after such approval

This Agreement may not be amended except by an instrument in
writing signed by each of the parties hereto.

confer upon any other person any right, benefit or remedy of
any  nature whatsoever under or by reason of this Agreement,
other  than  Section 6.07 (which is intended to be  for  the
benefit  of the persons covered thereby and may be  enforced
by such persons).

          SECTION 9.07   Specific Performance

          The  parties hereto agree that irreparable  damage
would  occur  in  the event any provision of this  Agreement
were  not performed in accordance with the terms hereof  and

of  the terms hereof, in addition to any other remedy at law
or equity.

otherwise,  in  any such Action, any claim that  it  is  not
subject  personally to the jurisdiction of  the  above-named
courts,   that  its  property  is  exempt  or  immune   from
attachment  or execution, that the Action is brought  in  an
inconvenient  forum,  that  the  venue  of  the  Action   is
improper, or that this Agreement or the Transactions may not
be enforced in or by any of the above-named courts.

          SECTION 9.09   Waiver of Jury Trial

          Each  of the parties hereto hereby waives  to  the
fullest extent permitted by applicable Law any right it  may
have  to  a  trial  by jury with respect to  any  litigation
directly  or  indirectly  arising  out  of,  under   or   in
connection with this Agreement or the Transactions.  Each of
the  parties hereto (a) certifies that no Representative  of
any  other  party has represented, expressly  or  otherwise,
that such other party would not, in the event of litigation,
seek  to  enforce that foregoing waiver and (b) acknowledges
that it and the other hereto have been induced to enter into
this  Agreement  and  the Transactions, as  applicable,  by,
among other things, the mutual waivers and certifications in
this Section 9.09.

          SECTION 9.10   Headings, etc

          The   descriptive  headings  contained   in   this
Agreement are included for convenience of reference only and
shall not affect in any way the meaning or interpretation of
this  Agreement.   As  used herein,  any  reference  in  the
singular  shall include the plural and vice versa,  and  any
reference to a gender shall include all genders.  The  terms
"include"  and  "including" and derivatives  of  such  terms
shall  mean  "including  without  limitation"   whether   by
enumeration or otherwise.

          SECTION 9.11   Counterparts

          This  Agreement  may  be  executed  and  delivered
(including  by  facsimile  transmission)  in  one  or   more
counterparts,  and  by  the  different  parties  hereto   in
separate counterparts, each of which when executed shall  be
deemed  to  be  an original but all of which taken  together
shall constitute one and the same agreement.

          SECTION 9.12   Company Disclosure Schedule

          The  Company has or may have set forth information
in the Company Disclosure Schedule in a Section thereof that
corresponds  to the Section of this Agreement  to  which  it
relates.   A matter set forth in one Section of the  Company
Disclosure  Schedule  need not be set  forth  in  any  other
Section  of the Company Disclosure Schedule so long  as  its
relevance  to  the latter Section of the Company  Disclosure
Schedule or Section of the Agreement is readily apparent  on
the  face  of  the  information  disclosed  in  the  Company
Disclosure  Schedule to the person to which such  disclosure
is  being  made.  The fact that any item of  information  is
disclosed  in the Company Disclosure Schedule shall  not  be
construed  to mean that such information is required  to  be
disclosed by this Agreement.  The inclusion of any  item  in
any  Section of the Company Disclosure Schedule (i) does not
represent a determination by the Company that such  item  is
"material"  and  (ii) does not represent a determination  by
the  Company  that such item did not arise in  the  ordinary
course of business.
