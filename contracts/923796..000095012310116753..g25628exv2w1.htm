Until surrendered as contemplated by this Section 2.03, each Certificate shall be deemed at all times after the Effective Time to represent only the right to receive, upon such surrender, such Eligible Holders Pro Rata Portion of any payments to which an Eligible Holder is entitled pursuant to this Article II. No interest shall be paid or will accrue on any cash payable to holders of Certificates pursuant to the provisions of this Article II.

liable for, payment of any amounts payable to such Person pursuant to this
Agreement. Any portion of the Exchange Fund remaining unclaimed by Security
Holders as of a date which is immediately prior to such time as such amounts
would otherwise escheat to or become property of any Governmental Authority
shall, to the extent permitted by applicable Law, become the property of
Parent free and clear of any claims or interest of any Person previously
entitled thereto. 

   

 (d) _No Liability_. None of the Stockholders Representative, Parent, Merger Sub or the Surviving Corporation shall be liable to any Security Holder for any cash (including any dividends or distributions with respect to such Securities) delivered to a public official pursuant to any abandoned property, escheat or similar Law. 

   

 (e) _Withholding Rights_. Each of the Escrow Agent, the Surviving Corporation and Parent shall be entitled to deduct and withhold from the consideration otherwise payable pursuant to this Agreement to any holder of Eligible Shares or Vested Company Stock Options or Company Warrants, such amounts as it is required to deduct and withhold with respect to such payment under all applicable Tax Laws. To the extent that amounts are so deducted or withheld and properly paid to the appropriate Tax authority by the Stockholders Representative, the Surviving Corporation or Parent, as the case may be, such amounts shall be treated for all purposes of this Agreement as having been paid to the holder of the Eligible Shares or Vested Company Stock Options or Company Warrants in respect of which such deduction and withholding was made by the Escrow Agent, the Surviving Corporation or Parent, as the case may be. 

   

 (f) _Lost Certificates_. If any Certificate shall have been lost, stolen or destroyed, upon the making and delivery of an affidavit of that fact by the Person claiming such Certificate to be lost, stolen or destroyed and, if required by the Surviving Corporation, the agreement to provide a customary indemnity with respect to such lost Certificate, the Surviving Corporation shall pay in respect of such lost, stolen or destroyed Certificate the merger consideration to which the holder thereof is entitled pursuant to this Agreement.

provide, and Parent shall cause the Surviving Corporation to provide, to the

access to the Surviving Corporations auditors and accounting and other
personnel and to the books and records of the Surviving Corporation and any

Stockholders Representative and its Representatives to verify the accuracy
of the computation set forth in the Purchase Price Adjustment Statement. 

   

 (b) If the Stockholders Representative disagrees with the calculation of any of the items set forth in the Purchase Price Adjustment Statement, the Stockholders Representative shall notify Parent in writing of such disagreement (an " _Objection Notice_ ") within forty-five (45) days after receipt of the Purchase Price Adjustment Statement by the Stockholders Representative. Any Objection Notice shall (i) specify in reasonable detail the nature of any disagreement so asserted and (ii) specify the line item or items in the Purchase Price Adjustment Statement with which the Stockholders Representative disagrees and the amount of each such line item or items as calculated by the Stockholders Representative.

 (c) If the Stockholders Representative delivers an Objection Notice to the Purchase Price Adjustment Statement within 45 days following the receipt of such statement, then the Stockholders Representative and Parent shall negotiate in good faith and attempt to resolve their disagreement. Should such negotiations not result in an agreement within 30 days after delivery of an Objection Notice, the issues remaining in dispute shall be submitted to a neutral auditor mutually agreeable to the Stockholders Representative and Parent (the " _Neutral Auditor_ "). If Parent and the Stockholders Representative are unable to agree upon a Neutral Auditor within such time period, then the Neutral Auditor shall be an accounting firm of national standing designated by the American Arbitration Association in New York, New York. The Stockholders Representative and Parent shall furnish or cause to be furnished to the Neutral Auditor such work papers and other documents and information relating to the disputed issues as they may deem necessary or appropriate or as the Neutral Auditor may request and that are available to that party or its agents. Further, the Stockholders Representative and Parent shall be afforded the opportunity to present to the Neutral Auditor any material relating to the disputed issues and to discuss the issues with the Neutral Auditor, _provided_ , _however_ , that no party shall have any discussions with the Neutral Auditor without first providing the other parties with notice of such discussions and a reasonable opportunity to attend, observe or otherwise participate in such discussions. All fees and expenses relating to the work, if any, performed by the Neutral Auditor will be borne equally by Parent and the Stockholders Representative. The Neutral Auditor will deliver to Parent and the Stockholders Representative, as promptly as 

      ##### 

  

    

practicable and in any event within thirty (30) days after its appointment, a
written determination (which determination shall include a worksheet setting
forth all material calculations used in arriving at such determination and
shall be based solely on information provided to the Neutral Auditor by
Parent and the Stockholders Representative or their respective Affiliates)
of the disputed items. In resolving any disputed item, the Neutral Auditor:
(i) shall be bound by the principles set forth in this Section 2.04 and (ii)
shall limit its review to the line items and items specifically set forth in
and properly raised in an Objection Notice. The Neutral Auditors
determination shall be final and binding upon all of the parties to this
Agreement and the Security Holders. Upon the agreement of Parent and the
Stockholders Representative or the decision of the Neutral Auditor, or if the
Stockholders Representative fails to deliver an Objection Notice to Parent
within the forty-five (45) day period provided in Section 2.04(b), the

 (a) _Direct Claims_. 

    

 (i) If either a Parent Indemnitee, on the one hand, or a Security Holder Indemnitee, on the other hand, shall have a claim for indemnification hereunder (each, as applicable, an " _Indemnified Party_ "), the Indemnified Party shall give, as promptly as is reasonably practicable, written notice (a " _Claim Notice_ ") to, in the case of a Security Holder Indemnitee, Parent, and in the case of a Parent Indemnitee, the Stockholders Representative (each of Parent and the Stockholders Representative, for purposes herein, an " _Indemnifying Party_ "), describing in reasonable detail the facts giving rise to any claim for indemnification hereunder and shall include in such Claim Notice (if then known) the amount or the method of computation of the amount of such claim, and a reference to the provision of this Agreement or any other agreement, document or instrument executed hereunder or in connection herewith upon which such claim is based; _provided_ , that (A) a Claim Notice in respect of any action at law or suit in equity by or against a third Person as to which indemnification will be sought shall be given promptly after the action or suit is commenced; and (B) failure to give such notice shall not relieve the Indemnifying Party of its obligations hereunder except to the extent it shall have been prejudiced by such failure. 

   

 (ii) After the giving of any Claim Notice pursuant hereto, the amount of indemnification to which an Indemnified Party shall be entitled under this Article IX shall be determined: (A) by the written agreement between the Indemnified Party and the Indemnifying Party; (B) by a final judgment or decree of any court of competent jurisdiction; or (C) by any other means to which the Indemnified Party and the Indemnifying Party shall agree. The judgment or decree of a court shall be deemed final when the time for appeal, if any, shall have expired and no appeal shall have been taken or when all appeals taken shall have been finally determined. 

   

 (iii) To the maximum extent permitted under applicable Law, each party hereto or beneficiary of an indemnification payment made hereunder agrees to report each indemnification payment hereunder as an adjustment to the merger consideration paid by Parent hereunder for federal income tax purposes. 

  

 (b) _Third Party Claims_. 

   

 (i) Subject to Section 9.03(b)(ii), the Indemnified Party shall have the right to conduct and control, through counsel of its choosing (but reasonably acceptable to the Indemnifying Party), the defense, compromise or settlement of any third Person claim, action or suit (each, a " _Third Party Claim_ ") against any Indemnified Party as to which indemnification will be sought by any Indemnified Party hereunder, and in any such case the parties hereto shall cooperate in connection therewith and shall furnish such records, information and testimony and attend such conferences, discovery proceedings, hearings, trials and appeals as may be reasonably requested by the Indemnified Party in connection therewith; _provided_ , that (A) the Indemnifying Party may participate, through counsel chosen by it and at its own expense, in the defense of any such claim, action or 

   ##### 

  

    

suit (including, without limitation, any audit or administrative or judicial
proceeding related to Taxes) as to which the Indemnified Party has so elected
to conduct and control the defense thereof; and (B) the Indemnified Party
shall not, without the written consent of the Indemnifying Party (which
written consent shall not be unreasonably withheld), pay, compromise or
settle any such claim, action or suit (including, without limitation,
any audit, assessment, or adjustment related to Taxes). Notwithstanding the
foregoing, the Indemnified Party shall have the right to pay, settle or
compromise any such claim, action or suit without such consent, provided that
in such event the Indemnified Party shall waive any right to indemnity
therefor hereunder. 

   

 (ii) If any Third Party Claim, action or suit against any Indemnified Party is solely for money damages or will have no material adverse effect on the reputation of Parent or the Surviving Corporation and does not involve a claim by a material Governmental Authority customer of the Company or any of the Subsidiaries, then the Stockholders Representative, on behalf of the Security Holders hereunder, (and provided (i) that the Stockholders Representative acknowledges obligation of the Security Holders to provide indemnity for such Claim hereunder and (ii) such Third Party Claim does not (and is not reasonably expected to) exceed the Holdback Amount); shall have the right to conduct and control, through counsel of its choosing, the defense of any such Third Party Claim; _provided_ _further_  that (A) the Stockholders Representative shall not pay, settle or compromise any such claim, action or suit without the consent of the Indemnified Party (which written consent shall not be unreasonably withheld). The Indemnified Party shall cooperate in connection therewith (at the Security Holders expense) and shall furnish such records, information and testimony and attend such conferences, discovery proceedings, hearings, trials and appeals as may be reasonably requested by the Stockholders Representative in connection therewith; provided that the Indemnified Party may participate, through counsel chosen by it and at its own expense, in the defense of any such claim, action or suit as to which the Stockholders Representative, on behalf of the Security Holders hereunder, has so elected to conduct and control the defense thereof. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Indemnified Party shall have the right to pay, settle or compromise any such claim, action or suit, provided that in such event the Indemnified Party shall waive any right to indemnity therefor hereunder unless the Indemnified Party shall have sought the consent of the Stockholders Representative to such payment, settlement or compromise and such consent was unreasonably withheld, in which event no claim for indemnity therefor hereunder shall be waived. 

  

 SECTION 9.04 _Indemnity Escrow_. 

  

 (a) Subject to the terms and conditions of this Agreement and the Escrow Agreement, the sole source of any indemnification of the Parent Indemnitees pursuant to this Agreement shall be the amounts in the Holdback Fund.

 (ii) to each Optionholder, with respect to each share of Company Common Stock underlying each of such Optionholders Company Stock Options immediately prior to the Effective Time (and for which a Letter of Transmittal has been delivered), an amount equal (A) the amount released from the Holdback Fund minus all unreimbursed Stockholders Representative Expenses which have been incurred prior to the release of funds from the Holdback Fund, _divided by_ (B) the Fully Diluted Number. 

   

 (iii) to each Warrantholder with respect to each share of Common Stock underlying such Warrantholders Company Warrants immediately prior to the Effective Time (and for which a Letter of Transmittal has been delivered), an amount equal (A) the amount released from the Holdback Fund minus all unreimbursed Stockholders Representative Expenses which have been incurred prior to the release of funds from the Holdback Fund, _divided by_ (B) the Fully Diluted Number. 

  

 SECTION 9.05 _Other Provisions_. 

  

 (a) _Loss Offsets_. The amount of any Loss for which indemnification is provided under Section 9.02(a) or Section 9.02(b) shall be net of (i) any amount in respect of such Loss for which a reserve or accrual is established on Closing Working Capital or which has been expressly taken into account as a current liability for purposes of the calculation of the Aggregate Merger Consideration Per Share, (ii) any amounts recovered by the Indemnified Party pursuant to any indemnification by or indemnification agreement with any third party, (iii) any insurance proceeds or other cash receipts or sources of reimbursement received as an offset against such Loss, and (iv) an amount equal to the Tax benefit attributable to such Loss received in cash or received through a reduction in Taxes otherwise payable by Parent or the Surviving Corporation.

 (b) _Exclusive Remedies_. Following the Closing, this Article IX shall provide the sole and exclusive remedy of the Parent Indemnitees and the Security Holder Indemnitees, whether in contract, tort or otherwise, for all matters arising out of or relating to this Agreement and the Transactions, including for any inaccuracy or breach of any representation, warranty, covenant or agreement set forth herein, except with respect to claims for actual fraud.

Parent and Merger Sub acknowledge and agree that the Stockholders Representative is party to this Agreement solely for purposes of serving as the "Stockholders Representative" and that no claim shall be brought by or on behalf of Parent or Merger Sub against the Stockholders Representative with respect to this Agreement or the Transactions (other than any claim against the Stockholders Representative in its capacity as a Stockholder) (it being understood that any covenant or agreement that requires performance by the "parties" or a "party" at or prior to the Closing shall not be deemed to require performance by the Stockholders Representative unless performance by the Stockholders Representative is expressly provided for in such covenant or agreement).
