means any event, circumstance, development, change or effect (each, an &#147;<U>Event</U>&#148;) that,
individually or in the aggregate with all other Events, is materially adverse to the business,
operations, assets, financial condition or results of operations of the Company and the
Subsidiaries taken as a whole, or which, with respect to the Company, would reasonably be expected
to prevent or materially delay the Transactions or prevent or materially impair or delay the
ability of the Company to perform its obligations hereunder. Notwithstanding the foregoing, a
Company Material Adverse Effect shall not be deemed to include any Event to the extent resulting
from any one or more of the following: (i)&nbsp;any Event in any of the industries in which the Company
and its Subsidiaries operate generally, (ii)&nbsp;any Event in United States financial or securities
markets, general economic or business conditions, or political or regulatory conditions, (iii)&nbsp;any

(including in respect of employees) with respect to any of the businesses of the Company and the
Subsidiaries including any loss or threatened loss of employees, customers, suppliers, distributors
or others having relationships with the Company or any of the Subsidiaries, in each case to the
extent arising out of the foregoing, (v)&nbsp;any outbreak or escalation of hostilities or war or any
act of terrorism, (vi)&nbsp;any change resulting from any action taken or failed to be taken by the
Company or its Affiliates at the written request of Parent or (vii)&nbsp;any failure, in of itself, of
the Company or its Subsidiary to meet, with respect to any period or periods, any internal
projections, forecasts, estimates of earnings or revenues, or business plans (it being understood
that the facts and circumstances giving rise or contributing to any such failure may, unless
otherwise excluded by another clause in this definition of &#147;Company Material Adverse Effect,&#148; be
taken into account in determining whether a &#147;Company Material Adverse Effect&#148; has occurred or would
be reasonably be expected to occur), except, in the case of the foregoing clauses (i)&nbsp;through (iii)
and (v)&nbsp;above, to the extent such changes cause a materially disproportionate impact on the Company

which the Company and the Subsidiaries operate as a whole.</DIV>
