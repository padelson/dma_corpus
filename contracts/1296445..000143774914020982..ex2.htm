RECITALS

 



 

WHEREAS, the Parties wish to enter into a transaction whereby (i) at the
Closing, each issued and outstanding OIL Ordinary Share will be transferred
to, and acquired by, OTI, free and clear of any Security Interests, in
exchange for the right of the holders thereof to receive that number of fully
paid and nonassessable shares of OTI Common Stock equal to the Exchange Ratio,
such that OIL will become a direct wholly owned Subsidiary of OTI (the "
_Share Exchange_ "); (ii) within three (3) Business Days after the Closing,
OIL will transfer all of the OTI Common Stock held by it to OTI (the " _1_
_st_ _Internal Transfer_ "), which shares of OTI Common Stock will be
automatically canceled in accordance with Section 2.1; (iii) promptly
following the 1st Internal Transfer, OTI will transfer all of the OSIL
Ordinary Shares held by it to OIL (the " _2_ _nd_ _Internal Transfer_ "), such
that OSIL will become a direct wholly owned Subsidiary of OIL; and (iv) on
March 31, 2015, OIL will merge (the " _Merger_ ") with and into OSIL following
which OIL will cease to exist and OSIL will be the surviving company (the "
_Surviving Company_ ") and shall become a direct wholly owned Subsidiary of
OTI, all in accordance with this Agreement;

 



 

WHEREAS, the board of directors of OTI (upon the unanimous recommendation of
the special committee of the board of directors of OTI consisting solely of
independent directors (the " _OTI Special Committee_ ")) has (i) approved and
declared advisable, fair to and in the best interests of its shareholders,
this Agreement, the Share Exchange and the other Transactions contemplated by
this Agreement, and (ii) determined to recommend to its shareholders the
approval of this Agreement, the Share Exchange and the other Transactions
contemplated by this Agreement;

 



 

WHEREAS, the board of directors of OIL (upon the unanimous recommendation of
the special committee of the board of directors of OIL consisting solely of
independent directors (the " _OIL Special Committee_ ")), has (i) approved and
declared advisable, fair to and in the best interests of its shareholders,
this Agreement, the Share Exchange and the other Transactions contemplated by
this Agreement, and (ii) determined to recommend to its shareholders the
approval of this Agreement, the Share Exchange, and the other Transactions
contemplated by this Agreement;

 



 

WHEREAS, concurrently with the execution of this Agreement and as a condition
and inducement of the Parties to enter into this Agreement, (i) certain
principal shareholders of OIL (the " _OIL Principal Shareholders_ ") are each
entering into (A) a voting and undertaking agreement, in substantially the
form attached hereto as _Exhibit A_ (the " _OIL Shareholders Undertaking
Agreement_ "), pursuant to which, among other things, each such Person has
agreed to vote all of the OIL Ordinary Shares owned by it in favor of the
approval and adoption of this Agreement, and the approval of the Share
Exchange, the Merger and the other Transactions contemplated hereby and to
comply with the terms of the Israeli Tax Ruling applicable to such Person and
(B) a voting neutralization agreement, in substantially the form attached
hereto as _Exhibit B_ (the " _Voting Neutralization Agreement_ " and, together
with the OIL Shareholders Undertaking Agreements, the " _OIL Shareholders
Voting Agreements_ "), pursuant to which, among other things, each such Person
has agreed to vote a portion of the OTI Common Stock to be owned by it
following the Closing in direct proportion to the votes of OTI's other
stockholders, and (ii) OIL is entering into a voting agreement, in
substantially the form attached hereto as _Exhibit C_ (the " _OIL Voting
Agreement_ "), pursuant to which, among other things, OIL has agreed to vote
all of the shares of OTI Common Stock owned by it in favor of the OTI
Stockholder Approval;

 



 

 



   



 

WHEREAS, the Parties intend to effect the Share Exchange, the Merger and the
other Transactions contemplated by this Agreement by way of a court-approved
arrangement among OIL, OSIL and their respective shareholders and (if
applicable) creditors, in accordance with Sections 350 and 351 of the
Companies Law and other applicable Law;

 



 

WHEREAS, on November 9, 2014, OIL and OSIL have obtained a ruling, dated
November 6, 2014, from the ITA confirming, among other things, that, subject
to the conditions stipulated therein, the obligation of OIL shareholders to
pay capital gains tax on the Share Exchange will be deferred in accordance
with the provisions of Section 103C of the Ordinance (the " _Israeli Tax
Ruling_ "); and

 



 

WHEREAS, the Parties intend that, for U.S. federal income tax purposes, the
Share Exchange, the Merger and the other Transactions contemplated by this
Agreement will qualify as a "reorganization" within the meaning of Section
368(a) of the Code and the Treasury Regulations;

 



 

NOW, THEREFORE, in consideration of the foregoing and the mutual covenants and
agreements contained herein, the Parties, intending to be legally bound,
hereby agree as follows:

 



     

1.

 |  

SHARE EXCHANGE 

---|--- 
 



 

1.1 _ _Closing.__

 



 

On the terms and subject to the conditions set forth in this Agreement and the
Court Approval, the consummation of the Share Exchange (the " _Closing_ ")
will take place at the offices of Chadbourne and Parke LLP, 1301 Avenue of the
Americas, New York, NY (" _OTI Counsel_ "), at a time and on a date to be
mutually designated by the Parties (or such other place, time and date agreed
to by the Parties), which shall be no later than the second Business Day (or
such other period of time agreed to by the Parties) following the satisfaction
or waiver (wherever permissible by the applicable Party) of all of the
conditions set forth in Article VI (other than those conditions that by their
nature or pursuant to the terms of this Agreement are to be satisfied at or
immediately prior to the Closing). The date on which the Closing occurs is
referred to as the " _Closing Date_ " or the " _Effective Time_ ," as
applicable.

 



 

1.2 _ _Effect on Capital Stock__ _ _.__

 



 

At the Effective Time, by virtue of the Share Exchange and without any further
action on the part of OIL or OTI or any of the holders of the following
securities, each of the following shall occur:

 



 

(a) _Cancellation of OIL Treasury Stock_. Any OIL Ordinary Share that is
owned by OIL as treasury stock and any OIL Ordinary Shares owned by OTI or any
direct or indirect wholly owned Subsidiary of OIL or of OTI, will be
automatically canceled and will cease to exist and no consideration will be
delivered in exchange therefor.

 



 

(b) _No Effect on OTI Common Stock_. Each share of OTI Common Stock (i)
not owned by OIL that is issued and outstanding immediately prior to the
Effective Time will remain issued and outstanding after the Effective Time,
and (ii) that is owned by OIL immediately prior to the Effective Time will,
subject to Section 2.1 hereof, continue to be owned by OIL but OIL
acknowledges and agrees that no consideration will be delivered in exchange
therefor and shall be treated by OTI as dormant shares that do not carry any
voting or economic rights.

 



 

(c) _Share Exchange_. Each issued and outstanding OIL Ordinary Share will
be transferred to, and acquired by, OTI, free and clear of any Security
Interests, in exchange for the right of the holders thereof (subject to
Sections 1.2(a), 1.2(b) and 1.6 hereof) to receive that number of fully paid
and nonassessable shares of OTI Common Stock equal to the Exchange Ratio. The
shares of OTI Common Stock to be issued pursuant to this Section 1.2(c) are
referred to as the " _Share Exchange Consideration_." For the sake of clarity,
as of the Effective Time, (i) all issued and outstanding OIL Ordinary Shares
will be transferred to, and acquired by, OTI, free and clear of any Security
Interests, such that OIL will become a direct wholly owned Subsidiary of OTI
and (ii) any holder of a certificate or book-entry shares formerly
representing any such OIL Ordinary Shares will cease to have any rights with
respect thereto, except the right to receive the Share Exchange Consideration
upon surrender of such certificate or book-entry share. The issuance of OTI
Common Stock (and Rights, if issued pursuant to the following paragraph) in
connection with the Share Exchange is referred to as the " _OTI Stock
Issuance_."

 



 

 



   



 

(d) _Adjustments_. Without derogating from any other provision of this
Agreement (including Sections 5.4 and 5.5 hereof), (i) the Exchange Ratio
shall be adjusted to reflect appropriately the effect of any forward or
reverse stock split, stock dividend (including any dividend or distribution of
securities convertible into shares of OTI Common Stock), reorganization,
recapitalization, reclassification, combination, exchange of shares or other
like change with respect to shares of OTI Common Stock occurring on or after
the date hereof and prior to the Effective Time, and (ii) unless the Rights
shall have expired or been redeemed prior to the Effective Time, upon the
issuance of any OTI Common Stock hereunder, and pursuant to the Rights
Agreement, one Right shall be issued together with and shall attach to each
share of OTI Common Stock issued pursuant to the terms of this Agreement (in
which case, references in this Agreement to OTI Common Stock shall include,
unless the context requires otherwise, the Rights).

 



 

1.3 _ _Exchange__ _ _of Certificates.__

 



 

Prior to the Closing, OTI will appoint a bank, depositary or trust company
that maintains an office in Israel, which is reasonably acceptable to OIL, to
act as the exchange agent (the " _Exchange Agent_ "). At or prior to the
Effective Time, OTI will deposit with the Exchange Agent, for the benefit of
the holders of OIL Ordinary Shares, for exchange in accordance with this
Article I through the Exchange Agent, evidence in book-entry form representing
the shares of OTI Common Stock issuable pursuant to this Article I in exchange
for outstanding OIL Ordinary Shares that were converted into the right to
receive the Share Exchange Consideration (such shares of OTI Common Stock,
together with any dividends or distributions with respect thereto, being
hereinafter referred to as the " _Exchange Fund_ "). The Exchange Agent will,
pursuant to irrevocable instructions, deliver the OTI Common Stock to be
issued pursuant to this Article I out of the Exchange Fund. The Exchange Fund
will not be used for any other purpose.

 



 

1.4 _ _Exchange__ _ _Procedures.__

 



 

(a) As soon as reasonably practicable after the Effective Time, the
Exchange Agent will mail, or facilitate the mailing, to any holder of record
of outstanding OIL Ordinary Shares whose shares were converted into the right
to receive the Share Exchange Consideration pursuant to Section 1.2(c), (a) a
letter of transmittal, and (b) instructions for use in effecting the exchange
of any OIL Ordinary Shares for Share Exchange Consideration. Upon delivery to
the Exchange Agent of the letter of transmittal, duly executed, and such other
documents as may reasonably be required by OTI or the Exchange Agent, the
holder of such OIL Ordinary Shares will be entitled to receive in exchange
therefor the Share Exchange Consideration (and cash in lieu of fractional
shares of OTI Common Stock pursuant to Section 1.6 hereof) that such holder
has the right to receive pursuant to the provisions of this Article I. Until
exchanged as contemplated by this Section 1.4 and Section 1.5 below, any OIL
Ordinary Shares previously owned by such shareholder will be deemed at any
time after the Effective Time to represent only the right to receive upon such
exchange the Share Exchange Consideration as contemplated by Section 1.2(c).

 



 

(b) Notwithstanding the foregoing and Section 1.3, it is hereby clarified
that, with respect to holders of certificates (and not book-entry shares)
formerly representing any OIL Ordinary Shares and registered in OIL's own
shareholders registrar (the " _OIL Record Holders_ "), OTI may (i) deliver
itself (or through an agent reasonably acceptable to OIL) said letter of
transmittal (and instructions) to such OIL Record Holders and (ii) upon
delivery to OTI (or said agent) of the letter of transmittal, duly executed,
and such other documents as may reasonably be required by OTI (or said agent),
the OIL Record Holder will be entitled to receive a certificate (or evidence
in book-entry form) representing the shares of OTI Common Stock issuable
pursuant to this Article I in exchange therefor (and cash in lieu of
fractional shares of OTI Common Stock pursuant to Section 1.6 hereof).

 



 

 



   



 

1.5 _ _No Further Ownership Rights in OIL Ordinary Shares.__

 



 

The Share Exchange Consideration issued in accordance with the terms of this
Article I will be deemed to have been issued in full satisfaction of all
rights pertaining to such OIL Ordinary Shares. After the Closing, by virtue of
the Arrangement, no OIL Shareholder (whether such shares were held through
certificate or book-entry form) shall have the right (i) to receive any
consideration, including securities of OTI or cash, other than the shares of
OTI Common Stock (and cash in lieu of fractional shares pursuant to Section
1.6) to be provided to such shareholder hereunder or (ii) to make any claim
with respect to the authority of any Party to enter into this Agreement or the
enforceability of the Share Exchange, the Merger or any of the other
Transactions.

 



 

1.6 _ _No__ _ _Fractional Shares.__

 



 

(a) No certificates or scrip representing fractional shares of OTI Common
Stock will be issued upon the conversion of OIL Ordinary Shares pursuant to
_Section 1.2_ , and such fractional share interests will not entitle the owner
thereof to vote or to any rights of a holder of OTI Common Stock. For purposes
of this _Section 1.6_ , all fractional shares to which a single record holder
would be entitled will be aggregated, and calculations will be rounded to
three decimal places.

 



 

(b) Fractional shares of OTI Common Stock that would otherwise be
allocable to any former holders of OIL Ordinary Shares in the Share Exchange
will be aggregated, and no holder of OIL Ordinary Shares will receive cash
equal to or greater than the value of one full share of OTI Common Stock. The
Exchange Agent will promptly cause the whole shares obtained thereby to be
sold, in the open market or otherwise as directed by OTI, and in no case later
than 30 Business Days after the Effective Time. The Exchange Agent will make
available the net proceeds thereof, after deducting any required withholding
Taxes and brokerage charges, commissions and transfer Taxes and fees, on a pro
rata basis, without interest, as soon as practicable to the holders of OIL
Ordinary Shares entitled to receive such cash. Payment of cash in lieu of
fractional shares of OTI Common Stock will be made solely for the purpose of
avoiding the expense and inconvenience to OTI of issuing fractional shares and
will not represent separately bargained-for consideration.

 



 

1.7 _ _Distributions with Respect to Unexchanged Shares.__

 



 

No dividends or other distributions with respect to OTI Common Stock with a
record date after the Effective Time will be paid to the holder of any OIL
Ordinary Shares with respect to the shares of OTI Common Stock issuable upon
exchange thereof, until the exchange of such OIL Ordinary Shares in accordance
with this Article I. Subject to applicable Law, following the exchange of any
such OIL Ordinary Shares, there will be paid to the holder of the certificate
representing whole shares of OTI Common Stock issued in exchange therefor,
without interest, (i) at the time of such surrender, the amount of any
dividends or other distributions with a record date after the Effective Time
theretofore paid with respect to such whole shares of OTI Common Stock, and
(ii) at the appropriate payment date, the amount of dividends or other
distributions with a record date after the Effective Time but prior to such
surrender and a payment date subsequent to such exchange payable with respect
to such whole shares of OTI Common Stock.

 



 

1.8 _ _Withholding Rights.__

 



 

OTI or the Exchange Agent, as the case may be, will be entitled to deduct and
withhold from the consideration otherwise payable pursuant to this Agreement
such amounts as may be required to be deducted and withheld with respect to
the making of such payment under the Code, the Ordinance or any applicable Tax
Law. Notwithstanding the foregoing, except as may be required by the Israeli
Tax Ruling, no amounts will be deducted or withheld with respect to the making
of such payment under the Ordinance. Any withheld amounts will be treated for
all purposes of this Agreement as having been paid to the Persons otherwise
entitled thereto.

 



 

 



   



 

1.9 _ _Termination of Exchange Fund.__

 



 

Any portion of the Exchange Fund that remains undistributed to the holders of
the OIL Ordinary Shares following twelve (12) months from the Closing Date
will be delivered to OTI, upon its demand, and any holders of the OIL Ordinary
Shares who have not theretofore complied with this Article I will thereafter
look only to OTI for the Share Exchange Consideration and any dividends or
other distributions with respect to OTI Common Stock to which they are
entitled pursuant to this Article I. Any portion of the Exchange Fund (and all
dividends or other distributions payable pursuant to Section 1.7) remaining
unclaimed by holders of OIL Ordinary Shares as of a date which is immediately
prior to such time as such amounts would otherwise escheat to or become
property of any Governmental Authority will, to the extent permitted by
applicable Law, become the property of OTI free and clear of any claims or
interest of any Person previously entitled thereto.

 



 

1.10 _ _Lost Certificates.__

 



 

If any certificate representing OIL Ordinary Shares has been lost, stolen or
destroyed, upon the making of an affidavit of that fact by the Person claiming
such certificate to be lost, stolen or destroyed, and, if required by OTI or
the Exchange Agent, the posting by such Person of a bond in such amount as OTI
or the Exchange Agent may direct, as indemnity against any claim that may be
made against it with respect to such certificate, the Exchange Agent will
deliver, in exchange for such lost, stolen or destroyed certificate, the Share
Exchange Consideration to be paid in respect of the OIL Ordinary Shares
formerly represented thereby pursuant to this Article I.

2.1 _ _The 1 st Internal Transfer__. Subject to the occurrence of the
Closing, the consummation of the 1st Internal Transfer will take place at the
offices of OTI Counsel, within three (3) Business Days following the Closing
(or such other place, time and date agreed to by the Parties) by way of OIL
executing and delivering to OTI, for no consideration, a stock power deed, in
a form reasonably acceptable to OTI, evidencing the transfer of all shares of
OTI Common Stock owned by OIL to OTI. In accordance with the resolution of the
board of directors of OTI approving this Agreement, each share of OTI Common
Stock that is transferred to OTI as part of the 1st Internal Transfer will,
immediately following the 1st Internal Transfer, automatically be canceled and
will cease to exist.

 



 

2.2 _ _The 2 nd Internal Transfer__. Subject to the occurrence of the 1st
Internal Transfer, the consummation of the 2nd Internal Transfer will take
place at the offices of OTI Counsel, promptly following the 1st Internal
Transfer, and in no event earlier than one Business Day thereafter (or such
other place, time and date agreed to by the Parties), by way of (i) OTI
executing and delivering to OIL a share transfer deed, in a form reasonably

effect on OTI as a result of consummation of the Transactions contemplated
hereby.

COVENANTS 

---|--- 
 



 

5.1 _ _Prospectus Exemption__ _._

 



 

OTI and OIL intend that, and will cooperate to the extent required so that,
the issuance of the OTI Common Stock in connection with the Share Exchange
will be exempt from registration under the Securities Act by reason of Section
3(a)(10) thereof and from the need to publish a prospectus by reason of
Section 15A(a)(3) of the Israel Securities Law, in each case in reliance on
the Court Approval. The parties acknowledge that one of the effects of the
Section 3(a)(10) exemption is that the resale of shares of OTI Common Stock
issued pursuant to this Agreement to and held by Persons who are "affiliates"
of OTI or OIL for purposes of Rule 144 under the Securities Act is subject to
the restrictions set forth in the Securities Act and the regulations
promulgated thereunder.

 



 

5.2 _ _OIL Meetings; Court Approval__ _._

 



 

(a) As promptly as practicable after the execution and delivery of this
Agreement, OIL and OSIL shall prepare and submit to the District Court of Tel

manner and content set forth in the Companies Law and the regulations
promulgated pursuant to Sections 350 and 351 of the Companies Law (the "
_Arrangement Regulations_ ") and as shall be ordered by the Applicable Court,
shareholders meeting (and, if necessary, creditors' meetings) (together, the "
_OIL_ _Meetings_ "), for the approval of the terms and conditions of an
arrangement among OIL and its shareholders, including the Share Exchange, the
Merger and the other Transactions, together with a request to exempt from the
need to publish a prospectus by reason of Section 15A(a)(3) of the Israel
Securities Law (collectively, the " _Arrangement_ "), by a majority in number
(per capita) of shareholders (or, if applicable creditors) present ,by person
or by proxy, representing at least seventy-five percent (75%) of the votes
cast in each of the OIL Meetings; provided that, with respect to the OIL
Meeting of the OIL shareholders, either (A) the shares voting in favor of such
matters include at least a majority of the shares voted by shareholders who
are not the OIL Principal Shareholders, or (B) the total number of shares
voted against the resolution by the shareholders described in clause (A) does
not exceed two percent (2%) of the outstanding OIL Ordinary Shares (or as
otherwise ordered by the Applicable Court, the " _Section 350 Vot_ _ing
Approval_ "). Such motion shall state, among other things, that the Court
Approval would be relied upon by the Parties as an approval of the Share
Exchange for the purpose of qualifying the issuance of shares of OTI Common
Stock hereunder for the Section 3(a)(10) exemption from the registration
requirements of the Securities Act. OIL shall comply with all applicable
requirements of the Companies Law, the Arrangement Regulations and as required
by the Applicable Court. As promptly as practicable following the approval of
the Arrangement by the OIL Shareholders (and, if necessary, OIL's or OSIL's
creditors), OIL will submit to the Applicable Court a second motion requesting
that the Applicable Court (i) hold a hearing on the fairness of the
Arrangement and approve the fairness of the terms and conditions of the Share
Exchange, regardless of whether or not any objections to the Arrangement shall
have been raised, and (ii) approve the Arrangement and the order of all
actions to be taken in accordance therewith (these approvals, when obtained,
shall be collectively referred to as the " _Court Approval_ "). OIL shall
provide notice of the fairness hearing in accordance with the Arrangement
Regulations.

 



 

(b) OIL shall, and shall use commercially reasonable efforts to cause its
Representatives to, perform all activities with respect to the preparation and
filing of the motions with respect to the Court Approval and all other

shall use commercially reasonable efforts to cause their Representatives to,
assist with all activities with respect to the preparation and filing of the
motions with respect to the Court Approval and all other documents prepared
with respect to the Arrangement as may be requested by OIL. OTI and OSIL shall
promptly provide to OIL all such information concerning their business and
financial statements and affairs as reasonably may be required or appropriate
for inclusion in any motions to be filed in connection with the Arrangement.
Prior to the filing of each such motion with the Applicable Court, OIL shall
provide OTI with a reasonable opportunity to review and comment on drafts of
the motion (and will consider in good faith the comments thereof), and any and
all disclosure regarding OTI and OSIL included therein shall be approved in
advance by OTI, such approval not to be unreasonably withheld or delayed.

 



 

 



   



 

(c) OIL shall call, notice, convene, hold, conduct and solicit all proxies
in connection with the OIL Meetings in compliance with all applicable Law,
including the Companies Law, the Arrangement Regulations and the OIL Charter
Documents, and, to the extent applicable, file the same with the ISA and TASE
(the " _OIL Proxy Statement_ "). OIL may adjourn or postpone the OIL Meetings
(i) to the extent necessary to ensure that any supplement or amendment to the
OIL Proxy Statement that it determines in good faith is required by Law (which
determination will not be made until after consultation with OTI) to be
provided to the OIL Shareholders (and creditors, if applicable) in advance of
the OIL Meetings, (ii) if, as of the time that the OIL Meetings are scheduled,
there are insufficient OIL Ordinary Shares (or insufficient principal amount
of creditors, if applicable) represented (either in person or proxy) to
constitute a quorum necessary to conduct the business of the OIL Meetings, or
(iii) if, as of the time that the OIL Meetings are scheduled, adjournment of
the OIL Meeting(s) is necessary to enable OIL to solicit additional proxies if
there are not sufficient votes in favor of the Section 350 Voting Approval.
OIL will include the OIL Recommendation in the OIL Proxy Statement.

 



 

(d) To the extent required by the Applicable Court, OSIL shall call,
notice, convene, hold, conduct and solicit all proxies in connection with the
Arrangement in compliance with all applicable Law, including the Companies
Law, the Arrangement Regulations and the OSIL Charter Documents.

 



 

5.3 _ _OTI Stockholder Consent.__

 



 

As promptly as practicable after the execution and delivery of this Agreement,

_Stockholder Written Consent_ "), to OIL for the purpose of obtaining the OTI
Stockholder Approval. As soon as reasonably practicable after the Stockholder
Written Consent has been duly executed by OIL, OTI shall mail to all

and pay for in full a prepaid "tail" insurance policy, with a claims period of
at least seven years from the Effective Time with respect to directors' and
officers' liability insurance in amount and scope at least as favorable as
OIL's existing insurance policies for claims arising from facts or events that
occurred prior to the Effective Time (including matters, acts or omissions
occurring in connection with the approval of or entering into this Agreement
or the consummation of the Transactions); provided that OIL shall not pay a
premium of more than $950,000.

 



 

(c) In the event that OTI, the Surviving Company or any of their
respective successors or assigns (i) consolidates with or merges into any
other Person and is not the continuing or surviving company or entity of such
consolidation or merger or (ii) transfers or conveys all or substantially all
of its properties and assets to any Person, then, and in each such case,
proper provision will be made so that __ the successors and assigns of OTI and
the Surviving Company will assume all of the obligations of set forth in this
Section 5.15.

 



 

(d) The provisions of this Section 5.15 are (i) intended to be for the
benefit of, and shall be enforceable by, each Indemnitee, his or her heirs and
his or her representatives and (ii) in addition to, and not in substitution
for, any other rights to indemnification or contribution that any such Person
may have by contract or otherwise. The obligations of OTI and the Surviving
Company under this Section 5.15 may not be terminated or modified in such a
manner as to adversely affect the rights of any Indemnitee to whom this
Section 5.15 applies unless the affected Indemnitee has consented in writing
to such termination or modification (it being expressly agreed that the
Indemnitees to whom this Section 5.15 applies will be third party
beneficiaries of this Section 5.15).

 



 

 



   



 

5.16 _ _Tax Matters.__

 



 

(a) This Agreement is intended to constitute a "plan of reorganization" within
the meaning of Treasury Regulations Section 1.368-2(g). The Parties intend
that the Share Exchange, the Merger and the other Transactions qualify as a
"reorganization" within the meaning of Section 368(a) of the Code and the
Treasury Regulations and will report it as such for all U.S. and local income
tax purposes. None of the Parties will take any action or fail to take any
action (including by way of failing to make appropriate tax elections) which
action or failure would cause the Share Exchange, the Merger or the other
Transactions to fail to qualify as a "reorganization" within the meaning of
Section 368(a) of the Code and the Treasury Regulations. Each of OTI, OSIL and
OIL agrees to cooperate with one another and to provide to the other Parties
such information and documentation as may be necessary, proper or advisable,
to cause the Share Exchange, the Merger and the other Transactions to qualify
as a "reorganization" within the meaning of Section 368(a) of the Code and the
Treasury Regulations and comply with the Israeli Tax Ruling.

 



 

(b) Subject to the terms and conditions hereof, each of the Parties shall use
reasonable commercial efforts to promptly take, or cause to be taken, all
action and to do, or cause to be done, all things necessary, proper or
advisable under applicable Law to obtain and maintain the Israeli Tax Ruling
in full force and effect.

 



 

5.17 _ _Affiliate Agreements.__

 



 

By way of execution of this Agreement, each of the Parties agrees that,
subject to and effective as of the Closing, the Contracts listed in Section
5.17 of the OTI Disclosure Letter shall be terminated and be of no further
force and effect.

 



 

5.18 _ _Section 16 Matters.__

 



 

Prior to the Effective Time, OTI shall take all such steps as may be required
(to the extent permitted under applicable Law) to cause any dispositions or
acquisitions of OTI Common Stock (including derivative securities with respect
thereto) resulting from the transactions contemplated by Section 1 of this
Agreement by each individual who is subject to the reporting requirements of
Section 16(a) of the Exchange Act with respect to OTI to be exempt under Rule
16b-3 promulgated under the Exchange Act.

---|--- 
 



 

7.1 _ _Basis for Termination.__ __

principal cause of or resulted in the failure to obtain the OTI Stockholder

OSIL creditors, if applicable) and such action or failure to act constitutes a
material breach by OTI or OSIL of this Agreement;

 



 

(ii) if (A) the Section 350 Voting Approval (OIL shareholders and, if

(solely of OIL shareholders) is not obtained until 11:59 p.m. (IL time) on

Agreement under this clause shall not be available to OIL where the action or

competent jurisdiction has issued an Order or taken any other action (which
the terminating Party must have complied with its obligations hereunder to

prohibiting any material component of the Transactions, and such Order or
other action becomes final and non-appealable.

 



 

 



   



 

(c) by OTI:

 



 

(i) if OIL materially breaches any of its representations and warranties
or covenants and agreements contained in this Agreement, which breach cannot
be or has not been cured within 30 days after the giving of written notice to

this Agreement will be deemed a material breach of this Agreement; provided
however that OTI may not terminate this Agreement pursuant to this clause if
it shall have materially breached this Agreement;

 



 

(ii) if any condition set forth in Section 6.1 or Section 6.3 becomes
incapable of fulfillment, and has not been waived by OTI to the extent
waivable under applicable Law; provided, however, that in no event may OTI
terminate this Agreement if a condition set forth in Section 6.1 becomes
incapable of fulfillment due to a material breach by OTI of any of its
representations, warranties or covenants set forth in this Agreement; or

the OIL Proxy Statement.

 



 

(d) by OIL:

 



 

(i) if OTI or OSIL materially breaches any of its representations and
warranties or covenants and agreements contained in this Agreement, which
breach cannot be or has not been cured within 30 days after the giving of
written notice to OTI of such breach; it being understood that any breach of
Section 5.12 of this Agreement will be deemed a material breach of this
Agreement; provided however that OIL may not terminate this Agreement pursuant
to this clause if it shall have materially breached this Agreement;

 



 

(ii) if any condition set forth in Section 6.1 or Section 6.2 become
incapable of fulfillment, and has not been waived by OIL to the extent
waivable under applicable Law, provided, however, that in no event may OIL
terminate this Agreement if a condition set forth in Section 6.1 becomes
incapable of fulfillment due to a material breach by OIL of any of its
representations, warranties or covenants set forth in this Agreement; or

 



 

(iii) if the OTI Special Committee (A) withdraws, or modifies in a manner
adverse to OIL or publicly proposes to withdraw or modify in a manner adverse
to OIL, its recommendation of this Agreement or any of the Transactions, (B)

the OTI Recommendation in the OTI Information Statement.

 



 

7.2 _ _Effect of Termination.__

 



 

(a) If this Agreement is terminated, the Transactions will terminate
without further action by any Party, this Agreement will become void and of no
further force and effect, except for the provisions of this Section 7.2 and
Article VIII (other than Section 8.12, which will terminate with the other
provisions of this Agreement except as specifically provided herein)
containing general provisions. Nothing in this Article VII will be deemed to
release any Party from any Liability resulting from any fraud or willful and
intentional breach by such Party of any of its representations, warranties or
covenants herein, or to impair the right of any Party to compel specific
performance by another Party of its obligations under this Agreement (whether
or not the breach was willful and intentional) that specifically survive such
termination as set forth in the immediately preceding sentence.

MISCELLANEOUS 

---|--- 
 



 

8.1 _ _Nonsurvival of Representations, Warranties and Agreements__ _._

 



 

None of the representations and warranties in this Agreement or in any
instrument delivered pursuant to this Agreement shall survive the Effective
Time. This Section 8.1 shall not limit (i) any covenant or agreement which by
its terms contemplates performance after the Effective Time or (ii) any
representations and warranties, covenants or agreements contained in the Other
Transaction Agreements which by their terms contemplate survival or
performance after the Effective Time.

 



 

8.2 _ _Expenses.__

 



 

Except as otherwise provided in this Agreement or any of the Other Transaction
Agreements, all fees and expenses incurred in connection with the Transactions
will be paid by the Party incurring such fees or expenses.

 



 

8.3 _ _Entire Agreement.__ __

 



 

This Agreement and the Other Transaction Agreements, including any related
annexes, schedules and exhibits, as well as any other agreements and documents
referred to herein and therein, will together constitute the entire agreement
between the Parties with respect to the subject matter hereof and thereof and
will supersede all prior negotiations, agreements and understandings of the
Parties of any nature, whether oral or written, with respect to such subject
matter, which is hereby terminated and of no further force or effect. If there
is a conflict between any provision of this Agreement and a provision of the
Other Transaction Agreements, the provision of this Agreement will control
unless specifically provided otherwise in this Agreement.

 



 

8.4 _ _Governing Law; Jurisdiction; Waiver of Jury Trial.__

 



 

(a) The validity, interpretation and enforcement of this Agreement will
be governed by the Laws of the State of Delaware, without regard to the
conflict of law principles thereof that would result in the application of the
Laws of another jurisdiction; provided, however, that (i) matters involving
the internal corporate affairs of OIL or OSIL shall be governed by the laws of
the State of Israel and (ii) provisions relating to the Court Approval or the
Merger that are required under Israeli law to be governed by Israeli law will
be so governed.

 



 

(b) By execution and delivery of this Agreement, each Party irrevocably
(i) submits and consents to the personal jurisdiction of the state and federal
courts of the State of Delaware for itself and in respect of its property in
the event that any dispute arises out of this Agreement or any of the
Transactions, (ii) agrees that it will not attempt to deny or defeat such
personal jurisdiction by motion or other request for leave from any such
court, and (iii) agrees that it will not bring any action relating to this
Agreement or any of the Transactions in any other court. Each of the Parties
irrevocably and unconditionally waives (and agrees not to plead or claim) any
objection to the laying of venue of any dispute arising out of this Agreement
or any of the Transactions in the state and federal courts of the State of
Delaware, or that any such dispute brought in any such court has been brought
in an inconvenient or improper forum. The Parties further agree that the
mailing by certified or registered mail, return receipt requested, of any
process required by any such court will constitute valid and lawful service of
process against them, without necessity for service by any other means
provided by statute or rule of court.

 



 

 



   



 

(c) EACH PARTY ACKNOWLEDGES AND AGREES THAT ANY CONTROVERSY WHICH MAY
ARISE UNDER THIS AGREEMENT IS LIKELY TO INVOLVE COMPLICATED AND DIFFICULT
ISSUES, AND THEREFORE IT HEREBY IRREVOCABLY AND UNCONDITIONALLY WAIVES ANY
RIGHT IT MAY HAVE TO A TRIAL BY JURY IN RESPECT OF ANY LITIGATION DIRECTLY OR
INDIRECTLY ARISING OUT OF OR RELATING TO THIS AGREEMENT AND ANY OF THE
AGREEMENTS DELIVERED IN CONNECTION HEREWITH OR THE TRANSACTIONS CONTEMPLATED
HEREBY OR THEREBY. EACH PARTY CERTIFIES AND ACKNOWLEDGES THAT (I) NO
REPRESENTATIVE, AGENT OR ATTORNEY OF ANY OTHER PARTY HAS REPRESENTED,
EXPRESSLY OR OTHERWISE, THAT SUCH OTHER PARTY WOULD NOT, IN THE EVENT OF
LITIGATION, SEEK TO ENFORCE EITHER OF SUCH WAIVERS, (II) IT UNDERSTANDS AND
HAS CONSIDERED THE IMPLICATIONS OF SUCH WAIVERS, (III) IT MAKES SUCH WAIVERS
VOLUNTARILY, AND (IV) IT HAS BEEN INDUCED TO ENTER INTO THIS AGREEMENT BY,
AMONG OTHER THINGS, THE MUTUAL WAIVERS AND CERTIFICATIONS IN THIS SECTION
8.4(c).

to the other Party in accordance with the provisions of this Section 8.5.

 



 

8.6 _ _Amendments and Waivers.__

 



 

(a) This Agreement may be amended and any provision of this Agreement may
be waived, provided that any such amendment or waiver will be binding upon a
Party only if such amendment or waiver is set forth in a writing executed by
such Party and, in the case of OTI, with the approval of or by the OTI Special
Committee). No course of dealing between or among any Persons having any
interest in this Agreement will be deemed effective to modify, amend or
discharge any part of this Agreement or any rights or obligations of any Party
under or by reason of this Agreement.

 



 

(b) No delay or failure in exercising any right, power or remedy
hereunder will affect or operate as a waiver thereof; nor will any single or
partial exercise thereof or any abandonment or discontinuance of steps to
enforce such a right, power or remedy preclude any further exercise thereof or
of any other right, power or remedy. The rights and remedies hereunder are
cumulative and not exclusive of any rights or remedies that any Party would
otherwise have. Any waiver, permit, consent or approval of any kind or
character of any breach or default under this Agreement or any such waiver of
any provision of this Agreement must satisfy the conditions set forth in
Section 8.6(a) and will be effective only to the extent in such writing
specifically set forth.

 



 

8.7 _ _No Third-Party Beneficiaries.__ __

 



 

This Agreement is solely for the benefit of the Parties and does not confer on
third parties any remedy, claim, reimbursement, claim of action or other right
in addition to those existing without reference to this Agreement.
Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Indemnitees are intended to be conferred
with the rights and remedies set forth in 5.15 and will be express third party
beneficiaries of Section 5.15.

 



 

 



   



 

8.8 _ _Assignability__ _._

 



 

No Party may assign its rights or delegate its duties under this Agreement
without the prior written consent of the other Parties. Except as provided in
the preceding sentence, any attempted assignment or delegation will be void.

 



 

8.9 _ _Construction.__ __

 



 

The descriptive headings herein are inserted for convenience of reference only
and are not intended to be a substantive part of or to affect the meaning or
interpretation of this Agreement. Whenever required by the context, any
pronoun used in this Agreement, the OTI Disclosure Letter or OIL Disclosure
Letter will include the corresponding masculine, feminine or neuter forms, and
the singular forms of nouns, pronouns, and verbs will include the plural and
vice versa. Reference to any agreement, document, or instrument means such
agreement, document, or instrument as amended or otherwise modified from time
to time in accordance with the terms thereof, and if applicable hereof. The
use of the words "include" or "including" in this Agreement or the OTI
Disclosure Letter or OIL Disclosure Letter will be by way of example rather
than by limitation. The use of the words "or," "either" or "any" will not be
exclusive. The use of the words "deliver," "furnish," "made available" or
"provide" will mean that, with respect to either Party, as the context
requires, or its respective Representatives, that such documents or
information referenced shall have been delivered to the other Party or its
Representatives at least one Business Day prior to the date of this Agreement.
The Parties have participated jointly in the negotiation and drafting of this
Agreement and the Other Transaction Agreements. In the event an ambiguity or
question of intent or interpretation arises, this Agreement will be construed
as if drafted jointly by the Parties, and no presumption or burden of proof
will arise favoring or disfavoring any Party by virtue of the authorship of
any of the provisions of this Agreement. Except as otherwise expressly
provided elsewhere in this Agreement or any Other Transaction Agreement, any
provision herein which contemplates the agreement, approval or consent of, or
exercise of any right of, a Party, such Party may give or withhold such
agreement, approval or consent, or exercise such right, in its sole and
absolute discretion, the Parties hereby expressly disclaiming any implied duty
of good faith and fair dealing or similar concept.

 



 

8.10 _ _Severability.__ __

 



 

The Parties agree that (a) the provisions of this Agreement will be severable
in the event that for any reason whatsoever any of the provisions hereof are
invalid, void or otherwise unenforceable, (b) any such invalid, void or
otherwise unenforceable provisions will be replaced by other provisions which
are as similar as possible in terms to such invalid, void or otherwise
unenforceable provisions but are valid and enforceable, and (c) the remaining
provisions will remain valid and enforceable to the fullest extent permitted
by applicable Law.

 



 

8.11 _ _Counterparts.__ __

 



 

This Agreement may be executed in multiple counterparts (any one of which need
not contain the signatures of more than one Party), each of which will be
deemed to be an original but all of which taken together will constitute one
and the same agreement. This Agreement, and any amendments hereto, to the
extent signed and delivered by means of a facsimile machine or other
electronic transmission, will be treated in all manner and respects as an
original agreement and will be considered to have the same binding legal
effects as if it were the original signed version thereof delivered in person.
At the request of any Party, the other Party will re-execute original forms
thereof and deliver them to the requesting Party. No Party will raise the use
of a facsimile machine or other electronic means to deliver a signature or the
fact that any signature was transmitted or communicated through the use of
facsimile machine or other electronic means as a defense to the formation of a
Contract and each such Party forever waives any such defense.

 



 

 



   



 

8.12 _ _Specific Performance.__ __

 



 

The Parties agree that irreparable damage would occur if any provision of this
Agreement were not performed in accordance with the terms hereof and that the
Parties will be entitled to an injunction or injunctions to prevent breaches
of this Agreement or to enforce specifically the performance of the terms and
provisions hereof, in addition to any other remedy to which they are entitled
at Law or in equity.

 



 

8.13 _ _Disclosure Letters__ _._

 



 

There may be included in the OTI Disclosure Letter and/or the OIL Disclosure
Letter items and information that are not "material," and such inclusion will
not be deemed to be an acknowledgment or agreement that any such item or
information (or any non-disclosed item or information of comparable or greater
significance) is "material," or to affect the interpretation of such term for
purposes of this Agreement. Matters reflected in the OTI Disclosure Letter and
the OIL Disclosure Letter are not necessarily limited to matters required by
this Agreement to be disclosed therein. The OTI Disclosure Letter and the OIL
Disclosure Letter set forth items of disclosure with specific reference to the
particular Section or subsection of this Agreement to which the information in
the OTI Disclosure Letter and the OIL Disclosure Letter, as applicable,
relates; provided, however, that any information set forth in one Section of
such disclosure letter will be deemed to apply to each other Section or
subsection thereof to which its relevance is reasonably apparent on its face.
