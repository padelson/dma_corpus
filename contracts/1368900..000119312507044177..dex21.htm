Working Capital, including reasonable access to employees, financial and other records of the Company and the Purchaser, and other information related to such calculation. If the Seller accepts the Final Statement of Working Capital by delivery of

that does not then have a relationship with the Seller, the Company or the Purchaser, or any of their respective Affiliates (the &#147;<U>Independent Accountant</U>&#148;), to resolve the disagreement and make a determination with respect thereto.
Such determination will be made, and written notice thereof given to the Seller and the Purchaser, within thirty (30)&nbsp;calendar days after such selection. The determination by the Independent Accountant shall be final, binding and conclusive
upon the Seller and the Purchaser. The scope of the Independent Accountant&#146;s engagement (which will not be an audit) shall be limited to the resolution of the disputed items described in the Notice of Disagreement, and the recalculation, if

whose position generally did not prevail in such determination, or if the Independent Accountant determines that neither party could fairly be found to be the prevailing party, then such fees and expenses shall be borne equally by the Seller and the
Purchaser. Within ten (10)&nbsp;calendar days after delivery of a notice of determination by the Independent Accountant as described above, any payment required by <U>Section&nbsp;2.1(c)(iii)</U> hereof shall be made, based on such determination.
