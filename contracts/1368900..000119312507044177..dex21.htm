PURCHASE AND SALE OF SHARES

2.1 _Purchase and Sale of Shares_.

(a) Upon the terms and subject to the conditions set forth herein, at the
Closing, the Purchaser shall purchase from the Seller, and the Seller shall
sell, convey, transfer, assign and deliver to the Purchaser, all of Sellers
right, title and interest in and to the Shares.

(b) As consideration for the purchase and sale of the Shares pursuant to
_Section 2.1(a)_ hereof, but subject to the indemnification obligations under
_Section 9.2_, and further subject to the terms of _Section 2.1(c)_ hereof,
the aggregate amount to be paid for the Shares shall be One Hundred Ten
Million Dollars ($110,000,000), as adjusted in accordance with this _Section
2.1(c)_ (the " _Purchase Price_ "):

(c) The Purchase Price shall be subject to adjustment in accordance with the
following:

(i) For all purposes of and under this Agreement, the term " _Working Capital_
" shall mean (A) the Companys current assets, minus (B) the Companys
current Liabilities, each calculated as of the Closing in accordance with GAAP
applied in a manner consistent with the preparation of the Companys Financial
Statements, _provided_ that the Seller and the Purchaser acknowledge and
agree that Working Capital shall be calculated in a manner consistent with the
procedures, methodologies and assumptions set forth on _Schedule 2.1(c)_
hereto which are in accordance with GAAP. 

(ii) At least five (5) Business Days prior to the Closing, the Seller and the
Company shall cause to be prepared and delivered to the Purchaser a statement
(the " _Estimated Statement of Working Capital_ "), setting forth the Working
Capital as of the Closing (the " _Estimated Working Capital_ "), as estimated
by the Seller and the Company in good faith, based upon the books and records
of the Company, to present fairly and accurately the Working Capital of the
Company as of the Closing Date and in accordance with GAAP and the procedures,
methodologies and assumptions as set forth above. The Purchase Price paid at
Closing shall be increased on a dollar-for-dollar basis by the amount that the
Estimated Working Capital is greater than the Working Capital Threshold, or
decreased on a dollar-for-dollar basis by the amount that the Estimated
Working Capital is less than the Working Capital Threshold.

(iii) As promptly as practicable, but in any event within sixty (60) calendar
days following the Closing, the Purchaser shall cause to be prepared and
delivered to the Seller a statement (the " _Final Statement of Working
Capital_ ") setting forth its determination of Working Capital as of the
Closing (" _Closing Working Capital_ "), which shall (A) be calculated based
upon the books and records of the Company, in accordance with GAAP  



 

-8-  and in a manner consistent with the procedures, methodologies and
assumptions set forth on _Schedule 2.1(c)_ hereto, (B) present fairly
and accurately the Working Capital of the Company as of the Closing Date and
(c) be presented in a manner similar to the Estimated Statement of Working
Capital. The Seller shall have thirty (30) calendar days after receipt of the
Final Statement of Working Capital to review such Final Statement of Working
Capital (the " _Review Period_ "), and shall notify the Purchaser in writing
whether the Seller disputes such Final Statement of Working Capital on or
prior to the expiration of the Review Period. For purposes of the Sellers
review of the Purchasers calculation, the Purchaser shall cooperate with the
Seller with respect to reasonable requests for information with respect to the
Final Statement of Working Capital, including reasonable access to employees,
financial and other records of the Company and the Purchaser, and other
information related to such calculation. If the Seller accepts the Final
Statement of Working Capital by delivery of written notice to the Purchaser,
or by failure to timely deliver a Notice of Disagreement as provided below,
then, within ten (10) Business Days of the Sellers actual or deemed
acceptance, (A) if the amount of the Closing Working Capital is less than the
Estimated Working Capital, then the Seller shall pay to the Purchaser an
amount equal to the difference between the Estimated Working Capital and the
Closing Working Capital, plus interest, or (B) if the amount of the Closing
Working Capital is more than the Estimated Working Capital, the Purchaser
shall pay to Seller an amount equal to the difference between the Estimated
Working Capital and the Closing Working Capital, plus interest. Any interest
on such payments shall be calculated using the prime rate of interest (as
published in the "Money Rates" table of the Eastern U.S. Edition of THE WALL
STREET JOURNAL on the Closing Date) and shall begin on the Closing Date and
end on the date of any such payment.

(iv) If the Seller disputes the Final Statement of Working Capital by
providing timely written notice of such dispute (a " _Notice of Disagreement_
") prior to the expiration of the Review Period, then the Seller and the
Purchaser shall attempt in good faith to resolve and finally determine the
amount of the Closing Working Capital. The Notice of Disagreement delivered
by the Seller shall set forth in reasonable detail the basis for the
disagreement described in the Notice of Disagreement. If the Seller and the
Purchaser are unable to resolve the disagreement within thirty (30) calendar
days following the later of the delivery of the Notice of Disagreement or the
expiration of the Review Period, then the Seller and the Purchaser shall
select a mutually acceptable, nationally recognized independent accounting
firm that does not then have a relationship with the Seller, the Company or
the Purchaser, or any of their respective Affiliates (the " _Independent
Accountant_ "), to resolve the disagreement and make a determination with
respect thereto. Such determination will be made, and written notice thereof
given to the Seller and the Purchaser, within thirty (30) calendar days after
such selection. The determination by the Independent Accountant shall be
final, binding and conclusive upon the Seller and the Purchaser. The scope of
the Independent Accountants engagement (which will not be an audit) shall be
limited to the resolution of the disputed items described in the Notice of
Disagreement, and the recalculation, if any, of the Final Statement of
Working Capital in light of such resolution. If an Independent Accountant is
engaged pursuant to this _Section 2.1(c)(iv)_, the fees and expenses of the
Independent Accountant shall be borne by the party whose position generally
did not prevail in such determination, or if the Independent Accountant
determines that neither party could fairly be found to be the prevailing
party, then such fees and expenses shall be borne equally by the Seller and
the Purchaser. Within ten (10) calendar days after delivery of a notice of
determination by the Independent Accountant as described above, any payment
required by _Section 2.1(c)(iii)_ hereof shall be made, based on such
determination. 



 

-9- 2.2 _Payment of Purchase Price_.

(a) On the Closing Date, the Purchaser shall pay or cause to be paid to the
Seller the amount of One Hundred Ten Million Dollars ($110,000,000), as
adjusted by the provisions of _Section 2.1(c)(ii)_ (" _Cash Payment_ ").

(b) All payments required under this _Section 2.2_ or any other provision
hereof shall be made in cash by wire transfer of immediately available funds
to such bank account(s) as shall be designated in writing by the recipient at
least two (2) Business Days prior to the applicable payment date.

at a closing (the " _Closing_ ") to be held at 10:00 a.m., California time,
on a date to be designated by the Seller and the Purchaser, which date shall
be the later of (i) the second (2nd) Business Day after satisfaction and

conditions set forth in  _Article VII_ hereof, and (ii) February 28, 2007
(the " _Closing Date_ "), at the offices of Orrick, Herrington and Sutcliffe
LLP, 405 Howard Street, San Francisco, California 94105, unless another time,

delivered by the Seller to the Purchaser on or before the Closing pursuant to

terms, except as such enforceability may be limited by (a) the effect of any
applicable Laws of general application relating to bankruptcy,
reorganization, insolvency, moratorium or similar Laws affecting creditors
rights and relief of debtors generally, and (b) the effect of rules of Law and

cause such Persons to cooperate with the Purchaser and its Representatives in
such consultations and in verifying such information.

 

6.3 _Confidentiality_.

(a) The terms of the Confidentiality Agreement are hereby incorporated herein
by reference and shall continue in full force and effect from and after the
Closing in accordance with the terms thereof, such that the information
obtained by any party hereto, or its Representatives, during any
investigation conducted pursuant to Section 6.2 hereof, in connection with the
negotiation, execution and performance of this Agreement, the consummation of
the transactions contemplated hereby, or otherwise, shall be governed by the
terms set forth in the Confidentiality Agreement. From the Execution Date, to
the extent of any conflict in the provisions of the Confidentiality Agreement
and the provisions of Section 6.3(b)  (h) below, the provisions of Section
6.3(b)  (h) shall control.

(b) " _Confidential Information_ " means information that is disclosed or
made available by or on behalf of a party hereto or its Affiliates
(collectively the " _Disclosing Party_ ") to the other party (together with
its directors, officers, employees and authorized contractors, the "
_Receiving Party_ ") in connection with either partys performance of its
obligations and duties or exercise of its rights pursuant to this Agreement
and the Ancillary Agreements. Confidential Information may be disclosed in
written or other tangible form (including on magnetic media) or by oral,
visual or other means. Confidential Information does not include any
information which: (i) prior to, at, or after Receiving Partys receipt, is
published or becomes otherwise known by or available to the public through no
act or omission by Receiving Party in violation hereof or other wrongful act;
(ii) is provided to Receiving Party without restriction by a person or entity
(other than Disclosing Party) who has a bona fide right to make such
information available without restriction; or (iii) is independently developed
by or on behalf of Receiving Party without use of the Confidential
Information of Disclosing Party. For the avoidance of doubt, (X) 



 

-30-  Accessed Information, (Y) information in any form, that is received or
learned by Purchaser regarding Seller or its Affiliates employees, customers
or potential customers, whether in personally identifiable form or not, and
(Z) Seller "CPNI" (as that term is or may subsequently be defined in the
Communications Act of 1934, as amended, and in the implementing
rules, regulations and orders of the FCC), shall be deemed to be Seller
Confidential Information. In addition to any restrictions under this Agreement
or the Ancillary Agreements, Purchasers access to, and use of Seller CPNI
shall be subject to the requirements and restrictions on use contained in
such act. For the avoidance of doubt, following the Closing, (i) except where
Purchaser acts as an agent of Seller or SureWest Telephone, Purchaser shall
not be bound by any of the restrictions contained in this Section 6.3 (as a
Receiving Party) with respect to Confidential Information of the Company, and
(ii) Seller shall be bound by the restrictions contained in this Section 6.3
(as a Receiving Party) with respect to the Confidential Information of the
Company.

(c) The Receiving Party agrees to maintain in strict confidence all
Confidential Information. Receiving Party will use the Confidential
Information only for the specific purposes contemplated under this Agreement
or the Ancillary Agreements. Receiving Party will not, without obtaining
Disclosing Partys prior written consent, use a Disclosing Partys
Confidential Information for the marketing of services to the Disclosing Party
or its Affiliates, nor will Receiving Party use the Disclosing Partys
Confidential Information in order to contact Disclosing Partys customers or
employees (other than in connection with a partys performance of its
obligations under any agreements between the parties) without obtaining the
Disclosing Partys prior written consent. The Receiving Party will use, and
will take commercially reasonable steps to arrange for other persons
authorized to receive the Disclosing Partys Confidential Information to use,
the same degree of care to protect the Disclosing Partys Confidential
Information as it uses to protect its own confidential information, but in no
event less than a reasonable degree of care. Notwithstanding any provision in
this Agreement or the Ancillary Agreements to the contrary, neither party nor
any of its respective Affiliates shall intercept, collect, retain or
otherwise use the content of any Confidential Information except as is
reasonably necessary to carry out the terms of this Agreement or the Ancillary
Agreements, is otherwise permitted by this Agreement or the Ancillary
Agreement, or subject to the terms of Section 6.3(e), pursuant to a valid
order of a judicial or other competent authority.

(d) Except as expressly provided in this Agreement or the Ancillary
Agreements, a Receiving Party shall not have any rights of use or ownership in
the Confidential Information. The Disclosing Party makes no representation or
warranty as to accuracy or completeness of any Confidential Information, all
of which is provided on an "as is" basis. Except as expressly provided in this
Agreement or the Ancillary Agreements, all Confidential Information of a
Disclosing Party shall remain the property of such Disclosing Party and shall
either be returned by the Receiving Party to the Disclosing Party or destroyed
upon request of the Disclosing Party. Upon such request, any
abstracts, notes, memoranda or other documents containing any Confidential
Information or any description, summary or analysis of any Confidential
Information of the Disclosing Party shall be delivered to the Disclosing Party
by the Receiving Party, or at the option of the Receiving Party, destroyed,
provided that the Receiving Party provides written certification of such
destruction signed by an officer of the Receiving Party upon written request
of Disclosing Party. Notwithstanding any return of Confidential Information,
all Confidential Information, including oral Confidential Information, will
continue  



 

-31-  to be subject to the provisions of this Agreement and the Ancillary
Agreements. Notwithstanding the foregoing, a Receiving Party may retain copies
of such Confidential Information in accordance with policies and procedures
implemented by such persons in order to comply with applicable laws,
regulations or other legal requirements; _provided however_ that the
provisions of this Agreement limiting use and disclosure of Confidential
Information shall continue to apply, notwithstanding the expiration of the
term of this Agreement, so long as a Receiving Party retains copies of such
Confidential Information.

(e) In the event that a Receiving Party is requested or becomes legally
compelled (by oral questions, interrogatories, requests for information or
documents, subpoena, investigative demand, or similar process) to disclose any
of the Confidential Information, the Receiving Party will promptly provide the
Disclosing Party with notice so that the Disclosing Party may seek
a protective order or other appropriate remedy or waive compliance with the
provisions of this Agreement. If, in the absence of a protective order or
other remedy or waiver, the Receiving Party is, in the opinion of its counsel,
legally compelled to disclose such Confidential Information to any tribunal
or else stand liable for contempt or suffer other censure or penalty, the
Receiving Party will furnish only that portion of the Confidential Information
which is legally required to be furnished and will exercise its commercially
reasonable efforts to obtain reliable assurance that confidential treatment
will be accorded such Confidential Information.

(f) Each Party acknowledges that any disclosure or misappropriation of the
other Partys Confidential Information in violation of this Agreement could
cause irreparable harm, the amount of which may be extremely difficult to
determine, thus potentially making any remedy at law or in damages inadequate.
Each Party agrees that money damages might not be a sufficient remedy for any
breach or threatened breach of this Section by a Receiving Party, its
Affiliates or their respective officers, employees or contractors and that the
Disclosing Party shall be entitled, as may be determined by a court of
competent jurisdiction, to specific performance and injunctive or other
equitable relief in the event of any such breach or threatened breach, in
addition to all other remedies available to the Disclosing Party at law or in
equity.

(g) Except as expressly provided for in this Agreement, the Accessed
Information may not be copied, stored in electronic form or distributed or
made available to any persons or parties other than designated Purchaser
employees; _provided, however,_ that Purchaser may provide access to the
Accessed Information to specific contract employees or consultants who (i)
are identified in a writing delivered to Seller in advance of such access;
(ii) have agreed in writing to be bound by all of the use and non-disclosure
obligations and restrictions of this Agreement or an Ancillary Agreement; and
(iii) will be accessing the Accessed Information through equipment that is
under the supervision and control of Purchaser. Each of Purchaser and Seller
will be liable for any breach of the provisions of this Section 6.3 by any of
its respective officers, employees or contractors. In the event that a party
becomes aware of an unpermitted third party disclosure of Confidential
Information hereunder, such party shall promptly notify the other of such
disclosure, and cooperate in the response and remediation of the disclosure.
Each party will at all times comply with the systems access, security and
privacy policies established from time to time by the other party. Each of the
Purchaser and Seller represents that it has adopted an employee code of
conduct which includes policies governing the safeguarding and use of third-
party information.



 

-32- (h) In addition to the foregoing, Purchaser acknowledges that there may be
circumstances wherein Purchaser or its employees and authorized contractors
are provided with the technical ability to access information in or execute
functions of systems or databases of Seller, but which Seller has not agreed
to permit Purchaser to in fact access or execute. Accordingly, where Seller
has instructed Purchaser as to the appropriate scope of access to information
in Seller systems and databases, or the appropriate scope of functions which
Purchaser may execute, Purchaser acknowledges that it would be a material
breach of this Agreement for Purchaser, its employees or contractors to either
access information or to execute functions in excess of the permission granted
by Seller. Seller further reserves the right to implement additional logical
or technical restrictions, or segregation of databases, systems or functions,
as it deems necessary to meet legal, regulatory or contractual obligations of
Seller, or to adhere to then-current corporate policies, provided
however, that Sellers actions under this provision shall not affect Sellers
obligations to deliver service as otherwise specified in this Agreement.

6.4 _Further Actions and HSR Act_.

(a) Upon the terms and subject to the conditions set forth in this Agreement,
the Seller, the Company and the Purchaser shall each use their respective
commercially reasonable efforts to take, or cause to be taken all appropriate

other party hereto in doing, all things reasonably necessary, proper or
advisable under applicable Laws to consummate the transactions contemplated

States Department of Justice (the " _DOJ_ ") the notification and report
form, if any, required for the transactions described herein and any
supplemental information requested in connection therewith pursuant to the HSR
Act. Any such notification and report form and supplemental information
shall be in substantial compliance with the requirements of the HSR Act. Each
of the Seller and the Purchaser shall furnish to the other such necessary
information and reasonable assistance as the other may request in connection
with its preparation of any filing or submission that is necessary under the
HSR Act.  



 

-33-  The Seller and the Purchaser shall keep each other apprised of the status of
any communications with, and any inquiries or requests for
additional information from, the FTC and the DOJ and use commercially
reasonable efforts to comply promptly with any such inquiry or request.

6.5  _Fulfillment of Conditions by the Seller and the Company_. Neither the
Seller nor the Company shall knowingly take or cause to be taken, or fail to
take or cause to be taken, any action that would cause the conditions to the
obligations of the Seller, the Company or the Purchaser to consummate the
transactions contemplated hereby to fail to be satisfied or fulfilled at or
prior to the Closing, including, without limitation, by taking or causing to
be taken, or failing to take or cause to be taken any action that would cause
the representations and warranties made by the Seller in _Article IV_ hereof
to fail to be true and correct as of the Closing in all material respects. The
Seller and the Company shall take, or cause to be taken, all commercially
reasonable actions within their power to cause to be satisfied or fulfilled,
at or prior to the Closing, the conditions precedent to the Purchasers
obligations to consummate the transactions contemplated hereby as set forth
in _Section 7.1_ hereof.

6.6 _Fulfillment of Conditions by the Purchaser_. The Purchaser shall not

including, without limitation, by taking or causing to be taken, or failing to
take or cause to be taken, any action that would cause the representations and
warranties made by the Purchaser in  _Article V_ hereof to fail to be true

take, or cause to be taken, all commercially reasonable actions within its
power to cause to be satisfied or fulfilled, at or prior to the Closing, the

made, any press release or public announcement concerning the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement without the consent of the other party hereto,
except as otherwise required by applicable Law, but in any event only after

requirements.

in connection with the negotiation, execution and performance of this

soon as practicable following the Closing, the Purchaser shall deliver to the

(a) _Tax Periods Ending on or before the Closing Date_. The Seller shall
prepare or cause to be prepared and file or cause to be filed all Tax Returns
for the Company for all Tax periods ending on or prior to the Closing Date
which are filed after the Closing Date. To the extent permitted by applicable
Law with respect to any particular Tax regarding the Company, the Company
shall elect to treat the Closing Date as the last day of the taxable period.
All such Tax Returns for the Company shall be prepared and filed on a basis
consistent with prior Tax Returns filed for the Company (except to the extent
counsel for the Seller determines that a Tax Return cannot be so prepared and
filed or an item so reported without being subject to penalties). Seller shall
permit the Purchaser to review and comment on each such Tax Return described
in the preceding sentence prior to filing and shall make such revisions to
such Tax Returns as are reasonably requested by the Purchaser; _provided,
however,_ that for the avoidance of doubt, any Tax Returns which are required
to be filed with respect to Company on a consolidated, unitary or other
combined basis with the Seller or the appropriate parent shall not be
delivered to Purchaser and subject to review and comment. The Seller shall pay
all Taxes of the Company with respect to tax periods ending on or before the
Closing Date, or shall reimburse Purchaser for Taxes of the Company with
respect to such periods within fifteen (15) days after payment by the Company
of such Taxes, except to the extent that such Taxes are included in the
calculation of Closing Working Capital in which case Purchaser shall pay such
Tax amount.

(b) _Tax Periods Beginning Before and Ending After the Closing Date_. The
Purchaser shall prepare or cause to be prepared and file or cause to be filed
any Tax Returns of the Company for Tax periods which begin before the Closing
Date and end after the Closing Date. All such Tax Returns for the Company
shall be prepared and filed on a basis consistent with prior Tax Returns filed
for the Company (except to the extent counsel for the Purchaser determines
that a Tax Return cannot be so prepared and filed or an item so reported
without being subject to penalties). The Purchaser shall permit the Seller to
review and comment on each such Tax Return described in the preceding sentence
prior to filing and shall make such revisions to such Tax Returns as
are reasonably requested by the Seller. The Seller shall reimburse the
Purchaser within fifteen (15) days after the date on which Taxes are paid with
 



 

-35-  respect to such periods an amount equal to the portion of such Taxes which
relates to the portion of such Tax period ending on the Closing Date, except
to the extent that such Taxes are included in the calculation of Closing
Working Capital. For purposes of the preceding sentence, Taxes shall be
allocated in the manner set forth in _Section 6.10(h)_.

(c) _Refunds_. Any Tax refunds that are received by the Purchaser or the
Company, and any amounts credited against Tax to which the Purchaser or the
Company become entitled, that relate to Tax periods or portions thereof ending
on or before the Closing Date or allocable to the period up to and including
the Closing Date for a straddle period (allocated in a manner set forth
in Section 6.10(h)) shall be for the account of the Seller, and the Purchaser
shall pay over to the Seller any such refund or the amount of any such credit
within fifteen (15) days after receipt or entitlement thereto, except to the
extent such refund amounts are reflected as a current asset on the Latest
Balance Sheet and included in the calculation of Closing Working Capital, in
which case they shall be retained by the Purchaser.

(d) _Cooperation on Tax Matters_. The Purchaser, the Company and the Seller
shall cooperate fully, as and to the extent reasonably requested by the other
party, in connection with the filing of Tax Returns pursuant to this Agreement
and any audit, litigation or other proceeding with respect to Taxes. Such
cooperation shall include the retention and (upon the other partys request)
the provision of records and information which are reasonably relevant to any
such audit, litigation or other proceeding and making employees available on a
mutually convenient basis to provide additional information and explanation of
any material provided hereunder. The Company and the Seller agree to retain
all books and records with respect to Tax matters pertinent to the Company
relating to any Taxable period beginning before the Closing Date until the
expiration of the statute of limitations (and, to the extent notified by the
Purchaser or the Seller, any extensions thereof) of the respective Taxable
periods, and to abide by all record retention agreements entered into with any
Taxing authority. The Purchaser and the Seller further agree, upon request,
to use their commercially reasonable efforts to obtain any certificate or
other document from any Governmental Entity or any other Person as may be
necessary to mitigate, reduce or eliminate any Tax that could be imposed
(including, but not limited to, with respect to the transactions contemplated
hereby).

(e) _Certain Taxes_. All transfer, documentary, sales, use, stamp,
registration and other such Taxes and fees (including any penalties and
interest) incurred in connection with this Agreement (collectively, "
_Transfer Taxes_ ") shall be paid by the Seller when due, and the Seller
will, at its own expense, file all necessary Tax Returns and other
documentation with respect to all such Transfer Taxes and, if required by
applicable Law, the Purchaser will, and will cause its Affiliates to, join in
the execution of any such Tax Returns and other documentation.

(f) _Tax Elections and Amendments_. The Company shall not make or change any
election with respect to Taxes, settle or compromise any material Liability
with respect to Taxes or file an amended Tax Return after the date hereof
which would adversely affect the Seller without Sellers prior
written consent (which shall not be unreasonably withheld).

(g) _Characterization of Payments_. Any payments made to the Seller, the
Company or the Purchaser pursuant to _Section 6.10_ or _Section 9.2(a)_
shall constitute an adjustment of the consideration paid for the Shares for
Tax purposes and shall be treated as such by the Purchaser, the Company and
the Seller on their Tax Returns to the extent permitted by Law.



 

-36- (h) _Allocation of Straddle Period Tax_. To the extent permitted by applicable
Law with respect to any particular Tax regarding the Company, the Company
shall elect to treat the Closing Date as the last day of the taxable period.
For purposes of determining the amount of Taxes that are attributable to the
portion of the period up to and including the Closing Date with respect to a
Tax period beginning before and ending after the Closing Date (i) in the case
of any Taxes other than Taxes based upon or related to income or receipts, be
deemed to be the amount of such Tax for the entire Tax period (excluding any
increase in Taxes for the period as a result of the transfer of the Shares
pursuant to this Agreement) multiplied by a fraction the numerator of which is
the number of days in the Tax period ending on the Closing Date and the
denominator of which is the number of days in the entire Tax period, and (ii)
in the case of any Tax based upon or related to income or receipts, be deemed
equal to the amount which would by payable if the relevant Tax period ended
on the Closing Date.

(i) _Section 338(h)(10) Election_. Following the Closing, the Seller shall
join with the Purchaser in making an election under Code Section 338(h)(10)
(and any corresponding election under state, local or foreign law) with
respect to the purchase and sale of the Shares pursuant to this Agreement (the
" _Section 338(h)(10) Election_ "). The Seller will include any income, gain,
loss, deduction or other Tax items resulting from the Section 338(h)(10)
Election on its Tax Returns to the extent required by applicable Law. Seller
shall also pay any Tax imposed on the Company attributable to making the
Section 338(h)(10) Election, including any state, local or foreign Tax imposed
on the Company. The Seller and Purchaser shall cooperate in allocating the
Aggregate Deemed Sale Price (" _ADSP_ "), as defined in Treasury Regulation
§1.338-4, among the Companys assets pursuant to Treasury Regulation §1.338-6
(the " _Allocation_ "). In the event that Seller and Purchaser are unable
to resolve any disagreements regarding the amount of the ADSP or the
Allocation prior to the filing of the Form 8023, the parties shall promptly

Form 8023, in form and substance satisfactory to Purchaser and Seller.
Purchaser will file such Form 8023 in the manner prescribed by applicable
Treasury Regulations and will provide written evidence to Seller that it has
done so.

6.11 _Related Assets and Liabilities_. If any Related Party owns or otherwise
possesses any right, title or interest of any type or nature whatsoever in any
assets that are related to or used in the Business, the Seller shall cause its
Related Parties to transfer such assets including, without limitation, any
Intellectual Property identified on _Schedule 4.7(a)_, free and clear of all
Encumbrances, to the Company or the Purchaser at no cost to the Company or the
Purchaser pursuant to instruments of transfer in form and substance
reasonable satisfactory to the Purchaser. Without limiting the foregoing,
immediately prior to the Closing, the Seller and/or its Affiliates (other than
the Company) shall assume, or cause to be transferred out of the Company, all
indebtedness and obligations of the Company to the Seller and/or its
Affiliates, as well as any other debts or obligations for borrowed money owed
to third parties, other than obligations under the license and/or lease
between the Company and SureWest Telephone described in _Section 6.21_.



 

-37- 6.12 _Employees and Benefit Plans_.

(a) The Seller shall and shall cause the Company to use all reasonable
business efforts to retain the services of the Business Employees through the
Closing Date. The Purchaser shall cause the Company to continue to employ
immediately after the Closing each of the Business Employees at substantially
the same base salary or base hourly rate of compensation as in effect for each
such individual immediately before the Closing and shall provide Business
Employees substantially comparable employee benefits (determined without
regard to defined benefit pension plans or retiree welfare benefit plans). The
Business Employees shall be given credit for time worked for the Company or
its Affiliates (and their predecessors) for purposes of determining their
eligibility to participate and vesting under the applicable employee benefit
plans and programs of the Purchaser or its Affiliates. With respect to
welfare plans maintained by the Purchaser or its Affiliates, the Purchase
shall cause such plans to (i) waive all limitations as to preexisting
conditions and exclusions with respect to participation and
coverage requirements otherwise applicable to Business Employees under such
plan (including, without limitation, any actively at-work requirements) and
(ii) provide each Business Employee with credit for any co-payments,
deductibles and similar payments paid prior to the Closing in satisfying any
analogous requirements applicable under any such welfare plan maintained by
Purchaser or its Affiliates.

(b) Without limiting any of the provisions herein, except as set forth on
_Schedule 6.12(b)_, neither the Purchaser nor any of its Affiliates shall (i)
assume any of the Benefit Plans, or any rights, duties, obligations or
liabilities thereunder other than (A) obligations or liabilities under
individual agreements, if any, entered into by the Company or under Benefit
Plans that are not subject to ERISA maintained by the Company (if any), and
(B) obligations of the Company to make contributions to the Benefit Plans
sponsored by Seller arising prior to the Closing and relating to the Companys
employees and former employees, (ii) become a successor employer or
be responsible in any way for the Sellers participation in or obligations
with respect to any Benefit Plan, or (iii) be obligated by this Agreement to
make any provision with respect to employee benefits after the Closing Date,
except as required by this _Section 6.12_. No assets of any Benefit Plan
shall be transferred to the Purchaser or any of its Affiliates or to any
benefit plan of the Purchaser or its Affiliates. The Seller shall, after the
Closing Date, comply with the continuation coverage requirements of Sections
601 through 609 of ERISA; _provided_ , _however_ , that any such continuing
coverage obligations resulting from a qualifying event that occurs after
Business Employees are enrolled in any health plan of the Purchaser or its
Affiliates shall be the responsibility of the Purchaser or its applicable
Affiliate.

(c) Seller and its ERISA Affiliates shall take all actions necessary so that
following the Closing Date, all Business Employees who participate in any tax
qualified Benefit Plan that is an "employee pension benefit plan" (as
such term is defined under Section 3(2) of ERISA)) (the " _Seller Retirement
Plans_ ") shall be credited with imputed vesting service credit on account of
continued service with the Company for purposes of continuing to vest in
their interest in each such Seller Retirement Plan. Purchaser agrees to
reasonably cooperate with Seller to implement the imputed vesting service
credit. Purchaser further agrees to notify Seller of the employment
termination or re-hire of any such Business Employee and otherwise reasonably
cooperate with Seller to implement the imputed vesting service credit. Such
imputed  



 

-38-  vesting service credit shall otherwise be subject to the terms of the
applicable Seller Retirement Plan. Seller and its ERISA Affiliates shall take
all actions necessary so that as of the Closing Date, no Business Employees
shall accrue any further benefits under any Benefit Plan on account of service
rendered or compensation earned after the Closing Date. As soon as practicable
following the Closing Date, Seller and its ERISA Affiliates shall cause the
account balances of the Business Employees in the SureWest KSOP (and any other
Seller Retirement Plan that is a Section 401(k) plan) to be distributable in
accordance with the terms of such plans (upon the Business Employees
severance from employment within the meaning of IRS Notice 2002-4, 2002-2
I.R.B. 298), and to the extent permitted under applicable Law, Purchaser shall
permit the Business Employees who are participants in such plan(s) and who
are employed by Purchaser following the Closing Date to rollover such
distributions into a 401(k) plan sponsored by the Purchaser.

(d) Notwithstanding anything in this Article VI to the contrary, with respect
to claims arising under any Benefit Plan that is a "welfare plan" (as such
term is defined under Section 3(1) of ERISA), the Seller shall be solely
responsible for any claims for welfare benefits that are incurred by or with
respect to any employee of the Company and his or her beneficiaries or
dependents before the Closing Date and (ii) Purchaser shall be solely
responsible for any claims for welfare benefits that are incurred by or with
respect to any Business Employee and his or her beneficiaries or dependents
on or after the Closing Date. For purposes of the foregoing, a medical/dental
claim shall be considered incurred when the services are rendered, the
supplies are provided or medications are prescribed, and not when the
condition arose.

(e) Subject to applicable Law, Seller and its ERISA Affiliates and Purchaser
shall take all actions necessary or appropriate so that, effective as of the
Closing, (i) the account balances (whether positive, in which case Seller will
transfer cash equal to such balance, or negative, in which case Purchaser will
transfer cash equal to such balance) under the Seller FSAs of the Business
Employees who are participants in the Seller FSAs (the " _Covered Employees_
") shall be transferred to one or more comparable plans of Purchaser to the
extent Purchaser offers such benefits (collectively, the " _Purchaser Flex
Plans_ "); (ii) the elections, contribution levels and coverage levels of the
Covered Employees shall apply under the Purchaser Flex Plans in the same
manner as under the Seller FSAs to the extent Purchaser offers such benefits;
and (iii) the Covered Employees shall be reimbursed from the Purchaser Flex
Plans for claims incurred at any time during the plan year of the Seller FSA
in which the Closing Date occurs and submitted to the Purchaser Flex
Plans from and after the Closing Date substantially on the same basis, terms
and conditions as under the Seller FSAs to the extent Purchaser offers such
benefits.

(f) Notwithstanding any other provision of this Article VI, but subject to
applicable Law, the Purchaser and the Seller and their respective Affiliates
shall cooperate in the timely transfer of all data and information necessary
for the Purchaser to fulfill its obligations to provide benefits or payments
to Business Employees as provided for in this Article VI. 

6.13 _Incentive Bonuses_. The Purchaser acknowledges and agrees that the
Seller may, on or prior to the Closing, pay, or cause to be paid, incentive
bonuses to Business Employees in amounts up to and on the terms and conditions
set forth on _Schedule 6.13_ (" _Incentive Bonuses_ "). Any Incentive Bonus
shall be the sole responsibility of Seller, and neither the Purchaser, the
Company nor any of their Affiliates after the Closing shall assume or have any
liabilities or  



 

-39-  obligations with respect to the Incentive Bonuses. The Seller will take any
and all actions reasonably requested by the Purchaser to facilitate
compliance with any withholding or other legal requirements in respect of the
Incentive Bonuses. For the avoidance of doubt, the Seller and Purchaser agree
that any Tax deduction arising from the payment of the Incentive Bonuses on or
before the Closing Date shall be for the benefit of Seller.

6.14 _Investigation by the Purchaser_. The Purchaser has conducted its
own independent review and analysis of the business, operations, technology,
assets, liabilities, results of operations, financial condition and prospects
of the Company and acknowledges that the Seller has provided the Purchaser
with the access requested by the Purchaser to the personnel, properties,
premises and records of the Company for this purpose. In entering into this
Agreement, the Purchaser has relied upon its own investigation and analysis as
well as the representations and warranties of the Seller contained in this
Agreement and the Ancillary Agreements, and the Purchaser (a) acknowledges
that none of the Seller, the Company nor any of their respective directors,
officers, employees, Affiliates, controlling Persons, agents or
representatives makes or has made any representation or warranty, either
express or implied, as to the accuracy or completeness of any of the
information provided or made available to the Purchaser or its directors,
officers, employees, Affiliates, controlling Persons, agents or
representatives, and (b) agrees, to the fullest extent permitted by Law, that
neither the Seller, the Company nor any of their respective directors,
officers, employees, Affiliates, controlling Persons, agents or
representatives shall have any liability or responsibility whatsoever to the
Purchaser or its directors, officers, employees, Affiliates, controlling
Persons, agents or representatives on any basis (including,
without limitation, in contract or tort, under federal or state securities
Laws or otherwise) based upon any information provided or made available, or
statements made, to the Purchaser or its directors, officers, employees,
Affiliates, controlling Persons, agents or representatives (or any omissions
therefrom), except in the case of clauses (a) and (b) as and only to the
extent expressly set forth in this Agreement with respect to the
representations and warranties of the Seller in Article IV and subject to the
limitations and restrictions contained in this Agreement and the Ancillary
Agreements.

certain of its Affiliates and the Company shall enter into a Transition

_Transition Services Agreement_ ").

Affiliates of the Seller shall enter into a Publishing Agreement,
substantially in the form attached as _Exhibit 6.16_ (the " _Publishing

6.18 _Listings License Agreement_. At the Closing, the Company, the Seller
and certain Affiliates of the Seller shall enter into a Listings License
Agreement substantially in the form attached as _Exhibit 6.18_ (the "
_Listings License Agreement_ ").



 

-40- 6.19 _Licensing Agreement_. At the Closing, the Purchaser and the Seller shall
enter into a Licensing Agreement substantially in the same form attached as
_Exhibit 6.19_ (the " _Licensing Agreement_ ").

6.20  _Billing Services Agreement_. At the Closing, the Purchaser and the
Seller shall enter into a Billing Services Agreement substantially in the form
attached as _Exhibit 6.20_ (the " _Billing Services Agreement_ ").

 

6.21 _Revocable License; Lease_. On or prior to the Closing, SureWest
Telephone, a California corporation (" _SureWest Telephone_ ") shall grant to
the Company a revocable license to use and occupy the space currently used by
the Company in connection with the operation of the Business as of the date
hereof or other reasonably equivalent SureWest Telephone space designated by
Seller with the approval of Purchaser, which approval shall not be
unreasonably withheld (the " _Premises_ "). In the event SureWest Telephone
revokes the license to the Premises during the term of the aforementioned
license or changes the Premises after the Closing Date in accordance with the
preceding sentence, Seller hereby agrees to indemnify the Company and
reimburse it for all documented relocation costs. This license shall provide
for a license fee of $2.50 per square foot, a term of ninety (90) days and
such other terms and conditions as may be mutually agreed to by the Company
and SureWest Telephone with the approval of Purchaser, which approval shall
not be unreasonably withheld. In the event that the Company desires to
continue its existing occupancy of the Premises after the Closing Date for a
period in excess of ninety (90) days, Seller will cause SureWest Telephone to
enter into negotiations with Company for a lease, and to thereafter make such
filings and seek such approvals as are required by Law.

6.22 _Transition of Certain Information_. Prior to or on the Closing Date, or
as reasonably practicable thereafter, the Seller will transfer, or cause to be
transferred, to the Company all books and records relating to the business of
the Company, including without limitation, the books of account,

Affiliates computer systems that are not already owned by and in the

Affiliates to perform their obligations under the Ancillary Agreements,. The

information after Closing until such information is transferred to the
Company.

harmless the Purchaser, its Affiliates and Representatives from and against

attorneys fees and all amounts paid in investigation, defense or settlement
of any of the foregoing (herein, " _Damages_ "), incurred in connection with,

breach of any representation or warranty or the inaccuracy of any
representation or warranty (without giving any effect to any qualifications
as to materiality contained in such representations), made by the Seller or
the Company in this Agreement; (ii) any breach of any covenant or agreement
made by the Seller or the Company in this Agreement; (iii) any Benefit Plan
maintained by the Seller (other than with respect to the Companys obligations
to make contributions to such Benefit Plans arising prior to the Closing and
relating to the Companys employees and former employees); or (iv) any Taxes
of the Company with respect to any Tax period ending on or before the Closing
Date or for any Tax period beginning before and ending after the Closing Date
to the extent allocable (as determining in accordance with _Section 6.10(h)_

for, and shall not be required to indemnify Purchaser, its Affiliates and
Representatives for any Damages to the extent that such amounts were included
in the calculation of Closing Working Capital under _Section 2.1(c)_.

The term "Damages" is not limited to matters asserted by third parties against
an indemnified Person, but includes Damages incurred or sustained by
the indemnified Person in the absence of third party claims. Payments by an
indemnified Person of amounts for which it is indemnified hereunder shall not
be a condition precedent to recovery.



 

-44- (b) _Limitations on the Seller s Liability_. Notwithstanding anything
contained in _Section 9.2(a)_,

(i) the Seller shall have no obligation to make indemnification payments
under  _Section 9.2(a)_ except to the extent that the aggregate amount of
Damages incurred by the Purchaser, its Affiliates and Representatives exceeds
Five Hundred Thousand Dollars ($500,000) (the " _Threshold Amount_ "); 
_provided_ that, the Threshold Amount shall not apply to any indemnification
obligation under _Section 9.2(a)(iii)_ or as contemplated under _Section
9.2(b)(iv)_ of this Agreement.

(ii) except with respect to (A) intentional or willful misrepresentation or

consequential damages, special damages, incidental damages, indirect damages,

In determining the foregoing thresholds and in otherwise determining the
amount of any Damages for which the Purchaser is entitled to assert a claim

deducting therefrom the amount of any insurance proceeds or other third
party recoveries received by the Purchaser in respect of such Damages.

hold harmless Seller and its respective Representatives from and against any
and all Damages incurred in connection with, arising out of, resulting from or

qualifications as to materiality contained in such representations), made by
the Purchaser in this Agreement, (ii) any breach of any covenant or agreement
made by the Purchaser in this Agreement; or (iii) any Taxes of the Company
with respect to any Tax period beginning after the Closing Date or for any Tax
period beginning before and ending after the Closing Date to the
extent allocable (as determining in accordance with _Section 6.10(h)_
hereof) to the portion of such period after the Closing Date.



 

-45- (d) _Indemnification by the Company_. The Company shall indemnify, defend and
hold harmless the officers and directors of the Company those acts or
omissions for which indemnification pursuant to the applicable Articles of
Incorporation or Bylaws or applicable Law would be available but for their
resignation from the Company. Seller shall not be entitled to indemnification
under this _Section 9.2(d)_ for any Claim which would constitute a breach of
any representations or warranties by Seller or the Company in this Agreement
or for which the Seller would be obligated to indemnify Purchaser, without
reference to any time period or dollar amount limitation set forth in this
Agreement with respect to such representation and warranty or indemnification
obligation.

(e) _Indemnification Procedures_. Upon the occurrence of any event which may
give rise to Damages for which the indemnifying Person or Persons (each, an "
_Indemnitor_ " and, collectively, the " _Indemnitors_ ") is or may be liable
under this Section 9.2 (any such event, a " _Claim_ "), the Person or Persons
being indemnified (each, an " _Indemnitee_ " and, collectively, the "
_Indemnitees_ ") shall promptly notify the Indemnitors in writing specifying
the nature of the Claim and give the Indemnitors a reasonable opportunity to
attempt to defend or settle such Claim, including to employ counsel
reasonably satisfactory to the Indemnitees and its counsel to defend or settle
any such Claim, _provided_ that the Indemnitors shall not settle any Claim,
except with respect to monetary damage awards (for which the Indemnitee has
received, as an unconditional term of such settlement, an unconditional
release by claimant or plaintiff from all liability in connection with the
Claim), without the Indemnitees prior written consent, which consent shall
not be unreasonably withheld. Any Indemnitee may, at its election and expense,
participate in any attempt by the Indemnitors to settle or defend any such
Claim. An Indemnitor may elect to defend or settle a Claim while reserving
its right to contribution from the Indemnitee (by giving notice to the
Indemnitee of its reservation of rights); _provided, however,_ that the
Indemnitor shall have no right, without the Indemnitees consent, to settle
any such Claim. With respect to any Claim which is ultimately determined to
be an obligation for which the Indemnitors are obligated to indemnify the
Indemnitees, in the event that the Indemnitors fail to defend the Indemnitees
or to employ counsel for the Indemnitees for such purpose, then the
Indemnitee may defend against such Claim in such manner as it may deem
appropriate and the Indemnitee may settle such Claim on such terms as it may
deem appropriate. The Indemnitor shall promptly reimburse the Indemnitee for
the amount of all settlement payments and expenses, legal and otherwise,
incurred by the Indemnitee in connection with the defense or settlement of
such Claim. If no settlement of such Claim is made, then the Indemnitor shall
satisfy any judgment rendered with respect to such Claim before the
Indemnitee is required to do so, and pay all expenses, legal or otherwise,
incurred by the Indemnitee in the defense against such Claim. Except as set
forth above, the Indemnitee shall not have the right to settle any Claim
without the approval of the Indemnitor, _provided_ that if the Indemnitor
disapproves such settlement, then it must assume the defense of such Claim and
reimburse the Indemnitee for all expenses of the Indemnitee to the date of
assumption. The failure of the Indemnitor to assume such defense and to pay
such reimbursement shall give the Indemnitee the right to settle such Claim.

(f) Every expense of any attempt to settle or defend a Claim, including
without limitation expenses for proceedings, negotiations, investigations,
settlements or suits, shall be borne solely by the Indemnitors.
Notwithstanding any such attempt or the outcome  



 

-46-  thereof, the obligations of the Indemnitors to the Indemnitees under this
_Section 9.2_ shall not be relieved, reduced or otherwise affected. 

(g) After the Closing, the Company shall not have any liability to indemnify
the Purchaser or the Seller on account of the breach of any representation or
warranty or the nonfulfillment of any covenant or agreement of the Seller or
the Company, and Seller shall not have any right of contribution against the
Company.

9.3 _Further Assurances; Books and Records_.

(a) From time to time, without further consideration, the Seller will, at the
expense of the Purchaser, execute and deliver such documents to the Purchaser
as the Purchaser may reasonably request in order more effectively to
consummate the transactions contemplated hereby. From time to time, without
further consideration, the Purchaser will, at the expense of the Seller,
execute and deliver such documents as the Sellers may reasonably request in
order more effectively to consummate the transactions contemplated hereby. In
case at any time after the Closing any further action is necessary or
desirable to carry out the purposes of this Agreement, each party to this
Agreement will take or cause its proper officers and directors to take all
such necessary action. If, in order to properly prepare either documents to be
filed with any Governmental Entity or its financial statements, it is
necessary that any party hereto be furnished with additional information
relating to the Company or the Business and such information is in possession
of any of the other parties hereto, such party or parties agree to use
its/their commercially reasonable efforts to furnish such information to

10.4 _Amendments and Waiver_. This Agreement may not be modified or amended
except in writing signed by the party or parties (as applicable) against whom
enforcement is sought. The terms of this Agreement may be waived only by
a written instrument signed by the parry or parties (as applicable) waiving

applicable) in exercising any right, power or privilege hereunder shall
operate as a waiver thereof, nor shall any single or partial exercise of any

provided, the rights and remedies herein provided are cumulative and are
not exclusive of any rights or remedies which the parties hereto may

incorporated by reference into and made a part of this Agreement for all
purposes.

agrees not to assert in any such dispute, to the fullest extent permitted by
applicable law, any claim that (i) such Party is not personally subject to
the jurisdiction of such courts, (ii) such party and such Partys property is
immune from any legal process issued by such courts, or (iii) any litigation
or other proceeding commenced in such courts is brought in an inconvenient
forum. The parties hereby agree that mailing of process or other papers in

-50-  Agreement and the rights and obligations affected hereby. The parties hereto
hereby agree that this Agreement shall be deemed to have been jointly
and equally drafted by them, and that the provisions of this Agreement
therefore should not be construed against any party or parties hereto on the

parts of a provision contained in this Agreement shall for any reason be held
to be invalid, illegal or unenforceable in any respect in any jurisdiction,
such invalidity, illegality or unenforceability shall not affect any other
provision or part of a provision of this Agreement or any other jurisdiction,
but this Agreement shall be reformed and construed in any such jurisdiction as
if such invalid or illegal or unenforceable provision or part of a provision
had never been contained herein and such provision or part shall be reformed
so that it would be valid, legal and enforceable to the maximum extent
permitted in such jurisdiction.
