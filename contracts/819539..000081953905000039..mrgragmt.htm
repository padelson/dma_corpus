At the Effective Time, Parent shall deposit (or cause to be deposited) with the Paying Agent sufficient funds to make all payments pursuant to Section 2.4(b).  Such funds may be invested by the Paying Agent as directed by Merger Sub or, after the Effective Time, the Surviving Corporation; <U>provided</U> that (i) no such investment or losses thereon shall affect the Merger Consideration payable to the holders of Company Common Stock and following any losses Parent shall promptly provide additional funds to the Paying Agent for the benefit of the stockholders of the Company in the amount of any such losses and (ii) such investments shall be in short-term obligations of the United States of America with maturities of no more than 30 days or guaranteed by the United States of America and backed by the full faith and credit of the United States of America or in commercial paper obligations rated A-1 or P-1 or better by Moody's Investors Service, Inc. or Standard &amp; Poor's Corporation, respectively.

Upon surrender to the Paying Agent of a Certificate or of Book-Entry Shares, together with such letter of transmittal, duly completed and validly executed in accordance with the instructions thereto, and such other documents as may be required pursuant to such instructions, the holder of such Certificate or Book-Entry Shares shall be entitled to receive in exchange therefor the Merger Consideration for each Share formerly represented by such Certificate or Book-Entry Shares and such Certificate or book-entry shall then be canceled.  No interest shall be paid or accrued for the benefit of holders of the Certificates or Book-Entry Shares on the Merger Consideration payable in respect of the Certificates or Book-Entry Shares.  If payment of the Merger Consideration is to be made to a person other than the person in whose name the surrendered Certificate is registered, it shall be a condition of payment that the Certificate so surrendered shall be properly endorsed or shall be otherwise in proper form for transfer and that the person requesting such payment shall have paid any transfer and other Taxes required by reason of the payment of the Merger Consideration to a person other than the registered holder of the Certificate surrendered or shall have established to the satisfaction of the Surviving Corporation that such Tax either has been paid or is not applicable.</A>  Until surrendered as contemplated by this Section 2.4(b), each Certificate and each Book-Entry Share shall be deemed at any time after the Effective Time to represent only the right to receive upon such surrender the applicable Merger Consideration as contemplated by this Article II.<BR>

The Surviving Corporation shall pay all charges and expenses, including those of the Paying Agent, in connection with the exchange of Shares for the Merger Consideration.</A>  Any Merger Consideration remaining unclaimed as of a date which is immediately prior to such time as such amounts would otherwise escheat to or become property of any Governmental Entity shall, to the extent permitted by applicable Law, become the property of Parent free and clear of any claims or interests of any person previously entitled thereto.  Neither the Surviving Corporation, Parent nor the Paying Agent will be liable to any person entitled to payment under this Article II for any consideration which is delivered to a public official pursuant to any abandoned property, escheat or similar Law.<BR>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(d)&nbsp;&nbsp;After the Effective Time, the stock transfer books of the Company shall be closed and thereafter there shall be no further registration of transfers of Shares that were outstanding prior to the Effective Time.  After the Effective Time, Certificates or Book-Entry Shares presented to the Surviving Corporation for transfer shall be canceled and exchanged for the consideration provided for, and in accordance with the procedures set forth in, this Article II.<BR>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(e)&nbsp;&nbsp;Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the contrary, Parent, the Surviving Corporation and the Paying Agent shall be entitled to deduct and withhold from the consideration otherwise payable to any former holder of Shares pursuant to this Agreement any amount as may be required to be deducted and withheld with respect to the making of such payment under applicable Tax (as defined below) Laws.  To the extent that amounts are so properly withheld by the Paying Agent, the Surviving Corporation or Parent, as the case may be, such withheld amounts shall be treated for all purposes of this Agreement as having been paid to the holder of the Shares in respect of which such deduction and withholding was made by the Paying Agent, the Surviving Corporation or Parent, as the case may be.<BR>
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(f)&nbsp;&nbsp;In the event that any Certificate shall have been lost, stolen or destroyed, upon the holder's compliance with the replacement requirements established by the Paying Agent, including, if necessary, the posting by the holder of a bond in customary amount as indemnity against any claim that may be made against it with respect to the Certificate, the Paying Agent will deliver in exchange for the lost, stolen or destroyed Certificate the applicable Merger Consideration payable in respect of the Shares represented by such Certificate pursuant to this Article II.<BR>
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(g)&nbsp;&nbsp;Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the contrary, if, between the date of this Agreement and the Effective Time, the issued and outstanding Shares shall have been changed into a different number of shares or a different class by reason of any stock split, reverse stock split, stock dividend, reclassification, redenomination, recapitalization, split-up, combination, exchange of shares or other similar transaction, the Merger Consideration and any other dependent items shall be appropriately adjusted to provide to the holders of the Shares the same economic effect as contemplated by this Agreement prior to such action and as so adjusted shall, from and after the date of such event, be the Merger Consideration or other dependent item, subject to further adjustment in accordance with this Section 2.4(g).</P>
