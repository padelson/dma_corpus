1.2 _Effective Time_. Parent, Merger Sub and the Company will cause
appropriate articles of merger (the " _Articles of Merger_ ") to be executed

the satisfaction or waiver (by the party entitled to grant such waiver) of
the conditions set forth in Article VII (other than those conditions that are
to be satisfied at the Closing, but subject to the fulfillment or waiver of
those conditions at the Closing) or (b) at such other place, time and date as
Parent and the Company may agree in writing (the " _Closing Date_ ").

ARTICLE II

SURVIVING CORPORATION

2.1 _Articles of Incorporation_. The articles of incorporation of the Company
shall, by virtue of the Merger, be amended and restated in its entirety to
read as the articles of incorporation of Merger Sub in effect immediately
prior to the Effective Time, except that Article I thereof shall read as

shall be the articles of incorporation of the Surviving Corporation until
thereafter amended as permitted by Law.

2.2 _Bylaws_. The bylaws of the Surviving Corporation, as in effect
immediately prior to the Effective Time, shall be amended and restated in
their entirety to read as the bylaws of the Merger Sub in effect immediately
prior to the Effective Time until thereafter amended as permitted by Law.

with the Surviving Corporations articles of incorporation and bylaws.

2.4 _Officers_. The officers of the Company at the Effective Time shall, from

2 2.5 _Subsequent Actions_. If at any time after the Effective Time the
Surviving Corporation determines, in its sole discretion, or is advised, that
any deeds, bills of sale, assignments, assurances or any other actions or
things are necessary or desirable to vest, perfect or confirm of record or
otherwise in the Surviving Corporation its right, title or interest in, to or
under any of the rights, properties or assets of either of the Company, Parent
or Merger Sub acquired or to be acquired by the Surviving Corporation as a
result of, or in connection with, the Merger or otherwise to carry out this
Agreement, then the officers and directors of the Surviving Corporation shall
be authorized to execute and deliver, in the name and on behalf of either the
Company, Parent or Merger Sub, all such deeds, bills of sale, instruments of
conveyance, assignments and assurances and to take and do, in the name and on

ARTICLE III

EFFECT OF THE MERGER ON CAPITAL STOCK OF THE COMPANY

AND MERGER SUB

3.1  _Share Consideration for the Merger; Conversion or Cancellation of
Shares in the Merger_. At the Effective Time, by virtue of the Merger and
without any action on the part of the holders of any Shares or capital stock
of Merger Sub:

 

(a) Each share of common stock of the Company, par value $0.01 per share
(each, a " _Share_ " and, collectively, the " _Shares_ "), issued and
outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time (other than Shares owned
by Parent, Merger Sub, or any of their respective wholly owned Subsidiaries,
or any of the Companys direct or indirect wholly owned Subsidiaries or held
in the treasury of the Company) will, by virtue of the Merger and without any
action on the part of Merger Sub, the Company or the holder thereof, be
canceled and extinguished and converted into the right to receive, pursuant
to Section 3.2, in cash an amount per Share equal to $13.80 (the " _Merger
Consideration_ "), payable to the holder thereof, without interest thereon,
less any required withholding of Taxes, upon the surrender of the certificate
formerly representing such Share or the Book-Entry Shares (as defined in
Section 3.2(b)). At the Effective Time, all such Shares shall no longer be
outstanding and shall automatically be canceled and shall cease to exist, and
each holder of such Shares shall cease to have any rights with respect
thereto, except the right to receive the Merger Consideration as provided
herein.

(b) At the Effective Time, each Share issued and outstanding and owned by
Parent, Merger Sub or any of their respective wholly owned Subsidiaries, or
held in the treasury of the Company immediately prior to the Effective Time
will cease to be outstanding (if applicable), be canceled and retired without
payment of any consideration therefor and cease to exist.

(c) At the Effective Time, all Shares (if any) held by any of the Companys
direct or indirect wholly owned Subsidiaries shall remain outstanding and
shall become that number of shares of common stock of the Surviving
Corporation that bears the same ratio to the aggregate number of outstanding
shares of common stock of the Surviving 



 

3  Corporation as the number of Shares held by such subsidiary bore to the
aggregate number of Shares immediately prior to the Effective Time.

(d) At the Effective Time, each share of common stock, $0.01 par value, of
Merger Sub issued and outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time
shall, by virtue of the Merger and without any action on the part of the
holder thereof, be converted into and become one validly issued, fully paid
and nonassessable share of common stock of the Surviving Corporation.

3.2 _Payment for Shares in the Merger_. The manner of making payment for
Shares in the Merger shall be as follows:

(a) At or immediately after the Effective Time, Parent shall deliver to a
paying agent selected by Parent and reasonably acceptable to the Company (the
" _Paying Agent_ "), for the benefit of the holders of Shares, the funds
necessary to make the payments contemplated by Section 3.1 (the " _Payment
Fund_ "). Parent shall cause the Paying Agent, pursuant to irrevocable
instructions, to deliver the Merger Consideration out of the Payment Fund. The
Payment Fund shall not be used for any other purpose.

(b) As soon as reasonably practicable after the Effective Time, Parent shall
cause the Paying Agent to mail (i) to each holder of record (other than
holders of certificates for Shares referred to in Section 3.1(b)) of a
certificate or certificates that immediately prior to the Effective Time
represented outstanding Shares (the " _Certificates_ "): (A) a form of letter
of transmittal (which shall specify that delivery shall be effected, and risk
of loss and title to the Certificates shall pass, only upon proper delivery of
the Certificates to the Paying Agent); and (B) instructions for use in
effecting the surrender of the Certificates for payment therefor, and (ii) to
each holder of Book-Entry Shares instructions for use in effecting the
surrender of non-certificated Shares held in book-entry form (" _Book-Entry
Shares_ ") in exchange for the Merger Consideration. Upon surrender of
Certificates for cancellation to the Paying Agent, together with such letter
of transmittal duly executed and any other required documents, or surrender of
Book-Entry Shares, the holder of such Certificates or Book-Entry Shares will
be entitled to receive for each of the Shares formerly represented by such
Certificates or Book-Entry Shares, the Merger Consideration, without any
interest thereon, less any required withholding of Taxes, and the Certificates
or Book-Entry Shares so surrendered shall forthwith be canceled. If payment
is to be made to a Person other than the Person in whose name a Certificate so
surrendered is registered, it will be a condition of payment that the
Certificate so surrendered must be properly endorsed and otherwise in proper
form for transfer and that the Person requesting such payment must pay to the
Paying Agent any transfer or other Taxes required by reason of the payment to
a Person other than the registered holder of the Certificate surrendered, or
must establish to the satisfaction of the Paying Agent that such Tax has been
paid or is not applicable. Until surrendered in accordance with the provisions
of this Section 3.2(b), each Certificate (other than Certificates
formerly representing Shares held in the Companys treasury or by Merger Sub,
or by any Subsidiary of the Company or Merger Sub) and Book-Entry Share will
represent for all purposes only the right to receive, for each Share formerly
represented thereby, the Merger Consideration, without interest thereon, less
any required withholding of Taxes.



 

4 (c) If any Certificate shall have been lost, stolen or destroyed, upon the
making of an affidavit of that fact by the Person claiming such Certificate
to be lost, stolen or destroyed and, if required by the Surviving Corporation
or the Paying Agent, the posting by such Person of a bond in such reasonable
amount as the Surviving Corporation or the Paying Agent may direct as
indemnity against any claim that may be made against it with respect to such
Certificate, the Paying Agent will deliver in exchange for such lost, stolen
or destroyed Certificate the Merger Consideration with respect to the Shares
formerly represented thereby.

(d) Any portion of the Payment Fund made available to the Paying Agent that
remains unclaimed by the former shareholders of the Company for one year after
the Effective Time may be delivered to Parent, upon demand of Parent, and any
former shareholders of the Company may thereafter look only to Parent (subject
to abandoned property, escheat or other similar Laws) for payment of their
claim for the Merger Consideration, without any interest thereon. Neither
Parent nor the Surviving Corporation shall be liable to any holder of Shares
for any monies delivered from the Payment Fund or otherwise to a public
official pursuant to any applicable abandoned property, escheat or similar
Law. If any Shares shall not have been surrendered prior to such date as shall
be immediately prior to the date that such unclaimed funds would otherwise
become subject to any abandoned property, escheat or similar Law, any
unclaimed funds payable with respect to such Shares shall, to the extent
permitted by applicable Law, become the property of the
Surviving Corporation, free and clear of all claims or interest of any Person
previously entitled thereto.

3.3 _Transfer of Shares After the Effective Time_. The Company shall not
permit transfers of Shares to be made on the stock transfer books of the
Company after the close of business on the day prior to the date of the
Effective Time. If, after the Effective Time, Certificates are presented to
the Surviving Corporation for transfer, they shall be canceled and exchanged
for the Merger Consideration as provided in this Article III.

3.4 _Stock Options; Employee Stock Purchase Plan; Restricted Shares_.

(a) Prior to the Effective Time, the Board (or, if appropriate, any committee
thereof) shall adopt appropriate resolutions and take all other actions
necessary and appropriate to provide that, immediately prior to the Effective
Time, each option then outstanding to purchase Shares (the " _Options_ ")
granted under the Companys 2004 Equity Incentive Plan (and its predecessor
plans), 2004 Non-Employee Director Equity Incentive Plan (and its predecessor
plans), 2008 Non-Executive Stock Plan, or any other plan, agreement or
arrangement (together, the " _Option Plans_ "), will be canceled and, in
exchange therefor, each former holder of any such canceled Option shall be
entitled to receive, in consideration of the cancellation of such Option and
in settlement therefor, a payment by the Company in cash of an amount equal to
the product of (i) the total number of Shares previously subject to such
Option and (ii) the excess, if any, of the Merger Consideration over the
exercise price per Share previously subject to such Option (such amounts
payable hereunder being referred to as the " _Option Payment_ "). From and
after the Effective Time, any such canceled Option shall no longer be
exercisable by the former holder thereof, but shall only entitle such holder
to the payment of the Option Payment, and the Company will use its reasonable
best efforts to obtain all necessary consents to ensure that former holders
of Options will have no rights other than the right to receive the Option
Payment.



 

5 (b) Prior to the Effective Time, Parent and the Company shall take action
designed to provide that the treatment of Options pursuant to Section 3.4(a)
will qualify for exemption under Rule 16b-3(d) or (e), as applicable, under
the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the " _Exchange Act_ ").

 

(c) The Company shall take such action as may be necessary to: (i) establish
the end of the purchase period in effect as of the date of this Agreement
under the Companys Employee Stock Purchase Plan (the " _ESPP_ ") no later
than the last day of the offering period ending immediately after the date
hereof with respect to any offering otherwise then in effect (the " _ESPP
Exercise Date_ "); and (ii) suspend any subsequent purchase periods that would
otherwise arise after the close of the purchase period currently in effect and
prior to the Effective Time. The Company shall exercise reasonable best
efforts to terminate the ESPP as of the Effective Time or such earlier date as
determined by the Company to be administratively reasonable. In such event,
(A) each ESPP participants accumulated payroll contributions as of the ESPP
Exercise Date that are not withdrawn as of such date shall be applied toward
the purchase of Shares in accordance with the terms of the ESPP; and (B) as
promptly as reasonably practicable following the ESPP Exercise Date,
following the application of accumulated payroll contributions toward the
purchase of Shares in accordance with the preceding sentence, Parent shall
cause or permit the Company or Merger Sub, as applicable, to return to
participants any of their respective accumulated payroll contributions not
applied to the purchase of Shares under the ESPP, if any.

(d) Each Share granted subject to vesting or other lapse restrictions
pursuant to any Option Plan (collectively, " _Restricted Shares_ ") which is
outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time and which by its terms as
in effect on the date hereof would vest and become free of such restrictions
as of the Effective Time (such Restricted Shares, " _Vested Restricted Shares_
") shall, subject to this Article III, be entitled to receive the Merger
Consideration with respect to each such Vested Restricted Share, less any
required withholding Taxes. Each Share granted subject to vesting or other
lapse restrictions pursuant to any Option Plan which is outstanding
immediately prior to the Effective Time and which would not by its terms as
in effect on the date hereof vest and become free of such restrictions (such
Restricted Shares, " _Unvested Restricted Shares_ ") shall be canceled
immediately prior to the Closing and shall be replaced with a substantially
equivalent award by Parent, the Surviving Corporation or any of their
respective Subsidiaries or affiliates which, subject to the holders continued
employment with Parent, the Surviving Corporation or their
respective Subsidiaries or affiliates, shall continue to vest on the same
schedule and in accordance with the same terms as set forth in the applicable
Option Plan and the applicable award agreement thereunder.

(e) After the Effective Time, all Option Plans shall be terminated and no
further Options, Restricted Shares or other rights with respect to Shares
shall be granted thereunder.

3.5 _Withholding Taxes_. Parent, the Surviving Corporation and the Paying
Agent shall be entitled to deduct and withhold from the consideration
otherwise payable to a holder of Shares, Restricted Shares or Options pursuant
to the Merger or this Agreement any stock transfer Taxes and such amounts as
are required to be withheld under the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as
amended (the " _Code_ "), or any applicable provision of state, local or
foreign 



 

6  Tax Law. To the extent that amounts are so withheld, such withheld amounts
shall be treated for all purposes of this Agreement as having been paid to the
holder of the Shares, Restricted Shares or Options in respect of which such
deduction and withholding was made.

3.6 _Recapitalizations; Stock Splits_. Notwithstanding anything in this
Agreement to the contrary, if, between the date of this Agreement and the
Effective Time, there shall have been declared, made or paid any dividend or
distribution on the Shares or the issued and outstanding Shares shall have
been changed into a different number of Shares or a different class by reason
of any stock split, reverse stock split, stock dividend, reclassification,
redenomination, recapitalization, split-up, combination, exchange of shares or
other similar transaction, the Merger Consideration and any other dependent
items shall be appropriately adjusted to provide to the holders of the Shares
and Options the same economic effect as contemplated by this Agreement prior
to such action and as so adjusted shall, from and after the date of such
event, be the Merger Consideration or other dependent item, subject to further
adjustment in accordance with this Section 3.6; _provided_ that nothing herein
shall be construed to permit (a) the Company to take any action with respect
to its securities that is prohibited or not expressly permitted by the terms
of this Agreement, or (b) Parent and Merger Sub to pay other than cash in
fulfillment of their obligation to pay the Merger Consideration.

jurisdiction of organization, and is duly qualified to do business and in
good standing in each jurisdiction where the properties owned, leased or

and deliver this Agreement and to consummate the transactions contemplated by

accordance with Section 607.1103 of the FBCA by the Requisite Shareholder Vote
(as defined in Section 4.16) prior to the consummation of the Merger). This
Agreement has been duly and validly executed and delivered by the Company

applicable to the execution, delivery or performance of this Agreement, the
consummation of the Merger, or the other transactions contemplated by this
Agreement.

4.5 _Consents and Approvals; No Violation_. Neither the execution
and delivery of this Agreement nor the consummation by the Company of the

articles of incorporation, bylaws or the comparable governing documents of the
Company or any of its Significant Subsidiaries;

(b) require any consent, approval, authorization or permit of, or filing with
or notification to, any foreign, federal, state or local government, or

encumbrance) under any of the terms, conditions or provisions of any note,
license, agreement or other instrument or obligation to which the Company or
any of its Subsidiaries or any of their assets may be bound, except for such
violations, breaches and defaults (or rights of termination, cancellation or
acceleration or Lien or other charge or encumbrance) as to which requisite
waivers or consents have been obtained or that, individually or in the
aggregate, have not had and would not reasonably be expected to
have, individually or in the aggregate, a Material Adverse Effect; or



 

10 (d) assuming the consents, approvals, authorizations or permits and filings
or notifications referred to in this Section 4.5 are duly and timely obtained
or made, and, with respect to the Merger, the approval of this Agreement by
the Companys shareholders has been obtained, violate any Law applicable to
the Company or any of its Subsidiaries or to any of their respective assets,
except for violations that have not had and would not reasonably be expected
to have, individually or in the aggregate, a Material Adverse Effect.

4.6 _SEC Reports; Financial Statements_.

(a) The Company has timely filed or furnished all forms, reports, statements,
certifications and other documents required to be filed or furnished by it
with or to SEC since December 31, 2005 (the " _Company SEC Reports_ ") , all
of which have complied, as to form, as of their respective filing dates in all
material respects with all applicable requirements of the Securities Act of
1933, as amended (the " _Securities Act_ "), the Exchange Act and the
Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 (the " _Sarbanes-Oxley Act_ ") and, in each case,
the rules and regulations of the SEC promulgated thereunder. None of the
Company SEC Reports, including any financial statements or schedules included
or incorporated by reference therein, at the time filed or furnished,
contained any untrue statement of a material fact or omitted to state a
material fact required to be stated therein or necessary in order to make the
statements therein, in light of the circumstances under which they were made,
not misleading. To the knowledge of the Company, none of the Company SEC
Reports is the subject of ongoing SEC review or outstanding SEC comment. None
of the Companys Subsidiaries is required to file periodic reports with the
SEC pursuant to the Exchange Act or with any other Governmental Entity under
securities Laws of any jurisdiction.

(b) The consolidated financial statements (including the related notes
thereto) of the Company and its Subsidiaries included (or incorporated by

in accordance with United States generally accepted accounting principles ("
_GAAP_ ") applied on a basis consistent with prior periods (except as
otherwise noted therein), and present fairly, in all material respects, the
consolidated financial position of the Company and its consolidated
Subsidiaries as of their respective dates, and the consolidated income,
shareholders equity, results of operations and changes in consolidated
financial position or cash flows for the periods presented therein (subject,
in the case of unaudited interim financial statements, to normal year-end
audit adjustments that are not material in amount or nature). All of the
Companys Subsidiaries are consolidated for accounting purposes. 

(c) The Company and its Subsidiaries have implemented and maintain a system of
internal accounting controls sufficient to provide reasonable assurances
regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of
financial statements in accordance with GAAP. The Company (i) has implemented
and maintains disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Rule
13a-15(e) of the Exchange Act) to ensure that material information relating to
the Company, including its consolidated Subsidiaries, is made known to the
Chief Executive Officer and the Chief Financial Officer of the Company by
others within those entities, and (ii) has disclosed, based on its most
recent evaluation prior to the date of this Agreement, to the Companys
outside auditors and the audit committee of the Board (A) any significant 



 

11  deficiencies and material weaknesses in the design or operation of internal
control over financial reporting (as defined in Rule 13a-15(f) of the Exchange
Act) that would be reasonably likely to adversely affect the Companys
ability to record, process, summarize and report financial information and (B)
any fraud, whether or not material, that involves management or other
employees who have a significant role in the Companys internal control over
financial reporting. A summary of any such disclosures made by management to
the Companys auditors and audit committee has been previously provided to
Parent, and such summary is true, correct and complete in all
material respects.

(d) The books and records of the Company and each of its Subsidiaries have
been, and are being, fully, properly and accurately maintained in accordance
with GAAP (to the extent applicable) and any other applicable legal and
accounting requirements and reflect only actual transactions, in each case
except as would not reasonably be expected to result in a Material Adverse
Effect.

(e) Neither the Company nor any of its Subsidiaries has any liabilities of any
nature, whether accrued, absolute, fixed, contingent or otherwise, of the
type required to be recorded or reflected on a balance sheet under GAAP,
except for those liabilities (i) reserved for on the most recent consolidated
balance sheet of the Company included in the Company SEC Reports filed prior
to the date of this Agreement; (ii) incurred in the ordinary course of
business after the date of this Agreement; (iii) incurred in connection with
the transactions contemplated hereby; or (iv) incurred as expressly permitted
by this Agreement or with the written permission of Parent; or (v) as would

Material Adverse Effect.

4.7 _Absence of Certain Changes or Events_.

(a) Since December 31, 2008, the Company and its Subsidiaries have not
suffered any Material Adverse Effect, and there has not been any event,
change, effect, development, condition or occurrence that would be reasonably
expected to result in, individually or in the aggregate, a Material Adverse
Effect.

(b) Since December 31, 2008, the Company and its Subsidiaries have conducted
their respective businesses only in the ordinary course and consistent with
past practice, in all material respects and, except as set forth in Section
4.7(b) of the Disclosure Schedule, neither the Company nor any of its
Subsidiaries has taken any action that, if taken after the date of this
Agreement without the prior written consent of Parent, would constitute a
breach of clauses (i), (ii), (iii), (iv), (v), (vi)(A), (xii) or (xvii) of
Section 6.1(a).

4.8 _Litigation_. As of the date of this Agreement, except as disclosed in
the Company SEC Reports, there is no claim, action, suit, proceeding,
arbitration, mediation or governmental investigation pending or, to the
knowledge of the Company, threatened by or against or relating to the Company
or any of its Subsidiaries or any properties or assets of the Company or any
Subsidiaries of the Company, other than any such claim, action, suit,
proceeding, arbitration, mediation or governmental investigation that (i) does
not individually involve an amount in controversy reasonably anticipated to
exceed $1,000,000 and (ii) does not seek material injunctive relief. Neither
the Company nor any of its Subsidiaries nor any of their

injunction or decree, except where such order, writ, injunction or decree has
not had and would not reasonably be expected to result in a Material Adverse
Effect. To the knowledge of the Company, no officer or director of the Company
or its Subsidiaries is a defendant in any claim, action, suit, proceeding,
arbitration, mediation or governmental investigation in connection with his
or her status as an officer or director of the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries. There are no legal actions, audits, inquiries or investigations
or material internal investigations of the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries, pending or, to the knowledge of the Company, threatened by the
SEC or any other Governmental Entity.

Returns and all other material Tax Returns required to be filed by any of
them (taking into account applicable extensions), all of which Tax Returns are
true, correct and complete in all material respects; and (ii) paid or accrued
(in accordance with GAAP) all material Taxes for which the Company and its
Subsidiaries are liable, whether or not shown to be due on such Tax Returns,
other than such Taxes as are being contested in good faith or for which
adequate reserves have been established on the Companys books and records.
The Company and each of its Subsidiaries have withheld from payments to their
employees, independent contractors, creditors, shareholders and any other
applicable Person (and timely paid to the appropriate Governmental Entity or

local and foreign Laws (including income, social security, and employment Tax
withholding for all types of compensation).

(b) There are no ongoing federal, state, local or foreign audits,
examinations, claims or assessments relating to material Taxes of the Company
or any of its Subsidiaries. Neither the Company nor any of its Subsidiaries

such entity does not file a Tax Return stating that such entity is or may be
subject to Tax that would be the subject of such Tax Return by that
jurisdiction.

(c) There are no outstanding written requests, agreements, consents or
waivers to extend the statutory period of limitations applicable to the
assessment of any Taxes of the Company and its Subsidiaries.

(d) The Company and its Subsidiaries are not a party to any Tax indemnity

that could give rise to a material payment or indemnification obligation.

(e) There are no material Liens for Taxes upon the assets of the Company or
its Subsidiaries that are not provided for in the Company SEC Reports, except
Liens for Taxes not yet due and payable.

(f) Neither the Company nor any of its Subsidiaries (i) has been a member of
an affiliated group filing a consolidated federal income Tax return (other

13  the common parent of which was the Company) or (ii) has any liability for
the Taxes of any Person (other than the Company or any subsidiary of the
Company) under Treasury Regulations Section 1.1502-6 (or any similar
provision of state, local or foreign law), as a transferee, successor, by

(g) None of the Company, any of its Subsidiaries, any of their affiliates nor
any of their predecessors by merger or consolidation has within the past two

beneficiary of such present or former employee, manager, director or
consultant) of the Company or any Subsidiary, whether or not such plan is
terminated, maintained or contributed to by the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries (the " _Company Plans_ "), except as would not in the aggregate
have a Material Adverse Effect: (i) each Company Plan intended to be qualified
under Section 401(a) of the Code has received a favorable determination letter
from the Internal Revenue Service (the " _IRS_ ") that it is so qualified
and, to the knowledge of the Company, nothing has occurred since the date of
such letter that is reasonably likely to affect the qualified status of such
Company Plan; and (ii) each Company Plan has been operated in all respects in
accordance with its terms and the requirements of applicable law. Except as
would not, together with any liabilities described in Sections 4.10(a)(i) and
(ii), have a Material Adverse Effect, none of the Company, any of its
Subsidiaries or any ERISA Affiliate (as defined below) has incurred any direct
or indirect liability under, arising out of or by operation of Title IV of the
Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974, as amended (" _ERISA_ ")
and, to the knowledge of the Company, no fact or event exists that is
reasonably likely to give rise to any such liability to the Company or any of
its Subsidiaries. For purposes of this Agreement, " _ERISA Affiliate_ " means
any trade or business (whether or not incorporated) which is a member of a
controlled group or which is under common control with the Company or any
Subsidiary within the meaning of Section 414 of the Code.

(a) Subject to Section 6.2(b), from the date of this Agreement until the

in accordance with Article VIII, the Company and its Subsidiaries shall not,
and shall cause their Representatives who are employees or officers of the
Company or any of its Subsidiaries not to, and shall use their commercially
reasonable efforts to cause their Representatives who are not employees or
officers of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries not to, directly or
indirectly: (i) initiate, solicit or knowingly encourage (including by way of
providing information) the submission of any inquiries, proposals or offers
or any other efforts or attempts that constitute, or may reasonably be
expected to lead to, any Acquisition Proposal or engage in any conversations,
discussions or negotiations with respect thereto or otherwise, in any way,
cooperate with or assist or participate in or facilitate any such inquiries,
proposals, offers, discussions or negotiations or other efforts or (ii)
approve or recommend, or publicly propose to approve or recommend, an
Acquisition Proposal or enter into any merger agreement, letter of intent,
agreement in principle, share purchase agreement, asset purchase agreement,
share exchange agreement, option agreement or other similar agreement relating
to an Acquisition Proposal or enter into any agreement or agreement in
principle requiring the Company to abandon, terminate or fail to consummate
the transactions contemplated hereby or breach its obligations hereunder or
resolve, propose or agree 



 

28  to do any of the foregoing. Subject to Section 6.2(b), the Company shall
immediately cease and cause to be terminated any solicitation, discussion,
negotiation or knowing encouragement with any Persons conducted theretofore
by the Company, its Subsidiaries or any of its or their Representatives with
respect to any Acquisition Proposal and cause to be returned or destroyed all
confidential information provided by or on behalf of the Company or any of
its Subsidiaries to such Persons.

(b) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in Section 6.2(a), if
at any time following the date of this Agreement and prior to obtaining the
Requisite Shareholder Vote, (i) the Company has received a written Acquisition
Proposal from a third party that the Board believes in good faith to be bona
fide, (ii) the Company has not materially breached Section 6.2(a), (iii) the
Board determines in good faith, after consultation with its financial advisors
and outside counsel, that such Acquisition Proposal constitutes or is
reasonably likely to result in a Superior Proposal and (iv) after
consultation with its outside counsel, the Board determines in good faith that
such action is necessary to comply with its fiduciary duties to the
shareholders of the Company under applicable Law, then the Company may (A)
furnish information with respect to the Company and its Subsidiaries to the
Person making such Acquisition Proposal and (B) participate in discussions or
negotiations with the Person making such Acquisition Proposal regarding such
Acquisition Proposal; _provided_ that the Company (x) will not, and will not
allow its Subsidiaries and its and their Representatives to, disclose any non-
public information to such Person without first entering into a
confidentiality agreement in all material respects no less favorable to the
Company than the Confidentiality Agreement (other than Section 14 of the
Confidentiality Agreement) and (y) will promptly provide to Parent any non-
public information concerning the Company or its Subsidiaries provided to
such other Person which was not previously provided to Parent.

(c) From and after the date hereof, the Company shall promptly (and in any
event within one Business Day) notify Parent in the event that the Company,
its Subsidiaries or its or their Representatives receives (i) any
Acquisition Proposal or indication by any Person that it is considering
making an Acquisition Proposal, (ii) any request for non-public information
relating to the Company or any of its Subsidiaries other than requests for
information in the ordinary course of business and unrelated to an
Acquisition Proposal or (iii) any inquiry or request for discussions or
negotiations regarding any Acquisition Proposal. The Company shall notify
Parent promptly (and in any event within one Business Day) with the identity
of such Person and a copy of such Acquisition Proposal, indication, inquiry or
request (or, where no such copy is available, a description of such
Acquisition Proposal, indication, inquiry or request), including any
modifications thereto. The Company shall keep Parent reasonably informed
(orally and in writing) on a current basis (and in any event no later than one
Business Day after the occurrence of any changes, developments, discussions or
negotiations) of the status of any Acquisition Proposal, indication, inquiry
or request (including the material terms and conditions thereof and of any
modification thereto), and any material developments, discussions and
negotiations, including furnishing copies of any written inquiries,
correspondence and draft documentation, and written summaries of any material
oral inquiries or discussions. Without limiting the foregoing, the Company
shall promptly (and in any event within one Business Day) notify Parent orally
and in writing if it determines to begin providing information or to engage
in discussions or negotiations concerning an Acquisition Proposal pursuant to
Section 6.2(b). The Company shall not, and shall cause its Subsidiaries not
to, enter 



 

29  into any confidentiality agreement with any Person subsequent to the date of
this Agreement, and neither the Company nor any of its Subsidiaries is party
to any agreement, that prohibits the Company from providing such information
to Parent. The Company shall not, and shall cause each of its Subsidiaries not
to, terminate, waive, amend or modify any provision of, or grant permission
under, any standstill or confidentiality agreement to which it or any of its
Subsidiaries is a party, and the Company shall, and shall cause its
Subsidiaries to, enforce the provisions of any such agreement.

(d) Notwithstanding anything in Section 6.2(a)(ii) to the contrary, if the
Company receives an Acquisition Proposal which the Board concludes in good
faith, after consultation with outside counsel and its financial advisors,
constitutes a Superior Proposal after giving effect to all of the adjustments
to the terms of this Agreement which may be offered by Parent including
pursuant to clause (ii) below, the Board may at any time prior to obtaining
the Requisite Shareholder Vote, if it determines in good faith, after
consultation with outside counsel, that such action is necessary to comply
with its fiduciary duties to the shareholders of the Company under applicable
Law, (x) withdraw, modify or qualify, or propose publicly to withdraw, modify
or qualify, in a manner adverse to Parent or Merger Sub, the Company Board
Recommendation (a " _Change of Board Recommendation_ ") and/or (y)
terminate this Agreement in order to enter into a definitive agreement with
respect to such Superior Proposal; _provided_ , _however_ , that the Company
shall not terminate this Agreement pursuant to the foregoing clause (y), and
any purported termination pursuant to the foregoing clause (y) shall be void
and of no force or effect, unless in advance of or concurrently with such
termination the Company pays the Breakup Fee and otherwise complies with
Section 8.4(b) and 8.5(d); and  _provided_ _further_ that the Board may not
withdraw, modify or amend the Company Board Recommendation in a manner adverse
to Parent pursuant to the foregoing clause (x) or terminate this Agreement
pursuant to the foregoing clause (y) unless (A) the Company shall not have
breached this Section 6.2 and (B):

(1) the Company shall have provided prior written notice to Parent, at least
five (5) Business Days in advance (the " _Notice Period_ "), of its intention
to take such action with respect to such Superior Proposal, which notice shall
specify the material terms and conditions of any such Superior Proposal
(including the identity of the party making such Superior Proposal), and shall
have contemporaneously provided to Parent a copy of the relevant proposed
transaction agreements with the party making such Superior Proposal and other
material documents, including the definitive agreement with respect to such
Superior Proposal (the " _Alternative Acquisition Agreement_ "); and

(2) prior to effecting such Change of Board Recommendation or terminating this
Agreement to enter into a definitive agreement with respect to such Superior
Proposal, the Company shall, and shall cause its financial and legal advisors
to, during the Notice Period, negotiate with Parent in good faith (to the
extent Parent desires to negotiate) to make such adjustments in the terms and
conditions of this Agreement so that such Acquisition Proposal ceases to
constitute a Superior Proposal.

In the event of any material revisions to the Superior Proposal, the Company
shall be required to deliver a new written notice to Parent and to comply with
the requirements of this Section 6.2(d) with respect to such new written
notice. 



 

30 (e) The Company agrees that any violations of the restrictions set forth in
this Section 6.2 by any of its or its Subsidiaries Representatives shall be
deemed to be a breach of this Agreement (including this Section 6.2) by the
Company.

(f) Nothing contained in this Section 6.2 shall prohibit the Board from
disclosing to the shareholders of the Company a position contemplated by
Regulation 14A, Rule 14e-2(a) and Rule 14d-9 promulgated under the Exchange
Act or any other disclosure not related to an Acquisition Proposal to Company
shareholders if the Board determines after consultation with counsel that the
failure to make such disclosure would be reasonably likely to be inconsistent
with the directors fiduciary duties or disclosure obligations under
applicable law; _provided_ , _however_ , that any disclosure other than a
"stop, look and listen" or similar communication of the type contemplated by
Rule 14d-9(f) under the Exchange Act, an express rejection of any applicable
Acquisition Proposal or an express reaffirmation of its recommendation to its
shareholders in favor of the Merger shall be deemed to be a Change in
Board Recommendation (including for purposes of Section 8.3(b)(i)).

(g) The Company shall not take any action to exempt any Person (other than
Parent, Merger Sub and their respective affiliates) from the restrictions on
"control-share acquisitions" contained in Section 607.0902 of the FBCA (or any
similar provisions of any other Law) or otherwise cause such restrictions not
to apply unless such actions are taken simultaneously with a termination of
this Agreement pursuant to Section 8.4(b).

(h) For purposes of this Agreement, " _Acquisition Proposal_ " means any bona
fide written offer or proposal, or any indication of interest in making an
offer or proposal, made by a Person or group at any time which is structured
to permit such Person or group to acquire beneficial ownership of at least 20%
of the assets of, equity interest in, or businesses of, the Company and its
Subsidiaries pursuant to a merger, consolidation or other business
combination, sale of shares of capital stock, sale of assets, tender offer,
exchange offer or similar transaction, including any single or multi-step
transaction or series of related transactions, in each case other than the
Merger. 

(i) The term " _Superior Proposal_ " means any Acquisition Proposal (except
the references therein to "20%" shall be replaced by "100%") made in writing
that is not contingent upon or dependent upon any financing conditions, and
that the Board has determined in its good faith judgment (after consultation
with its financial advisor and outside counsel and after taking into account
(1) all legal, financial, regulatory and other aspects of the proposal,
including the financing terms thereof, (2) the likelihood and timing of
consummation (as compared to the transactions contemplated hereby) and (3)
any modifications made to this Agreement pursuant to Section 6.2(d)) is
superior from a financial point of view to this Agreement.

6.3 _Reasonable Best Efforts_.

(a) Subject to the terms and conditions of this Agreement, each of the parties
shall use all reasonable best efforts to take, or cause to be taken, all
action and to do, or cause to be done, all things necessary, proper or
advisable under applicable Laws and regulations to consummate and make
effective the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, including 



 

31  using its reasonable best efforts to obtain all necessary or appropriate
waivers, consents and approvals, to effect all necessary registrations,
filings and submissions (including: (i) filings under the HSR Act or any
comparable Law of non-United States jurisdictions and any other submissions
requested by the Federal Trade Commission or Department of Justice or any
comparable Governmental Entities of non-United States jurisdictions; (ii)
such other filings, consents, approvals, orders, registrations and
declarations as may be required under the Laws of any foreign country in which
the Company or any of its Subsidiaries conducts any business or owns
any assets; and (iii) all necessary waivers, consents and approvals from
other parties to material contracts to which the Company, Parent or Merger Sub
is a party), and to lift any injunction or other legal bar to the Merger (and,
in such case, to proceed with the Merger as expeditiously as possible) and
effect all necessary registrations and filings and submissions of information
requested by any Governmental Entities.

(b) Parent, Merger Sub and the Company shall use their respective reasonable
best efforts to promptly file or cause to be filed, (x) as soon as
practicable after the date hereof and in any event within 15 Business Days
from the date hereof, all required filings pursuant to the HSR Act with the
United States Federal Trade Commission and the Antitrust Division of
the United States Department of Justice and pursuant to Council Regulation
(EC) No. 139/2004, as amended with the European Commission and (y) as promptly
as practicable after the date hereof, all required filings under other
applicable antitrust, merger control or other similar Laws that the parties
reasonably determine in good faith to be necessary or appropriate to
consummate the transactions contemplated by this Agreement (the items set
forth in clauses (x) and (y) above, collectively, the " _Antitrust Filings_
"). The parties shall consult and cooperate with each other in the preparation
of such filings, and shall promptly inform each other of any material
communication received by such party from any Governmental Entity related to
the Antitrust Filings. Each party shall review and discuss in advance, and
consider in good faith the views of the other party in connection with, any
proposed written or material oral communication with any Governmental Entity
related to the Antitrust Filings. No party shall participate in any meeting
with any Governmental Entity unless it first consults with the other party in
advance, and to the extent permitted by the Governmental Entity, gives the
other party the opportunity to be present thereat. No party shall agree to any
voluntary extension of any statutory deadline or waiting period or to any
voluntary delay of the consummation of the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement at the behest of any Governmental Entity in connection with the
Antitrust Filings without the written consent of the other party (such consent
not to be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed).

(c) Without limiting this Section 6.3, Parent and Merger Sub shall take any
and all steps and undertake any and all undertakings necessary to avoid or
eliminate impediments under any antitrust, merger control, competition, or
trade regulation law that is or may be asserted by any Governmental Entity
with respect to the Merger so as to enable the Closing to occur as soon
as reasonably possible (and in any event, no later than the Termination
Date), including proposing, negotiating, committing to, and effecting by
consent decree, hold separate order, or otherwise, the sale, divestiture,
licensing or disposition of assets or businesses of Parent (or its
Subsidiaries) or the Company (or its Subsidiaries) or otherwise taking or
committing to take actions that limit Parents or its Subsidiaries freedom of
action with respect to, or their ability to retain, any of the businesses,
product lines or assets of Parent (or its Subsidiaries) or the Company (or its
Subsidiaries), in each case as may be required (i) to avoid 



 

32  the entry of, or to effect the dissolution of, any injunction, temporary
restraining order, or other order in any suit or proceeding, that would
otherwise have the effect of preventing or delaying the Closing; or (ii) as
is necessary to cause the conditions to the consummation of the Merger
provided for in Sections 7.1(b) or (c) to be satisfied in respect of
antitrust, merger control, competition, or trade regulation law (such action,
a " _Remedial Action_ "); _provided_ , however, that (as long as neither
Parent nor any of its affiliates makes any filing pursuant to the HSR Act with
the United States Federal Trade Commission and the Antitrust Division of the
United States Department of Justice and/or pursuant to Council Regulation (EC)
No. 139/2004, as amended, with the European Commission and/or is a party to a
relevant merger situation pursuant to section 23 of The Enterprise Act of
2002 in respect of an acquisition of a business that derives turnover (x) in
either the United States or the United Kingdom and (y) competes with any
material aspect of the business of the Company, that results in the
requirement of a Remedial Action) in no event shall Parent, Merger Sub, the
Company or any of their respective affiliates or subsidiaries take or be
obligated to take such Remedial Action pursuant to this Section 6.3(c) that,
assuming the taking of such Remedial Action and the subsequent consummation
of the Merger and the other transactions contemplated by this Agreement, would
reasonably be expected to have a Material Adverse Effect or a material adverse
effect on Parent and its affiliates (including the Surviving Corporation)
taken as a whole. For purposes of this Section 6.3(c), "material adverse
effect" has the same definition as Material Adverse Effect, substituting
Adecco and its affiliates (including the Surviving Corporation) for the
Company and its Subsidiaries.

(d) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement, in connection
with obtaining any approval or consent from any Person (other than a
Governmental Entity) with respect to the Merger, (i) without the prior written
consent of Parent (which shall not be unreasonably delayed, conditioned or
withheld), none of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries shall pay or commit
to pay to such Person whose approval or consent is being solicited any cash or
other consideration, make any commitment or incur any liability or other
obligation due to such Person and (ii) neither Parent nor Merger Sub shall be
required to pay or commit to pay to such Person whose approval or consent is
being solicited any cash or other consideration, make any commitment or incur
any liability or other obligation. 

6.4 _Access to Information_. Upon reasonable notice, the Company shall (and
shall cause each of its Subsidiaries to) afford to officers, employees,
counsel, accountants and other authorized representatives (collectively, "
_Representatives_ ") of Parent in order to evaluate the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement, reasonable access, during normal business
hours and upon reasonable notice throughout the period prior to the Effective
Time, to its properties, books and records (including Tax Returns and
supporting documentation) and Representatives and, during such period,
shall (and shall cause each of its Subsidiaries and Representatives to)
furnish promptly to Parents Representatives all information concerning its
business, properties and personnel as may reasonably be requested, except that
the Company may restrict the foregoing access and information to the extent
that: (i) applicable Laws require the Company or any of its Subsidiaries to
restrict or prohibit access to any such properties, books, records or
information; or (ii) the information is subject to confidentiality
obligations to a third party. Parent shall not, and shall cause its
Representatives not to, use any information obtained pursuant to this Section
6.4 for any competitive or other purpose unrelated to the consummation of the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement. The Confidentiality 



 

33  Agreement, dated September 27, 2007 (the " _Confidentiality Agreement_ "),
by and between the Company and Parent applies with respect to information
furnished by the Company, its Subsidiaries and the Companys officers,
employees, counsel, accountants and other authorized Representatives
hereunder.

6.5 _Shareholder Approval_. (a) As promptly as practicable following the date
of this Agreement, the Company shall call a meeting of its shareholders (the "
_Shareholders Meeting_ ") for the purpose of obtaining the Requisite
Shareholder Vote in connection with this Agreement and the Merger and shall
use its reasonable best efforts to cause such Shareholders Meeting to occur as
promptly as reasonably practicable. Except in the event of a Change of
Board Recommendation specifically permitted by Section 6.2(d), (i) the Proxy
Statement (as defined in Section 6.6) shall include the Company Board
Recommendation and (ii) the Board (and all applicable committees thereof)
shall use its reasonable best efforts to obtain from its shareholders the
Requisite Shareholder Vote in favor of the approval of the plan of merger (as
such term is used in Section 607.1103 of the FBCA) contained in this Agreement
required to consummate the transactions contemplated by this Agreement.

(b) If on the date for which the Shareholders Meeting is scheduled (the "
_Original Date_ "), the Company has not received proxies representing a
sufficient number of Shares to approve the transactions contemplated hereby,
whether or not a quorum is present, Parent shall have the right to require
the Company, and the Company shall have the right, to postpone or adjourn the
Shareholders Meeting to a date which shall not be more than 45 days after the
Original Date. If the Company continues not to receive proxies representing a
sufficient number of Shares to approve the transactions contemplated hereby,
whether or not a quorum is present, Parent shall have the right to require the
Company to, and the Company may, make one or more successive postponements or
adjournments of the Shareholders Meeting as long as the date of the
Shareholders Meeting is not postponed or adjourned more than an aggregate of
45 days from the Original Date in reliance on this subsection. In the event
that the Shareholders Meeting is adjourned or postponed as a result of
applicable Law, including the need to disseminate to shareholders any
amendments or supplements to the Proxy Statement, any days resulting from such
adjournment or postponement shall not be included for purposes of the
calculations of the number of days pursuant to this subsection.

6.6 _Proxy Statement; Other Filings_. As promptly as reasonably
practicable after the date of this Agreement, (a) the Company shall prepare
and file with the SEC, subject to the prior review and approval of Parent
(which approval shall not be unreasonably delayed, conditioned or withheld), a
letter to shareholders, notice of meeting, proxy statement and form of proxy
that will be provided to shareholders of the Company in connection with the
Merger (including any amendments or supplements) and any schedules required to
be filed with the SEC in connection therewith (collectively, the " _Proxy
Statement_ ") relating to the Merger; and (b) each of the Company and Parent
shall, or shall cause their respective affiliates to, prepare and file with
the SEC any other document to be filed with the SEC in connection with the
Merger (the " _Other Filings_ ") as required by the Exchange Act and the rules
and regulations promulgated thereunder. None of the information supplied or to
be supplied by the Company, on the one hand, or Parent and Merger Sub, on the
other hand, expressly for inclusion or incorporation by reference in the Proxy
Statement will, at the date it is first mailed to the Companys shareholders
or at the time of the Shareholders Meeting, contain any untrue statement of a
material fact or omit to state any 



 

34  material fact required to be stated therein or necessary in order to make
the statements therein, in light of the circumstances under which they are
made, not misleading. None of the information supplied or to be supplied by
the Company, on the one hand, or Parent and Merger Sub, on the other hand,
expressly for inclusion or incorporation by reference in each of the Other
Filings will, as of the date it is filed, contain any untrue statement of a
material fact or omit to state any material fact required to be stated therein
or necessary in order to make the statements therein, in light of the
circumstances under which they are made, not misleading. The Proxy Statement
and the Other Filings will comply as to form in all material respects with
the requirements of the Exchange Act. The Proxy Statement shall include a
statement that the Company has concluded that the shareholders are not
entitled to assert appraisal rights under the FBCA. The Company shall use its
reasonable best efforts to cause such Proxy Statement to be filed as soon as
possible, and in any event within 15 Business Days, after the date of this
Agreement. Each of the Company and Parent shall obtain and furnish the
information concerning itself and its affiliates required to be included in
the Proxy Statement and, to the extent applicable, the Other Filings. Each of
the Company and Parent shall use its reasonable best efforts to respond
as promptly as reasonably practicable to any comments received from the SEC
with respect to the Proxy Statement or the Other Filings, and the Company
shall cause the Proxy Statement to be mailed to the Companys shareholders at
the earliest reasonably practicable date. Each party shall promptly notify
the other party upon the receipt of any comments from the SEC or its staff or
any request from the SEC or its staff for amendments or supplements to the
Proxy Statement or the Other Filings and shall provide the other party with
copies of all correspondence between it, on the one hand, and the SEC and its
staff, on the other hand, relating to the Proxy Statement or the Other
Filings. If, at any time prior to the Shareholders Meeting, any information
relating to the Company, Parent, Merger Sub or any of their respective
affiliates, directors or officers should be discovered by the Company or
Parent, which should be set forth in an amendment or supplement to the
Proxy Statement or the Other Filings so that the Proxy Statement or the Other
Filings shall not contain any untrue statement of a material fact or omit to
state any material fact required to be stated therein or necessary in order to
make the statements therein, in light of the circumstances under which they
are made, not misleading, the party that discovers such information shall
promptly notify the other party, and an appropriate amendment or supplement
describing such information shall be filed with the SEC and, to the extent
required by applicable Law, disseminated to the shareholders of the Company.
Notwithstanding anything to the contrary stated above, prior to filing or
mailing the Proxy Statement or filing the Other Filings (or, in each case,
any amendment or supplement thereto) or responding to any comments of the SEC
or its staff with respect thereto, the party responsible for filing or mailing
such document shall provide the other party a reasonable opportunity to
review and comment on such document or response and shall include in such
document or response comments reasonably proposed by the other party.

6.7 _Publicity_. The parties shall consult with each other and shall agree
upon any press releases or public announcements pertaining to the Merger and
shall not issue any such press releases or make any such public announcements
prior to such consultation and agreement, except as may be required by
applicable Law or by obligations pursuant to any listing agreement with any
national securities or foreign exchange or trading market, in which case the
party proposing to issue such press release or make such public announcement
shall use its reasonable efforts to consult in good faith with the other party
before issuing any such press releases or making any such public
announcements. Subject to the exception set forth in the immediately 



 

35  preceding sentence, the Company, Parent and Merger Sub agree that the
initial press releases announcing the execution and delivery of this Agreement
shall not be issued prior to the approval of each of the Company and Parent.

6.8 _Indemnification of Directors and Officers_.

(a) From and after the Effective Time, Parent shall, and shall cause the
Surviving Corporation to, indemnify and hold harmless the individuals who at
any time prior to the Effective Time were directors or officers of the Company
or any of its present or former Subsidiaries (the " _Indemnified Parties_ ")
against any costs or expenses (including reasonable attorneys fees),
judgments, fines, losses, claims, damages or liabilities in connection with
actions or omissions occurring at or prior to the Effective Time (including
the transactions contemplated by this Agreement) to the fullest extent
permitted by Law, and Parent shall, and shall cause the Surviving Corporation
to, promptly advance expenses as incurred to the fullest extent permitted by
Law. Parent and Merger Sub agree that (i) all provisions with respect
to indemnification set forth in the certificate of incorporation and Bylaws
of the Company on the date of this Agreement with respect to matters occurring
prior to the Effective Time shall survive the Merger and shall continue in
full force and effect for a period of six years unless otherwise required by
Law; and (ii) any indemnification agreements between an Indemnified Party and
the Company in effect on the date of this Agreement and previously provided to
Parent or filed with the SEC shall continue in full force and effect in
accordance with their terms.

(b) The Company shall purchase by the Effective Time (in cooperation with and
with consultation from the Parent), and the Surviving Corporation shall
maintain, directors and officers liability insurance policies that: (i)
shall not have aggregate premiums in excess of 250% of the aggregate annual
amount currently paid by the Company to maintain the existing policies (which
amount has been disclosed to Parent); (ii) shall be effective for a period
from the Effective Time through and including the date six years after
the Closing Date with respect to claims arising from facts or events that
existed or occurred prior to or at the Effective Time; and (iii) shall contain
coverage with policy limits, terms and conditions that are at least as
favorable and at least as protective as such existing policies (complete and
accurate copies of which have been made available to Parent) to the Persons
covered thereby; _provided_ , _however_ , that, if equivalent coverage cannot
be obtained or can be obtained only by paying aggregate premiums in excess of
250% of such amount, the Company shall only be required to obtain (and the
Surviving Corporation shall only be required to maintain) as much coverage as
can be obtained by paying aggregate premiums equal to 250% of such amount.
Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Section 6.8(b), and in lieu
of any other obligations of the parties in this Section 6.8(b), prior to the
Effective Time, the Company may, in cooperation with, and with the consent of
Parent, not to be unreasonably withheld, purchase a single-premium tail policy
with respect to directors and officers liability insurance with policy
limits, terms and conditions that are at least as favorable and at least as
protective as such existing policies to the Persons covered thereby.

(c) This Section 6.8 is intended to benefit the Indemnified Parties, and
shall be binding on all successors and assigns of Parent, Merger Sub, the
Company and the Surviving Corporation. Parent guarantees the payment and
performance by the Surviving 



 

36  Corporation of the indemnification and other obligations pursuant to this
Section 6.8 and the articles of incorporation and bylaws of the Surviving
Corporation.

(d) In the event that Parent, the Surviving Corporation or any of their
successors or assigns: (i) consolidates with or merges into any other Person
and shall not be the continuing or surviving Person of such consolidation or
merger; or (ii) transfers or conveys a majority of its properties and assets
to any Person, then, and in each such case, proper provision shall be made so
that the successors, assigns and transferees of Parent or the Surviving
Corporation or their respective successors or assigns, as the case may be,
assume the obligations set forth in this Section 6.8.

6.9 _Takeover Laws_. The Company shall, upon the request of Parent or Merger
Sub, take all reasonable steps to exclude the applicability of, or to assist
in any challenge to the validity or applicability to the Merger or any other
transaction contemplated by this Agreement of, any Takeover Laws.

6.10 _Notification of Certain Matters_. The Company shall give prompt notice
to Parent, and Parent shall give prompt notice to the Company, of the
occurrence or non-occurrence of any event which is likely (a) to cause any
representation or warranty of such party contained in this Agreement to be
untrue or inaccurate in any material respect if made as of any time at
or prior to the Effective Time or (b) to result in any material failure of
such party to comply with or satisfy any covenant, condition or agreement to
be complied with or satisfied hereunder; _provided_ , _however_ , that the
delivery of any notice pursuant to this Section 6.10 shall not limit or
otherwise affect the remedies available hereunder to any of the parties
receiving such notice.

6.11 _Subsequent Filings_. Until the Effective Time, the Company shall timely
file with the SEC each form, report and document required to be filed by the
Company under the Exchange Act and will promptly deliver to Parent copies of
each such form, report and document. As of their respective dates, none of
such forms, reports and documents shall contain any untrue statement of a
material fact or omit to state a material fact required to be stated therein
or necessary to make the statements therein, in light of the circumstances
under which they were made, not misleading. The audited consolidated financial
statements and unaudited interim financial statements of the Company included
in such forms, reports and documents shall be prepared in accordance with
GAAP applied on a basis consistent with prior periods (except as otherwise
noted therein), and present fairly, in all material respects, the consolidated
financial position of the Company and its consolidated Subsidiaries as of
their respective dates, and the consolidated income, shareholders equity,
results of operations and changes in consolidated financial position or cash
flows for the periods presented therein (subject, in the case of unaudited
interim financial statements, to normal year-end audit adjustments).

6.12 _Resignation of Company s Directors_. If so requested by Parent, the
Company shall deliver to Parent, at or prior to the Closing Date, the
resignation effective as of the Closing, in form and substance reasonable
satisfactory to Parent, of each director of the Company.

6.13 _Certain Pre-Closing Transactions_. Prior to the Closing, upon the
satisfaction or waiver of all conditions to close set forth in Article VII,
the Company shall take 



 

37  such actions as may be reasonably requested by Parent, including (a)
transferring any businesses or contracts regulated by the U.S. Defense
Security Services to TAD PGS, Inc., or such other entity as Parent may
designate in writing, and (b) selling one or more Subsidiaries of the Company
to Parent or its affiliates at prices to be agreed upon between the parties;
provided, that nothing in this Section 6.13 shall affect any shareholders
right to receive the Merger Consideration as provided in and pursuant to the
terms of Article III and provided further, that prior to any action taken
pursuant to this Section 6.13, Parent shall demonstrate to the
reasonable satisfaction of the Company that the shareholders of the Company
will not otherwise be adversely affected. The Company and its Subsidiaries
shall, subject to compliance with the antitrust laws of the United States and
similar laws of other jurisdictions, reasonably cooperate with, and furnish
such information as shall be reasonably requested by, Parent and its
affiliates and Representatives following the date hereof and prior to Closing
to assist in connection with contemplated post-Closing integration and
reorganization.

(b) If (i) Parent terminates this Agreement pursuant to Section 8.3(a), (ii)
the Company or Parent terminates this Agreement pursuant to Section 8.2(b)

Section 8.5(b) by wire transfer of immediately available funds to an account
to be designated by Parent, not later than three (3) Business Days after
delivery to the Company of notice of demand for payment setting forth in
reasonable detail all such expenses.



 

42 (c) If the Company terminates this Agreement pursuant to Section 8.4(a) or
Section 8.4(c), then Parent shall pay to the Company an amount equal to the
Companys reasonably incurred expenses up to an amount equal to $7,500,000.
Parent shall pay expenses pursuant to this Section 8.5(c) by wire transfer of

not later than three (3) Business Days after delivery to Parent of notice of
demand for payment setting forth in reasonable detail all such expenses.

(d) If Parent terminates this Agreement pursuant to Section 8.3(b) or the
Company terminates this Agreement pursuant to Section 8.4(b), then the
Company shall pay to Parent immediately prior to or concurrently with such
termination, in the case of termination by the Company, or within three (3)
Business Days thereafter, in the case of termination by Parent, a termination
fee of $45,000,000 (the " _Breakup Fee_ "), by wire transfer of immediately
available funds to an account to be designated by Parent.

(e) In the event that: (i)(A) either Parent or the Company terminates this
Agreement pursuant to Section 8.2(b) and, at any time after the date of this

Proposal shall have been publicly disclosed or otherwise communicated to the
senior management or the Board, (B) either Parent or the Company terminates
this Agreement pursuant to Section 8.2(c), and, at any time after the date of
this Agreement and prior to the Shareholders Meeting or any adjournment or
postponement thereof at which the vote under Section 8.2(c) is taken, an
Acquisition Proposal shall have been publicly disclosed, or (C) Parent
terminates this Agreement pursuant to Section 8.3(a) and, at any time after
the date of this Agreement and prior to the breach giving rise to Parents
right to terminate under Section 8.3(a), an Acquisition Proposal shall have
been publicly disclosed or otherwise communicated to the senior management or
the Board, and (ii) the Company consummates a transaction contemplated by any
Acquisition Proposal within twelve (12) months of the date of such
termination, then the Company shall pay to Parent, promptly following the
consummation of such transaction, the Breakup Fee, by wire transfer of
immediately available funds to an account to be designated by Parent.

(f) The parties acknowledge that the agreements contained in this Section 8.5
are an integral part of this Agreement and the transactions contemplated by
this Agreement and that, without these agreements, the parties would not enter
into this Agreement. The parties further acknowledge that the Breakup Fee is
not a penalty, but rather a reasonable amount that will compensate Parent
and Merger Sub for the costs, expenses, efforts and resources expended and
opportunities foregone while negotiating this Agreement and in reliance on
this Agreement and on the expectation of the consummation of the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement, which amount would otherwise be impossible to
calculate with precision. In the event that the Breakup Fee becomes payable
and is paid by the Company pursuant to this Section 8.5, the right to receive
the Breakup Fee is each of Parents and Merger Subs and each of their
affiliates and Representatives sole and exclusive remedy under this
Agreement. In the event that the Company shall fail to pay the Breakup Fee or
expenses when due, the Company shall reimburse Parent and Merger Sub for all
reasonable costs and expenses actually incurred or accrued by Parent and
Merger Sub (including reasonable expenses of counsel) in connection with the
collection under and enforcement of this Section 8.5, including the filing of
any lawsuit or other legal action taken to collect payment, together with
interest on the unpaid amount from the date such amount was required to be
paid at the prime rate as reported in the Wall Street 



 

43  Journal on the date such amount was required to be paid. The Company shall
not be required to pay the Breakup Fee on more than one occasion.

(g) Any claim or cause of action based upon, arising out of, or related to
this Agreement may only be brought against Persons that are expressly named
as parties hereto, and then only with respect to the specific obligations set
forth herein. No former, current or future direct or indirect equity holders,
controlling Persons, shareholders, directors, officers, employees,
agents, affiliates, members, managers, general or limited partners or
assignees of the Company, Parent or Merger Sub or any of their respective
affiliates shall have any liability or obligation for any of the
representations, warranties, covenants, agreements, obligations or
liabilities of the Company, Parent or Merger Sub under this Agreement or of or
for any action, suit, arbitration, claim, litigation, investigation, or
proceeding based on, in respect of, or by reason of the
transactions contemplated hereby (including the breach, termination or
failure to consummate such transactions), in each case whether based on
contract, tort, strict liability, other Laws or otherwise and whether by
piercing the corporate veil, by a claim by or on behalf of a party hereto or
another Person or otherwise.

8.6 _Extension; Waiver_. At any time prior to the Effective Time, each of
Parent, Merger Sub and the Company may: (a) extend the time for the
performance of any of the obligations or other acts of the other parties; (b)
waive any inaccuracies in the representations and warranties of the
other parties contained in this Agreement or in any document, certificate or
writing delivered pursuant to this Agreement; or (c) waive compliance by the
other parties with any of the agreements or conditions contained in this
Agreement. Any agreement on the part of a party to any such extension or
waiver shall be valid only if set forth in any instrument in writing signed on
behalf of such party. The failure of a party to assert any of its rights
hereunder is not a waiver of such rights.

payment and performance thereof.



 

49 9.14 _Validity_. Whenever possible, each provision or portion of any provision
of this Agreement will be interpreted in such manner as to be effective and
valid under applicable Law; but the invalidity or unenforceability of any
provision of this Agreement will not affect the validity or enforceability of
any other provisions of this Agreement, each of which remains in full force
and effect. The parties agree to negotiate in good faith to replace such

to an injunction or injunctions to prevent breaches of this Agreement and to
enforce specifically the terms and provisions hereof in any court of the
United States or any state having jurisdiction, this being in addition to any

waive any requirement for the securing or posting of any bond, guarantee or
other undertaking in connection with the obtaining of any specific performance
or injunctive relief, and (c) the parties shall waive, in any action for
specific performance, the defense of adequacy of a remedy at Law. Either
partys pursuit of specific performance at any time is not an election of
remedies or waiver of the right to pursue any other right or remedy to which
such party may be entitled, including the right to pursue remedies
for liabilities or damages incurred or suffered by such party in the case of
a breach of this Agreement involving fraud or willful or intentional
misconduct.

9.16 _Captions_. The Article, Section and paragraph captions in this Agreement
