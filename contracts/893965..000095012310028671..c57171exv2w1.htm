of Company Common Stock who demands appraisal of those shares under Delaware Law effectively
withdraws or loses (through failure to perfect or otherwise) the right to appraisal, then, as of
the Effective Time or the occurrence of such event, whichever occurs later, those shares will be
converted into and represent only the right to receive the Merger Consideration as provided in
Section&nbsp;2.1(a), without interest, upon compliance with the provisions, and subject to the
limitations, of Section&nbsp;2.4 hereof. The Company will give Parent (a)&nbsp;prompt notice of any written

appraisal under Delaware Law. The Company will not, except with the prior written consent of
Parent, voluntarily make any payment with respect to any demands for appraisal of Company Common
Stock, offer to settle or settle any such demands or approve any withdrawal of any such demands.
Any payments made in respect of Dissenting Shares must be made by Parent or the Surviving
Corporation.

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt; margin-left: 2%">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(a) Subject to Section&nbsp;8.1(c), the parties to this Agreement agree that irreparable
damage would occur if any provision of this Agreement is not performed in accordance with
the terms hereof and that the parties will be entitled to specific performance of the terms
hereof in addition to any other remedy at law or equity. Notwithstanding the foregoing,
the Company hereby agrees that specific performance shall be its (and any third party
beneficiary&#146;s) primary remedy with respect to breaches by Parent, Acquisition Subsidiary or
any other Person or otherwise in connection with this Agreement or the transactions
contemplated hereby, except as provided in Section&nbsp;8.13(b) below, and subject to Section
8.13(b) below, that none of the Company nor any holder of Company Common Stock may accept
any other form of relief that may be available for breach under this Agreement, any
commitment letter (or similar document) or otherwise in connection with this Agreement or
the transactions contemplated hereby (including monetary damages).

For the avoidance of doubt, the Company and any third party beneficiary may

that may be available for breach under this Agreement or otherwise in connection with this
Agreement or the transactions contemplated hereby (including monetary damages), but no such
