AGREEMENT AND PLAN OF REORGANIZATION

THIS AGREEMENT AND PLAN OF REORGANIZATION, dated as of December 14, 2016 (this
"Agreement"), is by and among Veritex Holdings, Inc., a Texas corporation
("Parent"), Spartan Merger Sub, Inc., a Texas corporation and a wholly-owned
Subsidiary of Parent ("Merger Sub"), and Sovereign Bancshares, Inc., a Texas
corporation ("Target").

RECITALS

WHEREAS, the Boards of Directors of Parent and Merger Sub have determined that
it is advisable and in the best interests of their respective companies and
shareholders to consummate the strategic business combination transaction
contemplated herein on the terms and subject to the conditions set forth in
this Agreement, pursuant to which (i) Merger Sub will merge with and into
Target, with Target as the surviving corporation in the Merger (the "Merger"),
and (ii) immediately thereafter, Target will merge with and into Parent, with
Parent being the surviving corporation (the "Second-Step Merger", and together
with the Merger, the "Integrated Mergers");

WHEREAS, the Board of Directors of Target has determined that it is advisable
and in the best interests of its company and shareholders to consummate the
Merger on the terms and subject to the conditions set forth in this Agreement;

WHEREAS, concurrently with the execution and delivery of this Agreement and as
a condition and inducement for Parent to enter into this Agreement, (i) each
member of the Boards of Directors of Target and Sovereign Bank ("Target
Bank"), a Texas banking association and a wholly-owned Subsidiary of Target,
and certain executive officers of Target and Target Bank have entered into a
Voting Agreement in the form attached hereto as Exhibit A (the "Voting
Agreement"), whereby he or she agreed to vote the shares of Target Common
Stock beneficially owned by such Person in favor of this Agreement, the Merger
and the transactions contemplated hereby, and (ii) each member of the Boards
of Directors of Target and Target Bank that is not party to an employment
agreement has entered into a Director Support Agreement in the form attached
hereto as Exhibit B (collectively, the "Director Support Agreements"); and

WHEREAS, the parties desire to make certain representations, warranties and
agreements in connection with the Merger and also to prescribe certain
conditions to the Merger.

NOW, THEREFORE, in consideration of the mutual covenants, representations,
warranties and agreements contained herein, and intending to be legally bound
hereby, the parties agree as follows:

Article I 
THE MERGER

1.1 The Merger. Subject to the terms and conditions of this Agreement, in
accordance with applicable Law including the Texas Business Organizations Code
(the "TBOC"), at the Effective Time, Merger Sub shall merge with and into
Target, with Target as the surviving corporation (sometimes referred to in
such capacity as, the "Surviving Corporation"). Target, as the Surviving 

Corporation in the Merger, shall continue its corporate existence under the
Laws of the State of Texas. Upon consummation of the Merger, the separate
corporate existence of Merger Sub shall terminate. The Merger shall become
effective as of the date and time (the "Effective Time") set forth in the
certificate of merger (the "Certificate of Merger") to be filed with and
certified by the Secretary of State of the State of Texas (the "Texas
Secretary of State") on the Closing Date. At and after the Effective Time, the
Merger shall have the effects set forth in the applicable provisions of the
TBOC.

1.2 Closing. On the terms and subject to the conditions set forth in this
Agreement, the closing of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement (the
"Closing") shall take place at 10:00 a.m., Dallas, Texas time, on a date and
at a place to be specified by the parties, which date shall be no later than
fifteen (15) Business Days after the satisfaction or waiver (to the extent
permitted by applicable Law) of the conditions set forth in Article VII (other
than those conditions that by their nature are to be satisfied or waived at
the Closing, but in all cases subject to the satisfaction or waiver thereof),
unless extended by mutual agreement of the parties. The date on which the
Closing actually occurs is referred to as the "Closing Date."

1.3 Conversion of Stock. At the Effective Time, by virtue of the Merger and
without any action on the part of Parent, Merger Sub or Target or the holder
of any of the following securities:

(a) No Effect on Parent Common Stock. Each share of common stock, par value
$0.01 per share, of Parent (the "Parent Common Stock") issued and outstanding
immediately prior to the Effective Time shall remain issued and outstanding
and shall not be affected by the Merger.

(b) Conversion of Merger Sub Common Stock. Each share of common stock, par
value $0.01 per share, of Merger Sub issued and outstanding immediately prior
to the Effective Time shall be converted into one (1) share of common stock,
par value $0.01 per share, of the Surviving Corporation.

(c) Conversion of Target Common Stock. Subject to adjustment contemplated by
Article II, each share of the common stock, par value $1.00 per share, of
Target issued and outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time (the
"Target Common Stock"), except for Dissenting Shares and Cancelled Shares,
shall be cancelled and converted into the right to receive, without interest,
the Per Share Merger Consideration. All shares of Target Common Stock that
have been converted in the Merger shall be cancelled automatically and shall
cease to exist, and the holders of certificates which immediately prior to the
Effective Time represented such shares of Target Common Stock (each, a
"Certificate"), shall cease to have any rights with respect to those shares of
Target Common Stock, other than the right to receive following the Effective
Time the Per Share Merger Consideration pursuant to this Section 1.3(c) and in
accordance with procedures set forth in Section 2.3.

(d) Cancellation of Certain Shares of Target Common Stock. All shares of
Target Common Stock that are owned by Target as treasury shares or otherwise
owned by Parent, Merger Sub or Target (other than (i) shares held in trust
accounts, managed accounts and the like, or otherwise held in a fiduciary or
agency capacity, that are beneficially owned by third parties and (ii) shares
held, directly or indirectly, by Parent or Target in respect of a debt
previously contracted) shall be 

cancelled and shall cease to exist and no Per Share Merger Consideration or
other consideration shall be delivered in exchange therefor (such cancelled
shares, the "Cancelled Shares").

(e) Dissenting Shares. Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the
contrary, each outstanding share of Target Common Stock the holder of which
has perfected his or her appraisal rights under applicable Law including the
terms and provisions of Subchapter H of Chapter 10 of the TBOC (each a
"Dissenting Shareholder" and each such share, a "Dissenting Share") shall be
entitled to those rights and remedies set forth in Subchapter H of Chapter 10
of the TBOC; provided, however, in the event that a holder of Target Common
Stock fails to perfect, withdraws or otherwise loses any such right or remedy
granted by Subchapter H of Chapter 10 of the TBOC, each share of Target Common
Stock held by such shareholder shall be converted into and represent only the
right to receive the Per Share Merger Consideration. Target shall give Parent
prompt notice upon receipt by Target of any demands for payment of the value
of such shares of Target Common Stock and of withdrawals of such notice and
any other instruments provided pursuant to applicable Law, and Parent shall
have the right to direct all negotiations and proceedings with respect to any
such demands. Target shall not, except with the prior written consent of
Parent, voluntarily make any payment with respect to, or settle or offer to
settle, any such demand for payment, or waive any failure to timely deliver a
written demand for appraisal or the taking of any other action by such
Dissenting Shareholder as may be necessary to perfect appraisal rights under
applicable Law. Any payments made in respect of shares held by a Dissenting
Shareholder shall be made by the Surviving Corporation (or Parent as its
successor following consummation of the Second Step Merger).

(f) Target Stock Options. Notwithstanding anything in Sovereign Banchares,
Inc. 2004 Stock Incentive Plan or pursuant to a nonqualified stock option
agreement with Target (collectively, the "Target Stock Option Plans") to the
contrary, each option granted by Target to purchase shares of Target Common
Stock under a Target Stock Option Plan ("Target Option") that is unexpired,
outstanding and unexercised (whether vested or unvested) immediately prior to
the Effective Time shall fully vest and shall be cancelled and converted
automatically into the right to receive an amount in cash, without interest,
equal to the product of (i) the number of shares of Target Common Stock
available for purchase pursuant to such Target Stock Option multiplied by (ii)
the excess, if any, of the Per Option Amount over the exercise price per share
of Target Common Stock; provided, that the right to receive such cash
consideration shall be conditioned upon the holder thereof executing and
delivering to Target an option holder release agreement (collectively, the
"Option Holder Release Agreements") contemplated by Section 7.2(e)(iv). To the
extent that any Target Option that has an exercise price per share of Target
Common Stock that is greater than or equal to the Per Option Amount, such
Target Option shall be cancelled in exchange for no consideration. Payments to
the holders of Target Options shall be subject to applicable withholding under
the Code, or any provision of state, local or foreign Tax Law, with respect to
the making of such payment, and Parent shall deliver such withheld amount to
the applicable taxing authority.

(g) Conversion of Target Preferred Stock. Each share of Senior Non-Cumulative
Perpetual Preferred Stock, Series C, no par value, of Target ("Target SBLF
Preferred Stock") issued and outstanding immediately prior to the Effective
Time shall be converted into one share of preferred stock of Parent with an
equal liquidation preference ("Parent SBLF Preferred Stock"). 

Any such Parent SBLF Preferred Stock shall entitle holders thereof to
dividends from the date of issuance of such Parent SBLF Preferred Stock on

parties intend that (i) the Integrated Mergers shall together be treated as a
single integrated transaction that qualifies as a "reorganization" within the
meaning of § 368(a) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the
"Code"), and (ii) Parent, Merger Sub and Target shall each be a party to such
reorganization within the meaning of § 368(b) of the Code, (b) this Agreement

Stock, together with any dividends or distributions with respect thereto,
being hereinafter referred to as the "Exchange Fund"), to be issued and paid
pursuant to Article I and in accordance with Section 2.3(a) in exchange for
outstanding shares of Target Common Stock.

2.3 Delivery of Merger Consideration.

(a) As soon as practicable, but in no event later than ten (10) Business Days,
after the Effective Time, the Exchange Agent shall mail to each holder of
record (the "Holder"), of shares of Target Common Stock as of the Effective
Time (i) a letter of transmittal (which shall specify that delivery shall be
effected, and risk of loss and title to Certificate(s) shall pass, only upon
delivery of Certificate(s) (or affidavits of loss in lieu of any
Certificate(s)) to the Exchange Agent and shall be substantially in such form
as shall be prescribed by the Exchange Agent) (the "Letter of Transmittal"),
and (ii) instructions for use in surrendering Certificate(s) in exchange for
the Per Share Merger Consideration upon surrender of any Certificate. Parent
shall cause the Exchange Agent to provide Target a reasonable opportunity to
review and comment upon the Letter of Transmittal and other transfer
documents, or any amendments or supplements thereto, prior to disseminating to
the Holders and Parent shall consider and shall cause the Exchange Agent to
consider any comments proposed by Target in good faith. 

(b) Within five (5) Business Days after surrender to the Exchange Agent of its
Certificate(s), accompanied by a properly completed Letter of Transmittal, the
Exchange Agent shall pay and distribute to such Holder of Target Common Stock
the Per Share Merger Consideration in respect of the shares of Target Common
Stock represented by its Certificate(s), as applicable. Until so surrendered,
each such Certificate shall represent after the Effective Time, for all
purposes, only the right to receive, without interest, the Per Share Merger
Consideration upon surrender of such Target Common Stock in accordance with,
and any dividends or distributions to which such Holder is entitled pursuant
to, this Article II.

(c) In the event of a transfer of ownership of a Certificate representing
Target Common Stock that is not registered in the stock transfer records of
Target, the Per Share Merger Consideration shall be delivered pursuant to
Section 2.3(b) in exchange therefor to a Person other than the Person in whose
name the Target Common Stock so surrendered is registered if the Certificate
formerly representing such Target Common Stock shall be properly endorsed, if
a Certificate, or otherwise be in proper form for transfer and the Person
requesting such payment or issuance shall pay any transfer or other similar
Taxes required by reason of the payment or issuance to a Person other than the
registered Holder or establish to the satisfaction of Parent that the Tax has
been paid or is not applicable. The Exchange Agent (or, subsequent to the
first anniversary of the Effective Time, Parent) shall be entitled to deduct
and withhold from the Per Share Merger Consideration and any other cash
amounts otherwise payable pursuant to this Agreement to any Holder of Target
Common Stock (including with respect to any Dissenting Shares) such amounts as
the Exchange Agent or Parent, as the case may be, is required to deduct and
withhold under the Code, or any provision of state, local or foreign Tax Law,
with respect to the making of such payment; provided, that any transfer or
other similar Taxes payable in connection with the Merger (other than such
Taxes required to be paid by reason of the payment of the Per Share Merger
Consideration to a Person other than the registered Holder of the Target
Common Stock with respect to which such payment is made) shall be borne and
paid by Parent and Merger Sub. To the extent the amounts are so withheld by
the Exchange Agent or Parent, as the case may be, and paid over to the
applicable Tax authorities, such withheld amounts shall be treated for all
purposes of this Agreement as having been paid to the Holder of shares of
Target Common Stock in respect of whom such deduction and withholding was made
by the Exchange Agent or Parent, as the case may be.

(d) After the Effective Time, there shall be no transfers on the stock
transfer books of Target of any shares of Target Common Stock that were issued
and outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time other than to settle
transfers of Target Common Stock that occurred prior to the Effective Time.
If, after the Effective Time, any Target Common Stock is presented for
transfer to the Exchange Agent, it shall be cancelled and exchanged for the
Per Share Merger Consideration in accordance with Section 1.3 and the
procedures set forth in this Article II.

(e) Any portion of the Exchange Fund that remains unclaimed by the
shareholders of Target as of the first anniversary of the Effective Time shall
be paid to Parent; provided, that to the extent at any time prior to such
first anniversary any portion of the Exchange Fund that remains unclaimed
would have to be delivered to a public official pursuant to applicable
abandoned property, escheat or similar Laws, the Exchange Agent shall first
notify Parent and, at Parent's option, such portion shall instead be paid to
Parent. Any former shareholders of Target who 

have not theretofore complied with this Article II shall thereafter look only
to Parent with respect to the Per Share Merger Consideration, without any
interest thereon. None of Parent, Target, the Exchange Agent or any other
Person shall be liable to any former Holder of shares of Target Common Stock
for any amount delivered in good faith to a public official pursuant to
applicable abandoned property, escheat or similar Laws.

(f) In the event that any Certificate shall have been lost, stolen or
destroyed, upon the making of an affidavit of that fact by the Person claiming
such Certificate to be lost, stolen or destroyed and, if reasonably required
by Parent or the Exchange Agent, the posting by such Person of a bond in such
amount as Parent may determine is reasonably necessary as indemnity against
any claim that may be made against it with respect to such Certificate, the
Exchange Agent will issue in exchange for such lost, stolen or destroyed
Certificate the Per Share Merger Consideration deliverable in respect thereof
pursuant to this Agreement.

(g) Parent, in the exercise of its reasonable discretion, shall have the right
to make all determinations, not inconsistent with the terms of this Agreement,
governing the validity of any Letter of Transmittal and compliance by any
Target shareholder with the procedures and instructions set forth herein and
therein.

(h) No dividends or other distributions declared with respect to Parent Common
Stock shall be paid to the Holder of any unsurrendered Certificate until the
Holder thereof shall surrender such Certificate in accordance with this
Section 2.3. After the surrender of a Certificate in accordance with this
Section 2.3, the record Holder thereof shall be entitled to receive any such
dividends or other distributions, without any interest thereon, which
theretofore had become payable with respect to the whole shares of Parent
Common Stock which the shares of Target Common Stock represented by such
Certificate have been converted into the right to receive.

(i) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained herein, no certificates
or scrip representing fractional shares of Parent Common Stock shall be issued
upon the surrender for exchange of Certificates, no dividend or distribution
with respect to Parent Common Stock shall be payable on or with respect to any
fractional share, and such fractional share interests shall not entitle the
owner thereof to vote or to any other rights of a shareholder of Parent. In
lieu of the issuance of any such fractional share, after aggregating all
shares converted with respect to such former shareholder of Target, Parent
shall pay to each former shareholder of Target who otherwise would be entitled
to receive such fractional share an amount in cash (rounded to the nearest
cent) determined by multiplying (i) Stock Price by (ii) the fraction of a
share (rounded to the nearest hundredth when expressed in decimal form) of
Parent Common Stock which such Holder would otherwise be entitled to receive
pursuant to Section 1.3. Additionally, the aggregate Per Share Cash
Consideration to be paid to each shareholder shall be rounded to the nearest
cent.

collectively with any other such agreements, plans, arrangements or other
contracts, will, or would reasonably be expected to, as a result of the

(f) There are no pending or, to the Best Knowledge of Parent, threatened
claims (other than claims for benefits in the ordinary course), lawsuits or
arbitrations that have been asserted or instituted, and, to Parent's Best
Knowledge, no set of circumstances exists that may reasonably be expected to
give rise to a claim or lawsuit, against the Parent Benefit Plans, any
fiduciaries thereof with respect to their duties to the Parent Benefit Plans
or the assets of any of the trusts under any of the Parent Benefit Plans that
could reasonably be expected to result in any liability of Parent or any of
its Subsidiaries to the PBGC, the IRS, the DOL, any Multiemployer Plan, a
Multiple Employer Plan, any participant in a Parent Benefit Plan or any other
party.

(g) None of Parent and its Subsidiaries nor any Parent ERISA Affiliate nor, to

exercisability or delivery of or increase in the amount or value of, any
payment, compensation (including stock or stock-based), right or other benefit
to any employee, officer, director, independent contractor, consultant or
other service provider of Parent or any of its Subsidiaries, or result in any
limitation on the right of Parent or any of its Subsidiaries to amend, merge,
terminate or receive a reversion of assets from any Parent Benefit Plan or
related trust. Neither Parent nor any of its Subsidiaries maintains or

grievances or unfair labor practice claims or charges against Parent or any of
its Subsidiaries, or any strikes or other labor disputes against Parent or any

therewith), except where neither the cost of failure to hold nor the cost of

the failure to pay any fees or assessments) would, either individually or in
the aggregate, reasonably be expected to have a Material Adverse Effect on
Parent, and to the Best Knowledge of Parent no suspension or cancellation of

ARTICLE VI 
ADDITIONAL AGREEMENTS

6.1 Regulatory Matters.

(a) As soon as reasonably practicable following the date of this Agreement,
Parent and Target shall prepare the Joint Proxy Statement, and Parent shall
promptly prepare and file with the SEC the S-4, in which the Joint Proxy
Statement will be included as a prospectus, and any amendment thereto, if any.
Each of Parent and Target shall cooperate in respect of the form and content
of any other communication with the shareholders of Target. Each of Parent and
Target shall use their commercially reasonable efforts to have the S-4
declared effective under the Securities Act as promptly as practicable after
such filing, and Parent and Target shall thereafter mail or deliver 

the Joint Proxy Statement to their respective shareholders. Parent shall also
use commercially reasonable efforts to obtain all necessary state securities
Law or "Blue Sky" permits and approvals required to carry out the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement, and Target shall furnish all information
concerning Target and the holders of Target Common Stock as may be reasonably
requested in connection with any such action.

(b) The parties hereto shall cooperate with each other and use their
commercially reasonable efforts to promptly (and in the case of the Bank
Regulatory Applications, as defined below, within thirty (30) Business Days of
the date of this Agreement) prepare and file all necessary documentation, to
effect all applications, notices, petitions and filings, to obtain as promptly
as practicable all permits, consents, approvals and authorizations of all
third parties and Governmental Entities which are necessary or advisable to
consummate the transactions contemplated by this Agreement (including the
Merger and the Bank Merger (collectively the "Bank Regulatory Applications")),
and to comply with the terms and conditions of all such permits, consents,
approvals and authorizations of all such Governmental Entities. Target shall
have the right to review reasonably in advance all filings made in connection
with the transactions contemplated by this Agreement with any Governmental
Authority (other than with regard to information reasonably considered
confidential by Parent). Parent shall keep Target reasonably informed as to
the status of such applications and filings, and Parent shall promptly furnish
Target and its counsel with copies of all such regulatory filings and all
correspondence for which confidential treatment has not been requested. The
parties hereto agree that they will consult with each other with respect to
the obtaining of all permits, consents, approvals and authorizations of all
third parties and Governmental Entities necessary or advisable to consummate
the transactions contemplated by this Agreement and each party will keep the
other apprised of the status of matters relating to completion of the
transactions contemplated herein.

(c) Notwithstanding the foregoing, nothing contained herein shall be deemed to
require Parent or Target to take any action, or commit to take any action, or
agree to any condition or restriction, in connection with obtaining the
foregoing permits, consents, approvals and authorizations of Governmental
Entities that would reasonably be expected to have a Material Adverse Effect
on Parent and its Subsidiaries, taken as a whole, after giving effect to the
Merger (a "Materially Burdensome Condition").

(d) Parent and Target shall, upon request, furnish each other with all
information concerning themselves, their Subsidiaries, directors, officers and
shareholders and such other matters as may be reasonably necessary or
advisable in connection with the Joint Proxy Statement, the S-4 or any other
statement, filing, notice or application made by or on behalf of Parent,
Target or any of their respective Subsidiaries to any Governmental Entity in
connection with the Merger, the Bank Merger and the other transactions
contemplated by this Agreement.

(e) Parent and Target shall promptly advise each other upon receiving any
communication from any Governmental Entity whose consent or approval is
required for consummation of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement
that causes such party to believe that there is a reasonable likelihood that
any Requisite Regulatory Approval will not be obtained or that the receipt of
any such approval will be materially delayed. 

6.2 Access to Information.

(a) Upon reasonable notice and subject to applicable Laws, for the purposes of
verifying the representations and warranties of Target and Parent and
preparing for the Merger and the other matters contemplated by this Agreement,
each party shall, and shall cause each of its Subsidiaries to, afford to the
officers, employees, accountants, counsel, advisors and other representatives
of the other party, access, during normal business hours during the period
prior to the Effective Time, to all its properties, books, contracts,
commitments, personnel, information technology systems, and records (excluding
Parent's Tax Returns and related workpapers), and shall cooperate with the
other party in preparing to execute after the Effective Time conversion or
consolidation of systems and business operations generally, and, during such
period, each party shall, and shall cause its respective Subsidiaries to, make
available to the other party (i) a copy of each report, schedule, registration
statement and other document filed or received by it during such period
pursuant to the requirements of federal securities Laws or federal or state
banking Laws (other than reports or documents which either party is not
permitted to disclose under applicable Law), and (ii) all other information
concerning its business, properties and personnel as the other party may
reasonably request. Neither party nor its Subsidiaries shall be required to
provide access to or to disclose confidential supervisory information (as such
term is defined in 12 C.F.R. § 261.2) or other information where such access
or disclosure would jeopardize the attorney-client privilege of the
institution in possession or control of such information (after giving due
consideration to the existence of any common interest, joint defense or
similar agreement between the parties) or contravene any Law, rule,
regulation, order, judgment, decree, fiduciary duty or binding agreement
entered into prior to the date of this Agreement. The parties hereto will make
appropriate substitute disclosure arrangements under circumstances in which
the restrictions of the preceding sentence apply.

(b) Each of Parent and Target shall hold all information furnished by or on
behalf of the other party or any of such party's Subsidiaries or
representatives pursuant to Section 6.2(a) in confidence to the extent
required by, and in accordance with, the provisions of the letter agreement,
dated January 8, 2016, between Parent and Target, as amended (the
"Confidentiality Agreement").

(c) No investigation by either of the parties or their respective
representatives shall affect or be deemed to modify or waive the
representations and warranties of the other set forth herein. Nothing
contained in this Agreement shall give either party, directly or indirectly,
the right to control or direct the operations of the other party prior to the
Effective Time. Prior to the Effective Time, each party shall exercise,
consistent with the terms and conditions of this Agreement, complete control
and supervision over its and its Subsidiaries' respective operations.

6.3 Shareholders' Approvals.

(a) Each of Parent and Target shall call a meeting of its shareholders (the
"Parent Meeting" and the "Target Meeting," respectively) to be held as soon as
reasonably practicable after the S-4 is declared effective for the purpose of
obtaining the Requisite Target Vote and the Requisite Parent Vote required in
connection with this Agreement and the Merger and, and, if so desired and
mutually agreed, upon other matters of the type customarily brought before an
annual or special 

meeting of shareholders to adopt a merger agreement, and each shall use
commercially reasonable efforts to cause such meetings to occur as soon as
reasonably practicable and on the same date.

(b) The Board of Directors of each of Parent and Target shall use commercially
reasonable efforts to obtain from the shareholders of Parent and Target, as
the case may be, the Requisite Parent Vote, in the case of Parent, and the
Requisite Target Vote, in the case of Target, including by communicating to
its respective shareholders its recommendation (and including such
recommendation in the Joint Proxy Statement) that they adopt and approve (i)
this Agreement and the transactions contemplated hereby, in the case of
Target, and (ii) the issuance of the shares of Parent Common Stock in
connection with the Merger, in the case of Parent.

(c) Subject to Sections 8.1 and 8.2, if the Board of Directors of Target or
Parent, after receiving the advice of its outside counsel and, with respect to
financial matters, its financial advisors, determines in good faith that it
would be inconsistent with its fiduciary duties under applicable Law to
continue to recommend this Agreement, then in submitting this Agreement to its
shareholders, such Board of Directors may (but shall not be required to)
submit this Agreement to its shareholders without recommendation (although the
resolutions approving this Agreement as of the date hereof may not be
rescinded or amended), in which event the Board of Directors may communicate
the basis for its lack of a recommendation to its shareholders in the Joint
Proxy Statement or an appropriate amendment or supplement thereto to the
extent required by Law; provided, that the Board of Directors may not take any
actions under this sentence unless (i) it gives the other party at least three
(3) Business Days' prior written notice of its intention to take such action
and a reasonable description of the event or circumstances giving rise to its
determination to take such action (including, in the event such action is
taken by the Board of Directors of Target in response to an Acquisition
Proposal, the latest material terms and conditions of, and the identity of the
third party making, any such Acquisition Proposal, or any amendment or
modification thereof, or describe in reasonable detail such other event or
circumstances) and (ii) at the end of such notice period, the Board of
Directors takes into account any amendment or modification to this Agreement
proposed by the other party and after receiving the advice of its outside
counsel and, with respect to financial matters, its financial advisors,
determines in good faith that it would nevertheless be inconsistent with its
fiduciary duties under applicable Law to continue to recommend this Agreement.
Any material amendment to any Acquisition Proposal will be deemed to be a new
Acquisition Proposal for purposes of this Section 6.3 and will require a new
notice period as referred to in this Section 6.3. Parent or Target shall
adjourn or postpone the Parent Meeting or the Target Meeting, as the case may
be, if, as of the time for which such meeting is originally scheduled there
are insufficient shares of Parent Common Stock or Target Common Stock, as the
case may be, represented (either in person or by proxy) to constitute a quorum
necessary to conduct the business of such meeting, or if on the date of such
meeting Target or Parent, as applicable, has not received proxies representing
a sufficient number of shares necessary to obtain the Requisite Target Vote or
the Requisite Parent Vote.

(d) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary herein, unless this Agreement has
been terminated in accordance with its terms, each of the Parent Meeting and
Target Meeting shall be convened and this Agreement shall be submitted to the
shareholders of each of Parent and Target at the Parent Meeting and the Target
Meeting, respectively, for the purpose of voting on the adoption 

of this Agreement and the issuance of the shares of Parent Common Stock in
connection with the Merger, as applicable, and the other matters contemplated
hereby, and nothing contained herein shall be deemed to relieve either Parent
or Target of such obligation.

6.4 Legal Conditions to Merger. Subject in all respects to Section 6.1 of this
Agreement, each of Parent and Target shall, and shall cause its Subsidiaries
to, use commercially reasonable efforts (a) to take, or cause to be taken, all
actions necessary, proper or advisable to comply promptly with all legal
requirements that may be imposed on such party or its Subsidiaries with
respect to the Merger and the Bank Merger and, subject to the conditions set
forth in Article VII hereof, to consummate the transactions contemplated by
this Agreement, and (b) to obtain (and to cooperate with the other party to
obtain) any material consent, authorization, order or approval of, or any
exemption by, any Governmental Entity and any other third party that is
required to be obtained by Target or Parent or any of their respective
Subsidiaries in connection with the Merger, the Bank Merger and the other
transactions contemplated by this Agreement.

6.5 Tax-free Reorganization. Officers of Target, Parent and Merger Sub shall
execute and deliver to Fenimore, Kay, Harrison and Ford, LLP and to Norton Rose
Fulbright US LLP, respectively, certificates containing appropriate
representations and covenants, reasonably satisfactory in form and substance
to such counsel, at such time or times as may be reasonably requested by such
counsel, including prior to the effective date of the Joint Proxy Statement
and the Closing Date, in connection with such counsel's deliveries of opinions
with respect to the Tax treatment of the Integrated Mergers pursuant to
Section 7.2(c) and Section 7.3(c).

6.6 Stock Exchange Listing. Parent shall cause the shares of Parent Common
Stock to be issued in the Merger to be approved for listing on the NASDAQ,
subject to official notice of issuance, prior to the Effective Time.

6.7 Employee Matters.

(a) During the period commencing at the Effective Time and ending on the
twelve (12) month anniversary thereof, Parent shall provide the employees of
Target and its Subsidiaries who continue to be employed by Parent or its
Subsidiaries immediately following the Effective Time (the "Continuing
Employees"), while employed by Parent and its Subsidiaries after the Effective
Time, with employee benefits (excluding equity and equity based-compensation)
that are substantially comparable in the aggregate to the employee benefits
provided to similarly situated employees of Parent and its Subsidiaries.

(b) Parent shall keep Target's CEO reasonably informed regarding its personnel
plans and decisions concerning Target and Target Bank developed prior to the
Effective Time, including which employees are or are not anticipated to be
Continuing Employees. Parent's CEO and Target's CEO shall mutually agree upon
the manner and form of any communications regarding such matters to the
affected employees of Target or Target Bank occurring prior to Closing, but
for purposes of clarity, mutual agreement shall not be required for Parent's
personnel plans and decisions concerning Target and Target Bank. Other than to
the affected employees of Target and Target Bank, Parent shall not disclose
its personnel plans or decisions concerning employees of 

Target or Target Bank prior to Closing to any other employee of Target or
Target Bank without the prior consent of Target's CEO, which consent shall not
be unreasonably withheld.

(c) With respect to any employee benefit plans of Parent or its Subsidiaries
in which any Continuing Employees become eligible to participate on or after
the Effective Time (the "New Plans"), Parent shall use commercially reasonable
efforts to: (i) waive all pre-existing conditions, exclusions and waiting
periods with respect to participation and coverage requirements applicable to
such employees and their eligible dependents under any New Plans, except to
the extent such pre-existing conditions, exclusions or waiting periods would
apply under the analogous Target Benefit Plan, (ii) provide each such employee
and their eligible spouse and dependents with credit for any co-payments and
deductibles paid prior to the Effective Time under a Target Benefit Plan (to
the same extent that such credit was given under the analogous Target Benefit
Plan prior to the Effective Time) in satisfying any applicable deductible or
out-of-pocket requirements under any New Plans, and (iii) recognize all
service of such employees with Target and its Subsidiaries for all purposes in
any New Plan to the same extent that such service was taken into account under
the analogous Target Benefit Plan prior to the Effective Time; provided, that
the foregoing service recognition shall not apply (A) to the extent it would
result in duplication of benefits for the same period of services, (B) for
purposes of any defined benefit pension plan or benefit plan that provides
retiree welfare benefits, or (C) to any benefit plan that is a frozen plan or
provides grandfathered benefits.

(d) Nothing in this Agreement shall confer upon any employee, officer,
director, independent contractor or consultant of Target or any of its
Subsidiaries or Affiliates any right to continue in the employ or service of
Parent, Target, or any Subsidiary or Affiliate thereof, or shall interfere
with or restrict in any way the rights of Parent, Target, Parent or any
Subsidiary or Affiliate thereof to discharge or terminate the services of any
employee, officer, director or consultant of Target or any of its Subsidiaries
or Affiliates at any time for any reason whatsoever, with or without cause.
Nothing in this Agreement shall be deemed to (i) establish, amend, or modify
any Target Benefit Plan, New Plan or any other benefit or employment plan,
program, agreement or arrangement, or (ii) alter or limit the ability of
Parent or any of its Subsidiaries or Affiliates to amend, modify or terminate
any particular Target Benefit Plan, New Plan or any other benefit or
employment plan, program, agreement or arrangement after the Effective Time.
Without limiting the generality of the final sentence of Section 9.9, nothing
in this Agreement, express or implied, is intended to or shall confer upon any
Person, including any current or former employee, officer, director,
independent contractor or consultant (or any spouse or dependent of such
individual) of Target or any of its Subsidiaries or Affiliates, any right,
benefit or remedy of any nature whatsoever under or by reason of this
Agreement.

(e) Target shall take all actions and obtain all consents necessary to ensure
those Employment Agreements set forth on Confidential Schedule 6.7(e) of the
Target Disclosure Schedules (the "Target Employment Agreements") shall be
terminated contingent upon and effective as of the Closing and all amounts
owed in connection therewith shall be paid on the Closing Date and properly
reflected on the books and records of Target and fully reflected in the
Transaction Expenses. 

(f) Target, the Board of Directors of Target, and any committee of the Board
of Directors administering the Target Stock Option Plans, as applicable, shall
take or cause to be taken all actions necessary (including the adoption of
resolutions) and shall obtain all necessary consents to effect the treatment
of Target Options pursuant to Section 1.3(f), and to ensure that, effective as
of the Effective Time, there are no obligations with respect to Target Options
other than as set forth in Section 1.3(f).

(g) Target shall take all action necessary and appropriate to terminate or
withdrawal from all Target Benefit Plans that are "employee benefit plans"
within the meaning of ERISA (unless Parent provides written notice to Target
no later than three (3) Business Days prior to the Closing Date that such
plans shall not be terminated), to be effective not later than, (i) for any
Target Qualified Plan that includes a "cash or deferred arrangement" within
the meaning of Section 401(k) of the Code, the date immediately preceding the
Closing Date, and (ii) for all other Target Benefit Plans, the Effective Time.
Target shall provide Parent with evidence of termination of such Target
Benefit Plan(s) as provided above pursuant to resolutions of the Target Board
of Directors. The form and substance of such resolutions shall be subject to
review and approval by Parent. Target also shall take such other actions in
furtherance of terminating such Target Benefit Plan(s) as Parent may
reasonably require.

(h) Target shall take all action necessary and appropriate to terminate the
PEO Agreement effective prior to the Closing.

6.8 Indemnification; Directors' and Officers' Insurance.

(a) From and after the Effective Time, Parent shall indemnify and hold
harmless each present and former director, officer or employee of Target and
its Subsidiaries (in each case, when acting in such capacity) (collectively,
the "Target Indemnified Parties") against any costs or expenses (including
reasonable attorneys' fees), judgments, fines, losses, damages or liabilities
incurred in connection with any threatened or actual claim, action, suit,
proceeding or investigation, whether civil, criminal, administrative or
investigative, whether arising before or after the Effective Time, arising out
of the fact that such Person is or was a director, officer or employee of
Target or any of its Subsidiaries and pertaining to matters existing or
occurring at or prior to the Effective Time, including the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement to the same extent as such Persons are
indemnified as of the date of this Agreement by Target pursuant to the Target
Constituent Documents, the governing or organizational documents of any
Subsidiary of Target; and Parent shall also advance expenses as incurred by
such Target Indemnified Party to the same extent as such Persons are entitled
to advancement of expenses as of the date of this Agreement by Target pursuant
to the Target Constituent Documents, the governing or organizational documents
of any Subsidiary of Target and any indemnification agreements in existence as
of the date hereof; provided, that, if required, the Target Indemnified Party
to whom expenses are advanced provides an undertaking to repay such advances
if it is ultimately determined that such Target Indemnified Party is not
entitled to indemnification.

(b) Prior to the Effective Time, in close consultation with Parent, Target
shall purchase a directors' and officers' liability tail insurance policy with
respect to the Target's existing basic and excess directors' and officers'
liability insurance or with respect to coverage and amount 

that are no less favorable in any material respect to such directors and
officers than the Target's existing policies as of the date hereof (the "DandO
Tail Policy"), in either case, that, for a period of six (6) years following
the Effective Time, will provide directors' and officers' liability insurance
that serves to reimburse the present and former officers and directors of
Target (determined as of the Effective Time) with respect to claims against
such directors and officers arising from facts or events occurring before the
Effective Time (including the transactions contemplated by this Agreement).

(c) The provisions of this Section 6.8 shall survive the Effective Time and
are intended to be for the benefit of, and shall be enforceable by, each
Target Indemnified Party and his or her heirs and representatives. If Parent
or any of its successors or assigns will consolidate with or merge into any
other entity and not be the continuing or surviving entity of such
consolidation or merger, transfer all or substantially all of its assets or
deposits to any other entity or engage in any similar transaction, then in
each case, Parent will cause proper provision to be made so that the
successors and assigns of Parent will expressly assume the obligations set
forth in this Section 6.8.

6.9 Minimum Allowance for Loan Losses. Target shall cause Target Bank to
maintain its allowance for loan losses at a level consistent with Target
Bank's historical methodology, pass practices, existing policies and in
compliance with GAAP, and at a minimum, on the Business Day immediately prior
to the Closing Date, the allowance for loan losses of Target Bank shall be at
least $13,976,000, less any amount reduced through the usage of the specific
reserves for the outstanding classified loans set forth on Confidential
Schedule 6.9 of the Target Disclosure Schedules (the "Minimum Allowance
Amount"); provided, that (i) Target has requested and received Parent's
consent to resolve such outstanding classified loans and use the specific
reserves associated with the same, which consent shall not to be unreasonably
withheld or (ii) Target is instructed by any Regulatory Authority to resolve
such outstanding classified loan. For the purpose of clarity, if Target is
instructed by any Regulatory Authority to resolve an outstanding classified
loan set forth on Confidential Schedule 6.9 of the Target Disclosure
Schedules, then the Minimum Allowance Amount for purposes of this Agreement
may be reduced only by the specific reserves associated with such classified
loan as set forth on Confidential Schedule 6.9 of the Target Disclosure
Schedules. If the allowance for loan losses is less than the Minimum Allowance
Amount on the Business Day immediately prior to the Closing Date, Target shall
take or cause to be taken all action necessary to increase the allowance for
loan losses to an amount equal to the Minimum Allowance Amount as of the
Closing Date and any such increase shall be accounted for in the calculation
of the Tangible Common Equity for purposes of Section 2.1 hereof.

6.10 Additional Agreements. In case at any time after the Effective Time any
further action is necessary or desirable to carry out the purposes of this
Agreement (including any merger between a Subsidiary of Parent, on the one
hand, and a Subsidiary of Target, on the other) or to vest Parent with full
title to all properties, assets, rights, approvals, immunities and franchises
of any of the parties to the Merger, the proper officers and directors of each
party to this Agreement and their respective Subsidiaries shall take all such
necessary action as may be reasonably requested by Parent. 

6.11 Advise of Changes. Parent and Target shall each promptly (but in no event
more than 24 hours) advise the other party of any change or event (i) that has
had or is reasonably likely to have a Material Adverse Effect on it or (ii)
which it believes would or would be reasonably likely to cause or constitute a
material breach of any of its representations, warranties or covenants
contained herein or that reasonably could be expected to give rise,
individually or in the aggregate, to the failure of a condition in Article
VII; provided, that any failure to give notice in accordance with the
foregoing with respect to any breach shall not be deemed to constitute a
violation of this Section 6.11 or the failure of any condition set forth in
Sections 7.2 or 7.3 to be satisfied, or otherwise constitute a breach of this
Agreement by the party failing to give such notice, in each case unless the
underlying breach would independently result in a failure of the conditions
set forth in Sections 7.2 or 7.3 to be satisfied.

6.12 Corporate Governance. Effective as of the Effective Time, Parent shall
appoint the two (2) individuals set forth on Confidential Schedule 6.12 to the
Target Disclosures Schedules, one of whom shall be appointed as a Vice
Chairman, to the Boards of Directors of Parent and the Bank.

6.13 No Solicitation.

(a) Target agrees that it will not, and will cause its Subsidiaries and its
and their officers, directors, agents, advisors and representatives
(collectively, "Representatives") not to, directly or indirectly, (i)
initiate, solicit, knowingly encourage or knowingly facilitate inquiries or
proposals with respect to, (ii) engage or participate in any negotiations with
any Person concerning, or (iii) provide any confidential or nonpublic
information or data to, or have or participate in any discussions with, any
Person relating to, any Acquisition Proposal, except to notify such Person of
the existence of the provisions of this Section 6.13; provided, that, prior to
the adoption of this Agreement by the shareholders of Target by the Requisite
Target Vote, in the event Target receives an unsolicited bona fide written
Acquisition Proposal, it may, and may permit its Subsidiaries and its and its
Subsidiaries' Representatives to, furnish or cause to be furnished nonpublic
information or data and participate in such negotiations or discussions to the
extent that its Board of Directors concludes in good faith (after receiving
the advice of its outside counsel, and with respect to financial matters, its
financial advisors) that failure to take such actions would be inconsistent
with its fiduciary duties under applicable Law; provided further, that, prior
to providing any nonpublic information permitted to be provided pursuant to
the foregoing proviso, Target shall have entered into a confidentiality
agreement with such third party on terms no less favorable to it than the
Confidentiality Agreement, which confidentiality agreement shall not provide
such Person with any exclusive right to negotiate with Target. Target will,
and will cause its Representatives to, immediately cease and cause to be
terminated any activities, discussions or negotiations conducted before the
date of this Agreement with any Person other than Parent with respect to any
Acquisition Proposal and will use commercially reasonable efforts, subject to
applicable Law, to (x) enforce any confidentiality, standstill or similar
agreement relating to an Acquisition Proposal and (y) within ten (10) Business
Days after the date hereof, request and confirm the return or destruction of
any confidential information provided to any Person (other than Parent and its
Affiliates) pursuant to any such agreement. Target will promptly (within
twenty-four (24) hours) advise Parent following receipt of any Acquisition
Proposal or any inquiry which could reasonably be expected to lead to 

an Acquisition Proposal, and the substance thereof (including the identity of
the Person making such Acquisition Proposal and copies of any written
Acquisition Proposal), and will keep Parent apprised of any related
developments, discussions and negotiations on a current basis, including any
amendments to or revisions of the terms of such inquiry or Acquisition
Proposal.

(b) In the event that the Board of Directors of Target determines in good
faith, after consultation with its financial advisor and upon advice of
outside legal counsel, that it desires to accept an Acquisition Proposal that
it deems to be a Superior Proposal, it will notify Parent in writing of its
intent to terminate this Agreement under Section 8.1(j) in order to enter into
an acquisition agreement with respect to, or recommend acceptance of, the
Superior Proposal. That notice will specify all of the material terms and
conditions of the Superior Proposal. Parent will have a period of three (3)
Business Days to evaluate and respond to Target's notice. If Parent notifies
Target in writing prior to the expiration of the three (3) Business Day period
that it will increase the Aggregate Merger Consideration to an amount at least
equal to that of the Superior Proposal, then Target will not be permitted to
enter into an acquisition agreement with respect thereto. If the Board of
Directors of Target determines, in good faith, upon the advice of its
financial advisor and outside legal counsel, that the revised Parent offer is
not at least equal to the Superior Proposal, Target may terminate this
Agreement as provided in Section 8.1(j).

6.14 Coordination; Integration.

(a) The senior officers of Target and Target Bank agree to meet with senior
officers of Parent and the Bank, on a weekly basis or as reasonably requested
by Parent, relating to the development, coordination and implementation of the
post-Merger operating and integration plans of the Bank, as the resulting
institution in the Bank Merger and to otherwise review the financial and
operational affairs of Target and Target Bank; provided, that Parent and the
Bank shall have no right to review confidential supervisory information (as
such term is defined in 12 C.F.R. § 261.2) of Target or Target Bank, and to
the extent permitted by applicable Law, each of Target and Target Bank agrees
to give due consideration to Parent's input on such matters, consistent with
this Section 6.14, with the understanding that Parent shall in no event be
permitted to exercise control of Target or Target Bank prior to the Effective
Time and, except as specifically provided under this Agreement, Target and
Target Bank shall have no obligation to act in accordance with Parent's input.

(b) Commencing after the date hereof and to the extent permitted by applicable
Law, Parent, Target and Target Bank shall use their commercially reasonable
efforts to plan the integration of Target and Target Bank with the businesses
of Parent and their respective affiliates to be effective as much as
practicable as of the Closing Date; provided, however, that in no event shall
Parent or its affiliates be entitled to control Target or Target Bank prior to
the Effective Time. Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, from the
date hereof through the Effective Time and consistent with the performance of
their day-to-day operations and the continuous operation of Target and Target
Bank in the ordinary course of business, Target's and Target Bank's employees
and officers shall use their commercially reasonable efforts to provide
support, including support from Target's and Target Bank's outside
contractors, and to assist Parent in performing all tasks, including equipment
installation, reasonably required to result in a successful integration at the 

Closing; provided, however, that no integration shall take place prior to the
Closing. Parent shall provide such assistance of its personnel as Target and
Target Bank shall request to permit Target and Target Bank to comply with
their obligations under this Section 6.14.

6.15 Public Announcements. Neither Parent nor Target, or Affiliate or
Subsidiary of the same, will make any announcement, statement, press release,
acknowledgment or other public disclosure of the existence of, or reveal the
terms, conditions or the status of, this Agreement or the transactions
contemplated hereby without the prior written consent of the other parties to
this Agreement; but Parent and Target are permitted to make any public
disclosures or governmental filings as legal counsel may deem necessary to
maintain compliance with or to prevent violations of applicable federal or
state Laws or regulations, that may be necessary to obtain regulatory approval
for the transactions contemplated hereby, or that may be necessary to enforce
the obligations under this Agreement.

6.16 Change of Method. Target and Parent shall be empowered, upon their mutual
agreement, at any time prior to the Effective Time, to change the method or
structure of effecting the combination of Target and Parent (including the
provisions of Article I), if and to the extent they both deem such change to
be necessary, appropriate or desirable; provided, however, that no such change
shall (i) alter or change the Per Share Cash Consideration or the Per Share
Stock Consideration, (ii) adversely affect the Tax treatment of Target's
shareholders or Parent's shareholders pursuant to this Agreement, (iii)
adversely affect the Tax treatment of Target or Parent pursuant to this
Agreement or (iv) materially impede or delay the consummation of the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement in a timely manner. The Parties
agree to reflect any such change in an appropriate amendment to this Agreement
executed by both parties in accordance with Section 8.3.

Merger Agreement in a form specified by Parent and reasonably acceptable

including any supplemental indentures, guarantees, or declarations of trust
required by the terms of the Trust Preferred Issuance, or as may reasonably be
requested by the trustees thereunder. 

6.21 Financing. Parent will use its commercially reasonable efforts to raise
funds through an offering of Parent securities in an amount sufficient in its
reasonable judgment to pay the Aggregate Cash Consideration.

Taxes and all conveyance fees, recording charges and other fees and charges
(including any penalties and interest) incurred in connection with the
consummation of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, if any, shall
be paid by the party liable for such Tax under Law when due, and such party
will, at its own expense, file all necessary Tax Returns and other
documentation with respect to all such Taxes, fees and charges, and, if
required by applicable Law, the other party will, and will cause its
Affiliates to, join in the execution of any such Tax Returns and other

it determines is appropriate and shall pay all amounts due with respect to any

Target if any Governmental Entity that must grant a Requisite Regulatory
Approval has denied approval of or requested withdrawal of the application

Target if the Merger shall not have been consummated on or before the one (1)

of a party hereto to any such extension or waiver shall be valid only if set

("Target Common Stock"), other than Cancelled Shares and Dissenting Shares,
will be exchanged for such consideration as set forth in the Reorganization

of, any trust agreement, loan or credit agreement, note, bond, mortgage,
indenture, lease or other agreement, instrument or law applicable to such
Shareholder the Shares; and

(f)No consent, approval or authorization of, or designation, declaration or

Agreement, (x) transfers for estate and tax planning purposes, including
transfers to relatives, trusts and charitable organizations, subject to the
transferee agreeing in writing to be bound by the terms of this Voting
Agreement, (y) transfers to any other shareholder of Target who has executed a
copy of this Voting Agreement on the date hereof, and (z) such transfers as
Parent may otherwise permit in its sole discretion. Any transfer or other
disposition in violation of the terms of this Section 2 shall be null and
void.

Section 3.Each Shareholder hereby agrees during the term of this Voting
Agreement to vote the Shares, and any additional shares of Target Common Stock
or other voting securities of Target acquired by such Shareholder after the
date hereof, (a) in favor of the approval and adoption of the Reorganization
Agreement and the transactions contemplated thereby at the Target Meeting and
(b) against approval of any acquisition proposal made in opposition to or
competition with such proposals (an "Acquisition Proposal") presented at the
Target Meeting or any other meeting of shareholders held prior or subsequent
to the Target Meeting. If there has been a modification or amendment to the
Reorganization Agreement that reduces the Aggregate Merger Consideration,
other than any adjustment to the Aggregate Merger Consideration provided for
in the Reorganization Agreement, then this Section 3 shall be inapplicable.

Section 4.Each Shareholder shall not invite or seek any Acquisition Proposal,
support (or publicly suggest that anyone else should support) any Acquisition
Proposal that may be made, or ask the Target Board to consider, support or
seek any Acquisition Proposal or otherwise take any action designed to make
any Acquisition Proposal more likely. None of the Shareholders shall meet or
otherwise communicate with any Person that makes or is considering making an
Acquisition Proposal or any representative of such Person after becoming aware
that the Person has made or is considering making an Acquisition Proposal.
Each Shareholder shall promptly advise Target of each contact the Shareholder
or any of the Shareholder's representatives may receive from any Person
relating to any Acquisition Proposal or otherwise indicating that any Person
may wish to participate or engage in any transaction arising out of any
Acquisition Proposal and will provide Target with all information Parent
requests that is available to the Shareholder regarding any such Acquisition
Proposal or possible Acquisition Proposal. Each Shareholder will not make any
claim or join in any litigation alleging that the Target Board is required to
consider, endorse or support any Acquisition Proposal or to invite or seek any
Acquisition Proposal. Each Shareholder shall not take any other action that is
reasonably likely to make consummation of the Merger less likely or to impair
Parent's ability to exercise any of the rights granted by the Reorganization
Agreement.

Section 5.Each Shareholder acknowledges that Parent and Target are relying on
this Voting Agreement in reviewing Target's business, in preparing the joint
proxy statement and the registration statement on Form S-4, in proceeding with
the filing of applications for regulatory approvals and in undertaking other
actions necessary for the consummation of the Merger. Each Shareholder and
Target acknowledges that the performance of this Voting Agreement is intended
to benefit Parent. Section 6.This Voting Agreement shall continue in effect until the earlier to
occur of (a) the termination of the Reorganization Agreement in accordance
with its terms or (b) the Effective Time.

Section 7.Nothing in this Voting Agreement shall be deemed to restrict any of
the Shareholders from taking any action in the capacity of a director or
officer (if applicable) of Target or Target Bank that such Shareholder shall
believe is necessary to fulfill the Shareholder's duties and obligations as a
director or officer (if applicable), and no such actions shall be deemed to be
a breach of this Agreement. Each Shareholder is executing this Voting
Agreement solely in the Shareholder's capacity as a shareholder of Target.

Section 8.Each Shareholder hereby (a) confirms his or her knowledge of the
availability of the rights of dissenting shareholders under the TBOC with
respect to the Merger, and (b) confirms receipt of a copy of the provisions of
the TBOC related to the rights of dissenting shareholders. Each Shareholder
hereby waives and agrees not to assert, and shall use its best efforts to
cause any of its Affiliates who hold of record any of the Shareholder's Shares
to waive and not to assert, any appraisal rights with respect to the Merger
that the Shareholder or such affiliate may now or hereafter have with respect
to any Shares (or any other shares of capital stock of Target that the
Shareholder shall hold of record at the time that the Shareholder may be
entitled to assert appraisal rights with respect to the Merger) whether
pursuant to the TBOC or otherwise.

Section 9.This Voting Agreement may not be modified, amended, altered or
supplemented with respect to a particular Shareholder except upon the
execution and delivery of a written agreement executed by Target, Parent and
the Shareholder. Any such modification, amendment, alteration or supplement
shall only apply to the Shareholder(s) executing such written agreement and
this Voting Agreement will remain in full force and effect with respect to
Shareholders who do not execute such written agreement.

Section 10.For the convenience of the parties hereto, this Voting Agreement
may be signed in multiple counterparts, each of which will be deemed an
original, and all counterparts hereof so signed by the parties hereto, whether
or not such counterpart will bear the execution of each of the parties hereto,
will be deemed to be, and is to be construed as, one and the same Voting
Agreement. A facsimile or electronic scan in "PDF" format of a signed
counterpart of this Voting Agreement will be sufficient to bind the party or
parties whose signature(s) appear thereon.

Section 11.This Voting Agreement, the Director Support Agreements, the
Reorganization Agreement and the other agreements, documents, schedules and
instruments signed and delivered by the parties to each other at the Closing
are the full understanding of the parties, a complete allocation of risks
between them and a complete and exclusive statement of the terms and
conditions of their agreement relating to the subject matter hereof and
supersede any and all prior agreements, whether written or oral, that may
exist between the parties with respect thereto. Except as otherwise
specifically provided in this Voting Agreement, no conditions, usage of trade,
course of dealing or performance, understanding or agreement purporting to
modify, vary, explain or supplement the terms or conditions of this Voting
Agreement is binding unless hereafter made in writing and signed by the party
to be bound, and no modification will be effected by the acknowledgment or acceptance of documents containing terms or conditions at
variance with or in addition to those set forth in this Voting Agreement.

Section 12.If any provision of this Voting Agreement is held to be illegal,
invalid or unenforceable under present or future laws, then (a) this Voting
Agreement is to be construed and enforced as if such illegal, invalid or
unenforceable provision were not a part hereof; (b) the remaining provisions
of this Voting Agreement will remain in full force and effect and will not be
affected by such illegal, invalid or unenforceable provision or by its
severance from this Voting Agreement; and (c) there will be added
automatically as a part of this Voting Agreement a provision mutually agreed
to which is similar in terms to such illegal, invalid or unenforceable
provision as may be possible and still be legal, valid and enforceable.

Section 13.Any and all notices, requests, instructions and other
communications required or permitted to be given under this Voting Agreement
after the date of this Voting Agreement by any party hereto to any other party
may be delivered personally or by nationally recognized overnight courier
service or sent by U.S. mail or (except in the case of payments) by facsimile
transmission, at the respective addresses or transmission numbers set forth
below and is deemed delivered (a) in the case of personal delivery, facsimile
transmission, when received; (b) in the case of mail, upon the earlier of
actual receipt or five (5) Business Days after deposit in the United States
Postal Service, first class certified or registered mail, postage prepaid,
return receipt requested; and (c) in the case of an overnight courier service,
one (1) Business Day after delivery to such courier service with and
instructions for overnight delivery. The parties may change their respective
addresses and transmission numbers by written notice to all other parties,
sent as provided in this Section 13. All communications must be in writing and
sent to the addresses of the parties hereto set forth below their signature on
the signature pages hereof.

Section 14.Each of the parties hereto acknowledges that the other parties
would be irreparably damaged and would not have an adequate remedy at law for
money damages if any of the covenants contained in this Voting Agreement were
not performed in accordance with its terms or otherwise were materially
breached. Each of the parties hereto therefore agrees that, without the
necessity of proving actual damages or posting bond or other security, the
other party will be entitled to temporary and/or permanent injunction or
injunctions which a court of competent jurisdiction concludes is justified to
prevent breaches of such performance and to specific enforcement of such
covenants in addition to any other remedy to which they may be entitled, at
law or in equity. If attorneys' fees or other costs are incurred to secure
performance of any of the obligations herein provided for, or to establish
damages for the breach thereof, or to obtain any other appropriate relief, the
prevailing party is entitled to recover reasonable attorneys' fees and costs
incurred therein and determined by the court to be justified.

Section 15.From time to time, at Parent's request and without further
consideration, each Shareholder shall execute and deliver such additional
documents reasonably requested by Parent as may be necessary or desirable to
consummate and make effective, in the most expeditious manner practicable, the
transactions contemplated by this Voting Agreement.

Section 16.THIS VOTING AGREEMENT IS TO BE CONSTRUED IN ACCORDANCE WITH AND
GOVERNED BY THE LAWS OF THE STATE OF TEXAS, WITHOUT REGARD FOR THE PROVISIONS THEREOF REGARDING CHOICE OF LAW THAT WOULD
APPLY THE LAW OF A DIFFERENT JURISDICTION. VENUE FOR ANY CAUSE OF ACTION
BETWEEN THE PARTIES TO THIS VOTING AGREEMENT WILL LIE IN DALLAS COUNTY, TEXAS.

Section 17.No party to this Voting Agreement will by any act (except by a
written instrument given pursuant to Section 9) be deemed to have waived any
right or remedy hereunder or to have acquiesced in any breach of any of the
terms and conditions hereof. No failure to exercise, nor any delay in
exercising any right, power or privilege hereunder by any party hereto will
operate as a waiver thereof. No single or partial exercise of any right, power
or privilege hereunder will preclude any other or further exercise thereof or
the exercise of any other right, power or privilege. A waiver of any party of
any right or remedy on any one occasion will not be construed as a bar to any
right or remedy that such party would otherwise have on any future occasion or
to any right or remedy that any other party may have hereunder. Any party may
unilaterally waive a right which is solely applicable to it.

Section 18.All of the terms, covenants, representations, warranties and
conditions of this Voting Agreement are binding upon, and inure to the benefit
of and are enforceable by, the parties and their respective successors,
representatives and permitted assigns. No party to this Voting Agreement may
assign this Voting Agreement, by operation of law or otherwise, in whole or in
part, without the prior written consent of the other parties, and any
purported assignment made or attempted in violation of this Section 18 shall
be null and void. Nothing contained in this Voting Agreement, express or
implied, is intended to confer upon any persons, other than the parties hereto
or their respective successors, any rights, remedies, obligations, or
liabilities under or by reason of this Voting Agreement.

Section 19.Whenever the words "include," "includes" or "including" are used in
this Voting Agreement, they are deemed to be followed by the words "without
limitation." The words "hereof," "herein" and "hereunder" and words of similar
import when used in this Voting Agreement refer to this Voting Agreement as a
whole and not to any particular provision in this Voting Agreement. Each use
herein of the masculine, neuter or feminine gender are deemed to include the
other genders. Each use herein of the plural include the singular and vice
versa, in each case as the context requires or as is otherwise appropriate.
The word "or" is used in the inclusive sense. Any agreement or instrument
defined or referred to herein or in any agreement or instrument that is
referred to herein means such agreement or instrument as from time to time
amended, modified or supplemented, including by waiver or consent. References
to a person are also to its permitted successors or assigns. In the event that
an ambiguity or a question of intent or interpretation arises, this Voting
Agreement shall be construed as if drafted jointly by the parties, and no
presumption or burden of proof shall arise favoring or disfavoring any party
by virtue of the authorship of any provision of this Voting Agreement.

EXHIBIT B







DIRECTOR SUPPORT AGREEMENT

This DIRECTOR SUPPORT AGREEMENT (this "Agreement") is made and entered into as
of December 14, 2016, by and between Veritex Holdings, Inc. ("Parent"), a
Texas corporation and registered bank holding company under the Bank Holding
Company Act of 1956, as amended (the "BHC Act"), and _________, an individual
resident of the State of Texas ("Director"). Terms with their initial letters
capitalized and not otherwise defined herein have the meanings given them in
the Reorganization Agreement (as defined below).

RECITALS

WHEREAS, concurrently with the execution of this Agreement, Parent, Spartan
Merger Sub, Inc. ("Merger Sub"), a Texas corporation and wholly-owned
subsidiary of Parent and Sovereign Bancshares, Inc. ("Target"), a Texas
corporation and registered bank holding company under the BHC Act, have
entered into an Agreement and Plan of Reorganization, dated as of the date
hereof (the "Reorganization Agreement"), pursuant to which (i) Merger Sub will
merge with and into Target, with Target as the surviving corporation in the
Merger (the "Merger"), and (ii) immediately thereafter, Target will merge with
and into Parent, with Parent being the surviving corporation (the "Second-Step
Merger", and together with the Merger, the "Integrated Mergers"); and

WHEREAS, as a condition and inducement to Parent's willingness to enter into
the Reorganization Agreement, Parent and Director have agreed to enter into
this Agreement.

NOW, THEREFORE, in consideration for receipt of such confidential information
and trade secrets and in consideration of the premises and mutual covenants
contained herein and in the Reorganization Agreement intending to be legally
bound hereby, Parent and Director agree as follows:

AGREEMENT

1.Director Support. Director agrees to use his or her best efforts to refrain
from harming the goodwill of Target, any Subsidiary of Target ("Target
Subsidiary"), Parent or any Subsidiary of Parent, and their respective
customer, client and vendor relationships.



2.Director Covenants.



(a)Director acknowledges that he has received substantial, valuable
consideration, including confidential trade secrets and proprietary
information relating to the identity and special needs of current and
prospective customers of Target or any Target Subsidiary, Target's and any
Target Subsidiary's current and prospective services, Target's and any Target
Subsidiary's business projections and market studies, Target's and any Target
Subsidiary's business plans and strategies, Target's and any Target
Subsidiary's studies and information concerning special services unique to
Target or any Target Subsidiary. Director further acknowledges and agrees that
this consideration constitutes fair and adequate consideration for the execution of the non-solicitation and non-competition
restrictions set forth below. Accordingly, other than in any capacity for or
on behalf of Parent or any subsidiary of Parent, Director agrees that Director
will not, directly or indirectly, individually or as an employee, partner,
officer, director or shareholder or in any other capacity whatsoever:



i.solicit the business of any person or entity who is a customer of Target or
any Target Subsidiary as of the date of this Agreement or as of the Closing
Date on behalf of any other insured depository institution for the purpose of
providing financial services to such person or entity;



ii.(A) acquire any interest in (directly or indirectly), charter, operate or
enter into any franchise or other management agreement with any insured
depository institution that has a location within a 35 mile radius of any
location of Target or any Target Subsidiary (the "Noncompete Area") (but
notwithstanding the foregoing, Director may (1) retain any existing ownership
interest in any insured depository institution or its holding company as
disclosed on Schedule 1 attached hereto, (2) acquire additional ownership
interest in any insured depository institution or its holding company listed
on Schedule 1 attached hereto, (3) acquire an ownership interest in any
publicly-traded depository institution or its holding company, so long as that
ownership interest does not exceed 3% of the total number of shares
outstanding of that depository institution, and (4) invest in an existing
mutual fund that invests, directly or indirectly, in such insured depository
institutions or their holding companies),



(A)serve as an officer, director, employee, agent or consultant to any insured
depository institution or holding company for an insured depository
institution that has a location within the Noncompete Area, except for any
such positions which Director already holds at the time of this Agreement and
are set forth on Schedule 2 attached hereto; or



(B)establish or operate a branch or other office of an insured depository
institution within the Noncompete Area; or



iii.recruit, hire, assist others in recruiting or hiring, discuss employment
with, or refer others concerning employment, any person who is, or within the
12 months preceding the Closing Date was, an employee of Target or any Target
Subsidiary; but nothing in this Section 2(a)(iii) applies to employment other
than in financial services.

 Director may not avoid the purpose and intent of this Section 2(a) by engaging
in conduct within the Noncompete Area from a remote location through means
such as telecommunications, written correspondence, computer generated or
assisted communications, or other similar methods.



(b)If any court of competent jurisdiction should determine that the terms of
this Section 2 or Section 4 are too broad in terms of time, geographic area,
lines of commerce or otherwise, that court is to modify and revise any such
terms so that they comply with applicable law.



(c)Director agrees that (i) this Agreement is entered into in connection with
the sale to Parent of the goodwill of the business of Sovereign Bank ("Target
Bank"), a Texas banking association and wholly-owned subsidiary of Target,
(ii) Director is receiving valuable consideration for this Agreement, (iii)
the restrictions imposed upon Director by this Agreement are essential and
necessary to ensure Parent acquires the goodwill of Target Bank, and (iv) all
the restrictions (including particularly the time and geographical
limitations) set forth in this Agreement are fair and reasonable.



3.Early Resolution Conference. This Agreement is understood to be clear and
enforceable as written and is executed by both parties on that basis. However,
should Director later challenge any provision as unclear, unenforceable, or
inapplicable to any competitive activity that Director intends to engage in,
Director will first notify Parent in writing and meet with a Parent
representative and a neutral mediator (if Parent elects to retain one at its
expense) to discuss resolution of any disputes between the parties. Director
will provide this notice at least twenty-one (21) days before Director engages
in any activity on behalf of a competing business or engages in other activity
that could forseeably fall within a questioned restriction. If Director fails
to comply with this requirement, Director waives his right to challenge the
reasonable scope, clarity, applicability or enforceability of this Agreement
and its restrictions at a later time.



4.Termination. This Agreement and all obligations hereunder will terminate on
the earlier of (a) the date the Reorganization Agreement is terminated
pursuant to Section 8.01 of the Reorganization Agreement or (b) the date that
is twenty-four (24) months after the Closing Date.



5.Waiver, Amendment and Modification. Any of the terms or conditions of this
Agreement may be waived at any time by the party that is entitled to the
benefits thereof. This Agreement may be modified or amended at any time, by
action of Parent and the Director. Any waiver, modification or amendment of
this Agreement shall be in writing.



6.Multiple Counterparts. For the convenience of the parties hereto, this
Agreement may be signed in multiple counterparts, each of which will be deemed
an original, and all counterparts hereof so signed by the parties hereto, whether or not
such counterpart will bear the execution of each of the parties hereto, will
be deemed to be, and is to be construed as, one and the same Agreement. A
telecopy, facsimile or electronic scan in "PDF" format of a signed counterpart
of this Agreement will be sufficient to bind the party or parties whose
signature(s) appear thereon.



7.Governing Law. THIS AGREEMENT IS TO BE CONSTRUED IN ACCORDANCE WITH AND
GOVERNED BY THE LAWS OF THE STATE OF TEXAS, WITHOUT REGARD FOR THE PROVISIONS
THEREOF REGARDING CHOICE OF LAW. VENUE FOR ANY CAUSE OF ACTION BETWEEN THE
PARTIES TO THIS AGREEMENT WILL LIE IN DALLAS COUNTY, TEXAS.



8.Binding Effect; Assignment. All of the terms, covenants, representations,
warranties and conditions of this Agreement are binding upon, and inure to the
benefit of and are enforceable by, the parties and their respective
successors, representatives and permitted assigns. Nothing expressed or
referred to herein is intended or is to be construed to give any person other
than the parties hereto any legal or equitable right, remedy or claim under or
in respect of this Agreement, it being the intent of the parties that this
Agreement, and the terms hereof are for the sole benefit of the parties to
this Agreement and not for the benefit of any other person. No party to this
Agreement will assign this Agreement, by operation of law or otherwise, in
whole or in part, without the prior written consent of the other parties, and
any assignment made or attempted in violation of this Section is void and of
no effect.



9.Severability. If any provision of this Agreement is held to be illegal,
invalid or unenforceable under present or future laws, then (a) this Agreement
is to be construed and enforced as if such illegal, invalid or unenforceable
provision were not a part hereof; (b) the remaining provisions of this
Agreement will remain in full force and effect and will not be affected by
such illegal, invalid or unenforceable provision or by its severance from this
Agreement; and (c) there will be added automatically as a part of this
Agreement a provision mutually agreed to which is similar in terms to such
illegal, invalid or unenforceable provision as may be possible and still be
legal, valid and enforceable.



10.Specific Performance. Each of the parties hereto acknowledges that the
other parties would be irreparably damaged and would not have an adequate
remedy at law for money damages if any of the covenants contained in this
Agreement were not performed in accordance with its terms or otherwise were
materially breached. Each of the parties hereto therefore agrees that, without
the necessity of proving actual damages or posting bond or other security, the
other party will be entitled to temporary and/or permanent injunction or
injunctions which a court of competent jurisdiction concludes is justified to
prevent breaches of such performance and to specific enforcement of such
covenants in addition to any other remedy to which they may be entitled, at
law or in equity. 

11.Entire Agreement. This Agreement and the other agreements, documents,
schedules and instruments signed and delivered by the parties to each other at
the Closing are the full understanding of the parties, a complete allocation
of risks between them and a complete and exclusive statement of the terms and
conditions of their agreement relating to the subject matter hereof and
supersede any and all prior agreements, whether written or oral, that may
exist between the parties with respect thereto. Except as otherwise
specifically provided in this Agreement, no conditions, usage of trade, course
of dealing or performance, understanding or agreement purporting to modify,
vary, explain or supplement the terms or conditions of this Agreement is
binding unless hereafter made in writing and signed by the party to be bound,
and no modification will be effected by the acknowledgment or acceptance of
documents containing terms or conditions at variance with or in addition to
those set forth in this Agreement.

requires or as is otherwise appropriate. The word "or" is used in the
inclusive sense. Any agreement or instrument defined or referred to herein or

9.The Releasing Parties hereby acknowledge and agree that the failure of any
Releasing Party to perform its agreements and covenants hereunder, including
its failure to take all required actions on its part necessary to consummate
the transactions contemplated hereby, will cause irreparable injury to the
Released Parties for which damages, even if available, will not be an adequate
remedy. Accordingly, each of the Releasing Parties hereby consents to the
issuance of injunctive relief by any court of competent jurisdiction to compel
performance of such Releasing Party's obligations and to the granting by any court of the remedy of specific
performance of its obligations hereunder without the necessity of posting
