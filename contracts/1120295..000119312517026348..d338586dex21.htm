Time shall be amended and restated to be the articles of incorporation of

foregoing:

 

(a) _Capital Stock of Merger Sub_. Each share of common stock of
Merger Sub, without par value, issued and outstanding immediately prior to
the Effective Time shall be converted into and become one (1) validly issued,
fully paid, and nonassessable share of common stock of the Surviving
Corporation, without par value.

(b) _Cancellation of Parent-Owned Company Common Stock_. Each issued
and outstanding share of Company Common Stock that is owned by Parent or
Merger Sub, or by any Subsidiary of Parent or Merger Sub, or the Company,
immediately prior to the Effective Time (except to the extent held by any such
Person on behalf of a third party) (collectively, the " _Excluded Shares_ "),
shall automatically be cancelled and shall cease to exist, and no cash, stock,
or other consideration shall be delivered or deliverable in exchange therefor.

 

(c) _Conversion of Company Common Stock_. Each share of Company
Common Stock issued and outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time
(other than Excluded Shares and

 



14  Dissenting Shares) shall automatically be cancelled and converted into the
right to receive cash in an amount, without interest, equal to $19.65 (the "
_Per Share Merger Consideration_ "). As of the Effective Time, all such
shares of Company Common Stock shall no longer be outstanding and shall
automatically be cancelled and shall cease to exist, and each holder of a
certificate representing any such shares (a " _Certificate_ ") or book-entry
shares (" _Book-Entry Shares_ ") (other than Excluded Shares and Dissenting
Shares) shall cease to have any rights with respect to such shares, except, in
all cases, the right to receive the Per Share Merger Consideration, without
interest, in accordance with Section 2.08. The right of any holder of any
share of Company Common Stock to receive the Per Share Merger Consideration
shall be subject to and reduced by the amount of any withholding that is
required under applicable Tax Law.

requisite action so that:

(i) _Treatment of Company Stock Options_. Each option (or portion
thereof) to purchase shares of Company Common Stock under the Company Equity
Plan (" _Company Stock Option_ "), whether vested or unvested, that is
outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time shall, at the Effective
Time, automatically and without any required action on the part of Parent,
Merger Sub, the Company or any holder thereof or any other Person, become
fully vested and be cancelled in consideration for the right to receive a cash
payment with respect thereto equal to the product of (A) the total number of
shares of Company Common Stock subject to such cancelled Company Stock Option
immediately prior to the Effective Time and (B) the excess, if any, of (1) the
Per Share Merger Consideration over (2) the exercise price per share subject
to such cancelled Company Stock Option, without interest (such amounts payable
hereunder, the " _Option Payments_ "); _provided_ , _however_ , that (x) any
such Company Stock Option with respect to which the exercise price per share
subject thereto is equal to or greater than the Per Share Merger Consideration
shall be cancelled in exchange for no consideration and (y) such
Option Payments may be reduced by the amount of any required Tax withholdings
as provided in Section 2.08(h). The Surviving Corporation shall cause each
Option Payment to be paid, less any required Tax withholdings, as promptly as
practicable following the Effective Time (and not later than the first
regularly scheduled payroll date on or after the fifth Business Day after the
Effective Time) through its payroll systems. From and after the Effective
Time, no Company Stock Option shall be outstanding, and each Company Stock
Option shall only entitle the holder thereof to the payment provided for in
this Section 2.07(d)(i).

 

(ii) _Treatment of Company RSUs_. Each restricted stock unit
award granted pursuant to the Company Equity Plan, whether vested or
unvested, that is outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time ("
_Company RSU_ ") shall, at the Effective Time, automatically and without any
required action on the part of Parent, Merger Sub, the Company or any holder
thereof or any other Person, become fully vested and be cancelled in
consideration for the right to receive, following the Effective Time, a cash
payment with respect thereto equal to the product of (A) the total number of
shares of Company Common Stock subject to such Company RSU immediately prior
to the Effective Time and (B) the Per Share Merger Consideration, without
interest (such amounts payable hereunder, the " _Company RSU Payments_ ");
_provided_ , _however_ , that such Company RSU Payments may be reduced by the
amount of any required Tax withholdings as provided in Section 2.08(h). For
purposes of clarification, if, immediately prior to the Effective Time, a
Company RSU remains subject to a performance-based vesting condition, such
Company RSU shall, at such time and in accordance

 



15  with the terms thereof, become earned at the target performance level, and
such Company RSU shall, at the Effective Time, become fully vested and be
cancelled in the same manner as described in the preceding sentence. The
Surviving Corporation shall cause each Company RSU Payment to be paid, less
any required Tax withholdings, as promptly as practicable following the
Effective Time (and not later than the first regularly scheduled payroll date
on or after the fifth Business Day after the Effective Time) through its
payroll systems. From and after the Effective Time, no Company RSU shall be
outstanding, and each Company RSU shall only entitle the holder thereof to the
payment provided for in this Section 2.07(d)(ii).

(iii) _Treatment of Company ESPP_. As soon as practicable following the
date of this Agreement, the Company shall take any actions, and the Board of
Directors of the Company and/or the Compensation Committee thereof, as
applicable, shall adopt any resolutions and take any actions, that
are necessary to provide that with respect to the Company 2010 Employee Stock
Purchase Plan, as amended (the " _Company ESPP_ "): (A) participants in the
Company ESPP may not alter their payroll deductions from those in effect on
the date of this Agreement (other than to discontinue their participation in
the Company ESPP) and no new participants may begin participating in the
current offering period, (B) no offering period will be commenced after the
date of this Agreement (it being understood that any offering period in
effect on the date hereof may continue in accordance with its terms), (C) any
offering period that is in effect as of the date of this Agreement shall be
terminated effective as of the last day of the purchase period that is in
effect as of the date of this Agreement or, if earlier, prior to the Effective
Time, and all amounts then credited to the accounts of participants shall be
used to purchase shares of Company Common Stock in accordance with the terms
of the Company ESPP, (D) the amount of the accumulated contributions of each
participant under the Company ESPP as of the termination of the Company ESPP
shall, to the extent not used to purchase shares of Company Common Stock
in accordance with the Company ESPP, be refunded to such participant as
promptly as practicable following the Effective Time (without interest and
less any required Tax withholdings), and (E) the Company ESPP shall be
terminated as of the Effective Time. To the extent such accumulated
contributions are used to purchase shares of Company Common Stock, the
purchased shares shall be converted into the right to receive the Per Share
Merger Consideration pursuant to Section 2.07(c).

 

(iv) At or prior to the Effective Time, the Company shall take any
actions, and the Board of Directors of the Company and/or the Compensation
Committee thereof, as applicable, shall adopt any resolutions and take any
actions, that are necessary to (A) effectuate the treatment of the Company
Stock Options and the Company RSUs (collectively, the " _Company Equity
Awards_ ") and the Company ESPP as provided in this Section 2.07(d) and (B)
cause the Company Equity Plan and the Company ESPP to terminate at or prior to
the Effective Time, it being understood and agreed that from and after the
Effective Time, no Company Equity Award holder shall have any right with
respect to any Company Equity Award or otherwise under any Company Equity
Plan, and no participant in the Company ESPP shall have any rights with
respect to the Company ESPP, in each case other than to receive the payment
provided for in this Section 2.07(d).

 

(e) _Anti-Dilution_. Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to
the contrary, if, from the date of this Agreement until the Effective Time,
the number of outstanding shares of Company Common Stock shall have been
changed into a different number of shares or a 

 



16  different class by reason of any reclassification, stock split (including a
reverse stock split), recapitalization, business combination, tender or
exchange offer, readjustment or other similar transaction, or a stock
dividend or stock distribution thereon shall be declared with a record date
within such period, the Per Share Merger Consideration shall be appropriately
adjusted to provide the holders of shares of Company Common Stock the same
economic effect as contemplated by this Agreement prior to such event;
_provided_ , _however_ , that (i) in no event shall the aggregate amount
payable by Parent pursuant to Section 2.08 after giving effect to any such
event exceed the amount that would have been payable pursuant to Section 2.08
had such event not occurred and (ii) nothing in this Section 2.07 shall permit
the Company to take any action with respect to its securities that is
prohibited by the terms of this Agreement.

Section 2.08. Disposition of Certificates and Book-Entry Shares.

(a) _Paying Agent_. Prior to the Effective Time, Parent shall
appoint a U.S.-based nationally recognized bank or trust company, which shall
be reasonably acceptable to the Company, to act as paying agent (the " _Paying
Agent_ ") for the payment of the Per Share Merger Consideration to the
holders of the shares of Company Common Stock as provided in Section 2.07(c).
Parent will enter into a paying agent agreement with the Paying Agent (the "
_Paying Agent Agreement_ ") on terms reasonably acceptable to Parent and the
Company prior to the Closing. At the Closing, Parent shall deposit with the
Paying Agent cash in immediately available funds in the amount necessary for
payment of the aggregate Per Share Merger Consideration in accordance with
Section 2.07(c) and this Section 2.08 (such total deposited cash being
hereinafter referred to as the " _Payment Fund_ "). The Paying Agent shall
make payments of the Per Share Merger Consideration out of the Payment Fund
in accordance with this Agreement and the Paying Agent Agreement. The Payment
Fund shall not be used for any other purpose. As soon as reasonably
practicable but no later than the first regularly scheduled payroll date on or
after the fifth Business Day after the Effective Time, Parent shall pay or
cause to be paid to the Surviving Corporation in cash the amounts payable in
respect of the Company Stock Options pursuant to Section 2.07(d)(i) and the
Company RSUs pursuant to Section 2.07(d)(ii), and the Surviving Corporation
shall disburse such amounts in accordance with Section 2.07(d)(i) and Section
2.07(d)(ii), respectively, to the extent the Surviving Corporation does not
have the cash on hand to pay such amounts. 

(b) _Stock Transfer Books_. At the Effective Time, the stock
transfer books of the Company shall be closed and thereafter there shall be no
further registration of transfers of shares of Company Common Stock on the
records of the Company. From and after the Effective Time, the holders of
Certificates and Book-Entry Shares representing ownership of shares of
Company Common Stock outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time shall
cease to have rights with respect to such shares except as otherwise provided
for herein. From and after the Effective Time, any Certificates or Book-Entry
Shares presented to the Paying Agent, Parent, or the Surviving Corporation for
any reason (other than Certificates or Book-Entry Shares representing Excluded
Shares) shall be cancelled and exchanged for the Per Share Merger
Consideration.

 



17 (c) _Payment Procedures_.

(i) As soon as practicable after the Effective Time (and in any event
within three (3) Business Days thereafter), Parent and the Surviving
Corporation shall cause the Paying Agent to mail to each holder of record of a
Certificate or Certificates that immediately prior to the Effective Time
represented outstanding shares of Company Common Stock (other than Excluded
Shares and Dissenting Shares) (A) a letter of transmittal (which shall specify
that delivery shall be effected, and risk of loss and title to the
Certificates shall pass to the Paying Agent, only upon delivery of the
Certificates (or affidavits of loss in lieu thereof) to the Paying Agent, and
which letter shall be in such form and have such other provisions as Parent
and the Company may reasonably agree) and (B) instructions for use in
effecting the surrender of the Certificates (or affidavits of loss in lieu
thereof) in exchange for the Per Share Merger Consideration. Upon surrender of
any Certificate (or affidavit of loss in lieu thereof) to the Paying Agent,
together with such letter of transmittal, duly executed and completed in
accordance with the instructions thereto, and such other documents as may be
reasonably required by Parent or the Paying Agent, the holder of such
Certificate shall be entitled to receive in exchange therefor an amount of
cash in immediately available funds equal to (1) the number of shares of
Company Common Stock represented by such Certificate (or affidavits of loss in
lieu thereof) multiplied by (2) the Per Share Merger Consideration (less any
required Tax withholdings as provided in Section 2.08(h)), and the Certificate
so surrendered shall forthwith be cancelled. In the event of a transfer of
ownership of shares of Company Common Stock that is not registered in the
transfer records of the Company, payment may be made to a Person other than
the Person in whose name the Certificate so surrendered is registered if such
Certificate shall be properly endorsed or otherwise be in proper form for
transfer and the Person requesting such payment shall pay any transfer or
other Taxes required by reason of the payment to a Person other than the
registered holder of such Certificate or establish to the satisfaction of
Parent that such Tax has been paid or is not applicable. No interest shall be
paid or accrue on any cash payable pursuant to this Section 2.08.

 

(ii) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement, any
holder of Book-Entry Shares shall not be required to deliver a Certificate or
an executed letter of transmittal to the Paying Agent to receive the Per Share
Merger Consideration that such holder is entitled to receive pursuant to this
Article 2. In lieu thereof, each holder of record of one or more Book-Entry
Shares whose shares were converted into the right to receive the Per Share
Merger Consideration shall upon receipt by the Paying Agent of an "agents
message" in customary form (or such other documentation or evidence, if any,
as Parent or the Paying Agent may reasonably request), be entitled to receive,
and Parent shall cause the Paying Agent to pay and deliver as promptly as
reasonably practicable after the Effective Time, the Per Share Merger
Consideration in respect of each such share of Company Common Stock (less any
required Tax withholdings as provided in Section 2.08(h)), and the Book-Entry
Shares of such holder shall forthwith be cancelled.

 

(d) _Termination of Payment Fund_. Any portion of the Payment Fund
which remains unclaimed for nine (9) months after the Effective Time shall be
delivered to the Surviving Corporation, and any holders of shares of Company
Common Stock prior to the Effective Time who have not theretofore complied
with this Article 2 shall thereafter look only to the Surviving Corporation
for, and the Surviving Corporation shall remain liable for, payment of the Per
Share Merger Consideration (subject to abandoned property, escheat, or similar
Laws).

 



18 (e) _No Liability_. None of Parent, Merger Sub, the Surviving
Corporation, the Company or, the Paying Agent, or any employee, officer,
director, agent, representative or, Affiliate thereof, shall be liable to any
Person in respect of the Per Share Merger Consideration from the Payment Fund
properly delivered to a public official pursuant to any applicable abandoned
property, escheat, or similar Law.

 

(f) _Investment of Payment Fund_. The Paying Agent shall invest the
Payment Fund as directed by Parent (on behalf of the Surviving Corporation);
_provided_ , that such investments shall be in obligations of or guaranteed by
the United States of America, in commercial paper obligations rated A-1 or P-1
or better by Moodys Investors Service, Inc. or Standard and Poors Corporation,
respectively, in certificates of deposit, bank repurchase agreements or
bankers acceptances of commercial banks with capital exceeding $25 billion,
or in funds investing solely in such obligations that provide for same day
liquidity. Any net profit resulting from, or interest or income produced by,
such investments shall be paid to the Surviving Corporation or Parent (at
Parents election). To the extent that there are losses with respect to such
investments, or the Payment Fund diminishes for other reasons below the level
required to make prompt cash payments of the aggregate Per Share Merger
Consideration as contemplated hereby, Parent shall promptly replace or restore
the portion of the Payment Fund required so as to ensure that the Payment Fund
is, at all times, maintained at a level sufficient to make such payments.

(g) _Lost Certificates_. If any Certificate shall have been lost,
stolen, or destroyed, upon the making of an affidavit of that fact by the
Person claiming such Certificate to be lost, stolen, or destroyed, and, if
required by Parent or the Paying Agent, the posting by such Person of a bond
in such reasonable and customary amount as Parent or the Paying Agent may
direct as indemnity against any claim that may be made against it or the
Surviving Corporation or any of their Affiliates with respect to such
Certificate, the Paying Agent will issue in exchange for such lost, stolen, or
destroyed Certificate the Per Share Merger Consideration payable in respect
thereof, pursuant to this Agreement.

 

(h) _Withholding Rights_. Parent, the Surviving Corporation, or the
Paying Agent, as applicable, shall be entitled to deduct and withhold from the
consideration otherwise payable pursuant to this Agreement to any Person such
amounts as it is required to deduct and withhold with respect to the making of
such payment under the Code and the rules and regulations promulgated
thereunder, or any provision of state, local, or foreign Tax Law. To the
extent that amounts are so withheld, such withheld amounts shall be treated
for all purposes of this Agreement as having been paid to the Person in
respect of which such deduction and withholding was made.

 

(i) _Dissenters_ __ _Rights_. Notwithstanding anything in this
Agreement to the contrary, shares of Company Common Stock, if any, as to which
the holder thereof shall have (i) properly demanded that the Company purchase
such shares of Company Common Stock for fair market value in accordance with,
and otherwise complied with, the provisions of Chapter 13 of the CGCL ("
_Chapter 13_ "), and (ii) not effectively withdrawn or lost such holders
rights to demand purchase for such shares of Company Common Stock for fair
market value pursuant to Chapter 13 (each, a " _Dissenting Share_ "), shall
not be converted into the right to receive the Per Share Merger Consideration
payable pursuant to Section 2.07(c), but instead at the Effective Time shall
become entitled only to payment from the Surviving Corporation of the fair
value of such shares

 



19  of Company Common Stock determined in accordance with Chapter 13 (it being
understood and acknowledged that at the Effective Time, such Dissenting Shares
shall no longer be outstanding, shall automatically be cancelled, and shall
cease to exist, and such holder shall cease to have any rights with respect
thereto other than the right to receive the fair value of such Dissenting
Shares as determined in accordance with Chapter 13);  _provided_ , _however_
, that if any such holder shall fail to perfect or otherwise shall waive,
withdraw, or lose the right to payment of the fair value of such Dissenting
Shares under Chapter 13, then the right of such holder to be paid the fair
value of such holders Dissenting Shares shall cease, and such Dissenting
Shares shall be deemed to have been converted as of the Effective Time into,
and to have become exchangeable solely for the right to receive, without
interest or duplication, the Per Share Merger Consideration. The Company
shall give Parent prompt notice of any demands received by the Company
pursuant to Chapter 13, attempted withdrawals of such demands and any other
instruments served pursuant to the CGCL and received by the Company relating
to rights to be paid the fair market value of Dissenting Shares, and Parent
shall have the right to participate in and control all negotiations and
Actions with respect to such demands. Prior to the Effective Time, the
Company shall not, without the prior written consent of Parent, make any
payment with respect to, or settle or compromise or offer to settle or
compromise, any such demand, or agree to do any of the foregoing. Any portion
of the aggregate Per Share Merger Consideration paid to the Paying Agent to
pay for shares that have become Dissenting Shares shall be returned to Parent
upon demand, but solely with respect to Dissenting Shares that (A) the
Surviving Corporation has become obligated to purchase for fair market value
in accordance with the provisions of Chapter 13 pursuant to an Order of a
Governmental Authority or (B) the Surviving Company has agreed with the
holders of such Dissenting Shares to settle such demand to purchase such
Dissenting Shares pursuant to an agreement between such parties.

33  otherwise reasonably be expected to have an adverse effect on the Tax status
of any such International Employee Plan, and (vii) no contribution holidays

Section 5.02. Acquisition Proposals _._

 

(a) From the execution of this Agreement until the earlier to

its terms and (y) the Effective Time, except as expressly permitted by Section
5.02(b), the Company shall not, and shall cause its Subsidiaries and its and
their respective directors, officers and employees not to, and the Company
shall use its reasonable best efforts to cause its and its Subsidiaries other
Representatives not to, directly or indirectly, (i) solicit, initiate,

inquiry, expression of interest, proposal, offer or request for information
that would reasonably be expected to lead to or result in an Acquisition
Proposal, or the making or consummation thereof, (ii) other than to inform
any Person of the existence of the provisions contained in this Section 5.02,
enter into, continue, or otherwise participate in any discussions or
negotiations regarding, or furnish to any Person any information in

understanding with respect to, any Acquisition Proposal or any inquiry,

result in an Acquisition Proposal and (D) enforce, and not waive or modify,
the provisions of any existing confidentiality or non-disclosure agreement
entered into with respect to any Acquisition Proposal or any potential
Acquisition Proposal, including any standstill provisions contained therein (
_provided_ that, in the case of clause (D), if the Board of Directors of the
Company determines in good faith, after consultation with its outside legal
counsel, that the failure to take such action would be inconsistent with the
Board of Directors fiduciary duties to the shareholders of the Company under
applicable Law, the Company may waive any such standstill provision solely to
the extent necessary to permit a third party to make, on a confidential basis
to the Board of Directors of the Company, an Acquisition Proposal, conditioned
upon such third party agreeing that the Company shall not be prohibited from
providing any information to Parent (including regarding any such Acquisition
Proposal) in accordance with, and otherwise complying with, this Section
5.02). It is agreed that (1) any violation of the restrictions set forth in
this Section 5.02(a) by any officer, director or employee of the Company or

Company and (2) any inquiry, expression of interest, proposal, offer or
request that results from any violation of the foregoing restrictions by any
Representative of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries (other than such
Representatives included in the foregoing clause (1)) shall be deemed to be

from its obligation to comply with the standstill provisions contained in its
Confidentiality Agreement from and after the date hereof.

 

(b) Notwithstanding the foregoing, at any time prior to obtaining the
Company Shareholder Approval, in response to a bona fide written Acquisition
Proposal (which Acquisition Proposal was made after the date of this Agreement
and did not result from a breach of or deemed non-compliance with
Section 5.02(a)) that the Board of Directors of the Company determines in
good faith (after consultation with its financial advisor and outside legal
counsel) constitutes or would reasonably be expected to lead to a Superior
Proposal, the Company shall give Parent written notice of such determination
promptly after the Board of Directors of the Company makes such determination
(and in no event later than twenty-four (24) hours after such determination)
and, after the delivery of such written notice, the Company and its
Representatives may (i) furnish information with respect to the Company and
its Subsidiaries to the Person making such Acquisition Proposal (and its
Representatives) pursuant to a customary confidentiality agreement containing
terms no less favorable to the disclosing party than those set forth in the
Confidentiality Agreement (excluding any standstill agreement contained
therein) (an " _Acceptable Confidentiality Agreement_ "); _provided_ , that
all such information (to the extent that such information has not been
previously provided or made available to Parent) is provided or made available
to Parent prior to or substantially concurrently with the time it is provided
or made available to such Person and (ii) participate in discussions or
negotiations with the Person making such Acquisition Proposal (and its
Representatives) regarding such Acquisition Proposal.

 

(c) The Company shall notify Parent promptly (but in no event later than
twenty four (24) hours) after receipt by the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries (or any of its or their Representatives) of any Acquisition
Proposal, any inquiry that would be reasonably expected to lead to an
Acquisition Proposal or of any request for information relating to the
Company or any

 



48  of its Subsidiaries or for access to the business, properties, assets,
books, or records of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries by any Person that
to the knowledge of the Company may be considering making, or has made, an
Acquisition Proposal, which notice shall be provided orally and in writing and
shall provide the material terms and conditions of, any such Acquisition
Proposal, indication, or request (including the identity of the Person making
any such Acquisition Proposal, indication or request, and copies of any
related documentation, including any related financing commitments).
Thereafter, the Company shall keep Parent promptly informed in writing on a
reasonably current basis of the status of, and any material changes to, the
terms of any such Acquisition Proposal (including providing Parent a
notification in writing within twenty-four (24) hours following any
determination by the Board of Directors of the Company pursuant to Section
5.02(b) or any material changes to the terms of any such Acquisition Proposal)
and any discussions and negotiations concerning the material terms and
conditions thereof.

 

(d) Except as otherwise provided in Section 5.02(e) and Section 5.02(f),
the Board of Directors of the Company (or any committee thereof) shall not
(i) (A) withdraw or publicly propose to withdraw, or modify or qualify (or
public propose to modify or qualify) in any manner adverse to Parent, the
Company Board Recommendation, (B) fail to include the Company Board
Recommendation in the Proxy Statement, (C) if a tender offer or exchange offer
that constitutes an Acquisition Proposal shall have been commenced by a person

give to its shareholders, pursuant to Rule 14e-2 under the Exchange Act,
within the ten Business day period after such tender offer or exchange offer
is first published, sent or given, or subsequently amended in any material
respect or withdraw, a statement recommending that shareholders reject such
tender offer or exchange offer and affirm the Company Board Recommendation, or
(D) approve, adopt or recommend any Acquisition Proposal, or propose publicly
to approve, adopt or recommend, any Acquisition Proposal (any action in this
clause (i), a " _Company Adverse Recommendation Change_ ") or (ii) approve,
adopt or recommend, or propose publicly to approve, adopt or recommend, or
allow the Company or any of its Subsidiaries to execute or enter into any
Contract or other agreement or understanding (written or oral, binding or non-
binding, preliminary or definitive), other than an Acceptable Confidentiality
Agreement to the extent expressly permitted by Section 5.02(b), with any
Person constituting or relating to, or that is intended to or would reasonably
be expected to lead to or result in, any Acquisition Proposal, or requiring,
or reasonably expected to cause, the Company to abandon, terminate, delay or
fail to consummate, or that would otherwise impede, interfere with or be
inconsistent with this Agreement, the Merger or any of the other transactions
contemplated hereby, or requiring, or reasonably expected to cause, the
Company to fail to comply with this Agreement (any such document, agreement or
arrangement, an " _Alternative Acquisition Agreement_ ").

(e) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement, if at
any time prior to obtaining the Company Shareholder Approval an Intervening
Event has occurred, the Board of Directors of the Company may make a Company
Adverse Recommendation Change if and only if it concludes in good faith,
after consultation with its financial advisor and outside legal counsel, that
the failure to take such action would be inconsistent with the Board of
Directors fiduciary duties to the shareholders of the Company under
applicable Law;  _provided_ , that the Board of Directors of the Company
shall not be entitled to make a Company Adverse Recommendation Change (under
clauses (A) or (B) of the definition thereof) pursuant to this 

 



49  Section 5.02(e) unless (i) the Company shall have provided Parent at least
five (5) Business Days prior written notice advising Parent that it intends
to take such action, which notice shall (A) state that an Intervening Event
has occurred, and (B) specify the material facts and circumstances (based on
information reasonably available) related to such Intervening Event, (ii) if
requested by Parent, the Company and its Representatives shall have
negotiated in good faith during such five (5) Business Day period following
delivery of such written notice with Parent concerning any revisions to the
terms of this Agreement that Parent proposes in response to such Intervening
Event and (iii) after complying with clauses (i) and (ii) of this Section
5.02(e), the Board of Directors shall have determined in good faith, after
consultation with its outside legal counsel and financial advisor, that the
failure to make a Company Adverse Recommendation Change would be inconsistent
with the Board of Directors fiduciary duties to the shareholders of the
Company under applicable Law, after giving due consideration to any
changes proposed to be made to this Agreement by Parent in writing.

(f) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement, if at
any time prior to obtaining the Company Shareholder Approval, a written bona
fide Acquisition Proposal that is first made after the date hereof and did not
result from a breach of this Section 5.02 is made, and the Board of Directors
of the Company concludes in good faith, after consultation with its financial
advisor and outside legal counsel, that such Acquisition Proposal constitutes
a Superior Proposal and the failure to approve or recommend such Superior
Proposal would be inconsistent with the Board of Directors fiduciary duties
to the shareholders of the Company under applicable Law, the Board of
Directors of the Company may make a Company Adverse Recommendation Change
and/or the Company may terminate this Agreement in accordance with this
Section 5.02(f) and Section 7.01(e), _provided_ , _however_ , that the Company
shall not terminate this Agreement pursuant to this Section 5.02(f) or
Section 7.01(e) unless the Company (i) has complied with and not breached its
obligations under this Section 5.02, including its obligations set forth in
Section 5.02(g), (ii) pays, or causes to be paid, to Parent the
Company Termination Fee prior to or concurrently with such termination and

of Directors shall not make a Company Adverse Recommendation Change pursuant
to Section 5.02(f) and the Company shall not be entitled to terminate this
Agreement pursuant to Section 5.02(f) or Section 7.01(e) unless (i) the
Company shall have provided Parent at least five (5) Business Days prior
written notice advising Parent that it intends to take such action, which
notice shall (A) state that the Company has received a Superior Proposal, (B)
specify the material terms and conditions of such Superior Proposal,
including the identity of the Person making such Superior Proposal, and (C)
enclose the most recent draft of any agreements intended to be entered into
with the Person making or providing such Superior Proposal (or any Affiliate
of such Person), (ii) if requested by Parent, the Company and its
Representatives shall have negotiated in good faith during such five (5)
Business Day period following delivery of such written notice with Parent
concerning any revisions to the terms of this Agreement that Parent proposes
in response to such Superior Proposal and (iii) after complying with clauses
(i) and (ii) of this Section 5.02(g), the Board of Directors shall
have determined in good faith, after consultation with its outside legal
counsel and financial advisor, that such Acquisition Proposal continues to
constitute a Superior Proposal, after giving due consideration to any
changes 

 



50  proposed to be made to this Agreement by Parent in a writing. The parties
acknowledge and agree that, (A) if Parent, within five (5) Business Days
following its receipt of the written notice referred to in this Section
5.02(g), makes a proposal that, as determined in good faith by the Board of
Directors of the Company (after consultation with its outside counsel and
financial advisor), results in the applicable Acquisition Proposal no longer
being a Superior Proposal, then the Board of Directors shall have no right to
make a Company Adverse Recommendation Change pursuant to Section 5.02(f) and
the Company shall have no right to terminate this Agreement pursuant
to Section 5.02(f) or Section 7.01(e) as a result of such Acquisition
Proposal, and (B) any (x) revisions to the financial terms or any other
material terms of a Superior Proposal or (y) revisions to the financial terms
or any other material terms to an Acquisition Proposal that the Board of
Directors of the Company had determined no longer constitutes a Superior
Proposal, shall constitute a new Acquisition Proposal and shall in each case
require the Company to deliver to Parent a new written notice pursuant to
this Section 5.02(g) and a new five (5) Business Day period shall commence
thereafter; _provided_ , _however_ , that such new five (5) Business Day
notice period shall be shortened to three (3) Business Days if the only
change to the material terms of such Superior Proposal is an increase in
(without any change to the form of) the per share merger consideration. The
Board of Directors of the Company shall have no right to make a Company
Adverse Recommendation Change pursuant to Section 5.02(f) and the Company
shall have no right to terminate this Agreement pursuant to Section 5.02(f) or
Section 7.01(e) unless it has complied with the procedures set forth in
Section 5.02(f) and this Section 5.02(g).

(h) Nothing contained in this Section 5.02 shall prohibit the Company
or the Board of Directors of the Company from complying with its disclosure
obligations under applicable Law regarding an Acquisition Proposal, including
(i) taking and disclosing to its shareholders a position contemplated by Rule
14e-2(a), Rule 14d-9 or Item 1012(a) of Regulation M-A under the Exchange Act
or (ii) making any "stop, look and listen" communication to the shareholders
of the Company pursuant to Rule 14d-9(f) under the Exchange Act; _provided_ ,
_however_ , that neither the Company nor the Board of Directors of the
Company may effect a Company Adverse Recommendation Change except in
compliance with this Section 5.02.

respect to (A) a merger, consolidation or other business combination, tender

into account all financial, legal, regulatory and other aspects of the
Acquisition Proposal and the Person making the Acquisition Proposal, (A) is on
terms more favorable to the Companys shareholders from a financial point of
view than the transactions contemplated by this Agreement (after giving
effect to all the proposed changes by

 



51  Parent in accordance with Section 5.02(g)), (B) is reasonably likely to be

shall (with the assistance of Parent) (i) respond as promptly as reasonably
practicable to any comments of the SEC or the staff of the SEC with respect
to the Proxy Statement, including filing any amendments or supplements to the
Proxy Statement as may be required, and (ii) use its reasonable best efforts
to have the Proxy Statement cleared by the SEC as soon as reasonably
practicable after such filing, and (iii) cause the Proxy Statement to be filed
in definitive form and mailed to the Companys shareholders as promptly as
reasonably practicable thereafter. Prior to filing or mailing the Proxy
Statement (or any amendment or supplement thereto) or responding to any
comments of the SEC or the staff of the SEC with respect thereto, the Company
shall provide Parent a reasonable opportunity to review and to
propose comments on such document or response (and the Company shall give
good faith consideration to including any such reasonable comments in the
Proxy Statement (or any supplement or amendment thereto) or response letter).

 

(b) Parent shall use its commercially reasonable efforts to provide to
the Company all information concerning Parent and Merger Sub as may be
reasonably requested by the Company in connection with the Proxy Statement and
shall otherwise assist and cooperate with the Company in the preparation of
the Proxy Statement and resolution of comments of the SEC or its staff
related thereto. Parent will cause the information relating to Parent or
Merger Sub supplied by it in writing expressly for inclusion in the Proxy
Statement, at the time of the filing or mailing of the Proxy Statement or any
amendments or supplements thereto, and at the time of the Shareholders
Meeting, not to contain any untrue statement of a material fact or omit to
state any material fact required to be stated therein or necessary in order to
make the statements therein, in the light of the circumstances under which
they were made, not misleading.

 

(c) In accordance with applicable Law and the Companys Organizational
Documents, the Company shall, as promptly as reasonably practicable, subject

shareholders; _provided_ , _further_ , that the Company may postpone or
adjourn the 

 



52  Shareholders Meeting (for a period of not more than thirty (30) calendar
days, individually or in the aggregate, but not past two (2) Business Days
prior to the End Date) only (A) with the written consent of Parent, (B) for
the absence of a quorum, (C) to allow additional solicitation of votes in
order to obtain the Company Shareholder Approval, or (D) as required by Law.
Once the Company has established a record date for the Shareholders Meeting,
the Company shall not change such record date or establish a different record
date for the Shareholders Meeting without the prior written consent of Parent.
If the record date for the Shareholders Meeting is changed, the Company
shall, as to that record date, comply with each of its obligations under this
Section 5.03. If at any time prior to the Effective Time any event or
circumstance relating to the Company or Parent or any of their respective
Subsidiaries, officers or directors should be discovered by the Company or
Parent which, pursuant to the Securities Act or Exchange Act, is required to
be set forth in an amendment or a supplement to the Proxy Statement so that
the Proxy Statement would not include any misstatement of a material fact or
omit to state any material fact necessary in order to make the statements
therein, in light of the circumstances under which they were made, not
misleading, the Party that discovers such information shall promptly inform
the other Party and the Company shall promptly file an appropriate amendment
or supplement describing such information with the SEC and, to the extent
required by applicable Law, disseminate such amendment or supplement to the
shareholders of the Company. Each of Parent and the Company agree (and Parent
agrees to cause Merger Sub) to promptly correct any information provided by it
for use in the Proxy Statement which shall have become false or misleading.
Each of the Company and Parent shall cause all documents that such Party is
responsible for filing with the SEC in connection with the Merger to comply as
to form in all material respects with the applicable requirements of
the Exchange Act and, as applicable, not to contain any untrue statement of a
material fact or omit to state any material fact required to be stated therein
or necessary in order to make the statements therein, in the light of the
circumstances under which they were made, not misleading.

(d) Unless there has occurred a Company Adverse Recommendation Change in
accordance with Section 5.02(e), the Board of Directors of the Company shall
make the Company Board Recommendation with respect to the approval of this
Agreement, and the Company shall include the Company Board Recommendation in
the Proxy Statement and use its reasonable best efforts to solicit proxies in
favor of the Company Shareholder Approval. Parent and Merger Sub shall vote
all shares of Company Common Stock held by them in favor of the approval

Agreement, unless, in each instance, approved in writing in advance by the
Company, (C) such access shall not require the Company or its Subsidiaries to
allow any environmental testing or sampling, and (D) for the avoidance of
doubt, nothing herein shall require the Company or its Subsidiaries to furnish
to Parent or its Representatives, or provide Parent or its Representatives
with access to, information that legal counsel for the Company
reasonably determines would (1) be subject to an attorney-client or other
legal privilege or (2) violate any applicable Law; _provided_ that the Company
shall give notice to Parent of the fact that it is withholding such
information or documents pursuant to clause (1) or clause (2) above, and
thereafter the Company and Parent shall reasonably cooperate to cause such
information to be provided in a manner that would not reasonably be expected
to waive the applicable privilege or protection or violate the Applicable
Law.

(b) The Company and Parent shall promptly notify the other Party in
writing of (i) any notice or other communication received by such Party or any

failure of any of the conditions set forth in Article 6 to be capable of
being satisfied prior to the End Date; _provided_ , that the failure to
deliver any notice pursuant to this Section 5.04(b)(iii) shall not be
considered in determining whether the conditions set forth in Article 6 have
been satisfied.

(c) Parent acknowledges that the information, notification and access
provided pursuant to this Section 5.04 shall be subject to the terms and
conditions of the Confidentiality and Non-Disclosure Agreement, dated November
28, 2016, by and between the Company and Parent (as supplemented or amended,

remain in full force and effect in accordance with its terms and shall survive
any termination of this Agreement. No investigation pursuant to this Section
5.04 or information or notification provided or received by Parent pursuant to
this Agreement will affect any of the representations or warranties of the
Parties contained in this Agreement (or the Disclosure Letter) or prejudice
the rights and remedies of Parent or Merger Sub hereunder.

 

Section 5.05. Reasonable Best Efforts.

 

(a) Upon the terms and subject to the conditions of this Agreement,

other transactions contemplated by this Agreement, (ii) obtain from any
Governmental Authority any consent, approval, authorization, waiver, or order
required to be obtained or made by any Party or any of their respective

conditions to the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, and (iii) make
all necessary filings, and thereafter make any other required submissions,
with respect to this Agreement required under applicable Law, including the

of this Agreement, Parent and the Company shall, and shall cause their
respective Affiliates to, cooperate with each other in connection with
obtaining all such consents, approvals, authorizations, waivers, or orders and
the making of all such filings, including, unless prohibited by applicable Law
or a Governmental Authority, providing copies of all relevant documents to
outside counsel for the non-filing Party prior to filing and, if reasonably
requested, considering in good faith all reasonable additions, deletions, or
changes suggested in connection therewith. Subject to Section 5.04 above and
the terms of the Confidentiality Agreement, Parent and the Company shall, and
shall cause their respective Affiliates to, promptly furnish to each other all
information reasonably required for any application or other filing to be
made by the other with any Governmental Authority in connection with the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement.

 

(b) Parent and the Company agree to make (i) an appropriate filing of
a Notification and Report Form pursuant to the HSR Act with respect to the
transactions contemplated hereby as promptly as practicable and in any event
within twelve (12) Business Days after the date of this Agreement, and (ii)
appropriate filings, if any are required, pursuant to foreign Antitrust Laws
as promptly as practicable. Parent and the Company shall, and shall cause
their respective Affiliates to, comply at the earliest practicable date with
any request under the HSR Act or any other Antitrust Laws to provide
information, documents, or other materials requested by any Governmental
Authority.

 

(c) Parent and the Company shall each request early termination of the
waiting period provided for in the HSR Act. Parent and the Company shall, and
shall cause their respective Affiliates to, coordinate and cooperate in
connection with their respective efforts to obtain termination or expiration
of the applicable waiting period and all requisite clearances and approvals
under the HSR Act and any other Antitrust Laws as promptly as practicable and
in any event before the End Date, but subject to the limitations set forth in
Section 5.05(e). In connection with any investigation or other inquiry,
Parent and the Company shall, and shall cause their respective Affiliates to,
unless prohibited by applicable Law or a Governmental Authority, (i) keep the
other Party promptly informed of any communication received by such Party or
any of its Affiliates from any Governmental Authority regarding any of the

other Party with a reasonable opportunity to (A) review in advance any
proposed communication by such Party or its Affiliates with any Governmental
Authority, (B) consult with the other Party prior to any meeting or conference
with any Governmental Authority, and (C) attend and participate in such
meetings or conferences. Without the prior written consent of the other Party,
Parent and the Company will not, and will not permit their respective
Affiliates to consent or agree to extend the waiting period under the HSR Act
or enter into any agreement with any Governmental Authority with respect to
the transactions contemplated by this Agreement.

 

(d) Each of Parent and the Company may, as each deems advisable and
necessary, reasonably designate any competitively sensitive material provided
to the other under this

 



55  Section 5.05 as "outside counsel only." Such competitively sensitive
material and the information contained therein shall be given only to the
outside legal counsel of the recipient and will not be disclosed by such
outside counsel to employees, officers, or directors of the recipient unless
express permission is obtained in advance from an authorized officer of Parent
or the Company, as the case may be, or its legal counsel.

(e) In furtherance and not in limitation of the covenants of
the Parties contained in this Section 5.05, Parent and the Company shall, and
shall cause their respective Affiliates to, use reasonable best efforts to
take, or cause to be taken, all other actions and do, or cause to be done, all
other things necessary, proper, or advisable to resolve such objections, if
any, as any Governmental Authority may assert under the HSR Act or any other
Antitrust Laws with respect to the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement, and to avoid or eliminate each and every impediment and avoid the
institution of any Action under any such Law that may be asserted by any
Governmental Authority with respect to the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement, in each case so as to enable the Merger to occur before the End
Date, including by (i) proposing, negotiating, committing to, and effecting,
by consent decree, hold separate order, or otherwise, the sale, divestiture,
or disposition of any assets or businesses of Parent or its Affiliates or the
Company or its Subsidiaries, (ii) terminating existing, or creating new,
relationships, contractual rights, or obligations of Parent or its Affiliates
or the Company or its Subsidiaries, or (iii) effectuating any other change
or restructuring of Parent or its Affiliates or the Company or its
Subsidiaries or otherwise taking or committing to take any actions that limit
the freedom of action of Parent or its Affiliates or the Company or its
Subsidiaries with respect to, or ability to retain, one or more assets or
businesses, to ensure that no Governmental Authority enters any Order or
establishes any Law preliminarily or permanently restraining, enjoining, or
prohibiting the consummation of the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement, or to ensure that no Governmental Authority with the authority to
authorize or approve such consummation fails to do so before the End Date;
_provided_ , _however_ , that, notwithstanding anything to the contrary
contained in this Agreement, no such action under the foregoing clauses (i)
through (iii) shall be (A) required to be proposed, agreed to or taken by
Parent or its Affiliates except to the extent necessary to permit
the consummation of the Merger to occur before the End Date, (B) required
unless contingent upon the occurrence of the Merger, (C) proposed, agreed to,
or taken by the Company or its Subsidiaries without the prior written consent
of Parent, or (D) required to be proposed, agreed to or taken by Parent or

business, results of operations, or financial condition of (x) the Company and
its Subsidiaries (taken as a whole) or (y) Parent and its Subsidiaries (taken
as a whole, after giving effect to the Merger).

 

(f) Each of the Company and Parent shall, and shall cause each of
their respective Affiliates to, cooperate with the other Party and use its
reasonable best efforts to contest and resist any Action, including any
administrative or judicial Action, and to have vacated, lifted, reversed, or
overturned any Order (whether temporary, preliminary, or permanent) that is
threatened or in effect and that restricts, prevents, or prohibits
consummation of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement under the HSR
Act or any other Antitrust Laws, including by pursuing all available avenues
of administrative and judicial appeal; _provided_ , _however_ , that such
obligation to contest and resist any Action in no way limits the obligation of
the Company or Parent to, and to cause its Affiliates to, use reasonable best
efforts to take, or cause to be taken, all other actions and do, or cause to
be done, all other things necessary, proper, or

 



56  advisable to consummate and make effective the transactions contemplated by
this Agreement as promptly as practicable and in any event before the End Date
in accordance with, and subject to the limitations set forth in, Section
5.05(e).

(g) Parent shall not, and shall not permit any of its Affiliates to,
effect any acquisition, business combination or similar transaction, or enter
into any agreement to effect any acquisition, business combination or similar
transaction, that would reasonably be expected to materially delay or
materially and adversely affect Parents ability to satisfy the conditions to
the Merger set forth in Section 6.01(b), Section 6.01(c) (to the extent
related to the HSR Act or the Antitrust Laws set forth in Section 6.01(d) of
the Disclosure Letter) or Section 6.01(d).

 

Section 5.06. Indemnification, Exculpation, and Insurance.

 

(a) For six (6) years after the Effective Time, Parent shall cause
the Surviving Corporation (i) to the fullest extent permitted by applicable
Law, to include and cause to be maintained in effect in the Surviving
Corporations (or any successors) organizational documents provisions
regarding elimination of liability of directors, and indemnification of and
advancement of expenses to directors and officers of the Company, no less
favorable than those contained in the Companys Organizational Documents as of
the date hereof, in favor of all past and present directors and officers of
the Company and its Subsidiaries (individually, an " _Indemnified Party_ "
and, collectively, the " _Indemnified Parties_ ") in connection with acts or
omissions occurring on or prior to the Effective Time, and (ii) to honor the
Companys obligations under the Companys Organizational Documents and those

but in no event to any lesser extent than the Company would be required to
perform them if the transactions contemplated hereby had not taken place.

(b) In the event that either Parent or the Surviving Corporation or
any of their successors or assigns (i) consolidates with or merges into any
other Person and is not the continuing or surviving corporation or entity of
such consolidation or merger or (ii) transfers or conveys all or
substantially all of its properties, rights, and other assets to any Person,
then, and in each such case, Parent shall, and shall cause the Surviving
Corporation to, cause proper provision to be made so that such successor or
assign shall assume the obligations set forth in this Section 5.06.

 

(c) Prior to the Effective Time, the Company shall, and, if the Company
is unable to, Parent shall cause the Surviving Corporation as of the
Effective Time to, obtain and fully pay for, at no expense to the
beneficiaries, non-cancellable "tail" insurance policies with a claims period
of six (6) years from and after the Effective Time with respect to directors
and officers liability insurance policies and fiduciary liability insurance
policies (collectively, " _D andO Insurance_"), for the persons who are covered
by the Companys existing DandO Insurance, with terms, conditions, retentions,
and levels of coverage at least as favorable to the insured individuals as the
Companys existing DandO Insurance with respect to matters existing or
occurring at or prior to the Effective Time (including in connection with this
Agreement or the transactions contemplated hereby); _provided_ that the amount
paid for such tail policy shall not exceed 250% of the amount the Company
paid for the DandO Insurance in its last full fiscal year

 



57  prior to the date of this Agreement (the " _Current Premium_ ") without the
prior written consent of Parent. If the Company and the Surviving Corporation
for any reason fail to obtain such "tail" insurance policies as of the
Effective Time, the Surviving Corporation shall, and Parent shall cause the
Surviving Corporation to, continue to maintain in effect, at no expense to the
beneficiaries, DandO Insurance for a period of at least six (6) years from and
after the Effective Time for the persons who are covered by the Companys
existing DandO Insurance, with terms, conditions, retentions, and levels of
coverage at least as favorable as provided in such existing DandO Insurance;
_provided_ that in satisfying its obligation under this Section 5.06(c), the
Surviving Corporation shall not be obligated to pay aggregate premiums in
excess of 250% of the Current Premium and, if such aggregate premiums for
such insurance would exceed 250% of the Current Premium, then the Surviving
Corporation shall cause to be maintained policies of insurance that, in the
Surviving Corporations good faith judgment, provide the maximum coverage
available for an aggregate premium equal to 250%% of the Current Premium.
Parent hereby acknowledges that under the Indemnification Agreements, the
Company has certain obligations relating to the DandO Insurance coverage to be
obtained pursuant to this Agreement, including this Section 5.06(c). Parent
further acknowledges and agrees that in the event of any inconsistency between
the terms of this Agreement and the terms of any Indemnification Agreement,
the terms of the Indemnification Agreement will prevail.

(d) Parent hereby guarantees the obligations of the Surviving
Corporation under Section 5.06(a)(ii), which guarantee shall (i) be solely a
guarantee of payment by the Surviving Corporation, (ii) be subject to all of
the limitations under applicable Law and the Companys Organizational
Documents that apply to such obligations of the Surviving Corporation and
(iii) not expand the obligations of the Surviving Corporation to any of the
Indemnified Parties in any way.

benefit of, and will be enforceable from and after the Effective Time by, each
Indemnified Party, his or her heirs, and his or her representatives and (ii)
in addition to, and not in substitution for, any other rights to
indemnification or contribution that any such person may have by Contract or
otherwise.

 

Section 5.07. Employee Matters.

each employee of the Company and its Subsidiaries who remains in the active
employment of the Surviving Corporation and its Subsidiaries (the "

and annual incentive opportunities that are, in each case, no less favorable

cafeteria plan will continue to be maintained through a date ending no earlier
than the last day of the calendar year in which the Effective Time occurs,
unless such accounts are merged prior thereto into successor arrangements
maintained by the Surviving Corporation.

 

(b) Nothing contained herein shall be construed as requiring, and the
Company shall take no action after the date of this Agreement that would have
the effect of requiring, Parent or

 



58  the Surviving Corporation to continue any specific Benefit Plans or
compensation, retention or employment arrangements, or to continue the
employment of any specific person. In no event shall the terms of this
Agreement be deemed to (i) establish, amend, or modify any Benefit Plan or any
"employee benefit plan" as defined in Section 3(3) of ERISA, or any other
benefit plan, program, agreement or arrangement maintained or sponsored by
Parent, Surviving Corporation, the Company or any of their Subsidiaries or
Affiliates; or (ii) alter or limit the ability of Parent, the Surviving
Corporation or any of their Subsidiaries or Affiliates to amend, modify or
terminate any Benefit Plan or any other compensation or benefit or employment

service of each Continuing Employee with the Company or its Subsidiaries (as
well as service with any predecessor employer of the Company or its
Subsidiaries to the extent service with such predecessor employer is
recognized by the Company or its Subsidiaries) as if such service had been
performed with Parent with respect to any vacation or severance plans,
policies or programs in which Continuing Employees are eligible to participate
after the Effective Time for all purposes under such vacation or severance
plans, policies or programs, except, in each case, to the extent such
treatment would result in duplicative benefits.

 

(d) With respect to any welfare plan maintained by Parent in which
Continuing Employees are eligible to participate after the Effective Time,
Parent shall take commercially reasonable efforts to, or to cause the
Surviving Corporation to, (i) waive all limitations as to preexisting
conditions and limitations, exclusions, actively-at-work requirements, waiting
periods, and any other restriction that would prevent immediate or full
participation under any welfare benefit plan maintained by the Surviving
Corporation with respect to participation and coverage requirements applicable
to such employees to the extent such conditions and exclusions were satisfied
or did not apply to such employees under the welfare plans or comparable
welfare plans maintained by the Company prior to the Effective Time and (ii)
provide each Continuing Employee with credit for any co-payments and
deductibles paid prior to the Effective Time in the same plan year in which
the Effective Time occurs in satisfying any analogous deductible or out-of-
pocket requirements to the extent applicable under the relevant welfare
benefit plan in which Continuing Employees participate from and after the
Effective Time, as if there had been a single continuous employer, to the
extent credited under the welfare plans maintained by the Company prior to the
Effective Time. Such credited expenses, if any, shall count toward any annual
or lifetime limits, treatment or visit limits or similar limitations that
apply under the terms of the applicable plan.

 

(e) From and after the Effective Time, Parent shall cause the
Surviving Corporation and its Subsidiaries to honor all obligations under the
Benefit Plans and compensation, retention and employment arrangements, and
agreements identified in Section 5.07(e) of the Disclosure Letter in

material written communications related to the transactions contemplated
hereby that are intended for broad-based and general distribution to any
current or former employees of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries.

 



59 (g) If requested by Parent in writing delivered to the Company not
less than ten (10) Business Days before the Closing Date, the Board of
Directors of the Company (or the appropriate committee thereof) shall adopt
resolutions and take such corporate action as is necessary to terminate the
Companys 401(k) plan (the " _Company 401(k) Plan_ "), effective as of the day
prior to the Closing Date. Following the Effective Time and as soon as
practicable following receipt of a favorable determination letter from the
IRS on the termination of the Company 401(k) Plan, the assets thereof shall be
distributed to the participants, and Parent shall, to the extent permitted by
Parents applicable 401(k) plan (the " _Parent 401(k) Plan_ "), permit the
Continuing Employees who are then actively employed to make rollover
contributions of "eligible rollover distributions" (within the meaning of
Section 401(a)(31) of the Code, but not inclusive of loans), in the form of
cash, in an amount equal to the full account balance (excluding loans)
distributed to such employee from the Company 401(k) Plan to the Parent 401(k)
Plan.

 

(h) No later than fifteen (15) Business Days following the date of
this Agreement, the Company shall deliver to Parent a list of each
"disqualified individual" (as defined in Section 280G of the Code) of the
Company and its Subsidiaries and (i) the Companys reasonable, good faith
estimate of the maximum amount (separately identifying single and double-
trigger amounts and tax gross-up payments, if any) that could be paid to, or
benefits received by, such disqualified individual as a result of any of the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement or a termination of employment or
service (with respect to either of the foregoing, alone or in combination with
any other event, including as the result of the accelerated vesting of Company
Equity Awards or the making of the Option Payments or the Company RSU
Payments), (ii) the "base amount" (as defined in Section 280G(b)(3) of the
Code) for each such disqualified individual, (iii) the amount of "excess
parachute payments" (as defined in Section 280G of the Code) and (iv)
underlying documentation on which such calculations are based.

 

(i) The provisions of this Section 5.07 are for the sole benefit of
the Parties and nothing herein, expressed or implied, is intended or shall be
construed to confer upon or give to any person (including for the avoidance of
doubt any current or former employees, directors, or independent contractors
of any of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries, Parent or any of its
Subsidiaries, or on or after the Effective Time, the Surviving Corporation or
any of its Subsidiaries), other than the Parties, any legal or equitable or
other rights or remedies with respect to the matters provided for in this
Section 5.07.

public statement by the Company containing (A) a Company Adverse
Recommendation Change and (B) a statement of the reasons of the Board of
Directors of the Company for making such Company Adverse Recommendation
Change, made in accordance with, and after compliance with, Section 5.02 (in
which case, this Section 5.08 shall apply only to such public statement with
respect to any information relating to Parent or its business, financial
condition or results of operations set forth in such public statement) and
(ii) any public statement by Parent issued in connection with the issuance of
a public statement of the type referred to in clause (i), Parent and the
Company shall consult with each other before issuing, and give each other the
opportunity to review and comment upon, any press release or other public
statements with respect to the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement, including the Merger, and shall not issue any such press release

Party may reasonably conclude may be required by applicable Law, court process
or any listing agreement 

 



60  with, or rules of, any national securities exchange or national securities
quotation system on which the securities of such Party are listed. The Parties
agree that the initial press release to be issued with respect to the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement shall be in the form heretofore
agreed to by the Parties. Notwithstanding the foregoing, Parent may make
public statements with respect to this Agreement and the
transactions contemplated hereby, including their effect on Parents business
and its financial projections, with investors, analysts and Financing Sources,
including, without limitation, on its periodic earnings calls and in any "road
show", so long as Parents comments are not inconsistent with the press
releases previously issued and agreed upon by the Parties.

 

Section 5.09. Section 16 Matters _. _Prior to the Effective Time, the
Company shall cause any dispositions of Company Common Stock (including
derivative securities with respect to Company Common Stock) resulting from the

to the Company to be exempt under Rule 16b-3 promulgated under the Exchange

material cash consideration to any such third parties in connection with the
obtaining of the required consents or waivers pursuant to this Section 5.10.
Without limiting the express obligations in the preceding sentence, Parent
acknowledges and agrees (and Merger Sub will acknowledge and agree) that
having actually obtained any such consents or waivers is not a condition to
Closing.

 

Section 5.11. Treatment of Certain Indebtedness. The Company shall
cause its Subsidiaries to deliver all notices and take all other reasonable
actions to cause (a) the repayment in full on the Closing Date (or in the case

obligations then outstanding under, (b) the release on the Closing Date in
connection with such repayment of all Liens securing such obligations under,

Stock under the Exchange Act as promptly as practicable after the Effective
Time.

Section 5.15. Financing.

 

(a) Parent shall not agree to any amendment or modification to, or
grant any waiver of, any provision under the Commitment Letter without the
prior written consent of the Company if such amendment, modification or waiver
would (i) impose additional conditions to the receipt of the Financing on the
Closing Date, or otherwise amend or modify any such conditions in a manner
that is adverse in any material respect to Parent or the Company, (ii)
individually or in the aggregate with all other amendments, modifications or
waivers to the Commitment Letter, reasonably be expected to prevent or make
less likely to occur the funding of the commitments thereunder on the Closing

the Financing on or prior to the Closing so long as such definitive
documentation is on terms and conditions consistent with the Commitment Letter
and would not result in Prohibited Changes.

Financing on the terms and subject to the conditions set forth in the
Commitment Letter, including, prior to the consummation of the Financing in an
aggregate amount that is sufficient (taken together with any cash available to

Commitment Letter (including any definitive documentation entered into in
connection therewith), (ii) satisfy all conditions in the Commitment Letter
(including any definitive documentation entered into in connection therewith)
applicable to Parent and Merger Sub to obtaining the Financing thereunder as
promptly as practicable (taking into account the expected timing of the
Effective Time) (other than any condition where the failure to be so satisfied
is a direct result of the Companys failure to furnish information to Parent
or otherwise comply with its obligations or the accuracy of any of
its representations under this Agreement), (iii) as promptly as practicable
(taking into account the expected timing of the Effective Time), negotiate,
execute, and deliver definitive documentation with respect to the Financing
contemplated by the Commitment Letter on the terms and subject to the
conditions contemplated by the Commitment Letter (or on terms not less
favorable to Parent and Merger Sub than the terms and conditions (including
market flex provisions) set forth in the Commitment Letter and related Fee
Letter), and (v) subject to the satisfaction of the conditions set forth in
the Commitment Letter and Sections 6.01 and 6.02, cause the Financing Sources
party thereto to fund the Financing thereunder on or prior to the Closing
Date. If any portion of the Financing otherwise becomes unavailable, and such
portion is reasonably required to fund the aggregate Per Share Merger
Consideration and all fees and expenses payable by Parent and Merger Sub
in connection with the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, Parent
and Merger Sub will use their reasonable best efforts to arrange to obtain in
replacement thereof alternative financing from alternative sources in an
amount sufficient to pay the aggregate Per Share Merger Consideration and
such fees and expenses payable by Parent and Merger Sub. Notwithstanding
anything in this Section 5.15 to the contrary, solely to the extent the
representations set forth in Section 4.07(c) shall continue to be true,
Parent will have the right to substitute the proceeds of consummated equity
securities issuances or equity linked, convertible, exchangeable or other debt
securities issuances or other incurrences of debt for all or any portion of
the amount contemplated to be provided by the Bridge Financing contemplated by
the Bridge Commitment Letter and may reduce the amount of the commitments
thereunder. Any reference in this Agreement to the " _Financing_ "
will include the Bridge Financing and any such alternative, replacement or
substitute financing, any reference in this Agreement to the " _Commitment
Letter_ " will include the Bridge Commitment Letter and the commitment letter,
if any, and the corresponding fee letter with respect to any such alternative
financing or such replacement financing.

 

(c) Upon the Companys reasonable request, Parent will keep the
Company reasonably informed on a reasonably current basis of the status of
Parents and Merger Subs efforts to arrange the Financing and to satisfy the
conditions thereof, including, upon the

 



63  Companys reasonable request, advising and updating the Company, in a
reasonable level of detail, with respect to status of definitive documentation
for the Financing and any funding thereof. Parent shall give the Company
prompt written notice (i) of any material breach or default, repudiation, or
termination of any provisions of the Commitment Letter or definitive
documentation relating to the Financing (other than, in the case of the
commitments with respect to the Bridge Financing or the Bridge Financing, in
accordance with the terms thereof), in each case, by any party thereto, of
which Parent becomes aware or (ii) if for any reason Parent determines in
good faith that it will not be able to obtain all or any portion of the
Bridge Financing under the Bridge Commitment Letter on the Closing Date (other
than as a result of a reduction in accordance with the terms thereof).

 

(d) In no event shall the receipt or availability of any funds or
financing (including the Financing) by or to Parent or any of its Affiliates
or any other financing transaction be a condition to any of the obligations of
Parent or Merger Sub hereunder, it being understood that nothing in this
Section 5.15(d) is intended to limit (i) the provision of the Required
Information pursuant to Section 2.02 or (ii) any condition contained in
Section 6.01 or 6.02.

such other financial data relating to the Company and its Subsidiaries as may
be reasonably available to the Company and which is reasonably requested by
Parent in connection with the preparation of one or more bank information

presentations, rating agency materials, private placement memoranda, offering
memoranda, prospectuses and similar documents customary in order to
consummate the Parent Financing or that would be necessary to obtain a consent
from or receive customary "comfort" letters from the independent registered
public accounting firm of the Company (including negative assurance comfort),
and (B) cooperating with Parent in preparing such pro forma financial
statements and other pro forma financial data and financial information;

 

(iii) providing reasonable and customary assistance with the preparation

in

 



64  connection with the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, providing

be (including, in all cases, the Parent Financing); and

 

(v) using reasonable best efforts to cause the Companys registered
public accounting firm to provide written consent to use such firms audit
report in a registration statement filed with the SEC or in any other offering
document and to deliver a customary "comfort" letter (including negative
assurance comfort) to the Financing Sources as customarily required in
connection with any public or private senior note financings or equity
securities issuances or equity linked, convertible, exchangeable or other debt
securities issuances (including, in all cases, the Parent Financing).

(b) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Section 5.16, no
obligation of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries under any certificate or
document (other than the customary representation letter to the independent
registered public accounting firm of the Company in connection with
the delivery of a comfort letter or consent, any customary authorization
letters in connection with any bank debt and any notices of prepayment and/or
commitment terminations which are delivered by the Company not in
contravention of the applicable agreement and conditioned upon the
consummation of the Merger and delivered in accordance with Section 5.11) will
be effective until the Effective Time. In addition, Parent will indemnify,
defend and hold harmless the Company and its Subsidiaries and its and their
Representatives from and against any and all liabilities, obligations, losses,
damages, claims, costs, expenses, awards, judgments and penalties suffered or
incurred by any of them in connection with any Parent Financing and any
information used in connection therewith, except and solely to the extent that
any such obligations, losses, damages, claims, costs, expenses, awards,
judgments and penalties, fees, costs or other liabilities are suffered
or incurred as a result of the Companys or its Subsidiaries or its or their
Representatives gross negligence, bad faith, willful misconduct or material
breach of this Agreement.

 

(c) Notwithstanding the requirements of this Section 5.16, (i) none of
the Company or any of the Companys Subsidiaries will be required to pay or
commit to pay any commitment or other fee or incur any other liability
(including any guarantee, indemnity or pledge) for the Financing prior to the
Effective Time, except fees that are promptly reimbursed by Parent and (ii)
nothing in this Section 5.16 will require the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries to provide any information or take any action, the disclosure or
taking of which would violate applicable Law, any fiduciary duty, any
Contract or obligation of confidentiality owing to a third-party, or

 



65  jeopardize the protection of the attorney-client privilege (it being agreed
that the Company shall give notice to Parent of the fact that it is
withholding such information or documents on the basis of any such Law, duty,
Contract, obligation or privilege, shall withhold only that portion of such
information that is reasonably necessary to be withheld to not violate
applicable Law, duty, Contract or obligation and to preserve attorney-client
privilege, and thereafter the Company shall use its reasonable best efforts to
cause such information to be provided in a manner that would not reasonably be
expected to violate such Law, duty, Contract or obligation or waive attorney-
client privilege).

Section 5.17. Formation of Merger Sub. Parent shall form Merger Sub as
promptly as practicable, but in any event within five (5) Business Days,

contemplated by this Agreement; _provided_ that nothing in this Section
7.03(f) shall (i) relieve any Party from any liabilities or damages resulting
from any fraud or Willful Breach committed by such Party prior to such
termination (except in the case of a termination of this Agreement by the
Company pursuant to Section 7.01(g) entitling the Company to receive the

as a waiver, nor shall any single or partial exercise of any right, power, or
privilege hereunder preclude the exercise of any other right, power, or
privilege. No waiver of any breach of any provision shall be deemed to be a
waiver of any preceding or succeeding breach of the same or any other
provision, nor shall any waiver be implied from any course of dealing between
the Parties. No waiver of any provision of this Agreement shall be effective
except by written instrument executed by the Party against whom the waiver is
to be effective. No extension of time for performance of any obligations or
other acts hereunder or under any other agreement shall be deemed to be an
extension of the time for performance of any other obligations or any other
acts.

documents and the instruments referred to herein), the Confidentiality
Agreement and the Voting and Support Agreements contain the entire
understanding of the Parties in respect of its subject matter and supersedes
all prior agreements and understandings (oral or written) between the Parties
with respect to such subject matter.

 

Section 8.04. Disclosure Letter _. _The Disclosure Letter is not
intended to constitute, and shall not be construed as constituting,
representations or warranties of the Company except and solely to the extent
that a representation or warranty set forth in Article 3 of this
Agreement specifically states that a correct and complete list of a
particular item is set forth on a particular section of the Disclosure Letter.
The fact that any item or other information is disclosed in the Disclosure
Letter shall not be construed to mean that such information is required to be
disclosed by this Agreement. Inclusion of any item or other matter in the
Disclosure Letter shall not be construed as an admission or indication that
such item or other matter is or is not material, that such item has had or
would reasonably be expected to have a Material Adverse Effect or that such
item will in fact exceed any applicable threshold limitation set forth in this
Agreement. Headings in the Disclosure Letter are inserted for
reference purposes and for convenience of the reader only, and shall not
affect the interpretation thereof or of this Agreement. The information
contained in this Agreement and in the Disclosure Letter, and all exhibits
hereto is disclosed solely for purposes of this Agreement, and nothing
contained herein or therein shall be deemed to be an admission by the Company,
or following the Merger the Surviving Corporation, or Parent (as applicable)
to any Person of any matter whatsoever (including any violation of Law,
breach of contract, or any other liability or responsibility in connection
with any pending, threatened, or future matter or proceeding) or a waiver by
the Company, or following the Merger the Surviving Corporation, or Parent (as
applicable) of any rights or remedies against any Person.

 

Section 8.05. Binding Effect; Assignment _. _The rights and
obligations of this Agreement shall bind and inure to the benefit of the
Parties and their respective successors and assigns and, to the extent set
forth in Section 8.06, the Financing Sources and other Persons referred to
therein. Except as expressly provided herein, the rights and obligations of
this Agreement may not be assigned by any Party without the prior written
consent of the other Parties; _provided_  that Parent or Merger Sub, upon
prior written notice to the Company, may assign, in its sole discretion, any
of or all its rights, interests and obligations under this Agreement (a) to
Parent or to any direct or indirect wholly owned Subsidiary of Parent, but no
such assignment shall relieve Parent or Merger Sub of any of its obligations
hereunder or (b) to Financing Sources for collateral security purposes in
connection with the Financing.

 



74 Section 8.06. No Third Party Beneficiaries _. _Nothing expressed or
implied in this Agreement is intended to confer any legal or equitable rights,
benefits, remedies, obligations, or liabilities upon any Person other than the
Parties and their respective successors and permitted assigns; _provided_ ,
_however_ , that the Parties specifically acknowledge and agree that after the
Effective Time, (a) Section 5.06 shall be enforceable by each Indemnified
Party and his or her heirs and (b) each holder of Company Common Stock shall
be entitled to enforce the provisions of Article 2 to the extent necessary to
receive the consideration to which such holder is entitled pursuant to Article
2. Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the contrary, Section
7.03(f), Section 7.04, Section 7.05, Section 8.05, this Section 8.06, Section
8.07, Section 8.08, Section 8.09 and Section 8.13 are intended for the benefit
of, and shall be enforceable by, the Financing Sources.

Section 8.07. Governing Law _. _This Agreement and its enforcement will
be governed by, and interpreted in accordance with, the Laws of the State of
Delaware applicable to agreements made and to be performed entirely within
such state ( _provided_ that the Merger and the exercise of the dissenters
rights with respect to the Merger shall be governed by the Laws of the State
of California) without regard to the conflicts of law provisions thereof that
would apply the laws of any other jurisdiction; _provided_ that, except as
specifically set forth in the Commitment Letter, any Action, whether at law or
in equity, whether in contract or in tort or otherwise, against any Financing
Source in any way relating to this Agreement or any of the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement, including the Merger and the Financing, or any
dispute arising out of or relating in any way to the Merger, the Commitment
Letter, the Financing, the performance thereof or the transactions
contemplated thereby shall be governed by, and constructed in accordance with,
the Laws of the State of New York.

 

Section 8.08. Consent to Jurisdiction _. _Each Party hereby submits to
the exclusive jurisdiction of the federal court in the Central District of
California and any appellate courts therefrom, or if that court does not have
subject matter jurisdiction, in the Delaware Court of Chancery and any state
appellate court therefrom within the State of Delaware (the " _Chosen Courts_
"), for any dispute arising out of or relating to this Agreement or the
breach, termination or validity thereof. Each Party hereby irrevocably
and unconditionally waives, to the fullest extent permitted by Law, any
objection that it may now or hereafter have to the laying of the venue of any
such proceedings brought in such court. Each of the Parties irrevocably and
unconditionally waives and agrees not to plead or argue in any such court (a)
that it is not personally subject to the jurisdiction of the Chosen Courts for
any reason other than the failure to serve process in accordance with
applicable Law, (b) that it or its property is exempt or immune from
jurisdiction of the Chosen Courts or from any legal process commenced in the
Chosen Courts (including but not limited to service of notice, attachment
prior to judgment, attachment in aid of execution of judgment, execution of
judgment or otherwise), and (c) to the fullest extent permitted by applicable
Law that (i) the suit, action, or proceeding in the Chosen Courts is brought
in an inconvenient forum, (ii) the venue of such suit, action, or proceeding
is improper, and (iii) this Agreement, or the subject matter hereof, may not
be enforced in or by the Chosen Courts. Notwithstanding anything in this
Agreement to the contrary, each of the Parties agrees that it will not bring
or support any Action, whether in law or in equity, whether in contract or in
tort or

 



75  otherwise, against any Financing Source in any way relating to this
Agreement or any of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, including
the Merger and the Financing, or any dispute arising out of or relating in
any way to the Merger, the Commitment Letter, the Financing or the performance
thereof or the transactions contemplated thereby, in any forum other than the
United States federal court located in, or if that court does not have
subject matter jurisdiction, in any New York state court located in, the
Borough of Manhattan within the City of New York.

 

Section 8.09. WAIVER OF JURY TRIAL. EACH OF THE PARTIES HERETO IRREVOCABLY
WAIVES ANY AND ALL RIGHT TO TRIAL BY JURY IN ANY LEGAL PROCEEDING ARISING OUT
OF OR RELATING TO THIS AGREEMENT OR THE TRANSACTIONS CONTEMPLATED HEREBY,
INCLUDING THE MERGER AND THE FINANCING (INCLUDING ANY ACTION, PROCEEDING,
CLAIM, CROSS-CLAIM OR THIRD-PARTY CLAIM OF ANY KIND OR DESCRIPTION, WHETHER
IN LAW OR IN EQUITY, WHETHER IN CONTRACT OR IN TORT OR OTHERWISE INVOLVING ANY
FINANCING SOURCE).

 

Section 8.10. Specific Performance _. _The Parties agree that
irreparable harm would occur if any of the provisions of this Agreement were
not performed in accordance with their specific terms on a timely basis or
were otherwise breached. It is accordingly agreed that, without posting
bond or other undertaking, the Parties shall be entitled to seek injunctive
or other equitable relief to prevent breaches of this Agreement and to enforce
specifically the terms and provisions of this Agreement in any court of
competent jurisdiction, this being in addition to any other remedy to which
they are entitled at law or in equity. In the event that any such action is
brought in equity to enforce the provisions of this Agreement, no Party will
allege, and each Party hereby waives the defense or counterclaim, that there
is an adequate remedy at law. The Parties further agree that (a) subject to
the proviso in the last sentence to this Section 8.10, by seeking any remedy
provided for in this Section 8.10, a Party shall not in any respect waive its
right to seek any other form of relief that may be available to such Party
under this Agreement and (b) nothing contained in this Section 8.10 shall
require any Party to institute any action for (or limit such Partys right to
institute any action for) specific performance under this Section 8.10 before
exercising any other right under this Agreement. Notwithstanding anything to
the contrary in this Agreement, the Company shall not be entitled to obtain
specific performance of Parents and Merger Subs obligation to consummate the
Merger unless each of the following conditions are satisfied (a) all of the
conditions set forth in Section 6.01 and Section 6.02 shall have been
satisfied (other than those conditions that by their terms are to be satisfied
by actions taken at the Closing itself, but subject to satisfaction thereof if
the Closing were to occur at that time), (b) the Financing has been funded or
will be funded at the Closing, (c) Parent has failed to close within three (3)
Business Days after the later of (i) the date the Closing should occur in
accordance with Section 2.02 and (ii) receipt of the written confirmation
described in the following clause (d), and (d) the Company has confirmed to
Parent in writing that if specific performance is granted and the Financing is
funded, and Parent otherwise complies with its obligations hereunder, then
the Closing will occur; _provided_ that, notwithstanding anything in this
Agreement to the contrary, under no circumstances shall the Company be
permitted or entitled to receive both a grant of specific performance of
Parents obligation to consummate the Merger and a payment of the Parent
Termination Fee.

 



76 Section 8.11. Severability _. _If any provisions of this Agreement, or
the application thereof to any Person or circumstance, is invalid or
unenforceable in any jurisdiction, then (a) a substitute and equitable
provision shall be substituted therefor in order to carry out, so far as may
be valid and enforceable in such jurisdiction, the intent and purpose of the
invalid or unenforceable provision, and (b) the remainder of this Agreement
and the application of such provision to other Persons or circumstances shall
not be affected by such invalidity or unenforceability, nor shall such
invalidity or unenforceability of such provision affect the validity or
enforceability of such provision, or the application thereof, in any other
jurisdiction.

 

Section 8.12. Counterparts. This Agreement may be executed in any number
of counterparts (including by means of facsimile and electronically
transmitted portable document format (pdf) signature pages), each of which
shall be an original but all of which together shall constitute one and the
same instrument.

Section 8.13. Liability of Financing Sources. Notwithstanding anything
herein to the contrary, the Company acknowledges and agrees that none of the
Financing Sources shall have any liability to the Company or its Affiliates
relating to or arising out of this Agreement or the transactions contemplated
by this Agreement, including the Merger and the Financing, whether in law or
in equity, whether in contract or in tort or otherwise, and neither the
Company nor any of its Affiliates will have any rights or claims against any
Financing Sources under this Agreement and any other agreement contemplated
by, or entered into in connection with, the Financing, including any
commitments by the Financing Sources in respect of the
Financing. Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, in no event shall
the Company or its Affiliates be entitled to seek the remedy of specific
performance of this Agreement against any of the Financing Sources.
