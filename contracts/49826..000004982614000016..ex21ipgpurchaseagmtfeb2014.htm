Expenses (the "Preliminary Closing Statement"). The Preliminary Closing
Statement shall be prepared in good faith in accordance with the Calculation
Principles and this Agreement. For illustrative purposes only, attached hereto

Closing Balance Sheet") as of and at the close of business on the date

in reasonable detail Buyer's calculation of:

1) the Final Net Operating Assets, Closing Date Cash, Closing Date
Indebtedness and IPG Transaction Expenses;

2) the difference between the Preliminary Purchase Price and the Purchase
Price shown on the Final Closing Statement (determined in accordance with
Section 2.02 by substituting the Final Net Operating Assets and Closing Date
Cash, Closing Date Indebtedness and IPG Transaction Expenses amounts shown on
the Final Closing Statement for those previously appearing on the Preliminary
Closing Statement); and

3) the resulting final Purchase Price calculated in accordance with Section
2.02 (the "Final Purchase Price").

(b) The Final Closing Balance Sheet and Final Closing Statement shall be
prepared in accordance with the Calculation Principles and this Agreement.
Nothing in this Section 2.06 is intended to be used to adjust for errors,
omissions or inconsistencies that may be found with respect to the Financial
Statements or the Balance Sheet, or any actual or alleged failure of the
Financial Statements or the Balance Sheet to be prepared in accordance with
GAAP. Buyer shall not be permitted to introduce different accounting
principles, procedures, policies, practices, estimates, judgments or
methodologies in the preparation of the Final Closing Statement or the
determination of Final Net Operating Assets, Closing Date Cash, Closing Date
Indebtedness or IPG Transaction Expenses from the Calculation Principles.

(c) Parent may dispute Buyer's calculation of the Final Closing Balance Sheet
and Final Closing Statement (collectively, the "Final Closing Documents") (or
any element thereof) by notifying Buyer in writing, setting forth in
reasonable detail the particulars of such disagreement, including the basis
therefor (the "Notice of Objection"), within forty-five (45) days after
Parent's receipt of the Final Closing Documents. Any item or amount as to
which no dispute is raised in the Notice of Objection will be final,
conclusive and binding on the Parties for all purposes hereunder, 

unless such item or amount is by its nature adjusted in connection with the
matters raised in the Notice of Objection. In the event that Parent does not
deliver a Notice of Objection to Buyer within such forty-five (45) day period,
Parent shall be deemed to have accepted Buyer's calculation of the Final
Purchase Price set forth in the Final Closing Documents. In the event that a
Notice of Objection is timely delivered, Buyer and Parent shall use their
respective commercially reasonable efforts for a period of sixty (60) days
after Buyer's receipt of the Notice of Objection, or such longer period as the
Parties may agree in writing, to resolve any disagreements set forth in the
Notice of Objection.

(d) If Buyer and Parent are unable to resolve such disagreements within such
sixty (60) day period (or such longer period as the Parties shall have agreed
in writing), then KPMG LLP (or such other independent accounting firm of
recognized national standing as may be mutually selected by Buyer and Parent)
(the "Independent Firm") shall be appointed, as an expert and not an
arbitrator, to resolve any items that remain in dispute at the end of such
period (the "Unresolved Items"), but in no case shall the Independent Firm
review or propose any resolution for any matters that have not been raised in
the Notice of Objection. If KPMG LLP is unwilling or unable to serve in such
capacity and the Parties are not able to mutually select an alternative
accounting firm that is willing and able to serve in such capacity, then
Parent shall within ten (10) days deliver to Buyer a listing of three (3)
other accounting firms of nationally recognized standing (and none of which
have worked in the past two (2) years for Parent or Buyer or any of Parent's
Affiliates or Buyer's Subsidiaries or its equityholders and Buyer shall within
ten (10) days after receipt of such list, select one of such three (3)
accounting firms to act as the Independent Firm.

(e) Buyer and Parent shall instruct the Independent Firm to determine as
promptly as practicable, and in any event within ninety (90) days after the
date on which such dispute is referred to the Independent Firm, based solely
on the provisions of this Agreement, and the written presentations by Parent
and Buyer, and not on an independent review, whether and to what extent (if
any) the calculations set forth in the Final Closing Documents require
adjustment. In resolving any Unresolved Item, the Independent Firm (i) may not
assign a value to any item greater than the greatest value for such item
claimed by either Party or less than the smallest value for such item claimed
by either Party, and (ii) may not take oral testimony from the Parties hereto
or any other Person. Parent and Buyer shall give each other copies of any
written submissions at the same time as they are submitted to the Independent
Firm. Buyer shall bear and pay a percentage of the fees and expenses of the
Independent Firm that is equal to the percentage of the total dollar amount of
changes to the Final Purchase Price proposed by Parent that are successful,
and Parent shall bear and pay a percentage of the fees and expenses of the
Independent Firm that is equal to the percentage of the total dollar amount of
changes to the Final Purchase Price proposed by Parent that are not
successful, in each case, as determined by the Independent Firm. The
determination of the Independent Firm shall be set forth in a written
statement delivered to the Parties and shall be final, conclusive and binding
on the Parties, absent fraud or manifest error. 

(f) Each of Buyer, Sellers and Parent shall, and shall cause their respective
Subsidiaries (including, in the case of Buyer, the IPG Entities) to (i) permit
the other Parties and their Representatives to have reasonable access during
normal business hours to their respective books, records and other documents
(including work papers, schedules, financial statements and memoranda)
pertaining to or used in connection with the preparation of the Preliminary
Closing Statement or the Final Closing Documents, as applicable, and the
calculation of the Net Operating Assets, Closing Date Cash, Closing Date
Indebtedness and IPG Transaction Expenses and (ii) make such Party's employees
available to, and use its reasonable best efforts to cause its accountants to
cooperate with, the other Parties to verify the accuracy of the Preliminary
Closing Statement or Final Closing Documents, as applicable; provided, that
the accountants of a Party shall not be obliged to make any work papers
available to any other Party or its Representatives except in accordance with
such accountant's normal disclosure procedures, after such Person has signed a
customary agreement relating to such access to work papers in form and
substance reasonably acceptable to such accountants.

(g) If the Final Closing Statement shows that an amount is due to Buyer
(because the Preliminary Purchase Price is greater than the Final Purchase
Price shown on the Final Closing Statement), the Sellers shall promptly pay
such difference to Buyer, in cash. If the Final Closing Statement shows that
an amount is due to the Sellers (because the Preliminary Purchase Price is
less than the Final Purchase Price shown on the Final Closing Statement),
Buyer shall promptly pay such excess to the Sellers, in cash. Any payment
pursuant to this Section 2.06(g) shall be made by Buyer or the Sellers, as the
case may be, by wire transfer of immediately available funds within five (5)
Business Days to such account or accounts of such other Party as may be
designated by such other Party in writing. In the event of a failure to timely
make such payment, interest shall accrue on such amount for the period
commencing on the payment due date through the date on which such payment is
made calculated at the Prime Rate. Such interest shall be payable at the same
time as the payment to which it relates and shall be calculated daily on the
basis of a year of three hundred and sixty-five (365) days and the actual
number of days elapsed.

Section 2.07. Allocation of Purchase Price. Schedule 2.07 sets forth the
allocation of the Preliminary Purchase Price (together with Liabilities
treated as assumed by Buyer for federal income tax purposes and other
capitalized costs) among the Participations Intercompany Loan, each of the IPG
Transferred Entities, the Licensed Intellectual Property and the covenant
contained in Section 5.13, which has been mutually agreed by Parent and Buyer
(the "Initial Allocation Statement"). Within thirty (30) days of the date of
this Agreement, but not later than thirty (30) days before the expected
Closing Date, Parent shall provide to Buyer a proposed further allocation on
Schedule 2.07-A of the relevant portion of the Purchase Price attributable to
SPG Netherlands Holdings C.V. and Signode International Holdings LLC among
their respective Subsidiaries, as well as a specific allocation to each of the
German Equity Interests, which further allocation shall be mutually agreed by
Parent and Buyer. Within thirty (30) days after the final determination of the
Purchase Price 

pursuant to the terms of this Agreement, Parent shall deliver to Buyer an
allocation of the final Purchase Price (together with Liabilities treated as
assumed by Buyer for federal income tax purposes and other capitalized costs)
based on the same principles, methods and percentages used in determining the
Initial Allocation Statement (the "Final Allocation Statement"). Concurrent
with the delivery of the Final Allocation Statement, Parent shall also deliver
an initial allocation of the Final Purchase Price attributable to the assets
of Premark Packaging LLC ("Premark") and its Subsidiaries, in accordance with
Section 1060 of the Code (the "Asset Allocation"). Parent and Buyer shall
cooperate and negotiate in good faith to agree on the final determination of
the Final Allocation Statement and Asset Allocation within sixty (60) days
thereafter. If, after sixty (60) days, Parent and Buyer cannot agree on the
final determination of the Final Allocation Statement or Asset Allocation, any
dispute or objection remaining unresolved shall be submitted to the
Independent Firm for resolution and the decision of the Independent Firm shall
be final, conclusive and binding on the parties hereto. All costs and expenses
of the Independent Firm shall be allocated based on the methodology set forth
in Section 2.06(e) as it applies to the final allocation determined by the
Independent Firm. Parent and Buyer agree that the Final Allocation Statement
shall reflect the fair market value of the Participations Intercompany Loan,
each of the IPG Transferred Entities, and each of the German Equity Interests.
After the Closing, the Parties and their respective Affiliates will
consistently use the allocations set forth in the Final Allocation Statement
and the final Asset Allocation, in each case, as finally determined pursuant
to this Section 2.07, for federal, state, local and other Tax purposes,
including for any Tax Returns and any forms or reports required to be filed
pursuant to Section 1060 of the Code (including Internal Revenue Service Form
8594), or any comparable provision of state, local or foreign Law, and in any
administrative or judicial proceeding relating to Taxes, and such Parties
agree that none of them will assert or maintain a position inconsistent with
the foregoing, except as may be otherwise required by applicable Law. Unless
otherwise agreed by Parent and Buyer, any subsequent adjustment to the Final
Purchase Price will be allocated based on the same principles, methods and
percentages used in determining the Final Allocation Statement and the final
Asset Allocation, in each case, as finally determined pursuant to this Section
2.07. Buyer shall timely and promptly prepare, execute, file and deliver all
such documents, forms, and other information as Parent may reasonably request
in preparing such allocation.

Section 2.08. Withholding. Buyer and the IPG Entities shall be entitled to
deduct and withhold any amounts they are required to deduct and withhold
pursuant to any provision of the Code or other Law in connection with any
payments required to be made by Buyer or any IPG Entity pursuant to the terms
of this Agreement; provided that before making any such deduction or
withholding, Buyer shall (i) to the extent reasonably practicable, give Parent
written notice at least fifteen (15) Business Days prior to such deduction or
withholding and (ii) reasonably cooperate with Parent and the Sellers to
reduce or eliminate such deduction or withholding. To the extent that amounts
are so withheld by Buyer or any IPG Entity, such withheld amounts (a) shall be
remitted 

by Buyer or such IPG Entity to the applicable Governmental Authority in
accordance with applicable Law and (b) shall be treated for all purposes of
this Agreement as having been paid to the Person otherwise entitled to receive
such payments pursuant to this Agreement.

ARTICLE III

REPRESENTATIONS AND WARRANTIES OF PARENT AND THE SELLERS

Parent and the Sellers represent and warrant to Buyer that, except as set
forth in the Disclosure Schedules (but subject to Section 11.10):

Section 3.01. Organization and Qualification.

(a) Each of Parent and each Seller is duly organized, validly existing and
(where such concept is applicable) in good standing (or local equivalent)
under the Laws of its jurisdiction of organization, formation or
incorporation, as applicable. Each IPG Entity is duly organized, validly
existing and (where such concept is applicable) in good standing (or local
equivalent) under the Laws of its jurisdiction of organization, formation or
incorporation, as applicable and as specified in Schedule 3.01(a). Each of
Parent, each Seller, and each IPG Entity has all requisite corporate or
similar organizational power and authority necessary to own or lease their
respective properties and assets and to carry on their respective business as
presently conducted in all material respects, except, in the case of Parent
and the Sellers, as would not reasonably be expected, individually or in the
aggregate, to interfere with, prevent or materially delay the ability of
Parent and the Sellers to enter into and perform their obligations under this
Agreement or consummate the transactions contemplated by the Transaction
Documents.

(b) Each of Parent, each Seller and each IPG Entity is duly qualified to do
business (where such concept is applicable) in each jurisdiction where the
nature of their respective business or the ownership of their respective
assets makes such qualification necessary, except where the failure to be so
qualified (i) in the case of Parent and the Sellers, would not reasonably be
expected, individually or in the aggregate, to interfere with, prevent or
materially delay the ability of Parent and the Sellers to enter into and
perform their obligations under this Agreement or consummate the transactions
contemplated by the Transaction Documents, and (ii) otherwise has not had and
would not reasonably be expected to have, individually or in the aggregate, a
Material Adverse Effect. Parent has made available to Buyer true and complete

amendments thereto, as currently in effect. No IPG Entity is in material
violation of any provision of such Organizational Documents.

Section 3.02. Authorization. Each of Parent and each Seller has all requisite
corporate or equivalent organizational powers and authority to execute and
deliver this Agreement and each other Transaction Document to be executed by
Parent or such Seller and to perform its obligations 

hereunder and thereunder and to consummate the transactions contemplated on
its part hereby and thereby. This Agreement and each Transaction Document to
be executed by each of Parent and each Seller has been duly authorized,
executed and delivered by Parent and such Seller and, assuming that this
Agreement has been duly and validly authorized, executed and delivered by
Buyer, constitutes a valid and binding agreement of Parent and such Seller,
enforceable against Parent and such Seller in accordance with its terms,
except as limited by Laws affecting the enforcement of creditors' rights
generally, by general equitable principles or by the discretion of any
Governmental Authority before which any Action seeking enforcement may be
brought (regardless of whether enforcement is sought in a proceeding at law or
in equity).

Section 3.03. Non-contravention. The execution, delivery and performance of
this Agreement and the other Transaction Documents to be executed by Parent or
the applicable Seller, the consummation of the transactions contemplated
hereby and thereby, and the fulfillment of and the performance by Parent and
such Seller of its obligations hereunder and thereunder will not (a) violate
any provision of the Organizational Documents of Parent, such Seller or any
IPG Entity, (b) violate or result in a breach of, or constitute a default or
require a consent under or require the payment of a penalty or increased fees
under or give rise to any right of termination, cancellation, modification or
acceleration of any right or obligation or to a loss of any benefit to which
Parent, such Seller or any IPG Entity is or would be entitled under any
provision of any Contract to which any such Person is party, (c) assuming
compliance with the matters referred to in Section 3.04, violate or result in
a breach of any Law or Permit applicable to Parent, such Seller or the IPG
Entities, or (d) result in the creation or imposition of any Lien (other than
Permitted Liens) on any asset of Parent, such Seller or any IPG Entity,
except, with respect to clauses (b), (c) and (d): (i) in the case of Parent
and the Sellers, as would not reasonably be expected, individually or in the
aggregate, to interfere with, prevent or materially delay the ability of
Parent and the Sellers to enter into and perform their obligations under this
Agreement or consummate the transactions contemplated by the Transaction
Documents, and (ii) otherwise as has not had and would not reasonably be
expected to have, individually or in the aggregate, a Material Adverse Effect.

Section 3.04. Governmental Authorization. The execution, delivery and
performance by each of Parent and each Seller of this Agreement and other
Transaction Documents to which they are a party and the consummation of the
transactions contemplated hereby and thereby require no action by or in
respect of, or consent from or filing with, any Governmental Authority, other
than (a) compliance with any applicable requirements of the HSR Act, the
Exchange Act or any other Competition Laws, (b) compliance with the regulatory
requirements set forth in Schedule 3.04, and (c) any such action or filing the
failure of which to be made or obtained (i) would not reasonably be expected,
individually or in the aggregate, to interfere with, prevent or materially
delay the ability of Parent and the Sellers to enter into and perform their
obligations under this Agreement or consummate the transactions contemplated
by the Transaction Documents, and (ii) would not reasonably be expected to
have, individually or in the aggregate, a Material Adverse Effect. 

Section 3.05. Capitalization.

(h) All of the Equity Interests are owned beneficially and of record by the
Sellers, free and clear of any Liens other than transfer restrictions imposed
thereon by Law. At the Closing, Sellers will deliver to Buyer or its
applicable Buyer Designee good and valid title to the Equity Interests free
and clear of all Liens (other than transfer restrictions imposed thereon by
Law or Liens created by the Buyer). The authorized capital stock of,
partnership interests that represent the corporate capital of, or other equity
interests in, the IPG Transferred Entities are set forth in Schedule 3.05(a).
All of the Equity Interests were duly authorized and validly issued, fully
paid and nonassessable (to the extent such concept is relevant to such IPG
Transferred Entity), and are free and clear of, and were not issued in
violation of, any conversion rights, preemptive rights, rights of first
refusal, redemption rights, repurchase rights or other similar rights or
restrictions on transfer (other than restrictions under applicable Law). There
is no (i) existing option, warrant, call, right or agreement to which the
Sellers or any of the IPG Transferred Entities is a party requiring, and there
are no securities of the Sellers or any of the IPG Transferred Entities
outstanding that upon conversion or exchange would require, an increase to the
value of any capital stock, limited liability company interest or partnership
interest of any IPG Transferred Entity, as applicable, or other securities
convertible into, exchangeable for or evidencing the right to subscribe for or
purchase any capital stock, limited liability company interest or partnership
interest of any IPG Transferred Entity, (ii) shares of capital stock of,
partnership interests that represent the corporate capital of, or other equity
interests in the IPG Transferred Entities that are reserved for issuance, or
(iii) bonds, debentures, notes or other Indebtedness having the right to vote
on any matters on which the equityholders of any IPG Transferred Entity may
vote.

(i) Schedule 3.05(b) sets forth an accurate and complete list of (i) each IPG
Subsidiary, (ii) the authorized shares of capital stock of, partnership
interests that represent the corporate capital of, or other equity interests
of each such IPG Subsidiary, (iii) the issued and outstanding shares of
capital stock of, partnership interests that represent the corporate capital
of, or other equity interests of each such IPG Subsidiary, and (iv) the legal
ownership of each such IPG Subsidiary. All of the IPG Subsidiaries set forth
on Schedule 3.05(b) are owned beneficially, directly or indirectly, and of
record by the IPG Transferred Entities, free and clear of any Liens other than
Permitted Liens and transfer restrictions imposed thereon by Law. There is no
(A) existing option, warrant, call, right or agreement to which any of the IPG
Transferred Entities or IPG Subsidiaries is a party requiring, and there are
no securities of any of the IPG Subsidiaries outstanding that upon conversion
or exchange would require, an increase to the value of any capital stock,
limited liability company interest or partnership interest of any IPG
Subsidiary, as applicable, or other securities convertible into, exchangeable
for or evidencing the right to subscribe for or purchase any capital stock,
limited liability company interest or partnership interest of any IPG
Subsidiary, (B) shares of capital stock of, partnership interests that
represent the corporate capital of, or other equity interests in the IPG 

Subsidiaries that are reserved for issuance, or (C) bonds, debentures, notes
or other Indebtedness having the right to vote on any matters on which the
equityholders of any IPG Subsidiary may vote.

(j) The IPG Transferred Entities and the IPG Subsidiaries do not own or hold
any equity interest in any Person other than the IPG Subsidiaries and the JV
Entities. Schedule 3.05(c) sets forth a true and complete list of (i) each JV
Entity, (ii) the equity interests that represent the equity interests of each
such JV Entity, (iii) the issued and outstanding equity interests that
represent the equity interests in each such JV Entity, and (iv) the legal
ownership of each such JV Entity. All of the outstanding equity interests of
the JV Entities set forth on Schedule 3.05(c) represent the equity interests
in each JV Entity that are owned, directly or indirectly, by the IPG Entities,
which are free and clear of any Liens other than Permitted Liens and transfer
restrictions imposed thereon by Law or the Organizational Documents of the JV
Entities.

Section 3.06. Financial Statements.

(a) Parent has made available to Buyer complete and correct copies of the (i)
audited combined statements of financial position of the Business as of
December 31, 2012 and 2011, and the related combined statements of income,
comprehensive income, group equity, and cash flows for each of the two years
in the period ended December 31, 2012 (the "Audited Financial Statements"),
and (ii) the unaudited combined statements of financial position of the
Business for the nine-month period ended as of September 30, 2013, and the
related unaudited combined statements of income, comprehensive income, group
equity, and cash flows for the nine-month period ended as of September 30,
2013 (the "Unaudited Financial Statements"; and together with the Audited
Financial Statements, the "Financial Statements"), true and complete copies of
which are set forth in Schedule 3.06(a). The Financial Statements (A) have
been prepared from, are in accordance with, and accurately reflect the books
and records of Parent in all material respects (except as may be indicated in
the notes thereto), (B) fairly present in all material respects the combined
financial position and combined results of operations and cash flows of the
Business as of the respective dates or for the respective time periods set
forth therein, (C) have been prepared in accordance with GAAP consistently
applied (except as may be indicated in the notes thereto or, in the case of
the Unaudited Financial Statements, for normal and recurring year-end
adjustments), and (D) have been prepared in accordance with the carve out
guidelines included in SEC Staff Accounting Bulletin Topic 1.B. This Section
3.06(a) is qualified by the fact that the Business has not operated as a
separate "stand alone" entity within Parent. As a result, the Business has
been allocated certain charges and credits for purposes of the preparation of
the Financial Statements, as described in footnote 12 of the Audited Financial
Statements and footnote 10 of the Unaudited Financial Statements. Such
allocations of charges and credits do not necessarily reflect the amounts that
would have resulted from arms-length transactions or the actual costs that
would be incurred if the Business operated as an independent enterprise. 

(b) Parent maintains a system of internal controls over financial reporting
(as defined in Rules 13a-15(f) and 15d-15(f) of the Exchange Act) sufficient
to provide reasonable assurances regarding the reliability of financial
reporting related to the Business. Parent (i) maintains disclosure controls
and procedures (as defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) of the Exchange
Act) to ensure that material information required to be disclosed by Parent
related to the Business in the reports that it files or submits under the
Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time
periods specified in the SEC's rules and forms and is accumulated and
communicated to management as appropriate to allow timely decisions regarding
required disclosure and (ii) has disclosed to the Business's auditors (A) any
significant deficiencies and material weaknesses in the design or operation of
internal controls over financial reporting that are reasonably likely to
adversely affect in any material respect the ability to record, process,
summarize and report financial information related to the Business and (B) any
fraud, whether or not material, that involves management or other employees
who have a significant role in the internal controls over financial reporting.

Section 3.07. Absence of Certain Developments. Except for actions taken to
effect the transactions contemplated by this Agreement and the Reorganization
Documents, from the Balance Sheet Date through the date of this Agreement, (a)
there has not been any Effect which has had or would reasonably be expected to
have, individually or in the aggregate, a Material Adverse Effect, (b) the
Business has been conducted in the ordinary course consistent with past
practice in all material respects, and (c) none of Parent, any Seller or any
IPG Entity has taken any action that would, if taken by Parent or such Seller
or IPG Entity from the date hereof through the Closing Date, require the
consent of Buyer under clauses (e), (f) or (q) of Section 5.01.

Section 3.08. Compliance with Laws; Permits.

(a) Except with respect to (i) compliance with Law concerning employee matters
(as to which certain representations and warranties are made pursuant to
Sections 3.12 and 3.13), (ii) compliance with Environmental Laws (as to which
certain representations and warranties are made pursuant to Section 3.11),
(iii) compliance with anti-corruption, Export Control Laws and Import Laws (as
to which certain representations and warranties are made pursuant to Section
3.08(c)-(e), and (iv) compliance with Law concerning Taxes (as to which
certain representations and warranties are made pursuant to Section 3.14), no
IPG Entity is, nor in the preceding two (2) years has been, in conflict with,
default under or violation of, or to the Sellers' knowledge is being, or in
the preceding two (2) years has been, investigated for, or is, or in the
preceding two (2) years has been, to the Sellers' knowledge charged by any
Governmental Authority with a violation of, any Law applicable to such IPG
Entity or by which any property or asset of such IPG Entity is bound or
affected, except for conflicts, defaults, violations, investigations or
charges that, individually or in the aggregate, have not resulted and would
not reasonably be expected to result in material Liability to the IPG
Entities, taken as a whole, or otherwise materially interfere with the conduct 

of the Business in substantially the manner currently conducted. No
investigation or review by any Governmental Authority with respect to any IPG
Entity is pending or, to Sellers' knowledge, threatened, nor, in the preceding
two (2) years, has any Governmental Authority indicated an intention to
conduct any such investigation or review, except for such investigations or
reviews, the outcomes of which if determined adversely to the IPG Entities,
individually or in the aggregate, have not resulted and would not reasonably
be expected to result in material Liability to the IPG Entities, taken as a
whole, or otherwise materially interfere with the conduct of the Business in
substantially the manner currently conducted.

(b) The IPG Entities possess all governmental permits, approvals, orders,
authorizations, consents, licenses, certificates, franchises, exemptions of,
or filings or registrations with, or issued by, any Governmental Authority
necessary for the operation of the Business as currently conducted (the
"Permits"), except when the failure to possess such Permit would not
reasonably be expected, individually or in the aggregate, to result in
material Liability to the IPG Entities, taken as a whole, or otherwise
materially interfere with the conduct of the Business in substantially the
manner currently conducted. All Permits are, and in the preceding two (2)
years have been, in full force and effect, and there are no Actions pending
or, to the Sellers' knowledge, threatened by any Governmental Authority that
seek the revocation, cancellation, suspension or adverse modification thereof,
except as would not reasonably be expected, individually or in the aggregate,
to result in material Liability to the IPG Entities, taken as a whole, or
otherwise materially interfere with the conduct of the Business in
substantially the manner currently conducted. None of the IPG Entities are in
default, and, to the knowledge of the Sellers, no condition exists that with
notice or lapse of time or both would constitute a default, under the Permits,
except as would not reasonably be expected, individually or in the aggregate,
to result in material Liability to the IPG Entities, taken as a whole, or
otherwise materially interfere with the conduct of the Business in
substantially the manner currently conducted.

(c) No IPG Entity or any director, officer, employee or, to the knowledge of
the Sellers, any agent or other Person acting for or on behalf of an IPG
Entity is or, in the last five (5) years, has been in violation of, or has
conducted or initiated any internal investigation, or disclosed to a
Governmental Authority any matter, with respect to, the U.S. Foreign Corrupt
Practices Act of 1977, as amended, the UK Bribery Act of 2010, as amended, or
any other applicable anti-bribery or anti-corruption laws, or except, in each
case, as would not reasonably be expected, individually or in the aggregate,
to result in material Liability to the IPG Entities, taken as a whole, or
otherwise materially interfere with the conduct of the Business in
substantially the manner currently conducted. No officer or director or, to
the knowledge of the Sellers, any employee, agent or other Person acting for
or on behalf of any IPG Entity is a non-U.S. Government Official.

(d) No IPG Entity is, or in the preceding five (5) years has been, (i) in
violation of any U.S. Export Control Laws or Import Laws and (ii) neither
Parent nor any of the IPG Entities have 

received any notice alleging any violation by any of the IPG Entities of any
U.S. Export Control Laws or U.S. Import Laws, except in the case of clauses
(i) and (ii) as would not reasonably be expected, individually or in the
aggregate, to result in material Liability to the IPG Entities, taken as a
whole, or otherwise materially interfere with the conduct of the Business in
substantially the manner currently conducted. To the knowledge of the Sellers,
no IPG Entity is, or in the preceding five (5) years has been (i) in violation
of any other Export Control Laws in any manner that would reasonably be
expected, individually or in the aggregate, to result in material Liability to
the IPG Entities, taken as a whole, or otherwise materially interfere with the
conduct of the Business in substantially the manner currently conducted and
(ii) neither Parent nor any of the IPG Entities have received any notice
alleging any violation by any of the IPG Entities of any Export Control Law or
Import Law that would reasonably be expected, individually or in the
aggregate, to result in material Liability to the IPG Entities, taken as a
whole, or otherwise materially interfere with the conduct of the Business in
substantially the manner currently conducted.

(e) As of the date of this Agreement, no IPG Entity nor any director or
officer, or to the knowledge of the Sellers, any employee, agent or other
Person acting for or on behalf of any IPG Entity, is importing or, in the last
three (3) years, has imported any products or materials for which final
liquidation has not yet occurred which are subject to or otherwise covered by
an antidumping duty order or countervailing duty order that remains in effect
or is subject to or otherwise covered by any pending antidumping or
countervailing duty investigation.

Section 3.09. Litigation. In the preceding two (2) years there have been no
Actions pending by or before any Governmental Authority or, to the knowledge
of the Sellers, threatened against Parent, the Sellers or the IPG Entities or
otherwise arising out of or relating to the Business that (a) in the case of
Parent and the Sellers, would reasonably be expected, individually or in the
aggregate, to interfere with, prevent or materially delay the ability of
Parent and the Sellers to enter into and perform their obligations under this
Agreement or consummate the transactions contemplated by the Transaction
Documents, or (b) otherwise would reasonably be expected, individually or in
the aggregate, to result in any material Liability to the IPG Entities, taken
as a whole, or otherwise materially interfere with the conduct of the Business
in substantially the manner currently conducted. In the preceding two (2)
years, there has been no order, writ, judgment, award, ruling, injunction,
decree or consent decree entered by or with any Governmental Authority
purporting to enjoin or restrain the execution, delivery and performance by
Parent and the Sellers of the transactions contemplated hereby or that would
reasonably be expected, individually or in the aggregate, to result in
material Liability to the IPG Entities, taken as a whole, or otherwise
materially interfere with the conduct of the Business in substantially the
manner currently conducted.

Section 3.10. No Undisclosed Liabilities. The IPG Entities do not have any
Liabilities that would have been required to be reflected in, reserved against
or otherwise described in the Balance Sheet in accordance with GAAP,
consistently applied in accordance with past practice, and that 

were not so reflected, reserved against or described therein, other than
Liabilities (a) disclosed in the Financial Statements, (b) incurred after
September 30, 2013 in the ordinary course of business consistent with past
practice, (c) incurred under this Agreement or in connection with the
transactions contemplated hereby, (d) that would not reasonably be expected,
individually or in the aggregate, to result in any material Liability to the
IPG Entities taken as a whole, and (e) that are Tax Liabilities incurred in
connection with the Reorganization, to the extent Parent has agreed to provide
indemnification pursuant to Section 6.05(a)(iv). The IPG Entities do not
maintain any "off-balance sheet arrangement" within the meaning of Item 303 of
Regulation S-K of the U.S. Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended.

Section 3.11. Environmental Matters.

(a) Except for matters that would not reasonably be expected, individually or
in the aggregate, to result in material Liability to the IPG Entities, taken
as a whole, or otherwise materially interfere with the conduct of the Business
in substantially the manner currently conducted:

its applicable Subsidiaries with respect to the Business) for the past three
(3) years have been, in compliance with all applicable Environmental Laws,
including but not limited to any Permits required by applicable Environmental
Laws;

(ii) (A) no written notice, claim, inquiry, order, complaint, penalty or
demand has been made or received and (B) there is no Action pending or, to the

Property;

(iv) to the knowledge of the Sellers, no IPG Entity, or any other Person, has
treated, stored, disposed of, arranged for the disposal of, transported,
handled, released, or exposed any Person to, any Hazardous Substance so as to
give rise to any Liability under any Environmental Law; and 

(v) neither this Agreement nor the consummation of the transaction that is the
subject of this Agreement will result in any obligations for site
investigation or cleanup, or notification to or consent of Governmental
Authorities or third parties, pursuant to any Environmental Laws.

environmental audits, assessments and reports, and all other material
documents bearing on environmental, health or safety Liabilities, in their

Environmental Conditions, Environmental Laws or any Permit required under any
Environmental Law.

applicable, each of Parent and its Non-IPG Subsidiaries, are, and for the past
two (2) years, have been, in material compliance with all applicable Laws
respecting employment, including provisions thereof relating to employment
practices, labor, terms and conditions of employment, wages and hours,
employment standards, human rights, occupational safety, workers'
compensation, language of work, and plant closings. There are no complaints,
lawsuits or other proceedings pending or, to the knowledge of the Sellers,
threatened against the IPG Entities, Parent or any of its Non-IPG Subsidiaries
brought by or on behalf of any current or former Business Employee, relating
to any such Laws which would reasonably be expected, individually or in the
aggregate, to result in material Liability to the IPG Entities, taken as a
whole, or otherwise materially interfere with the conduct of the Business in
substantially the manner currently conducted.

(b) The terms and conditions of employment of the Business Employees are not
subject to any Bargaining Agreement and there are no labor unions or works
councils representing any Business Employee or, to the knowledge of Sellers,
engaged in any organizing activity with respect to representing any Business
Employee (and to the knowledge of Sellers no such organizing activities have
occurred within the preceding two (2) years). None of the IPG Entities are in
breach of or default under, or have received any written notice of any default
or event that, with notice or lapse of time, or both, would constitute a
breach or default by the IPG Entities under any Bargaining Agreement, except
for any breach or default that would not reasonably be expected, individually
or in the aggregate, to result in material Liability to the IPG Entities,
taken as a whole, or otherwise materially interfere with the conduct of the
Business in substantially the manner currently conducted. To the knowledge of
the Sellers, no other party to a Bargaining Agreement set forth on Schedule
3.12(b) is in breach of or default under any such Bargaining Agreement, except
as would not reasonably be expected, individually or in the aggregate, to
result in material Liability to the IPG 

Entities, taken as a whole, or otherwise materially interfere with the conduct
of the Business in substantially the manner currently conducted. During the
past two (2) years, there has not been and, to the knowledge of Sellers there
is not presently pending, existing, or threatened, any strike, slowdown,
picketing or work stoppage with respect to any Business Employee. With respect
to the Reorganization and the transactions contemplated by this Agreement,
each of the Sellers and the IPG Entities has provided or prior to the Closing
will provide all legally required notices to Business Employees and/or their
representatives, and each of the Sellers and the IPG Entities has satisfied or
will have satisfied all bargaining, consultation, consent or similar
obligations.

Section 3.13. Employee Benefit Plans.

(a) Schedule 3.13(a)(i) lists each material IPG Plan. Parent has made
available to Buyer for each IPG Plan listed in Schedule 3.13(a)(i), each
material plan document, trust agreement insurance contract, or other funding
arrangement and all current summary plan descriptions and for each material
Excluded Plan that covers Business Employees, a summary of such Excluded Plan.
Schedule 3.13(a)(ii) lists each New IPG Plan. Parent will make available to
Buyer copies of each New IPG Plan as they become available.

(b) None of the IPG Plans or New IPG Plans are subject to Title IV of ERISA or
Section 412 of the Code. The transactions contemplated by this Agreement shall
not trigger any Liability for Buyer or any IPG Entity under Title IV of ERISA
with respect to any Employee Plan. No liens under Section 430(k) of the Code
or Section 4068 of ERISA have arisen on the assets of any IPG Entity, and no
condition exists that presents a material risk to any IPG Entity of incurring
any Liability under Title IV of ERISA (other than Liability of an ERISA
Affiliate for routine premium payments due to the Pension Benefit Guaranty
Corporation ("PBGC")) or Sections 412 or 430 of the Code. No U.S. Business
Employee participates in a "multiemployer plan" (as defined in Section 3(37)
of ERISA), nor has any withdrawal Liability (within the meaning of Section
4201 of ERISA) been triggered by an ERISA Affiliate that has not been
satisfied in full as of the date hereof.

(c) Each IPG Plan, each New IPG Plan, each Parent U.S. Defined Contribution
Plan set forth on Schedule 7.01(e), and, except as could not result in a
Liability to Buyer, each other Excluded Plan which is intended to be qualified
under Section 401(a) of the Code has received a favorable determination letter
(a copy of which has been provided to Buyer), or has pending or is within the
remedial amendment period in which to file, an application for such
determination from the IRS, and to the knowledge of the Sellers or Parent,
nothing has occurred that could adversely affect such qualified status.

(d) Each IPG Plan, each New IPG Plan and, except as could not result in
Liability to Buyer or any IPG Entity, each Excluded Plan has been established,
maintained, funded and administered in material compliance with its terms and
with all applicable Law. None of the IPG 

Plans, the New IPG Plans, or the Excluded Plans are, to the knowledge of
Sellers or Parent, presently under audit or examination (nor has notice been
received of any potential audit or examination) by any Governmental Authority.
Other than routine claims for benefits, there are no material proceedings or
claims pending or, to the knowledge of Sellers or Parent, threatened with
respect to any IPG Plan, New IPG Plan, or, to the extent it could reasonably
be expected to result in Liability to Buyer or any IPG Entity, any Excluded
Plan. Except as set forth on Schedule 3.13(c), no IPG Plan or New IPG Plan
provides, nor have Sellers, Parent or any IPG Entity promised to provide, life
or health insurance benefits to any U.S. Business Employee (or spouse or
dependent thereof) beyond such U.S. Business Employee's termination of
employment or service except as required by Section 4980B of the Code or
similar U.S. state Law.

(e) With respect to each IPG Plan that covers Non-U.S. Business Employees: (i)
the IPG Entities have performed in all material respects the obligations
required thereunder, (ii) all payments (including premiums due) and all
employer and employee contributions required to have been collected have been
paid when due, or if applicable, accrued on the balance sheet of the
applicable IPG Entity, (iii) no Taxes, penalties or fees are owing or
assessable under or against any such IPG Plan, (iv) no event has occurred with
respect to any such IPG Plan which is tax-qualified or registered under Law
which would result in the revocation or loss of such tax-qualified status or
registration of such IPG Plan, or which would entitle any Person (without the
consent of the sponsor of such IPG Plan) to wind up or terminate any such IPG
Plan, in whole or in part, and (v) each IPG Entity has met all minimum funding
obligations required by applicable Law.

(f) Neither the execution and delivery of this Agreement nor the consummation
of the transactions contemplated hereby will (either alone or in conjunction
with any other event, such as a termination of employment) (i) result in any
payment (including severance, parachute or otherwise) becoming due to any
Business Employee under any IPG Plan or otherwise, (ii) materially increase
any benefits otherwise payable under any IPG Plan, or (iii) result in the
acceleration of the time of payment, funding or vesting of any material
benefits.

(g) Each IPG Plan that is a "nonqualified deferred compensation plan" (as
defined for purposes of Section 409A(d)(1) of the Code) is in documentary and
operational compliance with the requirements of Section 409A of the Code and
the applicable guidance issued thereunder in all material respects. No IPG
Entity has any obligation to indemnify any Person for any Taxes imposed under
Section 4999 or 409A of the Code.

(h) The transactions contemplated by this Agreement will not cause a "change
in ownership," a "change in effective control" or a "change in ownership of a
substantial portion of the assets" of Parent within the meaning of Section
280G of the Code. 

(i) With respect to each employment agreement to which an IPG Entity is a
party or is bound ("Employment Arrangements"), such IPG Entity is in
compliance with the term of such Employment Arrangements, and such Employment
Arrangements are in compliance with applicable Law, except, in each case, for
any defaults, violations or noncompliance that, individually or in the
aggregate, have not resulted and would not reasonably be expected to result in
material Liability to the IPG Entities, taken as a whole, or otherwise
materially interfere with the conduct of the Business in substantially the
manner currently conducted.

Section 3.14. Taxes.

(a) Each of the IPG Entities has timely filed with the appropriate Taxing
Authority all income and other material Tax Returns required to be filed by
it, and all such Tax Returns are accurate and complete in all material
respects. None of the IPG Entities currently is the beneficiary of any
extension of time within which to file any income or material Tax Return,

Taxing Authority.

(b) All material Taxes that have become due and payable by each of the IPG
Entities have been paid or for which adequate reserves have been established

jurisdiction.

(c) There are currently no material deficiencies for Taxes due from any IPG
Entity that have been claimed, proposed or assessed, in each case, in writing,
by any Taxing Authority for any taxable period for which the period of
assessment remains open. There are no pending audits, claims, assessments,
administrative proceedings or other Actions for or relating to any material
Tax Liability of any of the IPG Entities. None of the IPG Entities has (i)
received written notice from any Taxing Authority indicating an intent to open
an audit or other review (other than audits that are currently pending or
already closed) or (ii) waived any statute of limitations in respect of Income
Taxes or other material Taxes or agreed to any extension of time with respect
to any assessment or deficiency of a material amount of Taxes which waiver has
not expired or been terminated. No closing agreements, private letter rulings,
technical advice memoranda or similar agreements or rulings have been sought
from, entered into or issued by any Taxing Authority directly related to any
IPG Entity within the previous six (6) years.

(d) There are no material Liens for Taxes upon the assets of any IPG Entity
other than Permitted Liens.

(e) All material Taxes that each IPG Entity was required to withhold or

respects with the rules and regulations relating to the withholding and
remittance of Taxes.

an IPG Entity) (A) under Treasury Regulation Section 1.1502-6 (or any similar
provision of state, local or foreign Law), (B) as a transferee or successor,
or (C) under any Tax Sharing Agreement.

(g) None of the IPG Entities has engaged in any "listed transactions" within
the meaning of Treasury Regulation Section 1.6011-4(b)(2).

(h) None of the IPG Entities has constituted either a "distributing
corporation" or a "controlled corporation" in a transaction intended to be
governed by Section 355 of the Code within the four (4) years prior to the
date hereof.

(i) None of the IPG Entities will be required to include any material item of
income in, or exclude any material item of deduction from, taxable income for
any taxable period (or portion thereof) ending after the Closing Date as a
result of (i) any change in method of accounting for a taxable period ending
on or prior to the Closing Date pursuant to Section 481(a) of the Code (or any
corresponding or similar provision of state, local, or non-U.S. income Tax
law), (ii) use of an improper method of accounting for a taxable period ending
on or prior to the Closing Date, (iii) intercompany transaction or excess loss
account described in Treasury Regulations under Section 1502 of the Code (or

received or paid, or (vi) any election pursuant to Section 108(i) of the Code
(or any similar provision of state, local or foreign Law) made with respect to
any taxable period ending on or prior to the Closing Date.

(j) None of the IPG Entities is or has been within the five-year period

(k) Following the Closing, none of the IPG Entities will be included in a
consolidated, combined, unitary, VAT, group relief or other similar group
where such group includes a member other than an IPG Entity, Buyer or any
Buyer's Affiliates.

(l) Other than the IPG Entities listed in Schedule 3.14(l), (the "Non-U.S. IPG
Corporations"), after the Reorganization, each IPG Entity organized outside
the United States shall be treated as a disregarded entity (or partnership)
for U.S. federal income tax purposes. 

(m) None of the IPG Entities has a permanent establishment (within the meaning
of an applicable Tax treaty) or otherwise has an office or fixed place of
business in a country other than the country in which it is organized that
would give rise to a material amount of Tax.

(n) The representations in Section 3.13 (to the extent Tax-based) and 3.14 are
the sole and exclusive representations made by Parent and the Sellers with
respect to any matters relating to Taxes.

Section 3.15. Intellectual Property.

(a) Schedule 3.15(a) contains a list of all material (i) issued patents and
pending patent applications, (ii) trademark and service mark registrations and
applications, (iii) copyright registrations and applications, and (iv)
internet domain name registrations, in each case, owned by any of the IPG
Entities (collectively, the "Business Registered Intellectual Property").

(b) (i) The IPG Entities are the sole and exclusive owners of material
Business Registered Intellectual Property, free and clear of all Liens other
than Permitted Liens, and (ii) no Action is pending, or to the knowledge of
the Sellers, is threatened, which challenges the validity, enforceability,
registration, ownership or use of any of the Business Registered Intellectual
Property.

(c) Except for the ITW Marks and the Licensed Intellectual Property, the
Intellectual Property owned by the IPG Entities constitutes all material
Intellectual Property owned by Parent and its Subsidiaries (including the IPG
Entities) and used or held for use in the conduct of the Business in
substantially the manner currently conducted (the "Business Intellectual
Property"). Except as would not reasonably be expected, individually or in the
aggregate, to result in material Liability to the IPG Entities, taken as a
whole, or otherwise materially interfere with the conduct of the Business in
substantially the manner currently conducted, the execution, delivery and
performance of this Agreement and the other Transaction Documents to be
executed by Parent or the applicable Seller, the consummation of the
transactions contemplated hereby and thereby, and the fulfillment of and the
performance by Parent and such Seller of its obligations hereunder and
thereunder will not result in the loss, forfeiture, termination, or impairment
of, or give rise to a right of any Person to limit, terminate, or consent to
the continued use of, any rights of any of the IPG Entities in any Business
Intellectual Property.

(d) Except as would not reasonably be expected, individually or in the
aggregate, to result in material Liability to the IPG Entities, taken as a
whole, or otherwise materially interfere with the conduct of the Business in
substantially the manner currently conducted, to the knowledge of the Sellers,
the conduct of the Business by the IPG Entities does not currently infringe,
misappropriate, dilute, or otherwise violate, any Intellectual Property of any
other Person. Neither Parent, its Subsidiaries, the Sellers nor the IPG
Entities have received any charge, complaint, claim, demand, or notice during
the past three (3) years (or earlier, if presently not resolved) alleging any 

infringement, misappropriation, dilution, or other violation of the
Intellectual Property of any other Person by Parent, its Subsidiaries, the
Sellers or any of the IPG Entities in their conduct of the Business. To the
knowledge of the Sellers, except as would not reasonably be expected,
individually or in the aggregate, to result in material Liability to the IPG
Entities, taken as a whole, or otherwise materially interfere with the conduct
of the Business in substantially the manner currently conducted, no Person is
infringing, misappropriating, diluting, or otherwise violating any
Intellectual Property owned by the IPG Entities.

(e) The computer systems, servers, workstations, routers, hubs, switches,
circuits, networks, and other information technology equipment, hardware and
Software owned, licensed, leased or controlled by the IPG Entities
(collectively, the "Business IT Assets") have not materially malfunctioned or
failed within the preceding three (3) years. The IPG Entities have in place
commercially reasonable measures, consistent with current industry standards,
to protect the confidentiality, integrity and security of the Business IT
Assets (and all information and transactions stored or contained therein or
transmitted thereby) against any unauthorized use, access, interruption,
modification or corruption. Neither Parent nor its Subsidiaries (taken as a
whole) have, in connection with the operation of the Business in the preceding
three (3) years, experienced any data security breach or failure or
unauthorized data release incident, other than as has not had and would not
reasonably be expected to have, individually or in the aggregate, a Material
Adverse Effect.

(f) Except as would not reasonably be expected, individually or in the
aggregate, to result in material Liability to the IPG Entities, taken as a
whole, or otherwise materially interfere with the conduct of the Business in
substantially the manner currently conducted Parent and its Subsidiaries have
used commercially reasonable efforts to (i) protect the confidentiality of
trade secrets and confidential or proprietary information used in the conduct
of the Business in substantially the manner currently conducted, and (ii)
cause its employees, contractors and consultants to execute "work made for
hire" arrangements or assignment agreements and confidentiality agreements for
the protection and assignment of the material Business Intellectual Property.

(g) The representations in this Section 3.15 and Sections 3.16, 3.19 (which
shall not be deemed to address the infringement of any Intellectual Property
of any third party, which is addressed exclusively in Section 3.15(d), or the
validity or enforceability of any Intellectual Property) and 3.20 are the sole
and exclusive representations made by Parent and the Sellers with respect to
any matters relating to Intellectual Property.

Section 3.16. Material Contracts.

(a) Schedule 3.16(a) sets forth a list of all Contracts (other than purchase
or service orders executed in the ordinary course of business or Contracts of
Parent or its Subsidiaries related

that is required to be listed in Schedule 3.16(a), being a "Material

machinery, equipment, materials, supplies or other personal property requiring
annual payments by such IPG Entity of $5,000,000 or more;

(ii) any Contract providing for the sale or license by any IPG Entity of
materials, supplies, goods, services, equipment or assets requiring annual

contains noncompetition covenants that prohibit any IPG Entity from freely
engaging in any business or in any geographic territory or market;

(iv) any mortgage, indenture, note, bond or other Contract relating to
indebtedness for borrowed money incurred by any IPG Entity in an amount in

license, consent or right to use, exploit or practice any Intellectual
Property owned by third parties (other than COTS Licenses), (B) whereby any
IPG Entity grants to a third party a license, consent or right to use, exploit
or practice any Business Intellectual Property (other than non-exclusive
licenses or sublicenses granted, and licenses or sublicenses to customers and
distributors in connection with the sale or license of products or services,
in each case, in the ordinary course of business consistent with past
practice), in each case, requiring annual payments of $250,000 or more, or (C)
regarding any settlement of any Intellectual Property-related Action (other

stock, sale of assets or otherwise) having an aggregate purchase price of
$7,500,000 or more; 

(viii) any Contract associated with hedges, derivatives or other similar
instruments, in each case, having a termination value in excess of $5,000,000;

(ix) any Contract requiring capital expenditures after the date hereof in
excess of $2,500,000.

(b) Each Material Contract set forth in Schedule 3.16(a) is a valid and
binding agreement of the IPG Entity party thereto, enforceable in accordance
with its terms, except as limited by Laws affecting the enforcement of
creditors' rights generally, by general equitable principles or by the
discretion of any Governmental Authority before which any Action seeking
enforcement may be brought, except as would not reasonably be expected,
individually or in the aggregate, to result in material Liability to the IPG
Entities, taken as a whole, or otherwise materially interfere with the conduct
of the Business in substantially the manner currently conducted. None of the
IPG Entities are in breach of or default under, or have received any written
notice of any default or event that, with notice or lapse of time, or both,
would constitute a breach or default by the IPG Entities under any Material
Contract, except for any breach or default that would not reasonably be
expected, individually or in the aggregate, to result in material Liability to
the IPG Entities, taken as a whole, or otherwise materially interfere with the
conduct of the Business in substantially the manner currently conducted. To
the knowledge of the Sellers, no other party to a Material Contract is in
breach of or default under any such Material Contract, except as would not
reasonably be expected, individually or in the aggregate, to result in
material Liability to the IPG Entities, taken as a whole, or otherwise
materially interfere with the conduct of the Business in substantially the
manner currently conducted.

(c) True and complete copies of each Material Contract, including all material
amendments, modifications, supplements, exhibits, schedules and addenda
thereto through the date of this Agreement, have been made available to Buyer
prior to the date hereof; provided, however, that any amendments,
modifications, supplements, exhibits, schedules and addenda to such Material
Contracts that do not otherwise materially amend, modify or otherwise waive
any provisions of such Material Contracts have been provided only to the
extent in Parent's possession and readily available.

Section 3.17. Insurance. Parent has previously made available to Buyer true
and correct summaries of all material policies of property, liability,
workers' compensation and other forms of insurance owned or held by Parent on
behalf of the IPG Entities (not including any IPG Plan or any New IPG Plan).
Except as would not reasonably be expected, individually or in the aggregate,
to result in material Liability to the IPG Entities, taken as a whole, or
otherwise materially interfere with the conduct of the Business in
substantially the manner currently conducted, (a) all such policies are in
full force and effect, all premiums due and payable have been paid, no written
notice of cancellation or termination has been received with respect to any
such policy, and there is no existing 

default with respect to any such policy, and (b) there is no material claim by
Parent, the Sellers or the IPG Entities pending under any such policy as to
which coverage has been denied or disputed by the underwriters of such policy
or in respect of which such underwriters have reserved their rights.

Section 3.18. Real Property.

(a) Schedule 3.18(a)(i) sets forth an accurate and complete list of the Owned
Real Property that is material to the Business(the "Scheduled Owned Real
Property"). Schedule 3.18(a)(ii) sets forth an accurate and complete list of
the Leased Real Property that contains manufacturing and assembly facilities
(the "Scheduled Leased Real Property" and, together with the Scheduled Owned
Real Property, the "Scheduled Real Property").

(b) The Real Property owned or leased by the IPG Entities constitutes all the
material real property that is used or held for use primarily in the conduct
of the Business as currently conducted. No Person other than the IPG Entities
has the right to use the Scheduled Real Property and there are no shared
facilities or services at the Scheduled Real Property which are used in
connection with any Retained Business. There are no pending or, to the
knowledge of the Sellers, threatened condemnation proceedings, expropriation
or other proceeding in eminent domain with respect to any Scheduled Real
Property. With respect to the Scheduled Owned Real Property, (i) the IPG
Entities have good and marketable indefeasible fee simple title to such Owned
Real Property, free and clear of all liens and encumbrances, except Permitted
Liens and (ii) other than the rights of Buyer pursuant to this Agreement, to
the knowledge of the Sellers, there are no outstanding options, rights of
first offer or rights of first refusal to purchase such Scheduled Owned Real
Property or any portion thereof or interest therein.

(c) Schedule 3.18(c) sets forth an accurate and complete list of any lease
covering Scheduled Leased Real Property (the "Leases"). Each Lease is a valid
and binding agreement of the IPG Entity party thereto, enforceable in
accordance with its terms, except as limited by Laws affecting the enforcement
of creditors' rights generally, by general equitable principles or by the
discretion of any Governmental Authority before which any Action seeking
enforcement may be brought, and except as would not reasonably be expected,
individually or in the aggregate, to result in material Liability to the IPG
Entities, taken as a whole, or otherwise materially interfere with the conduct
of the Business in substantially the manner currently conducted. None of the
IPG Entities are in default of, or have received any written notice of any
default or event that, with notice or lapse of time, or both, would constitute
a default by the IPG Entities under any Lease, except as would not reasonably
be expected, individually or in the aggregate, to result in material Liability
to the IPG Entities, taken as a whole, or otherwise materially interfere with
the conduct of the Business in substantially the manner currently conducted.
To the knowledge of the Sellers, no other party to a Lease is in default of
such Lease, except for any such defaults that would not reasonably 

be expected, individually or in the aggregate, result in material Liability to
the IPG Entities, taken as a whole, or otherwise materially interfere with the
conduct of the Business in substantially the manner currently conducted.
Parent has delivered to Buyer a true and complete copy of each Lease
(including all material amendments, extensions, renewals, guaranties and other
agreements with respect thereto) to the extent in Parent's possession and
readily available. No IPG Entities' possession and quiet enjoyment of the
Scheduled Leased Real Property under any Lease has been disturbed, and to the
knowledge of the Sellers, there are no disputes pending or threatened with
respect to any Lease. Other than (i) those agreements, arrangements or
understandings that are contemplated by this Agreement and the other
Transaction Documents, including the Transition Services Agreement, the
License Agreement and the Reverse Transition Services Agreement, (ii) those
agreements, arrangements or understandings that are contemplated by or
otherwise addressed in the Reorganization Documents, (iii) the Affiliate
Transactions and (iv) subleases, licenses or rights to use or occupy that
would be not reasonably be expected, individually or in the aggregate, to
materially interfere with the conduct of the Business in substantially the
manner currently conducted, no IPG Entity has subleased, licensed or otherwise
granted any Person the right to use or occupy any Real Property or any portion
thereof.

Section 3.19. Title to Assets; Sufficiency of Assets.

interests in, or a valid license to occupy, all Transferred Assets and all
assets and properties of such IPG Entity reflected on the Balance Sheet or
acquired after the Balance Sheet Date (other than assets or properties
disposed of in the ordinary course of business consistent with past practice),
in each case, free and clear of all Liens other than Permitted Liens, except
as has not had and would not reasonably be expected to have, individually or
in the aggregate, a Material Adverse Effect.

(b) The assets, properties, rights, titles and interests of the IPG Entities,
together with (i) the Trade Intercompany Arrangements, (ii) the Buyer
Designated Shared Contracts, and (iii) any assets, properties, rights, titles
and interests made available to Buyer or the IPG Entities following the

hereof or otherwise would give Buyer or the IPG Entities the unlimited right
to use thereof, including the Transition Services Agreement and the License
Agreement, constitute all of the assets, properties, rights, titles and
interests owned or held by Parent and its Subsidiaries and necessary to
operate the Business immediately following the Closing in all material
respects in substantially the manner conducted immediately prior to Closing;
provided, however, the foregoing is subject to the limitation that certain
transfers, assignments, licenses, sublicenses, leases and subleases, as the
case may be, of Contracts and Permits, and any claim or right or benefit
arising thereunder or resulting therefrom, may require consent of a Person or
Governmental Authority, which has not been obtained, and that such matters are
addressed elsewhere in this Agreement and the other Transaction Documents. 

Section 3.20. Related Party Transactions.

(a) To the knowledge of the Sellers, no executive officer or director of
Parent or its Subsidiaries (including any of the IPG Entities) is (i) party to
any material Contract or other business arrangement (other than employment,
retention or similar agreements and IPG Plans and New IPG Plans) with any IPG
Entity that is not terminable at will by the IPG Entity without payment or
penalty, or (ii) owns any material property or right, tangible or intangible

(b) There are no agreements, arrangements or understandings between Parent or
any Non-IPG Subsidiaries, on the one hand, and an IPG Entity, on the other
hand, that are material to the operation of the Business and that are not
terminable at will by such IPG Entity without payment or penalty ("Affiliate
Transactions"), other than (i) those agreements, arrangements or
understandings that are contemplated by this Agreement and the other
Transaction Documents, including the Transition Services Agreement, the
License Agreement and the Reverse Transition Services Agreement, (ii) those
agreements, arrangements or understandings that are contemplated by or
otherwise addressed in the Reorganization Documents, (iii) Trade Intercompany

confidentiality agreements, (ii) employment, retention or similar agreements
and (iii) any other Shared Contract that, if terminated, would not reasonably
be expected, individually or in the aggregate, to materially impair the
operation of the Business.

Section 3.21. Brokers. Except for fees payable to J.P. Morgan and Goldman
Sachs and Co., whose fees shall be paid by Parent and the Sellers, no Person is
or will be entitled to a broker's, finder's, investment banker's, financial
adviser's or similar fee from Parent or the Sellers or any Person acting on
their behalf in connection with this Agreement or any of the transactions
contemplated hereby.

material respects in accordance with (1) the Global Separation Agreement and
the other Reorganization Documents and (2) all applicable Laws. Parent has
made available to Buyer a true and complete copy of the Global Separation

including all amendments or modifications thereto, as in effect as of the date
hereof. Each of the Global Separation Agreement and each other material
Reorganization Document (a) is a valid and binding agreement of the parties

affecting the enforcement of creditors' rights generally, by general equitable
principles or by the discretion of any Governmental Authority before which any

enforcement may be brought, (b) has not been amended or modified and
represents the entire agreement between the parties thereto, and (c) is not
the subject of any lawsuits or other proceedings pending or, to the knowledge
of the Sellers, threatened by any Governmental Authority that seek the

parties to the Global Separation Agreement or any other material
Reorganization Document are in default of, or have received any written notice
of any default or event that, with notice or lapse of time, or both, would
constitute a default by the parties thereto.

Section 3.23. No Other Representations And Warranties. Except for the specific
representations and warranties contained in this Article III or other
Transaction Documents (including in any closing certificate furnished under
this Agreement with respect thereto), but in each case as modified by the
Disclosure Schedules hereto), none of Parent, the Sellers or any other Person
makes, and each of Parent and the Sellers disclaim, any express or implied
representation or warranty, including with respect to Parent or the Sellers,
or their respective Subsidiaries (including the IPG Entities) or the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement, and Parent and the Sellers
disclaim any other representations or warranties, whether made by Parent or

REPRESENTATIONS AND WARRANTIES OF BUYER

Buyer represents and warrants to Parent and the Sellers that:

Section 4.01. Organization and Qualification. Buyer is an exempted limited
liability company duly organized, validly existing and in good standing under
the laws of Bermuda. Buyer is duly qualified to do business (where such
concept is applicable) in each jurisdiction where the nature of its business
or the ownership of its assets makes such qualification necessary, except
where the failure to be so licensed or qualified would not reasonably be
expected, individually or in the aggregate, to interfere with, prevent or
materially delay the ability of Buyer to perform its obligations under this
Agreement or consummate the transactions contemplated hereby. Buyer has the
all requisite power and authority necessary to own or lease its properties and
assets and to carry on its business as presently conducted in all material
respects.

Section 4.02. Authorization. Buyer has all requisite corporate or equivalent
organizational powers and authority to execute and deliver this Agreement and
each other Transaction Document to be executed by Buyer and to perform its
obligations hereunder and thereunder and to consummate the transactions
contemplated on its part hereby and thereby. This Agreement and each
Transaction Document to be executed by Buyer has been duly authorized,
executed and delivered by Buyer and, assuming that this Agreement has been
duly and validly authorized, executed and delivered by the Sellers and Parent,
constitutes a valid and binding agreement of Buyer, enforceable against Buyer
in accordance with its terms, except as limited by Laws affecting the
enforcement of creditors' rights generally, by general equitable principles or
by the discretion of any Governmental Authority before which any Action
seeking enforcement may be brought (regardless of whether enforcement is
sought in a proceeding at law or in equity).

Section 4.03. Non-contravention. The execution, delivery and performance by
Buyer of this Agreement and the other Transaction Documents to be executed by
Buyer, and the consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby and
thereby, and the fulfillment of and the performance by Buyer of its
obligations hereunder and thereunder do not and will not (a) violate 

any provision of the Organizational Documents of Buyer, (b) violate or result
in a breach of, or constitute a default or require a consent under or give
rise to any right of termination or other action by any Person under, any
provision of any Contract to which Buyer is party, (c) assuming compliance
with the matters referred to in Section 4.04, violate or result in a breach of
any Law of any Governmental Authority applicable to Buyer, or (d) result in
the creation or imposition of any material Lien on any asset of Buyer (except,
in the case of clauses (b), (c) and (d), as would not reasonably be expected,
individually or in the aggregate, to interfere with, prevent or materially
delay the ability of Buyer to perform its obligations under this Agreement or
consummate the transactions contemplated by the Transaction Documents).

Section 4.04. Governmental Authorization. The execution, delivery and
performance by Buyer of this Agreement and other Transaction Documents to
which it is a party and the consummation of the transactions contemplated
hereby and thereby require no action by or in respect of, or consent from or
filing with, any Governmental Authority, other than (a) compliance with any
applicable requirements of the HSR Act and other Competition Laws, (b)
compliance with the regulatory requirements set forth in Schedule 4.04, and
(c) any such action or filing the failure of which to be made or obtained
would not reasonably be expected, individually or in the aggregate, to
interfere with, prevent or materially delay the ability of Buyer to perform
its obligations under this Agreement or consummate the transactions
contemplated by the Transaction Documents.

Section 4.05. Litigation. There are no Actions pending or, to the knowledge of
Buyer, threatened against Buyer by or before any Governmental Authority,
except for such Actions as would not reasonably be expected, individually or
in the aggregate, to interfere with, prevent or materially delay the ability
of Buyer to perform its obligations under this Agreement or the other
Transaction Documents or consummate the transactions contemplated hereby or
thereby. There is no order, writ, judgment, award, ruling injunction, decree
or consent decree entered by or with any Governmental Authority purporting to
enjoin or restrain the execution, delivery and performance by Buyer of this
Agreement or the other Transaction Documents or the transactions contemplated
hereby or that would reasonably be expected, individually or in the aggregate,
to interfere with, prevent or materially delay the ability of Buyer to perform
its obligations under this Agreement or the other Transaction Documents or
consummate the transactions contemplated hereby or thereby.

Section 4.06. Financing. Buyer has delivered to Parent a true and complete
copy of the executed Debt Commitment Letter and Equity Commitment Letter.
Neither of the Commitment Letters has been amended or modified in any manner
prior to the date of this Agreement. Neither Buyer nor any of its Affiliates
has entered into any agreement, side letter or other arrangement (other than
customary engagement letters and fee letters) relating to the financing of the
Closing Date Payments or the transactions contemplated by this Agreement,
other than as set forth in the Commitment Letters. The aggregate proceeds of
the Financing (both before and after giving effect to the exercise of any or
all "market flex" provisions related thereto), when funded, will be sufficient 

to consummate the transactions contemplated hereby, including the making of
all Closing Date Payments on the Closing Date. As of the date of this
Agreement, the respective commitments contained in the Commitment Letters have
not been withdrawn or rescinded in any respect. The Commitment Letters are in
full force and effect and represent a valid, binding and enforceable
obligation of Buyer and, to the Buyer's knowledge, each other party thereto,
to provide the financing contemplated thereby subject only to the satisfaction
or waiver of the Financing Conditions and except as limited by Laws affecting
the enforcement of creditors' rights generally, by general equitable
principles or by the discretion of any Governmental Authority before which any
Action seeking enforcement may be brought (regardless of whether enforcement
is sought in a proceeding at law or in equity). Buyer has fully paid (or
caused to be paid) any and all commitment fees and other amounts that are due
and payable on or prior to the date of this Agreement in connection with the
Financing. As of the date of this Agreement, no event has occurred which, with
or without notice, lapse of time or both, would constitute a breach or default
on the part of Buyer or, to the Buyer's knowledge, any other party thereto
under any of the Commitment Letters. There are no conditions precedent or
other contingencies related to the funding of the full amount of the
Financing, other than as set forth in the Debt Commitment Letter. As of the
date of this Agreement, to the knowledge of the Buyer, subject to the
satisfaction of the conditions set forth in Section 8.01 and Section 8.02, the
Buyer has no reason to believe that (i) any of the Financing Conditions will
not be satisfied or (ii) the Financing will not be made available to Buyer on
the Closing Date. Buyer understands and acknowledges that under the terms of
this Agreement, Buyer's obligation to consummate the acquisition is not in any
way contingent upon or otherwise subject to Buyer's consummation of any
financing arrangements, Buyer's obtaining of any financing or the
availability, grant, provision or extension of any financing to Buyer.

Section 4.07. Solvency. Buyer is not entering into this Agreement or the
transactions contemplated hereby with the actual intent to hinder, delay or
defraud present or future creditors of Buyer or any of its Affiliates.
Assuming (i) the satisfaction of the conditions set forth in Sections 8.01 and
8.02, and (ii) the most recent financial forecasts of the Business made
available to Buyer prior to the date hereof have been prepared in good faith
upon assumptions that were reasonable at such time (it being understood and
agreed that Parent is making no representation and warranty with respect
thereto as a result of such assumption in this clause (ii)) and after giving
effect to the transactions contemplated by this Agreement (including the
Financing), at and immediately after the Closing, Buyer and each of its
Subsidiaries (including each of the IPG Entities) will, on a consolidated
basis, (a) be solvent (in that both the fair value of its assets will not be
less than the sum of its indebtedness (including a reasonable estimate of any
contingent Liabilities) and that the present fair saleable value of its assets
will not be less than the amount required to pay its probable Liability on its
recourse indebtedness as such indebtedness matures or becomes due), (b) have
adequate capital and liquidity with which to engage in its business, and (c)
not have incurred and 

does not plan to incur indebtedness beyond its ability to pay as such
indebtedness matures or becomes due.

Section 4.08. Brokers. No Person is or will be entitled to a broker's,
finder's, investment banker's, financial adviser's or similar fee from Buyer
or any Person acting on its behalf in connection with this Agreement or any of
the transactions contemplated hereby for which Parent or any of its
Subsidiaries' shall have any Liability.

Section 4.09. Purchase for Investment. Buyer is purchasing the Equity
Interests for investment for its own account and not with a view to, or for
sale in connection with, any distribution thereof. Buyer (either alone or
together with its advisors) has sufficient knowledge and experience in
financial and business matters so as to be capable of evaluating the merits
and risks of its investment in the Equity Interests and is capable of bearing
the economic risks of such investment. Buyer acknowledges that the Equity
Interests have not been registered under any federal, state or foreign
securities Laws and that the Equity Interests may not be sold, transferred,
offered for sale, pledged, hypothecated or otherwise disposed of unless such
transfer, sale, assignment, pledge, hypothecation or other disposition is
registered under any federal, state or foreign securities Laws or is effected
pursuant to an exemption from registration under any federal, state or foreign
securities Laws.

Section 4.10. Acknowledgements by Buyer.

(d) Buyer acknowledges and agrees that it has conducted its own independent
review and analysis of the Business and the IPG Entities and their assets,
financial condition, results of operations and prospects. Buyer is an informed
and sophisticated purchaser, and has engaged expert advisors and
Representatives, experienced in the evaluation and purchase of companies,
property and assets such as the Business and the IPG Entities and their
properties and assets and the Equity Interests as contemplated hereunder.
Buyer has undertaken such investigation and has been provided with and has
evaluated such documents and information as it has deemed necessary to enable
it to make an informed and intelligent decision with respect to the execution,
delivery and performance of this Agreement and has relied solely upon its own
investigation and the express representations and warranties set forth in this
Agreement. Buyer acknowledges that Parent and the Sellers have given Buyer
access to the employees, documents and facilities of the Business and the IPG
Entities for the purpose of evaluating the transaction contemplated by the
Transaction Documents.

(e) Buyer acknowledges and agrees that none of the Sellers, Parent, the IPG
Entities, the Business or its or their Affiliates or any other Person acting
on behalf of them (i) has made any representation or warranty, express or
implied, including any implied representation or warranty as to the condition,
merchantability, suitability or fitness for a particular purpose of any assets
of or held by the Business or the IPG Entities, or (ii) has made any
representation or warranty, express 

or implied, as to the accuracy or completeness of any information regarding
the Business or the IPG Entities, in each case except as expressly set forth
in this Agreement.

(f) Buyer acknowledges and agrees that the properties and assets of the
Business and the IPG Entities are sold "as is", except as expressly set forth
in this Agreement or any other agreement or certificate executed and delivered
in connection herewith, including the Transaction Documents. Buyer agrees to
accept the properties and assets of the IPG Entities and the Business in the
condition they are in on the Closing Date based on its own inspection,
examination and determination with respect to all matters, and without
reliance upon any express or implied representations or warranties of any
nature made by or on behalf of or imputed to the Sellers or Parent, except as
expressly set forth in this Agreement or any other agreement or certificate
delivered in connection herewith, including the Transaction Documents.

(g) In connection with Buyer's investigation of the Business and the IPG
Entities, Buyer has received certain projections, including projected
statements of operating revenues and income from operations of the Business
and the IPG Entities and certain budget and business plan information. Buyer
acknowledges and agrees that there are uncertainties inherent in attempting to
make such estimates, projections and other forecasts and plans, and that Buyer
is familiar with such uncertainties and that Buyer is taking full
responsibility for making its own evaluation of the adequacy and accuracy of
all estimates, projections and other forecasts and plans so furnished to it,
including the reasonableness of the assumptions underlying such estimates,
projections and forecasts. Accordingly, Buyer acknowledges and agrees that,
except as expressly set forth herein, neither Parent nor the Sellers make any
representation or warranty with respect to such estimates, projections and
other forecasts and plans, including the reasonableness of the assumptions
underlying such estimates, budgets, projections and forecasts (or any
component thereof).

Section 4.11. No Intermediary Transaction Tax Shelter. Buyer has no plan or
intention to take any action with respect to the IPG Entities subsequent to
the Closing that would cause the transaction contemplated hereby to constitute
part of a transaction that is the same as, or substantially similar to, the
"Intermediary Transaction Tax Shelter" described in Internal Revenue Service
Notices 2001-16 and 2008-111.

Section 4.12. Limited Guaranty. Concurrently with the execution of this
Agreement, the Guarantor has delivered to Parent the Limited Guaranty dated as
of the date hereof. The Limited Guaranty is in full force and effect and is a
valid and binding obligation of the Guarantor, enforceable against the
Guarantor in accordance with its terms, except as limited by Laws affecting
the enforcement of creditors' rights generally, by general equitable
principles or by the discretion of any Governmental Authority before which any
Action seeking enforcement may be brought (regardless of whether enforcement
is sought in a proceeding at law or in equity). As of the date 

of this Agreement, no event has occurred which, with or without notice, lapse
of time or both, would constitute a default on the part of Guarantor under the
Limited Guaranty.

Without in any way limiting any Party's rights or obligations under this
Agreement, the Parties understand and agree that prior to Closing nothing
contained in this Agreement shall give Buyer, directly or indirectly, the
right to control or direct the operation of the IPG Entities, and prior to
Closing, Parent, the Sellers and the IPG Entities shall exercise, consistent
with the terms and conditions of this Agreement, complete control and
supervision over their respective businesses and operations.

Promptly following the date hereof, Parent shall establish a project team
representing the IPG Entities (a "Transition Team") and designate one or more
representatives to serve as the Buyer contact for such Transition Team. Buyer
shall also promptly designate one or more representatives to serve as the
Parent contact on Buyer's behalf. As soon as reasonably practicable following
the date hereof, Parent and Buyer shall prepare jointly with respect to the
IPG Entities a detailed implementation plan with respect to the transformation
of the IPG Entities into self-supported entities, which shall include the
identification of, from among those activities and functions set forth in
Exhibit G to this Agreement, activities and functions critical to the ongoing
operation of the Business in a manner substantially similar to the manner in
which the Business was operated prior to the Closing Date ("Tier 1
Activities"). The other activities and functions from among those set forth on
Exhibit G to this Agreement that are required to be separated and functioning
as of the Closing Date are referred to herein as "Tier 2 Activities". Parent
and its Subsidiaries shall use 

commercially reasonable efforts to transition the Tier 1 Activities and Tier 2
Activities from Parent and its Subsidiaries (other than the IPG Entities) to
the IPG Entities or their respective service providers by the Closing Date. In
the event any Tier 1 Activity is not capable of being separated by the Closing
Date, Parent shall assist Buyer with the performance of such activity by
either (a) providing an applicable service under the Transition Services
Agreement, which services shall be provided on terms to be negotiated by the
Parties in good faith with respect to (i) the duration such service will be
provided, which shall not be longer than the term of the Transition Services
Agreement, and (ii) the fees for such service, which shall be set in a manner
consistent with the methodology set forth in Section 2.1(c) of the Transition
Services Agreement, or (b) ensuring that a third party service provider is
engaged by the IPG Entities to perform such Tier 1 Activity, it being
understood that Parent shall use commercially reasonable efforts to obtain
market rates from such third party service provider. With respect to the Tier
2 Activities, Parent and its Subsidiaries shall either assist Buyer with the
performance of such Tier 2 Activity, or identify to Buyer third party service
providers which may provide recipient with any services required, or
alternatively, if such services are in-sourced by Buyer through temporary
employees, Parent will provide reasonable training to such temporary
employees.

Section 5.02. Pre-Closing Access and Information.

(d) From the date hereof until the Closing Date, Parent and the Sellers shall,
and shall cause the IPG Entities to, (i) afford Buyer and its Representatives
reasonable access to the offices, properties, books and records of Parent, the
Sellers and the IPG Entities relating to the Business and to such personnel,
officers and other facilities and properties of the IPG Entities as Buyer may
reasonably request during normal business hours and upon reasonable prior
written notice (which may be provided via e-mail), (ii) furnish to Buyer and
its Representatives such financial and operating data and other information
relating to the Business as such Persons may reasonably request and (iii)
cause the employees, counsel and financial advisors of Parent, the Sellers and
the IPG Entities to cooperate with Buyer solely in connection with clauses (i)
and (ii) above; provided, that Buyer acknowledges that such books and records,
data and other information may be provided by Parent, the Sellers and the IPG
Entities in a manner consistent with the information provided to Buyer prior
to the date hereof; provided, further, that such investigation shall be
conducted in such manner as not to unreasonably interfere with the conduct of
the business of Parent, the Sellers and the IPG Entities.

(e) Notwithstanding the foregoing, (i) Buyer shall not have access to (A)
personnel records of the Business Employees, including records relating to
individual performance or evaluation records, medical histories, individual
employee benefit information or other information which Parent believes in
good faith is sensitive information relating to personnel or the disclosure of
which could subject the Parent, the Sellers, the IPG Entities or any of their
respective Affiliates to risk of Liability, (B) any properties of Parent, the
Sellers, the IPG Entities or any of their respective 

Affiliates for purposes of conducting any environmental sampling or testing,
(C) any information to the extent (but only to the extent) relating to the
Retained Businesses, or (D) any Seller Group Tax Return or any work papers
related thereto, and (ii) Parent, the Sellers and the IPG Entities and their
respective Affiliates may withhold (A) any information relating to the sale
process, bids received from other Persons in connection with the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement and information and analysis (including
financial analysis) relating to such bids, and (B) any document or
information, the disclosure of which could reasonably be expected, upon the
advice of counsel, to violate any Contract or any Law, result in the loss of
protectable interests in trade secrets, or result in the waiver of any legal
privilege or work-product privilege (provided, that, in the case of this
clause (B), Parent shall give notice to Buyer of the fact that such documents
or information are being withheld and thereafter Parent shall cooperate in
good faith to cause such documents or information, as applicable, to be made
available in a manner that would not reasonably be expected to cause such a
violation, disclosure or waiver).

(f) Parent, the Sellers and the IPG Entities shall have the right to have one
or more Representatives present at all times during any such inspections,
interviews and examinations. Buyer shall hold in confidence all such
information disclosed, whether before or after the date hereof, pursuant to
the terms and subject to the conditions contained in the Confidentiality
Agreement and such information shall not be used by any Person, other than in
connection with the transactions contemplated hereby or as otherwise expressly
permitted by the Confidentiality Agreement. Notwithstanding anything to the
contrary contained herein, prior to Closing, without the prior written consent
of Parent, which may be withheld in its sole discretion, Buyer shall not
contact any Business Employees or any vendors to, or customers of, Parent, the
Sellers, the IPG Entities or any of their respective Affiliates regarding the
Business, this Agreement or the transactions contemplated hereby.
Notwithstanding the foregoing, Buyer shall be permitted to, upon reasonable
notice, contact corporate executive-level Business Employees in leadership
positions to the extent reasonably necessary to permit Buyer to implement
transition plans to operate the Business from and after the Closing; provided,
that, prior to Closing, prior consent of Parent shall be required for any
discussions relating to compensation or the terms and conditions of
employment. In no event shall Buyer contact any vendors to, or customers of,
Parent and the Sellers or any of their respective Affiliates about the
Retained Businesses as part of such inspections, interviews and examinations.

Section 5.03. Efforts; Regulatory Filings.

(k) Subject to the terms and conditions of this Agreement, each Party shall
use its reasonable best efforts to take, or cause to be taken, all actions and
to do, or cause to be done, all things necessary or desirable under applicable
Law to consummate the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, including
(i) preparing and filing as promptly as practicable with any Governmental
Authority all documentation necessary to effect all filings, notices,
petitions, 

statements, registrations, submissions of information, applications and other
documents and (ii) obtaining and maintaining all approvals, consents,
registrations, permits, authorizations and other confirmations, in each case,
required to be made with or obtained from any Governmental Authority that are
necessary, proper or advisable to consummate the transactions contemplated by
this Agreement (collectively, the "Regulatory Approvals"). In furtherance and
not in limitation of the foregoing, each Party and their respective Affiliates
shall not extend any waiting period or comparable period under the HSR Act or
any other Competition Law or enter into any agreement with any Governmental
Authority not to consummate the transactions contemplated hereby, except with
the prior written consent of the other Party hereto.

(l) In furtherance and not in limitation of the foregoing, each Party shall,
and shall cause their respective Affiliates to, (i) make or cause to be made
all filings required of such Party or any of its Affiliates under the HSR Act
and the other Competition Laws of the jurisdictions set forth in Schedule
5.03(b) with respect to the transactions contemplated hereby as promptly as
practicable and, in any event, with respect to any such filings required under
the HSR Act, within ten (10) Business Days after the date hereof, (ii) comply
at the earliest practicable date with any request under the HSR Act and any
other Competition Law for additional information, documents, or other
materials received by such Party or any of its Affiliates from any
Governmental Authority in respect of such filings or such transactions (each,
a "Second Request"), and (iii) cooperate with the other Parties in connection
with any such filing and in connection with resolving any investigation or
other inquiry of any Governmental Authority under the HSR Act or any other
Competition Laws with respect to any such filing or any such transaction. Each
Party shall use its reasonable best efforts to furnish to the other Parties
all information required for any application or other filing to be made
pursuant to any applicable Law in connection with the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement (including, to the extent permitted by Law,
responding to any reasonable requests for copies of documents filed with the
non-filing Party's prior filings). Any Party may, as it deems advisable and
necessary, reasonably designate any competitively sensitive material provided
to the other Parties under this Section 5.03 as "outside counsel only." Such
materials and the information contained therein shall be given only to the
outside legal counsel of the recipient, and the recipient shall cause such
outside counsel not to disclose such materials or information to any
employees, officers, directors or other Representatives of the recipient or
their Affiliates, unless express written permission is obtained in advance
from the source of the materials. Each Party shall promptly inform the other
Parties of any oral communication with, and provide copies of written
communications with, any Governmental Authority regarding any such filings or
any such transaction. No Party shall independently participate in any formal
meeting with any Governmental Authority in respect of any such filings,
investigation, or other inquiry without giving the other Party prior notice of
the meeting and, to the extent permitted by such Governmental Authority, the
opportunity to attend and/or participate. Subject to applicable Law, the
Parties will consult and cooperate with one another in connection with any
analyses, appearances, presentations, 

memoranda, briefs, arguments, opinions and proposals made or submitted by or
on behalf of any Party relating to proceedings under the HSR Act or any other
Competition Laws. Buyer shall pay all filing fees in connection with all
filings under the HSR Act and other applicable Competition Laws.

(m) In furtherance and not in limitation of the actions and obligations
described in Section 5.03(b), each Party shall use its reasonable best efforts
to resolve such objections, if any, as may be asserted by any Governmental
Authority with respect to the transactions contemplated by this Agreement
under the HSR Act and other applicable Competition Laws. In connection
therewith, if any Action is instituted (or threatened to be instituted)
challenging any transaction contemplated by this Agreement as in violation of
the HSR Act or any other Competition Law, each Party shall use its reasonable
best efforts to contest and resist any such Action, and to have vacated,
lifted, reversed, or overturned any decree, judgment, injunction or other
order, whether temporary, preliminary or permanent, that is in effect and that
prohibits, prevents, limits or restricts consummation of the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement, including by pursuing all available avenues of
administrative and judicial appeal, unless, by mutual agreement, the Parties
decide that litigation is not in their respective best interests. Each Party
shall use its reasonable best efforts to take such action as may be required
to cause the expiration of the notice periods under the HSR Act and other
applicable Competition Laws with respect to such transactions as promptly as
possible after the execution of this Agreement.

(n) Buyer further agrees that it shall, to the extent necessary to obtain the
waiver or consent from any Governmental Authority required to satisfy the
conditions set forth in Section 8.01(a) or Section 8.01(b), as applicable, or
to avoid the entry of or have lifted, vacated or terminated any Closing Legal
Impediment, take the following actions: (i) propose, negotiate, offer to
commit and effect (and if such offer is accepted, commit to and effect), by
consent decree, hold separate order or otherwise, and in connection with the
consummation of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement and the other
Transaction Documents, the sale, divestiture or disposition (including by
licensing any Intellectual Property) of any assets of the Business and/or any
other assets or businesses of Buyer or any of its Subsidiaries (or equity
interests held by Buyer or any of its Subsidiaries in entities with assets or
businesses); (ii) terminate any existing relationships and contractual rights
and obligations; (iii) otherwise offer to take or offer to commit to take any
action which it is capable of taking and, if the offer is accepted, take or
commit to take such action, that limits its freedom of action with respect to,
or its ability to retain, any of the assets of the Business and/or any other
assets or businesses of Buyer or any of its Subsidiaries (or equity interests
held by Buyer or any of its Subsidiaries in entities with assets or
businesses); and (iv) take promptly, in the event that any permanent or
preliminary injunction or other order is entered or becomes reasonably
foreseeable to be entered in any Action that would make consummation of the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement and the other Transaction
Documents unlawful or that would prevent or materially delay consummation of
the transactions contemplated by this 

Agreement and the other Transaction Documents, any and all steps (including
the appeal thereof, the posting of a bond or the taking of the steps
contemplated by clauses (i), (ii) and (iii) of this Section 5.03(d)) necessary
to vacate, modify or suspend such injunction or order. For the avoidance of
doubt, Buyer's obligations under this Section 5.03(d) shall be absolute and
not qualified by "reasonable best efforts." For the further avoidance of
doubt, the Parties agree that Parent's and Sellers' obligations under this
Section 5.03 shall not include any obligation on the part of Parent, the
Sellers or their respective Affiliates to commit to or effect, by consent
decree, hold separate orders, trust or otherwise the sale or disposition of
such of its assets or businesses (including the Business) as may be required
to be divested in order to avoid the entry of, or to effect the dissolution
of, any decree, order, judgment, injunction, temporary restraining order or
other order in any suit or preceding, that would otherwise have the effect of
preventing, materially delaying or limiting the consummation of the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement.

(o) The IPG Equity Sellers shall be responsible, at their sole cost and
expense, for compliance prior to, at and after the Closing with all applicable
requirements of the New Jersey Industrial Site Recovery Act in connection with
the transactions contemplated by this Agreement.

Section 5.04. Post-Closing Financial Statements. Buyer shall use commercially
reasonable efforts to deliver to Parent pursuant to Parent's established
closing cycle and reporting deadlines (which, for the avoidance of doubt, is
no later than five (5) Business Days after the end of the applicable reporting
period), the normal quarter and month-end financial information of the type
that the Business provided to Parent via its financial reporting system for
past reporting periods, covering the period ending as of the Closing Date.

Section 5.05. Shared Contracts; Affiliate Transactions.

(a) The Parties shall, and shall cause their respective Subsidiaries to,
cooperate and shall use their commercially reasonable efforts to cause the
Shared Contracts set forth in Schedule 5.05(a) (the "Buyer Designated Shared
Contracts") to be replaced with separate contracts (the "Buyer Replacement
Contracts") intended to provide Buyer or any IPG Entity with contract rights
and obligations that are substantially similar in the aggregate (taking into
account changes in volume and similar pricing metrics, as well as the needs of
Buyer and the IPG Entities) to those contract rights and obligations utilized
by Parent or its Subsidiaries under the Buyer Designated Shared Contracts in
the conduct of the Business prior to the Closing. Buyer shall be solely
responsible for any additional costs or fees arising from and under a Buyer
Replacement Contract, or in connection with any arrangement with respect
thereto described in this Section 5.05(a) (other than any additional costs or
fees incurred by Parent or a Non-IPG Subsidiary due to a change in volume or
similar pricing metrics as a result of the Buyer Designated Shared Contracts
being replaced by the Buyer Replacement Contracts). The Parties shall
cooperate and provide each other with reasonable assistance in effecting such
separation of the Buyer Designated Shared Contracts prior to the Closing 

and for a period of ninety (90) days following the Closing. If the Parties are
not able to effect the separation of a Buyer Designated Shared Contract prior
to the Closing, then, until the date that is ninety (90) days following the
Closing or the earlier date on which such Buyer Designated Shared Contract is
separated, to the extent permissible under Law and under the terms of such
Buyer Designated Shared Contract, (i) at the sole cost and expense of Buyer,
Parent or the applicable Non-IPG Subsidiary shall continue to perform the
obligations under such Buyer Designated Shared Contract relating to the
Business, (ii) Parent or the applicable Non-IPG Subsidiary shall hold in trust
for the benefit of Buyer, and shall promptly forward to Buyer, any monies or
other benefits received pursuant to such Buyer Designated Shared Contract
relating to the Business and (iii) the Parties shall use commercially
reasonable efforts to institute alternative arrangements intended to put the
Parties in a substantially similar economic position as if such Buyer
Designated Shared Contract were separated. Buyer shall be solely responsible
for replacing any Buyer Designated Shared Contracts to the extent such Shared
Contracts are not separated or transitioned hereunder. With respect to
Liabilities pursuant to, under or relating to a given Buyer Designated Shared
Contract, such Liabilities shall, unless otherwise allocated pursuant to this
Agreement or a Buyer Replacement Contract, be allocated from time to time
between Parent and the Non-IPG Subsidiaries, on the one hand, and Buyer and
the IPG Entities, on the other hand, as the case may be, based on the relative
proportions of total benefits received (to the extent the Liabilities relate
to a specific period, over such period, and otherwise over the term of the
applicable Buyer Designated Shared Contract, measured up to the date of the
allocation, without duplication) by Parent and the Non-IPG Subsidiaries, on
the one hand, or Buyer and the IPG Entities, on the other hand, under the
relevant Buyer Designated Shared Contract. Notwithstanding the foregoing, each
Party shall be solely responsible for any and all Liabilities to the extent
arising out of or relating to such Party's (or its Subsidiaries') breach of
any such Buyer Designated Share Contract. Notwithstanding anything to the
contrary herein, Parent and the Sellers shall not, and shall cause the IPG
Entities not to, enter into any new Shared Contract for the provision of goods
and/or services that require expenditures by the Business in excess of
$500,000 individually, except for those Shared Contracts that are necessary to
establish a standalone office structure for the IPG Entities.

(b) Except (i) as contemplated by this Agreement and the other Transaction
Documents, including the Transition Services Agreement, the License Agreement
and the Reverse Transition Services Agreement, (ii) as contemplated by the
Reorganization Documents, (iii) for Trade Intercompany Arrangements and the
Participations Intercompany Loan (each of which shall continue in effect in
accordance with its terms), or (iv) as otherwise set forth in Schedule
5.05(b), Buyer acknowledges and agrees that all Affiliate Transactions, and
all rights and obligations of the Business or the IPG Entities under Contracts
with respect thereto, will be terminated at or prior to the Closing, with no
further Liability of Parent or the Non-IPG Subsidiaries, on the one hand, or
Buyer or the IPG Entities, on the other hand, with respect thereto. 

(c) Except as set forth in Schedule 5.05(c), Parent shall cause all
Intercompany Balances with respect to the Business to be eliminated by
discharge or otherwise in their entirety effective on or prior to the Closing.

Section 5.06. Third Party Approvals and Permits.

(f) Except with respect to Regulatory Approvals which are addressed in Section
5.03, and the Shared Contracts which are addressed in Section 5.05, subject to
the terms and conditions of this Agreement, prior to the Closing, each Party
shall, and shall cause its respective Subsidiaries to, use commercially
reasonable efforts to (i) obtain the consents, waivers, approvals, orders and
authorizations (the "Third Party Approvals") necessary to transfer and assign
the rights under Contracts that are material to the operation of the Business
that require any such consent, waiver, approval, order or authorization (each,
a "Non-Assignable Contract"), and (ii) provide all notices and otherwise take
all actions to transfer, reissue or obtain any Permits required to be
transferred, reissued or obtained as a result of or in furtherance of the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement and that are material to the
operation of the Business. To the extent that any Third Party Approval or
Permit has not been obtained prior to Closing, for up to ninety (90) days
after the Closing Date, each Party shall use its commercially reasonable
efforts, at the other Party's request, to endeavor to obtain such Third Party
Approval or Permit. Notwithstanding the foregoing, neither Party shall be
required to incur any Liabilities or provide any financial accommodation, in
order to obtain any such Third Party Approval or Permit with respect to the
transfer or assignment of any such Non-Assignable Contract or the issuance of
any such Permit.

(g) To the extent permitted by applicable Law and the terms of such Non-
Assignable Contract or Permit, in the event any Third Party Approval or Permit
has not been obtained by Closing, at the request of the Party to whom such
Non-Assignable Contract is contemplated to be transferred or by whom such
Permit is contemplated to be obtained (the "Receiving Party"), the Party
contemplated to be transferring such Non-Assignable Contract or Permit under
this Agreement (the "Transferring Party") shall hold in trust for the
Receiving Party, as applicable, the relevant Non-Assignable Contract or Permit
until such time as the Third Party Approval or Permit is obtained, but in no
event longer than one hundred eighty (180) days after the Closing Date. During
such time period, the Transferring Party shall comply with all applicable
covenants and obligations under the Non-Assignable Contract or Permit,
including the payment of any costs or expenses in connection therewith, which
shall be performed by the Transferring Party for the Receiving Party's account
and the Receiving Party shall promptly (but in no event later than thirty (30)
days following receipt of an invoice from the Transferring Party) reimburse
the Transferring Party for any out-of-pocket costs, expenses or payments made
by the Transferring Party in respect of such Non-Assignable Contract or
Permit. For the period not to exceed one hundred eighty (180) days after the
Closing Date, to the extent permitted by applicable Law and the terms of the
Non-Assignable Contract or Permit, the Receiving Party shall be entitled to
receive all of the benefits of the Transferring Party 

under the Non-Assignable Contract or Permit. The Receiving Party agrees to
indemnify and hold the Transferring Party and its Subsidiaries, agents,
successors and assigns harmless from and against any and all Liabilities based
upon, arising out of or relating to the performance of, or failure to perform,
any obligations under the Non-Assignable Contract or Permit that are for the
benefit of the Receiving Party. Notwithstanding the foregoing, following the
Closing Date, a Transferring Party shall have no obligation to renew any Non-
Assignable Contract or Permit upon the expiration or termination thereof. In
addition, to the extent that any Non-Assignable Contract contains an
"evergreen" provision that automatically renews such Non-Assignable Contract
unless terminated or cancelled by either party thereto, a Transferring Party
shall not be prohibited from terminating or canceling such Non-Assignable
Contract as permitted pursuant to the terms thereof upon the next occurring
renewal term thereof occurring following the Closing by providing the
Receiving Party with thirty (30) days prior written notice.

Section 5.07. Business Guarantees. Parent, the Seller and Buyer shall
cooperate and use their respective commercially reasonable efforts to obtain
from the respective beneficiary, in form and substance reasonably satisfactory
to Parent, on or before the Closing, valid and binding written releases of
Parent and its Subsidiaries, as applicable, from any Liability, whether
arising before, on or after the Closing Date, under any Business Guarantees
listed on Schedule 5.07 (which Parent shall be permitted to update from time
to time prior to Closing to reflect existing (but only to the extent any such
additional existing Business Guarantees do not exceed $5,000,000 in the
aggregate), new or replacement Business Guarantees entered into in the
ordinary course of business) (each a "Scheduled Guarantee") in effect as of
the Closing, which shall be effective as of the Closing, including, as
applicable, by providing substitute guarantees, furnishing letters of credit,
instituting escrow agreements, posting surety or performance bonds or making
other arrangements as the counterparty may reasonably request. If any
Scheduled Guarantee has not been released as of the Closing Date, then Parent,
the Sellers and Buyer shall use their respective commercially reasonable
efforts after the Closing to cause each such unreleased Scheduled Guarantee to
be released promptly. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary herein, the
Parties acknowledge and agree that at any time on or after the Closing Date,
Parent and its Subsidiaries may, in such Person's sole discretion, take any
action to terminate, obtain release of or otherwise limit their Liability
under any and all outstanding Scheduled Guarantees. Buyer shall indemnify and
hold harmless Parent and its Subsidiaries from and after the Closing for any
amounts required to be paid under any Business Guarantees.

Section 5.08. Use of ITW Marks.

(a) Buyer agrees that, except as set forth in this Section 5.08 and in the
License Agreement, Buyer has, and after the Closing, the IPG Entities will
have, no right, title, interest, license or any other right whatsoever in the
ITW Marks (except for Transferred Marks), and that none of Parent, the Sellers
or any of their respective Affiliates have assigned such right, title,
interest, 

license or other right to Buyer or the IPG Entities. After the Closing,
Parent, the Non-IPG Subsidiaries and Sellers shall (i) have no right, title,
interest, license or any other right whatsoever in any marks, names, logos, or
Internet addresses or domain names that are included in the Transferred Assets
or owned by any of the IPG Entities, or any derivations or translations
thereof (the "Transferred Marks"), (ii) cease all use of the Transferred
Marks, including to the extent such Transferred Marks are used in combination
with or as part of the ITW Marks (collectively, the "Combined Marks"), and
(iii) promptly abandon all registrations and applications for any Combined
Marks and not use any Combined Marks (except for Internet addresses and domain
names for any Combined Marks solely for purposes of re-directing traffic to
websites of Buyer and the IPG Entities in accordance with the Transition
Services Agreement).

(b) For a period of six (6) months following the Closing Date, Buyer and the
IPG Entities shall have the right to continue to sell inventory and use the
marketing and promotional materials, invoices, price lists, business cards,
schedules, displays, signs, stationery, technical guidelines, product manuals,
packaging materials, inventory, other supplies and similar materials
(collectively, "Existing Materials"), that were previously created in
connection with the Business and that incorporate the ITW Marks, solely in the
manner such Existing Materials were sold or used in the Business prior to
Closing; provided, however, that as promptly as practicable after Closing, but
in no event after the conclusion of such six (6) month period, Buyer shall,
and shall cause the IPG Entities to, except as set forth in the last sentence
of this Section 5.08(b), cease and discontinue any use of the ITW Marks and,
to the extent reasonably feasible, at Buyer's sole cost and expense, remove
all ITW Marks from all such Existing Materials, in each case, whether such
Existing Materials are held by Buyer or the IPG Entities or under the control
of Buyer or the IPG Entities. Notwithstanding the foregoing, following the
Closing Date, Buyer and the IPG Entities may use the ITW Marks in a non-
trademark manner to refer to Parent, the non-IPG Subsidiaries or Sellers as
previous owners of the Business or former Affiliates of the IPG Entities.

(c) Before the Closing, Parent, the Sellers and their respective Subsidiaries
(including the IPG Entities) may execute and file all documents as shall be
necessary or desirable to change the name of the IPG Entities to remove the
words "ITW" or "Illinois Tool Works," or any derivation or translation thereof
from such names. To the extent not already changed by Parent, the Sellers or
their respective Subsidiaries (including the IPG Entities), as promptly as
practicable after the Closing but in no event later than two (2) weeks after
the Closing Date (with respect to U.S. entities) and three (3) months after
the Closing Date (with respect to non-U.S. entities), Buyer shall, and shall
cause the IPG Entities to, at Buyer's sole cost and expense, change the names
of the IPG Entities to remove the words "ITW" or "Illinois Tool Works," or any
derivation or translation thereof, including filings with the applicable
Governmental Authority of each jurisdiction in which the ownership or the
operation of the IPG Entities' assets or the character of its activities is
such as to require it to be licensed or qualified in such jurisdiction, and
providing notice to all customers, vendors and other suppliers of such name
change. 

Section 5.09. Insurance.

(h) Parent and the Sellers shall, and shall cause the IPG Entities to,
continue to carry their existing insurance policies with respect to the
Business prior to the Closing, and shall use their respective commercially
reasonable efforts not to cause any material breach, default or cancellation
(other than expiration and replacement of policies in the ordinary course of
business consistent with past practice) of such insurance policies to occur or
exist. Except as otherwise provided by this Section 5.09, Buyer acknowledges
that from and after the Closing neither Buyer nor any of the IPG Entities
shall have access to any insurance policies of Parent, the Sellers or any of
the Non-IPG Subsidiaries or any of their respective self-insurance programs,
regardless of whether such policies were applicable to the Business prior to
the Closing; provided, however, that insurance policies obtained solely at and
by an IPG Entity shall remain in effect.

(i) Parent agrees that with respect to acts, omissions, events or
circumstances relating to the IPG Entities or the Business that occurred or
existed prior to the Closing and that are covered by third party occurrence-
based insurance policies under which the IPG Entities or the Business are
insured on or prior to Closing, the IPG Entities may make claims under such
occurrence-based policies subject to the terms and conditions of such
occurrence-based policies and this Agreement; provided, that Buyer and the IPG
Entities (i) shall notify the risk management department of Parent in writing
of all such covered claims and (ii) except as otherwise provided by this
Agreement, shall exclusively bear, and neither Parent, the Sellers nor any of
their respective Affiliates shall have any obligation to repay or reimburse
Buyer or any IPG Entity for, the amount of any deductibles, self-insured
retentions or other out-of-pocket expenses incurred in connection therewith
associated with claims under such occurrence-based policies, and shall be
liable for all uninsured or uncollectible amounts of such claims.

Section 5.10. Legal Proceedings; Production of Witnesses; Privileged Matters.

(c) Subject to Article IX, following the Closing Date, (i) Buyer shall have
exclusive authority and control over the investigation, prosecution, defense
and appeal of all Actions with respect to Transferred Assets, Assumed
Liabilities and all Liabilities of the IPG Entities and otherwise to the
extent relating to the Business, and may settle or compromise, or consent to
the entry of any judgment with respect to any such Action, without the consent
of Parent, (ii) Parent shall have exclusive authority and control over the
investigation, prosecution, defense and appeal of all Actions with respect to
Excluded Assets, Excluded Liabilities and all Liabilities otherwise to the
extent relating to the Retained Businesses, and may settle or compromise, or
consent to the entry of any judgment with respect to any such Action without
the consent of Buyer, and (iii) Parent and Buyer shall jointly share authority
and control and cooperate in good faith with respect to the investigation,
prosecution, defense and appeal of all Actions that relate to both (A)
Excluded Assets, Excluded Liabilities or Liabilities relating to the Retained
Business, and (B) Transferred Assets, 

Assumed Liabilities or Liabilities of the IPG Entities and relating to the
Business (including, if Parent and Buyer determine to appoint joint counsel,
with respect to the selection of appropriate joint counsel, which shall
require the consent of both Parent and Buyer (such consent not to be
unreasonably withheld)) and neither Party may settle or compromise, or consent
to the entry of any judgment with respect to any such Action, without the
consent of other Party; provided, that if any Party seeks to assert a claim
for indemnification with respect to any Action, the Parties shall comply with
the provisions of Section 9.03 instead of this Section 5.10(a) with respect to
such Action.

(d) From and after the Closing, Parent and the Sellers, on the one hand, and
Buyer, on the other hand, shall, and shall cause their respective Subsidiaries
to, use commercially reasonable efforts to cooperate with each other and their
respective counsel including by making available to each other, upon
reasonable written request, their (and their Subsidiaries') respective
officers, directors, employees, agents and other Representatives for fact
finding, consultation and interviews and as witnesses to the extent that any
such Person may reasonably be required in connection with any Actions in which
the requesting Party may from time to time be involved relating to the conduct
of the Business or the Retained Businesses, prior to or after the Closing.
Access to such Persons shall be granted during normal business hours at a
location and in a manner as not to unreasonably interfere with the conduct of,
the Business and the Retained Businesses, as applicable. Each Party agrees to
reimburse each other for reasonable out-of-pocket expenses, including
attorneys' fees, but excluding officers' or employees' salaries, incurred by
the other Party in connection with providing individuals and witnesses
pursuant to this Section 5.10(b). Notwithstanding anything in this Section
5.10 to the contrary, if any Party seeks to assert a claim for indemnification
in connection with any Action, the Parties shall comply with the provisions of
Section 9.03 instead of this Section 5.10(b) with respect to such Action.

(e) Notwithstanding the foregoing, the provisions of Article VI shall govern
with respect to Tax-related matters to the extent any provision in Article VI
is in conflict with Sections 5.10(a) or 5.10(b). For the avoidance of doubt,
neither Party shall have an obligation to cooperate, make available personnel
or disclose any documents or other information pursuant to Sections 5.10(a) or
5.10(b) or Article VI, if Parent, the Sellers or any of their Affiliates, on
the one hand, and Buyer or any of its Affiliates, on the other hand, are
adverse parties in any Action and such assistance, testimony, documents or
other information is reasonably pertinent thereto; provided, further, that
this shall not limit in any respect any rights a Party may have with respect
to discovery or the production of documents or other information in connection
with any such Action.

(f) The Parties agree that their respective rights and obligations to
maintain, preserve, assert or waive any attorney-client and work product
privileges belonging to either Party with respect to the Business and the
Retained Businesses (collectively, "Privileges") shall be governed by the
provisions of this Section 5.10(d). With respect to matters relating to the
Retained Businesses or the Excluded Liabilities, and with respect to all
Business Records, documents, communications or 

other information (collectively, "Information") of Parent, the Sellers or any
of their Affiliates prepared in connection with this Agreement, the
Transaction Documents, the Reorganization Documents or the transactions
contemplated hereby or thereby, Parent shall have sole authority to determine
whether to assert or waive any Privileges, including the right to assert any
Privilege against Buyer and its Affiliates. Buyer and its Affiliates
(including, as of the Closing Date, the IPG Entities) shall take no action
without the prior written consent of Parent that would reasonably be expected
to result in any waiver of any such Privileges of Parent, the Sellers or any
of their Affiliates. After the Closing, Buyer shall have sole authority to
determine whether to assert or waive any Privileges with respect to matters
relating to the Business (except for the Excluded Liabilities and Information
prepared in connection with this Agreement, the Transaction Documents, the
Reorganization Documents or the transactions contemplated hereby and thereby).
However, Buyer may not assert any such Privileges of the IPG Entities related
to pre-Closing advice or communications relating to the Business against
Parent, the Sellers and their Affiliates; provided, however, that to the
extent waiver (or failure to assert such Privilege) could reasonably be
expected to result in such Privilege being waived in connection with any claim
by a third party, Parent and the Sellers shall, and shall cause their
Affiliates to, enter into such reasonable arrangements as are reasonably
necessary to ensure that such Privilege is not otherwise waived with respect
to such third party, including customary joint defense agreements or other
similar arrangements. Parent, the Sellers and their Affiliates shall take no
action after the Closing without the prior written consent of Buyer that would
reasonably be expected to result in any waiver of any such Privileges of
Buyer. The rights and obligations created by this Section 5.10(d) shall apply
to all Information as to which Parent, the Sellers, their Affiliates or the
IPG Entities would be entitled to assert or has asserted a Privilege without
regard to the effect, if any, of the transactions contemplated hereby (the
"Privileged Information"). Upon receipt by Parent, the Sellers or their
Affiliates, or Buyer and its Affiliates (including, as of the Closing Date,
the IPG Entities), as the case may be, of any subpoena or discovery or other
request from any Person that actually or arguably calls for the production or
disclosure of Privileged Information of the other Party or if Parent, the
Sellers or their Affiliates or Buyer or its Affiliates (including, as of the
Closing Date, the IPG Entities), as the case may be, obtains knowledge that
any current or former employee of Parent, the Sellers or their Affiliates or
Buyer or its Affiliates (including, as of the Closing Date, the IPG Entities),
has received any subpoena discovery or other request from any Person that
actually or arguably calls for the production or disclosure of Privileged
Information of one or more of the other Parties, Parent or Buyer shall
promptly notify the other Parties of the existence of the request and shall
provide such other Party a reasonable opportunity to review the Privileged
Information and to assert any rights it may have under this Section 5.10(d) or
otherwise to prevent the production or disclosure of Privileged Information.
Parent's and the Sellers' transfer of any Business Records or other
Information to Buyer in accordance with this Agreement and Parent's and the
Sellers' agreement to permit Buyer to obtain Information existing prior to the
Closing are made in reliance on the Parties' respective agreements, as set
forth in this Section 5.10(d), to maintain the confidentiality of such
Information and to take the steps provided 

herein for the preservation of all Privileges that may belong to or be
asserted by Parent, the Sellers or Buyer, as the case may be. The access to
Business Records and other Information being granted pursuant to Sections
5.02, 5.10, 5.11, 9.03, 9.04 and Article VI, the agreement to provide
witnesses and individuals pursuant to this Section 5.10 and the disclosure to
Buyer, Parent and the Sellers of Privileged Information relating to the
Business or the Retained Businesses pursuant to this Agreement in connection
with the transactions contemplated hereby shall not be asserted by Parent, the
Sellers or Buyer to constitute, or otherwise deemed, a waiver of any Privilege
that has been or may be asserted under this Section 5.10(d) or otherwise.

Section 5.11. Retention of Business Records and Post-Closing Access.

(j) After the Closing, Parent, the Sellers and Buyer agree to, and Buyer shall
cause the IPG Entities to, hold at least one copy of all Business Records
relating to the conduct of the Business or the IPG Entities on or before the
Closing Date and not to destroy or dispose of such copy for a period of seven
(7) years from the Closing Date or such longer time as may be required by
applicable Law, and each of Buyer and Parent agree, upon the request of the
other Party prior to such date, to provide a copy of the applicable Business
Records prior to the destruction or disposition thereof. Subject to the
confidentiality obligations set forth herein, Parent and the Non-IPG
Subsidiaries may retain a copy of any or all of the Business Records and any
other materials included in any electronic data room or that are otherwise in
the possession or under the control of Parent or the Non-IPG Subsidiaries
relating to the conduct of the Business or the IPG Entities on or before the
Closing Date.

(k) From and after the Closing, except as prohibited by applicable Law, Buyer
shall, and shall cause its Subsidiaries, including the IPG Entities to (i)
give Parent, the Sellers and their Representatives reasonable access to the
offices, properties and Business Records of Buyer and its Subsidiaries,
including the IPG Entities, relating to the conduct of the Business and the
IPG Entities on or before the Closing Date during normal business hours and
upon reasonable prior notice, (ii) furnish to Parent, the Sellers and their
Representatives such financial and operating data and other information
relating to the conduct of the Business and the IPG Entities on or before the
Closing Date, and (iii) cause the employees, counsel, auditors and other
Representatives of Buyer and its Subsidiaries, including the IPG Entities, to
reasonably cooperate with Parent, the Sellers and their Representatives, in
each case, to the extent reasonably requested by Parent or the Sellers in
connection with accounting, Tax, legal defense and other similar needs. From
and after the Closing, Parent shall, and shall cause the Non-IPG Subsidiaries,
to (A) give Buyer and its Representatives reasonable access to the offices,
properties and Business Records of Parent and the Non-IPG Subsidiaries
relating to the conduct of the Business on or before the Closing Date during
normal business hours and upon reasonable prior notice, (B) furnish to Buyer
and its Representatives such financial and operating data and other
information relating to the conduct of the Business on or before the Closing
Date, and (C) cause the employees, counsel, auditors and other Representatives 

of Parent and the Non-IPG Subsidiaries to reasonably cooperate with Buyer and
its Representatives, in each case, to the extent reasonably requested by Buyer
in connection with accounting, Tax, legal defense and other similar needs
(including in connection with Buyer's preparation of the audited and reviewed
financial statements of the Business for the fiscal year 2014). Any such
access shall be granted in a manner as not to unreasonably interfere with the
conduct of the business of the Party granting such access. Notwithstanding the
foregoing, either Party may withhold such access, as and to the extent
necessary to avoid contravention or waiver, as to any document or information
the disclosure of which could reasonably be expected to violate any Contract
or any Law or result in the waiver of any legal privilege or work-product
privilege; provided, that to the extent practicable and in accordance with
such Contract or Law, and in a manner that does not result of the waiver of
any such privilege, such Party shall make reasonable and appropriate
substitute disclosure arrangements under circumstances in which these
restrictions apply; provided, further, that nothing in this Section 5.11(b)
shall limit in any respect any rights any Party may have with respect to
discovery or the production of documents or other information in connection
with any litigation.

(l) Notwithstanding the foregoing, the provisions of Article VI shall govern
with respect to Tax-related matters to the extent any provision in Article VI
is in conflict with Sections 5.11(a) or 5.11(b).

Section 5.12. Confidentiality.

(o) The Parties acknowledge and agree that the Confidentiality Agreement shall
remain in full force and effect until the Closing and that any books and
records, data and other information provided to Buyer between the date hereof
and the Closing shall be considered Evaluation Material (as such term is
defined in the Confidentiality Agreement) and afforded all protections
provided therein. The Confidentiality Agreement is hereby amended, as of the
date of this Agreement to include in the definition of "Representatives"
contained therein all existing or prospective equity investors, co-investors
and direct and indirect equity and debt financing sources of Buyer and its
stockholder and its and their respective Affiliates and their respective
agents, advisors and Representatives. Effective upon, and only upon, the
Closing, the Confidentiality Agreement shall terminate. As soon as reasonably
practicable after the date hereof, Parent shall instruct each Person (other
than the Buyer and its Affiliates and Representatives) in possession of
confidential information about the Business that was furnished within the last
two (2) years by or on behalf of Parent in connection with any actual or
potential proposal by such Person to acquire the Business (or any portion
thereof) to promptly return or destroy all such information (to the extent
Parent has not already done so).

(p) Parent and the Sellers shall not, and shall cause their Representatives
and Subsidiaries not to, directly or indirectly, for a period of five (5)
years after the Closing Date (or, with respect to any confidential or
proprietary information that constitutes a "trade secret", for the longer of
(x) 

such five (5) year period and (y) as long as such confidential or proprietary
information constitutes a "trade secret"), without the prior written consent
of Buyer, disclose to any third party (other than each other and their
respective Representatives) any confidential or proprietary information
related to the Business; provided, that the foregoing restriction shall not
(i) apply to any information (A) generally available to, or known by, the
public (other than as a result of disclosure in violation of this Section
5.12(b)) or (B) independently developed by Parent, the Sellers or any of their
Subsidiaries (other than by the Business prior to the Closing) without
reference to or use of the applicable confidential or proprietary information,
or (ii) prohibit any disclosure (A) required by Law so long as, to the extent
legally permissible and feasible, Parent or such Seller, as applicable,
provides Buyer with reasonable prior notice of such disclosure and a
reasonable opportunity to contest such disclosure or (B) made in connection
with the enforcement of any right or remedy relating to this Agreement or any
of the other Transaction Documents or the transactions contemplated hereby or
thereby. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary set forth in this Section
5.12(b), Parent, the Sellers and their respective Subsidiaries and
Representatives shall be deemed to have satisfied their obligations hereunder
with respect to confidential or proprietary information related to the
Business if they exercise the same degree of care (but no less than a
reasonable degree of care) as they take to preserve confidentiality for their
own similar information.

(q) Buyer shall not, and shall cause Buyer's Representatives, Buyer's
Affiliates (who have had access to such confidential or other proprietary
information), and Buyer's Subsidiaries not to, directly or indirectly, for a
period of five (5) years after the Closing Date (or, with respect to any
confidential or proprietary information that constitutes a "trade secret", for
the longer of (x) such five (5) year period and (y) as long as such
confidential or proprietary information constitutes a "trade secret"), without
the prior written consent of Parent, disclose to any third party (other than
each other and their respective Representatives) any confidential or
proprietary information related to the Retained Businesses; provided, that the
foregoing restriction shall not (i) apply to any information (A) generally
available to, or known by, the public (other than as a result of disclosure in
violation of this Section 5.12(c)) or (B) independently developed by Buyer or
any of its Subsidiaries (other than by the Retained Businesses prior to the
Closing) without reference to or use of the applicable confidential or
proprietary information, or (ii) prohibit any disclosure (A) required by Law
so long as, to the extent legally permissible and feasible, Buyer provides
Parent and the Sellers with reasonable prior notice of such disclosure and a
reasonable opportunity to contest such disclosure or (B) made in connection
with the enforcement of any right or remedy relating to this Agreement or any
of the other Transaction Documents or the transactions contemplated hereby or
thereby. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary set forth in this Section
5.12(c), Buyer and its Subsidiaries and Representatives shall be deemed to
have satisfied their obligations hereunder with respect to confidential or
proprietary information related to the Retained Businesses if they exercise
the same degree of care (but no less than a reasonable degree of care) as they
take to preserve confidentiality for their own similar information. 

(r) To the extent that any Third Party Confidentiality Agreement is not
otherwise assigned to the Buyer pursuant to Section 2.04(a)(xii), the Parent
shall make the Buyer reasonably aware of the terms thereof and if requested by
Buyer in writing, Parent shall use its commercially reasonable efforts to
enforce for the benefit of the Buyer and the IPG Entities any such Third Party
Confidentiality Agreement as directed by the Buyer; provided, that Buyer shall
be responsible for all out of pocket costs and expenses related to such
enforcement of such Third Party Confidentiality Agreements.

Section 5.13. Noncompetition; Non-Solicitation.

(h) During the period commencing on the Closing Date and ending on the three
(3) year anniversary of the Closing Date (the "Restricted Period"), Parent and
the Sellers shall not, and shall cause the Non-IPG Subsidiaries not to, engage
in any business, or hold any ownership interest in any Person who engages in
any business, in competition with the Restricted Business anywhere in the
world (each, a "Competing Activity"); provided, that the foregoing shall not
prohibit Parent, the Sellers or any of the Non-IPG Subsidiaries from:

(i) the acquisition of all or any portion of the equity interests of or the
investment in any Person engaged in a Competing Activity; provided, that if
(A) the Competing Activity accounts for more than twenty percent (20%) of the
gross revenues of such Person (based on its latest annual financial
statements) or (B) the gross revenue of such Person derived from the Competing
Activities (based on its latest annual financial statements) exceeds
$100,000,000, then Parent, the Sellers or any Non-IPG Subsidiary, as
applicable, shall be required to use commercially reasonable efforts to cease
such Competing Activity or divest such Person of that portion of the business
that constitutes a Competing Activity within eighteen (18) months after the
consummation of the acquisition to the extent required to be in compliance
with this Section 5.13(a)(i);

(ii) the acquisition, holding of investments or direct or indirect ownership
of any voting stock, capital stock or other equity interest of any Person
engaged in a Competing Activity, so long as such ownership interest represents
not more than five percent (5%) of the aggregate voting power or outstanding
capital stock or other equity interests of such Person; or

(iii) owning, engaging in, conducting or operating any of the Retained
Businesses, including, for the avoidance of doubt, Parent's consumer packaging
business.

(i) Each investment or acquisition made by Parent, the Sellers or any Non-IPG
Subsidiary in accordance with Section 5.13(a)(i) (each a "Permitted
Acquisition") must be permissible under Section 5.13(a)(i) at the time of such
investment; provided, however, that any Permitted Acquisition which was
permitted when made cannot thereafter be the basis of a claim of 

violation of this Section 5.13 if such Permitted Acquisition exceeds any of
the thresholds set forth in Section 5.13(a)(i) solely as a result of organic
growth from the operation of the business of such Permitted Acquisition
consistent with its past practice.

(j) For a period of two (2) years from and after the Closing Date, Parent and
the Sellers shall not, and shall cause the Non-IPG Subsidiaries not to,
directly or indirectly, through their respective officers, directors,
employees or otherwise:

(i) request, induce or attempt to influence any Business Employee to terminate
his or her employment with or service to Buyer or any IPG Entity; or

(ii) hire or employ, or solicit the employment of, or make or extend any offer
of employment to, any management-level Business Employee. The restrictions of
this clause (ii) of this Section 5.13(c) shall cease to apply to a Business
Employee three (3) months after the later of (A) the date of termination of
his or her employment with Buyer or any IPG Entity and (B) the last date on
which such Business Employee receives severance or other termination payments
from Buyer or any IPG Entity. Nothing in clause (ii) of this Section 5.13(c)
shall restrict or prevent Parent or any of its Subsidiaries from making
generalized searches for employees by the use of advertisements in the media
of any form (including trade media) or by engaging search firms that are not
instructed to solicit the Business Employees or, in either case, hiring any
Business Employee who responds to such generalized searches or search firm
solicitations.

(k) For a period of two (2) years from and after the Closing Date, Buyer shall
not, and shall cause the IPG Entities not to, directly or indirectly, through
their respective officers, directors, employees or otherwise:

(i) request, induce or attempt to influence any employee of Parent, the
Sellers or any Non-IPG Subsidiary to terminate his or her employment with or
service to Parent, the Sellers or any Non-IPG Subsidiary; or

(ii) hire or employ, or solicit the employment of, or make or extend any offer
of employment to, any management-level employee of Parent, the Sellers or any
Non-IPG Subsidiary, or any other employee of Parent, the Sellers or any Non-
IPG Subsidiary to whom Buyer is introduced, of whom Buyer has become aware, or
with whom Buyer has otherwise contacted, as a result of the preparation,
negotiation, execution and performance of this Agreement and the transactions
contemplated hereby. The restrictions of clause (ii) of this Section 5.13(d)
shall cease to apply to an employee of Parent, the Sellers or any Non-IPG
Subsidiary three (3) months after the later of (A) the date of termination of
his or her employment with the Parent, the Sellers or any Non-IPG Subsidiary
and (B) the last date on which such individual receives severance or other
termination payments from Parent, 

the Sellers or any Non-IPG Subsidiary. Nothing in clause (ii) of this Section
5.13(d) shall restrict or prevent Buyer or any of the IPG Entities from making
generalized searches for employees by the use of advertisements in the media
of any form (including trade media) or by engaging search firms that are not
instructed to solicit any employee of Parent, the Sellers or any Non-IPG
Subsidiary or, in either case, hiring any such employee who responds to such
generalized searches or search firm solicitations.

(l) The Parties mutually agree this Section 5.13 is reasonable and necessary
to protect and preserve Buyer's and Parent's legitimate business interests and
the value of the Business, the IPG Entities and the Retained Businesses, and
to prevent any unfair advantage conferred on any Party and their respective
successors.

Section 5.14. Public Announcements. The timing and content of all press
releases or public announcements regarding any non-public aspect of this
Agreement or any other Transaction Document or the transactions contemplated
hereby or thereby to the financial community, government agencies or the
general public shall be mutually agreed upon in advance by the Parties (which
consent shall not be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed).
Notwithstanding the foregoing, each Party may make any such announcement which
it in good faith believes, based on advice of counsel, is required by Law or
any listing agreement with any national securities exchange to which such
Party is subject; provided, that such Party shall consult with and agree on
the language of any such announcement with the other Party prior to any such
announcement to the extent practicable, and shall in any event promptly
provide the other Party with copies of any such announcement. Notwithstanding
anything to the contrary in Section 5.14, Buyer shall (either directly or
indirectly through one or more of its Affiliates) be permitted to make such
announcements in capital call notices, periodic information updates, marketing
materials or other similar forms of communication to existing investors,
potential investors and financing sources, in each case, to the extent such
existing investors, potential investors or financing sources are bound by an
obligation of confidentiality as to restrictions on further dissemination.

Section 5.15. Financing.

(a) Buyer shall use its reasonable best efforts to take, or cause to be taken,
all actions and to do, or cause to be done, all things necessary or advisable
to arrange the Debt Financing as promptly as practicable following the date of
this Agreement and to consummate the Debt Financing on the Closing Date,
including using its reasonable best efforts to:

(i) maintain in effect the Debt Commitment Letter and not permitting any
amendment or modification to be made to, not consenting to any waiver of any
provision or remedy under, and not replacing, the Debt Commitment Letter, if
such amendment, modification, waiver or replacement: (A) reduces the aggregate
amount of the Debt 

Financing (including by changing the amount of fees to be paid or original
issue discount of the Debt Financing) unless the Equity Financing (as
reflected in the Equity Commitment Letter, as may be amended) is increased by
a corresponding amount or (B) imposes new or additional conditions or
otherwise expands, amends or modifies any of the conditions to the receipt of
the Debt Financing in a manner that would reasonably be expected to (1)
materially delay or prevent the Closing or (2) adversely impact the ability of
Buyer to enforce its rights against other parties to the Debt Commitment
Letter or the definitive agreements with respect thereto when required
pursuant to this Agreement (provided, that Buyer may amend the Debt Commitment
Letter to add lenders, lead arrangers, bookrunners, syndication agents or
similar entities who had not executed the Debt Commitment Letter as of the
date hereof and amend the economic or other arrangements with respect to the
existing and additional lenders, lead arrangers, bookrunners, syndication
agents or similar entities, if the addition of such additional parties and
amendment of additional terms do not reduce the Debt Financing to be funded at
the Closing to less than the aggregate amount committed pursuant to the Debt
Commitment Letter as of the date hereof or, individually or in the aggregate,
would not be reasonably expected to delay or prevent the Closing);

(ii) cause the Equity Financing to be consummated upon satisfaction of the
Financing Conditions contained in the Equity Commitment Letter;

(iii) satisfy on or prior to the Closing Date, all Financing Conditions that
are within Buyer's control;

(iv) negotiate, execute and deliver Debt Financing Documents that reflect the
terms contained in, or no less favorable to Buyer in the aggregate than, the
Debt Commitment Letter (including any "market flex" provisions related
thereto);

(v) in the event that the conditions set forth in Sections 8.01 and 8.02 and
the Financing Conditions have been satisfied or, upon funding would be
satisfied, cause the Financing Sources to fund the full amount of the Debt
Financing at or prior to the Closing (or such lesser amount as may be required
to consummate the transactions contemplated hereby) (and, for the avoidance of
doubt, Buyer acknowledges and agrees that (A) in the event that on the final
day of the Marketing Period (x) all or a portion of the Debt Financing
structured as high yield debt or contemplated to be sold pursuant to a Rule
144A transaction has not been issued or sold, (y) all conditions precedent to
Buyer's obligations hereunder shall have been satisfied or waived (other than
those conditions which by their nature will not be satisfied until the
Closing) and (z) the bridge financing contemplated by the Debt Commitment
Letter is available, then on such date Buyer shall borrow under and use the
proceeds of the bridge financing to finance, in part, the Closing Date
Payments and (B) Buyer shall comply with any "securities demand" or similar
provisions included in the Debt 

Commitment Letter or any related fee letter and use any proceeds from the sale
of securities issued thereunder to finance, in part, the Closing Date
Payments); and

(vi) enforce its rights under the Commitment Letters in the event of a
Financing Failure Event.

(b) Buyer shall keep Parent informed in reasonable detail of the status of its
efforts to arrange the Financing. Buyer shall give Parent prompt notice of any
breach or repudiation, or receipt of a written notice of any anticipated or
threatened breach or repudiation, by any party to the Commitment Letters of
which Buyer becomes aware. Without limiting Buyer's other obligations under
this Section 5.15, if a Financing Failure Event occurs, Buyer shall (i)
promptly notify Parent of such Financing Failure Event and the reasons
therefor, (ii) in consultation with the Parent and the Sellers, use its
reasonable best efforts to obtain (on terms no less favorable to Buyer, taken
as a whole (taking into account any "market flex" provisions, but not in
excess or outside of such "market flex" provisions unless agreed by Buyer), in
the aggregate, than those set forth in the Debt Commitment Letter) alternative
financing from the same or alternative financing sources, in an amount
sufficient to make the Closing Date Payments and consummate the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement, as promptly as practicable following the
occurrence of such event, and (iii) use its reasonable best efforts to obtain,
and when obtained, provide Parent and the Sellers with a copy of, a
replacement financing commitment in accordance with Section 5.15(a)(i) that
provides for such alternative financing. Notwithstanding anything herein to
the contrary, in no event shall the reasonable best efforts of Buyer be deemed
or construed to require Buyer to, and Buyer shall not be required to, (i) pay
fees in the aggregate in excess of those contemplated by the Debt Commitment
Letter, or (ii) agree to terms that are outside of, or less favorable than, in
the aggregate, any terms set forth in the Debt Commitment Letter or any
related fee letter (including any "market flex" provision therein).

Section 5.16. Debt Financing Cooperation.

(d) Parent and the Sellers shall use their reasonable best efforts, and shall
cause the IPG Entities to use their reasonable best efforts, and shall use
their reasonable best efforts to cause their Representatives (excluding legal
counsel), to provide, in each case at Buyer's sole cost and expense, such
cooperation in connection with the arrangement of the Debt Financing as is
reasonably requested by Buyer (to the extent that such cooperation does not
unreasonably interfere with the business operations of Parent, the Sellers or
the IPG Entities), including:

(i) participation by the senior management team of the IPG Entities in the
marketing activities undertaken in connection with the marketing of the Debt
Financing, including (A) preparation of the Marketing Material and due
diligence sessions related thereto, (B) a reasonable number of road shows and
meetings with prospective lenders and 

debt investors and (C) delivery of customary authorization letters,
confirmations and undertakings in connection with the Marketing Material
(including with respect to the presence or absence of material non-public
information and accuracy of the information contained therein); provided, that
such letters and confirmations expressly state that (x) the IPG Entities shall
not have any Liability of any kind or nature resulting from the use of
information contained in the Marketing Material or otherwise in connection
with their cooperation with arranging the Debt Financing, except for Liability
under the Debt Financing Documents executed on the Closing Date and (y) the
recipient of such letters of authorization shall be entitled to rely only on
the representations and warranties contained in the Debt Financing Documents;

(ii) participation by senior management of the IPG Entities in, and assistance
with, the preparation of rating agency presentations and meetings with rating
agencies;

(iii) preparation and delivery as promptly as practicable to Buyer and its
Financing Sources of the Financing Information and Financing Deliverables
(including at least fifteen (15) Business Days prior to the Closing Date all
documentation and other information about the IPG Entities and their
Subsidiaries as has been reasonably requested in writing by the Financing
Sources at least ten (10) Business Days prior to the Closing Date that they
reasonably determine is required by regulatory authorities under applicable
"know your customer" and anti-money laundering rules and regulations,
including the PATRIOT Act);

(iv) participation by senior management of the IPG Entities in the negotiation
of the Debt Financing Documents;

(v) consenting to the reasonable use of IPG Entities' logos in connection with
the Debt Financing so long as such logos are used in a manner that is not
intended to or reasonably likely to harm or disparage Parent, the Sellers or
the IPG Entities or the reputation or goodwill of the Parent, the Sellers or
the IPG Entities;

(vi) taking such actions as are reasonably requested by Buyer or its Financing
Sources to facilitate the satisfaction on a timely basis of all Financing
Conditions that are within its control; and

(vii) requesting that its independent auditors cooperate with the Debt
Financing, including by providing the Specified Auditor Assistance.

(e) Parent and the Sellers will use their reasonable best efforts, and will
cause the IPG Entities to use their reasonable best efforts, to provide to
Buyer and its Financing Sources such information as may be necessary so that
the Financing Information and Marketing Material is complete and correct in
all material respects and does not contain any untrue statement of a material 

fact or omit to state a material fact necessary to make the statements
contained therein, in the light of the circumstances under which such
statements are made, not misleading.

(f) Parent and the Sellers shall have the right to review and comment on
Marketing Material prior to the dissemination of such materials to potential
lenders or other counterparties to any proposed financing transaction (or
filing with any Governmental Authority); provided, that Parent and the Sellers
shall communicate in writing their comments, if any, to Buyer and its counsel
within a reasonable period of time under the circumstances and consistent with
the time accorded to other participants who were asked to review and comment
on such Marketing Material. No IPG Entity shall be required to agree to any
contractual obligation relating to the Financing that is not conditioned upon
the Closing and that does not terminate without Liability to each IPG Entity
and its Affiliates (including Parent, the Sellers and the Non-IPG
Subsidiaries) upon the termination of this Agreement. None of Parent, the
Sellers or the IPG Entities shall be required to deliver or cause the delivery
of any legal opinions or reliance letters in connection with the Debt
Financing.

(g) From and after the Closing Date, Buyer shall indemnify and hold harmless
Parent, the Sellers and their Subsidiaries, and each of their respective
directors, officers, employees, agents and other Representatives from and
against any and all Liabilities suffered or incurred in connection with the
arrangement of the Debt Financing or any assistance or activities provided in
connection therewith (other than historical information related to the IPG
Entities provided by Parent or its Affiliates in writing for which a Buyer
Indemnified Party is entitled to indemnification pursuant to Article IX
hereof); provided, however, that the foregoing shall not apply in Parent's,
the Sellers' or their respective Subsidiaries' or other Representatives'
willful misconduct or gross negligence. Buyer shall promptly reimburse Parent,
the Sellers or the IPG Entities for all documented out-of-pocket third party
costs incurred by Parent, the Sellers or the IPG Entities in connection with
such cooperation.

(h) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary herein, it is understood and
agreed that the condition precedent set forth in Section 8.02(c), as applied
to Parent and the Sellers' obligations under this Section 5.16, shall be
deemed to be satisfied unless the Financing has not been obtained as a result
of Parent's or the Sellers' material breach of its obligations under this
Section 5.16 to the extent such breach impairs or adversely affects the
Financing, including the execution, timing and pricing or cost thereof, in a
material manner. Buyer acknowledges and agrees that obtaining the Financing is
not a condition to Closing. None of Parent, the Sellers or any Non-IPG
Subsidiary shall have any obligations under this Section 5.16 following the
consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby.

Section 5.17. Indemnification and Exculpation. 

(c) From and after the Closing Date, Buyer shall cause each IPG Entity to
indemnify, defend and hold harmless to the fullest extent such IPG Entity is
permitted to indemnity, defend and hold harmless its directors, officers or
employees in the Organizational Documents of the applicable IPG Entity and
indemnification agreements, in each case, as in effect as of the date of this
Agreement, the individuals who on or prior to the Closing Date were directors,
officers or employees of such IPG Entity (collectively, the "DandO
Indemnitees"), as applicable, with respect to all acts or omissions by them in
their capacities as such or taken at the request of such IPG Entity at any
time prior to the Closing Date only to the extent such act or omission was in
respect of the Business. Buyer agrees that all rights of the DandO Indemnitees
to indemnification and exculpation from Liabilities for acts or omissions
occurring at or prior to the Closing Date pursuant to any Organizational
Documents, indemnification agreements or other arrangements of each IPG Entity
shall survive the Closing Date and shall continue in full force and effect in
accordance with their terms, and otherwise to the fullest extent permitted by
Law. Such rights shall not be amended, or otherwise modified in any manner
that would adversely affect the rights of the DandO Indemnitees, unless such
modification is required by applicable Law. In addition, from and after the
Closing Date, Buyer shall cause each IPG Entity to advance and pay any
expenses of any DandO Indemnitee under this Section 5.17 to the fullest extent
permitted under Law, in the Organizational Documents of the applicable IPG
Entity and indemnification agreements in effect as of the date of this
Agreement, provided that the Person to whom expenses are advanced provides an
undertaking to repay such advances to the extent required by Law.

(d) If any Action is asserted or made with respect to which a DandO Indemnitee
may seek or obtain indemnification hereunder, any determination required to be
made with respect to whether a DandO Indemnitee's conduct complies with the
standards set forth under Law, any Organizational Documents or any
indemnification agreements or arrangements of the IPG Entities shall be made
by independent legal counsel selected by such DandO Indemnitee and reasonably
acceptable to Buyer.

(e) From and after the Closing Date, Buyer and each DandO Indemnitee shall
cooperate, and cause their respective Affiliates to cooperate, in the defense
of any such Action and shall provide access to properties and individuals as
reasonably requested and furnish or cause to be furnished records, information
and testimony, and attend such conferences, discovery proceedings, hearings,
trials or appeals, as may be reasonably requested in connection therewith.

(f) If Buyer or any of its successors or assigns (i) consolidates with or
merges into any other Person and is not the continuing or surviving
corporation or entity of such consolidation or merger or (ii) transfers or
conveys all or substantially all of its properties and assets to any Person,
then, and in each such case, proper provision shall be made so that the
successors and assigns of Buyer shall assume all of the obligations thereof
set forth in this Section 5.17. 

(g) Buyer hereby acknowledges that any DandO Indemnitee may have certain rights
to indemnification, advancement of expenses or insurance provided by Parent,
the Sellers or any Non-IPG Subsidiary (collectively, the "ITW Indemnitors").
Buyer hereby agrees that, from and after the Closing Date, except for claims
by any DandO Indemnitee related to a matter for which a Buyer Indemnified Party
is entitled to indemnification pursuant to Article IX hereof, (i) it is the
indemnitor of first resort (i.e., its obligations to such DandO Indemnitee are
primary and any obligation of the ITW Indemnitors to advance expenses or to
provide indemnification for the same expenses or liabilities incurred by such
DandO Indemnitee are secondary), (ii) it shall be required to advance the full
amount of expenses incurred by such DandO Indemnitee and shall be liable for the
full amount of all Liabilities paid in settlement to the extent legally
permitted and as required by the terms of this Section 5.17, without regard to
any rights such DandO Indemnitee may have against the ITW Indemnitors, and (iii)
it irrevocably waives, relinquishes and releases the ITW Indemnitors from any
and all claims against the ITW Indemnitors for contribution, subrogation or
any other recovery of any kind in respect thereof; provided that the Buyer
shall be entitled to assert any defense that an ITW Indemnitor would be
entitled to assert if such claim were made directly against such ITW
Indemnitor. Buyer further agrees that no advancement or payment by the ITW
Indemnitors on behalf of such DandO Indemnitee with respect to any claim for
which such DandO Indemnitee has sought indemnification from Buyer shall affect
the foregoing and the ITW Indemnitors shall have a right of contribution
and/or be subrogated to the extent of such advancement or payment to all of
the rights of recovery of such DandO Indemnitee against Buyer; in the case of
subsections (i) through (iii) above solely relating to acts or omissions
occurring at any time prior to the Closing Date to the extent such act or
omission was in respect of the Business. Buyer and each DandO Indemnitee agree
that the ITW Indemnitors are express third party beneficiaries of the terms of
this Section 5.17(e).

(h) The obligations of Buyer under this Section 5.17 shall not be terminated
or modified in such a manner as to adversely affect any DandO Indemnitee to whom
this Section 5.17 applies without the consent of the affected DandO Indemnitee.
The provisions of this Section 5.17 (i) are intended to be for the benefit of,
and shall be enforceable by, each DandO Indemnitee and such DandO Indemnitee's
heirs and Representatives and (ii) are in addition to, and not in substitution
for, any other rights to indemnification or contribution that any such Person
may have by Contract, at Law or otherwise.

(i) Notwithstanding the foregoing, at the request and sole cost and expense of
Buyer, Parent shall use commercially reasonable efforts to purchase and
maintain, or with Buyer's consent, to cause the IPG Entities to purchase and
maintain, a "tail" policy providing directors' and officers' liability
insurance coverage (including any policy providing coverage for combined
fiduciary and employment practices liability) for the benefit of the DandO
Indemnitees with respect to matters covered by this Section 5.17 ("Tail
Policy"). If Parent purchases the Tail Policy, the Parties hereby agree that,
from and after the Closing Date, except for claims by any DandO Indemnitee that
are not otherwise covered by the Tail Policy, and for which the DandO
Indemnitees are entitled to 

indemnification pursuant to this Section 5.17, the Tail Policy shall be the
first source of recovery for indemnification for each of the DandO Indemnitees
pursuant to this Section 5.17.

Section 5.18. Notice of Certain Events. Prior to the Closing Date, Buyer shall
give Parent, and Parent shall give Buyer, prompt written notice if such Party
becomes aware of (a) any written communication from any Person to such Party
alleging that a Third Party Approval of or by such Person (or another Person)
is required in connection with the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement, (b) any material Action commenced or threatened against such Party
that arises out of or is related to the transactions completed by this
Agreement, and (c) any development that would reasonably be expected to result
in a failure of a condition set forth in Article VIII. The delivery of any
notice pursuant to this Section 5.18 shall not cure any breach of any
representation, warranty, covenant or agreement contained in this Agreement or
otherwise limit or affect the remedies available hereunder to the Party
receiving such notice.

Section 5.19. Appropriate Actions; Further Assurances.

(a) Except as otherwise provided in this Agreement and subject to Sections
5.03, 5.05, 5.06 and 5.15, each of the Parties shall use their reasonable best
efforts before and after the Closing Date to take, or cause to be taken, all
actions, and to do, or cause to be done, and to assist and cooperate with the
other Parties hereto in doing, all things reasonably necessary, proper or
advisable under applicable Laws to consummate and make effective, in the most
expeditious manner practicable, the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement, including (i) the satisfaction at the earliest practicable date of
all of the conditions to the other Party's obligations to consummate and make
effective the transactions contemplated by this Agreement and (ii) the
execution and delivery of such instruments, and the taking of such other
actions, as the other Party hereto may reasonably require in order to
consummate and make effective the transactions contemplated by this Agreement;
provided, that the foregoing shall in no event be interpreted to require any
Party to waive any condition precedent to its obligations to close the
transactions contemplated hereby. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary set
forth herein, the Parties hereto acknowledge and agree that all obligations of
the Parties hereto relating to seeking to obtain the Financing shall be
governed exclusively by Section 5.15 and Section 5.16, as the case may be.

(b) Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, to the extent that, from
time to time after the Closing, Parent or Buyer identifies any asset that is
owned by Parent or a non-IPG Subsidiary, on the one hand, or Buyer or an IPG
Entity, on the other, that should have been transferred pursuant to the
transactions contemplated by the Global Separation Agreement or was
inadvertently transferred in connection with the transactions contemplated by
the Global Separation Agreement, including Section 2.06(c) thereof, Parent or
Buyer, to the extent applicable, shall (and shall cause their respective
Subsidiaries to) take such reasonable action as is necessary to transfer such
asset 

to the appropriate party and such asset shall be deemed a Transferred Asset or
an Excluded Asset, as applicable.

Section 5.20. Mail and Other Communications; Accounts.

(a) After the Closing Date, each of Parent, the Sellers, and their respective
Subsidiaries and Buyer and its Subsidiaries (including the IPG Entities) may
receive mail, packages and other communications (including electronic
communications) properly belonging to the other Party (or the other Party's
Subsidiaries). Accordingly, at all times after the Closing Date, each of
Parent, the Seller and Buyer authorizes the other and their respective
Subsidiaries to receive and open all mail, packages and other communications
received by it and not unambiguously intended for the other Party (or its
Subsidiaries) or any of the other Party's (or its Subsidiaries') officers or
directors, and to retain the same to the extent that they relate to the
Business (in the case of receipt by Buyer and its Subsidiaries (including the
IPG Entities)) or the Retained Businesses (in the case of receipt by Parent,
the Sellers and their respective Subsidiaries), or to the extent that they do
not relate to the Business (in the case of receipt by Buyer and its
Subsidiaries (including the IPG Entities)) or the Retained Businesses (in the
case of receipt by Parent, the Sellers and their respective Subsidiaries), the
receiving party shall promptly after becoming aware thereof refer, forward or
otherwise deliver such mail, packages or other communications (or, in case the
same relate to both the Business and the Retained Businesses and that is not a
payment or reimbursement, which is addressed in Sections 5.20(b) and 5.20(c),
copies thereof) to the other party. The provisions of this Section 5.20 are
not intended to, and shall not be deemed to, constitute an authorization by
any of Parent, the Sellers or Buyer to permit the other to accept service of
process on its behalf and neither Party is or shall be deemed to be the agent
of the other for service of process purposes.

(b) All payments and reimbursements received by Parent, the Sellers or their
respective Subsidiaries in connection with or arising out of the Business, the
Transferred Assets or the Assumed Liabilities after the Closing shall be held
by such Person in trust for the benefit of Buyer and, immediately upon receipt
by such Person of any such payment or reimbursement, such Person shall pay
over to Buyer the amount of such payment or reimbursement, without right of
set off.

(c) All payments and reimbursements received by Buyer or its Subsidiaries in
connection with or arising out of the Excluded Assets, Excluded Liabilities or
Retained Businesses, after the Closing shall be held by such Person in trust
for the benefit of Parent, and immediately upon receipt by such Person of any
such payment or reimbursement such person shall pay over to Parent the amount
of such payment or reimbursement without right of set off.

Section 5.21. Reorganization Purchase-Price Adjustments. Notwithstanding any
provision to the contrary contained in any of the Reorganization Documents,
from and after the Closing, (a) neither Parent nor any of its Affiliates shall
be entitled to, nor shall Buyer or any IPG 

Entity be liable for, any post-closing purchase price adjustments in
connection with the Reorganization, and (b) Parent shall, and shall cause its
Affiliates to, refrain from issuing any post-closing purchase price adjustment
notices. Prior to the Closing, Parent shall, and shall cause its Affiliates
to, pay and satisfy in full any purchase price adjustments owed by Parent or
its Affiliates, as applicable, pursuant to any purchase price adjustments
issued in connection with the Reorganization. For the avoidance of doubt, this
Section 5.21 shall in no way (i) affect the rights and obligations of the
Parties under Section 2.06 or (ii) prohibit any Party from complying with
applicable Law, including any requirements of a Taxing Authority

Section 5.22. Exclusive Dealing. During the period from the date of this
Agreement through the earlier of the Closing or the termination of this
Agreement in accordance with its terms, neither the Parent nor any Seller
shall take, or permit any of their respective Subsidiaries, Affiliates,
officers, directors, employees, representatives, consultants, financial
advisors, attorneys, accountants or other agents to take, any action to
solicit, encourage, initiate or engage in discussions or negotiations with, or
provide any information to or enter into any agreement with any Person (other
than Buyer and/or its Affiliates) concerning any purchase of any of the Equity
Interests or Transferred Assets or any merger, sale of substantial assets or
similar transaction involving any of the IPG Entities or the Transferred
Assets, other than assets (other than Equity Interests) sold in accordance
with the provisions of this Agreement.

ARTICLE VI

TAX MATTERS

Section 6.01. Tax Returns; Refunds; Transfer Taxes.

(g) Parent shall prepare and timely file, or cause to be prepared and timely
filed, all Seller Group Tax Returns with respect to the IPG Entities for all
taxable periods. If an IPG Entity is permitted under applicable Law to treat
the Closing Date as the last day of a taxable period in which the Closing
occurs, Parent and Buyer shall treat (and shall cause their respective
Affiliates to treat) the Closing Date as the last day of such taxable period
with respect to such IPG Entity. Buyer shall prepare and timely file, or cause
to be prepared and timely filed, all non-Seller Group Tax Returns with respect
to the IPG Entities (i) for all Straddle Tax Periods and (ii) for taxable
periods ending on or before the Closing Date and filed after the Closing Date
(each such non-Seller Group Tax Return, a "Pre-Closing Buyer-Filed Tax
Return"). Any Pre-Closing Buyer-Filed Tax Return (A) shall be prepared in a
manner consistent with past practice (unless otherwise required by applicable
Law), (B) shall reflect a deduction for the IPG Transaction Expenses to the
maximum extent permitted by applicable Law, and to the extent that any Pre-
Closing Buyer-Filed Tax Return shows a net operating loss, such net operating
loss shall be carried back to previous taxable periods of the IPG Entities to
the maximum extent permitted by applicable Law, and (C) relating to Income 

Tax and material non-Income Tax, shall be submitted by Buyer to Parent
(together with schedules, statements and, to the extent reasonably requested
by Parent, supporting documentation) for its review and comment at least
thirty (30) days in the case of Tax Returns for Income Tax (or, in the case of
Tax Returns for any material non-Income Tax, at least ten (10) Business Days)
prior to the due date (including any applicable extension) for filing such Tax
Return. Buyer shall incorporate Parent's reasonable comments and shall not
file any Pre-Closing Buyer-Filed Tax Return without the written consent of
Parent, which shall not be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed.
Subject to Section 6.05, Buyer shall pay or cause to be paid all Taxes with
respect to any Pre-Closing Buyer-Filed Tax Return in accordance with Law.
Except to the extent otherwise required pursuant to a "determination" within
the meaning of Section 1313(a) of the Code (or any comparable provision of
state, local or foreign Law), neither Buyer nor any IPG Entity shall amend any
Tax Return for any taxable period ending on or prior to the Closing Date or a
Straddle Tax Period without the prior written consent of Parent, which shall
not be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed. By the later of (i) five
(5) Business Days after Parent receives from Buyer an invoice evidencing
payment in full of Income Taxes with respect to a Pre-Closing Buyer-Filed Tax
Return and (ii) ten (10) Business Days prior to the latest date on which such
Income Taxes are due and payable without interest or penalties, Parent shall
pay to Buyer the amount of such Income Taxes attributable to a Pre-Closing Tax
Period, calculated in accordance with Section 6.05(c) in the case of a
Straddle Tax Period.

(h) Except to the extent taken into account in the calculation of Final Net
Operating Assets, Parent and the Sellers shall be entitled to any cash Tax
refunds or credits (or other reductions in Tax) claimed in lieu of a cash Tax
refund of any IPG Entity attributable to any Pre-Closing Tax Period, plus any
interest actually received with respect thereto from an applicable
Governmental Authority (collectively, "Tax Refunds"). Buyer shall pay, or
cause to be paid, such amount to Parent, no later than ten (10) days following
receipt of such Tax Refund, net of any out-of-pocket expenses incurred in
connection with obtaining such Tax Refund, any Taxes imposed as a result of
such Tax Refund, and any Tax required to be withheld on such payment to
Parent. With respect to any Pre-Closing Tax Period, upon Parent's request and
at Parent's expense, Buyer shall, or shall cause the relevant IPG Entity to,
initiate a claim for a Tax Refund or amend any Tax Return; provided, however,
that Buyer shall not be required to initiate such Tax Refund claim or amend
such Tax Return if it can reasonably be expected that such Tax Refund claim or
Tax Return amendment would increase the Tax Liability of Buyer or the relevant
IPG Entity for any Post-Closing Tax Period and Parent does not agree to pay
such increased Tax Liability; provided, further, that the Tax Liability, for
this purpose, of Buyer or the relevant IPG Entity shall not be deemed to
increase as a result of any reduction in the carry forward of any Tax
attribute generated in any Pre-Closing Tax Period. If there is a subsequent
reduction by a Governmental Authority (or by virtue of a change in applicable
Tax Law), of any amounts with respect to which a payment has been made
pursuant to this Section 6.01(b), then Parent shall pay Buyer an amount equal
to such reduction plus any interest or penalties 

imposed by the Governmental Authority with respect to such reduction. Buyer
shall not cause or permit any IPG Entity to carry back to any taxable period
ending on or prior to the Closing Date any net operating loss or other Tax
attribute arising after the Closing Date, without the prior written consent of
Parent, which shall not be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed,
provided that Parent is entitled to reimbursement for reasonable out-of-pocket
expenses in connection with such carry back.

(i) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement, all excise,
sales, use, value added, registration stamp, recording, documentary,
conveyancing, franchise, property, transfer and similar Taxes, levies, charges
and fees, including the out-of-pocket costs and expenses of preparing and
filing Tax Returns for all such Taxes previously listed in this sentence
(collectively, "Transfer Taxes") arising from the transactions contemplated by
this Agreement shall be borne by equally by Parent and Buyer on a 50-50 basis;
provided that Transfer Taxes shall not include any direct or indirect capital
gain tax arising from the transactions contemplated by this Agreement and any
such direct and indirect capital gain tax shall be borne by Parent. Parent and
Buyer shall, upon the other's request, use their commercially reasonable
efforts to obtain any certificate or other document from any Governmental
Authority or any other Person as may be necessary to mitigate, reduce or
eliminate any Transfer Tax that could be imposed.

Section 6.02. Cooperation On Tax Matters. Buyer and Parent shall, and shall
cause their respective Subsidiaries to, cooperate fully, as and to the extent
reasonably requested by the other, in connection with the preparation,
execution and filing of Tax Returns pursuant to Section 6.01(a) and the
conduct of any Tax Claim. Such cooperation shall include access to records and
information which are reasonably relevant to any such Tax Return or Tax Claim,
making employees available on a mutually convenient basis to provide
additional information and explanation of any material provided hereunder and
executing powers of attorney. Buyer and Parent shall, and shall cause their
respective Subsidiaries to, (a) retain all books and records with respect to
Tax matters pertinent to the Business and the operations of the IPG Entities
relating to any taxable period beginning before the Closing Date until the
expiration of the applicable statute of limitations, (b) abide by all record
retention agreements entered into with any Taxing Authority, and (c) give the
other party ninety (90) days' written notice prior to transferring, destroying
or discarding any such books and records and, if the other party so requests,
Buyer or Parent shall, and shall cause their respective Subsidiaries to, allow
the other to take possession of such books and records. Notwithstanding
anything to the contrary in this Agreement, Parent and the Sellers shall not
be required to transfer to Buyer any (i) Seller Group Tax Returns or related
work papers or (ii) Tax Returns or related work papers of Parent, the Sellers,
or any Non-IPG Subsidiary.

Section 6.03. Buyer Covenants. Buyer covenants that it shall not cause or
permit any IPG Entity or any Affiliate of Buyer with respect to any IPG Entity
(a) to make any election pursuant to Treasury Regulation Section 301-7701-3
that is effective on or before the day after the Closing 

Date, (b) to take any action through the end of the Closing Date other than in
the ordinary course of business, including but not limited to the distribution
of any dividend or the effectuation of any redemption, (c) with respect to the
non-U.S. IPG Corporations, make any distribution through the end of the
taxable period that includes the Closing Date (as determined for U.S. federal
income tax purposes, including for this purpose the effects of any elections
made under section 338(g) of the Code), including but not limited to the
distribution of any dividend or the effectuation of any redemption, or (d)
make any other election with respect to Taxes, for a Pre-Closing Tax Period,
that could give rise to any Tax Liability for any Pre-Closing Tax Period or
reduce any Tax asset of the Seller Group. For the avoidance of doubt, Buyer or
any Affiliate of Buyer, at their option, shall be permitted to make an
election under Section 338 of the Code (or any comparable application
provision of state, local or foreign Tax Law) with respect to any IPG Entity
that is not incorporated, formed, or organized in the United States.

Section 6.04. Tax Sharing Agreements. Except as set forth in Schedule 6.04,
any and all existing Tax Sharing Agreements shall be terminated as of the
Closing Date. After such date none of the IPG Entities shall have any rights
or obligations under any such terminated Tax Sharing Agreement.

Section 6.05. Tax Indemnification.

(h) Except to the extent taken into account in the calculation of Final Net
Operating Assets and without duplication, Parent hereby indemnifies the Buyer
Indemnitees against, and agrees to hold each of them harmless from, any and
all (i) Income Taxes (or the non-payment thereof) shown as due on any Tax
Return filed in accordance with Section 6.01(a), U.S. federal Income Taxes or
Significant Other Income Taxes, in each case, of the IPG Entities for all Pre-
Closing Tax Periods, including such Taxes of any member of an affiliated,
consolidated, combined or unitary group of which the IPG Entities (or any
predecessor of any of the foregoing) is or was a member on or prior to the
Closing Date, including pursuant to Treasury Regulation Section 1.1502-6 or
any analogous or similar state, local, or non-U.S. law or regulation, (ii)
reasonable costs and expenses associated with amending (if such amendment is
at the request of the Parent) and defending (subject to Section 6.06) any Tax
Return for any Pre-Closing Tax Period, (iii) Taxes of Parent, the Sellers or
any of their respective Affiliates (other than the IPG Entities); (iv) Taxes
that directly result from the Reorganization ("Reorganization Taxes"); (v)
Taxes to the extent arising out of or resulting from any breach by Parent or
the Sellers of any covenant contained in this Article VI other than the
covenants contained in the foregoing clauses (i) through (iv) immediately
above; (vi) Taxes to the extent arising out of or related to any breach of any
representation or warranty contained in Section 3.14 and Section 3.13(g) and
(h), except to the extent such Taxes are otherwise indemnified pursuant to the
foregoing clauses (i) through (v) immediately above; and (vii) amounts
assessed by a Governmental Authority against any IPG Entity for any Pre-
Closing Tax Period as a result of such IPG Entity's failure to remit required
amounts in accordance with applicable escheat or unclaimed 

property Law; provided, however, that for purposes of this Section 6.05(a),
Taxes shall include the amount of Taxes that would have been paid but for the
application of any credit or loss deduction attributable to any Post-Closing
Tax Period. Notwithstanding the foregoing, Parent shall have no Liability for
any Taxes that are imposed on any IPG Entity, Parent, the Sellers, or any of
their respective Affiliates, to the extent arising out of or resulting from
any breach by Buyer of any covenant contained in Section 6.03 or any
violations of the conditions of the tax rulings disclosed in Schedule 3.14(c)
after the Closing Date (collectively, "Buyer Taxes"); provided, however, that
Buyer Taxes shall not include, and Parent shall remain liable for, any Taxes
imposed on any IPG Entity, Parent, the Sellers, or any of their respective
Affiliates, where the actions taken or elections made by Buyer or any of its
Affiliates are required by applicable Law and consented to by Parent.
Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement, except with
respect to Reorganization Taxes, Parent shall not indemnify the Buyer
Indemnitees for Taxes of any IPG Entity for any Post-Closing Tax Period,
including Taxes resulting from the reduction in the carry forward from Tax
attribute generated in a Pre-Closing Tax Period, unless such Taxes result from
(A) adjustments under Section 481 of the Code (or any corresponding or similar
provision of state, local or foreign Income Tax Law) resulting from a breach
of the representation in Section 3.14(i), or (B) inclusions pursuant to
Section 108(i) of the Code (or any corresponding or similar provision of
state, local or foreign Income Tax Law) resulting from a breach of the
representation in Section 3.14(i)(vi).

(i) Buyer hereby indemnifies the Seller Indemnitees against, and agrees to
hold each of them harmless from, any and all (i) Taxes of the IPG Entities
imposed on a Seller Indemnitee for any Post-Closing Tax Period, except to the
extent such Taxes are subject to indemnification by Parent pursuant to Section
6.05(a); (ii) any breach by Buyer or any of its Affiliates (including the IPG
Entities after Closing) of any covenant contained in this Article VI; and
(iii) Buyer Taxes imposed on a Seller Indemnitee.

(j) In the case of any Straddle Tax Period:

(vii) real, personal and intangible property Taxes and any other Taxes levied
on a per diem basis ("Per Diem Taxes"), of any IPG Entity for any Pre-Closing
Tax Period shall be equal to the amount of such Per Diem Taxes for the entire
Straddle Tax Period multiplied by a fraction, the numerator of which is the
number of days during the Straddle Tax Period that are in the Pre-Closing Tax
Period and the denominator of which is the total number of days in the
Straddle Tax Period; and

(viii) Taxes of any IPG Entity (other than Per Diem Taxes or Buyer Taxes) for
any Pre-Closing Tax Period shall be computed based on the interim closing of
the books as of the close of business on the Closing Date (and for such
purpose, the taxable period of any partnership or other pass-through entity
which is an IPG Entity or in which a Seller holds a beneficial interest shall
be deemed to terminate at such time). All IPG Transaction Expenses 

shall be apportioned to the Pre-Closing Tax Period to the extent permitted by
applicable Law. Any exemptions, deductions or credits relating to a Straddle
Tax Period that are calculated on an annual or other periodic basis shall be
apportioned to the Pre-Closing Tax Period by determining the amount thereof
for the entire Straddle Tax Period and then multiplying such amount by a
fraction, the numerator of which is the number of days during the Straddle Tax
Period that are in the Pre-Closing Tax Period and the denominator of which is
the total number of days in the Straddle Tax Period.

(k) Subject to Section 6.07, the obligations to indemnify under Sections
6.05(a) and 6.05(b) shall survive the Closing until thirty (30) days after
expiration of the applicable statute of limitations (including extensions).

Section 6.06. Procedures Relating to Indemnification of Tax Claims.

(a) If a claim for Taxes, including notice of a pending audit, shall be made
by any Taxing Authority, which, if successful, might result in a claim for
indemnity pursuant to Sections 6.05(a) or 6.05(b) (any such claim, a "Tax
Claim"), the party which receives such claim shall notify the other party in
writing within fifteen (15) days of receipt of such Tax Claim; provided, that
the failure of an Indemnified Party to give such notice to an Indemnifying
Party shall not affect the indemnification provided hereunder except to the
extent that the Indemnifying Party has actually been prejudiced by such
failure.

(b) Parent shall control any Tax Claim with respect to any Seller Group Tax
Return, and Buyer shall not participate in or control any such Tax Claim.

(c) With respect to any Tax Claim relating solely to a taxable period ending
on or prior to the Closing Date not described in Section 6.06(b), Parent shall
have the right to control, at Parent's expense, the conduct of such Tax Claim
unless Parent fails to provide Buyer with written notice of its election to
control such Tax Claim within ten (10) days of Parent's receipt of notice of
such Tax Claim in accordance with Section 6.06(a); provided, however, that (i)
Parent shall keep Buyer reasonably informed as to the status of such Tax Claim
and (ii) Buyer shall be entitled to participate, at its own expense, in any
such Tax Claim and Parent shall not settle or otherwise compromise such Tax
Claim without Buyer's written consent, which shall not be unreasonably
withheld, conditioned or delayed. If Parent does not elect to control a Tax
Claim pursuant to this Section 6.06(c) within the time period set forth above,
the Buyer shall control such Tax Claim; provided, however, that (A) Buyer
shall keep Parent reasonably informed as to the status of such Tax Claim and
(B) Buyer shall not settle or otherwise compromise such Tax Claim without
Parent's written consent, which shall not be unreasonably withheld,
conditioned or delayed.

(d) With respect to any Tax Claim relating to a Straddle Tax Period, to the
extent possible the Tax Items subject to such Tax Claim shall be distinguished
and each party shall control the 

defense and settlement of those Taxes for which it is liable. If any Tax Item
cannot be identified as being a Liability of only one party or cannot be
separated from a Tax Item for which the other party is liable, the party which
has the greater potential Liability for those Tax Items that cannot be so
attributed or separated (or both) shall control the defense and settlement of
the Tax Claim; provided, that, such party defends the items as reported on the
relevant Tax Return. With respect to any Tax Claim subject to this Section
6.06(d), (i) the controlling party shall keep the other party reasonably
informed as to the status of such Tax Claim and (ii) the non-controlling party
shall be entitled to participate, at its own expense, in any such Tax Claim
and the controlling party shall not settle or otherwise compromise such Tax
Claim without the other party's written consent, which shall not be
unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed.

Section 6.07. Coordination with Article IX. Except to the extent specifically
set forth in this Agreement, the recourse of any Buyer Indemnitee for any and
all Damages relating to or arising from Tax matters, including those set forth
in Section 3.14 or this Article VI, shall be controlled by this Article VI
rather than Article IX. In the event the provisions of Sections 6.05 or 6.06
and the provisions of Article IX conflict or otherwise each apply by their
terms, Section 6.05 or Section 6.06, as applicable, shall exclusively govern
all matters concerning Taxes; provided, that (a) Sections 9.04(d), 9.04(e),
9.04(f), 9.04(g), 9.04(h), 9.04(i), 9.04(j), 9.04(k), 9.05, 9.06 and 9.07
shall apply in any event, (b) the limitations contained in Section 9.04(c)
shall apply to indemnification under Section 6.05(a)(v) and (c) the
limitations contained in Sections 9.04(a), 9.04(b) and 9.04(c) shall apply to
indemnification under Section 6.05(a)(vi).

ARTICLE VII

EMPLOYEE MATTERS

Section 7.01. Employees.

(p) Subject in each case to all applicable Laws and the provisions of any
Bargaining Agreement, effective no later than immediately prior to the
Closing, Parent shall cause (i) all Business Employees to be employed by an
IPG Entity, (ii) the IPG Entities to adopt the New IPG Plans, and (iii) Buyer
or an IPG Entity as designated by Buyer to assume all obligations of Parent
under each individual retention and severance agreement listed in Schedules
1.01(f) and 1.01(g) on the Closing.

(q) For the one-year period following the Closing Date or such longer period
as may be required by applicable Law or Contract (the "Benefit Period"), the
IPG Entities shall provide the Business Employees with base salaries at least
equal to the base salaries that are in effect for Business Employees
immediately prior to the Closing, the opportunity to earn annual performance-
based bonuses and other non-cash employee benefits that are substantially
comparable in the aggregate to the benefits under IPG Plans and New IPG Plans
(collectively, the "Applicable Plans"); provided, 

that for purposes of determining comparability, any long-term or equity-based
incentives, retention bonuses, nonqualified deferred compensation, defined
benefit retirement benefits in the U.S., Canada, Ireland and the United
Kingdom, U.S. retiree medical health care insurance or contribution credits
and retiree life insurance benefits and de minimis fringe benefits shall be
disregarded.

(r) With respect to U.S. Business Employees, Buyer and its Subsidiaries shall,
to the extent commercially and administratively practicable, (i) give each
Business Employee credit under each employee benefit plan and personnel policy
of Buyer or its Subsidiaries that covers such Business Employee during the
Benefit Period (including any vacation, sick leave and severance policies) for
purposes of eligibility, vesting and entitlement to vacation, sick leave and
severance benefits for such Business Employee's service with Parent and its
Subsidiaries, (ii) allow such Business Employee to participate during the
Benefit Period in each plan providing health benefits (including medical,
dental and vision insurance) without regard to preexisting-condition
limitations, waiting periods, evidence of insurability or other exclusions or
limitations not imposed on such Business Employee by the corresponding
Applicable Plans immediately prior to the Closing Date, and (iii) credit such
Business Employee with any expenses that were covered by the Applicable Plans
that are health plans immediately prior to the Closing Date for purposes of
determining deductibles, co-pays and other applicable limits under any similar
replacement plans during the plan year in which the Closing Date occurs,
except in each case of clauses (i) through (iii) above, where such crediting
would result in duplicate benefits with respect to the same period of service
and only to the same extent such service was credited for the same purpose
under the Applicable Plan immediately prior to the Closing Date.

(s) Notwithstanding Section 7.01(b), the IPG Entities shall (i) following the
Closing Date, be solely responsible for the any retention, bonus, commission
and severance benefits owed to any Business Employee or former IPG Entity
employee pursuant to the Retention Agreements, the Severance Arrangements, any
IPG Plan or any Employment Arrangement, other than the Seller Retention
Amounts, and (ii) until December 31, 2015, continue to provide or make
available to eligible U.S. Business Employees not covered under a Bargaining
Agreement and the Severance Arrangements (or the equivalent thereof). U.S.
Business Employees covered under a Bargaining Agreement will continue under
the severance policy entitlements in their applicable Bargaining Agreement and
Non-U.S. Business Employees will continue under the severance policy
entitlements in their applicable employment agreements or as required by Law
or other written agreement.

(t) In connection with the obligations of Buyer under Section 7.01(a)(ii), as
of the Closing Date, the active participation of each Business Employee in the
defined contribution plans organized in the U.S. set forth in Schedule 7.01(e)
(the "Parent U.S. Defined Contribution Plans") shall cease. Each U.S. Business
Employee's account balance(s) will be transferred in accordance with this
Section 7.01(e). Effective on or before the Closing Date, Parent, the Sellers
or the IPG Entities shall establish one or more defined contribution plans
that are intended to comply with 

Section 401(a) of the Code to cover U.S. Business Employees after the Closing
(such plan or plans, the "New IPG 401(k) Plans") and to receive the transfer
of account balances from the Parent U.S. Defined Contribution Plans pursuant
to this Section 7.01(e). The Parties shall make any and all filings and
submissions to the IRS, the Department of Labor and any other applicable
Governmental Authority required to be made by them in connection with the
transfer of assets described below. Provided that Parent, the Sellers or the
IPG Entities have established the New IPG 401(k) Plans, and subject to the
preceding sentences, then, as soon as practicable after the Closing Date,
Parent shall cause the trustees of the Parent U.S. Defined Contribution Plans
to transfer in the form of cash or, with respect to loans to U.S. Business
Employees or otherwise upon Buyer's reasonable request, in kind, in accordance
with 414(l) of the Code, Treasury Regulation Section 1.414(l)-1 and Section
208 of ERISA, the full account balances (inclusive of such loans) of all U.S.
Business Employees, which account balances shall have been credited with
applicable earnings and contributions, if any, attributable to the period
ending on the close of business of the day immediately preceding the transfer
date, reduced by any benefit or withdrawal payments in respect of U.S.
Business Employees prior to the transfer date, to the trustee of the New IPG
401(k) Plans. Such transfer of assets shall occur as soon as administratively
practicable following the Closing Date. If shares of Parent's common stock are
held in the U.S. Business Employees' accounts under the Parent U.S. Defined
Contribution Plans and are transferred to the New IPG 401(k) Plans pursuant to
the preceding sentence, then unless a Business Employee otherwise directs, the
trustee of the New IPG 401(k) Plans shall continue to hold the shares of
Parent's common stock transferred pursuant to this Section 7.01(e) in a
separate account under such plan subject to the terms of the New IPG 401(k)
Plans. In consideration of the transfer of assets hereunder, the IPG Entities
shall cause the New IPG 401(k) Plans, effective as of the transfer date, to
assume all of the obligations of the Parent U.S. Defined Contribution Plans
solely with respect to the account balances of the Business Employees that are
actually transferred hereunder under the Parent U.S. Defined Contribution Plan
(exclusive of any portion of such account balances which are paid or otherwise
withdrawn prior to the transfer date). The IPG Entities shall not assume any
Parent U.S. Defined Contribution Plans or any other obligations or Liabilities
arising under or attributable to the Parent U.S. Defined Contribution Plans.
Notwithstanding the foregoing, in the event Buyer determines in good faith
that the "KSOP" features of a Parent U.S. Defined Contribution Plan create
material legal impediments to consummating a trustee-to-trustee transfer, then
in lieu of effecting a trustee-to-trustee transfer from such plan the IPG
Entities shall cause the New IPG 401(k) Plans to accept direct rollovers
(including direct rollovers of participant loans) of U.S. Business Employees
from such Parent U.S. Defined Contribution Plans.

(u) Except as set forth in this Agreement, Parent and the Non-IPG Subsidiaries
shall remain responsible for all, and shall pay and perform when due, all
Liabilities under each Employee Plan and each other plan, scheme, policy or
arrangement providing for compensation or benefits (including termination
indemnities, jubilee payments or similar defined benefit-type Liabilities) 

that is not an IPG Plan or New IPG Plan (an "Excluded Plan"), whether arising
prior to, on or after the Closing Date, including any such Liabilities arising
out of the status of the IPG Entities as an ERISA Affiliate of Parent or any
of the Non-IPG Subsidiaries prior to Closing and any UK Section 75 Debt (or
Liability arising from actions taken by the UK Pensions Regulator related
thereto), except in each case to the extent such Liabilities are expressly
assumed by the IPG Entities under this Agreement and included in the
calculation of Final Net Operating Assets. In addition, Parent shall retain
all liability for Employee CGP as if such amounts were Excluded Plans. The IPG
Entities shall be responsible for, and shall pay and perform when due, all
Liabilities under each IPG Plan or New IPG Plan, whether such Liabilities
arise prior to, on or after the applicable Closing Date.

(v) The Sellers, Buyer, Parent and the IPG Entities agree to cooperate and
provide each other such information as each may reasonably request in order to
administer the IPG Plans, New IPG Plans and the Excluded Plans with respect to
Business Employees following the Closing. In addition, Buyer, Parent and the
relevant IPG Entities will work together to develop a mutually satisfactory
process regarding the payment of the Employee CGP, including the withholding
of taxes (income and employment) and other legally required withholdings
thereon, and the payment and reporting of such withholdings over to the
necessary Governmental Authority or other Person entitled to such withholding.

(w) This Section 7.01 shall survive the Closing and shall be binding on all
successors and assigns of Parent, the Sellers, Buyer and the IPG Entities.
Nothing set forth in this Section 7.01 shall confer any rights or remedies
upon any employee or former employee of the IPG Entities, any Business
Employee or upon any other Person other than the parties hereto and their
respective successors and assigns or shall constitute the adoption,
termination or amendment to any IPG Plan, New IPG Plan or any other plan or
arrangement covering the Business Employees. Nothing in this Section 7.01
shall obligate Buyer, the IPG Entities or any of their respective Subsidiaries
to continue the employment of any Business Employee for any specific period.

ARTICLE IX 

INDEMNIFICATION

Section 9.01. Survival. Subject to Article VI relating to Taxes, the
representations and warranties of the Parties contained in this Agreement and
all covenants and agreements of the Parties contained in this Agreement that
are to be performed prior to the Closing shall survive the Closing for a
period of fifteen (15) months after the Closing Date; provided, that (i) the
Fundamental Representations and the representations and warranties contained
in Sections 4.01 (Organization and Qualification), 4.02 (Authorization), 4.07
(Solvency), 4.08 (Brokers) and 4.09 (Purchase for Investment) shall survive
indefinitely, and (ii) the representations and warranties contained in Section
3.11 (Environmental Matters) shall survive for a period of thirty-six (36)
months after the Closing Date. Subject to Article VI relating to Taxes, all of
the covenants and agreements contained in this Agreement that are to be
performed after the Closing shall survive the Closing until fully performed
and remain in full force and effect in accordance with their terms, unless and
only to the extent that non-compliance with such covenants or agreements is
waived in writing by the Party entitled to such performance. Notwithstanding
the preceding two sentences, any breach of any covenant, agreement,
representation or warranty in respect of which indemnification may be sought
under this Agreement shall survive the time at which it would otherwise
terminate pursuant to the preceding two sentences, if notice of such breach
giving rise to such right of indemnification shall have been given to the
Party against whom such indemnification may be sought prior to such time. The
Parties acknowledge and agree that with respect to any claim that any Party
may have against any other Party that is permitted pursuant to the terms of
this Agreement, the survival periods set forth and agreed to in this Section
9.01 shall govern when any such claim may be brought and shall replace and
supersede any statute of limitations that may otherwise be applicable.

Section 9.02. Indemnification.

(p) Subject to Article VI relating to Taxes and the provisions of this Article
IX, including the limitations set forth in Section 9.04, effective at and
after the Closing, Parent agrees to indemnify Buyer and its Affiliates,
directors, officers, employees, successors, permitted assigns, agents and
representatives (collectively, the "Buyer Indemnitees") against, and agrees to
hold each of them harmless from, any and all Damages incurred or suffered by
any Buyer Indemnitee to the extent arising out of or relating to:

(i) any breach of any representation or warranty of Parent or the Sellers in
this Agreement or any failure of any representation or warranty of Parent or
the Sellers in this Agreement to be true and correct as of the Closing (except
in the case of any representation or warranty that by its terms addresses
matters only as of another specified date, which need be so true and correct
only as of such specified date); 

(ii) any breach of any covenant or agreement made or to be performed by Parent
or the Sellers pursuant to this Agreement; or

(iii) without duplication, any Excluded Liability or any other Liability
arising in connection with or relating to any Retained Business.

(q) Subject to Article VI relating to Taxes and the provisions of this Article
IX, including the limitations set forth in Section 9.04, effective at and
after the Closing, Buyer agrees to indemnify Parent, the Sellers and their
respective Affiliates, directors, officers, employees, successors, permitted
assigns, agents and representatives (collectively, the "Seller Indemnitees")
against and agrees to hold each of them harmless from any and all Damages
incurred or suffered by any Seller Indemnitee to the extent arising out of or
relating to:

(iii) any breach of any representation or warranty of Buyer in this Agreement
or any failure of any representation or warranty of Buyer in this Agreement to
be true and correct as of the Closing (except in the case of any
representation or warranty that by its terms addresses matters only as of
another specified date, which need be so true and correct only as of such
specified date);

(iv) any breach of covenant or agreement made or to be performed by Buyer
pursuant to this Agreement; or

(v) without duplication, any Assumed Liability, any Liability of any IPG
Entity or any other Liability arising in connection with or relating to the
operation of the Business from and after the Closing, in each case, to the
extent the Buyer Indemnitees are not entitled to indemnification for Damages
arising out of or relating to such Assumed Liability or other Liability
pursuant to this Article IX.

(r) For purposes of determining whether a breach of any representation or
warranty has occurred for purposes of Section 9.02(a)(i) (except for any
breach of the representations and warranties in Sections 3.06 (Financial
Statements), 3.07 (Absence of Certain Developments), 3.16 (Material Contracts)
(with respect to the definition of Material Contracts set forth therein) or
3.22 (Reorganization), which shall not be subject to this Section 9.02(c)),
such determination shall be made without regard to any qualification or
exception contained in such representation or warranty relating to "material,"
"materiality," "material respects," "materially," "Material Adverse Effect" or
words of similar import or effect applicable thereto so long as the Damages
arising out of or relating to such breach would exceed $3,000,000.

(s) For purposes of determining the amount of Damages subject to
indemnification pursuant to Section 9.02(a)(i) (except for Damages arising out
of or relating to a breach of the representations and warranties in Sections
3.06 (Financial Statements), 3.07 (Absence of Certain 

Developments), 3.16 (Material Contracts) (with respect to the definition of
Material Contracts set forth therein) or 3.22 (Reorganization), which shall
not be subject to this Section 9.02(d)), such Damages shall be determined
without regard to any qualification or exception contained in such
representation or warranty relating to "material," "materiality," "material
respects," "materially," "Material Adverse Effect" or words of similar import
or effect applicable thereto.

Section 9.03. Procedures. Except with respect to Tax Claims, which are
addressed in Article VI, claims for indemnification under this Agreement shall
be asserted and resolved as follows:

(e) Any Buyer Indemnitee or Seller Indemnitee seeking indemnification under
this Agreement (an "Indemnified Party") with respect to any claim asserted
against the Indemnified Party by a third party ("Third Party Claim") in
respect of any matter that is subject to indemnification under Section 9.02
shall promptly notify in writing (a "Claim Notice") the other Party (the
"Indemnifying Party") of the Third Party Claim (and in any event within thirty
(30) Business Days after receipt by such Indemnified Party of written notice
of the Third Party Claim), which Claim Notice shall describe in reasonable
detail the nature of the Third Party Claim, including the basis of the
Indemnified Party's request for indemnification under this Agreement and a
reasonable estimate of any Damages suffered or expected to be suffered with
respect thereto (if available); provided, however, that failure to promptly or
completely provide such Claim Notice shall not relieve the Indemnifying Party
of its indemnification obligations provided under this Agreement except to the
extent the Indemnifying Party shall have been prejudiced as a result of such
failure or delay. The Indemnified Party shall promptly provide the
Indemnifying Party with a copy of all papers served with respect to such claim
(if any) promptly upon receipt thereof by the Indemnified Party.

(f) The Indemnifying Party shall have the right to participate in the defense
of any Third Party Claim at any time and, subject to the limitations contained
in this Section 9.03(b), assume and control the defense thereof. The
Indemnifying Party will promptly notify the Indemnified Party (and in any
event within thirty (30) Business Days after having received any Claim Notice)
with respect to whether or not it is exercising its right to assume and
control the defense of any such Third Party Claim (such election to be without
prejudice to the right of the Indemnifying Party to dispute whether such claim
is an indemnifiable Damage under this Article IX). If the Indemnifying Party
notifies the Indemnified Party that the Indemnifying Party elects to assume
and control the defense of the Third Party Claim, then the Indemnifying Party
shall have the right to defend such Third Party Claim with counsel selected by
the Indemnifying Party and not reasonably objected to by the Indemnified
Party, in all appropriate proceedings, to a final conclusion or settlement at
the discretion of the Indemnifying Party in accordance with this Section
9.03(b). The Indemnifying Party shall have full control of such defense and
proceedings, including any compromise or settlement thereof; provided,
however, that the Indemnifying Party shall not enter into any settlement 

agreement without the written consent of the Indemnified Party (which consent
shall not be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed). Notwithstanding
the foregoing, such consent shall not be required if (i) the settlement
agreement contains a complete and unconditional general release by the third
party asserting the Third Party Claim to all Indemnified Parties affected by
the Third Party Claim and (ii) the settlement agreement does not contain any
admission by, or sanction or restriction upon the conduct or operation of any
business conducted by, the Indemnified Party or its Affiliates (including any
proceeding that seeks an injunction or other equitable relief against the
Indemnified Party or its Affiliates). The Indemnified Party may participate
in, but not control, any defense or settlement of any Third Party Claim
controlled by the Indemnifying Party pursuant to this Section 9.03(b), and the
Indemnified Party shall bear its own costs and expenses with respect to such
participation unless the employment of separate legal counsel has been
specifically authorized in writing by the Indemnifying Party. Notwithstanding
the foregoing, the Indemnifying Party shall not be entitled to assume the
defense of any Third Party Claim (and shall be liable for the reasonable fees
and expenses of counsel incurred by the Indemnified Party in defending such
Third Party Claim) if (A) (1) the Third Party Claim seeks an order, injunction
or other equitable relief or relief for other than money damages against the
Indemnified Party that the Indemnified Party reasonably determines, after
conferring with its outside counsel, cannot be separated from any claim for
money damages, and (2) in the event the Third Party Claim were to be decided
adversely to the Indemnified Party, such a decision could reasonably be
expected to materially impair the conduct of the business conducted by the
Indemnified Party; provided, that if such equitable relief or other relief
portion of the Third Party Claim can be so separated from that for money
damages, the Indemnifying Party shall be entitled to assume the defense of the
portion relating to money damages, (B) the Third Party Claim seeks money
damages, and in the event the Third Party Claim were to be decided adversely
to the Indemnified Party, such a decision could reasonably be expected to
result in Damages for which the Indemnified Party would be responsible for a
greater portion of the Damages related to such Third Party Claim than the
Indemnifying Party; or (C) the Indemnified Party shall have been advised by
counsel that the assumption of such defense by the Indemnifying Party would be
inappropriate due to a material conflict of interest. Notwithstanding anything
set forth in this Section 9.03(b) to the contrary, if the Indemnifying Party
has assumed the defense and the Indemnifying Party fails to actively and
diligently pursue the defense of such Third Party Claim, then the Indemnified
Party shall be entitled to retain or otherwise reassume the defense of such
Third Party Claims (and, for the avoidance of doubt, the provisions of Section
9.03(c) shall apply).

(g) If the Indemnifying Party does not notify the Indemnified Party that the
Indemnifying Party elects to defend the Indemnified Party pursuant to Section
9.03(b) within thirty (30) Business Days after receipt of any Claim Notice,
then the Indemnified Party shall defend itself against the applicable Third
Party Claim, and be reimbursed for its reasonable cost and expense (but only
if the Indemnified Party is actually entitled to indemnification hereunder) in
regard to the Third Party 

Claim with counsel selected by the Indemnified Party, in all appropriate
proceedings and in good faith, which proceedings shall be prosecuted
diligently by the Indemnified Party. In such circumstances, the Indemnified
Party shall defend any such Third Party Claim in good faith and have full
control of such defense and proceedings; provided, however, that the
Indemnified Party may not enter into any compromise or settlement of such
Third Party Claim if indemnification is to be sought hereunder, without the
Indemnifying Party's consent (which consent shall not be unreasonably
withheld, conditioned or delayed). The Indemnifying Party may participate in,
but not control, any defense or settlement controlled by the Indemnified Party
pursuant to this Section 9.03(c), and the Indemnifying Party shall bear its
own costs and expenses with respect to such participation; provided, however,
the Indemnifying Party shall be entitled (to the extent permitted under
Section 9.03(b)) to assume the defense of such Third Party Claim in accordance
with Section 9.03(b). For the avoidance of doubt, if the Indemnifying Party
does notify the Indemnified Party that the Indemnifying Party elects to defend
the Indemnified Party pursuant to Section 9.03(b) and this Section 9.03(c),
the Indemnifying Party shall be liable for the reasonable fees and expenses of
counsel employed by the Indemnified Party for any period during which the
Indemnifying Party has not assumed the defense thereof (but only if the
Indemnified Party is actually entitled to indemnification hereunder).

(h) If requested by the Indemnifying Party, the Indemnified Party agrees, at
the sole cost and expense of the Indemnifying Party, to reasonably cooperate
with the Indemnifying Party and its counsel in contesting any Third Party
Claim that the Indemnifying Party elects to contest, including providing
reasonable access to documents, records and information. In addition, the
Indemnified Party will make its personnel reasonably available at no cost to
the Indemnifying Party for conferences, discovery, proceedings, hearings,
trials or appeals as may be reasonably requested by the Indemnifying Party. If
the Indemnifying Party has assumed the defense of a Third Party Claim, the
Indemnified Party also agrees to reasonably cooperate with the Indemnifying
Party and its counsel in the making of any related counterclaim against the
Person asserting the Third Party Claim or any cross complaint against any
Person and executing powers of attorney to the extent necessary unless doing
so would materially impair the conduct of the business conducted by the
Indemnified Party.

(i) A claim for indemnification for any matter not involving a Third Party
Claim shall be asserted by notice to the Indemnifying Party as promptly as
practicable, which notice shall describe in reasonable detail the nature of
the claim and the basis of the Indemnified Party's request for indemnification
under this Agreement; provided, however, that failure to promptly or
completely provide such notice shall not relieve the Indemnifying Party of its
indemnification obligations provided under this Agreement except to the extent
the Indemnifying Party shall have been prejudiced as a result of such failure
or delay. 

Section 9.04. Limitations on Liability. Notwithstanding anything to the
contrary in this Article IX:

(d) Parent shall not be liable to indemnify an Indemnified Party for (i) any
breach of any representation or warranty of Parent or the Sellers set forth in
this Agreement or (ii) any breach of Section 5.01 (other than a willful and
intentional breach thereof), in either case, attributable to a single course
of conduct or related set of facts, events or circumstances, unless the amount
of Damages actually incurred by the Buyer Indemnitees for such breach and
related breaches exceeds $350,000 ("De Minimis Amount"); provided, however,
that Parent shall not be liable to indemnify an Indemnified Party for any
breach of any representation or warranty of Parent or the Sellers contained in
Section 3.14 attributable to a single course of conduct or related set of
facts, events or circumstances, unless the amount of Damages actually incurred
by the Buyer Indemnitees for such breach and related breaches exceeds $100,000
("Tax de Minimis Amount");

(e) Parent shall not be liable to indemnify an Indemnified Party for (i) any
breach of any representation or warranty of Parent or the Sellers set forth in
this Agreement or (ii) any breach of Section 5.01 (other than a willful and
intentional breach thereof), in either case, unless the aggregate amount of
Damages actually incurred by the Buyer Indemnitees for such breach and all
other breaches otherwise subject to indemnification hereunder exceeds
$48,000,000 (the "Deductible"), and then only to the extent such aggregate
Damages exceed such amount; provided, however, that the Deductible shall not
apply to indemnification for Damages pursuant to Section 9.02(a)(ii) (other
than relating to Section 5.01 for Damages that are not as a result of a
willful and intentional breach thereof) or Section 9.02(a)(iii), nor shall the
Deductible apply to indemnification for Damages arising out of or resulting
from any breach of any Fundamental Representation (and, for the avoidance of
doubt, (A) Damages attributable to a single course of conduct or related set
of facts, events or circumstances that do not exceed the De Minimis Amount or
the Tax De Minimis Amount, as applicable, pursuant to Section 9.04(a) and
6.05(a)(vi), respectively, shall not be counted towards the calculation of the
Deductible, and (B) Damages indemnifiable on account of any breach of any
Fundamental Representation shall not be counted towards the calculation of the
Deductible for any other breaches subject to the Deductible);

(f) in no event shall Parent's aggregate Liability arising out of or relating
to Section 9.02(a)(i), Section 9.02(a)(ii) (solely on account of any breach of
Section 5.01 (other than a willful and intentional breach thereof)), Section
6.05(a)(v) and Section 6.05(a)(vi) exceed $160,000,000 (the "Cap"); provided,
however, that the Cap shall not apply to indemnification for Damages arising
out of or resulting from any breach of any Fundamental Representation;

(g) notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement, in no event
shall Parent's aggregate Liability arising out of or relating to Section
9.02(a)(i), Section 9.02(a)(ii) or Section 6.05 exceed the Purchase Price; 

(h) in no event shall Parent be liable under Section 9.02(a) or Section 6.05
for any Damages arising from an action taken or not taken by Parent or the
Sellers at the express written request of or with the express written consent
of Buyer;

(i) Buyer Indemnitees shall not have a right to assert claims for
indemnification under any provision of this Agreement (including Section 6.05)
for Damages to the extent (and only to the extent) that such Damages arise out
of actions taken (or omitted to be taken) by Buyer, the IPG Entities or any
Buyer Indemnitee after the Closing Date;

(j) no Buyer Indemnitee shall be entitled to indemnification under Section
6.05(a) or this Article IX to the extent a Liability or reserve relating to
the matter giving rise to such Damages has been included in the calculation of
Final Net Operating Assets or to the extent such Buyer Indemnitee has
otherwise been compensated with respect thereto pursuant to the post-Closing
adjustment contemplated by Section 2.06;

(k) each Indemnified Party shall have a duty to use commercially reasonable
efforts to mitigate any Damages arising out of or relating to this Agreement
or the transactions contemplated hereby after becoming aware of the incurrence
of such Damages, including incurring the minimum costs (which shall be
Damages) necessary to remedy any breach that gives rise to such Damages;

(l) the amount of any Damages for which an Indemnified Party claims
indemnification under this Agreement shall be reduced by the amount of (i) any
insurance proceeds actually received from third party insurers with respect to
such Damages; (ii) any Tax Benefit Actually Realized within two (2) years of
the time when such Damages are recognized for Tax purposes, which Tax Benefit
is attributable to such Damages, and (iii) any indemnification, contribution,
offset or reimbursement payments actually received from third parties with
respect to such Damages, in each case of clauses (i) through (iii) above, net
of any reasonable costs associated with recovery of such amounts; provided,
that such Indemnified Party shall use commercially reasonable efforts to
obtain recoveries from insurers, including title insurers, and other third
parties in respect of this Section 9.04(i); provided, further, that an
Indemnified Party shall use commercially reasonable efforts to cause any Tax
Benefit to be Actually Realized with respect to such Damages to the extent
permitted by applicable Law. If an Indemnified Party (A) actually receives
insurance proceeds from third party insurers with respect to such Damages, (B)
has a Tax Benefit Actually Realized, or (C) actually receives indemnification,
contribution, offset or reimbursement payments from third parties with respect
to such Damages, in each case, at any time subsequent to any indemnification
payment pursuant to Section 6.05 or this Article IX, then such Indemnified
Party shall promptly reimburse the applicable Indemnifying Party for any
payment made or expense incurred by such Indemnifying Party in connection with
providing such indemnification up to such amount actually received by such
Indemnified Party. Notwithstanding the foregoing, nothing in this Section
9.04(i) shall apply 

to any Transactional Insurance Policy or any proceeds received pursuant to any
Transactional Insurance Policy;

(m) in the event an Indemnified Party shall recover Damages in respect of a
claim of indemnification under this Article IX or Section 6.05, no other
Indemnified Party shall be entitled to recover the same Damages in respect of
a claim for indemnification;

(n) notwithstanding anything provided under applicable Law, no Party shall
have any Liability (including under Article III, Article VI or this Article
IX) for, and Damages shall not include, any punitive, incidental,
consequential, special or indirect Damages (including lost profits, loss in
value or any damages that are based on a multiple of earnings), in each case,
except to the extent any such Damages are awarded and paid with respect to a
Third Party Claim as to which a Party is entitled to indemnification under
this Agreement; and

(o) THE RIGHTS OF INDEMNIFICATION SET FORTH IN THIS ARTICLE IX SHALL BE
ENFORCEABLE REGARDLESS OF WHETHER ANY PERSON (INCLUDING ANY INDEMNIFYING
PARTY) ALLEGES OR PROVES THE SOLE, CONCURRENT, CONTRIBUTORY OR COMPARATIVE
NEGLIGENCE OF THE INDEMNIFIED PARTY OR THE SOLE OR CONCURRENT STRICT LIABILITY
IMPOSED ON THE INDEMNIFIED PARTY.

Section 9.05. Assignment of Claims. If the Indemnified Party receives any
payment from an Indemnifying Party in respect of any Damages pursuant to
Section 9.02 or Section 6.05 and the Indemnified Party is entitled to recover
all or a part of such Damages from a third party (a "Potential Contributor")
based on the underlying claim asserted against the Indemnifying Party, the
Indemnified Party shall, to the extent permitted by Law and any pertinent
Contract, assign such of its rights to proceed against the Potential
Contributor as are necessary to permit the Indemnifying Party to recover from
the Potential Contributor the amount of such payment.

Section 9.06. Exclusivity.

(g) After the Closing, other than as set forth in Section 2.06 or Section
11.09, the sole and exclusive remedy for any and all claims, Damages or other
matters arising under, out of, or related to this Agreement or the
transactions contemplated hereby, including in the case of fraud, shall be the
rights of indemnification set forth in Section 6.05 and this Article IX only,
and no Person will have any other entitlement, remedy or recourse, whether in
contract, tort, strict liability, equitable remedy or otherwise, it being
agreed that all of such other remedies, entitlements and recourse are
expressly waived and released by the Parties to the fullest extent permitted
by Law. This Section 9.06(a) will not operate to interfere with or impede the
operation of the covenants contained in this Agreement that by their nature
are required to be performed after the Closing, with respect to a Party's
right to seek equitable remedies (including specific performance or injunctive
relief) pursuant 

to Section 11.09. The provisions of this Section 9.06(a), together with
Section 11.09 and the covenants contained in this Agreement that by their
nature are required to be performed after the Closing (including Section
2.06), were specifically bargained-for between the Sellers and Parent, on the
one hand, and Buyer, on the other hand, and were taken into account by the
Parties in arriving at the Purchase Price. Each Party, respectively,
specifically relied upon the provisions of this Section 9.06(a) in agreeing to
the Purchase Price and in agreeing to provide the specific representations and
warranties set forth in Article III (in the case of Parent and the Sellers)
and Article IV (in the case of Buyer).

(h) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary herein, in the case of fraud, (i)
the provisions of this Article IX shall not apply (other than Section 9.03,
Section 9.06 and Section 9.07, which shall apply) with respect to any
indemnification claim under this Agreement to the extent arising out of such
fraud and (ii) any such claim of fraud shall survive the Closing indefinitely.
For purposes of this Section 9.06, "fraud" shall mean fraud as defined under
the law of the State of Delaware and, for the avoidance of doubt, shall not
include constructive fraud, negligent misrepresentation or other similar
theory.

Section 9.07. Characterization of Indemnity Payments. The Parties agree that
any indemnification payments made pursuant to this Section 6.05 or Article IX
shall be treated for all Tax purposes as an adjustment to the Purchase Price
unless otherwise required by applicable Law.

ARTICLE X

TERMINATION

Section 10.01. Termination. This Agreement may be terminated and the
transactions contemplated hereby may be abandoned at any time prior to the
Closing:

(t) by mutual written agreement of Parent and Buyer;

(u) by Parent or Buyer, if any Governmental Authority having competent
jurisdiction has issued a final, non-appealable order, decree, ruling or
injunction or taken any other Action permanently restraining, enjoining or
otherwise prohibiting the transactions contemplated by this Agreement;
provided, that this right of termination shall not be available to any Party
whose failure to comply with its obligations under this Agreement has been the
primary cause of, or has primarily resulted in, such order, decree, ruling,
injunction or other Action;

(v) by Parent or Buyer, if the Closing shall not have occurred on or prior to
August 1, 2014 (the "Outside Date"); provided, that this right of termination
shall not be available to any Party whose failure to comply with its
obligations under this Agreement has been the primary cause of, or has
primarily resulted in, the failure of the Closing to occur on or prior to such
date; 

(w) by Buyer upon written notice to Parent, in the event of a breach of any
representation, warranty, covenant or agreement on the part of Parent or any
Seller, such that the conditions specified in Section 8.02 would not be
satisfied at the Closing, and which, (i) with respect to any such breach that
is capable of being cured, is not cured by Parent or the applicable Seller
within thirty (30) days after receipt of written notice thereof, or (ii) is
incapable of being cured prior to the Outside Date; provided, that Buyer shall
not have the right to terminate this Agreement pursuant to this Section
10.01(d) if it is then in breach of any of its representations, warranties,
covenants or agreements set forth in this Agreement to the extent such breach
would give rise to the failure of a condition set forth in Section 8.03;

(x) by Parent upon written notice to Buyer, in the event of a breach of any
representation, warranty, covenant or agreement contained in this Agreement on
the part of Buyer, such that the conditions specified in Section 8.03 would
not be satisfied at the Closing, and which, (i) with respect to any such
breach that is capable of being cured, is not cured by Buyer within thirty
(30) days after receipt of written notice thereof, or (ii) is incapable of
being cured prior to the Outside Date; provided, that Parent shall not have
the right to terminate this Agreement pursuant to this Section 10.01(e) if
Parent or any Seller is then in breach of any of its representations,
warranties, covenants or agreements set forth in this Agreement to the extent
such breach would give rise to the failure of a condition set forth in Section
8.02; or

(y) by Parent, if (i) all of the conditions set forth in Sections 8.01 and
8.02 (other than those conditions that by their nature are to be satisfied by
actions taken at the Closing, each of which is capable of being satisfied,
other than those conditions that have not been satisfied as a result of
Buyer's breach of this Agreement, the Commitment Letters or the Debt Financing
Documents) have been satisfied or waived, (ii) Parent has irrevocably
confirmed in writing to Buyer that (A) all of the conditions set forth in
Section 8.03 (other than those conditions that by their nature are to be
satisfied by actions taken at the Closing) have been satisfied or have been
waived by Parent and (B) Parent and the Sellers are prepared to consummate the
Closing; provided that such confirmation shall not be delivered earlier than
the date that the Closing should have occurred pursuant to Section 2.03, and
(iii) Buyer fails to consummate the Closing within three (3) Business Days
following the date on which the confirmation has been delivered to the Buyer;
provided, that, for the avoidance of doubt, during such three (3) Business Day
period following the date on which the confirmation has been delivered to the
Buyer, no Party shall be entitled to terminate this Agreement pursuant to
Section 10.01(c).

Section 10.02. Effect of Termination; Termination Fee.

(j) In the event of termination of this Agreement pursuant to Section 10.01,
this Agreement shall forthwith become null and void and have no effect,
without any Liability on the part of any Party hereto; provided, however, that
the last sentence of Section 5.03(b) and the 

provisions of Section 5.16(d), this Section 10.02 and Article XI hereof shall
survive any termination of this Agreement and, except as set forth in Section
10.02, nothing herein shall relieve a Party from Liability for any willful,
intentional and material uncured breach of covenant, agreement, representation
or warranty set forth in this Agreement, in any case occurring or existing on
or prior to such termination; provided, further, following the termination of
this Agreement pursuant to Section 10.01, the Liability of any Party for such
breaches shall not exceed an aggregate amount equal to the amount of the
Termination Fee (plus, in the case of Buyer, the other amounts pursuant clause
(A) and (B) of Section 10.02(b) and the payment of any other amounts due
pursuant to the last sentence Section 5.03(b) and Section 5.16(d)). The
Confidentiality Agreement shall not be affected by a termination of this
Agreement.

(k) In the event that this Agreement is terminated (i) by Parent pursuant to
Section 10.01(e) or Section 10.01(f) or (ii) by Parent or Buyer pursuant to
Section 10.01(c) at a time when this Agreement was terminable by Parent
pursuant to Section 10.01(e) (determined without regard to any applicable cure
period otherwise available thereunder) or Section 10.01(f), then, in either
case, Buyer shall promptly, but in no event later than two (2) Business Days
after the date of such termination, pay or cause to be paid to Parent or its
designees an amount equal to $208,000,000 (the "Termination Fee") by wire
transfer of immediately available funds. If Buyer fails to pay the Termination
Fee when due, and, in order to obtain such payment, Parent commences an Action
that results in a judgment against Buyer for the Termination Fee, Buyer shall
pay to Parent, together with the Termination Fee, (A) interest on the
Termination Fee from the date of termination of this Agreement at a rate per
annum equal to the Prime Rate and (B) Parent's costs and expenses (including
reasonable attorneys' fees) in connection with such Action. Without limiting
Parent's right to obtain an award of specific performance permitted by Section
11.09, solely for purposes of establishing the basis for the amount thereof,
and without in any way increasing the amount of the Termination Fee or
expanding the circumstances in which the Termination Fee is to be paid, it is
agreed that the Termination Fee is a liquidated damage, and not a penalty. For
the avoidance of doubt, in no event shall Buyer be required to pay the
Termination Fee on more than one occasion.

(l) In the event that Parent receives full payment of the Termination Fee and
other amounts pursuant clause (A) and (B) of Section 10.02(b) and the payment
of any other amounts due pursuant to the last sentence Section 5.03(b) and
Section 5.16(d), the receipt of such Termination Fee and such other amounts
together with such additional amounts pursuant to the last sentence of Section
5.03(b) and Section 5.16(d) shall be the sole and exclusive remedy of Parent
and the Sellers against (i) Buyer and the former, current and future holders
of any equity, partnership or limited liability company interest, controlling
persons, directors, officers, employees, agents, attorneys, Affiliates,
members, managers, general or limited partners, stockholders, assignees of
Buyer, and any future holders of any equity, partnership or limited liability
company interest, controlling persons, directors, officers, employees, agents,
attorneys, Affiliates, members, managers, general or limited partners,
stockholders, assignees of any of the foregoing (the Persons described in this 

Section 10.02(c)(i), collectively, the "Buyer Group") for any Damages suffered
as a result of any breach of any representation, warranty, covenant or
agreement set forth herein, or the failure of the transactions contemplated by
this Agreement to be consummated, and (ii) any lender or prospective lender,
lead arranger, arranger, agent or Representative of or to Buyer, including,
each party to the Debt Commitment Letter, and their respective Affiliates, and
their respective officers, directors, employees, agents, successors and
assigns (those under this Section 10.02(c)(ii), the "Lender Group").

(m) Any claim or cause of action based upon, arising out of, or related to
this Agreement, the Limited Guaranty, the Equity Commitment Letter or any
other Transaction Document may only be brought against Persons that are
expressly named as parties hereto or thereto, respectively. No former, current
or future direct or indirect equity holders, controlling Persons,
stockholders, directors, officers, employees, members, managers, agents,
Affiliates, general or limited partners or assignees of the Parent, the
Sellers, the IPG Entities, Buyer, the Guarantor or any former, current or
future direct or indirect equity holder, controlling Person, stockholder,
director, officer, employee, member, manager, general or limited partner,
Affiliate, agent or assignee of any of the foregoing shall have any Liability
or obligation for any of the representations, warranties, covenants,
agreements, obligations or Liabilities of the Parent, the Sellers or Buyer
under this Agreement or of or for any Action based on, in respect of, or by
reason of, the transactions contemplated hereby (including the breach,
termination or failure to consummate such transactions), in each case whether
based on contract, tort or strict liability, by the enforcement of any
assessment, by any legal or equitable proceeding, by virtue of any applicable
Law or otherwise and whether by or through attempted piercing of the corporate
or partnership veil, by or through a claim by or on behalf of any Party or
other Person or otherwise.

(n) The Parties acknowledge that the agreements contained in this Section
10.02 are an integral part of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement,
and that, without these agreements, the Parties would not enter into this
Agreement.

such amendment or waiver is in writing and is signed, in the case of an
amendment, by Parent and Buyer, or in the case of a waiver, by the Party
against whom the waiver is to be effective.

(q) No failure or delay by any Party in exercising any right, power or
privilege hereunder shall operate as a waiver thereof, nor shall any single or
partial exercise thereof preclude any other or further exercise thereof or the
exercise of any other right, power or privilege. Except as otherwise provided
in Section 9.06 or Section 10.02, the rights and remedies herein provided
shall be cumulative and not exclusive of any rights or remedies provided by
Law.

(r) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained herein, Sections 10.02,
11.04(d) and 11.05 and this Section 11.02(c) (and any provision of this
Agreement to the extent a modification, waiver or termination of such
provision would modify the substance of Sections 10.02, 11.04(c), 11.04(d) and
11.05 and this Section 11.02(c)) may not be modified, waived or terminated in
a manner that is adverse in any material respect to the Financing Sources
without the prior written consent of the Financing Sources.

Section 11.03. Expenses. Regardless of whether the transactions provided for
in this Agreement are consummated, except as otherwise provided herein, each
Party shall pay its own expenses incident to this Agreement and the
transactions contemplated herein.

Section 11.04. Governing Law; Jurisdiction; WAIVER OF JURY TRIAL. 

(i) This Agreement, and all Actions (whether in contract or tort) that may be
based upon, arise out of or relate to this Agreement or the negotiation,
execution or performance hereof (including any claim or cause of action based
upon, arising out of or related to any representation or warranty made in or
in connection with this Agreement or as an inducement to enter into this
Agreement) shall be governed by and construed in accordance with the law of
the State of Delaware, without regard to the choice of law or conflicts of law
principles thereof. The Parties expressly waive any right they may have, now
or in the future, to demand or seek the application of a governing law other
than the law of the State of Delaware.

(j) Each of the Parties hereby irrevocably and unconditionally submits, for
itself and its property, to the exclusive jurisdiction of the Court of
Chancery of the State of Delaware or, if such court shall not have
jurisdiction, any federal court of the United States of America sitting in
Delaware, and any appellate court from any appeal thereof, in any Action
arising out of or relating to this Agreement or the other Transaction
Documents or the transactions contemplated hereby or thereby or for
recognition or enforcement of any judgment relating thereto, and each of the
parties hereby irrevocably and unconditionally (i) agrees not to commence any
such Action except in such courts, (ii) agrees that any claim in respect of
any such Action may be heard and determined in the Court of Chancery of the
State of Delaware or, to the extent permitted by Law, in such federal court,
(iii) waives, to the fullest extent it may legally and effectively do so, any
objection which it may now or hereafter have to the laying of venue of any
such Action in the Court of Chancery of the State of Delaware or such federal
court and (iv) waives, to the fullest extent permitted by Law, the defense of
an inconvenient forum to the maintenance of such Action in the Court of
Chancery of the State of Delaware or such federal court. Each of the Parties
agrees that a final judgment in any such Action shall be conclusive and may be
enforced in other jurisdictions by suit on the judgment or in any other manner
provided by Law. Each Party irrevocably consents to service of process in the
manner provided for notices in Section 11.01. Nothing in this Agreement will
affect the right of any party to this Agreement to serve process in any other
manner permitted by Law.

(k) EACH PARTY ACKNOWLEDGES AND AGREES THAT ANY CONTROVERSY WHICH MAY ARISE
UNDER THIS AGREEMENT IS LIKELY TO INVOLVE COMPLICATED AND DIFFICULT ISSUES,
AND THEREFORE IT HEREBY IRREVOCABLY AND UNCONDITIONALLY WAIVES ANY RIGHT IT
MAY HAVE TO A TRIAL BY JURY IN RESPECT OF ANY LITIGATION DIRECTLY OR
INDIRECTLY ARISING OUT OF OR RELATING TO THIS AGREEMENT, THE DEBT COMMITMENT
LETTER AND ANY OF THE OTHER TRANSACTION DOCUMENTS OR THE TRANSACTIONS
CONTEMPLATED HEREBY OR THEREBY. EACH PARTY CERTIFIES AND ACKNOWLEDGES THAT (I)
NO REPRESENTATIVE, AGENT OR ATTORNEY OF ANY OTHER PARTY HAS REPRESENTED,
EXPRESSLY OR OTHERWISE, THAT SUCH OTHER PARTY WOULD NOT, IN THE EVENT OF
LITIGATION, SEEK TO ENFORCE EITHER OF SUCH WAIVERS, (II) IT UNDERSTANDS AND
HAS CONSIDERED THE IMPLICATIONS OF SUCH WAIVERS, (III) IT MAKES SUCH 

WAIVERS VOLUNTARILY AND (IV) IT HAS BEEN INDUCED TO ENTER INTO THIS AGREEMENT
BY, AMONG OTHER THINGS, THE MUTUAL WAIVERS AND CERTIFICATIONS IN THIS SECTION
11.04(c).

(l) Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, each Party agrees (i)
that any action of any kind or nature, whether at law or equity, in contract,
in tort or otherwise, against a Financing Source in connection with this
Agreement, the Debt Financing or the transactions contemplated hereby or
thereby shall be brought exclusively in (A) a court of the State of New York
sitting in the Borough of Manhattan in the City of New York or (B) the United
States District Court for the Southern District of New York situated in the
Borough of Manhattan in the City of New York and each Party submits for itself
and its property with respect to any such action to the exclusive jurisdiction
of such courts, (ii) that service of process, summons, notice or document by
registered mail addressed to it at its address provided in Section 11.01 shall
be effective service of process against it for any such action brought in any
such court, (iii) to waive and hereby irrevocably waives, to the fullest
extent permitted by Law, any objection which it may now or hereafter have to
the laying of venue of, and the defense of an inconvenient forum to the
maintenance of, any such Action in any such court, (iv) that a final judgment
in any such Action shall be conclusive and may be enforced in other
jurisdictions by suit on the judgment or in any other manner provided by Law,
(v) that the Laws of the State of New York shall govern any such Action and
(vi) to irrevocably waive and hereby waives any right to a trial by jury in
any such action to the same extent such rights are waived pursuant to Section
11.04(c).

Section 11.05. Assignment; Successors and Assigns; No Third Party
Beneficiaries. Except as otherwise provided herein, this Agreement may not,
without the prior written consent of the other Parties, be assigned by
operation of Law or otherwise, and any attempted assignment shall be null and
void; provided, however, that (1) Buyer may assign its rights under this
Agreement and the other Transaction Documents, in whole or in part, to one or
more Buyer Designee and (2) Buyer may collaterally assign this Agreement and
the other Transaction Documents, in whole or in part, to any Financing Source
or any other party providing debt financing to Buyer or its Subsidiaries (in
each case, unless to do so would restrict or delay the consummation of the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement), but no such assignment shall
relieve either party of its obligations hereunder. Subject to the foregoing,
this Agreement shall be binding upon and inure to the benefit of the Parties
and their respective heirs, successors, permitted assigns and legal
representatives. No provision of this Agreement is intended to confer any
rights, benefits, remedies or Liabilities hereunder upon any Person other than
the Parties and their respective successors and assigns; provided, however,
that (a) the Financing Sources shall be express third party beneficiaries of
and have the right to enforce Sections 10.02, 11.02(c), 11.04(c), and 11.04(d)
and this Section 11.05, (b) the Indemnified Parties shall be express third
party beneficiaries of and have the right to enforce Article IX, (c) the DandO
Indemnitees shall be express third party beneficiaries of and have the right
to enforce Section 5.17 from and after the Closing, (d) the ITW Indemnitors
shall be express third 

party beneficiaries of and have the right to enforce Section 5.17(e) from and
after the Closing, and (e) the Guarantor shall be an express third party
beneficiary of and have the right to enforce Section 10.02(c) and Section
10.02(d).

Section 11.06. Counterparts; Effectiveness. This Agreement may be signed in
any number of counterparts, each of which shall be an original, with the same
effect as if the signatures thereto and hereto were upon the same instrument.
This Agreement shall become effective when each Party shall have received a
counterpart hereof signed by all of the other Parties. Until and unless each
Party has received a counterpart hereof signed by the other Parties, this
Agreement shall have no effect and no Party shall have any right or obligation
hereunder (whether by virtue of any other oral or written agreement or other
communication). The exchange of a fully executed Agreement (in counterparts or
otherwise) by electronic transmission in .PDF or other equivalent format or by
facsimile shall be sufficient to bind the Parties to the terms and conditions
of this Agreement.

Section 11.07. Entire Agreement. This Agreement, including the Exhibits and
Schedules attached thereto, the Transaction Documents, the Equity Commitment
Letter and the Limited Guaranty constitute the entire agreement among the
Parties with respect to the matters covered hereby and supersedes all previous
written, oral or implied understandings among them with respect to such
matters.

Section 11.08. Severability. If any term, provision, covenant or restriction
of this Agreement is held by a court of competent jurisdiction or other
Governmental Authority to be invalid, void or unenforceable, the remainder of
the terms, provisions, covenants and restrictions of this Agreement shall
remain in full force and effect and shall in no way be affected, impaired or
invalidated so long as the economic or legal substance of the transactions
contemplated hereby is not affected in any manner materially adverse to any
Party. Upon such a determination, the Parties shall negotiate in good faith to
modify this Agreement so as to affect the original intent of the Parties as
closely as possible in an acceptable manner in order that the transactions
contemplated hereby be consummated as originally contemplated to the fullest
extent possible.

Section 11.09. Specific Performance.

(c) The Parties agree that irreparable damage would occur in the event that
any of the provisions of this Agreement were not performed in accordance with
their specific terms or were otherwise breached and that any breach of this
Agreement would not be adequately compensated by monetary damages. Except as
otherwise set forth in this Section 11.09, including the limitations set forth
herein, the Parties acknowledge and agree that, prior to the valid termination
of this Agreement pursuant to Section 10.01, Buyer, on the one hand, and
Parent and the Sellers, on the other hand, shall, in the event of any breach
or threatened breach by Parent and the Sellers, on the one hand, or Buyer, on
the other hand, of any of their respective covenants or agreements set forth 

in this Agreement, be entitled to equitable relief, including an injunction or
injunctions to prevent or restrain breaches or threatened breaches of this
Agreement, by the other, as applicable, and to specifically enforce the terms
and provisions of this Agreement to prevent breaches or threatened breaches
of, or to enforce compliance with, the covenants and agreements of the other
under this Agreement. The Parties hereto have specifically bargained for the
right to specific performance of the obligations hereunder, in accordance with
the terms and conditions of this Section 11.09, notwithstanding the potential
for payment of the Termination Fee in the event of the termination of this
Agreement in accordance with Section 10.02.

(d) Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, it is acknowledged and
agreed that Parent and the Sellers shall only be entitled to specific
performance of Buyer's obligations to cause the Equity Financing to be funded
and to consummate the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, including
by demanding Buyer to enforce the obligations of the parties to the Equity
Commitment Letter and Buyer's rights thereunder, in the event that each of the
following conditions has been satisfied: (i) all of the conditions set forth
in Sections 8.01 and 8.02 have been satisfied or waived (other than those
conditions that by their nature are to be satisfied by actions taken at the
Closing, each of which is capable of being satisfied, other those conditions
have not been satisfied as a result of Buyer's breach of this Agreement, the
Commitment Letters or the Debt Financing Documents), (ii) Buyer fails to
complete the Closing on the date the Closing should have occurred in
accordance with Section 2.03, (iii) the Debt Financing has been funded or will
be funded at the Closing if the Equity Financing is funded at the Closing and
(iv) Parent and the Sellers have irrevocably confirmed in writing that the
Closing will occur if specific performance is granted and the Debt Financing
and Equity Financing are funded. For the avoidance of doubt, in no event shall
Parent be entitled to enforce specifically the Buyer's right to cause the
Equity Financing to be funded or to complete the transactions contemplated by
this Agreement if the Debt Financing has not been funded (or will not be
funded at the Closing if the Equity Financing is funded at the Closing).

(e) Each Party hereby agrees not to raise any objections to the availability
of the equitable remedy of specific performance when available pursuant to the
terms of this Agreement to prevent or restrain breaches of this Agreement by
such Party, and to specifically enforce the terms and provisions of this
Agreement to prevent breaches or threatened breaches of, or to enforce
compliance with, the covenants and agreements of such Party under this
Agreement in accordance with the terms of this Section 11.09. Any Party
seeking an injunction or injunctions to prevent breaches of this Agreement and
to enforce specifically the terms and provisions of this Agreement shall not
be required to provide any bond or other security in connection with such
order or injunction, all in accordance with the terms of this Section 11.09.
Each Party further agrees that (i) by seeking the remedies provided for in
this Section 11.09, a Party shall not in any respect waive its right to seek
any other form of relief that may be available to such party under this
Agreement, the Equity Commitment Letter or the Limited Guaranty in the event
that this Agreement has been terminated or in the event that the remedies
provided for in this Section 11.09 are not available or otherwise 

are not granted, and (ii) nothing set forth in this Section 11.09 shall
require any Party to institute any Action for (or limit any Party's right to
institute any Action for) specific performance under this Section 11.09 prior
or as a condition to exercising any termination right under Article X, nor
shall the commencement of any Action pursuant to this Section 11.09 or
anything set forth in this Section 11.09 restrict or limit any Party's right
to terminate this Agreement in accordance with the terms of Article X or
pursue any other remedies under this Agreement, the Equity Commitment Letter
or the Limited Guaranty that may be available then or thereafter.

Section 11.10. Disclosure Schedule. The Parties acknowledge and agree that (a)
the inclusion of any items or information in the Disclosure Schedules that are
not required by this Agreement to be so included is solely for the convenience
of Buyer, (b) the disclosure by Parent or the Sellers of any matter in the
Disclosure Schedules shall not be deemed to constitute an acknowledgement by
Parent or the Sellers that the matter is required to be disclosed by the terms
of this Agreement or that the matter is material or significant, (c) if any
section of the Disclosure Schedules lists an item or information in such a way
as to make its relevance to the disclosure required by or provided in another
section of the Disclosure Schedules or the statements contained in any Section
of this Agreement readily apparent on the face of such disclosure, the matter
shall be deemed to have been disclosed in or with respect to such other
section, notwithstanding the omission of an appropriate cross-reference to
such other section or the omission of a reference in the particular
representation and warranty to such section of the Disclosure Schedule, (d)
except as provided in clause (c) above, headings have been inserted in the
Disclosure Schedules for convenience of reference only, (e) the Disclosure
Schedules are qualified in their entirety by reference to specific provisions
of this Agreement, and (f) the Disclosure Schedules and the information and
statements contained therein are not intended to constitute, and shall not be
construed as constituting, representations or warranties of Parent or the
Sellers except as and to the extent provided in this Agreement.

Section 11.11. Retention of Counsel. Buyer, for itself and the IPG Entities,
and for Buyer's and the IPG Entities' respective successors and assigns,
irrevocably acknowledges and agrees that all communications between Parent and
the Sellers, on the one hand, and legal counsel, on the other hand, including
Latham and Watkins LLP, made in connection with the negotiation, preparation,
execution, delivery and closing under, or any dispute or Action arising under
or in connection with, this Agreement which, immediately prior to the Closing,
would be deemed to be privileged communications of Parent, the Sellers and/or
any of their respective Subsidiaries (including the IPG Entities) and their
counsel and would not be subject to disclosure to Buyer in connection with any
process relating to a dispute arising under or in connection with this
Agreement or otherwise, shall continue after the Closing to be privileged
communications between Parent, the Sellers and such counsel, and neither Buyer
nor any Person, acting or purporting to act on behalf of or through Buyer
shall seek to obtain the same by any process on the grounds that the privilege
attaching to such communications belongs to the IPG Entities and not Parent or
the Sellers. Buyer and the IPG 

Entities agree that any attorney-client privilege, attorney work-product
protection, and expectation of client confidence arising from or as a result
of counsel's representation of an IPG Entity, Seller or Parent prior to the
Closing, and all information and documents covered by such privilege or
protection, shall belong to and be controlled by Parent and may be waived only
by the Parent, and not an IPG Entity, and shall not pass to or be claimed or
used by Buyer or any IPG Entity, except with respect to the assertion of such
privilege or protection against a third party.

Section 11.12. Seal. The Parties acknowledge and agree that any
representations or warranties that contemplate an indefinite survival period
under Section 9.01, together with any claims for fraud under Section 9.06(b),
shall be subject to the 20-year statute of limitations applicable to sealed
instruments under Delaware law (and, for the avoidance of doubt, the Parties
expressly affirm their agreement that, with respect to any other claim that a
Party may have against any other Party that is permitted pursuant to the terms
of this Agreement, the survival periods set forth and agreed to in Section
6.05(d) and Section 9.01 shall govern when any such claim may be brought and
shall shorten, replace and supersede any statute of limitations that may
otherwise be applicable to sealed instruments or otherwise).
