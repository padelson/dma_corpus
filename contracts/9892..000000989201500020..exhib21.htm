<P>(e)&#9;<U>Adjustments to Exchange Ratio</U>. The Exchange Ratio, the Merger Consideration and any other relevant amounts and terms in this Agreement shall be appropriately adjusted to reflect fully the effect of: any stock split, reverse split, or

recapitalization, reclassification, readjustment, split up, combination or exchange of shares, or other like event with respect to Guarantor Common Shares or Company Common Stock, in any case occurring after the date hereof and prior to the Effective Time.</P>

taking into account all Certificates surrendered by such holder) cash (without interest) in an amount equal to such fraction multiplied by the Average Share Price.</P>

paid in lieu of fractional shares in exchange for outstanding Shares pursuant to Section 1.06(f) and the cash or other property in respect of any dividends or other distributions payable pursuant to Section 1.07(c).</P>
<P>(b)&#9;<U>Exchange Procedures</U>. As soon as reasonably practicable after the Effective Time, Parent will cause the Exchange Agent to mail to each holder of record of Certificates (i) a letter of transmittal (which shall specify that delivery shall
be effected, and risk of loss and title to the Certificates shall pass, only upon proper delivery of the Certificates to the Exchange Agent and shall be in such form and have such other provisions as Parent may reasonably specify), and (ii) instructions
to effect the surrender of the Certificates in exchange for the Guarantor Common Shares and cash in lieu of fractional shares. Upon surrender of a Certificate for cancellation to the Exchange Agent together with such letter of transmittal, duly executed,
and such other customary documents as may be required pursuant to such instructions, the holder of such Certificate shall be entitled to receive in exchange therefor solely (A) that number of whole Guarantor Common Shares which such holder has the right
to receive in accordance with Section 1.06(a) in respect of the Shares formerly evidenced by such Certificate and (B) cash in respect of fractional shares as provided in Section 1.06(f) (the Guarantor Common Shares and cash in respect of fractional shares
being referred to, collectively, as the "<U>Merger Consideration</U>"). Guarantor Common Shares may be delivered in uncertificated form pursuant to Guarantor's Direct Registration System. </P>
<P>The holder of such Certificate, upon its exchange for Guarantor Common Shares, shall also receive any dividends or other distributions to which such holder is entitled pursuant to Section 1.07(c). Certificates surrendered shall forthwith be canceled
following the Effective Time. In the event of a transfer of ownership of Shares which is not registered in the transfer records of the Company as of the Effective Time, the Merger Consideration, dividends and distributions may be issued and paid in
accordance with this Article I to a transferee if the Certificate evidencing such Shares is presented to the Exchange Agent, accompanied by all documents required to evidence and effect such transfer pursuant to this Section 1.07(b) and by evidence that
any applicable stock transfer taxes have been paid. Until so surrendered, each outstanding Certificate that, prior to the Effective Time, represented Shares will be deemed from and after the Effective Time, for all corporate purposes other than the
payment of dividends or other distributions, to evidence the ownership of the number of full Guarantor Common Shares, and cash in respect of fractional shares, into which such Shares shall have been so converted.</P>
<P>Shares held at the Effective Time in book-entry form shall be exchanged for Merger Consideration in accordance with the customary procedures of the Depository Trust Company.</P>
<P>(c)&#9;<U>Distributions with Respect to Unexchanged Shares</U>. No dividends or other distributions declared or made after the Effective Time with respect to Guarantor Common Shares with a record date after the Effective Time shall be paid to the
holder of any unsurrendered Certificate with respect to the Guarantor Common Shares such holder is entitled to receive until the holder of such Certificate shall surrender such Certificate in accordance with the provisions of Section 1.07(b). Subject to
applicable law, following surrender of any such Certificate, there shall be paid to the record holder of the whole Guarantor Common Shares issued in exchange therefor, without interest, at the time of such surrender, the amount of dividends or other
distributions with a record date after the Effective Time theretofore paid with respect to such whole Guarantor Common Shares.</P>
<P>(d)&#9;<U>Transfers of Ownership</U>. If any Guarantor Common Shares are to be delivered in a name other than that in which the Certificate surrendered in exchange therefor is registered, it will be a condition of the delivery thereof that the
Certificate so surrendered shall be properly endorsed and otherwise in proper form for transfer and that the person requesting such exchange shall have paid to Parent or any agent designated by it any transfer or other taxes required by reason of the
delivery of Guarantor Common Shares in any name other than that of the registered holder of the Certificate surrendered, or establish to the satisfaction of Parent or any agent designated by it that such tax has been paid or is not payable.</P>
<P>(e)&#9;<U>Escheat</U>. Neither Parent, Merger Sub nor the Company nor any of their respective affiliates shall be liable to any holder of Company Common Stock for any Merger Consideration delivered to a public official pursuant to any applicable
abandoned property, escheat or similar law.</P>
<P>(f)&#9;<U>Withholding Rights</U>. The Exchange Agent shall be entitled to deduct and withhold from the Merger Consideration otherwise payable pursuant to this Agreement to any holder of Company Common Stock, and from any cash dividends or other
distributions that the holder is entitled to receive under Section 1.07(c), such amounts as the Exchange Agent is required to deduct and withhold with respect to the making of such payment under the Code, or any provision of state, local or non-United
States tax law. To the extent that amounts are so withheld by the Exchange Agent, such portion of the Merger Consideration and other such amounts payable under Section 1.07(c) that are withheld shall be treated for all purposes of this Agreement as having
been received by the holder of the Shares in respect of which such deduction and withholding was made by the Exchange Agent.</P>
<P>(g)&#9;<U>Undistributed Merger Consideration</U>. Any portion of the Guarantor Common Shares, the cash to be paid in lieu of fractional shares and the cash or other property in respect of dividends or other distributions that the holder is entitled to
receive under Section 1.07(c) supplied to the Exchange Agent which remains undistributed to the holders of the Certificates for one year after the Effective Time shall be delivered to Parent, upon demand, and any holders of the Certificates who have not
theretofore complied with this Section 1.07 shall thereafter look only to Parent for payment of their claim for Merger Consideration and any dividends or distributions with respect to Guarantor Common Shares.</P>
<P>SECTION 1.08. <U>Stock Transfer Books</U>. At the Effective Time, the stock transfer books of the Company shall be closed, and there shall be no further registration of transfers of the Company Common Stock thereafter on the records of the Company.</P>

<P>SECTION 1.09. <U>No Further Ownership Rights in Company Common Stock</U>. The Merger Consideration delivered upon the surrender for exchange of Shares in accordance with the terms hereof shall be deemed to have been issued in full satisfaction of all
rights pertaining to such Shares, and there shall be no further registration of transfers on the records of the Surviving Corporation of Shares which were outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time. If, after the Effective Time, Certificates are
presented to the Surviving Corporation for any reason, they shall be canceled and exchanged as provided in this Article I.</P>
<P>SECTION 1.10. <U>Lost, Stolen or Destroyed Certificates</U>. In the event any Certificates shall have been lost, stolen or destroyed, the Exchange Agent shall issue in exchange for such lost, stolen or destroyed Certificates, upon the making of an
affidavit of that fact by the holder thereof, such Merger Consideration and any dividends or other distributions as may be required pursuant to this Article I; <U>provided</U>, <U>however</U>, that Parent may, in its discretion and as a condition precedent to the issuance thereof, require the owner of such lost, stolen or destroyed Certificates to deliver a bond in such sum as it may reasonably direct as
indemnity against any claim that may be made against Guarantor, Parent or the Exchange Agent with respect to the Certificates alleged to have been lost, stolen or destroyed.</P>
<P>SECTION 1.11. <U>Tax Consequences</U>. The parties hereto intend that the Merger shall constitute a reorganization within the meaning of Section 368(a) of the Code. The parties hereto hereby adopt this Agreement as a "plan of reorganization" within
the meaning of Sections 1.368-2(g) and 1.368-3(a) of the United States Treasury Regulations.</P>
<P>SECTION 1.12. <U>Taking of Necessary Action; Further Action</U>. Each of Parent, Merger Sub and the Company will take, and cause their affiliates to take, all such reasonable and lawful actions as may be necessary or appropriate in order to effectuate
the Merger and the other transactions contemplated by this Agreement in accordance with this Agreement as promptly as possible. If, at any time after the Effective Time, any such further action is necessary or desirable to carry out the purposes of this
Agreement and to vest the Surviving Corporation with full right, title and possession to all assets, property, rights, privileges, powers and franchises of the Company and Merger Sub, the officers and directors of the Company and Merger Sub immediately
prior to the Effective Time are fully authorized in the name of their respective corporations or otherwise to take, and will take, all such lawful and necessary action.</P>
<P ALIGN="CENTER">ARTICLE II</P>
<U><P ALIGN="CENTER">REPRESENTATIONS AND WARRANTIES OF THE COMPANY</P>
</U><P>The Company hereby represents and warrants to Parent and Merger Sub as follows:</P>
<P>SECTION 2.01. <U>Organization and Qualification; Subsidiaries</U>. Each of the Company and its subsidiaries is an entity duly organized, validly existing and (to the extent the concept of good standing exists in the applicable jurisdiction) in good
standing under the laws of the jurisdiction of its organization and has the requisite corporate or other power and authority necessary to own, lease and operate the properties it purports to own, operate or lease and to carry on its business as it is now
being conducted, except where the failure to be so organized, existing and in good standing or to have such power or authority would not reasonably be expected to have a Material Adverse Effect. Each of the Company and its subsidiaries is duly qualified
or licensed as a foreign corporation to do business, and is in good standing, in each jurisdiction where the character of its properties owned, leased or operated by it or the nature of its activities makes such qualification or licensing necessary,
except for such failures to be so duly qualified or licensed and in good standing that would not reasonably be expected to have a Material Adverse Effect. A true and complete list of all of the Company's "significant" subsidiaries, as defined in
Regulation S-X (the "<U>Company Significant Subsidiaries</U>"), is included as an exhibit to the Company's 2000 Annual Report on Form 10-K (the "<U>Company 2000 Form 10-K</U>"). A list of all subsidiaries of the Company together with the jurisdiction of organization of each
such subsidiary and the percentage of each such subsidiary's outstanding capital stock owned by the Company or another subsidiary of the Company is contained in Section 2.01 of the written disclosure schedule previously delivered by the Company to the
Parent (the "<U>Company Disclosure Schedule</U>"). Except as set forth in Section 2.01 of the Company Disclosure Schedule or the Company SEC Documents, neither the Company nor any of its subsidiaries directly or indirectly owns any equity or similar interest in, or
any interest convertible into or exchangeable or exercisable for, any equity or similar interest in, any corporation, partnership, joint venture or other business association or entity (other than its wholly-owned subsidiaries), excluding (i) interests in
non-publicly traded entities with respect to which interest the Company or a subsidiary has invested (and currently owns) or is required to invest less than $5,000,000, and (ii) securities in any publicly-traded company held for investment by the Company
and comprising less than five percent of the outstanding stock of such company.</P>
<P>SECTION 2.02. <U>Certificate of Incorporation and By-laws</U>. The Company has heretofore made available to Parent a complete and correct copy of its Restated&nbsp;Certificate of Incorporation and By-laws as amended to date (the "<U>Company Charter
Documents</U>"), and will make available to Parent, as promptly as practicable, the Certificate of Incorporation and By-laws (or equivalent organizational documents) of each of its subsidiaries (the "<U>Subsidiary Documents</U>") reasonably requested by Parent.
All such Company Charter Documents and Subsidiary Documents are in full force and effect, except in the case of Subsidiary Documents where the failure to be in force and effect would not reasonably be expected, individually or in the aggregate, to have a
Material Adverse Effect. Neither the Company nor any of its subsidiaries is in violation of any of the provisions of its Certificate of Incorporation or By-laws or equivalent organizational documents, except for violations of the documents which do not
and are not reasonably likely to materially interfere with the operations of such entity.</P>
<P>SECTION 2.03. <U>Capitalization</U>. (a) The authorized capital stock of the Company consists of 300,000,000 shares of Company Common Stock and 5,000,000 shares of preferred stock, par value $1.00 per share (the "<U>Company Preferred Stock</U>"). As
of April 30, 2001, (i) 50,969,564 shares of Company Common Stock were issued and outstanding, all of which are validly issued, fully paid and nonassessable (excluding treasury shares which are issued but not outstanding, all of which are not entitled to
vote), and none of which has been issued in violation of preemptive or similar rights, (ii) no shares of Company Common Stock were held by subsidiaries of the Company, (iii) 5,441,652 shares of Company Common Stock were reserved for existing grants and
1,346,009 shares of Company Common Stock were reserved for future grants pursuant to the Company Stock Option Plans, and (iv) 352,977 shares of Company Common Stock were reserved and available for future issuance pursuant to the Company Stock Purchase
Plans. There are no outstanding shares of Company Preferred Stock. Except as set forth in Section 2.03 of the Company Disclosure Schedule, no change in such capitalization has occurred since April 30, 2001 except for changes resulting from the exercise or
termination of Stock Options which were outstanding and exercisable as of April 30, 2001 (or were outstanding as of April 30, 2001 and became exercisable in accordance with their terms thereafter), forfeiture of restricted stock or transactions pursuant
to the Company Stock Purchase Plans or transactions permitted by Section 4.01. Except as set forth in Section 2.01, this Section 2.03 or Section 2.11 or in Section 2.03 or Section 2.11 of the Company Disclosure Schedule or the Company SEC Documents and
except for the Rights and this Agreement, there are no options, warrants or other rights, agreements, arrangements or commitments of any character binding on the Company or any of its subsidiaries relating to the issued or unissued capital stock of the
Company or any of its subsidiaries or obligating the Company or any of its subsidiaries to issue or sell any shares of capital stock of, or other equity interests in, the Company or any of its subsidiaries. All shares of Company Common Stock subject to
issuance as aforesaid, upon issuance on the terms and conditions specified in the instruments pursuant to which they are issuable, shall be duly authorized, validly issued, fully-paid and nonassessable and will not be issued in violation of preemptive or
similar rights.</P>
<P>(b) &#9;Except as set forth in Section 2.03 of the Company Disclosure Schedule or the reports, schedules, forms, statements, registration statements, proxy statements and other documents filed by the Company with the Securities and Exchange Commission (

year ended December 31, 1999 incorporated by reference therein (the "<U>Company SEC Documents</U>"), there are no obligations, contingent or otherwise, of the Company or any of its subsidiaries to repurchase, redeem or otherwise acquire any shares of the Company Common Stock or the capital stock of any subsidiary. Except
as set forth in Section 2.03 of the Company Disclosure Schedule or the Company SEC Documents, there are no obligations, contingent or otherwise, of the Company or any of its subsidiaries to provide funds to or make any investment (in the form of a loan,
capital contribution or otherwise) in any such subsidiary or any other entity other than guarantees of bank obligations of subsidiaries and intercompany book entry transactions, in either case entered into in the ordinary course of business. Except as set
forth in Section 2.01 or 2.03 of the Company Disclosure Schedule, (i) all of the outstanding shares of capital stock (other than directors' qualifying shares) of each of the Company's subsidiaries are duly authorized, validly issued, fully-paid and
nonassessable, and (ii) all such shares (other than directors' qualifying shares and a de minimis number of shares owned by employees of such subsidiaries) are owned by the Company or another subsidiary free and clear of all security interests, liens,
claims, pledges, agreements, limitations in the Company's voting rights, charges or other encumbrances of any nature whatsoever.</P>
<P>SECTION 2.04. <U>Authority Relative to This Agreement</U>. (a) The Company has all necessary corporate power and authority to execute and deliver this Agreement and to perform its obligations hereunder and to consummate the transactions contemplated
hereby. The execution and delivery of this Agreement by the Company and the consummation by the Company of the transactions contemplated hereby have been duly and validly authorized by all necessary corporate action, and no other corporate proceedings on
the part of the Company are necessary to authorize this Agreement or to consummate the transactions so contemplated (other than the requisite approval by the Company's shareholders in accordance with NJBCA and the Company Charter Documents and the filings
and recording of appropriate merger documents as required by the NJBCA).</P>
<P>(b)&#9;Assuming the accuracy of the representations and warranties in Section 3.14, the provisions of Article 11 and 12 of the Company's Restated Certificate of Incorporation will not apply to the Merger.</P>
<P>(c)&#9;As of the date hereof, the Board of Directors of the Company has unanimously (i) determined that it is advisable and in the best interest of the Company's shareholders for the Company to enter into this Agreement and to consummate the Merger
upon the terms and subject to the conditions of this Agreement, (ii) approved this Agreement in accordance with the applicable provisions of the NJBCA, and (iii) recommended the approval of this Agreement by holders of the Company Common Stock and
directed that this Agreement be submitted for consideration by the Company's shareholders at a meeting of the shareholders of the Company to consider the Merger Agreement (the "<U>Company Shareholders Meeting</U>"). This Agreement has been duly and validly executed and delivered by the Company and, assuming the due authorization, execution and delivery by Guarantor, Parent and Merger Sub of this Agreement and/or the Guarantee
hereof, as applicable, constitutes a legal, valid and binding obligation of the Company, enforceable against the Company in accordance with its terms.</P>
<P>SECTION 2.05. <U>Material Contracts; No Conflict; Required Filings and Consents</U>. (a) Subject to the following sentence, Section 2.05(a) of the Company Disclosure Schedule includes, as of the date hereof, a list of (i) other than intercompany, all

of such contract, commitment, agreement, or other understanding or arrangement; and (iii)&nbsp;all agreements which are required to be filed as "material contracts" with the SEC pursuant to the requirements of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as
amended, and the SEC's rules and regulations thereunder (the "<U>Exchange Act</U>") but which have not been so filed with the SEC. The Company may omit from Section 2.05 of the Company Disclosure Schedule any contract, agreement, commitment or other understanding or arrangement referred to in clause (i) or (ii) of
the preceding sentence (other than a contract, agreement or other understanding or arrangement for money borrowed) which the Company is in good faith unable to identify because of time constraints or the desire of the Company to limit the number of
persons involved in the matters contemplated by this Agreement; <U>provided</U> that (A) the Company shall include any such contract, agreement, commitment or other understanding or arrangement in a supplement to the Company Disclosure Schedule delivered to the Parent no later than 14 days after the date of this

Company Charter Documents, (ii) assuming compliance with the matters referred to in Section 2.05(c), conflict with or violate the Subsidiary Documents or any law, rule, regulation, order, judgment or decree applicable to the Company or any of its
subsidiaries or by which its or any of their respective properties is bound or affected, or (iii)&nbsp;result in any breach of or constitute a default (or an event that with notice or lapse of time or both would become a default) under, or impair the
Company's or any of its subsidiaries' rights or alter the rights or obligations of any third party under, or give to others any rights of, or cause any, termination, amendment, redemption, acceleration or cancellation of, or result in the creation of a
lien or encumbrance on (including a right to purchase) any of the properties or assets of the Company or any of its subsidiaries pursuant to, any note, bond, mortgage, indenture, credit facility, contract, agreement, lease, license, permit, franchise or
other instrument or obligation to which the Company or any of its subsidiaries is a party or by which the Company or any of its subsidiaries or its or any of their respective properties is bound or affected, except, in the case of clause (ii) or (iii),
for any such conflicts, violations, breaches, defaults or other occurrences that would not reasonably be expected, individually or in the aggregate, to have a Material Adverse Effect.</P>
<P>(c)&#9;The execution and delivery of this Agreement by the Company does not, and the performance of this Agreement by the Company will not, require the Company or any of its subsidiaries to make or seek any consent, approval, authorization or permit
of, or filing with or notification to, any governmental, administrative or regulatory authority, domestic or foreign (each, a "<U>Governmental Authority</U>"), except (i) for applicable requirements, if any, of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, and the rules and regulations of the SEC thereunder (the "<U>Securities Act</U>"), the Exchange Act, state securities laws, the

or notifications, would not prevent or materially delay consummation of the Merger, or otherwise prevent or materially delay the Company from performing its material obligations under this Agreement, or would not otherwise reasonably be expected,
individually or in the aggregate, to have a Material Adverse Effect; or (iii) as to which any necessary consents, approvals, authorizations, permits, filings or notifications have heretofore been obtained or filed, as the case may be, by the Company.</P>

The Company and its subsidiaries are in compliance with the terms of the
Company Permits, except as described in the Company SEC Documents or where the failure to so comply would not reasonably be expected, individually or in the aggregate, to have a Material Adverse Effect.</P>
<P>SECTION 2.07. <U>SEC Filings; Financial Statements</U>. (a)&nbsp; The Company has filed all reports, schedules, forms, statements and other documents (including all exhibits thereto) required to be filed with the SEC since December 31, 1998 (the "<U>

<P>SECTION 4.02. <U>No Solicitation</U>. (a) The Company shall not, directly or indirectly, through any officer, director, employee, representative or agent of the Company or any of its subsidiaries, solicit or encourage the initiation of (including by
way of furnishing information) any inquiries or proposals regarding any merger, sale of assets, sale of shares of capital stock (including, without limitation, by way of a tender offer) or similar transactions involving the Company or any subsidiaries of
the Company that if consummated would constitute an Alternative Transaction (as defined below) (any of the foregoing inquiries or proposals being referred to herein as an "<U>Acquisition Proposal</U>"). Nothing contained in this Agreement shall prevent the Board of Directors of the Company from (i)&nbsp;furnishing information to a third party which has made a <U>bona</U> <U>fide</U> Acquisition Proposal that the Board of
Directors of the Company concludes in good faith after consulting with a nationally recognized investment banking firm would, if consummated, constitute a Superior Proposal (as defined below) not solicited in violation of this Agreement, provided that
such third party has executed an agreement with confidentiality provisions substantially similar to those then in effect between the Company and a subsidiary of Guarantor or (ii) subject to compliance with the other terms of this Section 4.02, including
Sections 4.02(c) and (d), considering and negotiating a bona fide Acquisition Proposal that the Board of Directors of the Company concludes in good faith after consulting with a nationally recognized investment banking firm would, if consummated,
constitute a Superior Proposal not solicited in violation of this Agreement; <U>provided</U>, <U>however</U>, that, as to each of clauses (i) and (ii), (x) such actions occur at a time prior to approval of the Merger and this Agreement at the Company Shareholders Meeting and (y) the Board of Directors of the Company reasonably
determines in good faith (after due consultation with independent counsel, which may be Simpson Thacher &amp; Bartlett) that it is or is reasonably likely to be required to do so in order to discharge properly its fiduciary duties.</P>
<P>For purposes of this Agreement, "<U>Alternative Transaction</U>" means any of (i) a transaction pursuant to which any person (or group of persons) other than Parent or its affiliates (a "<U>Third Party</U>") acquires or would acquire more than 25% of
the outstanding shares of any class of equity securities of the Company, whether from the Company or pursuant to a tender offer or exchange offer or otherwise, (ii) a merger or other business combination involving the Company pursuant to which any Third
Party acquires or would acquire more than 25% of the outstanding equity securities of the Company or the entity surviving such merger or business combination, (iii) any transaction pursuant to which any Third Party acquires or would acquire control of
assets (including for this purpose the outstanding equity securities of subsidiaries of the Company and securities of the entity surviving any merger or business combination including any of the Company's subsidiaries) of the Company, or any of its
subsidiaries having a fair market value (as determined by the Board of Directors of the Company in good faith) equal to more than 25% of the fair market value of all the assets of the Company and its subsidiaries, taken as a whole, immediately prior to
such transaction, or (iv) any other consolidation, business combination, recapitalization or similar transaction involving the Company or any "significant subsidiary" (as defined in Rule 1-02 under Regulation S-X) of the Company, other than the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement; <U>provided</U>, <U>however</U>, that the term Alternative Transaction shall not include any acquisition of securities by a broker dealer in connection with a bona fide public offering of such securities.</P>
<P>For purposes of this Agreement, a "<U>Superior Proposal</U>" means any proposal made by a third party to acquire, directly or indirectly, for consideration consisting of cash and/or securities, all of the Company Common Stock entitled to vote
generally in the election of directors or all or substantially all the assets of the Company, on terms which the Board of Directors of the Company reasonably believes (after consultation with a financial advisor of nationally recognized reputation) to be
more favorable from a financial point of view to its shareholders than the Merger and the transactions contemplated by this Agreement taking into account at the time of determination any changes to the financial terms of this Agreement proposed by Parent; <U>provided</U>, <U>however</U>, that a Superior Proposal may be subject to a due diligence review of confidential information and to other customary conditions.</P>
<P>(b)&#9;The Company shall notify Parent promptly (but in no event later than 24 hours) after receipt of any Acquisition Proposal, or any modification of or amendment to any Acquisition Proposal, or any request for nonpublic information relating to the
Company or any of its subsidiaries in connection with an Acquisition Proposal or for access to the properties, books or records of the Company or any subsidiary by any person or entity that informs the Board of Directors of the Company or such subsidiary
that it is considering making, or has made, an Acquisition Proposal. Such notice to Parent shall be made orally and in writing, and shall indicate the identity of the person making the Acquisition Proposal or intending to make an Acquisition Proposal or
requesting non-public information or access to the books and records of the Company, the terms of any such Acquisition Proposal or modification or amendment to an Acquisition Proposal, and whether the Company is providing or intends to provide the person
making the Acquisition Proposal with access to information concerning the Company as provided in Section 4.02(a). The Company shall keep Parent fully informed, on a current basis, of any material changes in the status and any material changes or
modifications in the material terms of any such Acquisition Proposal, indication or request. The Company shall also promptly notify Parent, orally and in writing, if it enters into negotiations concerning any Acquisition Proposal.</P>
<P>(c)&#9;Except to the extent the Board of Directors of the Company reasonably determines in good faith (after due consultation with independent counsel, which may be Simpson Thacher &amp; Bartlett) that it is or is reasonably likely to be required to
act to the contrary in order to discharge properly its fiduciary duties (and, with respect to the approval, recommendation or entering into any, Acquisition Proposal, it may take such contrary action only after the second full business day (disregarding
any partial business days) following Parent's and Merger Sub's receipt of written notice of the Board of Directors' intention to do so), neither the Company nor the Board of Directors of the Company shall withdraw or modify, or propose to withdraw or
modify, in a manner adverse to Parent or Merger Sub, the approval by such Board of Directors of this Agreement or the Merger.</P>
<P>(d)&#9;The Company and the Board of Directors of the Company shall not (i)&nbsp;redeem the rights (the "<U>Rights</U>") issued under the Rights Agreement, dated as of October 11, 1995, between the Company and First Chicago Trust Company of New York,
as Rights Agent (the "<U>Rights Agreement</U>"), or waive or amend any provision of the Rights Agreement, in any such case to permit or facilitate the consummation of any Acquisition Proposal or Alternative Transaction, or (ii) enter into any agreement (other than a
confidentiality agreement entered into not in violation of Section 4.02(a)) with respect to, or otherwise approve or recommend, or propose to approve or recommend, any Acquisition Proposal or Alternative Transaction, unless this Agreement has been
terminated in accordance with its terms. It is understood and agreed that a deferral of the distribution of Rights following the commencement of a tender offer or exchange offer shall not be prohibited hereunder.</P>
<P>(e) &#9;Nothing contained in this Section 4.02 shall prohibit the Company from taking and disclosing to its shareholders a position required by Rule 14e-2(a) promulgated under the Exchange Act or from making any disclosure to its shareholders required
by applicable law, rule or regulation or by the NYSE.</P>
<P>(f)&#9;The Company shall immediately cease and cause to be terminated any existing discussions or negotiations with any persons (other than Parent and Merger Sub) conducted heretofore with respect to any of the foregoing. The Company agrees not to
release any third party (i) from the confidentiality provisions of, or, (ii) except with respect to a party to whom the Board of Directors is permitted to furnish information or with whom the Board of Directors is permitted to negotiate pursuant to
Section 4.02(a), from the standstill provisions of, any agreement to which the Company is a party.</P>
<P>(g)&#9;The Company shall ensure that the officers and directors of the Company and the Company's subsidiaries and any investment banker or other advisor or representative retained by the Company are aware of the restrictions described in this Section
4.02. It is understood that any violation of the restrictions set forth in this Section 4.02 by any officer or director of the Company or the Company subsidiaries and any investment banker, attorney or other advisor or representative of the Company shall
be deemed to be a breach of this Section 4.02 by the Company. </P>
<P>SECTION 4.03. <U>Conduct of Business by Guarantor Pending the Merger</U>. During the period from the date of this Agreement and continuing until the earlier of the termination of this Agreement or the Effective Time, Parent covenants and agrees that,
except as set forth in Section 4.03 of the Parent Disclosure Schedule or unless the Company shall otherwise agree in writing, Parent shall take all action necessary so that (i) Guarantor shall conduct its business, and cause the businesses of its
subsidiaries to be conducted, in the ordinary course of business and consistent with past practice, including actions taken by Guarantor or its subsidiaries in contemplation of consummation of the Merger or other business acquisitions otherwise in
compliance with this Agreement, and (ii) Guarantor shall not directly or indirectly do, or propose to do, any of the following without the prior written consent of the Company:</P>
<P>(a)&#9;amend or otherwise change the Guarantor Charter Documents;</P>
<P>(b)&#9;acquire or agree to acquire, by merging or consolidating with, by purchasing an equity interest in or a portion of the assets of, or by any other manner, any business or any corporation, partnership, association or other business organization
or division thereof, or otherwise acquire or agree to acquire any assets of any other person, or dispose of any assets, which, in any such case, would materially delay or would reasonably be expected to prevent the consummation of the Merger and the other
transactions contemplated by this Agreement;</P>
<P>(c)&#9;declare, set aside, make or pay any dividend or other distribution (whether in cash, stock or property or any combination thereof) in respect of any of its capital stock, except that a wholly owned subsidiary of Guarantor may declare and pay a
dividend to its parent, and except that Guarantor may declare and pay quarterly cash dividends on the Guarantor Common Shares of up to $0.0125 per share consistent with past practice;</P>
<P>(d)&#9;take any action to change its accounting policies or procedures (including, without limitation, procedures with respect to revenue recognition, payments of accounts payable and collection of accounts receivable), except as required by a change
in GAAP occurring after the date hereof; or</P>
<P>(e)&#9;take or agree in writing or otherwise to take any of the actions described in Sections 4.03(a) through (d) above, or any actions that would make any of the representations or warranties of Parent contained in this Agreement untrue or incorrect
such that the conditions in Section 6.03(a) would not be satisfied or prevent Parent from performing or cause Parent not to perform its covenants hereunder such that the condition in Section 6.03(b) would not be satisfied.</P>

Company shall furnish to Guarantor all information concerning the Company and the holders of capital stock of the Company as may be reasonably requested in connection with any such action and the preparation, filing and distribution of the Proxy

the basis of customary representations, warranties and covenants of Guarantor, Parent and the Company and assumptions set forth in such opinions<A NAME="_Toc485471743">, to the effect that the Merger will be treated for United States federal income tax purposes as a reorganization within the meaning of Section 368(a) of the Code that is not subject to Section 367(a)(1) of the Code (other than
with respect to Company shareholders who are or will be "five-percent transferee shareholders" within the meaning of Treasury Regulation Section 1.367(a)-3(c)(5)(ii)), and that each of Guarantor, Parent and the Company will be a party to the
reorganization within the meaning of Section 368(b) of the Code.</A></P>

Company shall not be obligated to take the action set forth in the preceding sentence of this Section 5.01(c) or to take the actions set forth in Section 5.02 to the extent that the Board of Directors of the Company determines (after due consultation with

persons who are, at the time of the Company Shareholders Meeting, anticipated to be "affiliates" of the Company for purposes of Rule 145 under the Securities Act ("<U>Rule 145</U>"). The Company shall use its reasonable best efforts to cause each person who is identified as an "affiliate" in the Company Affiliate Letter to deliver to Parent prior to the Effective Time a written agreement in connection with
restrictions on affiliates under Rule 145, in a form mutually agreeable to the Company and Parent.</P>
<P>SECTION 5.06. <U>Indemnification and Insurance</U>. (a) The Certificate of Incorporation and By-laws of the Surviving Corporation shall contain the provisions with respect to indemnification set forth in the Company Charter Documents, which provisions

officers, employees or agents of the Company, unless such modification is required after the Effective Time by law and then only to the minimum extent required by such law.</P>
<P>(b)&#9;The Surviving Corporation shall, to the fullest extent permitted under applicable law or under the Surviving Corporation's Certificate of Incorporation or By-laws, indemnify and hold harmless each present and former director, officer or
employee of the Company or any of its subsidiaries (collectively, the "<U>Indemnified Parties</U>") against any costs or expenses (including attorneys' fees), judgments, fines, losses, claims, damages, liabilities and amounts paid in settlement in connection with any claim, action, suit, proceeding or investigation, whether
civil, criminal, administrative or investigative, (x) arising out of or pertaining to the transactions contemplated by this Agreement or (y) otherwise with respect to any acts or omissions occurring at or prior to the Effective Time, to the same extent as
provided in the Company Charter Documents or any applicable contract or agreement as in effect on the date hereof, in each case for a period of six years after the Effective Time. In the event of any such claim, action, suit, proceeding or investigation
(whether arising before or after the Effective Time), (i) any counsel retained by the Indemnified Parties for any period after the Effective Time shall be reasonably satisfactory to the Surviving Corporation, (ii) after the Effective Time, the Surviving
Corporation shall pay the reasonable fees and expenses of such counsel, promptly after statements therefor are received; <U>provided</U> that the Indemnified Parties shall be required to reimburse the Surviving Corporation for such payments in the circumstances and to the extent required by the Company Charter Documents, any applicable contract or agreement or applicable
law and (iii) the Surviving Corporation shall cooperate in the defense of any such matter; <U>provided</U>, <U>however</U>, that the Surviving Corporation shall not be liable for any settlement effected without its written consent (which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld); and <U>provided</U>, <U>further</U>, that, in the event that
any claim or claims for indemnification are asserted or made within such six-year period, all rights to indemnification in respect of any such claim or claims shall continue until the final disposition of any and all such claims. The Indemnified Parties
as a group may retain only one law firm to represent them in each applicable jurisdiction with respect to any single action unless there is, under applicable standards of professional conduct, a conflict on any significant issue between the positions of
any two or more Indemnified Parties, in which case each Indemnified Person with respect to whom such a conflict exists (or group of such Indemnified Persons who among them have no such conflict) may retain one separate law firm in each applicable
jurisdiction.</P>
<P>(c)&#9;The Surviving Corporation shall honor and fulfill in all respects the obligations of the Company pursuant to indemnification agreements and employment agreements (the parties under such agreements being referred to as the "<U>Covered Persons</U>
") with the Company's directors and officers existing at or before the Effective Time, provided such agreements do not violate Section 4.01(f).</P>
<P>(d)&#9;In addition, Parent will provide, or cause the Surviving Corporation to provide, for a period of not less than six years after the Effective Time, the Company's current directors and officers with an insurance and indemnification policy that
provides coverage for events occurring at or prior to the Effective Time (the "<U>D&amp;O Insurance</U>") that is no less favorable than the existing policy or, if substantially equivalent insurance coverage is unavailable, the best available coverage; <U>provided</U>, <U>however</U>, that Parent and the Surviving Corporation shall
not be required to pay an annual premium for the D&amp;O Insurance in excess of 200% of the annual premium currently paid by the Company for such insurance, but in such case shall purchase as much such coverage as possible for such amount.</P>
<P>(e)&#9;From and after the Effective Time, Parent shall unconditionally guarantee the timely payment of all funds owing by, and the timely performance of all other obligations of, the Surviving Corporation under this Section 5.06.</P>

would reasonably be expected to cause any representation or warranty contained in this Agreement to be materially untrue or inaccurate, or (ii) any failure of the Company, Parent or Merger Sub, as the case may be, materially to comply with or satisfy any
covenant, condition or agreement to be complied with or satisfied by it hereunder; <U>provided</U>, <U>however</U>, that the delivery of any notice pursuant to this Section shall not limit or otherwise affect the remedies available hereunder to the party receiving such notice; and <U>provided</U> <U>further</U> that failure to give such
notice shall not be treated as a breach of covenant for the purposes of Sections 6.02(b), 6.03(b) or 7.01(h) unless the failure to give such notice results in material prejudice to the other party.</P>
<P>SECTION 5.08. <U>Further Action/Tax Treatment</U>. (a) Upon the terms and subject to the conditions hereof, each of the parties hereto shall use all reasonable efforts to, and Parent shall cause Guarantor to use all reasonable efforts to, take, or
cause to be taken, all actions and to do, or cause to be done, all other things necessary, proper or advisable to consummate and make effective as promptly as practicable the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, to obtain in a timely manner all
necessary waivers, consents and approvals and to effect all necessary registrations and filings, and otherwise to satisfy or cause to be satisfied all conditions precedent to its obligations under this Agreement. The foregoing covenant (i) shall include
the obligation by the Company to, and (ii) shall include the obligation by Guarantor to, and/or to permit the Company to, agree to divest, abandon, license, hold separate or take similar action with respect to any assets (tangible or intangible) which
are, in the aggregate, not material to Guarantor or the Company, as applicable (but shall not include any obligation by Guarantor to agree to divest, abandon, license, hold separate or take similar action with respect to any assets (tangible or

<P>(b)&#9;Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, each of Parent, Merger Sub and the Company shall, and Parent shall cause Guarantor to, use its reasonable best efforts to cause the Merger to qualify, and will not (both before and after the
Effective Time) take any actions, or fail to take any action, which could reasonably be expected to prevent the Merger from qualifying as a reorganization under the provisions of Section 368(a) of the Code that is not subject to Section 367(a)(1) of the
Code (other than with respect to Company shareholders who are or will be "five-percent transferee shareholders" within the meaning of Treasury Regulation Section 1.367(a)-3(c)(5)(ii)). Parent shall, and shall cause the Surviving Corporation and Guarantor
to, report, to the extent required by the Code or the regulations thereunder, the Merger for income tax purposes as a reorganization within the meaning of Section 368(a) of the Code. Each of Parent and the Company shall make, and shall cause their
affiliates (including Guarantor) to make, such representations, warranties and covenants as shall be requested reasonably in the circumstances by PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP and Simpson Thacher &amp; Bartlett in order for such firms to render their
opinions referred to in Section 5.01(b).</P>
<P>SECTION 5.09. <U>Public Announcements</U>. Parent and the Company shall consult with each other before issuing (and in the case of Parent, before Guarantor issues) any press release or making any written public statement with respect to the Merger or
this Agreement and shall not issue any such press release or make any such public statement without the prior consent of the other party, which shall not be unreasonably withheld; <U>provided</U>, <U>however</U>, that either party may, without the prior consent of the other, issue such press release or make such public statement as may upon the advice of counsel be required by law (including, without limitation, Rules 165 and 425
under the Securities Act and Rule 14a-12 under the Exchange Act) or the rules and regulations of the NYSE if it has used all reasonable efforts to consult with the other party.</P>
<P>SECTION 5.10. <U>Guarantor Common Shares</U>. (a) Parent shall obtain from Guarantor, and shall cause Guarantor to transfer to Parent, the Guarantor Common Shares to be delivered by Parent to the holders of Company Common Stock in the Merger.</P>

award agreement immediately prior to the Effective Time; except that, (i) each Company Stock Option and related stock appreciation right, if any, will be exercisable for that number of whole Guarantor Common Shares equal to the product of the number of
shares of Company Common Stock that were issuable upon exercise of such the Company Stock Option or related stock appreciation right, immediately prior to the Effective Time multiplied by the Exchange Ratio, rounded to the nearest whole number of
Guarantor Common Shares, and (ii) the per share exercise price for the Guarantor Common Shares issuable upon exercise of such Company Stock Option or related stock appreciation right will be equal to the quotient determined by dividing the exercise price
per share of the Company Common Stock at which such Company Stock option was exercisable immediately prior to the Effective Time by the Exchange Ratio, rounded to the nearest whole cent (each such Company Stock Option, as modified, an "<U>Adjusted Option</U>"); <U>provided</U>, <U>however</U>, that to the extent that any Company Stock Option qualified as an incentive stock option pursuant to section 422 of the Code immediately prior to the Effective Time, the provisions of this Section
5.11 shall be applied in good faith to comply with sections 422 and 424(a) of the Code.</P>
<P>(b)&#9;Parent will cause Guarantor to take all corporate action necessary to reserve for issuance as of or as soon as administratively practicable after the Effective Time a sufficient number of Guarantor Common Shares for delivery upon exercise of
the Adjusted Options and to deliver to holders of Adjusted Options upon the exercise of such options Guarantor Common Shares registered pursuant to the Securities Act and listed on the NYSE.</P>

in either case, implement any decisions to do the same, whether or not such decisions have been communicated to employees. The Company shall take such action as is necessary to cause the ending date of the then current offering period under the Company
Stock Purchase Plans to be prior to the Effective Time and to terminate such plans as of the Effective Time. All shares of Company Common Stock and other awards under the Company Stock Purchase Plans shall become fully vested and be issued to participants
in a manner such that the shares will be treated as all other shares of Company Common Stock. Parent shall, to the extent legally and administratively feasible, enable employees of the Company and its subsidiaries to participate in Guarantor's employee
stock purchase plan, in a manner consistent with the current practice of Parent's affiliates.</P>

other shares of Company Common Stock.</P>

<P>(c)&#9;With respect to the benefits provided pursuant to this Section 5.12, (i) service accrued by Company Employees during employment with the Company and its subsidiaries (including any predecessor entity) prior to the Effective Time shall be
recognized for all purposes except for benefit accruals with respect to defined benefit pension plans, (ii) any and all pre-existing condition limitations (to the extent such limitations did not apply to a pre-existing condition under the applicable
Company Employee Plan) and eligibility waiting periods under any group health plan shall be waived with respect to such Company Employees and their eligible dependents, and (iii) Company Employees shall be given credit for amounts paid under a Company
Employee Plan during the applicable period for purposes of applying deductibles, co-payments and out-of-pocket maximums as though such amounts had been paid in accordance with the terms and conditions of the employee welfare plans in which any Company
Employee becomes entitled to participate.</P>
<P>(d)&#9;It is expressly agreed that (i) the provisions of Section 5.12 are not intended to be for the benefit of or otherwise enforceable by any third party, including, without limitation, any Company Employees and (ii) except as provided in Section
5.12(a) and except as required by law, nothing herein shall prevent the Surviving Corporation or any other subsidiary of Guarantor from amending or modifying any employee benefit plan, program or arrangement in any respect or terminating or modifying the
terms and conditions of employment or other service of any particular employee or any other person.</P>
<P>(e)&#9;The Company shall amend its 401(k) savings plan and any other Company Employee Plan which permits participants to elect to invest in stock of the Company, where necessary, to preclude any additional purchases of stock of the Company, as of the
date two (2) days prior to the Effective Time, and the Company shall communicate this amendment to the participants in such plans.</P>
<P>(f)&#9;Any Company Employee Plan that provides for benefits that are measured by the value of the Company's stock but do not entail the granting of Company stock, except as set forth on Section 5.12(f) of the Company Disclosure Schedule, shall be
amended as of the Effective Time to provide a different measure of such benefits thereunder providing substantially similar opportunity for appreciation.</P>
<P>(g)&#9;Prior to the Effective Time, the Company shall terminate any Company Employee Plan that provides for a group relocation (excluding the Company's relocation policy for individual employees) and group severance program (excluding the severance
plans and policies in Section 5.12(a) of the Company Disclosure Schedule), including, without limitation, the S.O.A.R., Nordstrom (U.S. Distribution I, II, III) and Manufacturing I, II, III plans.</P>
<P>(h)&#9;The Company shall cause the Company's rabbi trust to be fully funded with respect to all accrued benefits (excluding gross-up liability for excise taxes) under the plans and agreements listed on Exhibit A to such rabbi trust.</P>
<P>(i)&#9;As of the Effective Time, the Company's Deferred Compensation Contracts with individuals shall be fully funded through the Company's rabbi trust, and such Contracts shall be terminated, and the accrued benefits thereunder shall be paid to
participants at the Effective Time or as soon as practicable thereafter.</P>
<P>(j)&#9;The Company's Stock Equivalent Plan for Outside Directors shall be terminated as of the Effective Time and all accrued benefits thereunder shall be paid in accordance with the terms of such plan.</P>
<P>(k) &#9;Within 90 days after the Effective Time, Guarantor will grant stock options to purchase Guarantor Common Shares to employees of the Company and its subsidiaries. Such options shall be granted pursuant to Guarantor's stock option plans and
shall be made in the same amounts and subject to the same terms as Guarantor grants to similarly situated employees of Guarantor in the ordinary course of Guarantor's business.</P>
<P>(l)&#9;The Company shall (i) amend its annual bonus and executive bonus plans to provide that, effective as of the date of this Agreement, no employee of the Company or any subsidiary of the Company may make an election to defer receipt of his or her
bonus, (ii) terminate such plans as of the Effective Time and (iii) immediately prior to the Effective Time, pay to participants in such plans 125% percent of their earned bonuses in respect of 2001 (based on actual performance and targets through the
last day of the month ending immediately prior to the Effective Time), prorated for the period from January 1, 2001 through the Effective Time; provided that employees of the Company or any subsidiary of the Company who have "change of control" agreements
with the Company will not be grossed-up for excise taxes, if any, related to the 25% additional bonus (i.e., in excess of 100% prorated).</P>
<P>SECTION 5.13. <U>Rights Agreement.</U> Prior to the Company Shareholders Meeting, the Board of Directors of the Company shall take all action necessary in order to render the Rights inapplicable to the Merger and the other transactions contemplated by
this Agreement, by redemption or otherwise.</P>

transfer, value added, stock transfer and stamp taxes, any transfer, recording, registration and other fees, and any similar taxes which become payable in connection with the transactions contemplated hereby that are required or permitted to be filed on

for the payment of such taxes and fees.</P>

<P>SECTION 5.16. <U>Compliance with State Property Transfer Statutes</U>. The Company agrees that it shall use its reasonable commercial efforts to comply promptly with all requirements of applicable state property transfer laws as may be required by the
relevant state agency and shall take all action necessary to cause the transactions contemplated hereby to be effected in compliance with applicable state property transfer laws. The Company, after consultation with Parent, shall determine which actions
must be taken prior to or after the Effective Time to comply with applicable state property transfer laws, except where the failure to so comply will not materially affect the right to use or enjoy any applicable property after the Effective Time. The
Company agrees to provide Parent with any documents required to be submitted to the relevant state agency prior to submission. Parent shall provide, and shall cause Guarantor to provide, to the Company any assistance reasonably requested by the Company
with respect to such compliance.</P>

<P>(iii)&#9;the termination of this Agreement by the Company pursuant to Section 7.01(i).</P>
<P>The "<U>Alternative Transaction Condition</U>" shall be satisfied in respect of a termination of this Agreement if an Alternative Transaction shall be publicly announced by the Company or any third party during the period beginning on the date of this
Agreement and ending 12 months following the date of termination of this Agreement and such transaction shall at any time thereafter be consummated on terms substantially equivalent to or more favorable to the Company or its shareholders than the terms
theretofore announced, and in the case of Section 7.03(b)(i), such transaction provides for a per Share consideration with a fair market value greater than $60.00; <U>provided</U> that for purposes of this definition, the definition of Alternative Transaction set forth in Section 4.02(a) shall be modified to replace "25%," as it appears in such definition, with "40%".</P>
<P>(c)&#9;Upon a termination of this Agreement by Parent pursuant to Section 7.01(h), the Company shall pay to Guarantor and Parent their respective Expenses relating to the transactions contemplated by this Agreement in a combined amount not to exceed

<P>(e)&#9;The Fee and/or Expenses payable pursuant to this Section 7.03 shall be paid within one business day after a demand for payment following the first to occur of any of the events described in the aforesaid Sections, as applicable; <U>provided</U>
that in no event shall the Company be required to pay the Fee or any Expenses to Parent, nor shall Parent be required to pay any Expenses to the Company if, immediately prior to the termination of this Agreement, the entity otherwise entitled to receive
such fee and/or expenses was in material breach of its obligations under this Agreement or, in the case of Parent, Merger Sub was in material breach of its obligations under this Agreement or Guarantor was in material breach of the Guarantee.</P>
<P>(f)&#9;Each of the Company, Parent and Merger Sub agrees that the payments provided for in this Section 7.03 shall be the sole and exclusive remedy of Parent and Merger Sub upon a termination of this Agreement by Parent pursuant to Section 7.01(d),
(e), (f), (h) or (i), and the payments provided for in this Section 7.03 shall be the sole and exclusive remedy of the Company upon a termination of this Agreement by the Company pursuant to Section 7.01(f) or (h), regardless of the circumstances giving
rise to such termination; <U>provided</U>, <U>however</U>, that the foregoing shall not apply to any willful breach of this Agreement or any willful misrepresentation hereunder giving rise to such termination. Subject to Section 7.03(e), if a party is entitled to terminate this
Agreement pursuant to more than one clause of Section 7.01, such party shall be entitled to receive the Fees and Expenses to which it is entitled as a result of any such termination, provided that in no event shall there be any duplication of payment.</P>

cumulative to, and not exclusive of, any rights or remedies otherwise available.</P>

representation or warranty is made to the knowledge of Parent or Merger Sub, such representation or warranty shall be deemed made to the knowledge of Guarantor), and the full and timely performance of their respective obligations under the provisions of
the foregoing Agreement. This is a guarantee of payment and performance, and not of collection, and Guarantor acknowledges and agrees that this guarantee is full and unconditional, and no release or extinguishment of Parent's and Merger Sub's obligations
or liabilities (other than in accordance with the terms of the Agreement), whether by decree in any bankruptcy proceeding or otherwise, shall affect the continuing validity and enforceability of this guarantee, as well as any provision requiring or
contemplating performance by Guarantor.</P>
<P>Guarantor hereby waives, for the benefit of the Company, (i) any right to require the Company as a condition of payment or performance by Guarantor, to proceed against Parent or Merger Sub or pursue any other remedy whatsoever and (ii) to the fullest
extent permitted by law, any defenses or benefits that may be derived from or afforded by law which limit the liability of or exonerate guarantors or sureties, except to the extent that any such defense is available to Parent or Merger Sub.</P>
<P>Without limiting in any way the foregoing guarantee, Guarantor covenants and agrees to take all actions to enable Parent and Merger Sub to adhere to the provisions of Sections 1.06, 1.07, 1.12, 4.03, 5.01, 5.03, 5.04, 5.08, 5.10, 5.14, 5.15 and 5.16
and each other provision of the Agreement which requires an act or omission on the part of Guarantor or any of its subsidiaries to enable Parent or Merger Sub to comply with its obligations under the Agreement.</P>
<P>The provisions of <U>Article VIII</U> of the Agreement are incorporated herein, <I>mutatis mutandis</I>, except that notices and other communications hereunder to Guarantor shall be delivered to Tyco International Ltd., The Zurich Centre, Second
