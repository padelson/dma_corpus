hereof, be amended to read in its entirety as the certificate of
incorporation of Merger Sub read immediately prior to the Effective Time,
except that the name of the Surviving Corporation shall be TravelCenters of
America, Inc. and the provision in the certificate of incorporation of Merger
Sub naming its incorporator shall be omitted.

  

(b) At the Effective Time, the by-laws of the Surviving Corporation shall,
subject to the requirements of Section 6.07(b) hereof, be amended so as to

prior to the Effective Time, until thereafter amended in accordance with
applicable Law, except the references to Merger Subs name shall be replaced

to be the directors of the Surviving Corporation, each to hold office in
accordance with the certificate of incorporation and by-laws of the Surviving
Corporation and applicable Law. The officers of the Company immediately
prior to the Effective Time shall be the initial officers of the
Surviving Corporation, each to hold office until the earlier of their
resignation or removal.

  

 **Section 2.05. _Effect of Merger on Capital Stock of Constituent
Corporations_.**

  

At the Effective Time, by virtue of the Merger and without any action on the
part of the holders of any class of capital stock of the Constituent
Corporations, the following shall occur:

  

(a) _Conversion of Company Stock_. Each share of Company Stock issued and
outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time (other than (x) shares to
be canceled pursuant to Section 2.05(c) and (y) Dissenting Shares) shall, at
the Effective Time, by virtue of the Merger and without any action on the
part of the holder thereof, be converted into the right to receive cash from
Parent in an amount equal to the Per Share Merger Consideration payable to

     

   

the holder thereof, without interest thereon, upon the surrender of
the certificate previously representing such share of Company Common Stock.

  

(b) _Shares of Merger Sub_. Each share of the common stock, $0.01 par value
per share, of Merger Sub, issued and outstanding immediately prior to the
Effective Time, shall, at the Effective Time, by virtue of the Merger and
without any action on the part of Merger Sub or any other Person, be
converted into one fully paid and nonassessable share of common stock, $0.01
par value per share, of the Surviving Corporation.

  

(c) _Treasury Shares of Company; Parent Owned Shares_.  All shares of
Company Stock held in the treasury of the Company and each share of Company
Stock owned or otherwise held by Parent, Merger Sub or any direct or indirect
wholly-owned subsidiary of Parent or the Company immediately prior to the
Effective Time shall be canceled and retired without any conversion thereof
and no payment or distribution shall be made with respect thereto.

  

(d) _Shares of Dissenting Stockholders_.

  

(i) Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the contrary, any shares of
Company Stock that are issued and outstanding as of the Effective Time and
that are held by a holder who has properly exercised such holders appraisal
rights (the " _Dissenting Shares_ ") under the DGCL shall not be converted
into the right to receive the consideration provided for in this Section
2.05, unless and until such holder shall have failed to perfect, or shall
have effectively withdrawn or lost, his or her right to dissent from the
Merger under the DGCL and to receive such consideration as may be determined
to be due with respect to such Dissenting Shares pursuant to and subject to
the requirements of the DGCL. If any such holder shall have so failed
to perfect or have effectively withdrawn or lost such right, each share of
such holders Company Stock shall thereupon be deemed to have been converted
into and to have become, as of the Effective Time, the right to receive,
without any interest thereon, the consideration provided for in this Section
2.05.

  

(ii) The Company shall give Parent prompt notice of any notice or demands for
appraisal or payment for shares of Company Stock received by the Company. The
Company shall not, without the prior written consent of Parent (not to be
unreasonably withheld), make any payment with respect to, or settle, offer to
settle or otherwise negotiate, with respect to any such demands.

  

(iii) Dissenting Shares, if any, after payments of fair value in respect
thereto have been made to the holders thereof pursuant to the DGCL, shall be
canceled.

  

(e) _Stock Transfer Books_. At the Effective Time, the stock transfer books
of the Company shall be closed and there shall be no further registration of
transfers of shares of Company Stock on the records of the Company. If, after
the Effective Time, certificates previously representing shares of Company
Stock are presented to the Surviving Corporation, they shall be canceled
and exchanged for cash pursuant to the provisions of this Section 2.05.

     

   

(f) _Cancellation and Retirement of Shares of Company Stock_.  At and after
the Effective Time, holders of certificates which immediately prior to the
Effective Time represented outstanding shares of Company Stock shall cease to
have any rights as stockholders of the Company, except the right to receive
the cash into which their shares of Company Stock have been converted by the
Merger as provided in Section 2.05(a).

  

 **Section 2.06. _Effect of Merger on Company Stock Options and Company
Warrants_.**

  

(a) At the Effective Time, each stock option granted under the 2001 Stock
Incentive Plan of TravelCenters of America, Inc. (the " _2001 Stock Option
Plan_ ") that is outstanding and unexercised at the Effective Time (a "
_Company Stock Option_ ") shall be cancelled at the Effective Time. In
exchange for such cancellation, the holder of such Company Stock Option shall
receive the right to payment from Parent immediately following the Effective
Time (subject to any applicable withholding taxes), in respect of the portion
of the Company Stock Option that is exercisable at the Effective Time by its
terms (prior to giving effect to such cancellation), of an amount in cash
equal to (1) the total number of shares of Company Common Stock subject to
such exercisable portion of such Company Stock Option held by such holder,
_multiplied by_  (2) the excess, if any, of the Per Share Merger
Consideration (calculated based on the Estimated Merger Consideration,
subject to subsequent adjustment pursuant to Section 3.02) over the exercise
price per share of the Company Stock set forth in such Company Stock Option
subject to such exercisable portion of such Company Stock Option held by such
holder (such exercise price, the " _Company Stock Option Exercise Price_ ").

  

(b) As soon as practicable following the date of this Agreement, the Company
shall use commercially reasonable efforts to take such actions and obtain
such consents as are necessary under the Warrant Agreement to amend the
Warrant Agreement in order to provide that each Company Warrant that is
outstanding and unexercised at the Effective Time shall be cancelled at the
Effective Time. In exchange for such cancellation, the holders of the Company
Warrants shall receive the right to payment from Parent immediately following
the Effective Time (subject to any applicable withholding taxes), of an
amount in cash equal to (1) the total number of shares of Company Common
Stock for which such Company Warrant was exercisable for immediately prior to
cancellation, _multiplied by_ (2) the excess of the Per Share Merger
Consideration (calculated based on the Estimated Merger Consideration,
subject to subsequent adjustment pursuant to Section 3.02) over the exercise
price per share of the Company Common Stock set forth in such Company Warrant
(such exercise price, the " _Company Warrant Exercise Price_ ").  If the
Warrant Agreement is not so amended, immediately following the Effective
Time, Parent shall deposit with the Warrant Agent (as defined in the Warrant
Agreement) an amount equal to the excess of the Per Share
Merger Consideration (calculated based on the Estimated Merger
Consideration, subject to subsequent adjustment pursuant to Section 3.02)
multiplied by the total number of shares of Company Common Stock for which
all Company Warrants were exercisable for immediately prior to the Effective
Time over the aggregate sum of the Company Warrant Exercise Price for all
Company Warrants outstanding and unexercised immediately prior to
the Effective Time.

     

   

 **Section 2.07. _Withholding_.**

  

Each of Parent and the Surviving Corporation shall be entitled to deduct and
withhold from the consideration otherwise payable to any Person under this

Agreements (the " _Closing Transaction Bonus Payout Amount_ ");

     

   

(x) _minus_  the amount of any Company Closing Costs to the extent payable by
the Company or a Company Subsidiary after the close of business on the day
immediately preceding the Closing Date; and

  

(xi) _plus_  an amount equal to the Interest Factor.

  

The " _Per Share Merger Consideration_ " shall be (A) the Merger
Consideration _divided by_ (B) the aggregate number of shares of Company
Stock outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time (calculated on a
Fully Diluted Basis). The " _Estimated Merger Consideration_ " and the "
_Estimated Per Share Merger Consideration_ " shall mean the Merger
Consideration and the Per Share Merger Consideration (in each case,
calculated without giving effect to Section 3.01(viii)) as estimated in good
faith by the Company no more than three (3) days prior to the Closing. Copies
of such estimates (and the Companys calculation thereof) shall be provided
to Parent and Merger Sub prior to the Closing Date.

  

 **Section 3.02. ** _Post-Closing Adjustment of Merger Consideration_.

  

(a) _Estimated Net Working Capital_. The Company shall, concurrently with
the delivery to Parent and Merger Sub of its calculations of the Estimated
Merger Consideration and Estimated Per Share Merger Consideration, cause to
be prepared and delivered to Parent and Merger Sub a statement setting forth
the estimated calculation of the Net Working Capital (as defined below) (the
" _Estimated Net Working Capital_ ") as of the close of business on the day
immediately preceding the Closing Date. " _Net Working Capital_ " shall mean
the current assets less the current liabilities of the Company and the
Company Subsidiaries, all as determined in accordance with GAAP applied in a
manner consistent with the Company Balance Sheet; _provided_ that, in
determining Net Working Capital, the following shall be excluded: (i) the
current portion of any Indebtedness; (ii) Company Closing Costs to the extent
a deduct in calculating the Merger Consideration pursuant to Section 3.01(x)
and (iii) the Closing Transaction Bonus Payout Amount.  

  

(b) _Actual Balance Sheet and Working Capital Statement_. Within forty-five
(45) days following the Closing Date, Parent shall deliver to the
Stockholders Representative and the Escrow Agent a consolidated balance sheet
of the Company and the Company Subsidiaries as of the close of business on
the day immediately preceding the Closing Date prepared in accordance with
GAAP applied on a basis consistent with the Company Balance Sheet and shall
reflect a pro rata portion of all known adjustments which would be required
in a year-end closing of the books of the Company and the Company
Subsidiaries but shall not give effect to any changes in accruals (including
tax accruals with respect to the exercise or cancellation of Company Stock
Options between January 1, 2006 and the Effective Time) for any
items resulting from the transactions contemplated hereby (the " _Actual
Balance Sheet_ "). The Actual Balance Sheet shall be accompanied by a
statement, certified by the Chief Financial Officer of the Surviving
Corporation (the " _Working Capital Statement_ "), that sets forth in
reasonable detail the Actual Net Working Capital, the Working Capital
Adjustment Amount, and the final calculation of the Merger Consideration. The
" _Actual Net Working Capital_ " shall mean the Net Working Capital of the
Company and the Company Subsidiaries as of the close of business on the day
immediately preceding the Closing Date. The " _Working Capital Adjustment
Amount_ " shall mean the difference between the Estimated Net Working Capital
and the Actual Net

     

   

Working Capital. The Surviving Corporation shall give the Stockholders
Representative reasonable access to its books, records, work papers
(including, to the extent applicable, accountants work papers, subject to
such confidentiality restrictions as the Surviving Corporations accountants
shall reasonably request) and employees in connection with the review by the
Stockholders Representative of the Actual Balance Sheet and the Working
Capital Statement. In the course of preparing the Actual Balance Sheet and
the Working Capital Statement, Parent may consult with the Stockholders
Representative in order to resolve any issues that otherwise might become the
subject of a dispute under Section 3.02(c).

  

(c) _Dispute Resolution_. The Stockholders Representative may dispute the
calculation of the Actual Net Working Capital, the Working Capital Adjustment
Amount or the calculation of the Merger Consideration set forth in the
Working Capital Statement by delivering a written notice (a " _Notice of
Disagreement_ ") to Parent, the Surviving Corporation and the Escrow Agent
within thirty (30) days following the delivery of the Working Capital
Statement to the Stockholders Representative. Any Notice of Disagreement
delivered pursuant to this Section 3.02(c) shall specify in reasonable detail
the nature and dollar amount of any disagreement so asserted. If the
Stockholders Representative fails to deliver a timely Notice of Disagreement,
Parents calculation of the Actual Net Working Capital, the Working Capital
Adjustment Amount or the calculation of the Merger Consideration (as set
forth in the Working Capital Statement) shall be deemed the final Actual Net
Working Capital, the Working Capital Adjustment Amount and/or Merger
Consideration, as applicable. During the thirty (30) days following the
delivery of a Notice of Disagreement, Parent and the Stockholders
Representative shall seek in good faith to resolve in writing any differences
which they may have with respect to the matters specified in the Notice of
Disagreement and such final resolution shall be the final Merger
Consideration. If at the end of such 30-day period, the parties are unable to
resolve such dispute, the parties shall submit the dispute to Deloitte and
Touche LLP (" _D andT_") or, if DandT is unavailable, another mutually
satisfactory (to Parent and the Stockholders Representative) independent
"big-four" accounting firm (the " _Accounting Firm_ ") for its review and
resolution of all matters (but only such matters) which remain in dispute and
which were properly included in the Notice of Disagreement, and the
Accounting Firm shall make final determinations of the Actual Net Working
Capital, the Working Capital Adjustment Amount and/or the Merger
Consideration in accordance with the guidelines and procedures set forth in
this Agreement. If the parties are unable to mutually agree on the selection
of the Accounting Firm, the "big-four" accounting firm that is not DandT or the
independent public accountants of the Company and Parent shall serve as the
Accounting Firm. The parties will cooperate with the Accounting Firm during
the term of its engagement. In resolving any matters in dispute with respect
to any assets or liabilities as to which both the Stockholders Representative
and Parent have assigned values, the Accounting Firm may not assign a value
to any item in dispute greater than the greatest value for such item assigned
by the Stockholders Representative, on the one hand, or by Parent, on the
other hand, or less than the smallest value for such item assigned by the
Stockholders Representative, on the one hand, or by Parent, on the other
hand. The Accounting Firms determination will be based solely on
presentations (including work papers) by the Stockholders Representative and
Parent or by their respective representatives which are in accordance with
the guidelines and procedures set forth in this Agreement ( _i.e._ , not on
the basis of an independent review). The determination of the Actual Net
Working Capital, Working Capital Adjustment Amount and the Merger
Consideration shall become final and binding on the parties and
such determination of the Merger Consideration shall be deemed the final
Merger Consideration on

     

   

the date the Accounting Firm delivers to the Stockholders Representative,
Parent and the Surviving Corporation its final resolution in writing (such
resolution, the " _Final Statement_ ") (and the parties will direct the
Accounting Firm to complete its determination and deliver the Final Statement
within thirty (30) days following the submission of the disputed matters to
it).  The fees and expenses of the Accounting Firm shall be paid by (i)
Parent if the final calculation of the Merger Consideration, as set forth in
the Final Statement, is greater than the amount of the Merger Consideration
as set forth in the Working Capital Statement and (ii) the holders of shares
of Company Stock, Company Stock Options and the Company Warrants
(collectively, the " _Company Securities_ ") (but only such holders of
Company Stock Options all or a portion of which are exercisable at the
Effective Time by their terms) on a pro rata basis based upon their
respective percentages of the Merger Consideration, if the final calculation
of the Merger Consideration, as set forth in the Final Statement, is less
than or equal to the amount of the Merger Consideration as set forth in the
Working Capital Statement.  To the extent such fees and expenses of the
Accounting Firm are payable by the holders of the Company Securities, such
fees and expenses shall be paid using the funds deposited into the Escrow
Fund to the extent such holders are entitled to such funds.

  

(d) _Payment of Adjustment to Merger Consideration_.

  

(i) _Excess Payment_. If the Estimated Merger Consideration is _greater than_
the Merger Consideration as finally determined pursuant to this Section 3.02
(such difference, an " _Excess Payment_ "), then an aggregate amount equal to
such Excess Payment shall be distributed to Parent from the Escrow Fund
(after deducting any applicable fees and expenses of the Accounting Firm
payable by Parent (if any) in accordance with Section 3.02(c)). Any remaining
funds in the Escrow Fund (after deducting any applicable fees and expenses of
the Accounting Firm payable by the holders of the Company Securities (if any)
in accordance with Section 3.02(c)) shall be distributed to the holders of
the Company Securities eligible to receive such distributions from the Escrow
Fund as determined based on the final Per Share Merger Consideration (such
holders collectively, the " _Recipients_ ") pursuant to the Escrow Agreement.
If the Excess Payment exceeds the aggregate amount of the Escrow Fund, then
each Recipient entitled to receive distributions from the Escrow Fund shall,
on demand, pay to Parent a pro rata amount of such excess based upon
their respective rights to receive the Merger Consideration.

  

(ii) _Payment Shortfall_. If the Estimated Merger Consideration is
_less than_ the final Merger Consideration (such difference, a "
_Payment Shortfall_ "), then (A) Parent shall pay to the holders of Company
Securities an aggregate amount (after deducting any applicable fees and
expenses of the Accounting Firm payable by the holders of the Company
Securities (if any) in accordance with Section 3.02(c)) equal to the Payment
Shortfall, to be distributed based on their respective rights to receive the
Merger Consideration and (B) each Recipient, as appropriate and depending
upon such Recipients interest in and to the Escrow Fund, shall receive from
such fund such Recipients relative interest in the Escrow Fund pursuant to
the Escrow Agreement.

  

(iii) _Distributions_. The parties hereto agree that any and
all distributions which are required to be made from the Escrow Fund under
this Section 3.02 shall be made in accordance with the Escrow Agreement.

 **Section 3.03. ** _Escrow Agreement and Escrow Fund_.

  

At or prior to the Closing, Parent, the Company, the Stockholders
Representative and The Bank of New York (the " _Escrow Agent_ ") shall enter
into an Escrow Agreement on mutually agreeable terms consistent with the
terms of this Agreement or as may be acceptable to the parties thereto (the "
_Escrow Agreement_ "). The Escrow Agreement shall provide for the creation of
an escrow fund (the " _Escrow Fund_ ") consisting of Ten Million Dollars
($10,000,000) of the Merger Consideration (the " _Escrow Amount_ ") to be
applied to any downward adjustment of the Merger Consideration pursuant to
Section 3.02.  The Escrow Agreement shall contain provisions with respect to
the timing and procedure of distributions of funds from the Escrow Fund
consistent with the terms hereof.

  

 **Section 3.04. ** _Exchange of Certificates Representing Company
Securities_.

  

(a) _Exchange Agent_. __ Immediately following the Effective Time (but in
any event on the Closing Date), Parent shall deposit with an exchange
agent selected by the Parent and reasonably acceptable to the Company (the "
_Exchange Agent_ "), for the benefit of the holders of Company Securities
(other than the Company Warrants if they have not been amended), for exchange
in accordance with this Agreement, an amount equal to (i) the Estimated
Merger Consideration _minus_ (ii) the Escrow Amount, _minus_ (iii)
the product of (A) the Per Share Merger Consideration (calculated based on
the Estimated Merger Consideration) and (B) the total number of Dissenting
Shares, and, if the Company Warrants have not been amended, _minus_ (iv) an
amount equal to the excess, if any, of the Per Share Merger Consideration
(calculated based on the Estimated Merger Consideration) _multiplied by_ the
total number of shares of Company Common Stock for which all Company Warrants
were exercisable for immediately prior to the Effective Time over the
aggregate sum of the Company Warrant Exercise Price for all Company Warrants
outstanding and unexercised immediately prior to the Effective Time (the "
_Exchange Fund_ ") (it being understood that any adjustment to the Estimated
Merger Consideration pursuant to Section 3.02 shall be paid in accordance
with such section). Immediately following the Effective Time (but in any
event on the Closing Date), Parent shall deposit the Escrow Amount with the
Escrow Agent, which shall be held and disbursed by the Escrow Agent
in accordance with the Escrow Agreement.  Promptly after the Effective Time,
the Exchange Agent shall mail to each record holder of an outstanding
certificate, certificates or instruments as of the Effective Time (other than
instruments representing Company Warrants, if they have not been amended)
which immediately prior to the Effective Time represented Company Securities
(the " _Certificates_ "), a letter of transmittal and instructions for use in
effecting the surrender of the Certificates for payment therefor
(collectively, the " _Letter of Transmittal_ "), which Letter of Transmittal
shall include (i) representations of the holder for the benefit of the
Surviving Corporation regarding title to the Company Securities, due
authorization to sell or transfer the Company Securities pursuant to the
terms of this Agreement, and the absence of any conflicts or breaches by such
holder in connection therewith, (ii) an agreement for the benefit of Parent
that such holder shall pay to Parent, to the extent applicable, such
stockholders pro rata portion of the amounts required to be paid pursuant to
Section 3.02(d)(i) plus any cost of collection thereof, (iii) such
information as the Stockholders Representative may reasonably request be
included therein, including an agreement for the benefit of the Stockholders
Representative that such holder agrees to Oak Hills designation as the
Stockholders Representative and that Oak Hill shall have the full and
exclusive authority to, in its capacity as the Stockholders Representative,

     

   

execute any and all instruments or other documents on behalf of such holder,
and do any and all other acts or things on behalf of such holder, which the
Stockholders Representative may deem necessary or advisable, or which may be
required pursuant to this Agreement or otherwise, in connection with the
consummation of the Merger and the other transactions contemplated hereby,
including (w) agreeing with Parent or Merger Sub with respect to any matter
or thing required or deemed necessary by the Stockholders Representative in
connection with the provisions of this Agreement calling for the agreement of
the holder and giving and receiving notices on behalf of the holder, all in
the absolute discretion of the Stockholders Representative, (x) in general,
doing all things and performing all acts, including executing and delivering
all agreements, certificates, receipts, consents, elections, instructions,
and other instruments or documents contemplated by, or deemed by the
Stockholders Representative to be necessary or advisable in connection with,
this Agreement, (y) executing and delivering the Escrow Agreement, and (z)
negotiating, settling, compromising and otherwise handling the post-closing
adjustment of the Merger Consideration pursuant to Section 3.02, and (iv)
such other documents as may reasonably be required in connection with
such surrender, in customary form to be agreed upon by the Company and
Parent prior thereto, including a certificate of each holder of Company
Stock conforming to the requirements of Treasury Regulation Section
1.1445-2(b)(2) certifying that such holder is not a "foreign person" for
purposes of Section 1445 of the Code (a " _FIRPTA Certificate_ ") or, for
those holders of Company Stock who are "foreign persons" for purposes of
Section 1445 of the Code, a statement to that effect.

  

(b) _Exchange Procedures_.

  

(i) After the Effective Time, each holder of Certificate(s) shall, upon
surrender to the Exchange Agent of such Certificate(s) and a fully and
properly completed Letter of Transmittal and acceptance thereof by the
Exchange Agent, be entitled to receive the amount of the Merger Consideration
into which such surrendered Certificate(s) have been converted or exchanged
pursuant to this Agreement.

  

(ii) After the Effective Time, there shall be no further transfer on the
records of the Company or its transfer agent of Certificates, and if
Certificates are presented to the Company for transfer, they shall be
canceled against delivery of the Merger Consideration into which such
Certificates have been converted or exchanged pursuant to this Agreement.
If any Merger Consideration is to be paid to a Person other than the Person
in whose name the surrendered Certificate is registered, it shall be a
condition of such exchange that the Certificate so surrendered shall properly
be endorsed, with signature guaranteed, or otherwise in proper form for
transfer and that the Person requesting such exchange shall pay to the
Surviving Corporation or its transfer agent any transfer or other taxes
required, or establish to the satisfaction of the Surviving Corporation or
its transfer agent that such taxes have been paid or are not applicable.

  

(iii) Until surrendered as contemplated by this Section 3.04(b), each
Certificate (for the purposes of clarification, excluding certificates
relating to Company Warrants, if the Company Warrants have not been amended
prior to the Effective Time) shall be deemed at any time after the Effective
Time to represent only the right to receive upon such surrender the Merger
Consideration into which such Certificate has been converted or exchanged
pursuant to this Agreement and after the Effective Time the

     

   

holders thereof shall cease to have any other rights as holders of Company
Securities. No interest will be paid or will accrue on any amount payable to
holders of Company Securities as Merger Consideration.

  

(c) _No Further Rights in Company Securities_. _ _All Merger Consideration
paid upon the surrender for exchange of Certificates in accordance with the
terms of this Agreement shall be deemed to have been issued and paid in full
**** satisfaction of all rights pertaining to the Company Securities
represented thereby.

  

(d) _Termination of Exchange Fund_. Any portion of the Exchange Fund which
remains undistributed to the holders of Certificates upon the expiration of
two years following the Effective Time shall be delivered to the Surviving
Corporation upon demand, and any holders of Company Securities who have not
theretofore complied with this Article III shall thereafter look only to the
Surviving Corporation, and only as general creditors thereof, for payment of
any claim for Merger Consideration.

  

(e) _No Liability_. __ None of the Surviving Corporation, Parent, Merger Sub
or the Exchange Agent shall be liable to any Person in respect of any cash or
other assets from the Exchange Fund delivered to a public official pursuant
to any applicable abandoned property, escheat or similar law. If any
Certificate has not been surrendered prior to the later of (i) two years
after the Effective Time and (ii) immediately prior to the date on which any
cash or other assets, if any, in respect of such Certificate would otherwise
escheat to or become the property of any Governmental Entity, any such cash
or other assets in respect of such Certificate shall, to the extent permitted
by applicable Law, become the property of the Surviving Corporation, free and
clear of all claims or interests of any Person previously entitled thereto.

  

(f) _Investment of Exchange Fund_. __ The Exchange Agent shall invest
the cash included in the Exchange Fund in a money market deposit account
selected by Parent prior to the Closing. Any interest and other income
resulting from such investments shall be paid to Parent.

any material respect the ability of the Company to perform its obligations
under this Agreement, (y) prevent or materially impede, interfere with,
hinder or delay the consummation of the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement, or (z) filings and notices not required to be made or given until

from federal income taxation under Section 501(a) of the Code; (ii) a
favorable IRS determination letter has been received and, since the date of

termination within the meaning of Section 41l(d)(3) of the Code; (iv) no

making contributions on or before the Closing Date to any Employee Plan which
is a pension plan subject to Section 4064(a) of ERISA. No event has occurred
and no condition exists, with respect to any Employee Plan that would be
reasonably likely to subject the Company to any Tax, fine, Lien, penalty or
other Liability imposed by ERISA, the Code or any other applicable Laws,
which, when added to all other Liabilities under this paragraph would
reasonably be expected to have a Company Material Adverse Effect.

award or entitlement under any Employee Plan, whether or not such occurrence

280G, and whether or not another subsequent action or event (or lack thereof)
in addition to the transactions contemplated hereby would be required to
trigger such occurrence.

individually or in the aggregate, have or be reasonably expected to have, a
Company Material Adverse Effect. All of the Permits are in full force and
effect except where any such failure to be so in effect would not,
individually or in the aggregate, have or be reasonably expected to have, a
Company Material Adverse Effect, and there is no proceeding or investigation
pending, or to the knowledge of the Company, threatened which would
reasonably be expected to lead to the revocation, amendment, failure to renew
or suspension of any such Permit. Each of the Company and each Company
Subsidiary has filed

     

   

when due all documents required to be filed with any Governmental Entity in
connection with such Permits except where the failure to file such
documents would not, individually or in the aggregate, have or be
reasonably expected to have, a Company Material Adverse Effect, and, at the
time of the filing thereof, all such filings were accurate and complete in
all material respects.

  

 **Section 4.19. _Compliance with Laws_.**

  

Neither the Company nor any Company Subsidiary is in violation of, or has
since December 31, 2003, violated or failed to comply with any Law (other
than Environmental Laws, ERISA and Laws with respect to Taxes which are
addressed elsewhere in Article IV) applicable to its business or operations,
except for violations and failures to comply that would not, individually or
in the aggregate, have, or be reasonably expected to have, a Company Material
Adverse Effect.

  

 **Section 4.20. _Brokerage Fees_.**

  

The Company has not retained any financial advisor, broker, agent or finder
or agreed to pay a financial advisor, broker, agent or finder on account of
this Agreement or any transaction contemplated hereby or any transaction of
like nature except for Lehman Brothers Inc. and Credit Suisse Securities
(USA) LLC, the fees of which will be paid by the Company.

  

 **Section 4.21. _Affiliate Agreements_.**

  

 **Except as set forth on _Schedule 4.21_ , there are no oral or written
agreements between the Company or any Company Subsidiary and (i) any officer
or director of the Company or any Company Subsidiary; (ii) any record or
beneficial owner of the voting stock of the Company, or (iii) any Affiliate
of any such officer, director or record of beneficial owner other than
payment as compensation for services rendered by employees in the
ordinary course of employment by the Company or any Company Subsidiary or as
otherwise provided pursuant to Employee Plans.**

  

 **Section 4.22. _No Other Representations or Warranties_.**

  

Except for the representations and warranties contained in this Article IV,
each of Parent and Merger Sub acknowledges that none of the Company, any
Affiliate of the Company or any other Person on behalf of the Company or any
of its Affiliates makes any other express or implied representation or
warranty with respect to the Company or with respect to any other information
provided to Parent or Merger Sub in connection with the transaction
contemplated hereunder. None of the Company, any Affiliate of the Company or
any other Person will have or be subject to any liabilities or
indemnification obligation to Parent, Merger Sub or any other Person
resulting from the distribution to Parent or Merger Sub (or any of their
advisors), or Parents or Merger Subs (or their advisors) use of, any such
information, including any information, documents, projections, forecasts or
other material made available to Parent or Merger Sub in the Data Room or
management presentations in expectation of the transactions contemplated by
this Agreement.

# **REPRESENTATIONS AND WARRANTIES OF PARENT AND MERGER SUB**

  

Parent and Merger Sub hereby represent and warrant to the Company as follows:

  

 **Section 5.01. _Organization_.**

  

Each of Parent and Merger Sub is a real estate investment trust or
corporation, as applicable, duly incorporated, validly existing and in good
standing under the laws of the jurisdiction of its incorporation. Each of
Parent and Merger Sub has full corporate power and authority to conduct its
business as it is now being conducted and to own, operate or lease the
properties and assets it currently owns, operates or holds under lease.
 Each of Parent and Merger Sub is duly qualified or licensed to do business
and is in good standing as a foreign corporation in each jurisdiction where
such qualification or licensing is necessary, except where the failure to so
qualify or be so licensed would not prevent or materially delay
the consummation of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement. Parent
owns beneficially, and Parent or one of its wholly-owned subsidiaries owns of
record, all of the outstanding capital stock of Merger Sub, in each case free
and clear of all Liens. Prior to the date hereof, Parent has provided to the
Company the name of the "ultimate parent entity" for purposes of obtaining
the approvals of the Governmental Entities contemplated by this Agreement.

  

 **Section 5.02. _Authorization_.**

  

Each of Parent and Merger Sub has all requisite corporate power and authority
to enter into this Agreement and to perform its obligations hereunder. The
execution and delivery of this Agreement by each of Parent and Merger Sub and
the consummation by each of Parent and Merger Sub of the transactions
contemplated hereby have been duly approved by the Board of Directors and
stockholders of each of Parent and Merger Sub, and no other corporate
proceedings on the part of Parent or Merger Sub are necessary to authorize
the Merger or this Agreement, to perform their respective obligations
hereunder or to consummate the transactions contemplated hereby.  This
Agreement has been duly and validly executed and delivered by each of Parent
and Merger Sub and, assuming due authorization, execution and delivery by the
Company, constitutes the legal, valid and binding obligation of each of
Parent and Merger Sub, enforceable against each of Parent and Merger Sub in
accordance with its terms, except as such enforcement may be subject to (i)
bankruptcy, insolvency, reorganization, moratorium, fraudulent transfer or
other similar laws relating to creditors rights generally, (ii) general
principles of equity (whether applied in a proceeding at law or in equity)
and (iii) any implied covenant of good faith and fair dealing.

  

 **Section 5.03. _No Violation_.**

  

The execution and delivery of this Agreement by Parent and Merger Sub does
not, and the consummation by Parent and Merger Sub of the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement will not, (i) conflict with, or result in any
violation of or default or loss of any benefit under, any provision of Parent
and Merger Subs respective Certificates of Incorporation or By-laws; (ii)
subject to the matters described in Section 5.04, conflict with or result in
any violation

     

   

of or default or loss of any benefit under, any Law or Judgment of
any Governmental Entity applicable to Parent or Merger Sub or by which any of
their respective properties are subject; or (iii) conflict with, or result in
a breach, termination (or right of termination) or violation of or default
or loss of any benefit under the terms of any agreement, contract, indenture
or other instrument to which Parent or Merger Sub is a party or by which
Parent or Merger Sub or any of their respective properties are subject, or
constitute a default or loss of any right thereunder or an event which, with
the lapse of time or notice or both, might result in a default or loss of any
right thereunder, except with respect to clauses (ii) and (iii) hereof, where
the breach, termination, violation, default, loss of benefit, acceleration or
loss of right or other occurrence would not prevent or materially delay
the consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby.

  

 **Section 5.04. _Approvals_.**

  

The execution and delivery of this Agreement and the consummation of the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement by each of Parent and Merger Sub
do not and will not require the consent, approval, order, authorization or
Permit of any Governmental Entity under any Law or Judgment, and no
declaration, filing or registration with any Governmental Entity is required
by Parent or Merger Sub in connection with the execution and delivery of this
Agreement and the consummation of transactions contemplated by
this Agreement, except for (i) the filing of the Certificate of Merger as
required by the DGCL and the filing of appropriate documents with the
relevant authorities of other states in which Parent and Merger Sub are
qualified to do business, (ii) filings pursuant to the HSR Act, and the
expiration or termination of the applicable waiting period under such Act,
and (iii) those other consents, approvals, orders, authorizations,
Permits, filings, declarations or registrations the failure of which to
obtain or make would not prevent or materially delay the consummation of the
transactions contemplated hereby.

  

 **Section 5.05. _Litigation_.**

  

There are no Proceedings pending or, to the knowledge of Parent or Merger
Sub, threatened against Parent or any of its Affiliates by or before any
Governmental Entity or by any Person that would, or would reasonably be
expected to, prevent or materially delay the consummation of the transactions
contemplated hereby.  Neither Parent nor any of its Subsidiaries nor any of
their respective properties is or are a party to or bound by any Judgment
that would, or would reasonably be expected to, prevent or materially delay
the consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby.

  

 **Section 5.06. _Available Funds_.**

  

### (a) Parent has delivered to the Company true and complete copies of the
written financial commitment, dated as of the date hereof (the " _Financing
Commitment_ ") from Merrill Lynch Capital Corporation and Merrill Lynch,
Pierce, Fenner and Smith Incorporated, addressed to Parent, pursuant to which
the financing parties have agreed to lend the amounts set forth therein (the
" _Financing_ ").

  

### (b) The Financing Commitment is in full force and effect and has not been
amended or modified, and the commitments contained therein have not been
withdrawn or

     

   

### rescinded in any respect. The Financing Commitment, in the form delivered
to the Company, is a legal, valid and binding obligation of Parent and, to
the knowledge of Parent, the other parties thereto. There are no other
agreements, side letters or arrangements relating to the Financing Commitment
that could affect the availability of the Financing. No event has occurred
which, with or without notice, lapse of time or both, would constitute a
default or breach on the part of Parent under any term or condition of the
Financing Commitment, and Parent has no reason to believe that it will be
unable to satisfy on a timely basis any term or condition of closing to be
satisfied by it contained in the Financing Commitment. Parent has fully paid
any and all commitment fees or other fees required by the Financing
Commitment to be paid on or before the date of this Agreement. There are no
conditions precedent or other contingencies related to the funding of the
full amount of the Financing, other than as set forth in or contemplated by
the Financing Commitment. The aggregate proceeds contemplated by
the Financing Commitment will be sufficient for Parent, Merger Sub and
the Surviving Corporation to consummate the transactions contemplated
hereby, including payment of the aggregate Merger Consideration and any
applicable fees and expenses. As of the date of this Agreement, Parent does
not have any reason to believe that any of the conditions to the Financing
will not be satisfied or that the Financing will not be available to Parent
on the Closing Date.

  

 **Section 5.07. _Brokerage Fees_.**

  

Neither Parent nor Merger Sub has retained any financial advisor, broker,
agent or finder or agreed to pay any financial advisor, broker, agent or
finder on account of this Agreement or any transaction contemplated hereby or
any transaction of like nature except for Merrill Lynch Capital Corporation
and Merrill Lynch, Pierce, Fenner and Smith Incorporated, the fees of which
will be paid by Parent.

  

 **Section 5.08. _No Other Representations or Warranties_.**

  

Except for the representations and warranties contained in this Article V,
the Company acknowledges that none of Parent, Merger Sub or any other Person
on behalf of Parent or Merger Sub makes any other express or implied
representation or warranty with respect to Parent or Merger Sub or
with respect to any other information provided to the Company.

The Company shall (and shall cause each Company Subsidiary to) afford to the
officers, employees, accountants, counsel and other representatives of Parent
and Merger Sub, reasonable access, during normal business hours, during the
period prior to the Effective Time, to all of the properties, books,
contracts, commitments and records of the Company and the Company
Subsidiaries; _provided_ that nothing herein shall require the provision of
such access to the extent it would interfere unreasonably with the business
or operations of the Company or the Company Subsidiaries or otherwise result
in any unreasonable interference with the prompt and timely discharge by such
employees of their normal duties. Prior to Closing, Parent and Merger Sub
will hold and treat and will cause their respective officers, employees,
auditors and other authorized representatives to hold and treat in confidence
all documents and information concerning the Company and the Company
Subsidiaries made available to Parent or Merger Sub in connection with the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement in accordance with the provisions
of the existing confidentiality agreement between the Company and Reit
Management and Research LLC dated as of June 13, 2006 (the " _Confidentiality
Agreement_ "), _provided_  public disclosure which is reasonably believed by
Parent to be necessary in connection with the Financing, issuance of the
Securities or distribution of equity of a Subsidiary of Parent to its
shareholders or which Parent or any of its Affiliates are advised by counsel
is required by Law or the rules of any national securities exchange to be
disclosed shall not be deemed a violation of

     

   

Parents or Merger Subs obligations under this Section 6.02 or under
the Confidentiality Agreement.  Notwithstanding anything herein to the
contrary, neither the Company nor any of the Company Subsidiaries shall be
required to provide access to or to disclose information where such access or
disclosure would violate or prejudice the rights of its clients, jeopardize
the attorney-client privilege of the Company or the Company Subsidiaries or
contravene any Law or binding agreement entered into prior to the date of
this Agreement (it being agreed that the Company, Parent and Merger Sub shall
use their reasonable best efforts to cause such information to be provided in
a manner that does not cause such violation or jeopardization).

  

 **Section 6.03. _Consents and Approvals_.**

  

### (a) Each of the Company, Parent and Merger Sub shall use all reasonable
efforts to take, or cause to be taken, all actions and to do, or cause to be
done, all things necessary, proper or advisable to consummate and make
effective the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, including, without
limitation, (i) to comply promptly with all legal requirements which may be
imposed on it with respect to this Agreement and the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement by any Governmental Entity (which actions
shall include furnishing all information required by applicable Law in
connection with approvals of or filings with any Governmental Entity),
including filing, or causing to be filed, as promptly as practicable, any
required notification and report forms (x) under the HSR Act with the Federal
Trade Commission (the " _FTC_ ") and the Antitrust Division of the United
States Department of Justice (the " _Antitrust Division_ "), (ii) to obtain
any other Requisite Regulatory Approvals in connection with the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement or the taking of any action contemplated by
this Agreement, and (iii) to take any action necessary to defend vigorously,
lift, mitigate or rescind the effect of any litigation or administrative
proceeding involving any Governmental Entity adversely affecting this
Agreement or the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, including
promptly appealing any adverse court or administrative decision. Without
limitation of the foregoing, the Company, Parent, Merger Sub and their
respective Affiliates shall not extend any waiting period or comparable
period under the HSR Act or enter into any agreement with any Governmental
Antitrust Authority not to consummate the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement, except with the prior written consent of the other parties hereto.
For purposes of this Agreement, a " _Governmental Antitrust Authority_ "
shall mean any Governmental Entity with regulatory jurisdiction over any
Requisite Regulatory Approval under the HSR Act or similar Laws intended to
prohibit, restrict or regulate actions having an anticompetitive effect or
purposes.

  

### (b) Without limiting the generality of the undertakings and subsection
(a) of this Section 6.03 and subject to appropriate confidentiality
protections, the Company, on the one hand, and Parent and Merger Sub, on the
other hand, shall each furnish to the other such necessary information and
reasonable assistance as the other party may request in connection with the
foregoing and shall each promptly provide counsel for the other party with
copies of all filings made by such party, and all correspondence between such
party (and its advisors) with any Governmental Antitrust Authority and any
other information supplied by such party and such partys Affiliates to a
Governmental Antitrust Authority in connection with this Agreement and the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement. Each party shall, subject
to applicable Law, permit counsel for the other party to review in advance
any proposed written and, if practicable, oral, communication to any
Governmental Antitrust Authority. Upon the terms and

     

   

### subject to the conditions herein provided, in case at any time after the
Closing Date any further action is necessary or desirable to secure
the approvals from any and all Governmental Antitrust Authorities necessary
to carry out the purposes of this Agreement, the proper officers and/or
directors of the parties shall use all reasonable efforts to take or cause to
be taken all such further action.

  

### (c) Without limiting the generality of the undertakings and subsections
(a) and (b) of this Section 6.03, the Company, Parent and Merger Sub agree to
take or cause to be taken the following actions: (i) provide as promptly as
practicable information and documents requested by any Governmental Antitrust
Authority necessary, proper or advisable to permit consummation of the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement, (ii) take, or cause to be taken,
all actions necessary, proper or advisable to obtain the approval for
consummation of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement by any
Governmental Antitrust Authority, which actions shall include each of Parent
and Merger Subs agreement to (x) sell or otherwise dispose of, or
hold separate and agree to sell or otherwise dispose of, any entities, assets
or facilities of the Company or a Company Subsidiary or any entity, facility
or asset of Parent or its Affiliates, (y) terminate, amend or assign such
existing relationships and contractual rights and obligations (other than
termination that would result in a breach of a contractual obligation to a
third party) and (z) amend, assign or terminate such existing licenses or
other agreements (other than a termination that would result in a breach of a
license or such other agreement with a third party) and to enter into such
new licenses or other agreements (and, in each case, to enter into agreements
with the relevant Governmental Antitrust Authority giving effect thereto) in
each case with respect to the foregoing clauses (x), (y) or (z) if such
action is necessary or advisable or as may be required by any Governmental
Antitrust Authority, _provided_  that any such action contemplated by this
clause (ii) shall not be required to be effective prior to the Closing and
(iii) take promptly, in the event that any permanent or preliminary
injunction or other order is entered or becomes reasonably foreseeable to be
entered in any proceeding that would make consummation of the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement in accordance with the terms of this Agreement
unlawful or that would prevent or delay consummation of any such transaction,
any and all steps (including the appeal thereof, the posting of a bond or the
taking of the steps contemplated by clause (ii) of this subsection (c))
necessary to vacate, modify or suspend such injunction or order so as to
permit such consummation on a schedule as close as possible to
that contemplated by this Agreement. The Company, Parent and Merger Sub
agree to offer the other parties, if possible, a reasonable opportunity to
participate in all telephonic conferences and all meetings with a
Governmental Antitrust Authority.

  

### (d) The filing fees under the HSR Act, as well as the fees and
disbursements of any legal counsel or other advisor jointly retained by the
parties in connection with any such filings, shall be borne by Parent.

  

 **Section 6.04.** _Employment Matters_.

  

(a) After the Effective Time, the Surviving Corporation shall either (i)
continue the existing Employee Plans of the Company and the Company
Subsidiaries as disclosed on _Schedule 4.15(a)_ , or (ii) provide substitutes
for some or all of such Employee Plans that provide compensation or benefits
to employees of the Company and the Company Subsidiaries that are no
less favorable in the aggregate to such employees than the replaced

     

   

Employee Plans until December 31, 2007; _provided_ , _however_ , that in no
event shall the Surviving Corporation be obligated to continue, provide or
otherwise take into account Employee Plans that relate to stock options,
restricted stock, stock rights or any other equity-based arrangements; and
_provided_ _further_  that nothing herein shall be construed to mean that the
Surviving Corporation cannot amend or terminate any particular Employee Plan
or Plans so long as the aggregate benefits to such employees under the
remaining Employee Plans and all substituted plans are no less favorable to
such employees than the existing Employee Plans until such date.
For purposes of any such benefit plans, (A) Parent and the
Surviving Corporation shall grant all employees of the Company credit for
purposes of eligibility and vesting for all service with the Company and the
Company Subsidiaries prior to the Effective Time for which such service was
recognized by the Company; (B) any limitations on pre-existing conditions
shall be waived (but only to the extent such conditions were covered prior to
the Effective Time unless required by Law); and (C) expenses incurred
with respect to the plan year in which the Closing occurs on or before the
Effective Time shall be taken into account for purposes of establishing
satisfaction of any applicable deductible, coinsurance and maximum out-of-
pocket provisions to the same extent taken into account prior to the
Effective Time.

  

(b) From and after the Effective Time, the Surviving Corporation shall honor
(i) the Transaction Bonus Agreements; and (ii) the Companys severance plan
and severance agreements which are disclosed on _Schedule 4.15(a)_ , in
each case, in accordance with the terms thereof.

  

(c) Nothing in this Agreement shall be construed as granting any Person any
rights of continuing employment, other than as provided by contract.

  

(d) Parents current intention is that the Companys headquarters will remain
at its current location.

  

(e) As soon as reasonably practicable following the date hereof, the Company
shall provide to the employees of the Company or Company Subsidiaries party
to the Transaction Bonus Agreements an amendment thereto providing that the
payout amounts will be payable in connection with the Merger whether the
Closing is before or after December 31, 2006.

  

 **Section 6.05.** _Publicity_.

  

Prior to the Closing, none of the Company, Parent, Merger Sub or any of their
agents or representatives shall issue or cause the publication of any press
release or other public statement or announcement with respect to this
Agreement or the transactions contemplated hereby without the prior written
consent of the Company and Parent (such consent not to be unreasonably
withheld or delayed), except as may be required by Law, or by the rules of
any national securities exchange or automated quotation system to which
Parent or any Affiliate of Parent is or becomes subject, and in such
case shall use its reasonable best efforts to consult with Parent and/or
the Company, as applicable, prior to such release or announcement being
issued, provided Parent may issue such press releases or other public
statements or announcements as it reasonably determines necessary and
advisable in connection with its investor relations program, conducted in the
normal course, without the prior written consent of the Company.

     

   

 **Section 6.06. _Notification of Certain Matters_.**

  

From and after the date of this Agreement until the earlier of the Effective
Time or termination of this Agreement pursuant to and in accordance with
Section 8.02, the Company shall give prompt notice to Parent, and Parent
shall give prompt notice to the Company, of the occurrence or non-occurrence
of any event or events the occurrence or non-occurrence of which,
individually or in the aggregate, would make the timely satisfaction of any
of the conditions set forth in Article VII impossible or unlikely. This
Section 6.06 shall not constitute a covenant or agreement for the purposes of
Sections 7.02(b) and 7.03(b).

  

 **Section 6.07. _Directors  and Officers Indemnification_.**

  

(a) Without limiting any additional rights that any employee may have under
any Employee Plan, from and after the Effective Time, the Surviving
Corporation will indemnify and hold harmless each Person who is now, or has
been at any time prior to the date hereof, a director or officer of the
Company or of any Company Subsidiary or a Person entitled to indemnification
(individually a " _Covered Party_ " and collectively the " _Covered Parties_
"), with respect to any Proceedings and/or damages, penalties, Judgments,
assessments, losses, costs and expenses (including, but not limited to,
attorneys fees) based in whole or in part on, or arising in whole or in part
out of any matter arising out of or pertaining to matters existing or
occurring at or prior to the Effective Time, whether asserted or claimed
prior to, at or after the Effective Time, to the fullest extent that Parent
or the Surviving Corporation is permitted under applicable law. In the event
of any such Proceeding, (i) each Covered Party will be entitled to
advancement of expenses incurred in the defense of any Proceeding from Parent
or the Surviving Corporation within ten business days of receipt by Parent or
the Surviving Corporation from the Indemnified Party of a request therefor,
(ii) neither Parent nor the Surviving Corporation shall settle, compromise or
consent to the entry of any Judgment in any existing or threatened Proceeding
(and in which indemnification could be sought by such Covered Party
hereunder), unless such settlement, compromise or consent includes an
unconditional release of such Covered Party from all Liability arising out of
such Proceeding or such Covered Party otherwise consents, and (iii) the
Surviving Corporation shall cooperate in the defense of any such matter.

  

(b) The certificate of incorporation and by-laws of the Surviving Corporation
shall contain provisions no less favorable with respect to
indemnification, advancement of expenses and exculpation of individuals who
were directors and officers prior to the Effective Time than are presently
set forth in the Companys Certificate of Incorporation and By-Laws, which
provisions shall not be amended, repealed or otherwise modified for a period
of six years from the Effective Time in any manner that would adversely
affect the rights thereunder of any such individuals.

  

(c) At or prior to the Effective Time, Parent shall obtain "tail" or
"runoff" insurance policies with a claims period of at least six years from
the Effective Time with respect to directors and officers liability
insurance, in either case in an amount and scope at least as favorable as the
Companys existing policies from an insurance carrier with the same or better
credit rating as the Companys current insurance carrier for the Covered
Parties; _provided_  that the annual cost thereof shall not exceed 300% of
the current annual premium paid by the Company for its existing coverage in
the aggregate. Parent shall, and shall cause the Surviving

     

   

Corporation to, honor and perform under all indemnification
agreements entered into by the Company or any of the Company Subsidiaries.

  

(d) If the Surviving Corporation or any of its successors or assigns (i)
shall consolidate with or merge into any other Person and shall not be the

rights otherwise available to the current and former officers and directors
of the Company by Law, charter, statute, by-law or agreement, and shall

Parties and their heirs.

  

(f) This covenant is intended to be for the benefit of, and shall be
enforceable by, each of the Covered Parties and their respective heirs and

Subject to the terms and conditions herein provided, except as otherwise
expressly provided herein, each of the parties hereto agrees to use all

merger, consolidation or other business combination with any of the Company

and other communications, regarding or furnish to any other Person any
information with respect to, or otherwise cooperate in any way, assist or
participate in, facilitate or encourage any effort or attempt by any other
Person to seek to do any of the foregoing or (iii) consider, entertain or
accept any proposal from any Person to do any of the foregoing; _provided_
that notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, any actions taken by
the Company or a Company Subsidiary in accordance with or otherwise permitted
by Section 6.01 shall not be deemed to be a violation of this Section 6.14.**

  

 **Section 6.15. _Repayment of Outstanding Indebtedness_.**

  

Not less than two business days prior to the Closing Date, the Company shall
deliver to Parent payoff letters from third-party lenders, in form and
substance reasonably satisfactory to Parent, with respect to the Indebtedness
of the Company and the Company Subsidiaries identified on _Schedule 6.15_
or incurred after the date hereof in compliance with Section 6.01. Such
payoff letters shall specify the amount necessary to repay such Indebtedness
and completely discharge the obligations of the Company and the Company
Subsidiaries with respect thereto. At Closing, Parent shall provide to the
Surviving Corporation the aggregate amount necessary to make such repayment
and discharge, and shall cause the Surviving Corporation or a Company
Subsidiary to discharge such Indebtedness in accordance with the delivery
instructions provided in such payoff letters.

business of the Company and the Company Subsidiaries between the date of this
Agreement and the Effective Time, the Company shall cause its officers and
the officers of the Company Subsidiaries to confer in good faith with one or
more representatives of Parent as often as Parent shall reasonably request

executive offices for a representative of Parent.

  

 **Section 6.17. _Real Property Matters_.**

the title insurance company insuring the Surviving Corporations or the

of Section 4.12, provided such affidavits and certifications do not increase
any obligations or liabilities of the Company set forth in this Agreement.

  

 **Section 6.18. _Additional Financial Statements_.**

  

In the event required by the Securities Act or the Exchange Act and solely in
connection with obtaining the Financing or otherwise consummating the Merger,
so long as the out-of-pocket costs and expenses of the Company in connection
therewith are Special Costs, as soon as reasonably practicable upon request
of Parent, (a) the Company shall use reasonable efforts to prepare
consolidated balance sheets and statements of income, cash flows and changes
in stockholders equity (the " _Additional Financial Statements_ ") for the
Company (and any and all documents and consents related thereto) which comply
with Regulation S-X under the Securities Act, for inclusion in any
registration statement or other public filing of Parent or any Affiliate of
Parent under the Securities Act or the Exchange Act, and any other offering
circular or document used by Parent or any Affiliate of Parent in any other
offering of securities, whether public or private, (b) the Company shall use
reasonable efforts to cause PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP (" _PWC_ "), its
independent accountants, to cooperate with Parent in connection with
the foregoing (including, without limitation, using reasonable efforts to
cause PWC to deliver so-called "comfort letters" and written consents
relating to the foregoing). Without limiting the generality of the
foregoing, the Company agrees that, upon reasonable notice from Parent, it
will (y) consent to the use of such Additional Financial Statements in any
such registration statement, document or circular and (z) execute and
deliver, and use reasonable efforts to cause its officers to execute and
deliver (if required), such "representation" letters as are customarily

accountants may reasonably request under the circumstances.

(d) the Company shall have obtained the consents and Requisite Regulatory

 **Section 8.01. _Closing_.**

  

(a) Unless this Agreement shall have been terminated and the Merger
abandoned, the closing of the transactions contemplated hereby (the "
_Closing_ ") shall take place at the offices of Simpson Thacher and Bartlett
LLP, 425 Lexington Avenue, New York, New York on the third business
day following the satisfaction or waiver of the conditions set forth in
Article VII (excluding conditions that, by their terms, cannot be satisfied

parties shall exchange the documents referred to in Article VII and all
necessary filings with the Secretary of State to consummate the Merger under
the DGCL (including the Certificate of Merger) shall be made in accordance
with the applicable provisions of the DGCL.

  

(b) Notwithstanding the foregoing, if in Parents reasonable judgment
delaying the Closing is necessary or desirable in connection with obtaining
the Financing or consummation of the "Restructuring" substantially as
contemplated by the Financing Commitment (i) so that consummation of the
Merger pursuant to this Agreement will not result in a disqualification of
Parents status as a real estate investment trust under the Code, or (ii) in
connection with any filings with respect to the Securities or such
Restructuring with the Securities and Exchange Commission relating to
the transactions contemplated by this Agreement deemed necessary or desirable
by Parent: (A) Parent shall have the right, by notice given to the Company on
or prior to the third business day following the satisfaction of the
conditions set forth in Article VII, to delay the Closing until such date as
Parent shall determine (but not later than January 31, 2007); and (B) Parent
shall have the further right (if Parent has exercised its right to delay the
Closing under subclause (A)), by notice given to the Company on or prior to
January 26, 2007, to delay the Closing to the extent that, in
Parents reasonable judgment, such delay is necessary or desirable in
connection with obtaining the Financing for either or both of the reasons set
forth in clauses (i) and (ii) above, until such date as Parent shall
determine (but not later than June 30, 2007); _provided_  that if Parent
exercises its right to delay the Closing under subclause (B), simultaneously

Agent an amount of cash equal to one hundred million dollars
($100,000,000.00) (the " _Good Faith Deposit_ ") pursuant to an escrow
agreement on mutually agreeable terms consistent with the terms of this
Agreement. If the Merger shall not have occurred on or prior to June 29,
2007 (X) other than as a result of the failure to be satisfied (or waived)
of one or more of the applicable conditions set forth in Sections 7.01 or
Section 7.02(b), (d) and (e), the Good Faith Deposit (and interest accrued
thereon) shall be paid to the Company and may be retained by it in addition
to and not in lieu of any other remedy available to the Company at law or in
equity, and, accordingly, shall not be deemed to be a substitute therefor or

     

   

approximation thereof, or (Y) as a result of the failure to be satisfied (or
waived) of one or more of the applicable conditions set forth in Section 7.01
or Section 7.02(b), (d) and (e), the Good Faith Deposit (and interest accrued
thereon) shall be paid to Parent. The escrow agreement referred to above
shall contain provisions with respect to the timing and procedure
of distributions of the Good Faith Deposit (and interest accrued
thereon) consistent with the foregoing, and shall provide that, upon
consummation of the Merger, the Good Faith Deposit (and interest accrued
thereon) shall be applied to the Exchange Fund.

  

 **Section 8.02. _Termination_.**

  

Anything herein or elsewhere to the contrary notwithstanding, this Agreement

time prior to the Effective Time, whether before or after obtaining the

(i) by mutual written consent of Parent, Merger Sub and the Company;

  

(ii) by the Company or Parent, if the Merger shall not have occurred on
or prior to January 31, 2007, or if Parent has exercised its rights under
Section 8.01(b)(B), if the Merger shall not have occurred on or prior to June
30, 2007; _provided_ , _however,_ that the right to terminate this Agreement
and abandon the Merger under this clause (ii) shall not be available to any
party whose failure to fulfill any obligation under this Agreement has been
the cause of, or resulted in, the failure of the Merger to occur on or prior
to such date; or

  

(iii) by the Company or Parent in the event that any court of
competent jurisdiction or other Governmental Entity located or having
jurisdiction within the United States shall have issued a final Judgment or
taken any other final action restraining, enjoining or otherwise prohibiting
the Merger and such Judgment or other action is or shall have become final
and nonappealable.

  

 **Section 8.03. _Effect of Termination_.**

  

In the event of the termination of this Agreement as provided in Section 8.02
hereof, written notice thereof shall forthwith be given to the other parties
specifying the provision hereof pursuant to which such termination is made,
and this Agreement shall forthwith become null and void, and there shall be
no liability on the part of any of the parties hereto except (i) for fraud or
for willful breach of this Agreement (it being understood and agreed that any
failure by Parent or Merger Sub to consummate the Merger in accordance with
the terms of this Agreement due to the failure of Parent to obtain the
Financing shall be deemed to be a willful breach of this Agreement) and (ii)
as set forth in Section 9.02.

, that after the date hereof, there shall be made no amendment that by
Law requires further approval by the stockholders of the Company without
the further approval of such stockholders.  No modification of or amendment
to this Agreement shall be valid unless in a writing signed by the parties
hereto referring specifically to this Agreement and stating the parties
intention to modify or amend the same.

  

### (b) Any party hereto may (i) extend the time for the performance of any
of the obligations or other acts of the other parties hereto, (ii) waive
any inaccuracies in the representations and warranties contained herein or in
any document delivered pursuant hereto and (iii) subject to the requirements
of applicable Law, waive compliance with any of the agreements or
conditions contained herein. Any such extension or waiver shall be valid if
set forth in an instrument in writing signed by the party or parties to be
bound thereby and referring specifically to the term or condition to be
waived. The failure of any party to assert any rights or remedies shall not
constitute a waiver of such rights or remedies.

 **The parties agree that irreparable damage would occur in the event that
any of the provisions of this Agreement were not performed in accordance with

which such parties are entitled at law or in equity. The parties agree that,
notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this Agreement, in the
event of a breach of this Agreement by Parent or Merger Sub (whether or
not due to a failure to obtain the Financing), the damages recoverable by
the Company for itself and on behalf of the holders of the Company Securities
shall be determined by reference to the total amount that would have been
recoverable by the holders of Company Securities if all such holders brought
an action against Parent as intended third party beneficiaries hereunder.**
