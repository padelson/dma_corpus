ARTICLE 1

THE TRANSACTIONS

 

1.1 _Transferred Assets_. Upon the terms and subject to the conditions set
forth in this Agreement, at the Closing, Seller and Selling Subsidiary shall
(and, where applicable, shall cause their respective Subsidiaries to) sell,
transfer, assign, convey and deliver to Buyer or one or more of its  Subsidiaries, and Buyer shall (and, where applicable, shall cause its
Subsidiaries to) purchase, acquire and accept from Seller, Selling Subsidiary
and their respective Subsidiaries, all right, title and interest of Seller,
Selling Subsidiary and their respective Subsidiaries in, to and under (a) all
of the assets, properties and rights (including contractual rights) of every
kind and description, real, personal or mixed, tangible or intangible,
wherever located, and whether or not reflected on the financial statements or
other books and records of Seller or any of its Subsidiaries, exclusively used
in the Business as it is operated by Seller and its Subsidiaries as of the
date hereof and on the Closing Date and (b) the Transferred PCIe Assets
(collectively, the " _Transferred Assets_ "), free and clear of all Liens.
Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement, the phrase
"used exclusively" (or similar references), when used with respect to the
Business, the Business Products, or the Transferred PCIe Assets, shall mean
used exclusively with respect to all (or any subset of) the Business, the
Business Products, and/or the Transferred PCIe Assets collectively as a
whole. For the avoidance of doubt, (X) no asset of Seller or its Subsidiaries
shall be excluded from the Transferred Assets because it is used in both the
Business and in Sellers or its Subsidiaries PCIe Switches or PCIe Retimers
and (Y) if an asset of Seller or its Subsidiaries is used in both the Business
and in Sellers or its Subsidiaries PCIe Switches or PCIe Retimers (but in no
other businesses, products or services of Seller or its Subsidiaries), then
such asset would be deemed to be used exclusively in the Business and used
exclusively with respect to the Transferred PCIe Assets. Without limiting the
generality of the foregoing, the Transferred Assets shall include the
following, whether or not any of such assets, properties or rights have any
value for accounting purposes or are carried or reflected on or specifically
referred to in Sellers or any Affiliate of Sellers financial statements:

(a) all Business Products;

(b) all Transferred Tangible Property;

(c) all Transferred Inventory; 

(d) all Transferred IP;

(e) all Transferred Leases;

(f) all Transferred Contracts;

 

(g) all Transferred Permits;

(h) all Transferred Books and Records;

(i) all Transferred Claims;

 

(j) all assets set forth on _Schedule 1.1(j)_ ; and

(k) copies of all files and records associated with Transferred Employees.

1.2  _Excluded Assets_. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary set forth in
this Agreement, all assets of Seller and its Subsidiaries that are not
Transferred Assets (collectively, the " _Excluded Assets_ ") shall remain the
property of Seller and its Subsidiaries as of the Closing and shall not be
transferred to or otherwise acquired by Buyer or any of its Subsidiaries
pursuant to or in connection with this Agreement or the Transactions
contemplated hereby. Excluded Assets shall include (and in no event shall the
definitions of the Transferred Assets listed in _Section 1.1_ be deemed to
include): (a) any interests of Seller and its Subsidiaries in Real Property
other than the Transferred Leases; (b) any Hazardous

 



-2-   Material waste created prior to the Closing; (c) any Hazardous Material not
required for or reasonably expected to be required for the continued conduct
of the Business after the Closing in the manner being conducted or planned to
be conducted at the Closing; (d) all Accounts Receivable of Seller or any of
its Subsidiaries; (e) all Tax refunds and credits of Seller; (f) all Tax books
and records and Tax-related documents of Seller and its Subsidiaries; (g) all
Business Employee Benefit Plans and any assets of such Business Employee
Benefit Plans; (h) all human resources documents related to any Business
Employee who is not a Transferred Employee; (i) any product developed,
manufactured, distributed or sold by Seller or any of its Subsidiaries (or by
any other Person whose Liability Seller or any of its Subsidiaries has
retained or assumed either contractually or by operation of Law) other than
the Business Products; (j) all Licensed IP; (k) any assets set forth in
Section 4.4(b) of the Seller Disclosure Schedule that are not specifically
scheduled as Transferred Assets on any Schedule to this Agreement; (l) any
Third Party Components, other than Open Source Software, set forth in Section
4.11(j) of the Seller Disclosure Schedule that are not specifically scheduled
as Transferred Assets on any Schedule to this Agreement; (m) any Third Party
Components that are Open Source Software set forth in Section 4.11(k) of the
Seller Disclosure Schedule that are not specifically scheduled as Transferred
Assets on any Schedule to this Agreement; (n) any items listed in Section
4.8(b) of the Seller Disclosure Schedule that are not specifically scheduled
as Transferred Assets on any Schedule to this Agreement; and (o) all Contracts
that are not Transferred Contracts.

 

1.3 _Assumed Liabilities_. Upon the terms and subject to the conditions of
this Agreement, at the Closing, Buyer shall accept, assume and agree to pay,
perform or otherwise discharge, in accordance with the respective terms and
subject to the respective conditions thereof, only the Assumed Liabilities.
For purposes of this Agreement, the term " _Assumed Liabilities_ " means the
Liabilities specifically set forth or described in paragraphs (a) through (g)
below, whether or not any such Liabilities have a value for accounting
purposes or are carried or reflected in or specifically referred to in
Sellers or any Affiliate of Sellers financial statements:

(a) all Liabilities arising after the Closing under the Transferred Leases
and Transferred Contracts, but only to the extent such obligations (i) do not
directly arise from or directly relate to any violation, breach or default by
Seller or any of its Subsidiaries of any provision of any of such Transferred
Leases or Transferred Contracts, and (ii) do not directly arise from or
directly relate to any event, circumstance or condition occurring or existing
prior to the Closing that constitutes or has resulted in, or, with notice or

of any such Transferred Leases or Transferred Contracts or, in the case of the
Transferred Leases, a liability to the lessee, under applicable Law;

 

(b) all open purchase orders and any other backlog of Seller or its
Subsidiaries, in either case incurred in the ordinary course of business and
that relate exclusively to the Business, that have not been fulfilled as of
the Closing, and that are listed on _Schedule 1.3(b)_ ;

(c) those Liabilities accrued as of immediately prior to the Closing for
vacation, severance, pay in lieu of notice and other accrual-based employee
benefits for Transferred Employees but only to the extent such payments and
benefits are listed and quantified on a per Person basis on _Schedule 1.3(c)_
and (i) are expressly provided for under a Business Employee Benefit Plan
disclosed on _Section 4.15(e)_ of the Seller Disclosure Schedule and a true
and accurate copy of such Business Employee Benefit Plan has been made
available to Buyer; (ii) are expressly required by applicable Laws (including

after the Closing in respect of services provided by the Transferred
Employees to Buyer after the Closing or the termination thereof;

(g) all Liabilities arising after the Closing that exclusively relate to the

1.4 _Excluded Liabilities_. Seller, Selling Subsidiary and Buyer hereby
expressly acknowledge and agree that Buyer shall only accept, assume and
agree to pay, perform or otherwise discharge the Assumed Liabilities hereunder
and the Assumed Liabilities shall not include, and neither Seller nor any
Subsidiary of Seller shall assign to Buyer pursuant to this Agreement or any
other Transaction Agreement, and Buyer shall not accept or assume or be
obligated to pay, perform or otherwise assume or discharge, any Liabilities of
Seller or any Affiliate of Seller, whether direct or indirect, known
or unknown, absolute, contingent or otherwise pursuant to or under the

Liabilities_ " means any and all Liabilities of Seller or any of its
Affiliates that do not constitute Assumed Liabilities and includes any and
all Liabilities set forth or described in paragraphs (a) through (q) below, in
each case whether or not any such Liability has a value for accounting
purposes or is carried or reflected on, or specifically referred to in,
Sellers or the applicable Affiliates financial statements:

1.5 _Legal Transfer and Physical Delivery_.

(a) The Transferred Assets shall be sold, conveyed, transferred, assigned and
delivered, and the Assumed Liabilities shall be assumed, pursuant to transfer
and assumption agreements and such other instruments in such form as may be
necessary or appropriate to effect a conveyance of the Transferred Assets and
an assumption of the Assumed Liabilities in the jurisdictions in which such
transfers are to be made. Such transfer and assumption agreements shall be
jointly prepared by Buyer and Seller and shall include, in addition to the

-5-  (b) Seller and Selling Subsidiary will (i) prepare for the removal and
relocation of any Transferred Tangible Property located at facilities that
are not to be purchased, assigned, subleased, transferred to or otherwise
occupied by Buyer or any of its Subsidiaries pursuant to this Agreement or any
other agreement entered into in connection with the Transactions, or, if a

(each such facility, an " _Excluded Seller Facility_ ") and remove and
relocate such Transferred Assets from the relevant Excluded Seller Facility
prior to the Closing, and (ii) prepare for the removal and relocation of any
tangible Excluded Assets located at facilities that are to be purchased,
assigned or transferred to Buyer and its Subsidiaries and not subleased or

with the Transactions (each such facility, a " _Post-Closing Buyer Facility_
") and remove and relocate such Excluded Assets from the relevant Post-Closing
Buyer Facility prior to the Closing. The reasonable costs of any such removal
and relocation shall be borne equally by Buyer and Seller. Subject to
the provisions hereof, each of Seller, Selling Subsidiary and Buyer agrees to
cooperate, and agrees to cause their respective Subsidiaries, as applicable,
to cooperate with each other, and provide each other all assistance reasonably
requested by the other party in connection with the planning and
implementation of the removal and relocation of any such Transferred Assets or
Excluded Assets to such location as Buyer or Seller, as applicable, will
designate.

 

(c) Transfer and delivery of the Transferred IP and Licensed Technology shall
include physical or electronic delivery of all Transferred IP and Licensed
Technology, including delivery or production of Documentation Deliverables and
other appropriate documentation thereof as reasonably requested by Buyer to
facilitate the transfer and operation of the Business. The Parties
shall cooperate in good faith to define and transfer such Transferred IP and
Licensed Technology, but it is understood and acknowledged that Seller and
Selling Subsidiary are ultimately responsible for delivering (i) the
Transferred IP and (ii) the Licensed Technology, to the extent (A) reasonably
requested by Buyer or (B) reasonably necessary in order to exercise the rights
granted to Buyer with respect to such Licensed Technology. To the maximum
extent commercially practicable, all Software and each other Transferred
Asset capable of delivery by electronic means to be delivered hereunder shall
be delivered by electronic means in a manner reasonably specified by Buyer.
Except as expressly permitted in the License Agreement or in the Transition
Services Agreement, neither Seller nor any Affiliate of Seller shall retain in
its possession or control any Transferred IP or Transferred Technology or any
copy thereof.

 

(d) From time to time following the Closing, Seller, Selling Subsidiary and
Buyer shall, and shall cause their respective Affiliates to, execute,
acknowledge and deliver all such further conveyances, notices, assumptions,
releases, powers of attorney and acquittances and such other instruments, and
shall take such further actions, as may be reasonably necessary or appropriate
to fully and effectively transfer, assign and convey to Buyer and its
Subsidiaries and their respective successors or assigns, all of the
properties, rights, titles, interests, estates, remedies, powers and
privileges intended to be conveyed to Buyer and its Subsidiaries under this
Agreement and to fully and effectively transfer, assign and convey to Buyer
and its Subsidiaries and their respective successors and assigns, the Assumed
Liabilities intended to be assumed by Buyer and its Subsidiaries under this
Agreement, and to otherwise make effective the Transactions contemplated
hereby and to confirm the right, title or interest of Buyer and its
Subsidiaries in the Transferred Assets, to put Buyer and its Subsidiaries in
actual possession and operating control thereof, including (i) transferring
back to Seller and its Subsidiaries any Liability not contemplated by this
Agreement to be an Assumed Liability, which Liability was transferred to Buyer
and its Subsidiaries at Closing and (ii) transferring to Buyer and its
Subsidiaries any Liability contemplated by this Agreement to be an Assumed
Liability which was not transferred and/or delivered to Buyer and its
Subsidiaries at Closing.

 

(e) From time to time after the Closing, Seller and Selling Subsidiary shall
(and shall cause each of their respective Subsidiaries to) execute and
deliver such other instruments of transfer and

 



-6-   documents related thereto and take such other action as Buyer may reasonably
request in order to more effectively transfer to Buyer and its Subsidiaries,
and to place Buyer and its Subsidiaries in possession and control of, the
Transferred Assets, or to enable Buyer and its Subsidiaries to exercise and
enjoy all rights and benefits of Seller and its Subsidiaries with respect
thereto. Buyer shall take such actions as Seller may reasonably request in
order to assure Buyer and its Subsidiaries assumption of the Assumed
Liabilities. With respect to any Transferred Lease, Buyer shall cooperate with
Seller in attempting to obtain any necessary consents in connection with
such transfer, including without limitation (a) providing financial
statements and references as may be reasonably requested by the lessor under
such Transferred Lease, (b) agreeing to any amendments to such Transferred
Lease as may be reasonably requested by the lessor under such Transferred
Lease and (c) entering into a direct lease with the lessor, if reasonably
requested by the lessor and on terms that are not materially more adverse to
Buyer in comparison to those of the Transferred Lease or otherwise acceptable
to Buyer in its reasonable discretion.

(f) If, during the four-year period after the Closing, Buyer determines in
good faith that any material asset that falls within the definition of a
"Transferred Asset" was not included on a Schedule and/or not transferred to
Buyer as of the Closing, Seller or its Subsidiary, as applicable, shall
promptly, without payment of further consideration by Buyer, transfer and
assign such asset to Buyer, which assignment shall be deemed to have been
effective as of the Closing, the relevant Schedule shall be amended
accordingly, as applicable, and upon such transfer Buyer and its Affiliates
(as applicable) shall grant to Seller and its Affiliates (as defined in the
License Agreement) a license to such asset as a "Memory Controller Patent,"
"PCIe Patent," "Other Licensed Transferred Intellectual Property Right," or
"Licensed Transferred PCIe Technology," as applicable, under the terms of the
License Agreement with respect to products of Seller and its Affiliates (as
defined in the License Agreement) as then used or under development. If,
during the four-year period after the Closing, Seller determines in good faith
that any material asset (excluding any asset listed as a Transferred Asset on
a Schedule to this Agreement, which may not be requested by Seller) was, but
should not have been, transferred to Buyer as of the Closing, Buyer or its
Subsidiary, as applicable, shall promptly, without payment of consideration by
Seller, transfer and assign such asset to Seller, and upon such transfer
Seller and its Affiliates (as applicable) shall grant to Buyer and its
Affiliates a license to such asset as "Licensed IP" under the terms of the
License Agreement with respect to products of Buyer and its Affiliates as
then used or under development. Any dispute regarding whether an asset should
be assigned hereunder shall be resolved in accordance with _Section 13.11_.

 

1.6 _Non-Assignable Assets_.

(a) Nothing in this Agreement nor the consummation of the Transactions
contemplated hereby shall be construed as an attempt or agreement to sell,
transfer, assign, convey or deliver any asset, property or right to Buyer or
any of its Subsidiaries ( _provided_ , that this _Section 1.6(a)_ shall not
affect whether any asset, property or right shall be deemed to be a
Transferred Asset for any other purpose under this Agreement, including for
purposes of _Article 4_ ) or for Buyer or any of its Subsidiaries and their
respective successors and assigns to assume any Assumed Liability which by its
terms or by Law is not transferable or assignable, as applicable, without the
consent or waiver of a third party or is cancelable by a third party in the
event of such a transfer or assignment without the consent or waiver of such
third party, in each case unless and until such consent or waiver shall have
been obtained (collectively, the " _Non-Assignable Assets_ ").

(b) Seller shall, and shall cause its Subsidiaries to, use its and their
commercially reasonable efforts to obtain, or to cause to be obtained, any
consent or waiver that is required for Seller and its Subsidiaries to sell,
transfer, assign, convey and deliver the Transferred Assets to Buyer and
its Subsidiaries pursuant to this Agreement. Notwithstanding anything to the
contrary herein, if the third party to any Transferred Asset conditions its
grant of a consent (including by threatening to exercise a 

 



-7-   "recapture" or other termination right) upon, conditions its agreement to
enter into a Replacement Contract upon, or otherwise requires in response to a
notice or consent request regarding this Agreement, the payment of a consent
fee, "profit sharing" payment or other consideration, or the provision of
additional security (including a guaranty) (each, a " _Transfer Fee_ "), (i)
Seller shall be responsible for the payment of any Transfer Fee for a
Transferred Asset or Replacement Contract that is exclusively related to the
Business and (ii) the Parties shall share equally in the payment of a Transfer
Fee for a Transferred Asset or a Replacement Contract that is not exclusively
related to the Business; provided that in the case of clause (ii), the terms
of such Transfer Fee shall be subject to both Buyers and Sellers approval,
in each case not to be unreasonably withheld. To the extent permitted by
applicable Law, in the event any such consent, waiver or Replacement Contract
cannot be obtained prior to Closing, (i) the Non-Assignable Assets subject
thereto and affected thereby shall be held, as of and from the Closing, by
Seller or the Selling Subsidiary, as applicable, in trust for the benefit of
Buyer, and all benefits and obligations existing thereunder shall be for
Buyers account, (ii) Buyer shall pay, perform or otherwise discharge (in
accordance with the respective terms and subject to the respective conditions
thereof, and in the name of Seller or the Selling Subsidiary) all of the
covenants and obligations of Seller or Selling Subsidiary, as applicable,
incurred after the Closing with respect to such Non-Assignable Assets, (iii)
Seller or Selling Subsidiary, as applicable, shall take or cause to be taken
at its own expense such actions in its name or otherwise as Buyer may
reasonably request so as to provide Buyer with the benefits of such Non-
Assignable Assets and to effect the collection of money or other consideration
that becomes due and payable under such Non-Assignable Assets, and promptly
pay over to Buyer all money or other consideration received by it in respect
of such Non-Assignable Assets, and (iv) the Parties, as applicable, shall
mutually cooperate to provide any other alternative arrangements as may be
reasonably required to implement the purposes of this Agreement and the other
Transaction Agreements. If and when such consent or waiver is obtained
following Closing, Seller shall, and shall cause its Subsidiaries to, sell,
transfer, assign, convey and deliver such Non-Assignable Asset to Buyer or its
applicable Subsidiaries for no additional consideration.

(c) As of and from the Closing, Seller and Selling Subsidiary authorize
(and shall cause each of their respective Subsidiaries to authorize) Buyer
(and, to the extent applicable, each of its Subsidiaries), to the extent
permitted by applicable Law and the terms of the Non-Assignable Assets, at
Buyers expense, to perform all the obligations and receive all the benefits
of Seller, Selling Subsidiary and their respective Subsidiaries under the Non-
Assignable Assets.

1.7 _Shared Contracts_.

(a) _Schedule 1.7(a)_ sets forth a list of all Shared Contracts.

(b) Seller shall use its commercially reasonable efforts prior to the Closing
to cause the counterparty to (i) each Shared Contract listed on _Schedule
1.7(b)_ (each, a " _Required Shared Contract_ ") and (ii) each other Shared
Contract that is not a Required Shared Contract that Buyer identifies as a
Shared Contract that Buyer desires to assume in part or with respect to which
Buyer desires to enter into a Replacement Contract (A) in writing to Seller
within thirty (30) days after the date hereof (the " _Shared Contract Election
Date_ ") or (B) on _Schedule 3.3(b)(v)_ (each an " _Identified Shared
Contract_ "), to consent to a partial assignment to Buyer or one or more of
its Subsidiaries that is not subject to termination by the Seller or its
Subsidiaries of such portions of such Required Shared Contract or Identified
Shared Contract that are exclusive to the Business (each such assignment, a "
_Partial Shared Contract Assignment_ "), or to otherwise enter into a
Replacement Contract for such Required Shared Contract or Identified Shared
Contract, in each case as of the Closing, and Buyer shall use its commercially
reasonable efforts to cooperate with Seller with regard to the foregoing.

 



-8-  (c) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary herein, if a counterparty to any
Required Shared Contract or Identified Shared Contract at any time conditions
its grant of a consent (including by threatening to exercise a "recapture" or
other termination right) upon, conditions its agreement to enter into a
Replacement Contract upon, or otherwise requires in response to a notice or
consent request regarding this Agreement the payment of a Transfer Fee, (i)
Seller shall be responsible for the payment of any such Transfer Fee for (A)
any Partial Shared Contract Assignment and (B) any Replacement Contract for a
Required Shared Contract and (ii) the Parties shall share equally in the
payment of any Transfer Fee for any Replacement Contract for an Identified
Shared Contract that, as of the date of this Agreement, does not apply solely
to the Business, and the terms of such Transfer Fee referenced in this clause
(ii) shall be subject to both Buyers and Sellers approval, in each case not
to be unreasonably withheld. Seller shall, or shall cause one or more of its
Subsidiaries, as applicable, to consummate each (i) Partial Shared Contract
Assignment and (ii) Replacement Contract for a Required Shared Contract. Any
condition to closing related to a Required Shared Contract for which there is
a Replacement Contract for such Required Shared Contract shall be deemed to be
waived by Buyer.

(d) With respect to each Required Shared Contract and each Identified Shared
Contract, until the earlier of (i) the date that is twelve (12) months after
the Closing Date and (ii) the date such Required Shared Contract or
Identified Shared Contract is acquired by Buyer or its Subsidiary through a
Partial Shared Contract Assignment or a Replacement Contract, Seller shall
not, and shall not permit any of its Subsidiaries to, take any action to
terminate prior to its expiration such Required Shared Contract or Identified
Shared Contract, or take any action or fail to take any action that would
permit the other party to any such Required Shared Contract or Identified
Shared Contract to terminate prior to its expiration such Required Shared
Contract or Identified Shared Contract; _provided_ that Seller or any of its
Subsidiaries, as applicable, shall be able to terminate such Required Shared
Contract or Identified Shared Contract pursuant to the terms of such Required
Shared Contract or Identified Shared Contract in the event of a material
breach by any counterparty thereto. Seller shall promptly notify Buyer of any
circumstances which could reasonably be expected to result in any such
termination. Notwithstanding the foregoing, Seller shall not be required to
partially assign to Buyer or any of its Subsidiaries any of the Shared
Contracts for which consent has not been obtained.

 

(e) With respect to each Required Shared Contract or Identified Shared
Contract for which the arrangements described in  _Section 1.7(b)_ could not
be entered into prior to the Closing Date, Seller agrees to continue to use
its commercially reasonable efforts for a period of six (6) months from and
after the Closing Date to cause the counterparty to each such Required Shared
Contract or Identified Shared Contract to consent to a Partial Shared Contract
Assignment of such Required Shared Contract or Identified Shared Contract to
Buyer or one or more of its Subsidiaries, or to otherwise enter into a
Replacement Contract for such Required Shared Contract or Identified Shared
Contract. Until any such consent or Replacement Contract is obtained, Seller
and Buyer will use their respective commercially reasonable efforts to
cooperate in any lawful and reasonable arrangement which will provide Buyer
and its Subsidiaries the obligations and benefits of any such Required Shared
Contract or Identified Shared Contract with respect to the Business, including
subcontracting, licensing, sublicensing, leasing or subleasing to Buyer and
its Subsidiaries any or all of Sellers and its Subsidiaries rights and
obligations with respect to such Required Shared Contract or Identified Shared
Contract with respect to the Business. With respect to that portion of the
Required Shared Contract or Identified Shared Contract that Buyer has notified
Seller pursuant to the first sentence of _Section 1.7(b)_ that it desires to
assume in part, Buyer shall (i) bear the sole responsibility for completion
of the work or provision of goods and services, (ii) be solely entitled to all
benefits thereof, economic or otherwise, (iii) be solely responsible for any
warranty or breach thereof, and any repurchase, indemnity and service
obligations thereof, and (iv) promptly reimburse the reasonable costs and
expenses of Seller and its Affiliates related thereto. If and when such
consents or approvals are obtained or such other required actions have
been taken, the partial assignment of such Required Shared Contract or
Identified Shared Contract will be effected in accordance with the terms of
this Agreement.

 



-9-  1.8 _Payment of Transfer Fees_. Except as set forth below in this Section
1.8, Seller and its Subsidiaries, as applicable, shall promptly pay to the
applicable third party any Transfer Fees payable under this Agreement,
including any portion of any Transfer Fees payable by Buyer under this
Agreement; provided that Buyer shall, prior to Seller or its Subsidiaries, as
applicable, tendering such amounts to the applicable third party, pay such
portion of any Transfer Fee payable by Buyer under this Agreement to Seller.
In the event that Buyer notifies Seller in writing that Buyer will pay a
Transfer Fee in full to the applicable third party under this Agreement,
Seller shall promptly pay its portion of any such Transfer Fee to Buyer and
Buyer shall promptly pay such Transfer Fee in full to such third party.

of the same Inventory Component Type.

 

(ii) " _Closing Inventory_ " shall mean the actual number of units of

the Adjusted Purchase Price based on the foregoing amounts (the amount so

Price_ "), together with reasonably detailed supporting documentation for such
calculations and any additional documentation and information reasonably
requested by Buyer (which shall be promptly provided by Seller).

(c) At the Closing, pursuant to this _Section 2.2(c)_ and  _Section

(d) As promptly as practicable, but in no event later than one hundred twenty
(120) days after the Closing Date (the " _Post-Closing Statement Date_ "),
Buyer may deliver to Seller a statement (the " _Post-Closing Statement_ ")
setting forth Buyers calculation of (i) the Closing Inventory Value (and each

and records, correspondence and other relevant documentation and information
of Buyer related to the Business, and Buyer shall make available its employees
knowledgeable about the information used in, and the preparation of, the Post-
Closing Statement. Seller shall have thirty (30) calendar days following its
receipt of the Post-Closing Statement (the " _Review Period_ ") to review the
same together with all documentation and information requested in accordance
with this  _Section 2.2(e)_ (which shall be promptly provided by Buyer). On
or before the expiration of the Review Period, Seller shall deliver to Buyer a
written statement accepting or disputing the Post-Closing Statement. In the
event that Seller shall dispute the Post-Closing Statement, such statement
shall include a detailed itemization of Sellers objections and the reasons
therefor (such statement, a " _Dispute Statement_ "). Any component of the
Estimated Adjusted Purchase Price that is not disputed in a Dispute Statement

(f) If Seller delivers a Dispute Statement during the Review Period, Buyer and
Seller shall promptly meet and attempt in good faith to resolve their
differences with respect to the disputed items set forth in the Dispute
Statement during the thirty (30) calendar days immediately following Buyers
receipt of the Dispute Statement, or such longer period as Buyer and
Seller may mutually agree (the " _Resolution Period_ "). Any such disputed
items that are resolved by Buyer and Seller during the Resolution Period shall
be final and binding on the Parties and not subject to appeal. If Buyer and
Seller do not resolve all such disputed items by the end of the Resolution
Period, Buyer and Seller shall submit all items then remaining in dispute with
respect to the Dispute Statement to the Accounting Firm for 

 



-11-   review and resolution (with each Party preparing a submission to the
Accounting Firm that reflects all revisions made to such Partys proposal as a
result of the negotiations during the Resolution Period and outlining the
items that remain in dispute at the time of the submission only). The
Accounting Firm shall act as an expert and not an arbitrator. The Accounting
Firm (i) shall determine only those items remaining in dispute between Buyer
and Seller, and (ii) shall only be permitted or authorized to determine an
amount with respect to any such disputed item that is either the amount of
such disputed item as proposed by Buyer in the Post-Closing Statement or the
amount of such disputed item as proposed by Seller in the Dispute Statement.
Each of Buyer and Seller shall (A) enter into a customary engagement letter
with the Accounting Firm at the time such dispute is submitted to the
Accounting Firm and otherwise cooperate with the Accounting Firm, (B) have
the opportunity to submit a written statement in support of their respective
positions with respect to such disputed items, to provide supporting material
to the Accounting Firm in defense of their respective positions with respect
to such disputed items and to submit a written statement responding to the
other partys position with respect to such disputed items and (C) subject to
customary confidentiality and indemnity agreements, provide the Accounting
Firm with access to their respective books, records, personnel and
representatives and such other information as the Accounting Firm may require
in order to render its determination. The Accounting Firm shall be instructed
to deliver to Buyer and Seller a written determination (such determination to
include a worksheet setting forth all material calculations used in arriving
at such determination and to be based solely on information provided to the
Accounting Firm by Buyer and Seller) of the disputed items within thirty (30)
calendar days of receipt of the disputed items, which determination shall be
final and binding on the Parties hereto and not subject to appeal. All fees
and expenses relating to the work, if any, to be performed by the Accounting
Firm will be allocated between Buyer, on the one hand, and Seller, on the
other hand, in the same proportion that the aggregate amount of the disputed
items so submitted to the Accounting Firm that is unsuccessfully disputed by
each such party (as finally determined by the Accounting Firm) bears to the
total disputed amount of such items so submitted. Neither Party shall engage
in ex parte communications with the Accounting Firm with respect to the
Transactions until the Accounting Firm issues its final determination.

(g) In the event that no Post-Closing Statement is delivered within the
period provided in _Section 2.2(d)_, the Estimated Adjusted Purchase Price
shall be the " _Final Adjusted Purchase Price_." In the event that a Post-
Closing Statement is delivered within the period provided in _Section
2.2(d)_, the Adjusted Purchase Price, as determined in accordance with the
final, binding and nonappealable resolution of the calculation of the amount
of Closing Inventory Value and Accrued Employee Liabilities, shall be the "
_Final Adjusted Purchase Price_." As soon as practicable (and in any event
within five (5) Business Days) following the determination of the Final
Adjusted Purchase Price, if the Estimated Adjusted Purchase Price is greater
than the Final Adjusted Purchase Price, Seller shall deliver to Buyer a cash
amount equal to such excess in immediately available funds by wire transfer to
an account or accounts designated in writing by Buyer.

COVENANTS OF PARTIES

7.1 _Commercially Reasonable Efforts_. On the terms and subject to the
conditions set forth in this Agreement, each of Buyer, Seller and Selling
Subsidiary shall use its commercially reasonable efforts to take promptly, or
cause to be taken promptly, all actions, and to do promptly, or cause to be
done promptly, all things necessary, proper or advisable under applicable Laws
to consummate and make effective, in the most expeditious manner practicable,
the Transactions and the other transactions contemplated by this Agreement and
the other Transaction Agreements, including using commercially reasonable
efforts to (a) cause the conditions precedent set forth in  _Section 3.3_ to
be satisfied as soon as practicable after the date hereof, (b) obtain all
necessary or appropriate consents, waivers and approvals under any Transferred
Contracts in connection with this Agreement and the consummation of the
Transactions and the other transactions contemplated by this Agreement and the
other Transaction Agreements so as to maintain and preserve the benefits under
such Transferred Contracts following the consummation of the Transactions and
the other transactions contemplated by this Agreement and the other
Transaction Agreements; (c) obtain all necessary actions or non-actions,
waivers, consents, approvals, Orders and authorizations from Governmental
Authorities, the expiration or termination of any applicable waiting periods,
making all necessary registrations, declarations and filings (including
registrations, declarations and filings with Governmental Authorities, if
any); and (d) prepare, execute and deliver any additional certificates and
other instruments that are necessary to consummate the Transactions and to
fully carry out the purpose and intent of this Agreement and the other
Transaction Agreements.

 

7.2 _Regulatory Filings_.

(a) Without limiting the generality of the foregoing provisions of _Section
7.1_, as soon as may be reasonably practicable following the execution and
delivery of this Agreement, each of Buyer and Seller shall file with the FTC
a Notification and Report Form relating to this Agreement and the other
Transaction Agreement and the transactions contemplated hereby (including the
Transactions) and thereby as required by the HSR Act, as well as comparable
pre-merger notification filings, forms and

 



-44-   submissions with any foreign Governmental Authority that are required by the
Antitrust Laws of any applicable foreign jurisdiction or be deemed desirable
by Buyer, in each case as Buyer may deem necessary and/or appropriate. Each
of Buyer and Seller shall promptly (i) cooperate and coordinate with the other
in the making of such filings, (ii) supply the other with any information that
may be required in order to effectuate such filings, (iii) supply any
additional information that reasonably may be required or requested by the
FTC, the DOJ or the competition or merger control authorities of any other
jurisdiction and that Buyer reasonably deems necessary and/or appropriate,
and (iv) share equally all fees and filing expenses incurred in connection
with filings made in connection with this _Section 7.2(a)_. If any party
hereto or Affiliate thereof receives a request for additional information or
documentary material from any such Governmental Authority with respect to the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement (including the Transactions) or
any of the other Transaction Agreements, then such party shall use
commercially reasonable efforts to make, or cause to be made, as soon as
reasonably practicable and after consultation with the other party, an
appropriate response in compliance with such request. Buyer shall be entitled,
after consultation with Seller and consideration in good faith of the views
of Seller, to make all strategic and tactical decisions as to the manner in
which to obtain from any Governmental Authority any actions or non-actions,
consents, approvals, authorizations, clearances or orders required to be
obtained by Buyer or Seller or any of their respective subsidiaries in
connection with the consummation of the Transactions, including but not
limited to, the timing and content of substantive submissions made to any
Governmental Authority, the timing and content of responses to any query from
a Governmental Authority whether written or verbal, to the extent permitted by
law, the timing of compliance with any request by any Governmental Authority,
and any and all material decisions related to any litigation with any
Governmental Authority. To that end, each of Buyer and Seller shall promptly
inform the other of any communication from any Governmental Authority
regarding any of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement
(including the Transactions) or any of the other Transaction Agreements.

(b) Without limiting the generality of the foregoing provisions of _Section
7.1_, promptly after execution of this Agreement and prior to the Closing,
Seller and Selling Subsidiary will use commercially reasonable efforts, at
Sellers expense, to transfer to or obtain for Buyer and its Subsidiaries all
Permits necessary to allow Buyer and its Subsidiaries to own and operate the
Business and the Transferred Assets immediately following the Closing in the
same manner in which Seller and its Subsidiaries owns and operates
the Business and the Transferred Assets on the date hereof, and Buyer will
cooperate with Seller and Selling Subsidiary in assisting with such transfers
or applications. To prepare for such transfer or receipt of Permits, Seller or
Selling Subsidiary shall have initiated the transfer or application process
prior to the Closing, as applicable, in respect of each such Permit subject to
Buyers having cooperated with such efforts. For purposes of clarity, if the
transfer or application process for a Permit requires a local presence
(either in terms of a local legal entity or agency relationship with a third
party) in connection with such transfer or requires product retesting or
development as a result of standards having changed since the original Permit
issuance as a result of such transfer, Buyer shall be responsible for first
establishing such local presence or retesting or development of such products
and Seller and Selling Subsidiary shall cooperate with Buyer in transferring
or obtaining Permits in such countries. For a period of one (1) year after the
Closing, subject to Buyers cooperation with such efforts, Seller and Selling
Subsidiary shall, at Sellers expense, use commercially reasonable efforts to
complete the transfer or application process for all such Permits that were
not transferred to or obtained for Buyer and its Subsidiaries prior to the
Closing as quickly as commercially practicable.

 

(c) Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the contrary, it is
expressly understood and agreed that: (i) none of Buyer, Seller or Selling
Subsidiary shall have any obligation to litigate or contest any administrative
or judicial action or proceeding or any decree, judgment, injunction or other
order, whether temporary, preliminary or permanent; and (ii) none of Buyer,
Seller or Selling Subsidiary shall be under any obligation to make proposals,
execute or carry out agreements, enter into consent decrees or submit to
orders providing for (A) the sale, divestiture, license or other disposition
or 

 



-45-   holding separate (through the establishment of a trust or otherwise) of any
assets or categories of assets of Buyer or any of its Affiliates or Seller or
any of its Subsidiaries, (B) the imposition of any limitation or regulation
on the ability of Buyer or any of its Affiliates to freely conduct their
business or own such assets, or (C) the holding separate of the Business or
any of the Transferred Assets or any limitation or regulation on the ability
of Buyer or any of its Affiliates to exercise full rights of ownership of the
Business and the Transferred Assets. For the avoidance of doubt, Buyer shall
not be required to, and neither Seller nor Selling Subsidiary may without the
prior written consent of Buyer, in order to comply with any requirements under
the HSR Act or the Antitrust Laws of any applicable foreign jurisdiction,
consent to, or offer or agree to, any requirement, condition,
limitation, understanding, agreement or order to (X) sell, license, assign,
transfer, divest, hold separate or otherwise dispose of any assets, business
or portion of Buyer or any of its Affiliates or Seller or any of its
Subsidiaries, (Y) conduct, restrict, operate, invest or otherwise change the
Business or the Transferred Assets or the business of Buyer or any of its
Affiliates or Seller or any of its Subsidiaries, or (Z) impose any
restriction, requirement or limitation on the Business or operation of the
Business or of the Buyer or any of its Affiliates or Seller or any of its
Subsidiaries; _provided,_ that if requested by Buyer, Seller and its
Subsidiaries will consent to, or offer or agree to, any such requirement,
condition, limitation, understanding, agreement or order so long as such
requirement, condition, limitation, understanding, agreement or order is only
binding on Seller and its Subsidiaries in the event the Closing occurs.

 

7.3 _Access to Information_. During the period from the date hereof and prior
to the earlier of the Closing or the termination of this Agreement, except as
otherwise prohibited by applicable Law (it being understood and agreed that
the Parties shall use their commercially reasonable efforts to cause any
information that is withheld pursuant to applicable Law to be provided
or made available in a manner that is not prohibited by applicable Law),
Seller and Selling Subsidiary shall afford Buyer and its accountants, counsel
and other representatives, reasonable access during Sellers and Selling
Subsidiarys normal business hours to (a) all of the assets, properties,
books and records, Contracts, Permits, commitments, correspondence, documents
and personnel of Seller and its Subsidiaries that are related to the Business
or the Transferred Assets (but only to the extent applicable to the Business
or the Transferred Assets), and (b) all other information concerning the
business, properties and personnel (subject to restrictions imposed by
applicable Law) of Seller and its Subsidiaries that are related to the
Business, the Business Products, the Transferred Assets, the Assumed
Liabilities, or the Leased Real Property (but only to the extent applicable to
the same) as Buyer may reasonably request.

 

7.4 _Notification of Certain Matters_.

(a) Seller shall promptly notify Buyer of (i) the occurrence or non-occurrence
of any event that would reasonably be expected to cause any representation or
warranty of Seller or Selling Subsidiary set forth in this Agreement to be
untrue or inaccurate at or prior to the Closing, (ii) any failure of Seller or
Selling Subsidiary to comply with or satisfy any covenant, condition or
agreement to be complied with or satisfied by it hereunder in any material
respect, and (iii) the occurrence or failure of any event, that, individually
or in the aggregate, results in a Business Material Adverse Effect.

(b) Seller shall deliver monthly unaudited consolidated balance sheets,
unaudited consolidated statements of income and statements of capital
expenditures of the Business within twenty (20) days after each month-end
during the period between execution of this Agreement and the Closing Date.

(c) The delivery of any notice pursuant to this _Section 7.4_ shall not be
deemed to affect or modify, amend or supplement any representation or warranty
set forth herein or the Seller Disclosure Schedule, or the conditions to the
obligations of the Parties to consummate the Transactions in accordance with
the terms and conditions hereof, or the remedies available to the Parties
hereunder.

 



-46-  7.5 _Confidentiality_.

 

(a) Buyer and Seller acknowledge and agree that the existence of this
Agreement (including the Seller Disclosure Schedule) and the
other Transaction Agreements, and the terms and conditions hereof and
thereof, shall constitute "Proprietary Information" under and within the
meaning of the Mutual Confidentiality Agreement, dated as of December 28,
2012, by and between the Parties (the " _Confidentiality Agreement_ "). The
Confidentiality Agreement will terminate at the Closing.

 

(b) For a period of five (5) years after the Closing (and, with respect to the
terms and conditions of this Agreement, at all times after the Closing),
unless required by Law or Order to disclose any Business Confidential
Information or as explicitly permitted by _Section 7.7_, Seller agrees not to
use or disclose at any time (and shall cause each of its Subsidiaries and
Controlled Affiliates not to use or disclose at any time) any Business
Confidential Information. In the event Seller or any of its Controlled
Affiliates are required by Law or Order to disclose any Business Confidential
Information, Seller shall promptly notify Buyer in writing, which
notification shall include the nature of the legal requirement and the extent
of the required disclosure, and Seller and its Controlled Affiliates shall
cooperate with Buyer and Seller to preserve the confidentiality of such
information consistent with such applicable Law or Order. For all purposes of
and under this Agreement, the term " _Business Confidential Information_ "
shall mean all information of a confidential or proprietary nature (whether
or not specifically labeled or identified as "confidential"), in any form or
medium, to the extent related to the business, products, financial condition,
services, or research or development of the Business, the Transferred PCIe
Assets, Seller and its Subsidiaries or their respective suppliers,
distributors, customers, independent contractors or other business relations,
including the following: (i) internal business and financial
information (including information relating to strategic and staffing plans
and practices, business, finances, training, marketing, promotional and sales
plans and practices, cost, rate and pricing structures and accounting and
business methods); (ii) identities of, individual requirements of, specific
contractual arrangements with, and information about, the Business, Seller and
its Subsidiaries suppliers, distributors, customers, independent contractors
or other business relations and their confidential information; (iii) trade

reports and all similar or related information (whether or not patentable);
and (v) other Intellectual Property Rights. Notwithstanding the foregoing, "
_Business Confidential Information_ " does not include (a) information that
was or has become generally available to the public other than as a result of
disclosure by Seller or its Affiliates after the date hereof, or (b)
information that is independently developed by Seller or its Affiliates or
Subsidiaries (other than by or on behalf of the Business or Seller and its
Subsidiaries prior to the Closing) without the use of Buyers or its
Affiliates or Seller and its Subsidiaries Business Confidential Information.
Nothing in this _Section 7.5(b)_ is intended to prevent Seller from
exercising any of its rights under the License Agreement or fulfilling its
obligations under the Transition Services Agreement, _provided_ that Seller
protects the confidentiality of Business Confidential Information as required
by this _Section 7.5(b)_ and complies with  _Section 10.1_.

7.6 _Exclusivity_. Seller and its Subsidiaries shall not authorize or permit

(including by way of furnishing non-public information) or participate in any
discussions or negotiations (and as of the date hereof, Seller and its
Subsidiaries shall immediately cease any discussions or negotiations that are
ongoing) regarding, any proposal or inquiry that constitutes, or that would be
reasonably expected to lead to, an Acquisition Proposal, or (c) enter into any
letter of intent or other oral or written agreement or understanding relating
to any Acquisition Proposal. Seller will notify Buyer promptly, and in any
event within 24 hours, if any

 



-47-   third party makes any proposal, offer, inquiry or contact with respect to
any of the foregoing (including the terms thereof and the identity of such
third party). Seller shall be deemed to have breached the terms of this
_Section 7.6_ if any of its Subsidiaries or any of its or their respective
Affiliates, representatives, officers, employees, directors or agents takes
any action, whether in his or her capacity as such or in any other capacity,
that is prohibited by this _Section 7.6_. " _Acquisition Proposal_ " means
any proposal or offer, or an inquiry relating to a proposal or offer, from any
Person (other than Buyer and its Affiliates in connection with the
Transactions) for any (i) direct or indirect acquisition of the Business or
any portion of the Transferred Assets (other than Inventory in the ordinary
course of business consistent with past practice), whether by sale of stock,
sale of assets, merger, recapitalization or otherwise or (ii) any joint
venture or other non-ordinary course strategic investment involving the
Business or any portion of the Transferred Assets.

 

7.7 _Public Statements_. Except as necessary to comply with any listing

made pursuant to the last sentence of this _Section 7.7_, or otherwise
required by Law, prior to the Closing, neither Buyer nor Seller shall,
without the prior written consent of the other, directly or indirectly make or
issue any public statement or other communication to the public or to any
third party not bound to the disclosing Party by obligations of
confidentiality regarding the subject matter of this Agreement or any of the
other Transaction Agreements, or the terms and conditions hereof or thereof,
including, if applicable, the termination of this Agreement and the reasons
therefor, or any disputes or arbitration proceedings hereunder or thereunder.
Buyer and Seller shall issue mutually agreed press releases and shall file
mutually agreed Forms 8-K promptly following the date hereof. After the
Closing, Buyer or Seller may issue any releases of information without the
consent of any other Party. The Parties agree and acknowledge that Buyer or
Seller may file this Agreement and disclose the acquisition of the Business in
its periodic reports filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission and
discuss the acquisition of the Business otherwise as required by Law,
including without limitation discussion of the proposed sale or acquisition of
the Business during any earnings or any other investor calls or presentations,
provided such disclosures are materially consistent with the disclosures
included in any periodic reports filed with the Securities and Exchange
Commission.

 

7.8 _Insurance_. Following the Closing, to the extent permitted under
applicable Law and the insurance policies of Seller covering liabilities of
the Business, at Buyers request, Seller and Selling Subsidiary shall use
commercially reasonable efforts to make claims on behalf of Buyer and/or one
or more of its Subsidiaries under the insurance policies of Seller (or any
of its Subsidiaries) covering Liabilities of the Business, in each case
solely for Liabilities arising and/or matters occurring prior to the Closing;
_provided_ , _however_ , that neither Seller nor Selling Subsidiary shall be
required by this  _Section 7.8_ or any other term or provision of this
Agreement to maintain any insurance policies or coverage following the
Closing. If and to the extent that Seller or any of its Subsidiaries receives
any insurance payment in respect of a claim under an insurance policy
covering liabilities of the Business, Seller and/or its Subsidiaries (as
applicable) shall promptly remit such payment to Buyer, subject to the offset
for any theretofore unpaid out-of-pocket costs and expenses (other than
premiums or retentions) incurred by Seller or any of its Subsidiaries as a
result of the fulfillment of its obligations under this _Section 7.8_ payable
by Buyer pursuant to the immediately preceding sentence.

 

7.9 _Record Retention_. Each Party agrees, on behalf of itself and its
Controlled Affiliates, that for a period of not less than seven (7) years
following the Closing Date, it shall not destroy or otherwise dispose of any
of the books and records relating to the Transferred Assets, the Business
Employees or the Assumed Liabilities in its possession with respect
to periods prior to the Closing. Each Party shall have the right to destroy
all or part of such books and records after the seventh anniversary of the
Closing Date or, at an earlier time by giving each other party hereto twenty
(20) days prior written notice of such intended disposition and by offering
to deliver to the other party, at the other Partys expense, custody of

 



-48-   such books and records as such first party may intend to destroy.
Notwithstanding the foregoing, immediately after the Closing, Seller and
Selling Subsidiary shall deliver to Buyer or destroy copies of Transferred
Technology in Sellers or Selling Subsidiarys possession that are in addition
to copies delivered to Buyer as part of the Closing, whether such copies are
in paper form, on computer media or stored in another form;  _provided_ ,
_however_ , that (a) Seller and Selling Subsidiary are entitled to possess
such copies to the extent expressly permitted by this Agreement, and (b)
Seller and Selling Subsidiary may retain and use copies of financial books
and records relating to the Business.

7.10 _Bulk Sales_. It will not be practicable to comply or to attempt
to comply with the procedures of the Uniform Commercial Code or other bulk
sales laws or similar laws of the jurisdiction in which the Transferred Assets
to be conveyed hereby are situated or of any other jurisdictions which may be
asserted to be applicable to the transaction contemplated hereunder and the
parties believe that it is not clear that any such laws are applicable to such
transaction. Accordingly, to induce Buyer to waive any requirement for
compliance on the part of Seller and Selling Subsidiary with the procedures
of any such laws, Seller and Selling Subsidiary hereby agree to indemnify and
hold harmless the Buyer Indemnified Parties, in accordance with the provisions
of _Article 12_ , from and against, and to compensate and reimburse the Buyer
Indemnified Parties, in accordance with the provisions of _Article 12_ , for,
any and all Losses arising out of or resulting from the failure of Seller or
Selling Subsidiary to comply with or perform any actions in connection with
the provisions of any such law of any states or jurisdictions applicable to

ARTICLE 8

EMPLOYEE MATTERS

8.1 _Automatic Transfer Employees_.

 

(a) Except as otherwise set forth in this Agreement, effective as of the
Closing, all rights, powers and Liabilities of Seller and its Subsidiaries
to, or in respect of, any Automatic Transfer Employee (including the rights,
powers and Liabilities under, in connection with or arising from a Contract of
employment or employment relationship between an Automatic Transfer Employee
and Seller or any of its Subsidiaries) in force and effect immediately prior
to the Closing shall remain with, or be transferred by operation of law to,
Buyer or one of its Subsidiaries.

 



-49-  (b) Buyer shall comply (or cause its Subsidiaries to comply) with all
applicable provisions of the Transfer Regulations and other similar country-
specific legal standards or applicable Laws in respect of all Automatic
Transfer Employees. In furtherance and not in limitation of the preceding
sentence, Seller, Selling Subsidiary and Buyer shall (and shall cause their
respective Subsidiaries to, as applicable) comply with all required
obligations under the applicable Transfer Regulations and other similar
country-specific legal standards or applicable Laws to notify and/or
consult with Automatic Transfer Employees or employee representatives,
unions, works councils or other employee representative bodies, if any, and
shall provide such reasonable information to the other Party as is required by
that Party to comply with its notification and/or consultation obligations
under any and all such legal standards and Laws. Seller, Selling Subsidiary
and Buyer shall indemnify and hold harmless each other (and their respective
Indemnified Parties) from and against, and shall compensate and reimburse
each other (and their respective Indemnified Parties) for, any and all Losses
resulting from or arising out of any failure of the other Party to notify
and/or consult, or to provide such information in a timely manner,
in accordance with the foregoing legal standards and Laws.

8.2 _Offered Employees_.

 

(a) Prior to the Closing, Buyer shall, or shall cause one of its Subsidiaries
to, offer employment to each Offered Employee other than any Leave Employee,
in each case effective as of the Closing. Such offers of employment shall be
on terms substantially equivalent, considering salary, terms, active benefit
plans (but excluding for purposes of determining equivalency, the
existence or value of deferred compensation benefits or programs), and
positions, as such employees respectively held or received at Seller
immediately prior to the date hereof. The Parties acknowledge that Buyer does
not currently offer any deferred compensation plan to any of its employees
and has no intentions to adopt any such plan and, thus, for the avoidance of
doubt, is not obligated to provide any such plan as a result of this
Agreement. Effective as of the Closing, Buyer or one of its Subsidiaries
shall hire and employ each Offered Employee who accepts the offer of
employment extended to such Offered Employee pursuant to the first sentence of
this _Section 8.2(a)_. Seller shall provide all reasonable assistance to
Buyer and its Subsidiaries in connection with the offers of employment to the
Offered Employees contemplated by the preceding sentences. Those Offered
Employees who accept employment from Buyer or one of its Subsidiaries pursuant
to the offers of employment made pursuant to this _Section 8.2(a)_ and
commence employment with Buyer or one of its Subsidiaries as of the Closing
(or such later date with respect to the Leave Employees as permitted by
Buyer), together with all Automatic Transferred Employees, shall be referred
to herein collectively as " _Transferred Employees_." Those Offered Employees
who do not accept employment from Buyer or one of its Subsidiaries pursuant to
the offers of employment made pursuant to this _Section 8.2(a)_ and commence
employment with Buyer or one of its Subsidiaries as of the Closing (or such
later date with respect to the Leave Employees) shall be terminated by Seller
promptly following the Closing (or such later date).

(b) Except as required by applicable Law or the terms of the Transition
Services Agreement, from and after the Closing, the Transferred Employees
shall cease to participate in and/or accrue further rights or benefits under
any Business Employee Benefit Plans.

(c) Buyer shall take such steps as are not financially unreasonable or
impractical to permit each Transferred Employee who has received an eligible
rollover distribution (as defined in Section 402(c)(4) of the Code) from the
401(k) plan maintained by Seller, if any, to roll such eligible rollover
distribution, including any associated loans, as part of any lump sum
distribution to the extent permitted by the 401(k) plan maintained by Seller
into an account under a 401(k) plan maintained by Buyer.

 



-50-  (d) With respect to any plan that is a "welfare benefit plan" (as defined
in Section 3(1) of ERISA), or any plan that would be a "welfare benefit plan"
(as defined in Section 3(1) of ERISA) if it were subject to ERISA, maintained
by Buyer or Buyers Subsidiary, Buyer shall cause there to be waived any pre-
existing condition and waiting periods.

(e) Transferred Employees shall be given credit for purposes of
future vacation accrual for the number of years of service with Seller, its
Subsidiaries and any predecessor employer for which Seller or its Subsidiaries
credited service, excluding credit which would result in the duplication of
benefits accrual for the same period of service.

8.3 _Employee Retention Plans_.

 

(a) Seller shall use its commercially reasonable efforts to implement short-
term retention plans for the Transferred Employees, with terms that are
reasonable for the purpose of retaining such Transferred Employees until the
date that is thirty (30) days after the Closing Date, which plans shall be
funded and paid by Seller. All such payments by Seller pursuant to
such short-term retention plans described in this _Section 8.3(a)_ shall be
referred to collectively herein as the " _Seller Incentive Payments_." As of
the date hereof, the amount of the Seller Incentive Payments shall
be $2,242,000, subject to a non-discretionary reduction immediately following
Closing based on the number and category of actual Transferred Employees as
agreed between the parties as of Closing.

 

(b) The Seller Incentive Payments shall be made by Seller to the Transferred
Employees thirty-one (31) days after the Closing Date; provided that if the
thirty-first (31st) day is a weekend or bank holiday, such payment will be
made on the first Business Day thereafter. Promptly following the payment of
such Seller Incentive Payments, Seller shall use commercially reasonable
efforts to assign to Buyer any and all clawback rights associated with such
Seller Incentive Payments, subject to compliance with all applicable laws.
Seller shall provide for (i) a twelve (12) month clawback to fifty
percent (50%) of the Seller Incentive Payments to Key Employees and (ii) a
nine (9) month clawback to fifty percent (50%) of the Seller Incentive
Payments to those Transferred Employees denoted as "Tier 2 Employees." All
other Seller Incentive Payments to Transferred Employees shall not be subject
to any clawbacks. Any material changes to the clawback terms of the Seller
Incentive Payments shall be mutually agreed to by both Buyer and Seller prior
to the Closing Date. 

(c) Buyer and Seller shall use their commercially reasonable efforts to
implement retention plans for the Transferred Employees, with terms that are
reasonable, which plans shall be funded and paid for by Buyer and Seller on a
schedule mutually agreeable to the Parties. The aggregate amount of funding by
Seller of such retention plans for the Transferred Employees at Closing shall
be referred to herein as the "Retention Payments." As of the date hereof, the
Retention Payments shall be $3,157,000, subject to reduction immediately
following Closing based on the number and category of actual Transferred
Employees. As of the date hereof, the aggregate amount of funding by Buyer of
such retention plans for the Transferred Employees shall be $660,000, subject
to a non-discretionary reduction immediately following Closing based on
the number and category of actual Transferred Employees as agreed between the
parties as of Closing. Additionally, Buyer shall issue restricted stock units
to Transferred Employees, consistent with amounts mutually agreed to by both
Buyer and Seller, at the time offer letters are given to such Transferred
Employees.

8.4 _Non-Solicitation of Transferred Employees_. Following the Closing for a
period of two (2) years, Seller shall not, and shall cause its Subsidiaries
and their representatives not to, solicit to

 



-51-   employ, or solicit to provide services to Seller or any of its Subsidiaries,
any Transferred Employee who is then-employed by or otherwise providing
services to Buyer or its Affiliates or any other employee or consultant of
Buyer or its Affiliates who was involved in the Transactions contemplated by
this Agreement and who is then-employed by or then-providing service to Buyer
or its Affiliates. Following the Closing for a period of one (1) year, Buyer
shall not, and shall cause its Subsidiaries and their representatives not to,
solicit to employ, or solicit to provide services to Buyer or any of its
Subsidiaries, any employee or consultant of Seller or its Affiliates who
was involved in the Transactions contemplated by this Agreement and who is
then-employed by or then-providing service to Seller or its Affiliates.
Following the Closing for a period of one (1) year, Seller shall not, and
shall cause its Subsidiaries and their representatives not to, solicit to
employ, or solicit to provide services to Seller or any of its Subsidiaries,
any employee or consultant of Buyer or its Affiliates who was involved in the
Transactions contemplated by this Agreement and who is then-employed by or
then-providing services to Buyer or its Affiliates. For purposes of this
_Section 8.4_, the term " _solicit_ " shall not be deemed to include
generalized searches for employees or consultants through media
advertisements or employment firms. Seller agrees that it will not, and will
cause its Affiliates not to, assert that any Transferred Employees have
breached any agreements with Seller or its Affiliates, including but
not limited to any employment, consulting, noncompete, and/or confidentiality
agreements, by accepting employment with and/or performing any services for
Buyer or any of its Affiliates.

 

8.5 _Tax Reporting_. At Buyers election, which shall be provided in writing
to Seller prior to the Closing, the Parties shall use the alternate procedure
of Revenue Procedure 2004-53 with respect to any employees of the Business who
become employees of Buyer or any of its Affiliates.

8.6 _No Third Party Beneficiaries_. The Parties acknowledge and agree that all
provisions set forth in this _Article 8_ or any other provision of this
Agreement with respect to Business Employees are included for the sole
benefit of the respective Parties and shall not create any right (a) in any
other Person, including any Business Employees, former Employees, any
participant in any Business Employee Benefit Plan or any beneficiary thereof,
(b) to continued employment, either before or after the Closing, with Seller,
Buyer or any of their respective Subsidiaries, or (c) to be construed to
modify, amend or establish any benefit plan, program or arrangement or in any
way affect the ability of the Parties hereto or any other Person to modify,
amend or terminate any of its benefit plans, programs or arrangements;
_provided_ , _however_ , that the Parties acknowledge and agree that the
provisions herein in _Article 8_ do not supersede the rights, under the
Transfer Regulations, of any Automatic Transfer Employee.

 

ARTICLE 9

50% by Buyer and 50% by Seller. Each party shall prepare any Tax Returns
required to be filed by it in connection with such Transfer Taxes at its own
expense. The Parties shall use commercially reasonable efforts to minimize
Transfer Taxes, if any, arising out of the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement, including (to the extent commercially reasonable for Buyer and
Seller) by Buyer accepting delivery of software assets located in the State of
California by electronic transmission from Seller and its Affiliates places
of business to Buyers computers in accordance with California Sales and Use
Tax Regulation 1502(f)(1)(D) and Seller having no obligation to deliver any
tangible assets in connection with the delivery of such software.

9.3 _Allocation of Property Taxes_. Seller and Selling Subsidiary shall be
responsible for and shall promptly pay when due all Property Taxes levied with
respect to the Transferred Assets attributable to the Pre-Closing Tax Period.
All Property Taxes levied with respect to the Transferred Assets for the
Straddle Period shall be apportioned between Buyer and Seller or between Buyer
and Selling Subsidiary, as applicable, based on the number of days of such
Straddle Period included in the Pre-Closing Tax Period and the number of days
of such Straddle Period included in the Post-Closing Tax Period. Seller or
Selling Subsidiary, as applicable, shall be liable for the
proportionate amount of such Property Taxes that is attributable to the Pre-
Closing Tax Period, and Buyer shall be liable for the proportionate amount of

necessary to calculate the proration amount. The proration amount shall be
paid by the party owing it to the other within ten (10) days after delivery of
such statement. In the event that Buyer, Seller or Selling Subsidiary makes
any payment for which it is entitled to reimbursement under this _Section
9.3_, the applicable party shall make such reimbursement promptly but in no
event later than ten (10) days after the presentation of a statement
setting forth the amount of reimbursement to which the presenting party is
entitled along with such supporting evidence as is reasonably necessary to

ARTICLE 10

 

NON-COMPETITION

10.1 _Non-Competition_.

(a) For all purposes of and under this Agreement, the following capitalized
terms shall have the following respective meanings:

(i) " _Competing Business_ " shall mean the design, development, manufacture,
testing, marketing, supporting, maintaining, distributing, provisioning and
selling of Non-Volatile Memory Controllers using PCIe, SAS or SATA interfaces
or NVMe, Scsi, or Scsi Express protocols, including any products and services
that are the same as, or substantially similar in function to, the Business
Products, with any version of the above interfaces or protocols.

 

(ii) " _Competing Territory_ " shall mean worldwide.

 

(b) Seller acknowledges and agrees that Buyer would be irreparably damaged if
Seller or any of its Affiliates were to provide services to or otherwise
participate in a Competing Business and that any such competition by Seller
(or its Subsidiaries or Affiliates) would result in a significant loss of
goodwill by Buyer. Seller further acknowledges and agrees that the covenants
and agreements set forth in this _Article 10_ were a material inducement to
Buyer to enter into this Agreement and to perform its obligations hereunder,
and that Buyer would not obtain the benefit of the bargain set forth in this 

 



-53-   Agreement as specifically negotiated by the parties hereto if Seller
breached the provisions of this _Section 10.1_. Therefore, Seller agrees, in
further consideration of the amounts to be paid hereunder for the Transferred
Assets and the goodwill of Seller sold by Seller that, except with the prior
written consent of Buyer, at all times until the fourth (4th) anniversary of
the Closing Date, Seller shall not, and shall cause its Subsidiaries and
Controlled Affiliates not to, directly or indirectly, engage in, conduct,
manage, operate, own, control or participate in the management of a Competing
Business in the Competing Territory or any portion thereof. Seller
acknowledges that the Business has been conducted or is presently proposed to
be conducted throughout the Competing Territory and that the geographic
restrictions set forth above are reasonable and necessary to protect the
goodwill of the Business being sold by Seller pursuant to this Agreement. 

10.2 _Severability_. If, at the time of enforcement of the covenants contained
in _Section 7.5_,  _Section 8.4_ and this _Article 10_ (the " _Restrictive
Covenants_ "), a court shall hold that the duration, scope or area
restrictions stated herein are unreasonable under circumstances then existing,
the Parties agree that the maximum duration, scope or area reasonable under
such circumstances shall be substituted for the stated duration, scope or area
and that the court shall be allowed and directed to revise the restrictions
contained herein to cover the maximum period, scope and area permitted by
Law. Seller has consulted with legal counsel regarding the Restrictive
Covenants and based on such consultation has determined and hereby
acknowledges that the Restrictive Covenants are reasonable in terms of
duration, scope and area restrictions and are necessary to protect the
goodwill of Sellers Business and the substantial investment in Seller made by
Buyer hereunder. Seller further acknowledges and agrees that the Restrictive
Covenants are being entered into by it in connection with the sale by Seller
of the Transferred Assets and the goodwill of the Business pursuant to this
Agreement and not directly or indirectly in connection with Sellers
employment or other relationship with Buyer.

cause of, or resulted in, the failure of the Transactions to occur on or
before such date and such action or failure to act constitutes a breach of
this Agreement;

11_ , this Agreement shall thereupon and forthwith become void and of no
further force or effect whatsoever, and there shall be no liability or
obligation on the part of Buyer, Seller, Selling Subsidiary or their
respective Affiliates or representatives in connection herewith; _provided_ ,
_however_ , that no such termination shall relieve any Party from liability
resulting from or arising out of any breach of such Partys representations,
warranties, or covenants prior to such termination or impair the right of any
Party to compel specific performance by the other Party of its
obligations under this Agreement; and _provided further_ that the provisions
of _Section 7.5_ (Confidentiality), _Section 7.7_ (Public Statements), this
_Section 11.2_, _Section 11.3_ and _Article 13_ shall remain in full force
and effect and survive any termination of this Agreement under the terms of

all fees, costs and expenses relating to the termination of employment of the
Business Employees except as expressly set forth in _Section 1.3(c)_. Losses

any such representation, warranty, covenant or agreement. No Buyer Indemnified
Party shall be required to show reliance on any representation, warranty,
covenant or other agreement in order for such Buyer Indemnified Party to be
entitled to indemnification, compensation or reimbursement hereunder. Buyer,
Seller and Selling Subsidiary each acknowledge that such Losses, if any, would
relate to unresolved contingencies existing at the Closing, which if resolved
at the Closing would have led to a reduction in the Adjusted Purchase Price
that Buyer would have paid in connection with the Transactions.

 

12.3 _Limitations on Indemnification_. Except for claims arising out of fraud,
intentional misrepresentation or willful breach: 

(a) The Buyer Indemnified Parties shall not be entitled to recover any Losses
under _Section 12.2(a)(ii)_ until such time as the total amount of all
Losses that have been directly or indirectly suffered or incurred by any one
or more of the Buyer Indemnified Parties, or to which any one or more of the
Buyer Indemnified Parties has or have otherwise directly or indirectly become
subject, exceeds $250,000 (the " _Loss Threshold_ "), in which case the Buyer
Indemnified Parties shall be entitled to recovery for all such Losses
(including the amount of the Loss Threshold); _provided_ ,  _however_ , that
the limitation contained in this _Section 12.3(a)_ shall not apply to any
breach of or inaccuracy in any Seller Fundamental Representation, any breach
of or inaccuracy in the representations and warranties contained in  _Section
4.4(b)_, any Excluded Liabilities, any breach of covenant, or fraud,
intentional misrepresentation or willful misconduct.

(b) The maximum aggregate amount of Losses that the Buyer Indemnified Parties
shall be entitled to recover under _Section 12.2(a)(ii_) shall be limited to
thirteen percent (13%) of the Final Adjusted Purchase Price.

(c) The maximum aggregate amount of Losses that the Buyer Indemnified Parties
shall be entitled to recover under _Section 12.2(a)(iv)_ shall be limited to

aggregate amount of Losses that the Buyer Indemnified Parties shall be
entitled to recover under  _Section 12.2(a)(ii) and_ _Section 12.2(a)(iv)_,
collectively, shall be limited to $20,000,000.

(e) The maximum aggregate amount of Losses that the Buyer Indemnified Parties
shall be entitled to recover under _Section 12.2(a)(i_), _Section
12.2(a)(ii)_, _Section 12.2(a)(iii)_, _Section 12.2(a)(iv)_,  _Section
12.2(a)(vi)_ and _Section 12.2(a)(vii)_, collectively, shall be limited to
the Final Adjusted Purchase Price.

(f) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary herein, the maximum aggregate
amount of Losses that the Buyer Indemnified Parties shall be entitled to
recover under _Section 12.2(a)(v)_ or  _Section 12.2(a)(viii)_ shall not be
limited.

 



-58-  (g) The maximum aggregate amount of Losses that the Seller Indemnified Parties
shall be entitled to recover under _Section 12.2(b)(ii_) shall be limited to
thirteen percent (13%) of the Final Adjusted Purchase Price.

shall be entitled to recover under _Section 12.2(b)(i_), _Section
12.2(b)(ii)_, and  _Section 12.2(b)(iii)_, collectively, shall be limited to
the Final Adjusted Purchase Price.

(i) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary herein, the maximum aggregate
amount of Losses that the Seller Indemnified Parties shall be entitled to
recover under _Section 12.2(b)(iv)_ shall not be limited.

 

12.4 _Indemnification Claims_.

(a) If an Indemnified Party is of the opinion that it has or may have a right
to indemnification, compensation or reimbursement under this Agreement (an "
_Indemnification Claim_ "), such Indemnified Party shall so notify the
Indemnifying Party in a written notice (a " _Claim Certificate_ "), prior to
the expiration of the applicable Survival Period (if applicable): (i) stating
that such Indemnified Party has directly or indirectly suffered or incurred
any Losses, or reasonably anticipates that it will directly or indirectly
suffer or incur any Losses, for which it is entitled to indemnification,
compensation or reimbursement under this Agreement; (ii) a brief description
in reasonable detail (to the extent available to such Indemnified Party) of
the facts, circumstances or events giving rise to each item of Losses based on
such Indemnified Partys good faith belief thereof; and (iii) the basis for
indemnification, compensation or reimbursement under this Agreement to which
such item of Losses is related.

(b) In the event that the Indemnifying Party shall seek to contest any
individual items of Losses set forth in a Claim Certificate, the Indemnifying
Party shall so notify the Indemnified Party in writing within thirty (30)
days after receipt of such Claim Certificate, which notice shall set forth a
brief description in reasonable detail of the Indemnifying Partys basis for
objecting to each item of Loss. In the event that the Indemnifying Party
shall fail to object to any items of Loss set forth in a Claim Certificate
within the foregoing thirty-day period, the Indemnifying Party shall be deemed
to have irrevocably agreed and consented to indemnify, compensate and
reimburse the Indemnified Party in respect of such items of Loss pursuant to
the terms of this Agreement.

12.5 _Third Party Claims_. In the event any Action is instituted against an
Indemnified Party which involves or appears reasonably likely to involve an
Indemnification Claim hereunder (a " _Third Party Claim_ "), the Indemnified
Party shall, promptly after receipt of notice of any such Action, notify the
Indemnifying Party of the commencement thereof; _provided_ , _however_ , that
the failure to so notify the Indemnifying Party of the commencement of any
such Action will relieve the Indemnifying Party from liability in connection
therewith only if and to the extent that such failure shall have caused the
damages for which the Indemnified Party is obligated to be greater than such
damages would have been had the Indemnified Party given the Indemnifying
Party prompt notice hereunder. Upon receipt of such notice, the Indemnifying
Party shall have the right, in its sole discretion, to control the defense or
settlement of such Third Party Claim by appointing a recognized and reputable
counsel acceptable to the Indemnified Party to be the lead counsel in
connection with such defense; _provided_ , that prior to the Indemnifying
Party assuming control of such defense it shall first verify to the
Indemnified Party in writing that such Indemnifying Party shall be
responsible for all liabilities and obligations relating to such Third Party
Claim up to the limitations (if any) set forth in _Section 12.3_ and subject
to such limitations, and  _provided_ , _further_ , that:

(a) the Indemnified Party shall be entitled to participate in the defense of
such Third Party Claim and to employ counsel of its choice for such purpose;
_provided_ that the fees and expenses of such separate counsel shall be borne
by the Indemnified Party (other than any fees and expenses of such separate
counsel that are incurred prior to the date the Indemnifying Party
effectively assumes control of such defense which, notwithstanding the
foregoing, shall be borne by the Indemnifying Party, and except that the
Indemnifying Party shall pay all of the fees and expenses of such separate
counsel if the Indemnified Party has been advised by counsel that a reasonable
likelihood exists of a conflict of interest between the Indemnifying Party and
the Indemnified Party);

 



-59-  (b) the Indemnifying Party shall not be entitled to assume control of, or
continue to control if any of the following conditions is not satisfied at
any time following the Indemnifying Partys assumption of control, such
defense (unless otherwise agreed to in writing by the Indemnified Party) and
shall pay the reasonable fees and expenses of counsel retained by the
Indemnified Party if (i) the claim for indemnification, compensation or
reimbursement relates to or arises in connection with any criminal or quasi-
criminal proceeding, action, indictment, allegation or investigation; (ii)
the Indemnified Party reasonably believes an adverse determination with
respect to the Third Party Claim would be detrimental to or injure the
Indemnified Partys reputation, business, operations or future
business prospects; (iii) the claim seeks an injunction or equitable or any
other non-monetary relief against the Indemnified Party; (iv) the Indemnifying
Party fails to vigorously prosecute or defend such claim; (v) the amount of
Losses to be incurred pursuant to such Third Party Claim (when combined with
all other outstanding claims for indemnification, compensation or
reimbursement and any amount previously paid by the Indemnifying Party that
applies toward the applicable cap under  _Section 12.3_ (if any) would be
reasonably expected to exceed the applicable cap contemplated by _Section
12.3_ (if any)) in the reasonable judgment of the Indemnified Party; or (vi)
the claim relates to a breach or alleged breach of _Section 4.4_ (Title;
Sufficiency) or _Section 4.11_ (Intellectual Property);

(c) if the Indemnifying Party shall control the defense of any Third Party
Claim, the Indemnifying Party shall obtain the prior written consent of the
Indemnified Party before entering into any settlement of or consenting to the
entry of any judgment with respect to such claim unless (1) the terms of the
proposed settlement or judgment include as an unconditional and with-prejudice
term thereof the granting by the third party to Buyer and any other relevant
Indemnified Party a release from all Liability in respect of such Third Party
Claim; (2) there is (A) no finding or admission of any violation of Law by any
Indemnified Party, and (B) no finding or admission of any violation of the
rights of any Person by any Indemnified Party; and (3) the sole form of
relief is monetary damages that shall be paid in full by the Indemnifying
Party; and

(d) if the Indemnified Party shall control the defense of any Third Party
Claim, the Indemnified Party shall have the right to settle, adjust or
compromise such Third Party Claim; _provided_ , _however_ , that if the
Indemnified Party settles, adjusts or compromises any such Third Party Claim
without the prior written consent of the Indemnifying Party, such settlement,
adjustment or compromise shall not be conclusive evidence of the amount of
Losses incurred by the Indemnified Party in connection with such Third Party
Claim (it being understood that if the Indemnified Party requests that the
Indemnifying Party consent to a settlement, adjustment or compromise, the
Indemnifying Party shall not unreasonably withhold or delay such consent).

12.6 _Setoff_. Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, on or after
the two year anniversary of the Closing Date, any Retention Payments not
actually paid to any retained Transferred Employee as of such date or
otherwise distributed pursuant to this _Section 12.6_ shall be used to
satisfy, to the maximum extent possible and prior to any indemnity payments
by Seller pursuant to this _Article 12_ , any indemnity payments owed by
Seller to the Buyer Indemnified Parties pursuant to this Agreement. Any
additional indemnity payments owed by Seller to Buyer Indemnified Parties
shall be satisfied in accordance with the other sections of this _Article
12_.

 



-60-  12.7 _Tax Matters_. All indemnity payments made pursuant to this Agreement
shall be treated for all Tax purposes as adjustments to the Adjusted Purchase
Price, unless otherwise required by applicable Law.

12.8  _Release_. Effective upon the Closing, Seller and its Subsidiaries
hereby irrevocably waive, release and discharge Buyer and its Affiliates from
any and all Liabilities of any kind or nature whatsoever, whether arising
under any agreement or understanding (other than under this Agreement and any
Collateral Agreement) or otherwise at law or in equity arising prior to
Closing or relating to pre-Closing periods, and Seller and its Subsidiaries
agree that they shall not seek to recover any amounts in connection therewith
or thereunder from Buyer or any of its Affiliates. In no event shall Buyer or
any of its Affiliates have any Liability whatsoever to Seller or any of its
Subsidiary for any breaches of the representations, warranties, agreements or
covenants of Seller and its Subsidiaries hereunder, and in any event Seller
and its Subsidiaries may not seek contribution from Buyer or any of its
Affiliates in respect of any payments required to be made by Seller or any of
its Subsidiary pursuant to this Agreement.

or Exhibit, such reference shall be to a Schedule or Exhibit to this Agreement
(as applicable) unless otherwise indicated. 

(b) When used herein, (i) the words "hereof," "herein" and "herewith" and
words of similar import shall, unless otherwise stated, be construed to refer
to this Agreement as a whole and not to any particular provision of this
Agreement, and (ii) the words "include," "includes" and "including" shall
be deemed in each case to be followed by the words "without limitation."
Unless the context otherwise requires, "neither," "nor," "any," "either," and
"or" shall not be exclusive.

 

(c) When used herein, references to "$" or "Dollars" shall be deemed to be
references to U.S. dollars.

 

(d) The meaning assigned to each capitalized term defined and used herein
shall be equally applicable to both the singular and the plural forms of such
term, and words denoting any gender shall include all genders. Where a word or
phrase is defined herein, each of its other grammatical forms shall have a
corresponding meaning.

 

(e) When reference is made to any Party to this Agreement or any other
agreement or document, such reference shall include such Partys successors
and permitted assigns.

(f) Unless the context otherwise requires, all references in this Agreement

this Agreement.

(i) The Parties hereto agree that they have been represented by legal counsel

-62-  13.3 _Amendments and Waivers_. Subject to applicable Law, any provision of
this Agreement may be amended or waived if, but only if, such amendment or
waiver is in writing and is signed, in the case of an amendment, by each of
the Parties, or, in the case of a waiver, by the Party against whom the waiver
is to be effective. No course of dealing and no failure or delay on the part
of any Party hereto in exercising any right, power or remedy conferred by this
Agreement shall operate as a waiver thereof or otherwise prejudice such
partys rights, powers and remedies. The failure of any of the Parties to
this Agreement to require the performance of a term or obligation under this
Agreement or the waiver by any of the Parties to this Agreement of any breach
hereunder shall not prevent subsequent enforcement of such term or obligation
or be deemed a waiver of any subsequent breach hereunder. No single or partial
exercise of any right, power or remedy conferred by this Agreement shall
preclude any other or further exercise thereof or the exercise of any other
right, power or remedy.

compensation or reimbursement, to any of its lenders as collateral security.
Any agreement in respect of any Change of Control of Seller shall be subject
to this Agreement.

 

13.5 _Severability_. In the event that any one or more of the provisions of
this Agreement is held invalid, illegal or unenforceable in any respect for
any reason in any jurisdiction, the validity, legality and enforceability of
any such provision in every other respect and of the remaining provisions
hereof shall not be in any way impaired or affected (so long as the economic
or legal substance of the Transactions is not affected in any manner
materially adverse to any party), it being intended that each Parties rights
and privileges shall be enforceable to the fullest extent permitted by
applicable Law, and any such invalidity, illegality and unenforceability in
any jurisdiction shall not invalidate or render unenforceable such provision
in any other jurisdiction (so long as the economic or legal substance of the

13.6 _Specific Performance_. The Parties agree that irreparable damage would
occur in the event that any of the provisions of this Agreement were not
performed in accordance with their specific terms or were otherwise breached.

or injunctions (without proof of damages) to prevent actual or threatened
breaches of this Agreement and to enforce specifically the terms and

are entitled at law or in equity and the Parties hereby agree to waive any
requirements for posting a bond in connection with any such action.

13.7 _Other Remedies_. Except to the extent set forth otherwise herein, any
and all remedies herein expressly conferred upon a party will be deemed
cumulative with and not exclusive of any other remedy conferred hereby, or by
law or equity upon such Party, and the exercise by a Party of any one remedy
will not preclude the exercise of any other remedy.

 



-63-  13.8 _No Third Party Beneficiaries_. Except as specifically set forth or
referred to herein, nothing herein expressed or implied is intended or shall
be construed to confer upon or give to any Person any rights or remedies under
or by reason of this Agreement or any other certificate, document, instrument
or agreement executed in connection herewith nor be relied upon other than
the Parties hereto and their permitted successors or assigns. The
representations and warranties in this Agreement are the product of

circumstances as of the date of this Agreement or as of any earlier date.

 

13.9 _Entire Agreement_. This Agreement, including the Seller Disclosure
Schedule (and all schedules and exhibits thereto), all Schedules and Exhibits
to this Agreement, and each other agreement referred to herein or otherwise
constituting a Transaction Agreement, is complete, and all promises,
representations, understandings, warranties and agreements with reference to
the subject matter hereof, and all inducements to the making of this

13.11 _Arbitration_.

(a) Except as provided in _Article 12_ , any dispute, claim or controversy
arising out of or relating to this Agreement or the Transaction Agreements or
the breach, termination, enforcement, interpretation or validity hereof or
thereof, including any request for specific performance, claim based on
contract, tort, statute or constitution or the determination of the scope or
applicability of this agreement to arbitrate, will be determined by

will be administered by Judicial Arbitration and Mediation Services pursuant
to its Comprehensive Arbitration Rules and Procedures, as modified in this
Section. 

(b) The arbitrator will have the power to order hearings and meetings to be
held in such place or places as he or she deems in the interests of reducing
the total cost to the Parties of the arbitration. The arbitration proceedings
will be conducted in English.

(c) The arbitrator will have the power to order any remedy, including monetary

relief. The arbitrator may hear and rule on dispositive motions as part of
the arbitration proceeding (e.g., motions for summary disposition).

(d) Each Party will be entitled to the timely production by the other Party
of relevant, non-privileged documents or copies thereof. If the Parties are
unable to agree on the scope and/or timing of such document production, the

appropriate orders for the production of documents by any Party.

 



-64-  (e) Before the arbitrator establishes the facts of the case, each Party will
be entitled to examine witnesses by deposition to provide non-privileged

If the Parties are unable to agree on the propriety, scope or timing of a
deposition, the arbitrator, upon the application of any Party, may make all
appropriate orders in connection with a proposed deposition.

(f) The arbitrator may appoint expert witnesses only with the consent of all
of the parties to the arbitration.

will be paid equally by the Parties. Each party to the arbitration will pay
its own costs and expenses (including attorneys fees) in connection with the
arbitration.

 

(h) The award rendered by the arbitrator will be executory, final and binding
on the Parties. The award rendered by the arbitrator may be entered into any
court having jurisdiction, or application may be made to such court for
judicial acceptance of the award and an order of enforcement, as the case may
be. Such court proceeding will disclose only the minimum amount of
information concerning the arbitration as is required to obtain such
acceptance or order.

(i) Except as required by law, neither Party may disclose the existence,
contents or results of an arbitration brought in accordance with this
Agreement, or the evidence produced by its opposing parties, or any analyses
or summaries derived from such evidence.

 

(j) Each Party hereby agrees that in connection with any such action process
may be served in the same manner as notices may be delivered under _Section
13.1_ and irrevocably waives any defenses it may have to service in such
manner.

(k) Each Party hereby agrees that this Agreement does not preclude parties
from seeking provisional remedies in aid of arbitration from (1) the Federal
or state courts located in Santa Clara County, California; or (2) the United
States District Court for the Northern District of California. For the
purposes of this subparagraph, each of the Parties consents to submit itself
to the personal jurisdiction of the courts described in the first sentence of
this paragraph, agrees that it will not attempt to deny or defeat such
personal jurisdiction by motion or other application, agrees that it will not
bring any Action relating to this Agreement or any of the Transactions in any
other court, agrees that it will not assert as a defense that such Action may
not be brought or is not maintainable in said courts or that the venue thereof
may not be appropriate or that this Agreement or the Transaction Agreements
may not be enforced in or by such courts, and agrees that mailing of process
or other papers in connection with any such Actions in the manner provided in
_Section 13.1_ or in such other manner as may be permitted by Law will be
valid and sufficient service thereof.

 

13.12 _WAIVER OF JURY TRIAL_. EACH OF THE PARTIES HERETO HEREBY IRREVOCABLY
WAIVES ALL RIGHT TO TRIAL BY JURY AND ANY ACTION, PROCEEDING OR COUNTERCLAIM
(WHETHER BASED ON CONTRACT, TORT, OR OTHERWISE) ARISING OUT OF OR RELATING TO
THIS AGREEMENT OR THE ACTIONS OF ANY PARTY HERETO IN NEGOTIATION,
ADMINISTRATION, PERFORMANCE OR ENFORCEMENT HEREOF.

 

13.13 _Counterparts_. This Agreement and any signed agreement or instrument
entered into in connection with this Agreement, and any amendments hereto or
thereto, may be executed in two or more counterparts and by the different
Parties hereto on separate counterparts, each of which when so executed and
delivered shall be an original, but all of which together shall constitute
one and the same instrument.

 



-65-   Any such counterpart, to the extent delivered by means of a fax machine or
by .pdf, .tif, .gif, .jpeg or similar attachment to electronic mail (any such
delivery, an " _Electronic Delivery_ ") shall be treated in all manner and
respects as an original executed counterpart and shall be considered to have
the same binding legal effect as if it were the original signed version
thereof delivered in person. No Party hereto shall raise the use of
Electronic Delivery to deliver a signature or the fact that any signature or
agreement or instrument was transmitted or communicated through the use of
Electronic Delivery as a defense to the formation of a contract, and
each such party forever waives any such defense, except to the extent that
such defense relates to lack of authenticity.

refer to this

 



-12-   Agreement as a whole and not to any particular provision of this Agreement,
and (ii) the words "include," "includes" and "including" shall be deemed in
each case to be followed by the words "without limitation." Unless the
context otherwise requires, "neither," "nor," "any," "either," and "or" shall
not be exclusive.

 

(c) The meaning assigned to each capitalized term defined and used herein
shall be equally applicable to both the singular and the plural forms of such
term, and words denoting any gender shall include all genders. Where a word or
phrase is defined herein, each of its other grammatical forms shall have a
corresponding meaning.

 

(d) When reference is made to any Party to this Agreement or any other
agreement or document, such reference shall include such Partys successors
and permitted assigns.

(e) Unless the context otherwise requires, all references in this
Agreement to the Affiliates of a legal entity shall be deemed to include all
direct and indirect Affiliates of such entity.

(f) A reference to any specific legislation or to any provision of any
legislation shall include any amendment to, and any modification, re-enactment
or successor thereof, any legislative provision substituted therefor and all
rules, regulations and statutory instruments issued thereunder or pursuant

the application of any Law, regulation, holding or rule of construction
providing that ambiguities in an agreement or other document shall be
construed against the Party drafting such agreement or document.

 

Section 8.03 _Amendments and Waivers_. Subject to applicable Law, any
provision of this Agreement may be amended or waived if, but only if, such
amendment or waiver is in writing and is signed, in the case of an amendment,
by each of the Parties, or, in the case of a waiver, by the Party against whom

prejudice such partys rights, powers and remedies. The failure of any of

otherwise, without the consent in writing of the other Party, except that,
without the consent of the other Party, and upon providing written notice
to the other Party, each Party may transfer or assign this Agreement and its
rights and obligations hereunder, in whole or in part, pursuant to a Change of
Control, or in connection with the sale of all or substantially all of any
subsidiary, division, business unit, or product line relating to the subject
matter of this Agreement, whether by merger, sale of assets, sale of stock or

Nothing in this Section 8.4 or this Agreement shall prohibit or otherwise
restrict either Partys ability to sell, assign, or transfer to third parties
any of its Intellectual Property Rights licensed to the other Party hereunder,
provided that any such action shall be subject to the licenses granted to
such other Party pursuant to this Agreement and any permitted sublicenses
granted thereunder. Any purported assignment in breach of this Section 8.4
shall be null and void from the beginning. Subject to the forgoing, this
Agreement shall be binding upon and shall inure to the benefit of the Parties
hereto and their respective successors and permitted assigns.

(b) _Assignment upon Change of Control or Sale of a Party_. If a Party hereto
transfers or assigns its rights and obligations under this Agreement as
expressly set forth in Section 8.4(a), the licenses granted under this

division, business unit, or product line relating to the subject matter of
this Agreement, upon providing written notice of such divestiture to the other

to such Affiliate or business unit under this Agreement, but only
in connection with the products, components and services then offered by such
Divested Entity and any new products, components and services based upon those
then offered by the Divested Entity, provided that the continuing license to
such Divested Entity with respect to such new products, components and
services shall not expand the scope of the licenses granted under this
Agreement and the divesting Party shall not be licensed to provide the
products and services to the extent licensed to the Divested Entity. Further,
no licenses under this Agreement are granted to any existing or separate
products or services of any acquirer of any Divested Entity. Any Intellectual
Property Rights of the Divested Entity to which licenses were granted to the
other Party shall remain subject to such licenses.

(d) _Notice of Assignment of Rights to Memory Controller Patents_. Seller may
assign or transfer its rights and obligations under this Agreement related to
its license to the Memory Controller Patents provided in Section 2.4(a);
provided, however, that Seller agrees to provide Buyer written notice within
thirty (30) days following such assignment or transfer.

 



-14-  Section 8.05 _Severability_. In the event that any one or more of the
provisions of this Agreement is held invalid, illegal or unenforceable in any
respect for any reason in any jurisdiction, the validity, legality and
enforceability of any such provision in every other respect and of the
remaining provisions hereof shall not be in any way impaired or affected (so
long as the economic or legal substance of the Agreement is not affected in
any manner materially adverse to any party), it being intended that each
Parties rights and privileges shall be enforceable to the fullest extent
permitted by applicable law, and any such invalidity, illegality and
unenforceability in any jurisdiction shall not invalidate or render
unenforceable such provision in any other jurisdiction (so long as the
economic or legal substance of the Agreements is not affected in any manner
materially adverse to any party).

to this Agreement, and all other agreements referred to herein, is complete,

making of this Agreement relied upon by all the Parties hereto, have been
expressed herein or in such Schedules, Exhibits or such other agreements and
this Agreement, including such Schedules, Exhibits and such other agreements,

the Parties, written or oral, to the extent that they related in any way to
the subject matter hereof.

Affiliates licensed hereunder as a Buyer, PMC-Sierra, Inc. shall be the
designated recipient of any communications between the Parties and PMC-Sierra
US, Inc. shall be responsible for the compliance of each of its Affiliates
with the terms and conditions of this Agreement.

 

Section 8.08 _Governing Law_. This Agreement, including the validity hereof
and the rights and obligations of the Parties hereunder, shall be construed
in accordance with and governed by the Laws of the State of California
applicable to contracts made and to be performed entirely in such state
without giving effect to the conflicts of Laws principles thereof. 

Section 8.09 _Entire Agreement._ This Agreement is complete with respect to
its subject matter and supersedes any prior understandings, agreements or
representations by or among the Parties, written or oral, with respect to the
subject matter hereof.

Section 8.10 _Bankruptcy Treatment of Licenses_. All license rights granted
under this Agreement are and shall be deemed to be, for purposes of Section
365(n) of the U.S. Bankruptcy Code, licenses of rights to "intellectual
property" as defined in the Bankruptcy Code. The licensee of such rights shall
retain and may fully exercise all of its rights and elections under the U.S.
Bankruptcy Code. Nothing herein shall be deemed to constitute a present
exercise of such rights and elections.

Section 8.11 _Counterparts._ This Agreement and any signed agreement or
instrument entered into in connection with this Agreement, and any amendments
hereto or thereto, may be executed in two or more counterparts and by the
different Parties hereto on separate counterparts, each of which when
so executed and delivered shall be an original, but all of which together
shall constitute one and the same instrument. Any such counterpart, to the
extent delivered by means of a fax machine or by .pdf, .tif, .gif, .jpeg or
similar attachment to electronic mail (any such delivery, an

 



-15-   " _Electronic Delivery_ ") shall be treated in all manner and respects as an
original executed counterpart and shall be considered to have the same binding
legal effect as if it were the original signed version thereof delivered in
person. No Party hereto shall raise the use of Electronic Delivery to deliver
a signature or the fact that any signature or agreement or instrument was
transmitted or communicated through the use of Electronic Delivery as a
defense to the formation of a contract, and each such party forever waives any
such defense, except to the extent that such defense relates to lack of
authenticity.

 



-16-  IN WITNESS WHEREOF, Seller and Buyer have caused this Agreement to be executed
as of the Effective Date by duly authorized persons.

3\. _Transition Services._

 

(a) _Provision of Transition Services_.

(i) In order to facilitate the prompt and orderly transfer of the Business to
Buyer, Seller will perform the services and take the actions described on
_Exhibit A_ attached hereto and any services that are incidental or
reasonably related thereto but not specifically described therein (the "
_Buyer Transition Services_ ") to at least a standard, degree and level of
care, skill, diligence, and service that is not less than that at which such
services were provided by Seller to the Business or with respect to the
Transferred PCIe Assets during the twelve (12) month period prior to the
Effective Date, but under no circumstances shall be less than commercially

(c) _Third Party Providers_.

 

(i) If Buyer determines that it is necessary or advisable to engage one or
more third parties to provide any Buyer Transition Service or Additional
Buyer Transition Service (any such third party, a " _Third Party Provider_ "),
then Seller shall cooperate as reasonably necessary with such Third Party
Provider in order to enable such Third Party Provider to provide such Buyer

practicable following receipt of any such notice, Buyer will advise Seller
whether the termination of such Seller Transition Service will require the
termination or partial termination of, or otherwise affect the provision of,
other Seller Transition Services provided to Seller. If either of the
foregoing occurs, then Seller may withdraw its termination notice within ten
(10) days after receipt of such notice from Buyer. If Seller does not withdraw
the termination notice within such period, such termination will be final.
Upon such termination, Buyers obligation to provide such Seller Transition
Service hereunder will terminate. Seller shall be entitled to a prorated
refund of any fee payable with respect to such Seller Transition Service as a
result of such termination.

orderly transition of the Transition Services and any Additional Buyer
Transition Services, and Seller shall deliver to Buyer copies of such
