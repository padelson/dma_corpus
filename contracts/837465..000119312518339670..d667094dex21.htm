directorsÂ’ and officersÂ’ liability insurance policies maintained by the Group
Companies as at the date of this Agreement.

The Purchaser shall procure (and shall procure that each Group Company shall),

obligations and liabilities arising out of any Pre-Closing Event which any
Group Company or the Purchaser or any member of the PurchaserÂ’s Group has or
may at any time have had against the Seller, each member of the SellerÂ’s
Group or any of its directors, officers, employees or agents except in the
case of fraud. Nothing in this Clause 8.3.2 shall limit the liability of the
Seller set out in this Agreement or any of the other Transaction Documents or
the ability of the Purchaser to bring any claim against any adviser to the
Seller or a Group Company, to the extent such adviser has prepared a report or

otherwise.

Waiver

action, orders, obligations and liabilities that it or they have or may at any
time have or have had against any Group Company, the Guarantor, the Purchaser,
any of their respective Affiliates or any of their or their AffiliatesÂ’

be true and accurate at Closing as if they had been repeated at Closing and
on the basis that any express or implied reference in any such Warranty to the
date of this Agreement shall be considered a reference to the Closing Date;
provided that the Seller may, prior to the Closing Date, give notice to the
Purchaser of any matter, fact, event or circumstance which has arisen or
become known after the date of signing this Agreement and which would
otherwise qualify the Warranties given as at the Closing Date without
prejudice to the ability of the Purchaser to make a Warranty Claim. 

---|---|--- 



     | 9.1.3 |

The liability of the Seller under the Warranties and any other provision of
this Agreement shall be subject to the limitations and other provisions set

Save in the case of fraud by the Seller in the making thereof and except in
relation to the Fundamental Warranties, the PurchaserÂ’s sole recourse in
respect of any Warranty Claim is against the WandI Insurance Policy. If there is
any conflict or other inconsistency between this Clause 9.1.4 and any other
provision of this Agreement or any other Transaction Document, this Clause
9.1.4 prevails. 

---|---|--- 



     | 9.1.5 |

The WandI Insurance Policy shall expressly provide that the insurer shall have
no rights via subrogation against the Seller, save in respect of the SellerÂ’s
fraud in the making of the Warranties.

Affiliates and each of the foregoing personÂ’s advisors that:

forthwith upon demand unconditionally perform (or procure performance of) and

It is the common understanding of the parties that the sale of the Shares is
not subject to VAT. The Seller undertakes not to exercise any option under
applicable VAT law to subject any services or supplies under or pursuant to

ensure that any service or supply under or pursuant to this Agreement will
not be subject to VAT or reduce any VAT assessed. 

---|---|--- 



     | 13.10.3 |

If contrary to the above understanding any payment under this Agreement
constitutes the consideration for a taxable supply for VAT purposes, then:
(a) the recipient shall provide to the payor a valid VAT invoice; and (b)

provision of a valid VAT invoice in accordance with (a)), in addition to that

Interest

If any party defaults in the payment when due of any sum payable under this

Grossing-up 

---|--- 
 



     | 13.12.1 |

All sums payable under this Agreement shall be paid free and clear of all
deductions or withholdings for or on account of Tax ("Tax Deduction"), save
only as may be required by law. 

---|---|--- 



     | 13.12.2 |

Subject to clause 13.12.3, if a Tax Deduction is required by law to be made by
a party in respect of a payment to another party, the amount of the payment
due from that party will be increased to an amount which (after making the
required Tax Deduction) leaves an amount equal to the payment which would have
been due if no Tax  

---|---|--- 
 



38

         |  Deduction had been required, provided that this clause 13.12.2
shall not apply to any sum payable by the Purchaser in respect of the Purchase
Price. 
---|--- 
 



     | 13.12.3 |

If a Tax Deduction is required by law to be made by the Purchaser from the
Purchase Price or any part thereof as a result of the Tax residency of the
Purchaser (excluding a Purchaser Tax resident in Germany), the amount of the
payment in respect of the Purchase Price or any part thereof will be increased
to an amount which (after making the required Tax Deduction) leaves an amount
equal to the payment which would have been due if no Tax Deduction had been
required. 

---|---|--- 



     | 13.12.4 |

Where any payment is made pursuant to a warranty, indemnity or covenant under
this Agreement and that sum is subject to Tax in the hands of the recipient,
the sum payable shall be increased to such sum as will ensure that after
payment of such Tax the recipient shall be left with a sum equal to the sum
that it would have received in the absence of such charge to Tax. For the
avoidance of doubt, this paragraph shall not apply with respect to the payment
of the Purchase Price or the OpCo Facilities Repayment Amount or any other
payment made by the Purchaser or a Group Company pursuant to Clauses 6.3.2 or
7 or with respect to any MIP Entitlement. 

---|---|--- 



     | 13.12.5 |

The Purchaser shall consult with the Seller in good faith on its determination
of whether it has any legal obligation to withhold or deduct any amounts from
the Purchase Price in respect of Taxes imposed by the PeopleÂ’s Republic of
China ("PRC") and have reasonable regard to the submissions made by the Seller
in respect of such Taxes. 

---|---|--- 



     | 13.12.6 |

The Seller shall be entitled to, subject to the PurchaserÂ’s approval of the
Submission Documents (not to be unreasonably withheld or delayed), make the
Submission to the Taxation Authority in the PRC responsible for the imposition
of China Corporate Income Tax on indirect transfers of shares in PRC-
incorporated entities under the Public Notice [2015] No. 7 issued by the
State Administration of Taxation in the PRC ("PN7"), as mutually agreed
between the parties to be the bureau that the Submission will be made to (the
"PRC PN7 Taxation Bureau"). In the event the PRC PN7 Taxation Bureau finally
determines and assesses the Transaction as taxable in accordance with PN7, the
Seller shall prepare (or shall procure that the relevant Group Company
prepares) the relevant Tax Filings, shall provide the Purchaser with a draft
of the Tax Filings for the PurchaserÂ’s approval (not to be unreasonably
withheld or delayed) and pay the applicable Tax assessed by the Tax Authority
in accordance with and within the time period prescribed by applicable Tax
laws and instructions from the relevant PRC PN7 Taxation Bureau. The Seller
shall provide the Purchaser with copies of any correspondence with the PRC PN7
Taxation Bureau. For the purposes of this Clause 13.12.6, "Submission" means
the submission of the Submission Documents, "Submission Documents" means the
documents to be submitted to the PRC PN7 Taxation Bureau in relation to the
transactions contemplated herein as part of the PN7 reporting regime and "Tax
Filings" shall mean such filings for PN7 to be made with the PRC PN7 Taxation
Bureau under applicable laws. To the extent the Purchaser is not finally
relieved from the obligation to make any withholding or deduction in respect
of China Corporate Income Tax at least (3) Business Days prior to Closing,
nothing in this Clause 13.12.6 shall restrict the PurchaserÂ’s right to pay the
amount of such withholding or deduction from the Purchase Price, acting
reasonably, to an escrow account to be released within (5) Business Days after
assessment of the PN 7 withholding respectively as to the non-taxability of
the transaction.

[ _Intentionally Omitted_ ]



   4. |

Preparation 

---|--- 



   4.1 |

No later than seventy-five (75) days following Closing the Purchaser shall
deliver to the Seller the Draft Closing Statement setting out each component
of the Closing Statement. 

---|--- 



   4.2 |

In order to enable the Purchaser to prepare and agree the Draft Closing
Statement, the Seller shall keep up-to-date and, subject to reasonable notice,
make available to the Purchaser, the PurchaserÂ’s representatives and to the
PurchaserÂ’s accountants all books and records relating to the Group during
normal office hours and co-operate with them with regard to the preparation,
review and agreement or determination of the Draft Closing Statement. The
Purchaser shall ensure that the Seller and the SellerÂ’s accountants are given
reasonable access upon reasonable advance notice and during normal office
hours to all relevant information (including, without limitation, books and
records and working papers) they may reasonably require to review the Draft
Closing Statement. 

---|--- 



   4.3 |

If the Seller does not within forty-five (45) days of presentation to it of
the Draft Closing Statement pursuant to paragraph 4.3 give notice to the
Purchaser that it disagrees with the Draft Closing Statement or any item
thereof, such notice stating the reasons for the disagreement in reasonable
detail and specifying the adjustments which, in the SellerÂ’s opinion should
be made 

---|--- 
 



55

         |  to the Draft Closing Statement (the "SellerÂ’s Disagreement
Notice"), the Draft Closing Statement shall be final and binding on the
parties for all purposes. If the Seller gives a SellerÂ’s Disagreement Notice
within such 45 day period, the Seller and the Purchaser shall attempt in good
faith to reach agreement in respect of the Draft Closing Statement and, if
they are unable to do so within twenty-one (21) days of such notification, the
Seller or the Purchaser may by notice to the other require that the Draft
Closing Statement be referred to the Reporting Accountants (an
"Appointment Notice"). 
---|--- 



   4.4 |

The Reporting Accountants shall be engaged jointly by the Seller and the
Purchaser on the terms set out in this paragraph 4.6 and otherwise on such
terms as shall be agreed; provided that neither the Seller nor the Purchaser
shall unreasonably (having regard, inter alia, to the provisions of this
paragraph 4.6) refuse its agreement to terms proposed by the Reporting
Accountants or by the other party. If the terms of engagement of the Reporting
Accountants have not been settled within thirty (30) days of their identity
having been determined (or such longer period as the Seller and the
Purchaser may agree) then, unless the Seller or the Purchaser is unreasonably
refusing its agreement to those terms, those accountants shall be deemed never
to have become the Reporting Accountants and new Reporting Accountants shall
be selected in accordance with the provisions of this Agreement. 

---|--- 



   4.5 |

Except to the extent that the Seller and the Purchaser agree otherwise, the
Reporting Accountants shall determine their own procedure but: 

---|--- 



     | 4.5.1 |

apart from procedural matters and as otherwise set out in this Agreement shall
determine only:  

---|---|--- 



     | (a) |

whether any of the arguments for an alteration to the Draft Closing Statement
put forward in the SellerÂ’s Disagreement Notice is correct in whole or in
part; and 

---|---|--- 



     | (b) |

if so, what alterations should be made to the Draft Closing Statement in order
to correct the relevant inaccuracy in it; 

---|---|--- 



     | 4.5.2 |

shall apply the accounting principles, policies, procedures, practices and
estimation techniques set out in paragraphs 2 and 3 of Part 1 of Schedule 3; 

---|---|--- 



     | 4.5.3 |

shall make their determination pursuant to paragraph 4.7.1 above as soon as is
reasonably practicable; and  

---|---|--- 



     | 4.5.4 |

the procedure of the Reporting Accountants shall: 

---|---|--- 
 



     | (a) |

give the Seller and Purchaser a reasonable opportunity to make written
representations to them;  

---|---|--- 



     | (b) |

require that each party supply the other with a copy of any written
representations at the same time as they are made to the Reporting
Accountants; and 

---|---|--- 



     | (c) |

for the avoidance of doubt, the Reporting Accountants shall not be entitled to
determine the scope of their own jurisdiction. 

---|---|--- 



   4.6 |

The Reporting Accountants shall send the Seller and the Purchaser a copy of
their determination pursuant to paragraph 4.7.1 within two (2) months of
their appointment. Such determination shall be made available to the Seller
and the Purchaser in writing. 

---|--- 
 



56

       4.7 |

The Reporting Accountants shall act as experts and not as arbitrators and
their determination of any matter falling within their jurisdiction shall be
final and binding on the Seller and the Purchaser save in the event of
manifest error (when the relevant part of their determination shall be void
and the matter shall be remitted to the Reporting Accountants for
correction). In particular, their determination shall be deemed to be
incorporated into the Draft Closing Statement. 

---|--- 



   4.8 |

The expenses (including VAT) of the Reporting Accountants shall be borne by
the Seller, on the one hand, and the Purchaser, on the other hand, in inverse
proportion to the manner in which such party prevails on the items resolved by
the Reporting Accountants, which proportionate allocation shall be calculated
on an aggregate basis based on the relative euro values of the amounts in
dispute and shall be computed by the Reporting Accountants at the time of
their determination under paragraph 4.7.1. For example, should the items in
dispute total in amount to EUR 1,000 and the Reporting Accountants award EUR
600 in favor of the SellerÂ’s position, 60% of the costs and expenses of the
Reporting Accountants would be borne by the Purchaser and 40% would be borne
by the Seller. 

---|--- 
 



   4.9 |

The Seller and the Purchaser shall co-operate with the Reporting Accountants
and comply with their reasonable requests made in connection with the carrying
out of their duties under this Agreement. In particular, the Purchaser shall
keep up-to-date and, subject to reasonable advance notice, make reasonably
available to the SellerÂ’s representatives, the SellerÂ’s accountants and the
Reporting Accountants all books and records relating to the Group during
normal office hours as the Reporting Accountants may reasonably request during
the period from the appointment of the Reporting Accountants down to the
making of the relevant determination, solely for the purpose of allowing the
Seller to review the information provided in the Draft Closing Statement and
the proceedings of the Reporting Accountants. 

---|--- 
 



   4.10 |

Nothing in this Schedule shall entitle a party or the Reporting Accountants
access to any information or document which is protected by legal
professional or litigation privilege, provided that neither the Seller nor the
Purchaser shall be entitled to refuse to supply such part or parts of
documents as contain only the facts on which the relevant claim or argument
is based. 

---|--- 



   4.11 |

Each party and the Reporting Accountants shall, and shall procure that its
accountants and other advisers shall, keep all information and documents
provided to them pursuant to this paragraph 4 confidential and shall not use
the same for any purpose, except for disclosure or use in connection with the
preparation of the Draft Closing Statement, the proceedings of the Reporting
Accountants or another matter arising out of this Agreement.

survive until finally resolved. 

---|---|--- 



   2. |

Notification of Claims under this Agreement 

---|--- 
 

Notice of Claims against the Seller shall be given by the Purchaser to the
Seller in writing within the time limits specified in paragraph 1 above and
shall specify in reasonable detail the legal and factual basis of the Claim
and (to the extent reasonably ascertainable) set out the PurchaserÂ’s estimate
of the amount of Losses which are, or are to be, the subject of the Claim at
the time such Claim is made (including any Losses which are contingent on the
occurrence of any future event) (it being understood that this estimate shall
not operate to limit the rights of the Purchaser hereunder).

 



   3. |

Commencement of Proceedings 

---|--- 
 

Any Claim notified pursuant to paragraph 1 above shall (if it has not been
previously satisfied, settled or withdrawn) be deemed to be irrevocably

   4. |

Notification of Potential Claims 

---|--- 
 

Without prejudice to the obligations of the Purchaser under paragraph 2 above,
if the Purchaser becomes aware of any fact, matter or circumstance that would

the application of paragraphs 2 and 3 of this Schedule 6, the Purchaser shall
as soon as reasonably practicable give a notice in writing to the Seller
setting out such information as is available to the Purchaser as is reasonably
necessary to enable the Seller to assess the merits of the potential Claim, to
act to preserve evidence and to make such provision as the Seller may
consider necessary. The failure of the Purchaser to give reasonably prompt
notice of any such Claim shall not release, waive or otherwise affect the
SellerÂ’s obligations with respect thereto except to the extent that the Seller
is materially prejudiced as a result of such failure.



   5. |

Limitations on Quantum 

---|--- 
 



   5.1 |

Except in the case of fraud, the SellerÂ’s total aggregate liability to

Policy in order to obtain protection in the event of any breaches of the
Warranties. To the extent that there is any breach of the Warranties, the

fraud specified in paragraphs 5.1 and 5.3 above, the aggregate liability of
the Seller and the SellerÂ’s Group shall be limited to the total amount payable

The Warranties are subject to and deemed qualified by any matter which is
Disclosed (a) in the Disclosure Letter or the Data Room in the case of a
Warranty other than a Fundamental Warranty and (b) in the Disclosure Letter in
the case of a Fundamental Warranty. Accordingly, no breach of Warranties shall
be deemed to have occurred to the extent a matter constituting a breach of
a Warranty has been Disclosed (i) in the Disclosure Letter or in the Data
Room in the case of a Warranty other than a Fundamental Warranty and (ii) in
the Disclosure Letter in the case of a Fundamental Warranty.

 



   7. |

and/or otherwise) from a third party (including a Tax Authority) a sum which
indemnifies or compensates the Purchaser and/or any Group Company (in whole

shall, pay to the Seller as soon as reasonably practicable after receipt an

respect of such Claim to the extent of such recovery. 

---|--- 



   12. |

Conduct of Third Party Claims 

---|--- 
 



   12.1 |

Subject to paragraph 12.1(b), if the matter or circumstance that may give rise
to a Claim is a result of or in connection with a claim by a third party

the Purchaser shall control the Third Party Claim, but shall consult with the

delayed);

     | (ii) |

subject to the Seller indemnifying the Purchaser or other member of the
PurchaserÂ’s Group concerned against all reasonably and properly incurred

that any other members of the PurchaserÂ’s Group shall, take such action as
the Seller may reasonably request to avoid, dispute, deny, defend, resist,
appeal, compromise or contest such Third Party Claim; and 

---|---|--- 
 



     | (iii) |

the Seller shall be entitled at its own expense and in its absolute
discretion, by notice in writing to the Purchaser, to take such action as it
shall deem reasonably necessary to avoid, dispute, deny, defend, resist,
appeal, compromise or contest the Third Party Claim (including making
counterclaims or other claims against third parties) with counsel of its
choice satisfactory to the Purchaser (acting reasonably) in the name of and on
behalf of the Purchaser or other member of the PurchaserÂ’s Group concerned and
to have the conduct of any related proceedings, negotiations or appeals;

out of pocket costs and expenses, all such information and assistance
including reasonable access to premises and personnel, and the right to
examine and copy or photograph any assets, accounts, documents and records, as
the Seller may reasonably request, including instructing such professional or

other member of the PurchaserÂ’s Group concerned but in accordance with the
SellerÂ’s instructions; 

---|---|--- 
 



     | b. |

be entitled to participate in the defence of the Third Party Claim, and to
employ its own professional or legal advisers, provided that the Seller shall
control the conduct of the Third Party Claim and the Purchaser will be

choosing at  

---|---|--- 
 



79

         |  the expense of the Seller if: (1) so requested by the Seller or

between the Purchaser and the Seller that would make such separate
representation advisable; and 
---|--- 



     | (ii) |

the Seller shall: 

---|---|--- 



     | a. |

consult with the Purchaser and take reasonable account of the views of the
Purchaser before taking any action in relation to the Third Party Claim;

of the PurchaserÂ’s Group fails to reasonably consent to a settlement or
compromise, the maximum liability of the Seller shall (without prejudice to
paragraph 12) not exceed the full amount of the proposed settlement or
compromise and the Purchaser or member of the PurchaserÂ’s Group shall be
liable for any damages awarded in excess of the proposed settlement
or compromise and reasonable costs incurred from (and including) the date the
Seller notified the Purchaser of the settlement or compromise. For purposes of
this paragraph 12.1(c)(ii)(c), the parties acknowledge and agree that it would
not be unreasonable for the Purchaser to withhold consent with respect to a
settlement or compromise unless such settlement or compromise, among other
things, (1) consists solely of money (or equivalent) damages, (2) provides for
a complete and unconditional release of the claims that are the subject of
such Claim in favour of the Purchaser or relevant member of the PurchaserÂ’s
Group and (3) does not lead to additional liability or the creation of any
additional financial or other obligation or restriction on the part of the
Purchaser;

indemnify, save as set out in paragraph 12.1(c)(ii)(c), the Purchaser or other

expenses (including legal and professional costs and expenses) that may be
incurred as a result of the Seller assuming conduct of the Third Party Claim. 

---|---|--- 
 



     | (d) |

Notwithstanding paragraphs 12.1(b) to 12.1(c), neither the Purchaser nor any
other member of the PurchaserÂ’s Group shall be required to take any action or
refrain from 

---|---|--- 
 



80

         |  taking any action, if the Purchaser, or other member of the
PurchaserÂ’s Group concerned, reasonably considers such action or omission to
be unduly onerous or materially prejudicial to it or to its business.

Schedule 8

 

Management Incentive Plan



   1. |

Description 

---|--- 



   1.1 |

Certain Group Companies have entered into a management incentive plan dated 5
December 2017 (the "Management Incentive Plan") with certain employees and
other managers (the "MIP Participants") employed or engaged by such Group
Companies (the "MIP Employers"). The MIP Participants will be entitled to
certain payments under the MIP as a result of the Transaction (the aggregate
amount due to the MIP Participants being, the "MIP Entitlement"). 

---|--- 
 



   1.2 |

The Seller has assumed the obligations of the MIP Employers under the
Management Incentive Plan prior to the date hereof by way of assumption
agreements with the MIP Employers and the respective MIP Participants (the
"Assumption Agreements") copies of which have been made available to the
Purchaser. The Seller shall not, and shall procure that none of the MIP
Employers shall, amend the Assumption Agreements without the prior written
consent of the Purchaser. 

---|--- 



   1.3 |

Pursuant to the Assumption Agreements, the MIP Employers shall serve as the
paying agent for the MIP Entitlement and the Seller shall provide to the MIP
Employers the respective gross amounts of the MIP Entitlement plus any
mandatory additional employer contributions (e.g. _Arbeitgeberbeitr age zur
Sozialversicherung_), if applicable, that are payable by the MIP Employer in
connection with the Management Incentive Plan (the "MIP Employer Charges"). 

---|--- 



   2. |

Initial MIP Entitlement and Seller Covenant 

---|--- 
 



   2.1 |

Prior to Closing the Seller shall inform the Purchaser pursuant to Clause
6.4.1 of the amount of any payments which shall be paid upon Closing by the
Purchaser to the MIP Employers pursuant to clause 3.2 (a) of the Assumption
Agreements plus any respective MIP Employer Charges (the "Initial MIP
Entitlement"). 

---|--- 
 



   2.2 |

The Initial MIP Entitlement shall be deducted from the Purchase Price pursuant
to Clause 6.3.1 and the Purchaser shall pay the Initial MIP Entitlement to
the MIP Employers pursuant to Clause 6.3.2. 

---|--- 



   3. |

MIP Shortfall 

---|--- 
 



   3.1 |

If the aggregate amount of the payments received by the MIP Employers or any
other Group Company from or on behalf of the Seller under the Assumption
Agreements with respect to the Management Incentive Plan falls short of the
total amount of the payments (including, for the avoidance of doubt, the MIP
Entitlement, the MIP Employer Charges and any other Taxes) made or to be made
by the MIP Employers or any other Group Company with respect to the Management
Incentive Plan (the "MIP Shortfall"), the Seller covenants to indemnify the
Purchaser or, at the discretion of the Purchaser, a Group Company, for the
amount of the MIP Shortfall within 10 Business Days after the receipt of a
respective notice from the Purchaser. 

---|--- 



   3.2 |

Any claim of the Purchaser pursuant to this Schedule 8 must be made in writing
to the Seller within six (6) months following the acknowledgement by all MIP
Participants of the receipt of all obligations and liabilities owed to the
respective MIP Participant with respect to the MIP Entitlement. 

---|--- 
 



   3.3 |

Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement, the obligations of
the Seller pursuant to this Schedule 8 shall not be subject to the
limitations of liability in Schedule 6 provided always that the SellerÂ’s total
aggregate liability to compensate the Purchaser in respect  

---|--- 
 



88

         |  of all Claims together with any claims pursuant to this
Schedule 8 shall under all circumstances be limited to the amount of the
Purchase Price received by the Seller. 
---|--- 
 



   3.4 |

If any payment is made by the Seller to the Purchaser in respect of any Claim
pursuant to this Schedule 8 or deducted from the Purchase Price, the payment
or any such deduction shall be treated as an adjustment of the consideration
paid by the Purchaser for the Shares and the consideration shall be deemed to
be reduced by the amount of such payment.
