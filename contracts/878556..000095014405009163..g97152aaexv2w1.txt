continue to be governed by the Laws of the State of Delaware.  1.2 Time and
Place of Closing.   The closing of the transactions contemplated hereby (the
"Closing") will take place at 8:00 a.m. on the date that the Effective Time,

through   1   their authorized officers, may mutually agree. The Closing
shall be held at such location as may be mutually agreed upon by the
Parties.  1.3 Effective Time.   The Merger and other transactions
contemplated by this Agreement shall become effective on the date and at the
time the Certificate of Merger reflecting the Merger (the "Certificate of
Merger") shall each become effective with the Secretary of State of the State
of Delaware (the "Effective Time"). Subject to the terms and conditions of
this Agreement, unless otherwise mutually agreed upon in writing by the
authorized officers of each Party, the Parties shall cause the Effective Time
to occur no later than the second Business Day after the satisfaction of the
conditions set forth in ARTICLE 9 of this Agreement (other than (i) those
conditions that are waived by the Party for whose benefit such conditions
exist, and (ii) any such conditions which, by their terms, are not capable of
being satisfied until the Closing, but subject to those conditions).  
ARTICLE 2   TERMS OF MERGER  2.1 Certificate of Incorporation.   The
Certificate of Incorporation of the Company as in effect immediately prior to
the Effective Time shall be the Certificate of Incorporation of the Surviving
Corporation until thereafter amended as provided by Law and such Certificate
of Incorporation.  2.2 Bylaws.   Unless otherwise determined by Parent
prior to the Effective Time, subject to Section 8.12, at the Effective Time,
the Bylaws of the Company shall be amended in the Merger to be identical to
the Bylaws of the Purchaser, as in effect immediately prior to the Effective
Time, and shall be the Bylaws of the Surviving Corporation until thereafter
amended as provided by Law, the Certificate of Incorporation of the Surviving
Corporation and such Bylaws.  2.3 Directors and Officers.   The directors
of Purchaser immediately prior to the Effective Time shall be the initial
directors of the Surviving Corporation, each to hold office in accordance
with the Certificate of Incorporation and Bylaws of the
Surviving Corporation, and the officers of Purchaser immediately prior to the
Effective Time shall be the initial officers of the Surviving Corporation, in
each case until their respective successors are duly elected or appointed and
qualified or until their earlier death, resignation or removal.   ARTICLE
3   MANNER OF CONVERTING SHARES  3.1 Conversion of Company Common
Stock.   At the Effective Time, without any action on the part of the
Parties or the holders of Company Common Stock, the Merger shall be effected
in accordance with the following terms:   (a) Each share of common stock,
par value $0.01 per share, of Purchaser  (the "Purchaser Common Stock")
issued and outstanding immediately prior to  the Effective Time shall be
converted into and exchanged for the right to  receive one share of common
stock of the Surviving Corporation.   (b) Each share of Company Common Stock
issued and outstanding  immediately prior to the Effective Time (excluding
shares cancelled  pursuant to Section 3.3 and Dissenting Shares), together
with the Company  Rights issued pursuant to the Company Rights Agreement (as
such terms are  defined   2    in Section 5.16), shall, subject to the
provisions of Section 3.7, be  converted into and exchanged for the right to
receive (i) $13.00 in cash  (without interest), plus (ii) a number of fully
paid, nonassessable shares  of Parent Common Stock (together with the Parent
Rights associated  therewith) equal to $6.50 divided by the Applicable Price
(the "Exchange  Ratio") ((i) and (ii) collectively, the "Per Share Merger
Consideration");  provided, however, Parent may, at its sole option, adjust
the Per Share  Merger Consideration so that the Per Share Merger
Consideration would  instead, subject to the provisions of Section 3.7,
consist of (A) an amount  (determined by Parent) in cash (without interest)
greater than $13.00 but  less than or equal to the Total Per Share Amount
(the "Adjusted Cash  Amount"), plus (B) a number of fully paid, nonassessable
shares of Parent  Common Stock (together with the Parent Rights associated
therewith) equal  to (1) the amount, if any, by which the Total Per Share
Amount exceeds the  Adjusted Cash Amount, divided by (2) the Applicable Price
(the "Adjusted  Exchange Ratio"). If Parent adjusts the Per Share Merger
Consideration in  accordance with the foregoing proviso, Parent shall deliver
written notice  to the Company and the stockholders of the Company at least
five (5)  Business Days prior to the Company Stockholders\' Meeting (as
hereinafter  defined), which written notice shall set forth the Adjusted Cash
Amount and  the Adjusted Exchange Ratio. It is expressly understood that
Parent may  satisfy such notice obligation with respect to stockholders of
the Company  by issuing a press release in accordance with Parent\'s normal
business  practices. The Exchange Ratio or the Adjusted Exchange Ratio, as 
applicable, shall be rounded to the nearest one-ten thousandths of a
share.  3.2 Certain Adjustments.   If after the date of this Agreement and
at or prior to the Effective Time, the outstanding shares of Parent Common
Stock are changed into a different number of shares by reason of any
reclassification, recapitalization, split-up, stock split, subdivision,
combination or exchange of shares, or any dividend payable in stock or other
securities is declared thereon or rights issued in respect thereof with a
record date within such period, the Exchange Ratio or the Adjusted Exchange
Ratio, as applicable, will be adjusted accordingly, if necessary and without
duplication, to provide to the holders of Company Common Stock the same
economic effect as contemplated by this Agreement.  3.3 Shares Held by the
Company, Parent or Purchaser.   Each share of Company Common Stock held in
the treasury of the Company and each share of Company Common Stock owned by
Purchaser or Parent immediately prior to the Effective Time shall be canceled
without any conversion thereof and no payment or distribution shall be made
with respect thereto.  3.4 Dissenting Stockholders.   (a) Notwithstanding
any provision of this Agreement to the contrary, shares (collectively, the
"Dissenting Shares") of Company Common Stock that are outstanding immediately
prior to the Effective Time and that are held by stockholders of the Company
who have exercised and perfected appraisal rights for such shares of Company
Common Stock in accordance with Section 262 of the DGCL (the "Dissenting
Stockholders") shall not be converted into or represent the right to receive
the Per Share Merger Consideration pursuant to Section 3.1(b). Such
Dissenting Stockholders shall be entitled to receive payment of the appraised
value of such Dissenting Shares in accordance with Section 262 of the DGCL.
All Dissenting Shares held by Dissenting Stockholders who shall have failed
to perfect or who effectively shall have withdrawn or lost their rights to
appraisal of such shares of Company Common Stock under the DGCL
shall thereupon be deemed to have been converted into and to have become
exchangeable for, as of the Effective Time, the right to receive the Per
Share Merger Consideration pursuant to Section 3.1(b), without any interest
thereon, upon surrender of the Certificate or Certificates that formerly
evidenced such shares of Company Common Stock, in the manner provided, and
subject to the conditions of ARTICLE 4.   (b) The Company shall give Parent
(i) prompt notice of any demands for appraisal received by the Company,
withdrawals of such demands, and any other related instruments served
pursuant to the DGCL and received by the Company and (ii) prior to the
Effective Time, the opportunity to participate in all   3   negotiations
and proceedings with respect to demands for appraisal under the DGCL. The
Company shall not, except with the prior written consent of Parent, which
shall not be unreasonably withheld or delayed, make any payment with respect
to any demands for appraisal or offer to settle or settle any
such demands.  3.5 Treatment of Options and Other Equity Awards.   (a)
Between the date of this Agreement and the Effective Time, the Company shall
take all necessary action (which action shall be effective as of
the Effective Time) to terminate, as of the Effective Time, any and all plans
of the Company in which there are outstanding options to acquire Company
Common Stock or under which any such options could be granted and each stock
option agreement granted otherwise than under such plans which shall
themselves constitute separate plans, each as amended through the date of
this Agreement (collectively, the "Company Stock Option Plans"), (ii) cancel,
as of the Effective Time, each outstanding option to purchase shares of
Company Common Stock granted under the Company Stock Option Plans (each, a
"Company Stock Option") that is outstanding and unexercised, whether or not
vested or exercisable, as of such date, and (iii) give effect to the
remaining provisions of this Section 3.5 (in each case, without the creation
of additional liability to the Company or any of its Subsidiaries).   (b)
As of the Effective Time, each holder of a Company Stock Option, whether or
not vested or exercisable, immediately prior to the Effective Time shall be
entitled to receive the Per Share Merger Consideration pursuant to Section
3.1(b) as if such holder was a stockholder of the Company holding a whole
number of shares of Company Common Stock (rounded downward to the
nearest whole share) equal to (i) the product of (X) the total number of
shares of Company Common Stock subject to such Company Stock Option
multiplied by (Y) the excess, if any, of the Total Per Share Amount over the
exercise price per share of such Company Stock Option (rounded to the nearest
cent), divided by (ii) the Total Per Share Amount. No holder of a Company
Stock Option that has an exercise price per share that is equal to or greater
than the Total Per Share Amount shall be entitled to any payment with respect
to such cancelled Company Stock Option before or after the Effective
Time.   (c) As of the Effective Time, each outstanding Company Restricted
Stock Award, the restrictions of which have not lapsed immediately prior to
the Effective Time, shall become fully vested and the holder of the resultant
shares of Company Common Stock thereof shall be entitled to receive the Per
Share Merger Consideration pursuant to Section 3.1(b) for such shares.  
(d) As of the Effective Time, each outstanding unit granted under the Company
Stock Option Plans representing the right to receive shares of Company Common
Stock in the future (each a "Stock Unit") that is outstanding as
of immediately prior to the Effective Time, whether or not vested, shall
become fully vested and the holder of the resultant shares thereof shall be
entitled to receive the Per Share Merger Consideration pursuant to Section
3.1(b) for such shares.   (e) Immediately following the execution and
delivery of this Agreement, the Company\'s 2000 Employee Stock Purchase Plan
(the "ESPP") shall be terminated and, in accordance with the ESPP, any cash
balances then credited to the Participants\' Contribution Accounts (as
defined in the ESPP) shall be distributed as soon as practicable, without
interest.   (f) On or as of the Effective Time, the Company shall cancel or
cause to be canceled, for a payment of not more than $1,740,000, that certain
Warrant Agreement dated December 31, 2003, between the Company and ArcLight
System LLC and the Warrant (the "Warrant Agreement"), to purchase 391,098
shares of Company Common Stock at an exercise price of $26.24 per share
issued to ArcLight System LLC thereunder (the "Warrant").  3.6
Intentionally Omitted.  3.7 No Fractional Shares.   Notwithstanding any
other provision of this Agreement, neither certificates nor scrip for
fractional shares of Parent Common Stock shall be issued in the Merger. Each
holder who otherwise would have been entitled to a fraction of a share of
Parent Common Stock shall receive in lieu thereof cash (without interest) in
an   4   amount determined by multiplying the fractional share interest
to which such holder would otherwise be entitled (after taking into account
all shares of Company Common Stock owned by such holder at the Effective
Time) by the Average Price. No such holder shall be entitled to dividends,
voting rights or any other rights in respect of any fractional share.  
ARTICLE 4   EXCHANGE OF SHARES  4.1 Availability of Consideration.   At
or prior to the Effective Time, Parent shall (i) designate a bank or trust
company to act as exchange agent (which designation shall be subject to the
Company\'s reasonable consent) (the "Exchange Agent") and (ii) deposit,
or shall cause to be deposited, with the Exchange Agent, for the benefit of
the holders of certificates representing Company Common Stock (the
"Company Certificates"), for exchange in accordance with this ARTICLE 4, cash
in an amount sufficient to pay the cash consideration and the aggregate
number of shares of Parent Common Stock due to the stockholders pursuant to
Section 3.1(b) and any cash that may be payable in lieu of any fractional
shares (such cash and certificates for shares of Parent Common Stock,
together with any dividends or distributions with respect thereto, being
hereinafter referred to as the "Exchange Fund"). The cash so deposited shall
be invested by the Exchange Agent as directed by Parent or, after the
Effective Time, the Surviving Corporation; provided that such investments
shall be in obligations of the United States of America. Any net profit
resulting from, or interest or income produced by, such investments will be
payable to Parent.  4.2 Exchange of Shares.   (a) As soon as practicable
after the Effective Time, the Exchange Agent shall mail to each holder of
record of a Company Certificate a form of letter of transmittal (which shall
specify that delivery shall be effected, and risk of loss and title to the
certificates shall pass, only upon delivery of the certificates to the
Exchange Agent) and instructions for use in effecting the surrender of the
Company Certificates in exchange for cash, certificates representing the
shares of Parent Common Stock and cash in lieu of fractional shares of Parent
Common Stock, if any, into which the shares of Company Common Stock
represented by such certificate or certificates shall have been
converted pursuant to this Agreement. Upon proper surrender of a Company
Certificate for exchange and cancellation to the Exchange Agent, together
with a properly completed letter of transmittal, duly executed, the holder of
such Company Certificate shall be entitled to receive in exchange therefor,
(i) a certificate representing that number of shares of Parent Common Stock
to which such former holder of Company Common Stock shall have become
entitled pursuant to Section 3.1(b), (ii) a check representing that amount of
cash to which such former holder of Company Common Stock shall have become
entitled pursuant to Section 3.1(b), and (iii) a check representing the
amount of cash (if any) payable in lieu of fractional shares of Parent Common
Stock, which such former holder has the right to receive in respect of the
Company Certificate surrendered pursuant to the provisions of this ARTICLE 4,
and the Company Certificate so surrendered shall forthwith be cancelled. No
interest will be paid or accrued on the cash payable in respect of Company
Common Stock pursuant to Section 3.1(b) or this ARTICLE 4.   (b) No
dividends or other distributions with a record date after the Effective Time
with respect to Parent Common Stock shall be paid to the holder of any
unsurrendered Company Certificate until the holder thereof shall surrender
such certificate in accordance with this ARTICLE 4. After the surrender of a
Company Certificate in accordance with this ARTICLE 4, the record holder
thereof shall be entitled to receive any such dividends or
other distributions, without any interest thereon, which theretofore had
become payable with respect to shares of Parent Common Stock represented by
such certificate.   (c) If any certificate representing shares of Parent
Common Stock is to be issued in the name of other than the registered holder
of the Company Certificate surrendered in exchange therefor, it shall be a
condition of the issuance thereof that the Company Certificate so surrendered
shall be properly endorsed (or   5   accompanied by an appropriate
instrument of transfer) and otherwise in proper form for transfer, and that
the person requesting such exchange shall pay to the Exchange Agent in
advance any transfer or other taxes required by reason of the issuance of a
certificate representing shares of Parent Common Stock in the name of and
payment of cash to any person other than the registered holder of the Company
Certificate surrendered, or required for any other reason relating to such
holder or requesting person, or shall establish to the
reasonable satisfaction of the Exchange Agent that such tax has been paid or
is not payable.   (d) At or after the Effective Time, there shall be no
transfers on the stock transfer books of the Company of the shares of Company
Common Stock which were issued and outstanding immediately prior to the
Effective Time. If, after the Effective Time, certificates representing such
shares are presented for transfer to the Exchange Agent, they shall be
cancelled and exchanged for certificates representing shares of Parent Common
Stock and payment of cash as provided in this ARTICLE 4.   (e) Any portion
of the Exchange Fund that remains unclaimed by the stockholders of the
Company for six months after the Effective Time shall be paid, at the request
of Parent, to Parent. Any stockholders of Parent who have not theretofore
complied with this ARTICLE 4 shall thereafter look only to Parent for payment
of the shares of Parent Common Stock, cash, cash in lieu of any fractional
shares and unpaid dividends and distributions on the Parent Common Stock
deliverable in respect of each share of Company Common Stock held by such
stockholder at the Effective Time as determined pursuant to this Agreement,
in each case, without any interest thereon. Notwithstanding anything to the
contrary contained herein, none of Parent, the Company, the Exchange Agent or
any other person shall be liable to any former holder of shares of Company
Common Stock for any amount properly delivered to a public official pursuant
to applicable abandoned property, escheat or similar laws.   (f) In the
event any Company Certificate shall have been lost, stolen or destroyed, upon
the making of an affidavit of that fact by the person claiming such Company
Certificate to be lost, stolen or destroyed and, if required by Parent, the
posting by such person of a bond in such amount as Parent may determine is
reasonably necessary as indemnity against any claim that may be made against
it with respect to such Company Certificate, the Exchange Agent will issue in
exchange for such lost, stolen or destroyed Company Certificate the shares of
Parent Common Stock, cash, cash in lieu of fractional shares and unpaid
dividends and distributions deliverable in respect thereof pursuant to this
Agreement.   (g) Parent, Purchaser, the Company, the Surviving Corporation
and the Exchange Agent will each be entitled to deduct and withhold from
the consideration otherwise payable pursuant to this Agreement or the
transactions contemplated hereby to any holder of Company Common Stock,
Company Stock Options, Warrant, Company Restricted Stock Awards or Stock
Units such amounts as such payors are required to deduct and withhold with
respect to the making of such payment under the Code, or any applicable
provision of Tax law. To the extent that such amounts are properly withheld
by such payors, such withheld amounts will be treated for all purposes of
this Agreement as having been paid to the relevant holder in respect of whom
such deduction and withholding were made.   ARTICLE 5   REPRESENTATIONS
AND WARRANTIES OF THE COMPANY   As an inducement to Parent and Purchaser to
enter into this Agreement, the Company hereby represents and warrants to
Parent and Purchaser that:  5.1 Organization and Qualification;

now being conducted. Each of the Company and its Subsidiaries is duly
qualified or licensed as a foreign corporation or limited liability company
to do business, and is in good standing, in each jurisdiction where the
character of the properties owned, leased or operated by it or the nature of
its   6   business makes such qualification or licensing necessary,
except for such failures to be so qualified or licensed and in good standing
that would not be reasonably likely to have a Material Adverse Effect.  
(b) A true and complete list of all the Company\'s Subsidiaries,
together with the jurisdiction of formation of each such Subsidiary and the
percentage of the outstanding equity interests of each such Subsidiary owned
by the Company and each other such Subsidiary is set forth in Section 5.1(b)

Purchaser prior to the execution and delivery of this Agreement. Except as
disclosed in Section 5.1(b) of the Company Disclosure Schedule, neither the
Company nor any of its Subsidiaries owns, directly or indirectly, any equity
or similar interest in, or any interest convertible into or exchangeable or
exercisable for any equity or similar interest in, any corporation, limited
liability company, partnership, joint venture or other business association
or entity.  5.2 Certificate of Incorporation and Bylaws.   The Company has
heretofore furnished to Parent a complete and correct copy of the Certificate
of Incorporation and the Bylaws or equivalent organizational documents, each
as amended to date, of the Company and each of its Subsidiaries. Such
Certificates of Incorporation, Bylaws or equivalent organizational documents
are in full force and effect.  5.3 Capitalization.   (a) The authorized

lien or other encumbrance on any property or asset of the Company or any of
its Subsidiaries pursuant to, any note, bond, mortgage, indenture, contract,
agreement, lease, license, permit, franchise or other instrument or
obligation, except, with respect to clause (iii), for any such conflicts,

transaction (within the meaning of Section 406 of ERISA or Section 4975 of
the Code) with respect to any Plan or Prior Company Plan.   (f) Except as
set forth in Section 5.10(f) of the Company Disclosure Schedule, all

Plan have been made on or before their due dates. All such contributions have
been fully deducted for income tax purposes and no such deduction has been
challenged or disallowed by any Governmental Authority and, to the knowledge
of the Company, no fact or event exists which could reasonably be expected to
give rise to any such challenge or disallowance. The assets of each Plan that

statements of each such Plan.   (g) The Company and its Subsidiaries are in
compliance with the requirements of the Workers Adjustment and Retraining

threatened with respect to any Parent Plan or Prior Parent Plan (other than
routine claims for benefits in the ordinary course) and except as disclosed

that is intended to be qualified under Section 401(a) of the Code has timely
received a favorable determination letter from the IRS covering all of the
provisions applicable to the Parent Plan for which determination letters are
currently available that the Parent Plan is so qualified and each trust
established in connection with any Parent Plan which is intended to be exempt

and no fact or event exists that could reasonably be expected to result in
the revocation of such exemption.   (e) To the knowledge of Parent, there

Plan or Prior Plan.   (f) Except as set forth in Section 5.10(f) of the
Parent Disclosure Schedule, all contributions, premiums or payments required
to be made with respect to any Parent Plan have been made on or before their
due dates. All such contributions have been fully deducted for income tax
purposes and no such deduction has been challenged or disallowed by any
Governmental Authority and, to the knowledge of Parent, no fact or event
exists which could reasonably be expected to give rise to any such challenge
or disallowance. The assets of each Parent Plan that has assets are reported
at their fair market value on the financial statements of each such Parent
Plan.   (g) In addition to the foregoing, with respect to each Parent Plan
listed in Section 6.10(a) of the Parent Disclosure Schedule that is a
Non-U.S. Benefit Plan, which Parent Plans are so identified on Section

contributions to each Non-U.S. Benefit  Plan required by Law or by the terms
of such Non-U.S. Benefit Plan have  been made, or, if applicable, accrued in

of the assets of each funded Non-U.S. Benefit  Plan, the liability of each
insurer for any Non-U.S. Benefit Plan funded  through insurance or the book
reserve established for any Non-U.S. Benefit  Plan, together with any accrued
contributions, is sufficient to procure or  provide for the benefits
determined as if such plan is maintained on any  ongoing basis (actual or
contingent) accrued to the date of this Agreement  with respect to all
current and former participants under such Non-U.S.  Benefit Plan according
to the actuarial assumptions and valuations most  recently used to determine
employer contributions to such Non-U.S. Benefit  Plan, and none of the
Transactions shall cause such assets or insurance  obligations to be less
than such benefit obligations;   (iii) each Non-U.S. Benefit Plan maintained
by Parent or any of its  Subsidiaries required to be registered or approved
has been registered or  approved and has been maintained in good standing
with applicable  regulatory authorities. Each Non-U.S. Benefit Plan is now
and always has  been operated in material compliance with all applicable non-
United States  Laws; and   (iv) each Non-U.S. Benefit Plan which is
contributed to, sponsored or  maintained by Parent or any of its Subsidiaries

defined   27    contribution benefits which are dependent on investment
performance and  does not require specified minimum guaranteed benefits to be
paid.  6.11 Taxes.   (a) Parent and its Subsidiaries have paid all Taxes

the dates indicated and the consolidated results of operations and cash flows
for the periods then ended in accordance with GAAP (subject in the case of
interim financial statements to normal recurring year-end adjustments that
are not material). As of their respective dates, such reports filed with the
SEC will comply in all material respects with the Securities Laws and will
not contain any untrue statement of a material fact or omit to state a
material fact required to be stated therein or necessary in order to make the
statements therein, in light of the circumstances under which they were made,
not misleading. Any financial statements contained in any other reports to
another Governmental Authority shall be prepared in accordance with Laws
applicable to such reports.  7.6 Notes Tender Offer; Discharge of Note
Indenture.   (a) Provided that this Agreement shall not have been terminated
in accordance with Section 10, at the request of Parent, the Company will
commence a tender offer or consent solicitation (collectively, the "Notes
Tender Offer") in respect of the Senior Subordinated Notes, as and at the
time that Parent shall request, with the cooperation of Parent. If commenced,
the Notes Tender Offer shall be in accordance with applicable Law and shall
be solely on the terms and conditions specified by Parent; provided, that the
Notes Tender Offer (and all obligations to make any payments to holders of
all or any portion of Senior Subordinated Notes in connection therewith or to
modify the terms or provisions of any Senior Subordinated Notes) shall be
conditioned upon the consummation of the Transactions, and shall terminate
immediately upon the termination of this Agreement prior to the consummation
thereof. The Company agrees to amend, supplement, consummate and/or
terminate, as applicable, the Notes Tender Offer upon, and only upon, the
written consent of Parent. The Company agrees to use its reasonable efforts
to cooperate with Parent and, subject to the preceding sentence and
applicable Law, to use its reasonable best efforts to consummate the Notes
Tender Offer if so requested by Parent.   (b) If Parent elects to pursue the
Notes Tender Offer, Parent shall prepare, or cause to be prepared, an Offer
to Purchase and Consent Solicitation Statement in connection with the Notes
Tender Offer in form and substance reasonably satisfactory to the Company (as
amended from time to time, the "Notes Offer to Purchase"), together with
related letters of transmittal and similar ancillary agreements relating to
the Notes Tender Offer (such documents, together with all supplements and
amendments thereto, being referred to herein collectively as the "Notes
Tender Offer Documents"). The Company shall provide Parent with a  
33   list of the record holders of the Senior Subordinated Notes, and to
the extent known by the Company, the beneficial owners of the Senior
Subordinated Notes (collectively, the "Noteholders"). The Company shall
provide Parent with any information for inclusion in the Notes Tender Offer
Documents which may be required under applicable Law and which is reasonably
requested by Parent. If at any time prior to the acceptance of Senior
Subordinated Notes pursuant to the Notes Tender Offer, any event should occur
that is required by applicable Law, or otherwise determined by Parent to be
advisable, to be set forth in an amendment of, or a supplement to, the Notes
Tender Offer Documents, Parent will prepare and cause to be disseminated such
amendment or supplement; provided, however, that prior to such dissemination,
Parent shall consult with the Company with respect to such amendment or
supplement and shall afford the Company reasonable opportunity to comment
thereon.   (c) In the event the Notes Tender Offer is not commenced or
otherwise consummated other than for failure to consummate the Transactions,
at the request of Parent, immediately prior to the Effective Time, the
Company will use a portion of the proceeds from the Information Sale to
provide for the redemption of all of the Notes at the price set forth in the
Notes Indenture and the Senior Subordinated Notes in order to discharge and
satisfy the entire obligations under the Notes through the date of redemption
in accordance with Section 401 of the Indenture (the "Redemption").   (d)
Parent shall pay for all expenses of the Company and, to the extent
the Company is responsible therefor, the Noteholders incurred in connection
with the Notes Tender Offer or the Redemption, as applicable.   ARTICLE

the preparation and filing of the Registration Statement and shall furnish
all information concerning it and the holders of its capital stock as Parent
may reasonably request in connection with such action. In connection with the
Joint Proxy Statement/Prospectus that is a part of the Registration

Registration Statement will be made by Parent, and no filing of, or amendment
or supplement to, the Joint Proxy Statement/Prospectus shall be made by
either Parent or the Company (including the filing, furnishing, or mailing of
additional solicitation material), in each case without providing the other

practicable after the effectiveness of the Registration Statement, each of
Parent and the Company shall mail such Joint Proxy Statement/Prospectus to
its respective stockholders. The Parties shall timely and properly make all

employees, or any information relating to the Transactions or the Information
Sale, is discovered by the Company or Parent which should be set forth in an
amendment or supplement to the Registration Statement or the Joint Proxy
Statement/Prospectus, so that either such document would not include any
misstatement of a material fact or omit to state any material fact necessary
to make the statements therein, in light of the circumstances under which
they are made, not misleading, the Party which discovers such information
shall promptly notify the other Parties hereto and an appropriate amendment
or supplement describing such information shall be   34   promptly filed
with the SEC and, to the extent required by Law, disseminated to the
stockholders of the Company and Parent. Parent will advise the Company,

Common Stock for offering or sale in any jurisdiction, of the initiation or
threat of any proceeding for any such purpose, or of the receipt of comments
from the SEC or its staff or of any request by the SEC for the amendment or
supplement of the Registration Statement or for additional information. Each
Party shall supply each other Party copies of (i) all correspondence between

declared effective by the SEC, solely for the purpose of obtaining the
Company Stockholder Approval and shall, subject to the provisions of Section

Stockholder Approval and shall, subject to fiduciary duties under applicable
Law, through its Board of Directors, recommend to its stockholders the
approval of the issuance of Parent Common Stock pursuant to this
Agreement, and shall use all commercially reasonable efforts to obtain Parent
Stockholder Approval.  8.2 Other Offers, Etc.   (a) The Company agrees
that neither it nor any of its Subsidiaries nor any Representative of it or
any such Subsidiary will, directly or indirectly, (i) solicit, initiate or
knowingly encourage (including by way of furnishing nonpublic information),
or take any other action designed to, or that could reasonably be expected

(including, without limitation, any proposal or offer to its stockholders)
for, or that could reasonably be expected to lead to, a Competing Transaction
(as defined below), or (ii) enter into or maintain or continue discussions or
negotiations with any Person for the intended purpose of facilitating such

or otherwise relating to any Competing Transaction (other than a
confidentiality agreement pursuant to the terms and conditions of Section
8.2(b)), or (iv) authorize or permit any Representative of the Company or any
of its Subsidiaries to take any such action. The Company shall notify Parent
as promptly as practicable (and in any event within twenty-four (24) hours)
after the Company receives any bona fide oral or written proposal or offer
for a Competing Transaction, specifying the material terms and conditions
thereof and the identity of the party making such proposal or offer, and
shall furnish to Parent a copy of such proposal or offer (if it is in
writing). The Company shall thereafter keep Parent fully informed on a prompt
basis of the status thereof, including any modifications to the financial or
other material terms of such proposal or offer and shall provide to Parent as
soon as practicable after receipt or delivery thereof, copies of all
correspondence and other written communications received by the Company or
any of its Subsidiaries from any Person, or given by the Company or any of
its Subsidiaries to any Person, that relates to any such proposal or offer
(which shall include correspondence and other communications to or from the
Information Buyer). The Company immediately shall cease and cause to be
terminated, and shall cause its Subsidiaries and its and their respective
Representatives to cease and cause to be terminated, all discussions or
negotiations (whether or not existing as of the date hereof) with any Person
conducted heretofore with respect to a Competing Transaction.
Without limiting the foregoing, it is agreed that any violation of the
restrictions set forth in this Section 8.2(a) by any Representative of the
Company or its   35   Subsidiaries shall be a breach of this Section
8.2(a) by the Company. Notwithstanding the aforementioned, nothing contained
in this Section 8.2 shall prohibit the Company and its Representatives from
taking any action with respect to the negotiation, execution and consummation
of the Information Restructuring in accordance with the terms of the
Information Documents.   (b) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in
this Section 8.2, prior to the time of obtaining the Company Stockholder
Approval, the Company may furnish non-public information to, and enter into
discussions with, a Person who has made an unsolicited, bona fide proposal or
offer for a Competing Transaction, so long as (A) neither the Company nor any
of its Subsidiaries nor any of their Representatives shall have breached any
of the provisions of Section 8.2(a) with respect to such unsolicited, bona
fide proposal or offer and (B) (i) the Board of Directors of the Company has
determined, in its good faith judgment (after consulting with its financial
advisor), that such proposal or offer constitutes or could reasonably be
expected to lead to a Superior Proposal (as defined below), (ii) the Board of
Directors of the Company has determined, in its good faith judgment after
consulting with its outside legal counsel (who may be the Company\'s
regularly engaged outside legal counsel), that, in light of such proposal or
offer, the failure to furnish such information or to enter into discussions
with such Person would be inconsistent with its fiduciary duties under
applicable Law (taking into account the extent to which the
Company solicited, and participated in discussions and negotiations with
respect to, Competing Transactions prior to entering into this Agreement),
(iii) the Company has provided written notice to Parent at least two (2)
business days prior to taking any such action of its intent to furnish
information or enter into discussions with such Person, (iv) the Company has
obtained from such Person an executed confidentiality agreement (unless a
confidentiality agreement already exists) on terms no less favorable to the
Company than those contained in the Confidentiality Agreements (it being
understood that such confidentiality agreement and any related agreements
shall not include any provision calling for any exclusive right to negotiate
with such Person or having the effect of prohibiting the Company from
satisfying its obligations under this Agreement or the Information
Documents), except that such confidentiality agreement may permit such Person
to share Evaluation Material (as defined in the Confidentiality Agreements)
with its Representatives and financing sources, and (v) all information
provided to such Person has been previously provided to Parent or is provided
to Parent prior to or concurrently with the time it is provided to such
Person making such offer or proposal.   (c) Except as set forth in this
Section 8.2(c), neither the Board of Directors of the Company nor any
committee thereof shall withdraw, qualify or modify, or propose publicly to
withdraw, qualify or modify, in a manner adverse to Parent, the approval by
the Board of Directors of the Company or any such committee of this Agreement
or the Merger or the recommendation of the Board of Directors of the Company
to the Company stockholders that they give Company Stockholder Approval (any
of the foregoing being a "Change in the Company Recommendation") or approve
or recommend, or cause or permit the Company to enter into any letter of
intent or other contract, agreement or commitment with respect to, any
Competing Transaction (except for a confidentiality agreement as contemplated
by Section 8.2(b) above) (a "Competing Transaction
Agreement"). Notwithstanding the foregoing, prior to the time of obtaining
Company Stockholder Approval and so long as neither the Company nor its
Subsidiaries nor any of its or their Representatives shall have breached any
of the provisions of Section 8.2(a) with respect to such unsolicited, bona
fide proposal or offer, the Board of Directors of the Company shall be
permitted to (i) not recommend to the stockholders of the Company that they
give the Company Stockholder Approval, (ii) make a Change in the Company
Recommendation, and/or (iii) recommend a Competing Transaction if the Board
of Directors of the Company (or a committee of disinterested directors
thereof) by a majority vote has determined in its good faith judgment, (w)
after consulting with its financial advisor, that such Competing Transaction
constitutes a Superior Proposal, and (x) after consulting with outside legal
counsel (who may be the Company\'s regularly engaged outside legal counsel),
that the failure to make a Change in the Company Recommendation would be
inconsistent with its fiduciary duties under applicable Law (taking into
account the extent to which the Company solicited, and participated
in discussions and negotiations with respect to, Competing Transactions prior
to entering into this Agreement), but only (y) after providing written notice
to Parent at least two business days in advance (a "Notice of Superior
Proposal") advising Parent that the Board of Directors of the Company has
received a proposal or an offer of a Competing Transaction that the Board of
Directors of the Company (or such committee) has determined is a Superior
Proposal (the "Offer"), specifying the material   36   terms and
conditions of such Offer and identifying the Person making such Offer with a
copy thereof and indicating that the Board of Directors of the
Company intends to effect a Change in the Company Recommendation and/or
recommend a Competing Transaction and (z) if Parent does not, prior to two
(2) business days after Parent\'s receipt of the Notice of Superior Proposal,
make an offer that the Board of Directors of the Company determines, in its
good faith judgment (after consulting with its financial advisor) to be at
least as favorable to the Company\'s stockholders as such Offer. Any
disclosure that the Board of Directors of the Company is legally required to
make with respect to the receipt of a proposal or offer for a Competing
Transaction will not constitute a violation of this Agreement.   (d) A
"Competing Transaction" means any of the following (other than
the Transactions): (i) the acquisition by any Person in any manner of a
number of shares of any class of equity securities of the Company equal to or
greater than 15% of the number of such shares outstanding before such
acquisition, (ii) the acquisition by any Person in any manner, directly or
indirectly, of assets (including securities of any Subsidiary) that
constitute 15% or more of the assets of the Company and its Subsidiaries
taken as a whole, or (iii) a merger, consolidation, tender offer, exchange
offer, binding share exchange, joint venture, dissolution, recapitalization,
liquidation, business combination or other similar transaction, or series of
related transactions occurring contemporaneously, involving the Company or
any of its Subsidiaries as a result of which any Person or Persons,
collectively would acquire the assets or securities described in either of
clauses (i) or (ii) above. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Information
Restructuring as set forth in the Information Documents shall not be deemed a
Competing Transaction.   (e) A "Superior Proposal" means an unsolicited
(after the date hereof) written bona fide offer made by a third party with
respect to a Competing Transaction (with all percentages contained in the
definition of "Competing Transaction" increased to 80% for purposes of this
definition), in each case on terms that the Board of Directors of the Company
determines, in its good faith judgment (after consulting with its financial
advisor) and taking into account all legal, financial, regulatory and other
aspects of the offer that it deems relevant (including whether such Competing
Transaction is reasonably capable of being completed taking into account all
financial, legal, regulatory and other aspects of such offer), to be more
favorable to the Company stockholders than the Merger.  8.3 Exchange
Listing.   Parent shall use all commercially reasonable efforts to list,
prior to the Effective Time, on the Nasdaq National Market the shares of
Parent Company Common Stock to be issued to the holders of Company Common
Stock pursuant to the Merger, and Parent shall use all commercially
reasonable efforts to give all notices and make all filings with Nasdaq
required in connection with the transactions contemplated herein.  8.4

the Parties undertake and agree to and to cause their respective "ultimate
parent entities" (as defined in the HSR Act) to file as soon as practicable
notifications under the HSR Act with the United States Federal Trade
Commission (the "FTC") and the Antitrust Division of the United States
Department of Justice (the "Antitrust Division"). Each of the Parties further
agrees to respond as promptly as practicable to any inquiries and/or requests
for information or documents received from any Governmental Authority in
connection with antitrust matters related to the Transactions contemplated
by this Agreement. Neither Parent, Purchaser or the Company shall extend
any waiting period under the HSR Act or enter into any agreement with the FTC
or the Antitrust Division not to consummate the Transactions contemplated by
this Agreement, except with the prior written consent of the other Parties,
which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld or delayed. Parent,
Purchaser or the Company shall, from the date hereof until the Effective
Date, use their respective commercially reasonable efforts to avoid the entry
of, or to have vacated or terminated, any decree, order, or judgment that
would restrain, prevent or delay the consummation of the Transactions.  
(b) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement, (i)
Parent and Purchaser shall not be required to take any actions in connection
with, or agree to, any sale, divestiture or disposition of any  
37   businesses, assets, properties or product lines of Parent, the Company
or their respective Subsidiaries, or the imposition of any material
limitation on the ability of Parent to own or exercise control of the Company
or its Subsidiaries or their respective businesses following the Effective
Time and (ii) the Company shall not be permitted to take any actions in
connection with, or agree to, any divestiture or disposition as a
prerequisite for the FTC\'s or Antitrust Division\'s clearance of the Merger
or the Information Sale.   (c) In case, at any time after the Effective
Time, any further action is necessary or desirable to carry out the purposes
of this Section 8.4, the proper officers and directors of each party to this
Agreement shall use their commercially reasonable efforts to take all such
action.  8.5 Filings with State Offices.   Upon the terms and subject to
the conditions of this Agreement, Parent shall use all commercially
reasonable efforts to execute and file the Certificate of Merger with the
Secretary of State of the State of Delaware in connection with the
Closing.  8.6 Agreement as to Efforts to Consummate.   Subject to the
terms and conditions of this Agreement, except as provided in Section 8.4,
each Party agrees to use, and to cause each of its Subsidiaries to use all
commercially reasonable efforts (a) to take, or cause to be taken, all
actions, and to do, or cause to be done, all things necessary, proper,
or advisable under applicable Laws to consummate and make effective, as soon
as reasonably practicable after the date of this Agreement, the
Transactions, including using its reasonable efforts (i) to obtain all
Permits, consents, approvals, authorizations, qualifications and orders of
Governmental Authorities and parties to contracts with the Company and its
Subsidiaries as are necessary for the consummation of the Transactions and to
fulfill the conditions to the Merger, (ii) to lift or rescind any Order
adversely affecting its ability to consummate the Transactions, and (iii) to
cause to be satisfied the conditions referred to in ARTICLE 9, and (b) to
cause the satisfaction of all conditions to Closing; provided that nothing
herein shall preclude either Party from exercising its rights under this
Agreement.  8.7 Investigation and Confidentiality.   (a) Prior to the
Effective Time, each Party shall use all commercially reasonable efforts to
keep the other Parties promptly advised of all material developments relevant
to its business, the consummation of the Merger and the other Transactions,
and consummation of the Information Restructuring. The Company shall afford
to Parent (and its counsel, financial advisors, auditors and other
Representatives) reasonable access (including for the purpose of coordinating
integration activities and transition planning with employees of the Company
and its Subsidiaries) to the business, properties, personnel, offices, books
and records of the Company and its Subsidiaries and each of their respective
financial, legal and operating conditions as Parent reasonably requests,
provided that such access shall not interfere unreasonably with
normal operations of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries, as the case may
be. Without limiting the foregoing, the Company shall permit Parent\'s
senior officers to meet with the officers of the Company responsible for the
Company\'s financial statements, the internal controls of the Company and the
disclosure controls and procedures of the Company to discuss such matters as
Parent may deem reasonably necessary or appropriate for Parent to satisfy its
obligations under Sections 302 and 906 of Sarbanes-Oxley and any rules and
regulations relating thereto. During the period prior to the Effective Time
(or the termination of this Agreement), the Company shall promptly furnish to
Parent (i) a copy of each report, schedule, registration statement and other
document filed by it during such period pursuant to the requirements of
applicable Federal and state securities Laws and (ii) all other information
concerning the Company\'s and its Subsidiaries\' business, properties, and
personnel as Parent may reasonably request.   (b) In addition to the
Parties\' respective obligations under the Confidentiality Agreements, which
are hereby reaffirmed and adopted, and incorporated by reference herein, each
Party shall, and shall cause its Representatives to, maintain the
confidentiality of all confidential information furnished to it by the other
Party concerning its and its Subsidiaries\' businesses, operations, and
financial positions and shall not use such   38   information for any
purpose except in furtherance of the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement. If this Agreement is terminated prior to the Effective Time, each
Party shall promptly return or certify the destruction of all documents and
copies thereof, and all work papers containing confidential information
received from the other Party.  8.8 Public Announcements.   Parent and the
Company shall each issue an initial press release relating to this Agreement
the text of each of which has been agreed to by each of Parent and the
Company. Thereafter, unless otherwise required by applicable Law or
the requirements of the NYSE or Nasdaq, each of Parent and the Company shall
each use its commercially reasonable efforts to consult with each other
before issuing any press release or otherwise making any public statements
with respect to this Agreement, the Merger or any of the other
Transactions  8.9 State Takeover Laws.   Each of the Parties shall (i)
take all necessary action to ensure that no Takeover Law or similar statute
or regulation is or becomes applicable to this Agreement or the Transactions
and (ii) if any state Takeover Law or similar statute or regulation is or
becomes applicable to this Agreement or the Transactions, take all reasonable
action to ensure that the Transactions may be promptly consummated on the
terms contemplated by this Agreement and otherwise to minimize the effect of,
or challenge the validity or applicability of, any applicable Takeover
Law.  8.10 Intentionally Omitted.  8.11 Employee Benefits Plans.   (a)
From and after the Effective Time and at least until December 31,
2005, employees of the Company and its Subsidiaries shall be offered
participation in employee benefit plans, programs, policies and arrangements
that are no less favorable in the aggregate to those provided under the
applicable employee benefit plans (as defined in Section 3(3) of ERISA
(excluding plans exempt under Section 201(2) of ERISA)), programs, policies
and arrangements of the Company and its Subsidiaries in effect at the
Effective Time (collectively, "Current Plans"); provided, however, that
nothing contained in this Section 8.11(a) shall (i) obligate or commit Parent
or its Subsidiaries to continue any particular Current Plan after the
Effective Time or to maintain in effect any particular Current Plan or any
level or type of benefits, (ii) obligate or commit Parent or its Subsidiaries
to provide any employee of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries with any
equity compensation pursuant to any equity compensation plans, programs or
arrangements sponsored or provided by Parent or any of its Subsidiaries or
Affiliates for the benefit of its employees, or (iii) prohibit Parent or its
Subsidiaries from making any changes to any Current Plans. In the event that
the operation of any severance pay plan or arrangement or any deferred
compensation plan or arrangement of the Company or its Subsidiaries (the
"Deferred Compensation Plans") after the Effective Time and through December
31, 2006 causes an excise tax, interest, and/or penalties under Code Section
409A to be assessed against an individual, Parent will, or will cause the
Company or Subsidiaries to, reimburse the individual for such excise
tax, interest, and/or penalties through a gross up payment to be made no
later than the date the excise tax, interest and/or penalties is due;
provided, however, (A) if the Closing does not occur on or before December
31, 2005 (or such later date as may be provided by subsequent Treasury
guidance prior to December 31, 2005 for the termination of deferral
arrangements without consequence under Code Section 409A) (the later of
December 31, 2005 or such later date being the "409A Deadline"), or (B) if
Parent, the Company or any of their Subsidiaries offers to make a lump sum
payment on or before the 409A Deadline of the aggregate payments due to an
individual pursuant to any such Deferred Compensation Plans and such offer is
not accepted on a timely basis by such individual, then, in either such case,
neither Parent, the Company nor any of their respective Subsidiaries
shall have any liability to such individual for any such gross up payment.
In addition, notwithstanding anything contained in this Agreement to the
contrary, the Company shall have the right prior to Closing to amend the
Deferred Compensation Plans such that payments made under the Deferred
Compensation Plans will be in accordance with Code Section 409A and will not
be subject to an excise tax, interest and/or penalties. Such amendment may
include an amendment to cause currently   39   non-vested amounts to pay
out in a lump sum upon a qualifying separation from service, and such
amendments may, but need not, be made contingent on the consummation of the
Transactions.   (b) Parent will, or will cause the Company and its
Subsidiaries to, credit each employee of the Company and its Subsidiaries as
of the Effective Time with such number of unused vacation days and other paid
time off accrued by each such employee with the Company and its Subsidiaries
prior to the Effective Time in accordance with the Company\'s personnel
policies applicable to such employees on the date hereof, copies of which
have been made available to Parent; provided that Parent may, in its sole
discretion and to the extent permitted by applicable Law, require that such
vacation and other paid time off be taken by each such employee prior to
December 31, 2005.   (c) Employees of the Company and its Subsidiaries shall
receive credit for purposes of eligibility to participate and vesting (but
not for benefit accruals under any plan) under any employee benefit plan,
program or arrangement established or maintained by Parent or any of its
Affiliates for service accrued prior to the Effective Time with the Company
or any of its Subsidiaries under which such employee may be eligible to
participate on or after the Effective Time to the extent such service would
have been recognized by the Company or any such Subsidiary under comparable
plans immediately prior to the Effective Time; provided, however, that such
crediting of service shall not operate to duplicate any benefit or the
funding of any such benefit.   (d) With respect to the welfare benefit
plans, programs and arrangements maintained, sponsored or contributed to by
Parent or its Subsidiaries ("Parent Welfare Benefit Plans") in which an
employee of the Company and its Subsidiaries may be eligible to participate
on or after the Effective Time, Parent shall waive, or cause its insurance
carrier to waive, any limitations on benefits relating to pre-existing
conditions (if any) with respect to participation and coverage requirements
applicable to employees of the Company and its Subsidiaries under Parent
Welfare Benefit Plans to the same extent such limitations are waived under
any comparable plan of Parent or its Subsidiaries; provided, however, that
such pre-existing condition limitations shall not be waived with respect to
life insurance and disability benefits provided under the Parent Plans or
with respect to Parent Plans that are group health plans if the employee (or
the employee\'s dependent) has not been covered under a group health plan for
at least one year prior to the Effective Time.  8.12 Indemnification;
Insurance.   (a) The Bylaws of the Surviving Corporation shall contain
provisions no less favorable with respect to indemnification than are set
forth in Article VII of the Bylaws of the Company, which provisions shall not
be amended, repealed or otherwise modified for a period of six years from the
Effective Time in any manner that would affect adversely the rights
thereunder of individuals who, at or prior to the Effective Time, were
directors, officers, employees, fiduciaries or agents of the Company
(collectively, "Indemnified Directors/ Officers"), unless such modification
shall be required by Law. Parent hereby unconditionally guarantees the
obligations of the Surviving Corporation under this Section 8.12(a).   (b)
As of or prior to the Effective Time, Parent shall obtain prepaid (or "tail")
directors\' and officers\' liability insurance providing for coverage
with respect to matters occurring prior to the Effective Time for six years
from the Effective Time, which coverage amount shall be the same as, and
which shall contain terms and conditions that are not materially less
favorable than, the current directors\' and officers\' liability insurance
policies maintained by the Company.   (c) In the event Parent or the
Surviving Corporation or any of their respective successors or assigns (i)
consolidates with or merges into any other Person and shall not be the
continuing or surviving corporation or entity of such consolidation or merger
or (ii) transfers all or substantially all of its properties and assets to
any Person, then, and in each such case, proper provision shall be made so
that the successors and assigns of Parent or the Surviving Corporation, as
the case may be, shall assume the obligations set forth in this Section
8.12.   The provisions of this Section 8.12 are intended to be for the
benefit of and shall be enforceable by, each Indemnified Director/Officer and
their respective heirs and representatives.   40   8.13 Sale of HIS.

the Information Documents without the prior written consent of Parent.

Company shall, and shall cause HIS to, comply with each of their respective
obligations under the Information Documents. The Company agrees to give
written notice promptly to Parent upon becoming aware of any fact, or
the occurrence or impending occurrence of any event or circumstance, which
(i) represents, or is reasonably likely to represent, either a material
breach of any representation, warranty, covenant or agreement of the Company
or the Information Buyer under the Information Documents, or (ii) results, or
is reasonably likely to result, in any of the conditions to the consummation
of the transactions contemplated by the Information Documents not being
satisfied.  8.14 Company Affiliates.   No later than five (5) days prior
to the Closing Date, the Company shall deliver to Parent a list of names and
addresses of those persons who were, in the Company\'s reasonable judgment,
on date of the Company Stockholders\' Meeting, "affiliates" (within the
meaning of Rule 145 of the rules and regulations promulgated under the
Securities Act (each such person being a "Company Affiliate")) of the
Company. The Company shall provide Parent with such information and documents
as Parent shall reasonably request for purposes of reviewing such list. Prior
the Closing Date, the Company shall use its commercially reasonable efforts
to deliver or cause to be delivered to Parent from each Company Affiliate an
affiliate letter substantially in the form attached hereto as Exhibit
A.  8.15 Stockholder Litigation.   Except to the extent that the
provisions of any insurance policies relevant thereto prohibit or limit the
Company from doing so, the Company shall give Parent the reasonable
opportunity to participate in the defense or settlement of any stockholder
Litigation against the Company and/or its directors relating to the Merger or
the other Transactions, and no such settlement shall be agreed to by the
Company without Parent\'s prior written consent, which consent shall not be
unreasonably withheld or delayed.  8.16 Letters of the Company\'s
Accountants.   The Company shall use its commercially reasonable efforts to
cause to be delivered to Parent two letters from the Company\'s independent
accountants, one dated a date within two Business Days before the date on
which the Registration Statement will become effective and one dated a date
within two Business Days before the Closing Date, each addressed to Parent,
in form and substance reasonably satisfactory to Parent and customary in
scope and substance for comfort letters delivered by independent public
accountants in connection with registration statements similar to the
Registration Statement.  8.17 Exemption for Liability Under Section
16(b).   Provided that Company delivers to Parent the Section 16 Information
in a timely fashion, the Board of Directors of Parent, or a committee of Non-
Employee Directors thereof (as such term is defined for purposes of Rule

receipt by Company Insiders of Parent Common Stock in exchange for shares of
Company Common Stock pursuant to the   41   Transactions contemplated

following the date hereof (the "Outside Date");  provided, however, that the
right to terminate this Agreement under this  Section 10.1(b) shall not be

or   (c) by either Parent or the Company if any Governmental Authority
shall  have enacted, issued, promulgated, enforced or entered any permanent

effect of making consummation of the Merger illegal or otherwise preventing 
or prohibiting consummation of the Merger and such injunction, order,  decree
or ruling shall have become final and non-appealable; provided,  however,
that the right to terminate this Agreement under this Section  10.1(c) shall

Capers, Jr.   11.9 Governing Law; Venue; Waiver of Jury Trial.  
Regardless of any conflict of law or choice of law principles that
might otherwise apply, the Parties agree that this Agreement shall be
governed by and construed in all respects in accordance with the laws of the
State of Delaware. The Parties all expressly agree and acknowledge that the
State of Delaware has a reasonable relationship to the Parties and/or this
Agreement. The Parties hereby irrevocably submit to the jurisdiction of the
courts of the State of Delaware and the Federal courts of the United States
of America located in the State of Delaware solely in respect of the
interpretation and enforcement of the provisions of this Agreement and of the
documents referred to in this Agreement, and in respect of the Transactions,
and hereby waive, and agree not to assert, as a defense in any Litigation for
the interpretation or enforcement of this Agreement or of any such document,
that it is not subject thereto or that such Litigation may not be brought or
is not maintainable in said courts or that the venue thereof may not be
appropriate or that this Agreement or any such document may not be enforced
in or by such courts, and the Parties hereto irrevocably agree that all
claims with respect to such Litigation shall be heard and determined in such
a Delaware State or Federal court. The Parties hereby consent to and grant
any such court jurisdiction over such Parties solely for such purpose and
over the subject matter of such dispute and agree that mailing of process or
other papers in connection with any such Litigation in the manner provided in
this Section 11.9 or in such other manner as may be permitted by Law shall be
valid and sufficient service thereof. Each Party acknowledges and agrees that
any controversy which may arise under this Agreement is likely to involve
complicated and difficult issues, and therefore each such Party
hereby irrevocably and unconditionally waives any right such Party may have
to a trial by jury in respect of any Litigation directly or indirectly
arising out of or relating to this Agreement, or the Transactions. Each Party
certifies and acknowledges that (i) no Representative of any other Party has
represented, expressly or otherwise, that such other Party would not, in the
event of Litigation, seek to enforce the foregoing waiver, (ii) each Party
understands and has considered the implications of this waiver, (iii) each
Party makes this waiver voluntarily, and (iv) each Party has been induced to
enter into this Agreement by, among other things, the mutual waivers and
certifications in this Section 11.9.  11.10 Counterparts.   This
Agreement may be executed in two or more counterparts, each of which shall be
deemed to be an original, but all of which together shall constitute one and
the same instrument.  11.11 Captions; Articles and Sections.   The
captions contained in this Agreement are for reference purposes only and are
not part of this Agreement. Unless otherwise indicated, all references to
particular Articles or Sections shall mean and refer to the
referenced Articles and Sections of this Agreement.  11.12
Interpretations.   Neither this Agreement nor any uncertainty or ambiguity
herein shall be construed or resolved against any Party, whether under any
rule of construction or otherwise. No Party to this Agreement shall be
considered the draftsman. The Parties acknowledge and agree that this
Agreement has been reviewed,   54   negotiated, and accepted by all
Parties and their attorneys and shall be construed and interpreted according
to the ordinary meaning of the words used so as fairly to accomplish the
purposes and intentions of all Parties hereto.  11.13 Enforcement of
Agreement.   The Parties hereto agree that irreparable damage would occur in
the event that any of the provisions of this Agreement was not performed in
accordance with its specific terms or was otherwise breached. It is
accordingly agreed that the Parties shall be entitled to an injunction or
injunctions to prevent breaches of this Agreement and to enforce specifically
the terms and provisions of this Agreement in any court of the United States
or any state having jurisdiction, this being in addition to any other remedy
to which they are entitled at law or in equity.  11.14 Severability.  
Any term or provision of this Agreement which is invalid or unenforceable in
any jurisdiction shall, as to that jurisdiction, be ineffective to the
extent of such invalidity or unenforceability without rendering invalid
or unenforceable the remaining terms and provisions of this Agreement or
affecting the validity or enforceability of any of the terms or provisions of
this Agreement in any other jurisdiction. If any provision of this Agreement
is so broad as to be unenforceable, the provision shall be interpreted to be
only so broad as is enforceable.   [SIGNATURES ON NEXT PAGE]   55
