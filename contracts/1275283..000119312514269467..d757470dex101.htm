Purchase_ "), the aggregate amount of which shall be referred to herein as the
" _Purchase Price_."

and clear of any Liens, against delivery by Parent to BAT (or the Designated
Subsidiaries) by electronic book-entry at The Depository Trust Company,

effect.

(ii) Parent breaches or fails to perform any of its covenants or agreements
contained in this Agreement (other than those contained in Section 5.02 or

The party desiring to terminate this Agreement pursuant to clause (b) or (c)
of this Section 7.01 will give written notice of such termination to the
other party in accordance with Section 8.02, specifying the provision of this
Agreement pursuant to which such termination is effected. Parent and BAT shall
deliver any such notice, in addition to any other notice delivered under
this Agreement, to the Company pursuant to the procedures specified in
Section 9.02 of the Merger Agreement.

SECTION 7.02. _BAT Expenses_. (a) In the event that the Merger Agreement or
the Asset Purchase Agreement has been terminated and Parent receives a Company
Termination Fee or Imperial Termination Fee (as defined in the Asset Purchase
Agreement), as applicable, Parent shall promptly, but in no event later than
three Business Days after receipt of such Company Termination Fee or Imperial
Termination Fee, as applicable, and written documentation, reasonably
satisfactory to Parent, of BATs reasonable out-of-pocket costs and expenses,
pay at the direction of BAT (i) in the case of the Company Termination Fee,
the lesser of (A) all of the reasonable out-of-pocket costs and expenses
(including reasonable attorneys fees and expenses) incurred by BAT in
connection with the Transactions and (B) $30,000,000, and (ii) in the case of
the Imperial Termination Fee, the lesser of (A) all of the reasonable out-of-

(b) Parent and BAT acknowledge and agree that the agreements contained in
Section 7.02(a) are an integral part of the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement, and accordingly, if Parent fails promptly (subject to BATs
provision of written documentation as provided in Section 7.02(a)) to pay the
amounts due pursuant to Section 7.02(a) and, in order to obtain such payment,
BAT commences an Action that results in a Judgment in its favor for such
payment, then Parent will pay to BAT such payment and BATs reasonable out-
of-pocket costs and expenses (including reasonable attorneys fees and
expenses) in connection with such Action, together with interest on the amount
of such payment from the date such payment was required to be made hereunder
until the date of payment at the prime rate in effect on the date such payment
was required to be made.

not restricted by Article IV of the Governance Agreement and the New Shares

Governance Agreement and BAT has the right to cause the registration of such
New Shares subject to conditions set forth in Article III of the Governance

14 SECTION 8.03. _Amendment_. Subject to Section 8.11, this Agreement may be
amended, modified or waived only by a written instrument signed by Parent and
BAT.

SECTION 8.04. _Extension; Waiver_. At any time prior to the Closing, either
party may (a) extend the time for the performance of any of the obligations or
other acts of the other party, (b) waive any inaccuracies in the
representations and warranties of the other party contained in this Agreement
or in any document delivered pursuant to this Agreement, (c) waive compliance
with any covenants and agreements of the other party contained in this
Agreement or (d) waive the satisfaction of any of the conditions to
the obligations of the other party contained in this Agreement. Any agreement
on the part of a party to any such extension or waiver will be valid only if
set forth in an instrument in writing signed on behalf of such party. The
failure of any party to this Agreement to assert any of its rights under this
Agreement or otherwise will not constitute a waiver of such rights.

SECTION 8.05.  _Assignment_. Neither this Agreement nor any of the rights,
interests or obligations under this Agreement will be assigned, in whole or in
part, by operation of Law or otherwise by any of the parties without the prior
written consent of the other parties; _provided_ , that BAT may assign its
rights and obligations pursuant to this Agreement to any of its Subsidiaries
so long as BAT continues to remain primarily liable for all of such rights and
obligations as if no such assignment had occurred. Any purported assignment
that does not comport with the foregoing sentence will be void. Subject to the
preceding sentences, this Agreement will be binding upon, inure to the benefit
of, and be enforceable by, the parties and their respective successors and
assigns.

SECTION 8.06. _Fees and Expenses_. Subject to Section 7.02, each party shall
bear its own fees and expenses and the expenses of its counsel in connection
with the transactions contemplated by this Agreement.

SECTION 8.07.  _Counterparts_. This Agreement may be executed in one or more
counterparts, all of which will be considered one and the same agreement, and
will become effective when one or more counterparts have been signed by each
party and delivered to the other party.

SECTION 8.08. _Severability_. If any term or other provision of this Agreement
is invalid, illegal or incapable of being enforced by any applicable rule or

 



15  Law, or public policy, all other conditions and provisions of this Agreement
will nevertheless remain in full force and effect so long as either the
economic or legal substance of the transactions contemplated hereby is not
affected in any manner materially adverse to any party or such party waives
its rights under this Section 8.08 with respect thereto. Upon such
determination that any term or other provision (or part thereof) is so
invalid, illegal or incapable of being enforced, the parties will negotiate in
good faith to modify this Agreement so as to effect the original intent of the
parties as closely as possible in an acceptable manner to the end that
the transactions contemplated hereby are fulfilled to the extent possible.

SECTION 8.09. _Governing Law; Consent to Jurisdiction; Venue_.

(a) This Agreement will be governed by and construed in accordance with the
laws of the State of Delaware, without giving effect to any choice or
conflicts of laws principles (whether of the State of Delaware or any other
jurisdiction) that would cause the application of the Laws of any jurisdiction
other than the State of Delaware; _provided_ , _however_ , that the Share
Issuance (to the extent required by the Laws of the State of North Carolina to
be governed thereby) and matters relating to the conduct of directors of
Parent, will be governed by, and construed in accordance with, the Laws of
the State of North Carolina, without giving effect to any choice or conflicts
of laws principles (whether of the State of North Carolina or any other
jurisdiction) that would cause the application of the Laws of any jurisdiction
other than the State of North Carolina.

(b) Each party hereby (i) expressly and irrevocably submits to the exclusive
personal jurisdiction of the Court of Chancery of the State of Delaware (or,
to the extent such court declines to accept jurisdiction over a particular
matter, any federal court within the State of Delaware, or, if such federal
court declines to accept jurisdiction, any state court within the State of
Delaware that has jurisdiction) in the event any dispute arises out of this
Agreement or the transactions contemplated hereby, (ii) agrees that it will
not attempt to deny or defeat such personal jurisdiction by motion or other
request for leave from the court identified in the foregoing clause (i), (iii)
agrees that it will not bring any action relating to this Agreement or the
transactions contemplated hereby in any court other than the court identified
in the foregoing clause (i), (iv) agrees that the other party will have the
right to bring any Action for enforcement of a judgment entered by the court
identified in the foregoing clause (i), and (v) expressly and irrevocably
waives (and agrees not to plead or claim) any objection to the laying of
venue of any Action arising out of this Agreement or the transactions
contemplated hereby in the court identified in the foregoing clause (i) or
that any such Action brought in such court has been brought in an
inconvenient forum. Each party agrees that a final judgment in any Action will
be conclusive and may be enforced in other jurisdictions by suit on the
judgment or in any other manner provided by applicable Law. The
parties hereto hereby declare that it is their intention that this Agreement
shall be regarded as made under the laws of the State of Delaware and that the
laws of said State shall be applied in interpreting its provisions in all
cases where legal interpretation shall be required. Each of the parties
hereto agrees that this Agreement (A) involves at least $100,000.00, and (B)
has been entered into by the parties hereto in express reliance upon 6 Del.C.
2708. Each party agrees (1) to the extent such party is not otherwise subject
to

 



16  service of process in the State of Delaware, to appoint and maintain an
agent in the State of Delaware as such partys agent for acceptance of legal
process in connection with any legal proceeding brought under this Agreement,
and (2) that, to the fullest extent permitted by applicable Law, service of
process in connection with any such proceeding may also be made on such party
by prepaid certified mail to the address provided in Section 8.02 with a
proof of mailing receipt validated by the United States Postal Service
constituting evidence of valid service, and that service made pursuant to (1)
or (2) above shall, to the fullest extent permitted by applicable law, have
the same legal force and effect as if served upon such person personally
within the State of Delaware. For purposes of implementing the parties
agreement to appoint and maintain an agent for service of process in the
State of Delaware, each party that has not as of the date of this Agreement
already duly appointed such an agent, does hereby appoint Corporation Service
Company as such agent.

 

SECTION 8.10. _Waiver of Jury Trial_. EACH PARTY HEREBY WAIVES, TO THE FULLEST
EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW, ANY RIGHT IT MAY HAVE TO A TRIAL BY JURY
IN RESPECT OF ANY ACTION ARISING OUT OF THE TRANSACTION AGREEMENTS OR ANY OF
THE TRANSACTIONS. EACH PARTY (A) CERTIFIES THAT NO REPRESENTATIVE, AGENT OR
ATTORNEY OF THE OTHER PARTY HAS REPRESENTED, EXPRESSLY OR OTHERWISE, THAT
SUCH PARTY WOULD NOT, IN THE EVENT OF ANY ACTION, SUIT OR PROCEEDING, SEEK TO
ENFORCE THE FOREGOING WAIVER AND (B) ACKNOWLEDGES THAT IT AND THE OTHER PARTY
HAVE BEEN INDUCED TO ENTER INTO THIS AGREEMENT BY, AMONG OTHER THINGS, THE
MUTUAL WAIVER AND CERTIFICATIONS IN THIS SECTION 8.10.

SECTION 8.11. _Third Party Beneficiaries_. Except as provided in this Section
8.11, the provisions of this Agreement are solely for the benefit of the
parties hereto and are not intended to confer upon any Person except the
parties hereto any rights and remedies hereunder. The Company is an intended
third party beneficiary of, with enforceable rights and remedies under this
Agreement (including pursuant to Section 8.12) in respect of, BATs agreement
(a) to purchase the New Shares pursuant to, and in accordance with, Section
2.01, (b) to take (or refrain from taking) such actions as set forth in
Section 5.08, including attending and voting, in person or by proxy, or
otherwise causing to be voted, the Voting Shares at any meeting of Parent
stockholders (or other circumstance at which a vote with respect to the Share
Issuance is sought) pursuant to, and in accordance with, Section 5.08, and (c)
to take (or refrain from taking) such actions set forth Section 5.09,
including BATs agreement not to Transfer Owned Shares or grant proxies or
enter voting arrangements in respect of Owned Shares, pursuant to, and in
accordance with, Section 5.09, in each case subject to the terms and
conditions of this Agreement. Without the prior written consent of the
Company, (x) Sections 2.01, 5.08, 5.09 and this Section 8.11 may not be
amended, modified or waived, (y) this Agreement may not be terminated by the
mutual written consent of BAT and Parent and (z) no other amendment,
modification or waiver, or grant of consent or extension in connection
therewith, may be made to, or granted under, this Agreement that is
inconsistent with the foregoing clauses (x) and (y).

 



17 SECTION 8.12. _Specific Performance_. The parties acknowledge and agree that
irreparable damage would occur in the event that any of the provisions of
this Agreement were not performed in accordance with their specific terms or
were otherwise breached, and that monetary damages, even if available, would
not be an adequate remedy therefor. It is accordingly agreed that, prior to
the termination of this Agreement pursuant to Article VII, the parties (and,
for the avoidance of doubt, the Company in respect of those provisions of this
Agreement to which it is a third party beneficiary pursuant to Section 8.11)
will be entitled to an injunction or injunctions to prevent breaches of this
Agreement and to enforce specifically the performance of terms and provisions
of this Agreement, without proof of actual damages (and each party hereby
waives any requirement for the securing or posting of any bond in connection
with such remedy), this being in addition to any other remedy to which they
are entitled at law or in equity. The parties further agree not to
assert that a remedy of specific enforcement is unenforceable, invalid,
contrary to Law or inequitable for any reason, nor to assert that a remedy of
monetary damages would provide an adequate remedy for any such breach.

 

SECTION 8.13. _Interpretation_. When a reference is made in this Agreement to
an Article or a Section, such reference will be to an Article or a Section of
this Agreement unless otherwise indicated. The headings contained in this
Agreement are for reference purposes only and will not affect in any way the
meaning or interpretation of this Agreement. Whenever the words "include",
"includes" or "including" are used in this Agreement, they will be deemed to
be followed by the words "without limitation." The words "hereof", "hereto",
"hereby", "herein" and "hereunder" and words of similar import when used in
this Agreement will refer to this Agreement as a whole and not to any
particular provision of this Agreement. The term "or" is not exclusive. The
word "extent" in the phrase "to the extent" will mean the degree to which a
subject or other thing extends, and such phrase will not mean simply "if". The
definitions contained in this Agreement are applicable to the singular as
well as the plural forms of such terms. Any agreement, instrument or Law
defined or referred to herein means such agreement, instrument or Law as from
time to time amended, modified or supplemented, unless otherwise
specifically indicated. References to a Person are also to its permitted
successors and assigns. Unless otherwise specifically indicated, all
references to "dollars" and "$" will be deemed references to the lawful money
of the United States of America. Each party has participated in the drafting
and negotiation of this Agreement. If an ambiguity or question of intent or
interpretation arises, this Agreement must be construed as if it is drafted by
both parties, and no presumption or burden of proof will arise favoring or
disfavoring any party by virtue of authorship of any of the provisions of this
Agreement.

 



18 IN WITNESS WHEREOF, the parties have executed this Agreement as of the date
first written above.
