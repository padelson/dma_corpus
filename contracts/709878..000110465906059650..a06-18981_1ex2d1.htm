due in respect of such Tax Returns. The Seller shall prepare (or cause to be
prepared ) all Tax Returns required to be filed on or after the Closing Date
for all periods ending on, before or including the Closing Date. All such Tax
Returns shall be prepared in a manner consistent with Applicable Law and
prior Tax Returns of the Company and the Subsidiary, in that order. The
Seller shall furnish the Buyer with a copy of any Tax Return required to be
prepared by it at least 30 Business Days prior to the due date for filing
such Tax Returns by the Company for the Buyers review and approval.  The
Buyer shall execute and file such Tax Returns and pay all Taxes due with

     

   

respect to such Tax Returns on or prior to the due date therefor. The Buyer
shall not, without the consent of the Seller, which consent shall not be
unreasonably withheld, amend, refile or alter any Tax Return for a taxation
period ending before Closing.

  

(b) The Seller and Buyer shall jointly execute and file, on a timely basis
and using a form reasonably acceptable to counsel to the Buyer and the Seller
and in the prescribed form (when available), a joint election to have
paragraph 56.4(3)(c) of the Income Tax Act (Canada) apply to the amount of
the Purchase Price attributable to the Non-Competition Agreement and shall
prepare their respective Tax Returns consistent with such joint election. For
the purposes of such joint election, the amount of the Purchase Price
attributable to the Non-Competition Agreement will be consistent with the
Purchase Price allocation determined in accordance with Section 2.1 (2).

  

(c) The Buyer will cause the Subsidiary to remit to the Receiver General for
Canada, in the time prescribed for such remittance, the amount required to be
remitted by the Subsidiary pursuant to subsection 215(1) of the _Income
Tax Act_ (Canada) as a consequence of the application of subsection 219(5.3)
of that Act. Such amount which represents $2,515,585 shall be deducted from
the Purchase Price. Furthermore, the Seller shall, on the Closing Date,
furnish the Buyer with a copy of a certificate issued under section 116 of
the _Income Tax Act_ (Canada) received by PLIC in relation to the redemption
by the Company, immediately after the Closing Date, of the Class B shares
owned by PLIC (the "PLIC Certificate"). If a copy of the PLIC Certificate is
not furnished to the Buyer on the Closing Date, the latter will withhold from
the Purchase Price an additional amount of $5,031,871 (the "Additional
Amount"). The Additional Amount will be held in trust by an escrow agent to
be agreed upon by the parties, and invested in an interest bearing account.
Until the Seller furnishes the Buyer with a copy of the PLIC Certificate, the
Additional Amount, together with all accrued interest thereon, shall be held
by the escrow agent. If the Seller has provided the Buyer with a copy of the
PLIC Certificate prior to the date that is one (1) year following the Closing
Date, the Additional Amount with all accrued interest thereon (net of any
withholding taxes) shall be remitted by the escrow agent to the Seller
immediately upon the Seller providing a copy of the PLIC Certificate to the
Buyer. If the Seller has not provided the Buyer with a copy of the PLIC
Certificate within one year of the Closing Date, the escrow agent shall then
immediately remit the Additional Amount to the Receiver General for Canada on
account of the liability of the Seller pursuant to subsections 219 (5.3) and
212(2) of the _Income Tax Act_ (Canada) and shall pay the accrued interest
(net of any withholding taxes) to the Seller.  Notwithstanding any other
provision of this Agreement, the Buyer shall indemnify in full the Seller and
PLIC for any Canadian Taxes payable by either the Seller or PLIC arising in
respect of the Buyers failure to comply with this section 4.8(c).

     

   

 **4.9** Legal Proceedings

  

The Seller, the Company and the Subsidiary shall cause the Company and the
Subsidiary to vigorously defend or cause to be defended any law suit, or
other legal proceeding brought against them and challenging this Agreement or
the completion of the transactions contemplated hereunder.

  

 **4.10** Consents and Waivers

  

The Seller shall use all commercially reasonable efforts (including paying
such reasonable charges and fees as may be necessary) to obtain, prior to
Closing and at the Sellers expense, all consents and waivers from third
parties required to ensure compliance with each of the terms of Subsection
3.1.7 and those required to sell the Shares to the Buyer, to consummate all
transactions contemplated by the Agreement or the Closing Documents and to
conduct the Business immediately following the Closing. The Buyer shall
provide full co-operation and assistance to the Seller in its efforts to
obtain such consents and waivers. If such consents and waivers cannot be
obtained by Closing, the Seller and the Buyer will work together in good
faith to find a commercially reasonable solution to the problem caused by the
failure to obtain such consents and waivers which solution will be
implemented at the Sellers expense ** _._**

  

 **4.11** Change of Name of Company

  

At the time of Closing, the Buyer shall cause the Company and the Subsidiary
to release and assign without payment of compensation of any kind as the
Seller may direct any and all right, title or interest which the Company or
Subsidiary may have in the word "UAFC" howsoever used including, without
limitation, in any logo or design incorporating such word. As soon as
practicable after the Closing Date, and in any event no later than 90 days
following the Closing Date, the Buyer shall cause the Company to change its
corporate name, business name, style and Internet domain address to a name,
style and address that does not include the word "UAFC" or any similar word,
style or reference.

  

 **4.12** Maintenance of Insurance

  

The Buyer shall be responsible for obtaining and maintaining all policies of
insurance in connection with the Business from and after the Closing Time.

  

 **4.13** No Tax Waiver Without Sellers Consent

  

The Buyer will not, except with the express written consent of the Seller,
which shall not unreasonably be withheld, provide any Governmental Authority
a waiver or similar document extending the period during which the
Governmental Authority is entitled to issue any assessment, reassessment or
other form of recognized document assessing liability for Taxes under
Applicable Law in respect of any taxation period ending on, before or in
which the Closing Date occurs.

  

 **4.14** Additional Information

  

The Seller shall, upon written request from the Buyer, provide the Buyer with
all documents and information related to any transaction between the Company
or the Subsidiary, on the one hand, and the Seller or any of its non-
Canadian Affiliates, on the other hand.

     

   

 **4.15** Life Reserve Adjustment

  

As agreed upon between the Subsidiarys Appointed Actuary and the Buyers
actuary, the Buyer will cause the Subsidiary to record an adjustment of its
life reserve of approximately $900,000 pre tax to be posted after Closing.

  

 **4.16** Specified Employees

  

The Seller will provide to the Buyer the list of Specified Employees prior to
the Closing Date which list shall be subject to the approval of the Buyer,
acting reasonably. The Seller covenants to give or cause its designate to
give notice of termination to each of the Specified Employees in the manner
and within the period prescribed by the Employment Standards Act, 2000, S.O.
2000, c. 41 and in particular, Section 58 thereof and the regulations
thereto, with the effect and intent that their employment shall be terminated
on or prior to the Closing Date and that the Seller or its designate shall be
solely responsible, to the complete indemnification of the Buyer, the Company
and the Subsidiary, for all obligations and liabilities of any kind or nature
whatsoever to or in respect of the Specified Employees, including, without
limitation, the giving of notice of termination and the payment of
all amounts due to the Specified Employees, whether on account of severance
or termination pay, notice in lieu thereof, claims with respect to
wrongful dismissal, salary, bonuses or other compensation, employee benefits,
employee source deductions and remittances or accrued and unpaid vacation
pay.

  

 **4.17** Experience Study for Return of Premium

  

The experience study on the return of premium has been completed by the
Subsidiarys Appointed Actuary. The Buyers actuaries have had access to the
work done by the Appointed Actuary in preparation of such study and the Buyer
has advised the Seller in writing that it is satisfied with the results of
such study.

 **5.7** Defence of Third Party Claims

  

(a) The Indemnifier may participate in or assume the defence of any Third
Party Claim by giving notice to that effect to the Indemnified Party not
later than 45 days after receiving notice of that Third Party Claim (the "
**Notice Period** "). The Indemnifiers right to do so shall be subject to
the rights of any insurer or other party who has potential liability in
respect of that Third Party Claim. The Indemnifier agrees to pay all of its
own expenses of participating in or assuming such defence. The Indemnified
Party shall co-operate in good faith in the defence of each Third Party
Claim, even if the defence has been assumed by the Indemnifier and may
participate in such defence assisted by counsel of its own choice at its own
expense. The Indemnifier shall not enter into any compromise or settlement of
any Third Party Claim without obtaining the prior written consent of the
Indemnified Party, which consent may not be unreasonably withheld. If the
Indemnified Party has not received notice within the Notice Period that the
Indemnifier has elected to assume the defence of such Third Party Claim, the
Indemnified Party may, at its option, elect to settle or compromise the Third
Party Claim or assume such defence, assisted by counsel of its own choosing
and the Indemnifier shall be liable for all reasonable costs and expenses
paid or incurred in connection therewith and any Loss suffered or incurred by
the Indemnified Party with respect to such Third Party Claim.

  

(b) Notwithstanding Section 5.7(a), before an Indemnifier can either (i)
require that the Indemnified Party or any of its Affiliates, defends a Third
Party Claim, or (ii) participate in or assume the defence of any such Third
Party Claim, the Indemnifier shall provide the Indemnified Party with all
funds that the Indemnified Party, or any Affiliate of such Indemnified Party,
is required to deposit or pay under any Applicable Law in order to contest
such Third Party Claim. The funds provided by the Indemnifier, which may
represent, among other amounts, all or part of the Third Party Claim, shall
be provided to the Indemnified Party on an interest-free basis. If the
Indemnified Party does not receive sufficient funds within the Notice Period
to entitle it or any of its Affiliates to fulfill all legal prerequisites
necessary to contest a Third Party Claim, the Indemnified Party or any of its
Affiliates of, shall be entitled to settle the Third Party Claim and the
Indemnifier shall be required to indemnify the Indemnified Party pursuant to
the terms of this Agreement. To the extent that the required funds have been
provided by the Indemnifier and the contestation of the Third Party Claim has
resulted in the final determination by the competent authority or the court
rejecting the Third Party Claim in its entirety, the Indemnified Party shall
release and pay the funds received from the Indemnifier back to the
Indemnifier. To the extent that the Third Party Claim has been either wholly
or partially upheld by the final determination of the competent authority or
the court, the Indemnified Party shall release and pay back to the
Indemnifier the amount, if any, by which the funds provided by
the Indemnifier and that are described in this paragraph exceed the amount
that must be paid by the Indemnified Party or any of its Affiliates, pursuant
to the final determination of the Third Party Claim.  If the amount of funds
that is reimbursed pursuant to the final determination of the Third Party
Claim to the Indemnified Party or any of its Affiliates includes an amount of
interest, the Indemnified Party shall pay to the Indemnifier an amount equal
to the interest

     

   



  

received on the funds that were paid or deposited, less an amount equal to
the amount, as determined by the Indemnified Party, that the Indemnified
Party or any of its Affiliates shall pay to any Regulatory Authority as Taxes
on the interest.

  

 **5.8** Assistance for Third Party Claims

  

The Indemnifier and the Indemnified Party will use all reasonable efforts to
make available to the Party, which is undertaking and controlling the defence
of any Third Party Claim (the " **Defending Party** "):

  

(a) Those employees whose assistance, testimony or presence is necessary to
assist the Defending Party in evaluating and in defending any Third Party
Claim; and

  

(b) All documents, records and other materials in the possession of such
Party reasonably required by the Defending Party for its use in defending any
Third Party Claim;

  

and shall otherwise cooperate with the Defending Party. The Indemnifier shall
be responsible for all reasonable expenses associated with making such
documents, records and materials available and for all reasonable expenses of
any employees made available by the Indemnified Party to the Indemnifier
hereunder, (excluding their salary and other advantages or consideration
payable under their employment agreement), which expense shall not exceed the
actual cost to the Indemnified Party associated with such employees.

  

 **5.9** Settlement of Third Party Claims

  

If an Indemnifier elects to assume the defence of any Third Party Claim as
provided in Section 5.7(a), the Indemnifier shall not be liable for any legal
expenses subsequently incurred by the Indemnified Party in connection with
the defence of such Third Party Claim. However, if the Indemnifier fails to
take reasonable steps necessary to defend diligently such Third Party Claim
within 45 days after receiving notice from the Indemnified Party that the
Indemnified Party _bona fide_  believes on reasonable grounds that the
Indemnifier has failed to take such steps, the Indemnified Party may, at its
option, elect to assume the defence of and to compromise or settle the Third
Party Claim assisted by counsel of its own choice and the Indemnifier shall
be liable for all reasonable costs and expenses paid or incurred in
connection therewith. Without the prior written consent of the Indemnified
Party, which may not be unreasonably withheld, the Indemnifier shall not
enter into any compromise or settlement of any Third Party Claim, which would
lead to liability or create any financial or other obligation on the part of
the Indemnified Party.

  

 **5.10** Direct Claims

  

Any Direct Claim shall be asserted by giving the Indemnifier reasonably
prompt written notice thereof, but in any event not later than 60 days after
the Indemnified Party becomes aware of such Direct Claim. The Indemnifier
shall then have a period of 45 days within which to respond in writing to
such Direct Claim. If the Indemnifier does not so respond within such 45 day
period, the Indemnifier shall be deemed to have rejected such Claim, and in
such event the Indemnified Party shall be free to pursue such remedies as may
be available to the Indemnified Party.

     

   



  

 **5.11** Failure to Give Timely Notice

  

A failure to give timely notice as provided in this Article 5 shall not
affect the rights or obligations of any Party except and only to the extent
that, as a result of such failure, any Party which was entitled to receive
such notice was deprived of its right to recover any payment under its
applicable insurance coverage or was otherwise directly and materially
damaged as a result of such failure.

  

 **5.12** Payment and Interest

  

All Losses shall bear interest at a rate per annum equal to the Prime Rate,
calculated and payable monthly, both before and after judgment, with interest
on overdue interest at the same rate, from the date that the Indemnified
Party disbursed funds, suffered damages or losses or incurred a loss,
liability or expense in respect of a Loss, to the date of payment by the
Indemnifier to the Indemnified Party.

  

 **5.13** Purchase Price Adjustment
