---|---|--- 

 



    



  

(b) Promptly after the Effective Time, Parent shall cause the
Exchange Agent to mail to each holder of record of a Certificate or Book-
Entry Share and whose shares of Company Class A Common Stock each were
converted pursuant to _Section 2.1(a)_ into the right to receive the Merger
Consideration (i) a letter of transmittal, which shall specify that delivery
shall be effected, and risk of loss and title to the Certificates or Book-
Entry Shares shall pass, only upon delivery of such to the Exchange Agent and
shall be in such form and have such other provisions as Parent may reasonably
specify and (ii) instructions for effecting the surrender of the Company
Class A Common Stock in exchange for the Merger Consideration that such holder
has the right to receive pursuant to _Section 2.1(a)_ , including any amount
of cash payable in respect of fractional shares in accordance with _Section
2.7_. Upon surrender of a Certificate (or an affidavit of loss in lieu
thereof) or Book-Entry Share for cancellation to the Exchange Agent or to
such other agent or agents as may be appointed by Parent, together with such
letter of transmittal duly completed and validly executed in accordance with
the instructions thereto, and such other documents as may be required pursuant
to such instructions, the holder of such Certificate or Book-Entry Share
shall be entitled to receive in exchange therefor the applicable Merger
Consideration for each share of Company Class A Common Stock formerly
represented by such Certificate or Book-Entry Share, to be delivered
within ten (10) Business Days following the later to occur of (x) the
Effective Time or (y) the Exchange Agent's receipt of a duly executed letter
of transmittal and such Certificate (or affidavit of loss in lieu thereof) or
Book-Entry Share, and the Certificate (or affidavit of loss in lieu thereof)
or Book-Entry Share so surrendered shall be forthwith canceled. The Exchange
Agent shall accept such Certificates (or affidavits of loss in lieu thereof)
or Book-Entry Shares upon compliance with such reasonable terms and
conditions as the Exchange Agent may impose to effect an orderly exchange
thereof in accordance with normal exchange practices. If registration of the
Merger Consideration is to be made to a Person other than the Person in whose
name the surrendered Certificate is registered, it shall be a condition
precedent of such registration that (A) the Certificate so surrendered shall
be properly endorsed or shall be otherwise in proper form for transfer and
(B) the Person requesting such registration shall have paid any transfer and
other similar Taxes required by reason of the registration of the Merger
Consideration to a Person other than the registered holder of the Certificate
surrendered or shall have established to the satisfaction of Parent that such
Tax either has been paid or is not required to be paid. Registration of the
applicable Merger Consideration with respect to Book-Entry Shares shall only
be made to the Person in whose name such Book-Entry Shares are registered.
Until surrendered as contemplated by this  _Section 2.4(b)_ , each
Certificate and Book-Entry Share shall be deemed at any time after the
Effective Time to represent only the right to receive the applicable Merger
Consideration as contemplated by this _Section 2.4(b)_ , without interest
thereon.

  



  

(c) In the event that any Certificates shall have been lost, stolen
or destroyed, the Exchange Agent shall issue in exchange for such lost,
stolen or destroyed Certificates, upon the making of an affidavit of that fact
by the holder thereof (such affidavit to be in a form reasonably satisfactory
to Parent and the Exchange Agent), the applicable Merger Consideration payable
in respect thereof pursuant to _Section 2.1(a)_ , including any amount
payable in respect of fractional shares in accordance with _Section 2.7_
; provided, that Parent may, in its discretion and as a condition precedent
to the issuance thereof, require the owner of such lost, stolen or destroyed
Certificate to deliver a bond in such reasonable and customary amount as
Parent may direct as indemnity against any claim that may be made against
Parent, the Surviving Corporation or the Exchange Agent with respect to the
Certificate alleged to have been lost, stolen or destroyed.

  



  

Section 2.5 _Transfer Books; No Further Ownership Rights_. At the
Effective Time, the stock transfer books of the Company shall be closed and

Effective Time, the holders of Certificates or Book-Entry Shares outstanding
immediately prior to the Effective Time shall cease to have any rights with
respect to the shares of Company Class A Common Stock formerly represented
thereby except as otherwise provided for herein or by Applicable Law. If,
after the Effective Time, Certificates or Book-Entry Shares are presented to

(a) _Termination of Exchange Agent; No Liability_. With respect to
any portion of the Merger Consideration that remains unclaimed by the

respect to the applicable Merger Consideration due to such holders upon due
surrender of their Certificates or Book-Entry Shares and compliance with the
procedures in _Section 2.4(b)_ , without any interest thereon.
Notwithstanding the foregoing, none of Parent, the Surviving Corporation or

(b) _Withholding_. Each of Parent, the Company, the Surviving
Corporation and the Exchange Agent shall be entitled to deduct and withhold
from any amounts otherwise payable to any Person pursuant to this Agreement
such amounts as may be required to be deducted and withheld with respect to
the making of such payment under Applicable Law with respect to Taxes. Any
amounts so deducted and withheld shall be treated for all purposes of this
Agreement as having been paid to the Person in respect of which such deduction
or withholding was made.

  



  

Section 2.6 _Treatment of Company Equity Awards_.

  



  

(a) _Company Options and Company SARs_. At the Effective Time,
without any action on the part of the holder thereof, each Company Option and
Company SAR that is outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time and
that has an exercise price that is less than the product of (1) the Exchange
Ratio and (2) the Parent Stock Price (such product, the "Merger Consideration
FMV" (such Company Option or Company SAR, an " _In-the-Money Option_ " or "
_In-the-Money SAR_ ", respectively), shall become fully vested (to the extent
not already vested) and shall automatically be canceled and extinguished, no
longer be outstanding and cease to represent the right to acquire shares of
Company Class A Common Stock, and in consideration therefor, the holder
thereof shall be entitled to receive, as soon as reasonably practicable after
the Effective Time, a "number" of shares of Parent Common Stock for each such
Company Option and Company SAR, wherein the "number" is determined
by dividing (i) the excess of (x) the Exchange Ratio multiplied by the Parent
Stock Price minus (y) the per-share exercise price for the shares of Company
Class A Common Stock that would have been issuable upon exercise of such In-
the-Money Option or In-the-Money SAR as the case may be, by (ii) the Parent
Stock Price and rounding to the nearest ten-thousandth of a share. Each
Company Option and Company SAR that is outstanding immediately prior to the
Effective Time and that is not an In-the-Money Option or In-the-Money SAR,
whether vested or unvested, shall be canceled and extinguished, no longer be
outstanding and cease to represent the right to acquire shares of Company
Class A Common Stock and no consideration shall be paid therefore. Parent
shall pay to each holder of In-the-Money Options or In-the-Money SARs cash in
lieu of fractional shares to which such holder would be entitled pursuant to
this _Section 2.6(a)_ ; provided that the calculation of the amount of such
fractional shares shall be determined on an aggregate basis taking into
account all In-the-Money Options and In-the-Money SARs held by such holder.
For purposes hereof, "Parent Stock Price" shall mean the volume weighted
average price of a share of Parent Common Stock on NASDAQ GM for the five
(5) trading days ending on the last trading day prior to the day on which the
Effective Time occurs. 

  



    

 | \- 17 -| 
---|---|--- 

 



    



  

(b) _Company Warrants_. Not less than seven (7) Business Days prior
to the Closing, the Company will provide written notice to all holders of
each outstanding unexercised warrant to purchase or otherwise acquire shares
of Company Class A Common Stock (each, a " _Company Warrant_ "), which notice
shall include such reasonable information as a holder of a Company Warrant may
reasonably require regarding the treatment of a Company Warrant in connection
with the Closing and which notice shall otherwise be provided in
accordance with the terms of each applicable Company Warrant agreement. If,
upon receiving notice of the Closing of the Merger, the holder of a Company
Warrant exercises such Company Warrant in accordance with its terms, then (1)
such exercise shall be deemed effective immediately prior to and contingent
upon the consummation of the Merger and such exercise will be governed by the
terms of the applicable Company Warrant agreement, and (2) at the Effective
Time, such Company Warrant shall be cancelled and, the holder thereof shall
be entitled to receive, as promptly as practicable (but no later than fifteen
(15) calendar days) following the Effective Time, in consideration of the
exercise and cancellation of such Company Warrant and in settlement therefor,
in lieu of the Company Class A Common Stock immediately issuable upon
exercise of the Company Warrant, that number of shares of Parent Common Stock
equal to the Exchange Ratio multiplied by the number of shares of Company
Class A Common Stock that would have been issuable upon exercise of such
Company Warrant had the Company Warrant been exercised immediately prior
thereto. If, upon receiving notice of the Closing of the Merger, the holder
of a Company Warrant does not exercise such Company Warrant in accordance with
its terms, then (A) such Company Warrant will expire immediately prior to the
consummation of the Merger and (B) at the Effective Time, such Company
Warrant shall be cancelled and extinguished, no longer outstanding and cease
to represent the right to acquire shares of Company Class A Common Stock or
receive any Merger Consideration, without any payment of any consideration
therefor. The Company agrees to take all necessary action to terminate each
Company Warrant as of the Effective Time in accordance with the terms of the
applicable Company Warrant agreement. The provisions of this _Section 2.6(b)_
shall not apply in respect of the warrants issued to, and outstanding in the
name of, HCP-FVF, LLC, the treatment of which is governed by an agreement
between HCP-FVF LLC and the Company.

  



  

(c) _Company Restricted Stock Units_. At the Effective Time, each
Company RSU that is outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time shall
vest in full and the restrictions thereon shall lapse. As of the Effective
Time, each such Company RSU shall be cancelled and the holder thereof shall
be entitled to receive, as promptly as practicable (but no later than fifteen
(15) calendar days) following the Effective Time, (1) a number of shares of
Parent Common Stock equal to the Exchange Ratio multiplied by the number of
shares of Company Class A Common Stock represented by each such Company RSU
and (2) any accrued but unpaid dividends with respect to any Company RSU, in
each case without interest and less applicable withholding Taxes.

  



  

(d) _Notices_. Parent and the Company shall cooperate to provide
any notices to the holders of Company Options, Company SARs, Company
Warrants and Company RSUs required in connection with the consummation of the
Merger and the other Transactions.

  



  

(e) The Company shall, immediately prior to the Effective Time, take
all actions necessary in order to, and terminate each Company Option Plan and
cancel the Company Options and Company SARs (in accordance with cancellation
agreements or otherwise) and to effectuate the actions contemplated by this
_Section 2.6_ and to ensure that no holder of Company Options, Company SARs,
Company Warrants or Company RSUs shall have any rights from and after the
Effective Time with respect to any such Company Options, Company
SARs, Company Warrants or Company RSUs, except as expressly provided in this
_Section 2.6_ ; provided that such actions shall expressly be conditioned
upon the consummation of the Merger and each of the other Transactions and
shall be of no force or effect if this Agreement is terminated.

Section 2.7 _Fractional Shares_.

  



  

(a) No certificates, receipts or scrip representing fractional
shares of Parent Common Stock shall be issued upon the surrender or
transfer for exchange of Certificates or Book-Entry Shares and no such holder
of fractional shares of Parent Common Stock shall be entitled to dividends,
voting rights or any other rights in respect of any fractional share.

  



  

(b) Notwithstanding any other provision of this Agreement, each
holder of a share of Company Class A Common Stock converted in the Merger who
would otherwise be entitled to receive a fraction of a share of Parent Common
Stock (after taking into account all shares of Company Class A Common Stock
held at the Effective Time by such holder) shall receive, in lieu thereof,
from the Exchange Agent, an amount in cash equal to the product obtained by
multiplying (i) the fraction of a share of Parent Common Stock to which such
holder would otherwise have been entitled by (ii) the closing price for a
share of Parent Common Stock on NASDAQ GM on the first Business
Day immediately following the Effective Time.

  



  

Section 2.8 _Further Assurances_. If, at any time after
the Effective Time, any further action is necessary or desirable to carry out
the purposes of this Agreement and to vest the Surviving Corporation with
full right, title and interest in, to and under, and/or possession of, all
assets, property, rights, privileges, powers and franchises of the Company,
the officers and directors of the Surviving Corporation are fully authorized
in the name and on behalf of the Company or otherwise, to take all lawful
action necessary or desirable to accomplish such purpose or acts.

comment from the SEC with respect to the Registration Statement and
Proxy/Prospectus, (ii) have the Registration Statement declared effective
under the Securities Act as promptly as practicable after its filing, to
(iii) maintain the effectiveness of the Registration Statement for as long as
necessary to consummate the Merger and the other transactions contemplated by
this Agreement, and (iv) promptly after the Registration Statement is

Proxy/Prospectus, the Registration Statement and such other documents related
to the Company Shareholder Meeting or the issuance of the shares of Parent
Common Stock in respect of the Merger all comments reasonably and promptly
proposed by the other party or its legal counsel and each agrees that all

the Company Shareholder Meeting is necessary to enable the Company to solicit
additional proxies required to obtain the Company Shareholder Approval;

the Company Shareholder Approval is obtained, the Company receives an
unsolicited, written, _bona fide_ Acquisition Proposal that the board of
directors of the Company determines in good faith (after consultation with

provided, that, in each such case, the Company, the Company Subsidiaries and
the Company Representatives shall have complied with each of the following:

 | \- 63 -| 
---|---|--- 

 



    



  

(ii) (x) the board of directors of the Company first shall have
determined in good faith (after consultation with its outside legal
counsel) that the failure to deliver or make available such information or
engage in such discussions would be reasonably likely to result in a
violation of its fiduciary obligations to the Company and the Company's
shareholders under Applicable Law, and (y) the Company provides written
notice to Parent immediately after any such determination by the board of
directors of the Company and before taking any of the actions described in
(A) and (B) of this sentence; and

  



  

(iii) prior to delivering or making available to any such Person any
material non-public information, the Company first shall have received from
such Person an executed confidentiality agreement on terms no less favorable
to the Company than the Confidentiality Agreement.

  



  

(e) Except as otherwise provided in this Agreement, the board of
directors of the Company (including a duly authorized committee
thereof) shall not (i) withhold, withdraw, amend or modify, or publicly
propose to withhold, withdraw, amend or modify, in a manner adverse to Parent

include the Company Board Recommendation in the Proxy/Prospectus), (ii)
approve, endorse or recommend, or publicly propose to approve, endorse or
recommend to the shareholders of the Company an Acquisition Proposal, (iii)
fail to publicly recommend against acceptance of any tender offer or exchange
offer for the Company Class A Common Stock within ten (10) Business Days
after commencement of such offer or against any Acquisition Proposal
(provided that a "stop, look and listen" communication by the board of
directors of the Company to the shareholders of the Company pursuant to Rule
14d-9(f) of the Exchange Act shall not be deemed to be a Company Adverse
Recommendation Change unless and until the board of directors of the Company
fails to reconfirm the Company Board Recommendation by the close of
business on the tenth (10th) Business Day following the commencement of a
tender offer or exchange offer), (iv) other than with respect to the period
of up to ten (10) Business Days applicable to tender offer or exchange offers
that are the subject of the preceding clause (iii), fail to publicly reaffirm
the Company Board Recommendation, in each case, within five (5) Business Days
after Parent so requests in writing, (v) enter into any definitive agreement
providing for an Acquisition Proposal or (vi) resolve or publicly propose to
take any action described in the foregoing clauses (i) through (v) (each of
the foregoing actions described in clauses (i) through (v) being referred to

(f) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement, the
board of directors of the Company (or a duly authorized committee thereof)
may: (i) make a Company Adverse Recommendation Change in response to an
Intervening Event if the Company's board of directors has determined in good
faith, after consultation with its financial advisor and outside legal
counsel, that the failure of the Company's board of directors to make a
Company Adverse Recommendation Change would be reasonably likely to violate
its fiduciary obligations to the Company and the Company's shareholders under
Applicable Law; (ii) make a Company Adverse Recommendation Change in response
to the Company receiving an unsolicited, written, _bona fide_ Acquisition
Proposal that the Company's board of directors determines in good faith,
after consultation with its financial advisor and outside legal counsel,
constitutes a Superior Proposal; or (iii) if the Company has complied in all
material respects with this _Section 6.4_ , cause the Company to terminate
this Agreement and, prior to or substantially concurrently with such
termination, cause the Company to enter into a definitive written agreement
providing for such Superior Proposal, if, and only if, in all cases, the board
of directors of the Company determines in good faith, after consulting with
and receiving advice from outside counsel, that the failure to (1) effect a
Company Adverse Recommendation Change or (2) terminate this Agreement and
enter into a definitive written agreement providing for a Superior Proposal,
as the case may be, would be reasonably likely to violate its fiduciary
obligations to the Company and the Company's shareholders under Applicable
Law.

(g) Subject to _Section 6.4(f)_ , (i) no Company Adverse
Recommendation Change may be made in response to an Intervening Event or
Superior Proposal and (ii) no termination of this Agreement in accordance
with _Section 6.4(f)_ may be made unless: (A) the Company complies in all
material respects with this _Section 6.4(g)_ , (B) the Company provides Parent
prior written notice of its intent to make any Company Adverse Recommendation
Change or terminate this Agreement pursuant to _Section 6.4(f)_ at least four
(4) Business Days prior to taking such action (a " _Company Board
Recommendation Notice_ "), which notice shall specify (x) in the case of such
action taken in connection with a Superior Proposal, the material terms and
conditions of such Superior Proposal (including the identity of the Person
making such Superior Proposal and a copy of the then-current forms of all of
the relevant proposed transaction documents related thereto, including
definitive agreements with respect to such Superior Proposal and any
financing commitments relating thereto) or (y) in the case of such action
taken in connection with an Intervening Event, a description of such event
and any related documentation; and (C) the Company shall have, (x) during the
four (4) Business Day period specified above (and any additional period
related to a revision of the Superior Proposal, as provided below),
negotiated, and caused its Representatives to negotiate, with Parent in good
faith (to the extent Parent desires to negotiate) with respect to any
adjustments proposed by Parent to the terms and conditions of this Agreement
so that such Superior Proposal ceases to constitute a Superior Proposal (or
in the event of an Intervening Event, to allow the Merger to be effected), (y)
following the end of such four (4) Business Day period specified above (and
any additional period related to a revision of the Superior Proposal, as
provided below), the Company's board of directors shall have considered in
good faith any revisions to the terms of this Agreement proposed in writing
by Parent, and shall have determined, after consultation with its outside
financial advisor and outside legal counsel, that failure to make a Company
Adverse Recommendation Change or terminate this Agreement would be reasonably
likely to violate its fiduciary obligations to the Company and the Company's
shareholders under Applicable Law, and (z) if applicable, prior to or
substantially concurrent with, the termination of this Agreement pursuant to
_Section 6.4(f)_ , pay the Termination Fee as set forth in _Section 8.3(d)_.

  



  

(h) The parties agree that, in the case of such actions taken in
connection with a Superior Proposal, any material amendment to the
financial terms or other material terms of such Superior Proposal shall
require a new Company Board Recommendation Notice and an additional two (2)
Business Day period (the period inclusive of all such days, the " _Notice
Period_ "). The Company agrees that: (i) during the Notice Period the Company
shall, and shall cause its financial advisors and outside legal counsel to,
negotiate with Parent in good faith (if Parent indicates to the Company that
it desires to negotiate) the terms of this Agreement and (ii) the Company
shall take into account all changes and adjustments to the terms of this
Agreement proposed by Parent in determining whether such Superior Proposal
continues to constitute a Superior Proposal. The Company shall keep Parent
reasonably informed of all developments affecting the material terms of any
such Superior Proposal (and the Company shall provide Parent with copies
of any additional written materials received that relate to such Superior
Proposal).

(i) _Compliance with Tender Offer Rules_. Nothing contained in this
Agreement shall prohibit the board of directors of the Company from
taking and disclosing to the Company's shareholders a position contemplated
by Rule 14e-2(a) or Rule 14d-9 under the Exchange Act or Item 1012 of
Regulation M-A or otherwise complying with the provisions of Rule 14e-2 or
Rule 14d-9 under the Exchange Act or Item 1012 of Regulation M-A; provided,
that none of the following shall be deemed to be a Company Adverse
Recommendation Change: (i) a "stop, look and listen" or similar communication
of the type contemplated by Rule 14d-9(f) under the Exchange Act (provided
that such communication is also accompanied by a public statement by the
board of directors of the Company expressly reaffirming the Company Board
Recommendation), (ii) an express rejection of any applicable Acquisition
Proposal or (iii) an express reaffirmation of the Company Board
Recommendation.

  



  

Section 6.5 _Access to Information_

  



  

(a) Subject to Applicable Law, the Company and Parent each shall
(and shall cause its Subsidiaries to), upon reasonable request by the
other, furnish the other with all information concerning itself, its
Subsidiaries, directors, officers and shareholders and such other matters as
may be reasonably necessary or advisable in connection with the
Proxy/Prospectus, the Registration Statement or any other statement, filing,
notice or application made by or on behalf of Parent, the Company or any of
their respective Subsidiaries to any third party and/or any Governmental
Entity in connection with the Merger and the Transactions.

  



  

(b) The Company shall (and shall cause the Company Subsidiaries to),
upon giving of reasonable notice by Parent, afford Parent's officers and
other authorized Representatives reasonable access, during normal business
hours following reasonable advance notice throughout the period prior to the
Effective Time, to its officers, employees, agents, contracts, books and
records (including the work papers of such party's independent accountants
upon receipt of any required consents from such accountants), as well as
properties, offices and other facilities, and, during such period, shall (and
shall cause the Company Subsidiaries to) furnish promptly to the Parent all
information concerning its business, properties and personnel as may
reasonably be requested. Notwithstanding the foregoing, nothing in this
_Section 6.5_ shall require or be construed to require the Company to
allow Parent or its Representatives to perform any on-site procedures
(including an on-site study) with respect to any property of the Company or
the Company Subsidiaries.

  



    

 | \- 66 -| 
---|---|--- 

 



    



  

(c) This  _Section 6.5_ shall not be construed to require the
Company to permit any access to any of its (or the Company
Subsidiaries') officers, employees, agents, contracts, books or records, or
its (or the Company Subsidiaries') properties, offices or other facilities,
or to permit any inspection, review, sampling or audit, or to disclose or
otherwise make available any information that in the reasonable judgment of
the Company would (i) unreasonably disrupt the operations of the Company or
the Company Subsidiaries, (ii) result in the disclosure of any trade secrets
of any third parties or violate the terms of any confidentiality
provisions in any agreement with a third party entered into prior to the date
of this Agreement, (iii) result in a violation of Applicable Law, including
any fiduciary duty, (iv) waive the protection of any attorney-client or
similar privilege or (v) result in the disclosure of any personal information
that would expose the Company to the risk of liability. In the event that the
Company objects to any request submitted pursuant to and in accordance with
_Section 6.5(a)_ and withholds information on the basis of the
foregoing clauses (i) through (v), the Company shall inform Parent as to the
general nature of what is being withheld and the Company shall use
commercially reasonable efforts to make appropriate substitute arrangements to
permit reasonable disclosure that does not suffer from any of the foregoing
impediments, including through the use of reasonable best efforts to (A)
obtain the required consent or waiver of any third party required to provide
such information and (B) implement appropriate and mutually agreeable
measures to permit the disclosure of such information in a manner to remove
the basis for the objection, including by arrangement of appropriate clean
room procedures, redaction or entry into a customary joint defense agreement
with respect to any information to be so provided, if the Company determines
that doing so would reasonably permit the disclosure of such information
without violating Applicable Law or confidentiality restriction or
jeopardizing such privilege. All requests for information made pursuant to
this _Section 6.5_ shall be directed to Kelly Gay or other Person designated
by the Company. All information exchanged or made available shall be governed
by the terms of the Confidentiality Agreement.

  



  

(d) No exchange of information or investigation by Parent or its
Representatives shall affect or be deemed to affect, modify or waive the
representations and warranties of the Company set forth in this Agreement.

  



  

(e) To the extent that any of the information or material furnished
pursuant to this _Section 6.5_ or otherwise in accordance with the terms of
this Agreement may include material subject to the attorney-client privilege,
work product doctrine or any other applicable privilege concerning pending or
threatened legal proceedings or governmental investigations, the parties
understand and agree that they have a commonality of interest with respect to
such matters and it is their desire, intention and mutual understanding
that the sharing of such material is not intended to, and shall not, waive or
diminish in any way the confidentiality of such material or its continued
protection under the attorney-client privilege, work product doctrine or other
applicable privilege. All such information that is entitled to protection
under the attorney-client privilege, work product doctrine or other applicable
privilege shall remain entitled to such protection under these privileges,
this Agreement and under the joint defense doctrine.

  



  

Section 6.6 _Confidentiality; Public Disclosure_.

  



  

(a) The parties hereto acknowledge that Parent and the Company have
previously executed a Confidentiality Agreement, dated as of September 9,

the Transactions without the prior written consent of the other party;
provided, that either the Company or Parent may, without obtaining such prior
consent, issue such press release or make such public statement to the extent
that such party determines in good faith (following consultation with its
outside legal counsel) that such press release or public statement is
required by Applicable Law or the rules of any national securities
exchange to be issued or made so long as such party shall have (i) used all
reasonable efforts to consult and discuss in good faith with the other party
the form and content thereof prior to its release and (ii) considered in good
faith any reasonable changes that are suggested by the other party prior to
releasing or making such press release or public statement. Each of the
Company and Parent shall use commercially reasonable efforts to cause its
Representatives to comply with this _Section 6.6(b)_. Notwithstanding the
foregoing provisions of this _Section 6.6(b)_ , (i) Parent and the Company may

Transactions that consist solely of information previously disclosed in all
material respects in previous press releases or announcements made by Parent
and/or the Company in compliance with this _Section 6.6(b)_ , (ii) Parent and
the Company may make public statements in response to specific questions by
the press, analysts, investors or those attending industry conferences or
financial analyst conference calls, so long as any such statements consist
solely of information previously disclosed in all material respects in
previous press releases, public disclosures or public statements made
jointly by Parent and the Company and do not reveal any material, non-public
information regarding the other parties hereto, this Agreement or the
Transactions, and (iv) the foregoing provisions of this _Section 6.6(b)_ shall
not apply to any release or announcement made or proposed to be made in
connection with, or in response to, a Company Adverse Recommendation Change
that is effected in compliance with _Section 6.4(f)_. In addition to the
foregoing obligations, Parent and the Company shall consult with each other
reasonably in advance of issuing any non-public communications to employees or
other constituents relating to this Agreement or the Transactions.

(3) Business Days prior to the Closing Date, the Company shall cause the
lenders holding Company Debt to have prepared and delivered to the Company
and Parent pay-off letters in customary form, which pay-off letters shall be
updated, as necessary, on the Closing Date to specify (a) the identity of
each lender; (b) the amount owed or to be owed to each such lender; and (c)
the bank account and wire transfer information for each such lender. Unless
otherwise agreed with the lenders holding Company Debt, Parent agrees to use

Closing.

  



  

Section 6.8 _Regulatory Approvals_.

  



  

(a) Each of Parent and the Company shall promptly after the
execution of this Agreement apply for or otherwise seek, and use its
respective commercially reasonable efforts to obtain, all consents and
approvals of Governmental Entities required to be obtained by it for the
consummation of the Merger and the other Transactions. Without limiting the
generality or effect of the foregoing, each of Parent and the Company shall,
as soon as practicable (and in any event no later than fifteen (15) Business
Days) following the date hereof, file a Premerger Notification and Report
under the HSR Act, and shall, as soon as practicable following the date
hereof, make any filings required by any other applicable Antitrust Law. The
parties hereto shall promptly supply one another with any information that
may be required in order to make such filings or obtain such consents and
approvals. Each party hereto shall (i) consult and cooperate with one
another, and consider in good faith the views of one another, in connection
with any analyses, appearances, presentations, memoranda, briefs, arguments,
opinions and proposals made or submitted by or on behalf of any party hereto
in connection with proceedings under or relating to any applicable Antitrust
Law, (ii) coordinate with one another in preparing and exchanging such
materials and (iii) promptly provide one another (and its counsel) with copies

appearances, presentations, memoranda, briefs, arguments, opinions or
proposals or such filings, presentations or submissions, each of Parent and
the Company need not supply the other (or its counsel) with copies (or in
case of oral presentations, a summary) to the extent that any Applicable Law
requires such party or its subsidiaries to restrict or prohibit access to any
such information.

  



    

 | \- 68 -| 
---|---|--- 

 



    



  

(b) Each party hereto will notify the other promptly upon the
receipt of (i) any substantive comments from any officials of any
Governmental Entity in connection with any filings made pursuant hereto and
(ii) any request by any officials of any Governmental Entity for amendments
or supplements to any filings made pursuant to, or information provided to
comply in all material respects with, any Applicable Law. Whenever any event
occurs that is required to be set forth in an amendment or supplement to any
filing made pursuant to _Section 6.8(a)_ , each party hereto will promptly
inform the other parties of such occurrence and cooperate in filing with the
applicable Governmental Entity such amendment or supplement.

  



  

(c) Each of Parent and the Company shall use its respective
commercially reasonable efforts to resolve such objections, if any, as may
be asserted by any Governmental Entity with respect to the Transactions under
any applicable Antitrust Laws. Parent and the Company shall take any and all
of the following actions to the extent necessary to cause the expiration of
the notice periods under applicable Antitrust Laws with respect to the
Transactions and to obtain the approval of any Governmental Entity with
jurisdiction over the enforcement of any Applicable Law regarding the
Transactions: (i) entering into negotiations, (ii) providing information
required by Applicable Law, (iii) substantially complying with any "second
request" for information pursuant to applicable Antitrust Laws, and (iv)
defending any action, suit or proceeding instituted (or threatened to be
instituted) by any Government Entity or any third party challenging the
Transactions or that would otherwise prohibit or materially impair or
materially delay the consummation of such Transaction. Notwithstanding the
foregoing, the Parent shall not be required to (and Company and its
Subsidiaries shall not, without the prior written consent of the Parent)
commit to or effect any divestiture, disposal, holding separate or
licensing of, any agreement to conduct in a specified manner, or any
restriction on or limitation of, any of the assets or business of Parent or
the Company.

  



  

(d) Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, in no event
shall the Company, and the Company shall cause the Company Subsidiaries not
to, without Parent's prior written consent, commit to or propose any
divestiture transaction, or commit or propose to alter their businesses or
commercial practices in any way, or otherwise take or commit to take (or
propose to take or commit to take) any such action that, in each case, would
reasonably be expected to limit Parent's freedom of action with respect to, or
Parent's ability to retain any of the businesses, product lines or assets of,
the Company Business or otherwise receive the full benefits of
this Agreement.

  



  

(e) Nothing in this _Section 6.8_ shall limit a party's right to
terminate the Agreement pursuant to ARTICLE VIII so long as such party has
until such date complied in all material respects with its obligations under
this _Section 6.8_.

actions, and to do, or cause to be done, all things reasonably necessary,
appropriate or desirable to consummate and make effective, in the most
expeditious manner practicable, the Merger and the other Transactions,

reasonable efforts to obtain, prior to the Closing, and deliver to Parent, at
or prior to the Closing, all notices, consents, waivers and approvals under
each Contract listed or described in _Section 3.3(c)_ of the Company
Disclosure Schedule (and any Contract entered into after the date hereof that
would have been required to be listed or described in _Section 3.3(c)_ or
_Section 3.3(d)_ of the Company Disclosure Schedule if entered
into immediately prior to the date hereof), using a form reasonably
acceptable to Parent.

required to be given to the employees of the Company or any Company
Subsidiary under any Applicable Law in connection with the Transactions.

will give written prompt notice to the other of: (a) any fact, event or
circumstance known to it that (i) is reasonably likely, individually or taken
together with all other facts, events and circumstances known to it, to result
in any Company Material Adverse Effect or Parent Material Adverse Effect with
respect to it or (ii) would cause or constitute a material breach of any of
its representations, warranties, covenants or agreements contained herein
that reasonably could be expected to give rise, individually or in the
aggregate, to the failure of a condition in ARTICLE VII to be satisfied, (b)
the receipt of any (i) written notice from any third Person alleging that the
consent or approval of such Person is or may be required in connection with
the Merger and the Transactions or (ii) any notice or other communication
from any Governmental Entity in connection with the Transactions, or (c) any
Legal Proceeding commenced or, to its Knowledge, threatened against a party
hereto, or relating to or involving the Company, Parent or any of their
respective Subsidiaries that, relate to the Merger or other Transactions. No
notification given pursuant to this _Section 6.11_ shall affect the
representations, warranties, covenants or other agreements herein or affect
the satisfaction or non-satisfaction of any conditions to the obligations of
the parties hereto under this Agreement or otherwise limit or affect the
remedies available hereunder to the parties, and any failure to give notice
in accordance with the foregoing with respect to any breach shall not be
deemed to constitute a violation of this _Section 6.11_ or the failure of any
condition set forth in _Section 7.2_  or _Section 7.3_ to be satisfied, or
otherwise constitute a breach of this Agreement by the party failing to give
such notice, in each case unless the underlying breach would independent
result in a failure of the conditions set forth in _Section 7.2_  or _Section
7.3_ to be satisfied

immediately preceding sentence, Parent shall, or shall cause the Surviving
Corporation or other Affiliate of Parent, to provide to each Company Employee
whose employment is terminated by the Surviving Corporation (or Parent or any
of its Affiliates) without "cause" during the period commencing on the Closing
Date, and specifically excluding any voluntary resignation by any Company
Employee, and ending on the first anniversary of the Closing Date with the
severance payments and benefits to which the Company Employee would have been
entitled under the applicable severance pay plan of the Company and its
Subsidiaries listed in _Section 3.9(a)_ of the Company Disclosure Schedule
immediately prior to the Effective Time taking into account the Company
Employee's length of service with the Company and its Subsidiaries as
provided in _Section 6.12(b)_ , subject to the terms of the severance plan,
including the requirement to sign a waiver and release, if applicable.

  



  

(b) With respect to any "employee benefit plan" as defined in
Section 3(3) of ERISA maintained by Parent or any of the Parent Subsidiaries
in which a Company Employee will participate effective as of or after the
Effective Time (collectively, " _Parent Plans_ "), Parent shall recognize, or
cause to be recognized, all service of Company Employees with the Company or
any of the Company Subsidiaries (and any predecessors thereto) that is
reflected in the books and records of the Company or any of the Company
Subsidiaries, as the case may be, to the same extent and for the same purpose
as recognized by the Company immediately prior to the Closing Date, for
vesting, eligibility and level of benefits and benefit accrual in any Parent
Plan in which such Company Employees will be eligible to participate after
the Effective Time, in each case except to the extent that recognizing such
service would result in a duplication of benefits. To the extent any Company
Employee participates in a Parent Plan that provides medical, dental, or
other welfare benefits following the Closing Date (a " _Parent Welfare Plan_
"), Parent and such Parent Subsidiaries will use commercially reasonable
efforts to (i) cause all participation waiting periods and
preexisting condition and similar exclusions under each Parent Welfare Plan
that would otherwise be applicable to such Company Employee (and his or her
eligible spouse and dependents) to be waived to the same extent waived or
satisfied under the Company Employee Plan comparable to such Parent Welfare
Plan immediately prior to the Closing Date or, if later, immediately prior to
such Company Employee's commencement of participation in such Parent Welfare
Plan and (ii) provide each such Company Employee (and his or her
eligible spouse and dependents) with credit for any co-payments or
coinsurance and deductibles paid prior to the Closing Date (or, if
later, immediately prior to such Company Employee's commencement of
participation in such Parent Welfare Plan) under a Company Employee Plan (to
the same extent that such credit was given under the analogous Company
Employee Plan prior to the Closing Date or, if later, immediately prior to
such Company Employee's commencement of participation in such Parent Welfare
Plan) in satisfying any applicable deductible, co-payment, coinsurance or
maximum out-of-pocket requirements under the Parent Welfare Plans.

(c) Parent agrees to cause all Company Employee Plans to be honored
in accordance with their terms as of the date hereof, provided that this 
_Section 6.12(c)_ shall not be construed to limit the ability of Parent and
the Parent Subsidiaries to amend or terminate any Company Employee Plan to
the extent that such amendment or termination is permitted by the terms of the
applicable Company Employee Plan and Applicable Law.

  



  

(d) On or about the date that is five (5) Business Days prior to the

with the Merger, calculations prepared by an accounting firm showing the

such Company Disqualified Persons in connection with the Merger. No later

reasonable efforts to take any actions reasonably appropriate to mitigate
and/or minimize the impact of the tax consequences of Section 280G of the Code
(including but not limited to accelerating the payment of bonuses for 2017 so
that they are paid during 2017), provided that the terms of all Company
Employee Plans and all employment and severance agreements shall be honored,
except as otherwise agreed upon in writing by the affected Company
Disqualified Individuals.

  



  

Section 6.13 _Indemnification_.

  



  

(a) From and after the Effective Time, the Surviving Corporation
shall, for six (6) years after the Closing, indemnify and hold harmless each
individual who is as a former or present director, officer or employee of the
Company or any of the Company Subsidiaries or who is as of the date of this
Agreement, or who thereafter commences prior to the Effective Time, serving at
the request of the Company or any of the Company Subsidiaries as a director
or officer of another Person (including such individual's Affiliates, the "
_Indemnified Parties_ "), against all claims, losses, liabilities, damages,
judgments, inquiries, fines, fees, costs and expenses, including reasonable
attorneys' fees and disbursements, incurred in connection with any claim,
action, suit or proceeding, whether civil, criminal, administrative or
investigative (including with respect to matters, acts or omissions existing
or occurring at or prior to the Effective Time (including matters, acts or
omissions occurring in connection with the approval of this Agreement and the
transactions and actions contemplated hereby)), arising out of or pertaining
to the fact that the Indemnified Party (or such Indemnified Party's
Affiliate) is or was an officer, director or employee of the Company or any
of the Company Subsidiaries, is or was serving at the request of the Company
or any of the Company Subsidiaries as a director or officer of another person
or in respect of any acts or omissions in their capacities as such directors,
officers or employees occurring at or prior to the Effective Time, whether
asserted or claimed prior to, at or after the Effective Time, to the
fullest extent permitted by Applicable Law and to the extent permitted under
the Company's charter documents. Parent and the Surviving Corporation shall
also advance expenses incurred by an Indemnified Party to the fullest extent
permitted by Applicable Law and the Company's charter documents, provided,
that the Indemnified Party to whom expense are advanced provides and
undertaking to repay such advances if it is ultimately determined that such
Indemnified Party is not entitled to indemnification. Without limiting the
foregoing, at the Effective Time the Surviving Company shall, for a period of
six (6) years after the Closing Date, cause the certificate of incorporation
and bylaws or similar organizational documents of the Surviving Company to
maintain in effect provisions for limitation of liabilities of directors and
officers, indemnification, advancement of expenses and exculpation of the
Indemnified Parties no less favorable to the Indemnified Parties than as set
forth in the Company charter documents, in effect immediately prior to the
Effective Time, which provisions shall not be amended, repealed or otherwise
modified in a manner that would adversely affect the rights thereunder of the
individuals who immediately before the Effective Time were Indemnified Parties
except as required by Applicable Law.

Company Subsidiaries or provide substitute polices of not less than the
existing coverage and have other terms not less favorable to the insured
persons with respect to claims arising from facts or events that occurred on
or before the Effective Time (including the Transactions), except that in no
event shall Parent or the Surviving Corporation be required to pay with
respect to such insurance policies (or substitute insurance policies) of the
Company in respect of any one policy year more than 300% of the annual
premium payable by the Company for such insurance for the year ending December
31, 2016 (the " _Premium Cap_ "), and if Parent is unable to obtain the
insurance required by this _Section 6.13(b)_ it shall obtain as
much comparable insurance as possible for the years within such six-year

Company may obtain at or prior to the Effective Time a six-year "tail" policy
under the Company's existing directors and officers insurance policy
providing equivalent coverage to that described in the preceding sentence if
and to the extent that the same may be obtained for an amount that, on an
annual basis, does not exceed the Premium Cap. If the Company purchases such a
"tail" policy, Parent or the Surviving Corporation shall maintain such "tail"
policy in full force and effect and continue to honor its
obligations thereunder.

  



  

(c) The provisions of this _Section 6.13_ (i) shall survive

status thereof. The Company shall (a) give Parent the reasonable opportunity
to participate in the defense, settlement or prosecution of any Transaction

regarding or agree to compromise, settle, or come to an arrangement
regarding any Transaction Litigation or consent to the same unless Parent

(iii) In the event that (A) (x) this Agreement is terminated by either
Parent or the Company pursuant to _Section 8.1(b)(iii)_ , (y) this Agreement
is terminated by either Parent or the Company pursuant to _Section 8.1(a)_ ,
_Section 8.1(b)(i)_ or _Section 8.1(b)(ii)_ without the Company Shareholder
Approval having been obtained (and all other conditions set forth in
_Section 7.2_ and _Section 7.3_ have been satisfied or were capable of being
satisfied prior to such termination) or (z) this Agreement is terminated by
Parent pursuant to _Section 8.1(c)(i)_ as a result of the Company's fraud or
willful and material breach of any provision of this Agreement and without
the Company Shareholder Approval having been obtained (and all other
conditions set forth in _Section 7.2_ have been satisfied or were capable of
being satisfied prior to such termination), and (B) an Acquisition Proposal
shall have been made known to senior management of the Company or shall have
been publicly announced or shall have become publicly known and shall not
have been publicly withdrawn by a date that is at least fifteen (15) Business
Days prior to the Company Shareholder Meeting and (C) within twelve (12)
months of the termination of this Agreement, the Company enters into a
definitive agreement or consummates a transaction with respect to an
Acquisition Proposal (whether or not the same Acquisition Proposal as that
referred to in clause (B) hereof), then the Company shall, on the earlier of
the date it enters into such definitive agreement and the date of
consummation of such transaction, pay or cause to be paid to or as directed by
Parent the Termination Fee, by wire transfer of immediately available funds

purposes of this _Section 8.3(d)(iii)_ , all references in the definition of
Acquisition Proposal to "25%" shall instead refer to "50%".

  



  

(e) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary herein, but without
limiting the right of any party to recover liabilities or damages arising out
of the other party\'s fraud or willful and material breach of any provision
of this Agreement, in the event that the Company is required to pay to or as
directed by Parent the Termination Fee pursuant to _Section 8.3(d)_ , the
maximum aggregate amount of monetary fees, liabilities or damages payable by
the Company under this Agreement shall be equal to the Termination Fee. Each
of the parties hereto acknowledges that, subject to _Section 8.2_ , payment
of the Termination Fee is not intended to be a penalty, but rather are
liquidated damages in a reasonable amount that will compensate Parent, as the
case may be, in the circumstances in which payment of such Termination Fee is
due and payable, for the efforts and resources expended and opportunities
foregone while negotiating this Agreement and in reliance on this Agreement
and on the expectation of the consummation of the Transactions, which amount
would otherwise be impossible to calculate with precision. Each of the
Company, Parent and Merger Sub acknowledges that the agreements contained in
_Section 8.3(d)_ and _Section 8.3(e)_ are an integral part of the transactions
contemplated hereby, and that, without these agreements, the Company, Parent
and Merger Sub would not enter into this Agreement.

Fee may be payable under more than one provision of this Agreement at the
same or at different time and the occurrence of different events.

any Exhibit but not otherwise defined therein shall have the meaning set forth
in this Agreement. The words "include," "includes" or "including" are to be
deemed followed by the words "without limitation." The words "herein,"
"hereof" or "hereunder" and similar terms are to be deemed to refer to
this Agreement as a whole and not to any specific Section. All references to
"dollars" or "$" in this Agreement are to United States dollars. This
Agreement is the product of negotiation by the parties, having the assistance
of counsel and other advisors, and the parties intend that this Agreement not
be construed more strictly with regard to one party than with regard to any
other party.

  



  

Section 9.6 _Counterparts_. This Agreement may be executed in two
or more counterparts (including by facsimile or other electronic means), all
of which shall be considered one and the same agreement and shall become
effective when counterparts have been signed by each of the parties and
delivered to the other party, it being understood that each party need not
sign the same counterpart.

  



  

Section 9.7 _Entire Agreement_. This Agreement (including the
documents and the instruments referred to in this Agreement), together with
the Confidentiality Agreement, Company Disclosure Schedule and Parent
Disclosure Schedule, constitutes the entire agreement and supersedes all prior
agreements, arrangements, communications and understandings, both written and
oral, between the parties with respect to the subject matter thereof.

  



  

Section 9.8 _Governing Law; Jurisdiction_. This Agreement and all
disputes or controversies arising out of or relating to this Agreement or the
transactions contemplated hereby shall be governed by, and construed in
accordance with, the internal laws of the State of New York, without regard to
the laws of any other jurisdiction that might be applied because of the
conflicts of laws principles of the State of New York; provided, that
matters relating to the fiduciary duties of the Company's board of directors
shall be governed by the internal laws of the State of Pennsylvania. Each

under this Agreement or the Merger that are the subject of this Agreement, (a)
irrevocably submits to the exclusive jurisdiction of the Chosen Courts, (b)
waives any objection to laying venue in any such action or proceeding in the
Chosen Courts, (c) waives any objection that the Chosen Courts are an

be effective if notice is given in accordance with _Section 9.4_.

  



    

 | \- 84 -|

Section 9.9 _Waiver of Jury Trial_. Each party hereto
acKnowledges and agrees that any controversy that may arise under this
Agreement is likely to involve complicated and difficult issues, and
therefore each party hereby irrevocably and unconditionally waives any right
such party may have to a trial by jury in respect of any litigation, directly
or indirectly, arising out of, or relating to, this Agreement, or the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement. Each party certifies and
acKnowledges that (a) no representative, agent or attorney of any other party
has represented, expressly or otherwise, that such other party would not, in
the event of litigation, seek to enforce the foregoing waiver, (b) each party
understands and has considered the implications of this waiver, (c) each party
makes this waiver voluntarily, and (d) each party has been induced to enter
into this Agreement by, among other things, the mutual waivers and
certifications in this _Section 9.9_.

  



  

Section 9.10 _Assignment; Third-Party Beneficiaries_. Neither this
Agreement nor any of the rights, interests or obligations under this
Agreement shall be assigned by either of the parties (whether by operation of
law or otherwise) without the prior written consent of the other party, except
for assignments by Merger Sub to a wholly owned direct or indirect Subsidiary
of Parent. Any purported assignment in contravention hereof shall be null and
void. Subject to the preceding sentence, this Agreement shall be binding
upon, inure to the benefit of and be enforceable by each of the parties
and their respective successors and assigns. Except for _Section 6.6_ , which
is intended to benefit each Indemnified Person and his or her heirs and
representatives, this Agreement (including the documents and instruments
referred to in this Agreement) is not intended to and does not confer upon
any person other than the parties hereto any rights or remedies, express or
implied, under this Agreement. The representations and warranties in this
Agreement are the product of negotiations among the parties hereto and are
for the sole benefit of the parties. Any inaccuracies in such representations
and warranties are subject to waiver by the parties hereto in accordance
herewith without notice or liability to any other person. In some instances,
the representations and warranties in this Agreement may represent an
allocation among the parties hereto of risks associated with particular
matters regardless of the Knowledge of any of the parties hereto.
Consequently, persons other than the parties may not rely upon the
representations and warranties in this Agreement as characterizations of
actual facts or circumstances as of the date of this Agreement or as of any
other date.

  



  

Section 9.11 _Specific Performance_. The parties agree that
irreparable damage would occur in the event that any of the provisions of
this Agreement were not performed in accordance with their specific terms or
were otherwise breached. Accordingly, each of the parties shall be entitled to
seek specific performance of the terms hereof including an injunction or
injunctions to prevent breaches of this Agreement and to seek to enforce
specifically the terms and provisions of this Agreement, this being in
addition to any other remedy to which such party is entitled at law or in
equity.

  



  

Section 9.12 _Disclosure Schedule_. Before entry into this
Agreement, the Company delivered to Parent a schedule (the " _Company
Disclosure Schedule_ ") and Parent delivered to the Company a schedule (the "
_Parent Disclosure Schedule_ "), in each case that sets forth, among other
things, items the disclosure of which is necessary or appropriate either in
response to an express disclosure requirement contained in a provision hereof
or as an exception to one or more representations or warranties contained in
ARTICLE III or ARTICLE IV, as applicable, or to one or more covenants
contained herein; provided, however, that notwithstanding anything in this
Agreement to the contrary, the mere inclusion of an item as an exception to a
representation or warranty shall not be deemed an admission that such item
represents a material exception or material fact, event or circumstance or
that such item has had or would be reasonably likely to have a Material
Adverse Effect.

portion of any provision of this Agreement shall be interpreted in such
manner as to be effective and valid under Applicable Law, but if any
provision or portion of any provision of this Agreement is held to be invalid,

affect any other provision or portion of any provision in such jurisdiction,
and this Agreement shall be reformed, construed and enforced in such
jurisdiction as if such invalid, illegal or unenforceable provision or
portion of any provision had never been contained herein.

negotiations among the parties of drafts of this Agreement, this Agreement
shall not constitute or be deemed to be evidence of a Contract between the
parties hereto unless and until this Agreement is executed by all parties

VOTING AGREEMENT

  



  

This VOTING AGREEMENT (this "Agreement"), is dated as of August 2, 2017, by
and between SIERRA WIRELESS, INC., a Canadian corporation ("Parent"), and [●]
("Shareholder").

  



  

WHEREAS, in connection with Parent and Wireless Acquisition Sub, Inc., a
Delaware corporation ("Merger Sub"), entering into an Agreement and Plan of
Merger, dated as of the date hereof (the "Merger Agreement"), with Numerex
Corp., a Pennsylvania corporation (the "Company"), Parent has requested
Shareholder, and Shareholder has agreed, to enter into this Agreement with
respect to all shares of Class A Common Stock, no par value per share, of the
Company (the "Company Common Stock") that Shareholder beneficially owns (such
shares, together with all other shares of Company Common Stock
acquired (whether beneficially or of record) by Shareholder after the date
hereof and prior to the earlier of the Effective Time (as defined in the
Merger Agreement) and the Termination Date (but excluding any shares of the
Company sold or transferred on or after the date hereof in compliance with
_Section 4.01(b)_ ), the "Shares");

  



  

WHEREAS, capitalized terms used but not otherwise defined herein shall have
the respective meanings set forth in the Merger Agreement; and

  



  

WHEREAS, Shareholder acknowledges that Parent and Merger Sub are entering
into the Merger Agreement in reliance on the representations,
warranties, covenants and other agreements of Shareholder set forth in this
Agreement.

  



  

NOW, THEREFORE, in consideration of the representations, warranties,
covenants and other agreements contained in this Agreement and other good
and valuable consideration, the receipt and sufficiency of which are hereby
acknowledged, and intending to be legally bound hereby, the parties agree as
follows:

  



  

Article I _ 
  
 Voting Agreement_

  



  

Section 1.01 _Voting Agreement_. During the term of this Agreement,
Shareholder hereby agrees to vote or, as applicable, cause or direct to be
voted, all Shares at the time of any vote (A) to approve and adopt the
Merger Agreement and the Merger and in favor of the Company Shareholder
Advisory Vote at the Company Shareholder Meeting, and at any adjournment or
postponement thereof, at which such Merger Agreement is submitted for the
consideration and vote of the shareholders of the Company and (B) against (i)
any Acquisition Proposal and (ii) any other action, agreement or transaction
that would reasonably be expected to materially impede, interfere with, delay
or postpone the Merger or any other transaction contemplated in the
Merger Agreement; _provided_ , that each of Shareholder's voting obligation
set forth in this _Section 1.01_ and Shareholder's appointment of Parent as
its proxy and attorney-in-fact pursuant to S _ection 1.02(a)_ will be
suspended for so long as the Company's board of directors is not recommending
that shareholders of the Company vote in favor of the Merger. For the
avoidance of doubt, each of Shareholder's voting obligation set forth in this
_Section 1.01_ and Shareholder's appointment of Parent as its proxy and
attorney-in-fact pursuant to _Section 1.02(a)_ will be in full force at any
time that the Company's board of directors is recommending that shareholders
of the Company vote in favor of the Merger. Shareholder hereby revokes
any and all previous proxies or powers of attorney granted with respect to
the Shares. Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the contrary,
except as specifically set forth in this Agreement, each Shareholder will
continue to hold and shall have the right to exercise all voting rights
related to such Shareholder's Shares.

  



    



 



    



  

Section 1.02 _Grant of Irrevocable Proxy; Appointment of Proxy_.

  



  

(a) Shareholder hereby irrevocably appoints Parent as its proxy and
attorney-in-fact (with full power of substitution), to vote or, as
applicable, cause or direct to be voted (including by proxy, if applicable),
the Shares in accordance with _Section 1.01_ above at the Company Shareholder
Meeting, including any adjournment or postponement thereof, at which any of
the matters described in _Section 1.01_ above is to be considered, in each
case prior to the Termination Date; _provided_ , _however_ , that such
irrevocable proxy shall be effective (automatically and without any further
action by any of the parties hereto) only upon written notice from Parent to
Shareholder no later than five (5) business days prior to the Company
Shareholder Meeting notifying Shareholder of Parent's election to effect the
proxy described in this _Section 1.02_ (the "Parent Proxy Election"), it being
understood that Shareholder may exercise voting rights in the ordinary course
prior to such notice in a manner consistent with _Section 1.01_. Shareholder
represents that all proxies, powers of attorney, instructions or other
requests given by Shareholder prior to the execution of this Agreement in
respect of the voting of any of the Shares, if any, are not irrevocable.
Shareholder shall take such further action or execute such other instruments
as may be necessary to effectuate the intent of this proxy.

  



  

(b) Shareholder affirms that, if the Parent Proxy Election is made
pursuant to _Section 1.02(a)_ , such irrevocable proxy is given in
connection with the execution of the Merger Agreement, and that such
irrevocable proxy is given to secure the performance of the duties
of Shareholder under this Agreement. Shareholder further affirms that such
irrevocable proxy is coupled with an interest and is intended to be
irrevocable during the term of this Agreement. If for any reason any proxy
granted herein is not irrevocable, then Shareholder agrees to vote the Shares
in accordance with _Section 1.01_ above. The parties hereto agree that the
foregoing is a voting agreement.

  



  

(c) The proxy granted by each Shareholder in this _Section 1.02_
shall automatically terminate without any further action required by any
person upon termination of the Agreement.

provisions hereof shall (i) result in, or give rise to, a violation or breach
of or a default under any of the terms of any material contract,
understanding, agreement or other instrument or obligation to which the
Shareholder is a party or by which the Shareholder or any of the Shares or its
assets may be bound or (ii) violate any applicable order, writ, injunction,

Enforceability_. Parent is duly organized, validly existing and in
good standing under the laws of Canada. The execution and delivery of this
Agreement by Parent, the consummation by Parent of the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement and the compliance by Parent with
the provisions of this Agreement have been duly authorized by all necessary
corporate action on the part of Parent and its governing body or stockholders,

each Stockholder, constitutes a valid and binding obligation of Parent,
enforceable against Parent in accordance with its terms, except to the extent
that enforceability may be limited by (i) applicable bankruptcy, insolvency,
reorganization, moratorium, fraudulent conveyance or other similar laws now or
hereafter in effect relating to creditors' rights generally, and (ii) general
principles of equity.

Section 5.06 _Specific Performance_. Each party acknowledges that
monetary damages would not be an adequate remedy in the event that any
covenant or agreement in this Agreement is not performed in accordance with
its terms, and therefore agrees that, in addition to and without limiting any
other remedy or right available to the parties, each party will have the
right to an injunction, temporary restraining order or other equitable relief
in any court of competent jurisdiction enjoining any such breach and
enforcing specifically the terms and provisions hereof. Each party agrees not
to oppose the granting of such relief in the event a court determines that
such a breach has occurred, and to waive any requirement for the securing or
posting of any bond in connection with such remedy. All rights, powers, and
remedies provided under this Agreement or otherwise available in respect
hereof at law or in equity shall be cumulative and not alternative, and the
exercise or beginning of the exercise of any thereof by a party shall not
preclude the simultaneous or later exercise of any other such right, power or
remedy by a party.

  



  

Section 5.07 _Counterparts; Effectiveness_. This Agreement may be
signed in any number of counterparts, each of which shall be an original,
with the same effect as if the signatures thereto and hereto were upon the
same instrument. This Agreement shall become effective when each party hereto
shall have received counterparts hereof signed by all of the other parties
hereto. Until and unless each party has received (by electronic communication,
facsimile or otherwise) a counterpart hereof signed by the other party
hereto, this Agreement shall have no effect and no party shall have any right
or obligation hereunder (whether by virtue of any other oral or written
agreement or other communication). Signatures to this Agreement transmitted
by facsimile transmission, by electronic mail in "portable document format"
(".pdf") form or by any other electronic means intended to preserve the
original graphic and pictorial appearance of a document, will have the same
effect as physical delivery of the paper document bearing the original
signature.

  



  

Section 5.08 _ Severability_. If any term, provision or covenant of
this Agreement is held by a court of competent jurisdiction or other
authority to be invalid, void or unenforceable, the remainder of the
terms, provisions and covenants of this Agreement shall remain in full force
and effect and shall in no way be affected, impaired or invalidated. If a
final judgment of a court of competent jurisdiction declares that any term or
provision of this Agreement is invalid or unenforceable, the parties hereto
agree that the court making such determination shall have the power to limit
such term or provision, to delete specific words or phrases or to replace
such term or provision with a term or provision that is valid and enforceable
and that comes closest to expressing the intention of the invalid or
unenforceable term or provision, and this Agreement shall be valid and
enforceable as so modified. In the event such court does not exercise the
power granted to it in the prior sentence, the parties hereto agree to
replace such invalid or unenforceable term or provision with a valid and
enforceable term or provision that will achieve, to the extent possible, the
economic, business and other purposes of such invalid or unenforceable term or
provision.

  



  

Section 5.09 _Capacity_. Shareholder is signing this Agreement
solely in Shareholder's capacity as a shareholder of the Company, and not in
any other capacity and this Agreement shall not limit or otherwise affect any
actions taken, or required or permitted to be taken, by Shareholder or any
Affiliate, employee, designee or Representative of Shareholder or any of its
Affiliates in any other capacity, including, if applicable, as an officer or
director of the Company or any of the Company Subsidiaries, including to
disclose information acquired solely in such Shareholder's capacity as a
director or officer of the Company, and any actions taken (whatsoever), or
failure to take any actions (whatsoever), by such Shareholder in such
capacity as a director or officer of the Company shall not be deemed to
constitute a breach of this Agreement.

Section 5.10 _Non-Recourse_. Each party to this Agreement enters
into this Agreement solely on its own behalf, the obligations each Shareholder
under this Agreement are several (with respect to itself) and not joint with
the obligations of any other Shareholder and each such party shall be
liable, severally and not jointly, solely for any breaches of this Agreement
by such party and in no event shall any party be liable for breaches of this
Agreement by any other party hereto. Nothing contained herein, and no action
taken by any Shareholder pursuant hereto, shall be deemed to constitute the
parties as a partnership, an association, a joint venture or any other kind of
entity, or create a presumption that the parties are in any way acting in
concert or as a group with respect to the obligations or the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement.

  



  

Section 5.11 _No Agreement Until Executed_. Irrespective of
negotiations among the parties of drafts of this Agreement, this Agreement
shall not constitute or be deemed to be evidence of a Contract between the
parties hereto unless and until this Agreement and the Merger Agreement is
executed by all parties hereto.
