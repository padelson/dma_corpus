accordance with Section 1.1, on the terms and subject to the conditions of
this Agreement and in accordance with the Delaware General Corporation Law
(the " _DGCL_ ") and the Delaware Limited Liability Company Act (the " _LLC
Act_ ");

WHEREAS, the Board of Directors of Parent, by resolutions duly adopted,
has (i) approved this Agreement and the transactions contemplated hereby
(which includes the Initial Merger and the Subsequent Merger (collectively,
the " _Mergers_ ")) and the issuance of shares of common stock, par value

WHEREAS, the sole member of Merger LLC will approve the Subsequent Merger upon

WHEREAS, the Company, Parent, Corporate Sub and Merger LLC desire to make
certain representations, warranties, covenants and agreements in connection
with this Agreement. NOW, THEREFORE, in consideration of the premises, and of the representations,
warranties, covenants and agreements contained herein, the parties hereto
agree as follows:

ARTICLE I

 

THE MERGER; CLOSING; EFFECTIVE TIME

 

1.1 _The Merger_ _s_. (a) Upon the terms and subject to the conditions set
forth in this Agreement, at the First Effective Time, Corporate Sub shall be
merged with and into the Company and the separate corporate existence of
Corporate Sub shall thereupon cease. The Company shall be the surviving
company in the Initial Merger, and the separate corporate existence of
the Company with all its rights, privileges, immunities, powers and
franchises shall continue unaffected by the Initial Merger, except as set
forth in Article II. The Initial Merger shall have the effects specified in
the DGCL.

 

(b) Immediately following the Initial Merger, upon the terms and subject to
the conditions set forth in this Agreement, at the Second Effective Time, the
Initial Surviving Company shall be merged with and into Merger LLC and the
separate corporate existence of the Initial Surviving Company shall thereupon
cease. Merger LLC shall be the surviving company in the Subsequent Merger
(the " _Final Surviving Entity_ "), and the separate company existence of
Merger LLC with all its rights, privileges, immunities, powers and franchises
shall continue unaffected by the Subsequent Merger, except as set forth
in Article II. The Subsequent Merger shall have the effects specified in the
DGCL and the LLC Act.

(c) For U.S. federal income tax purposes, the parties hereto intend that (i)
the Initial Merger and the Subsequent Merger be treated as a single integrated
transaction that will qualify as a "reorganization" within the meaning of
Section 368(a) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the " _Code_
"), and the regulations promulgated thereunder, (ii) Parent and the Company
each be a party to the reorganization within the meaning of Section 368(b) of
the Code and (iii) this Agreement will constitute a "plan of reorganization"
within the meaning of the Code (clauses (i)-(iii) collectively, the "
_Intended Tax Treatment_ ").

 

1.2 _Closing_. The closing of the Mergers (the " _Closing_ ") shall take place
(a) at the offices of Sullivan and Cromwell LLP, 125 Broad Street, New York,
New York 10004, as soon as reasonably practicable, and in no event later than
the third business day, following the day on which the last to be satisfied or
waived of each of the conditions set forth in Article VII (other than those
conditions that by their nature are to be satisfied at the Closing, but
subject to the satisfaction or waiver of those conditions) shall have been
satisfied or waived in accordance with this Agreement, or (b) at such other
place and time and/or on such other date as the Company and Parent may
otherwise agree in writing (the date on which the Closing occurs, the "
_Closing Date_ "). For purposes of this Agreement, the term " _business day_
" shall mean any day of the year on which banks are not required or authorized
by Law to close in New York City, and on which dealings are carried on in the
London interbank market and banks are open for business in London.

 



-2- 1.3 _Effective Time_. Immediately following the Closing, the Company and
Parent will cause a Certificate of Merger with respect to the Initial Merger
(the " _First Certificate of Merger_ ") to be executed, acknowledged and filed
with the Secretary of State of the State of Delaware as provided in the DGCL.
The Initial Merger shall become effective at the time when the Delaware
Certificate of Merger has been duly filed with the Secretary of State of the
State of Delaware or at such later time as may be agreed upon by the parties
hereto in writing and set forth in the First Certificate of Merger in

any action on the part of the holder of any capital stock of the Company,
Parent, Corporate Sub or Merger LLC:

 



-4- (i) _Merger Consideration_. Each share of Common Stock, par value $0.01 per
share, of the Company (the " _Common Stock_ ," and each a " _Share_ " and

the First Effective Time (other than (i) Shares owned by Parent or
the Company, in each case not held on behalf of third parties, and (ii)
Shares that are owned by stockholders (" _Dissenting Stockholders_ ") who have
perfected and not withdrawn a demand for appraisal rights pursuant to Section
262 of the DGCL (each such Share referred to in clauses (i) and (ii) above,
an " _Excluded Share_ " and, collectively, " _Excluded Shares_ ")) shall be
converted into the right to receive a number of validly issued, fully paid
and non-assessable shares of Parent Common Stock equal to the Exchange Ratio
(the " _Stock Consideration_ ") _plus_ $53.75 in cash (the " _Cash
Consideration_ " and, together with the Stock Consideration, the " _Merger
Consideration_ "). At the First Effective Time, all the Shares (other than the
Excluded Shares) shall cease to be outstanding, shall be cancelled and shall
cease to exist, and (A) each certificate (a " _Certificate_ ") formerly
representing any of the Shares (other than Excluded Shares) and (B) each book-
entry account formerly representing any uncertificated Shares ("
_Uncertificated_ _Shares_ ") (other than Excluded Shares) shall thereafter
represent only the right to receive the Merger Consideration and, in each
case, the right, if any, to receive pursuant to Section 4.2(e) cash in lieu of
fractional shares into which such Shares have been converted pursuant to this
Section 4.1(a) and any distribution or dividend pursuant to Section 4.2(c),
and each Certificate and Uncertificated Share formerly representing Shares
owned by Dissenting Stockholders shall thereafter represent only the right
to receive the payment of which reference is made in Section 4.3.

As used in this Agreement, the term " _Exchange Ratio_ " means the following
(in each case rounded to three decimal places):



     | I. | if the Average Parent Stock Price is an amount greater than
$41.349, then the Exchange Ratio shall be 1.300; 
---|---|--- 



     | II. | if the Average Parent Stock Price is an amount greater than
or equal to $37.411 but less than or equal to $41.349 then the Exchange Ratio
shall be an amount equal to the quotient obtained by _dividing_ (x) $53.75 by
(y) the Average Parent Stock Price; or 
---|---|--- 



     | III. | if the Average Parent Stock Price is an amount less than
$37.411, then the Exchange Ratio shall be 1.437. 
---|---|--- 

As used in this Agreement, the term " _Average Parent Stock Price_ " means
the average of the volume weighted averages of the trading prices of Parent
Common Stock on the New York Stock Exchange (the " _NYSE_ ") (as reported by
Bloomberg L.P. or, if not reported therein, in another authoritative source
mutually selected by the parties) on each of the 15 consecutive Trading Days
ending on (and including) the Trading Day that is three Trading Days prior to
the date of the First Effective Time.

As used in this Agreement, the term " _Trading Day_ " means a day on which
shares of Parent Common Stock are traded on the NYSE.

 



-5- (ii) _Cancellation of Excluded Shares_. Subject to Section 4.3, each Excluded
Share shall, by virtue of the Initial Merger and without any action on the
part of the Company, Parent, Merger Subs or the holder thereof, cease to be
outstanding, shall be cancelled without payment of any consideration therefor
and shall cease to exist. 

(iii) _Corporate_ _Sub_. Each share of common stock, par value $0.01 per
share, of Corporate Sub issued and outstanding immediately prior to the First
Effective Time shall be converted into one share of common stock, par value
$0.01 per share, of the Initial Surviving Company.

 

(b) _Subsequent Merger_. At the Second Effective Time, each Initial Surviving
Company share issued and outstanding immediately prior to the Second
Effective Time shall be cancelled and shall cease to exist and no
consideration shall be paid or payable in respect thereof and each limited
liability company interest of Merger LLC shall be unaffected by the Subsequent
Merger and shall remain outstanding as a limited liability company interest
of the Final Surviving Entity.

4.2 _Exchange of Certificates_.

 

(a) _Exchange Agent_. At the First Effective Time, Parent shall deposit, or
cause to be deposited, with an exchange agent selected by Parent with the
Companys prior approval, which shall not be unreasonably withheld or delayed
(the " _Exchange Agent_ "), for the benefit of the holders of Shares, (i) an
aggregate number of shares of Parent Common Stock to be issued in
uncertificated form or book-entry form and (ii) an aggregate amount of cash,
in each case, comprising approximately the amounts required to be delivered
pursuant to Section 4.1(a) in respect of Shares. In addition, Parent
shall deposit, or cause to be deposited, with the Exchange Agent, as
necessary from time to time after the First Effective Time, any dividends or
other distributions payable pursuant to Section 4.2(c) with respect to the
Parent Common Stock issued pursuant to the Initial Merger with respect to
Shares with a record and payment date after the First Effective Time and prior
to the surrender of such Shares and cash in lieu of any fractional shares
payable pursuant to Section 4.2(e). All shares of Parent Common Stock and
cash, together with the amount of any dividends and distributions deposited
with the Exchange Agent pursuant to this Section 4.2(a), shall hereinafter be
referred to as the " _Exchange Fund_ ". The Exchange Agent shall invest the
cash portion of the Exchange Fund as directed by Parent; _provided_ that such
investments shall be in obligations, funds or accounts typical for (including
having liquidity typical for) transactions of this nature. To the extent that
there are losses with respect to such investments, or the Exchange Fund
diminishes for other reasons below the level required to make prompt cash
payment of the aggregate cash portion of the Merger Consideration
as contemplated hereby, Parent shall promptly replace or restore the cash in
the Exchange Fund lost through such investments or other events so as to
ensure that the Exchange Fund is at all times maintained at a level sufficient
to make such cash payments. Any interest and other income resulting from such
investment shall become a part of the Exchange Fund, and any amounts in excess
of the amounts payable under this Section 4.2(a) shall be promptly returned to
Parent.

 



-6- (b) _Exchange Procedures_. Promptly after the First Effective Time (and in any
event within four business days thereafter), Parent shall cause the Exchange
Agent to mail to each holder of record of Certificates (other than Excluded
Shares) a letter of transmittal in customary form advising such holder of the
effectiveness of the Merger and the conversion of its Shares into the right
to receive the Merger Consideration, and specifying that delivery shall be
effected, and risk of loss and title to the Certificates shall pass, only upon
delivery of the Certificates (or affidavits of loss in lieu of the
Certificates as provided in Section 4.2(g)) and instructions for use in
effecting the surrender of the Certificates (or affidavits of loss in lieu of
the Certificates as provided in Section 4.2(g)). Upon the surrender of a
Certificate (or affidavit of loss in lieu thereof as provided in Section
4.2(g)) to the Exchange Agent in accordance with the terms of such transmittal
materials, the holder of such Certificate shall be entitled to receive in
exchange therefor (i) that number of whole shares of Parent Common Stock that
such holder is entitled to receive pursuant to this Article IV in
uncertificated form (or evidence of shares in book-entry form), and (ii) an
amount in immediately available funds (or, if no wire transfer instructions
are provided, a check, and in each case, after giving effect to any required
Tax withholding provided in Section 4.2(h)) equal to (A) the cash amount that
such holder is entitled to receive pursuant to Section 4.1(a) plus (B) any
cash in lieu of fractional shares pursuant to Section 4.2(e) plus (C) any
unpaid non-stock dividends and any other dividends or other distributions that
such holder has the right to receive pursuant to Section 4.2(c), and the
Certificate so surrendered shall forthwith be cancelled. No interest will be
paid or accrued on any amount payable upon due surrender of the Certificates.
In the event of a transfer of ownership of Shares that is not registered in
the transfer records of the Company, the proper number of shares of Parent
Common Stock in uncertificated form, together with a check for any cash to be
paid upon due surrender of the Certificate and any other dividends or
distributions in respect thereof, may be issued and/or paid to such a
transferee if the Certificate formerly representing such Shares is presented
to the Exchange Agent, accompanied by all documents required to evidence and
effect such transfer and to evidence that any applicable stock transfer taxes
have been paid or are not applicable. If any shares (or evidence of shares in
book-entry form) of Parent Common Stock are to be issued to a name other than
that in which the Certificate surrendered in exchange therefor is
registered, it shall be a condition of such exchange that the Person
requesting such exchange shall pay any stock transfer or other Taxes required
by reason of the issuance of shares (or evidence of shares in book-entry form)
of Parent Common Stock in a name other than that of the registered holder of
the Certificate surrendered, or shall establish to the satisfaction of Parent
or the Exchange Agent that such Taxes have been paid or are not applicable.
For the purposes of this Agreement, the term " _Person_ " shall mean any
individual, corporation (including not-for-profit), general or limited
partnership, limited liability company, joint venture, estate, trust,
association, organization, Governmental Entity or other entity of any kind or
nature.

(c) _Distributions with Respect to Unexchanged Shares; Voting_. (i) All shares
of Parent Common Stock to be issued pursuant to the Initial Merger shall be
deemed issued and outstanding as of the First Effective Time and whenever a
dividend or other distribution is declared by Parent in respect of the Parent
Common Stock, the record date for which is after the First Effective Time,
that declaration shall include dividends or other distributions in respect of
all shares of Parent Common Stock issuable in the Initial Merger. No dividends
or other

 



-7-  distributions in respect of the Parent Common Stock issued pursuant to the
Initial Merger shall be paid to any holder of any unsurrendered Certificate
until such Certificate (or affidavit of loss in lieu thereof as provided in
Section 4.2(g)) is surrendered for exchange in accordance with this Article
IV. Subject to the effect of applicable Laws, following surrender of any such
Certificate (or affidavit of loss in lieu thereof as provided in Section
4.2(g)), there shall be issued and/or paid to the holder of the whole shares
of Parent Common Stock issued in exchange therefor, without interest thereon,
(A) at the time of such surrender, the dividends or other distributions with
a record date after the First Effective Time theretofore payable with respect
to such whole shares of Parent Common Stock and not paid and (B) at the
appropriate payment date, the dividends or other distributions payable with
respect to such whole shares of Parent Common Stock with a record date after
the First Effective Time, but with a payment date subsequent to surrender.

 

(ii) Registered holders of unsurrendered Certificates shall be entitled to
vote after the First Effective Time at any meeting of Parent stockholders
with a record date at or after the First Effective Time the number of whole
shares of Parent Common Stock represented by such Certificates, regardless of
whether such holders have exchanged their Certificates.

 

(d) _Transfers_. From and after the First Effective Time, there shall be no
transfers on the stock transfer books of the Company of the Shares that were
outstanding immediately prior to the First Effective Time.

(e) _Fractional Shares_. Notwithstanding any other provision of this
Agreement, no fractional shares of Parent Common Stock will be issued and any
holder of Shares, Company Director Restricted Stock Units and Company
Performance Stock Units entitled to receive a fractional share of
Parent Common Stock but for this Section 4.2(e) shall be entitled to receive
a cash payment in lieu thereof, which payment shall be calculated by the
Exchange Agent and shall represent such holders proportionate interest in a
share of Parent Common Stock based on the Average Parent Stock Price.

(f) _Termination of Exchange Fund_. Any portion of the Exchange Fund
(including the proceeds of any investments of the Exchange Fund and any
Parent Common Stock) that remains unclaimed by the stockholders of the Company
for 180 days after the First Effective Time shall be delivered, at Parents
option, to Parent. Any holder of Shares (other than Excluded Shares) who has
not theretofore complied with this Article IV shall thereafter look only to
Parent for delivery of any shares of Parent Common Stock and payment of cash
and any dividends and other distributions in respect of the Parent Common
Stock to be issued or paid pursuant to the provisions of this Article IV
(after giving effect to any required Tax withholdings as provided in Section
4.2(h)) upon due surrender of its Certificates (or affidavits of loss in lieu
of the Certificates as provided in Section 4.2(g)), without any interest
thereon. Notwithstanding the foregoing, none of the Initial Surviving Company,
Merger LLC, Parent, the Exchange Agent or any other Person shall be liable to
any former holder of Shares for any amount properly delivered to a public
official pursuant to applicable abandoned property, escheat or similar Laws.
To the fullest extent permitted by Law, immediately prior to the date any
Merger Consideration would otherwise escheat to or become the property of any
Governmental Entity, such Merger Consideration shall become the property of
the Final Surviving Entity, free and clear of all claims or interest of any
Person previously entitled thereto.

 



-8- (g) _Lost, Stolen or Destroyed Certificates_. In the event any Certificate
shall have been lost, stolen or destroyed, upon the making of an affidavit of
that fact by the Person claiming such Certificate to be lost, stolen or
destroyed and, if required by Parent, the posting by such Person of a bond in
customary amount and upon such terms as may be required by Parent as
indemnity against any claim that may be made against it, the Exchange Agent or
the Final Surviving Entity with respect to such Certificate, the Exchange
Agent will issue in exchange for such lost, stolen or destroyed Certificate
the shares of Parent Common Stock and the cash and any dividends and other
distributions in respect of the Parent Common Stock that would have been
issuable or payable pursuant to the provisions of this Article IV
(after giving effect to any required Tax withholdings as provided in Section
4.2(h)) had such lost, stolen or destroyed Certificate been surrendered.

 

(h) _Withholding Rights_. Each of Parent and the Merger Subs shall be entitled
to deduct and withhold from the consideration otherwise payable pursuant to
this Agreement to any holder of Shares such amounts as it is required to
deduct and withhold with respect to the making of such payment under the Code,
or any other applicable state, local or foreign Tax Law. To the extent that
amounts are so withheld by the Merger Subs or Parent, as the case may be, such
withheld amounts (i) shall be remitted by Parent or the Merger Subs, as
applicable, to the applicable Governmental Entity, and (ii) shall be treated
for all purposes of this Agreement as having been paid to the holder of
Shares in respect of which such deduction and withholding was made by the
Merger Subs or Parent, as the case may be.

 

(i) _Uncertificated Shares_. Promptly after the First Effective Time, Parent
shall cause the Exchange Agent to (i) mail to each holder of Uncertificated
Shares (other than Excluded Shares) materials advising such holder of the
effectiveness of the Initial Merger and the conversion of its Shares into the
right to receive the Merger Consideration and (ii) issue in registered form
to each holder of Uncertificated Shares that number of whole shares of Parent
Common Stock that such holder is entitled to receive in respect of each such
Uncertificated Share pursuant to this Article IV, cash that such holder
is entitled to receive in respect of its Shares pursuant to Section 4.1(a),
cash pursuant to Section 4.2(e) in lieu of fractional shares in respect of
each such Uncertificated Share and any dividends and other distributions in
respect of the Parent Common Stock to be issued or paid pursuant to the
provisions of this Article IV (after giving effect to any required Tax
withholdings as provided in Section 4.2(h)), without interest thereon.

 

4.3 _Dissenters_ __ _Rights_. No Dissenting Stockholder shall be entitled to
receive shares of Parent Common Stock or cash or any dividends or other
distributions pursuant to the provisions of this Article IV unless and until
the holder thereof shall have failed to perfect or shall have effectively
withdrawn or lost such holders right to dissent from the Initial Merger
under the DGCL, and any Dissenting Stockholder shall be entitled to receive
only the payment provided by Section 262 of the DGCL with respect to Shares
owned by such Dissenting Stockholder. If any Person who otherwise would
be deemed a Dissenting Stockholder shall have

 



-9-  failed to properly perfect or shall have effectively withdrawn or lost the
right to dissent under Section 262 of the DGCL or if a court of competent
jurisdiction shall finally determine that the Dissenting Stockholder is not
entitled to relief provided by Section 262 of the DGCL with respect to any
Shares, such Shares shall thereupon be treated as though such Shares had been
converted, as of the First Effective Time, into the right to receive the
Merger Consideration without interest and less any required Tax withholding.
The Company shall give Parent (i) prompt written notice of any written demands
for appraisal, attempted withdrawals of such demands, and any other
instruments served pursuant to applicable Law received by the Company
relating to stockholders rights of appraisal, and (ii) the opportunity to
direct all negotiations and proceedings with respect to demands for appraisal.
The Company shall not, except with the prior written consent of Parent,
voluntarily make any payment with respect to any demands for appraisal, offer
to settle or settle any such demands or approve any withdrawal of any such
demands.

 

4.4 _Adjustments to Prevent Dilution_. In the event that the Company changes
the number of Shares or securities convertible or exchangeable into or
exercisable for any such Shares, or Parent changes the number of shares of
Parent Common Stock, in each case issued and outstanding prior to the First
Effective Time as a result of a distribution, reclassification, stock
split (including a reverse stock split), stock dividend or distribution,
recapitalization, subdivision, or other similar transaction, the Merger
Consideration shall be equitably adjusted to eliminate the effects of such
event on the Merger Consideration. 

4.5 _Company Stock Based Plans_. (a) At the First Effective Time, each
outstanding option to purchase Shares (a " _Company Option_ ") under the
Company Stock Plans, whether vested or unvested, shall be converted into an
option to acquire a number of shares of Parent Common Stock equal to the
product (rounded down to the nearest whole number) of (i) the number of
Shares subject to the Company Option immediately prior to the First Effective
Time and (ii) the Option Exchange Ratio, at an exercise price per share
(rounded up to the nearest whole cent) equal to the result obtained by
dividing (A) the exercise price per Share of such Company Option immediately
prior to the First Effective Time by (B) the Option Exchange Ratio; _provided_
that the exercise price and the number of shares of Parent Common Stock
purchasable pursuant to the Company Options shall be determined in a manner
consistent with the requirements of Section 409A of the Code. The " _Option
Exchange Ratio_ " shall mean a fraction (x) the numerator of which is the sum
of the Cash Consideration and an amount equal to the product of (I) the
Exchange Ratio and (II) the Average Parent Stock Price and (y) the denominator
of which is the Average Parent Stock Price. Except as specifically provided
above, following the First Effective Time, each Company Option shall continue
to be governed by the terms and conditions applicable to such Company Option
immediately prior to the First Effective Time, including all vesting
conditions that are applicable following a "Change in Control" as defined in
the award agreement applicable to the Company Option; _provided_ that each
Company Option granted to a non-employee director of the Company shall vest
and become exercisable at the First Effective Time.

 

(b) At the First Effective Time, each outstanding restricted stock unit that
was granted to a non-employee director of the Company (a " _Company Director
Restricted Stock_

 



-10-   _Unit_ ") under the Company Stock Plans, whether vested or unvested, shall
be cancelled and shall only entitle the holder of such Company Director
Restricted Stock Unit to receive (without interest), as soon as reasonably
practicable after the First Effective Time (but in any event no later than
three (3) business days after the Effective Time), (i) the Merger
Consideration for each Share subject to such Company Director Restricted
Stock Unit immediately prior to the First Effective Time and (ii) a cash
payment equal to the amount of any unpaid "Retained Distributions" as defined
in the award agreement applicable to the Company Director Restricted
Stock Unit.

(c) At the First Effective Time, each outstanding restricted stock unit other
than a Company Director Restricted Stock Unit (a " _Company Employee
Restricted Stock Unit_ ," and together with the Company Director Restricted
Stock Units, the " _Company Restricted Stock Units_ ") under the Company Stock
Plans, whether vested or unvested, other than any restricted stock units that
were granted pursuant to a "Performance Stock Units Agreement" (the " _Company
Performance Stock Units_ "), shall be converted into (i) the right to receive
a cash payment equal to (A) (1) the Cash Consideration multiplied by (2) the
number of Shares underlying such Company Employee Restricted Stock Unit, which
shall be treated as a "Retained Distribution" for purposes of the award
agreement applicable to such Company Employee Restricted Stock Unit, plus (B)
the amount of any accrued "Retained Distributions" that remain unpaid as of
the Effective Time, and (ii) a restricted stock unit on the number of shares
of Parent Common Stock (a " _Parent Stock Unit_ ") equal to the Exchange
Ratio multiplied by the number of Shares underlying such Company Employee
Restricted Stock Unit; _provided_ that, any fractional Parent Stock Unit shall
be converted into a cash payment in lieu thereof based on the Average Parent
Stock Price, and such payment shall be a "Retained Distribution". Except as
specifically provided above, following the First Effective Time, each Parent
Stock Unit and the related "Retained Distributions" (including in respect of
the Cash Consideration) shall continue to be governed by the terms and
conditions applicable to the corresponding Company Employee Restricted Stock
Unit immediately prior to the First Effective Time, including all vesting
conditions that are applicable following a "Change in Control" as defined in
the award agreement applicable to the Company Employee Restricted Stock Unit
and all dividend equivalent rights.

 

(d) At the First Effective Time, each outstanding Company Performance Stock
Unit under the Company Stock Plans, whether vested or unvested, shall be
cancelled and shall only entitle the holder of such Company Performance Stock
Unit to receive (without interest), as soon as reasonably practicable after
the First Effective Time (but in any event no later than three (3) business
days after the First Effective Time), (i) the Merger Consideration for each
Share subject to such Company Performance Stock Unit immediately prior to the
First Effective Time as determined in accordance with the immediately
following sentence, and (ii) a cash payment equal to the amount of any unpaid
and related "Retained Distributions" as defined in the award agreement
applicable to the Company Performance Stock Unit, in each case less applicable
tax withholdings. For purposes of the immediately preceding sentence, the
number of Shares subject to such Company Performance Stock Unit and related
Retained Distributions shall be determined by the Compensation and Human
Development Committee of the Board of Directors of the Company (the "
_Compensation Committee_ "), subject to Parent review, prior to the First
Effective Time in accordance with Section 6 of the applicable award agreement.

 



-11- (e) At the First Effective Time, each notional Share (each, a " _Notional
Share_ ") subject to the Companys Non-Employee Directors Deferred
Compensation Plan or the Deferred Compensation Plan for Directors of the
Company (together, the " _Director Deferred Compensation Plans_ ") shall be
deemed converted into an amount in cash equal to the numerator of the Option
Exchange Ratio, and the resulting amount shall be deemed reinvested in the
notional fund under the Director Deferred Compensation Plans that is deemed to
credit interest at a specified rate. For the avoidance of doubt, a Notional
Share shall not include any interest in the Company Stock Fund under the
Company Savings Plan.

 

(f) With respect to each unit (each, a " _Notional Unit_ ") subject to the
Company Deferred Compensation Plan (together with the Director Deferred
Compensation Plans, the " _Deferred Compensation Plans_ ") that is deemed to
have a value based on an interest in the Company Stock Fund under the Company
Savings Plan (each, a " _Stock Fund Interest_ "), at the First Effective
Time, such Notional Unit shall be deemed converted into an amount in cash
equal to the fair market value of a Stock Fund Interest, which fair market
value shall be determined (i) taking into account any cash held or
deemed held by the Company Stock Fund as of the Closing Date that is
unrelated to the Cash Consideration and (ii) based on the assumption that any
Merger Consideration held or deemed held by the Company Stock Fund as of the
Closing Date has a value equal to the numerator of the Option Exchange Ratio.

(g) As soon as practicable after the First Effective Time, Parent shall,
if registration of the shares of Parent Common Stock issuable under a Company
Stock Plan or other Company Plan is required under the Securities Act of 1933,
as amended (the " _Securities Act_ "), file with the Securities and
Exchange Commission (the " _SEC_ ") a registration statement on Form S-3 or
Form S-8, as the case may be (or any successor form), or another appropriate
form with respect to such Parent Common Stock and shall use commercially
reasonable efforts to have such registration statement declared effective as
soon as practicable following such filing.

(h) At or prior to the First Effective Time, the Company, the Board of
Directors of the Company and the Compensation Committee, as applicable, shall
adopt any resolutions and take any actions which are necessary to effectuate
the provisions of this Section 4.5. Parent shall take all actions as are
reasonably necessary for the assumption of the Company Options and Company
Employee Restricted Stock Units pursuant to Section 4.5(a) and Section 4.5(c).
Without limiting the foregoing, the Company shall take all necessary action
to ensure that the Initial Surviving Company will not be bound at the First
Effective Time by any options, stock appreciation rights, units or other
rights, awards or arrangements under the Company Stock Plans that would
entitle any Person after the First Effective Time to beneficially own any
Shares or to receive any payments in respect thereof, and all Company Stock
Plans conferring any rights to Shares or other capital stock of the Company
shall be deemed to be amended to be in conformity with this Section 4.5.

a foreign legal entity in each jurisdiction where the ownership, leasing or
operation of its assets or properties or conduct of its business requires
such qualification, except where the failure to be so organized, qualified or
in good standing, or to have such power or authority, would not, individually
or in the aggregate, reasonably be likely to have a Company Material Adverse
Effect. Prior to the date of this Agreement, the Company has made available to
Parent complete and correct copies of the respective certificates of
incorporation and bylaws (or comparable organizational documents) of
the Company and each of its Significant Subsidiaries as amended to and as in

by one or more of its Subsidiaries (it being understood that based solely on
the information made available to Parent prior to the date hereof,

delay or materially impair the ability of the Company to consummate the
Mergers, or (B) a material adverse effect on the financial condition,
properties, assets, business or results of operations of the Company and its
Subsidiaries, taken as a whole, excluding any such effect resulting from or
arising in connection with: (1) changes in, or events generally affecting, the
financial, securities or capital markets, (2) general economic or political
conditions in the United States or any foreign jurisdiction in which the
Company or any of its Subsidiaries operate, including any changes in currency
exchange rates, interest rates, monetary policy or inflation, (3) changes in,
or events generally affecting, the industries in which the Company or any of
its Subsidiaries operate, (4) any acts of war, sabotage, civil disobedience or

definition) has resulted in, or contributed to, a Company Material Adverse
Effect, (7) changes in Law, (8) changes in U.S. generally accepted accounting

announcement or pendency (but, for the avoidance of doubt, not the
consummation) of this Agreement and the Mergers, including the impact thereof
on the relationships with customers, suppliers, distributors, partners or
employees ( _provided_ that the exception in this clause (10) shall not apply
to references to "Company Material Adverse Effect" in Section 5.1(d) and
Section 5.1(o)(ii)); _provided_ , _however_ , that the changes, effects,
circumstances or developments set forth in the foregoing clauses (1), (2),
(3), (4), (7) and (8) shall be taken into account in determining whether a
"Company Material Adverse Effect" has occurred to the extent such changes,
effects, circumstances or developments have a disproportionate adverse
effect on the Company and its Subsidiaries, taken as a whole, relative to
other participants in the industries in which the Company and its Subsidiaries
operate, but, in such event, only the incremental disproportionate impact of
such changes, effects, circumstances or developments shall be taken into
account in determining whether a "Company Material Adverse Effect" has
occurred, and (v) the term " _Knowledge of the Company_ " means the actual

reserved for, and 33,437,890 Shares subject to, issuance pursuant to the
Company Plans identified in Section 5.1(b)(i)(A) of the Company Disclosure
Letter as being the only Company Plans pursuant to which Shares may be issued
(the " _Company Stock Plans_ "). Except as provided in the preceding sentence
and except for Shares that after the date hereof become reserved for issuance
or subject to issuance as permitted under this Agreement, the Company has no
Shares reserved for, or subject to, issuance. The Company has no shares of
Preferred Stock, shares of Series Common Stock or other shares of capital
stock reserved for or subject to issuance (it being understood that "other

or the settlement of Company Restricted Stock Units outstanding as of
September 30, 2016, in accordance with their terms and, since September 30,
2016, except as permitted by this Agreement for the period following the date
of this Agreement, the Company has not issued any Company Options, Company
Restricted Stock Units or Company Performance Stock Units. Upon any issuance
of any Shares in accordance with the terms of the Company Stock Plans, such
Shares will be duly authorized, validly issued and fully paid and
nonassessable and free and clear of any lien, charge, pledge, security
interest, claim or other encumbrance (each, a " _Lien_ "). Each of the
outstanding shares of capital stock or other securities of each of the
Companys Subsidiaries has been duly authorized and validly issued and is
fully paid and nonassessable and owned by the Company or by a direct or
indirect wholly owned Subsidiary of the Company, free and clear of any Lien
(other than any Liens for Taxes not yet due and payable or that are being
contested in good faith by appropriate proceedings and as to which appropriate
reserves have been recorded in the Companys financial statements). Except
as set forth in Section 5.1(b)(i), as of the date of this Agreement, there
are no preemptive or other outstanding rights, options, warrants, conversion
rights, stock appreciation rights, redemption rights, repurchase rights,
agreements, arrangements, calls, commitments or rights of any kind that
obligate the Company or any of its Subsidiaries to issue or sell any shares of
capital stock or other equity or voting securities of the Company or any of
its Subsidiaries or any securities or obligations convertible or exchangeable
into or exercisable for, or giving any Person a right to subscribe for or
acquire from the Company or any of its Subsidiaries any equity or voting
securities of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries, and no securities or
obligations evidencing such rights are authorized, issued or outstanding. The
Company does not have outstanding any bonds, debentures, notes or other
obligations the holders of which have the right to vote (or convertible
into or exercisable for securities having the right to vote) with the
stockholders of the Company on any matter.

 



-15- (iii) Section 5.1(b)(iii) of the Company Disclosure Letter sets forth, as of
the date of this Agreement, (A) each of the Companys Subsidiaries and the
ownership interest of the Company in each such Subsidiary and (B) any other
Person in which the Company or any of its Subsidiaries may hold capital stock
or other equity interest that has a book value in excess of $10,000,000
(other than securities held by any employee benefit plan of the Company or any
of its Subsidiaries or any trustee, agent or other fiduciary in such capacity
under any such employee benefit plan). No Subsidiary of the Company owns any
Shares. As of the date of this Agreement, the Company does not own, directly
or indirectly, any voting interest in any Person that is reasonably likely to
require an additional filing by Parent under the Hart-Scott-Rodino Antitrust
Improvements Act of 1976, as amended (the " _HSR Act_ "), in connection with
the Mergers.

(iv) Each Company Option (A) was granted in compliance in all material
respects with all applicable Laws and all of the terms and conditions of the
Company Stock Plans pursuant to which it was issued, (B) has an exercise price
per Share equal to or greater than the fair market value of a Share on the
date of such grant, (C) has a grant date identical to the date on which the

specified by the Companys Board of Directors or the Compensation Committee
(including through delegation) in their respective authorization of such
Company Options, (D) qualifies in all material respects for the Tax and
accounting treatment afforded to such Company Option in the Companys Tax
Returns and the Company Reports, respectively, and (E) complies in all
material respects with Section 409A of the Code.

 

(c) _Corporate Authority and Approval; Financial Advisor Opinions_. The
Company has all requisite corporate power and authority and has taken all
corporate action necessary in order to execute, deliver and perform its
obligations under this Agreement and to consummate the Initial Merger, subject
only to adoption of this Agreement by the holders of a majority of the
outstanding Shares entitled to vote on such matter at a meeting duly called
and held for such purpose (the " _Company Requisite Vote_ "). This Agreement
has been duly executed and delivered by the Company and constitutes a valid
and binding agreement of the Company, enforceable against the Company in
accordance with its terms, subject to bankruptcy, insolvency, fraudulent
transfer, reorganization, moratorium and similar Laws of general applicability
relating to or affecting creditors rights and to general equity principles
(the " _Bankruptcy and Equity Exception_ "). As of the date of this Agreement,
the Board of Directors of the Company has (i) (A) unanimously determined that
the Initial Merger is fair to, and in the best interests of, the Company and
its stockholders, (B) approved the Initial Merger and the other transactions
contemplated hereby, (C) approved and declared advisable this Agreement, and

date of such opinion and based upon and subject to the various qualifications,

Consideration to be received by holders of Shares pursuant to this Agreement
is fair, from a financial point of view, to such holders, and (iii) directed
that this Agreement be submitted to the

 



-16-  holders of Shares for their adoption. The Board of Directors of the Company
has taken all action so that Parent will not be an "interested stockholder" or
prohibited from entering into or consummating a "business combination" with
the Company (in each case, as such term is used in Section 203 of the DGCL) as
a result of the execution of this Agreement or the consummation of the
transactions in the manner contemplated hereby.

(d) _Governmental Filings; No Violations_. (i) Other than the necessary
filings, notices, reports, consents, registrations, approvals, permits,
expirations of waiting periods or authorizations (A) pursuant to Section 1.3,

Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the " _Exchange Act_ "), and the
Securities Act, (C) to comply with state securities or "blue-sky" Laws, (D) as

"), no filings, notices and/or reports are required to be made by the Company
or its Subsidiaries with, nor are any consents, registrations, approvals,
permits, expirations of waiting periods or authorizations required to be
obtained by the Company or its Subsidiaries from, any domestic, foreign or
transnational governmental, competition or regulatory authority, court,
arbitral tribunal agency, commission, body or other legislative, executive or
judicial governmental entity or self-regulatory agency (each, a "
_Governmental Entity_ ") in connection with the execution, delivery and
performance of this Agreement by the Company and/or the consummation by the
Company of the Mergers and the other transactions contemplated
hereby, except, in each case, those that the failure to make or obtain would
not, individually or in the aggregate, reasonably be likely to have a Company
Material Adverse Effect.

 

(ii) The execution, delivery and performance of this Agreement by the Company
do not, and the consummation by the Company of the Mergers and the other
transactions contemplated hereby will not, constitute or result in (A) a
breach or violation of, or a default under, the Companys Restated Certificate
of Incorporation, effective as of July 27, 2007 and as amended on June 4,
2008, March 27, 2009, August 13, 2009, May 24, 2011 and December 31, 2011 (as

28, 2016 (the " _Company Bylaws_ ") or the comparable governing instruments
of any of its Significant Subsidiaries, (B) with or without the lapse of time
or the giving of notice or both, a breach or violation of, a default or
termination or modification (or right of termination or modification) under,
payment of additional fees under, the creation or acceleration of any
obligations under, or the creation of a Lien on any of the assets of the
Company or any of its Subsidiaries pursuant to any agreement, lease, license,
contract, consent, settlement, note, mortgage, indenture, arrangement,
understanding or other obligation (" _Contracts_ ") binding upon

 



-17-  the Company or any of its Subsidiaries, or, assuming (solely with respect to
performance of this Agreement and consummation of the Mergers and the other
transactions contemplated hereby) the filings, notices, reports, consents,
registrations, approvals, permits, expirations of waiting periods and
authorizations referred to in Section 5.1(d)(i) are made or obtained and
receipt of the Company Requisite Vote, under any Law, Order or License to
which the Company or any of its Subsidiaries is subject or (C) any change in
the rights or obligations under any Contract to which the Company or any of
its Subsidiaries is a party, except, in the case of clauses (B) and (C) above,
for any such breach, violation, default, termination, modification, payment,
acceleration, creation or change that would not, individually or in the
aggregate, reasonably be likely to have a Company Material Adverse Effect.

 

(iii) As of the date of this Agreement, the Company is not party to or bound
by any Contract that is material to the Company and its Subsidiaries, taken
as a whole.

(e) _Company Reports; Financial Statements_. (i) The Company has filed or
furnished, as applicable, on a timely basis, all forms, statements,
certifications, reports and documents required to be filed or furnished by it
with or to the SEC pursuant to the Exchange Act or the Securities Act since
December 31, 2014 (the " _Applicable Date_ ") (the forms, statements, reports
and documents filed with or furnished to the SEC since the Applicable Date and
those filed with or furnished to the SEC subsequent to the date of this
Agreement, in each case as amended, the " _Company Reports_ "). Each of the
Company Reports, at the time of its filing or being furnished complied or, if

applicable requirements of the Securities Act, the Exchange Act and the
Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 (the " _Sarbanes-Oxley Act_ "), and any rules and
regulations promulgated thereunder applicable to the Company Reports. As of
their respective dates (or, if amended prior to the date of this Agreement,
as of the date of such amendment), the Company Reports did not, and any
Company Reports filed with or furnished to the SEC subsequent to the date of
this Agreement will not, contain any untrue statement of a material fact or
omit to state a material fact required to be stated therein or necessary to
make the statements made therein, in light of the circumstances in which they
were made, not misleading.

 

(ii) The Company is in compliance in all material respects with the applicable
listing and corporate governance rules and regulations of the NYSE.

(iii) The Company maintains disclosure controls and procedures required by
Rule 13a-15 or 15d-15 under the Exchange Act. Such disclosure controls and
procedures are designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed by
the Company in its filings with the SEC under the Exchange Act is recorded and
reported on a timely basis to the individuals responsible for the preparation
of the Companys filings with the SEC under the Exchange Act. The Company
maintains internal control over financial reporting (as defined in Rule 13a-15
or 15d-15, as applicable, under the Exchange Act). Such internal control
over financial reporting is designed to provide reasonable assurance
regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of
financial statements for external purposes in accordance with GAAP. The
Company has disclosed, based on the most recent evaluation of its Chief
Executive Officer and its Chief Financial Officer prior to the date of this
Agreement, to the

 



-18-  Companys auditors and the audit committee of the Companys Board of

design or operation of its internal controls over financial reporting that
are reasonably likely to adversely affect the Companys ability to record,
process, summarize and report financial information and (y) any fraud, whether
or not material, that involves management or other employees who have a
significant role in the Companys internal control over financial reporting.
The Company has made available prior to the date of this Agreement to Parent

compliance with Law, including from Company Employees regarding questionable
accounting, auditing or legal compliance matters have, to the Knowledge of the
Company, been received by the Company.

 

(iv) Each of the consolidated balance sheets included in or incorporated by

respects, the consolidated financial position of the Company and its
Subsidiaries, as of the date of such balance sheet, and each of the
consolidated statements of operations, cash flows and changes in stockholders
equity (deficit) included in or incorporated by reference into the Company
Reports (including any related notes and schedules) fairly presents, or, in
the case of Company Reports filed after the date of this Agreement, will
fairly present, in each case, in all material respects, the results of
operations, retained earnings (loss) and changes in financial position, as
the case may be, of the Company and its Subsidiaries for the periods set forth
therein (subject, in the case of unaudited statements, to notes and normal
year-end audit adjustments that are not or will not be material in amount
or effect), in each case in accordance with GAAP consistently applied during
the periods involved, except as may be noted therein or in the notes thereto.

 

(v) Neither the Company nor any of its Subsidiaries has incurred any
Indebtedness, or issued or sold any debt securities or rights to acquire any
debt security of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries, the terms of which,
or the terms of any instrument under which such Indebtedness, debt securities
or rights were issued, requires the public listing of such Indebtedness, debt
securities or rights or the maintenance by the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries of registration under the Exchange Act. As used in this
Agreement, the term " _Indebtedness_ " means, with respect to any Person,
without duplication, all obligations or undertakings by such Person (i) for
borrowed money (including deposits or advances of any kind to such Person);
(ii) evidenced by bonds, debentures, notes or similar instruments; (iii) for
capitalized leases or to pay the deferred and unpaid purchase price of
property or equipment; (iv) pursuant to securitization or factoring programs

owned Subsidiaries or between or among the Company and its wholly owned
Subsidiaries); (vi) to maintain or cause to be maintained the financing or
financial position of others; (vii) net cash payment obligations of such

behalf of such Person to the extent they have been drawn upon.

(f) _Absence of Certain Changes_. Since December 31, 2015, there has not been
any change, effect, circumstance or development which has had or would,
individually or in the aggregate, reasonably be likely to have a Company

mortgaged, pledged, placed a Lien upon or otherwise disposed of any of the
Companys or its Subsidiaries property or assets (including capital stock of
any of the Companys Subsidiaries) with fair market values in excess of
$25,000,000 individually or $100,000,000 in the aggregate (other than such
actions solely among the Company and any of its wholly owned Subsidiaries);
(v) other than in the ordinary course of business and consistent with past
practice with respect to loans, advances, capital contributions and
investments not in excess of $25,000,000 individually or $100,000,000 in the
aggregate, the Company and its Subsidiaries have not made any loan, advance

change with respect to financial accounting policies or procedures.

 

(g) _Litigation and Liabilities_. There are no civil, criminal or
administrative actions, suits, claims, hearings, arbitrations, investigations
or other proceedings (" _Proceedings_ "), pending or, to the Knowledge of the
Company, threatened against the Company or any of its

 



-20-  Subsidiaries, except for those that would not, individually or in the
aggregate, reasonably be likely to have a Company Material Adverse Effect.
There are no obligations or liabilities of the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries, whether or not accrued, contingent or otherwise other than (i)
liabilities or obligations disclosed, reflected, reserved against or otherwise
provided for in the consolidated balance sheet of the Company as of June 30,
2016 and the notes thereto set forth in the Companys quarterly report on Form

order, writ, injunction, decree, award, stipulation or settlement of or with
any Governmental Entity that would, individually or in the aggregate,
reasonably be likely to have a Company Material Adverse Effect (except to the
extent expressly consented to by Parent pursuant to Section 6.5).

 

(h) _Employee Benefits_. (i) For the purposes of this Agreement, the term "
_Company Plan_ " shall mean any benefit and compensation plan, contract,
policy, program or arrangement maintained, sponsored or contributed to by the
Company or any of its Subsidiaries covering current or former employees of the
Company and its Subsidiaries (" _Company Employees_ ") and current or former
directors of the Company, including "employee benefit plans" within the
meaning of Section 3(3) of the Employee Retirement Income Security Act of
1974, as amended (" _ERISA_ "), and any incentive and bonus, deferred
compensation, stock purchase, employment, retention, severance, termination,
change in control, restricted stock, stock option, stock appreciation rights
or stock based plans, and the Company Plans maintained outside of the United
States primarily for the benefit of Company Employees working outside of the
United States are hereinafter referred to as the " _Company Non-U.S. Benefit
Plans_ "; _provided_ that the term Company Plan shall exclude any
"multiemployer plan" within the meaning of Section 3(37) of ERISA (a "
_Multiemployer Plan_ "). Each material Company Plan as of the date of this
Agreement is listed in Section 5.1(h)(i) of the Company Disclosure Letter and
each such Company Plan which has received a favorable determination letter
from the Internal Revenue Service (the " _IRS_ ") National Office has been
separately identified. True and complete copies of each of the material
Company Plans (or, if unwritten, a written summary thereof), and all
amendments thereto, have been provided or made available to Parent on or prior
to the date of this Agreement.

 

(ii) All Company Plans are in compliance with applicable Laws (including, if
applicable, ERISA and the Code), except as would not be reasonably likely to
result in any liability that is material to the Company and its Subsidiaries,
taken as a whole.

(iii) Each Company Plan other than any Company Non-U.S. Benefit Plan
(collectively, the " _Company U.S. Benefit Plans_ "), which is subject to
ERISA (a " _Company ERISA Plan_ ") that is an "employee pension benefit plan"
within the meaning of Section 3(2) of

 



-21-  ERISA (a " _Company Pension Plan_ ") intended to be qualified under Section
401(a) of the Code, has received a favorable determination letter from the IRS
and, to the Knowledge of the Company, circumstances do not exist that are
likely to result in the loss of the qualification of such plan under Section
401(a) of the Code. Any voluntary employees beneficiary association within
the meaning of Section 501(c)(9) of the Code which provides benefits under a
Company U.S. Benefit Plan has (A) received an opinion letter from the IRS
recognizing its exempt status under Section 501(c)(9) of the Code and (B)
filed a timely notice with the IRS pursuant to Section 505(c) of the Code,
and the Company is not aware of circumstances likely to result in the loss of
such exempt status under Section 501(c)(9) of the Code. Except as would not,
individually or in the aggregate, reasonably be likely to have a Company

any of them, or the single-employer plan of any entity which is considered one
employer with the Company under Section 4001 of ERISA or Section 414 of the

increased by application of Section 412(l) of the Code. Neither the Company
nor any of its Subsidiaries has provided, or is required to provide, security
to any Company Pension Plan or to any single-employer plan of a Company ERISA

Effect, (7) changes in Law, (8) changes in GAAP (or authoritative

result in (A) a breach or violation of, or a default under, the certificate of
incorporation or bylaws or, in the case of Merger LLC, the limited liability
company operating agreement, of Parent or Merger Subs, (B) with or without the
lapse of time or the giving of notice or both, a breach or violation of, a
default or termination or modification (or right of termination or
modification) under, payment of additional fees under, the creation or
acceleration of any obligations under, or the creation of a Lien on any of the
assets of Parent or any of its Subsidiaries pursuant to any Contract binding
upon Parent or any of its Subsidiaries, or, assuming (solely with respect to
performance of this Agreement and consummation of the Mergers and the other
transactions contemplated hereby) the filings, notices, reports, consents,
registrations, approvals, permits, expirations of waiting periods and
authorizations referred to in Section 5.2(d)(i) are made or obtained, under
any Law, Order or License to which Parent or any of its Subsidiaries is
subject or (C) any change in the rights or obligations under any Contract to
which Parent or any of its Subsidiaries is a party, except, in the case of
clauses (B) and (C) above, for any such breach, violation, default,
termination, modification, payment, acceleration, creation or change that
would not, individually or in the aggregate, reasonably be likely to have a
Parent Material Adverse Effect.

(e) _Parent Reports; Financial Statements_. (i) Parent has filed or
furnished, as applicable, on a timely basis, all forms, statements,
certifications, reports and documents required to be filed or furnished by it
with or to the SEC pursuant to the Exchange Act or the Securities Act since
the Applicable Date (the forms, statements, reports and documents filed with
or furnished to the SEC since the Applicable Date and those filed with or
furnished to the SEC subsequent to the date of this Agreement, in each case
as amended, the " _Parent Reports_ "). Each of the Parent Reports, at the time
of its filing or being furnished, complied or, if not yet filed or furnished,
will comply in all material respects with the applicable requirements of the
Securities Act, the Exchange Act and the Sarbanes-Oxley Act, and any rules and
regulations promulgated thereunder applicable to the Parent Reports. As of
their respective dates (or, if amended prior to the date of this Agreement, as
of the date of such amendment), the Parent Reports did not, and any Parent
Reports filed with or furnished to the SEC subsequent to the date of this
Agreement will not, contain any untrue statement of a material fact or omit to
state a material fact required to be stated therein or necessary to make the
statements made therein, in light of the circumstances in which they were
made, not misleading.

 

(ii) Parent is in compliance in all material respects with the applicable
listing and corporate governance rules and regulations of the NYSE. 

(iii) Parent maintains disclosure controls and procedures required by Rule
13a-15 or 15d-15 under the Exchange Act. Such disclosure controls and
procedures are designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed by
Parent in its filings with the SEC under the Exchange Act is recorded and
reported on a timely basis to the individuals responsible for the preparation
of Parents filings with the SEC under the Exchange Act. Parent maintains
internal control over financial reporting (as defined in Rule 13a-15 or
15d-15, as applicable, under the Exchange Act). Such internal control over
financial reporting is designed to provide

 



-41-  reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and
the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance
with GAAP. Parent has disclosed, based on the most recent evaluation of its
Chief Executive Officer and its Chief Financial Officer prior to the date of
this Agreement, to Parents auditors and the audit committee of Parents Board
of Directors (x) any significant deficiencies and material weaknesses in the
design or operation of its internal controls over financial reporting that are
reasonably likely to adversely affect Parents ability to record, process,
summarize and report financial information and (y) any fraud, whether or not
material, that involves management or other employees who have a significant
role in Parents internal control over financial reporting.

 

(iv) Each of the consolidated balance sheets included in or incorporated by
reference into the Parent Reports (including the related notes and schedules)
fairly presents or, in the case of Parent Reports filed after the date of this
Agreement, will fairly present, in each case, in all material respects, the
consolidated financial position of Parent and its Subsidiaries, as of the date
of such balance sheet, and each of the consolidated statements of income,
cash flows and changes in stockholders equity (deficit) included in or
incorporated by reference into the Parent Reports (including any related notes
and schedules) fairly presents, or, in the case of Parent Reports filed after
the date of this Agreement, will fairly present, in each case, in all material
respects, the results of operations, retained earnings (loss) and changes in
financial position, as the case may be, of Parent and its Subsidiaries for
the periods set forth therein (subject, in the case of unaudited statements,
to notes and normal year-end audit adjustments that will not be material in
amount or effect), in each case in accordance with GAAP consistently applied
during the periods involved, except as may be noted therein or in the notes
thereto.

(f) _Absence of Certain Changes_. Since December 31, 2015, there has not been
any change, effect, circumstance or development which has had or would,
individually or in the aggregate, reasonably be likely to have a Parent
Material Adverse Effect. Since June 30, 2016 and through the date of this
Agreement, (i) Parent and its Subsidiaries have conducted their respective
businesses in the ordinary course of such businesses consistent with past
practice in all material respects; and (ii) except for normal quarterly cash
dividends in an amount equal to $0.48 per share of Parent Common Stock, Parent
has not declared, set aside or paid any dividend or distribution payable in
cash, stock or property in respect of any capital stock.

 

(g) _Litigation and Liabilities_. There are no Proceedings, pending or, to the
Knowledge of Parent, threatened against Parent or any of its Subsidiaries,
except for those that would not, individually or in the aggregate, reasonably
be likely to have a Parent Material Adverse Effect. There are no obligations
or liabilities of Parent or any of its Subsidiaries, whether or not accrued,
contingent or otherwise other than (i) liabilities or obligations disclosed,
reflected, reserved against or otherwise provided for in the consolidated
balance sheet of Parent as of June 30, 2016 and the notes thereto set forth
in Parents quarterly report on Form 10-Q for the fiscal quarter ended June
30, 2016; (ii) liabilities or obligations incurred in the ordinary course of
business consistent with past practice since June 30, 2016; (iii) liabilities
or obligations arising out of this Agreement (and which do not arise out of a
breach by Parent or Merger Subs of any representation or warranty in this
Agreement) or third-party service provider obligations incurred in connection
with the transactions contemplated hereby; or (iv) liabilities or obligations

 



-42-  that would not reasonably be likely to have, individually or in the
aggregate, a Parent Material Adverse Effect. Neither Parent nor any of its
Subsidiaries is a party to or subject to the provisions of any judgment,
order, writ, injunction, decree, award, stipulation or settlement of or with
any Governmental Entity that would reasonably be likely to have, individually
or in the aggregate, a Parent Material Adverse Effect. For purposes of this
Agreement, the term " _Knowledge of Parent_ " means the actual knowledge of
the individuals identified on Section 5.2(g) of the Parent Disclosure Letter.

 

(h) _Employee Benefits_. All contributions required to be made under each
Parent Pension Plan, as of the date of this Agreement, have been timely made
and all obligations in respect of each Parent Pension Plan have been properly
accrued and reflected in the most recent consolidated balance sheet filed or
incorporated by reference in the Parent Reports prior to the date of
this Agreement. Under each Parent Pension Plan which is a single-employer
plan, as of the last day of the most recent plan year ended prior to the date
of this Agreement, the actuarially determined present value of all "benefit
liabilities", within the meaning of Section 4001(a)(16) of ERISA (as
determined on the basis of the actuarial assumptions contained in such Parent
Pension Plans most recent actuarial valuation), did not exceed the then
current value of the assets of such Parent Pension Plan, and there has been
no material change in the financial condition, whether or not as a result of a
change in funding method, of such Parent Pension Plan since the last day of
the most recent plan year. For purposes of this Agreement, " _Parent Pension
Plan_ " means any benefit plan maintained, sponsored or contributed to by
Parent or any of its Subsidiaries, which is subject to ERISA and is an
"employee pension benefit plan" within the meaning of Section 3(2) of ERISA.

(i) _Compliance with Laws_. The businesses of each of Parent and its
Subsidiaries since January 1, 2012 have not been, and are not being,
conducted in violation of any applicable Law or Order, except for such
violations that would not, individually or in the aggregate, reasonably be
likely to have a Parent Material Adverse Effect. To the Knowledge of Parent,
no investigation or review by any Governmental Entity with respect to Parent
or any of its Subsidiaries is pending or, as of the date of this Agreement,
threatened, nor has any Governmental Entity indicated an intention to conduct
the same, except for such investigations or reviews the outcome of which would
not, individually or in the aggregate, reasonably be likely to have a Parent
Material Adverse Effect.

 

(j) _Takeover Statutes_. No Takeover Statute or any anti-takeover provision in
Parents restated certificate of incorporation or bylaws is, or at the First
Effective Time or Second Effective Time will be, applicable to the Parent
Common Stock, the Mergers or the other transactions contemplated by this
Agreement.

 

(k) _Brokers and Finders_. Parent has not employed any broker or finder or
incurred any liability for any brokerage fees, commissions or finders fees
in connection with the Mergers or the other transactions contemplated in this
Agreement, except that Parent has employed Perella Weinberg Partners LP, J.P.
Morgan Securities LLC and Merrill Lynch, Pierce, Fenner and Smith Incorporated
as its financial advisors.

 



-43- (l) _Available Funds_. Parent and Merger Subs have available to them, and at
the First Effective Time will have available to them, all funds and
commitments necessary for the payment of the Merger Consideration. Parent has
delivered to the Company true and complete copies of a fully executed credit
agreement (the " _Credit Agreement_ ") dated on or about the date of this
Agreement, with the Financing Sources specified therein providing for Debt
Financing in the amounts set forth therein, the proceeds of which shall be
available to finance the payment of the Cash Consideration and any other
amounts required to be paid in connection with the consummation of the
Mergers. The Credit Agreement is the legal, valid and binding obligation of,
and enforceable against, Parent and Merger Subs, as applicable, and, to the
Knowledge of Parent, each of the other parties thereto.

(m) _Taxes_. Except as would not reasonably be likely to have, individually
or in the aggregate, a Parent Material Adverse Effect:

(i) Parent and each of its Subsidiaries (A) have prepared in good faith and
duly and timely filed all Tax Returns required to be filed by any of them and
all such filed Tax Returns are complete and accurate in all material respects
and (B) have paid all Taxes that are required to be paid (whether or not shown
on such Tax Returns) or that Parent or any of its Subsidiaries are obligated
to withhold from amounts owing to any employee, creditor or third party,
except with respect to matters contested in good faith.

 

(ii) As of the date of this Agreement, to the Knowledge of Parent, there are
no pending audits, examinations, investigations or other proceedings in
respect of Taxes. Except as made available to the Company prior to the date of
this Agreement, there are not, to the Knowledge of Parent, any claims or
assessments (whether or not asserted in writing) by any taxing
authority concerning Parents or any of its Subsidiaries Tax liability that
would, individually or in the aggregate, reasonably be likely to have a Parent
Material Adverse Effect.

 

(n) _Tax Treatment_. As of the date of this Agreement:

 

(i) Neither Parent nor any of its Subsidiaries has taken or agreed to take any
action, or is aware of any facts or circumstances, in each case, that would
prevent or impede, or would reasonably be likely to prevent or impede, the
Mergers from qualifying for the Intended Tax Treatment.

 

(ii) Neither Parent nor any of its Subsidiaries is aware of any reason that it
could not provide, to Cravath or another law firm, representations and
warranties of the sort customarily provided by an acquiring company as the
basis for a legal opinion that a transaction qualifies as a reorganization
under Section 368(a)(1)(A) of the Code.

 

(iii) Parent is making the representations and warranties in this Section
5.2(n) after consultation with its tax counsel and with full knowledge of the
terms of this Agreement.

(o) _No Other Representations and Warranties_. Except for the representations
and warranties of Parent and Merger Subs contained in this Section 5.2,
Parent and Merger Subs

 



-44-  are not making and have not made, and no other Person is making or has made
on behalf of Parent or Merger Subs, any express or implied representation or
warranty in connection with this Agreement or the transactions contemplated
hereby. Nothing in this Section 5.2 shall require Parent or Merger Subs to
make any disclosure that would violate the Anti-Collusion Rules, _provided_
that such disclosure is made to the Companys outside counsel.

transaction involves payments in excess of $500,000,000 and (B) Section
6.1(a)(ix) if the transaction involves spending or commitment to spend more

Company concludes at any time that there is a reasonable likelihood that the
adjusted operating income or earnings per share of the Company and its
Subsidiaries, on a consolidated basis, for the then-current fiscal quarter or

the basis therefore, and notify the Chief Financial Officer of Parent

in Section 6.1(d) of the Parent Disclosure Letter): (A) Parent shall not (1)
amend Parents certificate of incorporation or bylaws in any manner that
would prohibit or hinder, impede or delay in any material respect the Initial
Merger or the consummation of the other transactions contemplated hereby;
_provided_ that any amendment to its certificate of incorporation to increase
the authorized number of shares of any class or series of the capital stock
of Parent or to create a new series of capital stock of Parent shall in no way
be restricted by the foregoing, or (2) declare, set aside or pay any dividend
or distribution payable in cash, stock or property in respect of any capital
stock, other than normal quarterly cash dividends on the Parent Common Stock
as described in Section 6.1(d) of the Parent Disclosure Letter and other than

(B) Parent shall not, and shall not permit any of its Subsidiaries to, acquire
another business or merge or consolidate with any other Person or restructure,

-50-  materially delay or materially impair the consummation of the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement; (C) Parent and Merger Subs shall not knowingly
take or omit to take any action that would impair the enforceability of the
Credit Agreement, reduce the aggregate amount of Debt Financing under the

with respect to conditionality, are not less favorable in any material respect

Agreement) or adversely modify the terms and conditions thereof in a manner
that would reasonably be likely to prevent or materially impede or delay the
funding of the Debt Financing under the Credit Agreement; (D) Parent shall not
knowingly take or omit to take any action if such action or failure to act
would reasonably be likely to prevent or impede the Mergers from qualifying

Cravath a certificate executed by an officer of Parent, dated as of the
Closing Date, with such customary representations and warranties as Cravath
determines are necessary for it to be able to deliver the Cravath Opinion
(only to the extent Parent in good faith believes it is able to make such
representations and warranties truthfully) (the "Parent Certificate"). The
parties acknowledge and agree that the provisions of this Section
6.1(e) shall not create any independent conditions to the Closing.

(iii) Parent shall reasonably promptly notify the Company, and the
Company shall reasonably promptly notify the Parent, in each case if such
party becomes aware of any non-public fact or circumstance that would
reasonably be likely to prevent or impede the Mergers from qualifying for the
Intended Tax Treatment.

 

(f) If the Company receives from Cravath an opinion, on the basis of
representations and warranties set forth or referred to in such
opinion, dated as of the Closing Date, to the effect that the Mergers will
qualify for the Intended Tax Treatment (the "Cravath Opinion"), then the
parties agree to treat and report the Mergers for all Tax purposes (including
on all applicable Tax Returns) as qualifying for the Intended Tax Treatment.

(g) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in Section 6.1(a),
the Company and its Subsidiaries (i) shall not, without the prior written

$25,000,000.

 



-51- 6.2 _Acquisition Proposals_.

 

(a) _No Solicitation or Negotiation_. The Company agrees that, except as
expressly permitted by this Section 6.2, neither it nor any of its
Subsidiaries nor any of its or its Subsidiaries officers, directors and
employees shall, and it shall instruct and use reasonable best efforts to
cause its and its Subsidiaries investment bankers, attorneys, accountants and
other advisors, agents and representatives (a Persons directors, officers,
employees, investment bankers, attorneys, accountants and other advisors,
agents and representatives are hereinafter referred to as its "
_Representatives_ ") not to, directly or indirectly:

(i) initiate, solicit, knowingly encourage or otherwise knowingly facilitate
any inquiries or the making of any proposal or offer that constitutes, or
would reasonably be expected to lead to, any Acquisition Proposal;

(ii) engage or otherwise participate in any discussions or negotiations
relating to any Acquisition Proposal or any proposal or offer that would
reasonably be expected to lead to an Acquisition Proposal; or

 

(iii) provide any information or data to any Person in connection with any
Acquisition Proposal or any inquiry, proposal or offer that would reasonably
be expected to lead to an Acquisition Proposal; or

(iv) otherwise knowingly facilitate any effort or attempt to make
an Acquisition Proposal.

The Company shall, and the Company shall cause its Subsidiaries and use its
reasonable best efforts to cause its Representatives to, immediately cease
and cause to be terminated any discussions and negotiations with any Person
conducted heretofore with respect to any Acquisition Proposal, or proposal
that would reasonably be expected to lead to an Acquisition Proposal. The
Company will promptly inform the Persons referred to in the preceding sentence
of the obligations undertaken in this Section 6.2. The Company will promptly
request from each Person that has executed a confidentiality agreement in
connection with its consideration of making an Acquisition Proposal to return
or destroy (as provided in the terms of such confidentiality agreement) all
confidential information concerning the Company or any of its Subsidiaries
and promptly terminate all physical and electronic data access previously
granted to such Person.

(b) _Fiduciary Exception to No Solicitation Provision_. Notwithstanding
anything to the contrary in Section 6.2(a), prior to the time, but not after,
the Company Requisite

 



-52-  Vote is obtained, the Company may, in response to an unsolicited, bona fide
written Acquisition Proposal made after the date of this Agreement, (i)
contact the Person who made such Acquisition Proposal and its Representatives
solely to clarify the terms and conditions thereof, and (ii) provide access to
information regarding the Company or any of its Subsidiaries in response to a
request therefor to the Person who made such Acquisition Proposal and such
Persons Representatives; _provided_ that such information has previously
been, or is substantially concurrently, made available to Parent and that,
prior to furnishing any such non-public information, the Company receives
from the Person making such Acquisition Proposal an executed confidentiality
agreement with terms at least as restrictive in all material respects on such
Person as the Confidentiality Agreement (as defined in Section 9.7) (it
being understood that such confidentiality agreement need not contain a
"standstill" or similar obligations to the extent that Parent is, concurrently
with the entry by the Company or its Subsidiaries into such confidentiality
agreement, released from any "standstill" or other similar obligations in the
Confidentiality Agreement); _provided_ , _however_ , that if the Person making
such Acquisition Proposal is a competitor of the Company and its Subsidiaries,
the Company shall not provide any information that in the good faith
determination of the Company constitutes commercially sensitive non-public
information to such Person in connection with any actions permitted by this
Section 6.2(b) other than in accordance with "clean room" or other similar
procedures designed to limit any potential adverse effect on the Company from
sharing such information; and (iii) participate in any discussions or
negotiations with any such Person and its Representatives regarding such
Acquisition Proposal, if, and only if, prior to taking any action described in
clause (ii) or (iii) above, the Board of Directors of the Company determines
in good faith after consultation with outside legal counsel that (A) failure
to take such action would be inconsistent with the directors fiduciary duties
under applicable Law and (B) based on the information then available and after
consultation with outside legal counsel and a financial advisor of nationally
recognized reputation, such Acquisition Proposal either constitutes a Superior
Proposal or would reasonably be expected to result in a Superior Proposal.

 

(c) _Notice_. The Company shall promptly notify Parent if (i) any inquiries,
proposals or offers with respect to an Acquisition Proposal are received by,
(ii) any non-public information is requested in connection with any
Acquisition Proposal from, or (iii) any discussions or negotiations with
respect to an Acquisition Proposal are sought to be initiated or continued
with, it, its Subsidiaries or any of their respective Representatives,
indicating, in connection with such notice, the name of such Person and the
material terms and conditions of any proposals or offers (including, if
applicable, copies of any written requests, proposals or offers, including
proposed agreements) and thereafter shall keep Parent informed, on a
reasonably current basis, of the status and terms of any such proposals or
offers (including any amendments thereto) and the status of any such
discussions or negotiations, including any change in the Companys intentions
as previously notified.

(d)  _Definitions_. For purposes of this Agreement:

" _Acquisition Proposal_ " means (i) any proposal or offer from any Person or
group of Persons, other than Parent and its Subsidiaries, with respect to a
merger, joint venture, partnership, consolidation, dissolution, liquidation,
tender offer, recapitalization, reorganization, 

 



-53-  spin-off, extraordinary dividend, share exchange, business combination or
similar transaction involving the Company or any of its Subsidiaries which is
structured to permit such Person or group of Persons (or their shareholders)
to, directly or indirectly, acquire beneficial ownership of 15% or more of the
Companys consolidated total assets or any class of the Companys equity
interests and (ii) any acquisition by any Person or group of Persons (or
their shareholders) (other than Parent and its Subsidiaries) resulting in, or
proposal or offer, which if consummated would result in, any Person or group
of Persons (or their shareholders) (other than Parent and its Subsidiaries)
obtaining control (through Contract or otherwise) over or becoming the
beneficial owner of, directly or indirectly, in one or a series of related
transactions, 15% or more of the total voting power of any class of equity
securities of the Company, or 15% or more of the consolidated total assets
(including equity securities of its Subsidiaries) of the Company, in each case
other than the transactions contemplated by this Agreement.

 

" _Superior Proposal_ " means an unsolicited bona fide Acquisition Proposal
made after the date of this Agreement that would result in a Person or group
(or their shareholders) becoming, directly or indirectly, the beneficial owner
of, all or substantially all of the Companys consolidated total assets or
more than 50% of the total voting power of the equity securities of the
Company or the successor Person of the Company, that the Board of Directors of
the Company has determined in its good faith judgment is reasonably likely to
be consummated in accordance with its terms, taking into account all legal,
financial and regulatory aspects of the proposal and the Person or group of
Persons making the proposal, and, if consummated, would result in a
transaction more favorable to the Companys stockholders from a financial
point of view than the transaction contemplated by this Agreement (after
taking into account any revisions to the terms of the transaction contemplated
by this Agreement pursuant to Section 6.2(f) of this Agreement and the time
likely to be required to consummate such Acquisition Proposal).

(e) _No Change in Recommendation or Alternative Acquisition Agreement_. Except
as permitted by Section 6.2(f), the Board of Directors of the Company and
each committee of the Board of Directors shall not (i) withhold, withdraw,
qualify or modify (or publicly propose or resolve to withhold, withdraw,
qualify or modify), in a manner adverse to Parent, the Company Recommendation
(it being understood that if any Acquisition Proposal structured as a tender
or exchange offer is commenced, the Board of Directors of the Company failing
to recommend against acceptance of such tender or exchange offer by the
Companys stockholders within 10 business days of commencement thereof
pursuant to Rule 14d-2 of the Exchange Act shall be considered a modification
adverse to Parent); (ii) approve or recommend, or publicly declare advisable
or publicly propose to enter into, any letter of intent, memorandum of
understanding, agreement in principle, acquisition agreement, merger
agreement, option agreement, joint venture agreement, partnership agreement,
lease agreement or other agreement (other than a confidentiality agreement
referred to in Section 6.2(b) entered into in compliance with Section 6.2(b))
relating to any Acquisition Proposal (an " _Alternative Acquisition Agreement_
"); or (iii) cause or permit the Company to enter into an Alternative
Acquisition Agreement.

 



-54- (f) _Fiduciary Exception to Change in Recommendation Provision_.
Notwithstanding anything to the contrary set forth in this Agreement, prior
to the time, but not after, the Company Requisite Vote is obtained, (i) the
Board of Directors of the Company may withhold, withdraw, qualify or modify
the Company Recommendation or approve, recommend or otherwise declare
advisable any Acquisition Proposal made after the date of this Agreement that
did not result from or in connection with a material breach of this Agreement,
if (A) (I) in the case of such an action taken in connection with an
Acquisition Proposal, the Acquisition Proposal is not withdrawn and the Board
of Directors of the Company determines in good faith, after consultation with
outside counsel and a financial advisor of nationally recognized reputation,
that such Acquisition Proposal constitutes a Superior Proposal; or (II) in the
case of such an action taken other than in connection with an Acquisition
Proposal, a development or change in circumstances occurs or arises after the
date of this Agreement that was not known by nor was reasonably foreseeable
to the Board of Directors of the Company as of the date of this Agreement and
(B) the Board of Directors of the Company determines in good faith, after
consultation with outside counsel and a financial advisor of nationally
recognized reputation, that the failure to take such action would be
inconsistent with its fiduciary duties under applicable Law (a " _Change in
Recommendation_ ", it being understood that a customary "stop, look and
listen" disclosure in compliance with Rule 14d-9(f) of the Exchange Act shall
not, in and of itself, constitute a Change in Recommendation), and/or (ii) the
Company may terminate this Agreement in accordance with Section 8.3(b) and
concurrently with such termination cause the Company to enter into an
Alternative Acquisition Agreement providing for a Superior Proposal that did
not result from or in connection with a material breach of this Agreement
(a " _Superior Proposal Termination_ "); _provided_ that in no event shall
the Company take, or agree or resolve to take, any action under this Section
6.2(f) other than in compliance with this Section 6.2; _provided_   _further_
that no Change in Recommendation and/or Superior Proposal Termination may be
made until after at least five business days following Parents receipt of
written notice from the Company advising that the Companys Board
of Directors intends to take such action and the basis therefor (which notice
shall include a copy of any such Superior Proposal and a copy of any relevant
proposed transaction agreements, the identity of the party making such
Superior Proposal and the material terms thereof or, in the case of notice
given other than in connection with a Superior Proposal, a reasonably detailed
description of the development or change in connection with which the
Companys Board of Directors has given such notice). After providing such
notice and prior to effecting such Change in Recommendation and/or Superior
Proposal Termination, (x) the Company shall, during such five business day
period, negotiate in good faith with Parent and its Representatives, to the
extent Parent wishes to negotiate, with respect to any revisions to the terms
of the transaction contemplated by this Agreement proposed by Parent, and (y)
in determining whether it may still under the terms of this Agreement make a
Change in Recommendation and/or effect a Superior Proposal Termination, the
Board of Directors of the Company shall take into account any changes to the
terms of this Agreement proposed by Parent and any other information provided
by Parent in response to such notice during such five business day period.
Any amendment to the financial terms or conditions or other material terms of
any Acquisition Proposal will be deemed to be a new Acquisition Proposal for
purposes of this Section 6.2(f), including with respect to the notice period
referred to in this Section 6.2(f), except that the five business day period
shall be three business days for such purposes in any such case.

 



-55- (g) _Limits on Release of Standstill and Confidentiality_. From the date of
this Agreement until the Effective Time, the Company shall not terminate,
amend, modify or waive any provision of any "standstill" or similar obligation
to which the Company or any of its Subsidiaries is a party and shall enforce,
to the fullest extent permitted under applicable Law, the provisions of any
such agreement, including by seeking injunctions to prevent any breaches of
such agreements and to enforce specifically the terms and provisions thereof.
Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this Agreement, the
Company shall be permitted to fail to enforce any provision of any
"standstill" or similar obligation of any Person if the Board of Directors of
the Company determines in good faith, after consultation with its outside
legal counsel, that the failure to take such action is necessary in order for
the directors to comply with their fiduciary duties under applicable Law;
_provided_ that the Company promptly advises Parent that it is taking such
action and the identity of the party or parties with respect to which it is
taking such action; _provided_ , _further_ , that the foregoing shall not
restrict the Company from permitting a Person to orally request the waiver of
a "standstill" or similar obligation to the extent necessary to comply with
fiduciary duties under applicable Law.

 

(h) _Certain Permitted Disclosure_. Nothing contained in this Section 6.2
shall be deemed to prohibit the Company from complying with its disclosure
obligations under applicable U.S. federal or state Law with regard to an
Acquisition Proposal; _provided_ that this paragraph (h) shall not be deemed
to permit the Company or the Companys Board of Directors to effect a Change
in Recommendation except in accordance with Section 6.2(f).

6.3 _Information Supplied_. (a) The Company shall promptly prepare and file
with the SEC the Prospectus/Proxy Statement, and Parent shall prepare and file
with the SEC the Registration Statement on Form S-4 to be filed with the SEC
by Parent in connection with the issuance of shares of Parent Common Stock in
the Initial Merger (including the proxy statement and prospectus (the "
_Prospectus/Proxy Statement_ ") constituting a part thereof, the " _S-4
Registration Statement_ ") as promptly as practicable. Parent and the Company
each shall use its reasonable best efforts to have the S-4 Registration
Statement declared effective under the Securities Act as promptly as
practicable after such filing, and promptly thereafter the Company shall mail
the Prospectus/Proxy Statement to the stockholders of the Company. The Company
and Parent shall also use their respective reasonable best efforts to satisfy
prior to the effective date of the S-4 Registration Statement all
necessary state securities Law or "blue sky" notice requirements in
connection with the Initial Merger and to consummate the other transactions
contemplated by this Agreement and pay all expenses incident thereto.

 

(b) No filing of, or amendment or supplement to, the S-4 Registration
Statement will be made by Parent, and no filing of, or amendment
or supplement to, the Prospectus/Proxy Statement will be made by the Company
or Parent, in each case without providing the other party a reasonable
opportunity to review and comment thereon (other than, in each case, any
filing, amendment or supplement in connection with a Change in
Recommendation). Each of the Company and Parent shall promptly provide the
other with copies of all such filings, amendments or supplements to the extent
not readily publicly available. Each of the Company and Parent shall furnish
all information concerning such Person and its Affiliates to the other and
provide such other assistance as may be reasonably requested

 



-56-  by such other party to be included therein and shall otherwise reasonably
assist and cooperate with the other in the preparation of the Prospectus/Proxy
Statement, the S-4 Registration Statement and the resolution of any comments
to either received from the SEC. If at any time prior to the receipt of the
Company Requisite Vote, any information relating to the Company or Parent, or
any of their respective Affiliates, directors or officers, should be
discovered by the Company or Parent which is required to be set forth in an
amendment or supplement to either the S-4 Registration Statement or the
Prospectus/Proxy Statement, so that either such document would not include
any misstatement of a material fact or omit to state any material fact
required to be stated therein or necessary to make the statements therein, in
light of the circumstances under which they were made, not misleading, the
party which discovers such information shall promptly notify the other party
and an appropriate amendment or supplement describing such information shall
be promptly filed with the SEC and, to the extent required by applicable Law,
disseminated to the stockholders of the Company. The parties shall notify
each other promptly of the receipt of any comments from the SEC or the staff
of the SEC and of any request by the SEC or the staff of the SEC for
amendments or supplements to the Prospectus/Proxy Statement or the S-4
Registration Statement or for additional information and shall supply each
other with copies of (i) all correspondence between it or any of its
Representatives, on the one hand, and the SEC or the staff of the SEC, on the
other hand, with respect to the Prospectus/Proxy Statement, the S-4
Registration Statement or the Mergers and (ii) all orders of the SEC relating
to the S-4 Registration Statement. No response to any comments from the SEC or
the staff of the SEC relating to the Prospectus/Proxy Statement or the S-4
Registration Statement will be made by the Company or Parent, in each case
without providing the other party a reasonable opportunity to review and
comment thereon unless pursuant to a telephone call initiated by the SEC. The
Company and Parent will cause the S-4 Registration Statement and the
Prospectus/Proxy Statement to comply as to form in all material respects with
the applicable provisions of the Securities Act and the Exchange Act and the
rules and regulations thereunder.

6.4 _Stockholders Meeting_. (a) The Company will use, in accordance with
applicable Law and the Company Charter and Company Bylaws, its reasonable
best efforts to convene and hold a meeting of holders of Shares to consider
and vote upon the adoption of this Agreement (the " _Company Stockholders
Meeting_ ") not more than 45 days after the date the S-4 Registration
Statement is declared effective. Subject to the provisions of Section 6.2, the
Companys Board of Directors shall include the Company Recommendation in the
Prospectus/Proxy Statement and recommend at the Company Stockholders Meeting
that the holders of Shares adopt this Agreement and shall use its reasonable
best efforts to obtain and solicit such adoption. Notwithstanding the
foregoing, if on a date preceding the date on which or the date on which the
Company Stockholders Meeting is scheduled, the Company reasonably believes
that (i) it will not receive proxies representing the Company Requisite Vote,
whether or not a quorum is present, or (ii) it will not have enough Shares
represented to constitute a quorum necessary to conduct the business of the
Company Stockholders Meeting, the Company may postpone or adjourn, or make one
or more successive postponements or adjournments of, the Company Stockholders
Meeting as long as the date of the Company Stockholders Meeting is not
postponed or adjourned more than an aggregate of 15 calendar days in
connection with any postponements or adjournments in reliance on the preceding
sentence. In addition, notwithstanding the first sentence of this Section
6.4(a), the Company may postpone or adjourn

 



-57-  the Company Stockholders Meeting to allow reasonable additional time for the
filing or mailing of any supplemental or amended disclosure that the Company
has determined, after consultation with outside legal counsel, is reasonably
likely to be required under applicable Law and for such supplemental or
amended disclosure to be disseminated and reviewed by stockholders of the
Company prior to the Company Stockholders Meeting.

 

(b) Notwithstanding any Change in Recommendation, the Company shall
nonetheless submit this Agreement to the holders of Shares for adoption
at the Company Stockholders Meeting unless this Agreement is terminated in
accordance with Article VIII prior to the Company Stockholders Meeting.
Without the prior written consent of Parent, the adoption of this Agreement
shall be the only matter (other than matters of procedure and matters
required by Law to be voted on by the Companys stockholders in connection
with the adoption of this Agreement and the transactions contemplated hereby)
that the Company shall propose to be acted on by the stockholders of the
Company at the Company Stockholders Meeting.

6.5 _Filings; Other Actions; Notification_.

 

(a) _Cooperatio_ _n_. (i) The Company and Parent shall, subject to Section
6.2, cooperate with each other and use, and shall cause their respective
Subsidiaries to use, their respective reasonable best efforts to take or cause
to be taken all actions, and do or cause to be done all things, necessary,
proper or advisable on its part under this Agreement and applicable Laws and
Orders to consummate and make effective the Mergers and the other transactions
contemplated by this Agreement as promptly as reasonably practicable,
including preparing and filing as promptly as reasonably practicable
all documentation to effect all necessary notices, reports and other filings
(including by filing as soon as reasonably practicable after the date of this
Agreement the notifications, filings and other information required to be
filed under the HSR Act or any Foreign Competition Laws with respect to the
transactions contemplated hereby) and to obtain as promptly as reasonably
practicable all consents, registrations, approvals, permits, expirations of
waiting periods and authorizations necessary or advisable to be obtained from
any third party and/or any Governmental Entity in order to consummate the
Mergers or any of the other transactions contemplated by this Agreement. In
furtherance and not in limitation of the covenants of the parties contained
in this Section 6.5 (but subject to Section 6.5(b) below), each of the parties
hereto shall use its reasonable best efforts to resolve such objections, if
any, as may be asserted by any Governmental Entity in connection with the HSR
Act, any other applicable Antitrust Laws or any Communications Laws with
respect to the transactions contemplated hereby and to avoid the entry of, or
effect the dissolution of, any decree, order, judgment, injunction, temporary
restraining order or other order in any suit or proceeding, that would
otherwise have the effect of preventing the consummation of the transactions
contemplated hereby (including by defending any lawsuits or other legal
proceedings, whether judicial or administrative, challenging this Agreement
or the Mergers). Subject to applicable Laws relating to the exchange of
information, each of Parent and the Company shall have the right to review in
advance, and to the extent practicable each will consult the other on, all of
the information relating to Parent or the Company, as the case may be, and any
of their respective Subsidiaries, that appears in any filing made with, or
written materials submitted to, any third party and/or any Governmental Entity
in connection with the Mergers and the other transactions contemplated by

 



-58-  this Agreement. To the extent permitted by applicable Law, each party shall
provide the other with copies of all material written correspondence between
it (or its advisors) and any Governmental Entity relating to the Mergers and
the other transactions contemplated by this Agreement and, to the extent
reasonably practicable, all telephone calls and meetings with a Governmental
Entity regarding the transactions contemplated by this Agreement shall
include representatives of Parent and the Company. Parent and the Company
shall coordinate with respect to Antitrust Laws and Communications Laws and
with respect to the appropriate course of action with respect to obtaining
the consents, approvals, permits, waiting period expirations or
authorizations of any Governmental Entity required to consummate the Mergers
prior to the Termination Date. In furtherance of the foregoing and to the
extent permitted by applicable Law, (A) each party shall notify the other, as
far in advance as practicable, of any filing or material or substantive
communication or inquiry it or any of its Subsidiaries intends to make with
any Governmental Entity relating to the matters that are the subject of this
Section 6.5(a), (B) prior to submitting any such filing or making any such
communication or inquiry, such party shall provide the other party and its
counsel a reasonable opportunity to review, and shall consider in good faith
the comments of the other party in connection with, any such filing,
communication or inquiry, (C) promptly following the submission of such filing
or making such communication or inquiry, provide the other party with a copy
of any such filing or, if in written form, communication or inquiry, and (D)
consult with the other party in connection with any inquiry, hearing,
investigation or litigation by, or negotiations with, any Governmental Entity
relating to the Mergers, including the scheduling of, and strategic planning
for, any meetings with any Governmental Entity relating thereto. In exercising
the foregoing rights, the Company and Parent each shall act reasonably and as
promptly as reasonably practicable. Without limiting the foregoing, the
Company will encourage CME to cooperate, as reasonably requested by Parent, to
take the actions that the Company is required under this Section 6.5(a) to
cause its Subsidiaries take. As used in this Agreement, the term " _Antitrust
Laws_ " means the Sherman Antitrust Act, the Clayton Antitrust Act of 1914,
the HSR Act and all other federal, state and foreign statutes, rules,
regulations, orders, decrees and other Laws and Orders that are designed or
intended to prohibit, restrict or regulate actions having the purpose or
effect of monopolization or restraint of trade or competition.

 

(b) For the purposes of this Section 6.5, "reasonable best efforts" shall
include taking any and all actions necessary to obtain the consents,
approvals, permits, waiting period expirations or authorizations of any
Governmental Entity required to consummate the Mergers prior to the
Termination Date (including agreeing to regulatory conditions that would have
a serious and significant adverse impact on the current or future business or
operations of Parent and its Subsidiaries, including the Company and its
Subsidiaries) (the " _Regulatory Actions_ "); _provided_ that nothing in this
Agreement shall require Parent or its Subsidiaries (including the Company and
its Subsidiaries) to take or refrain from taking, or agree to take or refrain
from taking, any action or actions that, individually or in the aggregate,
would (i) be reasonably likely to have a Combined Entertainment Group
Material Effect, (ii) result in a material increase in the aggregate capital
expenditures of Parent and its Subsidiaries from the Closing Date through 2021
relative to the aggregate corresponding amounts in Parents consolidated
2017-2021 capital budget as provided to the Company prior to the date of this
Agreement, or (iii) require Parent or its Subsidiaries to divest, dispose of
or hold separate any businesses or assets of Parent or its 

 



-59-  Subsidiaries (not including any businesses or assets of the Company and its
Subsidiaries) that are more than de minimis (the occurrence of any of the
matters specified in clauses (i) through (iii), a " _Regulatory Material
Adverse Effect_ "). The Company and its Subsidiaries shall not agree to any
such actions without the prior written consent of Parent which, subject to and
without limiting Parents obligations under this Section 6.5, may be granted
or withheld in Parents sole discretion. For purposes of this Section 6.5, "
_Combined Entertainment Group Material Effect_ " means a material adverse
effect on the financial condition, properties, assets, business or results of
operations of the Combined Entertainment Group, treating for this purpose the
effects of all Regulatory Actions wherever imposed (whether on Parent, its
Subsidiaries, the Company and/or its Subsidiaries), as if they affected a
company the size of, and having the financial and operating metrics of, the
Combined Entertainment Group. " _Combined Entertainment Group_ " means the
businesses included in Parents "Entertainment Group Segment Results" as of
the date hereof, together with the businesses of the Company and its
Subsidiaries.

(c)  _Information_. The Company and Parent each shall, upon request by the
other, promptly furnish the other with all information concerning itself, its
Subsidiaries, directors, officers and stockholders and such other matters as
may be reasonably necessary or advisable in connection with the
Prospectus/Proxy Statement, the S-4 Registration Statement and any other
statement, filing, notice or application made by or on behalf of Parent, the
Company or any of their respective Subsidiaries to any third party and/or any
Governmental Entity in connection with the Mergers and the other transactions
contemplated by this Agreement.

 

(d) _Status_. The Company and Parent each shall keep the other reasonably
apprised of the status of matters relating to completion of the transactions
contemplated hereby, including promptly furnishing the other with copies of
notice or other communications received by the Company or Parent, as the case
may be, or any of their respective Subsidiaries from any third party
and/or any Governmental Entity with respect to the Mergers and the other
transactions contemplated by this Agreement, other than immaterial
communications.

 

(e) _Post-Signing_. The Company shall provide Parent with all information
requested by Parent that is reasonably necessary to identify any Governmental
Consents required under any Foreign Regulatory Law applicable to the
consummation of the Mergers or the issuance of shares of Parent Common Stock
pursuant to the Initial Merger in jurisdictions not included on
Section 6.5(e) of the Company Disclosure Letter (" _Additional Consents_ ").
The parties shall use reasonable best efforts to identify any Additional
Consents within 30 days following the delivery by the Company of such
requested information to Parent. To the extent the parties identify any
Additional Consents, such Additional Consents shall be added to Section 7.1(c)
of the Company Disclosure Letter if the parties would have included them in
Section 7.1(c) of the Company Disclosure Letter as of the date hereof,
applying for this purpose the same standards of legal and business
significance as were used by the parties in agreeing Section 7.1(c) of the
Company Disclosure Letter as of the date hereof. In the event the parties
disagree about whether the Additional Consents would have been included, they
shall first have their General Counsels meet to attempt to resolve any
differences. In the event the parties are unable to agree whether
any amendment to Section 7.1(c) of the Company Disclosure Letter is required
by this Section 6.5(e), such dispute shall be settled by arbitration to be
held in New York, New

 



-60-  York in accordance with the commercial arbitration rules of the American
Arbitration Association then in effect. Such arbitration shall be conducted by
one arbitrator with at least 10 years experience in complex mergers and
acquisitions transactions mutually agreed upon by each party. Any decision
rendered thereby shall be final and binding on each of the parties and
judgment may be entered thereon in the appropriate state or federal court.
The arbitrators shall be bound to strict interpretation and observation of the
terms of this Agreement. Each party shall pay its own costs of arbitration.

 

6.6 _Access; Consultation_. (a) Upon reasonable notice, and except as may
otherwise be required by applicable Law, the Company shall, and shall cause
its Subsidiaries to, afford Parents Representatives reasonable access, during
normal business hours during the period prior to the First Effective Time, to
the Companys and its Subsidiaries employees, properties, assets, books,
records and contracts and, during such period, the Company and Parent shall,
and shall cause their respective Subsidiaries to, (i) in the case of Parent,
furnish promptly to the Company information regarding the matters set forth
in Section 6.6(a) of the Parent Disclosure Letter as may be reasonably
requested by the Company and (ii) in the case of the Company, furnish promptly
to Parent all information concerning its or any of its Subsidiaries capital
stock, business and personnel as may reasonably be requested by Parent;
_provided_ that no investigation pursuant to this Section 6.6 shall affect or
be deemed to modify any representation or warranty made by the Company or
Parent; and  _provided_ , _further_ , that the foregoing shall require
neither the Company nor Parent to permit any invasive environmental sampling
or any inspection or to disclose any information pursuant to this Section 6.6
to the extent that (i) in the reasonable good faith judgment of such party,
any applicable Law requires such party or its Subsidiaries to restrict or
prohibit access to any such properties or information, (ii) in the reasonable
good faith judgment of such party, the information is subject to
confidentiality obligations to a third party or (iii) disclosure of any such
information or document would result in the loss of attorney-client privilege;
_provided_ , _further_ , that with respect to clauses (i) through (iii) of
this Section 6.6(a), Parent or the Company, as applicable, shall use its
commercially reasonable efforts to (1) obtain the required consent of any such
third party to provide such inspection or disclosure, (2) develop an
alternative to providing such information so as to address such matters that
is reasonably acceptable to Parent and the Company and (3) in the case of
clauses (i) and (iii), implement appropriate and mutually agreeable measures
to permit the disclosure of such information in a manner to remove the basis
for the objection, including by arrangement of appropriate clean room
procedures, redaction or entry into a customary joint defense agreement with
respect to any information to be so provided, if the parties determine that
doing so would reasonably permit the disclosure of such information without
violating applicable Law or jeopardizing such privilege. Notwithstanding any
other provision of this agreement, (i) neither the Company nor Parent shall
disclose any information to the other where doing so would violate the Anti-
Collusion Rules, (ii) the Company shall not disclose to Parent any information
about its WPCH-TV television broadcasting business, and (iii) neither the
Company nor Parent shall disclose to the other any information about its
participation in FCC Auction 1000, unless, in the case of clauses (ii) and
(iii), outside counsel to both the Company and Parent agree that such
information may be exchanged consistent with the Anti-Collusion Rules. Any
investigation pursuant to this Section 6.6 shall be conducted in such a manner
as not to interfere unreasonably with the conduct of the business of the other
party. All requests for information made pursuant to this Section 6.6 shall
be directed to an executive officer of the Company or Parent, as applicable,
or such Person as may be designated by any such executive officer.

 



-61- (b) Each of Parent and the Company, as it deems advisable and necessary, may
reasonably designate competitively sensitive material provided to the other
as "Outside Counsel Only Material" or with similar restrictions. Such material
and the information contained therein shall be given only to the outside
counsel of the recipient, or otherwise as the restriction indicates, and be
subject to any additional confidentiality or joint defense agreement between
the parties. All information exchanged pursuant to this Section 6.6 shall be
subject to the Confidentiality Agreement. To the extent that any of the
information or material furnished pursuant to this Section 6.6 or otherwise in
accordance with the terms of this Agreement may include material subject to
the attorney-client privilege, work product doctrine or any other applicable
privilege concerning pending or threatened legal proceedings or governmental
investigations, the parties understand and agree that they have a commonality
of interest with respect to such matters and it is their desire,
intention and mutual understanding that the sharing of such material is not
intended to, and shall not, waive or diminish in any way the confidentiality
of such material or its continued protection under the attorney-client
privilege, work product doctrine or other applicable privilege. All such
information that is entitled to protection under the attorney-client
privilege, work product doctrine or other applicable privilege shall remain
entitled to such protection under these privileges, this Agreement, and under
the joint defense doctrine. Prior to the Effective Time, the Company and
Parent shall reasonably cooperate in identifying any actions or practices of
the Company or any of its Subsidiaries that could require remediation under
applicable Law and, to the extent identified, shall cooperate in taking
commercially reasonable actions or practices and other customary actions to
reduce the risks related to such actions where the failure to remediate would
reasonably be likely to result in substantial fines or penalties.

(c) (i) Each of the Company and Parent shall give prompt notice to one another
of any change, effect, circumstance or development that would reasonably be
likely to result in a Company Material Adverse Effect or Parent Material
Adverse Effect (as applicable), or of any reasonably likely failure of any
condition to Parents or the Companys obligations to effect the Mergers (as
applicable) and (ii) the Company shall give reasonably prompt notice to Parent
upon the receipt of any notice alleging a material breach or default under any
Material Contract or Additional Contract; _provided_ that any failure to give
notice in accordance with the foregoing shall not in and of itself be deemed
to constitute the failure of any condition set forth in Section 7.2(b) or
Section 7.3(b) to be satisfied.

 

(d) The Company shall use its reasonable best efforts to deliver to Parent,
within 60 days after the date of this Agreement, a complete list of the
material registered U.S. Intellectual Property of the Company and its
Subsidiaries.

6.7 _Stock Exchange Listing, De-listing and De-registration_. Parent shall
use its reasonable best efforts to cause the shares of Parent Common Stock to
be issued in the Initial Merger to be approved for listing on the NYSE,
subject to official notice of issuance, prior to the First Effective Time.
The Company shall take all actions necessary to permit the Shares and any

 



-62-  other security issued by the Company or one of its Subsidiaries and listed
on the NYSE to be de-listed from the NYSE and de-registered under the Exchange
Act as soon as possible following the Effective Time.

6.8 _Publicity_. The initial press release with respect to the Mergers and the
other transactions contemplated hereby shall be a joint press release and
thereafter the Company and Parent shall consult with each other prior to
issuing or making, and provide each other the opportunity to review and
comment on, any press releases or other public announcements with respect to
the Mergers and the other transactions contemplated by this Agreement and any
filings with any third party and/or any Governmental Entity (including any
national securities exchange) with respect thereto, except (i) as may
be required by applicable Law or by obligations pursuant to any listing
agreement with or rules of any national securities exchange or the NYSE, (ii)
any consultation that would not be reasonably practicable as a result of
requirements of applicable Law, (iii) any press release or public statement
that in the good faith judgment of the applicable party is consistent with
prior press releases issued or public statements made in compliance with this
Section 6.8 or (iv) with respect to any Change in Recommendation made in
accordance with this Agreement or Parents response thereto.

6.9 _Employee Benefits_.

 

(a) Parent agrees that each Company Employee who continues to remain employed
with the Company or its Subsidiaries (a " _Continuing Employee_ ") shall,
during the period commencing at the First Effective Time and ending on
December 31 of the calendar year following the calendar year in which the
First Effective Time occurs (the " _Continuation Period_ "), be provided with
(i) a base salary or base wage that is no less favorable than the base salary
or base wage provided to such Continuing Employee by the Company and its
Subsidiaries immediately prior to the First Effective Time and (ii) target
annual cash bonus opportunities and target long-term incentive compensation
opportunities (which, for the avoidance of doubt, may be delivered to
Continuing Employees who reside or work outside of the United States in the
form of unrestricted or deferred cash or phantom or notional equity-based
incentive programs) that are no less favorable in the aggregate than the
target annual cash bonus opportunities and target long-term incentive
compensation opportunities provided to such Continuing Employee by the
Company and its Subsidiaries immediately prior to the First Effective Time.
Parent agrees that Continuing Employees shall, during the Continuation Period,
be provided with pension and welfare benefits that are substantially
comparable in the aggregate to those provided by the Company and its
Subsidiaries to such Continuing Employees as of immediately prior to the First
Effective Time. Additionally, Parent agrees that each Continuing Employee
shall, during the period commencing at the First Effective Time and ending on
the second anniversary of the First Effective Time, be provided with severance
benefits that are no less favorable than the severance benefits provided by
the Company and its Subsidiaries to such Continuing Employee immediately
prior to the First Effective Time (or such greater benefits that are required
after giving effect to the acknowledgment in Section 6.9(f)).

 

(b) Parent shall or shall cause the Initial Surviving Company to provide that
no pre-existing conditions, exclusions or waiting periods shall apply to
Company Employees

 



-63-  under the benefit plans provided for those employees except to the extent
such condition or exclusion was applicable to an individual Company Employee
prior to the Effective Time. With respect to the plan year during which the
First Effective Time occurs, Parent shall provide each Company Employee with
credit for deductibles and out-of-pocket requirements paid prior to the
Closing Date in satisfying any applicable deductible or out-of-
pocket requirements under any Parent plan in which such Company Employee is
eligible to participate following the Closing Date.

(c) From and after the Closing Date, Parent shall or shall cause the Initial
Surviving Company to, provide credit (without duplication) to Company
Employees for their service recognized by the Company and its Subsidiaries as
of the First Effective Time for purposes of eligibility, vesting, continuous
service, determination of service awards, vacation, paid time off, and
severance entitlements to the same extent and for the same purposes as such
service was credited under the Company Plans,  _provided_ that such service
shall not be recognized to the extent that such recognition would result in a
duplication of benefits for the same period of service for purposes of any
frozen or discontinued Parent plan or any frozen or discontinued portion of a
Parent plan or for purposes of benefit accrual under any defined benefit
pension plan or retiree medical plan, and _provided_ _further_ , that if "hire
date" is used to determine the particular Parent plan or benefit structure in
which a Company Employee would participate, if any, then "hire date," solely
for such purposes, shall be the Closing Date.

 

(d) Prior to the First Effective Time, if requested by Parent in writing, to
the extent permitted by applicable Law and the terms of the applicable plan
or arrangement, the Company shall use commercially reasonable efforts to cause
each of the Companys 401(k) plans, other than the Company Savings Plan (the "
_Company 401(k) Plans_ "), to be terminated effective immediately prior to
the First Effective Time, and Parent shall, or shall cause one of its
Subsidiaries to, provide the Continuing Employees who participated in such
terminated Company 401(k) Plans eligibility to participate in a 401(k) plan
of Parent or one of its Subsidiaries. In the event that Parent requests that
the Company 401(k) Plans be terminated, the Company shall provide Parent with
evidence that it used commercially reasonable efforts to terminate such Plans
(the form and substance of which shall be subject to review by Parent) not
later than the business day immediately preceding the First Effective Time.

 

(e) Annual bonuses for the year in which the Closing occurs shall be treated
in accordance with the terms set forth in Section 6.9(e) of the Company
Disclosure Letter.

(f) Parent hereby acknowledges that the consummation of the Mergers or the
other transactions contemplated hereby will constitute a "change in control"
or "change of control" (or other similar phrase) for purposes of any Company
Plan that contains a definition of "change in control" or "change of control"
(or similar phrase), as applicable, other than those Company Plans set forth
on Section 6.9(f) of the Company Disclosure Letter.

(g) Prior to making any written or material oral communications to the
directors, officers or employees of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries
pertaining to the treatment of compensation or benefits in connection with the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement, the Company shall provide Parent
with a copy of the intended communication, and Parent shall have a reasonable
period of time to review and comment on the communication.

 



-64- (h) Notwithstanding the foregoing, with respect to any Company Employee who
is, or becomes, subject to a CBA, all compensation and benefits treatment and
terms and conditions of employment afforded to such Company Employee shall be
provided in accordance with such collective bargaining agreement or other
agreement with a labor union or like organization and the terms of this
Section 6.9 shall not apply.

(i) From and after the First Effective Time, Parent and its Subsidiaries
(including the Final Surviving Entity and its Subsidiaries) shall honor all
Company Plans in accordance with their terms as in effect immediately prior to
the First Effective Time. Notwithstanding the foregoing, no provision of
this Agreement shall limit the ability of Parent and its Subsidiaries
(including the Surviving Company and its Subsidiaries) to provide compensation
and benefits to Continuing Employees in accordance with this Agreement through
plans of Parent or its Subsidiaries after the First Effective Time.

(j) The provisions of this Section 6.9 are solely for the benefit of the
parties to this Agreement, and neither any union nor any current or former
employee, nor any other individual associated therewith, is or shall be
regarded for any purpose as a third party beneficiary to this Agreement.
Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement (except to the
extent provided in Section 9.8), no provision of this Agreement is intended
to, or does, (i) constitute the establishment of, or an amendment to, any
Company Plan or any employee benefit plan of Parent, the Final Surviving
Entity or any of their Affiliates, (ii) alter or limit the ability of Parent
to amend, modify or terminate any Company Plan or any other benefit plan,
program, agreement or arrangement, (iii) give any third party any right to
enforce the provisions of this Section 6.9, (iv) prevent Parent, the Final
Surviving Entity or any of their Affiliates, after the First Effective Time,
from terminating the employment of any Company Employee or (v) be deemed to
confer upon any such individual or legal representative any rights under or
with respect to any plan, program or arrangement described in or contemplated
by this Agreement, and each such individual or legal representative shall be
entitled to look only to the express terms of any such plan, program or
arrangement for his or her rights thereunder.

6.10 _Expenses_. Except as otherwise provided in Sections 6.15 and 8.5,
whether or not the Mergers are consummated, all costs and expenses incurred in
connection with this Agreement and the Mergers and the other transactions
contemplated by this Agreement shall be paid by the party incurring such
expense, except that expenses incurred in connection with the filing fee for
the S-4 Registration Statement and printing and mailing the Prospectus/Proxy
Statement and the S-4 Registration Statement shall be shared equally by Parent
and the Company.

 

6.11 _Indemnification; Directors_ __ _and Officers_ __ _Insurance_. (a) From
and after the First Effective Time, Parent shall, and shall cause the Initial
Surviving Company to, indemnify and hold harmless each present and former
director and officer of the Company determined as of the First Effective Time
(the " _Indemnified Parties_ "), against any costs or

 



-65-  expenses (including reasonable attorneys fees), judgments, fines, losses,
claims, damages or liabilities incurred in connection with any claim, action,
suit, proceeding or investigation, whether civil, criminal, administrative or
investigative (including with respect to matters existing or occurring at or
prior to the First Effective Time (including this Agreement and the
transactions and actions contemplated hereby)), arising out of the fact that
such Indemnified Party is or was a director, officer, employee or agent of the
Company, or is or was serving at the request of the Company as a director,
officer, employee or agent of another Person prior to the First
Effective Time, in each case, whether asserted or claimed prior to, at or
after the First Effective Time, to the fullest extent that the Company would
have been permitted under Delaware Law, the Company Charter or Company Bylaws
in effect on the date of this Agreement to indemnify such Person (and Parent
and the Initial Surviving Company shall also advance expenses as incurred to
the fullest extent permitted under applicable Law; _provided_ that the Person
to whom expenses are advanced shall provide an undertaking to repay such
advances if it is ultimately determined that such Person is not entitled to
indemnification). Parent shall ensure that the organizational documents of the
Initial Surviving Entity shall, for a period of six years from and after the
First Effective Time, contain provisions no less favorable with respect to
indemnification, advancement of expenses and exculpation of present and former
directors, officers, employees and agents of the Company and its Subsidiaries
than are presently set forth in the Company Charter and Company Bylaws. Any
right of indemnification of an Indemnified Party pursuant to this Section 6.11
shall not be amended, repealed or otherwise modified at any time in a manner
that would adversely affect the rights of such Indemnified Party as provided
herein.

(b) Prior to the First Effective Time, the Company shall and, if the Company
is unable to, Parent shall cause the Initial Surviving Company as of the First
Effective Time to, obtain and fully pay for "tail" insurance policies with a
claims period of at least six years from and after the First Effective Time
from an insurance carrier with the same or better credit rating as the
Companys current insurance carrier with respect to directors and officers
liability insurance and fiduciary liability insurance (collectively, " _D andO
Insurance_") with benefits and levels of coverage at least as favorable as the
Companys existing policies with respect to matters existing or occurring at
or prior to the First Effective Time (including in connection with this
Agreement or the transactions or actions contemplated hereby); _provided_ ,
_however_ , that in no event shall the Company expend for such policies a
premium amount in excess of 300% of the annual premiums currently paid by the
Company for such insurance. If the Company and the Initial Surviving Company
for any reason fail to obtain such "tail" insurance policies as of the First
Effective Time, the Initial Surviving Company shall, and Parent shall cause
the Initial Surviving Company to, continue to maintain in effect for a period
of at least six years from and after the First Effective Time the DandO
Insurance in place as of the date of this Agreement with benefits and levels
of coverage at least as favorable as provided in the Companys existing
policies as of the date of this Agreement, or the Initial Surviving Company
shall, and Parent shall cause the Initial Surviving Company to, purchase
comparable DandO Insurance for such six-year period with benefits and levels of
coverage at least as favorable as provided in the Companys existing policies
as of the date of this Agreement; _provided_ , _however_ , that in no event
shall the Company expend, or Parent or the Initial Surviving Company be
required to expend for such policies, an amount in excess of 300% of the
annual premiums currently paid by the Company for such insurance; and,
_provided_ _further_ that if the premium for such insurance coverage exceeds
such amount, the Initial Surviving Company shall obtain a policy with the
greatest coverage available for a cost not exceeding such amount.

 



-66- (c) If Parent or any of its successors or assigns (i) shall consolidate with
or merge into any other corporation or entity and shall not be the continuing
or surviving corporation or entity of such consolidation or merger or (ii)
shall transfer all or substantially all of its properties and assets to any
individual, corporation or other entity, then and in each such case proper
provisions shall be made so that the successors and assigns of Parent shall
assume all of the obligations of Parent set forth in this Section 6.11. If the
Subsequent Merger is consummated, from and after the Second Effective Time,
all references in this Section 6.11 to the Initial Effective Time shall be
deemed to refer to the Second Effective Time and all references to the Initial
Surviving Company shall be deemed to refer to the Final Surviving Entity,
_mutatis mutandis_.

(d) The provisions of this Section 6.11 are intended to be for the benefit of,
and shall be enforceable by, each of the Indemnified Parties, their heirs and
their representatives. The rights of each Indemnified Party under this Section
6.11 shall be in addition to any rights such individual may have under
Delaware Law, any applicable indemnification agreement to which such Person
is a party, the Company Charter or the Company Bylaws.

(e) None of Parent, the Initial Surviving Company or the Final Surviving
Entity shall settle, compromise or consent to the entry of any judgment in any
threatened or actual Proceeding for which indemnification could be sought by
an Indemnified Party hereunder, unless such settlement, compromise or consent
includes an unconditional release of such Indemnified Party from all liability
arising out of such Proceeding or such Indemnified Party otherwise consents in
writing (such consent not to be unreasonably withheld or delayed) to such
settlement, compromise or consent.

(f) Nothing in this Agreement is intended to, shall be construed to or shall
release, waive or impair any rights to directors and officers insurance
claims under any policy that is or has been in existence with respect to the
Company or any of its Subsidiaries for any of their respective directors,
officers or other employees, it being understood and agreed that the
indemnification provided for in this Section 6.11 is not prior to or in
substitution for any such claims under such policies.

 

6.12 _Takeover Statute_. If any Takeover Statute is or may become applicable
to the Mergers or the other transactions contemplated by this Agreement, the
Company and its Board of Directors shall grant such approvals and take such
actions as are necessary so that such transactions may be consummated as
promptly as practicable on the terms contemplated by this Agreement
and otherwise use reasonable best efforts to act to eliminate or minimize the
effects of such statute or regulation on such transactions.

 

6.13 _Control of the Company_ __ _s or Parent_ __ _s Operations_. Nothing
contained in this Agreement shall give Parent or the Company, directly or
indirectly, rights to control or direct the operations of the other prior to
the First Effective Time. Prior to the First Effective Time, each of Parent
and the Company shall exercise, consistent with the terms and conditions of
this Agreement, complete control and supervision of its operations.

 



-67- 6.14 _Section_ _16(b)_. The Board of Directors of each of the Company and
Parent (or, in each case, a duly authorized committee thereof) shall, prior
to the First Effective Time, take all such actions as may be necessary or
appropriate to cause the transactions contemplated by this Agreement and any
other dispositions of equity securities of the Company (including derivative
securities) or acquisitions of Parent Common Stock (including derivative
securities) in connection with the transactions contemplated by this Agreement
by each individual who is a director or executive officer of the Company to
be exempt under Rule 16b-3 promulgated under the Exchange Act.

6.15 _Financing_.

 

(a) Upon the written request of Parent, the Company and its Subsidiaries shall
execute and deliver, or shall use reasonable best efforts to cause to be
executed and delivered, at the Closing, one or more supplemental indentures,
legal opinions, officers certificates or other documents or instruments
required for the due assumption of, and succession to, the Companys and/or
its Subsidiaries outstanding debt, guarantees, securities and other similar
agreements to the extent required by the terms of such debt, guarantees,
securities or other agreements and the Company and its Subsidiaries shall
provide all assistance reasonably required by Parent in connection with
obtaining the execution of such instruments (or any consents, waivers or
replacement guarantees or other instruments requested by Parent in relation to
such assumption or succession in respect of any of the Companys and/or its
Subsidiaries outstanding debt, guarantees, securities and other similar
agreements) by the other parties required to execute such instruments.

 

(b) The Company shall, and shall cause each of its Subsidiaries to, use its
commercially reasonable efforts to commence, as promptly as reasonably
practicable, at Parents expense, after the receipt of a written request from
Parent to do so, tender or exchange offers, and any related consent
solicitations with respect to, any or all of the outstanding notes, debentures
or other debt securities of the Company and/or its Subsidiaries on such terms
and conditions as specified and reasonably requested by Parent and in
compliance with all applicable terms and conditions of the applicable
indenture (the " _Debt Offers_ "); _provided_ that (i) Parent shall have
provided the Company with the offer to purchase, related letter of
transmittal, and other related documents (collectively, the " _Offer
Documents_ ") and (ii) the closing of the Debt Offers shall be conditioned on
the Closing. The Company shall, and shall cause its Subsidiaries to, use
respective reasonable best efforts to, and to cause their respective
representatives to, provide cooperation reasonably requested by Parent in
connection with the Debt Offers and any related consent solicitations. Parent
shall only request the Company and its Subsidiaries to conduct any Debt Offer
in compliance with the applicable rules and regulations of the SEC, including
Rule 14e-1 under the Exchange Act and the applicable indenture or other
Contract. Parent shall ensure that at the First Effective Time, the Initial
Surviving Company and the Final Surviving Entity shall have all funds
necessary to pay any consideration required to be paid in connection with the
Debt Offers on the Closing Date.

 



-68- (c) If requested by Parent in writing, the Company and its Subsidiaries shall
take any actions requested by Parent that are reasonably necessary for the
payoff, satisfaction, discharge and/or defeasance of any existing Indebtedness
of the Company or its Subsidiaries, and shall payoff, redeem or satisfy,
discharge and/or defease, as applicable, such Indebtedness in accordance with
the indenture, credit agreement, or other Contract governing such Indebtedness
(the " _Debt Payoffs_ "), including taking any action reasonably necessary to
obtain a payoff letter in connection therewith; _provided_ that any such
action described above shall not be required unless it can be and is
conditioned on the occurrence of the Closing, and, it being understood that at
Closing, Parent or its designee (which may be the Company) shall deposit with
the appropriate trustee, agent or other recipient, cash or cash equivalents
sufficient to actually effect such payoff, redemption, satisfaction, discharge
and/or defeasance. The Company shall, and shall cause its applicable
Subsidiaries to, use their respective reasonable best efforts to and to cause
their respective representatives to, provide cooperation reasonably requested
by Parent in connection with any Debt Payoff.

 

(d) In the event that the Company commences a Debt Offer, the Company
covenants and agrees that, promptly following any related
consent solicitation expiration date, assuming the requisite consents are
received, each of the Company and its Subsidiaries as is necessary shall (and
shall use their reasonable best efforts to cause the applicable trustee or
agent to) execute a supplemental indenture or amendment to the applicable
indenture or other Contract governing such Indebtedness, which shall implement
the amendments described in the Offer Documents, subject to the terms and
conditions of this Agreement (including the conditions to the Debt Offers)
and the applicable indenture or other Contract; _provided_ , _however_ , that
in no event shall the Company, any of its Subsidiaries or any of their
respective officers, directors or other representatives, have any obligation
to authorize, adopt or execute any supplemental indenture or other agreement
that would become effective prior to the Closing. Subject to the terms and
conditions of the Debt Offer, concurrently with the Closing, Parent
shall cause the Initial Surviving Company or the Final Surviving Entity, as
applicable, to accept for payment and thereafter promptly pay for, any
Indebtedness that has been validly tendered pursuant to and in accordance with
the Debt Offers and not properly withdrawn using funds provided by Parent.

(e) Parent shall prepare all necessary and appropriate documentation in
connection with any Debt Offers or Debt Payoffs, including the Offer
Documents, as applicable, and the Company shall have a reasonable opportunity
to review and comment upon such documents. The parties hereto shall, and shall
cause their respective Subsidiaries to, reasonably cooperate with each other
in the preparation of any Offer Documents or other appropriate documents. The
Company shall, to the extent requested, keep Parent reasonably informed
regarding the status, results and timing of the Debt Offers. If, at any time
prior to the completion of the Debt Offers, the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries, on the one hand, or Parent or any of its Subsidiaries, on the
other hand, discovers any information that should be set forth in
an amendment or supplement to the Offer Documents, so that the Offer
Documents shall not contain any untrue statement of a material fact or omit to
state any material fact required to be stated therein or necessary in order to
make the statements therein, in light of circumstances under which they are
made, not misleading, such party that discovers such information shall use
commercially reasonable efforts to promptly notify the other party, and an
appropriate 

 



-69-  amendment or supplement prepared by Parent describing such information shall
be disseminated by or on behalf of the Company or its Subsidiaries to the
holders of the applicable Indebtedness of the Company. Notwithstanding
anything to the contrary in this Section 6.15(e), the Company shall, and shall
cause its Subsidiaries to, comply with the requirements of Rule 14e-1 under
the Exchange Act and any other Law to the extent applicable in connection
with the Debt Offers or Debt Payoffs and such compliance will not be deemed a
breach hereof.

(f) In connection with any Debt Offer and any Debt Payoff, Parent may select
one or more dealer managers, information agents, depositaries and other
agents, in each case as shall be reasonably acceptable to the Company, to
provide assistance in connection therewith and the Company shall, and shall
cause its Subsidiaries to, enter into customary agreements with such parties
so selected; _provided_ that neither the Company nor any of its Subsidiaries
shall be required to indemnify, defend or hold harmless, or pay the fees or
reimburse the costs and expenses of, any such party, which indemnification,
fee and reimbursement obligations shall be borne by Parent pursuant to
separate agreements with such parties to which neither the Company nor any of
its Subsidiaries shall be a party or have any obligations under.

(g) From and after the date of this Agreement, and through the earlier of the
Closing and the date on which this Agreement is terminated in accordance with
Article VIII, the Company shall, and the Company shall cause each of its
Subsidiaries and use reasonable best efforts to cause its and their
representatives (including their auditors) to, use its respective reasonable
best efforts to provide all customary cooperation (including providing
reasonably available financial and other information regarding the Company and
its Subsidiaries for use in marketing and offering documents and to enable
Parent to prepare pro forma financial statements) as reasonably requested by
Parent to assist Parent in the arrangement of any bank debt financing or any
capital markets debt financing for the purposes of financing the payment of
the Cash Consideration, any repayment or refinancing of debt contemplated by
this Agreement or required in connection with the Mergers and the other
transactions contemplated by this Agreement and any other amounts required to
be paid in connection with the consummation of the Mergers (collectively, the
" _Debt Financing_ "); _provided_ , _however_ , that no obligation of the
Company or any of its Subsidiaries under such Debt Financing shall be
effective prior to the Closing. Without limiting the foregoing, the Company
will, and will encourage CME to, as reasonably requested by Parent, (i)
cooperate with Parent to communicate with CMEs lenders with respect to the
impact of the Mergers on, and use its reasonable best efforts in order to
assist in ensuring that the Mergers do not result in a default or event of
default on the part of CME, the Company or any of their Subsidiaries under the
terms of, CMEs indebtedness to the extent guaranteed by the Company and/or
any of its Subsidiaries, and (ii) cooperate with Parent in the arrangement of
any Debt Financing or other third party or intercompany financing for the
purposes of replacing CMEs indebtedness.

 

(h) Parent shall indemnify and hold harmless the Company and each of its
Subsidiaries and their respective Representatives from and against any and
all liabilities, losses, damages, claims, costs, expenses (including

or incurred in connection with any and all of the matters contemplated by this
Section 6.15 (other than arising from fraud or intentional misrepresentation

 



-70-  on the part of the Company or its Subsidiaries), whether or not the Mergers
are consummated or this Agreement is terminated. Parent shall, promptly upon
request by the Company, reimburse the Company for all reasonable out-of-
pocket costs (including reasonable attorneys fees) incurred by the Company or
its Subsidiaries in connection with this Section 6.15, whether or not the
Mergers are consummated or this Agreement is terminated. 

(i) The Company agrees that, from and after January 1, 2017 and prior to the
Effective Time, the Company and each of its Subsidiaries shall not file any
registration statement (other than on Form S-8 and other than prospectus
supplements to existing registration statements) or consummate any
unregistered offering of securities that by the terms of such offering
requires subsequent registration under the Securities Act; _provided_ that, a
reasonable amount of time prior to the offering of any securities (other than
on Form S-8) expected to be issued in a registered transaction or which
require registration, the Company will consult with Parent and consider in
good faith the suggestions of Parent that are designed to permit such offering
to be completed without registration under the Securities Act.

 

(j) Parent and Merger Subs acknowledge and agree that the provisions of this
Section 6.15 shall not create any independent conditions to Closing.

6.16 _Approval by Sole Stockholder of Corporate Sub and sole Member of Merger
LLC_. Immediately following the execution and delivery of this Agreement by
the parties hereto, Parent, as sole stockholder of Corporate Sub, shall adopt
this Agreement and approve the Merger, in accordance with Delaware Law, by
written consent. Immediately following the formation of Merger LLC in
accordance with Section 6.19, Parent, as sole member of Merger LLC, shall
approve and adopt this Agreement and approve the Subsequent Merger, in
accordance with Delaware Law, by written consent.

 

6.17 _Dividends_. The Company shall coordinate with Parent the declaration,
setting of record dates and payment dates of dividends on Shares in respect
of any calendar quarter so that holders of Shares do not receive dividends on
both Shares and Parent Common Stock received in the Initial Merger in respect
of the same calendar quarter or fail to receive a dividend on either Shares
or Parent Common Stock received in the Initial Merger in respect of the same
calendar quarter.

6.18 _Voting of Shares_. Parent shall vote, or cause to be voted, any Shares
owned by it or any of its Subsidiaries (other than, for the avoidance of
doubt, any such shares held by any employee benefit plan of Parent or any of
its Subsidiaries or any trustee or other fiduciary in such capacity under any
employee benefit plan) in favor of adoption of this Agreement at the Company
Stockholders Meeting.

 

6.19 _Formation of Merger LLC; Accession_. As promptly as reasonably
practicable after the date hereof, and in any event within five business days
after the date hereof, Parent shall form and organize Merger LLC as a Delaware
limited liability company, and from and after its formation and at the
Effective Time, Parent will be the sole member of Merger LLC. Promptly after
forming Merger LLC, (x) Parent, as the sole member of Merger LLC, shall
approve this Agreement and (y) Parent shall cause Merger LLC to accede to this
Agreement by

 



-71-  executing a signature page to this Agreement or a separate joinder
instrument acceptable to all parties, after which time Merger LLC shall be a
party hereto for all purposes set forth herein. Notwithstanding any provision
herein to the contrary, the obligations of Merger LLC to perform its
respective covenants hereunder, and the first date on which the accuracy of
Merger LLCs representations hereunder and warranties shall speak, shall
commence only at the time of its formation. From and after the date of its
formation and prior to the Effective Time, Merger LLC shall not engage in any
activities other than in connection with or as contemplated by this Agreement
or have any assets, liabilities or obligations of any nature other than those
incident to its formation and pursuant to this Agreement and the Mergers and
the other transactions contemplated by this Agreement.

 

6.20 _Alternative Structure_.

 

(a) The Company shall use reasonable best efforts to cause any agreement,
instrument or indenture with respect to indebtedness for borrowed money to
which the Company or any of its Subsidiaries is a party to be amended prior to
the date that is not later than the fifth business day prior to the date the
Form S-4 Registration Statement is declared effective, if Parent
reasonably determines that such amendment is necessary so that the Subsequent
Merger will not have any of the effects described in Section 5.1(d)(ii) (
_mutatis mutandi_ ) (without giving effect to (i) the Company Material Adverse
Effect exception at the end of Section 5.1(d)(ii) and (ii) any cure period or
notice requirement) with respect to such agreement, instrument or indenture
(an " _Indenture Impact_ "); _provided_ that without Parents prior written
consent the Company shall not make any non- _de minimis_ consent payments to
any third party in connection with the foregoing or agree to amend any of the
terms of such agreement, instrument or indenture except to amend the provision
giving rise to the Indenture Impact.

(b) In the event that either (i) the Mergers would reasonably be likely to
fail to qualify for the Intended Tax Treatment or (ii) the Subsequent Merger
would have an Indenture Impact, the parties agree (x) to cooperate in good
faith to explore alternative structures that would permit the transactions
contemplated hereby to qualify as a reorganization within the meaning
of Section 368(a) of the Code and (y) if each party to this Agreement in the
exercise of its reasonable business discretion agrees to pursue such an
alternative structure, the parties shall enter into an appropriate amendment
to this Agreement to reflect such alternative structure and provide for such
other changes necessitated thereby; _provided_ , _however_ , that failure of
the parties to agree to an alternative structure shall not cause any condition
to Closing set forth herein not to be satisfied or otherwise cause any breach
of this Agreement; and _provided_ , _further_ , that any actions taken
pursuant to this Section 6.20(b) (A) shall not (I) without the consent of the
Company and Parent, alter or change the amount, nature or mix of the Merger
Consideration or (II) impose any economic or other costs on Parent or the
Company that are more than immaterial and (B) shall be capable of consummation
without delay in relation to the structure contemplated herein.
Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the contrary, in no event shall
Parent be required to cause the Subsequent Merger to occur or to effect any
alternative structure if the foregoing would result in an Indenture Impact.

 

(c) In the event the Mergers would reasonably be likely to fail to qualify for
the Intended Tax Treatment, the parties may agree (in each partys reasonable
business discretion) not to consummate the Subsequent Merger. For the
avoidance of doubt, neither the identification nor the implementation of an
alternative structure under Section 6.20(b) above shall be a condition
to Closing.

over enforcement of any applicable Antitrust Laws, Communications Laws,
Utilities Laws or Foreign Regulatory Laws (each, a " _Governmental Regulatory
Entity_ ") with respect to an Antitrust Law, Communications Law, Utilities Law
or Foreign Regulatory Law or (ii) pursuant to Section 8.2(a) (Termination
Date) and, at the time of such termination, one or more of the conditions set

Section 7.2(c) was not satisfied and, in the case of each of (i) or (ii), at
the time of such termination (A) all of the other conditions set forth in
Section 7.1 and Section 7.2 have been satisfied or waived (except for those
conditions that by their nature are to be satisfied at the Closing, _provided_
that such conditions were then capable of being satisfied if the Closing had

its obligations under this Agreement in any manner that shall have proximately
contributed to the imposition of the Order referred to in clause (i) or the
failure of the conditions referred to in clause (ii) above, as applicable,
then Parent shall, within two business days after such termination, pay the

(the " _Parent Reimbursement Amount_ "). In no event shall Parent be required
to pay the Parent Reimbursement Amount on more than one occasion.

 

(d) Each party acknowledges that the agreements contained in this Section 8.5
are an integral part of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, and
that, without these agreements, no party would have entered into this
Agreement; accordingly, (i) if the Company fails to pay promptly the amount
due pursuant to Section 8.5(b) or (ii) if Parent fails to pay promptly the
amount due pursuant to Section 8.5(c) (any such amount due, a " _Payment_ "),
and, in order to obtain such Payment, the party entitled to receive such
Payment (the " _Recipient_ ") commences a suit which results in a judgment
against the party obligated to make such Payment (the " _Payor_ ") for the
applicable Payment, or any portion thereof, the Payor shall pay to the
Recipient its costs and expenses (including attorneys fees) in connection
with such suit, together with interest on the amount of the Payment at the

the Payor within five business days after receipt of such Payment, to refund
such Payment to the Payor, and in the event that the Payor actually receives a
full refund of the entire Payment within five business days after
the delivery of such notice (the " _Refund_ "), the Company, Parent and
Merger Subs shall be entitled to all remedies available as contemplated by
clause (1) of the proviso of Section 8.5(a). 

 



-78-  If, after receiving the Payment, the Recipient fails to exercise its right
to refund the Payment in accordance with the time periods provided for in this
Section 8.5(e), the Recipient shall be deemed to have irrevocably waived such
rights and Payor (and, if Parent is the Payor, Merger Subs) and its
Representatives shall have no further liability to the Recipient under this
Agreement except as set forth in Section 9.1, and except for fraud.

(f) If a Payment is required to be paid pursuant to this Section 8.5 and the
Recipient complies with the Refund provisions of Section 8.5(e) or the
Payment is not made, in each case such that the last sentence of Section
8.5(e) is not applicable, then the Recipient shall be entitled to all remedies
available under Section 8.5(a) of this Agreement. If a Payment is required to
be and is paid pursuant to this Section 8.5 and the Recipient does not comply
with the Refund provisions of Section 8.5(e) such that the last sentence of
Section 8.5(e) is applicable, then such Payment (together with any
additional amounts pursuant to Section 8.5(d)) shall, except for fraud, be
the sole and exclusive remedies of the Recipient and its respective
Subsidiaries and any of the Recipients or its Subsidiaries respective
former, current, or future general or limited partners, stockholders,
directors, officers, managers, members, Affiliates, agents and other
Representatives against the Payor or any of its Subsidiaries and any of their
respective former, current, or future general or limited
partners, stockholders, directors, officers, managers, members, Affiliates,
agents or other Representatives for any loss suffered as a result of any
breach of any covenant or agreement in this Agreement or the failure of the
Mergers or the other transactions contemplated by this Agreement to be
consummated.

(g) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement, none of the
Financing Sources shall have any liability to the Company or any Person that
is an Affiliate of the Company relating to or arising out of this Agreement,
the Debt Financing or otherwise, whether at law, or equity, in contract, in
tort or otherwise, and neither the Company nor any Person that is an
Affiliate of the Company shall have any rights or claims against any Financing
Sources hereunder or thereunder. As used in this Agreement, the term "
_Financing Sources_ " means any agent, arranger, lender or other entity that
has committed to provide or arrange, or has entered into definitive agreements
related to, the Debt Financing, or any of such Persons Affiliates or its or
their respective officers, directors, employees, partners, trustees,
shareholders, controlling persons, agents, representatives, successors or
assigns.

or to such other persons or addresses as may be designated in writing by the
party to receive such notice as provided above. 

9.7 _Entire Agreement_. This Agreement (including any exhibits hereto, the
Company Disclosure Letter and the Parent Disclosure Letter) and the
Confidentiality Agreement, dated August 29, 2016, between the Company and
Parent (the " _Confidentiality Agreement_ ") and the Clean Team
Confidentiality Agreement, dated October 17, 2016, between the Company and
Parent (the " _Clean Team Agreement_ ") constitute the entire agreement, and
supersede all other prior agreements, understandings, representations and
warranties both written and oral, among the parties, with respect to the
subject matter hereof.

 



-82- 9.8 _No Third Party Beneficiaries_. This Agreement is not intended to, and
does not, confer upon any Person other than the parties hereto any rights or
remedies hereunder, other than (a) as provided in Section 6.11
(Indemnification; Directors and Officers Insurance), (b) the right of the
Companys stockholders to receive the Merger Consideration after the Closing,
(c) the right of the holders of awards under the Company Stock Plans to
receive such consideration as provided for in Section 4.5 after the Closing
and (d) Sections 8.5(g), 9.2 and 9.5 which, to the extent applicable to the
Financing Sources, are intended to benefit, and be enforceable by, the
Financing Sources.

9.9  _Obligations of Parent and of the Company_. Whenever this Agreement
requires a Subsidiary of Parent to take any action, such requirement shall be
deemed to include an undertaking on the part of Parent to cause such
Subsidiary to take such action. Whenever this Agreement requires a Subsidiary
of the Company to take any action, such requirement shall be deemed to include
an undertaking on the part of the Company to cause such Subsidiary to take
such action and, after the Effective Time, on the part of the Initial
Surviving Company or the Final Surviving Company to cause such Subsidiary to
take such action.

9.10  _Severability_. The provisions of this Agreement shall be deemed
severable and the invalidity or unenforceability of any provision shall not
affect the validity or enforceability of the other provisions hereof. If any
provision of this Agreement, or the application thereof to any Person or any
circumstance, is invalid or unenforceable, (a) a suitable and equitable
provision negotiated in good faith by the parties hereto shall be substituted
therefor in order to carry out, so far as may be valid and enforceable, the
intent and purpose of such invalid or unenforceable provision and (b) the
remainder of this Agreement and the application of such provision to other
Persons or circumstances shall not, subject to clause (a) above, be affected
by such invalidity or unenforceability, except as a result of such
substitution, nor shall such invalidity or unenforceability affect the
validity or enforceability of such provision, or the application thereof, in
any other jurisdiction.

9.11 _Interpretation_. (a) The table of contents and the Article, Section and
paragraph headings or captions herein are for convenience of reference only,
do not constitute part of this Agreement and shall not be deemed to limit or
otherwise affect any of the provisions hereof. Where a reference in this
Agreement is made to a Section or Exhibit, such reference shall be to a
Section of or Exhibit to this Agreement unless otherwise indicated. Whenever
the words "include", "includes" or "including" are used in this Agreement,
they shall be deemed to be followed by the words "without limitation". The
words "hereof", "herein" and "hereunder" and words of similar import when used
in this Agreement shall refer to this Agreement as a whole and not to any
particular provision of this Agreement. The word "or" when used in this
Agreement is not exclusive. The word "extent" in the phrase "to the extent"
shall mean the degree to which a subject or other thing extends, and such
phrase shall not mean simply "if". All terms defined in this Agreement shall
have the defined meanings when used in any certificate or other document made
or delivered pursuant hereto unless otherwise defined therein. The 

 



-83-  definitions contained in this Agreement are applicable to the singular as
well as the plural forms of such terms and to the masculine as well as to the
feminine and neuter genders of such term. Any agreement, instrument or
statute defined or referred to herein or in any agreement or instrument that
is referred to herein means such agreement, instrument or statute as from time
to time amended, modified or supplemented, including (in the case of
agreements or instruments) by waiver or consent and (in the case of statutes)
by succession of comparable successor statutes and references to all
attachments thereto and instruments incorporated therein.

 

(b) The parties have participated jointly in negotiating and drafting this
Agreement. In the event that an ambiguity or a question of intent or
interpretation arises, this Agreement shall be construed as if drafted jointly
by the parties, and no presumption or burden of proof shall arise favoring or
disfavoring any party by virtue of the authorship of any provision of
this Agreement.

9.12 _Assignment_. This Agreement shall not be assignable by operation of law
or otherwise; _provided_ that Parent may designate, prior to the First
Effective Time, by written notice to the Company, another Subsidiary all of
the common equity of and voting interest in which are owned directly or
indirectly by Parent to be a party to the Initial Merger in lieu of Corporate
Sub, in which event all references herein to Corporate Sub shall be deemed
references to such other Subsidiary (except with respect to representations
and warranties made herein with respect to Corporate Sub as of the date of
this Agreement) and all representations and warranties made herein with
respect to Corporate Sub (other than the representations and warranties set
forth in Section 5.2(b)(ii)) as of the date of this Agreement shall also be
made with respect to such other Subsidiary as of the date of such
designation; _provided_ that such assignment shall not relieve Parent of its
obligations hereunder or otherwise enlarge, alter or change any obligation of
any other party hereto or due to Parent or such other Subsidiary; _provided_
_further_ that (unless each party agrees in its reasonable business discretion
that the Mergers would reasonably be expected to fail to qualify for the
Intended Tax Treatment without regard to such assignment) such assignment
shall not prevent or impede the Initial Merger, together with the Subsequent
Merger, from qualifying for the Intended Tax Treatment. Any assignment in
contravention of the preceding sentence shall be null and void.

 

9.13 _Specific Performance_. The parties hereto acknowledge and agree that
irreparable damage would occur and that the parties would not have any
adequate remedy at law if any provision of this Agreement were not performed
in accordance with its specific terms or were otherwise breached, and that
monetary damages, even if available, would not be an adequate remedy therefor.
It is accordingly agreed that the parties shall be entitled to an injunction
or injunctions to prevent breaches of this Agreement and to enforce
specifically the performance of the terms and provisions hereof in accordance
with Section 9.5 of this Agreement, without proof of actual damages (and each
party hereby waives any requirement for the security or posting of any bond in
connection with such remedy), this being in addition to any other remedy to
which they are entitled at law or in equity. The parties further agree not to
assert that a remedy of specific enforcement is unenforceable, invalid,
contrary to applicable Law or inequitable for any reason, and not to assert
that a remedy of monetary damages would provide an adequate remedy for any
such breach or that the Company or Parent otherwise have an adequate remedy at
law.
