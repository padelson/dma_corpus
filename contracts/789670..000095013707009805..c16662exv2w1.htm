 AGREEMENT AND PLAN OF MERGER, dated as of July 8, 2007 (this "Agreement"), among MARSHALL and ILSLEY CORPORATION, a Wisconsin corporation (the "Company"), FIC ACQUISITION CORPORATION, a Wisconsin corporation (the "Merger Sub"), and FIRST INDIANA CORPORATION, an Indiana corporation (the "Seller"). Capitalized terms used herein without definition are defined in the Sections of this Agreement specified in the index of defined terms attached hereto. 

  

 WHEREAS, the Boards of Directors of the Company (the "Companys Board of Directors"), the Merger Sub (the "Merger Subs Board of Directors") and the Seller (the "Sellers Board of Directors") have each determined that it is advisable to and in the best interests of their respective stockholders for the Merger Sub to merge with and into the Seller (the "Merger"), pursuant to which the Seller would become a wholly-owned subsidiary of the Company, upon the terms and subject to the conditions set forth herein and in accordance with the Indiana Business Corporation Law (the "IBCL") and the Wisconsin Business Corporation Law (the "WBCL"); 

  

 WHEREAS, the Companys Board of Directors, the Merger Subs Board of Directors and the Sellers Board of Directors have each approved the Merger, upon the terms and subject to the conditions set forth herein, and approved and adopted this Agreement; and 

  

 WHEREAS, subsequent to the Sellers approval of this Agreement and concurrently with the execution of this Agreement and as a condition and an inducement to the willingness of the Company and the Merger Sub to enter into this Agreement, the Company has entered into a Stockholder Voting Agreement pursuant to which each stockholder listed on Schedule I to such Stockholder Voting Agreement has agreed to vote the shares of the Seller Common Stock beneficially owned by such stockholder in favor of the Merger (the "Voting Agreement"). 

  

 NOW, THEREFORE, in consideration of the foregoing premises and the representations, warranties and agreements contained herein, and subject to the terms and conditions set forth herein, the parties hereto hereby agree as follows: 

  

ARTICLE I  THE MERGER

As a result of the Merger, the separate corporate existence of the Merger Sub shall cease and the Seller shall continue as the surviving corporation of the Merger (the "Surviving Corporation"). 

  

 1.2 _The Closing; Effective Time_. 

  

 (a) The closing of the Merger and the transactions contemplated hereby (the "Closing") shall be held at such time, date (the "Closing Date") and location as may be mutually

Closing may be deferred until the first Business Day of the calendar month
after the month in which the conditions set forth in clauses (i) and (ii),
above, have been satisfied. Scheduling or commencing the Closing shall not
constitute a waiver of the conditions set forth in Article VII by either the
Company or the Seller. 

  

 (b) Contemporaneously with the Closing, the parties hereto shall cause the Merger to be consummated by filing articles of merger, as necessary, and any other required documents, with the Secretary of State of the State of Indiana and the Department of Financial Institutions of the State of Wisconsin (the "WI DFI"), in such form as required by, and executed in accordance with the relevant provisions of, the IBCL and the WBCL (the effective date and time of such filing or such date and time as the Company and the Seller shall agree and specify in the articles of merger are referred to herein as the "Effective Time"). 

  

 1.3 _Effect of the Merger_. At the Effective Time, the effect of the Merger shall be as provided in this Agreement and the applicable provisions of the IBCL and the WBCL. Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, and subject thereto, at the Effective Time, except as otherwise provided herein, all of the property, rights, privileges, powers and franchises of the Seller and the Merger Sub shall vest in the Surviving Corporation, and all debts, liabilities and duties of the Seller and the Merger Sub shall become the debts, liabilities and duties of the Surviving Corporation. 

  

 1.4 _Articles of Incorporation; By-Laws_. At the Effective Time, the Sellers Articles of Incorporation and the Sellers By-Laws, each as amended or restated (the "Seller Articles" and the "Seller By-Laws," respectively), as in effect immediately prior to the Effective Time, shall be the Articles of Incorporation and the By-Laws of the Surviving Corporation. 

  

 1.5 _Directors and Officers_. At the Effective Time, the directors of the Merger Sub immediately prior to the Effective Time shall be the initial directors of the Surviving Corporation, each to hold office in accordance with the Articles of Incorporation and By-Laws of the Surviving Corporation. At the Effective Time, the officers of the Merger Sub immediately prior to the Effective Time shall be the initial officers of the Surviving Corporation, in each case until their respective successors are duly elected or appointed. 

  

 1.6 _Conversion of Securities_. 

  

 (a) At the Effective Time, by virtue of the Merger and without action on the part of the Company, the Merger Sub or the Seller, each share of the common stock, $0.01 par value, of the Seller together with the associated Preferred Share Purchase Right ("Seller Common Stock"), issued and outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time, other than (i) shares of Seller 

   ##### 

  

    

Common Stock held in the treasury of the Seller, and (ii) shares of Seller
Common Stock owned by the Company or any Company Subsidiary for its own
account, shall cease to be outstanding and shall be converted into the right
to receive an amount in cash equal to Thirty-Two and No/100 Dollars ($32.00),
without interest (the "Per Share Consideration"). For purposes hereof,
"Shares" shall mean all shares of Seller Common Stock issued and outstanding
other than those shares of Seller Common Stock described in clauses (i) and
(ii), above. 

  

 (b) Each share of Seller Common Stock held in the treasury of the Seller and each share held by the Company or any Company Subsidiary for its own account immediately prior to the Effective Time shall be canceled and extinguished without any conversion thereof as provided in this Section 1.6. 

  

 (c) Each share of common stock, par value $0.01 per share, of the Merger Sub ("Merger Sub Common Stock") issued and outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time shall be converted into and become one validly issued, fully paid and non-assessable share of common stock, par value $0.01 per share, of the Surviving Corporation. Following the Effective Time, each certificate evidencing ownership of shares of Merger Sub Common Stock shall evidence ownership of such shares of the Surviving Corporation. 

  

 1.7 _Exchange of Certificates_. 

  

 (a) _Exchange Agent_. The Company shall deposit, or shall cause to be deposited, from time to time, with the bank or trust company designated by the Company as the exchange agent (the "Exchange Agent"), for the benefit of the holders of Shares, for exchange in accordance with this Article I, through the Exchange Agent, the Per Share Consideration (the "Exchange Fund"). Such deposits shall be made after the Effective Time as requested by the Exchange Agent in order for the Exchange Agent to promptly deliver the Per Share Consideration. 

  

 (b) _Exchange Procedures_. As soon as reasonably practicable after the Effective Time but in any event no more than ten (10) Business Days thereafter, the Exchange Agent shall mail to each holder of record of a certificate representing ownership of Shares (a "Certificate" or "Certificates") whose Shares were converted into the right to receive the Per Share Consideration pursuant to Section 1.6, (i) a letter of transmittal (which shall specify that delivery shall be effected, and risk of loss and title to the Certificates shall pass, only upon delivery of the Certificates to the Exchange Agent and shall be in such form and have such other provisions as the Company may reasonably specify) and (ii) instructions for use in effecting the surrender of the Certificates in exchange for the Per Share Consideration. Upon surrender of a Certificate for cancellation to the Exchange Agent together with such letter of transmittal, duly executed, the holder of such Certificate shall be entitled to receive in exchange therefor the Per Share Consideration as provided in this Article I, which such holder has the right to receive in respect of the Certificate surrendered pursuant to the provisions of this Article I, and the Certificate so surrendered shall forthwith be canceled. In the event of a transfer of ownership of Shares which is not registered in the transfer records of the Seller, a transferee may exchange the Certificate representing such Shares for the Per Share Consideration as provided in this Article I if the Certificate representing such Shares is presented to the Exchange Agent, accompanied by all documents required to evidence and effect such transfer, and by evidence that any applicable 

   ##### 

  

    

stock transfer taxes have been paid. In the event any Certificate shall have
been lost, stolen or destroyed, upon the making of an affidavit of that fact
by the Person claiming such Certificate to be lost, stolen or destroyed and
the posting by such Person of a bond in such amount as the Company may direct
as indemnity against any claim that may be made against it or the Exchange
Agent with respect to such Certificate, the Exchange Agent will pay in
exchange for such lost, stolen or destroyed Certificate the Per Share
Consideration as provided in this Article I, which such holder would have had
the right to receive in respect of such lost, stolen or destroyed
Certificate. Until surrendered as contemplated by this Section 1.7, each
Certificate (other than Certificates representing shares of Seller Common
Stock described in clauses (i) and (ii) of Section 1.6(a), above) shall be
deemed at any time after the Effective Time to represent only the right to
receive upon such surrender the Per Share Consideration, without interest, as
provided in this Article I. 

  

 (c) _No Further Rights in the Shares_. The Per Share Consideration paid upon conversion of the Shares in accordance with the terms hereof shall be deemed to have been paid in full satisfaction of all rights pertaining to such Shares. 

  

 (d) _Termination of Exchange Fund_. Any portion of the Exchange Fund which remains undistributed to the former stockholders of the Seller for six (6) months after the Effective Time shall be delivered to the Company, upon demand, and any former stockholders of the Seller who have not theretofore complied with this Article I shall thereafter look only to the Company to claim the Per Share Consideration, without interest thereon, and subject to Section 1.7(f). Any portion of the Exchange Fund remaining unclaimed by holders of Shares as of a date which is immediately prior to such time as such amounts would otherwise escheat to or become property of any United States federal, state or local or any foreign government, or political subdivision thereof, or any multinational organization or authority or any authority, agency or commission entitled to exercise any administrative, executive, judicial, legislative, police, regulatory (including, without limitation, any Regulatory Authority) or taxing authority or power, any court or tribunal (or any department, bureau or division thereof), or any arbitrator or arbitral body (each a "Governmental Authority"), shall, to the extent permitted by applicable Law, become the property of the Surviving Corporation free and clear of any claims or interest of any Person previously entitled thereto. 

  

 (e) _No Liability_. None of the Company, the Merger Sub, the Surviving Corporation or the Seller shall be liable to any former holder of Shares for any such Shares (or dividends or distributions with respect thereto) or cash or other payment delivered to a Governmental Authority pursuant to any abandoned property, escheat or similar Laws. 

  

 (f) _Withholding Rights_. Each of the Company, the Surviving Corporation and the Exchange Agent shall be entitled to deduct and withhold from the consideration otherwise payable pursuant to this Agreement to any former holder of Shares such amounts as it is required to deduct and withhold with respect to the making of such payment under any Laws relating to Taxes and pay such withholding amount over to the appropriate Governmental Authority. To the extent that amounts are so withheld by the Company, the Surviving Corporation or the Exchange Agent, such withheld amounts shall be treated for all purposes of this Agreement as having been paid to the former holder of the Shares in respect of which such deduction and withholding was made by the Company, the Surviving Corporation or the Exchange Agent, as the case may be. 

   ##### 

  

  

 1.8 _Stock Transfer Books_. On the business day immediately preceding the Effective Time, the stock transfer books of the Seller shall be closed and there shall be no further registration of transfers of shares of the Seller Common Stock thereafter on the records of the Seller. From and after the Effective Time, the holders of Certificates outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time shall cease to have any rights with respect to such Shares except as otherwise provided herein or by Law. On or after the Effective Time, any Certificates presented to the Exchange Agent or the Company for any reason shall be converted into the Per Share Consideration in accordance with this Article I. 

  

 1.9 _Stock Options_. Each Option which is outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time, whether or not exercisable, shall be canceled, effective as of the Effective Time, in exchange for a single lump-sum cash payment from the Surviving Corporation (less any applicable income or employment Tax withholding) equal to the product of (i) the number of shares of Seller Common Stock subject to such Option immediately prior to the Effective Time and (ii) the excess, if any, of the Per Share Consideration over the exercise price per share of such Option (the "Option Consideration"); _provided_ , that if the exercise price per share of any such Option is equal to or greater than the Per Share Consideration, such Option shall be canceled without any cash payment being made in respect thereof. Prior to the Closing, the Seller, in consultation with the Company, shall take or cause to be taken any and all actions reasonably necessary, including amendment of the Option Plans, and shall use its reasonable best efforts to obtain any necessary consent of each holder of an Option, (i) to give effect to the treatment of Options pursuant to this Section 1.9, to the extent such treatment is not expressly provided for by the terms of the applicable Option Plans and related award agreements, and (ii) to cause the actions contemplated by this Section 1.9 to be in compliance with applicable Law, including Section 409A, if applicable. The Company shall pay the Option Consideration promptly after the Effective Time and shall use its reasonable best efforts to mail or deliver checks in an amount equal to the Option Consideration to the Option holders entitled thereto on the Closing Date.

 2.1 _Organization and Qualification; Subsidiaries_.

The Seller is subject to regulation by the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System (the "Federal Reserve Board"). The Seller is a financial holding company under the Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act of 1999 and the regulations promulgated thereunder, as amended (the "GLB Act").

   #####

of the Seller and the Seller Subsidiaries has the requisite power and
authority to own, lease and operate the properties it now owns or holds under
lease and to carry on its business as it is now being conducted, is duly
qualified or licensed as a foreign business entity to do business, and is in
good standing, in each jurisdiction where the character of the properties
owned, leased or operated by it or the nature of its business makes such
qualification or licensing necessary, except for such jurisdictions in which
the failure to be so qualified or licensed would not have a Seller Material
Adverse Effect. 

  

 (b) Each of the Seller and the Seller Subsidiaries has all Consents and Orders ("Seller Approvals") necessary to own, lease and operate its properties and to carry on its business as it is now being conducted, including all required authorizations from the Federal Reserve Board, the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (the "FDIC"), and the Office of Comptroller of the Currency (the "OCC"), and neither the Seller nor any Seller Subsidiary has received any notice of any Proceedings relating to the revocation or modification of any Seller Approvals. 

  

 (c) A true and complete list of the Seller Subsidiaries, together with (i) the Sellers percentage ownership of each Seller Subsidiary and (ii) Laws under which the Seller Subsidiary is incorporated or organized, is set forth in the Seller Disclosure Schedule. The Seller or one or more of the Seller Subsidiaries owns beneficially and of record all of the outstanding shares of capital stock and/or other equity interests, as the case may be ("Subsidiary Securities"), of each of the Seller Subsidiaries. Except for the Seller Subsidiaries, the Seller does not directly or indirectly own any capital stock or equity interest in, or any interests convertible into or exchangeable or exercisable for any capital stock or equity interest in, any corporation, partnership, joint venture or other business association or other Person, other than in the ordinary course of business and in no event in excess of five percent (5%) of the outstanding equity securities of such Person. 

  

 (d) As used in this Agreement, the term "Seller Material Adverse Effect" means any effect, change, event, fact, condition, occurrence or development (each an "Effect") that, individually or in the aggregate with other Effects, (i) is material and adverse to the business, assets, liabilities, results of operations or financial condition of the Seller and the Seller Subsidiaries taken as a whole, and/or (ii) materially impairs the ability of the Seller to consummate the transactions contemplated hereby; _provided_ , _however_ , that the term "Seller Material Adverse Effect" shall not be deemed to include the impact of: (a) any Effect to the extent resulting from the announcement of this Agreement or the transactions contemplated hereby; (b) any action taken or not taken by the Seller or the Seller Subsidiaries in accordance with the terms and covenants contained in this Agreement; (c) any changes in Laws or interpretations thereof that are generally applicable to the banking industry; (d) changes in GAAP that are generally applicable to the banking industry; (e) expenses reasonably incurred in connection with the transactions contemplated hereby; (f) changes attributable to or resulting from changes in general economic conditions affecting the banking industry generally, including, without limitation, changes in interest rates and loan delinquency rates (unless such Effect would reasonably be expected to have a materially disproportionate impact on the business, assets, liabilities, results of operations or financial condition of the Seller and the Seller Subsidiaries taken as a whole relative to other banking industry participants); or (g) the payment of any 

   ##### 

  

    

amounts due to, or the provision of any other benefits to, any officers or
employees under employment Contracts, non-competition agreements, employee
benefit plans, severance agreements or other arrangements in existence as of
the date of or contemplated by this Agreement, in each case only if disclosed
in Section 2.1(d) of the Seller Disclosure Schedule, provided that the payment
of any such amounts or the provision of any such benefits shall be made in
the ordinary course consistent with past practices or paid in accordance with
such Contracts, agreements, plans or arrangements. 

  

 (e) The minute books of the Seller and each of the Seller Subsidiaries contain complete and correct records of all material matters approved at all meetings of, and all corporate actions taken by, their respective stockholders and Boards of Directors (including committees of their respective Boards of Directors). 

  

 2.2 _Articles of Incorporation and By-Laws_. The Seller has heretofore furnished or made available to the Company a complete and correct copy of the Seller Articles and the Seller By-Laws and the Articles of Incorporation and the By-Laws, or other organizational documents, as the case may be, of each Seller Subsidiary, each as amended or restated (the "Subsidiary Organizational Documents"). The Seller Articles, the Seller By-Laws and the Subsidiary Organizational Documents are in full force and effect. Neither the Seller nor any Seller Subsidiary is in breach of any of the provisions of the Seller Articles, the Seller By-Laws or the Subsidiary Organizational Documents. 

  

 2.3 _Capitalization_. The authorized capital stock of the Seller consists of 33,000,000 shares of Seller Common Stock and 2,000,000 shares of preferred stock, par value $.01 per share, none of which shares of preferred stock are outstanding as of the date of this Agreement. As of July 6, 2007, (i) 16,525,072 shares of Seller Common Stock are issued and outstanding, all of which are duly authorized, validly issued, fully paid and non-assessable, and not issued in violation of any preemptive right of any Seller stockholder, (ii) 4,075,646 shares of Seller Common Stock are held in the treasury of the Seller, (iii) 643,776 shares of Seller Common Stock are subject to outstanding options to acquire shares of Seller Common Stock (the "Options"), issued pursuant to the Sellers stock option plans disclosed in Section 2.3 of the Seller Disclosure Schedule (the "Option Plans"), (iv) Preferred Share Purchase Rights have been issued to holders of the Seller Common Stock, and (v) no undesignated shares are outstanding.

Each Option (a) was granted in compliance with all applicable Laws and all of the terms and conditions of the Option Plan pursuant to which it was issued, (b) has an exercise price per share of Seller Common Stock equal to or greater than the fair market value of such share at the close of business on the date of such grant, (c) has a grant date identical to the date on which the Sellers Board of Directors or any committee thereof actually awarded such Option, and (d) 

   ##### 

  

    

qualifies for the tax and accounting treatment afforded to such Option as
reflected in the Sellers Tax Returns and the Sellers financial statements.
Section 2.3 of the Seller Disclosure Schedule contains a complete and correct
description of all Options which do not fully vest upon consummation of the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement, including the Merger. Section
2.3 of the Seller Disclosure Schedule sets forth all dividends and other
distributions, if any, allocated to the shares of Seller Common Stock covered
by the Options but unpaid as of the date hereof. There are no obligations,
contingent or otherwise, of the Seller or any Seller Subsidiary to
repurchase, redeem or otherwise acquire any shares of Seller Common Stock or
Subsidiary Securities, as the case may be, or to provide funds to or make any
investment (in the form of a loan, capital contribution or otherwise) in any
Seller Subsidiary or any other Person, except for loan commitments and other
funding obligations entered into in the ordinary course of business. Except
as set forth in Section 2.3 of the Seller Disclosure Schedule, neither the
Seller nor any Seller Subsidiary has repurchased, redeemed or otherwise
acquired any of its shares of capital stock and/or other equity interests
since December 31, 2006. Each of the Subsidiary Securities is duly
authorized, validly issued, fully paid and non-assessable, and not issued in
violation of any preemptive rights of any Seller Subsidiary stockholder or
other equity holder, and such shares owned by the Seller or a Seller
Subsidiary, as the case may be, are owned free and clear of all voting rights
and Liens whatsoever. All outstanding shares of Seller Common Stock and
Subsidiary Securities were issued in compliance with all applicable Laws. 

  

 2.4 _Authority_. The Seller has the requisite corporate power and authority to execute and deliver this Agreement, to perform its obligations hereunder and to consummate the transactions contemplated hereby (other than, with respect to the Merger, the approval and adoption of this Agreement by the Sellers stockholders in accordance with the IBCL, the Seller Articles and the Seller By-Laws). The execution and delivery of this Agreement by the Seller and the consummation by the Seller of the transactions contemplated hereby have been duly and validly authorized by all necessary corporate action on the part of the Seller, including, without limitation, the Sellers Board of Directors (other than, with respect to the Merger, the approval and adoption of this Agreement by the Sellers stockholders in accordance with the IBCL, the Seller Articles and the Seller By-Laws).

No other corporate proceedings on the part of the Seller are necessary to authorize this Agreement or to consummate the transactions contemplated hereby (other than, with respect to the Merger, the approval and adoption of this Agreement by the Sellers stockholders in accordance with the IBCL, the Seller Articles and the Seller By-Laws). This Agreement has been duly and validly executed and delivered by, and constitutes a valid and binding obligation of, the Seller and, assuming due authorization, execution and delivery by the Company, is enforceable against the Seller in accordance with its terms, except as enforcement may be limited by Laws affecting

Sections 23-1-42 and 23-1-43 of the IBCL are inapplicable to the execution, delivery or performance of this Agreement and the Voting Agreement and the transactions contemplated hereby and thereby, including the Merger. Except for Sections 23-1-42 and 23-1-43 of the IBCL, no other "business combination," "control share acquisition," "fair price" or other anti-takeover laws or regulations enacted under Indiana state law apply or purport to apply to the execution, delivery or performance of this Agreement or the Voting Agreement or any of the transactions contemplated hereby or thereby, including the Merger. 

  

 (b) The execution and delivery of this Agreement by the Seller do not, and the performance of this Agreement and the consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby by the Seller will not, require any Consent from, or filing with or notification to, any Governmental Authority, except for applicable requirements, if any, of the Securities Act of 1933 and the regulations promulgated thereunder, as amended (the "Securities Act"), the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and the regulations promulgated thereunder, as amended (the "Exchange Act"), state securities or blue sky laws and the regulations promulgated thereunder, each as amended ("Blue Sky Laws"), the BHCA, the banking laws of the State of Indiana and the regulations promulgated thereunder, as amended, the filing and recordation of appropriate merger or other documents as required by the IBCL and the WBCL, and prior notification filings with the Department of Justice under the Hart-Scott-Rodino Antitrust Improvements Act of 1976 and the regulations promulgated thereunder, as amended (the "HSR Act").

   ##### 

  

  

 2.7 _Securities and Banking Reports; Financial Statements_. 

  

 (a) The Seller and each Seller Subsidiary have filed all forms, reports and documents required to be filed with (x) the Securities and Exchange Commission ("SEC") since December 31, 2004, and, as of the date of this Agreement, has delivered or made available to the Company (i) its Annual Reports on Form 10-K for the fiscal years ended December 31, 2004, 2005 and 2006, respectively, (ii) all proxy statements relating to the Sellers meetings of stockholders (whether annual or special) held since December 31, 2004, (iii) all Quarterly Reports on Form 10-Q filed by the Seller with the SEC since December 31, 2004, (iv) all Reports on Form 8-K filed by the Seller with the SEC since December 31, 2004, (v) all other reports or registration statements filed by the Seller with the SEC since December 31, 2004, and (vi) all amendments and supplements to all such reports and registration statements filed by the Seller with the SEC since December 31, 2004 (collectively, the "Seller SEC Reports") and (y) the Federal Reserve Board, the FDIC, the OCC and any other applicable federal or state securities or banking authorities (all such reports and statements are collectively referred to as the "Seller Reports"). The Seller Reports, including all Seller Reports filed after the date of this Agreement, (i) were or will be prepared in accordance with the requirements of applicable Law and (ii) did not at the time they were filed, or will not at the time they are filed, contain any untrue statement of a material fact or omit to state a material fact required to be stated therein or necessary in order to make the statements therein, in the light of the circumstances under which they were made, not misleading. The parties agree that failure of the Sellers Chief Executive Officer or Chief Financial Officer to provide any certification required to be filed with any document filed with the SEC shall constitute an event that has a Seller Material Adverse Effect. 

  

 (b) Each of the consolidated financial statements (including, in each case, any related notes thereto) contained in the Seller SEC Reports, including any Seller SEC Reports filed after the date of this Agreement and prior to or on the Effective Time, have been or will be prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles ("GAAP") applied on a consistent basis throughout the periods involved (except as may be indicated in the notes thereto or required by reason of a concurrent change to GAAP) and each fairly presents in all material respects the consolidated financial position of the Seller and the Seller Subsidiaries as of the respective dates thereof and the consolidated results of its operations and cash flows and changes in financial position for the periods indicated, except that any unaudited interim financial statements do not contain the footnotes required by GAAP and were or are subject to normal and recurring year-end adjustments, which were not or are not expected to be material in amount, either individually or in the aggregate. The Seller has not had any dispute with any of its auditors regarding accounting matters or policies during any of its past three (3) full fiscal years or during the current fiscal year-to-date requiring disclosure pursuant to Item 304 of Regulation S-K promulgated by the SEC. 

  

 (c) The Seller has made available to the Company a complete and correct copy of any amendments or modifications which are required to be filed with the SEC, but have not yet been filed with the SEC, to (i) the Seller SEC Reports filed prior to the date hereof, and (ii) Contracts which previously have been filed by the Seller with the SEC pursuant to the Securities Act and Exchange Act (together with the Seller SEC Reports, the "Seller SEC Documents"). The Seller has timely responded to all comment letters and other correspondence of the staff of the SEC relating to the Seller SEC Documents, and the SEC has not advised the Seller that any final 

   ##### 

  

    

responses are inadequate, insufficient or otherwise non-responsive. The
Seller has made available to the Company complete and correct copies of all
correspondence between the SEC, on the one hand, and the Seller and any of
the Seller Subsidiaries, on the other hand, occurring since December 31, 2004
and prior to the date hereof and will, reasonably promptly following the
receipt thereof, make available to the Company any such correspondence sent
or received after the date hereof. To the Sellers Knowledge, none of the
Seller SEC Documents is the subject of ongoing SEC review or outstanding
SEC comment. 

  

 (d) The Seller and, to the Sellers Knowledge, each of its officers and directors, are in compliance with and have complied in all material respects with (A) the applicable provisions of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 and the rules and regulations promulgated thereunder, as amended ("Sarbanes-Oxley"), including, without limitation, Section 404 thereof and (B) the applicable listing and corporate governance rules and regulations of the NASDAQ Stock Market LLC. With respect to each Report on Form 10-K and Form 10-Q and each amendment of any such report filed by the Seller with the SEC since December 31, 2004, the Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer of the Seller have made all certifications required by Sections 302 and 906 of Sarbanes-Oxley at the time of such filing, and the statements contained in each such certification were true and correct. Further, the Seller has established and maintains "disclosure controls and procedures" (as defined in Rule 13a-15(e) promulgated under the Exchange Act) that are reasonably designed to ensure that material information (both financial and non-financial) relating to the Seller and the Seller Subsidiaries required to be disclosed by the Seller in the reports that it files or submits under the Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in the rules and forms of the SEC, and that such information is accumulated and communicated to the Sellers principal executive officer and principal financial officer, or persons performing similar functions, as appropriate to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure and to make the certifications of the principal executive officer and the principal financial officer of the Seller required by Section 302 of Sarbanes-Oxley with respect to such reports. For purposes of this Agreement, "principal executive officer" and "principal financial officer" shall have the meanings given to such terms in Sarbanes-Oxley. 

  

 (e) The Seller has established and maintains a system of internal control over financial reporting (as defined in Rule 13a-15(f) promulgated under the Exchange Act) ("internal controls"). To the Sellers Knowledge, based on its evaluation of internal controls prior to the date hereof, such internal controls are sufficient to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of the Sellers financial reporting and the preparation of the Sellers financial statements for external purposes in accordance with GAAP. The Seller has disclosed, based on its most recent evaluation of internal controls prior to the date hereof, to the Sellers auditors and audit committee (i) any significant deficiencies and material weaknesses known to the Seller in the design or operation of internal controls which are reasonably likely to adversely affect in a material respect the Sellers ability to record, process, summarize and report financial information and (ii) any material fraud known to the Seller that involves management or other employees who have a significant role in internal controls. The Seller has made available to the Company a summary of any such disclosure regarding material weaknesses and fraud made by management to the Sellers auditors and audit committee since December 31, 2004. For purposes of this Agreement, a "significant deficiency" in controls means an internal control deficiency that adversely affects an entitys ability to initiate, authorize, record, process, or report 

   ##### 

  

    

external financial data reliably in accordance with GAAP. A "significant
deficiency" may be a single deficiency or a combination of deficiencies that
results in more than a remote likelihood that a misstatement of the annual or
interim financial statements that is more than inconsequential will not be
prevented or detected. For purposes of this Agreement, a "material weakness"
in internal controls means a significant deficiency, or a combination of
significant deficiencies, that results in more than a remote likelihood that
a material misstatement of the annual or interim financial statements will
not be prevented or detected. 

  

 (f) There are no outstanding loans made by the Seller or any Seller Subsidiary to any executive officer (as defined in Rule 3b-7 promulgated under the Exchange Act) or director of the Seller, other than loans that are subject to and that were made and continue to be in compliance with Regulation O under the Federal Reserve Act. 

  

 (g) Except (i) for those liabilities that are fully reflected or reserved against on the consolidated balance sheet of the Seller included in the Sellers Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for the period ended March 31, 2007, and (ii) for liabilities incurred in the ordinary course of business consistent with past practice since March 31, 2007, neither the Seller nor any Seller Subsidiary has incurred any liability of any nature whatsoever (whether absolute, accrued, contingent or otherwise and whether due or to become due) that is required to be disclosed on a balance sheet prepared in accordance with GAAP that has had, or would reasonably be expected to have, a Seller Material Adverse Effect. 

  

 (h) The Seller has not been notified by its independent registered public accounting firm or by the staff of the SEC that such accounting firm or the staff of the SEC, as the case may be, are of the view that any financial statement included in any registration statement filed by the Seller under the Securities Act or any periodic or current report filed by the Seller under the Exchange Act should be restated, or that the Seller should modify its accounting in future periods in a manner that would have, or would be reasonably expected to have, a Seller Material Adverse Effect. 

  

 (i) Since December 31, 2006, none of the Seller, the Seller Subsidiaries, any executive officer of the Seller or, to the Sellers Knowledge, any auditor, accountant or representative of the Seller or the Seller Subsidiaries, has received or otherwise had or obtained knowledge of any complaint, allegation, assertion or claim, whether written or oral, regarding the accounting or auditing practices, procedures, methodologies or methods of the Seller or the Seller Subsidiaries or their respective internal accounting controls, including any complaint, allegation, assertion or claim that the Seller or any Seller Subsidiary has engaged in questionable accounting or auditing practices. To the Sellers Knowledge, no attorney representing the Seller or the Seller Subsidiaries, whether or not employed by the Seller or the Seller Subsidiaries, has reported evidence of a material violation of securities laws, breach of fiduciary duty or similar violation by the Seller, any Seller Subsidiary or any of their officers, directors, employees or agents to the Sellers or any Seller Subsidiarys Board of Directors or any committee thereof or to any director or officer of the Seller or any Seller Subsidiary. Since December 31, 2006, there have been no internal investigations regarding accounting or revenue recognition discussed with, reviewed by or initiated at the direction of the Chief Executive Officer, Chief Financial Officer, individuals performing similar functions, general counsel, the Sellers or any Seller Subsidiarys Board of Directors or any committee thereof.

appropriateness of issuing or requesting) any such Order, agreement,
memorandum of understanding or extraordinary supervisory letter or any such
board resolutions, nor, to the Sellers Knowledge, has any
Governmental Authority commenced an investigation in connection therewith. 

  

 (d) The Seller is not aware of, has not been advised of, and has no reason to believe in the existence of, any facts or circumstances which would cause it or any of the Seller Subsidiaries to be deemed to be (i) operating in violation of The Currency and Foreign Transactions Reporting Act and the regulations promulgated thereunder, as amended (the "Bank Secrecy Act"), the USA Patriot Act of 2001 and the regulations promulgated thereunder, as amended (the "Patriot Act"), the laws and regulations promulgated and administered by the Office of Foreign Asset Control ("OFAC"), any Order issued with respect to anti-money laundering by the United States Department of Justice or the United States Department of Treasurys Financial Crimes Enforcement Network ("FinCEN"), any Order issued by OFAC, or any other applicable anti-money laundering Laws; or (ii) not in satisfactory compliance with the applicable privacy and customer information requirements contained in any privacy, data protection or security breach notification Laws, including, without limitation, Title V of the GLB Act and the provisions of the information security program adopted pursuant to 12 C.F.R Part 40\.

been withdrawn as of the time of such action of the Sellers Board of
Directors and the Sellers Board of Directors shall have reasonably
determined in good faith, after taking into consideration the advice of
and consultation with an investment banking firm of national reputation
(which includes the Sellers current financial advisor), that such
Acquisition Proposal constitutes or is reasonably likely to result in a
Superior Offer. 

  

 (d) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this Section 4.3, in the event that the Sellers Board of Directors determines in good faith, after consultation with outside counsel, that in light of a Superior Offer it is necessary to do so in order to comply with its fiduciary duties to the Seller or the Sellers stockholders under applicable Law, the Sellers Board of Directors may terminate this Agreement in the manner contemplated by Section 8.1(h) solely in order to concurrently enter into a definitive agreement with respect to a Superior Offer, but only after the tenth (10th) day following the Companys receipt of written notice advising the Company that the Sellers Board of Directors is prepared to accept a Superior Offer, and only if, during such ten (10) day period, if the Company so elects, the Seller and its advisors shall have negotiated in good faith with the Company to make such adjustments in the terms and conditions of this Agreement as would enable the Seller to proceed with the transactions contemplated herein on such adjusted terms.

officers of the Seller covered by the Existing DandO Policy harmless against
any and all losses, claims, damages, liabilities, costs and expenses
(including, but not limited to, attorneys fees, disbursements and court
costs) and actions with respect to acts, omissions, and other

years from and after the Effective Time.

 6.6 _Notification of Certain Matters_. The Seller shall give prompt notice to the Company, and the Company shall give prompt notice to the Seller, of (i) the occurrence, or non-occurrence, of any event the occurrence or non-occurrence of which would be likely to cause any representation or warranty of the Seller, the Company or the Merger Sub, as the case may be, contained in this Agreement to be untrue or inaccurate, and (ii) any failure of the Seller, the Company or the Merger Sub, as the case may be, to comply with or satisfy any covenant, condition or agreement to be complied with or satisfied by it hereunder; _provided_ , _however_ , that the delivery of any notice pursuant to this Section 6.6 shall not limit or otherwise affect the remedies available hereunder to the party receiving such notice. 

  

 6.7 _Public Announcements_. The Company and the Seller shall consult with each other before issuing any press release or otherwise making any public statements with respect to the Merger and shall not issue any such press release or make any such public statement prior to such consultation, except as may be required by Law, including disclosures required under the federal securities laws.

 9.4 _Headings_. The headings contained in this Agreement are for reference purposes only and shall not affect in any way the meaning or interpretation of this Agreement. 

  

 9.5 _Severability_. If any term or other provision of this Agreement is invalid, illegal or incapable of being enforced by any rule of Law or public policy, all other conditions and provisions of this Agreement shall nevertheless remain in full force and effect so long as the economic or legal substance of the transactions contemplated hereby is not affected in any manner adverse to either party. Upon such determination that any term or other provision is invalid, illegal or incapable of being enforced, the parties hereto shall negotiate in good faith to modify this Agreement so as to effect the original intent of the parties as closely as possible in an acceptable manner to the end that transactions contemplated hereby are fulfilled to the extent possible. 

  

 9.6 _Entire Agreement_. This Agreement (including the documents and instruments referred to in this Agreement) constitute the entire agreement of the parties and supersede all prior agreements and understandings, both written and oral, between the parties with respect to 

   ##### 

  

    

the subject matter hereof and, except as set forth in Section 9.9, below, are
not intended to confer upon any other Person any rights or remedies
hereunder. 

  

 9.7 _Assignment_. This Agreement shall not be assigned by operation of Law or otherwise, except that the Company may assign all or any of its rights hereunder and thereunder to any Affiliate, provided that no such assignment shall relieve the Company of its obligations hereunder. 

  

 9.8 _Binding Effect_. This Agreement shall be binding upon and inure to the benefit of the parties hereto and their respective successors and permitted assigns. Without limiting the general applicability of the foregoing, the Seller acknowledges receiving a copy or having access to the Companys Current Report filed on Form 8-K on April 4, 2007, relating to the Companys sponsored-spin transaction involving Warburg Pincus LLC and Metavante Corporation, pursuant to which, among other things, the Company will be converted (the "Conversion") into a Wisconsin limited liability company ("MandI LLC"). The Seller further acknowledges that MandI LLC shall succeed to the Companys rights and obligations under this Agreement as a result of the Conversion without any action by the parties. 

  

 9.9 _Parties in Interest_. Subject to Section 9.7, above, this Agreement (including  _Annex A_ attached hereto) shall be binding upon and inure solely to the benefit of each party hereto, and nothing in this Agreement, express or implied, is intended to or shall confer upon any other Person any right, benefit or remedy of any nature whatsoever under or by reason of this Agreement, other than Sections 6.4 and 6.5, above (which are intended to be for the benefit of and may be enforced by the employees of the Seller and the Seller Subsidiaries and the Indemnified Parties). 

  

 9.10 _Governing Law_. Except to the extent that the laws of the State of Indiana are mandatorily applicable to the matters arising under or in connection with this Agreement, this Agreement shall be governed by, and construed in accordance with, the laws of the State of Wisconsin, regardless of the Laws that might otherwise govern under applicable principles of choice of law or conflicts of law. 

  

 9.11 _Counterparts._ This Agreement may be executed in two or more counterparts, all of which shall be considered one and the same agreement and shall become effective when counterparts have been signed by each of the parties and delivered to the other party, it being understood that each party need not sign the same counterpart. 

  

 9.12 _Time is of the Essence_. Time is of the essence as to all performance under this Agreement. 

  

 9.13 _Specific Performance_. The parties hereto acknowledge that monetary damages would not be a sufficient remedy for breach of this Agreement. Therefore, upon breach of this Agreement by either party, the aggrieved party may proceed to protect its rights and enforce this Agreement by suit in equity, action at law or other appropriate Proceeding, including an action for the specific performance of any provision herein or any other remedy granted by Law, equity or otherwise, in each case without posting a bond. Any action for specific performance hereunder shall not be deemed exclusive and may also include claims for monetary damages as 

   ##### 

  

    

may be warranted under the circumstances. The prevailing party in any such
suit, action or other Proceeding arising out of or related to this Agreement
shall be entitled to recover its costs, including attorneys fees, incurred
in such suit, action or other Proceeding. The sole and exclusive venue for
any action arising out of this Agreement shall be a state or federal
court having jurisdiction in Milwaukee County, Wisconsin. Each party hereby
waives, to the fullest extent permitted by law: (i) any objections that it
may now or hereafter have to venue of any suit, action or other Proceeding
brought in such court; (ii) any claim that any suit, action or other
Proceeding brought in such court has been brought in an inconvenient forum;
and (iii) any defense it may now or hereafter have based on lack of personal
jurisdiction in such forum. 

  

 9.14 _Interpretation_. When a reference is made in this Agreement to Articles, Sections, Annexes or Schedules, such reference will be to an Article or Section of or Annex or Schedule to this Agreement unless otherwise indicated. The table of contents contained in this Agreement is for reference purposes only and will not affect in any way the meaning or interpretation of this Agreement. Whenever the words "include," "includes" or "including" are used in this Agreement, they will be deemed to be followed by the words "without limitation." Unless the context otherwise requires (i) "or" is disjunctive but not necessarily exclusive, (ii) words in the singular include the plural and vice versa, (iii) the use in this Agreement of a pronoun in reference to a party hereto includes the masculine, feminine or neuter, as the context may require, and (iv) terms used herein that are defined in GAAP have the meanings ascribed to them therein. No provision of this Agreement will be interpreted in favor of, or against, either of the parties to this Agreement by reason of the extent to which either such party or its counsel participated in the drafting thereof or by reason of the extent to which any such provision is inconsistent with any prior draft hereof, and no rule of strict construction will be applied against either party hereto. The Seller Disclosure Schedule and the Company Disclosure Schedule, as well as all other Schedules and all Annexes hereto, will be deemed part of this Agreement and included in any reference to this Agreement. All of the representations and warranties of the Seller are qualified by and subject to the Seller Disclosure Schedule and the Seller SEC Reports even if not expressly referenced in a section of Article II. This Agreement will not be interpreted or construed to require either party to take any action, or fail to take any action, if to do so would violate any applicable Law. References to the "other parties" will be deemed to refer to the Seller, the Company or the Merger Sub, as the case may be.

 _ANNEX A_  

   

EMPLOYEE BENEFIT MATTERS  

 

1\. _Conduct of Business Between Date of Signing the Agreement and the
Effective Time_ _._  Between the date of signing of the Agreement and the
Effective Time, unless otherwise agreed between Seller and the Company (i)
Seller or Seller Subsidiaries will not increase the base salaries of their
respective employees except on such employees annual review date or except
to the extent necessary for limited specific individuals to account for
market adjustments, provided however such increases shall be in the ordinary
course of business in accordance with past practices, shall not exceed in the
aggregate 4% on an annualized basis for those employees without employment
agreements and there shall be no increases for employees with employment
agreements; (ii) no bonuses or incentive payments will be paid to employees
of Seller or Seller Subsidiaries except consistent with existing bonus or
incentive programs and in the ordinary course of business in accordance with
past practices; (iii) no new programs, plans or agreements
providing compensation or benefits for employees or directors of Seller or
Seller Subsidiaries will be adopted or implemented, existing programs, plans
or agreements providing compensation or benefits for employees or directors
of Seller or Seller Subsidiaries will not be amended or modified except as
required by, or necessary to comply with, applicable law, including to comply
with Section 409A of the Internal Revenue Code, or as provided herein or in
agreements executed by employees in connection herewith, and no further
grants or awards will be made under existing plans, programs or agreements
providing compensation or benefits for employees or directors of Seller or
Seller Subsidiaries, except as provided herein; (iv) there will be no officer
title promotions, except that if an officer position becomes vacant, another
officer may be promoted to that position if he or she assumes the former
employees job responsibilities; (v) no new consulting agreements
or employment continuation agreements, if any, will be granted to employees
of Seller or Seller Subsidiaries and the existing consulting and employment
continuation agreements of Seller and Seller Subsidiaries will not be
amended, except as provided herein or in the Consulting Agreements executed
simultaneously herewith; (vi) in no event will Seller make employer
contributions to its retirement programs except to the extent consistent with
past practice, and Seller will not make any amendments or modifications to
its retirement programs, other than as provided herein or required to
maintain the tax-qualified status of any such retirement programs; and (vii)
Seller or Seller Subsidiaries will only pay severance to those employees who
are terminated by their employer and then only in amounts and for a period
consistent with past practice of the employer, or as provided in the
employees employment agreement, if any. The Company agrees that it will
not knowingly amend or unreasonably omit to take any action with respect to
any existing arrangement in a manner that would result in additional employee
tax under Section 409A of the Internal Revenue Code. 

  

2\. _General_. 

    

(a) _Transferred Employees_. Those individuals who are employed by the Seller
or any of the Seller Subsidiaries as of the Effective Time shall be
hereinafter referred to as the "Transferred Employees." After the Effective
Time, the Transferred Employees shall be integrated into the Companys
qualified retirement plans, health and dental plans and other employee
welfare benefit plans subject to the terms and conditions of the 

   ##### 

  

    

referenced plans, except as otherwise provided in the Agreement and this
Annex A. If the Company terminates a Transferred Employees employment with
the Company within the first twelve months after the Effective Time, the
amount of severance to which such Transferred Employee would be entitled is
as set forth in the Companys Reduction-In-Force Severance policy provided to
the Seller. Thereafter, if the Company terminates a Transferred
Employees employment, the amount of severance to which such Transferred
Employee may be entitled will be as set forth in the Companys severance
plans as then in effect, and Transferred Employees will be given full credit
for their prior service with the Seller and the Seller Subsidiaries (or any
service credited as such in connection with a previous acquisition by the
Seller or any Seller Subsidiary) for purposes of the Companys severance plans
as then in effect. 

   

(b) _Credit for Past Service_. After the Effective Time, the Company and the
Company Subsidiaries shall give the Transferred Employees full credit for
their prior service with the Seller and the Seller Subsidiaries (or any
service credited as such in connection with a previous acquisition by the
Seller or any Seller Subsidiary): (i) for purposes of eligibility (including,
without limitation, initial participation and eligibility for current
benefits) and vesting under any qualified or nonqualified retirement or
profit sharing plans maintained by the Company in which Transferred Employees
may be eligible to participate; and (ii) for all purposes under any welfare
benefit plans, "cafeteria plans" (as defined in Code Section 125), vacation
plans and similar arrangements maintained by the Company. Notwithstanding
anything contained herein to the contrary, the Company will not give credit
for prior service to Transferred Employees as regards the Companys
retiree health plan. 

   

(c) _Waiver of Certain Limitations_. The Company will, or will cause the
Companys affiliates or the Seller Subsidiaries to, waive all limitations as
to preexisting conditions and waiting periods with respect to participation
and coverage requirements applicable to the Transferred Employees under any
welfare benefit plans that such employees may be eligible to participate in
after the Effective Time, other than limitations or waiting periods that are
already in effect with respect to such employees and that have not
been satisfied as of the Effective Time under any welfare plan maintained for
the Transferred Employees immediately prior to the Effective Time.
Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Transferred Employees still have to meet
the service requirements (recognizing past service credit given in Section
2(b), above) and other eligibility criteria under the Companys plans. 

   

(d) _Company s Ability to Amend, Modify or Terminate Plans_. Nothing
contained in this Annex shall limit the right of the Company or its
affiliates, at any time and from time to time, to amend, modify or terminate,
in whole or in part, any of the plans referenced in this Annex, except that
no such amendment shall nullify the provisions of this Annex, and the Company
hereby reserves such right. 

 

3\. _Employee Welfare Plans_. The Sellers existing health and dental plans
and other employee welfare benefit plans shall remain in effect at least
until the Effective Time. Thereafter, Transferred Employees will be
integrated into the Companys health and dental plans 

  ##### 

  

   

and other employee welfare plans at a time determined on a plan-by-plan basis
by the Company in its sole discretion. If integration occurs during a plan
year, Transferred Employees shall receive credit under the Companys plans
for co-pays, deductibles and similar limits incurred under Sellers plans
during such plan year. Until the Transferred Employees are integrated into
the Company plans, the respective Seller plans shall remain in effect. 

  

4\. _401(k) Profit Sharing Plan, Pentegra Defined Benefit Plan for Financial
Institutions (the "Pentegra Plan") and Supplemental Benefit Plan Agreement
With Key Executives ("Supplemental Plan")_. 

    

 (a) Prior to the Effective Time, Seller shall not make any discretionary employer contributions to Sellers 401(k) Profit Sharing Plan, its Supplemental Plan or the Pentegra Plan except to the extent consistent with past practice, unless otherwise agreed between Seller and the Company. 

   

 (b) At or prior to the Effective Time, Seller shall cause the cessation of all benefit accruals under the Pentegra Plan by its employees, and Seller shall provide all affected participants and alternate payees with written notice at least 45 days in advance of such change, unless the parties agree to a notice period as short as 15 days. 

   

 (b) At or prior to the Effective Time, Seller shall cause all benefit accruals under the Supplemental Plan to cease. 

   

 (d) At or after the Effective Time, the Sellers 401(k) Profit Sharing Plan shall be frozen, and this plan will be merged into the Companys Retirement Program subsequent to the Effective Time. Immediately after the Effective Time, the Transferred Employees will participate in the MandI Retirement Program on the same basis as other MandI employees. 

 

5\. _Code Section 125 Plans_. Company shall, or shall cause its affiliates,
to either (i) maintain any Code Section 125 plans of the Seller and Seller
Subsidiaries (the "Seller 125 Plans") for the remainder of the calendar year
in which the Effective Time occurs, or (ii) terminate any Seller 125 Plans
after the Effective Time and either allow the Transferred Employees to
participate in the Companys Code Section 125 Plan or adopt a new Code
Section 125 plan (either alternative referred to hereafter as the "New 125
Plan") for the Transferred Employees who were participating in the Seller 125
Plans and transfer the account balances of such employees under the Seller
125 Plans to the New 125 Plan. Until the Transferred Employees are integrated
into the New 125 Plan, any Seller 125 Plans shall remain in effect. 

  

6\. _Options, Deferred Shares and Restricted Stock_. 

    

(a) _Options_. In accordance with Section 1.9 of the Agreement and the
provisions of the relevant plan documents, each Option which is outstanding
immediately prior to the Effective Time, whether or not exercisable, shall be
cancelled as of the Effective Time, in exchange for a lump-sum payment from
the Surviving Corporation. 

   ##### 

  

   

(b) _Deferred Shares and Restricted Stock Issued Pursuant to the 2006-2008
Long Term Incentive Plan_. In accordance with the provisions of the relevant
plan documents (where change in control is discussed) and previous
disclosures in the Seller SEC Reports, (i) all outstanding deferred shares
that are unvested at the Effective Time of the Merger shall become vested and
be paid in cash, before applicable withholding, based on a $32.00 per share
price, upon consummation of the Merger, and (ii) all outstanding restricted
shares issued pursuant to the 2006-2008 Long Term Incentive Plan that are
unvested at the Effective Time of the Merger shall be canceled and cash
payments, before applicable withholding, in an amount equal to $32.00 per
share shall become vested and be paid in cash upon consummation of the
Merger. 

   

(c) _Other Restricted Stock_. Except to the extent provided above, any
other restricted stock issued by the Seller shall be canceled and cash
payments, before applicable withholding, in an amount equal to $32.00 per
share plus interest at MandIs money market index account rate from the date of
the Merger to the date of payment, shall be paid _ _ upon the earliest of:
(i) the normal vesting date or an agreed upon retention date (the "Vesting
Date"), provided the employee remains continuously employed with Company or
its subsidiaries through the Vesting Date, (ii) the date of termination of
the employees employment if the employees position is involuntarily
impacted or the employee terminates employment for Good Reason prior to the
Vesting Date, otherwise no payment shall be due; or (iii) an accelerated date
relating to all or any portion of any award, if and upon such conditions as
determined in the sole discretion of the Company. For purposes hereof,
"Good Reason" shall mean a reduction in the employees annual base salary in
effect at the Effective Time of the Merger, or the Company requires the
employee, without his or her consent, to relocate his or her principal
business office to a location more than 30 miles from where the employee is
employed at the Effective Time of the Merger. 

   

(d) Consistent with previous disclosures in the Seller SEC Reports, any
payment pursuant to this Section 6 will not be included in compensation for
purposes of determining benefits under any nonqualified plan in which the
