</DIV>


<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<B>AGREEMENT AND PLAN OF MERGER</B>, dated as of July&nbsp;8, 2007 (this &#147;Agreement&#148;), among MARSHALL &#038;
ILSLEY CORPORATION, a Wisconsin corporation (the &#147;Company&#148;), FIC ACQUISITION CORPORATION, a
Wisconsin corporation (the &#147;Merger Sub&#148;), and FIRST INDIANA CORPORATION, an Indiana corporation
(the &#147;Seller&#148;). Capitalized terms used herein without definition are defined in the Sections of
this Agreement specified in the index of defined terms attached hereto.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<B>WHEREAS</B>, the Boards of Directors of the Company (the &#147;Company&#146;s Board of Directors&#148;), the
Merger Sub (the &#147;Merger Sub&#146;s Board of Directors&#148;) and the Seller (the &#147;Seller&#146;s Board of
Directors&#148;) have each determined that it is advisable to and in the best interests of their
respective stockholders for the Merger Sub to merge with and into the Seller (the &#147;Merger&#148;),
pursuant to which the Seller would become a wholly-owned subsidiary of the Company, upon the terms
and subject to the conditions set forth herein and in accordance with the Indiana Business
Corporation Law (the &#147;IBCL&#148;) and the Wisconsin Business Corporation Law (the &#147;WBCL&#148;);
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<B>WHEREAS</B>, the Company&#146;s Board of Directors, the Merger Sub&#146;s Board of Directors and the
Seller&#146;s Board of Directors have each approved the Merger, upon the terms and subject to the
conditions set forth herein, and approved and adopted this Agreement; and
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<B>WHEREAS</B>, subsequent to the Seller&#146;s approval of this Agreement and concurrently with the
execution of this Agreement and as a condition and an inducement to the willingness of the Company
and the Merger Sub to enter into this Agreement, the Company has entered into a Stockholder Voting
Agreement pursuant to which each stockholder listed on Schedule&nbsp;I to such Stockholder Voting
Agreement has agreed to vote the shares of the Seller Common Stock beneficially owned by such
stockholder in favor of the Merger (the &#147;Voting Agreement&#148;).

extent that amounts are so withheld by the Company, the Surviving Corporation or the Exchange
Agent, such withheld amounts shall be treated for all purposes of this Agreement as having been
paid to the former holder of the Shares in respect of which such deduction and withholding was made
by the Company, the Surviving Corporation or the Exchange Agent, as the case may be.

Officer of the Seller have made all certifications required by Sections&nbsp;302 and 906 of
Sarbanes-Oxley at the time of such filing, and the statements contained in each such certification
were true and correct. Further, the Seller has established and maintains &#147;disclosure controls and

designed to ensure that material information (both financial and non-financial) relating to the
Seller and the Seller Subsidiaries required to be disclosed by the Seller in the reports that it
files or submits under the Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the
time periods specified in the rules and forms of the SEC, and that such information is accumulated

such internal controls are sufficient to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of
the Seller&#146;s financial reporting and the preparation of the Seller&#146;s financial statements for
external purposes in accordance with GAAP. The Seller has disclosed, based on its most recent
evaluation of internal controls prior to the date hereof, to the Seller&#146;s auditors and audit
committee (i)&nbsp;any significant deficiencies and material weaknesses known to the Seller in the
design or operation of internal controls which are reasonably likely to adversely affect in a
material respect the Seller&#146;s ability to record, process, summarize and report financial
information and (ii)&nbsp;any material fraud known to the Seller that involves management or other
employees who have a significant role in internal controls. The Seller has made available to the
Company a summary of any such disclosure regarding material weaknesses and fraud made by management
to the Seller&#146;s auditors and audit committee since December&nbsp;31, 2004. For purposes of this
Agreement, a &#147;significant deficiency&#148; in controls means an internal control deficiency that
