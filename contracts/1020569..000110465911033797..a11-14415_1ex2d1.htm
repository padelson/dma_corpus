matter or item disclosed on one Schedule shall be deemed to have been
disclosed on each other Schedule where it is reasonably apparent that such
listing or description would be appropriate. Disclosure of any item on any
Schedule shall not constitute an admission or indication that such item or

representation or warranty shall be deemed to be " _reflected on_ " or " _set

representation, (b) such item is otherwise specifically set forth on the

ARTICLE III

 



 

PURCHASE PRICE

 



 

3.1 _Initial Purchase Price_. The aggregate consideration for the purchase and
sale of the Shares and Acquired Assets shall be (I) the assumption of the
Assumed Liabilities by Purchaser or one or more of its Affiliates and (II) an
amount in cash (the " ** _Initial Purchase Price_** ") equal to:

 



 

(a) $380,000,000; _plus_

 



 

(b) the Estimated Working Capital, which may be positive or negative.

 



 

3.2 _Payment of Initial Purchase Price_. On the Closing Date, Purchaser shall
pay, or shall cause one or more of its Affiliates to pay, (I) the portion of
the Initial Purchase Price that is allocated to each respective Stock Seller
(pursuant to _Schedule 3.3_) to such respective Stock Seller by wire transfer
of immediately available United States

 



      
 

 



 

currency funds (as specified on _Schedule 3.3_) into such accounts as are
designated by each respective Stock Seller, and (II) the portion of the
Initial Purchase Price that is allocated to each respective Asset Seller
(pursuant to _Schedule 3.3_) to such respective Asset Seller by wire transfer
of immediately available United States currency funds (as specified on
_Schedule 3.3_) into such accounts as are designated by each respective Asset
Seller. All payments shall be made free and clear of any withholding.
Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, the portion of the Initial
Purchase Price allocated to the Shares of Iron Mountain Digital S.A.R.L. in
accordance with _Schedule 3.3_ shall be paid on the "Closing Date" as such
term is defined in the French Local Agreement.

 



 

3.3 _Allocation of Purchase Price_. Sellers and Purchaser agree to allocate
(I) the Initial Purchase Price (and, in the case of the Acquired Assets, the
related Assumed Liabilities) and any Final Adjustment Amount among the Shares
and the Acquired Assets as set forth on _Schedule 3.3_. Within ten (10)
Business Days upon determination of the Final Purchase Price in accordance
with _Section 3.4_, Purchaser shall prepare and deliver to the Seller
Representative (i) a copy of Form 8594 and any required exhibits thereto
allocating the portion of the Final Purchase Price allocable to the Shares of
U.S. Digital Assets as set forth on _Schedule 3.3_ among the assets held by
U.S. Digital Assets and (ii) a statement allocating the applicable portion of
the Final Purchase Price as set forth on _Schedule 3.3_ among the Acquired
Assets (together, the " ** _Asset Acquisition Statement_** "). The Asset
Acquisition Statement shall be prepared in accordance with Section 1060 of the
Code and the Treasury Regulations promulgated thereunder (and, if applicable,
in accordance with any other similar provision of state, provincial, local and
foreign Tax Law). The Seller Representative and Purchaser shall seek in good
faith to resolve any differences that they may have with respect to the Asset
Acquisition Statement. In the event that the Seller Representative and
Purchaser are unable to reach agreement on the Asset Acquisition Statement
within twenty (20) days of delivery thereof to the Seller Representative, then
each agrees to resolve any issue in dispute under this _Section 3.3_ in
accordance with the procedures set forth in _Section 11.7_. Each of the
Seller Representative and Purchaser agrees that promptly upon agreeing on the
Asset Acquisition Statement (or the determination of the Independent
Accountant) it shall return an executed copy thereof to the other party.
Neither Sellers nor Purchaser, nor any of their respective Affiliates, shall
file any Tax Return or other document or otherwise take, or agree to take, any
position on any Tax Return which is inconsistent with the Asset Acquisition
Statement, unless otherwise required by applicable Law.

 



 

3.4 _Final Purchase Price and Final Adjustment Amount_.

 



 

(a) The Initial Purchase Price shall be increased (if the Final Adjustment
Amount as determined pursuant to this _Section 3.4_ is greater than zero) or
decreased (if the Final Adjustment Amount as determined pursuant to this
_Section 3.4_ is less than zero) by an amount (the " ** _Final Adjustment
Amount_** ") equal to the difference between the Estimated Working Capital and
the Closing Working Capital, expressed as (i) a positive number if the Closing
Working Capital is greater than the Estimated Working Capital, or (ii) a
negative number if the Closing Working Capital is less than the Estimated
Working Capital.

 



      
 

 



 

(b) As promptly as practicable, but no later than sixty (60) days after the
Closing Date, Purchaser shall cause to be prepared and delivered to the Seller
Representative a closing statement (the " ** _Closing Statement_** ") setting
forth and certifying Purchasers calculation of the Net Working Capital as of
the Determination Time (" ** _Closing Working Capital_** "). " ** _Net Working
Capital_** " means the combined current assets of the Business, reduced by the
combined current liabilities of the Business, in each case as determined in
accordance with the accounting principles set forth on _Schedule 3.4(b)(I)_
(the " ** _Agreed Principles_** "). Attached hereto as _Schedule 3.4(b)(II)_
is a schedule showing a sample Net Working Capital calculation after giving
effect to the pro forma adjustments required in the Agreed Principles (the "
** _Working Capital Reference Statement_** ").

 



 

(c) If the Seller Representative disagrees with Purchasers calculation of
Closing Working Capital delivered pursuant to _Section 3.4(b)_, the Seller
Representative may, within thirty (30) days after delivery of the Closing
Statement, deliver a notice to Purchaser stating that the Seller
Representative disagrees with such calculation and specifying in reasonable
detail those items or amounts as to which the Seller Representative disagrees
and the basis therefor; _provided_ , that the Seller Representatives
disagreement may not be based upon (x) adjustments sought to be made at times
other than when such adjustments are customarily made or (y) principles other
than the Agreed Principles. To the extent not described by the Seller
Representative in such a notice of objection, the Seller Representative shall
be deemed to have agreed with all other items and amounts contained in the
Closing Statement and the calculation of Closing Working Capital delivered
pursuant to _Section 3.4(b)_.

 



 

(d) If a notice of disagreement shall be duly delivered pursuant to _Section
3.4(c)_, the Seller Representative and Purchaser shall, during the thirty (30)
days following such delivery, use their commercially reasonable efforts to
reach agreement on the disputed items or amounts in order to determine, as may
be required, the amount of Closing Working Capital. If, during such period,
the Seller Representative and Purchaser are unable to reach such agreement,
they shall promptly thereafter cause Ernst and Young LLP (the " ** _Independent
Accountant_** ") to review this Agreement and the disputed items or amounts
for the purpose of calculating Closing Working Capital (it being understood
that in making such calculation, the Independent Accountant shall be
functioning as an expert and not as an arbitrator). Each of Purchaser and the
Seller Representative agree that it shall not engage, or agree to engage, the
Independent Accountant to perform any services other than as the Independent
Accountant pursuant hereto until the Final Purchase Price and Final Adjustment
Amount have been finally determined pursuant to this _Section 3.4_. Each of
Purchaser and the Seller Representative agrees to execute, if requested by the
Independent Accountant, a reasonable engagement letter. Purchaser and the
Seller Representative shall cooperate with the Independent Accountant and
promptly provide all documents and information requested by the Independent
Accountant. In making such calculation, the Independent Accountant shall
consider only those items or amounts in the Closing Statement and Purchasers
calculation of Closing Working Capital as to which the Seller Representative
has disagreed in its notice of disagreement duly delivered pursuant to
_Section 3.4(c)_. The Independent Accountant shall deliver to the Seller
Representative and Purchaser, as promptly as practicable (but in any case no

 



      
 

 



 

later than 30 days from the date of engagement of the Independent Accountant),
a report setting forth such calculation. Such report shall be final and
binding upon the Parties, shall be deemed a final arbitration award that is
binding on the Parties, and no Party shall seek further recourse to courts or
other tribunals, other than to enforce such report. Judgment may be entered to
enforce such report in any court of competent jurisdiction. The Independent
Accountant will determine the allocation of the cost of its review and report
based on the inverse of the percentage its determination (before such
allocation) bears to the total amount of the total items in dispute as
originally submitted to the Independent Accountant. For example, if the items
in dispute equal $1,000 and the Independent Accountant awards $600 in favor of
the Seller Representatives position, 60% of the costs of its review would be
borne by Purchaser and 40% of the costs would be borne by the Seller
Representative.

 



 

(e) Within ten (10) Business Days after the determination of the Final
Purchase Price in accordance with this _Section 3.4_, the Final Adjustment
Amount shall be paid as follows: (i) if the Final Adjustment Amount is greater
than zero, Purchaser shall pay to the Seller Representative the Final
Adjustment Amount by wire transfer of immediately available funds to the
account designated by the Seller Representative, or (ii) if the Final
Adjustment Amount is less than zero, the Seller Representative shall pay to
Purchaser the Final Adjustment Amount by wire transfer of immediately
available funds to the account designated by Purchaser.

 



 

(f) Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, the portion of the Final
Adjustment Amount allocated to the Shares of Iron Mountain Digital S.A.R.L. in
accordance with _Schedule 3.3_ shall be paid on the later to occur of (i) the
"Closing Date" as such term is defined in the French Local Agreement and (ii)
simultaneously with the payment of the Final Adjustment Amount in respect of
all other Shares and Acquired Assets.

 



 

3.5 _Consents_.

 



 

(a) Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the contrary, this Agreement
shall not constitute an agreement to sell, assign, transfer, convey or deliver
any Acquired Asset or Transferred Asset or any benefit arising under or
resulting from such Acquired Asset or Transferred Asset if the sale,
assignment, transfer, conveyance or delivery thereof, without the consent of a
third party, would, upon transfer, result in termination of Purchasers rights
under such Acquired Asset or Transferred Asset. If the sale, assignment,
transfer, conveyance or delivery by any Asset Seller to, or any assumption by
Purchaser of, any interest in, or Liability under, any Acquired Asset or
Transferred Asset requires the consent of a third party, then such sale,
assignment, transfer, conveyance, delivery or assumption shall be subject to
such consent being obtained. Without limiting _Section 3.5(b)_, to the extent
any Contract that is an Acquired Asset or Transferred Asset may not be
assigned to Purchaser by reason of the absence of any such consent (" **
_Restricted Contract_** "), Purchaser shall not be required to assume any
Assumed Liabilities arising under such Restricted Contract.

 



      
 

 



 

(b) To the extent that any consent in respect of a Restricted Contract or any
other Acquired Asset or Transferred Asset shall not have been obtained on or
before the Closing Date, Purchaser shall continue to use reasonable efforts to
obtain any such consent after the Closing Date until such time as it shall
have been obtained or such Contract shall have terminated in accordance with
its terms. The Seller Representative shall, and shall cause the relevant Asset
Seller to, cooperate with Purchaser in an economically feasible arrangement to
provide that Purchaser shall receive the interest of such Asset Seller in the
benefits under such Restricted Contract or other Acquired Asset or Transferred
Asset. Purchaser shall cooperate with such Asset Seller with respect to any
such arrangement. As soon as a consent for the sale, assignment, transfer,
conveyance, delivery or assumption of a Restricted Contract or other Acquired
Asset or Transferred Asset is obtained, the Asset Seller shall promptly
assign, transfer, convey and deliver such Restricted Contract or Acquired
Asset or Transferred Asset to Purchaser, and Purchaser shall assume the
Assumed Liabilities under any such Restricted Contract from and after the date
of assignment to Purchaser pursuant to a special-purpose local asset agreement
substantially similar in terms to those of the Local Asset Agreement.

 



 

(c) Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, in the event of any
specific conflict between the requirements of this _Section 3.5_ and the
local Law applicable to any Local Asset Agreement, the requirements of such
Local Asset Agreement shall control.

 



 

3.6 _Bundled Contracts_. The Parties acknowledge that there are existing
Contracts that have been entered into by IMIM or any of its Subsidiaries that
encompass both products Related to the Business and one or more non-Business
related products (as set forth on _Schedule 3.6_ , the " ** _Bundled
Contracts_** "), which due to their broad coverage across IMIM and its
Subsidiaries products and businesses, may not be wholly assignable or
terminable. After the Closing Date, IMIM and its Subsidiaries (including the
Companies) shall work with Parent and its Subsidiaries to fulfill the
continuing obligations pursuant to the Bundled Contracts on terms agreed
pursuant to the Transition Services Agreement. Purchaser acknowledges and
agrees that (i) the Bundled Contracts are not part of the Acquired Assets or
Transferred Assets and (ii) any obligations with respect to Bundled Contracts
will be set forth in the Transition Services Agreement; _provided_ , _however_
, IMIM and its Subsidiaries shall not extend the term of any existing Bundled
Contracts with respect to the Business. Except as may be expressly provided
elsewhere in this Agreement or in the Transition Services Agreement, the
Sellers acknowledge that Purchaser shall assume no Liabilities, including Tax
Liabilities, with respect to the Bundled Contracts.

 



 

ARTICLE IV

 



 

CLOSING AND TERMINATION

 



 

4.1 _Closing Date_. The closing of the sale and purchase of the Shares and
Acquired Assets provided for in _Section 2.1_ and _Section 2.2_ hereof (the
" ** _Closing_** ") shall take place at the offices of Weil, Gotshal and Manges
LLP located at 100 Federal Street, 34th Floor, Boston, Massachusetts 02110 (or
at such other place as the Parties may

 



      
 

 



 

designate in writing) at 10:00 a.m. (Boston local time) on a date to be
specified by the parties (the " ** _Closing Date_** "), which date shall be no
later than the third Business Day after the satisfaction or waiver of the
conditions set forth in _Article IX_ (other than conditions that by their
nature are to be satisfied at the Closing, but subject to the satisfaction or
waiver of those conditions at such time), unless another time, date or place
is agreed to in writing by the Parties.

 



 

4.2 _Termination of Agreement_. This Agreement may be terminated prior to the
Closing as follows:

 



 

(a) at the election of the Seller Representative or Purchaser on or after July
1, 2011 (such date, as it may be extended pursuant to this _Section 4.2(a)_,
the " ** _Termination Date_** "), if the Closing shall not have occurred by
the close of business on such date, _provided_ , that the terminating party is
not in breach in any material respect of any of its obligations hereunder;
_provided_ , _further_ , that either the Seller Representative or Purchaser
shall have the option to extend, from time to time, the Termination Date for
additional periods of time not to exceed 60 days in the aggregate if all other
conditions to the Closing are satisfied or capable of then being satisfied and
the sole reason that the Closing has not been consummated is that the
conditions regarding regulatory consents set forth in _Sections 9.1(f)_ and
_9.2(e)_ have not been satisfied due to the failure to obtain the necessary
consents and approvals under applicable Laws or an Order of a Governmental
Body of competent jurisdiction shall be in effect and the Sellers or Purchaser
are still attempting to obtain such necessary consents and approvals under
applicable Laws, or are contesting (x) the refusal of the relevant
Governmental Body to give such consents or approvals, or (y) the entry of any
such Order, in court or through other applicable proceedings;

 



 

(b) by mutual written consent of the Seller Representative and Purchaser;

 



 

(c) by the Seller Representative or Purchaser if there shall be in effect a
final nonappealable Order of a Governmental Body of competent jurisdiction
restraining, enjoining or otherwise prohibiting the consummation of the
transactions contemplated hereby; it being agreed that subject to the last
sentence of _Section 8.4(b)_ hereof, the Parties shall promptly appeal any
adverse determination which is not nonappealable (and pursue such appeal with
reasonable diligence); _provided_ , _however_ , that the right to terminate
this Agreement under this _Section 4.2(c)_ shall not be available to a Party
if such Order was primarily due to the failure of such Party to perform any of
its obligations under this Agreement;

 



 

(d) by Purchaser if (i) any material condition to the obligations of Purchaser
hereunder becomes incapable of fulfillment other than as a result of a breach
by Purchaser of any covenant or agreement contained in this Agreement, and
such condition is not reasonably waived by Purchaser, or (ii) there has been a
breach by a Seller of any representation, warranty, covenant or agreement
contained in this Agreement, or if any representation or warranty of a Seller
shall have become untrue, in either case such that the conditions set forth in
_Sections 9.1(a)_ or _9.1(b)_ would not be

 



       
 

 



 

satisfied and, in either case, such breach is not curable, or, if curable, is
not cured within the earlier of (A) thirty (30) days after written notice of
such breach is given to the Seller Representative by Purchaser, or (B) two
Business Days prior to the Termination Date; or

 



 

(e) by the Seller Representative if (i) any material condition to the
obligations of the Sellers hereunder becomes incapable of fulfillment other
than as a result of a breach by a Seller of any covenant or agreement
contained in this Agreement, and such condition is not reasonably waived by
the Seller Representative; or (ii) there has been a breach by Purchaser of any
representation, warranty, covenant or agreement contained in this Agreement,
or if any representation or warranty of Purchaser shall have become untrue, in
either case such that the conditions set forth in _Sections 9.2(a)_ or
_9.2(b)_ would not be satisfied and, in either case, such breach is not
curable, or, if curable, is not cured within the earlier of (A) thirty (30)
days after written notice of such breach is given to Purchaser by the Seller
Representative and (B) two Business Days prior to the Termination Date.

 



 

4.3 _Procedure Upon Termination_. In the event of termination and abandonment
by Purchaser or the Seller Representative, or both, pursuant to _Section 4.2_
hereof, written notice thereof shall forthwith be given to the other Party or
Parties, and this Agreement shall terminate, and the purchase of the Shares
and Acquired Assets hereunder shall be abandoned, without further action by
Purchaser or the Sellers.

 



 

4.4 _Effect of Termination_. (a) In the event that this Agreement is validly
terminated in accordance with _Section 4.2_ and _4.3_ , then each of the
Parties shall be relieved of their duties and obligations arising under this
Agreement after the date of such termination and such termination shall be
without liability to Purchaser, Parent, any Company or any Seller; _provided_
, that all obligations of Purchaser pursuant to _Section 8.6_ and all
obligations of the Parties set forth in _Articles_ _X_ and _XI_ hereof shall
survive any such termination and shall be enforceable hereunder.

 



 

(b) Nothing in this _Section 4.4_ shall relieve the Sellers or Purchaser of
any liability for a breach of any of its covenants or agreements or willful
breach of its representations and warranties contained in this Agreement prior
to the date of termination. The damages recoverable by the non-breaching party
shall include all attorneys fees reasonably incurred by such Party in
connection with the transactions contemplated hereby.

 



 

(c) The Confidentiality Agreement shall survive any termination of this
Agreement and nothing in this _Section 4.4_ is intended to, nor shall it be
construed as, a waiver or discharge of any of the rights and obligations under
the Confidentiality Agreement of the parties thereto.

actions before the United States Patent and Trademark Office or any other
Governmental Entity anywhere in the world related to any of the Seller Owned

Intellectual Property reasonably determined by the Sellers or the Companies to
not have economic value to the Business, none of the Sellers or the Companies
have, within the past twelve (12) months, taken any action or failed to take

other inquiry of any of the FTC, the Antitrust Division or other Governmental
Body under any Antitrust Laws with respect to any such filing or any such
transaction. Each Party shall use its best efforts to furnish to each other
all information required for any application or other filing to be made
pursuant to any applicable Law in connection with the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement. Each Party shall promptly inform the other
Parties of any oral communication with, and provide copies of written
communications with, any Governmental Body regarding any such filings or any
such transaction. No Party may independently participate in any formal meeting
with any Governmental Body in respect of any such filings, investigation, or
other inquiry without giving the other Parties prior notice of the meeting
and, to the extent permitted by such Governmental Body, the opportunity to
attend and/or participate. Subject to applicable Law, the Parties will consult
and cooperate with one another in connection with any analyses, appearances,
presentations, memoranda, briefs, arguments, opinions and proposals made or
submitted by or on behalf of any Party of any Company relating to proceedings
under the HSR Act or other Antitrust Laws. Any Party may, as it deems
advisable and necessary, reasonably designate any competitively sensitive
material provided to the other parties under this _Section 8.4_ as "outside
counsel only." Such materials and the information contained therein shall be
given only to the outside legal counsel of the recipient and will not be
disclosed by such outside counsel to employees, officers, or directors of the
recipient, unless express written permission is obtained in advance from the
source of the materials.

 



 

(b) Each of Purchaser and each Seller shall use its best efforts to resolve
such objections, if any, as may be asserted by any Governmental Body with
respect to the transactions contemplated by this Agreement under the Antitrust
Laws. In connection therewith, if any Legal Proceeding is instituted (or
threatened to be instituted) challenging any transaction contemplated by this
Agreement as in violation of any Antitrust Law, each of Purchaser and each
Seller shall cooperate and use its best efforts to contest and resist any such
Legal Proceeding, and to have vacated, lifted, reversed, or overturned any
decree, judgment, injunction or other order whether temporary, preliminary or
permanent, that is in effect and that prohibits, prevents, or restricts
consummation of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, including by
pursuing all available avenues of administrative and judicial appeal, unless
by mutual agreement, Purchaser and Seller Representative decide that
litigation is not in their respective best interests. Each of Purchaser and
each Seller shall use its best efforts to take such action as may be required
to cause the expiration of the notice periods under the HSR Act or other
Antitrust Laws with respect to such transactions as promptly as possible after
the execution of this Agreement. In connection with and without limiting the
foregoing, each of Purchaser and each Company agrees to use its best efforts
to take promptly any and all steps necessary to avoid or eliminate each and
every impediment under any Antitrust Laws that may be asserted by any Federal,
state and local and non-United States antitrust or competition Governmental
Body, so as to enable the Parties to close the transactions contemplated by
this Agreement as expeditiously as possible, including effecting or committing
to effect, by consent decree, hold separate orders, trust or otherwise the
sale or disposition of such of assets of the Business as are required to be
divested in order to avoid the entry of, or to effect the dissolution of, any
decree, order, judgment, injunction, temporary restraining order or other
order in any suit or preceding,

 



      
 

 



 

that would otherwise have the effect of preventing or materially delaying the
consummation of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement; _provided_ ,
_however_ , that Purchaser shall not be required to divest a portion of the
Business that in the aggregate generated more than 25% of the net sales of the
Business (as measured by 2010 net sales of the Business).

 



 

(c) Each of Purchaser and IMIM shall use their best efforts to make or cause
to be made all filings required of each of them or any of their respective
Subsidiaries or Affiliates and to take all actions as may reasonably be
required (including those similar to the covenants contained in _Section
8.4(a)_ with respect to Antitrust Laws) in furtherance of the approval of the

any Person, then, and in each such case, proper provision shall be made so
that the successors and assigns of Purchaser shall assume all of the
obligations thereof set forth in this _Section 8.7_.

 



 

(d) The obligations of Purchaser under this _Section 8.7_ shall not be
terminated or modified in such a manner as to adversely affect any Indemnitee

_Section 8.7_ applies shall be third party beneficiaries of this _Section 8.7_
).

 



 

8.8 _Preservation of Records_. The Sellers and Purchaser agree that each of
them shall preserve and keep the records held by them or their Affiliates
relating to the Business (including, without limitation, all books and records

or in order to enable such Party to comply with its obligations under
applicable Law, this Agreement and each other agreement, document or
instrument contemplated hereby. In the event any Seller or Purchaser wishes to
destroy such records after that time (the " ** _Destroyer_** "), the Destroyer
shall first give 90 days prior written notice to the Seller Representative (if
Purchaser is the Destroyer) or Purchaser (if any Seller is the Destroyer)

(a) Each Seller agrees that, for a period of three (3) months after the
Closing Date, Purchaser may continue to distribute product literature that
uses any Retained Names and distribute products with labeling that uses any
Retained Names to the extent that such product literature and labeling exists
on the Closing Date and Purchaser has marked, or has caused the Business to
mark, such product literature and labeling to obliterate the Retained Names;
_provided_ , that for a period of six (6) months following the Closing Date,
Purchaser may continue to develop and distribute bug fixes and patches with
embedded code that causes the display of any Retained Names to the extent that
such names are embedded on the code on the Closing Date and it would be
impracticable to remove it, and solely for the maintenance and support for a
customer of the Business as of the Closing Date with respect to current
Products. " ** _Retained Names_** " means "Iron Mountain" or any name, logo or

the foregoing, including any name or mark confusingly similar thereto
(collectively, the " ** _Subject Marks_** "), and (ii) will not at any time
hold itself out as having any affiliation with Parent or any of its
Affiliates. In furtherance thereof, as promptly as practicable but in no event
later than ninety (90) days following the Closing Date, Purchaser shall

collectively as the " ** _Business Employees_**." Prior to or on the Closing
Date, Purchaser shall, except as mutually agreed in writing between Purchaser
and the Seller Representative, offer or cause any of its Affiliates to offer

credit Business Employees for service earned on and prior to the Closing Date
with Sellers and their Affiliates, or any of their respective predecessors, in
addition to service earned with Purchaser and its Affiliates on or after the
Closing Date, to the extent that the retirement or other employee benefit
plans, programs or other arrangements of Purchaser and its Affiliates take
into account service for purposes of eligibility, vesting or the calculation
of vacation, sick days, severance, layoff and similar benefits (but not for
purposes of pension benefit accruals) under any retirement or other employee
benefit plan, program or arrangement of Purchaser or any of its Affiliates for
the benefit of the Business Employees on or after the Closing Date.

occurs.

 



 

(iv) _Sales Commission Plans_. At Purchasers request prior to the Closing
Date, Sellers shall terminate as of the Closing Date any Company Benefit Plan
which is a sales commission plan, provided Purchaser has timely provided to
Sellers for distribution prior to the Closing Date to the applicable Business
Employees a written description of any new sales commission arrangement of
Purchaser.

 



 

(c) _Parent Benefit Plans_. Purchaser shall not assume and the Sellers shall
retain sponsorship of and all obligations and liabilities under the Parent

hereof and as agreed by the Parties in accordance with _Schedule 8.11(f)_.

 



 

(d) _Transfers of U.S. Business Employees_. Sellers shall cause the employment
of Business Employees working in the United States to be transferred to U.S.
Digital Assets prior to the Closing Date in a manner such that, subject to
applicable Laws, such Business Employees may be terminated at any time with or
without cause or any requisite period of notice, and U.S. Digital Assets shall
assume the accrued and unused vacation and the flexible spending accounts ("
** _FSA_** "), in each case as of the date of transfer, of such Business
Employees. Sellers shall transfer (or cause to be transferred) to within
thirty (30) days after the Closing Date a cash payment equal to the excess, if

compensation under Sellers FSA for the plan year over the aggregate amount of
reimbursements paid to such Business Employees under Sellers FSA for such
plan year, or (B) the excess, if any, of the aggregate amount of

employment, in each case arising from or relating to (i) the termination on or
after the Closing Date of any Business Employee who is employed outside of the
United States immediately prior to the Closing Date (" ** _Non-U.S. Business

condition of employment applicable to such Non-U.S. Business Employee
immediately prior to the Closing Date or (iii) any failure of any Non-U.S.
Business Employee to accept an employment offer pursuant to _Section 8.11(a)_.

such other actions as agreed by the Parties in accordance with _Schedule
8.11(f)_.

 



 

8.12 _Disclosure Schedules; Supplementation and Amendment of Schedules_. The
Seller Representative may, at its option, include in the Schedules items that
are not material in order to avoid any misunderstanding, and such inclusion,
or any references to dollar amounts, shall not be deemed to be an
acknowledgement or representation that such items are material, to establish
any standard of materiality or to define further the meaning of such terms for
purposes of this Agreement. Any matter or item disclosed on one Schedule shall
be deemed to have been disclosed on each other Schedule where it is reasonably
apparent that such listing or description would be appropriate. From time to
time prior to the Closing, the Seller Representative shall have the right to
supplement or amend the Schedules with respect to any matter hereafter arising
or discovered after the delivery of the Schedules pursuant to this Agreement.
The Seller Representative shall describe any matter set forth in any
supplement or amendment in reasonable detail. No such supplement or amendment,
or the facts or circumstances underlying such supplement or amendment, shall
have any effect on Purchasers obligations to consummate the transactions
contemplated hereby, other than any matters which (i) were required to be
included on the Schedules delivered as of the date of this Agreement or (ii)
would give Purchaser the right to terminate this Agreement pursuant to
_Section 4.2(d)_ with respect to the conditions set forth in _Section
9.1(a)_; _provided_ , _however_ , if the Closing shall occur, then Purchaser
shall be deemed to have waived any such right or claim under this Agreement or
otherwise, including pursuant to _Article X_ hereof (other than with respect
to claims for intentional breach or fraud), with respect to any and all
matters disclosed in reasonable detail pursuant to any such supplement or
amendment at or prior to the Closing which would have given Purchaser a right
to terminate this Agreement pursuant to _Section 4.2(d)_.

8.16 _Non-Competition_. ** **During the period commencing with the Closing
Date and ending on the thirty (30) month anniversary of the Closing Date,
neither Parent nor its Subsidiaries shall (a) purchase, invest in or otherwise
acquire any material interest in any Person that directly competes with the
Business by way of manufacturing, using, selling, re-selling, marketing,
developing, distributing, promoting, or otherwise exploiting any product or

(Canada) (or any successor provision thereto).

 



 

8.17 _Retained Employees_. Prior to or at the Closing, the Sellers shall cause
each employee of IM India or any other Company who is not primarily engaged in

Parent or one of its Affiliates and shall cause such successor employer to

Each Retained Employee of IM India shall be transferred on terms and
conditions of service not less favorable to such Retained Employees than those
term and conditions on which they are employed by IM India on the transfer
date, with the full benefit of the continuity of their previous employment
with IM India provided that they have, on or before the Closing Date, accepted
and agreed, in writing, the offer to their transfer. IM India shall issue
necessary letters of transfer of employment to a to-be-formed Subsidiary (" **
_Newco India_** ") in respect of each of the Retained Employees as may be
required by Law or pursuant to the terms hereof. On or before the Closing (and

to each Retained Employee his or her accrued but unpaid leave through the
Closing Date. Except as provided below and subject to _Section 8.11_, IM
India shall take full responsibility for payment of all employment benefits,
the details of which are specified in _Schedule 8.17_, to the Retained
Employees, which are due and / or payable in respect of the period up to the
transfer date, and to the extent such actual payments to Retained Employees
are not insured or otherwise funded the Seller Representative will reimburse
IM India for such payments. On and from the Closing Date, Purchaser shall
cause IM India to procure that funds lying under any of IM Indias benefits
plans, such as gratuity, provident fund and superannuation fund, allocable or
otherwise credited to any Retained Employee who immediately before the Closing
Date was a member of IM Indias relevant benefits plan, transfer to Newco
Indias relevant benefit plan (as soon as reasonably practicable after the
Closing Date) the value of the Retained Employees accrued benefits in those
Benefit Plans, calculated in accordance with the respective rules of those
schemes and on the basis of the same actuarial methods and assumptions as
those schemes apply generally to the calculation of such transfer values at
the Closing Date.

 



       
 

 



 

8.18 _Transfer of Non-Company Business Employees_. Prior to or on the Closing
Date, Sellers may cause Business Employees who are employed in the United

ARTICLE X

 



 

INDEMNIFICATION

 



 

10.1 _Survival of Representations and Warranties; Time Limitations_. (a) The
representations and warranties of the Parties contained in this Agreement
shall survive the Closing until the Survival Date and claims may be asserted
with respect thereto to the extent permitted by this _Article X_. Except as
set forth in _Section 10.5(b)_ , notwithstanding anything herein to the
contrary Purchaser must give notice to the Seller Representative of any claim
for indemnification under this _Article X_ in writing setting forth the
specific claim and the basis therefor in reasonable detail prior to the
expiration of the applicable Survival Date. Any claim for indemnification not
made by Purchaser on or prior to that date will be irrevocably and
unconditionally released and waived. In addition, Purchaser will not be
entitled to assert any claim for indemnification under _Section 10.2(a)(v)_
after the second anniversary of the date of this Agreement and any such claim
not asserted by Purchaser on or prior to that date will be irrevocably and
unconditionally released and waived.

 



 

(b) All of the covenants or other agreements of the Parties contained in this
Agreement shall survive until fully performed or fulfilled, unless and to the
extent only that non-compliance with such covenants or agreements is waived in
writing by the Party entitled to such performance. No claim for a breach of a
covenant or other agreement set forth in this Agreement that (i) by its nature
is required to be performed by or prior to Closing (the " ** _Pre-Closing
Covenants_** ") may be made or brought by any Party after the Closing Date and
(ii) by its nature is required to be performed after Closing (the " ** _Post-
Closing Covenants_** ") may be made or brought by any Party after the six (6)
month anniversary of the last date on which each such Post-Closing Covenant
was required to be performed (in each case, a " ** _Survival Period_** ");
_provided_ , _however_ , that any obligation to indemnify and hold harmless
shall not terminate with respect to any Losses to which the Person to be
indemnified shall have given notice in writing setting forth the specific

 



      
 

 



 

claim and the basis therefor to the indemnifying party in accordance with
_Section 10.4(a)_ before the termination of the applicable Survival Period.

 



 

10.2 _Indemnification by Seller Representative_.

 



 

(a) Subject to _Sections 8.12_ and _10.5_ hereof, the Seller Representative
hereby agrees to indemnify and hold Purchaser, the Companies and their
respective directors, officers, employees, Affiliates, stockholders, agents,
attorneys, representatives, successors and permitted assigns (collectively,
the " ** _Purchaser Indemnified Parties_** ") harmless from and against any
and all losses, Liabilities, claims (including third-party claims), demands,
judgments (excluding incidental and consequential damages (other than amounts
which would otherwise be Losses that are paid to third parties and which are
not themselves incidental or consequential damages) and excluding punitive or
special damages), fines, suits, actions, penalties, charges, actions, costs,
fees and expenses (including reasonable and actual out-of-pocket legal,
consultant, accounting and other professional fees) (each a " ** _Loss_** "
and, collectively, " ** _Losses_** "):

 



 

(i) based upon or resulting from the failure of any of the representations or
warranties made by Parent or the Sellers in this Agreement to be true and
correct in all respects at and as of the date hereof and at and as of the
Closing Date, except, in each case, to the extent such representations and
warranties are not true and correct as of the Closing Date as a result of any
Excluded Matter;

 



 

(ii) based upon or resulting from the breach of any Pre-Closing Covenant on
the part of Parent or the Sellers;

 



 

(iii) based upon or resulting from the breach of any Post-Closing Covenant on
the part of the Sellers;

 



 

(iv) attributable to unpaid fees, expenses or other payments incurred or owed
by any Seller, Parent or their Affiliates (but not including the Companies for
obligations incurred after the Closing) to any agent, broker or investment
banker in connection with the transactions contemplated by this Agreement; and

 



 

(v) based upon or resulting from the specific matters set forth on _Schedule
10.2(a)(v)_.

 



 

(b) Purchaser will not be entitled to indemnification for any Losses (other
than Losses incurred to pursue a successful claim under this _Article X_)
that result from any action taken by Purchaser or any of its Affiliates that
is intended to create or result in Losses and that is not taken in good faith
by Purchaser primarily to advance a bona fide business purpose other than the
collection of Losses. Purchaser shall take and shall cause its Affiliates to
take all reasonable steps to mitigate any Loss upon becoming aware of any
event which would reasonably be expected to, or does, give rise thereto.

 



      
 

 



 

10.3 _Indemnification by Purchaser_.

 



 

(a) Subject to _Section 10.5_ , Purchaser hereby agrees to indemnify and hold
the Sellers and their respective directors, officers, employees, Affiliates,
stockholders, agents, attorneys, representatives, successors and permitted
assigns (collectively, the " ** _Seller Indemnified Parties_** ") harmless
from and against, and pay to the applicable Seller Indemnified Parties the
amount of, any and all Losses:

 



 

(i) based upon or resulting from the failure of any of the representations or
warranties made by Purchaser in this Agreement to be true and correct in all
respects at and as of the date hereof and at and as of the Closing Date;

 



 

(ii) based upon or resulting from the breach of any Pre-Closing Covenant on
the part of Purchaser;

 



 

(iii) based upon or resulting from any breach of any Post-Closing Covenant on
the part of Purchaser; and

 



 

(iv) based upon, relating to or arising out of any Assumed Liabilities.

 



 

(b) The Sellers shall take and cause their Affiliates to take all reasonable
steps to mitigate any Loss upon becoming aware of any event which would
reasonably be expected to, or does, give rise thereto.

 



 

10.4 _Indemnification Procedures_.

 



 

(a) A claim for indemnification for any matter not involving a third-Person
claim may be asserted by notice to the party from whom indemnification is
sought.

 



 

(b) In the event that any Legal Proceedings shall be instituted, or that any
claim shall be asserted, by any third party in respect of which payment may be
sought under _Sections 10.2_ and _10.3_ hereof (regardless of the limitations
set forth in _Section 10.5_ ) ( an " ** _Indemnification Claim_** "), the
indemnified party shall promptly cause written notice of the assertion of any
Indemnification Claim of which it has knowledge which is covered by this
indemnity to be forwarded to the indemnifying party. The failure of the
indemnified party to give reasonably prompt notice of any Indemnification
Claim shall not release, waive or otherwise affect the indemnifying partys
obligations with respect thereto except to the extent that the indemnifying
party is prejudiced as a result of such failure. The indemnifying party shall
have the right, at its sole option and expense, to be represented by counsel
of its choice, which must be reasonably satisfactory to the indemnified party,
and to defend against, negotiate, settle or otherwise deal with any
Indemnification Claim which relates to any Losses indemnified against by it
hereunder. If the indemnifying party elects to defend against, negotiate,
settle or otherwise deal with any Indemnification Claim which relates to any
Losses indemnified against by it hereunder (a " ** _Third Party Defense_** "),
it shall within 30 days (or sooner, if the nature of the Indemnification Claim
so requires) notify the indemnified party of its

 



      
 

 



 

intent to do so. If the indemnifying party elects not to defend against,
negotiate, settle or otherwise deal with any Indemnification Claim which
relates to any Losses indemnified against hereunder, the indemnified party may
defend against, negotiate, settle or otherwise deal with such Indemnification
Claim. If the indemnifying party shall assume the defense of any
Indemnification Claim, the indemnified party may participate, at his or its
own expense, in the defense of such Indemnification Claim; _provided_ ,
_however_ , that such indemnified party shall be entitled to participate in
any such defense with separate counsel at the expense of the indemnifying
party if, (i) so requested by the indemnifying party to participate or (ii) in
the reasonable opinion of counsel to the indemnified party, a conflict or
potential conflict exists between the indemnified party and the indemnifying
party that would make such separate representation advisable; _provided_ ,
_further_ , that the indemnifying party shall not be required to pay for more
than one such counsel (plus any appropriate local counsel) for all indemnified
parties in connection with any Indemnification Claim. The Parties agree to
cooperate fully with each other in connection with the defense, negotiation or
settlement of any such Indemnification Claim. Notwithstanding anything in this
_Section 10.4_ to the contrary, neither the indemnifying party nor the
indemnified party shall, without the written consent of the other party,
settle or compromise any Indemnification Claim or permit a default or consent
to entry of any judgment unless the claimant and such party provide to such
other party an unqualified release from all liability in respect of the
Indemnification Claim. Notwithstanding the foregoing, if a settlement offer
solely for money damages is made by the applicable third party claimant, and
the indemnifying party notifies the indemnified party in writing of the
indemnifying partys willingness to accept the settlement offer and, subject
to the applicable limitations of _Sections 10.5_ and _10.6_ , pay the amount
called for by such offer, and the indemnified party declines to accept such
offer, the indemnified party may continue to contest such Indemnification
Claim, free of any participation by the indemnifying party, and the amount of
any ultimate liability with respect to such Indemnification Claim that the
indemnifying party has an obligation to pay hereunder shall be limited to the
lesser of (A) the amount of the settlement offer that the indemnified party
declined to accept plus the Losses of the indemnified party relating to such
Indemnification Claim through the date of its rejection of the settlement
offer or (B) the aggregate Losses of the indemnified party with respect to
such Indemnification Claim. If the indemnifying party makes any payment on any
Indemnification Claim, the indemnifying party shall be subrogated, to the
extent of such payment, to all rights and remedies of the indemnified party to
any insurance benefits or other claims of the indemnified party with respect
to such Indemnification Claim.

 



 

(c) The indemnifying party will not be entitled to assume any Third Party
Defense if:

 



 

(i) the Indemnification Claim seeks, in addition to or in lieu of monetary
damages, any injunctive or other equitable relief, except where non-monetary
relief is merely incidental to a primary claim or claims for monetary damages
or does not otherwise materially affect the Business or Purchaser;

 



 

(ii) the Indemnification Claim relates to or arises in connection with any
criminal proceeding, action indictment, allegation or investigation in respect

 



      
 

 



 

of the Business, but not involving any current officer of Parent or its
Subsidiaries (not including the Companies);

 



 

(iii) the Indemnification claim involves a material customer or supplier of
the Business (unless such customer or supplier is a customer or supplier of
the indemnifying party);

 



 

(iv) under applicable standards of professional conduct, a conflict on any
significant issue exists between the indemnified party and the indemnifying
party in respect of the Indemnification Claim;

 



 

(v) the Indemnification would give rise to Losses in excess of the amount
indemnifiable by the indemnifying party pursuant to this _Article X_ ; or

 



 

(vi) upon petition by the indemnified party, the appropriate court rules that
the indemnifying party failed or is failing to vigorously prosecute or defend
such Indemnification Claim.

 



 

(d) After any final decision, judgment or award shall have been rendered by a
Governmental Body of competent jurisdiction and the expiration of the time in
which to appeal therefrom, or a settlement shall have been consummated, or the
indemnified party and the indemnifying party shall have arrived at a mutually
binding agreement with respect to an Indemnification Claim hereunder, the
indemnified party shall forward to the indemnifying party notice of any sums
due and owing by the indemnifying party pursuant to this Agreement with
respect to such matter.

 



 

10.5 _Certain Limitations on Indemnification_.

 



 

(a) Notwithstanding the provisions of this _Article X_ , no Seller other than
the Seller Representative shall have any indemnification obligations pursuant
to this Agreement, and neither the Seller Representative nor Purchaser shall
have any indemnification obligations for Losses under _Sections 10.2(a)(i)_
and _(ii)_ , _Sections 10.3(a)(i)_ and _(ii)_ , as applicable, unless the
aggregate amount of all such Losses exceeds $2,500,000 (the " ** _Basket_**
"), in which event the Seller Representative shall be liable for all such
Losses from the first dollar. In no event shall the aggregate indemnification
to be paid by the Seller Representative or Purchaser under this _Article X_
exceed $28,000,000 (the " ** _Cap_** ") other than with respect to breaches by
the Seller Representative or Purchaser of any Fundamental Provision applicable
to such Party.

 



 

(b) Neither a Purchaser Indemnified Party nor a Seller Indemnified Party shall
be entitled to indemnification pursuant to _Section 10.2(a)(i)_ or _(ii)_ or
_Section 10.3(a)(i)_ or _(ii)_ with respect to any matter with respect to
which such Party had knowledge or waived compliance prior to the Closing.

 



 

(c) Purchaser shall not make any claim for indemnification under this _Article
X_ or _Article XI_ in respect of any matter to the extent that it is taken
into account in the calculation of the Final Purchase Price pursuant to
_Section 3.4_.

 



      
 

 



 

(d) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary herein, the Seller Representative
shall not be liable for, and shall not indemnify Purchaser for, any Tax
attributable to any Post-Closing Tax Period or portion of any Straddle Period
beginning after the Closing Date of any Company (as determined pursuant to
_Section 11.3_).

 



 

10.6 _Calculation of Losses_.

 



 

(a) The amount of any Losses for which indemnification is provided under this
_Article X_ shall be net of any amounts actually recovered or recoverable by
the indemnified party under insurance policies or otherwise with respect to
such Losses (net of any expenses incurred in connection with such recovery).
Purchaser shall use its commercially reasonable efforts to recover under
insurance policies for any Losses under this Agreement. Any revenues of
proceeds under insurance policies shall offset Losses and if such proceeds are
received after any indemnification payment is made or expense incurred,
Purchaser shall promptly pay the amount of such proceeds equal to any
indemnification payment or expense to the indemnifying party.

 



 

(b) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary elsewhere in this Agreement, no
Party shall, in any event, be liable to any other Person for any incidental or
consequential damages (other than amounts which would otherwise be Losses that
are paid to third parties and which are not themselves incidental or
consequential damages) or any special or punitive damages of such other
Person.

 



 

10.7 _Tax Treatment of Indemnity Payments_. The Sellers and Purchaser agree to
treat any indemnity payment made pursuant to this _Article X_ or _Article
XI_ as an adjustment to the Final Purchase Price for federal, state,
provincial, local and foreign income Tax purposes and shall allocate such
adjustment among the Shares and the Acquired Assets in accordance with their
respective pro rata portions of the Initial Purchase Price allocation set
forth on _Schedule 3.3_.

 



 

10.8 _Exclusive Remedy_. From and after the Closing, the sole and exclusive
remedy for any breach or failure to be true and correct, or alleged breach or
failure to be true and correct, of any representation or warranty or any
covenant or agreement in this Agreement, shall be indemnification in
accordance with this _Article X_. In furtherance of the foregoing, each of the
Parties hereby waives, to the fullest extent permitted by applicable Law, any
and all other rights, claims and causes of action (including rights of
contributions, if any) related to, arising out of or in connection with the
negotiation and performance of this Agreement, whether known or unknown,
foreseen or unforeseen, existing or which may arise in the future, that it may
have against the other Parties hereto, as the case may be, arising under or
based upon any federal, state or local Law (including any such Law relating to
environmental matters or arising under or based upon any securities Law,
common law or otherwise). Notwithstanding the foregoing, this _Section 10.8_
shall not operate to limit the rights of the Parties to seek equitable
remedies in accordance with _Section 10.9_ or any claims for fraud.

 



      
 

 



 

10.9 _Specific Performance_.

 



 

(a) The Parties hereby acknowledge and agree that any breach of the respective
Parties obligations to consummate the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement (including Purchasers obligation to acquire the Shares and the
Acquired Assets and pay the Initial Purchase Price and the Final Purchase
Price, and the Sellers obligation to sell the Shares and the Acquired Assets
on the Closing Date (the " ** _Closing Obligations_** ") would cause
irreparable damage to the other Parties hereto, and that in such event such
non-breaching Parties will not have an adequate remedy at Law. Therefore, the
Closing Obligations of the Parties pursuant to this Agreement shall be
enforceable by a decree of specific performance issued by any court of
competent jurisdiction, and, subject only to the terms of this Agreement, upon
application by such non-breaching party to any court of competent jurisdiction
and upon demonstration of a breach of the Closing Obligations, appropriate
injunctive relief shall be granted.

 



 

(b) Further to, and not in limitation of _Section 10.9(a)_, each of the
Parties acknowledges and agrees that any other breach of this Agreement may
cause irreparable damage to the other Parties hereto, and that in such event
such non-breaching Parties may not have an adequate remedy at Law and shall be
entitled to seek a decree of specific performance issued by any court of
competent jurisdiction, and, subject only to the terms of this Agreement,
appropriate injunctive relief may be applied for and granted in connection
therewith to enforce obligations of the Parties pursuant to this Agreement.

 



 

(c) All remedies pursuant to this _Section 10.9_ shall be cumulative and not
exclusive and shall be in addition to any other remedies which any party may
have under this Agreement or otherwise.

 



 

10.10 _GST/HST Gross Up_. If any payment made by the Seller or Purchaser
pursuant to this _Article X_ or _Article XI_ is deemed by the _Excise Tax
Act_ (Canada) to include goods and services tax or harmonized sales tax, or is
deemed by any applicable provincial or territorial legislation to include a
similar value added or multi-staged tax, the amount of such payment shall be
increased accordingly.

 



 

ARTICLE XI

 



 

TAX MATTERS

 



 

11.1 _Tax Indemnification_. Notwithstanding anything else in this Agreement,
but subject to _Sections 10.5(c)_ and _(d)_ and _Section 10.6(a)_, the
Seller Representative hereby agrees to indemnify and hold the Purchaser
Indemnified Parties harmless from and against (i) any Taxes of any of the
Companies or Acquired Assets (A) for any Pre-Closing Tax Period and (B) for
the portion of any Straddle Period ending at the close of business on the
Closing Date (determined as provided in _Section 11.3_ ), including any Taxes
imposed on any of the Companies by reason of the application of Treasury
Regulation Section 1.1502-6(a) (or any analogous or similar provision under
Tax Law), and (ii) any withholding Taxes imposed under the Code or any Tax Law
on

 



      
 

 



 

the consideration payable by Purchaser to Sellers pursuant to this Agreement
to the extent Purchaser has not otherwise withheld.

 



 

11.2 _Filing of Tax Returns; Payment of Taxes_.

 



 

(a) The Seller Representative shall timely file or cause to be filed (taking
into account all appropriate extensions) (i) all Consolidated Tax Returns of
or which include any of the Companies and Parent or any Affiliate of Parent
and (ii) all Separate Tax Returns of or with respect to any of the Companies
that are due (taking into account all appropriate extensions) on or before the
Closing Date, and in each case the Seller Representative shall remit or cause
to be remitted any Taxes due in respect of such Tax Returns.

 



 

(b) Except as provided in _Section 11.2(a)_, Purchaser shall timely file or
cause to be timely filed all Tax Returns of or which include any of the
Companies that are due (taking into account all appropriate extensions) after
the Closing Date and Purchaser shall remit or cause to be remitted any Taxes
due in respect of such Tax Returns. With respect to any such Tax Returns that
relate to Pre-Closing Tax Periods or Straddle Periods, such Tax Returns shall
be filed in a manner consistent with past practice and shall be submitted to
the Seller Representative not later than thirty (30) days prior to the due
date for filing for its review and approval, which shall not be unreasonably
withheld, delayed or conditioned.

 



 

(c) None of Purchaser or any Affiliate of Purchaser shall, or shall cause or
permit any of the Companies to, amend, refile or otherwise modify (or grant an
extension of any statute of limitation with respect to) any Tax Return
relating to any of the Companies for any Pre-Closing Tax Period or any
Straddle Period without the prior written consent of the Seller
Representative, which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld, delayed or
conditioned.

 



 

(d) None of Purchaser or any Affiliate of Purchaser shall permit or cause to
be made any transaction outside the ordinary course of business after the
Closing on the Closing Date that would result in any Taxes to, or affect a net
operating loss or any other Tax attribute of, the Sellers or any Affiliate of
the Sellers, including the Companies. None of Purchaser or any Affiliate of
Purchaser shall file or cause to be filed any election under (i) the check-
the-box rules pursuant to Treasury Regulations that is effective on or before
the Closing Date or (ii) Section 338 of the Code (or any similar provision of
state, local, or foreign Law) with respect to the purchase of the Shares or
other transactions contemplated by this Agreement. Notwithstanding anything
in this Agreement to the contrary (including without limitation Section
10.1(b)), a claim for a breach of a covenant in this Section 11.2(d) may be
made at any time until the expiration of the applicable statute of limitations
(after giving effect to any waivers or extensions thereof).

 



 

(e) After the Closing, Purchaser and Seller Representative agree to furnish or
cause to be furnished to each other, upon request, as promptly as practicable,
such information and assistance (including access to books and records and
making any

 



       
 

 



 

necessary filings or claims) as is reasonably necessary for the filing of all
Tax Returns, the making of any election relating to Taxes, the preparation for
any audit by any Taxing Authority, the prosecution or defense of any Legal
Proceeding relating to any Tax, and the claim for any refund, exemption from,
or reduction of Taxes. Any expenses incurred in furnishing such information or
assistance shall be borne by the party requesting it.

 



 

11.3 _Straddle Period Tax Allocation_.

 



 

(a) The Seller Representative will, unless prohibited by applicable Law, close
the taxable period of each of the Companies as of the close of business on the
Closing Date. Purchaser shall cause any Company that files corporate income
tax returns in Canada to make an election pursuant to subsection 256(9) of the
_Income Tax Act_ (Canada), and the regulations thereunder, in respect of its
taxation year ending on the acquisition of control of such entity by
Purchaser. If applicable Law does not permit any Company to close its taxable
year on the Closing Date or in any case in which a Tax is assessed with
respect to a Straddle Period, the Taxes, if any, attributable to a Straddle
Period shall be allocated (i) to the Seller Representative for the period up
to and including the close of business on the Closing Date, and (ii) to
Purchaser for the period subsequent to the Closing Date. Any allocation of
income or deductions required to determine any Taxes attributable to a
Straddle Period shall be made by means of a closing of the books and records
of each of the Companies as of the close of the Closing Date; _provided_ ,
that exemptions, allowances or deductions that are calculated on an annual
basis (including, but not limited to, depreciation and amortization
deductions) shall be allocated between the period ending on the Closing Date
and the period after the Closing Date in proportion to the number of days in
each such period.

 



 

(b) All real property Taxes, personal property Taxes and similar ad valorem
obligations levied with respect to the Acquired Assets for the Straddle Period
shall be apportioned between each Asset Seller and Purchaser based on the
number of days of the Straddle Period before and including the Closing Date
and the number of days of the Straddle Period after the Closing Date. Such
Asset Seller shall be liable for, and as appropriate reimburse Purchaser for,
the proportionate amount of such Taxes that is attributable to the period up
to and including the Closing Date, and Purchaser shall be liable for, and as
appropriate reimburse such Asset Seller for, the proportionate amount of such
Taxes that is attributable to the period after the Closing Date.

 



 

11.4 _Tax Contest_.

 



 

(a) If any Taxing Authority notifies Purchaser or any of its Affiliates
(including any of the Companies) of its intent to conduct a Legal Proceeding
with respect to a Tax Return or Taxes of any Company (a " ** _Tax Contest_**
") for any Pre-Closing Tax Period or Straddle Period or issues a notice of
deficiency for Taxes for any such period, Purchaser shall promptly notify the
Seller Representative thereof (but in any event within ten (10) days of
receipt of such notice). The Seller Representative, at the Seller
Representatives sole cost and expense, shall have the right to control
(including the settlement or resolution thereof) any Tax Contest that relates
to a Pre-Closing Tax Period, and Purchaser shall not, and shall not allow any
of the Companies to, settle, resolve, or

shall not, and shall not allow any of the Companies to, settle, resolve or

relates to a Pre-Closing Tax Period: (i) Purchaser shall cause the applicable

Contest; and (iii) if requested by the Seller Representative, Purchaser shall

is not required to pay under this Agreement).

 



 

(d) The Seller Representative and Purchaser jointly shall represent the
interests of any of the Companies in any Tax Contest with respect to a Tax

Parent, on the other hand, represent the entire understanding and agreement
between the Parties with respect to the subject matter hereof and thereof.
This Agreement can be amended, supplemented or changed, and any provision
hereof can be waived, only by written instrument making specific reference to
this Agreement signed by the Party against whom enforcement of any such
amendment, supplement, modification or waiver is sought. No action taken
pursuant to this Agreement, including any investigation by or on behalf of any
Party, shall be deemed to constitute a waiver by the Party taking such action
of compliance with any representation, warranty, covenant or agreement
contained herein. The waiver by any Party of a breach of any provision of this
Agreement shall not operate or be construed as a further or continuing waiver
of such breach or as a waiver of any other or subsequent breach. No failure on
the part of any Party to exercise, and no delay in exercising, any right,
power or remedy hereunder shall operate as a waiver thereof, nor shall any
single or partial exercise of such right, power or remedy by such Party
preclude any other or further exercise thereof or the exercise of any other
right, power or remedy.

 



 

12.6 _Governing Law_. This Agreement, and all claims or causes of action
(whether in contract or tort) that may be based upon, arise out of or relate

or related to any representation or warranty made in or in connection with
this Agreement or as an inducement to enter this Agreement) shall be governed

rem_ pursuant to the applicable Local Share Transfer Agreement shall take
place pursuant to German law in accordance with international corporate
principles and the transfers according to all other non-U.S. Local Share
Transfer Agreements shall be governed by relevant applicable local Law in

the contrary, each Indemnitee is hereby expressly made a third party
beneficiary of _Section 8.7_ hereof. No assignment of this Agreement or of
any rights or obligations hereunder may be made by any Party, directly or
indirectly (by operation of law or otherwise), without the prior written
consent of Purchaser (in the case of any Seller) and the Seller Representative
(in the case of Purchaser) and any attempted assignment without the required
consents shall be void; _provided_ , that Purchaser may assign any of its
respective rights or obligations hereunder to any of its direct or indirect
Subsidiaries; _provided_ , _further_ , that in such event Purchaser shall
remain liable for all obligations hereunder. No assignment of any obligations
hereunder shall relieve the Parties of any such obligations. Upon any such
permitted assignment, the references in this Agreement to Purchaser shall also
apply to any such assignee unless the context otherwise requires.

 



 

12.10 _Non-Recourse_. No past, present or future director, officer, employee,
incorporator, member, partner, stockholder, Affiliate, agent, attorney or
representative of any Party or any of their respective Affiliates shall have
any liability for any obligations or liabilities of such Party under this
